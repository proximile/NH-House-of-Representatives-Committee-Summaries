00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:09.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
living with some pain but
 
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.910 align:start position:0%
living with some pain but
more

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:14.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh voice is strong
 
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:20.800 align:start position:0%
she says that as they've been doing the
 
00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
lab work the potassium has been at like
 
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
130 which is not 135 but 130 is better
 
00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 align:start position:0%
and she said her potassium is right
 
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
so between her potassium and sodium
 
00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:38.559 align:start position:0%
might those sound like the big
 
00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239 align:start position:0%
how about have you got b you in and
 
00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:41.750 align:start position:0%
how about have you got b you in and
create

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
create
 
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
she's convinced she doesn't need
 
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
kidney replacement and so
 
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 align:start position:0%
uh also would you mention to rebecca
 
00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
that i'm still here
 
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 align:start position:0%
so her car has been sitting in my
 
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
driveway for over a week
 
00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
all she has to do is use the triple a
 
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
card i gave her for christmas
 
00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
call triple a and tell him to come
 
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
replace your battery
 
00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 align:start position:0%

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 align:start position:0%
aaa came once before
 
00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 align:start position:0%
and instead of doing a permanent fix
 
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
they jumped
 
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
well she drove it around
 
00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
no no no so you mean a deep charge a
 
00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 align:start position:0%

human services
 
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
difficulties we're working under
 
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 align:start position:0%
presently is getting people to staff
 
00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 align:start position:0%
committees that are appointed to study
 
00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:41.270 align:start position:0%
committees that are appointed to study
items

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
items
 
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 align:start position:0%
the speaker has
 
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
not only asked me to try to fill such
 
00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.749 align:start position:0%
not only asked me to try to fill such
positions

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
regarding health and human services
 
00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
increasingly i've been asked to try to
 
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
fill any positions
 
00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 align:start position:0%
making recommendations on who would be a
 
00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
good fit
 
00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
so i can tell you it's very very
 
00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.950 align:start position:0%
so i can tell you it's very very
difficult

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 align:start position:0%
there are some people who do not want to
 
00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
serve or cannot for various reasons
 
00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
there's other people whose skill sets
 
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
are in wonderful but in different areas
 
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
in this kind of work
 
00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:15.039 align:start position:0%
and then that just leaves the people who
 
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
are already on multiple of these
 
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.430 align:start position:0%
are already on multiple of these
committees

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
committees
 
00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
and i've gotten turned down most
 
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
wonderfully by so many people because
 
00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 align:start position:0%
they said i'm already on five i can't do
 
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 align:start position:0%
any more so the word is coming down and
 
00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:31.039 align:start position:0%
it is seconded by
 
00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh my colleagues across the aisle in the
 
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
house that if possible can we go a
 
00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 align:start position:0%
different route other than
 
00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 align:start position:0%
appointing a
 
00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:43.759 align:start position:0%
specific committee of house members
 
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
and senators and i hear senators are
 
00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
appointed to a lot of different
 
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 align:start position:0%
committees too
 
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:49.830 align:start position:0%
committees too
and

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:53.039 align:start position:0%
we'll see what we can do here um
 
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
so it was suggested
 
00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.230 align:start position:0%
so it was suggested
to

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
representative yokela
 
00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
that um perhaps we could go in a little
 
00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:03.919 align:start position:0%
different direction to get people in an
 
00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:05.919 align:start position:0%
ad hoc working group that would come
 
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
back and make good recommendations
 
00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
i as chairman of health and human
 
00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
services have also in a parallel track
 
00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 align:start position:0%
asked four members of my committee to
 
00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
brainstorm come up with some ideas not
 
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120 align:start position:0%
in a formal way but see if they would
 
00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
recommend some good things too so i
 
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
would record
 
00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
recognize representative ocala to come
 
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
up and
 
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
speak to his um
 
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
and he'll tell us why
 
00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
this bill has
 
00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:42.319 align:start position:0%
importance to it and
 
00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:44.560 align:start position:0%
perhaps how we should go
 
00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
forward in changing
 
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
laws or making recommendations for
 
00:06:59.430 --> 00:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
somebody who's techy
 
00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:07.120 align:start position:0%
somebody who isn't techy but has done
 
00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:17.360 align:start position:0%

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:57.029 --> 00:07:57.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:00.240 align:start position:0%

prescribed all of those may
cause

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
cause
 
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
currently in under our law
 
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
those people to be uh committing a crime
 
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
and you know one of the things that we
 
00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:16.399 align:start position:0%
are are trying to do right now is not
 
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
one uh change uh that
 
00:09:23.509 --> 00:09:23.519 align:start position:0%
um we don't put um
 
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
kids into the legal system unnecessarily
 
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
and to
 
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
to um
 
00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.470 align:start position:0%
to um
treat

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
treat
 
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
if there was some nefarious reason why
 
00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:34.160 align:start position:0%
they were having this
 
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:40.389 --> 00:09:40.399 align:start position:0%
either a mental health or a substance
 
00:09:40.399 --> 00:09:41.750 align:start position:0%
either a mental health or a substance
abuse

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
abuse
 
00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
issue and not a legal issue
 
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
and so um
 
00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
so the first part of the bill is to
 
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:52.240 align:start position:0%
to um repeal that restriction on on
 
00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
minors but then there's the there's a
 
00:09:57.829 --> 00:09:57.839 align:start position:0%
separate section of law that says if
 
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:05.269 --> 00:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
the the needle syringe epipen
 
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
auto injector to a minor then that is
 
00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
also a crime and i wanted to look into
 
00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:11.350 align:start position:0%
also a crime and i wanted to look into
that

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.389 align:start position:0%
that
and

00:10:12.389 --> 00:10:12.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:17.430 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
so i proposed a study committee to look
 
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
into that issue instead of um
 
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:10:25.509 --> 00:10:25.519 align:start position:0%
suggesting my my solution to that
 
00:10:25.519 --> 00:10:26.470 align:start position:0%
suggesting my my solution to that
problem

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:10:28.949 --> 00:10:28.959 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
so it was suggested at this committee
 
00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:31.990 align:start position:0%
so it was suggested at this committee
hearing

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
that one i do my own research to to try
 
00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
and come up with some language
 
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
and two to perform an ad hoc committee
 
00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:41.829 align:start position:0%
and two to perform an ad hoc committee
um

00:10:41.829 --> 00:10:41.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:44.829 --> 00:10:44.839 align:start position:0%
and or a subcommittee of this committee
 
00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
um to do more research um so that this
 
00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
issue could be addressed more
 
00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.949 align:start position:0%
issue could be addressed more
comprehensively

00:10:52.949 --> 00:10:52.959 align:start position:0%
comprehensively
 
00:10:52.959 --> 00:10:54.630 align:start position:0%
comprehensively
um

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:57.509 --> 00:10:57.519 align:start position:0%
in the near term and not um push it out
 
00:10:57.519 --> 00:10:58.230 align:start position:0%
in the near term and not um push it out
for

00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:58.240 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
for too long so
 
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
since then i have reached out to
 
00:11:10.389 --> 00:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
nurses school nurses association
 
00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
camp counselor or camp camp nurses
 
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
i have reached out to
 
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
dhhs because we have in new hampshire a
 
00:11:26.069 --> 00:11:26.079 align:start position:0%
syringe program
 
00:11:26.079 --> 00:11:27.509 align:start position:0%
syringe program
that

00:11:27.509 --> 00:11:27.519 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:29.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't specifically
 
00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
offers syringe services
 
00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:36.949 align:start position:0%
offers syringe services
to

00:11:36.949 --> 00:11:36.959 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:39.200 align:start position:0%
minors but it is not forbidden and there
 
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
are states like
 
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
north carolina offers syringe services
 
00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
to anyone
 
00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
and one of the reasons why we do that is
 
00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:52.310 align:start position:0%
and one of the reasons why we do that is
is

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:54.160 align:start position:0%
the cdc
 
00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
has has suggested that um you know
 
00:11:58.389 --> 00:11:58.399 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:00.160 align:start position:0%
limit the syringe
 
00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.710 align:start position:0%
limit the syringe
uh

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:04.949 --> 00:12:04.959 align:start position:0%
availability has caused blood-borne
 
00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
disease problems and so we don't really
 
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
want to move forward with that and so
 
00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
there's been an effort to
 
00:12:15.269 --> 00:12:15.279 align:start position:0%
make syringes
 
00:12:15.279 --> 00:12:17.590 align:start position:0%
make syringes
not

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
reduce the prescriptions for adults
 
00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
which which has been in a lot of places
 
00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:24.710 align:start position:0%
which which has been in a lot of places
and

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.230 align:start position:0%
and
just

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:26.240 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
have more availability and so i've
 
00:12:30.389 --> 00:12:30.399 align:start position:0%
reached out to a bunch of people and
 
00:12:33.509 --> 00:12:33.519 align:start position:0%
i've proposed and i've come up with
 
00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
um what i think may be a proposed
 
00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
amendment for the
 
00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:42.150 align:start position:0%
amendment for the
adult

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:44.069 --> 00:12:44.079 align:start position:0%
language the amendment would not come
 
00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
here it would come to hhs and ea however
 
00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
having to do with the study committee
 
00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
for reasons already given it might be a
 
00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
better ad hoc
 
00:12:58.790 --> 00:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
group of people who meet often bills
 
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
come to us out of those
 
00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
and so um are you
 
00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:05.200 align:start position:0%
suggesting that that would be a better
 
00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
way something that would be a work group
 
00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.550 align:start position:0%
way something that would be a work group
perhaps

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
perhaps is a subgroup of us uh with
 
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
one of our people being part of that and
 
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
then others that we've pulled together
 
00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
we would be
 
00:13:27.829 --> 00:13:27.839 align:start position:0%
if we had us some
 
00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
representation from from this committee
 
00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
health and human services committee
 
00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:37.110 align:start position:0%
health and human services committee
um

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:39.269 --> 00:13:39.279 align:start position:0%
to be able to talk to
 
00:13:40.629 --> 00:13:40.639 align:start position:0%
some of these people
 
00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
um and and uh the ideas okay that come
 
00:13:46.069 --> 00:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
forward anybody from the
 
00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
oversight committee wanted to weigh in
 
00:13:50.069 --> 00:13:50.079 align:start position:0%
representative edwards uh thank you mr
 
00:13:50.079 --> 00:13:51.269 align:start position:0%
representative edwards uh thank you mr
chair

00:13:51.269 --> 00:13:51.279 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:13:51.279 --> 00:13:52.150 align:start position:0%
chair
um

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:52.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:54.949 --> 00:13:54.959 align:start position:0%
i i'm empathetic with with the issue as
 
00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
you've described it i'm i i am
 
00:13:59.430 --> 00:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
personally a little confused because i i
 
00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
have an understanding of how policy
 
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
committees work and how oversight works
 
00:14:06.069 --> 00:14:06.079 align:start position:0%
and i don't i don't understand what an
 
00:14:08.069 --> 00:14:08.079 align:start position:0%
appropriate response would be to you in
 
00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
this situation i i would tell you that
 
00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:11.990 align:start position:0%
this situation i i would tell you that
personally

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
personally
 
00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
i don't get really really busy for
 
00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
another two to three weeks so if we can
 
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
knock this out quickly absolutely i'd
 
00:14:21.189 --> 00:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
personally be happy to do it
 
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
also if you're thinking about ideas of
 
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
where you could turn to maybe get some
 
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.350 align:start position:0%
where you could turn to maybe get some
input

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
input
 
00:14:30.069 --> 00:14:30.079 align:start position:0%
right now the governor's commission on
 
00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:32.320 align:start position:0%
alcohol drug abuse prevention and
 
00:14:35.189 --> 00:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
treatment is is meeting and patrick
 
00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
tufts might be a good person i can give
 
00:14:39.509 --> 00:14:39.519 align:start position:0%
you the contact information to just give
 
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
you some advice on somebody on the
 
00:14:43.509 --> 00:14:43.519 align:start position:0%
commission that might want to
 
00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
participate and because you have such a
 
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
great room of
 
00:14:49.829 --> 00:14:49.839 align:start position:0%
of experts here you know maybe somebody
 
00:14:51.189 --> 00:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
will grab you
 
00:14:53.189 --> 00:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
and say that they'd like to participate
 
00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
like i see
 
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
moira back there child advocate you know
 
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
so um all right so
 
00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
so i i i guess that was the purpose was
 
00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
to try to find some people that might ad
 
00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
hoc with him uh no
 
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
yeah but the real purpose is uh should
 
00:15:12.629 --> 00:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
this be a
 
00:15:12.639 --> 00:15:13.829 align:start position:0%
this be a
committee

00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:13.839 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:15:16.949 --> 00:15:16.959 align:start position:0%
out of bill 1616 as it's written and
 
00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to probably say no in the
 
00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
committee for simply the reasons of
 
00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
staffing or should this be simply an ad
 
00:15:26.389 --> 00:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
hoc group of people you pull together
 
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
or could it be an ad hoc group of people
 
00:15:31.749 --> 00:15:31.759 align:start position:0%
that maybe finds a little home coming
 
00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:34.240 align:start position:0%
under the umbrella of us for a brief
 
00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
period of time those are the options we
 
00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.990 align:start position:0%
period of time those are the options we
have

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to come out of here could
 
00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
be on your very own but it might
 
00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
be also possible to come out of this
 
00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
oversight committee anybody else with
 
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
any thoughts
 
00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:09.189 --> 00:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
insurance um programs are entirely
 
00:16:11.749 --> 00:16:11.759 align:start position:0%
unfunded by the state and i think any
 
00:16:14.069 --> 00:16:14.079 align:start position:0%
mandate on these programs would first of
 
00:16:16.069 --> 00:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
all be unfunded
 
00:16:17.749 --> 00:16:17.759 align:start position:0%
and second of all it would interfere
 
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
with the mission of the syringe service
 
00:16:21.509 --> 00:16:21.519 align:start position:0%
programs which is specifically to reduce
 
00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
the spread of some police severe
 
00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
infectious consequences amongst the
 
00:16:27.269 --> 00:16:27.279 align:start position:0%
vulnerable population so i would be very
 
00:16:29.749 --> 00:16:29.759 align:start position:0%
much opposed to this
 
00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
i don't think representative that that's
 
00:16:34.069 --> 00:16:34.079 align:start position:0%
really where he's going he would just
 
00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
like it possible for somebody to have an
 
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
epipen it's really more along that than
 
00:16:41.189 --> 00:16:41.199 align:start position:0%
anything else but
 
00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
i did reach out to
 
00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:46.570 align:start position:0%
some of the syringe services
 
00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:47.670 align:start position:0%
some of the syringe services
[Music]

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:16:50.389 --> 00:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
people and the people at dhhs that run
 
00:16:54.069 --> 00:16:54.079 align:start position:0%
the syringe services program and
 
00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
to ask them if they
 
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
had the ability or currently had the
 
00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
desire to
 
00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
be able to serve that population the
 
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
under 18 population
 
00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
um it isn't a big population because
 
00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:09.350 align:start position:0%
um it isn't a big population because
that's

00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:10.230 align:start position:0%
that's
um

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:10.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:14.240 align:start position:0%
usually using uh syringes for nefarious
 
00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
reasons is
 
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
is happening later in life like 20s plus
 
00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:22.720 align:start position:0%
but there are um
 
00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.230 align:start position:0%
but there are um
but

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
the question that i posed to them is
 
00:17:27.669 --> 00:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
should we be forbidding them from doing
 
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
that if they had the funding to uh and
 
00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
someone asked for their help would
 
00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
would they be opposed to that and so
 
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
that's one of the discussion topics for
 
00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
for giving them an exception to be able
 
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
to service those people but it's not a
 
00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
mandate um definitely
 
00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:50.720 align:start position:0%
any further question on whether we
 
00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:53.029 align:start position:0%
any further question on whether we
should

00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:53.039 align:start position:0%
should
 
00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
with one person from this
 
00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:56.789 align:start position:0%
with one person from this
committee

00:17:56.789 --> 00:17:56.799 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:17:59.350 --> 00:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
work with representative yokola
 
00:18:01.669 --> 00:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
as a subgroup of us that's that's the
 
00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:07.029 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:18:07.029 --> 00:18:07.039 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
so so so to the that question
 
00:18:10.559 --> 00:18:11.430 align:start position:0%
so so so to the that question
of

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:11.440 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
whether oversight should take on
 
00:18:19.909 --> 00:18:19.919 align:start position:0%
a role of mentoring or or sponsoring um
 
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
a work group like this
 
00:18:24.789 --> 00:18:24.799 align:start position:0%
i i would just say i i don't know that
 
00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
there's a precedent for that and it
 
00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't it just doesn't feel right to me
 
00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
from an oversight position i i think i
 
00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
think what is being asked is more of a
 
00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
policy committee issue and not
 
00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
not what this committee does so i i'm
 
00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
not opposed to what he's doing i'm just
 
00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
trying to think functionally is if this
 
00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
is the appropriate committee and it
 
00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't feel to me like it is
 
00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:55.029 --> 00:18:55.039 align:start position:0%
he does have the fallback position of
 
00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
being able to pull a work group together
 
00:18:58.630 --> 00:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
on his own
 
00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:00.150 align:start position:0%
on his own
and

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:00.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
i've already as i said have four people
 
00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
from health and human services committee
 
00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:06.160 align:start position:0%
looking at this issue and
 
00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
you can pull them in if you
 
00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:10.150 align:start position:0%
you can pull them in if you
uh wish

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:10.160 align:start position:0%
uh wish
 
00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't sound like we have
 
00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:15.110 align:start position:0%
doesn't sound like we have
the

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
votes to do this
 
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
but now we're aware of it
 
00:19:21.909 --> 00:19:21.919 align:start position:0%
and i'll work with you
 
00:19:21.919 --> 00:19:23.350 align:start position:0%
and i'll work with you
on

00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
that other alternative okay
 
00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
sure thank you thank you absolutely
 
00:19:31.909 --> 00:19:31.919 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
senator gray
 
00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
i was the sponsor of the syringe
 
00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
exchange program
 
00:19:40.549 --> 00:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
you know that that passed
 
00:19:40.559 --> 00:19:41.430 align:start position:0%
you know that that passed
and

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:19:44.549 --> 00:19:44.559 align:start position:0%
there's many issues
 
00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
i i've tried
 
00:19:53.909 --> 00:19:53.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
there's many issues that go along with
 
00:19:59.110 --> 00:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
that and and
 
00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
you know like even in the city of
 
00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
rochester there were complaints about
 
00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
the syringe exchange program that was
 
00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
going on there and the policing of it by
 
00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
the people who were
 
00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
taking advantage of it and and i agree
 
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
with representative edwards that a
 
00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
policy committee is much more
 
00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
equipped to deal with that
 
00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
our job is to say well
 
00:20:26.789 --> 00:20:26.799 align:start position:0%
certain things have been passed and
 
00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to see that they are
 
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
implemented rather than try to craft a
 
00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:32.950 align:start position:0%
implemented rather than try to craft a
bill

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.789 align:start position:0%
bill
so

00:20:34.789 --> 00:20:34.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:20:35.909 --> 00:20:35.919 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
i think we have our answer and i'll be
 
00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
back with you representative some good
 
00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
ideas here we just got to get them in
 
00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
the right place thank you
 
00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:44.870 align:start position:0%
the right place thank you
and

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:46.640 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
now on the agenda and sorry uh is not
 
00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
sorry that it's now on the agenda but
 
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
sorry for you getting bumped down as
 
00:21:00.789 --> 00:21:00.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
mr technical person on the floor has the
 
00:21:07.909 --> 00:21:07.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:07.919 --> 00:21:12.149 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:21:12.149 --> 00:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
this is okay i don't want to have my
 
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
so i just want to give a brief update on
 
00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
a couple of uh key things going on in
 
00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
the department
 
00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
under covid right now we are evaluating
 
00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
the data that we're using
 
00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
as we
 
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
as we move further along the the through
 
00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
the pandemic and we rely more on at home
 
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
testings things like that
 
00:21:45.669 --> 00:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
data points like active case counts are
 
00:21:48.149 --> 00:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
become more unreliable as we move to
 
00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
more of an at-home testing base
 
00:21:53.029 --> 00:21:53.039 align:start position:0%
so over the next couple weeks we are
 
00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
really going to be looking at the data
 
00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
that we're reporting in what is valuable
 
00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
what's a value add to both tracking and
 
00:22:02.549 --> 00:22:02.559 align:start position:0%
our response to the pandemic
 
00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
i think when we know that
 
00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
you know our case counts for example
 
00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
we're reporting two or three thousand a
 
00:22:13.029 --> 00:22:13.039 align:start position:0%
day it's probably double that right so
 
00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
we we just ordered a million more
 
00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:16.310 align:start position:0%
we we just ordered a million more
at-home

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
at-home
 
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
covet tests uh the antigen test that
 
00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
will be sold in liquor store for cost so
 
00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:23.440 align:start position:0%
as we rely more and more at the
 
00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
at the
 
00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
at-home basis we don't want to give
 
00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:28.549 align:start position:0%
at-home basis we don't want to give
either

00:22:28.549 --> 00:22:28.559 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
a false sense that cases are going down
 
00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
when they're not
 
00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
or that there's really three thousand
 
00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
cases a day when it's maybe five
 
00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
thousand cases a day so
 
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
i think what you're going to see is
 
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
probably a new uh
 
00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
a new component of data coming out on on
 
00:22:47.669 --> 00:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
what's driving our response it's mostly
 
00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
going to be around hospitalizations and
 
00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
fatalities it's not that we're not going
 
00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
to report case data but we're going to
 
00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:57.280 align:start position:0%
become less reliant on it
 
00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
so that works being done over the next
 
00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
couple of weeks
 
00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
as i said we ordered a million at-home
 
00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
tests we got approval to order a million
 
00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
at-home tests on wednesday
 
00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
we expect them to be in the state in
 
00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
seven to ten days after the order is
 
00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
placed and then after a couple days of
 
00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:15.280 align:start position:0%
processing by the liquor commission
 
00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
they'll be in our liquor stores
 
00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
for sale
 
00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
at cost plus the cost to distribute
 
00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
through the liquor commission
 
00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
in the prior
 
00:23:28.789 --> 00:23:28.799 align:start position:0%
month we've stood up two strike teams
 
00:23:30.789 --> 00:23:30.799 align:start position:0%
and in long-term care facilities one at
 
00:23:33.029 --> 00:23:33.039 align:start position:0%
premier and one at ridgewood
 
00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
we have a third one coming on board
 
00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
edgewood on february 7th and then we
 
00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
have a rehab strike team that we got
 
00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
approval for on wednesday and at the
 
00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
previous previous fiscal meeting to do a
 
00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
rehab strike team that's coming on board
 
00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
february 14th
 
00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
so far with our long-term care program
 
00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
where we're trying to move long-term
 
00:23:55.029 --> 00:23:55.039 align:start position:0%
care residents out of acute care
 
00:23:56.789 --> 00:23:56.799 align:start position:0%
hospitals and back into
 
00:23:59.590 --> 00:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
a long-term care setting we have moved
 
00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:02.720 align:start position:0%
64 into county facilities with the
 
00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:04.559 align:start position:0%
guarantee that their medicaid would be
 
00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:08.240 align:start position:0%
covered and we've moved 62 into the
 
00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
strike facilities so total approximately
 
00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
122 people we've moved out of hospitals
 
00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:15.200 align:start position:0%
and into in a more appropriate
 
00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.669 align:start position:0%
and into in a more appropriate
environment

00:24:17.669 --> 00:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
environment
 
00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
that's it for covid
 
00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:20.549 align:start position:0%
that's it for covid
under

00:24:20.549 --> 00:24:20.559 align:start position:0%
under
 
00:24:23.669 --> 00:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
mental health we're expecting imd
 
00:24:26.149 --> 00:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
approval so our the waiver that we
 
00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
submitted last year we're expecting that
 
00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:30.400 align:start position:0%
in the spring
 
00:24:32.789 --> 00:24:32.799 align:start position:0%
of this year the intent on applying for
 
00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
this waiver was to attract private
 
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
private behavioral health providers to
 
00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
our state
 
00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
so that they can run both in patient and
 
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
outpatient capacity we are hoping to
 
00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
bring two projects forward in the coming
 
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
months to build our inpatient capacity
 
00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
in our state through public-private
 
00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:50.630 align:start position:0%
in our state through public-private
partnerships

00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
partnerships
 
00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
with a couple of different entities so
 
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
we're we're still working through some
 
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
of those details but hopefully in the
 
00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
coming months we'll be able to bring
 
00:25:00.549 --> 00:25:00.559 align:start position:0%
those to the table
 
00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
representative marsh
 
00:25:05.269 --> 00:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i don't think my
 
00:25:05.279 --> 00:25:10.750 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i don't think my
mic

00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:13.029 --> 00:25:13.039 align:start position:0%
is clearly
 
00:25:15.669 --> 00:25:15.679 align:start position:0%
issues with the data that's being
 
00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
presented with income tests i think that
 
00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire citizens clearly have
 
00:25:21.909 --> 00:25:21.919 align:start position:0%
an interest in the prevalence of coven
 
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
in our communities
 
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
two years ago i asked des if they would
 
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
look at a wastewater monitoring program
 
00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:31.919 align:start position:0%
as they've now implemented in boston
 
00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:34.240 align:start position:0%
because that gives
 
00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
results as to what's going on throughout
 
00:25:38.789 --> 00:25:38.799 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
throughout the area of their wastewater
 
00:25:42.549 --> 00:25:42.559 align:start position:0%
system and that has shown both the rise
 
00:25:44.789 --> 00:25:44.799 align:start position:0%
and the fall of the front variant in in
 
00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
the boston area
 
00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
i do believe we have a number of
 
00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
wastewater systems where that can be
 
00:25:50.789 --> 00:25:50.799 align:start position:0%
implemented relatively quickly and
 
00:25:52.789 --> 00:25:52.799 align:start position:0%
inexpensively in the state of new
 
00:25:54.149 --> 00:25:54.159 align:start position:0%
hampshire and i reported inquired a
 
00:25:56.789 --> 00:25:56.799 align:start position:0%
couple weeks ago from des if they would
 
00:25:58.630 --> 00:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
consider such a thing
 
00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to hear back from them
 
00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
would the department consider doing
 
00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
something like that instead so we
 
00:26:05.909 --> 00:26:05.919 align:start position:0%
continue to have some data as to the
 
00:26:05.919 --> 00:26:09.190 align:start position:0%
continue to have some data as to the
prevalence

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
we've used wastewater treatment programs
 
00:26:14.549 --> 00:26:14.559 align:start position:0%
in private areas right like new
 
00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital monitor circovid in
 
00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
their hospital based on wastewater tests
 
00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
and unh conducts those so i can connect
 
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
with unh and see if there is interest in
 
00:26:25.669 --> 00:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
expanding their programs they've done
 
00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment
 
00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
testing for their campus
 
00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
for a variety of nursing homes for the
 
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
hospital so the the the science and the
 
00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:36.400 align:start position:0%
testing is there obviously
 
00:26:37.669 --> 00:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure that we're
 
00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:39.200 align:start position:0%
connecting with the right people to see
 
00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
if we can do that and are there
 
00:26:42.549 --> 00:26:42.559 align:start position:0%
municipalities cities that are
 
00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
interested in it you know is the city of
 
00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
concord interested or city of manchester
 
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
whomever so let me connect with unh and
 
00:26:50.789 --> 00:26:50.799 align:start position:0%
their wastewater program and see what
 
00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
their uh their ability is to scale up
 
00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
i i agree with that um but if i'm
 
00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
reporting inaccurate data because
 
00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
there's thousands of tests being done at
 
00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
home then i don't want to give the
 
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
would it be possible when
 
00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
giving the number of positive test
 
00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:29.830 align:start position:0%
giving the number of positive test
results

00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
results
 
00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
there's an immediate statement a
 
00:27:34.389 --> 00:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
disclaimer saying this we believe this
 
00:27:36.549 --> 00:27:36.559 align:start position:0%
number to be artificially low because of
 
00:27:36.559 --> 00:27:37.350 align:start position:0%
number to be artificially low because of
the

00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:27:39.909 --> 00:27:39.919 align:start position:0%
proliferation of home tests the data of
 
00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
which are not reported yes sort of like
 
00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
the surgeon general's warning on a pack
 
00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
of cigarettes yes we've used that
 
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
messaging pretty regularly throughout
 
00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
the last couple of months as the
 
00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
insurgent up home tests have come out
 
00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
and we will still continue to report
 
00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
case counts and tests but what we don't
 
00:27:59.110 --> 00:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
want is as
 
00:28:00.789 --> 00:28:00.799 align:start position:0%
thousands of people in new hampshire
 
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
start doing at-home tests for them to
 
00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
feel like they have to call public
 
00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
health and report their positive because
 
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
we don't have the resources to do that
 
00:28:09.269 --> 00:28:09.279 align:start position:0%
either so we will still continue to
 
00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
report case counts but we're going to
 
00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
pull in other data that i think is going
 
00:28:15.669 --> 00:28:15.679 align:start position:0%
to be more accurate
 
00:28:17.909 --> 00:28:17.919 align:start position:0%
than the actual counting the number of
 
00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
cases in the state
 
00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
we have told our patients at our center
 
00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
in kingston if you test at home please
 
00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:26.480 align:start position:0%
send us the results we'd like to know
 
00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
it's helpful in our care review
 
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.110 align:start position:0%
it's helpful in our care review
absolutely

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh i want to thank the commissioner the
 
00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
vax van came to our facility in kingston
 
00:28:35.269 --> 00:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
the other day and
 
00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
a combination of what the vaccine people
 
00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
have posted on websites and
 
00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
lots of publicity from me we had a lot
 
00:28:46.149 --> 00:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
of people come it was wonderful
 
00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
people didn't have to come but if they
 
00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to it was right there in our
 
00:28:50.789 --> 00:28:50.799 align:start position:0%
parking lot so thank you our mobile
 
00:28:52.789 --> 00:28:52.799 align:start position:0%
clinics have been very successful across
 
00:28:54.549 --> 00:28:54.559 align:start position:0%
the state probably one of our more
 
00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
successful programs
 
00:28:58.389 --> 00:28:58.399 align:start position:0%
really meeting people where they are
 
00:29:00.149 --> 00:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
getting into vulnerable populations
 
00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
people that don't have you know
 
00:29:03.029 --> 00:29:03.039 align:start position:0%
widespread transportation to get the
 
00:29:05.029 --> 00:29:05.039 align:start position:0%
vaccine sites they've really been quite
 
00:29:06.789 --> 00:29:06.799 align:start position:0%
successful across the state
 
00:29:09.269 --> 00:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
and also especially when the local group
 
00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
that's sponsoring it
 
00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
is a group of people that are trusted by
 
00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
the general population so that well if
 
00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
dr pearson's forward i guess it's okay
 
00:29:20.549 --> 00:29:20.559 align:start position:0%
that really worked well for for my
 
00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
wife's patients i also want to thank you
 
00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
about the increase in caring of mental
 
00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
health the addition to the facility here
 
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
in concord the purchase
 
00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:32.720 align:start position:0%
along the way we hope of hampstead
 
00:29:35.269 --> 00:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
hospital the partnership with portsmouth
 
00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:37.919 align:start position:0%
hospital in a new facility in epping
 
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
it's gotten to the point now when i pick
 
00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
up the union leader in the morning to
 
00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
read it i'm wondering what's next
 
00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
because you're really doing a wonderful
 
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
job and getting more space
 
00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
thank you i think you know we're trying
 
00:29:51.909 --> 00:29:51.919 align:start position:0%
to build out the system of care
 
00:29:53.909 --> 00:29:53.919 align:start position:0%
fairly quickly we've had an er boarding
 
00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
crisis for
 
00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
a decade now and we've spent four years
 
00:29:59.590 --> 00:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
building out community-based services
 
00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
we've launched our cti program today
 
00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
there are rapid response programs crisis
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
services mobile crisis services and you
 
00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
get through the continuum and you get to
 
00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
that kind of that peak which is the most
 
00:30:15.669 --> 00:30:15.679 align:start position:0%
expensive and most acute
 
00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
uh part of the continuum which is the
 
00:30:18.789 --> 00:30:18.799 align:start position:0%
inpatient beds
 
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
and when you look at national studies
 
00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
they'll tell you that
 
00:30:25.029 --> 00:30:25.039 align:start position:0%
inpatient beds per 100 000 should be
 
00:30:25.039 --> 00:30:26.470 align:start position:0%
inpatient beds per 100 000 should be
between

00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:26.480 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
50 and 60 beds per 100 000 of the
 
00:30:31.669 --> 00:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
population new hampshire is currently at
 
00:30:31.679 --> 00:30:33.190 align:start position:0%
population new hampshire is currently at
38

00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:33.200 align:start position:0%
38
 
00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
if we used every bed that we had
 
00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
licensed for example hampstead is
 
00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
licensed for 111 beds they're only at
 
00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:41.350 align:start position:0%
licensed for 111 beds they're only at
45.

00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
45.
 
00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hospitals licensed for 192
 
00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
they're operating around 170. there's a
 
00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
variety of reasons for that
 
00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:49.590 align:start position:0%
variety of reasons for that
so

00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
with the portsmouth deal as we bring
 
00:30:54.149 --> 00:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
that forward that would bring our uh
 
00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
patient bed load up to about 40 per 100
 
00:30:59.750 --> 00:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
000 a second project would bring us up
 
00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
around 44 45 which is still very at the
 
00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:05.200 align:start position:0%
very low part of that threshold is what
 
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
is considered acceptable
 
00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:08.149 align:start position:0%
is considered acceptable
so

00:31:08.149 --> 00:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
we're excited about bringing
 
00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
new beds online to support the people
 
00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
that are in the emergency rooms
 
00:31:16.549 --> 00:31:16.559 align:start position:0%
they are not to replace the robust
 
00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
community-based continuum that we have
 
00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:20.720 align:start position:0%
built for the last four years to help
 
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
support people in the community that's
 
00:31:25.029 --> 00:31:25.039 align:start position:0%
where people belong that's where people
 
00:31:27.029 --> 00:31:27.039 align:start position:0%
should get their first level of care
 
00:31:29.269 --> 00:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
anyways is in the community
 
00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
anyone else with a question senator
 
00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
rosenwald thank you
 
00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
good morning commissioner good morning
 
00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
um a few weeks ago i
 
00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
had some conversations with
 
00:31:44.149 --> 00:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
department staff about
 
00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
the commercial urgent care centers
 
00:31:51.269 --> 00:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
some of them being unwilling to bill
 
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
insurance telling people
 
00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
that their insurance wouldn't cover the
 
00:31:58.470 --> 00:31:58.480 align:start position:0%
testing even though
 
00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:00.070 align:start position:0%
testing even though
um

00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
they had been exposed to someone who had
 
00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
coveted so it should have been covered
 
00:32:10.389 --> 00:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
has that resolved or are we still seeing
 
00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
people who are
 
00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
asked to pay a higher
 
00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:18.310 align:start position:0%
asked to pay a higher
charge-based

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:20.640 align:start position:0%
amount of money versus
 
00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
getting their insurance to cover it
 
00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
i haven't heard specifically about a lot
 
00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
of cases of insurance not covering it
 
00:32:28.789 --> 00:32:28.799 align:start position:0%
we've actually talked to all the
 
00:32:30.389 --> 00:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
insurers who were
 
00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
covering it across the board all testing
 
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
and and vaccination too
 
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
there was some question that as people
 
00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
started get needing testing just to
 
00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
travel and things like that it's not
 
00:32:44.149 --> 00:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
considered medically necessary and i'll
 
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
check with the insurance department to
 
00:32:48.549 --> 00:32:48.559 align:start position:0%
see if that that jump has been made
 
00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
i think you know we have to
 
00:32:52.389 --> 00:32:52.399 align:start position:0%
differentiate the difference between
 
00:32:54.149 --> 00:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:32:56.389 --> 00:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
a testing center that is supported and
 
00:32:58.630 --> 00:32:58.640 align:start position:0%
paid for and funded by the state and
 
00:33:00.389 --> 00:33:00.399 align:start position:0%
going to an urgent care center for an
 
00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
assessment of a respiratory illness
 
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
because they're two very different
 
00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:04.720 align:start position:0%
things when you drive through our
 
00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:06.640 align:start position:0%
testing site even though it's
 
00:33:09.029 --> 00:33:09.039 align:start position:0%
our testing site is being executed by
 
00:33:09.039 --> 00:33:10.389 align:start position:0%
our testing site is being executed by
clearchoicemd

00:33:10.389 --> 00:33:10.399 align:start position:0%
clearchoicemd
 
00:33:12.549 --> 00:33:12.559 align:start position:0%
all of that is paid for by our funds
 
00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
when if you if you drive up to a
 
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
clearchoice md
 
00:33:17.909 --> 00:33:17.919 align:start position:0%
urgent care center
 
00:33:20.389 --> 00:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
apart from our state site and go in they
 
00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:22.640 align:start position:0%
are going to assess you for respiratory
 
00:33:24.549 --> 00:33:24.559 align:start position:0%
illness even if you just walk in saying
 
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
i want to cope a test
 
00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
but by their practice they have to
 
00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
assess your respiratory status so
 
00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
they're going to charge you for an
 
00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
urgent care visit
 
00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
regardless so that's where a lot of
 
00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
people are getting confused they say
 
00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
that they just wanted a koba test
 
00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:43.360 align:start position:0%
and they went to somewhere other than
 
00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
our coveted test sites and they were
 
00:33:47.029 --> 00:33:47.039 align:start position:0%
charged as a visit
 
00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
um so that that has definitely had
 
00:33:50.789 --> 00:33:50.799 align:start position:0%
there's been some confusion in the
 
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
public about that we've tried to
 
00:33:53.909 --> 00:33:53.919 align:start position:0%
streamline that to say if you want to
 
00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
test no cost go to our testing sites if
 
00:33:59.269 --> 00:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
you go to one of the urgent care centers
 
00:34:01.509 --> 00:34:01.519 align:start position:0%
apart from our testing sites there is a
 
00:34:03.029 --> 00:34:03.039 align:start position:0%
possibility that you'll be charged your
 
00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
copay it'll go through your insurance
 
00:34:06.549 --> 00:34:06.559 align:start position:0%
and whether your insurance pays for or
 
00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
not is going to be up to them i can
 
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
check and see if uh if the insurances
 
00:34:12.869 --> 00:34:12.879 align:start position:0%
are still across the board paying for
 
00:34:14.629 --> 00:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
all testing the last conversation i had
 
00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
with them which was several months ago
 
00:34:17.589 --> 00:34:17.599 align:start position:0%
they were across the board paying for
 
00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
everything but i will check in with them
 
00:34:21.669 --> 00:34:21.679 align:start position:0%
again thank you because my understanding
 
00:34:21.679 --> 00:34:23.109 align:start position:0%
again thank you because my understanding
from

00:34:23.109 --> 00:34:23.119 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:34:23.119 --> 00:34:24.230 align:start position:0%
from
um

00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:26.800 align:start position:0%
talking with dr ballard was that the
 
00:34:28.869 --> 00:34:28.879 align:start position:0%
problem was not with the insurance
 
00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:31.919 align:start position:0%
companies it was with
 
00:34:31.919 --> 00:34:33.589 align:start position:0%
companies it was with
the

00:34:33.589 --> 00:34:33.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:34:33.599 --> 00:34:35.669 align:start position:0%
the
for-profit

00:34:35.669 --> 00:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
for-profit
 
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:37.919 align:start position:0%
urgent care centers
 
00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:40.399 align:start position:0%
wrongly telling people their insurance
 
00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
would not cover a medically necessary
 
00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
test okay and they were charging some of
 
00:34:49.589 --> 00:34:49.599 align:start position:0%
them over 200 dollars
 
00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:52.399 align:start position:0%
for a test people could not wait for
 
00:34:56.149 --> 00:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
hours in a line for the free test sites
 
00:34:57.589 --> 00:34:57.599 align:start position:0%
so i'll check in with the urgent care
 
00:34:59.750 --> 00:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
centers too we have two main ones in the
 
00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:00.710 align:start position:0%
centers too we have two main ones in the
state

00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
and then we have our hospital-based ones
 
00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
and it'll be pretty easy to find out
 
00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:35:07.109 --> 00:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
 
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair i think i have
 
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
four different things i'd like to talk
 
00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
about and good seeing you again uh
 
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner um the first one um
 
00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
is a part a and a part b uh i i'm just
 
00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:24.069 align:start position:0%
is a part a and a part b uh i i'm just
curious

00:35:24.069 --> 00:35:24.079 align:start position:0%
curious
 
00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
if any of our our testing and statistics
 
00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
gathering is making a distinction
 
00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
between omicron and other variants
 
00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
and if they're
 
00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
or if we were set up so that the next
 
00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
wave of variant is measured and reported
 
00:35:43.829 --> 00:35:43.839 align:start position:0%
distinctly from omicron and delta could
 
00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
i it's something i could have asked
 
00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
offline but i'm just curious uh what
 
00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
what the precision is yeah so our public
 
00:35:53.109 --> 00:35:53.119 align:start position:0%
health lab does do genome sequencing
 
00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
which can can identify covered variants
 
00:35:57.990 --> 00:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
so they can identify omicron now a lot
 
00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
of our testing sites don't use our
 
00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
public health lab because that's very
 
00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:02.069 align:start position:0%
public health lab because that's very
limited

00:36:02.069 --> 00:36:02.079 align:start position:0%
limited
 
00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
but commercial health labs commercial
 
00:36:07.829 --> 00:36:07.839 align:start position:0%
labs lab core and and those types they
 
00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:10.640 align:start position:0%
are also doing genome sequencing for
 
00:36:14.069 --> 00:36:14.079 align:start position:0%
omicron as is the cdc in most uh most
 
00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
bigger labs so anything that comes to
 
00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
the public health lab which are several
 
00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
hundred a day we do genome sequencing
 
00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
and we have been able to identify
 
00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
omicron in our in our
 
00:36:27.589 --> 00:36:27.599 align:start position:0%
our testing pool um when a new variant
 
00:36:30.069 --> 00:36:30.079 align:start position:0%
comes out usually we are notified by the
 
00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
cdc that there's a variant of concern
 
00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
and uh the cdc is the one that starts
 
00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
testing samples for it before it ever
 
00:36:40.069 --> 00:36:40.079 align:start position:0%
gets to us but yes once a variant is
 
00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
there we can test for it at our public
 
00:36:43.349 --> 00:36:43.359 align:start position:0%
health lab
 
00:36:45.829 --> 00:36:45.839 align:start position:0%
and then are you reporting it distinctly
 
00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
or are you putting all covert together
 
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
as though they're the same we we report
 
00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
the number of variants we have a weekly
 
00:36:55.109 --> 00:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
report that we send out thank you i i
 
00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
have a follow-up on the home testing
 
00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm curious about the accuracy of
 
00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
the testing do do we have a sense of
 
00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
false positive and false negative rates
 
00:37:07.109 --> 00:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
on those um
 
00:37:09.109 --> 00:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
dr ballard can give you all of that
 
00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
information he was on the committee that
 
00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
picked the test and they looked at both
 
00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:16.640 align:start position:0%
the accuracy of the test most antigen
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
tests are about in the same range and
 
00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
ease of use because that also impacts
 
00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
the accuracy of the test so he has all
 
00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
that information i can have him send it
 
00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
to you okay thank you uh mr chairman i
 
00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
have a couple okay so i i think this may
 
00:37:33.349 --> 00:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
be an opportunity for you to brag on
 
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
your department um
 
00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
about a month ago or so uh the joint
 
00:37:39.829 --> 00:37:39.839 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee and the executive
 
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
council authorized some um
 
00:37:43.990 --> 00:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
funding for
 
00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:46.640 align:start position:0%
the booster burst or i forget what the
 
00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:48.640 align:start position:0%
marketing term was for that
 
00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
blitz okay that's so much better than
 
00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
burst i think
 
00:37:55.349 --> 00:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
but um the objective the metric that you
 
00:37:57.510 --> 00:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
established for success i think was 10
 
00:37:59.030 --> 00:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
000 boosters
 
00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
could do you happen to know what
 
00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
what your booster rate is so uh we had
 
00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
two booster blitz during the first
 
00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:08.720 align:start position:0%
booster blitz we were closer to 12 000
 
00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
on that day the second booster blitz
 
00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
which was during the snowstorm we had a
 
00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
storm that morning we were right around
 
00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:17.440 align:start position:0%
9 800. so for the most part we met we
 
00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
met we met our objective that double is
 
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
good double is a good success story
 
00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
um and then
 
00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:26.720 align:start position:0%
uh on the joint fiscal committee
 
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh there was 12 million dollars that was
 
00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
requested to to pi to buy
 
00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
the home test kits that would be sold in
 
00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
the liquor stores
 
00:38:39.829 --> 00:38:39.839 align:start position:0%
and at that point it wasn't clear
 
00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
that the uh
 
00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
process procedures the accounting system
 
00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
was set up so that as as the test kit
 
00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
got set uh sold at the liquor store that
 
00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
that that transaction and that money
 
00:38:57.349 --> 00:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
would be flowing to replace the 12
 
00:38:59.670 --> 00:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
million that we spent up front do you i
 
00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
i'm not asking you if you know right now
 
00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:03.190 align:start position:0%
i'm not asking you if you know right now
but

00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:03.200 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:04.720 align:start position:0%
are you comfortable that we're going to
 
00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
have that under control we we have it we
 
00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
we signed an mou with the liquor
 
00:39:10.069 --> 00:39:10.079 align:start position:0%
commission to have that money flow back
 
00:39:11.829 --> 00:39:11.839 align:start position:0%
into arp and we actually talked about it
 
00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
at the press conference on wednesday
 
00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
that because it's going to flow back in
 
00:39:18.069 --> 00:39:18.079 align:start position:0%
and replace that money that we can
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
continually buy tests you know if we
 
00:39:22.069 --> 00:39:22.079 align:start position:0%
sell the million tests we'll use that
 
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
money that is replaced and buy another
 
00:39:25.349 --> 00:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
million tests
 
00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:27.200 align:start position:0%
so we get to continue
 
00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the supply is there to
 
00:39:31.349 --> 00:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
meet demand
 
00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
one more one okay one last one and this
 
00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
one um it may be something you've never
 
00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
heard about but i had a very agitated
 
00:39:42.069 --> 00:39:42.079 align:start position:0%
school administrator
 
00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
call me and the school administrator
 
00:39:48.069 --> 00:39:48.079 align:start position:0%
said that she had a full-time job being
 
00:39:49.829 --> 00:39:49.839 align:start position:0%
a school administrator before the
 
00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
pandemic and since the pandemic
 
00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:54.310 align:start position:0%
pandemic and since the pandemic
she

00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:54.320 align:start position:0%
she
 
00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:55.589 align:start position:0%
she
spends

00:39:55.589 --> 00:39:55.599 align:start position:0%
spends
 
00:39:58.630 --> 00:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
she says uh literally all her time doing
 
00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
contact tracing
 
00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
and uh so her her frustration was that
 
00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:06.640 align:start position:0%
her other duties weren't being attended
 
00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
to and so she was just asking the
 
00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:10.550 align:start position:0%
to and so she was just asking the
question

00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
is there some money that the department
 
00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
may have to help supplement the manpower
 
00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
to do the contact tracing or
 
00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
or alternatively
 
00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
if this data is not
 
00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
of the value of the cost of collection
 
00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
can we change the collection
 
00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
requirements on school contact tracing i
 
00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you're prepared to speak
 
00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
to that but i wanted to share with you
 
00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:37.750 align:start position:0%
to that but i wanted to share with you
that

00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
i i haven't been
 
00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
i haven't been in that intense a
 
00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
conversation in a while
 
00:40:46.309 --> 00:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
that's exactly the type of data review
 
00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
that i had just spoke about in my update
 
00:40:52.309 --> 00:40:52.319 align:start position:0%
that we're doing what is what is value
 
00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
added with all of the data that we're
 
00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:54.950 align:start position:0%
added with all of the data that we're
collecting

00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
collecting
 
00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
what was value added two years ago isn't
 
00:40:59.030 --> 00:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily value-added today so we're
 
00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
reviewing that now um joint fiscal just
 
00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
passed about a nine million dollar
 
00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
workforce public health workforce cdc
 
00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
money except an expend
 
00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
a good amount of that is money going
 
00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
towards workforce to help the schools
 
00:41:16.069 --> 00:41:16.079 align:start position:0%
during covet
 
00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
seeing if trish is here she's not here
 
00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
public health isn't here she has more
 
00:41:22.069 --> 00:41:22.079 align:start position:0%
details on it but yes that nine million
 
00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
dollars a good amount of that is is
 
00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
going to the communities to help with
 
00:41:28.069 --> 00:41:28.079 align:start position:0%
kobe but we can get you more details on
 
00:41:28.079 --> 00:41:29.030 align:start position:0%
kobe but we can get you more details on
it

00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
thank you so much and thank you mr
 
00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:32.790 align:start position:0%
thank you so much and thank you mr
chairman

00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
anything else for the commissioner
 
00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:47.270 align:start position:0%
anything else for the commissioner
representative

00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
out from the marshall's of new hampshire
 
00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
but but the cdc has reported through
 
00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
banker's hospital review continues to
 
00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
report the state of new hampshire as
 
00:41:57.349 --> 00:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
last among all the states in getting
 
00:41:59.910 --> 00:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
booster doses out of the population that
 
00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:00.829 align:start position:0%
booster doses out of the population that
has

00:42:00.829 --> 00:42:00.839 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
been as is the new term up to date with
 
00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
vaccination um would you like to comment
 
00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
on any efforts the department is making
 
00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
to address this problem because clearly
 
00:42:11.349 --> 00:42:11.359 align:start position:0%
if we're not up to date with
 
00:42:13.589 --> 00:42:13.599 align:start position:0%
vaccinations we're not protected against
 
00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
the current variant
 
00:42:18.069 --> 00:42:18.079 align:start position:0%
yes uh we we agree and we continue to
 
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
message every week for people to get
 
00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
their boosters in addition to booster
 
00:42:24.309 --> 00:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
blitz we have our mobile uh
 
00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
site that's going around to
 
00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
all of our vulnerable populations we
 
00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
have a homebound program we we've just
 
00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
contracted with to deliver booster
 
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
vaccines to the home we have stood up um
 
00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
six plus vaccination sites across the
 
00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:40.720 align:start position:0%
state to do both primary and the booster
 
00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:42.150 align:start position:0%
state to do both primary and the booster
doses

00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:42.160 align:start position:0%
doses
 
00:42:43.589 --> 00:42:43.599 align:start position:0%
we've made we're making vaccines
 
00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
available um and you know that's
 
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
that's our role we have to make it
 
00:42:50.069 --> 00:42:50.079 align:start position:0%
accessible we have to do the public the
 
00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
public campaigning to say this is what
 
00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
you need to do to protect yourself
 
00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:55.109 align:start position:0%
you need to do to protect yourself
um

00:42:55.109 --> 00:42:55.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:57.349 --> 00:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
i haven't seen becker's
 
00:42:58.790 --> 00:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
recently but i'm going to go look at
 
00:43:00.550 --> 00:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
that article
 
00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
i think part of the issue with our
 
00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
booster data is the accuracy of it
 
00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
because we don't have a robust iiis
 
00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
system what was happening is cdc could
 
00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
not distinguish between first dose and
 
00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
third dose so they were repo when you
 
00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
look at their reporting you would see a
 
00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
very high initial vaccination rate very
 
00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:24.640 align:start position:0%
low booster and what the reality is is a
 
00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
lot of those initial vaccinations are
 
00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
actually the boosters and the cdc
 
00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't have that information because we
 
00:43:31.349 --> 00:43:31.359 align:start position:0%
don't report patient specific
 
00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
information to the cdc so a lot of the
 
00:43:36.069 --> 00:43:36.079 align:start position:0%
national data you know
 
00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
you know until we fix that iis can be
 
00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:51.349 align:start position:0%
you know until we fix that iis can be
confusing

00:43:51.349 --> 00:43:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:52.960 align:start position:0%
um yes we
 
00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
actually um are a lot of our fixes for
 
00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
that came forward to both fiscal and gnc
 
00:43:59.430 --> 00:43:59.440 align:start position:0%
in august and september and was tabled
 
00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
for several months before we could even
 
00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
get it off the table to start the
 
00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
process so yes there has been tens of
 
00:44:07.030 --> 00:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars allocated to our
 
00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
state to fix our iis system uh part of
 
00:44:11.109 --> 00:44:11.119 align:start position:0%
the department's challenge is
 
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
shepherding it through the different
 
00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
authorities the elected authorities to
 
00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:22.960 align:start position:0%
representative nelson thank you mr thank
 
00:44:24.309 --> 00:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman
 
00:44:27.190 --> 00:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
my question uh you sort of touched on
 
00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
earlier the numbers that they report on
 
00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
tv seem somewhat inaccurate
 
00:44:37.109 --> 00:44:37.119 align:start position:0%
when they report say 3 000 new cases
 
00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
that does not of just clarification they
 
00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:42.160 align:start position:0%
do not count the home desk but where do
 
00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
they get that number for 3 000 or
 
00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
whatever sure commercial commercial labs
 
00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
and health care providers are obligated
 
00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
to report to public health so we have
 
00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
electronic reporting from our all of our
 
00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
labs across the state and nationally and
 
00:44:57.910 --> 00:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
then all of our health care providers
 
00:45:00.069 --> 00:45:00.079 align:start position:0%
our hospital also electronically reports
 
00:45:03.589 --> 00:45:03.599 align:start position:0%
so that 3000 number which is usually um
 
00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
an incomplete number because we have
 
00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
such a backlog now you know we set up a
 
00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:10.640 align:start position:0%
system to report you know 500 000 cases
 
00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:12.640 align:start position:0%
a day now we're getting 3 000 cases a
 
00:45:15.589 --> 00:45:15.599 align:start position:0%
day so we're backlogged so that 3000
 
00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
number would come from our electronic
 
00:45:19.990 --> 00:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
lab reporting system for all the labs
 
00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
and health care providers across our
 
00:45:25.270 --> 00:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:30.309 --> 00:45:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:33.589 --> 00:45:33.599 align:start position:0%
make it five
 
00:45:35.589 --> 00:45:35.599 align:start position:0%
or you can use up any leftover minutes
 
00:45:37.109 --> 00:45:37.119 align:start position:0%
from representative edwards would you
 
00:45:37.119 --> 00:45:39.030 align:start position:0%
from representative edwards would you
share

00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
share
 
00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:40.160 align:start position:0%

some
 
00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
40 years ago i had a colleague at cook
 
00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
county hospital in chicago
 
00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
china had just opened up to the west
 
00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
and my colleague's wife had traveled to
 
00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
china and returned with a stubborn
 
00:46:57.349 --> 00:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
pulmonary infection
 
00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
it was unusual it was not an infection
 
00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
commonly seen in a cook county it was a
 
00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:04.790 align:start position:0%
commonly seen in a cook county it was a
fungus

00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
fungus
 
00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
it was aspergillus
 
00:47:09.349 --> 00:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
and we had no effective treatment my
 
00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
colleague's wife passed away
 
00:47:13.589 --> 00:47:13.599 align:start position:0%
for me it was a wake-up call
 
00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
i realized that there are infectious
 
00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
agents out there
 
00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
that we do not prophesy
 
00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:22.160 align:start position:0%
and they can be lethal
 
00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
so i began to watch
 
00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
later in about 1990
 
00:47:29.349 --> 00:47:29.359 align:start position:0%
a new book came out by laurie garrett
 
00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
laurie garrett was a journalist for
 
00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
newsday she published a book called the
 
00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
coming plague newly emerging diseases in
 
00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
a world out of balance
 
00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
her thesis was that we were beginning to
 
00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
see not just an epidemic here and there
 
00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
or even an occasional pandemic rather
 
00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
what we were seeing she wrote is waves
 
00:47:54.069 --> 00:47:54.079 align:start position:0%
of infectious disease following in
 
00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
shorter and shorter sequence
 
00:48:00.309 --> 00:48:00.319 align:start position:0%
if you think back you will recall all of
 
00:48:01.829 --> 00:48:01.839 align:start position:0%
the examples
 
00:48:01.839 --> 00:48:04.230 align:start position:0%
the examples
tuberculosis

00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:04.240 align:start position:0%

and now covet
but

00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:48:20.549 --> 00:48:20.559 align:start position:0%
what has caused this continuing series
 
00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
these waves of infection is something
 
00:48:26.309 --> 00:48:26.319 align:start position:0%
that we had not previously anticipated
 
00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
in the course of evolution there has
 
00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
emerged what we might call a rogue
 
00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:35.960 align:start position:0%
plasmid a plasmid is a circle of
 
00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
non-chromosomal rna which carries within
 
00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
it instructions for cell behavior think
 
00:48:44.710 --> 00:48:44.720 align:start position:0%
of this as an operating manual for the
 
00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:45.990 align:start position:0%
of this as an operating manual for the
micro

00:48:45.990 --> 00:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
micro
 
00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
this particular plasmid seems to carry
 
00:48:51.109 --> 00:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
four characteristics
 
00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
rapid replication
 
00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
an internal protein pump which enables a
 
00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
cell to eject foreign proteins such as
 
00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:02.470 align:start position:0%
cell to eject foreign proteins such as
drugs

00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
drugs
 
00:49:04.470 --> 00:49:04.480 align:start position:0%
the ability to aid
 
00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
the human
 
00:49:08.309 --> 00:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
immune system in fact to outwit the
 
00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
human immune system and finally and most
 
00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
terrifying i think the ability to move
 
00:49:18.549 --> 00:49:18.559 align:start position:0%
the plasmid moves not only from species
 
00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
of one kind or another but across phyla
 
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
to move from the bacteria to the viruses
 
00:49:28.309 --> 00:49:28.319 align:start position:0%
to the fungi
 
00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
and to confer the infectious ability on
 
00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
whole new orders
 
00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
of microbes
 
00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
there are numerous
 
00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:40.640 align:start position:0%
alarming examples of this process
 
00:49:44.870 --> 00:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
some blame uh overuse of antibiotics for
 
00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
drug resistance i believe that is true
 
00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:48.630 align:start position:0%
drug resistance i believe that is true
however

00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:48.640 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:49:50.309 --> 00:49:50.319 align:start position:0%
i suspect
 
00:49:52.470 --> 00:49:52.480 align:start position:0%
that the emergence of highly resistant
 
00:49:56.069 --> 00:49:56.079 align:start position:0%
strains of bacteria and viruses is not
 
00:49:59.510 --> 00:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
just over use of antibiotics the
 
00:50:02.630 --> 00:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
microbes are learning to adapt to us
 
00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:06.640 align:start position:0%
and they evolve faster than we can adapt
 
00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
to them
 
00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
if you look at the example of
 
00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:11.829 align:start position:0%
if you look at the example of
tuberculosis

00:50:11.829 --> 00:50:11.839 align:start position:0%
tuberculosis
 
00:50:13.589 --> 00:50:13.599 align:start position:0%
of you who are old enough will remember
 
00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
when selman waxman discovered
 
00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
streptomycin in 1944 we believed that we
 
00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:22.160 align:start position:0%
had a cure for this scourge and that it
 
00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
was over
 
00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
we did not prophesy the evolution of
 
00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:30.160 align:start position:0%
drug-resistant tuberculosis and then
 
00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
multi-drug resistant tuberculosis and
 
00:50:35.589 --> 00:50:35.599 align:start position:0%
now extremely drug-resistant
 
00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
tuberculosis we call it xdrtb extremely
 
00:50:41.829 --> 00:50:41.839 align:start position:0%
drug-resistant tuberculosis
 
00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
this strain is now rampant
 
00:50:47.829 --> 00:50:47.839 align:start position:0%
throughout russia and is spreading
 
00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:50.720 align:start position:0%
westward toward eastern europe
 
00:50:53.190 --> 00:50:53.200 align:start position:0%
laurie garrett then wrote betrayal of
 
00:50:55.349 --> 00:50:55.359 align:start position:0%
trust her second book and in it she
 
00:50:58.630 --> 00:50:58.640 align:start position:0%
examined public health systems worldwide
 
00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
her predictions her prophecies were
 
00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:02.710 align:start position:0%
her predictions her prophecies were
predictable

00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:02.720 align:start position:0%
predictable
 
00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
our current public health systems are so
 
00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:07.430 align:start position:0%
our current public health systems are so
underfunded

00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
underfunded
 
00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:08.950 align:start position:0%

understaffed
 
00:51:12.309 --> 00:51:12.319 align:start position:0%
and forgive me incompetent
 
00:51:15.589 --> 00:51:15.599 align:start position:0%
that they betray our trust that they can
 
00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
safeguard our public health
 
00:51:20.549 --> 00:51:20.559 align:start position:0%
i've taken a close look at the guardians

and incompetent to meet the challenges
 
00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
upon us and it is corrupt
 
00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
here in the united states i've watched
 
00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
i've worked closely for decades with the
 
00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
fda cdc and nih
 
00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
i avoided the fda as it became a
 
00:51:45.829 --> 00:51:45.839 align:start position:0%
creature of the drug industry
 
00:51:49.829 --> 00:51:49.839 align:start position:0%
i resigned from study section at nih
 
00:51:53.109 --> 00:51:53.119 align:start position:0%
when i watched the old boy corruption of
 
00:51:56.069 --> 00:51:56.079 align:start position:0%
investigators who were funding their
 
00:51:56.079 --> 00:51:57.670 align:start position:0%

i've watched the destruction of morale
and

00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
the compromise in the commitment to
 
00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
scientific integrity in favor of
 
00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
political expediency
 
00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
as for our own new hampshire department
 
00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
of health and human services i have
 
00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
worked closely with that department for
 
00:52:21.190 --> 00:52:21.200 align:start position:0%
over 30 years
 
00:52:22.870 --> 00:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
i've done work for them they have done
 
00:52:25.349 --> 00:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
work for me and in all those years i
 
00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
have never not ever found
 
00:52:31.270 --> 00:52:31.280 align:start position:0%
either incompetence nor a whiff of
 
00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
corruption in any member of that

organization not ever
 
00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:38.630 align:start position:0%
organization not ever
however

00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire we do not provide
 
00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
that department with the necessary
 
00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:44.870 align:start position:0%
that department with the necessary
resources

00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
resources
 
00:52:48.630 --> 00:52:48.640 align:start position:0%
to deal with what i am prophesying is
 
00:52:50.549 --> 00:52:50.559 align:start position:0%
coming plagues
 
00:52:55.829 --> 00:52:55.839 align:start position:0%
we are not a poor state but we are cheap

confers on one the privilege of donning
 
00:53:03.430 --> 00:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
the red robe of prophecy mr chairman yes
 
00:53:06.150 --> 00:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
sir you have heard the words of some who
 
00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
bear the burden of those red robes we
 
00:53:12.069 --> 00:53:12.079 align:start position:0%
celebrated martin luther king's birthday
 
00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:14.640 align:start position:0%
just a few days passed
 
00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
some find that burden unbearable
 
00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
and seek escape and prefer to remain
 
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
silent i can no longer remain silent
 
00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
here today i must speak out
 
00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
we did what we could in kovit
 
00:53:33.109 --> 00:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
but we did poorly and we continue to do
 
00:53:33.119 --> 00:53:34.309 align:start position:0%
but we did poorly and we continue to do
poorly

00:53:34.309 --> 00:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
poorly
 
00:53:37.589 --> 00:53:37.599 align:start position:0%
we are unprepared and will be so for the
 
00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
next round of infectious disease
 
00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
we need to be proud of our department of
 
00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
health and human services
 
00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
but we need to do better
 
00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
so what's coming what's down the pike
 
00:53:52.150 --> 00:53:52.160 align:start position:0%
possibly mutations of covid this
 
00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
probably isn't over
 
00:53:56.790 --> 00:53:56.800 align:start position:0%
likely we will see two new variants of
 
00:53:59.589 --> 00:53:59.599 align:start position:0%
avian influenza one coming our way from
 
00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
the middle east and one from china we
 
00:54:04.150 --> 00:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
will see nipa virus
 
00:54:07.270 --> 00:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
most assuredly we will see and we are
 
00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
seeing drug resistant fungi they are
 
00:54:14.549 --> 00:54:14.559 align:start position:0%
here now they are in our hospitals now
 
00:54:17.109 --> 00:54:17.119 align:start position:0%
nobody in the hospitals wants to talk
 
00:54:19.510 --> 00:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
about it but they're here we have drug
 
00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:22.160 align:start position:0%
resistant clostridium difficile this is
 
00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:24.880 align:start position:0%
old news you've already heard about that
 
00:54:26.470 --> 00:54:26.480 align:start position:0%
it is imperative
 
00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:29.680 align:start position:0%
that we find a way to strengthen dhhs to
 
00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
help prepare for what is prophesied we
 
00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
need prevention we need surveillance we
 
00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
need quality data we need the
 
00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
availability of treatment for all
 
00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:43.589 align:start position:0%
availability of treatment for all
so

00:54:43.589 --> 00:54:43.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for listening thank you mr
 
00:54:46.710 --> 00:54:46.720 align:start position:0%
chairman for the privilege thank you
 
00:54:49.030 --> 00:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner for putting up with me i
 
00:54:51.270 --> 00:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
can only hope that new hampshire will
 
00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
find ways to deal with what's coming
 
00:54:54.549 --> 00:54:54.559 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:54:56.230 --> 00:54:56.240 align:start position:0%
as one possessing a doctorate from
 
00:54:58.630 --> 00:54:58.640 align:start position:0%
boston university i am prepared to grant
 
00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
continuing education units to anyone in
 
00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
anything the commissioner might like to
 
00:55:10.150 --> 00:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
do besides nodding
 
00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:16.390 --> 00:55:16.400 align:start position:0%
we're in this together folks
 
00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
yes representative edwards you still
 
00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
have a few minutes left okay so um i
 
00:55:24.630 --> 00:55:24.640 align:start position:0%
just received a great education there
 
00:55:26.309 --> 00:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
and as i'm thinking through that i'm
 
00:55:28.390 --> 00:55:28.400 align:start position:0%
thinking about the military whenever you
 
00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:30.160 align:start position:0%
know somebody brings a problem to the
 
00:55:32.069 --> 00:55:32.079 align:start position:0%
table they're supposed to also bring a
 
00:55:32.079 --> 00:55:33.109 align:start position:0%
table they're supposed to also bring a
solution

00:55:33.109 --> 00:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
solution
 
00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
and i and i and i heard in there
 
00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
um a solution from professor
 
00:55:40.309 --> 00:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
representative salloway
 
00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:42.640 align:start position:0%
that suggested that we needed to build
 
00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
out the public health section of
 
00:55:48.150 --> 00:55:48.160 align:start position:0%
our department
 
00:55:50.789 --> 00:55:50.799 align:start position:0%
do you have any initiatives underway to
 
00:55:50.799 --> 00:55:52.069 align:start position:0%
do you have any initiatives underway to
actively

00:55:52.069 --> 00:55:52.079 align:start position:0%
actively
 
00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
look at the kind of resourcing that
 
00:55:56.950 --> 00:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
would be required to at least begin
 
00:55:59.109 --> 00:55:59.119 align:start position:0%
moving in the direction
 
00:56:01.030 --> 00:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
representative salloway is
 
00:56:03.910 --> 00:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:05.430 --> 00:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
we have the
 
00:56:07.109 --> 00:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
general infrastructure in place for
 
00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
example we have their regional public
 
00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
health networks unfortunately they are
 
00:56:13.190 --> 00:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
dramatically underfunded under resourced
 
00:56:15.109 --> 00:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
uh they're not able to do the work that
 
00:56:16.549 --> 00:56:16.559 align:start position:0%
they're that they're supposed to do now
 
00:56:19.030 --> 00:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
during covid we increased their funding
 
00:56:20.789 --> 00:56:20.799 align:start position:0%
we gave them the resources they went out
 
00:56:22.470 --> 00:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
and ran a lot of our vaccine clinics
 
00:56:24.630 --> 00:56:24.640 align:start position:0%
they did a lot of our testing um they do
 
00:56:26.069 --> 00:56:26.079 align:start position:0%
a lot of our school-based clinics for
 
00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
our kids so they have the ability in and
 
00:56:31.750 --> 00:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
the desire to go out and do the work
 
00:56:33.589 --> 00:56:33.599 align:start position:0%
they do we just don't fund them enough
 
00:56:35.589 --> 00:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
and i think that extends right into the
 
00:56:37.589 --> 00:56:37.599 align:start position:0%
department so our division of public
 
00:56:40.549 --> 00:56:40.559 align:start position:0%
health um when we were at our max of
 
00:56:42.549 --> 00:56:42.559 align:start position:0%
doing contact tracing and when we were
 
00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:44.720 align:start position:0%
trying to um
 
00:56:48.150 --> 00:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
to track kovid in in the communities
 
00:56:50.069 --> 00:56:50.079 align:start position:0%
you know we went from a staff of having
 
00:56:52.549 --> 00:56:52.559 align:start position:0%
10 or 12 investigators to having you
 
00:56:55.990 --> 00:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
know 150 um and we had to get temp staff
 
00:56:58.390 --> 00:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
and national guard staff to help us
 
00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:00.470 align:start position:0%
and national guard staff to help us
so

00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:02.480 align:start position:0%
yes we have the infrastructure and we
 
00:57:04.150 --> 00:57:04.160 align:start position:0%
know what to do
 
00:57:06.549 --> 00:57:06.559 align:start position:0%
but i i i don't think that
 
00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
the funding is there beyond covid right
 
00:57:10.470 --> 00:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
now we're using arp dollars to be able
 
00:57:11.589 --> 00:57:11.599 align:start position:0%
to fund
 
00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
the the work that we do
 
00:57:16.470 --> 00:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
we accept the federal funds that come in
 
00:57:18.390 --> 00:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
that that helps so we have the nine
 
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
million dollar workforce grant which
 
00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
puts people in the community that's
 
00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
where public health needs to be
 
00:57:26.150 --> 00:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
needs to be not the prevention and the
 
00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:27.200 align:start position:0%
fighting needs to happen in the
 
00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
community not on hazen drive and concord
 
00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
we are one unit but we need we need to
 
00:57:33.910 --> 00:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
have our community help our public
 
00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:36.640 align:start position:0%
health workers in our community in our
 
00:57:37.750 --> 00:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
with the people the vulnerable
 
00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:39.030 align:start position:0%
with the people the vulnerable
populations

00:57:39.030 --> 00:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
populations
 
00:57:40.470 --> 00:57:40.480 align:start position:0%
so the
 
00:57:41.910 --> 00:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
the answer is yes we have the
 
00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
infrastructure but we don't have the
 
00:57:46.069 --> 00:57:46.079 align:start position:0%
funding or the resources to stand it up
 
00:57:50.870 --> 00:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:53.349 --> 00:57:53.359 align:start position:0%
one follow-up
 
00:57:55.349 --> 00:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
uh does this feel like a 10 million
 
00:57:56.789 --> 00:57:56.799 align:start position:0%
dollar a year
 
00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
fix or 100 million dollar a year fix
 
00:58:03.910 --> 00:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
what's your instinct on this um i would
 
00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
just put let's put it in the middle
 
00:58:07.270 --> 00:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
there i don't think it's 10 million by
 
00:58:10.710 --> 00:58:10.720 align:start position:0%
any means um i mean we saw how fast
 
00:58:14.069 --> 00:58:14.079 align:start position:0%
we spent money during covid um i i i
 
00:58:15.990 --> 00:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
think we spent you know 100 million
 
00:58:17.829 --> 00:58:17.839 align:start position:0%
dollars in the first six months of covet
 
00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
between ppe and
 
00:58:23.670 --> 00:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
and temp staffing so in normal
 
00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
non-pandemic times it is not 100 million
 
00:58:31.589 --> 00:58:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:34.069 --> 00:58:34.079 align:start position:0%
do you sense we will ever get back to
 
00:58:39.910 --> 00:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
normal times absent any coming pandemic
 
00:58:41.109 --> 00:58:41.119 align:start position:0%
do i think we're going to exit the
 
00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
pandemic yes but i think as as the
 
00:58:46.390 --> 00:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
representative said that um
 
00:58:48.630 --> 00:58:48.640 align:start position:0%
we're always going to be under threat of
 
00:58:50.710 --> 00:58:50.720 align:start position:0%
some kind of public health risk whether
 
00:58:51.589 --> 00:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
it be
 
00:58:54.390 --> 00:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
covid or drug resistant fungi or
 
00:58:56.390 --> 00:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
something like that i think we need to
 
00:58:58.710 --> 00:58:58.720 align:start position:0%
be prepared for that and we've seen that
 
00:59:00.309 --> 00:59:00.319 align:start position:0%
through the years with different
 
00:59:02.789 --> 00:59:02.799 align:start position:0%
respiratory viruses that have
 
00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
made its way through our community not
 
00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:11.190 --> 00:59:11.200 align:start position:0%
being staffed and prepared for it seems
 
00:59:13.910 --> 00:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
to me to be far preferable to a panic oh
 
00:59:16.150 --> 00:59:16.160 align:start position:0%
my gosh do we ever have to ramp up at
 
00:59:18.309 --> 00:59:18.319 align:start position:0%
the next emergency you know i think you
 
00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:20.720 align:start position:0%
know our disease investigators dr daley
 
00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
dr chan um both that worked at public
 
00:59:25.109 --> 00:59:25.119 align:start position:0%
health dr daley has moved on to a
 
00:59:26.950 --> 00:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
national position now but
 
00:59:29.349 --> 00:59:29.359 align:start position:0%
um you know i remember our first days of
 
00:59:30.870 --> 00:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
the pandemic
 
00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
you know sitting down with them and
 
00:59:33.910 --> 00:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
saying this is your world series this is
 
00:59:35.670 --> 00:59:35.680 align:start position:0%
what you've been preparing for your
 
00:59:38.789 --> 00:59:38.799 align:start position:0%
entire professional career and we had
 
00:59:40.630 --> 00:59:40.640 align:start position:0%
very you know they're very competent
 
00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
very very um
 
00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable people our state was very
 
00:59:46.549 --> 00:59:46.559 align:start position:0%
lucky to have their their
 
00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
skill level in our in such a small state
 
00:59:53.349 --> 00:59:53.359 align:start position:0%
and i think they did remarkably well but
 
00:59:55.589 --> 00:59:55.599 align:start position:0%
you're talking about having a dozen
 
00:59:58.150 --> 00:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
people running a pandemic i mean the
 
00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
same people that runs this pandemic are
 
01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
the same people standing up our mental
 
01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:02.880 align:start position:0%

01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:04.960 align:start position:0%
dealing with the sud crisis and same
 
01:00:06.549 --> 01:00:06.559 align:start position:0%
people dealing with you know family
 
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
planning it's all the same people so
 
01:00:11.829 --> 01:00:11.839 align:start position:0%
even the the staff at the department are
 
01:00:15.510 --> 01:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
gonna burn out i i mean there's two two
 
01:00:17.109 --> 01:00:17.119 align:start position:0%
years of
 
01:00:21.109 --> 01:00:21.119 align:start position:0%

01:01:31.349 --> 01:01:31.359 align:start position:0%
vacation postponed i'd like to believe
 
01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:33.599 align:start position:0%
because you wanted to be with us but we
 
01:01:35.349 --> 01:01:35.359 align:start position:0%
know the real reason
 
01:01:38.870 --> 01:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
so we i shared with you all a really big
 
01:01:40.390 --> 01:01:40.400 align:start position:0%
packet um
 
01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
but we're not going to go through all of
 
01:01:45.109 --> 01:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
that today you have a big agenda beyond
 
01:01:47.589 --> 01:01:47.599 align:start position:0%
us what i think we want to just give you
 
01:01:49.829 --> 01:01:49.839 align:start position:0%
some high level information
 
01:01:49.839 --> 01:01:50.950 align:start position:0%
some high level information
on

01:01:50.950 --> 01:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:01:53.589 --> 01:01:53.599 align:start position:0%
the continuous coverage of medicaid but
 
01:01:53.599 --> 01:01:54.789 align:start position:0%
the continuous coverage of medicaid but
also

01:01:54.789 --> 01:01:54.799 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:01:57.109 --> 01:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
how we're handling the end of the
 
01:01:59.430 --> 01:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
continuous um
 
01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
coverage because that's really going to
 
01:02:03.829 --> 01:02:03.839 align:start position:0%
be important to you all all of you on a
 
01:02:06.150 --> 01:02:06.160 align:start position:0%
budgetary employee
 
01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
let me interrupt for one second we've
 
01:02:09.589 --> 01:02:09.599 align:start position:0%
got so many piles of wonderful stuff
 
01:02:11.029 --> 01:02:11.039 align:start position:0%
what does it look like that one that
 
01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
you're holding does it look like this
 
01:02:13.829 --> 01:02:13.839 align:start position:0%
yep we're not and we're not going to
 
01:02:15.349 --> 01:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
walk through it all we're going to skip
 
01:02:17.349 --> 01:02:17.359 align:start position:0%
all over it to confuse everybody thank
 
01:02:19.510 --> 01:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
you but we just want you to be aware of
 
01:02:22.549 --> 01:02:22.559 align:start position:0%
the potential budget impact as well as
 
01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:24.880 align:start position:0%
what we're doing today to help your
 
01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
constituents because we all know that
 
01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
you will probably be hearing from your
 
01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:30.870 align:start position:0%
you will probably be hearing from your
constituents

01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
just on a high level
 
01:02:35.349 --> 01:02:35.359 align:start position:0%
we're really been working with many
 
01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
partners and internally we've been
 
01:02:38.870 --> 01:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
meeting weekly
 
01:02:43.270 --> 01:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
since july of 2020 every friday at 8 15
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
if you need henry or i or our teams we
 
01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
are on a weekly call to talk about what
 
01:02:50.309 --> 01:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
we call the unwind
 
01:02:52.950 --> 01:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
and our goal is to really ensure those
 
01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:54.069 align:start position:0%
and our goal is to really ensure those
that

01:02:54.069 --> 01:02:54.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:02:56.470 --> 01:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
are eligible for medicaid
 
01:02:58.710 --> 01:02:58.720 align:start position:0%
don't have a gap in coverage because if
 
01:03:01.270 --> 01:03:01.280 align:start position:0%
people don't fill out the paperwork and
 
01:03:03.829 --> 01:03:03.839 align:start position:0%
comply with our request they will have a
 
01:03:06.470 --> 01:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
gap in coverage but also transition
 
01:03:09.670 --> 01:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
those who will no longer be eligible
 
01:03:11.589 --> 01:03:11.599 align:start position:0%
to really work with them to transition
 
01:03:14.150 --> 01:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
to them to other coverage
 
01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
and we've we have a lot of partners that
 
01:03:18.150 --> 01:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
we've been working on so henry's going
 
01:03:20.950 --> 01:03:20.960 align:start position:0%
to talk now about the numbers
 
01:03:23.109 --> 01:03:23.119 align:start position:0%
chris before i do that you might want to
 
01:03:25.029 --> 01:03:25.039 align:start position:0%
just speak for a moment
 
01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
make sure everybody knows what we're
 
01:03:28.230 --> 01:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
talking about public health emergency
 
01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
that's a federal declaration started
 
01:03:32.470 --> 01:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
under president trump
 
01:03:34.390 --> 01:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
has been continued
 
01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
under the new administration president
 
01:03:39.270 --> 01:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
biden but basically it's the
 
01:03:41.029 --> 01:03:41.039 align:start position:0%
declaration that allows the federal
 
01:03:43.510 --> 01:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
government to provide additional
 
01:03:45.430 --> 01:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
federal matching percentage which is
 
01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
currently 6.2 percent
 
01:03:50.789 --> 01:03:50.799 align:start position:0%
reduction in what the state share is
 
01:03:50.799 --> 01:03:52.390 align:start position:0%
reduction in what the state share is
and

01:03:52.390 --> 01:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
within the public health emergency
 
01:03:57.349 --> 01:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
the department
 
01:03:59.670 --> 01:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
had the option to sort of scale back
 
01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
what it was doing and maybe you might
 
01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:04.240 align:start position:0%
speak to that sure we we did have the
 
01:04:06.870 --> 01:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
option to scale back some of our work
 
01:04:09.910 --> 01:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
but we never stopped we continued to
 
01:04:13.470 --> 01:04:13.480 align:start position:0%
process applications we continue to do
 
01:04:16.390 --> 01:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
redeterminations as
 
01:04:18.150 --> 01:04:18.160 align:start position:0%
as they were due in
 
01:04:20.309 --> 01:04:20.319 align:start position:0%
in the sense that we wanted to keep
 
01:04:24.510 --> 01:04:24.520 align:start position:0%
people covered even if we did our
 
01:04:26.710 --> 01:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
redeterminations and the person was no
 
01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
longer eligible
 
01:04:31.029 --> 01:04:31.039 align:start position:0%
they continued to be eligible so we
 
01:04:33.829 --> 01:04:33.839 align:start position:0%
never stopped working we continue
 
01:04:36.789 --> 01:04:36.799 align:start position:0%
because we're integrated eligibility so
 
01:04:39.349 --> 01:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
if a family comes in and does their
 
01:04:41.990 --> 01:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
application for snap we immediately look
 
01:04:43.349 --> 01:04:43.359 align:start position:0%
at their
 
01:04:45.349 --> 01:04:45.359 align:start position:0%
data they're providing and try to
 
01:04:47.029 --> 01:04:47.039 align:start position:0%
continue their
 
01:04:49.349 --> 01:04:49.359 align:start position:0%
eligibility for medicaid so we were all
 
01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
systems go and we continue to be doing
 
01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
that as we continue to work
 
01:04:57.029 --> 01:04:57.039 align:start position:0%
through all of this
 
01:04:57.039 --> 01:04:58.150 align:start position:0%
through all of this
so

01:04:58.150 --> 01:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:05:00.150 --> 01:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
i'd like you to in the packet that's
 
01:05:02.150 --> 01:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
been passed out jump out to slide seven
 
01:05:03.430 --> 01:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
because i think this
 
01:05:06.150 --> 01:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
in a in a small picture
 
01:05:10.390 --> 01:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
today the
 
01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
the on slide seven
 
01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:16.799 align:start position:0%
um at the top there just above the two
 
01:05:19.270 --> 01:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
circles the medicaid population as of
 
01:05:23.029 --> 01:05:23.039 align:start position:0%
last week was over 235 000
 
01:05:26.069 --> 01:05:26.079 align:start position:0%
individuals everybody everybody with me
 
01:05:26.079 --> 01:05:27.029 align:start position:0%
individuals everybody everybody with me
um

01:05:27.029 --> 01:05:27.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:29.029 --> 01:05:29.039 align:start position:0%
and what we've shown here are two
 
01:05:31.029 --> 01:05:31.039 align:start position:0%
circles here um
 
01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
they're the important part on the
 
01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
left-hand circle is the
 
01:05:39.109 --> 01:05:39.119 align:start position:0%
86 038 individuals who are at risk of
 
01:05:41.829 --> 01:05:41.839 align:start position:0%
losing coverage
 
01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
and then on the right
 
01:05:44.710 --> 01:05:44.720 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
that broken down into
 
01:05:51.109 --> 01:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
nearly 29 000 people who we know based
 
01:05:52.710 --> 01:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
on information the department has on
 
01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:54.710 align:start position:0%
on information the department has on
hand

01:05:54.710 --> 01:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
hand
 
01:05:56.710 --> 01:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
unless the individual has a change in
 
01:05:58.789 --> 01:05:58.799 align:start position:0%
circumstances that we're not aware of
 
01:06:00.630 --> 01:06:00.640 align:start position:0%
that would lose coverage
 
01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
at the end of the month in which the
 
01:06:05.589 --> 01:06:05.599 align:start position:0%
public health emergency ends and
 
01:06:07.829 --> 01:06:07.839 align:start position:0%
that the population that's on your in
 
01:06:09.109 --> 01:06:09.119 align:start position:0%
your grace
 
01:06:10.309 --> 01:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
spot there
 
01:06:12.549 --> 01:06:12.559 align:start position:0%
we've been working with the insurance
 
01:06:15.829 --> 01:06:15.839 align:start position:0%
department on and the navigators to make
 
01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
sure that they're aware of their options
 
01:06:18.630 --> 01:06:18.640 align:start position:0%
because there's nothing we're going to
 
01:06:20.549 --> 01:06:20.559 align:start position:0%
be able to do
 
01:06:22.150 --> 01:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
if their circumstances aren't different
 
01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
other than that they're going to drop
 
01:06:27.270 --> 01:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
from from medicaid coverage
 
01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:28.630 align:start position:0%
from from medicaid coverage
there's

01:06:28.630 --> 01:06:28.640 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:06:32.309 --> 01:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
on the left hand side of that
 
01:06:35.589 --> 01:06:35.599 align:start position:0%
right hand circle is the 57 000 plus
 
01:06:37.589 --> 01:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
individuals today
 
01:06:39.670 --> 01:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
who are
 
01:06:42.789 --> 01:06:42.799 align:start position:0%
have an overdue redetermination
 
01:06:44.789 --> 01:06:44.799 align:start position:0%
while we continue to do the work and
 
01:06:46.710 --> 01:06:46.720 align:start position:0%
continue to process redeterminations
 
01:06:48.870 --> 01:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
individuals during the public health
 
01:06:51.670 --> 01:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
emergency weren't requ are not required
 
01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:52.390 align:start position:0%
emergency weren't requ are not required
to

01:06:52.390 --> 01:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:06:54.069 --> 01:06:54.079 align:start position:0%
to do it it's a voluntary thing and what
 
01:06:57.190 --> 01:06:57.200 align:start position:0%
we've been messaging is that
 
01:06:58.549 --> 01:06:58.559 align:start position:0%
it's smart
 
01:06:59.750 --> 01:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
if you will
 
01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:00.630 align:start position:0%
if you will
to

01:07:00.630 --> 01:07:00.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:01.829 align:start position:0%
to
um

01:07:01.829 --> 01:07:01.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:03.270 --> 01:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
take the risk
 
01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
out from your your family situation of
 
01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
not having coverage by doing the
 
01:07:09.910 --> 01:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
paperwork that you need to do now
 
01:07:11.990 --> 01:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
because at some point
 
01:07:13.510 --> 01:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
there's going to be
 
01:07:16.390 --> 01:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
a huge influx of people you know that
 
01:07:17.829 --> 01:07:17.839 align:start position:0%
all at once that are going to need our
 
01:07:19.270 --> 01:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
help and what we've been trying to work
 
01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:21.839 align:start position:0%
on for since july of 20 is to spread
 
01:07:24.470 --> 01:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
that work out so we don't have this huge
 
01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
tsunami of individuals needing help all
 
01:07:28.230 --> 01:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
of a sudden and we're not able to
 
01:07:29.589 --> 01:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
respond to that
 
01:07:31.990 --> 01:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
and as chris talked about earlier we've
 
01:07:34.630 --> 01:07:34.640 align:start position:0%
been working with um all sorts of stake
 
01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:35.990 align:start position:0%
been working with um all sorts of stake
stakeholders

01:07:35.990 --> 01:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
stakeholders
 
01:07:39.029 --> 01:07:39.039 align:start position:0%
in um getting them to uh work with the
 
01:07:41.829 --> 01:07:41.839 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries to to to navigate this and
 
01:07:44.789 --> 01:07:44.799 align:start position:0%
it involves for example our mcos it
 
01:07:46.870 --> 01:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
involves the mental health centers
 
01:07:48.870 --> 01:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
federally qualified health centers
 
01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
anyone who has um a relationship under
 
01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
hipaa where they can use information
 
01:07:56.069 --> 01:07:56.079 align:start position:0%
we've actually been providing
 
01:07:59.190 --> 01:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
information to those entities that in a
 
01:08:01.670 --> 01:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
compliant way that allows them to do
 
01:08:03.670 --> 01:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
reach out and most recently the
 
01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:06.390 align:start position:0%
reach out and most recently the
department

01:08:06.390 --> 01:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
has implemented
 
01:08:11.029 --> 01:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
a program where we're making outbound
 
01:08:13.430 --> 01:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
goals to um
 
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
to individuals who are
 
01:08:17.829 --> 01:08:17.839 align:start position:0%
the most at risk the most vulnerable
 
01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:20.239 align:start position:0%
people who are in long-term care and i
 
01:08:21.189 --> 01:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
know you're going to talk a little bit
 
01:08:22.309 --> 01:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
more about that maybe you might want to
 
01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
do that now yeah so um
 
01:08:27.110 --> 01:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
so what we've been doing is because um
 
01:08:30.070 --> 01:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
we actually um through um fiscal
 
01:08:32.870 --> 01:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
committee and and um
 
01:08:36.070 --> 01:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
gopher we had some additional funding um
 
01:08:39.669 --> 01:08:39.679 align:start position:0%
we've been able to add call center staff
 
01:08:42.149 --> 01:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
so that when calls come in
 
01:08:44.309 --> 01:08:44.319 align:start position:0%
they are triaging the calls which has
 
01:08:46.470 --> 01:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
freed up some of our department staff to
 
01:08:49.269 --> 01:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
process applications we've also used
 
01:08:52.309 --> 01:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
those staff to do outbound calling to
 
01:08:54.870 --> 01:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
call some of our individuals that we
 
01:08:58.149 --> 01:08:58.159 align:start position:0%
know are behind on their redetermination
 
01:09:00.229 --> 01:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
and and we consider them to be
 
01:09:02.309 --> 01:09:02.319 align:start position:0%
vulnerable they may be elderly they may
 
01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
be disabled and doing outreach calls and
 
01:09:09.430 --> 01:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
doing those using our family service
 
01:09:12.070 --> 01:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
specialist is when the family service
 
01:09:14.789 --> 01:09:14.799 align:start position:0%
specialist gets the person on the phone
 
01:09:16.470 --> 01:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
many times they can process their
 
01:09:18.550 --> 01:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
redetermination while they have them on
 
01:09:21.269 --> 01:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
the phone so that has been extremely
 
01:09:21.279 --> 01:09:23.269 align:start position:0%
the phone so that has been extremely
successful

01:09:23.269 --> 01:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
successful
 
01:09:26.630 --> 01:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
we've called 87 percent of people on a
 
01:09:30.070 --> 01:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
list and we reached 38 percent of our
 
01:09:33.110 --> 01:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
target population and so we keep on
 
01:09:35.829 --> 01:09:35.839 align:start position:0%
going back to making those phone calls
 
01:09:38.390 --> 01:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
and at the same time we're sharing this
 
01:09:40.789 --> 01:09:40.799 align:start position:0%
information publicly we're doing you
 
01:09:42.950 --> 01:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
know through our social media post
 
01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
working with our stakeholders to say it
 
01:09:48.149 --> 01:09:48.159 align:start position:0%
really is us calling we're calling we
 
01:09:50.070 --> 01:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
want to help you get through this we're
 
01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
doing everything we can to try to help
 
01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
people remain eligible
 
01:09:59.110 --> 01:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
so that as henry said when the end does
 
01:10:01.350 --> 01:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
come which we don't know when that is
 
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
it's you know we are continuing to plan
 
01:10:07.030 --> 01:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
not knowing on when that end date may be
 
01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
to just be better prepared
 
01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:12.550 align:start position:0%
to just be better prepared
so

01:10:12.550 --> 01:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:15.830 --> 01:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
in terms of if you look at slide um
 
01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:16.870 align:start position:0%
in terms of if you look at slide um
eight

01:10:16.870 --> 01:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
eight
 
01:10:18.630 --> 01:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
sort of a breakdown of the
 
01:10:21.669 --> 01:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
population within medicaid over time
 
01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
if kind of look at it from just since
 
01:10:26.070 --> 01:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
the start of the public
 
01:10:28.630 --> 01:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
uh basically the march 18th i believe is
 
01:10:29.590 --> 01:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
when the
 
01:10:32.550 --> 01:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
state of emergency was declared
 
01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
our population has grown by about 57 000
 
01:10:38.790 --> 01:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
individuals enrolled in medicaid
 
01:10:40.229 --> 01:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
we think that
 
01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
and this is an estimate that
 
01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:43.270 align:start position:0%
and this is an estimate that
approximately

01:10:43.270 --> 01:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
approximately
 
01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:44.390 align:start position:0%
approximately
23

01:10:44.390 --> 01:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
23
 
01:10:45.510 --> 01:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:10:48.070 --> 01:10:48.080 align:start position:0%
that extra enrollment are people who are
 
01:10:51.910 --> 01:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
new to medicaid and about 77
 
01:10:54.070 --> 01:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
represents those who are
 
01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
what we call protected status because of
 
01:10:57.510 --> 01:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
the public health emergency with
 
01:10:59.350 --> 01:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
continuous coverage
 
01:11:01.110 --> 01:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
01:11:02.790 --> 01:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
01:11:04.270 --> 01:11:04.280 align:start position:0%
you know we're going to see
 
01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:05.350 align:start position:0%
you know we're going to see
[Music]

01:11:05.350 --> 01:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:11:07.590 --> 01:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
a drop in in the number of people
 
01:11:09.669 --> 01:11:09.679 align:start position:0%
covered by medicaid what we just want to
 
01:11:11.830 --> 01:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
make sure is that's appropriately done
 
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
so so that
 
01:11:15.750 --> 01:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
when you are thinking about this in
 
01:11:17.189 --> 01:11:17.199 align:start position:0%
terms of the constituent calls you might
 
01:11:18.229 --> 01:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
be taking
 
01:11:19.830 --> 01:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
that that we're helping the people that
 
01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
need to be helped and when you're
 
01:11:21.910 --> 01:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
thinking about it from a budget
 
01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
standpoint that we're doing our job in
 
01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
terms of making sure that eligibility is
 
01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:31.750 --> 01:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
and so we take some questions i think at
 
01:11:32.790 --> 01:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
this point
 
01:11:35.189 --> 01:11:35.199 align:start position:0%
yeah i had heard that there was a senate
 
01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
bill that helped
 
01:11:39.910 --> 01:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
people who were in danger of losing
 
01:11:41.990 --> 01:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
coverage um
 
01:11:44.390 --> 01:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
either senator if you know what i'm
 
01:11:47.430 --> 01:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
talking about i'm not quite sure i do
 
01:11:49.430 --> 01:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh you'd have to provide me some more
 
01:11:51.669 --> 01:11:51.679 align:start position:0%
information tonight okay i do not
 
01:11:54.229 --> 01:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
recognize it from what you've said okay
 
01:11:58.709 --> 01:11:58.719 align:start position:0%
the only one i know of is um extending
 
01:11:58.719 --> 01:12:00.390 align:start position:0%
the only one i know of is um extending
postpartum

01:12:00.390 --> 01:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
postpartum
 
01:12:02.790 --> 01:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
yes coverage that could be the one
 
01:12:05.110 --> 01:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
you're thinking of could i ask a
 
01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
question i think so yes yes thank you um
 
01:12:13.030 --> 01:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
of the 57 000 people who are
 
01:12:14.709 --> 01:12:14.719 align:start position:0%
uh overdue
 
01:12:16.149 --> 01:12:16.159 align:start position:0%
on the ready
 
01:12:18.310 --> 01:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
how does the department have an
 
01:12:20.070 --> 01:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
expectation of
 
01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
how many are going to be
 
01:12:26.950 --> 01:12:26.960 align:start position:0%
ineligible i'm trying to get a sense of
 
01:12:30.149 --> 01:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
what you think the total caseload is
 
01:12:34.149 --> 01:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:34.159 --> 01:12:35.430 align:start position:0%
 
reasonably

01:12:35.430 --> 01:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
reasonably
 
01:12:37.750 --> 01:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
you know within the emergency ends but
 
01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:39.430 align:start position:0%
you know within the emergency ends but
separately

01:12:39.430 --> 01:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
separately
 
01:12:41.910 --> 01:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
how many
 
01:12:43.350 --> 01:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
children do you think we're going to
 
01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:45.430 align:start position:0%
children do you think we're going to
lose

01:12:45.430 --> 01:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
lose
 
01:12:48.790 --> 01:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
so we in fact this morning on our 8 15
 
01:12:51.430 --> 01:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
call we're starting an outreach campaign
 
01:12:54.229 --> 01:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
to to start to call families we're
 
01:12:55.750 --> 01:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
starting with the youngest and most
 
01:12:58.149 --> 01:12:58.159 align:start position:0%
vulnerable making outbound calls we did
 
01:13:00.470 --> 01:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
that with the the home with the
 
01:13:03.910 --> 01:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
disabled and the long-term care people
 
01:13:06.310 --> 01:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
it is a concern
 
01:13:08.950 --> 01:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
that those children don't lose coverage
 
01:13:11.669 --> 01:13:11.679 align:start position:0%
in terms of predicting the overall
 
01:13:15.030 --> 01:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
i think that we're going to get back to
 
01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
a somewhat
 
01:13:19.510 --> 01:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
free pre-pandemic level
 
01:13:20.630 --> 01:13:20.640 align:start position:0%
at the end of the public health
 
01:13:22.870 --> 01:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
emergency but it's affected honestly by
 
01:13:25.189 --> 01:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
the federal policies in place
 
01:13:25.930 --> 01:13:25.940 align:start position:0%
for example
 
01:13:25.940 --> 01:13:27.430 align:start position:0%
for example
[Music]

01:13:27.430 --> 01:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:13:28.550 --> 01:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
back in
 
01:13:30.709 --> 01:13:30.719 align:start position:0%
the beginning of 21
 
01:13:33.270 --> 01:13:33.280 align:start position:0%
it was our understanding that
 
01:13:35.910 --> 01:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
um we would be able to use information
 
01:13:37.590 --> 01:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
that we had that was as old as six
 
01:13:38.709 --> 01:13:38.719 align:start position:0%
months to be able to make
 
01:13:41.030 --> 01:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
redeterminations more recently the
 
01:13:43.510 --> 01:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
guidance has changed in in august of
 
01:13:44.630 --> 01:13:44.640 align:start position:0%
this past
 
01:13:46.149 --> 01:13:46.159 align:start position:0%
year that we have to do a
 
01:13:48.630 --> 01:13:48.640 align:start position:0%
redetermination on everybody
 
01:13:49.669 --> 01:13:49.679 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:13:51.430 --> 01:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
and that we can only
 
01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
reduce from coverage with a build back
 
01:13:56.149 --> 01:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
better act which
 
01:13:58.950 --> 01:13:58.960 align:start position:0%
was another potential change
 
01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
in in what we could do that would be
 
01:14:02.870 --> 01:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
limited to how many individuals could be
 
01:14:05.669 --> 01:14:05.679 align:start position:0%
disenrolled in a given month uh to i
 
01:14:07.270 --> 01:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
think 112.
 
01:14:09.510 --> 01:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
right now the buildback better component
 
01:14:10.870 --> 01:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
is not
 
01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
is you know that isn't moving
 
01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:14.960 align:start position:0%
legislatively as it stands right now i
 
01:14:18.470 --> 01:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
think it would take us approximately
 
01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
between three and six months to get back
 
01:14:23.590 --> 01:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
to a normal level it depends on what the
 
01:14:25.830 --> 01:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
runway that we're working on now
 
01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
in terms of all the outbound calls and
 
01:14:29.270 --> 01:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
all the other activities that we're
 
01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:30.229 align:start position:0%
all the other activities that we're
doing

01:14:30.229 --> 01:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
doing
 
01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
and in in addition to that senator um
 
01:14:35.350 --> 01:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
some of those children
 
01:14:38.630 --> 01:14:38.640 align:start position:0%
are eligible for snap and tanf and so we
 
01:14:40.870 --> 01:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
use that opportunity
 
01:14:42.950 --> 01:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
because those are not under continuous
 
01:14:45.669 --> 01:14:45.679 align:start position:0%
eligibility so we use that interaction
 
01:14:47.590 --> 01:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
and that data when we meet with those
 
01:14:50.470 --> 01:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
families to also look at the medicaid um
 
01:14:52.470 --> 01:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
pieces so while we have them to say can
 
01:14:56.149 --> 01:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
we continue to push them out in addition
 
01:14:58.149 --> 01:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
we're working closely
 
01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
with the new hampshire children's trust
 
01:15:02.310 --> 01:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
as the facilitating organization for the
 
01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
family resource centers and providing
 
01:15:07.990 --> 01:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
them as our partners with information
 
01:15:09.669 --> 01:15:09.679 align:start position:0%
showing them how to work with families
 
01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire easy so we're really
 
01:15:12.630 --> 01:15:12.640 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
01:15:15.270 --> 01:15:15.280 align:start position:0%
work with all of the natural community
 
01:15:17.830 --> 01:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
partners as to where people will go and
 
01:15:20.390 --> 01:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
providing them information and our
 
01:15:23.189 --> 01:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
message is really simple please do it
 
01:15:23.199 --> 01:15:24.390 align:start position:0%
message is really simple please do it
now

01:15:24.390 --> 01:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
so that we can keep you um
 
01:15:29.910 --> 01:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
covered because we we don't want people
 
01:15:33.350 --> 01:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
to have a gap um due to the high number
 
01:15:35.350 --> 01:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
of applications and redeterminations
 
01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:36.430 align:start position:0%
of applications and redeterminations
coming

01:15:36.430 --> 01:15:36.440 align:start position:0%
coming
 
01:15:40.550 --> 01:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
in thank you but the tanf case load has
 
01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:41.910 align:start position:0%
in thank you but the tanf case load has
been

01:15:41.910 --> 01:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:43.669 align:start position:0%
been
low

01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
low
 
01:15:45.030 --> 01:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
because of
 
01:15:47.270 --> 01:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
stimulus payments
 
01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:48.310 align:start position:0%
stimulus payments
so

01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:15:50.310 --> 01:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
what is the department doing to
 
01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:52.070 align:start position:0%
what is the department doing to
automatically

01:15:52.070 --> 01:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
automatically
 
01:15:54.149 --> 01:15:54.159 align:start position:0%
re-enroll people who
 
01:15:55.669 --> 01:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
will be
 
01:15:59.590 --> 01:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
eligible as soon as outside sources of
 
01:16:01.669 --> 01:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
we can't automatically enroll people
 
01:16:04.070 --> 01:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
people have to either be eligible or not
 
01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
eligible but we're continuing to work we
 
01:16:09.590 --> 01:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
have a whole page on our website called
 
01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
um you know cove the pandemic unwind and
 
01:16:15.350 --> 01:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
really trying to connect people and i
 
01:16:17.430 --> 01:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
think one of
 
01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:18.390 align:start position:0%
think one of
the

01:16:18.390 --> 01:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:16:20.550 --> 01:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
one of the silver linings of all of this
 
01:16:23.270 --> 01:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
is the increased communication and
 
01:16:25.830 --> 01:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
because we're we're integrated we'll be
 
01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
saying to providers okay we're here
 
01:16:30.229 --> 01:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
talking about medicaid but here's other
 
01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:32.640 align:start position:0%
programs that we need people to continue
 
01:16:35.030 --> 01:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
um to apply for we're working really
 
01:16:37.430 --> 01:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
closely with new hampshire employment
 
01:16:39.910 --> 01:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
security and and their staff um and
 
01:16:42.470 --> 01:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
really just trying to work with
 
01:16:45.270 --> 01:16:45.280 align:start position:0%
everybody who touches a family to
 
01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
provide them with this information
 
01:16:50.790 --> 01:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
final follow-up thank you so
 
01:16:53.270 --> 01:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
going back to my first question
 
01:16:55.350 --> 01:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
does the department
 
01:16:56.950 --> 01:16:56.960 align:start position:0%
i i think you're
 
01:16:59.510 --> 01:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
i inferred that you think we'll get back
 
01:17:04.550 --> 01:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
to a fiscal year 19 case load
 
01:17:05.910 --> 01:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
with about
 
01:17:08.149 --> 01:17:08.159 align:start position:0%
the number of
 
01:17:08.159 --> 01:17:09.430 align:start position:0%
the number of
children

01:17:09.430 --> 01:17:09.440 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:17:10.630 --> 01:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
that could
 
01:17:15.270 --> 01:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:17.110 --> 01:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
i don't have an exact number on on
 
01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
children that i think would be the case
 
01:17:21.030 --> 01:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
but i think you know our enrollment in
 
01:17:23.030 --> 01:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
children has increased during the public
 
01:17:25.110 --> 01:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
health emergency we're certainly going
 
01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:25.910 align:start position:0%
health emergency we're certainly going
to

01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:17:28.709 --> 01:17:28.719 align:start position:0%
make that a very high priority that
 
01:17:30.390 --> 01:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
if there's a child that's eligible that
 
01:17:31.910 --> 01:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
we've we've made
 
01:17:35.189 --> 01:17:35.199 align:start position:0%
multiple attempts to to get to them um
 
01:17:37.030 --> 01:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
but in terms of just the enrollment
 
01:17:39.910 --> 01:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
number if you if you think about um
 
01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:41.990 align:start position:0%
number if you if you think about um
that

01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:17:45.750 --> 01:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
approximately 20 um 23 of the growth in
 
01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:46.950 align:start position:0%
approximately 20 um 23 of the growth in
enrollment

01:17:46.950 --> 01:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
enrollment
 
01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
you know if if that were to stay
 
01:17:51.590 --> 01:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
and nobody were to change we'd probably
 
01:17:54.550 --> 01:17:54.560 align:start position:0%
um end up about 10 000 or so above
 
01:17:59.750 --> 01:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:01.189 --> 01:18:01.199 align:start position:0%
and i think that again it's going to
 
01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
depend on what federal policies are in
 
01:18:05.669 --> 01:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
place in terms of what our flexibilities
 
01:18:08.149 --> 01:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
are if we're limited to for example only
 
01:18:10.390 --> 01:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
disenrolling 1 12 at a time
 
01:18:12.630 --> 01:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
that's going to be a different
 
01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:14.149 align:start position:0%
that's going to be a different
unwind

01:18:14.149 --> 01:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
unwind
 
01:18:16.470 --> 01:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
also just to to mention in addition to
 
01:18:18.709 --> 01:18:18.719 align:start position:0%
the numbers that are here the state of
 
01:18:20.630 --> 01:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire through
 
01:18:22.070 --> 01:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
the public health emerging what we call
 
01:18:24.630 --> 01:18:24.640 align:start position:0%
the covid testing
 
01:18:26.390 --> 01:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
group it's now the covid testing and
 
01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
treatment group there are approximately
 
01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:29.669 align:start position:0%
treatment group there are approximately
um

01:18:29.669 --> 01:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:32.470 --> 01:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
9 000 individuals today who are in that
 
01:18:34.950 --> 01:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
group above this but their coverage
 
01:18:36.630 --> 01:18:36.640 align:start position:0%
automatically ends at the end of the
 
01:18:38.550 --> 01:18:38.560 align:start position:0%
public health emergency if you kind of
 
01:18:40.709 --> 01:18:40.719 align:start position:0%
think about that group it's sort of the
 
01:18:42.229 --> 01:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
public health group in the sense that
 
01:18:44.229 --> 01:18:44.239 align:start position:0%
they're making sure that people are
 
01:18:46.470 --> 01:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
getting tested in treatment and that one
 
01:18:47.750 --> 01:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
was only
 
01:18:49.590 --> 01:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
the only eligibility for that was that
 
01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
you didn't have you're uninsured
 
01:18:54.709 --> 01:18:54.719 align:start position:0%
and so that that group uh
 
01:18:54.719 --> 01:18:55.590 align:start position:0%
and so that that group uh
um

01:18:55.590 --> 01:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:57.590 --> 01:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
more recently is also had access to
 
01:18:58.950 --> 01:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
treatment which is a benefit to
 
01:19:00.149 --> 01:19:00.159 align:start position:0%
everybody when you think about it from a
 
01:19:02.070 --> 01:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
public health standpoint
 
01:19:03.510 --> 01:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
but there's a lot of work to be done
 
01:19:06.470 --> 01:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
here and and it's uh
 
01:19:11.110 --> 01:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:12.790 --> 01:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
doing the mission of taking care of
 
01:19:14.390 --> 01:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
people but it's also the most important
 
01:19:15.910 --> 01:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
thing i think in terms of managing the
 
01:19:19.750 --> 01:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
state budget with respect to medicaid
 
01:19:22.149 --> 01:19:22.159 align:start position:0%
representative edwards uh thank you mr
 
01:19:23.830 --> 01:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
chairman um
 
01:19:26.630 --> 01:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
i i don't remember exactly when i first
 
01:19:29.510 --> 01:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
saw the i.t strategic plan but one of
 
01:19:32.790 --> 01:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
the priorities for early
 
01:19:34.790 --> 01:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
adoption and upgrade
 
01:19:37.990 --> 01:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
of an upgrade was the eligibility
 
01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:39.110 align:start position:0%
of an upgrade was the eligibility
module

01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
module
 
01:19:41.430 --> 01:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
and as i'm listening to you your
 
01:19:42.950 --> 01:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
struggles with
 
01:19:45.990 --> 01:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
trying to process eligibility issues
 
01:19:48.070 --> 01:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
it makes me wonder
 
01:19:51.590 --> 01:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
what the status of that it upgrade is
 
01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
for the eligibility module
 
01:19:56.070 --> 01:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
and if that and if that upgrade's going
 
01:19:58.790 --> 01:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
well if that's going to help you
 
01:20:03.669 --> 01:20:03.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:03.679 --> 01:20:04.630 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:20:04.630 --> 01:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:05.750 align:start position:0%
so
yes

01:20:05.750 --> 01:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:07.510 align:start position:0%
yes
um

01:20:07.510 --> 01:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:09.189 --> 01:20:09.199 align:start position:0%
and we're always looking to make
 
01:20:10.950 --> 01:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
improvements to our new height system
 
01:20:13.030 --> 01:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
because again that is our integrated
 
01:20:16.229 --> 01:20:16.239 align:start position:0%
eligibility system i think um
 
01:20:18.390 --> 01:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
unfortunately because of the public
 
01:20:21.110 --> 01:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
health emergency we've had to do
 
01:20:23.830 --> 01:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
a number of different
 
01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
programs and different services so
 
01:20:29.590 --> 01:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
in an effort to respond to some of the
 
01:20:31.830 --> 01:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
community needs such as like pandemic
 
01:20:35.189 --> 01:20:35.199 align:start position:0%
ebt some of this medicaid unwind some of
 
01:20:35.199 --> 01:20:35.910 align:start position:0%
ebt some of this medicaid unwind some of
our

01:20:35.910 --> 01:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:37.110 align:start position:0%
our
regular

01:20:37.110 --> 01:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
regular
 
01:20:39.750 --> 01:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
work towards enhancing the system has
 
01:20:42.390 --> 01:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
gotten delayed but yet at the same time
 
01:20:44.709 --> 01:20:44.719 align:start position:0%
we're making enhancements all the time
 
01:20:46.709 --> 01:20:46.719 align:start position:0%
because of the public health emergency
 
01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
so we're moving ahead but we still have
 
01:20:53.110 --> 01:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:55.110 --> 01:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
and i guess i would say also too in
 
01:20:58.149 --> 01:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
terms of working with our
 
01:21:00.950 --> 01:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
vendor partner in this respect that
 
01:21:03.510 --> 01:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
what we're able to do um in terms of
 
01:21:05.510 --> 01:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
preparing for this i think
 
01:21:07.910 --> 01:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
i put new hampshire's status up against
 
01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
any other state in terms of um being
 
01:21:12.070 --> 01:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
prepared both to help beneficiaries and
 
01:21:16.790 --> 01:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:24.470 --> 01:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:26.629 --> 01:21:26.639 align:start position:0%
the next agenda item is
 
01:21:28.950 --> 01:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
one that is mine and i'm going to wave
 
01:21:29.990 --> 01:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
it off
 
01:21:32.629 --> 01:21:32.639 align:start position:0%
so that we may devote
 
01:21:34.709 --> 01:21:34.719 align:start position:0%
as much time as we have to the
 
01:21:36.550 --> 01:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
subsequent items
 
01:21:40.390 --> 01:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
designated no excuse me system review
 
01:21:42.870 --> 01:21:42.880 align:start position:0%

01:22:26.149 --> 01:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
i believe we have these
 
01:22:28.629 --> 01:22:28.639 align:start position:0%
that look like this
 
01:23:03.030 --> 01:23:03.040 align:start position:0%

for the record my name is moira o'neill
 
01:23:29.990 --> 01:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
mr chair thank you for having me today
 
01:23:31.990 --> 01:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
to speak on
 
01:23:33.430 --> 01:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
behalf of the office of the child
 
01:23:35.990 --> 01:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
advocate and make comments on
 
01:23:41.270 --> 01:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
our report on the nashua children's home
 
01:23:43.189 --> 01:23:43.199 align:start position:0%
to start with this morning i'd just like
 
01:23:45.270 --> 01:23:45.280 align:start position:0%
to do an outline about
 
01:23:46.709 --> 01:23:46.719 align:start position:0%
the office of the child advocates
 
01:23:46.719 --> 01:23:48.229 align:start position:0%
the office of the child advocates
mandate

01:23:48.229 --> 01:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
01:23:50.310 --> 01:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
the framework under which we conduct
 
01:23:53.350 --> 01:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
reviews our methods of review and then
 
01:23:55.189 --> 01:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
i'll walk you through a very brief
 
01:23:57.110 --> 01:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
summary of the prompting complaints and
 
01:23:59.510 --> 01:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
incidents and subsequent analysis i
 
01:24:01.030 --> 01:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
understand that you've had a copy of
 
01:24:03.189 --> 01:24:03.199 align:start position:0%
this report already so i didn't think i
 
01:24:05.510 --> 01:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
needed to go thoroughly through this
 
01:24:08.149 --> 01:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
it's a 30 page report with responses on
 
01:24:08.159 --> 01:24:08.870 align:start position:0%
it's a 30 page report with responses on
it

01:24:08.870 --> 01:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:24:10.629 --> 01:24:10.639 align:start position:0%
if you prefer at any point that i just
 
01:24:12.550 --> 01:24:12.560 align:start position:0%
answer questions i'm also happy to do
 
01:24:15.990 --> 01:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:17.430 --> 01:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
so the mandate of the office of the
 
01:24:18.870 --> 01:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
child advocate is that we are an
 
01:24:21.350 --> 01:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
independent and impartial state agency
 
01:24:23.350 --> 01:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
statutorily mandated to oversee
 
01:24:25.910 --> 01:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
state-provided and arranged services for
 
01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:26.950 align:start position:0%
state-provided and arranged services for
children

01:24:26.950 --> 01:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:24:29.270 --> 01:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
to assure the protection of their best
 
01:24:31.030 --> 01:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
interests and to promote effective
 
01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:32.470 align:start position:0%
interests and to promote effective
reforms

01:24:32.470 --> 01:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
reforms
 
01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:40.790 --> 01:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
in terms of the framework under which we
 
01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:41.910 align:start position:0%
in terms of the framework under which we
operate

01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
operate
 
01:24:43.910 --> 01:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
you can imagine that independent
 
01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:45.110 align:start position:0%
you can imagine that independent
oversight

01:24:45.110 --> 01:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
of publicly provided services is complex
 
01:24:51.350 --> 01:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
there is plenty of research including my
 
01:24:54.070 --> 01:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
own doctoral study that demonstrates
 
01:24:56.629 --> 01:24:56.639 align:start position:0%
imposing investigations and adversarial
 
01:24:59.189 --> 01:24:59.199 align:start position:0%
relationships are not successful in
 
01:25:01.590 --> 01:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
achieving long-term change
 
01:25:03.270 --> 01:25:03.280 align:start position:0%
the traditional approach to oversight
 
01:25:05.189 --> 01:25:05.199 align:start position:0%
that employs blame and shame that
 
01:25:07.030 --> 01:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
generally results in someone getting
 
01:25:09.430 --> 01:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
fired or a program being shuttered is
 
01:25:11.669 --> 01:25:11.679 align:start position:0%
only a short-term fix
 
01:25:14.070 --> 01:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
there are broad and complex systemic
 
01:25:15.830 --> 01:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
factors that influence individuals and
 
01:25:17.910 --> 01:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
their decision-making when you fire
 
01:25:19.669 --> 01:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
someone the system problems that allowed
 
01:25:22.070 --> 01:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
that person to operate the way they did
 
01:25:24.390 --> 01:25:24.400 align:start position:0%
remains and the problem is not solved
 
01:25:26.229 --> 01:25:26.239 align:start position:0%
and you're left with difficult
 
01:25:28.550 --> 01:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
relationships making it hard to engage
 
01:25:31.590 --> 01:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
folks in change and quality improvements
 
01:25:33.990 --> 01:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
so with that understanding the office of
 
01:25:35.510 --> 01:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
the child advocate has instituted a
 
01:25:38.149 --> 01:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
framework of safety science to conduct
 
01:25:39.910 --> 01:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
our reviews and guide our relationships
 
01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
and oversight
 
01:25:43.990 --> 01:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
safety science is an evaluative science
 
01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
used in safety critical industries like
 
01:25:49.590 --> 01:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
aviation and nuclear power it has no
 
01:25:52.149 --> 01:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
tolerance for error but it holds the
 
01:25:54.790 --> 01:25:54.800 align:start position:0%
system accountable rather than any one
 
01:25:56.870 --> 01:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
individual who's operating in a faulty
 
01:25:56.880 --> 01:25:57.910 align:start position:0%
individual who's operating in a faulty
system

01:25:57.910 --> 01:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:26:00.229 --> 01:26:00.239 align:start position:0%
with safety science we create a safe
 
01:26:02.310 --> 01:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
space where people can comfortably see
 
01:26:04.590 --> 01:26:04.600 align:start position:0%
the value in honesty
 
01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:06.149 align:start position:0%
the value in honesty
self-examination

01:26:06.149 --> 01:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
self-examination
 
01:26:09.270 --> 01:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
and constant learning when people feel
 
01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
safe reviewing actions and events they
 
01:26:14.310 --> 01:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
are more willing to be honest about
 
01:26:16.709 --> 01:26:16.719 align:start position:0%
those events and decisions made
 
01:26:18.550 --> 01:26:18.560 align:start position:0%
in that space people are empowered to
 
01:26:21.510 --> 01:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
problem-solve with long-term solutions
 
01:26:23.430 --> 01:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
it's an approach that actually improves
 
01:26:25.590 --> 01:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
practice in the process
 
01:26:27.669 --> 01:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
so the biggest obstacle to this approach
 
01:26:29.669 --> 01:26:29.679 align:start position:0%
is when people are unable or unwilling
 
01:26:32.229 --> 01:26:32.239 align:start position:0%
to see the value of open honest
 
01:26:34.390 --> 01:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
examination of events
 
01:26:36.709 --> 01:26:36.719 align:start position:0%
taking a defensive tactic to feedback
 
01:26:38.470 --> 01:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
closes doors to opportunities for
 
01:26:40.790 --> 01:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
learning and therefore improvements
 
01:26:42.790 --> 01:26:42.800 align:start position:0%
none of this will work if people don't
 
01:26:45.990 --> 01:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
believe we can always do better
 
01:26:47.350 --> 01:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
so i appreciate your indulgence and
 
01:26:49.510 --> 01:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
letting me explain that framework
 
01:26:51.270 --> 01:26:51.280 align:start position:0%
we're very aware that our approach is
 
01:26:53.030 --> 01:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
different than other forms of oversight
 
01:26:55.030 --> 01:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
such as licensing and special
 
01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:56.629 align:start position:0%
such as licensing and special
investigations

01:26:56.629 --> 01:26:56.639 align:start position:0%
investigations
 
01:26:57.990 --> 01:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
both of which have very different
 
01:27:00.470 --> 01:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
mandates through narrower lenses
 
01:27:02.950 --> 01:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
so the method of our review
 
01:27:04.950 --> 01:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
typically when we receive complaints or
 
01:27:06.790 --> 01:27:06.800 align:start position:0%
we notice trends and incidents that are
 
01:27:09.030 --> 01:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
reported to us is that we wait for
 
01:27:12.229 --> 01:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
systems to play out we hear the goal is
 
01:27:12.239 --> 01:27:12.950 align:start position:0%
systems to play out we hear the goal is
not

01:27:12.950 --> 01:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:27:14.550 --> 01:27:14.560 align:start position:0%
oversight of the program but oversight
 
01:27:16.470 --> 01:27:16.480 align:start position:0%
of the internal mechanisms of system
 
01:27:18.950 --> 01:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
oversight including licensing special
 
01:27:21.910 --> 01:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
investigations and general case work if
 
01:27:23.910 --> 01:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
we observe that processes that are given
 
01:27:26.070 --> 01:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
attention to practice and events
 
01:27:28.470 --> 01:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
thoroughly then we may not see a need to
 
01:27:30.790 --> 01:27:30.800 align:start position:0%
proceed with that with a review
 
01:27:32.950 --> 01:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
our first step is to assess the
 
01:27:35.510 --> 01:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
credibility of complaints this we can do
 
01:27:37.350 --> 01:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
by reviewing immediately available
 
01:27:40.149 --> 01:27:40.159 align:start position:0%
records of cases or investigations we
 
01:27:41.590 --> 01:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
want to be sure that complaints are
 
01:27:44.390 --> 01:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
timely relevant and associated to some
 
01:27:46.550 --> 01:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
established obligation for provision of
 
01:27:49.189 --> 01:27:49.199 align:start position:0%
service or standard of practice
 
01:27:51.669 --> 01:27:51.679 align:start position:0%
sometimes the complainant
 
01:27:53.830 --> 01:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
may appear not credible
 
01:27:55.110 --> 01:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
for example you may hear that
 
01:27:57.030 --> 01:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
complainants are disgruntled former
 
01:27:57.040 --> 01:27:58.390 align:start position:0%
complainants are disgruntled former
employees

01:27:58.390 --> 01:27:58.400 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:28:00.709 --> 01:28:00.719 align:start position:0%
our focus remains on the credibility of
 
01:28:02.310 --> 01:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
the complaint
 
01:28:04.149 --> 01:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
and not the complainant
 
01:28:05.830 --> 01:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
once that's determined and we have
 
01:28:08.310 --> 01:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
concerns and also in the context of our
 
01:28:10.310 --> 01:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
own available resources to conduct a
 
01:28:12.709 --> 01:28:12.719 align:start position:0%
review we may bring the complaints to
 
01:28:15.030 --> 01:28:15.040 align:start position:0%
the program or agency to gauge their
 
01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:16.470 align:start position:0%
the program or agency to gauge their
response

01:28:16.470 --> 01:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
response
 
01:28:18.070 --> 01:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
and assess whether they might not be
 
01:28:19.590 --> 01:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
able to address the complaints
 
01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:21.350 align:start position:0%
able to address the complaints
internally

01:28:21.350 --> 01:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
internally
 
01:28:23.350 --> 01:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
if we find we have to proceed
 
01:28:25.510 --> 01:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
we employed our statutory authority to
 
01:28:27.750 --> 01:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
access information and begin review of
 
01:28:30.229 --> 01:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
all available records policies program
 
01:28:30.239 --> 01:28:31.430 align:start position:0%
all available records policies program
descriptions

01:28:31.430 --> 01:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
descriptions
 
01:28:33.110 --> 01:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
relevant state and federal laws
 
01:28:35.430 --> 01:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
contractual obligations we conduct
 
01:28:37.110 --> 01:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
interviews with relevant parties and
 
01:28:39.270 --> 01:28:39.280 align:start position:0%
experts we visit or observe photos and
 
01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:40.390 align:start position:0%
experts we visit or observe photos and
videos

01:28:40.390 --> 01:28:40.400 align:start position:0%
videos
 
01:28:41.910 --> 01:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
we conduct literature review of
 
01:28:43.990 --> 01:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
standards and practices models of care
 
01:28:45.669 --> 01:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
and outcomes of both
 
01:28:48.229 --> 01:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
um so that gives you an idea of uh the
 
01:28:50.149 --> 01:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
sense or a sense of how we review how
 
01:28:52.470 --> 01:28:52.480 align:start position:0%
we'd conduct a review
 
01:28:54.229 --> 01:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
so before i launch into the details of
 
01:28:55.750 --> 01:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
our review i want to make clear that
 
01:28:57.910 --> 01:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
nashua children's home is not the only
 
01:28:59.590 --> 01:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
residential facility for which the
 
01:29:01.430 --> 01:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
office has received complaints or
 
01:29:03.510 --> 01:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
observed troubling trends in critical
 
01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:05.430 align:start position:0%
observed troubling trends in critical
incidents

01:29:05.430 --> 01:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
incidents
 
01:29:07.350 --> 01:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
please keep in mind we are still a very
 
01:29:09.750 --> 01:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
new agency the first review of any kind
 
01:29:12.229 --> 01:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
is going to stand out it should not be
 
01:29:14.470 --> 01:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
assumed this review is any indicator for
 
01:29:16.470 --> 01:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
measuring comparisons with other
 
01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:18.070 align:start position:0%
measuring comparisons with other
programs

01:29:18.070 --> 01:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:29:19.510 --> 01:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
so the office of the child advocates
 
01:29:21.270 --> 01:29:21.280 align:start position:0%
review of nashua children's home was
 
01:29:24.550 --> 01:29:24.560 align:start position:0%
prompted by two sources of concern
 
01:29:26.310 --> 01:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
we began receiving formal complaints
 
01:29:28.270 --> 01:29:28.280 align:start position:0%
about nashua children's home on march
 
01:29:31.830 --> 01:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
2020 that accumulated to about seven
 
01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:33.189 align:start position:0%
2020 that accumulated to about seven
complaints

01:29:33.189 --> 01:29:33.199 align:start position:0%
complaints
 
01:29:34.790 --> 01:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
i used the word about because in
 
01:29:37.350 --> 01:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
addition to those we examined carefully
 
01:29:39.110 --> 01:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
as we spoke with people and it became
 
01:29:40.470 --> 01:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
known that we were looking at nashua
 
01:29:42.629 --> 01:29:42.639 align:start position:0%
children's home there was a snowball
 
01:29:45.030 --> 01:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
effect of either additional complaints
 
01:29:47.189 --> 01:29:47.199 align:start position:0%
along the same themes or general
 
01:29:49.110 --> 01:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
encouragement to proceed with the review
 
01:29:51.030 --> 01:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
because of ongoing concerns with the
 
01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:52.790 align:start position:0%
because of ongoing concerns with the
facility

01:29:52.790 --> 01:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
facility
 
01:29:55.430 --> 01:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
the second source of concerns were noted
 
01:29:57.350 --> 01:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
trends in the incident reports that the
 
01:30:00.310 --> 01:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
office receives for all facilities in
 
01:30:02.310 --> 01:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
particular as pertain to the use of
 
01:30:05.430 --> 01:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
physical restraints including prone face
 
01:30:07.910 --> 01:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
down physical restraints
 
01:30:09.590 --> 01:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
we followed the process i just shared
 
01:30:11.350 --> 01:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
with you we met with the program
 
01:30:13.510 --> 01:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
director we shared some complaints to
 
01:30:15.430 --> 01:30:15.440 align:start position:0%
determine whether he recognized them as
 
01:30:17.990 --> 01:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
problematic and how he was responding to
 
01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:18.950 align:start position:0%
problematic and how he was responding to
them

01:30:18.950 --> 01:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:30:21.270 --> 01:30:21.280 align:start position:0%
with persistent concerns after speaking
 
01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
with the director we met with the
 
01:30:24.229 --> 01:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
president of the nashville children's
 
01:30:26.149 --> 01:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
home board of directors and subsequently
 
01:30:28.229 --> 01:30:28.239 align:start position:0%
sent a summary of concerns to all board
 
01:30:28.239 --> 01:30:29.590 align:start position:0%
sent a summary of concerns to all board
members

01:30:29.590 --> 01:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
members
 
01:30:31.590 --> 01:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
throughout this process we used themes
 
01:30:33.189 --> 01:30:33.199 align:start position:0%
of concern that emerged from the
 
01:30:35.270 --> 01:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
complaints and incident reports as
 
01:30:37.510 --> 01:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
reflection of a gener general program
 
01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:39.110 align:start position:0%
reflection of a gener general program
culture

01:30:39.110 --> 01:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
culture
 
01:30:41.590 --> 01:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
we asked the question do does this
 
01:30:44.229 --> 01:30:44.239 align:start position:0%
action reflect the program's values and
 
01:30:45.990 --> 01:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
education of staff on the latest
 
01:30:47.830 --> 01:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
knowledge of child development or
 
01:30:49.750 --> 01:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed care
 
01:30:51.590 --> 01:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
we ask do the actions that are subject
 
01:30:53.590 --> 01:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
to the complaints reflect the mission of
 
01:30:55.430 --> 01:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
the organization
 
01:30:57.030 --> 01:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
the response received from the director
 
01:30:59.030 --> 01:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
and the board was mixed
 
01:31:01.189 --> 01:31:01.199 align:start position:0%
we appreciated some change in policy and
 
01:31:03.510 --> 01:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
promises regarding staff training the
 
01:31:05.189 --> 01:31:05.199 align:start position:0%
commitment to pursue accreditation
 
01:31:07.030 --> 01:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
promise that some program changes would
 
01:31:08.470 --> 01:31:08.480 align:start position:0%
be required
 
01:31:09.910 --> 01:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
but we did not get the sense that the
 
01:31:12.070 --> 01:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
program leadership either understood or
 
01:31:13.830 --> 01:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
embraced the deeper meaning of the
 
01:31:17.110 --> 01:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
concerns as they affected children
 
01:31:20.470 --> 01:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
in the meantime in june 2021 nashua
 
01:31:23.110 --> 01:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
children's home signed a contract to
 
01:31:26.550 --> 01:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
provide residential services with dcyf
 
01:31:29.189 --> 01:31:29.199 align:start position:0%
this was a groundbreaking event for new
 
01:31:32.149 --> 01:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
hampshire prior to that moment the state
 
01:31:33.990 --> 01:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
never formally contracted for
 
01:31:36.149 --> 01:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
residential services and therefore was
 
01:31:38.310 --> 01:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
never in a position to hold providers
 
01:31:40.550 --> 01:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
accountable to certain standards or
 
01:31:42.149 --> 01:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
types of care
 
01:31:45.030 --> 01:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
we saw in the contract an opportunity
 
01:31:47.350 --> 01:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
for a good framework for reviewing the
 
01:31:49.830 --> 01:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
concerns from nashua children's home
 
01:31:51.030 --> 01:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
and it turned out that we could
 
01:31:53.110 --> 01:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
categorize complaints and incidents to
 
01:31:55.990 --> 01:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
match requirements in the contract this
 
01:31:57.910 --> 01:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
would give clear path for improvement
 
01:32:00.310 --> 01:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
for going forward
 
01:32:02.229 --> 01:32:02.239 align:start position:0%
and as a reminder the office of child
 
01:32:05.510 --> 01:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
advocate does not have enforcement power
 
01:32:07.669 --> 01:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
we are completely reliant upon the good
 
01:32:10.310 --> 01:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
faith of the department and the program
 
01:32:13.270 --> 01:32:13.280 align:start position:0%
to recognize the value of examination
 
01:32:15.110 --> 01:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
and learning to ensure that the best
 
01:32:17.189 --> 01:32:17.199 align:start position:0%
services are available for children and
 
01:32:18.950 --> 01:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
that services don't further harm
 
01:32:18.960 --> 01:32:20.709 align:start position:0%
that services don't further harm
children

01:32:20.709 --> 01:32:20.719 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:32:23.189 --> 01:32:23.199 align:start position:0%
so there were three major themes that
 
01:32:25.510 --> 01:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
emerged from complaints and incident
 
01:32:25.520 --> 01:32:27.030 align:start position:0%
emerged from complaints and incident
reports

01:32:27.030 --> 01:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
reports
 
01:32:30.229 --> 01:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
they involved trauma-informed care
 
01:32:33.750 --> 01:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
orders of authority and permanency
 
01:32:35.669 --> 01:32:35.679 align:start position:0%
so we reviewed certain
 
01:32:37.430 --> 01:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
nashua children's home practices that
 
01:32:38.950 --> 01:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
were associated with complaints for
 
01:32:41.110 --> 01:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
their negative or adverse impact on the
 
01:32:43.189 --> 01:32:43.199 align:start position:0%
child that they included
 
01:32:45.990 --> 01:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
isolation or removal from community
 
01:32:48.470 --> 01:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
physical restraints and certain staff
 
01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:50.229 align:start position:0%
physical restraints and certain staff
interactions

01:32:50.229 --> 01:32:50.239 align:start position:0%
interactions
 
01:32:51.830 --> 01:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
in examining trends in the use of
 
01:32:53.669 --> 01:32:53.679 align:start position:0%
physical restraints at nashua children's
 
01:32:56.070 --> 01:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
home we noted the practice of isolating
 
01:32:58.470 --> 01:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
children from their peer community that
 
01:33:01.110 --> 01:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
appeared to be an antecedent
 
01:33:03.830 --> 01:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
in incidence of physical restraints
 
01:33:06.950 --> 01:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
as a means of both calming and punishing
 
01:33:08.390 --> 01:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
the national children's home removed
 
01:33:09.910 --> 01:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
children from their peer community to a
 
01:33:12.870 --> 01:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
space referred to as the quiet room
 
01:33:14.790 --> 01:33:14.800 align:start position:0%
they do not report using seclusion
 
01:33:16.629 --> 01:33:16.639 align:start position:0%
because to circumvent the statutory
 
01:33:18.709 --> 01:33:18.719 align:start position:0%
definition of seclusion they post a
 
01:33:21.110 --> 01:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
staff person in a room containing small
 
01:33:23.990 --> 01:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
stalls where children are placed staff
 
01:33:27.430 --> 01:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
refer to this as extended separation
 
01:33:29.669 --> 01:33:29.679 align:start position:0%
the dual purpose of the room may be
 
01:33:32.229 --> 01:33:32.239 align:start position:0%
therapeutically confusing for children
 
01:33:34.149 --> 01:33:34.159 align:start position:0%
one former resident told us children
 
01:33:36.550 --> 01:33:36.560 align:start position:0%
hated the room and that was evident in a
 
01:33:39.910 --> 01:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
random sampling of 54 resident
 
01:33:42.870 --> 01:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
restraint incidents 83 percent of which
 
01:33:45.030 --> 01:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
involved a threat or a move to the quiet
 
01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:46.310 align:start position:0%
involved a threat or a move to the quiet
room

01:33:46.310 --> 01:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
room
 
01:33:47.830 --> 01:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
in addition to trending use of
 
01:33:49.910 --> 01:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
restraints we examined experiences of
 
01:33:52.149 --> 01:33:52.159 align:start position:0%
three children who were restrained one
 
01:33:54.390 --> 01:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
for 80 minutes in a face-down prone
 
01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:56.149 align:start position:0%
for 80 minutes in a face-down prone
position

01:33:56.149 --> 01:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:33:57.910 --> 01:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of the staff interactions that
 
01:33:59.350 --> 01:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
we felt were associated with
 
01:34:02.310 --> 01:34:02.320 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed care
 
01:34:05.350 --> 01:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
a child to we looked at a child being
 
01:34:07.750 --> 01:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
repeatedly told he was just a kid in
 
01:34:10.070 --> 01:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
treatment that no one cared about
 
01:34:11.910 --> 01:34:11.920 align:start position:0%
and another whose image was posted on
 
01:34:14.070 --> 01:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
social media in a demeaning way that may
 
01:34:15.430 --> 01:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
have been referencing the child's
 
01:34:17.430 --> 01:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
medical condition
 
01:34:19.030 --> 01:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
nashua children's home reported the
 
01:34:20.790 --> 01:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
posting was not considered problem
 
01:34:23.350 --> 01:34:23.360 align:start position:0%
because they had no policy at the time
 
01:34:25.270 --> 01:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
against people exposing children's
 
01:34:27.430 --> 01:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
images on social media
 
01:34:29.910 --> 01:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
upon complaints from the staff a policy
 
01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:30.830 align:start position:0%
upon complaints from the staff a policy
was

01:34:30.830 --> 01:34:30.840 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:34:33.189 --> 01:34:33.199 align:start position:0%
established to gauge the program's
 
01:34:34.790 --> 01:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
appreciation for the violation of
 
01:34:36.870 --> 01:34:36.880 align:start position:0%
confidentiality and the potential trauma
 
01:34:39.590 --> 01:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
of public exposure we asked to clarify
 
01:34:41.189 --> 01:34:41.199 align:start position:0%
whether the policy was established
 
01:34:43.590 --> 01:34:43.600 align:start position:0%
because staff complained or because it
 
01:34:45.910 --> 01:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
was the right thing to do we were told
 
01:34:49.030 --> 01:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
it was created because staff complained
 
01:34:50.629 --> 01:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
to all three types of practice
 
01:34:50.639 --> 01:34:51.910 align:start position:0%
to all three types of practice
complaints

01:34:51.910 --> 01:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
complaints
 
01:34:54.470 --> 01:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
involving trauma the facility response
 
01:34:56.629 --> 01:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
seemed to one distract from the lived
 
01:34:59.430 --> 01:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
experience of the child and two dismiss
 
01:35:01.030 --> 01:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
all of what we've learned in the past
 
01:35:03.510 --> 01:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
few decades about the impact of trauma
 
01:35:05.750 --> 01:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
and adverse childhood experiences
 
01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:07.189 align:start position:0%
and adverse childhood experiences
specifically

01:35:07.189 --> 01:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
01:35:10.070 --> 01:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
keeping connected not isolating is the
 
01:35:12.790 --> 01:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
most effective intervention to promote
 
01:35:15.990 --> 01:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
resilience and inspire positive behavior
 
01:35:17.830 --> 01:35:17.840 align:start position:0%
children must feel they are valued as
 
01:35:19.750 --> 01:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
part of a community
 
01:35:22.950 --> 01:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
loss of control in physical restraint
 
01:35:25.109 --> 01:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
exacerbates trauma and is viewed as
 
01:35:27.669 --> 01:35:27.679 align:start position:0%
violence versus problem solving the
 
01:35:30.070 --> 01:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
over-reliance on external control of
 
01:35:33.189 --> 01:35:33.199 align:start position:0%
children precludes success in nurturing
 
01:35:36.229 --> 01:35:36.239 align:start position:0%
internal controls and coping strategies
 
01:35:38.629 --> 01:35:38.639 align:start position:0%
demeaning or making fun of children and
 
01:35:41.189 --> 01:35:41.199 align:start position:0%
their circumstances in general aligns
 
01:35:43.030 --> 01:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
with the american academy of pediatrics
 
01:35:45.350 --> 01:35:45.360 align:start position:0%
definition of emotional maltreatment
 
01:35:47.590 --> 01:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire recently codified as
 
01:35:50.229 --> 01:35:50.239 align:start position:0%
a form of abuse
 
01:35:52.310 --> 01:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
we made the point in the report that
 
01:35:54.390 --> 01:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
understanding the law and acting within
 
01:35:56.870 --> 01:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
its confines is important but that only
 
01:35:59.590 --> 01:35:59.600 align:start position:0%
represents a minimum standard for safety
 
01:36:02.470 --> 01:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
and care not the best practice
 
01:36:05.990 --> 01:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
in 2019 new hampshire addressed that gap
 
01:36:08.390 --> 01:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
by codifying senate bill 14's mandate
 
01:36:10.550 --> 01:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
for all children's behavioral health to
 
01:36:13.750 --> 01:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
be trauma-informed and evidence-based
 
01:36:15.990 --> 01:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
this is a standard that's aligned with
 
01:36:17.669 --> 01:36:17.679 align:start position:0%
the best practice in the best interest
 
01:36:19.590 --> 01:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
of children
 
01:36:22.229 --> 01:36:22.239 align:start position:0%
in terms of complaints around responding
 
01:36:24.950 --> 01:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
to orders from authority there were two
 
01:36:27.270 --> 01:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
orders that the new hampshire that
 
01:36:29.350 --> 01:36:29.360 align:start position:0%
nashua children's home was reported not
 
01:36:31.910 --> 01:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
to have followed one involved a child's
 
01:36:34.149 --> 01:36:34.159 align:start position:0%
access to court appointed primary caring
 
01:36:34.159 --> 01:36:35.350 align:start position:0%
access to court appointed primary caring
adult

01:36:35.350 --> 01:36:35.360 align:start position:0%
adult
 
01:36:37.189 --> 01:36:37.199 align:start position:0%
a primary caring adult is a person who
 
01:36:40.229 --> 01:36:40.239 align:start position:0%
agrees to be involved in a child's life
 
01:36:42.390 --> 01:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
without the caring responsibility
 
01:36:45.430 --> 01:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
there's a rigorous vetting process to
 
01:36:48.149 --> 01:36:48.159 align:start position:0%
approve a pca reflecting the importance
 
01:36:50.390 --> 01:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
of the role and relationship national
 
01:36:51.750 --> 01:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
children's home interfered with the
 
01:36:54.310 --> 01:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
child's access to that pca
 
01:36:56.310 --> 01:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
the second case involved special medical
 
01:36:58.790 --> 01:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
orders that were not followed the very
 
01:37:00.790 --> 01:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
clearly stated
 
01:37:02.950 --> 01:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
the orders said that the child should
 
01:37:05.669 --> 01:37:05.679 align:start position:0%
undertake a daily routine but with
 
01:37:07.750 --> 01:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
purposeful privacy and that the focus
 
01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
was ordered to be on the child's comfort
 
01:37:11.669 --> 01:37:11.679 align:start position:0%
level and not on the outcome of the
 
01:37:13.990 --> 01:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
routine instead it was made into a
 
01:37:15.910 --> 01:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
reporting activity that made the child
 
01:37:17.430 --> 01:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
and at least one other child feel
 
01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:19.350 align:start position:0%
and at least one other child feel
uncomfortable

01:37:19.350 --> 01:37:19.360 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable
 
01:37:21.750 --> 01:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
in both cases the disregard of orders

this week we examined nashville
 
01:38:05.189 --> 01:38:05.199 align:start position:0%
children's homes census data for the
 
01:38:07.830 --> 01:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
current month we saw that of 33 resident
 
01:38:11.189 --> 01:38:11.199 align:start position:0%
children stays ranged from 99 days which
 
01:38:15.109 --> 01:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
is about 3 months to 1 903 days that's
 
01:38:16.550 --> 01:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
five years
 
01:38:18.390 --> 01:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
there are 17 residents who have been at
 
01:38:20.070 --> 01:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
nashua children's home for more than a
 
01:38:22.870 --> 01:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
year nine for more than two years and
 
01:38:24.950 --> 01:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
five for more than three years dr
 
01:38:26.870 --> 01:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
o'neill i'm going to interrupt you now
 
01:38:29.750 --> 01:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
we are very pressed for time here uh
 
01:38:32.310 --> 01:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
would you sum up briefly please we can
 
01:38:33.750 --> 01:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
read all the documents sure and that in
 
01:38:35.910 --> 01:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
that section so so what i was getting at
 
01:38:37.350 --> 01:38:37.360 align:start position:0%
was that in the re
 
01:38:39.750 --> 01:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
there were some interference or reported
 
01:38:42.149 --> 01:38:42.159 align:start position:0%
interference of uh planning and
 
01:38:44.070 --> 01:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
transitioning of children out of the
 
01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:45.669 align:start position:0%
transitioning of children out of the
facility

01:38:45.669 --> 01:38:45.679 align:start position:0%
facility
 
01:38:47.510 --> 01:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
that when we got a response from the
 
01:38:49.750 --> 01:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
facility about that
 
01:38:52.070 --> 01:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
it was notable that the the director
 
01:38:54.070 --> 01:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
felt that children should have stayed
 
01:38:56.149 --> 01:38:56.159 align:start position:0%
longer regardless of what happened to
 
01:38:58.709 --> 01:38:58.719 align:start position:0%
them otherwise which may be other cases
 
01:39:00.550 --> 01:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
that should be brought to us but it sort
 
01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:01.270 align:start position:0%
that should be brought to us but it sort
of

01:39:01.270 --> 01:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:39:04.229 --> 01:39:04.239 align:start position:0%
reflected a feeling that um that there's
 
01:39:05.590 --> 01:39:05.600 align:start position:0%
a belief that children should stay in
 
01:39:07.350 --> 01:39:07.360 align:start position:0%
this facility for a long time which was
 
01:39:09.430 --> 01:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
counter to the contract and also counter
 
01:39:11.189 --> 01:39:11.199 align:start position:0%
to federal law
 
01:39:14.709 --> 01:39:14.719 align:start position:0%
so i just i did give you a graph um
 
01:39:17.510 --> 01:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
this is updated data that does show that
 
01:39:19.990 --> 01:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
there's a slight trend in the use of
 
01:39:22.550 --> 01:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
physical restraint in the facility uh
 
01:39:26.470 --> 01:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
but if you're a if you are a statistical
 
01:39:28.470 --> 01:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
master then you'll notice that while
 
01:39:30.550 --> 01:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
it's significant we can't really explain
 
01:39:32.709 --> 01:39:32.719 align:start position:0%
it as time it may just be that there's a
 
01:39:34.229 --> 01:39:34.239 align:start position:0%
different constellation of children
 
01:39:34.239 --> 01:39:35.189 align:start position:0%
different constellation of children
there

01:39:35.189 --> 01:39:35.199 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:39:37.270 --> 01:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
and also this the graph on the bottom
 
01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:38.709 align:start position:0%
and also this the graph on the bottom
demonstrates

01:39:38.709 --> 01:39:38.719 align:start position:0%
demonstrates
 
01:39:40.550 --> 01:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
the reasons why
 
01:39:42.390 --> 01:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
children are restrained the things that
 
01:39:44.709 --> 01:39:44.719 align:start position:0%
happen prior to the restraint
 
01:39:46.790 --> 01:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
and it appears as though perhaps it's
 
01:39:48.629 --> 01:39:48.639 align:start position:0%
not necessarily
 
01:39:51.430 --> 01:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
as the as the as the organization is
 
01:39:53.750 --> 01:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
starting to report more and document
 
01:39:55.669 --> 01:39:55.679 align:start position:0%
better we're able to see that the
 
01:39:58.470 --> 01:39:58.480 align:start position:0%
reasons for using restraint may not meet
 
01:39:59.830 --> 01:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
the legal
 
01:40:02.310 --> 01:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
legal expectation for restraint which is
 
01:40:05.270 --> 01:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
emergencies in case of self-harm or harm
 
01:40:06.470 --> 01:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
to others
 
01:40:08.310 --> 01:40:08.320 align:start position:0%
in many cases children are just not
 
01:40:09.990 --> 01:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
following rules refusing to go to bed
 
01:40:12.390 --> 01:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
and doing things what most kids do um so
 
01:40:14.870 --> 01:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
i can conclude there um so those were
 
01:40:17.590 --> 01:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
the findings um we we generally were
 
01:40:19.669 --> 01:40:19.679 align:start position:0%
concerned about a culture in the
 
01:40:22.470 --> 01:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
facility that didn't quite get the um
 
01:40:25.430 --> 01:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
the necessary sort of switch and and
 
01:40:28.070 --> 01:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
paradigm switch in in culture that the
 
01:40:30.149 --> 01:40:30.159 align:start position:0%
contract and the federal laws required
 
01:40:32.070 --> 01:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
that we start to look at kids
 
01:40:34.550 --> 01:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
as um as really needing to
 
01:40:36.149 --> 01:40:36.159 align:start position:0%
only have very short stays in
 
01:40:39.510 --> 01:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
residential care um moving out and and
 
01:40:41.750 --> 01:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
being trauma informed and evidence-based
 
01:40:43.270 --> 01:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
so that everything we do for them
 
01:40:45.910 --> 01:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
actually helps them um when we look at
 
01:40:48.790 --> 01:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
kids who leave and the director points
 
01:40:50.070 --> 01:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
to them as
 
01:40:52.070 --> 01:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
their failures being because they left
 
01:40:54.870 --> 01:40:54.880 align:start position:0%
the facility one has to ask the question
 
01:40:56.470 --> 01:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
what treatment was happening to those
 
01:40:58.149 --> 01:40:58.159 align:start position:0%
children while they were there that
 
01:41:00.070 --> 01:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
would prepare them to leave after such
 
01:41:01.830 --> 01:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
long periods of time
 
01:41:03.590 --> 01:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
under the federal law children have to
 
01:41:06.470 --> 01:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
be assessed frequently now um to see
 
01:41:07.990 --> 01:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
whether or not the program is even
 
01:41:10.070 --> 01:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
effective if a child is there for a year
 
01:41:12.229 --> 01:41:12.239 align:start position:0%
or more and still is not able to be safe
 
01:41:13.990 --> 01:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
in the community then then that's not a
 
01:41:16.149 --> 01:41:16.159 align:start position:0%
good match for the program i mean you
 
01:41:17.750 --> 01:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
all stop there and take questions will
 
01:41:20.470 --> 01:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
you take questions
 
01:41:22.229 --> 01:41:22.239 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
01:41:22.239 --> 01:41:23.910 align:start position:0%

mcmahon
 
01:41:26.310 --> 01:41:26.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um ms o'neill just
 
01:41:29.030 --> 01:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh specific to page 16 on the report and
 
01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:29.750 align:start position:0%
uh specific to page 16 on the report and
i

01:41:29.750 --> 01:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:41:30.830 --> 01:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask you what the
 
01:41:32.870 --> 01:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
recommendations you may have on this and
 
01:41:39.189 --> 01:41:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:41.270 --> 01:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
update on what treatments that being
 
01:41:43.669 --> 01:41:43.679 align:start position:0%
taken place or comments on what can take
 
01:41:43.679 --> 01:41:44.629 align:start position:0%
taken place or comments on what can take
place

01:41:44.629 --> 01:41:44.639 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:41:47.430 --> 01:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
when it's referring to it can be quite
 
01:41:48.950 --> 01:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
negative from what i've been reading
 
01:41:50.149 --> 01:41:50.159 align:start position:0%
just so far
 
01:41:52.950 --> 01:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh is is there any recommendation that's
 
01:41:55.750 --> 01:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
being proposed to
 
01:41:58.830 --> 01:41:58.840 align:start position:0%
address social media
 
01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:00.550 align:start position:0%
address social media
um

01:42:00.550 --> 01:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:03.109 --> 01:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
adding being being added out there from
 
01:42:05.189 --> 01:42:05.199 align:start position:0%
patients being handled at this location
 
01:42:06.550 --> 01:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
sure thank you for the question the
 
01:42:08.870 --> 01:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to clarify so um so the so
 
01:42:11.189 --> 01:42:11.199 align:start position:0%
the uh so the nashville children's home
 
01:42:14.310 --> 01:42:14.320 align:start position:0%
did establish a um policy after this
 
01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:15.350 align:start position:0%
did establish a um policy after this
event

01:42:15.350 --> 01:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
event
 
01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
based on staff complaints that would
 
01:42:21.189 --> 01:42:21.199 align:start position:0%
that that prohibits any um
 
01:42:23.350 --> 01:42:23.360 align:start position:0%
exposure of children's images and
 
01:42:25.669 --> 01:42:25.679 align:start position:0%
comments about them on social media
 
01:42:27.669 --> 01:42:27.679 align:start position:0%
we were surprised that it wasn't thought
 
01:42:29.430 --> 01:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
about in terms of hipaa and other
 
01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:30.470 align:start position:0%
about in terms of hipaa and other
federal

01:42:30.470 --> 01:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
federal
 
01:42:32.790 --> 01:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
laws that require confidentiality we
 
01:42:33.990 --> 01:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
have state laws that require
 
01:42:35.430 --> 01:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
confidentiality of children and
 
01:42:36.950 --> 01:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
children's care
 
01:42:39.350 --> 01:42:39.360 align:start position:0%
and and beyond that as i said the the
 
01:42:41.109 --> 01:42:41.119 align:start position:0%
laws around those sorts of things are
 
01:42:43.270 --> 01:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
important but that's a minimum standard
 
01:42:45.750 --> 01:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
really understanding the impact of the
 
01:42:47.990 --> 01:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
effect on the child when they're exposed
 
01:42:50.310 --> 01:42:50.320 align:start position:0%
and and trying to understand a culture
 
01:42:52.790 --> 01:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
that would do that to children and we do
 
01:42:54.550 --> 01:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
see a lot of studies right now looking
 
01:42:56.550 --> 01:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
at how even parents are exposing their
 
01:42:58.070 --> 01:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
kids on social media and the negative
 
01:43:00.070 --> 01:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
effect that it has and the lack of
 
01:43:02.070 --> 01:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
respect that it demonstrates to the
 
01:43:05.189 --> 01:43:05.199 align:start position:0%
safety and well-being of children
 
01:43:05.199 --> 01:43:07.350 align:start position:0%
safety and well-being of children
follow-up

01:43:07.350 --> 01:43:07.360 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:43:09.430 --> 01:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
but just to get a clarification here so
 
01:43:11.270 --> 01:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
i don't misinterpret what's being
 
01:43:13.510 --> 01:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
proposed what's uh stated here it said
 
01:43:15.030 --> 01:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
that this issue was resolved with the
 
01:43:16.790 --> 01:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
advert of policy and training does that
 
01:43:18.470 --> 01:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
mean it's now eliminated as an
 
01:43:20.870 --> 01:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to take place going forward
 
01:43:23.350 --> 01:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
so we are told that there is a policy in
 
01:43:25.669 --> 01:43:25.679 align:start position:0%
place and that that staff have been
 
01:43:27.750 --> 01:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
trained about it we have not received
 
01:43:29.750 --> 01:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
other reports about postings about
 
01:43:31.030 --> 01:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
children at
 
01:43:32.310 --> 01:43:32.320 align:start position:0%
national children's homes so we assume
 
01:43:34.149 --> 01:43:34.159 align:start position:0%
that that problem is resolved
 
01:43:36.310 --> 01:43:36.320 align:start position:0%
there is also an absence of policy in
 
01:43:38.070 --> 01:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
the state level in terms of
 
01:43:40.310 --> 01:43:40.320 align:start position:0%
confidentiality around social media
 
01:43:42.390 --> 01:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
exposure that is probably should be
 
01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:44.709 align:start position:0%
exposure that is probably should be
addressed

01:43:44.709 --> 01:43:44.719 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
01:43:46.870 --> 01:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
it sounds to me like
 
01:43:48.470 --> 01:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
you're saying and i'm trying to condense
 
01:43:50.629 --> 01:43:50.639 align:start position:0%
a lot into a few
 
01:43:53.030 --> 01:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
brief thoughts but you've received
 
01:43:55.430 --> 01:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
complaints about this facility
 
01:43:57.430 --> 01:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
you've investigated the replay
 
01:43:57.440 --> 01:43:58.870 align:start position:0%
you've investigated the replay
complaints

01:43:58.870 --> 01:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
complaints
 
01:44:00.790 --> 01:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
you probably had a chat with a few staff
 
01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:01.830 align:start position:0%
you probably had a chat with a few staff
members

01:44:01.830 --> 01:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
members
 
01:44:04.390 --> 01:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
you did work and you are working to
 
01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:05.750 align:start position:0%
you did work and you are working to
change

01:44:05.750 --> 01:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:44:07.830 --> 01:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
how the system is working but nobody
 
01:44:09.910 --> 01:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
ever needs to be fired
 
01:44:11.270 --> 01:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
is that a good summary of what you've
 
01:44:13.350 --> 01:44:13.360 align:start position:0%
said well i would say that if you if
 
01:44:15.030 --> 01:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
you're looking for someone to fire
 
01:44:16.950 --> 01:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
you're not looking for the problem
 
01:44:18.470 --> 01:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
there certainly are there certainly are
 
01:44:20.390 --> 01:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
times when people need to be fired for
 
01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:21.510 align:start position:0%
times when people need to be fired for
sure

01:44:21.510 --> 01:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:44:23.109 --> 01:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
but generally people don't go to this
 
01:44:24.310 --> 01:44:24.320 align:start position:0%
kind of work with the intention of
 
01:44:26.870 --> 01:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
harming children and and also i would
 
01:44:29.669 --> 01:44:29.679 align:start position:0%
there have been times when um and it's
 
01:44:31.109 --> 01:44:31.119 align:start position:0%
happened at nashua children's home and a
 
01:44:32.709 --> 01:44:32.719 align:start position:0%
couple of other residential programs
 
01:44:32.719 --> 01:44:33.510 align:start position:0%
couple of other residential programs
where

01:44:33.510 --> 01:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:44:35.430 --> 01:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
staff came to work and
 
01:44:37.669 --> 01:44:37.679 align:start position:0%
exposed children to using substances and
 
01:44:39.109 --> 01:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
doing other inappropriate things and
 
01:44:41.350 --> 01:44:41.360 align:start position:0%
they were fired for that but i would
 
01:44:42.870 --> 01:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
argue that there's still a system
 
01:44:44.470 --> 01:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
problem that allowed a person like that
 
01:44:46.709 --> 01:44:46.719 align:start position:0%
to be hired and not supervised and let
 
01:44:48.550 --> 01:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
that happen so there's a there's a
 
01:44:50.470 --> 01:44:50.480 align:start position:0%
systemic problem there that's not
 
01:44:53.990 --> 01:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
resolved just by firing people i see
 
01:44:55.910 --> 01:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
01:44:58.390 --> 01:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
01:45:01.189 --> 01:45:01.199 align:start position:0%
and the chair now calls a bunch of
 
01:45:01.199 --> 01:45:03.030 align:start position:0%

01:45:12.310 --> 01:45:12.320 align:start position:0%
and you'll have to decide amongst
 
01:45:14.870 --> 01:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
yourselves who you would like to
 
01:45:17.109 --> 01:45:17.119 align:start position:0%
a couple of you come up and maybe then
 
01:45:25.990 --> 01:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:27.830 --> 01:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
mr chairman members of the committee my
 
01:45:29.030 --> 01:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
name is david billy i think i'm the
 
01:45:30.709 --> 01:45:30.719 align:start position:0%
executive director of nashua children's
 
01:45:30.719 --> 01:45:32.149 align:start position:0%
executive director of nashua children's
home

01:45:32.149 --> 01:45:32.159 align:start position:0%
home
 
01:45:33.990 --> 01:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
also with me today are our residential
 
01:45:36.149 --> 01:45:36.159 align:start position:0%
director matt fentross who's been with
 
01:45:38.470 --> 01:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
us 13 years and long time board of
 
01:45:41.270 --> 01:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
directors member bill dwyer
 
01:45:43.270 --> 01:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
nashua children's home began as the
 
01:45:45.270 --> 01:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
nashua protest protestant orphanage
 
01:45:47.430 --> 01:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
association in 1903
 
01:45:49.189 --> 01:45:49.199 align:start position:0%
i've had the privilege of serving as its
 
01:45:51.910 --> 01:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
executive director for the past 36 years
 
01:45:53.590 --> 01:45:53.600 align:start position:0%
um one of the things to realize when we
 
01:45:55.189 --> 01:45:55.199 align:start position:0%
talk about and i
 
01:45:57.510 --> 01:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
have a few you know comments on on miss
 
01:45:58.870 --> 01:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
o'neill's report
 
01:46:01.270 --> 01:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
um which i've submitted to you our
 
01:46:03.270 --> 01:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
response you have her response to our
 
01:46:05.109 --> 01:46:05.119 align:start position:0%
response what you don't have is our
 
01:46:06.950 --> 01:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
subsequent response to her response to
 
01:46:08.390 --> 01:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
our response which i want to get into a
 
01:46:09.430 --> 01:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
01:46:12.550 --> 01:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
um but as far as as as permanency goes
 
01:46:14.070 --> 01:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
one of things to realize
 
01:46:15.350 --> 01:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:46:17.590 --> 01:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
we have no legal relationship with the
 
01:46:19.350 --> 01:46:19.360 align:start position:0%
boys and girls placed at nashua
 
01:46:20.950 --> 01:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
children's home
 
01:46:23.669 --> 01:46:23.679 align:start position:0%
we're only their 24-hour caregiver
 
01:46:25.350 --> 01:46:25.360 align:start position:0%
but we are we do not have a legal
 
01:46:27.189 --> 01:46:27.199 align:start position:0%
relationship so as far as their movement
 
01:46:29.590 --> 01:46:29.600 align:start position:0%
towards permanency um that's something
 
01:46:31.830 --> 01:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
that's not uh anywhere nearly entirely
 
01:46:34.709 --> 01:46:34.719 align:start position:0%
in our in our control i i do want i do
 
01:46:36.310 --> 01:46:36.320 align:start position:0%
want to cite um
 
01:46:37.669 --> 01:46:37.679 align:start position:0%
one of the things that miss o'neill
 
01:46:40.950 --> 01:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
spoke to which she references in her
 
01:46:43.030 --> 01:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
response to our response where she says
 
01:46:45.350 --> 01:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
twice in your response you promoted
 
01:46:47.590 --> 01:46:47.600 align:start position:0%
lengthy stays at nch for children which
 
01:46:50.390 --> 01:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
belies an understanding of the federal
 
01:46:52.790 --> 01:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
family first prevention act
 
01:46:54.390 --> 01:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
which you know limits the amount of time
 
01:46:56.790 --> 01:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
children spend in residential facilities
 
01:46:59.030 --> 01:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
if you look at those the specifics of
 
01:47:01.030 --> 01:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
those examples though
 
01:47:03.750 --> 01:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
one example involved one one case
 
01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:04.870 align:start position:0%
one example involved one one case
involved

01:47:04.870 --> 01:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
involved
 
01:47:07.430 --> 01:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
a brother and sister who came to us at
 
01:47:10.229 --> 01:47:10.239 align:start position:0%
the age of six and seven years of age
 
01:47:12.790 --> 01:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
left our facility at the age of nine or
 
01:47:15.510 --> 01:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
eight nine years of age uh went to a
 
01:47:17.910 --> 01:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
foster family that we thought honestly
 
01:47:17.920 --> 01:47:18.709 align:start position:0%
foster family that we thought honestly
was

01:47:18.709 --> 01:47:18.719 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:47:20.390 --> 01:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
ill-equipped in terms of the physical
 
01:47:22.229 --> 01:47:22.239 align:start position:0%
energy to keep up with these two little
 
01:47:25.109 --> 01:47:25.119 align:start position:0%
kids who were a lot honestly
 
01:47:27.590 --> 01:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh three weeks later and we could be so
 
01:47:29.109 --> 01:47:29.119 align:start position:0%
we still though gave that foster family
 
01:47:30.470 --> 01:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of input from the child's
 
01:47:32.950 --> 01:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
therapist from our senior staff
 
01:47:34.470 --> 01:47:34.480 align:start position:0%
from a number of other people those
 
01:47:36.790 --> 01:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
sessions involve the cpsw involved they
 
01:47:39.350 --> 01:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
go to the casa as well
 
01:47:41.109 --> 01:47:41.119 align:start position:0%
three weeks later these are these are
 
01:47:42.629 --> 01:47:42.639 align:start position:0%
two kids that when they were at nashua
 
01:47:43.750 --> 01:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
children's home and they were with us
 
01:47:45.270 --> 01:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
for two years
 
01:47:48.070 --> 01:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
lived on separate boys and girls units
 
01:47:49.430 --> 01:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
but had
 
01:47:53.030 --> 01:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
had visited with each other every single
 
01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:54.070 align:start position:0%
had visited with each other every single
day

01:47:54.070 --> 01:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
day
 
01:47:56.070 --> 01:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
the dad was deceased the mom's rights
 
01:47:58.470 --> 01:47:58.480 align:start position:0%
were terminated as far as family
 
01:48:00.229 --> 01:48:00.239 align:start position:0%
contacts they had each other and that
 
01:48:02.470 --> 01:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
was it and they visited visited with
 
01:48:04.550 --> 01:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
each other every single day they
 
01:48:06.229 --> 01:48:06.239 align:start position:0%
attended charlotte avenue elementary
 
01:48:08.310 --> 01:48:08.320 align:start position:0%
school in nashua they made friends at
 
01:48:10.070 --> 01:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
school they were invited other kids
 
01:48:12.229 --> 01:48:12.239 align:start position:0%
birthday parties at school
 
01:48:14.070 --> 01:48:14.080 align:start position:0%
when the foster placement disrupted
 
01:48:16.070 --> 01:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
after three weeks where they returned to
 
01:48:18.950 --> 01:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
resident nashua children's home no
 
01:48:21.430 --> 01:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
they were placed in separate residential
 
01:48:24.390 --> 01:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
facilities one out of state one in new
 
01:48:26.070 --> 01:48:26.080 align:start position:0%

01:48:31.430 --> 01:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
subsequent 15 months
 
01:48:33.109 --> 01:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
and this comes from the report of the 10
 
01:48:35.109 --> 01:48:35.119 align:start position:0%
year old girl who still calls us from
 
01:48:36.870 --> 01:48:36.880 align:start position:0%

01:48:47.109 --> 01:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
face-to-face contact with each other i
 
01:48:48.149 --> 01:48:48.159 align:start position:0%
really don't think that's what the
 
01:48:50.310 --> 01:48:50.320 align:start position:0%
federal law intends when they talk about
 
01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:52.390 align:start position:0%
federal law intends when they talk about
permanency

01:48:52.390 --> 01:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
permanency
 
01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:53.510 align:start position:0%
permanency
zero

01:48:53.510 --> 01:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
zero
 
01:48:55.669 --> 01:48:55.679 align:start position:0%
contact with each other the second
 
01:48:59.430 --> 01:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
example involves a 17 year old girl
 
01:49:01.910 --> 01:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
who came from a family that had
 
01:49:05.189 --> 01:49:05.199 align:start position:0%
documented sustained substance use
 
01:49:07.270 --> 01:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
she had that herself
 
01:49:08.950 --> 01:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
when she was with us at nashua
 
01:49:10.950 --> 01:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
children's home she was employed at
 
01:49:12.950 --> 01:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
hanford supermarket she gained her
 
01:49:14.390 --> 01:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
driver's license
 
01:49:16.550 --> 01:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
she was educated at a local alternative
 
01:49:18.629 --> 01:49:18.639 align:start position:0%
high school which nashua children's home
 
01:49:20.229 --> 01:49:20.239 align:start position:0%
paid for by the way not her school
 
01:49:21.910 --> 01:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
district nashua children's home funded
 
01:49:23.669 --> 01:49:23.679 align:start position:0%
the enrollment in the in the alternative
 
01:49:24.790 --> 01:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
high school
 
01:49:27.189 --> 01:49:27.199 align:start position:0%
and the plan at that time was to have
 
01:49:29.350 --> 01:49:29.360 align:start position:0%
our transition to our transitional
 
01:49:32.229 --> 01:49:32.239 align:start position:0%
living program which is a program for
 
01:49:33.589 --> 01:49:33.599 align:start position:0%
kids that age out of the child
 
01:49:35.669 --> 01:49:35.679 align:start position:0%
protective and juvenile justice system
 
01:49:37.830 --> 01:49:37.840 align:start position:0%
and can't return home and receive no
 
01:49:39.510 --> 01:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
financial support from their families of
 
01:49:41.589 --> 01:49:41.599 align:start position:0%
origin we provide housing for those
 
01:49:43.750 --> 01:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
young people we provide continuing staff
 
01:49:45.189 --> 01:49:45.199 align:start position:0%
support and guidance for those young
 
01:49:45.199 --> 01:49:46.790 align:start position:0%
support and guidance for those young
people

01:49:46.790 --> 01:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:49:48.390 --> 01:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
at zero cost to the state of new
 
01:49:49.830 --> 01:49:49.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire or the federal government that
 
01:49:51.669 --> 01:49:51.679 align:start position:0%
program is funded almost entirely by
 
01:49:53.750 --> 01:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
private charitable contributions
 
01:49:55.430 --> 01:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
that was the plan
 
01:49:57.750 --> 01:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
with one day's notice she was returned
 
01:49:59.830 --> 01:49:59.840 align:start position:0%
to her biological family
 
01:50:01.589 --> 01:50:01.599 align:start position:0%
after which she became pregnant and
 
01:50:03.750 --> 01:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
dropped out of school again is that the
 
01:50:05.830 --> 01:50:05.840 align:start position:0%
intention of the family's first
 
01:50:08.470 --> 01:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
prevention act i don't think so so those
 
01:50:10.950 --> 01:50:10.960 align:start position:0%
are a couple of the examples um a third
 
01:50:12.790 --> 01:50:12.800 align:start position:0%
one that's not really it's mentioned
 
01:50:14.629 --> 01:50:14.639 align:start position:0%
specifically in miss o'neill's report
 
01:50:16.629 --> 01:50:16.639 align:start position:0%
and i'll comment on it because i mean
 
01:50:19.109 --> 01:50:19.119 align:start position:0%
all of us have seen some of the uh news
 
01:50:20.950 --> 01:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
pieces on the tragedy occurring in
 
01:50:23.030 --> 01:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
manchester with a seven-year-old girl
 
01:50:25.189 --> 01:50:25.199 align:start position:0%
and i know miss o'neill also mentioned
 
01:50:27.589 --> 01:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
kids missing from residential facilities
 
01:50:30.229 --> 01:50:30.239 align:start position:0%
and mentioned the risk that involves
 
01:50:32.149 --> 01:50:32.159 align:start position:0%
that's increasing with kids being
 
01:50:33.910 --> 01:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
sexually trafficked
 
01:50:36.629 --> 01:50:36.639 align:start position:0%
the boy that was physically
 
01:50:39.350 --> 01:50:39.360 align:start position:0%
restrained in our quiet room
 
01:50:40.870 --> 01:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
had a history of being sexually
 
01:50:40.880 --> 01:50:42.790 align:start position:0%
had a history of being sexually
trafficked

01:50:42.790 --> 01:50:42.800 align:start position:0%
trafficked
 
01:50:45.990 --> 01:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
made a move to leave that facility
 
01:50:48.070 --> 01:50:48.080 align:start position:0%
and be on the streets of nashua where he
 
01:50:49.750 --> 01:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
would be at risk again for being
 
01:50:52.229 --> 01:50:52.239 align:start position:0%
sexually trafficked our staff mr
 
01:50:54.149 --> 01:50:54.159 align:start position:0%
fentross being one of them
 
01:50:56.229 --> 01:50:56.239 align:start position:0%
had to make a split-second decision do
 
01:50:58.629 --> 01:50:58.639 align:start position:0%
we allow that kid to leave and be on the
 
01:51:00.950 --> 01:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
streets at great risk to himself or do
 
01:51:02.629 --> 01:51:02.639 align:start position:0%
we stop him from leaving
 
01:51:04.470 --> 01:51:04.480 align:start position:0%
we stopped him from leaving
 
01:51:05.910 --> 01:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
after which we
 
01:51:07.830 --> 01:51:07.840 align:start position:0%
after which followed an eight-month
 
01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:09.589 align:start position:0%
after which followed an eight-month
investigation

01:51:09.589 --> 01:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
01:51:12.070 --> 01:51:12.080 align:start position:0%
investigation conducted quite honestly
 
01:51:13.910 --> 01:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
by people from either their offices or
 
01:51:15.270 --> 01:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
from their living rooms during the
 
01:51:15.280 --> 01:51:16.709 align:start position:0%
from their living rooms during the
pandemic

01:51:16.709 --> 01:51:16.719 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
01:51:18.629 --> 01:51:18.639 align:start position:0%
judging people that show up at nashua
 
01:51:20.470 --> 01:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
children's home every single day
 
01:51:22.390 --> 01:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
during this pandemic and bring their
 
01:51:24.709 --> 01:51:24.719 align:start position:0%
best efforts on on the behalf of
 
01:51:26.229 --> 01:51:26.239 align:start position:0%
of of the boys and girls that we have
 
01:51:26.239 --> 01:51:27.030 align:start position:0%
of of the boys and girls that we have
there

01:51:27.030 --> 01:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:51:28.470 --> 01:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
mr fentroughs will be at nashua
 
01:51:30.149 --> 01:51:30.159 align:start position:0%
children's home 8 o'clock tomorrow
 
01:51:32.149 --> 01:51:32.159 align:start position:0%
morning stay until 11 o'clock at night
 
01:51:34.070 --> 01:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
and remain overnight as well you know
 
01:51:35.589 --> 01:51:35.599 align:start position:0%
and that's one of the difficulties that
 
01:51:37.589 --> 01:51:37.599 align:start position:0%
comes up with this kind of uh with this
 
01:51:39.510 --> 01:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
kind of procedure i i would say that the
 
01:51:39.520 --> 01:51:40.790 align:start position:0%
kind of procedure i i would say that the
report

01:51:40.790 --> 01:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
report
 
01:51:40.800 --> 01:51:42.070 align:start position:0%
report
charitably

01:51:42.070 --> 01:51:42.080 align:start position:0%
charitably
 
01:51:44.310 --> 01:51:44.320 align:start position:0%
is fast and loose with the truth um we
 
01:51:46.709 --> 01:51:46.719 align:start position:0%
know nothing about a kid being told he's
 
01:51:48.550 --> 01:51:48.560 align:start position:0%
just a kid in treatment the difficulty
 
01:51:50.709 --> 01:51:50.719 align:start position:0%
with some of the some of the complaints
 
01:51:52.149 --> 01:51:52.159 align:start position:0%
is that the complaints were never
 
01:51:53.510 --> 01:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
presented to us with sufficient
 
01:51:55.750 --> 01:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
information in order to respond we know
 
01:51:57.990 --> 01:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
nothing of that complaint as far as the
 
01:51:59.669 --> 01:51:59.679 align:start position:0%
social media piece
 
01:52:02.870 --> 01:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
it wasn't the case that the policy was
 
01:52:05.750 --> 01:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
instituted because of staff complaints
 
01:52:08.149 --> 01:52:08.159 align:start position:0%
but once the complaint was brought to us
 
01:52:11.030 --> 01:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
that image was taken down within
 
01:52:14.390 --> 01:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
literally two minutes
 
01:52:15.990 --> 01:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
and then the procedure was it was
 
01:52:17.589 --> 01:52:17.599 align:start position:0%
implemented there's not been another
 
01:52:19.589 --> 01:52:19.599 align:start position:0%
complaint towards that end you know one
 
01:52:21.430 --> 01:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
of the difficulties
 
01:52:23.990 --> 01:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
that um we encounter
 
01:52:27.270 --> 01:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
is that there's a belief from not all
 
01:52:29.589 --> 01:52:29.599 align:start position:0%
you know state workers but a lot of um
 
01:52:31.189 --> 01:52:31.199 align:start position:0%
in the child protective and juvenile
 
01:52:32.629 --> 01:52:32.639 align:start position:0%
justice field
 
01:52:32.639 --> 01:52:33.990 align:start position:0%
justice field
that

01:52:33.990 --> 01:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:52:35.750 --> 01:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
our type of program and i think i speak
 
01:52:38.310 --> 01:52:38.320 align:start position:0%
for all resident residential providers
 
01:52:40.629 --> 01:52:40.639 align:start position:0%
that we're an institution an onerous
 
01:52:42.709 --> 01:52:42.719 align:start position:0%
institution that does not give kids the
 
01:52:45.350 --> 01:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
the love and understanding and care that
 
01:52:47.750 --> 01:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
they that they that they that they need
 
01:52:47.760 --> 01:52:48.790 align:start position:0%
they that they that they that they need
um

01:52:48.790 --> 01:52:48.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:50.149 --> 01:52:50.159 align:start position:0%
couldn't be further from the truth i
 
01:52:51.430 --> 01:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
mean these are people that show up for
 
01:52:53.990 --> 01:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
kids every day love these kids every day
 
01:52:55.589 --> 01:52:55.599 align:start position:0%
i mean there's an effort
 
01:52:57.750 --> 01:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
going on to
 
01:52:59.910 --> 01:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
basically save kids
 
01:53:02.149 --> 01:53:02.159 align:start position:0%
from organizations like ours
 
01:53:02.159 --> 01:53:02.950 align:start position:0%
from organizations like ours
um

01:53:02.950 --> 01:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:04.629 --> 01:53:04.639 align:start position:0%
i think there's a lot of other feedback
 
01:53:06.470 --> 01:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
that could be gleaned from from talking
 
01:53:07.830 --> 01:53:07.840 align:start position:0%
with other people too about their
 
01:53:09.750 --> 01:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
experience at nashua children's home and
 
01:53:09.760 --> 01:53:10.790 align:start position:0%
experience at nashua children's home and
what

01:53:10.790 --> 01:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:53:13.030 --> 01:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
and what they've had um so i think that
 
01:53:14.790 --> 01:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
the report really
 
01:53:17.589 --> 01:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
belies a lack of understanding on some
 
01:53:19.030 --> 01:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
of the rigors
 
01:53:21.189 --> 01:53:21.199 align:start position:0%
of residential group care that we don't
 
01:53:23.830 --> 01:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
just care for individual kids and when
 
01:53:26.870 --> 01:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
we need to sometimes take kids off of
 
01:53:28.870 --> 01:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
their units it's because it's upsetting
 
01:53:30.550 --> 01:53:30.560 align:start position:0%
to the other kids it's disruptive the
 
01:53:32.790 --> 01:53:32.800 align:start position:0%
other kids it's scary to the other kids
 
01:53:35.750 --> 01:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
you know so um we need to respond in a
 
01:53:38.149 --> 01:53:38.159 align:start position:0%
way that that takes into account the
 
01:53:41.510 --> 01:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
sanctity of the group as well um
 
01:53:43.910 --> 01:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
and that people do need to then make
 
01:53:45.830 --> 01:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
make split-second decisions what i would
 
01:53:47.990 --> 01:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
what i would suggest that that that you
 
01:53:49.910 --> 01:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
do and i know i've quoted the report
 
01:53:53.030 --> 01:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
generously is look at the contrast
 
01:53:55.270 --> 01:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
between miss o'neill's report
 
01:53:57.510 --> 01:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
and look at the report that came from
 
01:53:59.430 --> 01:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
carf international the accrediting
 
01:53:59.440 --> 01:54:00.629 align:start position:0%
carf international the accrediting
agency

01:54:00.629 --> 01:54:00.639 align:start position:0%
agency
 
01:54:03.350 --> 01:54:03.360 align:start position:0%
miss o'neill's report was based on
 
01:54:05.990 --> 01:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
complaints that came in
 
01:54:08.229 --> 01:54:08.239 align:start position:0%
from a number of different people was
 
01:54:12.310 --> 01:54:12.320 align:start position:0%
based on an examination of records
 
01:54:15.350 --> 01:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
never came on site talk to me talked to
 
01:54:17.270 --> 01:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
the president of our board of directors
 
01:54:18.870 --> 01:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
talked to no one else associated with
 
01:54:20.629 --> 01:54:20.639 align:start position:0%
nashua children's home
 
01:54:22.950 --> 01:54:22.960 align:start position:0%
carf international's report was based on
 
01:54:25.910 --> 01:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
a surveyor spending three full days in
 
01:54:27.189 --> 01:54:27.199 align:start position:0%
our facility
 
01:54:29.510 --> 01:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
talking with staff talking with kids
 
01:54:31.589 --> 01:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
observing our interactions observing our
 
01:54:31.599 --> 01:54:33.350 align:start position:0%
observing our interactions observing our
culture

01:54:33.350 --> 01:54:33.360 align:start position:0%
culture
 
01:54:36.149 --> 01:54:36.159 align:start position:0%
her report is is clearly stated in the
 
01:54:37.990 --> 01:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
in the information that's been that's
 
01:54:39.669 --> 01:54:39.679 align:start position:0%
been conveyed to you
 
01:54:41.270 --> 01:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
so i mean i would suggest that you look
 
01:54:43.189 --> 01:54:43.199 align:start position:0%
at the contrast in those
 
01:54:44.950 --> 01:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
in those reports as well
 
01:54:44.960 --> 01:54:45.990 align:start position:0%
in those reports as well
um

01:54:45.990 --> 01:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:47.910 --> 01:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
so i think that with uh
 
01:54:50.629 --> 01:54:50.639 align:start position:0%
with that um i mean if you look if you
 
01:54:51.669 --> 01:54:51.679 align:start position:0%
look at
 
01:54:51.679 --> 01:54:52.550 align:start position:0%
look at
um

01:54:52.550 --> 01:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:55.270 --> 01:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
when we make recommendations on what's
 
01:54:57.189 --> 01:54:57.199 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of kids we're not
 
01:54:59.750 --> 01:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily looking at
 
01:55:02.229 --> 01:55:02.239 align:start position:0%
some of the statistical information or
 
01:55:05.189 --> 01:55:05.199 align:start position:0%
looking to see how many kids that we are
 
01:55:07.109 --> 01:55:07.119 align:start position:0%
able to transition to
 
01:55:07.119 --> 01:55:08.149 align:start position:0%
able to transition to
um

01:55:08.149 --> 01:55:08.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:10.629 --> 01:55:10.639 align:start position:0%
to less alternative settings to less
 
01:55:12.470 --> 01:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
intensive settings we're making
 
01:55:15.270 --> 01:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
recommendations based on what we think
 
01:55:17.589 --> 01:55:17.599 align:start position:0%
will result in the best interest of that
 
01:55:19.430 --> 01:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
kid what will
 
01:55:21.589 --> 01:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
what will result in them having the most
 
01:55:23.750 --> 01:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
productive adult life so making our
 
01:55:26.550 --> 01:55:26.560 align:start position:0%
recommendations based on that specific
 
01:55:28.390 --> 01:55:28.400 align:start position:0%
kid's best interest
 
01:55:30.950 --> 01:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
not looking to fill um any type of
 
01:55:33.430 --> 01:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
statistical aggregate
 
01:55:36.470 --> 01:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
um in with that i think i'll uh
 
01:55:38.310 --> 01:55:38.320 align:start position:0%
close my comments and take any questions
 
01:55:39.589 --> 01:55:39.599 align:start position:0%
that you might have
 
01:55:42.870 --> 01:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:44.470 --> 01:55:44.480 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
01:55:48.149 --> 01:55:48.159 align:start position:0%
taking my questions i um i've been at
 
01:55:51.669 --> 01:55:51.679 align:start position:0%
your facility uh i've walked through and
 
01:55:51.679 --> 01:55:52.950 align:start position:0%
your facility uh i've walked through and
uh

01:55:52.950 --> 01:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:55:55.109 --> 01:55:55.119 align:start position:0%
i was left with the impression
 
01:55:58.070 --> 01:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
that you have a lot of young energy and
 
01:56:01.669 --> 01:56:01.679 align:start position:0%
lives in there who are coming from
 
01:56:04.310 --> 01:56:04.320 align:start position:0%
largely dysfunctional situations
 
01:56:05.990 --> 01:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
and it's very difficult it's a very
 
01:56:09.270 --> 01:56:09.280 align:start position:0%
difficult role that you you play and so
 
01:56:10.629 --> 01:56:10.639 align:start position:0%
i just
 
01:56:12.390 --> 01:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
you've been leading that organization
 
01:56:15.910 --> 01:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
for what 37 years 36 years yes yeah so
 
01:56:17.910 --> 01:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
other than your choice in football teams
 
01:56:20.470 --> 01:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
i i have a lot to commend you for that
 
01:56:23.030 --> 01:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
but um i would like to
 
01:56:23.040 --> 01:56:23.910 align:start position:0%
but um i would like to
um

01:56:23.910 --> 01:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:26.390 --> 01:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
go back to the first
 
01:56:28.870 --> 01:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
example you gave us of the nine and the
 
01:56:31.109 --> 01:56:31.119 align:start position:0%
eight-year-old yes
 
01:56:33.830 --> 01:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
i you brought that to the committee
 
01:56:36.390 --> 01:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
i think that's child abuse
 
01:56:38.149 --> 01:56:38.159 align:start position:0%
and so i would like to know what the
 
01:56:40.709 --> 01:56:40.719 align:start position:0%
system is going to do
 
01:56:42.870 --> 01:56:42.880 align:start position:0%
in order to repair the damage that's
 
01:56:45.589 --> 01:56:45.599 align:start position:0%
being done to those two kids
 
01:56:47.430 --> 01:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
we would like to know that too we were
 
01:56:48.950 --> 01:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
prepared to take those kids back they
 
01:56:52.229 --> 01:56:52.239 align:start position:0%
left in october of 2020
 
01:56:55.589 --> 01:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
and we were under the impression
 
01:56:58.470 --> 01:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
because we um
 
01:57:00.310 --> 01:57:00.320 align:start position:0%
lack of a better word we fussed about it
 
01:57:01.750 --> 01:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
for a long time thinking they should
 
01:57:03.109 --> 01:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
come back to us
 
01:57:04.870 --> 01:57:04.880 align:start position:0%
we had christmas presents already for
 
01:57:06.149 --> 01:57:06.159 align:start position:0%
those kids to come back a little bit
 
01:57:08.709 --> 01:57:08.719 align:start position:0%
later on um it was really at the
 
01:57:11.030 --> 01:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
objection of the casa in this case and
 
01:57:13.430 --> 01:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
supported by by dcyf that they did not
 
01:57:15.510 --> 01:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
return to us and they continue again
 
01:57:17.030 --> 01:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
based on the reports of the 10 year old
 
01:57:17.040 --> 01:57:18.470 align:start position:0%
based on the reports of the 10 year old
girl

01:57:18.470 --> 01:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
girl
 
01:57:19.910 --> 01:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
that they continue in separate
 
01:57:21.750 --> 01:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
residential facilities with no
 
01:57:25.589 --> 01:57:25.599 align:start position:0%
face-to-face contact 15 months later
 
01:57:28.310 --> 01:57:28.320 align:start position:0%
we would take them back tomorrow sir
 
01:57:30.149 --> 01:57:30.159 align:start position:0%
i may not have heard you exactly
 
01:57:33.030 --> 01:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
correctly who's standing in your way
 
01:57:35.589 --> 01:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
we have no legal relationship okay with
 
01:57:37.189 --> 01:57:37.199 align:start position:0%
the with the boy and girl so we can we
 
01:57:38.790 --> 01:57:38.800 align:start position:0%
can't make that happen they would need
 
01:57:41.750 --> 01:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
to be referred to us uh by dcyf and in
 
01:57:43.350 --> 01:57:43.360 align:start position:0%
this case you have a casa involved as
 
01:57:45.430 --> 01:57:45.440 align:start position:0%
well okay thank you do you have a what
 
01:57:47.589 --> 01:57:47.599 align:start position:0%
involved a casa a court appointed
 
01:57:49.149 --> 01:57:49.159 align:start position:0%
special advocate
 
01:57:52.870 --> 01:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
okay yeah
 
01:57:55.030 --> 01:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
senator thank you
 
01:57:55.040 --> 01:57:56.790 align:start position:0%
senator thank you
um

01:57:56.790 --> 01:57:56.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:59.030 --> 01:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
i have to say that i was
 
01:58:02.790 --> 01:58:02.800 align:start position:0%
really shocked about the social media
 
01:58:06.229 --> 01:58:06.239 align:start position:0%
posting of any resident because to me
 
01:58:06.239 --> 01:58:07.430 align:start position:0%
posting of any resident because to me
that

01:58:07.430 --> 01:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:58:07.440 --> 01:58:08.790 align:start position:0%
that
violates

01:58:08.790 --> 01:58:08.800 align:start position:0%
violates
 
01:58:08.800 --> 01:58:10.310 align:start position:0%
violates
hipaa

01:58:10.310 --> 01:58:10.320 align:start position:0%
hipaa
 
01:58:12.229 --> 01:58:12.239 align:start position:0%
and risks
 
01:58:14.310 --> 01:58:14.320 align:start position:0%
really big fines
 
01:58:15.830 --> 01:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
but um
 
01:58:17.510 --> 01:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
i understand you've
 
01:58:19.589 --> 01:58:19.599 align:start position:0%
changed that that's taken care of when
 
01:58:22.390 --> 01:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
it was when the discomfort of staff with
 
01:58:24.629 --> 01:58:24.639 align:start position:0%
it was brought to my attention it was i
 
01:58:27.270 --> 01:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
it was taken down within two minutes
 
01:58:29.270 --> 01:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
and there's thrilled about that
 
01:58:32.629 --> 01:58:32.639 align:start position:0%
but i have a specific question about the
 
01:58:34.629 --> 01:58:34.639 align:start position:0%
use of restrooms yes
 
01:58:37.750 --> 01:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
um we've heard there's a legal standard
 
01:58:40.790 --> 01:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
about when they can be applied that's
 
01:58:40.800 --> 01:58:41.669 align:start position:0%
about when they can be applied that's
correct

01:58:41.669 --> 01:58:41.679 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:58:41.679 --> 01:58:42.709 align:start position:0%
correct
um

01:58:42.709 --> 01:58:42.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:45.750 --> 01:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
and over the last few years the state
 
01:58:49.910 --> 01:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
has made a public policy decision about
 
01:58:49.920 --> 01:58:50.830 align:start position:0%
has made a public policy decision about
the

01:58:50.830 --> 01:58:50.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:58:53.430 --> 01:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed care of children
 
01:58:56.310 --> 01:58:56.320 align:start position:0%
that was done in senate bill 14 from a
 
01:58:58.070 --> 01:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
few years ago
 
01:59:01.830 --> 01:59:01.840 align:start position:0%
what is the specific
 
01:59:01.840 --> 01:59:03.669 align:start position:0%
what is the specific
currently

01:59:03.669 --> 01:59:03.679 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:59:05.910 --> 01:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
at the nashua children's home are you
 
01:59:09.189 --> 01:59:09.199 align:start position:0%
only putting children in restraints if
 
01:59:12.310 --> 01:59:12.320 align:start position:0%
they are at risk of self-harm or harm to
 
01:59:16.070 --> 01:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
another or or harm to others um having
 
01:59:18.629 --> 01:59:18.639 align:start position:0%
been again one of the things and having
 
01:59:22.149 --> 01:59:22.159 align:start position:0%
been around a long time um i was uh very
 
01:59:24.390 --> 01:59:24.400 align:start position:0%
involved with the creation of statute
 
01:59:26.950 --> 01:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
126u back in 2010
 
01:59:29.750 --> 01:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
and in fact i demonstrated the physical
 
01:59:31.270 --> 01:59:31.280 align:start position:0%
intervention technique that we used
 
01:59:32.470 --> 01:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
across the street in the senate
 
01:59:34.149 --> 01:59:34.159 align:start position:0%
conference room during the hearings on
 
01:59:34.159 --> 01:59:35.109 align:start position:0%
conference room during the hearings on
that

01:59:35.109 --> 01:59:35.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:59:37.109 --> 01:59:37.119 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the specifics of that
 
01:59:38.950 --> 01:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
kids can be physically
 
01:59:41.109 --> 01:59:41.119 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's appropriate to use
 
01:59:42.790 --> 01:59:42.800 align:start position:0%
physical intervention when there's
 
01:59:44.709 --> 01:59:44.719 align:start position:0%
imminent risk of substantial bodily
 
01:59:44.719 --> 01:59:45.750 align:start position:0%
imminent risk of substantial bodily
injury

01:59:45.750 --> 01:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
injury
 
01:59:47.430 --> 01:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
to sell for others
 
01:59:49.669 --> 01:59:49.679 align:start position:0%
it's also though permissible to
 
01:59:51.990 --> 01:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
put hands-on kids to escort them from
 
01:59:53.830 --> 01:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
one place to another
 
01:59:56.070 --> 01:59:56.080 align:start position:0%
and there are times and they happen
 
01:59:57.990 --> 01:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
quite regularly we're in the process of
 
01:59:59.430 --> 01:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
doing that
 
02:00:02.149 --> 02:00:02.159 align:start position:0%
that child becomes a risk to himself or
 
02:00:03.510 --> 02:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
others in terms of their physical
 
02:00:03.520 --> 02:00:04.629 align:start position:0%
others in terms of their physical
aggression

02:00:04.629 --> 02:00:04.639 align:start position:0%
aggression
 
02:00:06.470 --> 02:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
so that does happen i mean i would say
 
02:00:07.750 --> 02:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
that our
 
02:00:10.550 --> 02:00:10.560 align:start position:0%
and this and again as i as i referenced
 
02:00:13.030 --> 02:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
earlier one of the one of the challenges
 
02:00:15.589 --> 02:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
in working with groups of children is
 
02:00:17.750 --> 02:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
that sometimes we need to affect that
 
02:00:19.990 --> 02:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
removal of a kid from their group
 
02:00:21.830 --> 02:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
setting because of the effect that it's
 
02:00:23.830 --> 02:00:23.840 align:start position:0%
having on everybody else
 
02:00:25.589 --> 02:00:25.599 align:start position:0%
you know our numbers have dropped the
 
02:00:27.030 --> 02:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
other the other thing i would i would i
 
02:00:29.189 --> 02:00:29.199 align:start position:0%
would point out about our experience
 
02:00:31.589 --> 02:00:31.599 align:start position:0%
and this i think is certainly true that
 
02:00:34.629 --> 02:00:34.639 align:start position:0%
we accept kids into our program
 
02:00:36.950 --> 02:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
that other new hampshire programs won't
 
02:00:39.109 --> 02:00:39.119 align:start position:0%
accept specifically because
 
02:00:40.870 --> 02:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
of their history of physically
 
02:00:42.790 --> 02:00:42.800 align:start position:0%
aggressive behavior and then more
 
02:00:42.800 --> 02:00:43.910 align:start position:0%
aggressive behavior and then more
importantly

02:00:43.910 --> 02:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
importantly
 
02:00:46.149 --> 02:00:46.159 align:start position:0%
we maintain our commitment to those kids
 
02:00:47.750 --> 02:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
despite their having intensive
 
02:00:50.149 --> 02:00:50.159 align:start position:0%
difficulty with that
 
02:00:51.830 --> 02:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
no one likes to put their hands on kids
 
02:00:53.350 --> 02:00:53.360 align:start position:0%
and physically manage kids it's the
 
02:00:55.910 --> 02:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
least palatable part of the job that we
 
02:00:59.109 --> 02:00:59.119 align:start position:0%
that we have however when we need to do
 
02:01:01.109 --> 02:01:01.119 align:start position:0%
that we don't then end that kid's
 
02:01:02.790 --> 02:01:02.800 align:start position:0%
placement with us i mean those kids stay
 
02:01:04.550 --> 02:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
with us we maintain the commitment to
 
02:01:05.589 --> 02:01:05.599 align:start position:0%
those kids
 
02:01:08.550 --> 02:01:08.560 align:start position:0%
and um i mean there's been some some
 
02:01:10.709 --> 02:01:10.719 align:start position:0%
literature that refers to physical
 
02:01:13.189 --> 02:01:13.199 align:start position:0%
intervention as a as a therapeutic
 
02:01:13.199 --> 02:01:14.229 align:start position:0%
intervention as a as a therapeutic
failure

02:01:14.229 --> 02:01:14.239 align:start position:0%
failure
 
02:01:18.070 --> 02:01:18.080 align:start position:0%
um which i strenuously object to because
 
02:01:20.070 --> 02:01:20.080 align:start position:0%
the situation we have is this
 
02:01:22.470 --> 02:01:22.480 align:start position:0%
we have kids that are referred to us
 
02:01:24.790 --> 02:01:24.800 align:start position:0%
that have have a history of being
 
02:01:27.030 --> 02:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
aggressive to self aggressive to others
 
02:01:29.910 --> 02:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
self injurious injurious to others
 
02:01:32.390 --> 02:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
when we accept them into our program
 
02:01:34.470 --> 02:01:34.480 align:start position:0%
there's an understanding that
 
02:01:36.470 --> 02:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
that behavior is not going to stop
 
02:01:38.229 --> 02:01:38.239 align:start position:0%
simply by the replacement with us that
 
02:01:40.229 --> 02:01:40.239 align:start position:0%
will most likely continue
 
02:01:43.030 --> 02:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
when it continues and we stop that boy
 
02:01:44.950 --> 02:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
or girl from hurting themselves or
 
02:01:47.589 --> 02:01:47.599 align:start position:0%
hurting somebody else how exactly have
 
02:01:51.030 --> 02:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
we failed in doing so so what we see
 
02:01:52.870 --> 02:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
happening sometimes is kids come into
 
02:01:54.790 --> 02:01:54.800 align:start position:0%
the program they need those kinds of
 
02:01:57.030 --> 02:01:57.040 align:start position:0%
controls for a while and then those
 
02:01:59.830 --> 02:01:59.840 align:start position:0%
kinds of then those episodes dissipate
 
02:02:03.430 --> 02:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
and interestingly we find out oftentimes
 
02:02:05.350 --> 02:02:05.360 align:start position:0%
those kids form the closest
 
02:02:07.830 --> 02:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
relationships with those staff that they
 
02:02:09.189 --> 02:02:09.199 align:start position:0%
know will keep them safe when they're
 
02:02:13.669 --> 02:02:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:15.830 --> 02:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
representative edwards uh thank you for
 
02:02:17.350 --> 02:02:17.360 align:start position:0%
the follow-up
 
02:02:20.390 --> 02:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
this this may be for uh the commissioner
 
02:02:23.350 --> 02:02:23.360 align:start position:0%
or or mr ribson i i noticed she started
 
02:02:26.390 --> 02:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
taking notes around when i mentioned the
 
02:02:27.910 --> 02:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
child abuse
 
02:02:27.920 --> 02:02:28.870 align:start position:0%
child abuse
comment

02:02:28.870 --> 02:02:28.880 align:start position:0%
comment
 
02:02:32.149 --> 02:02:32.159 align:start position:0%
and with without uh predisposing what
 
02:02:34.390 --> 02:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
the outcome ought to be i i would just
 
02:02:36.550 --> 02:02:36.560 align:start position:0%
appreciate it if you
 
02:02:38.790 --> 02:02:38.800 align:start position:0%
could have sort of an independent review
 
02:02:40.790 --> 02:02:40.800 align:start position:0%
of the facts and so your own
 
02:02:40.800 --> 02:02:42.070 align:start position:0%
of the facts and so your own
professional

02:02:42.070 --> 02:02:42.080 align:start position:0%
professional
 
02:02:44.709 --> 02:02:44.719 align:start position:0%
judgment uh so that we could
 
02:02:47.669 --> 02:02:47.679 align:start position:0%
have you share that with us
 
02:02:52.870 --> 02:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:54.550 --> 02:02:54.560 align:start position:0%
what can we do to help
 
02:02:56.470 --> 02:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
there was a couple three years ago we
 
02:02:59.030 --> 02:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
had a special study committee to try to
 
02:03:01.510 --> 02:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
address parity in the group homes
 
02:03:03.270 --> 02:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh i don't know what came with that
 
02:03:03.280 --> 02:03:04.550 align:start position:0%
uh i don't know what came with that
study

02:03:04.550 --> 02:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
study
 
02:03:07.189 --> 02:03:07.199 align:start position:0%
have you been getting a better rates of
 
02:03:10.310 --> 02:03:10.320 align:start position:0%
pay we have sir uh so what else do we
 
02:03:12.229 --> 02:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
need to do i i think you're probably
 
02:03:14.470 --> 02:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
still mostly dependent on charitable
 
02:03:14.480 --> 02:03:15.669 align:start position:0%
still mostly dependent on charitable
giving

02:03:15.669 --> 02:03:15.679 align:start position:0%
giving
 
02:03:16.950 --> 02:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh we're somewhat dependent on
 
02:03:19.510 --> 02:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
charitable giving as i when you visit
 
02:03:20.790 --> 02:03:20.800 align:start position:0%
nashua children something one of the
 
02:03:22.950 --> 02:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
examples i use was that
 
02:03:25.270 --> 02:03:25.280 align:start position:0%
i go and i say i make a presentation a
 
02:03:27.109 --> 02:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
group of general motors executives and i
 
02:03:28.709 --> 02:03:28.719 align:start position:0%
talk to them about their product being
 
02:03:31.189 --> 02:03:31.199 align:start position:0%
making cars and that if that car costs a
 
02:03:33.430 --> 02:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars to make they're able to
 
02:03:35.430 --> 02:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
charge fifteen hundred dollars for that
 
02:03:37.430 --> 02:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
car nashua children's home our product
 
02:03:38.709 --> 02:03:38.719 align:start position:0%
is residential care and special
 
02:03:41.270 --> 02:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
education if our product costs say a
 
02:03:43.830 --> 02:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars we charge 90 for it or
 
02:03:46.310 --> 02:03:46.320 align:start position:0%
85 and then we do write letters to you
 
02:03:47.589 --> 02:03:47.599 align:start position:0%
and your friends and neighbors seeking
 
02:03:49.830 --> 02:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
charitable contributions as far as what
 
02:03:51.109 --> 02:03:51.119 align:start position:0%
else i mean one of the challenges that
 
02:03:53.750 --> 02:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
we have right now is the is the staffing
 
02:03:53.760 --> 02:03:55.430 align:start position:0%
we have right now is the is the staffing
issue

02:03:55.430 --> 02:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
issue
 
02:03:57.830 --> 02:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
and i think that one of the things that
 
02:03:59.910 --> 02:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
would be helpful
 
02:04:03.109 --> 02:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
is is simply more appreciation to those
 
02:04:03.119 --> 02:04:04.390 align:start position:0%
is is simply more appreciation to those
people

02:04:04.390 --> 02:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:04:07.350 --> 02:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
who as they put us can probably make
 
02:04:09.350 --> 02:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
more per hour the person that pours
 
02:04:11.109 --> 02:04:11.119 align:start position:0%
their coffee in the morning at dunks
 
02:04:12.709 --> 02:04:12.719 align:start position:0%
probably makes more per hour than they
 
02:04:12.719 --> 02:04:14.229 align:start position:0%
probably makes more per hour than they
do

02:04:14.229 --> 02:04:14.239 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:04:16.229 --> 02:04:16.239 align:start position:0%
and they still want to do the work they
 
02:04:18.629 --> 02:04:18.639 align:start position:0%
still want to show up to work every day
 
02:04:20.629 --> 02:04:20.639 align:start position:0%
it's hard to do that
 
02:04:22.229 --> 02:04:22.239 align:start position:0%
when they're going to be continually
 
02:04:24.470 --> 02:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
judged and investigated
 
02:04:27.109 --> 02:04:27.119 align:start position:0%
by people that honestly have never done
 
02:04:28.950 --> 02:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
the work i mean i would say that with a
 
02:04:30.550 --> 02:04:30.560 align:start position:0%
lot of the criticism of the physical
 
02:04:32.229 --> 02:04:32.239 align:start position:0%
intervention a lot of the
 
02:04:34.709 --> 02:04:34.719 align:start position:0%
criticism of some of the advocacy groups
 
02:04:36.709 --> 02:04:36.719 align:start position:0%
i think i'm correct in saying that for
 
02:04:39.030 --> 02:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
the most part none of those people have
 
02:04:40.950 --> 02:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
ever been in the position
 
02:04:42.149 --> 02:04:42.159 align:start position:0%
have to respond to a physically
 
02:04:43.669 --> 02:04:43.679 align:start position:0%
under-controlled child
 
02:04:45.589 --> 02:04:45.599 align:start position:0%
so i think it's rather than having the
 
02:04:48.470 --> 02:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
criticism how about the appreciation for
 
02:04:50.870 --> 02:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
the very difficult work that these
 
02:04:52.870 --> 02:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
people do emotionally physically
 
02:04:55.589 --> 02:04:55.599 align:start position:0%
mentally showing up every single day i
 
02:04:56.950 --> 02:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
think that would mean a whole lot to
 
02:04:59.990 --> 02:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
those people to do
 
02:05:01.189 --> 02:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:05:03.189 --> 02:05:03.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr villardi now the chair has
 
02:05:04.629 --> 02:05:04.639 align:start position:0%
to do something
 
02:05:04.639 --> 02:05:05.430 align:start position:0%
to do something
that

02:05:05.430 --> 02:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:05:08.629 --> 02:05:08.639 align:start position:0%
no chairs like to do and that is to say
 
02:05:11.669 --> 02:05:11.679 align:start position:0%
we have three additional
 
02:05:13.910 --> 02:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
presentations to make
 
02:05:16.950 --> 02:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
that in order to do them justice
 
02:05:18.870 --> 02:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
is going to take a while
 
02:05:21.589 --> 02:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
i'm going to move them to the 25th of
 
02:05:24.229 --> 02:05:24.239 align:start position:0%
february and move them to the top of the
 
02:05:24.239 --> 02:05:25.270 align:start position:0%
february and move them to the top of the
list

02:05:25.270 --> 02:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
list
 
02:05:26.870 --> 02:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
so that
 
02:05:29.189 --> 02:05:29.199 align:start position:0%
if somebody's presentation gets cut it's
 
02:05:31.189 --> 02:05:31.199 align:start position:0%
a new one that day not the ones of you
 
02:05:33.430 --> 02:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
who are here however i do want to
 
02:05:35.510 --> 02:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
continue on this because we have a few
 
02:05:38.069 --> 02:05:38.079 align:start position:0%
more people i'd like to hear from on
 
02:05:39.990 --> 02:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
this specific thing
 
02:05:44.629 --> 02:05:44.639 align:start position:0%
so the designated receiving facilities

we will continue uh this presentation on

hearing is much appreciated um and that
 
02:09:21.430 --> 02:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
on the oversight of
 
02:09:23.669 --> 02:09:23.679 align:start position:0%
what had been happening at st
 
02:09:25.830 --> 02:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
excuse me the previous places i had
 
02:09:28.470 --> 02:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
worked also for 30 plus years in fact
 
02:09:30.310 --> 02:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
that's where i met
 
02:09:30.320 --> 02:09:31.270 align:start position:0%
that's where i met
david

02:09:31.270 --> 02:09:31.280 align:start position:0%
david
 
02:09:35.030 --> 02:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
that's how he and i uh uh uh
 
02:09:37.350 --> 02:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
knew each other and uh it's almost 40
 
02:09:39.669 --> 02:09:39.679 align:start position:0%
years in fact that i've known uh david
 
02:09:42.149 --> 02:09:42.159 align:start position:0%
so it's a good way of saying that that
 
02:09:44.629 --> 02:09:44.639 align:start position:0%
in fact that i come here in this whole
 
02:09:46.550 --> 02:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
process with a
 
02:09:48.550 --> 02:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
great deal of
 
02:09:49.750 --> 02:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
of struggle
 
02:09:52.950 --> 02:09:52.960 align:start position:0%
at least initially in it because i felt
 
02:09:55.270 --> 02:09:55.280 align:start position:0%
and still do a tremendous loyalty to the
 
02:09:57.910 --> 02:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
work at nashua children's home i've
 
02:10:00.709 --> 02:10:00.719 align:start position:0%
respected the work that david has done
 
02:10:03.350 --> 02:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
or much have done over the years but
 
02:10:05.430 --> 02:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
increasingly over a period of time i
 
02:10:07.350 --> 02:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
felt more and more
 
02:10:07.360 --> 02:10:08.790 align:start position:0%
felt more and more
problematic

02:10:08.790 --> 02:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
problematic
 
02:10:08.800 --> 02:10:09.830 align:start position:0%
problematic
the

02:10:09.830 --> 02:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:10:11.510 --> 02:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
people that i was supervising were
 
02:10:11.520 --> 02:10:12.629 align:start position:0%
people that i was supervising were
bringing

02:10:12.629 --> 02:10:12.639 align:start position:0%
bringing
 
02:10:14.390 --> 02:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
stories to me that were
 
02:10:17.669 --> 02:10:17.679 align:start position:0%
extremely uh troubling uh and uh
 
02:10:19.750 --> 02:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
did not fit for what i would call a
 
02:10:22.709 --> 02:10:22.719 align:start position:0%
reasonable standard of uh care
 
02:10:24.069 --> 02:10:24.079 align:start position:0%
so the
 
02:10:27.189 --> 02:10:27.199 align:start position:0%
purpose in coming here is is to hope to
 
02:10:30.310 --> 02:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
take a look at both the oversight system
 
02:10:33.030 --> 02:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
for uh national children's home moving
 
02:10:33.040 --> 02:10:34.069 align:start position:0%
for uh national children's home moving
forward

02:10:34.069 --> 02:10:34.079 align:start position:0%
forward
 
02:10:37.189 --> 02:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
uh but also for in uh in the larger
 
02:10:39.990 --> 02:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
perspective residential programs uh uh
 
02:10:43.510 --> 02:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
in in general um and i have to stop at
 
02:10:46.149 --> 02:10:46.159 align:start position:0%
this point in time to the over oversight
 
02:10:49.430 --> 02:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh system i don't know if uh if uh
 
02:10:52.709 --> 02:10:52.719 align:start position:0%
director o'neill is still here
 
02:10:55.669 --> 02:10:55.679 align:start position:0%
or she's right in the doorway i i cannot
 
02:10:55.679 --> 02:10:56.390 align:start position:0%
or she's right in the doorway i i cannot
say

02:10:56.390 --> 02:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
say
 
02:10:56.400 --> 02:10:57.750 align:start position:0%
say
enough

02:10:57.750 --> 02:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
enough
 
02:10:59.990 --> 02:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
about the comprehensiveness
 
02:11:02.870 --> 02:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
of what she has done
 
02:11:05.430 --> 02:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
and looking at the report because the
 
02:11:05.440 --> 02:11:07.350 align:start position:0%
and looking at the report because the
conversation

02:11:07.350 --> 02:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
02:11:09.750 --> 02:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
in here had to do somewhat with
 
02:11:09.760 --> 02:11:11.669 align:start position:0%
in here had to do somewhat with
permanency

02:11:11.669 --> 02:11:11.679 align:start position:0%
permanency
 
02:11:13.510 --> 02:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
and also restraint
 
02:11:15.589 --> 02:11:15.599 align:start position:0%
let me relate that we have four people
 
02:11:15.599 --> 02:11:16.870 align:start position:0%
let me relate that we have four people
here

02:11:16.870 --> 02:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:11:19.270 --> 02:11:19.280 align:start position:0%
former employees of nashua children's
 
02:11:21.990 --> 02:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
home who all left
 
02:11:25.030 --> 02:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
well at least the three therapists left
 
02:11:27.350 --> 02:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
because of the atmosphere and the lack
 
02:11:30.629 --> 02:11:30.639 align:start position:0%
of responsiveness not just by
 
02:11:33.030 --> 02:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
the executive director but also by the
 
02:11:33.040 --> 02:11:34.229 align:start position:0%
the executive director but also by the
board

02:11:34.229 --> 02:11:34.239 align:start position:0%
board
 
02:11:36.709 --> 02:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
and i've i have reached out to
 
02:11:38.950 --> 02:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
one of the board members who is here
 
02:11:41.109 --> 02:11:41.119 align:start position:0%
today and i'll speak about that right
 
02:11:41.119 --> 02:11:42.069 align:start position:0%
today and i'll speak about that right
now

02:11:42.069 --> 02:11:42.079 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:11:44.790 --> 02:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
so the brief history of uh the
 
02:11:47.589 --> 02:11:47.599 align:start position:0%
complaints and remember this group here
 
02:11:51.030 --> 02:11:51.040 align:start position:0%

sir
so

02:12:47.350 --> 02:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:12:47.360 --> 02:12:48.709 align:start position:0%
so
this

02:12:48.709 --> 02:12:48.719 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:12:51.830 --> 02:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
this begins the process at least for our
 
02:12:57.750 --> 02:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
group here uh begins in may of uh 2019
 
02:13:01.750 --> 02:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
and it begins and please uh you know use
 
02:13:03.830 --> 02:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
our person at any point to jump in or
 
02:13:06.709 --> 02:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
megan or stay seat at any point uh that
 
02:13:08.709 --> 02:13:08.719 align:start position:0%
uh you want to add here
 
02:13:10.629 --> 02:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
because they are the people that had the
 
02:13:13.030 --> 02:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
direct experience i heard it through
 
02:13:15.990 --> 02:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
them and then in my conversations with
 
02:13:19.030 --> 02:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
the executive director on most of these
 
02:13:21.109 --> 02:13:21.119 align:start position:0%
issues that we're going to address so it
 
02:13:24.709 --> 02:13:24.719 align:start position:0%
begins with this social media post
 
02:13:27.189 --> 02:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
i want to highlight this social media
 
02:13:30.470 --> 02:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
post is not simply that a posting of a
 
02:13:32.950 --> 02:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
child was placed that certainly is a
 
02:13:35.030 --> 02:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
privacy issue
 
02:13:37.189 --> 02:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
this is in
 
02:13:40.069 --> 02:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
documents that we have we have sent to
 
02:13:43.030 --> 02:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
as you look down the list here from dcyf
 
02:13:45.750 --> 02:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
the charitable trust unit uh and the
 
02:13:48.470 --> 02:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
office of child advocate it begins if
 
02:13:48.480 --> 02:13:49.589 align:start position:0%
office of child advocate it begins if
you

02:13:49.589 --> 02:13:49.599 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:13:50.950 --> 02:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
have the pictures here but it's
 
02:13:53.270 --> 02:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
inappropriate within this setting uh to
 
02:13:56.950 --> 02:13:56.960 align:start position:0%
show you that but it's a posting
 
02:13:58.790 --> 02:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
of a uh
 
02:14:01.430 --> 02:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
m girl uh nine years old at that point
 
02:14:03.430 --> 02:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
was she was she
 
02:14:05.350 --> 02:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
yeah she was eight okay she was eight at
 
02:14:07.830 --> 02:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
that point in time this is the this is
 
02:14:11.430 --> 02:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
the girl she is known as rose in the
 
02:14:13.830 --> 02:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
office of child advocates
 
02:14:13.840 --> 02:14:15.350 align:start position:0%
office of child advocates
report

02:14:15.350 --> 02:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
report
 
02:14:18.069 --> 02:14:18.079 align:start position:0%
so an elias name on that
 
02:14:19.910 --> 02:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
she is the girl that
 
02:14:21.830 --> 02:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
that she had medical conditions which
 
02:14:24.870 --> 02:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
involved gastrointestinal tract
 
02:14:29.270 --> 02:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
issues she also had been sexually abused
 
02:14:30.790 --> 02:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
she is standing here
 
02:14:30.800 --> 02:14:31.510 align:start position:0%
she is standing here
and

02:14:31.510 --> 02:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:14:33.270 --> 02:14:33.280 align:start position:0%
you can picture this
 
02:14:37.109 --> 02:14:37.119 align:start position:0%
with a staff member a male staff member
 
02:14:39.669 --> 02:14:39.679 align:start position:0%
holding up a face cloth
 
02:14:45.030 --> 02:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
and the face cloth um is looking soiled
 
02:14:48.629 --> 02:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
and it was posted on an instagram of a
 
02:14:52.149 --> 02:14:52.159 align:start position:0%
supervisor of a supervisor from this
 
02:14:56.229 --> 02:14:56.239 align:start position:0%
unit and it said uh is this
 
02:14:59.910 --> 02:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
makeup or is this poop
 
02:15:02.149 --> 02:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
that was what the girl looked uh
 
02:15:02.159 --> 02:15:03.589 align:start position:0%
that was what the girl looked uh
distressed

02:15:03.589 --> 02:15:03.599 align:start position:0%
distressed
 
02:15:06.069 --> 02:15:06.079 align:start position:0%
and crying and subsequently this same
 
02:15:09.830 --> 02:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
girl becomes on the subject of a filing
 
02:15:12.790 --> 02:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
around some similar issues not on social
 
02:15:14.390 --> 02:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
media law
 
02:15:17.270 --> 02:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
postings but also around her medical
 
02:15:20.830 --> 02:15:20.840 align:start position:0%
condition that you heard referred to by
 
02:15:25.510 --> 02:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh director o'neal in in her uh in her
 
02:15:29.109 --> 02:15:29.119 align:start position:0%
report so the problem here immediately
 
02:15:32.310 --> 02:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
takes place because it wasn't simply uh
 
02:15:35.109 --> 02:15:35.119 align:start position:0%
that uh that it was a social media it
 
02:15:38.149 --> 02:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
was inappropriate by any measure that
 
02:15:39.589 --> 02:15:39.599 align:start position:0%
this occurred
 
02:15:42.229 --> 02:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
it was inappropriate that a supervisor
 
02:15:45.189 --> 02:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
did this and it was liked by various
 
02:15:47.830 --> 02:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
staff members of that unit and it was
 
02:15:51.669 --> 02:15:51.679 align:start position:0%
liked by the executive director
 
02:15:51.679 --> 02:15:53.669 align:start position:0%
liked by the executive director
rihanna

02:15:53.669 --> 02:15:53.679 align:start position:0%
rihanna
 
02:15:56.229 --> 02:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
and stacy
 
02:15:59.109 --> 02:15:59.119 align:start position:0%
brought these concerns
 
02:16:01.589 --> 02:16:01.599 align:start position:0%
to the executive director and i think
 
02:16:03.350 --> 02:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
you have some sort of flavor if you've
 
02:16:06.229 --> 02:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
read the report and especially the
 
02:16:09.430 --> 02:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
addendum to the
 
02:16:11.830 --> 02:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
office of child's advocate it was
 
02:16:14.629 --> 02:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
minimized it was
 
02:16:18.069 --> 02:16:18.079 align:start position:0%
belittled as being not significant
 
02:16:18.079 --> 02:16:18.870 align:start position:0%
belittled as being not significant
and

02:16:18.870 --> 02:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:16:21.109 --> 02:16:21.119 align:start position:0%
frankly i mean please correct me at any
 
02:16:23.189 --> 02:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
point in time there was what you
 
02:16:24.790 --> 02:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
experienced as an intimidating
 
02:16:24.800 --> 02:16:27.350 align:start position:0%
experienced as an intimidating
atmosphere

02:16:27.350 --> 02:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
atmosphere
 
02:16:35.270 --> 02:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:37.030 --> 02:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
excuse me this is very important that
 
02:16:39.349 --> 02:16:39.359 align:start position:0%
we're here and it's recorded so
 
02:16:42.790 --> 02:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:45.270 --> 02:16:45.280 align:start position:0%
from my perspective close to the mic as
 
02:16:47.589 --> 02:16:47.599 align:start position:0%
the therapist of that client at the time
 
02:16:49.669 --> 02:16:49.679 align:start position:0%
and i want to start off thank you bye
 
02:16:51.110 --> 02:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
for having me
 
02:16:52.790 --> 02:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
i worked at nashville children's home
 
02:16:55.110 --> 02:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
for three years and i loved my job at
 
02:16:57.429 --> 02:16:57.439 align:start position:0%
nashua children's home i loved my job so
 
02:17:00.070 --> 02:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
much until i did not love my job anymore
 
02:17:02.629 --> 02:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
and it started with this incident
 
02:17:03.429 --> 02:17:03.439 align:start position:0%
of it
 
02:17:05.669 --> 02:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
being brought to my attention that my
 
02:17:07.990 --> 02:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
client was being shown on social media
 
02:17:10.549 --> 02:17:10.559 align:start position:0%
in this way i would meet regularly with
 
02:17:12.150 --> 02:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
dave that's what the therapist do you
 
02:17:13.990 --> 02:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
meet with him on a weekly basis for
 
02:17:15.910 --> 02:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
supervision to review court reports
 
02:17:15.920 --> 02:17:17.190 align:start position:0%
supervision to review court reports
caseloads

02:17:17.190 --> 02:17:17.200 align:start position:0%
caseloads
 
02:17:20.790 --> 02:17:20.800 align:start position:0%
and i presented my concern to him
 
02:17:23.110 --> 02:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
i presented my concern to him
 
02:17:25.429 --> 02:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
and it was immediately i did not say how
 
02:17:27.349 --> 02:17:27.359 align:start position:0%
i saw the social media post i just said
 
02:17:28.870 --> 02:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
that i had been witness to it and that
 
02:17:31.429 --> 02:17:31.439 align:start position:0%
was immediately met with
 
02:17:31.439 --> 02:17:32.950 align:start position:0%
was immediately met with
defense

02:17:32.950 --> 02:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
defense
 
02:17:35.509 --> 02:17:35.519 align:start position:0%
he called out the other therapist's name
 
02:17:37.270 --> 02:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
who had brought it to my attention and
 
02:17:39.349 --> 02:17:39.359 align:start position:0%
tried to turn blame on her for doing
 
02:17:40.709 --> 02:17:40.719 align:start position:0%
something else
 
02:17:43.509 --> 02:17:43.519 align:start position:0%
i told him that that was not my place my
 
02:17:46.070 --> 02:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
concern was that this happened and that
 
02:17:47.429 --> 02:17:47.439 align:start position:0%
i felt there needed to be a larger
 
02:17:49.429 --> 02:17:49.439 align:start position:0%
conversation with the staff in regards
 
02:17:50.870 --> 02:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
to the clinical treatment of these
 
02:17:52.790 --> 02:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
children because even if it was a
 
02:17:54.549 --> 02:17:54.559 align:start position:0%
mistake and boundaries sometimes get
 
02:17:56.549 --> 02:17:56.559 align:start position:0%
crossed between staff and what they do
 
02:17:58.389 --> 02:17:58.399 align:start position:0%
we needed to have a larger conversation
 
02:17:59.990 --> 02:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
about this if they felt comfortable to
 
02:18:02.070 --> 02:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
do so
 
02:18:04.790 --> 02:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
as i said that and i quote he said you
 
02:18:06.709 --> 02:18:06.719 align:start position:0%
therapists and your ethics i don't buy
 
02:18:08.230 --> 02:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
into it
 
02:18:11.349 --> 02:18:11.359 align:start position:0%
this is the continued reaction to me
 
02:18:13.669 --> 02:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
from this point on until i left the
 
02:18:13.679 --> 02:18:15.030 align:start position:0%
from this point on until i left the
agency

02:18:15.030 --> 02:18:15.040 align:start position:0%
agency
 
02:18:17.270 --> 02:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
i felt that as soon as i felt that
 
02:18:19.270 --> 02:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
something was
 
02:18:21.830 --> 02:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
against the staff i think that's how it
 
02:18:23.669 --> 02:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
was viewed that i was attacking staff
 
02:18:25.589 --> 02:18:25.599 align:start position:0%
which was not the point i had concerns
 
02:18:27.429 --> 02:18:27.439 align:start position:0%
about my client and i felt that this was
 
02:18:28.629 --> 02:18:28.639 align:start position:0%
appropriate to have a larger
 
02:18:31.270 --> 02:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
conversation about it i felt that any
 
02:18:32.870 --> 02:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
other clinical decision that i made
 
02:18:35.910 --> 02:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
until i left was met with
 
02:18:37.750 --> 02:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
almost harassment
 
02:18:40.469 --> 02:18:40.479 align:start position:0%
i felt that i was being micromanaged
 
02:18:43.030 --> 02:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
i had two clinical supervisors at the
 
02:18:44.709 --> 02:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
time i had bob
 
02:18:46.469 --> 02:18:46.479 align:start position:0%
and then i also had to pay for another
 
02:18:48.629 --> 02:18:48.639 align:start position:0%
outside supervisor because his didn't
 
02:18:50.389 --> 02:18:50.399 align:start position:0%
count toward my licensure
 
02:18:51.990 --> 02:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
i had the feedback from the two of them
 
02:18:53.750 --> 02:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
this entire time
 
02:18:56.549 --> 02:18:56.559 align:start position:0%
i gave my notice because i also felt
 
02:18:58.309 --> 02:18:58.319 align:start position:0%
that the complaints that were being
 
02:19:01.429 --> 02:19:01.439 align:start position:0%
brought up it was not only minimized but
 
02:19:04.629 --> 02:19:04.639 align:start position:0%
the concerns of the staff people that
 
02:19:04.639 --> 02:19:05.509 align:start position:0%
the concerns of the staff people that
were

02:19:05.509 --> 02:19:05.519 align:start position:0%
were
 
02:19:07.589 --> 02:19:07.599 align:start position:0%
acting in these ways seem to be getting
 
02:19:10.309 --> 02:19:10.319 align:start position:0%
promoted and the decision-making in
 
02:19:13.349 --> 02:19:13.359 align:start position:0%
regards to how the therapist had a voice
 
02:19:15.349 --> 02:19:15.359 align:start position:0%
within the agency seemed to just not
 
02:19:18.150 --> 02:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
really be inexistent and i did say that
 
02:19:20.230 --> 02:19:20.240 align:start position:0%
in my letter of resignation that i felt
 
02:19:22.150 --> 02:19:22.160 align:start position:0%
there had been shifts in decision making
 
02:19:23.990 --> 02:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
that went against my clinical judgment
 
02:19:25.669 --> 02:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
as a therapist and this is why i was
 
02:19:27.669 --> 02:19:27.679 align:start position:0%
leaving once i gave my letter of
 
02:19:29.669 --> 02:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
resignation it came to my attention from
 
02:19:31.190 --> 02:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
another client
 
02:19:33.910 --> 02:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
that she had concerns for the same girl
 
02:19:36.870 --> 02:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
in the social media post
 
02:19:39.030 --> 02:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
that she was being forced to report her
 
02:19:41.270 --> 02:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
bowel movements to a gentleman staff
 
02:19:44.230 --> 02:19:44.240 align:start position:0%
member on another unit this
 
02:19:45.910 --> 02:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
very much concerned me but of course
 
02:19:47.750 --> 02:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
this was from another client i brought
 
02:19:50.309 --> 02:19:50.319 align:start position:0%
it to my clinical supervisor
 
02:19:52.389 --> 02:19:52.399 align:start position:0%
created a plan with this client to have
 
02:19:55.030 --> 02:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
a non-leading conversation
 
02:19:57.110 --> 02:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
which i did have a transcription of it
 
02:19:58.630 --> 02:19:58.640 align:start position:0%
has been given to the office of child
 
02:20:00.790 --> 02:20:00.800 align:start position:0%
advocate and it did confirm
 
02:20:03.590 --> 02:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
the concerns of this girl feeling like
 
02:20:05.590 --> 02:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
she did not have a choice in the matter
 
02:20:07.190 --> 02:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
she felt uncomfortable she felt she
 
02:20:08.870 --> 02:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
could not talk to staff about this
 
02:20:10.389 --> 02:20:10.399 align:start position:0%
because she felt she would be called a
 
02:20:12.469 --> 02:20:12.479 align:start position:0%
liar because she didn't say something
 
02:20:15.190 --> 02:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
sooner and i'm talking every day she was
 
02:20:17.349 --> 02:20:17.359 align:start position:0%
from what i heard had to make a call to
 
02:20:19.429 --> 02:20:19.439 align:start position:0%
a male staff member on another unit to
 
02:20:19.439 --> 02:20:20.550 align:start position:0%
a male staff member on another unit to
describe

02:20:20.550 --> 02:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
describe
 
02:20:23.110 --> 02:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
her bowel movements
 
02:20:25.510 --> 02:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
so mr chair can i can i make a point
 
02:20:27.830 --> 02:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
here or a question sure
 
02:20:31.190 --> 02:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
okay um i i know that uh when our
 
02:20:31.200 --> 02:20:32.550 align:start position:0%
okay um i i know that uh when our
selectmen

02:20:32.550 --> 02:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
selectmen
 
02:20:35.990 --> 02:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
start to deal with personnel issues they
 
02:20:38.070 --> 02:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
they they go into closed session that
 
02:20:40.710 --> 02:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
there's an exception for 91a
 
02:20:40.720 --> 02:20:41.670 align:start position:0%
there's an exception for 91a
and

02:20:41.670 --> 02:20:41.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:20:47.349 --> 02:20:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:49.590 --> 02:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not minimizing anything i i would
 
02:20:51.670 --> 02:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
stipulate that every criticism that's
 
02:20:53.750 --> 02:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
been made is a valid one
 
02:20:56.870 --> 02:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh i i'm just concerned of uh whether or
 
02:21:00.790 --> 02:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
not to use the legal terms the accused
 
02:21:02.950 --> 02:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
is going to have the opportunity to
 
02:21:05.670 --> 02:21:05.680 align:start position:0%
confront their accusers and and whether
 
02:21:07.750 --> 02:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
they have due process to introduce
 
02:21:09.510 --> 02:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
evidence on their behalf
 
02:21:11.429 --> 02:21:11.439 align:start position:0%
because it's it's sounding
 
02:21:12.550 --> 02:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
a little
 
02:21:14.790 --> 02:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
judicial and and
 
02:21:17.190 --> 02:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
in your maybe the experience of some
 
02:21:19.030 --> 02:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
folks who've been on this or you
 
02:21:20.950 --> 02:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
where where are we going with this if we
 
02:21:23.190 --> 02:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
if we were to step i'm asking the chair
 
02:21:26.309 --> 02:21:26.319 align:start position:0%
at this point if if we were to stipulate
 
02:21:29.190 --> 02:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
that every criticism criticism and
 
02:21:31.429 --> 02:21:31.439 align:start position:0%
concern were valid
 
02:21:33.510 --> 02:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
i would like to know
 
02:21:35.510 --> 02:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
what it is we're supposed to do with
 
02:21:37.110 --> 02:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
this information and
 
02:21:37.990 --> 02:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:21:39.670 --> 02:21:39.680 align:start position:0%
that was a question that the chair will
 
02:21:41.670 --> 02:21:41.680 align:start position:0%
take i'm just about ready to close the
 
02:21:43.910 --> 02:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
hearing for this reason
 
02:21:46.070 --> 02:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
we have presented
 
02:21:46.080 --> 02:21:47.590 align:start position:0%
we have presented
from

02:21:47.590 --> 02:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:21:50.070 --> 02:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
three different kinds of sources
 
02:21:52.309 --> 02:21:52.319 align:start position:0%
to get the big picture
 
02:21:54.469 --> 02:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
we're not a court
 
02:21:57.110 --> 02:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
nor are we a government agency with
 
02:21:57.120 --> 02:21:58.389 align:start position:0%
nor are we a government agency with
authority

02:21:58.389 --> 02:21:58.399 align:start position:0%
authority
 
02:22:00.230 --> 02:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
we're an oversight board
 
02:22:02.790 --> 02:22:02.800 align:start position:0%
and i think we've done it
 
02:22:05.190 --> 02:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
the question is where does all of this
 
02:22:05.200 --> 02:22:06.150 align:start position:0%
the question is where does all of this
go

02:22:06.150 --> 02:22:06.160 align:start position:0%
go
 
02:22:06.160 --> 02:22:07.510 align:start position:0%
go
next

02:22:07.510 --> 02:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
next
 
02:22:09.830 --> 02:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
i realize it's been in the process but i
 
02:22:12.550 --> 02:22:12.560 align:start position:0%
don't see it having been resolved yet
 
02:22:15.750 --> 02:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
and to be fair to the executive director
 
02:22:17.349 --> 02:22:17.359 align:start position:0%
to the former staff
 
02:22:19.910 --> 02:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
and to dr o'neill
 
02:22:22.389 --> 02:22:22.399 align:start position:0%
we've got to figure out as an oversight
 
02:22:22.399 --> 02:22:23.270 align:start position:0%
we've got to figure out as an oversight
board

02:22:23.270 --> 02:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
board
 
02:22:25.349 --> 02:22:25.359 align:start position:0%
with input i hope from the commissioner
 
02:22:27.270 --> 02:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
and a few others
 
02:22:29.270 --> 02:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
what do we recommend
 
02:22:29.280 --> 02:22:30.710 align:start position:0%
what do we recommend
next

02:22:30.710 --> 02:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
next
 
02:22:32.389 --> 02:22:32.399 align:start position:0%
so i realize not
 
02:22:35.590 --> 02:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
everyone here has testified but i think
 
02:22:37.830 --> 02:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
what we've got is enough
 
02:22:39.750 --> 02:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
to be able to
 
02:22:40.870 --> 02:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
make the best
 
02:22:43.830 --> 02:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
determination as we can about now what
 
02:22:43.840 --> 02:22:46.469 align:start position:0%
determination as we can about now what
so

02:22:46.469 --> 02:22:46.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:48.790 --> 02:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to hear not now and
 
02:22:51.270 --> 02:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
certainly not uh as a group
 
02:22:54.389 --> 02:22:54.399 align:start position:0%
uh from other members of oversight as to
 
02:22:56.309 --> 02:22:56.319 align:start position:0%
what you think and certainly from the
 
02:22:57.990 --> 02:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner and
 
02:23:00.070 --> 02:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
other parties with standing
 
02:23:03.670 --> 02:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
so with that i am closing the hearing on
 
02:23:06.150 --> 02:23:06.160 align:start position:0%
this particular item and indeed on
 
02:23:46.389 --> 02:23:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:46.399 --> 02:24:07.190 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:24:07.190 --> 02:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:26.830 --> 02:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:28.630 --> 02:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
um i'm going to look at if child care
 
02:24:31.270 --> 02:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
licensing did an investigation yeah so
 
02:24:33.670 --> 02:24:33.680 align:start position:0%
some of that so i think that met with
 
02:24:36.630 --> 02:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
them yeah so i need to go back and look
 
02:24:38.710 --> 02:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
at what their findings are from a
 
02:24:40.309 --> 02:24:40.319 align:start position:0%
licensing point of view there's a
 
02:24:50.790 --> 02:24:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:50.800 --> 02:24:59.590 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:24:59.590 --> 02:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:59.600 --> 02:25:15.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:25:15.030 --> 02:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:15.040 --> 02:25:25.830 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:25:25.830 --> 02:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:45.110 --> 02:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:45.120 --> 02:26:02.870 align:start position:0%
 
is

02:26:02.870 --> 02:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:27.750 --> 02:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:29.429 --> 02:26:29.439 align:start position:0%
but this conversation also just got
 
02:26:29.439 --> 02:26:44.469 align:start position:0%
but this conversation also just got
derailed

02:26:44.469 --> 02:26:44.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:44.479 --> 02:26:51.830 align:start position:0%
 
right

02:26:51.830 --> 02:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:53.990 --> 02:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to be talking about the
