number 3A the department of of
 
00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
education so this is 202
 
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 align:start position:0%
2441 this is on the um minimum standards
 
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.870 align:start position:0%
 
36.016222

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880 align:start position:0%
36.016222
 
00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
five on the agenda but it's 26 this is
 
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
the first half of the 306 rules there is
 
00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:55.039 align:start position:0%
a second half that has not been filed as
 
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
a final proposal yet what you have
 
00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:00.199 align:start position:0%
before you is a conditional approval
 
00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:03.479 align:start position:0%
and um it could be on consent I have no
 
00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
substantive comments I have one note to
 
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
Jael car about um there was a comment on
 
00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:11.479 align:start position:0%
the initial proposal about an in
 
00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
inadequate fiscal impact however after
 
00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080 align:start position:0%
further review uh we we saw that it was
 
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
a existing requirement that was already
 
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
in the rules and so it it made no change
 
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
to the fiscal impact so the impact
 
00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:26.639 align:start position:0%
statement was correct other than that I
 
00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
have no comments on this proposal
 
00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:31.599 align:start position:0%
all right thank
 
00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
you I do have two people who'd like to
 
00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.469 align:start position:0%
you I do have two people who'd like to
speak

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:37.479 align:start position:0%
speak
 
00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
um Christine Downing and David Trumble
 
00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:43.960 align:start position:0%
who each want five minutes I hope that
 
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:47.240 align:start position:0%
you will be able to focus your comments
 
00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
specifically on the
 
00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:52.520 align:start position:0%
rule of that you object to and not just
 
00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:54.280 align:start position:0%
saying I don't like the whole thing
 
00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
because that doesn't help us to decide
 
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:00.360 align:start position:0%
if this is a legitimate rule or not um
 
00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:18.790 align:start position:0%
if this is a legitimate rule or not um
Mr

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:30.189 --> 00:07:30.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:31.960 align:start position:0%
good morning Madame chairwoman and
 
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
committee members thank you for having
 
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
me my name is David Trumble I'm from the
 
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:37.560 align:start position:0%
town aware I have a couple of concerns
 
00:07:40.029 --> 00:07:40.039 align:start position:0%
about these regulations first I'd like
 
00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:41.240 align:start position:0%
to go back to
 
00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
1981 when RSA 541a was Rewritten the
 
00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:48.520 align:start position:0%
legislature sent a request to the
 
00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:50.479 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court for an opinion of the
 
00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
justices on the Constitutional aspects
 
00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
the court wrote back that re
 
00:07:58.149 --> 00:07:58.159 align:start position:0%
administrative agencies can only fill in
 
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:00.360 align:start position:0%
the details they can't had to subtract
 
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
from or in any way modify a law they
 
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
can't substitute their judgment for the
 
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
legislature the reason for that is
 
00:08:09.189 --> 00:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
separation of powers because the only
 
00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:10.840 align:start position:0%
branch of government that can make the
 
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
rules is the legislature not the
 
00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:14.680 align:start position:0%
executive branch so I'd like to look at
 
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
two statutes in particular that I think
 
00:08:18.469 --> 00:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
these regulations run a follow of first
 
00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:22.720 align:start position:0%
is 193 EB when that came about and was
 
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
updated in 2007 it was a direct result
 
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
of the London dery decision in the in
 
00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:29.960 align:start position:0%
the statement of purpose of the piece of
 
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:31.800 align:start position:0%
legislation the general court said that
 
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
we embrace our duty to live up to the
 
00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:36.320 align:start position:0%
Constitutional duty to fund the public
 
00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:38.680 align:start position:0%
schools and it's through this statute
 
00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:40.760 align:start position:0%
that we're going to Define how we how we
 
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:42.360 align:start position:0%
do accountability how do we tell the
 
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire that we're
 
00:08:46.829 --> 00:08:46.839 align:start position:0%
living up to this Duty and they laid out
 
00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:49.640 align:start position:0%
a rather long set of details the most
 
00:08:50.949 --> 00:08:50.959 align:start position:0%
important part is that in the first
 
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
sentence of that statute they said it
 
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:55.480 align:start position:0%
has to be inputs and outputs based in
 
00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
other words we don't get accountability
 
00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
by is a student making progress we do it
 
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
by inputs do we have classes and
 
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
teachers and resources just as much that
 
00:09:08.069 --> 00:09:08.079 align:start position:0%
has to be part of what makes
 
00:09:10.069 --> 00:09:10.079 align:start position:0%
accountability these regulations
 
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:12.040 align:start position:0%
diminish the inputs part of the
 
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:13.480 align:start position:0%
regulations and I'll get into that when
 
00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
I get to the RS the other statute I'd
 
00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
ask you to look at is
 
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
18924 the standard School statute which
 
00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:23.000 align:start position:0%
was written in 1919 but still in effect
 
00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:25.000 align:start position:0%
today was just amended in the last
 
00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:27.560 align:start position:0%
decade that requires buildings classes
 
00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
with Furnitures teachers in instruction
 
00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:32.600 align:start position:0%
this is how we Define inputs in this
 
00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:34.959 align:start position:0%
state buildings classes teachers with
 
00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:36.920 align:start position:0%
materials and instruction those things
 
00:09:39.069 --> 00:09:39.079 align:start position:0%
are removed from these regulations so
 
00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:40.760 align:start position:0%
let's look first at the current
 
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
regulations the current regulations
 
00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:45.160 align:start position:0%
Define class size they use the word
 
00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:48.200 align:start position:0%
class size they specifically reference
 
00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
teachers who teach and give you
 
00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:53.720 align:start position:0%
mandatory shell numbers of teachers they
 
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
also reference specifically each School
 
00:09:59.509 --> 00:09:59.519 align:start position:0%
shall have instructional programs and
 
00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
Define instructional time is that which
 
00:10:03.389 --> 00:10:03.399 align:start position:0%
is under the supervision of an educator
 
00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
which used to be defined as a teacher
 
00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
the proposed regulations eviscerate
 
00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:09.880 align:start position:0%
these regs so first of all let's look at
 
00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
class size they take out the requirement
 
00:10:14.829 --> 00:10:14.839 align:start position:0%
for class size they take out the word
 
00:10:17.509 --> 00:10:17.519 align:start position:0%
class instead they have teacher uh
 
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
student educator ratios there's no
 
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:22.720 align:start position:0%
requirement that there must be this
 
00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
number of Educators there's no penalty
 
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
if they don't excuse me sir yes ma'am
 
00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I don't think think that you
 
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
are looking at the um final version of
 
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
these rules cu the class sizes are are
 
00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:38.200 align:start position:0%
in the rule I they're in the conditional
 
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
approval they're in the final proposal
 
00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:42.440 align:start position:0%
and in the conditional approval could
 
00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:45.200 align:start position:0%
you yes I noticed that that was changed
 
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
between the interim and the final and
 
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
the conditional approval request so if
 
00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
you could make sure that that you're
 
00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:54.160 align:start position:0%
talking about the latest version because
 
00:10:57.389 --> 00:10:57.399 align:start position:0%
I know that the the board of education
 
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
has revised that section due to public
 
00:11:03.389 --> 00:11:03.399 align:start position:0%
comments at previous levels I'm
 
00:11:05.949 --> 00:11:05.959 align:start position:0%
referencing I went on to the doe website
 
00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:08.360 align:start position:0%
last night under what's final proposal
 
00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:11.560 align:start position:0%
August 14 2024 is that's the one that
 
00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
we're referencing
 
00:11:16.949 --> 00:11:16.959 align:start position:0%
no is
 
00:11:20.069 --> 00:11:20.079 align:start position:0%
I there is a conditional approval

conditional approval request is
 
00:11:41.069 --> 00:11:41.079 align:start position:0%
September 12th you're correct I'd like
 
00:11:43.949 --> 00:11:43.959 align:start position:0%
to ask a question yes if you could refer
 
00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:46.120 align:start position:0%
could you tell us what number in the in
 
00:11:48.269 --> 00:11:48.279 align:start position:0%
the rules that you're reading okay could
 
00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
you tell us what number you're looking
 
00:11:55.829 --> 00:11:55.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:59.710 --> 00:11:59.720 align:start position:0%
you 36 that's the one yeah that's the
 
00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
one I'm looking at in the current one
 
00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:03.240 align:start position:0%
the previous one was
 
00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
30615 and
 
00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:10.240 align:start position:0%
30617 which was called class size and Sh
 
00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
had the word shall and he had to have
 
00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:15.720 align:start position:0%
Educators with class size requirements
 
00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
referenced later that that provision
 
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:20.720 align:start position:0%
that you had to have the local school
 
00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
board shall require that each school
 
00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
provides Educators with class- siiz
 
00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:26.920 align:start position:0%
requirements I believe that's still not
 
00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
in the it was certainly taken out in the
 
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:32.720 align:start position:0%
August one it's on page 12 of the
 
00:12:35.269 --> 00:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
conditional approval it's
 
00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
30614 paragraph a uh the local school
 
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
board shall establish student educator
 
00:12:43.269 --> 00:12:43.279 align:start position:0%
educator ratios to promote student
 
00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:44.920 align:start position:0%
learning for each learning opportunity
 
00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:46.680 align:start position:0%
and learning level based upon school
 
00:12:49.389 --> 00:12:49.399 align:start position:0%
safety policies content instructional
 
00:12:51.269 --> 00:12:51.279 align:start position:0%
method the characteristics of Learners
 
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
and the following for kindergarten
 
00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:55.880 align:start position:0%
through grade two 25 students or fewer
 
00:12:59.470 --> 00:12:59.480 align:start position:0%

middle school and high school 30
 
00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:05.720 align:start position:0%
students or fewer per educator that's
 
00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
exactly the same as it was on August
 
00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
14th excuse so that that has not been
 
00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
changed since the August
 
00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:14.920 align:start position:0%
14th uh version it was added back into
 
00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:17.509 align:start position:0%
14th uh version it was added back into
the

00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:17.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
proposal I'm I'm I'm looking at the
 
00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:21.720 align:start position:0%
August 14th one and and that's that's in
 
00:13:23.949 --> 00:13:23.959 align:start position:0%
there which what you just read word for
 
00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
word is what's in the August 14th one
 
00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
representative fellow has a question
 
00:13:30.949 --> 00:13:30.959 align:start position:0%
thank you um I'm representative fellows
 
00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
I worked at the Department of Education
 
00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
for 30 years and class size is not the
 
00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
same as educator student ratio class
 
00:13:43.949 --> 00:13:43.959 align:start position:0%
size means how many students are sitting
 
00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:47.000 align:start position:0%
in a room when a class is being taught
 
00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:50.600 align:start position:0%
the ratio is a completely different
 
00:13:53.829 --> 00:13:53.839 align:start position:0%
number um for decades the Department of
 
00:13:56.749 --> 00:13:56.759 align:start position:0%
Education has been publishing numbers
 
00:14:00.749 --> 00:14:00.759 align:start position:0%
that are tell you the average class size
 
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
in a particular District or school um
 
00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:06.949 align:start position:0%
in a particular District or school um
education

00:14:06.949 --> 00:14:06.959 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:14:10.509 --> 00:14:10.519 align:start position:0%
education educator ratio if it's
 
00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
published it is totally not the same um
 
00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:18.120 align:start position:0%
statistic and your question
 
00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:22.600 align:start position:0%
is I'm wondering why the attorneys think
 
00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
it seems to be
 
00:14:27.389 --> 00:14:27.399 align:start position:0%
synonymous would the department like to
 
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
answer that yeah um could you please
 
00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:37.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:39.389 --> 00:14:39.399 align:start position:0%
yourself Julie Shay administrative rules
 
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
coordinator for the Department of
 
00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
Education if you continue to read that
 
00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:45.519 align:start position:0%
further you'll see that it says that it
 
00:14:48.189 --> 00:14:48.199 align:start position:0%
that as long as these schools shall
 
00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
strive to have a class size of 20 or or
 
00:14:56.749 --> 00:14:56.759 align:start position:0%
fewer so it does use class size in each
 
00:14:58.590 --> 00:14:58.600 align:start position:0%
section so it talks about the student
 
00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:00.680 align:start position:0%
educator ratio and then it goes further
 
00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:04.160 align:start position:0%
to say that the class size is is the
 
00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:08.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:11.720 align:start position:0%
that representative hackin Phillips
 
00:15:14.509 --> 00:15:14.519 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair is it also true uh
 
00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
miss Shay that the definition for
 
00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:18.440 align:start position:0%
educator has changed whereas the
 
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
existing rule used to just include
 
00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.350 align:start position:0%
existing rule used to just include
teachers

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:22.360 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:24.680 align:start position:0%
administrators uh in one other addition
 
00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:26.519 align:start position:0%
but now under the new definition there's
 
00:15:29.389 --> 00:15:29.399 align:start position:0%
several more um possible pair of
 
00:15:30.829 --> 00:15:30.839 align:start position:0%
professionals who could be included
 
00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:32.120 align:start position:0%
under the term
 
00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:36.040 align:start position:0%
educator so in fact um the class size of
 
00:15:40.069 --> 00:15:40.079 align:start position:0%
uh the ratio could affect um how many
 
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
students to actual teachers are in the
 
00:15:45.389 --> 00:15:45.399 align:start position:0%
room because of the definition of
 
00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:48.040 align:start position:0%
educator is expanded to include those
 
00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
who do not hold a teaching certificate
 
00:15:52.829 --> 00:15:52.839 align:start position:0%
or license under the state that there
 
00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
could be you know for instance a teacher
 
00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:02.920 align:start position:0%
and um you know special ed or um like a
 
00:16:05.389 --> 00:16:05.399 align:start position:0%
pair professional who's designated to
 
00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:07.160 align:start position:0%
one or two students in the classroom but
 
00:16:09.509 --> 00:16:09.519 align:start position:0%
because now there are two adults in the
 
00:16:12.749 --> 00:16:12.759 align:start position:0%
room that there could be more students
 
00:16:15.509 --> 00:16:15.519 align:start position:0%
per this new definition of
 
00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:20.120 align:start position:0%
ratio um can I address that please I I
 
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
was but going to be my next point which
 
00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
was under the existing reg an educator
 
00:16:28.629 --> 00:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
is a teacher or a specialist or a sta or
 
00:16:28.639 --> 00:16:29.870 align:start position:0%
is a teacher or a specialist or a sta or
or

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:16:33.309 --> 00:16:33.319 align:start position:0%
administrator 25 to one every classroom
 
00:16:35.269 --> 00:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
in the state just about has got one par
 
00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
of professional in it but you have to
 
00:16:39.389 --> 00:16:39.399 align:start position:0%
have one teacher for those 25 students
 
00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:42.360 align:start position:0%
under these regulations if it's educator
 
00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
you could have 50 students in that
 
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
classroom one teacher and one perah who
 
00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
could be assigned as a one-on-one to one
 
00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:51.160 align:start position:0%
student which means you basically have
 
00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
49 to1 that would be acceptable under
 
00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:56.120 align:start position:0%
this set of
 
00:16:59.670 --> 00:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
regulations thank you for your answer um
 
00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
Senator Whitley yeah I I had another
 
00:17:03.509 --> 00:17:03.519 align:start position:0%
question for the Department of Ed Too on
 
00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:06.760 align:start position:0%
that issue um if I may so um she
 
00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:09.039 align:start position:0%
reference the issue the language about
 
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
strive to ha to have but I think that's
 
00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
clear um wouldn't you agree that strive
 
00:17:16.429 --> 00:17:16.439 align:start position:0%
to have is very different than having a
 
00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:20.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
correct I'm gonna go reference I think
 
00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:23.400 align:start position:0%
that this
 
00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:43.789 --> 00:17:43.799 align:start position:0%
so looking at this
 
00:17:46.789 --> 00:17:46.799 align:start position:0%
rule y so for the record Frank G
 
00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of education and I may call
 
00:17:49.549 --> 00:17:49.559 align:start position:0%
on Julie to help me understand some of
 
00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:51.480 align:start position:0%
the changes that we've made so this was
 
00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
the language that we worked very closely
 
00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:55.720 align:start position:0%
with uh a number of the various advocacy
 
00:17:58.830 --> 00:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
groups to try and um develop uh some
 
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
something that would meet everybody's
 
00:18:05.149 --> 00:18:05.159 align:start position:0%
expectations um the original rule said
 
00:18:07.149 --> 00:18:07.159 align:start position:0%
uh it know was focused on kindergarden
 
00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
grades um two through 25 students or
 
00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
fewer per educator provided that the
 
00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:14.600 align:start position:0%
school shall strive to achieve a class
 
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
size of 20 students so that language is
 
00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
the exact same language that existed
 
00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
already in the rule and we did not
 
00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
change that at
 
00:18:25.789 --> 00:18:25.799 align:start position:0%
all so that excuse me commissioner so
 
00:18:28.149 --> 00:18:28.159 align:start position:0%
you're you're confirming that that is
 
00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:29.640 align:start position:0%
the current
 
00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
class siiz rule that is effective right
 
00:18:33.789 --> 00:18:33.799 align:start position:0%
now today that's correct I can I mean
 
00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:36.200 align:start position:0%
and it says right in there it says I'm
 
00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
reading from the current rule that's in
 
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
effect not the proposed rule um you know
 
00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
grades two um uh 25 students or fewer
 
00:18:46.669 --> 00:18:46.679 align:start position:0%
per educator provide that each School
 
00:18:48.669 --> 00:18:48.679 align:start position:0%
shall strive to achieve a class di of 20
 
00:18:50.669 --> 00:18:50.679 align:start position:0%
students or fewer per character so we've
 
00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
kept the same language that already
 
00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
exists in the same
 
00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:57.400 align:start position:0%
statute and the current rule does in
 
00:18:59.270 --> 00:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
fact say educator
 
00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
correct followup please yes but but it's
 
00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
it's the case that what was changed was
 
00:19:08.549 --> 00:19:08.559 align:start position:0%
the language from cap to ratio isn't
 
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
that correct so but it says ratio in the
 
00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:14.440 align:start position:0%
uh title because what we've done is in
 
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
the introductory so the only thing
 
00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:18.200 align:start position:0%
that's changed in this rule is that in
 
00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
the introduction we introduce a concept
 
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
of how you would develop student
 
00:19:26.909 --> 00:19:26.919 align:start position:0%
educator ratios so it initially just
 
00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
talked only about the class siiz
 
00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:30.520 align:start position:0%
language and so what we've added to it
 
00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:32.720 align:start position:0%
is that local Schoolboard shall
 
00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
establish student educator ratios that
 
00:19:35.909 --> 00:19:35.919 align:start position:0%
promote student learning for each
 
00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:38.120 align:start position:0%
learning opportunity and learning level
 
00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:40.600 align:start position:0%
based upon and these are the inputs into
 
00:19:42.669 --> 00:19:42.679 align:start position:0%
determining the ratios that you would
 
00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
have of safety policies content
 
00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
instructional method and characteristics
 
00:19:50.549 --> 00:19:50.559 align:start position:0%
of Learners and then we kept the exact
 
00:19:53.149 --> 00:19:53.159 align:start position:0%
same language relative to class size and
 
00:19:55.669 --> 00:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
did not modify that at all and the
 
00:19:57.149 --> 00:19:57.159 align:start position:0%
objective here that we were after is
 
00:19:58.750 --> 00:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
really there's the balance on the other
 
00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
side as well um because quite frankly if
 
00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:05.039 align:start position:0%
you have excuse me if you have a class
 
00:20:07.789 --> 00:20:07.799 align:start position:0%
of you know second graders that are
 
00:20:11.149 --> 00:20:11.159 align:start position:0%
struggling readers 20 or 25 may be too
 
00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
many and so what we've tried to
 
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
introduce is this concept like you
 
00:20:16.669 --> 00:20:16.679 align:start position:0%
really need to look at you know
 
00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
considering safety policies you know
 
00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:19.960 align:start position:0%
what is the nature of the kids that
 
00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:21.400 align:start position:0%
you're working with are you working with
 
00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:23.000 align:start position:0%
a bunch of autistic children or
 
00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
something that need more support uh the
 
00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:27.320 align:start position:0%
content that's being taught the
 
00:20:29.149 --> 00:20:29.159 align:start position:0%
instructional method and characteristics
 
00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
of the learning so if you're in a second
 
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
grade class and you have you know 20
 
00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
struggling readers that's too many and
 
00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
so what we've tried to say is here's the
 
00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
minimum class sizes this is what you got
 
00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:42.520 align:start position:0%
to basically strive for the maximum
 
00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:45.320 align:start position:0%
class sizes but before you just default
 
00:20:48.149 --> 00:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
to 20 struggling readers in a class
 
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
consider safety content instructional
 
00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:52.200 align:start position:0%
method and characteristics of the
 
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
Learners so we've not changed the class
 
00:20:58.430 --> 00:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
size requirement at all what we've added
 
00:21:00.789 --> 00:21:00.799 align:start position:0%
is is guidance to the schools in terms
 
00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:03.240 align:start position:0%
of trying to understand who's in front
 
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
of you before you just default to a
 
00:21:07.909 --> 00:21:07.919 align:start position:0%
certain um you know maximum class size
 
00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:09.320 align:start position:0%
number which we believe is better
 
00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:11.480 align:start position:0%
pedagogy yeah so just to confirm you did
 
00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:13.320 align:start position:0%
remove the cap language so now there is
 
00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
no cap no no that's not not the case
 
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
there is no cap that was removed we we
 
00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
the the existing language says
 
00:21:22.669 --> 00:21:22.679 align:start position:0%
kindergarten grade 2 25 students or
 
00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:24.200 align:start position:0%
fewer per educator provided that each
 
00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:26.360 align:start position:0%
School shall strive to achieve the class
 
00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
size of 20 students or fewer per
 
00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:29.230 align:start position:0%
size of 20 students or fewer per
educator

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:29.240 align:start position:0%
educator
 
00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:32.360 align:start position:0%
the current proposal says the exact same
 
00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:35.080 align:start position:0%
language there was not changed at all no
 
00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:38.600 align:start position:0%
words were changed at all I think she
 
00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative fellows so
 
00:21:44.269 --> 00:21:44.279 align:start position:0%
I just want to explain don't lose my
 
00:21:46.789 --> 00:21:46.799 align:start position:0%
page that what you
 
00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:51.080 align:start position:0%
see under a is not what it says in the
 
00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
current language the current language
 
00:21:57.390 --> 00:21:57.400 align:start position:0%
under the line a says class size for
 
00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
instructional purposes is in each School
 
00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
shall be thank you and then under that
 
00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
is one two and three which is exactly
 
00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
what you were looking at thank you
 
00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:12.520 align:start position:0%
represent fellows then B what you see is
 
00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:17.240 align:start position:0%
is B in here did not exist in the um
 
00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
does not exist in the current I'm
 
00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
calling them current you know rules
 
00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
they're the currently effective rules
 
00:22:25.669 --> 00:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
yes so I would just want to clarify so B
 
00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
does exist in the current rule the
 
00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
current rule says that you know class
 
00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
size requirement may be exceeded for
 
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
study halls band course other types of
 
00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
large group instruction including but
 
00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
not limited to lectures combined group
 
00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:40.360 align:start position:0%
instruction and showing of educational
 
00:22:42.029 --> 00:22:42.039 align:start position:0%
television and films and the current one
 
00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
still says student education ratios may
 
00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:47.080 align:start position:0%
be exceeded for study halls bands chorus
 
00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:49.480 align:start position:0%
so we basically kept the same language
 
00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:52.559 align:start position:0%
in there thank you representative Lam
 
00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:54.440 align:start position:0%
has a question um yes thank you madam
 
00:22:57.269 --> 00:22:57.279 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you commissioner um as
 
00:22:59.430 --> 00:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
I'm reading this the add language that
 
00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
you added appears to accommodate for
 
00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
conditions like my mother dealt with in
 
00:23:05.149 --> 00:23:05.159 align:start position:0%
her third grade classroom where she had
 
00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:07.240 align:start position:0%
some students who came in with no
 
00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:09.880 align:start position:0%
concept of a written language and many
 
00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
others that were performing at
 
00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:12.440 align:start position:0%
kindergarten reading level even though
 
00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
they were in third grade is does this
 
00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:17.080 align:start position:0%
provide for a justification for smaller
 
00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:19.240 align:start position:0%
class sizes when it's necessary because
 
00:23:21.029 --> 00:23:21.039 align:start position:0%
it says that it needs to deal with the
 
00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
student learning opportunity and
 
00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:24.640 align:start position:0%
learning level so of course that's the
 
00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:26.600 align:start position:0%
point is that basically we want our
 
00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
Educators when you're setting the class
 
00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:29.230 align:start position:0%
Educators when you're setting the class
side

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:29.240 align:start position:0%
side
 
00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
to not start with just some number and
 
00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:35.080 align:start position:0%
say like okay we can have 25 students in
 
00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:36.520 align:start position:0%
a class we're going to have 25 students
 
00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
in the class you may need to have fewer
 
00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
students um they were previously allowed
 
00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
to have fewer students now we've listed
 
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
some criteria that should be considered
 
00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
when deciding whether you want to have a
 
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
a different ratio thank you but you
 
00:23:52.029 --> 00:23:52.039 align:start position:0%
still can't exceed it thank you
 
00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
representative hacken Phillips thank you
 
00:23:57.390 --> 00:23:57.400 align:start position:0%
um Madam chair I'm just wondering for
 
00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:00.440 align:start position:0%
purposes of the the gel car committee um
 
00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
internal discussions um if someone could
 
00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:05.039 align:start position:0%
please point to the legislation that's
 
00:24:07.789 --> 00:24:07.799 align:start position:0%
been passed since the last rule adoption
 
00:24:11.549 --> 00:24:11.559 align:start position:0%
that um is directing us to change the
 
00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
definitions of class size educator and
 
00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
move to the class ratio
 
00:24:20.029 --> 00:24:20.039 align:start position:0%
model so so just to be clear okay this
 
00:24:22.909 --> 00:24:22.919 align:start position:0%
is for you that was a question
 
00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:25.000 align:start position:0%
too um
 
00:24:27.909 --> 00:24:27.919 align:start position:0%
the the statute if I understand
 
00:24:27.919 --> 00:24:29.029 align:start position:0%
the the statute if I understand
correctly

00:24:29.029 --> 00:24:29.039 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
educator and the definition for educator
 
00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:38.120 align:start position:0%
in the statute is the same one that's in
 
00:24:41.909 --> 00:24:41.919 align:start position:0%
this rule is that correct I believe
 
00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:45.320 align:start position:0%
so so which statute are you referring to
 
00:24:47.269 --> 00:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
because I'm not familiar with a request
 
00:24:49.789 --> 00:24:49.799 align:start position:0%
to change the definition of
 
00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:52.600 align:start position:0%
educator so so we've not changed any
 
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
definitions the only changes that we've
 
00:24:55.789 --> 00:24:55.799 align:start position:0%
made in here is to try and make sure
 
00:24:57.909 --> 00:24:57.919 align:start position:0%
that we're aligning any statutory
 
00:24:59.590 --> 00:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
definition and this is input that we got
 
00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
from the legislative oversight committee
 
00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:03.080 align:start position:0%
as well any definition that we've used
 
00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:04.600 align:start position:0%
in here if there is a statutory
 
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
definition we've adopted it into this
 
00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
rule so that the previous rules had a
 
00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
different definition than the statute if
 
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
understanding director
 
00:25:22.669 --> 00:25:22.679 align:start position:0%
moral not answering that question but to
 
00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
answer representative hackin Phillips if
 
00:25:28.389 --> 00:25:28.399 align:start position:0%
a statutory if a statutory definition
 
00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
exists then that has to be used in the
 
00:25:35.549 --> 00:25:35.559 align:start position:0%
rules Madam chair I don't think Madam
 
00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
chair I would like to move a preliminary
 
00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:40.520 align:start position:0%
objection on this issue um I think
 
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
there's a whole host of reasons why
 
00:25:44.669 --> 00:25:44.679 align:start position:0%
these rules are uh contrary to public
 
00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:46.360 align:start position:0%
interest which is a clear basis in the
 
00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:49.000 align:start position:0%
statute for an objection I think for
 
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
three years at least parents
 
00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
students Educators have raised these
 
00:25:56.789 --> 00:25:56.799 align:start position:0%
exact same concerns that we are
 
00:25:58.669 --> 00:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
addressing today and the confusion
 
00:26:02.149 --> 00:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
abounds and so you know I I feel like in
 
00:26:03.669 --> 00:26:03.679 align:start position:0%
addition to contrary to the public
 
00:26:05.909 --> 00:26:05.919 align:start position:0%
interest because of a whole host of
 
00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
problems that it could cause for
 
00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:11.480 align:start position:0%
property poor districts uh the input
 
00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
that was provided to the board of
 
00:26:15.149 --> 00:26:15.159 align:start position:0%
education and the Department of
 
00:26:18.029 --> 00:26:18.039 align:start position:0%
Education really was not Incorporated um
 
00:26:19.549 --> 00:26:19.559 align:start position:0%
you know there are other problems with
 
00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
these rules in addition to the class
 
00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:23.720 align:start position:0%
size I'm just speaking to my motion um
 
00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:26.840 align:start position:0%
so you know there there's volumes of of
 
00:26:28.549 --> 00:26:28.559 align:start position:0%
of opposition to this that was been
 
00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:30.799 align:start position:0%
considered you know this is this is
 
00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
going to result as the evidence was
 
00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:34.360 align:start position:0%
submitted this is going to result in
 
00:26:36.389 --> 00:26:36.399 align:start position:0%
potentially schools and Property Port
 
00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
districts could see a dramatic increase
 
00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:41.080 align:start position:0%
um in class sizes due to sort of
 
00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:44.279 align:start position:0%
pressure on school boards um you know I
 
00:26:46.029 --> 00:26:46.039 align:start position:0%
think we really need to consider the
 
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
public interest here particularly for
 
00:26:50.029 --> 00:26:50.039 align:start position:0%
those students who you know we we know
 
00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
in our schools we have increasingly
 
00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
complicated academic and mental health
 
00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:55.320 align:start position:0%
needs if you're going to potentially
 
00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
increase class sizes that's going to you
 
00:26:59.389 --> 00:26:59.399 align:start position:0%
know lead to a situation where
 
00:27:02.149 --> 00:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
individual needs are not met that's one
 
00:27:03.669 --> 00:27:03.679 align:start position:0%
reason why this rule does not serve the
 
00:27:05.389 --> 00:27:05.399 align:start position:0%
public interest which is a clear uh
 
00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
basis for um for an objection the other
 
00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:10.840 align:start position:0%
which we haven't talked about the basis
 
00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
is uh we are shifting from courses to
 
00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:15.200 align:start position:0%
learning opportunities we can have a
 
00:27:17.549 --> 00:27:17.559 align:start position:0%
further conversation excuse that's a
 
00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
basis for the objection your objection
 
00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
is on this specific section is that
 
00:27:24.789 --> 00:27:24.799 align:start position:0%
correct I have I so I'm I my my
 
00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:27.640 align:start position:0%
objection is based on the statutory um
 
00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:29.240 align:start position:0%
objection that is contrary to public
 
00:27:31.389 --> 00:27:31.399 align:start position:0%
interest and I was going through why so
 
00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:33.240 align:start position:0%
one is the class size section the other
 
00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
is the shifting from courses to learning
 
00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:38.120 align:start position:0%
opportunities which I can just clarify
 
00:27:40.549 --> 00:27:40.559 align:start position:0%
to to clarify the question that was
 
00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
asked there is no statutory definition
 
00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:45.880 align:start position:0%
of educator we just did a search we
 
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
cannot find one that means that the
 
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
department has the ability to set the
 
00:27:54.509 --> 00:27:54.519 align:start position:0%
the definition of educator they did
 
00:27:57.149 --> 00:27:57.159 align:start position:0%
change it from the previous rule it is a
 
00:27:59.110 --> 00:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
different definition but it is not a
 
00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
statutory definition if it was a
 
00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:03.080 align:start position:0%
statutory definition they would have to
 
00:28:04.789 --> 00:28:04.799 align:start position:0%
use that definition but it is not
 
00:28:07.029 --> 00:28:07.039 align:start position:0%
defined in the statute so just to be
 
00:28:08.909 --> 00:28:08.919 align:start position:0%
clear on
 
00:28:12.269 --> 00:28:12.279 align:start position:0%
that yes director moral um I think a
 
00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
motion at this point would be
 
00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:17.039 align:start position:0%
premature the reason being committee
 
00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
rules require an opportunity for public
 
00:28:22.509 --> 00:28:22.519 align:start position:0%
testimony and for the agency to
 
00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:25.640 align:start position:0%
testy so so if I can I just we will we
 
00:28:27.669 --> 00:28:27.679 align:start position:0%
will hold off on dealing with this
 
00:28:27.679 --> 00:28:29.470 align:start position:0%
will hold off on dealing with this
motion

00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:29.480 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:31.960 align:start position:0%
which hasn't had a second yet and so we
 
00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:35.080 align:start position:0%
will let the agency respond to the
 
00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
comment by Senator Whitley okay and I'm
 
00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
G I'll also just clarify here so the
 
00:28:41.269 --> 00:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
change to the definition of
 
00:28:45.389 --> 00:28:45.399 align:start position:0%
educator um was in the old rule it made
 
00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
reference to RSA
 
00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
18939 which only included superintendent
 
00:28:53.909 --> 00:28:53.919 align:start position:0%
superintendent so it the the old rule
 
00:28:56.789 --> 00:28:56.799 align:start position:0%
had an incorrect citation to the statute
 
00:28:59.110 --> 00:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
so we've not made a substantive change
 
00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:01.720 align:start position:0%
we've made a technical correction to it
 
00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
if you look at the old definition versus
 
00:29:06.149 --> 00:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
the new definition um and Senator
 
00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:07.640 align:start position:0%
Whitley I just think it's an incorrect
 
00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:10.760 align:start position:0%
characterization that says that uh this
 
00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
would allow for unlimited class size in
 
00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:16.600 align:start position:0%
fact this rule was from the initial
 
00:29:17.909 --> 00:29:17.919 align:start position:0%
proposal was
 
00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
modified specifically based upon that
 
00:29:23.909 --> 00:29:23.919 align:start position:0%
public input to provide class-size
 
00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:25.960 align:start position:0%
limitations as we've just explained and
 
00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:27.880 align:start position:0%
those are in this rule so I think it's
 
00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:29.360 align:start position:0%
an incorrect characterization to say
 
00:29:31.029 --> 00:29:31.039 align:start position:0%
that there are no class siiz limitations
 
00:29:33.149 --> 00:29:33.159 align:start position:0%
because they're very clearly enumerated
 
00:29:35.269 --> 00:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
in the in the rule
 
00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
set thank
 
00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
you okay Madam chairwoman can I comment
 
00:29:44.549 --> 00:29:44.559 align:start position:0%
please I'd like to respond to two things
 
00:29:46.669 --> 00:29:46.679 align:start position:0%
that the commissioner said he he said
 
00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
that they didn't make any changes
 
00:29:50.149 --> 00:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
there's two important changes that were
 
00:29:52.789 --> 00:29:52.799 align:start position:0%
made one is this issue of educator it
 
00:29:54.669 --> 00:29:54.679 align:start position:0%
may be in their point of view a
 
00:29:57.149 --> 00:29:57.159 align:start position:0%
technical correction but it changes the
 
00:29:59.630 --> 00:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
impact of how the regulations play out
 
00:30:01.909 --> 00:30:01.919 align:start position:0%
in the real world because right now you
 
00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
need one teacher for every 25 students
 
00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
under the way these regulations are
 
00:30:08.549 --> 00:30:08.559 align:start position:0%
currently worded you could have one
 
00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:11.240 align:start position:0%
teacher and one perah for 50 students
 
00:30:13.029 --> 00:30:13.039 align:start position:0%
it's it's more than a technical
 
00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
correction the second thing is that if
 
00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:17.480 align:start position:0%
you look back two sections before the
 
00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
numbers section where you have the 1 to
 
00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:22.360 align:start position:0%
25 the previous set of rules which had
 
00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
been in effect until just a moment ago
 
00:30:27.389 --> 00:30:27.399 align:start position:0%
says to carry out the educational
 
00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
program established by these rules the
 
00:30:31.549 --> 00:30:31.559 align:start position:0%
local school board shall require that
 
00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:34.240 align:start position:0%
each school provides Educators in
 
00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:36.200 align:start position:0%
accordance with class siiz requirements
 
00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:36.950 align:start position:0%
accordance with class siiz requirements
in

00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
30617 that has been stricken from the
 
00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:41.240 align:start position:0%
one that was written in August and I
 
00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
don't think it's in the brief chance I
 
00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:45.240 align:start position:0%
had to look at the one from September
 
00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
that precedes other words the number
 
00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
section is the number section but the
 
00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
section that came right before it said
 
00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:52.760 align:start position:0%
You shall do what's in the number
 
00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
section so the shall do part was
 
00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
stripped and the numbers part was
 
00:30:59.549 --> 00:30:59.559 align:start position:0%
changed the effect of those two changes
 
00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:01.000 align:start position:0%
is to mean that you could have 50
 
00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:03.080 align:start position:0%
children in a classroom with one teacher
 
00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:05.320 align:start position:0%
and one parah under the the rules that
 
00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:07.240 align:start position:0%
are being proposed that would not be
 
00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
acceptable in the status
 
00:31:13.149 --> 00:31:13.159 align:start position:0%
quo thank you okay I have one more point
 
00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
that I didn't get to get to we kind of
 
00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
got a bunch of others people speaking
 
00:31:18.389 --> 00:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
can I please make my my second your last
 
00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
point please okay so the first was class
 
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
siiz the second is the issue of
 
00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:24.440 align:start position:0%
instructional program and again I go
 
00:31:26.909 --> 00:31:26.919 align:start position:0%
back to RSA 189 that says there has to
 
00:31:29.269 --> 00:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
be instruction that's a statute it was
 
00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:33.080 align:start position:0%
required 193e set up how do we measure
 
00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
accountability it's instruction based
 
00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:37.480 align:start position:0%
it's there's a long whole section in
 
00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:41.080 align:start position:0%
there the current regulations I'm I'm
 
00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
using current for meaning the ones that
 
00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
have been in effect for the last 10
 
00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:46.120 align:start position:0%
years in section 26 which is
 
00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
kindergarten through 8th grade and then
 
00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
the next section which is high school
 
00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
reads simply the local school board
 
00:31:53.149 --> 00:31:53.159 align:start position:0%
shall require that in each school there
 
00:31:55.669 --> 00:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
is an instructional program that
 
00:31:58.149 --> 00:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
includes and then methods and strategy
 
00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
for teaching you have to have an
 
00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:01.960 align:start position:0%
instructional program in the present
 
00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:04.799 align:start position:0%
system and that must include teaching
 
00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
you have to have teachers who teach RSA
 
00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
189 says they must be teachers who teach
 
00:32:13.629 --> 00:32:13.639 align:start position:0%
these regulations remove that they took
 
00:32:15.909 --> 00:32:15.919 align:start position:0%
out the word instructional progam please
 
00:32:17.909 --> 00:32:17.919 align:start position:0%
point to the part in the current in the
 
00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
rule under
 
00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:22.120 align:start position:0%
consideration you made that change okay
 
00:32:24.269 --> 00:32:24.279 align:start position:0%
so again we can follow it okay great I'm
 
00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:26.360 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm using the August 14th one
 
00:32:29.269 --> 00:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
let's see if uh the same n section
 
00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:31.240 align:start position:0%
number right
 
00:32:34.669 --> 00:32:34.679 align:start position:0%
okay if you go
 
00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:38.200 align:start position:0%
to um
 
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
30622 for instance High School
 
00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:42.200 align:start position:0%
curriculum thank
 
00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
you credits and curricular
 
00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:49.480 align:start position:0%
programs it says um the the required
 
00:32:51.389 --> 00:32:51.399 align:start position:0%
locally improved curriculum content
 
00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
shall comply with the following the
 
00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
program of study shall include those
 
00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
learning opportunities in which students
 
00:33:00.669 --> 00:33:00.679 align:start position:0%
demonstrate achievement of competencies
 
00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
the first point I made has been lost
 
00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:05.320 align:start position:0%
here it was the Statute 193e says you
 
00:33:08.389 --> 00:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
have to have inputs and outputs equals
 
00:33:11.669 --> 00:33:11.679 align:start position:0%
accountability both this rule says that
 
00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
all the curriculum has to have is a pro
 
00:33:15.669 --> 00:33:15.679 align:start position:0%
program of studies that includes
 
00:33:17.629 --> 00:33:17.639 align:start position:0%
learning opportunities in which students
 
00:33:19.629 --> 00:33:19.639 align:start position:0%
demonstrate achievements of competencies
 
00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
there doesn't have to be an
 
00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:22.600 align:start position:0%
instructional program anymore there
 
00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be a class with teachers
 
00:33:26.389 --> 00:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
with instructional programs and the
 
00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
second half of this that you're going to
 
00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:29.000 align:start position:0%
get next month which should have been
 
00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:30.440 align:start position:0%
included with this for a fair
 
00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:33.720 align:start position:0%
examination of it required that for each
 
00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
subject that's listed in 193e at the
 
00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:38.360 align:start position:0%
each of the three levels elementary
 
00:33:39.549 --> 00:33:39.559 align:start position:0%
middle and high school there's like
 
00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:41.080 align:start position:0%
eight things you have to do for math
 
00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:42.440 align:start position:0%
eight things you have to do for social
 
00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
studies and it had the word shall for
 
00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:47.080 align:start position:0%
each one of them that was stripped in
 
00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:49.960 align:start position:0%
the regs to make it may the statute says
 
00:33:51.549 --> 00:33:51.559 align:start position:0%
you have to have instructional programs
 
00:33:53.149 --> 00:33:53.159 align:start position:0%
that are taught by teachers the current
 
00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
regs said instructional programs taught
 
00:33:57.789 --> 00:33:57.799 align:start position:0%
by teachers the Cur the future
 
00:34:00.549 --> 00:34:00.559 align:start position:0%
regulations got rid of the learning Pro
 
00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
the instructional program language and
 
00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:04.200 align:start position:0%
just call some learning opportunities
 
00:34:05.549 --> 00:34:05.559 align:start position:0%
the only way we know if we have
 
00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
accountability is if people actually
 
00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
achieve the competencies but there's no
 
00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:11.560 align:start position:0%
penalty what if only 20% of the children
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
achieve the competency there's no
 
00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:15.560 align:start position:0%
penalty there the only way you know if
 
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
you have accountability is inputs and I
 
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
would lastly reference you to the conval
 
00:34:21.829 --> 00:34:21.839 align:start position:0%
case the judge in that case please let's
 
00:34:23.589 --> 00:34:23.599 align:start position:0%
not confuse us with the Le all I'm
 
00:34:25.149 --> 00:34:25.159 align:start position:0%
saying is he he looked at that and he
 
00:34:26.589 --> 00:34:26.599 align:start position:0%
said how do we know how much we have to
 
00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
spend he said I'm going to use the input
 
00:34:30.109 --> 00:34:30.119 align:start position:0%
space system because that's what's
 
00:34:31.990 --> 00:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
required by the Constitution that's
 
00:34:34.349 --> 00:34:34.359 align:start position:0%
what's required by existing statute the
 
00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
regulations should match the statute it
 
00:34:39.629 --> 00:34:39.639 align:start position:0%
should be inputs based thank you you're
 
00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
welcome there were other questions
 
00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
representative fellows um yes I'd like
 
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
to talk about use of the um word
 
00:34:50.950 --> 00:34:50.960 align:start position:0%
educator so from the current statutes
 
00:34:53.430 --> 00:34:53.440 align:start position:0%
which defines Educators to include
 
00:34:55.869 --> 00:34:55.879 align:start position:0%
administrators Specialists and teachers
 
00:34:58.829 --> 00:34:58.839 align:start position:0%
it is clearly changed in the new statute
 
00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
but in both the existing statutes and
 
00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
the new ones excuse me are you talking
 
00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
about statutes or rules I'm I'm rules
 
00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:07.870 align:start position:0%
about statutes or rules I'm I'm rules
I'm

00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:07.880 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:12.040 align:start position:0%
sorry so okay yeah yeah so in in the
 
00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
existing rules that we're um have and
 
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
the ones that we're looking at to be
 
00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:20.200 align:start position:0%
changed the definitions are different
 
00:35:23.589 --> 00:35:23.599 align:start position:0%
but in both cases throughout the entire
 
00:35:25.829 --> 00:35:25.839 align:start position:0%
rule when you look at it where the word
 
00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:29.640 align:start position:0%
educator is used which is in many places
 
00:35:35.589 --> 00:35:35.599 align:start position:0%
it's clear that the the individual
 
00:35:41.109 --> 00:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
rule does not apply to all of the um
 
00:35:44.069 --> 00:35:44.079 align:start position:0%
characters that are identified in either
 
00:35:47.109 --> 00:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
of the definitions so it I mean it
 
00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:49.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any sense because I was a
 
00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:51.640 align:start position:0%
business administrator for a school
 
00:35:54.750 --> 00:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
district I I had no business being in a
 
00:35:58.510 --> 00:35:58.520 align:start position:0%
classroom so you know you just have to
 
00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
take that for the way it is and thank
 
00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:03.720 align:start position:0%
you it's too we' be nice if we could fix
 
00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:05.640 align:start position:0%
that but that would be a that would be a
 
00:36:08.589 --> 00:36:08.599 align:start position:0%
big project to fix
 
00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
that you have the department has a
 
00:36:13.589 --> 00:36:13.599 align:start position:0%
comment yeah that would if you're a
 
00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
business administrator you're not
 
00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
qualified you would not by these rules
 
00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
you would not be eligible to be an
 
00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:20.720 align:start position:0%
educator in the classroom so doesn't it
 
00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
say though if I you have to be certified
 
00:36:26.349 --> 00:36:26.359 align:start position:0%
to be a business
 
00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:28.280 align:start position:0%
administrator not well first of all we
 
00:36:29.589 --> 00:36:29.599 align:start position:0%
don't have a business administ
 
00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:31.880 align:start position:0%
administrator certification and we've
 
00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:34.040 align:start position:0%
enumerated an educator the various R did
 
00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
you get rid of it because I used to have
 
00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:37.960 align:start position:0%
a cert a certif it's been gone
 
00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:39.880 align:start position:0%
certificate yeah this board approved
 
00:36:42.589 --> 00:36:42.599 align:start position:0%
that rule probably about 18 months ago
 
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
um that's been gone for some time now hi
 
00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
Elizabeth Brown to identify myself I'm
 
00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
councel for the Department I've been
 
00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:50.920 align:start position:0%
involved with these rules um with Julie
 
00:36:54.069 --> 00:36:54.079 align:start position:0%
Shay um throughout and I just wanted to
 
00:36:57.150 --> 00:36:57.160 align:start position:0%
come and make sure that I was um cleared
 
00:36:59.470 --> 00:36:59.480 align:start position:0%
up the question here about the
 
00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
instructional program being removed
 
00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
instructional program is a a term that
 
00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
is defined by Statute it wasn't defined
 
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:30.309 --> 00:37:30.319 align:start position:0%
program importantly in these rules um
 
00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:31.480 align:start position:0%
because really that's what we were
 
00:37:33.069 --> 00:37:33.079 align:start position:0%
trying to do when we were going through
 
00:37:34.829 --> 00:37:34.839 align:start position:0%
the old rules there was a lot of in
 
00:37:37.589 --> 00:37:37.599 align:start position:0%
congruence between uh the rules
 
00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:39.640 align:start position:0%
themselves and like and statutes and
 
00:37:41.309 --> 00:37:41.319 align:start position:0%
rules and so we were trying to go back
 
00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
and have Fidelity to the educational
 
00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
statutes in these rules and that was
 
00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:50.680 align:start position:0%
really um my focus um I'm an old trust
 
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
and Estates lawyer so each word has
 
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
meaning kind of uh training and that's
 
00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
the kind of fidelity that I laid these
 
00:37:58.309 --> 00:37:58.319 align:start position:0%
when and we were doing these
 
00:38:00.829 --> 00:38:00.839 align:start position:0%
administrative rules to the statute and
 
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that we were very
 
00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:05.880 align:start position:0%
very careful in using the same word in
 
00:38:08.069 --> 00:38:08.079 align:start position:0%
the same way in the rules that we were
 
00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
using in that the legislature had used
 
00:38:13.109 --> 00:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
in the statute because that Fidelity is
 
00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
so important and it had kind of gotten
 
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
lost in the mix and we had created kind
 
00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:19.720 align:start position:0%
of a different nomenclature in the rules
 
00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:21.400 align:start position:0%
um and I think that led to a lot of
 
00:38:25.589 --> 00:38:25.599 align:start position:0%
confusion so if you go back to 306.000 2
 
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
if you look at program program is
 
00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:29.480 align:start position:0%
defined now it means a grouping of
 
00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
interrelated activities opportunity and
 
00:38:33.589 --> 00:38:33.599 align:start position:0%
resources designed to implement a
 
00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
particular goal also because these are
 
00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:40.040 align:start position:0%
intended to be you know Competency Based
 
00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh learning we've defined you know uh
 
00:38:45.349 --> 00:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
learning levels but we've also
 
00:38:45.359 --> 00:38:48.270 align:start position:0%
learning levels but we've also
defined

00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:48.280 align:start position:0%
defined
 
00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:51.160 align:start position:0%
um competencies and we've gone back to
 
00:38:53.589 --> 00:38:53.599 align:start position:0%
define those specifically not in some
 
00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:55.720 align:start position:0%
other fashion but exactly how the
 
00:38:58.470 --> 00:38:58.480 align:start position:0%
legislature has done so so I mean that's
 
00:39:00.069 --> 00:39:00.079 align:start position:0%
the really important thing here is we
 
00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
may have taken out instructional program
 
00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:04.040 align:start position:0%
I'll give the gentleman that but if you
 
00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:05.560 align:start position:0%
go back and you look at the fact that
 
00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
we've adopted educational program that's
 
00:39:09.349 --> 00:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
the language that's now used we've
 
00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:11.560 align:start position:0%
defined program we've made sure that
 
00:39:13.309 --> 00:39:13.319 align:start position:0%
that follows with the statutory
 
00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:15.640 align:start position:0%
definitions it's very very much trying
 
00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:18.520 align:start position:0%
to create a very close correlation to
 
00:39:20.069 --> 00:39:20.079 align:start position:0%
the work of the legislature and make
 
00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:23.200 align:start position:0%
sure that these rules Implement exactly
 
00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
what the legislature has given the State
 
00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:27.880 align:start position:0%
Board the authority to do so
 
00:39:30.109 --> 00:39:30.119 align:start position:0%
um speaking to the back half because I
 
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
think there was an initial draft that
 
00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
was brought before the board as an
 
00:39:36.430 --> 00:39:36.440 align:start position:0%
initial proposal um that included the
 
00:39:39.349 --> 00:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
word may instead of the word shall um
 
00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
you would note if you went and pulled
 
00:39:45.069 --> 00:39:45.079 align:start position:0%
the um um board packet that was before
 
00:39:48.349 --> 00:39:48.359 align:start position:0%
the State Board um on Monday that is not
 
00:39:50.109 --> 00:39:50.119 align:start position:0%
the proposal that went before the state
 
00:39:52.829 --> 00:39:52.839 align:start position:0%
board that is not the proposal that the
 
00:39:55.829 --> 00:39:55.839 align:start position:0%
state board approved on Monday the shall
 
00:39:58.150 --> 00:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
shall be there it is very consistent
 
00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
with the um statutory authority of the
 
00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
state board and the manual and and the
 
00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
process and the procedures that Jael car
 
00:40:08.430 --> 00:40:08.440 align:start position:0%
has demanded of uh rule making bodies so
 
00:40:11.589 --> 00:40:11.599 align:start position:0%
if you rather than uh pontificating or
 
00:40:14.309 --> 00:40:14.319 align:start position:0%
trying to talk in theory about what was
 
00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
in front of the State Board um back in
 
00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
February I think that before we have
 
00:40:20.069 --> 00:40:20.079 align:start position:0%
that conversation you need to go look
 
00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:22.440 align:start position:0%
very specifically at the proposal that
 
00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
was approved by the state board on
 
00:40:27.390 --> 00:40:27.400 align:start position:0%
Monday it was very different um and we
 
00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:29.720 align:start position:0%
had actually had a conversation with 's
 
00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:32.720 align:start position:0%
attorneys um and tried to make sure that
 
00:40:35.309 --> 00:40:35.319 align:start position:0%
we were uh following process procedure
 
00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
and we were keeping Fidelity both to the
 
00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
administrative rules process and
 
00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:41.000 align:start position:0%
existing law so I think you know we've
 
00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
got to be very careful when we're
 
00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:43.640 align:start position:0%
talking about different proposals that
 
00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
everybody's on the same page and we're
 
00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
talking about the same proposals and
 
00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:48.440 align:start position:0%
right now we're kind of passing as two
 
00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
ships in the night in this
 
00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
conversation thank you so can I uh
 
00:40:57.550 --> 00:40:57.560 align:start position:0%
summarize your comments by saying that
 
00:41:00.309 --> 00:41:00.319 align:start position:0%
the old rules were not necessarily
 
00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
properly aligned with the statutes which
 
00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:06.200 align:start position:0%
God knows have been amended many many
 
00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
times and the part of the confusion is
 
00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:11.200 align:start position:0%
that some of the language that's been
 
00:41:13.309 --> 00:41:13.319 align:start position:0%
carried forward in the old
 
00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
rules has been changed because it is no
 
00:41:18.069 --> 00:41:18.079 align:start position:0%
longer supported by the statute is that
 
00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:19.880 align:start position:0%
correct yeah there was that that's a
 
00:41:22.309 --> 00:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
pretty good summary and and we really
 
00:41:24.589 --> 00:41:24.599 align:start position:0%
tried to go back very
 
00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
cautiously um and carefully and go back
 
00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:30.520 align:start position:0%
to see if there were definitions to uh
 
00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:31.880 align:start position:0%
things that were in the rules and we
 
00:41:34.270 --> 00:41:34.280 align:start position:0%
found by surprise that the legislature
 
00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:37.240 align:start position:0%
had done our job for us and so our job
 
00:41:40.109 --> 00:41:40.119 align:start position:0%
if you're if you've defined a term is to
 
00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
use the term that the legislature has
 
00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
used and so we have gone back between
 
00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
the time that the initial proposal went
 
00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:48.200 align:start position:0%
before the state board and this proposal
 
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
came before your body we have done a
 
00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:52.760 align:start position:0%
very careful process of that word for
 
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
word evaluation of this and discussion
 
00:41:57.309 --> 00:41:57.319 align:start position:0%
with the state board on why we have done
 
00:41:59.150 --> 00:41:59.160 align:start position:0%
that because we want to keep Fidelity to
 
00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:00.520 align:start position:0%
the education
 
00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
laws as they currently exist thank you
 
00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:05.960 align:start position:0%
madam chair yes may I might make one
 
00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
response to that yes thank you I I
 
00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
understand Fidelity and I think that's a
 
00:42:13.309 --> 00:42:13.319 align:start position:0%
good goal the the definition of program
 
00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
says a grouping of inter related
 
00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
activities opportunities and resources
 
00:42:22.030 --> 00:42:22.040 align:start position:0%
nothing in there says teachers who teach
 
00:42:24.109 --> 00:42:24.119 align:start position:0%
students if you look at the existing
 
00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:27.160 align:start position:0%
regs it's an instructional program is me
 
00:42:28.829 --> 00:42:28.839 align:start position:0%
methods and strategies for teaching
 
00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
students if you go back to RSA 18924 it
 
00:42:34.309 --> 00:42:34.319 align:start position:0%
requires that in these schools it is
 
00:42:36.910 --> 00:42:36.920 align:start position:0%
taught by teachers that's
 
00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
statuto required in existing law so I
 
00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
think there's some Fidelity that get
 
00:42:44.109 --> 00:42:44.119 align:start position:0%
lost I understand the idea for
 
00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:46.040 align:start position:0%
alternative education and that there are
 
00:42:47.710 --> 00:42:47.720 align:start position:0%
other options that could be applied
 
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
that's good but what these regs do is
 
00:42:51.309 --> 00:42:51.319 align:start position:0%
say we're going to take that and make
 
00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:53.240 align:start position:0%
that the the minimum requirement for
 
00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
everybody which is different than what
 
00:42:56.190 --> 00:42:56.200 align:start position:0%
we have in the presentent system we
 
00:42:57.950 --> 00:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
should take what we have now keep it and
 
00:43:00.069 --> 00:43:00.079 align:start position:0%
maybe add on some of these alternative
 
00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
opportunities and activities but not
 
00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:04.640 align:start position:0%
replace having teachers teach students
 
00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
That's the Law we have right now statute
 
00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
law I use that word specifically thank
 
00:43:10.990 --> 00:43:11.000 align:start position:0%
you you're welcome representative Leon
 
00:43:13.589 --> 00:43:13.599 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair um sir I if you
 
00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
look to the rules that are in the
 
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
conditional approval packet I believe
 
00:43:18.349 --> 00:43:18.359 align:start position:0%
that you will find that all under
 
00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
educational program in the Ed
 
00:43:23.549 --> 00:43:23.559 align:start position:0%
30612 um I recognize how challenging it
 
00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
is to go through all of this and I'm
 
00:43:26.829 --> 00:43:26.839 align:start position:0%
benefiting from the find function but I
 
00:43:29.309 --> 00:43:29.319 align:start position:0%
see that I I see the op where somebody
 
00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
needs to be licensed if you you can only
 
00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
do so much outside of where you're
 
00:43:34.309 --> 00:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
credentialed and I believe that that is
 
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
all in these rules as they're moving
 
00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
forward um if I may if if you look at
 
00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
18924 which is standard
 
00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
school um it is the only definition of
 
00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
school that appears anywhere in the
 
00:43:54.430 --> 00:43:54.440 align:start position:0%
education statutes um it is an awkward
 
00:43:57.109 --> 00:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
rule to try it is an awkward statute to
 
00:43:59.069 --> 00:43:59.079 align:start position:0%
try to employ it doesn't mention
 
00:44:02.549 --> 00:44:02.559 align:start position:0%
teachers anywhere um but it is the only
 
00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
definition of school that the department
 
00:44:06.349 --> 00:44:06.359 align:start position:0%
has to work with something the
 
00:44:09.109 --> 00:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
legislature might want to consider um
 
00:44:10.510 --> 00:44:10.520 align:start position:0%
but it but there's nothing there about
 
00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
teachers it's simply it says a standard
 
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
School shall provide instruction in all
 
00:44:16.030 --> 00:44:16.040 align:start position:0%
subjects prescribed by Statute or by the
 
00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education for the grade
 
00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
level of pupils in attendance it that
 
00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't even tell us by who the
 
00:44:23.309 --> 00:44:23.319 align:start position:0%
instruction is supposed to be uh
 
00:44:25.069 --> 00:44:25.079 align:start position:0%
provided by so that definition of
 
00:44:27.870 --> 00:44:27.880 align:start position:0%
standard school doesn't get us anywhere
 
00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:31.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair one on one reading
 
00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:34.480 align:start position:0%
right off of 18924 right after that part
 
00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:37.240 align:start position:0%
it goes taught by teachers are we not
 
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
reading the same
 
00:44:42.670 --> 00:44:42.680 align:start position:0%
statute that's
 
00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
not it says current through the 2024
 
00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:47.800 align:start position:0%
legislative session yeah right there
 
00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
taught by
 
00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
teachers okay go ahead all
 
00:44:57.390 --> 00:44:57.400 align:start position:0%
right um just to clarify our process
 
00:45:00.309 --> 00:45:00.319 align:start position:0%
also um the
 
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
department submitted an initial proposal
 
00:45:05.069 --> 00:45:05.079 align:start position:0%
and that initial proposal had comments
 
00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:06.640 align:start position:0%
almost on every
 
00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
page that initial proposal and the
 
00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
comments and the public comments that
 
00:45:13.150 --> 00:45:13.160 align:start position:0%
came in for that initial proposal went
 
00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
back to the Department of Education and
 
00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
they created a final proposal draft that
 
00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:19.309 align:start position:0%
they created a final proposal draft that
final

00:45:19.309 --> 00:45:19.319 align:start position:0%
final
 
00:45:22.270 --> 00:45:22.280 align:start position:0%
proposal was the the purpose of it was
 
00:45:25.470 --> 00:45:25.480 align:start position:0%
to satisfy our comments as the committee
 
00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:27.960 align:start position:0%
attorneys and as the public
 
00:45:30.309 --> 00:45:30.319 align:start position:0%
um made comments on the initial proposal
 
00:45:33.829 --> 00:45:33.839 align:start position:0%
so the two texts are not the same and
 
00:45:36.349 --> 00:45:36.359 align:start position:0%
the that I think is very important here
 
00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
because if you're looking at the first
 
00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:39.640 align:start position:0%
one it is not the same as what we're
 
00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
we're talking about now they filed the
 
00:45:44.790 --> 00:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
final proposal it it satisfies most of
 
00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
our our comments and the comments that
 
00:45:48.829 --> 00:45:48.839 align:start position:0%
we had heard from the public and then
 
00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:50.720 align:start position:0%
they did a conditional approval to clean
 
00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
up some other things and so that's what
 
00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
we're reviewing now so I just want to
 
00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
make sure that everybody knows that it's
 
00:45:59.069 --> 00:45:59.079 align:start position:0%
it's the conditional approval that we
 
00:46:01.829 --> 00:46:01.839 align:start position:0%
are reviewing from September
 
00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:05.200 align:start position:0%
12th and again I have no comments on
 
00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:08.440 align:start position:0%
this proposal okay could um May I just
 
00:46:11.549 --> 00:46:11.559 align:start position:0%
bring your attention to 30612 because I
 
00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
think that may better address um the
 
00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:16.680 align:start position:0%
issue if you go through 30 6.12 talks
 
00:46:18.190 --> 00:46:18.200 align:start position:0%
about provision of staff and staff
 
00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
qualifications and it goes through the
 
00:46:22.829 --> 00:46:22.839 align:start position:0%
particular requirements of what a school
 
00:46:24.829 --> 00:46:24.839 align:start position:0%
has to do in order to carry out the
 
00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
educational program and so so it gives
 
00:46:31.589 --> 00:46:31.599 align:start position:0%
it goes through and it tells what the
 
00:46:33.069 --> 00:46:33.079 align:start position:0%
services have to be provided how they
 
00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:35.800 align:start position:0%
have to be provided by um licensed
 
00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:38.200 align:start position:0%
educator how a school district has to
 
00:46:39.950 --> 00:46:39.960 align:start position:0%
hire and train their Educators that
 
00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:42.920 align:start position:0%
they're licensed under the 500 rules
 
00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
facilitate learning in their credential
 
00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:47.160 align:start position:0%
dat content area so I think if you look
 
00:47:00.990 --> 00:47:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:03.710 --> 00:47:03.720 align:start position:0%
okay Madam chair Is there further input
 
00:47:06.069 --> 00:47:06.079 align:start position:0%
that we need to receive
 
00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:09.960 align:start position:0%
ex yes thank you Mr tremble welcome
 
00:47:11.589 --> 00:47:11.599 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
00:47:15.109 --> 00:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
much representative fellow um yes I was
 
00:47:17.109 --> 00:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
just thinking um
 
00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
that in 30612 it uses the word
 
00:47:24.990 --> 00:47:25.000 align:start position:0%
educational program in the definitions
 
00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
it uses the word program which does it
 
00:47:33.069 --> 00:47:33.079 align:start position:0%
says particular goals it doesn't say
 
00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:37.640 align:start position:0%
anything about a curriculum or academic
 
00:47:40.270 --> 00:47:40.280 align:start position:0%
standards it it's I I don't even
 
00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
understand why there would be a
 
00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
definition of just the word program even
 
00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
in here it makes no sense thank
 
00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:03.109 --> 00:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
now you turned it
 
00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:07.160 align:start position:0%
off now it's on okay sorry um Christine
 
00:48:09.950 --> 00:48:09.960 align:start position:0%
Downing Goan New Hampshire um 30 plus
 
00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
year educator um all the way from
 
00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
elementary middle high school teacher to
 
00:48:18.430 --> 00:48:18.440 align:start position:0%
principal to active curriculum director
 
00:48:20.910 --> 00:48:20.920 align:start position:0%
right now um I I do want to make a point
 
00:48:22.950 --> 00:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
of clarification and and I am going to
 
00:48:25.829 --> 00:48:25.839 align:start position:0%
draw to two references and I hate to do
 
00:48:27.390 --> 00:48:27.400 align:start position:0%
this but I am going to labor that
 
00:48:29.589 --> 00:48:29.599 align:start position:0%
definition of AD of educator for a
 
00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
second um but before I do that I Ran So
 
00:48:36.030 --> 00:48:36.040 align:start position:0%
this committee is full fully aware as a
 
00:48:38.670 --> 00:48:38.680 align:start position:0%
volunteer I was not part of um the
 
00:48:40.910 --> 00:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
national coun uh Center for Competency
 
00:48:44.829 --> 00:48:44.839 align:start position:0%
Based learning but I ran 10 educator
 
00:48:46.990 --> 00:48:47.000 align:start position:0%
review sessions in the month month of
 
00:48:51.069 --> 00:48:51.079 align:start position:0%
March of 2024 throughout this state I uh
 
00:48:54.349 --> 00:48:54.359 align:start position:0%
got feedback from over 300 Educators and
 
00:48:56.309 --> 00:48:56.319 align:start position:0%
I am going to go on public record today
 
00:49:00.109 --> 00:49:00.119 align:start position:0%
to say that the language around the
 
00:49:03.630 --> 00:49:03.640 align:start position:0%
educator um student ratios and that
 
00:49:07.870 --> 00:49:07.880 align:start position:0%
class- siiz language was not recommended
 
00:49:10.589 --> 00:49:10.599 align:start position:0%
by the Educators in fact they suggested
 
00:49:13.630 --> 00:49:13.640 align:start position:0%
edits to the existing rules that would
 
00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
clear it up so that I am going to go on
 
00:49:18.349 --> 00:49:18.359 align:start position:0%
public record and I have the data if
 
00:49:20.549 --> 00:49:20.559 align:start position:0%
this committee would like that data to
 
00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
to look through to back up that
 
00:49:25.109 --> 00:49:25.119 align:start position:0%
Educators did not support that we would
 
00:49:28.349 --> 00:49:28.359 align:start position:0%
appreciate it I don't yeah um I'm not
 
00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
concerned that the data on how many
 
00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:34.280 align:start position:0%
Educators supported it I would like to
 
00:49:36.789 --> 00:49:36.799 align:start position:0%
have the specific edits you referenced
 
00:49:39.390 --> 00:49:39.400 align:start position:0%
sent to the committee yep I I can do
 
00:49:41.309 --> 00:49:41.319 align:start position:0%
what the edits were that they they
 
00:49:43.150 --> 00:49:43.160 align:start position:0%
suggested the Educators themselves
 
00:49:45.589 --> 00:49:45.599 align:start position:0%
suggested I absolutely can do that for
 
00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
you absolutely Madam chair um I want to
 
00:49:50.430 --> 00:49:50.440 align:start position:0%
just go back to the educator
 
00:49:52.150 --> 00:49:52.160 align:start position:0%
conversation about what the current
 
00:49:54.670 --> 00:49:54.680 align:start position:0%
rules say the current rules Define
 
00:49:58.190 --> 00:49:58.200 align:start position:0%
educator as means any professional
 
00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
employee of any school district whose
 
00:50:03.069 --> 00:50:03.079 align:start position:0%
position requires certification by the
 
00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:06.720 align:start position:0%
state board pursuant to RSA
 
00:50:10.270 --> 00:50:10.280 align:start position:0%
18939 the term includes administrators
 
00:50:12.750 --> 00:50:12.760 align:start position:0%
Specialists and teachers that's what
 
00:50:15.390 --> 00:50:15.400 align:start position:0%
exists currently in the rule there was a
 
00:50:18.270 --> 00:50:18.280 align:start position:0%
comment made that RSA
 
00:50:21.349 --> 00:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
18939 was irrelevant because it spoke to
 
00:50:23.870 --> 00:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
superintendent but I want you to hear
 
00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:24.750 align:start position:0%
superintendent but I want you to hear
what

00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:24.760 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:50:27.789 --> 00:50:27.799 align:start position:0%
8939 says because I'm going to contend
 
00:50:30.670 --> 00:50:30.680 align:start position:0%
today the removal of that significantly
 
00:50:33.670 --> 00:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
changes the definition of
 
00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
educator 18939 currently effective as of
 
00:50:42.589 --> 00:50:42.599 align:start position:0%
2024 says superintendant shall nominate
 
00:50:45.069 --> 00:50:45.079 align:start position:0%
um shall nominate and school boards
 
00:50:48.349 --> 00:50:48.359 align:start position:0%
elect all teachers employed in the
 
00:50:50.309 --> 00:50:50.319 align:start position:0%
schools in their school administrative
 
00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
unit providing such
 
00:50:56.109 --> 00:50:56.119 align:start position:0%
teachers hold a valid educational
 
00:50:58.870 --> 00:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
credential issued by the State Board of
 
00:51:01.829 --> 00:51:01.839 align:start position:0%
Education the removal out of that of the
 
00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
definition of educator and the addition
 
00:51:07.309 --> 00:51:07.319 align:start position:0%
of particularly and believe me I value
 
00:51:10.710 --> 00:51:10.720 align:start position:0%
our par Educators but the new definition
 
00:51:13.190 --> 00:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
list all these people and basically just
 
00:51:15.069 --> 00:51:15.079 align:start position:0%
says those who are credentialed by the
 
00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
department of Ed what you need to keep
 
00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
in mind is that a par one certification
 
00:51:22.549 --> 00:51:22.559 align:start position:0%
only requires the completion of a high
 
00:51:25.230 --> 00:51:25.240 align:start position:0%
school diploma by the definition in
 
00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
these new rules we with these whether
 
00:51:29.589 --> 00:51:29.599 align:start position:0%
you want to argue their educator ratios
 
00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
or class sizes here's the situation it
 
00:51:35.109 --> 00:51:35.119 align:start position:0%
creates and this is a real world
 
00:51:37.789 --> 00:51:37.799 align:start position:0%
situation I'm dealing currently as a
 
00:51:40.829 --> 00:51:40.839 align:start position:0%
curriculum director currently I am in a
 
00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
small rural School District where I have
 
00:51:46.349 --> 00:51:46.359 align:start position:0%
one teacher per grade level we had an
 
00:51:49.630 --> 00:51:49.640 align:start position:0%
influx of enrollment in our second grade
 
00:51:53.789 --> 00:51:53.799 align:start position:0%
it bumped our second grade to 28
 
00:51:57.630 --> 00:51:57.640 align:start position:0%
students okay so it bumped them to 28
 
00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
students if I took today's rules I would
 
00:52:04.109 --> 00:52:04.119 align:start position:0%
need to go to my board and say we're
 
00:52:05.349 --> 00:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
going to have to figure out another
 
00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
teacher we're above it if I go to the
 
00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:10.640 align:start position:0%
rules that get passed the they're going
 
00:52:12.190 --> 00:52:12.200 align:start position:0%
to be able to say we don't need a
 
00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
certified teacher which is going to cost
 
00:52:16.270 --> 00:52:16.280 align:start position:0%
us more we're going to put a par in
 
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
there now here's what I'm tell I'm going
 
00:52:20.589 --> 00:52:20.599 align:start position:0%
to tell you because under the new rules
 
00:52:23.069 --> 00:52:23.079 align:start position:0%
that per would be defined as an educator
 
00:52:25.030 --> 00:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
and we would now be at a ratio of one to
 
00:52:27.870 --> 00:52:27.880 align:start position:0%
four teams so we be under what's
 
00:52:31.270 --> 00:52:31.280 align:start position:0%
stipulated as a proposed rule that being
 
00:52:33.829 --> 00:52:33.839 align:start position:0%
said the responsibilities of those 28
 
00:52:35.549 --> 00:52:35.559 align:start position:0%
students when it comes to instructional
 
00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
programming lesson planning assessment
 
00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
meeting with P parents falls under that
 
00:52:43.990 --> 00:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
teacher this is the and and to use
 
00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
represent uh Senator Whitley's language
 
00:52:49.710 --> 00:52:49.720 align:start position:0%
there are many contrary points in these
 
00:52:52.990 --> 00:52:53.000 align:start position:0%
rules to the rsas themselves exactly
 
00:52:56.670 --> 00:52:56.680 align:start position:0%
what David Trumble spoke about about the
 
00:53:00.190 --> 00:53:00.200 align:start position:0%
RSA and I I totally respect the State
 
00:53:01.710 --> 00:53:01.720 align:start position:0%
Board of Ed and the department of Ed for
 
00:53:04.109 --> 00:53:04.119 align:start position:0%
the Fidelity conversation of holding
 
00:53:07.589 --> 00:53:07.599 align:start position:0%
Fidelity to the RSA but let's do our due
 
00:53:09.789 --> 00:53:09.799 align:start position:0%
diligence in these
 
00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
rsas the the change in that term of
 
00:53:16.109 --> 00:53:16.119 align:start position:0%
educator is what's creating
 
00:53:19.309 --> 00:53:19.319 align:start position:0%
inequities in our school districts my
 
00:53:22.069 --> 00:53:22.079 align:start position:0%
board with if these rules were adopted
 
00:53:24.069 --> 00:53:24.079 align:start position:0%
and passed my board could say we're just
 
00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
going to add an educator another another
 
00:53:29.069 --> 00:53:29.079 align:start position:0%
District that's 20 miles away from me
 
00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
who has decided to put a uh policy on
 
00:53:36.109 --> 00:53:36.119 align:start position:0%
their local level which they could do
 
00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to argue anybody that um a
 
00:53:41.470 --> 00:53:41.480 align:start position:0%
school district can can set their own
 
00:53:43.990 --> 00:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
requirements for class sizes and ratios
 
00:53:46.309 --> 00:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
could decide to do a policy where they
 
00:53:48.670 --> 00:53:48.680 align:start position:0%
limit and make that decision because
 
00:53:50.789 --> 00:53:50.799 align:start position:0%
they have that kind of financial ability
 
00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
to do that and hire other people whereas
 
00:53:55.270 --> 00:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
one of my rural districts that doesn't
 
00:53:56.990 --> 00:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
have that Financial ability
 
00:53:59.230 --> 00:53:59.240 align:start position:0%
won't set that policy and they defer
 
00:54:02.030 --> 00:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
back to these minimum standards approval
 
00:54:04.630 --> 00:54:04.640 align:start position:0%
we have to think of the lens of equities
 
00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
to our schools across the state for
 
00:54:08.670 --> 00:54:08.680 align:start position:0%
these rules now I am going to give up
 
00:54:11.710 --> 00:54:11.720 align:start position:0%
another whole section thank you for the
 
00:54:14.670 --> 00:54:14.680 align:start position:0%
time but there are concerns in section
 
00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:28.190 --> 00:54:28.200 align:start position:0%
and here's where I want to bring some
 
00:54:30.750 --> 00:54:30.760 align:start position:0%
concerns to light I hear the
 
00:54:33.190 --> 00:54:33.200 align:start position:0%
conversation about Fidelity and Fidelity
 
00:54:36.430 --> 00:54:36.440 align:start position:0%
to the RSA particularly RSA
 
00:54:40.270 --> 00:54:40.280 align:start position:0%
193e 2A which is the definition of an
 
00:54:42.829 --> 00:54:42.839 align:start position:0%
adequate education and here's where I'm
 
00:54:45.030 --> 00:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
going to start to pull some things out
 
00:54:47.150 --> 00:54:47.160 align:start position:0%
in a tech advisory that was written in
 
00:54:49.549 --> 00:54:49.559 align:start position:0%
September of 2022 by the department of
 
00:54:52.150 --> 00:54:52.160 align:start position:0%
education related to personal finance
 
00:54:55.870 --> 00:54:55.880 align:start position:0%
literacy they used the interpretation
 
00:54:59.230 --> 00:54:59.240 align:start position:0%
that in in RSA 193
 
00:55:03.109 --> 00:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
e2a paragraph 1 when it lists out the
 
00:55:06.910 --> 00:55:06.920 align:start position:0%
learning areas that should be included
 
00:55:09.390 --> 00:55:09.400 align:start position:0%
as the definition of adequate education
 
00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
they unilaterally interpreted that list
 
00:55:14.710 --> 00:55:14.720 align:start position:0%
to mean they had to be Standalone
 
00:55:18.190 --> 00:55:18.200 align:start position:0%
classes here's what I mean the original
 
00:55:20.789 --> 00:55:20.799 align:start position:0%
law that governed the implementation of
 
00:55:24.990 --> 00:55:25.000 align:start position:0%
personal finance literacy clearly stated
 
00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
that personal finance literacy could be
 
00:55:32.029 --> 00:55:32.039 align:start position:0%
integrated and applied into other areas
 
00:55:34.470 --> 00:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
yet in the proposal in
 
00:55:37.150 --> 00:55:37.160 align:start position:0%
30622 here where they list the
 
00:55:39.390 --> 00:55:39.400 align:start position:0%
graduation credits out that they're
 
00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
proposing they're going to hold them
 
00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
steady for now but for the following
 
00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
year they're proposing a half credit of
 
00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
personal finance literacy where in the
 
00:55:52.910 --> 00:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
RSA does it give them the authority to
 
00:55:55.589 --> 00:55:55.599 align:start position:0%
usurp the law that was written that
 
00:55:58.390 --> 00:55:58.400 align:start position:0%
implemented personal finance literacy to
 
00:56:01.470 --> 00:56:01.480 align:start position:0%
be integrated to now be a standalone
 
00:56:03.910 --> 00:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
credit which most will interpret as a
 
00:56:07.710 --> 00:56:07.720 align:start position:0%
standalone course it doesn't and in fact
 
00:56:10.270 --> 00:56:10.280 align:start position:0%
when that law first came out many high
 
00:56:13.069 --> 00:56:13.079 align:start position:0%
schools incorporated as the law had
 
00:56:16.750 --> 00:56:16.760 align:start position:0%
stated personal finance competencies in
 
00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
their economic classes which were a half
 
00:56:22.789 --> 00:56:22.799 align:start position:0%
credit by adding that half credit to
 
00:56:25.589 --> 00:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
personal finance literacy they took a
 
00:56:28.109 --> 00:56:28.119 align:start position:0%
half credit away from our New Hampshire
 
00:56:30.829 --> 00:56:30.839 align:start position:0%
students in their electives they
 
00:56:33.950 --> 00:56:33.960 align:start position:0%
eliminated student agency and choice and
 
00:56:36.789 --> 00:56:36.799 align:start position:0%
voice in what kids can do to design
 
00:56:39.589 --> 00:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
their learning Pathways in high schools
 
00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
that's the very essence of Competency
 
00:56:45.029 --> 00:56:45.039 align:start position:0%
Based education another example I will
 
00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:47.480 align:start position:0%
give you real quick again in
 
00:56:51.990 --> 00:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
30622 going back to the Fidelity of RSA
 
00:56:57.670 --> 00:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
193e 2A is that in paragraph 1 section B
 
00:57:00.029 --> 00:57:00.039 align:start position:0%
it clearly also says that logic and
 
00:57:03.829 --> 00:57:03.839 align:start position:0%
rhetoric shall be integrated and applied
 
00:57:05.950 --> 00:57:05.960 align:start position:0%
yet again they pulled out logic and
 
00:57:09.349 --> 00:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
rhetoric to make it its own half credit
 
00:57:13.549 --> 00:57:13.559 align:start position:0%
again taking electives from our
 
00:57:16.430 --> 00:57:16.440 align:start position:0%
students we are minimizing if these
 
00:57:19.549 --> 00:57:19.559 align:start position:0%
rules move forward we are minimizing the
 
00:57:22.029 --> 00:57:22.039 align:start position:0%
high school experience for our students
 
00:57:25.150 --> 00:57:25.160 align:start position:0%
to be a compliance checklist we are not
 
00:57:27.950 --> 00:57:27.960 align:start position:0%
making our public schools a place where
 
00:57:31.109 --> 00:57:31.119 align:start position:0%
kids can explore and find out who they
 
00:57:33.870 --> 00:57:33.880 align:start position:0%
want to be I can continue but I'm not
 
00:57:35.870 --> 00:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
going to eat your time up I've got more
 
00:57:38.349 --> 00:57:38.359 align:start position:0%
examples like this I will be happy to
 
00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
submit the written details of more
 
00:57:44.029 --> 00:57:44.039 align:start position:0%
exemptions like this that exist in the
 
00:57:46.990 --> 00:57:47.000 align:start position:0%
effort to make things have Fidelity to
 
00:57:50.589 --> 00:57:50.599 align:start position:0%
the rsas it's been a pick and choose
 
00:57:52.549 --> 00:57:52.559 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the Fidelity one other
 
00:57:55.309 --> 00:57:55.319 align:start position:0%
quick thing I will point out is that in
 
00:57:56.829 --> 00:57:56.839 align:start position:0%
that same section
 
00:57:58.710 --> 00:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
I believe it might be under Section 3
 
00:58:02.589 --> 00:58:02.599 align:start position:0%
within 30622 there is a list of areas
 
00:58:04.270 --> 00:58:04.280 align:start position:0%
that high schools are supposed to have
 
00:58:06.349 --> 00:58:06.359 align:start position:0%
in that list it contains business
 
00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
education yet it removes family and
 
00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
consumer science the board discussed at
 
00:58:14.430 --> 00:58:14.440 align:start position:0%
its meeting how they were removing it
 
00:58:16.750 --> 00:58:16.760 align:start position:0%
because family and consumer science was
 
00:58:20.029 --> 00:58:20.039 align:start position:0%
not listed in RSA
 
00:58:23.430 --> 00:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
1932a to Define an adequate education
 
00:58:25.430 --> 00:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
okay I recognize that you're trying to
 
00:58:28.510 --> 00:58:28.520 align:start position:0%
be faith F to that RSA then my question
 
00:58:30.670 --> 00:58:30.680 align:start position:0%
would be then why is business EDS still
 
00:58:34.309 --> 00:58:34.319 align:start position:0%
in the list Fidelity is Fidelity you
 
00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
hold it as a line you don't choose when
 
00:58:40.470 --> 00:58:40.480 align:start position:0%
you want to have Fidelity and when you
 
00:58:44.349 --> 00:58:44.359 align:start position:0%
don't thank you thank
 
00:58:46.870 --> 00:58:46.880 align:start position:0%
you thank you very
 
00:58:50.270 --> 00:58:50.280 align:start position:0%
much Madam chair yes I I'm just
 
00:58:52.470 --> 00:58:52.480 align:start position:0%
wondering if we could ask Miss Downey to
 
00:58:56.309 --> 00:58:56.319 align:start position:0%
send us those examples in addition to
 
00:58:58.029 --> 00:58:58.039 align:start position:0%
the uh comments that were made on
 
00:59:00.630 --> 00:59:00.640 align:start position:0%
educator but also the examples that you
 
00:59:03.589 --> 00:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
have in these kind of in these kinds of
 
00:59:06.069 --> 00:59:06.079 align:start position:0%
situations in addition to besides bu
 
00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
business education and that would be
 
00:59:10.190 --> 00:59:10.200 align:start position:0%
very helpful thank you would absolutely
 
00:59:11.630 --> 00:59:11.640 align:start position:0%
it would be helpful to me if it's okay
 
00:59:14.109 --> 00:59:14.119 align:start position:0%
with you absolutely I just need to know
 
00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:16.240 align:start position:0%
is the current list on the website like
 
00:59:17.950 --> 00:59:17.960 align:start position:0%
current with all the active members I
 
00:59:19.829 --> 00:59:19.839 align:start position:0%
want to make sure I get everybody yes so
 
00:59:22.069 --> 00:59:22.079 align:start position:0%
yeah okay y I will use the website and
 
00:59:31.230 --> 00:59:31.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:34.150 --> 00:59:34.160 align:start position:0%
you like the department to uh comment
 
00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:35.640 align:start position:0%
sure I'll try and clarify some things
 
00:59:37.390 --> 00:59:37.400 align:start position:0%
and we so appreciate the work that uh
 
00:59:39.589 --> 00:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
Miss Downing did uh in terms of
 
00:59:42.150 --> 00:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
gathering um public input from many of
 
00:59:45.870 --> 00:59:45.880 align:start position:0%
our Educators um and uh we meticulously
 
00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
went through that input and tried to
 
00:59:50.470 --> 00:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
incorporate any comments or changes that
 
00:59:53.789 --> 00:59:53.799 align:start position:0%
they had um into this rule set and we
 
00:59:55.829 --> 00:59:55.839 align:start position:0%
believe with Fidelity we have included
 
00:59:57.910 --> 00:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
those those um I'm just includ you know
 
00:59:59.190 --> 00:59:59.200 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions but I
 
01:00:01.230 --> 01:00:01.240 align:start position:0%
will also just address a couple of the
 
01:00:02.910 --> 01:00:02.920 align:start position:0%
the items that she brought up and again
 
01:00:04.430 --> 01:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
we still seem to be going around about
 
01:00:06.829 --> 01:00:06.839 align:start position:0%
this concept of educator educator as a
 
01:00:08.510 --> 01:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
term is used throughout this rural
 
01:00:10.710 --> 01:00:10.720 align:start position:0%
proposal but I will again point you to
 
01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:11.910 align:start position:0%
proposal but I will again point you to
Ed

01:00:11.910 --> 01:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
Ed
 
01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
30612 uh provision of staff and staff
 
01:00:16.510 --> 01:00:16.520 align:start position:0%
qualifications where we talk about to
 
01:00:18.910 --> 01:00:18.920 align:start position:0%
carry out the educational programs which
 
01:00:20.549 --> 01:00:20.559 align:start position:0%
are required in these rules the local
 
01:00:22.670 --> 01:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
school board shall require that each
 
01:00:26.029 --> 01:00:26.039 align:start position:0%
school provides um and under two it says
 
01:00:27.910 --> 01:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
professional staff member licensed by
 
01:00:29.870 --> 01:00:29.880 align:start position:0%
the department in accordance with 500
 
01:00:34.069 --> 01:00:34.079 align:start position:0%
and uh 600 under B it says and that the
 
01:00:35.589 --> 01:00:35.599 align:start position:0%
an educator with sufficient content
 
01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:36.760 align:start position:0%
knowledge as determined by the
 
01:00:38.549 --> 01:00:38.559 align:start position:0%
superintendent may be assigned to teach
 
01:00:40.750 --> 01:00:40.760 align:start position:0%
in a Content area in which they are not
 
01:00:43.630 --> 01:00:43.640 align:start position:0%
licensed only as a minor assignment um
 
01:00:45.029 --> 01:00:45.039 align:start position:0%
so it is not that they can just be
 
01:00:47.430 --> 01:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
randomly assigned to educate that would
 
01:00:49.470 --> 01:00:49.480 align:start position:0%
be a violation of the laws if you put a
 
01:00:51.670 --> 01:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
par educator who didn't have content
 
01:00:54.270 --> 01:00:54.280 align:start position:0%
knowledge and responsible for running an
 
01:00:56.950 --> 01:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
educational program um the second thing
 
01:01:26.309 --> 01:01:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:28.510 --> 01:01:28.520 align:start position:0%
20 credits required to graduate from
 
01:01:29.870 --> 01:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
high school that's the minimum number of
 
01:01:31.109 --> 01:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
credits that are required to graduate
 
01:01:33.430 --> 01:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
from high school most schools have more
 
01:01:35.870 --> 01:01:35.880 align:start position:0%
than 20 credits as the number of credits
 
01:01:39.109 --> 01:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
that they acquire um in that initial
 
01:01:42.150 --> 01:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
list six credits were included as
 
01:01:45.589 --> 01:01:45.599 align:start position:0%
electives for the students um the
 
01:01:47.309 --> 01:01:47.319 align:start position:0%
board's conversation around this so and
 
01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
then in the proposal they're saying that
 
01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
they should have four elective credits
 
01:01:54.269 --> 01:01:54.279 align:start position:0%
not six elective credits um part of the
 
01:01:56.230 --> 01:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
conversation that the board had around
 
01:01:58.470 --> 01:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
that is they said if we are you know
 
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
we've got compulsory education laws so
 
01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
these students are required to be in
 
01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
school during the time that they're in
 
01:02:05.069 --> 01:02:05.079 align:start position:0%
school we want to make sure that they're
 
01:02:07.829 --> 01:02:07.839 align:start position:0%
getting the information that we want and
 
01:02:09.549 --> 01:02:09.559 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that we're not
 
01:02:12.150 --> 01:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
communicating uh that an entire year of
 
01:02:13.789 --> 01:02:13.799 align:start position:0%
high school which would be five credits
 
01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:16.640 align:start position:0%
is uh you know kind of uh voluntary
 
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
because then if you think about it most
 
01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
kids would basically be able to complete
 
01:02:22.150 --> 01:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
all of their academic requirements in
 
01:02:24.430 --> 01:02:24.440 align:start position:0%
three years of high school and then they
 
01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
can spend their entire senior year just
 
01:02:27.589 --> 01:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
taking elective credits so we've
 
01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
continued to leave four elective credits
 
01:02:31.549 --> 01:02:31.559 align:start position:0%
in there but they have uh you know
 
01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
required some additional changes to that
 
01:02:36.150 --> 01:02:36.160 align:start position:0%
including uh you know in the mathematics
 
01:02:37.829 --> 01:02:37.839 align:start position:0%
area they added a half a credit in
 
01:02:41.029 --> 01:02:41.039 align:start position:0%
statistics and Analysis um and then they
 
01:02:42.910 --> 01:02:42.920 align:start position:0%
split out some of the other credits
 
01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
relative to the bill that was passed uh
 
01:02:49.990 --> 01:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
SP 216 by the uh the Senate relative to
 
01:02:53.069 --> 01:02:53.079 align:start position:0%
requiring certain history uh government
 
01:02:54.950 --> 01:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
and constitutional classes that they put
 
01:02:57.549 --> 01:02:57.559 align:start position:0%
in there um um as well as it is as
 
01:03:00.029 --> 01:03:00.039 align:start position:0%
Christine pointed out the uh the board
 
01:03:02.069 --> 01:03:02.079 align:start position:0%
uh believed that the financial personal
 
01:03:04.510 --> 01:03:04.520 align:start position:0%
financial literacy was uh because it's
 
01:03:06.349 --> 01:03:06.359 align:start position:0%
enumerated in that list was something
 
01:03:09.470 --> 01:03:09.480 align:start position:0%
that um you know that this body uh
 
01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
wanted the students to have a dedicated
 
01:03:14.710 --> 01:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
personal financial literacy class uh and
 
01:03:17.470 --> 01:03:17.480 align:start position:0%
so that is how that was understood by
 
01:03:19.150 --> 01:03:19.160 align:start position:0%
the the state board when they were you
 
01:03:20.750 --> 01:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
know discussing the table of credits
 
01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
that would uh take place here um I don't
 
01:03:25.990 --> 01:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
disagree with Miss Downing that uh and
 
01:03:28.150 --> 01:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
consumer science was not on the list so
 
01:03:30.750 --> 01:03:30.760 align:start position:0%
if I go back in that particular rule uh
 
01:03:32.269 --> 01:03:32.279 align:start position:0%
where we talk about the classes that are
 
01:03:34.269 --> 01:03:34.279 align:start position:0%
required to be offered right so not
 
01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
credit requirements for graduation but
 
01:03:38.470 --> 01:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
credits that are required to be offered
 
01:03:41.309 --> 01:03:41.319 align:start position:0%
um the board did remove CR family and
 
01:03:43.029 --> 01:03:43.039 align:start position:0%
consumer science because it was not
 
01:03:45.630 --> 01:03:45.640 align:start position:0%
enumerated um in that list the board had
 
01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
a conversation and believed that that
 
01:03:50.349 --> 01:03:50.359 align:start position:0%
was incorporated into uh content areas
 
01:03:51.589 --> 01:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
such as social studies personal
 
01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
financial literacy and economics um and
 
01:03:56.910 --> 01:03:56.920 align:start position:0%
was encapsulated in there um as well the
 
01:03:59.069 --> 01:03:59.079 align:start position:0%
the jail car comments that we received
 
01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:00.640 align:start position:0%
uh pointed out the fact that these were
 
01:04:03.109 --> 01:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
not on that list um but business
 
01:04:04.670 --> 01:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
education was not one of the jail car
 
01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
comments that we received so we left
 
01:04:09.150 --> 01:04:09.160 align:start position:0%
that on the list uh in terms of uh
 
01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
credits that schools are required to
 
01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
offer I don't know if that helps
 
01:04:17.150 --> 01:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
so if I understand correctly the
 
01:04:20.309 --> 01:04:20.319 align:start position:0%
legislature has added specific
 
01:04:22.750 --> 01:04:22.760 align:start position:0%
requirements in the last few years that
 
01:04:24.990 --> 01:04:25.000 align:start position:0%
weren't in the previous rules that are
 
01:04:27.269 --> 01:04:27.279 align:start position:0%
incl in included in these rules that's
 
01:04:31.430 --> 01:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
correct the number of open electives has
 
01:04:33.829 --> 01:04:33.839 align:start position:0%
been decreased
 
01:04:37.069 --> 01:04:37.079 align:start position:0%
deliberately despite and
 
01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:40.319 align:start position:0%
the um specific items that were pointed
 
01:04:43.109 --> 01:04:43.119 align:start position:0%
out as needing to be addressed for
 
01:04:43.119 --> 01:04:44.870 align:start position:0%
out as needing to be addressed for
example

01:04:44.870 --> 01:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:04:47.470 --> 01:04:47.480 align:start position:0%
um personal
 
01:04:51.109 --> 01:04:51.119 align:start position:0%
finance are are specifically called out
 
01:04:52.950 --> 01:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
that's correct so in this rle proposal
 
01:04:54.190 --> 01:04:54.200 align:start position:0%
the board believed that the
 
01:04:55.950 --> 01:04:55.960 align:start position:0%
legislature's intention was that
 
01:04:57.390 --> 01:04:57.400 align:start position:0%
students would have a half a credit and
 
01:05:03.870 --> 01:05:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:06.670 --> 01:05:06.680 align:start position:0%
okay I'm sure that that's that's the
 
01:05:08.230 --> 01:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
minimum but I would hope that more of
 
01:05:11.190 --> 01:05:11.200 align:start position:0%
them would do more than that um business
 
01:05:13.309 --> 01:05:13.319 align:start position:0%
education doesn't appear to be on that
 
01:05:15.910 --> 01:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
list that I can see but it is a
 
01:05:17.990 --> 01:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
requirement that the schools offer it
 
01:05:19.470 --> 01:05:19.480 align:start position:0%
correct is not a graduation requirement
 
01:05:21.630 --> 01:05:21.640 align:start position:0%
but it's required that the schools offer
 
01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
business education and what is included
 
01:05:25.470 --> 01:05:25.480 align:start position:0%
in business business education that's
 
01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
not economics so that's enumerated in
 
01:05:30.349 --> 01:05:30.359 align:start position:0%
the back half um and so it includes a
 
01:05:31.950 --> 01:05:31.960 align:start position:0%
variety of subjects that are
 
01:05:34.029 --> 01:05:34.039 align:start position:0%
competencies developed through the CTE
 
01:05:37.029 --> 01:05:37.039 align:start position:0%
programming thank you does anyone else
 
01:05:39.510 --> 01:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
represent CH Senator Chandler thank you
 
01:05:42.750 --> 01:05:42.760 align:start position:0%
very much I my question may be more for
 
01:05:45.430 --> 01:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
um jel car the attorneys than the
 
01:05:47.029 --> 01:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
department but I appreciate your input
 
01:05:50.510 --> 01:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
as well um you know change is difficult
 
01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
for all of us and I do think it's
 
01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:53.960 align:start position:0%
important that we have these robust
 
01:05:56.309 --> 01:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
discussions um because because we we
 
01:05:57.470 --> 01:05:57.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to make a change it's going
 
01:05:59.829 --> 01:05:59.839 align:start position:0%
to be in place for quite a while we want
 
01:06:01.789 --> 01:06:01.799 align:start position:0%
to make sure we're doing it right and
 
01:06:03.269 --> 01:06:03.279 align:start position:0%
commissioner you just mentioned
 
01:06:05.029 --> 01:06:05.039 align:start position:0%
something that is really of concern to
 
01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:07.640 align:start position:0%
me and that is the back half so we are
 
01:06:11.029 --> 01:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
May the question uh raised by our chair
 
01:06:13.430 --> 01:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
is a good question and we're going to
 
01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
get the answer we it's potentially that
 
01:06:19.589 --> 01:06:19.599 align:start position:0%
we won't get the answer until after this
 
01:06:22.670 --> 01:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
approval I'm just my question is should
 
01:06:25.269 --> 01:06:25.279 align:start position:0%
we be doing all of this at once would it
 
01:06:29.150 --> 01:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
make more sense um and is that practical
 
01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
so as I say that may be a question for
 
01:06:33.829 --> 01:06:33.839 align:start position:0%
many would that other section be ready
 
01:06:37.069 --> 01:06:37.079 align:start position:0%
for our our October meeting uh I don't
 
01:06:38.190 --> 01:06:38.200 align:start position:0%
believe it'll be ready until the
 
01:06:41.349 --> 01:06:41.359 align:start position:0%
November meeting the deadline for this
 
01:06:43.789 --> 01:06:43.799 align:start position:0%
is October 18th jel car would need a
 
01:06:47.230 --> 01:06:47.240 align:start position:0%
waiver to postpone it until until the
 
01:06:49.670 --> 01:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
department is ready I have a question M
 
01:06:52.510 --> 01:06:52.520 align:start position:0%
I'm chair yes represent when would these
 
01:06:55.190 --> 01:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
let's just say when is the effective
 
01:06:57.390 --> 01:06:57.400 align:start position:0%
date because the your rules have not
 
01:06:57.400 --> 01:06:59.069 align:start position:0%
date because the your rules have not
expired

01:06:59.069 --> 01:06:59.079 align:start position:0%
expired
 
01:07:01.630 --> 01:07:01.640 align:start position:0%
correct no the rules have not expired
 
01:07:03.549 --> 01:07:03.559 align:start position:0%
they were filed before the expiration
 
01:07:05.870 --> 01:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
date which means they continue in effect
 
01:07:08.510 --> 01:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
until the process is over okay so
 
01:07:11.349 --> 01:07:11.359 align:start position:0%
there's no pending rush for these things
 
01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
and the department will determine what
 
01:07:16.309 --> 01:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
the effective date is considering
 
01:07:18.470 --> 01:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
correct and so we've included some
 
01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
effective dates so for example on the
 
01:07:21.589 --> 01:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
minimum you know the graduation
 
01:07:23.349 --> 01:07:23.359 align:start position:0%
requirements there's two dates we gave
 
01:07:26.109 --> 01:07:26.119 align:start position:0%
schools two years in order to be able to
 
01:07:28.349 --> 01:07:28.359 align:start position:0%
Implement that any changes associated
 
01:07:30.910 --> 01:07:30.920 align:start position:0%
with that I believe so okay so that none
 
01:07:33.630 --> 01:07:33.640 align:start position:0%
of them affect the current school year
 
01:07:36.430 --> 01:07:36.440 align:start position:0%
is that correct other than making sure
 
01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:37.710 align:start position:0%
is that correct other than making sure
that

01:07:37.710 --> 01:07:37.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:07:40.510 --> 01:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
the so for the change so if you look at
 
01:07:44.069 --> 01:07:44.079 align:start position:0%
the the draft there are two tables that
 
01:07:46.710 --> 01:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
have graduation requirements because we
 
01:07:49.470 --> 01:07:49.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to give students the opportunity
 
01:07:51.390 --> 01:07:51.400 align:start position:0%
who who have already gone into high
 
01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
school not to have the graduation
 
01:07:55.630 --> 01:07:55.640 align:start position:0%
requirements changed or altered while
 
01:07:58.230 --> 01:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
they were there and so the more we delay
 
01:08:00.950 --> 01:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
these then we run some risk that um
 
01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
students would have the rules changed or
 
01:08:04.510 --> 01:08:04.520 align:start position:0%
we would need to delay the changes even
 
01:08:06.589 --> 01:08:06.599 align:start position:0%
further which might not necessarily be
 
01:08:08.630 --> 01:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
consistent with the legislative intent
 
01:08:10.029 --> 01:08:10.039 align:start position:0%
because they've changed some of the
 
01:08:12.990 --> 01:08:13.000 align:start position:0%
requirements under 193 e2a in the recent
 
01:08:14.470 --> 01:08:14.480 align:start position:0%
years and so we're just delaying the
 
01:08:16.950 --> 01:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
implementation of those changes right
 
01:08:19.110 --> 01:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
but it but for the purposes of the
 
01:08:21.110 --> 01:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
students I don't know how many of them
 
01:08:24.030 --> 01:08:24.040 align:start position:0%
are having quar or credit courses but
 
01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:25.550 align:start position:0%
are having quar or credit courses but
most

01:08:25.550 --> 01:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
most
 
01:08:28.669 --> 01:08:28.679 align:start position:0%
so the for someone who is a senior this
 
01:08:30.349 --> 01:08:30.359 align:start position:0%
year you're not are you changing the
 
01:08:32.030 --> 01:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
requirements at all no no anybody who's
 
01:08:33.550 --> 01:08:33.560 align:start position:0%
in the system gets to stay with the
 
01:08:35.950 --> 01:08:35.960 align:start position:0%
current system until they complete fine
 
01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
then I think it's although it may be a
 
01:08:40.590 --> 01:08:40.600 align:start position:0%
nuisance for planning purposes I agree
 
01:08:42.390 --> 01:08:42.400 align:start position:0%
with the senator that we should look at
 
01:08:45.709 --> 01:08:45.719 align:start position:0%
the entire package at once because they
 
01:08:46.870 --> 01:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
appear to be
 
01:08:49.630 --> 01:08:49.640 align:start position:0%
interrelated if Senator Whitley if
 
01:08:53.590 --> 01:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
you'll you'll uh postpone your motion
 
01:08:55.829 --> 01:08:55.839 align:start position:0%
I'll withdraw my motion all right then
 
01:08:59.789 --> 01:08:59.799 align:start position:0%
then I'll move that we request a waiver
 
01:08:59.799 --> 01:09:01.550 align:start position:0%
then I'll move that we request a waiver
and

01:09:01.550 --> 01:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:03.910 align:start position:0%
and
defer

01:09:03.910 --> 01:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
defer
 
01:09:06.870 --> 01:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
um consideration of this rule until we
 
01:09:08.110 --> 01:09:08.120 align:start position:0%
have the other
 
01:09:10.950 --> 01:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
half which is estimated to be the
 
01:09:14.229 --> 01:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
November meeting
 
01:09:18.149 --> 01:09:18.159 align:start position:0%
okay all right any comments
 
01:09:21.070 --> 01:09:21.080 align:start position:0%
discussion I think that makes sense okay
 
01:09:23.709 --> 01:09:23.719 align:start position:0%
I do have one question yes and we may
 
01:09:26.229 --> 01:09:26.239 align:start position:0%
not be able to answer that but part of
 
01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
the um responsibility of the legislative
 
01:09:31.630 --> 01:09:31.640 align:start position:0%
oversight committee and education is to
 
01:09:34.789 --> 01:09:34.799 align:start position:0%
review these the curriculum rules in
 
01:09:36.950 --> 01:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
particular so I just want to make sure
 
01:09:39.990 --> 01:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
how that the oversight committee is
 
01:09:42.709 --> 01:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
charged with um reviewing the academic
 
01:09:44.910 --> 01:09:44.920 align:start position:0%
standards these are not the academic
 
01:09:46.789 --> 01:09:46.799 align:start position:0%
standards that's correct I understand
 
01:09:48.189 --> 01:09:48.199 align:start position:0%
that I'm talking about the second half I
 
01:09:49.630 --> 01:09:49.640 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that when we get
 
01:09:51.789 --> 01:09:51.799 align:start position:0%
there everybody's on the same page and
 
01:09:54.510 --> 01:09:54.520 align:start position:0%
everybody's on the same bus okay that's
 
01:09:56.070 --> 01:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
that's my question and that's my
 
01:09:59.149 --> 01:09:59.159 align:start position:0%
statement that makes sense any other
 
01:10:02.870 --> 01:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
comments those in favor I I
 
01:10:07.550 --> 01:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:10.270 align:start position:0%
 
testimony

01:10:10.270 --> 01:10:10.280 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
agriculture okay this is um animal popul
 
01:10:23.070 --> 01:10:23.080 align:start position:0%
population control 2024
 
01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
51 this is an incomplete filing there is
 
01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
no summary of public comments I have
 
01:10:30.510 --> 01:10:30.520 align:start position:0%
requested it several times and have not
 
01:10:32.510 --> 01:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
received it so there is no public
 
01:10:35.669 --> 01:10:35.679 align:start position:0%
comment summary on this proposal um
 
01:10:38.070 --> 01:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
there is also there are some um
 
01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:41.080 align:start position:0%
substantive comments um legislative
 
01:10:44.950 --> 01:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
intent for requiring a social security
 
01:10:48.830 --> 01:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
number um which needs a specific statute
 
01:10:51.310 --> 01:10:51.320 align:start position:0%
author statutory Authority for and the
 
01:10:53.470 --> 01:10:53.480 align:start position:0%
department does not appear to have that
 
01:10:55.270 --> 01:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
and then there's also some clarity is
 
01:11:01.030 --> 01:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
isues um for example in uh agriculture
 
01:11:04.830 --> 01:11:04.840 align:start position:0%
28020 they're using multiple
 
01:11:07.270 --> 01:11:07.280 align:start position:0%
conjunctions which makes the the
 
01:11:10.070 --> 01:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
paragraph you you can interpret it in
 
01:11:11.470 --> 01:11:11.480 align:start position:0%
several different ways because they're
 
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
using both the the and and the or
 
01:11:17.310 --> 01:11:17.320 align:start position:0%
conjunction um there's also another area
 
01:11:19.630 --> 01:11:19.640 align:start position:0%
where they talk about checks and award
 
01:11:22.149 --> 01:11:22.159 align:start position:0%
letters but those are not defined or
 
01:11:22.159 --> 01:11:23.750 align:start position:0%
letters but those are not defined or
described

01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
described
 
01:11:26.750 --> 01:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
um and so there's some some serious
 
01:11:30.110 --> 01:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:31.830 align:start position:0%
 
rules

01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:11:33.590 --> 01:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
01:11:37.590 --> 01:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
you does the department have a
 
01:11:40.270 --> 01:11:40.280 align:start position:0%
comment please turn your microphone on
 
01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
thank thank you there you go um sorry
 
01:11:45.910 --> 01:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
about that uh Patricia Benner I'm the
 
01:11:48.270 --> 01:11:48.280 align:start position:0%
legislative coordinator um primarily
 
01:11:50.910 --> 01:11:50.920 align:start position:0%
hearings officer for the Department um
 
01:11:54.390 --> 01:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
and working part-time so uh there's a
 
01:11:57.470 --> 01:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
lot on the the agriculture plate however
 
01:12:02.070 --> 01:12:02.080 align:start position:0%
um so I do apologize for uh lack of uh
 
01:12:05.390 --> 01:12:05.400 align:start position:0%
completeness the um I believe we
 
01:12:08.550 --> 01:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
included in our cover letter um I
 
01:12:12.229 --> 01:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
believe it was um explanatory notes
 
01:12:15.550 --> 01:12:15.560 align:start position:0%
rather than a public comment summary was
 
01:12:18.110 --> 01:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
the title um there were no public
 
01:12:21.390 --> 01:12:21.400 align:start position:0%
comments um so that's all right well
 
01:12:23.149 --> 01:12:23.159 align:start position:0%
that explains why there's no
 
01:12:26.629 --> 01:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
summary um just just to be clear even if
 
01:12:29.189 --> 01:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
there are no comments you have to submit
 
01:12:31.550 --> 01:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
a summary to tell us that there are no
 
01:12:35.149 --> 01:12:35.159 align:start position:0%
comments I I in there it just wasn't
 
01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
titled correctly um so uh and then I I
 
01:12:43.229 --> 01:12:43.239 align:start position:0%
do agree that there are some edits to be
 
01:12:43.239 --> 01:12:45.510 align:start position:0%
do agree that there are some edits to be
made

01:12:45.510 --> 01:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
made
 
01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:47.030 align:start position:0%
made
um

01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:51.310 --> 01:12:51.320 align:start position:0%
editorial uh but the in regards to uh
 
01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:53.070 align:start position:0%
editorial uh but the in regards to uh
281.50

01:12:53.070 --> 01:12:53.080 align:start position:0%
281.50
 
01:12:57.590 --> 01:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
3 uh the proposed would be L uh
 
01:13:00.669 --> 01:13:00.679 align:start position:0%
regarding the Social Security number so
 
01:13:02.629 --> 01:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
this is really a requirement for the
 
01:13:06.709 --> 01:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
vendor ID um it it's pursuant to
 
01:13:10.750 --> 01:13:10.760 align:start position:0%
whatever process Das has set up so it
 
01:13:13.669 --> 01:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
it's how they get paid
 
01:13:17.910 --> 01:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
so I I think that the authority is
 
01:13:21.149 --> 01:13:21.159 align:start position:0%
within the rule it's within the statute
 
01:13:26.709 --> 01:13:26.719 align:start position:0%
to allow Das to establish the payment um
 
01:13:32.350 --> 01:13:32.360 align:start position:0%
uh no it the any rule needs specific
 
01:13:34.669 --> 01:13:34.679 align:start position:0%
statutory authority to collect a social
 
01:13:38.950 --> 01:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
security number it it's it you can't be
 
01:13:41.550 --> 01:13:41.560 align:start position:0%
derivative unless you unless you say
 
01:13:44.310 --> 01:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
here is the vendor identification number
 
01:13:47.070 --> 01:13:47.080 align:start position:0%
means the number assigned by da as per
 
01:13:50.510 --> 01:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
their rule which may be the case and let
 
01:13:52.229 --> 01:13:52.239 align:start position:0%
them collect the data
 
01:13:55.629 --> 01:13:55.639 align:start position:0%
okay that makes sense so that is
 
01:13:59.470 --> 01:13:59.480 align:start position:0%
something we can work with uh leg the um
 
01:14:03.229 --> 01:14:03.239 align:start position:0%
office with specific language on that
 
01:14:06.149 --> 01:14:06.159 align:start position:0%
Madam chair yes
 
01:14:08.350 --> 01:14:08.360 align:start position:0%
representative ask a question yes thank
 
01:14:10.669 --> 01:14:10.679 align:start position:0%
you so you say that there was no public
 
01:14:12.229 --> 01:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
comment but did you have a public
 
01:14:13.990 --> 01:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
hearing and if so what was the date of
 
01:14:19.470 --> 01:14:19.480 align:start position:0%
that hearing the public hearing was on
 
01:14:22.629 --> 01:14:22.639 align:start position:0%
April let me get the exact for
 
01:14:27.750 --> 01:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:30.830 --> 01:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
yeah and where was that hearing held it
 
01:14:34.110 --> 01:14:34.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:35.750 align:start position:0%
 
Agriculture

01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
Agriculture
 
01:14:38.310 --> 01:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
okay there were no attendees and no
 
01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:40.229 align:start position:0%
okay there were no attendees and no
public

01:14:40.229 --> 01:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:14:42.229 --> 01:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
comment and I trust that every
 
01:14:45.270 --> 01:14:45.280 align:start position:0%
veterinarian in the state was sent a
 
01:14:47.629 --> 01:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
notice I don't have personal knowledge
 
01:14:49.870 --> 01:14:49.880 align:start position:0%
of that Dr Crawford actually started the
 
01:14:52.790 --> 01:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
process of um this Rule and he he was
 
01:14:54.470 --> 01:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
the one that attended the public hearing
 
01:14:58.229 --> 01:14:58.239 align:start position:0%
so I was not involved until recently um
 
01:15:01.510 --> 01:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
so okay CU I would I can't address the
 
01:15:03.669 --> 01:15:03.679 align:start position:0%
committee with that just glancing at the
 
01:15:05.390 --> 01:15:05.400 align:start position:0%
rule it appears to affect V
 
01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:08.280 align:start position:0%
veterinarians specifically and they and
 
01:15:11.189 --> 01:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:11.199 --> 01:15:14.030 align:start position:0%
 
noticed

01:15:14.030 --> 01:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
noticed
 
01:15:17.070 --> 01:15:17.080 align:start position:0%
okay all right any other
 
01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:21.390 align:start position:0%
okay all right any other
comments

01:15:21.390 --> 01:15:21.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:24.270 --> 01:15:24.280 align:start position:0%
questions in that case I would move we
 
01:15:27.870 --> 01:15:27.880 align:start position:0%
have a prelim objection based on staff
 
01:15:30.030 --> 01:15:30.040 align:start position:0%
comments I'll
 
01:15:32.550 --> 01:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
second because
 
01:15:35.229 --> 01:15:35.239 align:start position:0%
you besides the
 
01:15:38.669 --> 01:15:38.679 align:start position:0%
um um editorial issues you really need
 
01:15:41.189 --> 01:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
to look at the Social Security Number
 
01:15:44.550 --> 01:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
issue and figure out who is authorized
 
01:15:48.510 --> 01:15:48.520 align:start position:0%
to ask for that if anyone is
 
01:15:52.709 --> 01:15:52.719 align:start position:0%
yes and if I could also ask the um the
 
01:15:54.669 --> 01:15:54.679 align:start position:0%
department to get back to us on whether
 
01:15:56.629 --> 01:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
or not veterinarians were notified of
 
01:15:58.669 --> 01:15:58.679 align:start position:0%
the public hearing as opposed to just
 
01:16:00.030 --> 01:16:00.040 align:start position:0%
something who was
 
01:16:02.030 --> 01:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
notified who was notified who was
 
01:16:03.550 --> 01:16:03.560 align:start position:0%
notified besides just putting something
 
01:16:06.550 --> 01:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
in the newspaper the but besides the the
 
01:16:08.950 --> 01:16:08.960 align:start position:0%
regist regist
 
01:16:11.070 --> 01:16:11.080 align:start position:0%
correct that's not something that I
 
01:16:12.750 --> 01:16:12.760 align:start position:0%
would imagine most people in the state
 
01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:14.390 align:start position:0%
would imagine most people in the state
read

01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:14.400 align:start position:0%

01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:16.350 align:start position:0%

01:16:19.950 --> 01:16:19.960 align:start position:0%
I so yes we like to know if anyone and
 
01:16:22.149 --> 01:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
we will I'll we will ask Dr Crawford who
 
01:16:23.910 --> 01:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
was specifically
 
01:16:27.390 --> 01:16:27.400 align:start position:0%
notified all right is and uh any further
 
01:16:30.430 --> 01:16:30.440 align:start position:0%
discussion comments
 
01:16:32.910 --> 01:16:32.920 align:start position:0%
questions all right seeing none those in
 
01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
favor I
 
01:16:38.149 --> 01:16:38.159 align:start position:0%
opposed all right thank you very much
 
01:16:42.470 --> 01:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:45.390 --> 01:16:45.400 align:start position:0%
luck all right
 
01:16:49.270 --> 01:16:49.280 align:start position:0%
Dees so this is proposal 2024 53 The
 
01:16:51.790 --> 01:16:51.800 align:start position:0%
Collection storage and transfer facility
 
01:16:54.030 --> 01:16:54.040 align:start position:0%
requirements the only comment I had on
 
01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
this proposal was a note to the
 
01:16:57.750 --> 01:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
committee letting them know that the FIS
 
01:16:59.149 --> 01:16:59.159 align:start position:0%
indicated that there would be a
 
01:17:02.110 --> 01:17:02.120 align:start position:0%
potential increase to the in cost to the
 
01:17:04.830 --> 01:17:04.840 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions so we did take a
 
01:17:07.669 --> 01:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
further look into that um the rules the
 
01:17:10.870 --> 01:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
potential cost would be adding a permit
 
01:17:13.070 --> 01:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
by notification for collection centers
 
01:17:17.629 --> 01:17:17.639 align:start position:0%
for non select recyclable materials and
 
01:17:19.270 --> 01:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
I had to get clarification from the
 
01:17:20.590 --> 01:17:20.600 align:start position:0%
Department because I didn't quite
 
01:17:22.510 --> 01:17:22.520 align:start position:0%
understand what that meant and and
 
01:17:26.189 --> 01:17:26.199 align:start position:0%
essentially a non-select recyc material
 
01:17:28.990 --> 01:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
is something that is not comprised of
 
01:17:31.550 --> 01:17:31.560 align:start position:0%
paper cardboard glass plastic your
 
01:17:33.830 --> 01:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
typical recyclable material so for
 
01:17:36.310 --> 01:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
example it would be vegetable oil or
 
01:17:40.590 --> 01:17:40.600 align:start position:0%
tires so it seems like a completely
 
01:17:44.189 --> 01:17:44.199 align:start position:0%
voluntary program or service that towns
 
01:17:47.390 --> 01:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
would provide their residents and based
 
01:17:50.430 --> 01:17:50.440 align:start position:0%
on an analysis of the case conquered
 
01:17:53.229 --> 01:17:53.239 align:start position:0%
city of conquered versus State um I did
 
01:17:55.470 --> 01:17:55.480 align:start position:0%
not see that there was a
 
01:17:58.189 --> 01:17:58.199 align:start position:0%
violation of article 28a of the
 
01:18:00.430 --> 01:18:00.440 align:start position:0%
Constitution so I just wanted to make
 
01:18:01.790 --> 01:18:01.800 align:start position:0%
the committee aware of that but besides
 
01:18:05.270 --> 01:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
that I had no other comments okay and my
 
01:18:06.629 --> 01:18:06.639 align:start position:0%
understanding is that a permit by
 
01:18:09.470 --> 01:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
notification is much less of a problem
 
01:18:12.430 --> 01:18:12.440 align:start position:0%
than a normal normal permit yes I I did
 
01:18:13.790 --> 01:18:13.800 align:start position:0%
reach out to the department about that
 
01:18:15.910 --> 01:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
as well and they explained that there is
 
01:18:19.350 --> 01:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
no fee to apply for that permit and it
 
01:18:21.229 --> 01:18:21.239 align:start position:0%
is a much easier process than their
 
01:18:27.430 --> 01:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:30.189 --> 01:18:30.199 align:start position:0%
is the department
 
01:18:33.870 --> 01:18:33.880 align:start position:0%
here you any any comments or information
 
01:18:38.110 --> 01:18:38.120 align:start position:0%
for the committee no
 
01:18:40.870 --> 01:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
okay does someone have a motion in that
 
01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:42.070 align:start position:0%
okay does someone have a motion in that
case

01:18:42.070 --> 01:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
case
 
01:18:44.830 --> 01:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
approve second okay moved by
 
01:18:46.310 --> 01:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt second by
 
01:18:50.669 --> 01:18:50.679 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn those in favor I
 
01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
opposed all right thank you very much
 
01:18:55.390 --> 01:18:55.400 align:start position:0%
that's that one
 
01:18:55.400 --> 01:19:00.910 align:start position:0%
that's that one
additional

01:19:00.910 --> 01:19:00.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:03.270 --> 01:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
requirements the next one is
 
01:19:05.750 --> 01:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
22456 it is additional solid waste
 
01:19:08.910 --> 01:19:08.920 align:start position:0%
facility requirements um and the issue
 
01:19:12.189 --> 01:19:12.199 align:start position:0%
with this rule is the certifications on
 
01:19:14.950 --> 01:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
the forms are not spelled out in the
 
01:19:18.310 --> 01:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
rule text so they don't match that is a
 
01:19:21.790 --> 01:19:21.800 align:start position:0%
legislative um intent issue and it is
 
01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
throughout the rule in several places
 
01:19:25.510 --> 01:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
for the different forms
 
01:19:27.870 --> 01:19:27.880 align:start position:0%
um a conditional approval would have
 
01:19:29.470 --> 01:19:29.480 align:start position:0%
fixed this
 
01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:33.830 align:start position:0%
fixed this
but

01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:36.510 --> 01:19:36.520 align:start position:0%
okay the a agency could say whether
 
01:19:52.149 --> 01:19:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:54.910 --> 01:19:54.920 align:start position:0%
that good morning uh my name is Emily
 
01:19:56.629 --> 01:19:56.639 align:start position:0%
Jones I'm the rules coordinator for the
 
01:19:58.229 --> 01:19:58.239 align:start position:0%
solid waste management Bureau of the
 
01:20:00.750 --> 01:20:00.760 align:start position:0%
department um and also the compliance
 
01:20:04.030 --> 01:20:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:06.790 --> 01:20:06.800 align:start position:0%
supervisor Jamie Colby I'm supervisor of
 
01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
the engineering and permitting section
 
01:20:11.270 --> 01:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
and the solid waste management Bureau uh
 
01:20:12.990 --> 01:20:13.000 align:start position:0%
we collectively have worked quite a bit
 
01:20:15.270 --> 01:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
on these rules so hopefully if you have
 
01:20:21.310 --> 01:20:21.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:23.590 --> 01:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
collectively well the issue is that the
 
01:20:26.669 --> 01:20:26.679 align:start position:0%
certifications on the forms don't match
 
01:20:30.149 --> 01:20:30.159 align:start position:0%
the certifications in the rule text and
 
01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
that can only be uh fixed with either a
 
01:20:36.310 --> 01:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
preliminary objection or a postponement
 
01:20:41.390 --> 01:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:43.669 --> 01:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
approval question sorry trying to figure
 
01:20:44.629 --> 01:20:44.639 align:start position:0%
out the
 
01:20:47.550 --> 01:20:47.560 align:start position:0%
question so would you like the committee
 
01:20:49.990 --> 01:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
to postpone and you come back with a
 
01:20:51.870 --> 01:20:51.880 align:start position:0%
conditional approval or would you prefer
 
01:20:53.709 --> 01:20:53.719 align:start position:0%
a preliminary objection to come back
 
01:20:58.390 --> 01:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
with a change text um why don't we do
 
01:21:01.070 --> 01:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
the which would get us a quicker uh
 
01:21:02.629 --> 01:21:02.639 align:start position:0%
turnaround time because these are these
 
01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
are pretty you know relatively
 
01:21:08.229 --> 01:21:08.239 align:start position:0%
straightforward edits that we can make
 
01:21:10.110 --> 01:21:10.120 align:start position:0%
probably the conditional approval would
 
01:21:12.189 --> 01:21:12.199 align:start position:0%
be quicker okay you wouldn't you
 
01:21:14.470 --> 01:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to come back okay in that
 
01:21:17.629 --> 01:21:17.639 align:start position:0%
to us no yes you'd have to come back
 
01:21:19.870 --> 01:21:19.880 align:start position:0%
to they haven't filed a conditional
 
01:21:22.070 --> 01:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
approval so you'd have to postpone and
 
01:21:23.270 --> 01:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
they would file a conditional approval
 
01:21:26.070 --> 01:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
for the November me do November meeting
 
01:21:29.629 --> 01:21:29.639 align:start position:0%
October meeting sorry October meeting
 
01:21:33.990 --> 01:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
okay okay okay so the committee want to
 
01:21:38.229 --> 01:21:38.239 align:start position:0%
postpone to ask for M I move to postpone
 
01:21:41.709 --> 01:21:41.719 align:start position:0%
the rule and to provide the department
 
01:21:44.030 --> 01:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
more time to submit a conditional
 
01:21:46.669 --> 01:21:46.679 align:start position:0%
approval second all right thank you
 
01:21:48.629 --> 01:21:48.639 align:start position:0%
representative hacken Phillips in our
 
01:21:51.110 --> 01:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
deadline is October 28th so it looks
 
01:21:53.669 --> 01:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
like we wouldn't even need a waiver
 
01:21:55.550 --> 01:21:55.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you oh excuse
 
01:21:58.430 --> 01:21:58.440 align:start position:0%
me the motion is
 
01:22:04.110 --> 01:22:04.120 align:start position:0%
to um postpone this those in favor I
 
01:22:07.990 --> 01:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
opposed all right thank you thank you
 
01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.870 align:start position:0%
opposed all right thank you thank you
all

01:22:10.870 --> 01:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:13.070 --> 01:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
right all right the installation
 
01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:18.750 align:start position:0%
right all right the installation
Standards

01:22:18.750 --> 01:22:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:21.669 --> 01:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
Board okay this is 20
 
01:22:24.149 --> 01:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
2485 installation and manufactured
 
01:22:24.159 --> 01:22:25.390 align:start position:0%
2485 installation and manufactured
housing

01:22:25.390 --> 01:22:25.400 align:start position:0%
housing
 
01:22:28.910 --> 01:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
standards um the rules are expired they
 
01:22:32.430 --> 01:22:32.440 align:start position:0%
expired um in May of
 
01:22:35.790 --> 01:22:35.800 align:start position:0%
2023 and the other issue is there's a
 
01:22:38.270 --> 01:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
citation that normally we would do as an
 
01:22:42.430 --> 01:22:42.440 align:start position:0%
edit but it's it's the rule says
 
01:22:45.189 --> 01:22:45.199 align:start position:0%
305a and it's I think it's two supposed
 
01:22:48.189 --> 01:22:48.199 align:start position:0%
to be 205d so it's enough of a change
 
01:22:53.229 --> 01:22:53.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:56.390 --> 01:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
issue good morning Tina Kelly rules
 
01:22:58.470 --> 01:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
coordinator office of professional lure
 
01:23:01.750 --> 01:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
and certification we can make that
 
01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
change as
 
01:23:07.390 --> 01:23:07.400 align:start position:0%
requested um and with regards to the
 
01:23:09.229 --> 01:23:09.239 align:start position:0%
expiration of these
 
01:23:12.590 --> 01:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
rules um the first part is that um
 
01:23:15.790 --> 01:23:15.800 align:start position:0%
normally the towns if they have staff
 
01:23:17.629 --> 01:23:17.639 align:start position:0%
towns and cities if they have staff they
 
01:23:22.149 --> 01:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
do these inspections the oplc does not
 
01:23:25.270 --> 01:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
um but however if um a town or does not
 
01:23:27.310 --> 01:23:27.320 align:start position:0%
have somebody to do the inspections they
 
01:23:30.750 --> 01:23:30.760 align:start position:0%
will request that the oplc do them using
 
01:23:32.189 --> 01:23:32.199 align:start position:0%
the board's
 
01:23:35.950 --> 01:23:35.960 align:start position:0%
rules and um we've only had one in
 
01:23:38.669 --> 01:23:38.679 align:start position:0%
request in the past year which was done
 
01:23:41.590 --> 01:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
and there were no
 
01:23:44.790 --> 01:23:44.800 align:start position:0%
um nothing found there were no and I
 
01:23:46.510 --> 01:23:46.520 align:start position:0%
don't want to use the word violations
 
01:23:49.910 --> 01:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
but there were no um citable violations
 
01:23:51.790 --> 01:23:51.800 align:start position:0%
citable violations
 
01:23:54.590 --> 01:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
found and to that extent any of the
 
01:23:56.910 --> 01:23:56.920 align:start position:0%
inspections would be done based off of
 
01:24:01.270 --> 01:24:01.280 align:start position:0%
the law and it's very explicit in 205- D
 
01:24:06.149 --> 01:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
colon 3 and 205- D Po in five what the
 
01:24:08.590 --> 01:24:08.600 align:start position:0%
inspection should include when it should
 
01:24:10.990 --> 01:24:11.000 align:start position:0%
happen and how it should
 
01:24:16.950 --> 01:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
happen um you do mean 502 not 205 205 I
 
01:24:19.709 --> 01:24:19.719 align:start position:0%
mean what's two what does 205 have to do
 
01:24:22.110 --> 01:24:22.120 align:start position:0%
with these rules these are these are 500
 
01:24:24.830 --> 01:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
or formerly 500 current
 
01:24:28.870 --> 01:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
600 I mean the RSA 205d oh the RSA I'm
 
01:24:32.110 --> 01:24:32.120 align:start position:0%
sorry RSA excuse me thank you I was no
 
01:24:34.830 --> 01:24:34.840 align:start position:0%
wonder I'm confused I'm not used to S
 
01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:36.990 align:start position:0%
wonder I'm confused I'm not used to S
short

01:24:36.990 --> 01:24:37.000 align:start position:0%
short
 
01:24:39.070 --> 01:24:39.080 align:start position:0%
numbers all right
 
01:24:42.070 --> 01:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
so uh but
 
01:24:46.390 --> 01:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
the the fee for inspections in expired
 
01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:50.550 align:start position:0%
the the fee for inspections in expired
in

01:24:50.550 --> 01:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:54.590 --> 01:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
2013 and I don't believe oplc has charge
 
01:24:57.149 --> 01:24:57.159 align:start position:0%
it until
 
01:25:00.149 --> 01:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
they um got their rules in
 
01:25:05.070 --> 01:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:07.910 --> 01:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
replaced and where is where is the fee
 
01:25:10.709 --> 01:25:10.719 align:start position:0%
citation well I'm just looking at your
 
01:25:14.629 --> 01:25:14.639 align:start position:0%
the your summary on on the just you know
 
01:25:16.870 --> 01:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
the last bullet is that
 
01:25:19.629 --> 01:25:19.639 align:start position:0%
former rule
 
01:25:22.590 --> 01:25:22.600 align:start position:0%
50205 which expired
 
01:25:25.870 --> 01:25:25.880 align:start position:0%
51513 describ the Fe fees and it's not
 
01:25:28.390 --> 01:25:28.400 align:start position:0%
included in the set of rules so where
 
01:25:31.950 --> 01:25:31.960 align:start position:0%
are the fees okay they they will be in a
 
01:25:34.870 --> 01:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
um any citations to fees within the
 
01:25:36.790 --> 01:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
board's rules as I'm working on these
 
01:25:39.870 --> 01:25:39.880 align:start position:0%
rules because theirs are expired will
 
01:25:42.270 --> 01:25:42.280 align:start position:0%
point to op
 
01:25:45.229 --> 01:25:45.239 align:start position:0%
LC's rules PLC
 
01:25:45.239 --> 01:25:47.070 align:start position:0%
LC's rules PLC
1,000

01:25:47.070 --> 01:25:47.080 align:start position:0%
1,000
 
01:25:52.350 --> 01:25:52.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:55.470 --> 01:25:55.480 align:start position:0%
so so the so that they are not included
 
01:25:58.270 --> 01:25:58.280 align:start position:0%
here and those those PLC rules were
 
01:26:00.870 --> 01:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
effective August 1st of last year of
 
01:26:03.590 --> 01:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
this year last year last year okay did
 
01:26:06.990 --> 01:26:07.000 align:start position:0%
they include the manufactured housing
 
01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
inspections I mean because I as I recall
 
01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
it those fees were uh we've been adding
 
01:26:15.830 --> 01:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
to them if I might help mam chair I
 
01:26:18.430 --> 01:26:18.440 align:start position:0%
think this has to do with that huge
 
01:26:19.830 --> 01:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
01:26:22.390 --> 01:26:22.400 align:start position:0%
655 and I think House Bill the
 
01:26:24.390 --> 01:26:24.400 align:start position:0%
manufacturing portion of that the
 
01:26:28.189 --> 01:26:28.199 align:start position:0%
amendment to that was dealt with last
 
01:26:31.629 --> 01:26:31.639 align:start position:0%
year um so I guess the question would
 
01:26:34.109 --> 01:26:34.119 align:start position:0%
have been if the rules if the rules for
 
01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
the fees had expired in
 
01:26:38.990 --> 01:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
2013 and op PLC wasn't given the
 
01:26:41.709 --> 01:26:41.719 align:start position:0%
Authority for the fees until let's say
 
01:26:45.350 --> 01:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
even last year what happened between
 
01:26:47.390 --> 01:26:47.400 align:start position:0%
2013 and
 
01:26:50.830 --> 01:26:50.840 align:start position:0%
2023 that I do not know um I checked on
 
01:26:52.709 --> 01:26:52.719 align:start position:0%
whether or not they had enforced the
 
01:26:54.990 --> 01:26:55.000 align:start position:0%
rules how they enforc them I did not
 
01:26:56.830 --> 01:26:56.840 align:start position:0%
look into what the fees were because
 
01:26:59.590 --> 01:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
they weren't in here
 
01:27:03.070 --> 01:27:03.080 align:start position:0%
specifically the fees are in PLC
 
01:27:06.950 --> 01:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
100117 for inspections okay thank you so
 
01:27:09.950 --> 01:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
we're covered for the most recent
 
01:27:14.510 --> 01:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
year for the decade before that we're
 
01:27:17.629 --> 01:27:17.639 align:start position:0%
uh we're wondering what the board did
 
01:27:20.149 --> 01:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
that I do not know I can find
 
01:27:24.229 --> 01:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
out thank you
 
01:27:26.310 --> 01:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
curiosity we would very much like to
 
01:27:30.510 --> 01:27:30.520 align:start position:0%
know because this is a recurrent concern
 
01:27:31.950 --> 01:27:31.960 align:start position:0%
I will get that information and get it
 
01:27:35.189 --> 01:27:35.199 align:start position:0%
to you okay
 
01:27:37.709 --> 01:27:37.719 align:start position:0%
um so these
 
01:27:40.709 --> 01:27:40.719 align:start position:0%
are the complete rules other than the
 
01:27:47.270 --> 01:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:51.070 --> 01:27:51.080 align:start position:0%
correct these are the correct and
 
01:27:54.470 --> 01:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
complete rules for inspecting manufactur
 
01:27:56.750 --> 01:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
housing installations and there's no
 
01:28:01.189 --> 01:28:01.199 align:start position:0%
other part that needs to be included but
 
01:28:03.270 --> 01:28:03.280 align:start position:0%
not with this set but there they have
 
01:28:05.750 --> 01:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
other rules that will be coming through
 
01:28:08.990 --> 01:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:11.390 --> 01:28:11.400 align:start position:0%
expired okay so you have a whole bunch
 
01:28:15.350 --> 01:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
of of expired rules as well as the fees
 
01:28:16.790 --> 01:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
all right that's correct and I'm working
 
01:28:18.430 --> 01:28:18.440 align:start position:0%
on all those to get them through as fast
 
01:28:21.030 --> 01:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
as possible thank
 
01:28:27.189 --> 01:28:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:30.550 --> 01:28:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:32.669 --> 01:28:32.679 align:start position:0%
motion I'm just trying to figure out
 
01:28:34.790 --> 01:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
what the appropriate motion would be it
 
01:28:36.990 --> 01:28:37.000 align:start position:0%
would be a motion for oral conditional
 
01:28:39.109 --> 01:28:39.119 align:start position:0%
approval I'm sorry can you repeat that
 
01:28:41.709 --> 01:28:41.719 align:start position:0%
it would be a a motion for an oral
 
01:28:43.629 --> 01:28:43.639 align:start position:0%
conditional approval request okay so
 
01:28:46.310 --> 01:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
moved I moved a I'll move a um motion
 
01:28:50.030 --> 01:28:50.040 align:start position:0%
for oral conditional request second
 
01:28:55.470 --> 01:28:55.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:58.830 --> 01:28:58.840 align:start position:0%
okay so I so if I understand correctly
 
01:29:02.990 --> 01:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
the housing insulation uh board was
 
01:29:05.390 --> 01:29:05.400 align:start position:0%
moved to oplc quite
 
01:29:09.709 --> 01:29:09.719 align:start position:0%
recently correct okay so
 
01:29:13.350 --> 01:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
we it's all right thank you any further
 
01:29:18.070 --> 01:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
comments question those in favor I
 
01:29:21.270 --> 01:29:21.280 align:start position:0%
oppose all right good luck thank you and
 
01:29:23.590 --> 01:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
we would like to know what happened with
 
01:29:29.510 --> 01:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:31.830 --> 01:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
year all
 
01:29:37.709 --> 01:29:37.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:40.790 --> 01:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
terrain these rules were inter rules and
 
01:29:42.990 --> 01:29:43.000 align:start position:0%
they expired in
 
01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.629 align:start position:0%
they expired in
20

01:29:45.629 --> 01:29:45.639 align:start position:0%
20
 
01:29:45.639 --> 01:29:47.510 align:start position:0%
20
2008

01:29:47.510 --> 01:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
2008
 
01:30:00.830 --> 01:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:02.390 --> 01:30:02.400 align:start position:0%
any other
 
01:30:05.229 --> 01:30:05.239 align:start position:0%
comments the only other comment um was a
 
01:30:08.270 --> 01:30:08.280 align:start position:0%
Clarity comment um on page
 
01:30:12.310 --> 01:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
four the department is using so major
 
01:30:14.390 --> 01:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
potential harm means a substantial
 
01:30:16.510 --> 01:30:16.520 align:start position:0%
likelihood of causing harm to human
 
01:30:19.390 --> 01:30:19.400 align:start position:0%
health or environment or the environment
 
01:30:21.390 --> 01:30:21.400 align:start position:0%
and it also uses moderate likelihood and
 
01:30:23.109 --> 01:30:23.119 align:start position:0%
small likelihood and there was just
 
01:30:25.590 --> 01:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
there was some discussion about how
 
01:30:27.910 --> 01:30:27.920 align:start position:0%
clear that is it's a little subjective
 
01:30:29.669 --> 01:30:29.679 align:start position:0%
but it's also you know they're trying to
 
01:30:32.149 --> 01:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
to create a a scale of how how they
 
01:30:36.870 --> 01:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
would um meter out fines and there is a
 
01:30:39.310 --> 01:30:39.320 align:start position:0%
there's a table at the bottom that kind
 
01:30:42.189 --> 01:30:42.199 align:start position:0%
of shows what those would be if you know
 
01:30:44.310 --> 01:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
you had a moderate deviation with
 
01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:45.229 align:start position:0%
you had a moderate deviation with
potential

01:30:45.229 --> 01:30:45.239 align:start position:0%
potential
 
01:30:49.590 --> 01:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
harm so there is a Clarity issue there
 
01:30:53.270 --> 01:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
but okay and so I am Courtney Lockwood
 
01:30:54.550 --> 01:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
I'm one of the staff at attorneys for
 
01:30:56.790 --> 01:30:56.800 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental
 
01:30:59.669 --> 01:30:59.679 align:start position:0%
Services and rainy peler I'm the Water
 
01:31:01.990 --> 01:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
Division director at
 
01:31:05.430 --> 01:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
Dees um so we've been before you before
 
01:31:06.910 --> 01:31:06.920 align:start position:0%
about this issue with these fine rules
 
01:31:10.070 --> 01:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
that expired in 2008 um and we are in
 
01:31:12.709 --> 01:31:12.719 align:start position:0%
the process of adopting rules specific
 
01:31:14.590 --> 01:31:14.600 align:start position:0%
to each program that requires a schedule
 
01:31:17.030 --> 01:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
of fines um and so this is the
 
01:31:18.750 --> 01:31:18.760 align:start position:0%
alteration of terrain rules that are
 
01:31:20.229 --> 01:31:20.239 align:start position:0%
before you so that we can try to fix
 
01:31:22.229 --> 01:31:22.239 align:start position:0%
this issue we have not been charging
 
01:31:24.629 --> 01:31:24.639 align:start position:0%
fines absolutely in any program that
 
01:31:26.950 --> 01:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a schedule of fines since
 
01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:28.750 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a schedule of fines since
early

01:31:28.750 --> 01:31:28.760 align:start position:0%
early
 
01:31:31.270 --> 01:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
2022 for the alteration of terrain
 
01:31:34.229 --> 01:31:34.239 align:start position:0%
program I don't have specific numbers
 
01:31:37.390 --> 01:31:37.400 align:start position:0%
it's rare for us to go for fines in this
 
01:31:40.070 --> 01:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
particular program um our preferences
 
01:31:42.229 --> 01:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
for compliance and Restoration in all of
 
01:31:44.550 --> 01:31:44.560 align:start position:0%
our programs anyways but alteration of
 
01:31:46.870 --> 01:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
terrain in particular um if we find out
 
01:31:48.390 --> 01:31:48.400 align:start position:0%
someone didn't get a permit we try to
 
01:31:49.590 --> 01:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
get them to go through the process to
 
01:31:51.790 --> 01:31:51.800 align:start position:0%
get an after the fact permit and restore
 
01:31:53.990 --> 01:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
any areas that might have been damaged
 
01:31:56.149 --> 01:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
as a result of not having the permit in
 
01:32:00.109 --> 01:32:00.119 align:start position:0%
our review so this so these are fines
 
01:32:03.350 --> 01:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
primarily for not having a a permit it's
 
01:32:04.830 --> 01:32:04.840 align:start position:0%
not just for having a permit you could
 
01:32:06.350 --> 01:32:06.360 align:start position:0%
also have a permit that has conditions
 
01:32:07.830 --> 01:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
and you violated the conditions or
 
01:32:09.990 --> 01:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
didn't follow the permit um those are
 
01:32:12.709 --> 01:32:12.719 align:start position:0%
less common for us but that does happen
 
01:32:14.270 --> 01:32:14.280 align:start position:0%
Okay um there's also some technical
 
01:32:17.030 --> 01:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
rules in here that were meant to address
 
01:32:18.830 --> 01:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
um some objections that the Home
 
01:32:21.629 --> 01:32:21.639 align:start position:0%
Builders Association raised last fall um
 
01:32:23.149 --> 01:32:23.159 align:start position:0%
so this isn't just the fine rules it's
 
01:32:24.750 --> 01:32:24.760 align:start position:0%
also to address those concerns that you
 
01:32:28.430 --> 01:32:28.440 align:start position:0%
all heard last fall thank
 
01:32:31.470 --> 01:32:31.480 align:start position:0%
you repres gr just for a question for
 
01:32:33.430 --> 01:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
the gel car I do believe that we had
 
01:32:35.950 --> 01:32:35.960 align:start position:0%
something last we something before us
 
01:32:38.629 --> 01:32:38.639 align:start position:0%
already by the Home Builders Association
 
01:32:43.270 --> 01:32:43.280 align:start position:0%
for terrain did we not so that was last
 
01:32:45.510 --> 01:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
fall we had adopted new rules in
 
01:32:48.189 --> 01:32:48.199 align:start position:0%
September and then the Home Builders
 
01:32:50.270 --> 01:32:50.280 align:start position:0%
Association sent you all a letter I
 
01:32:51.830 --> 01:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
believe in October or November I don't
 
01:32:53.430 --> 01:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
remember the exact dates raising some
 
01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:54.590 align:start position:0%
remember the exact dates raising some
objection

01:32:54.590 --> 01:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
objection
 
01:32:56.669 --> 01:32:56.679 align:start position:0%
um and the instructions from this
 
01:32:58.750 --> 01:32:58.760 align:start position:0%
committee was for all of us to meet and
 
01:33:01.109 --> 01:33:01.119 align:start position:0%
try to sort it out and we did that and
 
01:33:02.590 --> 01:33:02.600 align:start position:0%
this is the result of that the fine
 
01:33:04.390 --> 01:33:04.400 align:start position:0%
rules had nothing to do with the Home
 
01:33:05.790 --> 01:33:05.800 align:start position:0%
Builders Association we just already
 
01:33:07.229 --> 01:33:07.239 align:start position:0%
knew we needed to do those so the
 
01:33:09.310 --> 01:33:09.320 align:start position:0%
previous rules were the technical rules
 
01:33:11.310 --> 01:33:11.320 align:start position:0%
on how to apply and what the criteria
 
01:33:13.590 --> 01:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
were correct and this is about the
 
01:33:15.629 --> 01:33:15.639 align:start position:0%
mostly the fines this is mostly about
 
01:33:17.910 --> 01:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
fines there are two rules in there that
 
01:33:19.950 --> 01:33:19.960 align:start position:0%
were amended in order to address the
 
01:33:21.310 --> 01:33:21.320 align:start position:0%
home builders
 
01:33:24.149 --> 01:33:24.159 align:start position:0%
association's concerns okay we added
 
01:33:26.590 --> 01:33:26.600 align:start position:0%
some flexibility basically I'm sorry we
 
01:33:29.390 --> 01:33:29.400 align:start position:0%
added some flexibility to our rules to
 
01:33:31.750 --> 01:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
address always a good
 
01:33:34.510 --> 01:33:34.520 align:start position:0%
idea any other questions representative
 
01:33:36.550 --> 01:33:36.560 align:start position:0%
Alon um thank you madam chair my
 
01:33:38.030 --> 01:33:38.040 align:start position:0%
question was just around the minor
 
01:33:40.629 --> 01:33:40.639 align:start position:0%
moderate and major potential for harm
 
01:33:42.109 --> 01:33:42.119 align:start position:0%
and I just wasn't sure if there is any
 
01:33:44.149 --> 01:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
way because it's hard to prescribe that
 
01:33:45.990 --> 01:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
going forward to sort of review it after
 
01:33:47.350 --> 01:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
the fact to make sure that it's been
 
01:33:49.229 --> 01:33:49.239 align:start position:0%
consistent and see if there's any role
 
01:33:51.310 --> 01:33:51.320 align:start position:0%
changes needed for clarity is there a
 
01:33:52.709 --> 01:33:52.719 align:start position:0%
process for
 
01:33:55.790 --> 01:33:55.800 align:start position:0%
that for reviewing what how they're
 
01:33:58.669 --> 01:33:58.679 align:start position:0%
interpreting it
 
01:34:01.189 --> 01:34:01.199 align:start position:0%
yes these rules are new it's the same
 
01:34:03.470 --> 01:34:03.480 align:start position:0%
language that was adopted in other fine
 
01:34:05.430 --> 01:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
rules we can't really seem to figure out
 
01:34:08.270 --> 01:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
a way to word it differently keep in
 
01:34:11.030 --> 01:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
mind these are proposed fines so the
 
01:34:12.990 --> 01:34:13.000 align:start position:0%
criteria is this to help us determine
 
01:34:15.149 --> 01:34:15.159 align:start position:0%
proposed fines but then the person has
 
01:34:17.910 --> 01:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
the right to a hearing um and so the
 
01:34:20.470 --> 01:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
decision is actually made at the hearing
 
01:34:22.669 --> 01:34:22.679 align:start position:0%
this is just guidance that we used to
 
01:34:25.149 --> 01:34:25.159 align:start position:0%
initiate the proposal to fine and this
 
01:34:28.990 --> 01:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
is um the exact verbatim language as
 
01:34:30.669 --> 01:34:30.679 align:start position:0%
other proposals in that have been
 
01:34:33.270 --> 01:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
approved in the past and like I said we
 
01:34:35.149 --> 01:34:35.159 align:start position:0%
we talked about it a lot and I I can't
 
01:34:38.669 --> 01:34:38.679 align:start position:0%
figure out how El to it either so so so
 
01:34:41.470 --> 01:34:41.480 align:start position:0%
these numbers you say well this moderate
 
01:34:43.990 --> 01:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
moderate we don't really know which all
 
01:34:46.470 --> 01:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
right we'll we'll we'll try we'll find
 
01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:47.270 align:start position:0%
right we'll we'll we'll try we'll find
you

01:34:47.270 --> 01:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:34:49.669 --> 01:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
$1,250 and that's the start of the
 
01:34:52.590 --> 01:34:52.600 align:start position:0%
negotiation yes okay either negotiation
 
01:34:54.430 --> 01:34:54.440 align:start position:0%
or it goes to a hearing well at the
 
01:34:56.590 --> 01:34:56.600 align:start position:0%
hearing I'm sure there are negotiations
 
01:34:58.790 --> 01:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
even if the hearings examiner makes the
 
01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:00.510 align:start position:0%
even if the hearings examiner makes the
decision

01:35:00.510 --> 01:35:00.520 align:start position:0%
decision
 
01:35:03.990 --> 01:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
yes I have a question represent so the
 
01:35:06.790 --> 01:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
permit is issued by your department yes
 
01:35:10.070 --> 01:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up and so if someone
 
01:35:14.229 --> 01:35:14.239 align:start position:0%
let's say Mr Smith is an inspector and
 
01:35:17.669 --> 01:35:17.679 align:start position:0%
he finds so and so
 
01:35:21.030 --> 01:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
$1,250 how is it possible that different
 
01:35:23.149 --> 01:35:23.159 align:start position:0%
is it the same person that issues the
 
01:35:25.709 --> 01:35:25.719 align:start position:0%
fines that has the criteria for this how
 
01:35:28.510 --> 01:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
these findes issued and is it is it if
 
01:35:29.750 --> 01:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
because two people could have two
 
01:35:31.109 --> 01:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
different standards right they could
 
01:35:33.229 --> 01:35:33.239 align:start position:0%
have two differ definitions of what
 
01:35:35.990 --> 01:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
moderate is all administrative fine
 
01:35:38.229 --> 01:35:38.239 align:start position:0%
actions go through our legal unit so
 
01:35:39.990 --> 01:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
it's centralized of who makes that
 
01:35:42.669 --> 01:35:42.679 align:start position:0%
decision in our legal unit um and we
 
01:35:44.189 --> 01:35:44.199 align:start position:0%
just make the decision of what is
 
01:35:47.149 --> 01:35:47.159 align:start position:0%
proposed and bring that action um and
 
01:35:48.669 --> 01:35:48.679 align:start position:0%
then it's up to the hearing officer and
 
01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
ultimately our commissioner that makes
 
01:35:51.669 --> 01:35:51.679 align:start position:0%
the final decision so the hearing
 
01:35:53.350 --> 01:35:53.360 align:start position:0%
officer makes a recommendation based on
 
01:35:54.750 --> 01:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
the hearing and the commissioner makes
 
01:35:57.790 --> 01:35:57.800 align:start position:0%
the final decision last followup follow
 
01:36:01.629 --> 01:36:01.639 align:start position:0%
up so in the rules um you define this
 
01:36:03.070 --> 01:36:03.080 align:start position:0%
the significantly altered
 
01:36:04.870 --> 01:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
characteristics of the terrain right
 
01:36:08.030 --> 01:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
because that's what so is it possible
 
01:36:10.830 --> 01:36:10.840 align:start position:0%
that within that definition you can I'm
 
01:36:12.990 --> 01:36:13.000 align:start position:0%
going to assume that it's basically how
 
01:36:16.070 --> 01:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
much dirt you move and you know that's
 
01:36:17.950 --> 01:36:17.960 align:start position:0%
the basics of it yes right how much
 
01:36:20.030 --> 01:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
Earth you have Disturbed yes exactly
 
01:36:22.550 --> 01:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
Disturbed you and in relationship to
 
01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:24.189 align:start position:0%
Disturbed you and in relationship to
protected

01:36:24.189 --> 01:36:24.199 align:start position:0%
protected
 
01:36:27.350 --> 01:36:27.360 align:start position:0%
land whether it be Wetland Shoreland you
 
01:36:29.390 --> 01:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
know I mean it's in relationship to that
 
01:36:32.910 --> 01:36:32.920 align:start position:0%
correct uh not necessarily um this is
 
01:36:35.669 --> 01:36:35.679 align:start position:0%
for regulation of storm water so it's
 
01:36:38.709 --> 01:36:38.719 align:start position:0%
okay so um if if you are close to say
 
01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
protected shorel they um you can disturb
 
01:36:43.229 --> 01:36:43.239 align:start position:0%
less land and still need a permit
 
01:36:45.470 --> 01:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
correct correct correct the general
 
01:36:47.709 --> 01:36:47.719 align:start position:0%
criteria is 100,000 square feet but
 
01:36:49.109 --> 01:36:49.119 align:start position:0%
there are situations where it could be
 
01:36:50.709 --> 01:36:50.719 align:start position:0%
less and you would still need a permit
 
01:36:53.709 --> 01:36:53.719 align:start position:0%
so has the department looked at
 
01:36:56.990 --> 01:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
relationship to this moderate maximum
 
01:36:59.430 --> 01:36:59.440 align:start position:0%
minimum thing the amount of dirt moved
 
01:37:01.149 --> 01:37:01.159 align:start position:0%
and is that a criteria that you could
 
01:37:03.310 --> 01:37:03.320 align:start position:0%
use no no no
 
01:37:06.550 --> 01:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
okay it's where the dirt was moved from
 
01:37:10.550 --> 01:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
and to as much as how much I
 
01:37:14.149 --> 01:37:14.159 align:start position:0%
imagine thank you all right any other
 
01:37:14.159 --> 01:37:15.350 align:start position:0%
imagine thank you all right any other
questions

01:37:15.350 --> 01:37:15.360 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:37:18.510 --> 01:37:18.520 align:start position:0%
comments all right does does somebody
 
01:37:22.229 --> 01:37:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:25.590 --> 01:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
motion I'd like like to comment that I'm
 
01:37:28.590 --> 01:37:28.600 align:start position:0%
extremely concerned that your cross
 
01:37:31.189 --> 01:37:31.199 align:start position:0%
program rules expired better than 15
 
01:37:33.910 --> 01:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
years ago and you're just now getting
 
01:37:38.070 --> 01:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
around to setting the fines
 
01:37:40.790 --> 01:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
and that that
 
01:37:42.950 --> 01:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
seems very
 
01:37:45.189 --> 01:37:45.199 align:start position:0%
unprofessional and we assure you that
 
01:37:47.470 --> 01:37:47.480 align:start position:0%
that's what we're trying to fix and I'm
 
01:37:50.070 --> 01:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
also assuring you a commissioner for
 
01:37:52.310 --> 01:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
several years now has said if you don't
 
01:37:54.189 --> 01:37:54.199 align:start position:0%
have fine rules you are not proposing
 
01:37:56.990 --> 01:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
fines so every program installed until
 
01:37:57.950 --> 01:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:38:00.229 --> 01:38:00.239 align:start position:0%
fines but we only have so many staff to
 
01:38:01.990 --> 01:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
propose rules so we're we're trying to
 
01:38:03.870 --> 01:38:03.880 align:start position:0%
get through them all all right thank you
 
01:38:06.629 --> 01:38:06.639 align:start position:0%
repres so sorry I have another question
 
01:38:08.750 --> 01:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
so you had a public hearing for these
 
01:38:11.350 --> 01:38:11.360 align:start position:0%
proposed rules and what was a what was
 
01:38:13.750 --> 01:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
the comment to those rules into the
 
01:38:17.109 --> 01:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
potential fines there's starting on page
 
01:38:20.030 --> 01:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
six There's a summary of comments and
 
01:38:23.589 --> 01:38:23.599 align:start position:0%
response there thank you
 
01:38:25.750 --> 01:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
and it says that no member of the public
 
01:38:29.189 --> 01:38:29.199 align:start position:0%
provided comments we had um a few people
 
01:38:31.470 --> 01:38:31.480 align:start position:0%
show up but did not comment and then we
 
01:38:32.870 --> 01:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
didn't receive any written public
 
01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:33.880 align:start position:0%
didn't receive any written public
comments

01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:33.890 align:start position:0%
comments
 
01:38:33.890 --> 01:38:39.430 align:start position:0%
comments
[Music]

01:38:39.430 --> 01:38:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:41.990 --> 01:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
okay I'm amazed that you managed to get
 
01:38:45.830 --> 01:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
an alteration of of uh terrain no matter
 
01:38:49.790 --> 01:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
how narrow through uh without any public
 
01:38:51.589 --> 01:38:51.599 align:start position:0%
comment so I've got to congratulate you
 
01:38:54.430 --> 01:38:54.440 align:start position:0%
on that part thank you we were surpris
 
01:39:01.629 --> 01:39:01.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:04.950 --> 01:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
motion we're all going now we don't want
 
01:39:08.629 --> 01:39:08.639 align:start position:0%
to do it either you know well is this
 
01:39:10.550 --> 01:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
similar to the previous proposal where
 
01:39:13.589 --> 01:39:13.599 align:start position:0%
we have questions that that we can give
 
01:39:15.229 --> 01:39:15.239 align:start position:0%
them an
 
01:39:18.070 --> 01:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
oral conditional no because we don't
 
01:39:19.990 --> 01:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
know specifically what we want them to
 
01:39:22.669 --> 01:39:22.679 align:start position:0%
change them to for for conditional
 
01:39:24.750 --> 01:39:24.760 align:start position:0%
approval we have have to have a specific
 
01:39:27.510 --> 01:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
SE section saying change
 
01:39:30.510 --> 01:39:30.520 align:start position:0%
this um in this case it's only the
 
01:39:32.750 --> 01:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
concern about the expired rules appears
 
01:39:35.669 --> 01:39:35.679 align:start position:0%
to be the only noticeable
 
01:39:39.149 --> 01:39:39.159 align:start position:0%
comment so um in that case I will move
 
01:39:39.159 --> 01:39:40.270 align:start position:0%
comment so um in that case I will move
to

01:39:40.270 --> 01:39:40.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:39:43.790 --> 01:39:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:47.270 --> 01:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
issues second by representative Lynn
 
01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:49.430 align:start position:0%
issues second by representative Lynn
anyone

01:39:49.430 --> 01:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
01:39:51.550 --> 01:39:51.560 align:start position:0%
else comments
 
01:39:55.149 --> 01:39:55.159 align:start position:0%
questions way to run a rail
 
01:39:58.589 --> 01:39:58.599 align:start position:0%
those in favor I was
 
01:40:02.830 --> 01:40:02.840 align:start position:0%
opposed thank you and uh I hope your
 
01:40:06.870 --> 01:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
your uh other rules are moving right
 
01:40:10.270 --> 01:40:10.280 align:start position:0%
along thank you all right speaking of
 
01:40:14.629 --> 01:40:14.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:18.390 --> 01:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
fund so these rules are also expired but
 
01:40:20.990 --> 01:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
let me find the
 
01:40:25.430 --> 01:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
year more recently I hope more
 
01:40:27.750 --> 01:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
recently sorry I lost my place here we
 
01:40:32.390 --> 01:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
go um expired uh July of
 
01:40:36.070 --> 01:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
2024 so much more recently all right so
 
01:40:38.350 --> 01:40:38.360 align:start position:0%
um and the only note I have on on here
 
01:40:41.109 --> 01:40:41.119 align:start position:0%
is that there is um it's it's the Sino
 
01:40:43.109 --> 01:40:43.119 align:start position:0%
bacteria mitigation fund and so there
 
01:40:45.709 --> 01:40:45.719 align:start position:0%
are contracts that are made with the
 
01:40:47.030 --> 01:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
people that are getting the funds and
 
01:40:49.629 --> 01:40:49.639 align:start position:0%
the grants um that's usually not
 
01:40:52.350 --> 01:40:52.360 align:start position:0%
something that we can evaluate from a
 
01:40:54.189 --> 01:40:54.199 align:start position:0%
rules perspective
 
01:40:56.990 --> 01:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
um but the the kind of Meet the guts of
 
01:41:00.189 --> 01:41:00.199 align:start position:0%
the contract are in the rule text and
 
01:41:02.310 --> 01:41:02.320 align:start position:0%
they also go through um governor and
 
01:41:04.830 --> 01:41:04.840 align:start position:0%
Council for approval so that's kind of
 
01:41:07.189 --> 01:41:07.199 align:start position:0%
how that function works it's just it's
 
01:41:09.109 --> 01:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
not all written out in the rule because
 
01:41:15.189 --> 01:41:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:17.030 --> 01:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
okay any
 
01:41:18.950 --> 01:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
comments again Courtney Lockwood
 
01:41:21.750 --> 01:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
attorney for Dees Amy smula I'm a
 
01:41:24.550 --> 01:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
freshwater biologist at De
 
01:41:27.030 --> 01:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
yes I don't have any comments on the
 
01:41:29.589 --> 01:41:29.599 align:start position:0%
loan piece of this um we have another
 
01:41:31.270 --> 01:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
set of rules with this exact same
 
01:41:35.070 --> 01:41:35.080 align:start position:0%
language um the sorry the drinking water
 
01:41:37.430 --> 01:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
State revolving fund rules um which is
 
01:41:38.830 --> 01:41:38.840 align:start position:0%
where we pulled the language from that
 
01:41:40.629 --> 01:41:40.639 align:start position:0%
was approved previously I believe in
 
01:41:43.589 --> 01:41:43.599 align:start position:0%
2021 in terms of expiration um this was
 
01:41:46.550 --> 01:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
a new uh statute and so we had to
 
01:41:49.189 --> 01:41:49.199 align:start position:0%
quickly adopt interim rules that is what
 
01:41:52.390 --> 01:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
expired in July um and so this isn't
 
01:41:54.070 --> 01:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
about taking money this is about giving
 
01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:55.189 align:start position:0%
about taking money this is about giving
out

01:41:55.189 --> 01:41:55.199 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:41:58.470 --> 01:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
money um so I think we've only received
 
01:42:01.830 --> 01:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
one application since the time they've
 
01:42:05.830 --> 01:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
expired and we are within our without
 
01:42:07.830 --> 01:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
rules we have 60 days to make a decision
 
01:42:09.550 --> 01:42:09.560 align:start position:0%
and we're still within our 60 days to
 
01:42:11.310 --> 01:42:11.320 align:start position:0%
make a decision so we decided to hold
 
01:42:13.149 --> 01:42:13.159 align:start position:0%
off on making decision since we did not
 
01:42:16.030 --> 01:42:16.040 align:start position:0%
have rules um but if these are approved
 
01:42:17.910 --> 01:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
today they will be adopted in time so
 
01:42:20.629 --> 01:42:20.639 align:start position:0%
that we can still meet the 60-day
 
01:42:23.629 --> 01:42:23.639 align:start position:0%
deadline under 541a
 
01:42:25.270 --> 01:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
to make a decision and we will have the
 
01:42:28.510 --> 01:42:28.520 align:start position:0%
criteria for approval to be able to do
 
01:42:31.229 --> 01:42:31.239 align:start position:0%
that how
 
01:42:33.270 --> 01:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
convenient all right anyone else
 
01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:36.070 align:start position:0%
convenient all right anyone else
comments

01:42:36.070 --> 01:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:39.350 --> 01:42:39.360 align:start position:0%
questions okay Senator Chanley moves to
 
01:42:42.030 --> 01:42:42.040 align:start position:0%
approve second second by representative
 
01:42:45.709 --> 01:42:45.719 align:start position:0%
grassy any comments questions those in
 
01:42:48.189 --> 01:42:48.199 align:start position:0%
favor I I
 
01:43:05.750 --> 01:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:08.830 --> 01:43:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:11.030 --> 01:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
Grant they're holding off on the one
 
01:43:13.030 --> 01:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
request I think that's about all we can
 
01:43:14.390 --> 01:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
ask them to
 
01:43:16.910 --> 01:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
do okay
 
01:43:21.030 --> 01:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
HHS so this is proposal 202 4108
 
01:43:23.910 --> 01:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
protected income level the only comment
 
01:43:25.790 --> 01:43:25.800 align:start position:0%
I had on this was a note to the
 
01:43:28.149 --> 01:43:28.159 align:start position:0%
committee because the notice states that
 
01:43:30.149 --> 01:43:30.159 align:start position:0%
the rule is implementing For the First
 
01:43:34.390 --> 01:43:34.400 align:start position:0%
Time chapter 39 laws of
 
01:43:37.070 --> 01:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
2020 I did look into the legislative
 
01:43:40.750 --> 01:43:40.760 align:start position:0%
history of this statute and even though
 
01:43:44.430 --> 01:43:44.440 align:start position:0%
it took effect on June 30th 2021 it was
 
01:43:47.709 --> 01:43:47.719 align:start position:0%
then temporarily suspended um under
 
01:43:50.189 --> 01:43:50.199 align:start position:0%
chapter 91 laws of
 
01:43:53.550 --> 01:43:53.560 align:start position:0%
2021 which took effect July 1st 2021
 
01:43:54.790 --> 01:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
and then was
 
01:43:59.109 --> 01:43:59.119 align:start position:0%
reinstated uh effective January 1st 2023
 
01:44:01.550 --> 01:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
so even though the law first came in
 
01:44:03.390 --> 01:44:03.400 align:start position:0%
effect on
 
01:44:06.629 --> 01:44:06.639 align:start position:0%
2020 it really hasn't been fully in
 
01:44:09.070 --> 01:44:09.080 align:start position:0%
effect since January 1st 2023 but that's
 
01:44:11.870 --> 01:44:11.880 align:start position:0%
still is over a year since the statute
 
01:44:14.629 --> 01:44:14.639 align:start position:0%
went into effect so my note was just
 
01:44:17.270 --> 01:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
questioning why it took so long uh to
 
01:44:19.669 --> 01:44:19.679 align:start position:0%
get this rule into place after that one
 
01:44:19.679 --> 01:44:20.550 align:start position:0%
get this rule into place after that one
into

01:44:20.550 --> 01:44:20.560 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:44:22.790 --> 01:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
effect yes thank you we'd like to know
 
01:44:24.830 --> 01:44:24.840 align:start position:0%
that could I can understand it being
 
01:44:29.229 --> 01:44:29.239 align:start position:0%
suspended by hb2 but uh that's been a
 
01:44:31.830 --> 01:44:31.840 align:start position:0%
while sure uh good morning Nicole
 
01:44:33.589 --> 01:44:33.599 align:start position:0%
valenzula administrative rules
 
01:44:35.310 --> 01:44:35.320 align:start position:0%
coordinator for Department of Health and
 
01:44:38.589 --> 01:44:38.599 align:start position:0%
Human Services uh so yes so the chapter
 
01:44:40.149 --> 01:44:40.159 align:start position:0%
law did go in effect
 
01:44:43.149 --> 01:44:43.159 align:start position:0%
1123 which did Issue then authority to
 
01:44:45.189 --> 01:44:45.199 align:start position:0%
DHHS to be able to begin to implement
 
01:44:46.790 --> 01:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
this and do internal processes and
 
01:44:49.470 --> 01:44:49.480 align:start position:0%
changes and the state plan approval
 
01:44:51.070 --> 01:44:51.080 align:start position:0%
which did immediately happen and this
 
01:44:53.390 --> 01:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
did benefit recipients immediately and
 
01:44:56.070 --> 01:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
we started doing that uh and then it did
 
01:44:57.870 --> 01:44:57.880 align:start position:0%
just take us longer to get the rule into
 
01:44:59.589 --> 01:44:59.599 align:start position:0%
place we got held up a little bit with
 
01:45:02.189 --> 01:45:02.199 align:start position:0%
some Financial conversations internally
 
01:45:03.189 --> 01:45:03.199 align:start position:0%
and with
 
01:45:07.510 --> 01:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
LBA um and here we are so do do I
 
01:45:09.030 --> 01:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
understand you correctly to say that you
 
01:45:13.149 --> 01:45:13.159 align:start position:0%
started implementing the law in
 
01:45:15.870 --> 01:45:15.880 align:start position:0%
2023 and are just now getting around to
 
01:45:18.310 --> 01:45:18.320 align:start position:0%
having the rules yes so we began
 
01:45:19.910 --> 01:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
implementing it through because we did
 
01:45:22.430 --> 01:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
have statutory authority to do that and
 
01:45:25.070 --> 01:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
we had to update the state plan and we
 
01:45:28.189 --> 01:45:28.199 align:start position:0%
did do that internal processes were done
 
01:45:30.310 --> 01:45:30.320 align:start position:0%
documents policy changes everything went
 
01:45:33.790 --> 01:45:33.800 align:start position:0%
out began immediately helping those
 
01:45:36.750 --> 01:45:36.760 align:start position:0%
individuals who receive these this P the
 
01:45:39.910 --> 01:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
protective income limit increase that
 
01:45:42.910 --> 01:45:42.920 align:start position:0%
began working on the rule hit some bumps
 
01:45:44.589 --> 01:45:44.599 align:start position:0%
things got held up and we've just
 
01:45:46.550 --> 01:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
continued to work it and we're here now
 
01:45:49.149 --> 01:45:49.159 align:start position:0%
to have it adopted so it sounds like the
 
01:45:53.629 --> 01:45:53.639 align:start position:0%
rule is an afterthought is that correct
 
01:45:55.310 --> 01:45:55.320 align:start position:0%
or is it the just the last step in a
 
01:45:57.030 --> 01:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
very long it's a last step of a long
 
01:45:58.510 --> 01:45:58.520 align:start position:0%
process that also got tripped up
 
01:46:00.550 --> 01:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
internally with conversations and with
 
01:46:03.189 --> 01:46:03.199 align:start position:0%
LBA uh Rob Barry General counsil to the
 
01:46:05.950 --> 01:46:05.960 align:start position:0%
division of Medicaid DHHS to be clear
 
01:46:07.550 --> 01:46:07.560 align:start position:0%
the the chapter law itself is very
 
01:46:09.390 --> 01:46:09.400 align:start position:0%
prescriptive as to how we were to
 
01:46:13.149 --> 01:46:13.159 align:start position:0%
implement this so um the the rule is
 
01:46:15.629 --> 01:46:15.639 align:start position:0%
really just a recitation of the results
 
01:46:17.270 --> 01:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
of the chapter law but the chapter law
 
01:46:19.910 --> 01:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
really controlled here uh traditionally
 
01:46:21.109 --> 01:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
the legislature has not been so
 
01:46:23.109 --> 01:46:23.119 align:start position:0%
prescriptive as to how to implement the
 
01:46:24.990 --> 01:46:25.000 align:start position:0%
protective income liit limit which is
 
01:46:26.910 --> 01:46:26.920 align:start position:0%
why we've needed rules in the past uh
 
01:46:29.070 --> 01:46:29.080 align:start position:0%
and we'll need rules going forward um
 
01:46:32.910 --> 01:46:32.920 align:start position:0%
but this was just kind of a uh a unique
 
01:46:34.990 --> 01:46:35.000 align:start position:0%
uh piece of legislation uh so we were
 
01:46:37.030 --> 01:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
relying on that Authority and we did
 
01:46:38.550 --> 01:46:38.560 align:start position:0%
feel that it was more important to get
 
01:46:40.870 --> 01:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
the state plan amendment in place which
 
01:46:43.910 --> 01:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
was our federal authority to implement
 
01:46:45.430 --> 01:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
uh as well as inform the field and
 
01:46:47.149 --> 01:46:47.159 align:start position:0%
develop processes so this could be
 
01:46:49.189 --> 01:46:49.199 align:start position:0%
applied so the long and the short of it
 
01:46:54.350 --> 01:46:54.360 align:start position:0%
is um no one was uh harmed by our um
 
01:46:55.910 --> 01:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
deficiency here with getting this rule
 
01:46:57.550 --> 01:46:57.560 align:start position:0%
in place and we do recognize that we
 
01:46:59.270 --> 01:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
were deficient with that and we should
 
01:47:00.709 --> 01:47:00.719 align:start position:0%
have done it a lot sooner than that but
 
01:47:03.990 --> 01:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
I did want to clarify that um what the
 
01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:05.229 align:start position:0%
I did want to clarify that um what the
process

01:47:05.229 --> 01:47:05.239 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:47:07.990 --> 01:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
was all right thank you madam chair
 
01:47:10.669 --> 01:47:10.679 align:start position:0%
other questions yes uh just to clarify
 
01:47:13.229 --> 01:47:13.239 align:start position:0%
the chapter law though it does give the
 
01:47:15.470 --> 01:47:15.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the department uh the
 
01:47:17.030 --> 01:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
authority to amend the income
 
01:47:19.350 --> 01:47:19.360 align:start position:0%
eligibility requirement for in andout
 
01:47:21.350 --> 01:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
medical assistance it gives the
 
01:47:24.470 --> 01:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner two options it says that it
 
01:47:27.070 --> 01:47:27.080 align:start position:0%
can e uh the commissioner can either
 
01:47:27.080 --> 01:47:28.669 align:start position:0%
can e uh the commissioner can either
amend

01:47:28.669 --> 01:47:28.679 align:start position:0%
amend
 
01:47:32.669 --> 01:47:32.679 align:start position:0%
uh less than or equal to
 
01:47:38.310 --> 01:47:38.320 align:start position:0%
133 13% of the section 1931 income limit
 
01:47:41.109 --> 01:47:41.119 align:start position:0%
or using methodology as described in
 
01:47:44.310 --> 01:47:44.320 align:start position:0%
section 1902 R2 of the federal Social
 
01:47:48.390 --> 01:47:48.400 align:start position:0%
Security Act so there was some choice to
 
01:47:49.990 --> 01:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
be made by the department that had to be
 
01:47:52.950 --> 01:47:52.960 align:start position:0%
done via rule
 
01:47:56.149 --> 01:47:56.159 align:start position:0%
we elected the first uh option just for
 
01:47:59.629 --> 01:47:59.639 align:start position:0%
clarity okay thank
 
01:48:03.550 --> 01:48:03.560 align:start position:0%
you questions comments concerns move to
 
01:48:07.229 --> 01:48:07.239 align:start position:0%
approve second second okay move by
 
01:48:09.149 --> 01:48:09.159 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt second by
 
01:48:11.229 --> 01:48:11.239 align:start position:0%
representative L
 
01:48:15.870 --> 01:48:15.880 align:start position:0%
discussion those in favor I
 
01:48:18.669 --> 01:48:18.679 align:start position:0%
opposed thank
 
01:48:24.189 --> 01:48:24.199 align:start position:0%
you okay passenger traway safety rules
 
01:48:27.070 --> 01:48:27.080 align:start position:0%
okay so this is proposal 2024 145
 
01:48:29.550 --> 01:48:29.560 align:start position:0%
various passenger Tramway safety
 
01:48:32.390 --> 01:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
rules there were a couple of unclear
 
01:48:36.149 --> 01:48:36.159 align:start position:0%
comments uh for this proposal the agency
 
01:48:37.910 --> 01:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
did not file a conditional approval
 
01:48:40.990 --> 01:48:41.000 align:start position:0%
request to address those issues the
 
01:48:43.510 --> 01:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
first appears on page one of the rule
 
01:48:46.750 --> 01:48:46.760 align:start position:0%
text it's an edit unclear comment uh due
 
01:48:48.270 --> 01:48:48.280 align:start position:0%
to the citation of the Incorporated
 
01:48:51.189 --> 01:48:51.199 align:start position:0%
material being different than other
 
01:48:53.229 --> 01:48:53.239 align:start position:0%
sections where it's cited as as well as
 
01:48:57.709 --> 01:48:57.719 align:start position:0%
an appendix B uh in that particular spot
 
01:49:05.709 --> 01:49:05.719 align:start position:0%
it is cited as a nsib b 77.1
 
01:49:12.030 --> 01:49:12.040 align:start position:0%
d222 but everywhere else it's an nsib b.
 
01:49:12.040 --> 01:49:13.669 align:start position:0%
d222 but everywhere else it's an nsib b.
77-

01:49:13.669 --> 01:49:13.679 align:start position:0%
77-
 
01:49:17.550 --> 01:49:17.560 align:start position:0%
2022 so it's unclear
 
01:49:20.229 --> 01:49:20.239 align:start position:0%
because it either is an editorial error
 
01:49:22.870 --> 01:49:22.880 align:start position:0%
which can be easily fixed or this is a a
 
01:49:24.629 --> 01:49:24.639 align:start position:0%
different part of the document in which
 
01:49:27.350 --> 01:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
case that needs to be cited specifically
 
01:49:31.470 --> 01:49:31.480 align:start position:0%
in appendix 2 the second comment is on
 
01:49:33.950 --> 01:49:33.960 align:start position:0%
the bottom of page that that sounds like
 
01:49:35.350 --> 01:49:35.360 align:start position:0%
something we'd like to get out of the
 
01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:37.669 align:start position:0%
something we'd like to get out of the
way

01:49:37.669 --> 01:49:37.679 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:49:39.990 --> 01:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
sure hi good morning uh my name is
 
01:49:42.950 --> 01:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
Briggs Lockwood I am the chief uh for
 
01:49:45.030 --> 01:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
the for the Department of Safety of the
 
01:49:48.229 --> 01:49:48.239 align:start position:0%
uh Tramway and amusement ride Bureau so
 
01:49:51.030 --> 01:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
um oh yeah goad good morning my name is
 
01:49:52.910 --> 01:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
Michael duu I'm one of the staff
 
01:49:56.750 --> 01:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:59.390 --> 01:49:59.400 align:start position:0%
Safety so yeah I think it is just an
 
01:50:01.510 --> 01:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
editorial we're talking about the same
 
01:50:04.550 --> 01:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
document um in in all of the places and
 
01:50:06.310 --> 01:50:06.320 align:start position:0%
it looks like it was an oversight and in
 
01:50:08.070 --> 01:50:08.080 align:start position:0%
one place it was uh
 
01:50:12.030 --> 01:50:12.040 align:start position:0%
listed differently all right thank
 
01:50:15.350 --> 01:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
you so so so the
 
01:50:18.109 --> 01:50:18.119 align:start position:0%
uh the statute has been
 
01:50:20.470 --> 01:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
updated I mean not the statute the
 
01:50:24.109 --> 01:50:24.119 align:start position:0%
standard the NC standard has been
 
01:50:26.669 --> 01:50:26.679 align:start position:0%
updated uh this is the latest version of
 
01:50:29.229 --> 01:50:29.239 align:start position:0%
the an standard which we wish to adopt
 
01:50:29.239 --> 01:50:30.830 align:start position:0%
the an standard which we wish to adopt
2022

01:50:30.830 --> 01:50:30.840 align:start position:0%
2022
 
01:50:33.830 --> 01:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
version thank you okay anyone else I'm
 
01:50:39.189 --> 01:50:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:41.830 --> 01:50:41.840 align:start position:0%
version okay so that's
 
01:50:44.910 --> 01:50:44.920 align:start position:0%
2022 so that issue could easily be fixed
 
01:50:47.510 --> 01:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
with an oral conditional approval um but
 
01:50:49.030 --> 01:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
there's still still two other
 
01:50:51.990 --> 01:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
substantive comments but I also just on
 
01:50:54.790 --> 01:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
that issue of the updated Incorporated
 
01:50:55.990 --> 01:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
document I also just want to make the
 
01:50:58.470 --> 01:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
committee aware that the department did
 
01:51:00.629 --> 01:51:00.639 align:start position:0%
submit a summary of the changes which
 
01:51:02.109 --> 01:51:02.119 align:start position:0%
was included in the packet because it
 
01:51:05.149 --> 01:51:05.159 align:start position:0%
looks like there were some pretty uh
 
01:51:07.550 --> 01:51:07.560 align:start position:0%
quite a number of changes um and it
 
01:51:09.709 --> 01:51:09.719 align:start position:0%
looks like that summary comes directly
 
01:51:12.790 --> 01:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
from the organization uh who updated the
 
01:51:16.229 --> 01:51:16.239 align:start position:0%
document that seems highly
 
01:51:18.430 --> 01:51:18.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh the second substantive
 
01:51:20.189 --> 01:51:20.199 align:start position:0%
comment is on the bottom of page two
 
01:51:23.709 --> 01:51:23.719 align:start position:0%
it's a unclear edit comment the notice
 
01:51:25.790 --> 01:51:25.800 align:start position:0%
for this proposal stated that a
 
01:51:28.470 --> 01:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
definition was added to this particular
 
01:51:31.750 --> 01:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
section of the rule however it's unclear
 
01:51:35.270 --> 01:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
what term was being defined as it was
 
01:51:37.750 --> 01:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
not laid out in compliance with the
 
01:51:41.149 --> 01:51:41.159 align:start position:0%
manual and it was not specified so in
 
01:51:42.669 --> 01:51:42.679 align:start position:0%
that particular
 
01:51:46.109 --> 01:51:46.119 align:start position:0%
section it's either new installation or
 
01:51:48.910 --> 01:51:48.920 align:start position:0%
modification I couldn't determine which
 
01:51:51.229 --> 01:51:51.239 align:start position:0%
term was meant to be defined or if both
 
01:51:53.470 --> 01:51:53.480 align:start position:0%
were meant to be defined
 
01:51:56.550 --> 01:51:56.560 align:start position:0%
and then Additionally the setup of that
 
01:51:58.470 --> 01:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
particular rule is not in compliance
 
01:52:01.510 --> 01:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
with the manual as they have language
 
01:52:03.790 --> 01:52:03.800 align:start position:0%
right after the section title but it's
 
01:52:05.550 --> 01:52:05.560 align:start position:0%
not introductory language for the
 
01:52:08.109 --> 01:52:08.119 align:start position:0%
subsequent paragraphs it simply seems to
 
01:52:10.669 --> 01:52:10.679 align:start position:0%
be its own paragraph So that entire
 
01:52:12.510 --> 01:52:12.520 align:start position:0%
section needs to be
 
01:52:14.510 --> 01:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
reconstructed well that sounds like an
 
01:52:14.520 --> 01:52:16.149 align:start position:0%
reconstructed well that sounds like an
editorial

01:52:16.149 --> 01:52:16.159 align:start position:0%
editorial
 
01:52:20.550 --> 01:52:20.560 align:start position:0%
comment but the uh so you have the
 
01:52:23.069 --> 01:52:23.079 align:start position:0%
modific so the modification
 
01:52:25.270 --> 01:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
is the new definition and you're
 
01:52:28.629 --> 01:52:28.639 align:start position:0%
basically redefining it as a new
 
01:52:30.510 --> 01:52:30.520 align:start position:0%
installation I do understand the
 
01:52:34.030 --> 01:52:34.040 align:start position:0%
confusion here really the intent here
 
01:52:35.750 --> 01:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
was to
 
01:52:40.390 --> 01:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
describe um what would occur um
 
01:52:43.589 --> 01:52:43.599 align:start position:0%
involving a new installation if if
 
01:52:44.669 --> 01:52:44.679 align:start position:0%
there's movement if there's an
 
01:52:47.069 --> 01:52:47.079 align:start position:0%
alteration in length or movement of the
 
01:52:48.870 --> 01:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
passenger Tramway and that the end
 
01:52:50.870 --> 01:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
result would consider it a new
 
01:52:54.589 --> 01:52:54.599 align:start position:0%
installation it wasn't the intent was
 
01:52:57.990 --> 01:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
not to Define new installation per
 
01:53:02.709 --> 01:53:02.719 align:start position:0%
se okay so is there a def new definition
 
01:53:03.790 --> 01:53:03.800 align:start position:0%
in this
 
01:53:08.030 --> 01:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
section I I would say no oh
 
01:53:11.149 --> 01:53:11.159 align:start position:0%
okay so that issue if it was just a
 
01:53:12.430 --> 01:53:12.440 align:start position:0%
discrepancy between the notice and the
 
01:53:16.030 --> 01:53:16.040 align:start position:0%
role text is fine um so it'll just the
 
01:53:17.830 --> 01:53:17.840 align:start position:0%
remaining issue would be to restructure
 
01:53:20.149 --> 01:53:20.159 align:start position:0%
that section to be in compliance with
 
01:53:21.910 --> 01:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
the manual by having appropriate
 
01:53:23.629 --> 01:53:23.639 align:start position:0%
introductory language for those sub
 
01:53:23.639 --> 01:53:24.910 align:start position:0%
introductory language for those sub
paragraphs

01:53:24.910 --> 01:53:24.920 align:start position:0%
paragraphs
 
01:53:27.069 --> 01:53:27.079 align:start position:0%
which might take a little more work than
 
01:53:28.990 --> 01:53:29.000 align:start position:0%
a oral conditional approval that we
 
01:53:30.870 --> 01:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
could do right here um and then
 
01:53:32.589 --> 01:53:32.599 align:start position:0%
additionally there is one final comment
 
01:53:34.790 --> 01:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
on the bottom of page three it's an
 
01:53:37.830 --> 01:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
unclear comment uh the rule requires
 
01:53:40.310 --> 01:53:40.320 align:start position:0%
that plans to replace a prime mover
 
01:53:42.629 --> 01:53:42.639 align:start position:0%
motor or plans to change or replace a
 
01:53:44.709 --> 01:53:44.719 align:start position:0%
control system shall be submitted to the
 
01:53:46.669 --> 01:53:46.679 align:start position:0%
department along with the application
 
01:53:46.679 --> 01:53:47.910 align:start position:0%
department along with the application
and

01:53:47.910 --> 01:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:53:49.830 --> 01:53:49.840 align:start position:0%
specifications however the rule then
 
01:53:51.510 --> 01:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
goes on to state that the department
 
01:53:53.430 --> 01:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
shall allow the completion of the
 
01:53:56.430 --> 01:53:56.440 align:start position:0%
modification testing of the submitt if
 
01:53:58.990 --> 01:53:59.000 align:start position:0%
they meet the standards but then the
 
01:54:00.830 --> 01:54:00.840 align:start position:0%
board shall review the application at
 
01:54:02.470 --> 01:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
its next scheduled board meeting and
 
01:54:04.510 --> 01:54:04.520 align:start position:0%
should determine if the modifications
 
01:54:06.310 --> 01:54:06.320 align:start position:0%
conform with the standards so it's
 
01:54:08.750 --> 01:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
unclear who exactly is making the
 
01:54:10.830 --> 01:54:10.840 align:start position:0%
decision of whether they meet the
 
01:54:13.589 --> 01:54:13.599 align:start position:0%
standards and also if it is ultimately
 
01:54:15.709 --> 01:54:15.719 align:start position:0%
the board who makes that determination
 
01:54:18.629 --> 01:54:18.639 align:start position:0%
why the department is allowed to give an
 
01:54:20.790 --> 01:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
initial approval prior to the board's
 
01:54:20.800 --> 01:54:23.189 align:start position:0%
initial approval prior to the board's
decision

01:54:23.189 --> 01:54:23.199 align:start position:0%
decision
 
01:54:25.830 --> 01:54:25.840 align:start position:0%
I have an answer for that
 
01:54:29.669 --> 01:54:29.679 align:start position:0%
um in this day and age where uh the
 
01:54:33.030 --> 01:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
electrical systems the that control the
 
01:54:37.109 --> 01:54:37.119 align:start position:0%
the motive parts of the ski lifts and
 
01:54:40.149 --> 01:54:40.159 align:start position:0%
the control systems that monitor these
 
01:54:44.310 --> 01:54:44.320 align:start position:0%
machines that are mile a mile long these
 
01:54:46.589 --> 01:54:46.599 align:start position:0%
systems are becoming so sophisticated
 
01:54:49.589 --> 01:54:49.599 align:start position:0%
and as I'm sure we all can understand
 
01:54:54.069 --> 01:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
they become obsolete after not very long
 
01:54:58.149 --> 01:54:58.159 align:start position:0%
um a a ski resort may be faced with uh
 
01:54:59.510 --> 01:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
having to
 
01:55:02.830 --> 01:55:02.840 align:start position:0%
replace some of these components which
 
01:55:06.430 --> 01:55:06.440 align:start position:0%
uh by definition it's a modification of
 
01:55:09.310 --> 01:55:09.320 align:start position:0%
the Tramway if it's not exactly the same
 
01:55:09.320 --> 01:55:10.510 align:start position:0%
the Tramway if it's not exactly the same
part

01:55:10.510 --> 01:55:10.520 align:start position:0%
part
 
01:55:14.990 --> 01:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
number and once a some these components
 
01:55:17.149 --> 01:55:17.159 align:start position:0%
become five or six years old the you
 
01:55:19.069 --> 01:55:19.079 align:start position:0%
cannot buy the same part number they're
 
01:55:21.350 --> 01:55:21.360 align:start position:0%
forced into this modification the
 
01:55:23.270 --> 01:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
Trouble Is We would have to convene the
 
01:55:27.550 --> 01:55:27.560 align:start position:0%
Tramway board uh in order to act on this
 
01:55:30.629 --> 01:55:30.639 align:start position:0%
uh under the current situation so what
 
01:55:32.510 --> 01:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
the board agreed to
 
01:55:36.870 --> 01:55:36.880 align:start position:0%
do um in order to expediate this for the
 
01:55:38.790 --> 01:55:38.800 align:start position:0%
businesses that are trying to operate
 
01:55:43.109 --> 01:55:43.119 align:start position:0%
this equipment is to submit the designs
 
01:55:44.990 --> 01:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
um to the department and have us review
 
01:55:46.629 --> 01:55:46.639 align:start position:0%
them and that way they can move forward
 
01:55:49.030 --> 01:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
with the installation and testing and
 
01:55:51.030 --> 01:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
operation and then the board would then
 
01:55:52.910 --> 01:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
review it so the board effectively is
 
01:55:56.550 --> 01:55:56.560 align:start position:0%
agreeing to defer that to us for the
 
01:55:58.830 --> 01:55:58.840 align:start position:0%
temporary period of time until the next
 
01:56:01.430 --> 01:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
their next meeting so
 
01:56:04.750 --> 01:56:04.760 align:start position:0%
the what happens if the board decides
 
01:56:07.390 --> 01:56:07.400 align:start position:0%
that the application is not
 
01:56:10.790 --> 01:56:10.800 align:start position:0%
correct well it says they will identify
 
01:56:13.229 --> 01:56:13.239 align:start position:0%
the area or areas of non-conformance and
 
01:56:15.910 --> 01:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
stipulate a reasonable time frame for
 
01:56:18.750 --> 01:56:18.760 align:start position:0%
conformance okay so
 
01:56:21.669 --> 01:56:21.679 align:start position:0%
the the owner of the lift is that is on
 
01:56:23.870 --> 01:56:23.880 align:start position:0%
the hook for making sure the board has
 
01:56:26.430 --> 01:56:26.440 align:start position:0%
approved their design modifications that
 
01:56:26.440 --> 01:56:27.350 align:start position:0%
approved their design modifications that
is

01:56:27.350 --> 01:56:27.360 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:56:30.069 --> 01:56:30.079 align:start position:0%
correct thank you I thought that was the
 
01:56:34.030 --> 01:56:34.040 align:start position:0%
case any other questions no
 
01:56:36.589 --> 01:56:36.599 align:start position:0%
comments get you got to do it you got to
 
01:56:39.229 --> 01:56:39.239 align:start position:0%
do it kind of as built how to build it
 
01:56:39.239 --> 01:56:40.189 align:start position:0%
do it kind of as built how to build it
to

01:56:40.189 --> 01:56:40.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:56:43.990 --> 01:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
the situation
 
01:56:46.750 --> 01:56:46.760 align:start position:0%
right right and you test it see that it
 
01:56:49.030 --> 01:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
works that is correct yeah we would
 
01:56:52.589 --> 01:56:52.599 align:start position:0%
require uh a a quality qualified
 
01:56:55.350 --> 01:56:55.360 align:start position:0%
engineer to review and stamp the project
 
01:56:57.350 --> 01:56:57.360 align:start position:0%
and that engineer then is responsible
 
01:57:00.430 --> 01:57:00.440 align:start position:0%
for any testing testing would be
 
01:57:02.669 --> 01:57:02.679 align:start position:0%
completed and so it's really the same
 
01:57:04.310 --> 01:57:04.320 align:start position:0%
drill that would happen with the board's
 
01:57:05.709 --> 01:57:05.719 align:start position:0%
approval they're just deferring
 
01:57:09.270 --> 01:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
everything to us so that to so that it
 
01:57:12.589 --> 01:57:12.599 align:start position:0%
can be done okay well there's also that
 
01:57:16.189 --> 01:57:16.199 align:start position:0%
um um Clarity issue that needs a
 
01:57:20.229 --> 01:57:20.239 align:start position:0%
rewrite could we move to um give them a
 
01:57:23.510 --> 01:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
conditional approval and come back
 
01:57:26.629 --> 01:57:26.639 align:start position:0%
in so we could postpone and allow the
 
01:57:29.030 --> 01:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
department to submit a conditional
 
01:57:34.109 --> 01:57:34.119 align:start position:0%
approval um also looking at the
 
01:57:36.990 --> 01:57:37.000 align:start position:0%
rule was the intent to
 
01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:38.550 align:start position:0%
rule was the intent to
have

01:57:38.550 --> 01:57:38.560 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:57:40.870 --> 01:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
that language right after the section
 
01:57:44.030 --> 01:57:44.040 align:start position:0%
title just as its own paragraph and each
 
01:57:45.830 --> 01:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
subsequent paragraph is its own
 
01:57:49.510 --> 01:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
paragraph This is section uh pass
 
01:57:49.520 --> 01:57:52.229 align:start position:0%
paragraph This is section uh pass
35.035683

01:57:52.229 --> 01:57:52.239 align:start position:0%
35.035683
 
01:57:54.669 --> 01:57:54.679 align:start position:0%
the bottom of page two I think we'll
 
01:57:56.310 --> 01:57:56.320 align:start position:0%
still have a because if that's the case
 
01:57:57.750 --> 01:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
then we can do an oral conditional
 
01:58:01.149 --> 01:58:01.159 align:start position:0%
approval to just move that make that
 
01:58:04.030 --> 01:58:04.040 align:start position:0%
paragraph a and relet the remaining
 
01:58:06.030 --> 01:58:06.040 align:start position:0%
paragraphs if they're all Standalone
 
01:58:08.030 --> 01:58:08.040 align:start position:0%
paragraphs and then additionally fix
 
01:58:11.270 --> 01:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
that citation okay we're not opposed to
 
01:58:14.910 --> 01:58:14.920 align:start position:0%
make that change per per what uh the
 
01:58:17.030 --> 01:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
committee would like us to do making it
 
01:58:19.229 --> 01:58:19.239 align:start position:0%
a new paragraph is simple enough that
 
01:58:22.669 --> 01:58:22.679 align:start position:0%
the oral request would would be
 
01:58:27.870 --> 01:58:27.880 align:start position:0%
valid okay so we so we have a motion
 
01:58:31.870 --> 01:58:31.880 align:start position:0%
second and just comments questions wait
 
01:58:33.990 --> 01:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
a minute are we are we seconding my
 
01:58:36.669 --> 01:58:36.679 align:start position:0%
motion my motion was to
 
01:58:39.950 --> 01:58:39.960 align:start position:0%
postpone was not an oral conditional
 
01:58:42.030 --> 01:58:42.040 align:start position:0%
approval should I change my motion would
 
01:58:44.550 --> 01:58:44.560 align:start position:0%
that be like to sure I'll change it to
 
01:58:46.189 --> 01:58:46.199 align:start position:0%
an oral conditional approval I just want
 
01:58:47.470 --> 01:58:47.480 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we have the same
 
01:58:49.350 --> 01:58:49.360 align:start position:0%
motion I will draw my first one and I'll
 
01:58:52.629 --> 01:58:52.639 align:start position:0%
change it to this second all right by
 
01:58:55.470 --> 01:58:55.480 align:start position:0%
motion by representative groda to
 
01:58:57.069 --> 01:58:57.079 align:start position:0%
conditionally approve this with the
 
01:59:01.709 --> 01:59:01.719 align:start position:0%
editorial comments indicated and second
 
01:59:03.990 --> 01:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
by representative
 
01:59:07.750 --> 01:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
Schmid any sorry representative Lenn
 
01:59:07.760 --> 01:59:08.709 align:start position:0%
Schmid any sorry representative Lenn
excuse

01:59:08.709 --> 01:59:08.719 align:start position:0%
excuse
 
01:59:12.830 --> 01:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
me all right any comments questions
 
01:59:16.149 --> 01:59:16.159 align:start position:0%
concerns those in favor
 
01:59:16.159 --> 01:59:17.669 align:start position:0%
concerns those in favor
I

01:59:17.669 --> 01:59:17.679 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:59:20.270 --> 01:59:20.280 align:start position:0%
opposed thank you very much thank you
 
01:59:23.629 --> 01:59:23.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:25.669 --> 01:59:25.679 align:start position:0%
all right representative fellows you're
 
01:59:27.629 --> 01:59:27.639 align:start position:0%
sitting in for representative Schmid
 
01:59:30.750 --> 01:59:30.760 align:start position:0%
since he has another meeting to go to
 
01:59:34.430 --> 01:59:34.440 align:start position:0%
yes I do all right any
 
01:59:34.440 --> 01:59:35.950 align:start position:0%
yes I do all right any
um

01:59:35.950 --> 01:59:35.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:39.310 --> 01:59:39.320 align:start position:0%
and under the Department of Natural and
 
01:59:42.470 --> 01:59:42.480 align:start position:0%
cultural resources we have three
 
01:59:45.550 --> 01:59:45.560 align:start position:0%
administrative rules uh three emergency
 
01:59:48.709 --> 01:59:48.719 align:start position:0%
rules Madam chair yes I I think there is
 
01:59:52.510 --> 01:59:52.520 align:start position:0%
one item before that
 
01:59:55.069 --> 01:59:55.079 align:start position:0%
I'm not on the agenda I have it goes I'm
 
01:59:57.149 --> 01:59:57.159 align:start position:0%
sorry I was straight from the passenger
 
02:00:02.550 --> 02:00:02.560 align:start position:0%
traway safety board to other thank you
 
02:00:05.310 --> 02:00:05.320 align:start position:0%
um we have representatives from the
 
02:00:09.270 --> 02:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
Department here uh my concern with all
 
02:00:10.950 --> 02:00:10.960 align:start position:0%
three of these proposals and I'm going
 
02:00:14.669 --> 02:00:14.679 align:start position:0%
to discuss all of them together is
 
02:00:16.629 --> 02:00:16.639 align:start position:0%
whether or not there's actually imminent
 
02:00:19.430 --> 02:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
Peril to Public Health or safety or
 
02:00:21.390 --> 02:00:21.400 align:start position:0%
substantial fiscal harm to the state or
 
02:00:22.950 --> 02:00:22.960 align:start position:0%
its citizens
 
02:00:26.870 --> 02:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
the attachments to each of the uh um
 
02:00:30.350 --> 02:00:30.360 align:start position:0%
emergency rules which uh go into the
 
02:00:34.950 --> 02:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
details of why uh don't seem to state
 
02:00:37.149 --> 02:00:37.159 align:start position:0%
that there's an imminent Peril or
 
02:00:41.990 --> 02:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
substantial fiscal harm um so this's
 
02:00:44.990 --> 02:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
question there of whether it falls
 
02:00:46.669 --> 02:00:46.679 align:start position:0%
within the definition of an emergency
 
02:00:50.950 --> 02:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
role also I would note that um the
 
02:00:52.990 --> 02:00:53.000 align:start position:0%
department has beened en forcing the
 
02:00:55.910 --> 02:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
rules uh created by
 
02:01:00.950 --> 02:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
dread uh those were were um done in
 
02:01:04.270 --> 02:01:04.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:08.030 --> 02:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
2014 since then as you know dread uh has
 
02:01:09.910 --> 02:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
been split into two one of the
 
02:01:11.790 --> 02:01:11.800 align:start position:0%
Department's natural and cultural
 
02:01:11.800 --> 02:01:13.030 align:start position:0%
Department's natural and cultural
cultural

02:01:13.030 --> 02:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
cultural
 
02:01:17.430 --> 02:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
resources um these rules the rules that
 
02:01:19.750 --> 02:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
they were enforcing from dread expired
 
02:01:22.950 --> 02:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
on March 1st of 24
 
02:01:26.950 --> 02:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
uh so the department had seven years to
 
02:01:30.629 --> 02:01:30.639 align:start position:0%
go through regular ruem or interim ruem
 
02:01:33.990 --> 02:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
to put these into place there's also
 
02:01:36.109 --> 02:01:36.119 align:start position:0%
been enough time since March 1st to
 
02:01:38.750 --> 02:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
adopt either regular rules or interim
 
02:01:38.760 --> 02:01:42.629 align:start position:0%
adopt either regular rules or interim
rules

02:01:42.629 --> 02:01:42.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:46.830 --> 02:01:46.840 align:start position:0%
um so again it the need for these at
 
02:01:48.990 --> 02:01:49.000 align:start position:0%
this moment uh outside of regular
 
02:01:54.390 --> 02:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:56.350 --> 02:01:56.360 align:start position:0%
yes I would agree that the the question
 
02:01:56.360 --> 02:01:57.830 align:start position:0%
yes I would agree that the the question
is

02:01:57.830 --> 02:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:02:01.669 --> 02:02:01.679 align:start position:0%
why why is this an emergency when you've
 
02:02:04.830 --> 02:02:04.840 align:start position:0%
had six months since March
 
02:02:08.870 --> 02:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
to adopt The Dread rules as inur rules
 
02:02:11.470 --> 02:02:11.480 align:start position:0%
which would be a very simple thing to
 
02:02:15.069 --> 02:02:15.079 align:start position:0%
do good morning my name is torine tangal
 
02:02:17.750 --> 02:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
Loi I am with the division of Parks and
 
02:02:20.589 --> 02:02:20.599 align:start position:0%
Recreation as a program specialist and I
 
02:02:22.589 --> 02:02:22.599 align:start position:0%
assist the division and Department with
 
02:02:24.709 --> 02:02:24.719 align:start position:0%
their rules
 
02:02:29.550 --> 02:02:29.560 align:start position:0%
um and we are the division is in the
 
02:02:32.750 --> 02:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
process of updating its rules we've not
 
02:02:36.270 --> 02:02:36.280 align:start position:0%
been able to uh finalize some decisions
 
02:02:38.589 --> 02:02:38.599 align:start position:0%
on the rules uh with the commissioner
 
02:02:40.990 --> 02:02:41.000 align:start position:0%
and director they're still reviewing
 
02:02:43.589 --> 02:02:43.599 align:start position:0%
some of these rules both uh commissioner
 
02:02:46.830 --> 02:02:46.840 align:start position:0%
and director especially are fairly new
 
02:02:49.109 --> 02:02:49.119 align:start position:0%
to the department and division so
 
02:02:51.430 --> 02:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
they're still uh contemplating some of
 
02:02:54.270 --> 02:02:54.280 align:start position:0%
the rule changes that we were wanting to
 
02:02:58.229 --> 02:02:58.239 align:start position:0%
make we submitted administrative rules
 
02:03:04.589 --> 02:03:04.599 align:start position:0%
um and we uh are not particularly
 
02:03:08.589 --> 02:03:08.599 align:start position:0%
uh practiced on rule making and uh we're
 
02:03:11.270 --> 02:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
not aware that interim rule may have
 
02:03:14.790 --> 02:03:14.800 align:start position:0%
been a better uh process to keep these
 
02:03:19.910 --> 02:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
rules in play while we finish regular R
 
02:03:23.030 --> 02:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
making yes cuz that would in fact be the
 
02:03:25.390 --> 02:03:25.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate it's you're specifically
 
02:03:29.750 --> 02:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
allowed to adopt interim rules to
 
02:03:35.430 --> 02:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:38.030 --> 02:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
effective director moral I would note
 
02:03:41.270 --> 02:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
that there are two other issues related
 
02:03:44.189 --> 02:03:44.199 align:start position:0%
to this uh one is
 
02:03:48.069 --> 02:03:48.079 align:start position:0%
that under the rules that have expired
 
02:03:50.990 --> 02:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
there's fee making Authority and well
 
02:03:52.990 --> 02:03:53.000 align:start position:0%
the regular fee for state parks are
 
02:03:54.390 --> 02:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
exempt from
 
02:03:57.549 --> 02:03:57.559 align:start position:0%
541a however administrative fines are
 
02:04:00.910 --> 02:04:00.920 align:start position:0%
not also there's a separate statute uh
 
02:04:03.270 --> 02:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
regarding Hampton Beach for which the
 
02:04:05.030 --> 02:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
department is responsible for the
 
02:04:07.870 --> 02:04:07.880 align:start position:0%
parking uh which includes fees for
 
02:04:12.430 --> 02:04:12.440 align:start position:0%
parking or parking meters and fines for
 
02:04:14.669 --> 02:04:14.679 align:start position:0%
failure to
 
02:04:18.470 --> 02:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
comply additionally
 
02:04:18.480 --> 02:04:20.270 align:start position:0%
comply additionally
um

02:04:20.270 --> 02:04:20.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:23.030 --> 02:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
well I I also want to inform the
 
02:04:24.510 --> 02:04:24.520 align:start position:0%
committee that the
 
02:04:27.669 --> 02:04:27.679 align:start position:0%
department a few years ago adopted
 
02:04:31.629 --> 02:04:31.639 align:start position:0%
natural heritage inventory program rules
 
02:04:34.589 --> 02:04:34.599 align:start position:0%
but no other rules have come forward uh
 
02:04:37.270 --> 02:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
the department has no chapter 100
 
02:04:40.109 --> 02:04:40.119 align:start position:0%
organizational rules or chapter 200
 
02:04:42.270 --> 02:04:42.280 align:start position:0%
practice and procedure
 
02:04:44.870 --> 02:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
rules all right well that's a
 
02:04:48.589 --> 02:04:48.599 align:start position:0%
challenge uh the the question I have is
 
02:04:51.750 --> 02:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
have you been enforcing
 
02:04:53.990 --> 02:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
have you been collecting any fines since
 
02:04:57.830 --> 02:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
March which I imagine this is your busy
 
02:05:00.990 --> 02:05:01.000 align:start position:0%
season yes we have um with regards to
 
02:05:05.790 --> 02:05:05.800 align:start position:0%
the parking um fees to park along the
 
02:05:08.109 --> 02:05:08.119 align:start position:0%
Sea Coast as well as the fines for
 
02:05:10.270 --> 02:05:10.280 align:start position:0%
violations of parking we have been
 
02:05:10.280 --> 02:05:14.310 align:start position:0%
violations of parking we have been
enforcing

02:05:14.310 --> 02:05:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:17.790 --> 02:05:17.800 align:start position:0%
that you realize that that's
 
02:05:27.149 --> 02:05:27.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:30.149 --> 02:05:30.159 align:start position:0%
okay I would note that uh I believe the
 
02:05:32.990 --> 02:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
fines and I'll double check with Kim but
 
02:05:37.069 --> 02:05:37.079 align:start position:0%
I think the $250 fine is set by Statute
 
02:05:39.549 --> 02:05:39.559 align:start position:0%
yeah the statute at um 12
 
02:05:42.310 --> 02:05:42.320 align:start position:0%
a2c caps the fines at
 
02:05:45.310 --> 02:05:45.320 align:start position:0%
$250 but does require the agency to
 
02:05:47.790 --> 02:05:47.800 align:start position:0%
develop a schedule of fines and
 
02:05:50.950 --> 02:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
procedures for those fines right well
 
02:05:54.109 --> 02:05:54.119 align:start position:0%
well if it's set as a
 
02:05:56.750 --> 02:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
maximum I mean I understand most
 
02:05:59.149 --> 02:05:59.159 align:start position:0%
agencies interpret that as the minimum
 
02:06:02.109 --> 02:06:02.119 align:start position:0%
but realistically you could you could be
 
02:06:04.189 --> 02:06:04.199 align:start position:0%
giving out $50 you could choose to give
 
02:06:06.030 --> 02:06:06.040 align:start position:0%
out $50
 
02:06:10.589 --> 02:06:10.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:15.709 --> 02:06:15.719 align:start position:0%
enrolled all right anyone else
 
02:06:18.069 --> 02:06:18.079 align:start position:0%
comments I I have a
 
02:06:20.870 --> 02:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
question so are we saying that there is
 
02:06:23.589 --> 02:06:23.599 align:start position:0%
no Fe schedule in these rules there is a
 
02:06:25.270 --> 02:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
fee schedule in these rules in these
 
02:06:27.669 --> 02:06:27.679 align:start position:0%
rules okay but they their previous
 
02:06:30.350 --> 02:06:30.360 align:start position:0%
Authority expired in March correct I
 
02:06:31.870 --> 02:06:31.880 align:start position:0%
understand so if you got a parking
 
02:06:34.310 --> 02:06:34.320 align:start position:0%
ticket at Hampton beach this summer it
 
02:06:37.189 --> 02:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
was illegal well if you paid for parking
 
02:06:40.109 --> 02:06:40.119 align:start position:0%
at Hampton Beach
 
02:06:44.149 --> 02:06:44.159 align:start position:0%
correct if if I may as well uh clarify
 
02:06:47.910 --> 02:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
something um so the department also has
 
02:06:51.189 --> 02:06:51.199 align:start position:0%
statute that allows it to um set its
 
02:06:51.199 --> 02:06:52.629 align:start position:0%
statute that allows it to um set its
feed

02:06:52.629 --> 02:06:52.639 align:start position:0%
feed
 
02:06:56.669 --> 02:06:56.679 align:start position:0%
and uh present them to the Joint
 
02:06:58.510 --> 02:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
legislative fiscal
 
02:07:02.709 --> 02:07:02.719 align:start position:0%
committee so uh such as our insance fees
 
02:07:05.629 --> 02:07:05.639 align:start position:0%
admission fees um it includes our
 
02:07:09.510 --> 02:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
parking fees and fines that was
 
02:07:12.510 --> 02:07:12.520 align:start position:0%
submitted to fiscal Comm committee and
 
02:07:16.669 --> 02:07:16.679 align:start position:0%
approved so that is those are some of
 
02:07:18.870 --> 02:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
the fines and fees that we are working
 
02:07:18.880 --> 02:07:20.030 align:start position:0%
the fines and fees that we are working
off

02:07:20.030 --> 02:07:20.040 align:start position:0%
off
 
02:07:24.390 --> 02:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
of yeah the iror Marl is is it correct
 
02:07:26.709 --> 02:07:26.719 align:start position:0%
that the fees and fines would have to be
 
02:07:30.830 --> 02:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
approved both by fiscal and by jail car
 
02:07:34.430 --> 02:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
that appears to be uh the fees for state
 
02:07:36.950 --> 02:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
parks uh does have an exemption from
 
02:07:40.390 --> 02:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
541a as I mentioned however the fines
 
02:07:42.430 --> 02:07:42.440 align:start position:0%
for any state
 
02:07:45.229 --> 02:07:45.239 align:start position:0%
park um are through
 
02:07:49.310 --> 02:07:49.320 align:start position:0%
rules although the statute caps it and
 
02:07:53.910 --> 02:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
any fees or fines for Hampton uh Hampton
 
02:07:56.669 --> 02:07:56.679 align:start position:0%
Beach parking uh would need to go
 
02:07:56.679 --> 02:08:02.430 align:start position:0%
Beach parking uh would need to go
through

02:08:02.430 --> 02:08:02.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:05.109 --> 02:08:05.119 align:start position:0%
rules unless there is another statute
 
02:08:09.189 --> 02:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
that I missed which is always
 
02:08:11.830 --> 02:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
possible don't think there were any
 
02:08:16.030 --> 02:08:16.040 align:start position:0%
changes so what are what are our options
 
02:08:17.870 --> 02:08:17.880 align:start position:0%
in this because these are emergency
 
02:08:20.709 --> 02:08:20.719 align:start position:0%
rules uh the committee cannot object if
 
02:08:22.350 --> 02:08:22.360 align:start position:0%
the committee fails that there is no
 
02:08:24.669 --> 02:08:24.679 align:start position:0%
legitimate emergency then it can
 
02:08:27.669 --> 02:08:27.679 align:start position:0%
petition the department to repeal their
 
02:08:30.709 --> 02:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
emergency rules and
 
02:08:33.229 --> 02:08:33.239 align:start position:0%
uh the committee may wish make
 
02:08:36.069 --> 02:08:36.079 align:start position:0%
recommendations about adopting rules uh
 
02:08:37.910 --> 02:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
these rules for regular rule making
 
02:08:41.910 --> 02:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:45.629 --> 02:08:45.639 align:start position:0%
200s does someone wish to make a motion
 
02:08:47.750 --> 02:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
recommendation request that's about all
 
02:08:50.109 --> 02:08:50.119 align:start position:0%
we can do is ask representative Roa does
 
02:08:53.510 --> 02:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
your department have a rules
 
02:08:56.510 --> 02:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
coordinator she just retired like two
 
02:08:56.520 --> 02:08:58.669 align:start position:0%
coordinator she just retired like two
weeks

02:08:58.669 --> 02:08:58.679 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
02:09:01.189 --> 02:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
ago and so I've been assisting her
 
02:09:04.669 --> 02:09:04.679 align:start position:0%
through the years on Division division
 
02:09:08.109 --> 02:09:08.119 align:start position:0%
of Parks and Recreation rules um to my
 
02:09:19.470 --> 02:09:19.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:26.390 --> 02:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:29.470 --> 02:09:29.480 align:start position:0%
so if we
 
02:09:34.310 --> 02:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
don't what they if we take your your um
 
02:09:36.430 --> 02:09:36.440 align:start position:0%
position that or we support your
 
02:09:38.270 --> 02:09:38.280 align:start position:0%
position that these are the emergency
 
02:09:40.149 --> 02:09:40.159 align:start position:0%
rules are not
 
02:09:43.030 --> 02:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
warranted what's the I mean what would
 
02:09:47.270 --> 02:09:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:49.790 --> 02:09:49.800 align:start position:0%
option that we keep
 
02:09:52.669 --> 02:09:52.679 align:start position:0%
things you know
 
02:09:54.669 --> 02:09:54.679 align:start position:0%
the department could undertake interim
 
02:09:56.109 --> 02:09:56.119 align:start position:0%
Ru making
 
02:09:59.510 --> 02:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
immediately uh to put the old rules back
 
02:10:02.950 --> 02:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
into place um even though those were
 
02:10:04.669 --> 02:10:04.679 align:start position:0%
dread rules I think they could still use
 
02:10:07.470 --> 02:10:07.480 align:start position:0%
the interim rule process to put them in
 
02:10:10.870 --> 02:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
as uh rules under this
 
02:10:13.030 --> 02:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
department and that would start with a
 
02:10:14.750 --> 02:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
motion from
 
02:10:17.549 --> 02:10:17.559 align:start position:0%
us uh the committee can make that motion
 
02:10:19.870 --> 02:10:19.880 align:start position:0%
but the department could do that at any
 
02:10:19.880 --> 02:10:22.709 align:start position:0%
but the department could do that at any
time

02:10:22.709 --> 02:10:22.719 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:10:24.189 --> 02:10:24.199 align:start position:0%
all we can do is
 
02:10:27.870 --> 02:10:27.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:32.589 --> 02:10:32.599 align:start position:0%
point we we can strongly request yes yes
 
02:10:34.910 --> 02:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
right all right and I would second in a
 
02:10:37.870 --> 02:10:37.880 align:start position:0%
strong request all right so I'll make a
 
02:10:40.470 --> 02:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
strong request from the committee that
 
02:10:43.350 --> 02:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
the department undertake interim rle
 
02:10:43.360 --> 02:10:44.669 align:start position:0%
the department undertake interim rle
making

02:10:44.669 --> 02:10:44.679 align:start position:0%
making
 
02:10:47.830 --> 02:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
immediately and that when would they be
 
02:10:49.870 --> 02:10:49.880 align:start position:0%
coming back
 
02:10:52.990 --> 02:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
here actually if the emergency rules
 
02:10:55.350 --> 02:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
stay in effect commit committee doesn't
 
02:10:58.030 --> 02:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
petition them or the committee petitions
 
02:11:00.270 --> 02:11:00.280 align:start position:0%
them and they deny the petition then
 
02:11:02.069 --> 02:11:02.079 align:start position:0%
those rules are in effect for six months
 
02:11:05.950 --> 02:11:05.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:09.149 --> 02:11:09.159 align:start position:0%
making which I understand that you are
 
02:11:11.030 --> 02:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
in the middle of regular rul making on
 
02:11:16.430 --> 02:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:20.549 --> 02:11:20.559 align:start position:0%
are okay and we would I think that
 
02:11:24.229 --> 02:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
perhaps we should say that they should
 
02:11:27.390 --> 02:11:27.400 align:start position:0%
continue the regular rul making on these
 
02:11:30.790 --> 02:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
and they should adopt as interim rules
 
02:11:33.750 --> 02:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
all the procedural rules from dread that
 
02:11:36.790 --> 02:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
they are undoubtedly following but don't
 
02:11:38.990 --> 02:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
have in in
 
02:11:45.149 --> 02:11:45.159 align:start position:0%
effect that yes yes so moved all right
 
02:11:49.030 --> 02:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
second by representative grassy yeah you
 
02:11:52.270 --> 02:11:52.280 align:start position:0%
should adopt as interim rules rules all
 
02:11:55.589 --> 02:11:55.599 align:start position:0%
the rest of the dread rules that you
 
02:11:55.599 --> 02:11:56.669 align:start position:0%
the rest of the dread rules that you
should

02:11:56.669 --> 02:11:56.679 align:start position:0%
should
 
02:11:59.990 --> 02:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
have for your
 
02:12:02.310 --> 02:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
operations as well as continuing the
 
02:12:04.390 --> 02:12:04.400 align:start position:0%
regular rul making for these
 
02:12:07.950 --> 02:12:07.960 align:start position:0%
rules thank you repres um thank you
 
02:12:12.149 --> 02:12:12.159 align:start position:0%
madam chair um Mr moral in order for um
 
02:12:13.270 --> 02:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm trying to understand the
 
02:12:14.950 --> 02:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
process regarding the emergency rules
 
02:12:16.870 --> 02:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
and us not seeing them as reasonable did
 
02:12:18.510 --> 02:12:18.520 align:start position:0%
you say that we would petition to say
 
02:12:20.669 --> 02:12:20.679 align:start position:0%
that the emergency rules are not valid
 
02:12:22.750 --> 02:12:22.760 align:start position:0%
what would be that process to then move
 
02:12:24.549 --> 02:12:24.559 align:start position:0%
this to the inter rules and the regular
 
02:12:26.229 --> 02:12:26.239 align:start position:0%
Ru making if the committee feels that
 
02:12:28.990 --> 02:12:29.000 align:start position:0%
there is not a legitimate emergency uh
 
02:12:31.229 --> 02:12:31.239 align:start position:0%
it's only option is to petition the
 
02:12:34.589 --> 02:12:34.599 align:start position:0%
agency to repeal those rules the agency
 
02:12:38.790 --> 02:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
has to respond uh within 30 days by
 
02:12:41.430 --> 02:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
letter and I would make I think it would
 
02:12:42.790 --> 02:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
probably make sense to make that motion
 
02:12:44.589 --> 02:12:44.599 align:start position:0%
so I'd make that
 
02:12:48.069 --> 02:12:48.079 align:start position:0%
motion I'll second
 
02:12:51.270 --> 02:12:51.280 align:start position:0%
it okay
 
02:12:55.750 --> 02:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
can I just representative L said I I I I
 
02:12:58.390 --> 02:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
understand the the sentiment behind the
 
02:13:00.709 --> 02:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
motion and the and the response but I
 
02:13:04.669 --> 02:13:04.679 align:start position:0%
just kind of I mean it it it seems like
 
02:13:06.390 --> 02:13:06.400 align:start position:0%
it's not only with this agency but what
 
02:13:10.069 --> 02:13:10.079 align:start position:0%
we've heard today that there is sort of
 
02:13:15.149 --> 02:13:15.159 align:start position:0%
generally a problem um with with having
 
02:13:17.270 --> 02:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
rules kept up on time and my only
 
02:13:20.589 --> 02:13:20.599 align:start position:0%
concern here is that if we file this
 
02:13:23.549 --> 02:13:23.559 align:start position:0%
thing uh if we F if we make this motion
 
02:13:24.549 --> 02:13:24.559 align:start position:0%
that is
 
02:13:26.910 --> 02:13:26.920 align:start position:0%
suggested what the that what that's
 
02:13:28.629 --> 02:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
going to mean is that the department is
 
02:13:30.310 --> 02:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
now going to have to devote time to
 
02:13:32.990 --> 02:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
responding to that and presumably which
 
02:13:35.310 --> 02:13:35.320 align:start position:0%
will take away from their time from from
 
02:13:38.549 --> 02:13:38.559 align:start position:0%
actually working on on the rules and so
 
02:13:42.069 --> 02:13:42.079 align:start position:0%
I wonder if you know is it are we sort
 
02:13:44.669 --> 02:13:44.679 align:start position:0%
of biting off our our head to spite our
 
02:13:47.270 --> 02:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
hand that's my only concern about Madam
 
02:13:49.910 --> 02:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
chair Senator I see what you're saying
 
02:13:51.709 --> 02:13:51.719 align:start position:0%
we want them to focus but actually don't
 
02:13:53.510 --> 02:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
have to have to respond they could just
 
02:13:55.109 --> 02:13:55.119 align:start position:0%
accept that and just move forward on the
 
02:13:57.310 --> 02:13:57.320 align:start position:0%
interim rules I you know I understand
 
02:14:00.430 --> 02:14:00.440 align:start position:0%
sort of the dilemma here and also we
 
02:14:03.709 --> 02:14:03.719 align:start position:0%
have a very clear sort of legislative
 
02:14:06.790 --> 02:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
prescription about when emergency rules
 
02:14:08.910 --> 02:14:08.920 align:start position:0%
are appropriate so I think it's more
 
02:14:11.109 --> 02:14:11.119 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh for them to move into
 
02:14:15.629 --> 02:14:15.639 align:start position:0%
interm rule making yes and and I'm kind
 
02:14:17.709 --> 02:14:17.719 align:start position:0%
of amazed that in seven
 
02:14:20.750 --> 02:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
years the department has not moved on
 
02:14:25.549 --> 02:14:25.559 align:start position:0%
any rule making except one narrow
 
02:14:32.790 --> 02:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:35.310 --> 02:14:35.320 align:start position:0%
concern I just have a question yes
 
02:14:38.109 --> 02:14:38.119 align:start position:0%
clarifying I thought there were I don't
 
02:14:39.750 --> 02:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
believe there are two motions on the
 
02:14:42.189 --> 02:14:42.199 align:start position:0%
table right now but perhaps there are or
 
02:14:46.990 --> 02:14:47.000 align:start position:0%
can I just be the mo representative broa
 
02:14:49.669 --> 02:14:49.679 align:start position:0%
made a motion and we are discussing it
 
02:14:51.870 --> 02:14:51.880 align:start position:0%
okay but I thought representa Leon also
 
02:14:53.430 --> 02:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
made a motion she said she wanted to
 
02:14:56.270 --> 02:14:56.280 align:start position:0%
make a motion okay got it thank you
 
02:14:57.830 --> 02:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:15:00.990 --> 02:15:01.000 align:start position:0%
and so if you could represent BR if you
 
02:15:03.270 --> 02:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
could restate the motion that we're
 
02:15:05.750 --> 02:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
we're discussing or trying to all right
 
02:15:07.109 --> 02:15:07.119 align:start position:0%
so I'm gonna I'm going to try to
 
02:15:10.589 --> 02:15:10.599 align:start position:0%
remember theemotion is that the that we
 
02:15:13.669 --> 02:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
strongly recommend to the request we
 
02:15:15.750 --> 02:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
strongly request that the
 
02:15:19.669 --> 02:15:19.679 align:start position:0%
department um continue its Ru making
 
02:15:22.189 --> 02:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
process but
 
02:15:25.910 --> 02:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
start the interim rule making process
 
02:15:28.950 --> 02:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
for those rules that are not in the
 
02:15:28.960 --> 02:15:30.109 align:start position:0%
for those rules that are not in the
making

02:15:30.109 --> 02:15:30.119 align:start position:0%
making
 
02:15:34.510 --> 02:15:34.520 align:start position:0%
process and that um was there third part
 
02:15:34.520 --> 02:15:35.270 align:start position:0%
process and that um was there third part
of

02:15:35.270 --> 02:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:15:39.149 --> 02:15:39.159 align:start position:0%
this was that it well the third part is
 
02:15:41.669 --> 02:15:41.679 align:start position:0%
what what kind of fines did they collect
 
02:15:43.750 --> 02:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
over oh that's right and what kind of to
 
02:15:46.990 --> 02:15:47.000 align:start position:0%
report to us what kind of fins
 
02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:49.310 align:start position:0%
report to us what kind of fins
and

02:15:49.310 --> 02:15:49.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:15:54.350 --> 02:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
unauthorized income was collected by the
 
02:15:58.109 --> 02:15:58.119 align:start position:0%
department IT director moral I'm
 
02:16:01.149 --> 02:16:01.159 align:start position:0%
somewhat concerned about uh asking them
 
02:16:04.030 --> 02:16:04.040 align:start position:0%
to go through interim rul making for
 
02:16:06.350 --> 02:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
other rules such as the 100 and 200
 
02:16:09.629 --> 02:16:09.639 align:start position:0%
rules the reason being an interim rule
 
02:16:12.350 --> 02:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
like that to bring back expired rules
 
02:16:14.510 --> 02:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
the rules have to be the exact same
 
02:16:18.069 --> 02:16:18.079 align:start position:0%
language uh organizational rules
 
02:16:20.629 --> 02:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
describe the organization describe the
 
02:16:23.510 --> 02:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
AG agency a description of dread would
 
02:16:27.510 --> 02:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
not be the same as this department U so
 
02:16:29.470 --> 02:16:29.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not as I say I'm not sure that it
 
02:16:31.870 --> 02:16:31.880 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate I can go and look
 
02:16:34.910 --> 02:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
at the 100 rules and the 200 rules and
 
02:16:37.349 --> 02:16:37.359 align:start position:0%
talk with the agency about it and report
 
02:16:41.429 --> 02:16:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:43.870 --> 02:16:43.880 align:start position:0%
committee just to clarify they're not
 
02:16:46.429 --> 02:16:46.439 align:start position:0%
currently in formal rule making I looked
 
02:16:48.709 --> 02:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
up on our database and there there is no
 
02:16:51.230 --> 02:16:51.240 align:start position:0%
current rule making taking place so if
 
02:16:52.669 --> 02:16:52.679 align:start position:0%
they're doing any that might be
 
02:16:56.389 --> 02:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:00.870 --> 02:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
agency okay do you wish to amend your
 
02:17:03.070 --> 02:17:03.080 align:start position:0%
I'll amend my motion
 
02:17:07.629 --> 02:17:07.639 align:start position:0%
um we strongly recommend that the
 
02:17:11.429 --> 02:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
department takes on interim Ru
 
02:17:13.509 --> 02:17:13.519 align:start position:0%
making so
 
02:17:17.910 --> 02:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
that you have the authority that you
 
02:17:22.389 --> 02:17:22.399 align:start position:0%
need and that you
 
02:17:26.750 --> 02:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
include in that the
 
02:17:30.389 --> 02:17:30.399 align:start position:0%
specific Authority that you have in
 
02:17:32.910 --> 02:17:32.920 align:start position:0%
collecting fines and issuing fees which
 
02:17:37.910 --> 02:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
are in your emergency rules which we're
 
02:17:39.870 --> 02:17:39.880 align:start position:0%
not going
 
02:17:43.549 --> 02:17:43.559 align:start position:0%
to obviously approve we we don't have to
 
02:17:43.559 --> 02:17:47.629 align:start position:0%
to obviously approve we we don't have to
approve

02:17:47.629 --> 02:17:47.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:51.950 --> 02:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
right everybody clear
 
02:17:53.950 --> 02:17:53.960 align:start position:0%
Madam chair yes I just think it'd be
 
02:17:56.110 --> 02:17:56.120 align:start position:0%
important for jel car to to ask the
 
02:17:58.150 --> 02:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
department to
 
02:18:01.950 --> 02:18:01.960 align:start position:0%
um take an internal assessment of its uh
 
02:18:04.750 --> 02:18:04.760 align:start position:0%
rule making and rules on hand to
 
02:18:07.190 --> 02:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
determine if they need to initiate other
 
02:18:10.830 --> 02:18:10.840 align:start position:0%
rules as well it sounds like this one uh
 
02:18:12.870 --> 02:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
flipped through the slep through the
 
02:18:15.830 --> 02:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
cracks so um it might be worth a second
 
02:18:17.150 --> 02:18:17.160 align:start position:0%
look to make sure that there are not
 
02:18:17.160 --> 02:18:18.389 align:start position:0%
look to make sure that there are not
other

02:18:18.389 --> 02:18:18.399 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:18:21.950 --> 02:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
concerns I can add that to my motion
 
02:18:23.709 --> 02:18:23.719 align:start position:0%

02:18:27.349 --> 02:18:27.359 align:start position:0%

02:18:35.110 --> 02:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
using the interim process if it's going
 
02:18:37.950 --> 02:18:37.960 align:start position:0%
to be used the motion doesn't mention
 
02:18:41.190 --> 02:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
interim it just says that they continue
 
02:18:45.830 --> 02:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
their their Ru making and that
 
02:18:50.190 --> 02:18:50.200 align:start position:0%
they assess their rules or the previous
 
02:18:52.589 --> 02:18:52.599 align:start position:0%
Department rules to see what rules they
 
02:18:52.599 --> 02:18:54.469 align:start position:0%
Department rules to see what rules they

02:19:11.870 --> 02:19:11.880 align:start position:0%

02:19:32.110 --> 02:19:32.120 align:start position:0%

02:19:53.070 --> 02:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
much then Madam chair yes um did we want
 
02:19:54.950 --> 02:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
to look at petitioning the emergency
 
02:19:56.830 --> 02:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
rules because without that petition they
 
02:19:59.510 --> 02:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
would go into effect or is it is it have
 
02:20:01.110 --> 02:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
we already made that statement they have
 
02:20:03.070 --> 02:20:03.080 align:start position:0%
gone into effect Okay so we've already
 
02:20:04.389 --> 02:20:04.399 align:start position:0%
made the statement that we're very
 
02:20:05.950 --> 02:20:05.960 align:start position:0%
displeased that they did not take the
 
02:20:08.830 --> 02:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
right path but we won't further burden
 
02:20:11.950 --> 02:20:11.960 align:start position:0%
the department right okay thank
 
02:20:11.960 --> 02:20:13.830 align:start position:0%
the department right okay thank
you

02:20:13.830 --> 02:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:20:16.590 --> 02:20:16.600 align:start position:0%
we when we get the strongly worded
 
02:20:18.910 --> 02:20:18.920 align:start position:0%
letter from the staff we will distribute
 
02:20:23.270 --> 02:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:23.280 --> 02:20:24.950 align:start position:0%
 
all

02:20:24.950 --> 02:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
all
 
02:20:28.230 --> 02:20:28.240 align:start position:0%
right the last discussion item is the
 
02:20:30.190 --> 02:20:30.200 align:start position:0%
letter from the Dr about the
 
02:20:30.200 --> 02:20:31.870 align:start position:0%
letter from the Dr about the
equalization

02:20:31.870 --> 02:20:31.880 align:start position:0%
equalization
 
02:20:35.110 --> 02:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
manual um I read the letter and it
 
02:20:39.469 --> 02:20:39.479 align:start position:0%
sounds like the agency was graveling
 
02:20:42.630 --> 02:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
sufficiently um they basically said that
 
02:20:44.270 --> 02:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
the people
 
02:20:47.590 --> 02:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
that identified the equalization manual
 
02:20:52.190 --> 02:20:52.200 align:start position:0%
as guidance and not a rule we wrong
 
02:20:52.200 --> 02:20:53.429 align:start position:0%
as guidance and not a rule we wrong
and

02:20:53.429 --> 02:20:53.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:20:53.439 --> 02:20:55.510 align:start position:0%
and
that

02:20:55.510 --> 02:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:20:58.870 --> 02:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
the and they will be be
 
02:21:02.309 --> 02:21:02.319 align:start position:0%
corrected uh the only concern I have
 
02:21:05.910 --> 02:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
left is that the equalization manual is
 
02:21:08.670 --> 02:21:08.680 align:start position:0%
adopted as a rule but some parts of it
 
02:21:12.630 --> 02:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
are in fact guidance or suggestions
 
02:21:16.790 --> 02:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
rather than actual rules so but that's
 
02:21:20.190 --> 02:21:20.200 align:start position:0%
something that the Dr has to has to deal
 
02:21:22.870 --> 02:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
with we've approved the equalization
 
02:21:25.950 --> 02:21:25.960 align:start position:0%
manual as a
 
02:21:28.550 --> 02:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
document and did anyone else read it or
 
02:21:31.790 --> 02:21:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:36.630 --> 02:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
it apparently not director moral I just
 
02:21:40.309 --> 02:21:40.319 align:start position:0%

02:21:42.710 --> 02:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
committee meetings October and November
 
02:21:44.550 --> 02:21:44.560 align:start position:0%
there will be two directors of
 
02:21:46.790 --> 02:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
administrative roles here as some of you
 
02:21:49.550 --> 02:21:49.560 align:start position:0%

oplc
 
02:22:09.830 --> 02:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
