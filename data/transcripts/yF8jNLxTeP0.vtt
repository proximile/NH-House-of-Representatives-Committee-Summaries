public schools from offering shelter

those schools that do the stated purpose
 
00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:11.080 align:start position:0%
of this legislation is to ensure that
 
00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
our students are kept safe and will not
 
00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:16.120 align:start position:0%
be subjected to remote learning in the

future however there is no exception
 
00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:23.000 align:start position:0%
that schools May provide shelter in

attempts to solve a problem in our state

undocumented people who need Emergency
 
00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:14.480 align:start position:0%
Shelters according to the New

Hampshire's Department of Health and
 
00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
Human Services this legislation could be
 
00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
in direct conflict with current federal
 
00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:25.240 align:start position:0%
guidance on providing shelter as well as
 
00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:26.960 align:start position:0%

obligations
 
00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:32.200 align:start position:0%
the department could potentially lose 12
 
00:31:36.549 --> 00:31:36.559 align:start position:0%
to18 million of federal funds per year
 
00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
from the office of refugee resettlement
 
00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
and the Department of Housing and Urban
 
00:31:45.549 --> 00:31:45.559 align:start position:0%
Development the governor has warned that
 
00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:48.200 align:start position:0%
revenues are down and we expect no
 
00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:51.320 align:start position:0%
budget surplus to make up the difference
 
00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
this loss of federal dollars could lead
 
00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
to additional tax increases on our local
 
00:31:59.190 --> 00:31:59.200 align:start position:0%
communities to to compensate for the
 
00:32:01.029 --> 00:32:01.039 align:start position:0%
loss of federal
 
00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
revenue finally this bill promotes
 
00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:08.240 align:start position:0%
divisiveness perpetuating a national
 
00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
narrative that all people without
 
00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
documentation are dangerous and
 
00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
diseased it will send a chill to
 
00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:19.880 align:start position:0%
Immigrant and refugees families living
 
00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:23.320 align:start position:0%
in our state and discourage people of
 
00:32:26.149 --> 00:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
other nationalities and races from
 
00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:29.440 align:start position:0%

00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
undocumented HB 71 does nothing to
 
00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:41.080 align:start position:0%
improve students safety or education and
 
00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:43.320 align:start position:0%
will jeopardize millions of dollars that
 
00:32:46.149 --> 00:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
contribute to our state revenues I urge
 
00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
you to vote no on the motion of OTP so
 
00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
that a new motion may be made and Mr
 
00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:55.960 align:start position:0%
Speaker I ask for a division
 
00:32:59.750 --> 00:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
vote J recognize Harvey
 
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
bolia thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
00:33:05.909 --> 00:33:05.919 align:start position:0%
passing this bill will ensure that our
 
00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
schools remain dedicated to their
 
00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:10.360 align:start position:0%
primary purpose providing a safe and
 
00:33:13.269 --> 00:33:13.279 align:start position:0%
focused environment for our children's
 
00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:16.600 align:start position:0%
education how the bill prioritizes the
 
00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:19.360 align:start position:0%
use of school for Education rather than
 
00:33:22.389 --> 00:33:22.399 align:start position:0%
for shelters for other populations here
 
00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:24.200 align:start position:0%
are three things driving this
 
00:33:26.629 --> 00:33:26.639 align:start position:0%
legislation the debilitating school
 
00:33:29.029 --> 00:33:29.039 align:start position:0%
closures from the cover years our
 
00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
closeness to Boston and the use of the
 
00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
Logan airport for 6 months as a migrant
 
00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:38.720 align:start position:0%
shelter and the use of a Brooklyn school
 
00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
for the same our students and parents
 
00:33:44.789 --> 00:33:44.799 align:start position:0%
deserve a learning environment free of
 
00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:47.000 align:start position:0%
interruptions last this bill has carve
 
00:33:49.789 --> 00:33:49.799 align:start position:0%
outs for emergency situations and it
 
00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any effect on our revenues
 
00:33:55.870 --> 00:33:55.880 align:start position:0%

00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:23.880 align:start position:0%
Banning the use of public schools and
 
00:35:26.349 --> 00:35:26.359 align:start position:0%
higher education institutions from being
 
00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:29.640 align:start position:0%
used to shelter under documented persons
 
00:35:31.349 --> 00:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
even when the buildings are empty for
 
00:35:34.270 --> 00:35:34.280 align:start position:0%
extended periods of time demonstrates a
 
00:35:36.069 --> 00:35:36.079 align:start position:0%
lack of basic
 
00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:39.720 align:start position:0%
humanity and furthermore if I know that
 
00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
hp71 interferes with local government's
 
00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:45.160 align:start position:0%
ability to effectively govern and make
 
00:35:47.829 --> 00:35:47.839 align:start position:0%
decisions about their own buildings and
 
00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:50.200 align:start position:0%
finally if I know that it is estimated
 
00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
that this legislation would result in
 
00:35:55.309 --> 00:35:55.319 align:start position:0%
loss of 12 to18 million a year in
 
00:35:58.390 --> 00:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
federal funding resulting in a downshift
 
00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
downshift to local taxpayers but now now

teachers and support staff safe while
 
00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:23.640 align:start position:0%
they are in our public schools and if I
 
00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:25.640 align:start position:0%
further note that many unvetted
 
00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
individuals have been allowed to cross
 
00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
our orders over the past 3 years I would

SE thank you Mr Speaker and good morning
 
00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:55.720 align:start position:0%
there are a number of reasons why HB 129
 
00:38:57.470 --> 00:38:57.480 align:start position:0%
poses significant problems and has made
 
00:39:00.829 --> 00:39:00.839 align:start position:0%
major gaps the bill says all methods of
 
00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:03.160 align:start position:0%
delivering public education shall be
 
00:39:06.109 --> 00:39:06.119 align:start position:0%
evidence-based this is unworkably Broad
 
00:39:07.829 --> 00:39:07.839 align:start position:0%
when I was teaching I did my best to
 
00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
meet the needs of all of my students I
 
00:39:11.589 --> 00:39:11.599 align:start position:0%
tried all sorts of methods to keep them
 
00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
engaged and learning sometimes pivoting
 
00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
in the moment based on what was
 
00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:17.640 align:start position:0%
happening in the class and learning for
 
00:39:20.069 --> 00:39:20.079 align:start position:0%
myself what was working and what wasn't
 
00:39:21.870 --> 00:39:21.880 align:start position:0%
on top of the prep work teachers are
 
00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
already doing this bill would apparently
 
00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:25.880 align:start position:0%
require them to do additional research
 
00:39:27.589 --> 00:39:27.599 align:start position:0%
to find reproducible studies that have
 
00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
been uh already completed to validate
 
00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:32.920 align:start position:0%
these methods certified Educators
 
00:39:35.349 --> 00:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
already attend teacher training programs
 
00:39:37.829 --> 00:39:37.839 align:start position:0%
and teach and take continuing education
 
00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
classes throughout their careers to
 
00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
learn new and developing methods this
 
00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
bill does not support that growth
 
00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
additionally this bill further erodes
 
00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
local control and creates a situation of
 
00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
micromanagement of public school
 
00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:54.040 align:start position:0%
teachers by the legislature while not
 
00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
requiring any evaluation or criteria for
 
00:39:58.069 --> 00:39:58.079 align:start position:0%
any private or Charter
 
00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
schools finally and probably most
 
00:40:02.829 --> 00:40:02.839 align:start position:0%
significantly in addition to the points
 
00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
made in this week's calendar I would
 
00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:06.520 align:start position:0%
like to point out that it is estimated
 
00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
this bill would cost an additional
 
00:40:12.589 --> 00:40:12.599 align:start position:0%
$118,000 in fiscal year
 
00:40:16.270 --> 00:40:16.280 align:start position:0%
2026 increasing to
 
00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
$127,000 in fiscal year 2028 for an
 
00:40:21.069 --> 00:40:21.079 align:start position:0%
additional position within the
 
00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:23.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Education it is also
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
estimated that the bill will increase
 
00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
cost to local school districts to review
 
00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
current procedures and implement the
 
00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
requirements of this bill in a year
 
00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:33.640 align:start position:0%
where we've already been told to expect
 
00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:36.200 align:start position:0%
major Financial cuts to program
 
00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
Statewide why would we choose to support
 
00:40:40.910 --> 00:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
a bill that creates additional unfunded
 
00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
mandates while creating more challenges
 
00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:45.640 align:start position:0%
for our classroom teachers I urge you to
 
00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
vote no on OTP so another motion could
 
00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
be made and Mr Speaker I request a
 
00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:53.190 align:start position:0%
be made and Mr Speaker I request a
division

00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:00.349 --> 00:41:00.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:01.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker
 
00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
evidence-based is used to describe
 
00:41:08.069 --> 00:41:08.079 align:start position:0%

00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:10.160 align:start position:0%

term evidence-based in public
 
00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:19.400 align:start position:0%
education evidence-based in education
 
00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
means teaching methods or techniques
 
00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:24.680 align:start position:0%
that are reproducible in multiple
 
00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:28.000 align:start position:0%

00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
confirmed any use of this term and
 
00:41:33.589 --> 00:41:33.599 align:start position:0%
Communications by the department of Ed
 
00:41:36.510 --> 00:41:36.520 align:start position:0%
or local school districts has to conform
 
00:41:37.829 --> 00:41:37.839 align:start position:0%
to this
 
00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
definition this bill is about teaching
 
00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
techniques not subject material it's
 
00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
about how things are taught not what is
 
00:41:50.829 --> 00:41:50.839 align:start position:0%
taught it's about material that is scien
 
00:41:54.349 --> 00:41:54.359 align:start position:0%
driven not socially determined it's
 
00:41:58.190 --> 00:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
about objective data not subjective data
 
00:41:59.750 --> 00:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
or subjective
 
00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
surveys it's about it's adopted at the
 
00:42:06.309 --> 00:42:06.319 align:start position:0%
department or Schoolboard level not at
 
00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
the classroom teacher level this bill
 
00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
only applies to institutions like the
 
00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Education or the local
 
00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
school districts when they are adopting
 
00:42:19.069 --> 00:42:19.079 align:start position:0%
teaching methods it doesn't dictate what
 
00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
specific teaching methods are adopted
 
00:42:24.349 --> 00:42:24.359 align:start position:0%
but only requires that consideration be
 
00:42:26.589 --> 00:42:26.599 align:start position:0%
limited to those methods that have
 
00:42:26.599 --> 00:42:27.710 align:start position:0%
limited to those methods that have
demonstrated

00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:27.720 align:start position:0%
demonstrated
 
00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:30.760 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness in studies this
 
00:42:33.309 --> 00:42:33.319 align:start position:0%
requirement does not apply to curriculum
 
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
nor does it place any burden on
 
00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
classroom teachers who are purposely
 
00:42:41.309 --> 00:42:41.319 align:start position:0%
Exempted and given a free
 
00:42:45.589 --> 00:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
hand evidence-based is a powerful phrase
 
00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
let's make sure that we understand what
 
00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:50.200 align:start position:0%
it means and what we are saying when we
 
00:42:54.549 --> 00:42:54.559 align:start position:0%
use it I ask you to support House Bill

00:43:58.030 --> 00:43:58.040 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
00:44:00.990 --> 00:44:01.000 align:start position:0%
that house bill 129 takes away the
 
00:44:03.549 --> 00:44:03.559 align:start position:0%
flexibility of an educator in their
 
00:44:05.829 --> 00:44:05.839 align:start position:0%
classroom and does limit the
 
00:44:08.309 --> 00:44:08.319 align:start position:0%
instructional choices that are needed to
 
00:44:10.829 --> 00:44:10.839 align:start position:0%
meet the diverse needs of students in a
 
00:44:13.349 --> 00:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
classroom and if I know that this bill
 
00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
takes away our cherished local control
 
00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
and if I know that this unfunded mandate
 
00:44:21.549 --> 00:44:21.559 align:start position:0%
downshifts even more costs to local
 
00:44:24.349 --> 00:44:24.359 align:start position:0%
taxpayers who are already paying large
 
00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
property taxes would I now push the red
 
00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:31.040 align:start position:0%

G thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
know that evidence-based in education
 
00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:48.280 align:start position:0%
means teaching methods or techniques
 
00:44:50.430 --> 00:44:50.440 align:start position:0%
that are reproducible in multiple
 
00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:53.680 align:start position:0%

will be assisted and students
 
00:45:04.109 --> 00:45:04.119 align:start position:0%
benefit from utilizing these methods and
 
00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
techniques that have proven to be the
 
00:45:10.349 --> 00:45:10.359 align:start position:0%
current gold standard in the field of
 
00:45:13.390 --> 00:45:13.400 align:start position:0%
education and if I know that we want New
 
00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:15.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to be not only first in the
 
00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:19.280 align:start position:0%

Mirad Pi speech speech thank
 
00:49:11.589 --> 00:49:11.599 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much Mr Speaker
 
00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
um this bill uh would uh expand the
 
00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
definition of what counts as
 
00:49:22.069 --> 00:49:22.079 align:start position:0%
electioneering to include actions done
 
00:49:24.309 --> 00:49:24.319 align:start position:0%
by public employees on the
 
00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:27.200 align:start position:0%
job that unintentionally
 
00:49:29.430 --> 00:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
have the effect of
 
00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
influencing the way voters vote on
 
00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
candidates or
 
00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:39.720 align:start position:0%
measures and uh and and my concern is
 
00:49:42.510 --> 00:49:42.520 align:start position:0%
that that idea of of including actions
 
00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:45.480 align:start position:0%
that unintentionally influence voters is
 
00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
over Brad and that there are a number of
 
00:49:50.430 --> 00:49:50.440 align:start position:0%
things that public employees do in the
 
00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
ordinary course of their jobs that might
 
00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:56.240 align:start position:0%
have the effect of influencing the way
 
00:50:00.270 --> 00:50:00.280 align:start position:0%
voters vote even though those public
 
00:50:03.109 --> 00:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
employees don't intend what they do to
 
00:50:04.589 --> 00:50:04.599 align:start position:0%
have that effect for instance a Public
 
00:50:07.069 --> 00:50:07.079 align:start position:0%
Employee might share with the public
 
00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
information about the condition of roads
 
00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
and bridges in New Hampshire and a
 
00:50:13.549 --> 00:50:13.559 align:start position:0%
member of the public learning about the
 
00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:15.240 align:start position:0%
condition of roads and bridges might use
 
00:50:17.910 --> 00:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
that information to influence the way
 
00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
they vote the Public Employee can't
 
00:50:24.030 --> 00:50:24.040 align:start position:0%
control how that's done information good
 
00:50:25.470 --> 00:50:25.480 align:start position:0%
accurate information that public
 
00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
employees share with citizens about
 
00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
public things will influence the way
 
00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:32.680 align:start position:0%
attentive citizens vote and public
 
00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:36.160 align:start position:0%
employees can't control that but that
 
00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
kind of action would be encompassed as
 
00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
electioneering would be classified as
 
00:50:44.109 --> 00:50:44.119 align:start position:0%
electioneering because of the over broad
 
00:50:46.670 --> 00:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
way in which this otherwise
 
00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
well-intentioned and salutary
 
00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:52.200 align:start position:0%
Bill defines electioneering and for that
 
00:50:55.710 --> 00:50:55.720 align:start position:0%
reason I would encourage us to defeat
 
00:50:57.910 --> 00:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
the uh to pass motion so that we could
 
00:51:00.829 --> 00:51:00.839 align:start position:0%
work more on this bill chair recognize
 
00:51:00.839 --> 00:51:02.470 align:start position:0%
work more on this bill chair recognize
representive

00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
representive
 
00:51:05.309 --> 00:51:05.319 align:start position:0%
Barry thank you and obviously I disagree
 
00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:07.720 align:start position:0%
with the uh statement from the member of
 
00:51:09.789 --> 00:51:09.799 align:start position:0%
the minority uh I I don't believe that
 
00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:11.640 align:start position:0%
this bill would cover uh what he just
 
00:51:13.990 --> 00:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
referenced uh this bill is designed to
 
00:51:16.309 --> 00:51:16.319 align:start position:0%
do what the statute was originally
 
00:51:19.349 --> 00:51:19.359 align:start position:0%
supposed to do which is stop public
 
00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
employees from using their position and
 
00:51:23.950 --> 00:51:23.960 align:start position:0%
government taxpayer funded resources
 
00:51:26.789 --> 00:51:26.799 align:start position:0%
from putting their fingers on the scale
 
00:51:29.069 --> 00:51:29.079 align:start position:0%
of of Elections and measures and I'll
 
00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
give you two examples we had an issue in
 
00:51:35.230 --> 00:51:35.240 align:start position:0%
amher with their SAU where three days
 
00:51:37.309 --> 00:51:37.319 align:start position:0%
they sent it out on a Friday for filming
 
00:51:41.069 --> 00:51:41.079 align:start position:0%
on a Monday in a public school they said
 
00:51:43.069 --> 00:51:43.079 align:start position:0%
to parents hey on Monday we're bringing
 
00:51:45.510 --> 00:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
a camera crew through uh we're going to
 
00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
film the school um and oh by the way
 
00:51:50.670 --> 00:51:50.680 align:start position:0%
your kids might be in that video um
 
00:51:52.309 --> 00:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
we're also going to do interviews with
 
00:51:54.349 --> 00:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
staff um and we're going to put they're
 
00:51:55.789 --> 00:51:55.799 align:start position:0%
going to put together this video about
 
00:51:58.549 --> 00:51:58.559 align:start position:0%
the school and what they didn't say was
 
00:52:00.870 --> 00:52:00.880 align:start position:0%
that for the the previous three town
 
00:52:03.150 --> 00:52:03.160 align:start position:0%
elections there had been a Warren
 
00:52:05.589 --> 00:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
article about spending on the school
 
00:52:07.349 --> 00:52:07.359 align:start position:0%
infrastructure so they were putting
 
00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:09.240 align:start position:0%
their finger they were allowing a camera
 
00:52:11.829 --> 00:52:11.839 align:start position:0%
to come through and film children so
 
00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
that they could put their finger on the
 
00:52:15.789 --> 00:52:15.799 align:start position:0%
scale of an outcome of a measure in the
 
00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
town that I represent in gtown the
 
00:52:20.549 --> 00:52:20.559 align:start position:0%
library put forward an overtly biased
 
00:52:24.549 --> 00:52:24.559 align:start position:0%
survey that was found that was crafted
 
00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
we found out through a right to no
 
00:52:28.430 --> 00:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
request by by the employees eight out of
 
00:52:30.190 --> 00:52:30.200 align:start position:0%
the 12 questions came from town
 
00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
employees and the questions might as
 
00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
well have read why are Republicans bad
 
00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
and Democrats good and then the doj for
 
00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
some reason said oh well you have an
 
00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to refute the
 
00:52:43.870 --> 00:52:43.880 align:start position:0%
question the statute was designed to be
 
00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:46.640 align:start position:0%
broad electioneering by public employees
 
00:52:48.910 --> 00:52:48.920 align:start position:0%
is the only section of election law
 
00:52:51.549 --> 00:52:51.559 align:start position:0%
currently with its own definition of
 
00:52:53.910 --> 00:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
electioneering it was designed by this
 
00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
body and by the way a member of the
 
00:52:58.589 --> 00:52:58.599 align:start position:0%
other party was designed by this body to
 
00:53:01.109 --> 00:53:01.119 align:start position:0%
be intentionally broad so that public
 
00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
employees are not putting their fingers
 
00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
on the scale and the reason you have to
 
00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:06.760 align:start position:0%
have broad language is because when you
 
00:53:09.670 --> 00:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
start talking about intent it is almost
 
00:53:12.030 --> 00:53:12.040 align:start position:0%
impossible in a court of law to prove
 
00:53:14.789 --> 00:53:14.799 align:start position:0%
intent the purpose of it being overly
 
00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
broad is to go to what this body
 
00:53:19.950 --> 00:53:19.960 align:start position:0%
originally enacted it is supposed to be
 
00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
broad public employees should not be
 
00:53:25.069 --> 00:53:25.079 align:start position:0%
using their position and their taxpayer
 
00:53:27.950 --> 00:53:27.960 align:start position:0%
funded resources to change the outcome
 
00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:33.430 --> 00:53:33.440 align:start position:0%

committee we have a number of amendments
 
00:54:54.630 --> 00:54:54.640 align:start position:0%
here representative Reed offers floor
 
00:54:56.789 --> 00:54:56.799 align:start position:0%
Amendment 02
 
00:55:00.430 --> 00:55:00.440 align:start position:0%
54 it's in your seat pockets and the
 
00:55:03.349 --> 00:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative Reed
 
00:55:04.710 --> 00:55:04.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
00:55:07.990 --> 00:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
Speaker and uh in advance I'm going to
 
00:55:09.870 --> 00:55:09.880 align:start position:0%
request a division on this to make sure
 
00:55:10.789 --> 00:55:10.799 align:start position:0%
we don't
 
00:55:14.109 --> 00:55:14.119 align:start position:0%
forget um I want to talk about what hb60
 
00:55:16.270 --> 00:55:16.280 align:start position:0%
seeks to do and how this amendment
 
00:55:18.109 --> 00:55:18.119 align:start position:0%
ameliorates some of the weaknesses and
 
00:55:20.710 --> 00:55:20.720 align:start position:0%
some of the problems in the underlying
 
00:55:24.309 --> 00:55:24.319 align:start position:0%
Bill the stated intent of hb60 is to
 
00:55:26.349 --> 00:55:26.359 align:start position:0%
solve the problem that landlords are
 
00:55:29.109 --> 00:55:29.119 align:start position:0%
being forced to keep otherwise good
 
00:55:31.589 --> 00:55:31.599 align:start position:0%
tenants who pay their rent on time and
 
00:55:34.150 --> 00:55:34.160 align:start position:0%
abide by all of the terms of their lease
 
00:55:36.510 --> 00:55:36.520 align:start position:0%
um to evict them because the idea is
 
00:55:38.670 --> 00:55:38.680 align:start position:0%
that there's this P pandemic of
 
00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
landlords that are just being forced to
 
00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
keep these really good tenants but all
 
00:55:46.510 --> 00:55:46.520 align:start position:0%
of the examples as to why a landlord
 
00:55:48.670 --> 00:55:48.680 align:start position:0%
would want to evict an otherwise good
 
00:55:51.589 --> 00:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
tenant that pays their rent on time and
 
00:55:53.589 --> 00:55:53.599 align:start position:0%
abides by all the rules that were given
 
00:55:56.349 --> 00:55:56.359 align:start position:0%
in the hearing all of those are already
 
00:55:58.069 --> 00:55:58.079 align:start position:0%
already protected in law there are
 
00:56:01.630 --> 00:56:01.640 align:start position:0%
already causes to evict the the examples
 
00:56:03.829 --> 00:56:03.839 align:start position:0%
given where well what if I want to raise
 
00:56:05.549 --> 00:56:05.559 align:start position:0%
the rent and rent it for more that's
 
00:56:07.349 --> 00:56:07.359 align:start position:0%
already allowed after you reach the end
 
00:56:09.510 --> 00:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
of your lease you can raise the rent
 
00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:11.160 align:start position:0%
however much you like if they don't want
 
00:56:14.390 --> 00:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
to pay it they have 30 days the landlord
 
00:56:16.630 --> 00:56:16.640 align:start position:0%
can already legally evict if they need
 
00:56:19.750 --> 00:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
to do remediation or major Renovations
 
00:56:22.430 --> 00:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
the landlord can already evict if they
 
00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
want to change the use of the property
 
00:56:27.230 --> 00:56:27.240 align:start position:0%
like I don't want to this out anymore I
 
00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:28.720 align:start position:0%
want to change it into something else or
 
00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
I want to let my adult Child live in it
 
00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
all of these things are already
 
00:56:36.309 --> 00:56:36.319 align:start position:0%
protected so then this has been working
 
00:56:39.309 --> 00:56:39.319 align:start position:0%
for decades and the question is why now
 
00:56:41.390 --> 00:56:41.400 align:start position:0%
why now when people are experiencing the
 
00:56:43.549 --> 00:56:43.559 align:start position:0%
most housing insecurity we've ever
 
00:56:46.470 --> 00:56:46.480 align:start position:0%
experienced as a state and if those
 
00:56:49.029 --> 00:56:49.039 align:start position:0%
reasons aren't the real reasons then
 
00:56:52.069 --> 00:56:52.079 align:start position:0%
what are the real reasons could it be
 
00:56:53.470 --> 00:56:53.480 align:start position:0%
that maybe the
 
00:56:56.069 --> 00:56:56.079 align:start position:0%
landlord after renting to the tenant saw
 
00:56:57.510 --> 00:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
the the tenant's bumper stickers and
 
00:56:59.910 --> 00:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
didn't like them could it be that they
 
00:57:02.029 --> 00:57:02.039 align:start position:0%
saw the tenant associating with a
 
00:57:03.750 --> 00:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
boyfriend or girlfriend or friend that
 
00:57:06.109 --> 00:57:06.119 align:start position:0%
they didn't like the look of could it be
 
00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:57:09.349 --> 00:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
landlord maybe had a political
 
00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
disagreement or a sports disagreement or
 
00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
any kind of disagreement or
 
00:57:18.390 --> 00:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
that they the lieutenant chose to have a
 
00:57:21.630 --> 00:57:21.640 align:start position:0%
firearm or chose to use medical cannabis
 
00:57:23.109 --> 00:57:23.119 align:start position:0%
and maybe the landlord didn't like that
 
00:57:25.349 --> 00:57:25.359 align:start position:0%
or maybe they just didn't like the fact
 
00:57:27.029 --> 00:57:27.039 align:start position:0%
that the tenant insisted that the
 
00:57:28.990 --> 00:57:29.000 align:start position:0%
landlord do repairs that the tenant is
 
00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
legally um entitled to have done
 
00:57:34.990 --> 00:57:35.000 align:start position:0%
whatever these reasons are these are
 
00:57:37.150 --> 00:57:37.160 align:start position:0%
personal reasons and not professional
 
00:57:39.349 --> 00:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
business-like reasons which is why the
 
00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
law is currently how it is this
 
00:57:44.950 --> 00:57:44.960 align:start position:0%
amendment seeks to try to solve some of
 
00:57:48.309 --> 00:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
the damage that this would do by doing
 
00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
three things first of all it provides a
 
00:57:52.510 --> 00:57:52.520 align:start position:0%
six-month grace period so you reach the
 
00:57:54.589 --> 00:57:54.599 align:start position:0%
end of your lease you're good tenant you
 
00:57:56.230 --> 00:57:56.240 align:start position:0%
can continue that month to month that we
 
00:57:58.349 --> 00:57:58.359 align:start position:0%
have currently for 6 months before you
 
00:58:01.190 --> 00:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
get the 60-day notice of eviction and it
 
00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
is a notice of
 
00:58:05.750 --> 00:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
eviction the second is that if you were
 
00:58:08.789 --> 00:58:08.799 align:start position:0%
a good tenant you paid your rent you did
 
00:58:10.630 --> 00:58:10.640 align:start position:0%
everything correctly and the only reason
 
00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
that you're getting that 60-day notice
 
00:58:14.829 --> 00:58:14.839 align:start position:0%
of eviction is because you lived long
 
00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
enough to see the end of your lease then
 
00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
the record of the eviction will be
 
00:58:21.630 --> 00:58:21.640 align:start position:0%
sealed because good tenants who pay
 
00:58:23.349 --> 00:58:23.359 align:start position:0%
their rent who do everything right
 
00:58:25.549 --> 00:58:25.559 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have this on their record in a
 
00:58:28.430 --> 00:58:28.440 align:start position:0%
situation where even the best of tenants
 
00:58:30.190 --> 00:58:30.200 align:start position:0%
are having a hard time finding something
 
00:58:31.950 --> 00:58:31.960 align:start position:0%
because there's nothing available and
 
00:58:34.069 --> 00:58:34.079 align:start position:0%
the final thing that this does is the
 
00:58:35.870 --> 00:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Housing Finance Authority
 
00:58:40.270 --> 00:58:40.280 align:start position:0%
has said that a 5% vacancy rate among
 
00:58:43.470 --> 00:58:43.480 align:start position:0%
properties is what is needed for a even
 
00:58:46.430 --> 00:58:46.440 align:start position:0%
remotely healthy Market a 5% so what
 
00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
we're saying in this amendment is fine
 
00:58:51.470 --> 00:58:51.480 align:start position:0%
you can do this no cause eviction with
 
00:58:54.069 --> 00:58:54.079 align:start position:0%
the six-month grace period but only in a
 
00:58:56.750 --> 00:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
market that's 5% or greater not when
 
00:58:59.309 --> 00:58:59.319 align:start position:0%
people are already having a problem
 
00:59:01.510 --> 00:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
finding a place to live so that would be
 
00:59:05.470 --> 00:59:05.480 align:start position:0%
the trigger is the 5% vacancy over that
 
00:59:07.349 --> 00:59:07.359 align:start position:0%
they can do it under that we're in a
 
00:59:12.349 --> 00:59:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:17.230 --> 00:59:17.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:19.309 --> 00:59:19.319 align:start position:0%
Alexander thank you Mr Speaker Mr
 
00:59:20.430 --> 00:59:20.440 align:start position:0%
Speaker this amendment would add a
 
00:59:22.029 --> 00:59:22.039 align:start position:0%
trigger to the law to only make it go
 
00:59:24.589 --> 00:59:24.599 align:start position:0%
into effect when the R Rental vacancy is
 
00:59:27.870 --> 00:59:27.880 align:start position:0%
5% or higher for a 12-month period this
 
00:59:29.430 --> 00:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
amendment will add unnecessary
 
00:59:31.589 --> 00:59:31.599 align:start position:0%
regulation for our housing providers and
 
00:59:33.789 --> 00:59:33.799 align:start position:0%
this bill is introduced already provides
 
00:59:35.789 --> 00:59:35.799 align:start position:0%
for more certainty in the housing market
 
00:59:37.309 --> 00:59:37.319 align:start position:0%
and encourages communication between
 
00:59:39.510 --> 00:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
housing providers and tenants I urge the
 
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:42.000 align:start position:0%

00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:44.400 align:start position:0%

seconded it is sufficiently seconded
 
00:59:53.109 --> 00:59:53.119 align:start position:0%

recognizes representative Reed for
 
01:01:06.079 --> 01:01:08.349 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative Reed for
parliamentary

01:01:08.349 --> 01:01:08.359 align:start position:0%
parliamentary
 
01:01:12.589 --> 01:01:12.599 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
01:01:15.549 --> 01:01:15.559 align:start position:0%
that we are in the worst housing crisis
 
01:01:17.470 --> 01:01:17.480 align:start position:0%
this state has ever seen with the most
 
01:01:19.549 --> 01:01:19.559 align:start position:0%
housing insecurity that this state has
 
01:01:22.789 --> 01:01:22.799 align:start position:0%
ever seen with the highest rate of
 
01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
increase in homelessness that any state
 
01:01:26.549 --> 01:01:26.559 align:start position:0%
is seeing
 
01:01:30.349 --> 01:01:30.359 align:start position:0%
at all and if I further know that
 
01:01:33.390 --> 01:01:33.400 align:start position:0%
although I understand that landlords may
 
01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
not want to keep tenants that they
 
01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
personally dislike in uh housing for
 
01:01:41.029 --> 01:01:41.039 align:start position:0%
year upon year upon year that this is
 
01:01:43.829 --> 01:01:43.839 align:start position:0%
not the time in a
 
01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
0.6% vacancy to make housing more
 
01:01:49.270 --> 01:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
insecure for the people who have to work
 
01:01:52.470 --> 01:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
in the state and finally if I know that
 
01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:54.720 align:start position:0%
the bill with this amendment passing
 
01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
would still allow those land Lords to
 
01:01:57.789 --> 01:01:57.799 align:start position:0%
kick out tenants they don't like for
 
01:02:00.910 --> 01:02:00.920 align:start position:0%
personal reasons but would say that
 
01:02:02.829 --> 01:02:02.839 align:start position:0%
there would be a six-month grace period
 
01:02:04.470 --> 01:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
that the record of eviction would be
 
01:02:07.470 --> 01:02:07.480 align:start position:0%
sealed for good tenants and would only
 
01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
go into effect if we finally get to that
 
01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
5% we're supposed to be at would I now
 
01:02:14.309 --> 01:02:14.319 align:start position:0%
press the green button and pass the
 
01:02:15.670 --> 01:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
amendment to make this a much more
 
01:02:17.549 --> 01:02:17.559 align:start position:0%
reasonable Bill J recognize

Speaker Mr Speaker if I know this bill
 
01:02:25.349 --> 01:02:25.359 align:start position:0%
is carefully drafted and adds certainly
 
01:02:27.069 --> 01:02:27.079 align:start position:0%
certainty to a volatile and
 
01:02:29.109 --> 01:02:29.119 align:start position:0%
unpredictable housing market for both
 
01:02:31.029 --> 01:02:31.039 align:start position:0%
housing provider and tenants and if I
 
01:02:33.309 --> 01:02:33.319 align:start position:0%
know this bill is a good bill as is and
 
01:02:35.510 --> 01:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
no changes are needed would I then press
 
01:02:38.230 --> 01:02:38.240 align:start position:0%

so

01:03:34.829 --> 01:03:34.839 align:start position:0%

and the chair the chair recognizes
 
01:04:31.870 --> 01:04:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:34.710 --> 01:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:38.109 --> 01:04:38.119 align:start position:0%
Speaker like many of us in this citizen
 
01:04:40.190 --> 01:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
legislature I wear a lot of
 
01:04:43.589 --> 01:04:43.599 align:start position:0%
hats first and foremost I'm the proud
 
01:04:46.789 --> 01:04:46.799 align:start position:0%
dad of two amazing kids I'm a
 
01:04:50.269 --> 01:04:50.279 align:start position:0%
businessman I volunteer in my community
 
01:04:52.589 --> 01:04:52.599 align:start position:0%
and I'm also a housing
 
01:04:55.109 --> 01:04:55.119 align:start position:0%
provider I'm a small mom and popop
 
01:04:55.119 --> 01:04:56.549 align:start position:0%
provider I'm a small mom and popop
landlord

01:04:56.549 --> 01:04:56.559 align:start position:0%
landlord
 
01:04:59.029 --> 01:04:59.039 align:start position:0%
just like the folks this bill is meant
 
01:04:59.039 --> 01:05:00.710 align:start position:0%
just like the folks this bill is meant
to

01:05:00.710 --> 01:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:05:03.069 --> 01:05:03.079 align:start position:0%
protect as I offer this amendment I want
 
01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:05:06.829 --> 01:05:06.839 align:start position:0%
clear I understand the challenges that
 
01:05:08.950 --> 01:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
this bill is trying to
 
01:05:11.390 --> 01:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
address I've dealt with tough tenant
 
01:05:13.670 --> 01:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
situations and I know how difficult the
 
01:05:16.910 --> 01:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
eviction process can be for small
 
01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
landlords these are legitimate issues
 
01:05:21.349 --> 01:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
and I agree they deserve our attention
 
01:05:22.990 --> 01:05:23.000 align:start position:0%
as a
 
01:05:26.269 --> 01:05:26.279 align:start position:0%
body but I also have another ha that I
 
01:05:30.029 --> 01:05:30.039 align:start position:0%
wear which is being a good
 
01:05:32.549 --> 01:05:32.559 align:start position:0%
neighbor and as a good neighbor I have
 
01:05:34.990 --> 01:05:35.000 align:start position:0%
to say without this amendment this bill
 
01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
would do more harm than good and at the
 
01:05:41.390 --> 01:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
worst possible
 
01:05:43.829 --> 01:05:43.839 align:start position:0%
time let me share two numbers that
 
01:05:45.710 --> 01:05:45.720 align:start position:0%
explain why this amendment is so
 
01:05:47.670 --> 01:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
important in my
 
01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:49.750 align:start position:0%
important in my
opinion

01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
01:05:52.430 --> 01:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
0.8% that's New Hampshire's current
 
01:05:57.510 --> 01:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:59.269 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:05:59.269 --> 01:05:59.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:06:01.990 --> 01:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
52% that's how much homelessness
 
01:06:06.190 --> 01:06:06.200 align:start position:0%
increased in our state from 2022 to 2023
 
01:06:10.670 --> 01:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
and it's the highest jump in the entire
 
01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
nation if we pass this bill without this
 
01:06:19.349 --> 01:06:19.359 align:start position:0%
amendment families who get evicted For
 
01:06:21.870 --> 01:06:21.880 align:start position:0%
No Good
 
01:06:25.789 --> 01:06:25.799 align:start position:0%
Reason will quite simply have nowhere to
 
01:06:28.190 --> 01:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
go that's the bottom
 
01:06:31.589 --> 01:06:31.599 align:start position:0%
line virtually every family evicted
 
01:06:34.430 --> 01:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
under this bill without this amendment
 
01:06:36.589 --> 01:06:36.599 align:start position:0%
will experience some period of
 
01:06:39.870 --> 01:06:39.880 align:start position:0%
homelessness and seniors and people with
 
01:06:45.549 --> 01:06:45.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:48.190 --> 01:06:48.200 align:start position:0%
risk with this amendment what I hope I'm
 
01:06:50.950 --> 01:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
offering is a reasonable middle
 
01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
ground it simply ensures that the no
 
01:06:56.230 --> 01:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
fault evictions this bill creates won't
 
01:06:59.349 --> 01:06:59.359 align:start position:0%
take effect until that rental vacancy
 
01:07:01.069 --> 01:07:01.079 align:start position:0%
rate reaches
 
01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
2.5% and to be clear that's that's still
 
01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
only halfway that's halfway to what
 
01:07:10.589 --> 01:07:10.599 align:start position:0%
economists would consider a balanced
 
01:07:12.950 --> 01:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
Market this way when good tenants are
 
01:07:16.789 --> 01:07:16.799 align:start position:0%
forced out they'll at least have a fair
 
01:07:21.710 --> 01:07:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:24.589 --> 01:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
live so I understand and I'm sympathetic
 
01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
to the goals of the the underlying bill
 
01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
but I also believe that folks who have
 
01:07:33.630 --> 01:07:33.640 align:start position:0%
done absolutely nothing wrong deserve a
 
01:07:36.269 --> 01:07:36.279 align:start position:0%
fighting chance to stay
 
01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
housed especially at this moment where
 
01:07:41.269 --> 01:07:41.279 align:start position:0%
we have the fastest growing ranks of
 
01:07:43.390 --> 01:07:43.400 align:start position:0%
homeless people in the
 
01:07:45.549 --> 01:07:45.559 align:start position:0%
country thank you Mr Speaker and I
 
01:07:47.230 --> 01:07:47.240 align:start position:0%

Tri to this law to only go into effect
 
01:08:00.470 --> 01:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
when the R Rental vacancy rate is 2.5%
 
01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
or higher for a 12-month period this
 
01:08:04.470 --> 01:08:04.480 align:start position:0%
amendment would add unnecessary
 
01:08:06.589 --> 01:08:06.599 align:start position:0%

their entire
 
01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
life I understand the struggles of
 
01:13:02.590 --> 01:13:02.600 align:start position:0%
landlords trying to navigate New
 
01:13:04.550 --> 01:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's eviction process but I would
 
01:13:07.790 --> 01:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
ask my colleagues today to reject the
 
01:13:11.510 --> 01:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
false premise that this bill is the only
 
01:13:13.510 --> 01:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
answer to that problem or even a good
 
01:13:15.310 --> 01:13:15.320 align:start position:0%
answer to that
 
01:13:18.590 --> 01:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
problem this bill goes too far leaving
 
01:13:20.629 --> 01:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
every tenant in New Hampshire vulnerable
 
01:13:22.510 --> 01:13:22.520 align:start position:0%
to losing their home for no reason at
 
01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:25.590 align:start position:0%
to losing their home for no reason at
all

01:13:25.590 --> 01:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:28.110 --> 01:13:28.120 align:start position:0%
no fault eviction would also make it
 
01:13:30.669 --> 01:13:30.679 align:start position:0%
infinitely harder for tenants who
 
01:13:32.550 --> 01:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
believe they are being kicked out for
 
01:13:35.149 --> 01:13:35.159 align:start position:0%
retaliatory or discriminatory reasons to
 
01:13:38.550 --> 01:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
prove that as one lawyer shared in our
 
01:13:41.310 --> 01:13:41.320 align:start position:0%
hearing her advice to her clients should
 
01:13:44.030 --> 01:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
this bill pass would basically be tough
 
01:13:47.149 --> 01:13:47.159 align:start position:0%
luck tough luck if you suspect your new
 
01:13:49.070 --> 01:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
landlord just doesn't like you because
 
01:13:50.550 --> 01:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
of the color of your skin or who you
 
01:13:52.870 --> 01:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
love tough
 
01:13:55.990 --> 01:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
luck tough luck if you complained about
 
01:14:00.350 --> 01:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:03.149 --> 01:14:03.159 align:start position:0%
retaliation regardless of the
 
01:14:06.390 --> 01:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
reason the Ripple effects of eviction
 
01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:07.510 align:start position:0%
reason the Ripple effects of eviction
are

01:14:07.510 --> 01:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:14:10.229 --> 01:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
devastating kids lose stability in
 
01:14:12.830 --> 01:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
school workers struggle to keep their
 
01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:14.960 align:start position:0%
jobs and businesses struggle to keep
 
01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:16.110 align:start position:0%
jobs and businesses struggle to keep
their

01:14:16.110 --> 01:14:16.120 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:14:18.709 --> 01:14:18.719 align:start position:0%
workforces towns already strapped for
 
01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
cash are left footing the bill for
 
01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
emergency housing and services and as
 
01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
the state local welfare administrators
 
01:14:28.550 --> 01:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
Association testified in committee when
 
01:14:30.430 --> 01:14:30.440 align:start position:0%
we see this bill pass we will see
 
01:14:36.390 --> 01:14:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:39.110 --> 01:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
costs as I noted in my prior speech
 
01:14:41.390 --> 01:14:41.400 align:start position:0%
homelessness in New Hampshire jumped
 
01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
52% but this isn't just a statistic it's
 
01:14:47.470 --> 01:14:47.480 align:start position:0%
real people it's real people losing
 
01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
their homes their security and their
 
01:14:52.870 --> 01:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
sense of belonging and
 
01:14:55.750 --> 01:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
Community it sounds very tidy
 
01:14:57.990 --> 01:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
when you say a contract is a contract
 
01:15:00.149 --> 01:15:00.159 align:start position:0%
and I get the appeal of that argument
 
01:15:02.189 --> 01:15:02.199 align:start position:0%
but let's take a second to really ground
 
01:15:04.910 --> 01:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
truth the stakes of the
 
01:15:08.070 --> 01:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
bill the lived reality we'll experience
 
01:15:09.830 --> 01:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
if this bill
 
01:15:13.310 --> 01:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
passes if this bill passes another mom
 
01:15:15.590 --> 01:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
and her kids will be living out of their
 
01:15:18.430 --> 01:15:18.440 align:start position:0%
car if this bill passes another
 
01:15:20.669 --> 01:15:20.679 align:start position:0%
displaced senior will be pitching their
 
01:15:23.910 --> 01:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
tent out in the woods and I would wager
 
01:15:25.510 --> 01:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
that some version of this
 
01:15:28.830 --> 01:15:28.840 align:start position:0%
will play across all of our
 
01:15:33.030 --> 01:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
districts I urge you to join me in uh
 
01:15:35.910 --> 01:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
voting against OTP thank you chair
 
01:15:38.390 --> 01:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
recognize representative
 
01:15:42.149 --> 01:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
Alexander thank you Mr Speaker um hp60
 
01:15:43.550 --> 01:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
is a bill that addresses termination of
 
01:15:44.830 --> 01:15:44.840 align:start position:0%
tency this has nothing to do with
 
01:15:46.430 --> 01:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
evictions um this has to do with
 
01:15:48.550 --> 01:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
terminating a contract when a contract's
 
01:15:50.270 --> 01:15:50.280 align:start position:0%
over there's a conversation about
 
01:15:52.270 --> 01:15:52.280 align:start position:0%
renewing the contract it's basic
 
01:15:54.110 --> 01:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
contract law so we're just keep we're
 
01:15:56.310 --> 01:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
just updating in it to all the other
 
01:15:57.750 --> 01:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
contract law in the state making sure
 
01:16:00.550 --> 01:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
it's consistent when something expires
 
01:16:02.310 --> 01:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
both parties come together and they have
 
01:16:04.110 --> 01:16:04.120 align:start position:0%
a new contract they hash it out and
 
01:16:05.510 --> 01:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
figure out what's moving forward there's
 
01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
nothing wrong with this this is nothing
 
01:16:08.750 --> 01:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
about evictions it's about renewing an
 
01:16:11.149 --> 01:16:11.159 align:start position:0%
original contract
 
01:16:13.870 --> 01:16:13.880 align:start position:0%
um and it also on top of that adds a
 
01:16:16.189 --> 01:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
60-day notice so even if the contract's
 
01:16:18.270 --> 01:16:18.280 align:start position:0%
about to expire the housing provider can
 
01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
say hey your contract's expiring I don't
 
01:16:23.669 --> 01:16:23.679 align:start position:0%
want to renew the contract and you have
 
01:16:25.990 --> 01:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
to notice them within 60 days so would
 
01:16:27.990 --> 01:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
do I think that's perfect no I'd say 30
 
01:16:29.470 --> 01:16:29.480 align:start position:0%
days is great or or something less than
 
01:16:30.950 --> 01:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
that because I think at the end of the
 
01:16:31.990 --> 01:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
day it's your property you should do
 
01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
what you want with it so um with that I
 
01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
think the bill is good and you should
 
01:16:38.030 --> 01:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
vote off to pass thank

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
01:18:09.149 --> 01:18:09.159 align:start position:0%
if I know that hb60 will cause good
 
01:18:11.790 --> 01:18:11.800 align:start position:0%
tenants to lose their housing even
 
01:18:13.470 --> 01:18:13.480 align:start position:0%
though they have always paid their rent
 
01:18:15.790 --> 01:18:15.800 align:start position:0%
on time and have never caused any
 
01:18:18.149 --> 01:18:18.159 align:start position:0%
problems and will cause some of these
 
01:18:20.669 --> 01:18:20.679 align:start position:0%
good tenants to be put out on the street
 
01:18:22.709 --> 01:18:22.719 align:start position:0%
through no fault of their own and
 
01:18:24.910 --> 01:18:24.920 align:start position:0%
further increasing New Hampshire's
 
01:18:27.709 --> 01:18:27.719 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
01:18:43.270 --> 01:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
if I know that a legal contract requires
 
01:18:45.510 --> 01:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
both a start date and an end date if I
 
01:18:47.229 --> 01:18:47.239 align:start position:0%
know that clear expectations on both
 
01:18:49.470 --> 01:18:49.480 align:start position:0%
sides creates a successful relationship
 
01:18:50.790 --> 01:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
and if I know that this will add
 
01:18:52.510 --> 01:18:52.520 align:start position:0%
increased certainty in an unusually
 
01:18:54.430 --> 01:18:54.440 align:start position:0%

putting in
 
01:22:19.830 --> 01:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
work they will grow as Learners the
 
01:22:21.910 --> 01:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
alternative message is that we don't
 
01:22:23.470 --> 01:22:23.480 align:start position:0%
believe in their ability to grow or to
 
01:22:26.669 --> 01:22:26.679 align:start position:0%
improve the intent of House Bill 444 is
 
01:22:28.790 --> 01:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
to help renters be aware of the S the
 
01:22:31.310 --> 01:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
sale of their housing and even allow for
 
01:22:33.709 --> 01:22:33.719 align:start position:0%
the possibility are purchasing their
 
01:22:36.790 --> 01:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
housing thus increasing home ownership
 
01:22:38.270 --> 01:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
and helping people to live more
 
01:22:39.910 --> 01:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
financially secure
 
01:22:43.070 --> 01:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
lives recognizing that home ownership
 
01:22:45.750 --> 01:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
the home ownership part of this bill was
 
01:22:47.110 --> 01:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
problematic to summon the housing
 
01:22:48.750 --> 01:22:48.760 align:start position:0%
committee I urge you to focus on the
 
01:22:51.390 --> 01:22:51.400 align:start position:0%
notification part of this bill instead
 
01:22:54.030 --> 01:22:54.040 align:start position:0%
if a landlord provides notification on
 
01:22:55.590 --> 01:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
the sale of the property it allows
 
01:22:58.030 --> 01:22:58.040 align:start position:0%
renters to decide whether they are going
 
01:23:00.270 --> 01:23:00.280 align:start position:0%
to begin looking for new housing or just
 
01:23:02.830 --> 01:23:02.840 align:start position:0%
stay put we have heard many times that
 
01:23:05.590 --> 01:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
when a rental property is sold it is
 
01:23:08.590 --> 01:23:08.600 align:start position:0%
typical for rents to increase often
 
01:23:11.149 --> 01:23:11.159 align:start position:0%
substantially and often Out Of
 
01:23:13.669 --> 01:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
Reach it is also typical for renters to
 
01:23:15.669 --> 01:23:15.679 align:start position:0%
be told only after the sale of a
 
01:23:18.110 --> 01:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
property providing them no notice that
 
01:23:20.590 --> 01:23:20.600 align:start position:0%
their lives are about to be thrown into
 
01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:22.550 align:start position:0%
their lives are about to be thrown into
potential

01:23:22.550 --> 01:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
potential
 
01:23:24.750 --> 01:23:24.760 align:start position:0%
upheaval I joined the housing Comm
 
01:23:28.270 --> 01:23:28.280 align:start position:0%
wanting to work on bills and I again say
 
01:23:29.870 --> 01:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
to do the
 
01:23:33.110 --> 01:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
work support um supporting an itl motion
 
01:23:35.870 --> 01:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
on this right means that we will are not
 
01:23:38.510 --> 01:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
willing to work on this bill it sends a
 
01:23:40.310 --> 01:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
message to our constituents that we
 
01:23:42.870 --> 01:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
don't actually care about housing taking
 
01:23:44.590 --> 01:23:44.600 align:start position:0%
the time to work on it sends a message
 
01:23:46.790 --> 01:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
that we are listening that we're trying
 
01:23:48.709 --> 01:23:48.719 align:start position:0%
that we're working for them and most
 
01:23:51.229 --> 01:23:51.239 align:start position:0%
importantly that we care about them a
 
01:23:52.910 --> 01:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
vote to itl this bill sends the wrong
 
01:23:57.310 --> 01:23:57.320 align:start position:0%
message please vote no on this Mo motion
 
01:23:59.350 --> 01:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
so an amendment can be offered that
 
01:24:01.709 --> 01:24:01.719 align:start position:0%
simplifies the bill and helps Grant it
 
01:24:04.430 --> 01:24:04.440 align:start position:0%
sters a simple notification requirement
 
01:24:06.910 --> 01:24:06.920 align:start position:0%
for landlords is not overly burdensome
 
01:24:08.750 --> 01:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
and it provides more transparencies for
 
01:24:10.750 --> 01:24:10.760 align:start position:0%
renters about the changes in their
 
01:24:15.189 --> 01:24:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
you Mr Speaker I ask for a division vote
 
01:24:26.629 --> 01:24:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:29.910 --> 01:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:34.149 --> 01:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
Speaker HB 444 is an act relative to
 
01:24:36.149 --> 01:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
attendant's right to notification prior
 
01:24:38.669 --> 01:24:38.679 align:start position:0%
to the sale of multif Family
 
01:24:40.830 --> 01:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
Properties but it's more than that it's
 
01:24:42.830 --> 01:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
really a right of first
 
01:24:45.470 --> 01:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
refusal the goal of the housing
 
01:24:47.350 --> 01:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
Committee in light of the current
 
01:24:49.109 --> 01:24:49.119 align:start position:0%
housing crisis in New Hampshire is to
 
01:24:51.470 --> 01:24:51.480 align:start position:0%
stabilize the housing market by
 
01:24:52.870 --> 01:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
increasing affordability and
 
01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:54.550 align:start position:0%
increasing affordability and
availability

01:24:54.550 --> 01:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
availability
 
01:24:56.070 --> 01:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
increased investment in rental
 
01:24:58.109 --> 01:24:58.119 align:start position:0%
properties will be a requirement to
 
01:25:01.189 --> 01:25:01.199 align:start position:0%
achieve these goals under any scenario
 
01:25:04.030 --> 01:25:04.040 align:start position:0%
HB 444 achieves none of those goals and
 
01:25:07.030 --> 01:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
in facts undermines them
 
01:25:09.430 --> 01:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
all this bill requires the owner of
 
01:25:11.310 --> 01:25:11.320 align:start position:0%
multif family Residential Properties to
 
01:25:14.030 --> 01:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
provide net tenants with notice of the
 
01:25:16.149 --> 01:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
property and an opportunity to make an
 
01:25:18.310 --> 01:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
offer to purchase the property while
 
01:25:20.750 --> 01:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
effectively barring all other
 
01:25:22.830 --> 01:25:22.840 align:start position:0%
purchasers what if I want to sell the
 
01:25:26.590 --> 01:25:26.600 align:start position:0%
property to my sister my son put it in a
 
01:25:29.910 --> 01:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
trust leave it as part of my estate this
 
01:25:32.109 --> 01:25:32.119 align:start position:0%
bill represents a significant impediment
 
01:25:33.790 --> 01:25:33.800 align:start position:0%
to the free flow of Commerce and
 
01:25:36.470 --> 01:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
transfer of real property it would be a
 
01:25:38.270 --> 01:25:38.280 align:start position:0%
restraint on the sale of residential
 
01:25:40.550 --> 01:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
property and would in all likelyhood
 
01:25:42.390 --> 01:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
decrease the willingness of individuals
 
01:25:44.310 --> 01:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
and entities to invest in Residential
 
01:25:47.109 --> 01:25:47.119 align:start position:0%
Properties in New Hampshire it does not
 
01:25:49.390 --> 01:25:49.400 align:start position:0%
significantly improve the situation of
 
01:25:52.149 --> 01:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
tenants who are looking to own a
 
01:25:54.750 --> 01:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
home further this bill repres presents
 
01:25:56.550 --> 01:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
significant potential unintended
 
01:25:58.870 --> 01:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
consequences related to both estate and
 
01:26:00.470 --> 01:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
tax planning for individuals and
 
01:26:03.470 --> 01:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
entities that currently own residential
 
01:26:05.830 --> 01:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
Investments the bill is fundamentally
 
01:26:07.910 --> 01:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
socialist in nature and undermines the
 
01:26:10.669 --> 01:26:10.679 align:start position:0%
rights of individual property ownership
 
01:26:12.350 --> 01:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
and the aspirational goals of the
 
01:26:13.910 --> 01:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
majority of
 
01:26:16.590 --> 01:26:16.600 align:start position:0%
Americans passage of this bill impedes
 
01:26:19.030 --> 01:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
individuals and entities willingness to
 
01:26:21.590 --> 01:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
invest in and maintain residential real
 
01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:24.000 align:start position:0%

01:26:26.550 --> 01:26:26.560 align:start position:0%
the real estate transaction with no
 
01:26:29.629 --> 01:26:29.639 align:start position:0%
appreciable public benefit the bill in
 
01:26:32.189 --> 01:26:32.199 align:start position:0%

01:27:52.350 --> 01:27:52.360 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
01:27:53.870 --> 01:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
if I know this bill could help granted
 
01:27:55.870 --> 01:27:55.880 align:start position:0%
state ERS have more options and control
 
01:27:58.590 --> 01:27:58.600 align:start position:0%
over their housing if I also know that
 
01:28:00.510 --> 01:28:00.520 align:start position:0%
too often renters face uncertain Futures
 
01:28:02.629 --> 01:28:02.639 align:start position:0%
as properties are sold without notice
 
01:28:05.149 --> 01:28:05.159 align:start position:0%
and rents increase Beyond reach if I
 
01:28:06.350 --> 01:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
believe that we all came here to work
 
01:28:08.550 --> 01:28:08.560 align:start position:0%
for our constituents and find solutions
 
01:28:11.470 --> 01:28:11.480 align:start position:0%
for crises like we are facing in housing
 
01:28:12.950 --> 01:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
and finally if I'm certain that killing
 
01:28:14.910 --> 01:28:14.920 align:start position:0%
imperfect bills that have Merit without
 
01:28:16.070 --> 01:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
putting in the work to improve them
 
01:28:17.590 --> 01:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
sends a message that we do not care
 
01:28:19.390 --> 01:28:19.400 align:start position:0%
about our neighbors then would I now
 
01:28:22.189 --> 01:28:22.199 align:start position:0%
vote against the io motion and allow for
 
01:28:25.390 --> 01:28:25.400 align:start position:0%
a reasonable amendment to this bill

01:28:35.510 --> 01:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
01:28:37.669 --> 01:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
if I know that this bill requires the
 
01:28:39.709 --> 01:28:39.719 align:start position:0%
owner of restricted multif family
 
01:28:42.870 --> 01:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
residential property to provide tenants
 
01:28:44.910 --> 01:28:44.920 align:start position:0%
with notice of sale for the property and
 
01:28:46.990 --> 01:28:47.000 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to make an offer to
 
01:28:49.750 --> 01:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
purchase that property and imposes a
 
01:28:52.470 --> 01:28:52.480 align:start position:0%
60-day waiting period for the tenants to
 
01:28:55.590 --> 01:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
respond and if I know that a property
 
01:28:58.550 --> 01:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
owner needed to sell quickly due to
 
01:29:01.350 --> 01:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
health or financial reasons the 60-day
 
01:29:03.870 --> 01:29:03.880 align:start position:0%
requirement in this bill would stifle
 
01:29:07.149 --> 01:29:07.159 align:start position:0%
real estate sales especially cash sales
 
01:29:10.070 --> 01:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
which have a very quick turnaround and
 
01:29:12.270 --> 01:29:12.280 align:start position:0%
if I know that this bill adds more
 
01:29:15.070 --> 01:29:15.080 align:start position:0%
regulation and will exacerbate the
 
01:29:18.189 --> 01:29:18.199 align:start position:0%
housing crisis rather than alleviate it
 
01:29:20.550 --> 01:29:20.560 align:start position:0%

honorable
 
01:35:21.470 --> 01:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
colleagues uh HB 623 attempts to
 
01:35:24.350 --> 01:35:24.360 align:start position:0%
accomplish one simple thing which is to
 
01:35:26.350 --> 01:35:26.360 align:start position:0%
prevent corporations from outbidding
 
01:35:28.270 --> 01:35:28.280 align:start position:0%
families who are trying to purchase a
 
01:35:31.030 --> 01:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
home this is a severe problem impacting
 
01:35:32.709 --> 01:35:32.719 align:start position:0%
our housing market here in New Hampshire
 
01:35:34.149 --> 01:35:34.159 align:start position:0%
and it's something that I've personally
 
01:35:37.350 --> 01:35:37.360 align:start position:0%
been impacted by a few years ago my
 
01:35:39.030 --> 01:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
husband and I were told by our landlord
 
01:35:40.229 --> 01:35:40.239 align:start position:0%
that he would be renovating our
 
01:35:43.109 --> 01:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
apartment and we needed to move out back
 
01:35:44.910 --> 01:35:44.920 align:start position:0%
when this was happening in 2021 and
 
01:35:47.350 --> 01:35:47.360 align:start position:0%
still to this day rents in Manchester
 
01:35:49.750 --> 01:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
are the same or more than the average
 
01:35:51.750 --> 01:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
mortgage so we decided to take the leap
 
01:35:53.950 --> 01:35:53.960 align:start position:0%
and look for a home in the city we had
 
01:35:56.350 --> 01:35:56.360 align:start position:0%
always lived in together over the next
 
01:35:58.229 --> 01:35:58.239 align:start position:0%
two months we viewed a number of homes
 
01:36:00.070 --> 01:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
even venturing outside of Manchester
 
01:36:02.750 --> 01:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
which was where we wanted to stay until
 
01:36:05.030 --> 01:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
the very last offer we made on the very
 
01:36:07.830 --> 01:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
last house we toured every single offer
 
01:36:10.109 --> 01:36:10.119 align:start position:0%
we made we were out bid on not by other
 
01:36:13.070 --> 01:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
young families but by corporations these
 
01:36:14.790 --> 01:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
mostly out ofst State groups would come
 
01:36:16.990 --> 01:36:17.000 align:start position:0%
in often without even looking at the
 
01:36:18.950 --> 01:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
property and put forward offers that
 
01:36:21.350 --> 01:36:21.360 align:start position:0%
were irresistible to the owners almost
 
01:36:23.590 --> 01:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
always paying in cash the most
 
01:36:25.310 --> 01:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
devastating home we lost out on the
 
01:36:27.510 --> 01:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
corporation overbid Us by
 
01:36:29.669 --> 01:36:29.679 align:start position:0%
$150,000 and then proceeded to reach out
 
01:36:31.669 --> 01:36:31.679 align:start position:0%
to my husband and I to ask if we would
 
01:36:34.350 --> 01:36:34.360 align:start position:0%
like to rent the property from them this
 
01:36:36.430 --> 01:36:36.440 align:start position:0%
is not a unique story and this is not
 
01:36:38.709 --> 01:36:38.719 align:start position:0%
only a New Hampshire problem over the
 
01:36:40.750 --> 01:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
last decade the number of investors
 
01:36:43.350 --> 01:36:43.360 align:start position:0%
purchasing homes has increased from 10
 
01:36:46.669 --> 01:36:46.679 align:start position:0%
10 to 15% each year except for 2020 to
 
01:36:49.189 --> 01:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
2021 which according to a study by red
 
01:36:51.709 --> 01:36:51.719 align:start position:0%
fin saw an increase of over
 
01:36:53.910 --> 01:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
80% when looking at the wall Street
 
01:36:55.390 --> 01:36:55.400 align:start position:0%
companies buying up homes you have a
 
01:36:56.870 --> 01:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
small list of corporations that have
 
01:36:59.109 --> 01:36:59.119 align:start position:0%
shaped this growing Trend one of the
 
01:37:01.030 --> 01:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
first corporations to make waves in this
 
01:37:04.430 --> 01:37:04.440 align:start position:0%
market is Blackstone founded in 1985
 
01:37:06.149 --> 01:37:06.159 align:start position:0%
Blackstone or Blackstone Group is an
 
01:37:08.350 --> 01:37:08.360 align:start position:0%
alternative investment firm based out of
 
01:37:10.910 --> 01:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
New York blackstone's total Capital as
 
01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
of 2021 sat at 880 billion over a third
 
01:37:16.910 --> 01:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
of which came from its real estate
 
01:37:19.430 --> 01:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
department this trend accelerated during
 
01:37:21.310 --> 01:37:21.320 align:start position:0%
covid-19 when low interest rates and
 
01:37:23.550 --> 01:37:23.560 align:start position:0%
Rising real estate prices spurred into
 
01:37:25.870 --> 01:37:25.880 align:start position:0%
investors to expand their portfolios by
 
01:37:29.350 --> 01:37:29.360 align:start position:0%
2022 investors accounted for nearly 30%
 
01:37:31.750 --> 01:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
of single family home sales up from an
 
01:37:35.390 --> 01:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
average of 16% just three years earlier
 
01:37:37.189 --> 01:37:37.199 align:start position:0%
in some cities institutional investors
 
01:37:38.870 --> 01:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
account for a far higher share of these
 
01:37:39.990 --> 01:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
single family
 
01:37:42.830 --> 01:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
homes according to a 2022 report by
 
01:37:45.270 --> 01:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
MetLife hedge funds market share of the
 
01:37:47.750 --> 01:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
7.6 million single family rental homes
 
01:37:50.109 --> 01:37:50.119 align:start position:0%
in the US is projected to balloon over
 
01:37:53.910 --> 01:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
the next decade from 5% in 2022 to over
 
01:37:55.669 --> 01:37:55.679 align:start position:0%
40% by
 
01:37:58.270 --> 01:37:58.280 align:start position:0%
2030 as in my own experience because
 
01:38:00.430 --> 01:38:00.440 align:start position:0%
investors are paying in cash they can
 
01:38:02.189 --> 01:38:02.199 align:start position:0%
often easily beat out first-time home
 
01:38:04.709 --> 01:38:04.719 align:start position:0%
buyers in New Hampshire a third of home
 
01:38:08.709 --> 01:38:08.719 align:start position:0%
sales in 2023 were purchased in cash on
 
01:38:10.709 --> 01:38:10.719 align:start position:0%
top of this once they buy the Homes
 
01:38:12.629 --> 01:38:12.639 align:start position:0%
single family rental companies often
 
01:38:15.870 --> 01:38:15.880 align:start position:0%
prove to be bad landlords a 2022 study
 
01:38:17.990 --> 01:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
by federal lawmakers found that five
 
01:38:20.070 --> 01:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
major rental companies hiked their fees
 
01:38:23.109 --> 01:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
by 40% over a 3-year period and saw
 
01:38:25.510 --> 01:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
their tenants fall behind in rent in
 
01:38:27.510 --> 01:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
California the state's largest corporate

landlord Invitation Homes was forced to
 
01:38:32.510 --> 01:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
pay $2 million in sanctions after the
 
01:38:33.910 --> 01:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
State Attorney General found it was
 
01:38:36.629 --> 01:38:36.639 align:start position:0%
charging tenants illegally High rates
 
01:38:38.189 --> 01:38:38.199 align:start position:0%
research has also documented that
 
01:38:40.270 --> 01:38:40.280 align:start position:0%
corporate landlords file more evictions

permanently harm tenants ability to find
 
01:38:46.589 --> 01:38:46.599 align:start position:0%
housing in the future this legislation
 
01:38:48.750 --> 01:38:48.760 align:start position:0%
is not unique a similar bill was
 
01:38:51.310 --> 01:38:51.320 align:start position:0%
introduced to this body last session and
 
01:38:52.910 --> 01:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
Democrats in the US Senate and House
 
01:38:55.510 --> 01:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
have also sponsored similar legislation
 
01:38:57.589 --> 01:38:57.599 align:start position:0%
a Republicans bill in the Ohio State
 
01:38:59.510 --> 01:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
Legislature aims to drive out these
 
01:39:00.990 --> 01:39:01.000 align:start position:0%
institutional owners through heavy
 
01:39:04.030 --> 01:39:04.040 align:start position:0%
taxation while lawmakers in Nebraska
 
01:39:06.709 --> 01:39:06.719 align:start position:0%
Iowa New York Minnesota and North
 
01:39:08.709 --> 01:39:08.719 align:start position:0%

Carolina are among those proposing
similar

01:39:09.589 --> 01:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
similar
 
01:39:12.149 --> 01:39:12.159 align:start position:0%
laws Republican Governor Greg Abbott
 
01:39:14.350 --> 01:39:14.360 align:start position:0%
addressed this issue recently stating
 
01:39:16.270 --> 01:39:16.280 align:start position:0%
this corporate large-scale buying of
 
01:39:18.270 --> 01:39:18.280 align:start position:0%
residential homes seems to be distorting
 
01:39:20.310 --> 01:39:20.320 align:start position:0%
the market and making it harder for the
 
01:39:22.669 --> 01:39:22.679 align:start position:0%
average Texan to purchase a home this
 
01:39:25.109 --> 01:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
must be added to the legislative agenda
 
01:39:27.910 --> 01:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
to protect Texas families the bottom
 
01:39:29.629 --> 01:39:29.639 align:start position:0%
line is while this bill is far from
 
01:39:31.550 --> 01:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
perfect it's undeniably true that
 
01:39:34.030 --> 01:39:34.040 align:start position:0%
corporations are creating an artificial
 
01:39:36.189 --> 01:39:36.199 align:start position:0%
barrier to home ownership for our
 
01:39:38.430 --> 01:39:38.440 align:start position:0%
Granite State families we need to be
 
01:39:40.109 --> 01:39:40.119 align:start position:0%
encouraging young people to make their
 
01:39:42.510 --> 01:39:42.520 align:start position:0%
home and raise their families here not
 
01:39:44.589 --> 01:39:44.599 align:start position:0%
allowing corporations to force our own
 
01:39:46.109 --> 01:39:46.119 align:start position:0%
people out so they can increase their
 
01:39:46.119 --> 01:39:47.310 align:start position:0%
people out so they can increase their
investment

01:39:47.310 --> 01:39:47.320 align:start position:0%
investment
 
01:39:49.910 --> 01:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
portfolios if we table this bill a floor
 
01:39:51.229 --> 01:39:51.239 align:start position:0%
Amendment will be brought before the
 
01:39:52.589 --> 01:39:52.599 align:start position:0%
body in next session to turn this
 
01:39:54.350 --> 01:39:54.360 align:start position:0%
legislation into to a study committee so
 
01:39:56.669 --> 01:39:56.679 align:start position:0%
we can find a way we can all agree on to
 
01:39:59.109 --> 01:39:59.119 align:start position:0%
stop this hostile corporate takeover and
 
01:40:00.750 --> 01:40:00.760 align:start position:0%
solve the housing crisis as granted
 
01:40:02.550 --> 01:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
Staters so desperately have asked us to
 
01:40:04.270 --> 01:40:04.280 align:start position:0%
do thank you Mr
 
01:40:07.470 --> 01:40:07.480 align:start position:0%
Speaker and I request a division vote
 
01:40:14.270 --> 01:40:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:17.629 --> 01:40:17.639 align:start position:0%
Cole thank you Mr Speaker I rise today
 
01:40:20.870 --> 01:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
in opposition of HB 623 FN an act that
 
01:40:22.510 --> 01:40:22.520 align:start position:0%
would prohibit corporations and other
 
01:40:24.709 --> 01:40:24.719 align:start position:0%
legal entities from purchasing single
 
01:40:26.510 --> 01:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
family homes for 90
 
01:40:28.430 --> 01:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
days while the intent of this
 
01:40:30.350 --> 01:40:30.360 align:start position:0%
legislation may stem from legitimate
 
01:40:32.390 --> 01:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
concerns the language in its current
 
01:40:36.270 --> 01:40:36.280 align:start position:0%
form it's unworkable it's overly Broad
 
01:40:37.870 --> 01:40:37.880 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
01:40:39.790 --> 01:40:39.800 align:start position:0%
problematic this bill does not just
 
01:40:43.229 --> 01:40:43.239 align:start position:0%
Target Corporations it encompasses all
 
01:40:49.109 --> 01:40:49.119 align:start position:0%
non-natural persons including llc's and
 
01:40:51.229 --> 01:40:51.239 align:start position:0%
nonprofits the sweeping definition
 
01:40:53.669 --> 01:40:53.679 align:start position:0%
creates unintended consequences that
 
01:40:56.310 --> 01:40:56.320 align:start position:0%
extend far beyond the Bill's stated
 
01:40:59.109 --> 01:40:59.119 align:start position:0%
purpose it would slow property
 
01:41:00.950 --> 01:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
transactions it would incentivize
 
01:41:03.669 --> 01:41:03.679 align:start position:0%
sellers to wait 90 days to outwait the
 
01:41:05.709 --> 01:41:05.719 align:start position:0%
90-day restriction period for po
 
01:41:07.750 --> 01:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
potentially higher
 
01:41:09.669 --> 01:41:09.679 align:start position:0%
offers this delay would create
 
01:41:11.990 --> 01:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
additional barriers not just for
 
01:41:14.030 --> 01:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
corporate buyers but for other buyers
 
01:41:15.870 --> 01:41:15.880 align:start position:0%
trying to enter the housing
 
01:41:18.189 --> 01:41:18.199 align:start position:0%
market furthermore the bill includes
 
01:41:21.189 --> 01:41:21.199 align:start position:0%
penalties such as cheating property to
 
01:41:24.390 --> 01:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities for violations
 
01:41:26.629 --> 01:41:26.639 align:start position:0%
however lacks The Clarity on how the
 
01:41:29.950 --> 01:41:29.960 align:start position:0%
process will be implemented or funded no
 
01:41:31.589 --> 01:41:31.599 align:start position:0%
Appropriations have been made and
 
01:41:33.470 --> 01:41:33.480 align:start position:0%
administrative burden was placed on this
 
01:41:35.510 --> 01:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
mun and municipalities this will be an
 
01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:37.310 align:start position:0%
mun and municipalities this will be an
unfunded

01:41:37.310 --> 01:41:37.320 align:start position:0%
unfunded
 
01:41:39.629 --> 01:41:39.639 align:start position:0%
mandate some argue this bill addresses
 
01:41:41.390 --> 01:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
the growing issue of corporate investors
 
01:41:43.030 --> 01:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
dominating the housing
 
01:41:45.589 --> 01:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
market pointing to antidotes and
 
01:41:45.599 --> 01:41:46.750 align:start position:0%
market pointing to antidotes and
National

01:41:46.750 --> 01:41:46.760 align:start position:0%
National
 
01:41:49.149 --> 01:41:49.159 align:start position:0%
reports let's focus on the
 
01:41:52.470 --> 01:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
facts corporations only own 3% of the
 
01:41:54.390 --> 01:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
housing market in the United States and
 
01:41:57.830 --> 01:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
less than 1 half% in New Hampshire this
 
01:42:00.310 --> 01:42:00.320 align:start position:0%
is not a widespread issue for this
 
01:42:02.790 --> 01:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
state for these reasons I urge The Bu to
 
01:42:04.750 --> 01:42:04.760 align:start position:0%
support the itl motion and I call for a
 
01:42:06.990 --> 01:42:07.000 align:start position:0%
roll call
 
01:42:09.709 --> 01:42:09.719 align:start position:0%
vote V Senate Sween has requested a roll
 
01:42:12.030 --> 01:42:12.040 align:start position:0%

01:42:14.390 --> 01:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
seconded that is sufficiently seconded
 
01:42:16.149 --> 01:42:16.159 align:start position:0%
this will be a roll call vote members
 
01:42:22.149 --> 01:42:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:22.109 --> 01:43:22.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:24.910 --> 01:43:24.920 align:start position:0%
okay the motion before us majority

legisl and House Bill 623 this is a roll
 
01:43:32.910 --> 01:43:32.920 align:start position:0%
call J recognizes represent Reed for
 
01:43:35.189 --> 01:43:35.199 align:start position:0%
parliamentary thank you Mr
 
01:43:37.910 --> 01:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker if I know that we
 
01:43:41.229 --> 01:43:41.239 align:start position:0%
have reached the point where over a
 
01:43:44.189 --> 01:43:44.199 align:start position:0%
third of single family rentals are
 
01:43:45.950 --> 01:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
corporate owned not owned by small
 
01:43:48.310 --> 01:43:48.320 align:start position:0%
landlords based in the state but owned
 
01:43:50.109 --> 01:43:50.119 align:start position:0%
by large investment
 
01:43:52.629 --> 01:43:52.639 align:start position:0%
firms and if I know that these large
 
01:43:54.109 --> 01:43:54.119 align:start position:0%
investment firms they're not the
 
01:43:54.119 --> 01:43:55.070 align:start position:0%
investment firms they're not the
friendly

01:43:55.070 --> 01:43:55.080 align:start position:0%
friendly
 
01:43:58.350 --> 01:43:58.360 align:start position:0%
landlords that we think of in this state
 
01:44:00.510 --> 01:44:00.520 align:start position:0%
but that they are actually driving the
 
01:44:03.350 --> 01:44:03.360 align:start position:0%
increase in our unaffordability in this
 
01:44:05.750 --> 01:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
state with this NeverEnding cycle of
 
01:44:08.470 --> 01:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
buying properties well over market value
 
01:44:10.149 --> 01:44:10.159 align:start position:0%
because then they can raise the rent
 
01:44:12.870 --> 01:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
which increases the value and then they
 
01:44:14.950 --> 01:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
buy another property for even more than
 
01:44:18.390 --> 01:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
that driving our unaffordability
 
01:44:22.790 --> 01:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
and if I know that the market the free
 
01:44:24.669 --> 01:44:24.679 align:start position:0%
market Market in housing or anything
 
01:44:27.550 --> 01:44:27.560 align:start position:0%
else only works when supply and demand
 
01:44:30.310 --> 01:44:30.320 align:start position:0%
are both free to come and negotiate
 
01:44:32.189 --> 01:44:32.199 align:start position:0%
unencumbered but then when you have
 
01:44:35.189 --> 01:44:35.199 align:start position:0%
people who have to live in a place that
 
01:44:36.589 --> 01:44:36.599 align:start position:0%
they are coming to that table with their
 
01:44:38.430 --> 01:44:38.440 align:start position:0%
hands tied behind their back they can't
 
01:44:41.270 --> 01:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
go homeless they have to accept whatever
 
01:44:43.750 --> 01:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
they're being
 
01:44:47.830 --> 01:44:47.840 align:start position:0%
given and lastly well second to last if
 
01:44:50.510 --> 01:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
I Mr Speaker am really tired of the
 
01:44:53.070 --> 01:44:53.080 align:start position:0%
sacred cow that has gone unchallenged
 
01:44:56.189 --> 01:44:56.199 align:start position:0%
for decades that anything in the name of
 
01:45:00.750 --> 01:45:00.760 align:start position:0%
greed is good even while our religions
 
01:45:03.189 --> 01:45:03.199 align:start position:0%
our ethics our morals and our logic
 
01:45:05.070 --> 01:45:05.080 align:start position:0%
dictate the exact
 
01:45:09.229 --> 01:45:09.239 align:start position:0%
opposite and lastly Mr Speaker if I know
 
01:45:11.430 --> 01:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
that if the itail is overturned there is
 
01:45:13.510 --> 01:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
an amendment to just make this a study
 
01:45:16.030 --> 01:45:16.040 align:start position:0%
committee because can't we at least
 
01:45:18.669 --> 01:45:18.679 align:start position:0%
study this that's happening with the
 
01:45:20.629 --> 01:45:20.639 align:start position:0%
corporate gobbling up of our single
 
01:45:23.709 --> 01:45:23.719 align:start position:0%
family homes and driving up costs
 
01:45:27.350 --> 01:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
then would I press the red
 
01:45:29.830 --> 01:45:29.840 align:start position:0%
button and overturn the itl so that we
 
01:45:32.589 --> 01:45:32.599 align:start position:0%
can at least study this chair recognize
 
01:45:39.109 --> 01:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:41.270 --> 01:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
inlo thank you Mr
 
01:45:44.830 --> 01:45:44.840 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker if I know this bill
 
01:45:46.950 --> 01:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
interferes with a homeowner's right to
 
01:45:49.390 --> 01:45:49.400 align:start position:0%
sell their home to a willing buyer on
 
01:45:53.030 --> 01:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
mutually agreed terms and if I know this
 
01:45:54.830 --> 01:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
bill would take private property away
 
01:45:57.030 --> 01:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
from small investors who own their
 
01:46:00.109 --> 01:46:00.119 align:start position:0%
property through llc's or even local
 
01:46:02.669 --> 01:46:02.679 align:start position:0%
nonprofit organizations that offer their
 
01:46:05.629 --> 01:46:05.639 align:start position:0%
own housing and if I know this bill
 
01:46:07.589 --> 01:46:07.599 align:start position:0%
would require the Secretary of State to
 
01:46:10.109 --> 01:46:10.119 align:start position:0%
establish an expensive and cumbersome
 
01:46:12.510 --> 01:46:12.520 align:start position:0%
registration system that adds a new
 
01:46:15.430 --> 01:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
layer of red tape to single family and
 
01:46:17.870 --> 01:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
multif family housing development and if
 
01:46:21.149 --> 01:46:21.159 align:start position:0%
I know that ultimately this socialist
 
01:46:23.550 --> 01:46:23.560 align:start position:0%
bill would do nothing
 
01:46:26.709 --> 01:46:26.719 align:start position:0%
to fix our housing shortage actually
 
01:46:29.669 --> 01:46:29.679 align:start position:0%
make it worse by stifling investment in
 
01:46:32.149 --> 01:46:32.159 align:start position:0%
new and renovative places for the people
 
01:46:34.629 --> 01:46:34.639 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire to live would I now
 
01:46:37.109 --> 01:46:37.119 align:start position:0%
press the green button to support the
 
01:46:38.870 --> 01:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
committee's majority report of

Horgan thank you thank you very much I'm
 
03:05:47.870 --> 03:05:47.880 align:start position:0%
represent um so I'm uh speaking speak
 
03:05:49.309 --> 03:05:49.319 align:start position:0%
against the amendment I have no issue
 
03:05:51.190 --> 03:05:51.200 align:start position:0%
with the underlying Bill the original
 
03:05:53.150 --> 03:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
version is introduced I think is good
 
03:05:57.070 --> 03:05:57.080 align:start position:0%
but um so that's but we have to we have
 
03:05:58.910 --> 03:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
to overturn the amendment to get to the
 
03:06:02.870 --> 03:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
underlying bills so um up until well up
 
03:06:05.389 --> 03:06:05.399 align:start position:0%
until 2022 straford County elected its
 
03:06:06.990 --> 03:06:07.000 align:start position:0%
three County Commissioners from a single
 
03:06:09.830 --> 03:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
at large district and they or perhaps I
 
03:06:11.830 --> 03:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
should say we because I live in straford
 
03:06:13.630 --> 03:06:13.640 align:start position:0%
County so we've been doing so for many
 
03:06:16.389 --> 03:06:16.399 align:start position:0%
many years um what I've I've heard it
 
03:06:20.110 --> 03:06:20.120 align:start position:0%
was since 186 five um and some people
 
03:06:21.550 --> 03:06:21.560 align:start position:0%
think the switch to three districts was
 
03:06:23.830 --> 03:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
a good idea some think it was a bad idea
 
03:06:25.950 --> 03:06:25.960 align:start position:0%
I I'm not here to relitigate that issue
 
03:06:27.469 --> 03:06:27.479 align:start position:0%
today although
 
03:06:30.469 --> 03:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
there there will be a bill about that uh
 
03:06:32.110 --> 03:06:32.120 align:start position:0%
coming up later in the session actually
 
03:06:36.110 --> 03:06:36.120 align:start position:0%
the hearing is next week um anyway in
 
03:06:38.750 --> 03:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
2024 we an ele we had our first County
 
03:06:40.389 --> 03:06:40.399 align:start position:0%
Commissioner election with the three
 
03:06:42.670 --> 03:06:42.680 align:start position:0%
districts um including a contested
 
03:06:44.910 --> 03:06:44.920 align:start position:0%
primary on the Republican side in
 
03:06:47.630 --> 03:06:47.640 align:start position:0%
District 3 so three County Commissioners
 
03:06:49.590 --> 03:06:49.600 align:start position:0%
elected um two two new members a
 
03:06:52.750 --> 03:06:52.760 align:start position:0%
longtime incumbent and so far in the
 
03:06:54.229 --> 03:06:54.239 align:start position:0%
last month or two an office they seem to
 
03:06:57.070 --> 03:06:57.080 align:start position:0%
be an excellent group so one of the two
 
03:06:58.790 --> 03:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
new Commissioners does not live in the
 
03:07:00.910 --> 03:07:00.920 align:start position:0%
district he represents now that may seem
 
03:07:04.750 --> 03:07:04.760 align:start position:0%
a little weird but RSA 6559 the law
 
03:07:06.670 --> 03:07:06.680 align:start position:0%
which sets the qualifications for County
 
03:07:09.190 --> 03:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
Office says that's okay well at least
 
03:07:11.070 --> 03:07:11.080 align:start position:0%
currently it says it's okay and that RSA
 
03:07:12.790 --> 03:07:12.800 align:start position:0%
has been unchanged since it was created
 
03:07:12.800 --> 03:07:13.590 align:start position:0%
has been unchanged since it was created
in

03:07:13.590 --> 03:07:13.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:07:13.600 --> 03:07:15.110 align:start position:0%
in
1979

03:07:15.110 --> 03:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
1979
 
03:07:17.990 --> 03:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
and so what that law says and it's been
 
03:07:20.990 --> 03:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
the same for uh all those 50 uh since
 
03:07:24.150 --> 03:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
1979 it never been a problem says County
 
03:07:27.190 --> 03:07:27.200 align:start position:0%
C officers currently quote must have a
 
03:07:29.349 --> 03:07:29.359 align:start position:0%
domicile in the county for which he has
 
03:07:31.190 --> 03:07:31.200 align:start position:0%
chosen um obviously at some point we
 
03:07:34.750 --> 03:07:34.760 align:start position:0%
want update he to he or she or but
 
03:07:38.070 --> 03:07:38.080 align:start position:0%
unquote and additionally in a list of
 
03:07:40.670 --> 03:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
nine counties I counted them there are
 
03:07:43.309 --> 03:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
nine which are not in any really
 
03:07:45.070 --> 03:07:45.080 align:start position:0%
discernable order you must have a
 
03:07:47.150 --> 03:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
domicile in your District so you know
 
03:07:47.160 --> 03:07:48.030 align:start position:0%
domicile in your District so you know
it's

03:07:48.030 --> 03:07:48.040 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:07:49.630 --> 03:07:49.640 align:start position:0%
that's pretty simple I could probably
 
03:07:51.070 --> 03:07:51.080 align:start position:0%
think of ways to make it simpler but
 
03:07:52.670 --> 03:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
that's like simple and straightforward
 
03:07:53.870 --> 03:07:53.880 align:start position:0%
and it it
 
03:07:56.950 --> 03:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
works anyway for whatever reason to get
 
03:08:00.469 --> 03:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
back to uh last year the previous
 
03:08:02.990 --> 03:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
election the enabling legislation passed
 
03:08:03.000 --> 03:08:03.910 align:start position:0%
election the enabling legislation passed
in

03:08:03.910 --> 03:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:08:06.349 --> 03:08:06.359 align:start position:0%
20123 which created the three districts
 
03:08:08.070 --> 03:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
which were voted on in
 
03:08:10.870 --> 03:08:10.880 align:start position:0%
2024 did not change RSA
 
03:08:14.670 --> 03:08:14.680 align:start position:0%
6559 and I I the member will suspend
 
03:08:14.680 --> 03:08:16.190 align:start position:0%
6559 and I I the member will suspend
yeah

03:08:16.190 --> 03:08:16.200 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:08:19.110 --> 03:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
yeah the member has a right to be heard
 
03:08:21.870 --> 03:08:21.880 align:start position:0%
and it's getting awful noisy okay well
 
03:08:24.190 --> 03:08:24.200 align:start position:0%
thank you member May I've dealt with
 
03:08:28.229 --> 03:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
Worth's noise but um anyway so in 2023
 
03:08:29.750 --> 03:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason when we created the
 
03:08:31.190 --> 03:08:31.200 align:start position:0%
three County Commissioner districts and
 
03:08:32.750 --> 03:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
made the other changes for some reason
 
03:08:35.590 --> 03:08:35.600 align:start position:0%
they skipped over RSA
 
03:08:38.710 --> 03:08:38.720 align:start position:0%
6559 and so as a result in straford
 
03:08:40.830 --> 03:08:40.840 align:start position:0%
County we now have districts but you
 
03:08:42.790 --> 03:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
don't have the live in your district and
 
03:08:45.229 --> 03:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
as I said that seems weird but in voter
 
03:08:47.550 --> 03:08:47.560 align:start position:0%
District 3 not the district I live in I
 
03:08:50.110 --> 03:08:50.120 align:start position:0%
live in District Two but District 3 the
 
03:08:52.429 --> 03:08:52.439 align:start position:0%
voters chose a person who lives in
 
03:08:54.950 --> 03:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
District Two and um so they seem to be
 
03:08:56.750 --> 03:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
happy with their with their choice I
 
03:08:59.590 --> 03:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
think they made a good choice um anyway
 
03:09:01.990 --> 03:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
I thought that admission was deliberate
 
03:09:04.309 --> 03:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
but turn turned out um shortly after the
 
03:09:07.190 --> 03:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
filing period in June 2024 that it fact
 
03:09:10.229 --> 03:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
had been a mistake and there was a bit
 
03:09:12.389 --> 03:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
of a Ruckus at the ballot law commission
 
03:09:14.429 --> 03:09:14.439 align:start position:0%
but the law clearly said you know that
 
03:09:16.229 --> 03:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
the law that straford County was not on
 
03:09:18.750 --> 03:09:18.760 align:start position:0%
that list of count counties that if you
 
03:09:20.670 --> 03:09:20.680 align:start position:0%
counted all the counties there were only
 
03:09:22.630 --> 03:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
nine and straford County was the 10th
 
03:09:24.590 --> 03:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
County so that's a little embarrassing
 
03:09:27.309 --> 03:09:27.319 align:start position:0%
although I mean worked okay people at
 
03:09:29.790 --> 03:09:29.800 align:start position:0%
District three have a competent County
 
03:09:31.710 --> 03:09:31.720 align:start position:0%
Commissioner representing
 
03:09:35.150 --> 03:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
them so anyway the bill is introduced
 
03:09:37.110 --> 03:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
would have taken a rather logical and
 
03:09:38.670 --> 03:09:38.680 align:start position:0%
simple approach probably about the
 
03:09:41.030 --> 03:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
simplest approach possible by simply
 
03:09:43.429 --> 03:09:43.439 align:start position:0%
adding and straford at the end of that
 
03:09:45.790 --> 03:09:45.800 align:start position:0%
list of counties and so that list now
 
03:09:48.389 --> 03:09:48.399 align:start position:0%
includes all 10 counties I count it
 
03:09:50.790 --> 03:09:50.800 align:start position:0%
again yes there are there are 10
 
03:09:52.910 --> 03:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
counties no counties are repeated it's
 
03:09:56.070 --> 03:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
all 10 counties um it left the domicile
 
03:09:57.670 --> 03:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
requirement in place and this seemed
 
03:09:59.070 --> 03:09:59.080 align:start position:0%
like a very simple
 
03:10:01.630 --> 03:10:01.640 align:start position:0%
solution the amendment changes rather
 
03:10:05.229 --> 03:10:05.239 align:start position:0%
simple Doon RSA 659 with some very wordy
 
03:10:06.950 --> 03:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
language which I think would have all
 
03:10:09.389 --> 03:10:09.399 align:start position:0%
sorts of unintended consequences so
 
03:10:13.070 --> 03:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
that's uh that's why and uh you can you
 
03:10:14.309 --> 03:10:14.319 align:start position:0%
can see what the language is for
 
03:10:16.389 --> 03:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
yourself um it's on in the calendar
 
03:10:17.870 --> 03:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
actually in two places on the committee
 
03:10:20.550 --> 03:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
report and also on the uh Amendment
 
03:10:22.190 --> 03:10:22.200 align:start position:0%
which if I recall correctly is on page
 
03:10:22.200 --> 03:10:23.870 align:start position:0%
which if I recall correctly is on page
28

03:10:23.870 --> 03:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
28
 
03:10:26.790 --> 03:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
um so regardless of how you feel about
 
03:10:30.030 --> 03:10:30.040 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill so I I urge you to
 
03:10:32.349 --> 03:10:32.359 align:start position:0%
uh reject the amendment and go back to
 
03:10:34.229 --> 03:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
the original bill is introduced which in
 
03:10:36.070 --> 03:10:36.080 align:start position:0%
my opinion is a much better solution to
 
03:10:38.510 --> 03:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
it so I thank you for your
 
03:10:40.510 --> 03:10:40.520 align:start position:0%
attention and I I would take any
 
03:10:41.910 --> 03:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
questions if anyone had one but I don't
 
03:10:43.790 --> 03:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
think anybody wants wants to ask them
 
03:10:45.030 --> 03:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
but anyway thank you for your attention
 
03:10:47.349 --> 03:10:47.359 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr Speaker
 
03:10:52.429 --> 03:10:52.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:55.830 --> 03:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr Speaker I rise in
 
03:10:57.870 --> 03:10:57.880 align:start position:0%
support of amendment
 
03:11:00.190 --> 03:11:00.200 align:start position:0%
0034 to House Bill
 
03:11:03.429 --> 03:11:03.439 align:start position:0%
75 this simple and straightforward
 
03:11:06.790 --> 03:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
Amendment does three things first it
 
03:11:09.590 --> 03:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
clarifies the requirements for County
 
03:11:12.590 --> 03:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
offices secondly it strengthens the
 
03:11:14.990 --> 03:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
existence existing residency
 
03:11:17.910 --> 03:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
requirements for County Commissioners
 
03:11:20.349 --> 03:11:20.359 align:start position:0%
by clearly stating that a commissioner
 
03:11:21.710 --> 03:11:21.720 align:start position:0%
must be an
 
03:11:25.070 --> 03:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
inhabitant who resides actually and
 
03:11:27.710 --> 03:11:27.720 align:start position:0%
permanently in the County District for
 
03:11:31.190 --> 03:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
which they are elected to represent
 
03:11:34.349 --> 03:11:34.359 align:start position:0%
lastly the amendment further makes it
 
03:11:37.550 --> 03:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
clear than that an elected County
 
03:11:41.150 --> 03:11:41.160 align:start position:0%
official shall cease to hold office if
 
03:11:43.750 --> 03:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
they move out of the county or District
 
03:11:46.870 --> 03:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
they represent for these reasons I urge
 
03:11:49.870 --> 03:11:49.880 align:start position:0%
my fellow colleagues to support these
 
03:11:51.349 --> 03:11:51.359 align:start position:0%

03:15:23.349 --> 03:15:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:25.870 --> 03:15:25.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker I rise today in
 
03:15:29.269 --> 03:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
opposition to hb110 hb110 creates an
 
03:15:31.790 --> 03:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
unnecessary revolving account we
 
03:15:33.349 --> 03:15:33.359 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that budgeting for
 
03:15:34.870 --> 03:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
representative we haven't done the
 
03:15:37.830 --> 03:15:37.840 align:start position:0%
amendment yet oh
 
03:15:40.309 --> 03:15:40.319 align:start position:0%
sorry the amendment is
 
03:15:43.710 --> 03:15:43.720 align:start position:0%
0057 H printed in house record 10 pages
 
03:15:46.469 --> 03:15:46.479 align:start position:0%
29 through 30 the vote are you ready for
 
03:15:47.830 --> 03:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
the question on the amendment all those
 
03:15:50.710 --> 03:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
in favor say I I those oppose nay the
 
03:15:52.150 --> 03:15:52.160 align:start position:0%
eyes have it and the amendment is
 
03:15:58.070 --> 03:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:02.309 --> 03:16:02.319 align:start position:0%
one thank you Mr Speaker appreciate that
 
03:16:04.510 --> 03:16:04.520 align:start position:0%
so HB 110 creates an unnecessary
 
03:16:06.630 --> 03:16:06.640 align:start position:0%
revolving account we acknowledge that
 
03:16:08.830 --> 03:16:08.840 align:start position:0%
budgeting sa Safety Services is
 
03:16:11.150 --> 03:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
difficult to predict we heard testimony
 
03:16:12.630 --> 03:16:12.640 align:start position:0%
from a sheriff that they attempt to
 
03:16:14.790 --> 03:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
budget for additional traffic detail by
 
03:16:17.550 --> 03:16:17.560 align:start position:0%
including larger expense projections the
 
03:16:19.630 --> 03:16:19.640 align:start position:0%
concern is that this raises taxes is
 
03:16:22.349 --> 03:16:22.359 align:start position:0%
inaccurate because revenue from details
 
03:16:25.590 --> 03:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
offsets expenses resulting in a net zero
 
03:16:28.110 --> 03:16:28.120 align:start position:0%
impact on the budget if the department
 
03:16:30.189 --> 03:16:30.199 align:start position:0%
is not making money on work detail they
 
03:16:33.110 --> 03:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
should reassess the rates charged
 
03:16:34.990 --> 03:16:35.000 align:start position:0%
establishing a revolving fund requires
 
03:16:36.830 --> 03:16:36.840 align:start position:0%
seed money this would come from an
 
03:16:39.630 --> 03:16:39.640 align:start position:0%
increase in taxes to establish the fund
 
03:16:41.469 --> 03:16:41.479 align:start position:0%
the bill allows the fund to accumulate
 
03:16:42.830 --> 03:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
from year to year with revenues
 
03:16:45.070 --> 03:16:45.080 align:start position:0%
transferring to the general fund when
 
03:16:47.750 --> 03:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
the revenues exceed the original balance
 
03:16:49.469 --> 03:16:49.479 align:start position:0%
constant transfers between the revolving
 
03:16:51.189 --> 03:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
fund and the general fund would
 
03:16:53.550 --> 03:16:53.560 align:start position:0%
complicate financial management this
 
03:16:56.309 --> 03:16:56.319 align:start position:0%
creates excess work duplicating existing
 
03:16:58.510 --> 03:16:58.520 align:start position:0%
procedures at the end of the fiscal year
 
03:17:00.150 --> 03:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
when excess Revenue would normally be
 
03:17:02.910 --> 03:17:02.920 align:start position:0%
transferred to the general fund there is
 
03:17:05.349 --> 03:17:05.359 align:start position:0%
also concern that tracking expenses such
 
03:17:08.110 --> 03:17:08.120 align:start position:0%
as net vehicle maintenance equipment
 
03:17:10.590 --> 03:17:10.600 align:start position:0%
wear and tear and insurance costs would
 
03:17:13.550 --> 03:17:13.560 align:start position:0%
become more complex if these costs
 
03:17:15.349 --> 03:17:15.359 align:start position:0%
remain in the general fund but revenues
 
03:17:17.189 --> 03:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
are diverted it inflates the budget
 
03:17:18.990 --> 03:17:19.000 align:start position:0%
without a clear offsetting Revenue
 
03:17:21.590 --> 03:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
Source Revenue should not be realized at
 
03:17:25.030 --> 03:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
the time of year end audit what are the
 
03:17:27.150 --> 03:17:27.160 align:start position:0%
Alternatives if a department experience
 
03:17:29.830 --> 03:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
is a busier than exper expected year
 
03:17:31.710 --> 03:17:31.720 align:start position:0%
they can request an increase from the
 
03:17:33.710 --> 03:17:33.720 align:start position:0%
delegation rather than relying on the
 
03:17:36.070 --> 03:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
revolving fund the delegation could also
 
03:17:37.830 --> 03:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
pass a resolution allowing the sheriff
 
03:17:40.229 --> 03:17:40.239 align:start position:0%
to exceed the line item by a set amount
 
03:17:42.389 --> 03:17:42.399 align:start position:0%
as long as the revenue covers additional
 
03:17:44.550 --> 03:17:44.560 align:start position:0%
expenses as budget transfers and
 
03:17:46.189 --> 03:17:46.199 align:start position:0%
resolutions would be reconciled each
 
03:17:47.950 --> 03:17:47.960 align:start position:0%
year there there is already an existing
 
03:17:49.590 --> 03:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
approach to solve the problem does not
 
03:17:52.469 --> 03:17:52.479 align:start position:0%
add cost to the taxpayers in conclusion
 
03:17:55.189 --> 03:17:55.199 align:start position:0%
hb110 is unnecessary and would create
 
03:17:57.150 --> 03:17:57.160 align:start position:0%
additional challenges by for County
 
03:17:59.070 --> 03:17:59.080 align:start position:0%
staff by increasing administrative
 
03:18:00.990 --> 03:18:01.000 align:start position:0%
burdens without providing a real
 
03:18:03.510 --> 03:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
solution existing budget processes
 
03:18:05.150 --> 03:18:05.160 align:start position:0%
already allow counties to manage
 
03:18:07.110 --> 03:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
Sheriff's Department detail work
 
03:18:09.870 --> 03:18:09.880 align:start position:0%
effectively without recurring a separate
 
03:18:12.269 --> 03:18:12.279 align:start position:0%
revolving fund and Mr Speaker I ask for
 
03:18:14.670 --> 03:18:14.680 align:start position:0%
a division
 
03:18:17.710 --> 03:18:17.720 align:start position:0%

03:18:26.349 --> 03:18:26.359 align:start position:0%
McDonald thank you Mr Speaker hb110 is
 
03:18:28.550 --> 03:18:28.560 align:start position:0%
amended is a very simple Common Sense
 
03:18:30.870 --> 03:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
enabling bill for our County government
 
03:18:32.429 --> 03:18:32.439 align:start position:0%
it would allow by a vote of the county
 
03:18:35.229 --> 03:18:35.239 align:start position:0%
delegation to establish a County public
 
03:18:37.030 --> 03:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
safety revolving fund to support the
 
03:18:39.150 --> 03:18:39.160 align:start position:0%
payment of County Employees within our
 
03:18:41.790 --> 03:18:41.800 align:start position:0%
Sheriff's Office the revolving fund
 
03:18:43.389 --> 03:18:43.399 align:start position:0%
would be used to pay work outside of the
 
03:18:46.150 --> 03:18:46.160 align:start position:0%
ordinary daily duties of the deputies it
 
03:18:47.950 --> 03:18:47.960 align:start position:0%
will be used for employee payment for
 
03:18:50.229 --> 03:18:50.239 align:start position:0%
special events construction details and
 
03:18:52.429 --> 03:18:52.439 align:start position:0%
other Public Safety purposes deemed
 
03:18:54.670 --> 03:18:54.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate by the sheriff the amount of
 
03:18:56.269 --> 03:18:56.279 align:start position:0%
the fund to start the public safety
 
03:18:58.630 --> 03:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
evolving fund would be determined by the
 
03:19:00.870 --> 03:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
delegation any Revenue received from the
 
03:19:03.389 --> 03:19:03.399 align:start position:0%
extra activities or Services supported
 
03:19:05.550 --> 03:19:05.560 align:start position:0%
by the fund would be used to replenish
 
03:19:08.389 --> 03:19:08.399 align:start position:0%
the fund in the event of revolving fund
 
03:19:10.030 --> 03:19:10.040 align:start position:0%
exceeds the original funding used to
 
03:19:12.309 --> 03:19:12.319 align:start position:0%
establish the fund the excess money will
 
03:19:13.990 --> 03:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
be deposited into the county general
 
03:19:16.830 --> 03:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
fund um the county delegation can also
 
03:19:18.870 --> 03:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
Place limitations on expenditures from
 
03:19:21.790 --> 03:19:21.800 align:start position:0%
the public safety fund no money from the
 
03:19:23.510 --> 03:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
fund may be used for anything the
 
03:19:26.269 --> 03:19:26.279 align:start position:0%
delegation has specifically rejected and
 
03:19:27.590 --> 03:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
also the county treasur will be the
 
03:19:29.870 --> 03:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
custodian of the fund uh the folks
 
03:19:31.670 --> 03:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
that'll make the decision to uh take
 
03:19:33.429 --> 03:19:33.439 align:start position:0%
money of the fund will be the County
 
03:19:35.910 --> 03:19:35.920 align:start position:0%
Commissioners in conclusion the majority
 
03:19:37.510 --> 03:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
believes the public safety revolving
 
03:19:39.750 --> 03:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
fund will be as successful as the
 
03:19:41.349 --> 03:19:41.359 align:start position:0%
established Municipal revolving funds
 
03:19:42.910 --> 03:19:42.920 align:start position:0%

03:21:06.550 --> 03:21:06.560 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
03:21:09.030 --> 03:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
this bill appears to be unnecessary as
 
03:21:10.750 --> 03:21:10.760 align:start position:0%
the issue it seeks to address could be
 
03:21:12.309 --> 03:21:12.319 align:start position:0%
resolved through proper budgeting
 
03:21:14.389 --> 03:21:14.399 align:start position:0%
without imposing additional cost to
 
03:21:16.710 --> 03:21:16.720 align:start position:0%
taxpayers if I know implementing this
 
03:21:18.750 --> 03:21:18.760 align:start position:0%
bill would require initial seed money
 
03:21:20.189 --> 03:21:20.199 align:start position:0%
which would directly impact the county
 
03:21:22.389 --> 03:21:22.399 align:start position:0%
budget through taxation I would have
 
03:21:24.950 --> 03:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
serious concerns if I know this bill
 
03:21:26.950 --> 03:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
creates lack of transparency and
 
03:21:28.750 --> 03:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
accountability I would be deeply
 
03:21:30.309 --> 03:21:30.319 align:start position:0%
concerned about the potential for
 
03:21:32.910 --> 03:21:32.920 align:start position:0%
mismanagement given these factors would
 
03:21:34.950 --> 03:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
I vote no and press the red button at
 
03:21:38.070 --> 03:21:38.080 align:start position:0%

parliamentary inquiry thank you Mr

Speaker Mr Speaker if I know the public
 
03:21:47.150 --> 03:21:47.160 align:start position:0%
safety revolving funds are extremely
 
03:21:48.750 --> 03:21:48.760 align:start position:0%
successful in many New Hampshire
 
03:21:51.110 --> 03:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
communities and municipalities further
 
03:21:53.790 --> 03:21:53.800 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know the public safety
 
03:21:57.429 --> 03:21:57.439 align:start position:0%
revolving Huns will save taxpayers money
 
03:21:59.830 --> 03:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
lastly Mr Speaker if I know there are
 
03:22:01.750 --> 03:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
sufficient safeguards in the bill
 
03:22:03.510 --> 03:22:03.520 align:start position:0%

03:25:03.630 --> 03:25:03.640 align:start position:0%
Kaplan thank you Mr Speaker and uh hello
 
03:25:07.389 --> 03:25:07.399 align:start position:0%
colleagues HB 106 is a very simple bill
 
03:25:09.030 --> 03:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
there's been some misunderstandings
 
03:25:11.110 --> 03:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
about it there's been the claim that it
 
03:25:13.110 --> 03:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
intends to Target a particular class of
 
03:25:15.469 --> 03:25:15.479 align:start position:0%
business which it does not that's not
 
03:25:18.510 --> 03:25:18.520 align:start position:0%
how commissions work work HP 106 intends
 
03:25:22.429 --> 03:25:22.439 align:start position:0%
to set up a a bipartisan commission to
 
03:25:24.790 --> 03:25:24.800 align:start position:0%
made up of uh legislators
 
03:25:26.990 --> 03:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
representatives of business and industry
 
03:25:30.710 --> 03:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
department heads Etc to study two things
 
03:25:33.790 --> 03:25:33.800 align:start position:0%
the financial cost of impending climate
 
03:25:35.469 --> 03:25:35.479 align:start position:0%
damage on the state of New Hampshire and
 
03:25:38.429 --> 03:25:38.439 align:start position:0%
number two the best way to pay for the
 
03:25:40.070 --> 03:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
adaptation work that we need in order to
 
03:25:42.550 --> 03:25:42.560 align:start position:0%
minimize the risk of our communities to
 
03:25:42.560 --> 03:25:43.750 align:start position:0%
minimize the risk of our communities to
climate

03:25:43.750 --> 03:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
climate
 
03:25:46.590 --> 03:25:46.600 align:start position:0%
damage so this bill is premised on the
 
03:25:48.349 --> 03:25:48.359 align:start position:0%
warnings we've been receiving from the
 
03:25:50.990 --> 03:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
science Community for decades now on the
 
03:25:53.269 --> 03:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
risk of burning fossil fuels to our
 
03:25:56.550 --> 03:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
climate the science is unequivocal and
 
03:25:58.070 --> 03:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
the evidence points to these changes
 
03:26:00.150 --> 03:26:00.160 align:start position:0%
which we can see with our own
 
03:26:02.590 --> 03:26:02.600 align:start position:0%
eyes increased coastal flooding on our
 
03:26:05.630 --> 03:26:05.640 align:start position:0%
Sea Coast shorter Winters impacting on
 
03:26:08.349 --> 03:26:08.359 align:start position:0%
our tourism industry hotter Summers with
 
03:26:10.630 --> 03:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
cyano bacteria
 
03:26:12.910 --> 03:26:12.920 align:start position:0%
blooms with increased rain events
 
03:26:15.630 --> 03:26:15.640 align:start position:0%
washing out our roads uh increased
 
03:26:17.750 --> 03:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
tickborne mosquito born illnesses we all
 
03:26:19.150 --> 03:26:19.160 align:start position:0%
know these things are happening and the
 
03:26:21.269 --> 03:26:21.279 align:start position:0%
science is quite clear the more the
 
03:26:23.630 --> 03:26:23.640 align:start position:0%
atmosphere warms the greater impact
 
03:26:25.070 --> 03:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
these changes will
 
03:26:27.389 --> 03:26:27.399 align:start position:0%
have for instance we know with great
 
03:26:29.150 --> 03:26:29.160 align:start position:0%
certainty based on the science that
 
03:26:31.429 --> 03:26:31.439 align:start position:0%
there will be an increase in extreme
 
03:26:33.830 --> 03:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
weather events in the coming decades we
 
03:26:35.189 --> 03:26:35.199 align:start position:0%
also know for certain that our
 
03:26:38.389 --> 03:26:38.399 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is not in shape to handle
 
03:26:40.630 --> 03:26:40.640 align:start position:0%
those stresses for instance in our in
 
03:26:41.630 --> 03:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
our committee we heard from the
 
03:26:43.349 --> 03:26:43.359 align:start position:0%
Department environmental service Dam
 
03:26:46.510 --> 03:26:46.520 align:start position:0%
Bureau that our aging Dam infrastructure
 
03:26:48.830 --> 03:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
uh needs $900 million in order to get
 
03:26:50.429 --> 03:26:50.439 align:start position:0%
into shape that's almost a billion
 
03:26:53.110 --> 03:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
dollars just for the dams so this is not
 
03:26:55.189 --> 03:26:55.199 align:start position:0%
an irresponsible response that's try to
 
03:26:57.670 --> 03:26:57.680 align:start position:0%
set up a committee to look at this issue
 
03:27:00.389 --> 03:27:00.399 align:start position:0%
we know for instance that of the nine
 
03:27:01.950 --> 03:27:01.960 align:start position:0%
planning authorities around the state
 
03:27:04.750 --> 03:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
several are looking at climate change
 
03:27:06.630 --> 03:27:06.640 align:start position:0%
and studying the ways to pay for the
 
03:27:08.309 --> 03:27:08.319 align:start position:0%
adaptation and resilience work which
 
03:27:10.070 --> 03:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
they have identified we know the
 
03:27:11.950 --> 03:27:11.960 align:start position:0%
department of environmental service is
 
03:27:14.710 --> 03:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
aware of this issue what is needed is
 
03:27:16.670 --> 03:27:16.680 align:start position:0%
take a coordinated look at this issue
 
03:27:18.830 --> 03:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
and that that's what this commission can
 
03:27:23.189 --> 03:27:23.199 align:start position:0%
provide so why is this not a good idea
 
03:27:25.550 --> 03:27:25.560 align:start position:0%
well you can doubt the need for a study
 
03:27:27.670 --> 03:27:27.680 align:start position:0%
based on doubting the the changes that
 
03:27:29.469 --> 03:27:29.479 align:start position:0%
are happening and that has to do with
 
03:27:31.269 --> 03:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
some of the contrarian opinions that we
 
03:27:33.590 --> 03:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
heard in our Committee hearing and that
 
03:27:35.189 --> 03:27:35.199 align:start position:0%
by the way is the Playbook that the
 
03:27:36.830 --> 03:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel industry has employed for
 
03:27:39.269 --> 03:27:39.279 align:start position:0%
the last several decades to Forstall any
 
03:27:41.229 --> 03:27:41.239 align:start position:0%
action that might hurt their business
 
03:27:43.150 --> 03:27:43.160 align:start position:0%
model despite hearing from their own
 
03:27:46.389 --> 03:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
scientists as early as 1970s that
 
03:27:48.550 --> 03:27:48.560 align:start position:0%
burning their product would impact the
 
03:27:50.510 --> 03:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
climate in dangerous ways they went on
 
03:27:53.550 --> 03:27:53.560 align:start position:0%
to spread propaganda and bad science in
 
03:27:56.750 --> 03:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
order to cast doubt and uh ensure that
 
03:27:59.349 --> 03:27:59.359 align:start position:0%
nothing ever happened so for instance in
 
03:28:01.309 --> 03:28:01.319 align:start position:0%
our committee we had a man come in
 
03:28:03.469 --> 03:28:03.479 align:start position:0%
claimed he was a toxicologist stressed
 
03:28:06.269 --> 03:28:06.279 align:start position:0%
his professional expertise several times
 
03:28:07.750 --> 03:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh but one thing he said really caught
 
03:28:09.070 --> 03:28:09.080 align:start position:0%
my ear and that's when he said it would
 
03:28:10.990 --> 03:28:11.000 align:start position:0%
be futile that was the word he used it
 
03:28:13.590 --> 03:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
would be futile to try to quantify the
 
03:28:15.469 --> 03:28:15.479 align:start position:0%
impact of carbon dioxide in the
 
03:28:17.309 --> 03:28:17.319 align:start position:0%
atmosphere now if there's one thing I
 
03:28:19.150 --> 03:28:19.160 align:start position:0%
know about science and scientists is
 
03:28:22.150 --> 03:28:22.160 align:start position:0%
that they will quantify the kneecap on a
 
03:28:23.870 --> 03:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
grasshopper for years and years that
 
03:28:25.429 --> 03:28:25.439 align:start position:0%
they think it's going to add to the body
 
03:28:27.590 --> 03:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
of knowledge so that was a red flag
 
03:28:30.389 --> 03:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
right away and as far as carbon dioxide
 
03:28:31.550 --> 03:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
in the atmosphere well that's something
 
03:28:32.910 --> 03:28:32.920 align:start position:0%
I learned about in school it's called
 
03:28:35.389 --> 03:28:35.399 align:start position:0%
the greenhouse effect it's what makes
 
03:28:37.309 --> 03:28:37.319 align:start position:0%
life possible on the planet it's the
 
03:28:39.510 --> 03:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
fact that yes carbon dioxide is a very
 
03:28:42.309 --> 03:28:42.319 align:start position:0%
small infinitesimally small part of the
 
03:28:44.830 --> 03:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
atmosphere but it's one of the few gases
 
03:28:46.630 --> 03:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
that absorbs heat so all you need is
 
03:28:49.030 --> 03:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
just a little bit and it keeps the heat
 
03:28:50.870 --> 03:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
that wants to escape back to outer space
 
03:28:52.910 --> 03:28:52.920 align:start position:0%
it keeps the heat inside the atmosphere
 
03:28:55.110 --> 03:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
is what makes life possible problem is
 
03:28:56.630 --> 03:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
we keep adding more and more carbon
 
03:28:59.469 --> 03:28:59.479 align:start position:0%
dioxide so that warming effect is int is
 
03:29:02.269 --> 03:29:02.279 align:start position:0%
increasing in intensity but uh so what
 
03:29:04.429 --> 03:29:04.439 align:start position:0%
he was saying is you could call it
 
03:29:06.070 --> 03:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
contrarian opinion but that would be a
 
03:29:07.349 --> 03:29:07.359 align:start position:0%
generous assessment it's basically
 
03:29:09.670 --> 03:29:09.680 align:start position:0%
crackpot science we had another
 
03:29:11.950 --> 03:29:11.960 align:start position:0%
gentleman come in who uh much more a
 
03:29:14.429 --> 03:29:14.439 align:start position:0%
personable very persu very persuasive
 
03:29:16.670 --> 03:29:16.680 align:start position:0%
very well spoken gentleman remind me of
 
03:29:18.110 --> 03:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
somebody else I know but that's all I'll
 
03:29:21.110 --> 03:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
say about that um he took a page out of
 
03:29:23.309 --> 03:29:23.319 align:start position:0%
the ipcc report which is good because
 
03:29:26.550 --> 03:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
the ipcc report is the gold standard for
 
03:29:29.110 --> 03:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
climate science and it's the the world's
 
03:29:31.309 --> 03:29:31.319 align:start position:0%
top CL climate scien is appointed by the
 
03:29:32.550 --> 03:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
respective governments they come
 
03:29:34.389 --> 03:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
together they study the issue and they
 
03:29:36.830 --> 03:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
issue a report every five years or so
 
03:29:39.630 --> 03:29:39.640 align:start position:0%
latest one was 3,000 or so pages long he
 
03:29:43.429 --> 03:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
had a a chart from page 2,000 or so and
 
03:29:45.349 --> 03:29:45.359 align:start position:0%
uh it purported to show time of
 
03:29:48.389 --> 03:29:48.399 align:start position:0%
emergence on climate risks I went look
 
03:29:50.309 --> 03:29:50.319 align:start position:0%
time of emergence is a relatively new
 
03:29:52.150 --> 03:29:52.160 align:start position:0%
branch of climate science that tries to
 
03:29:54.229 --> 03:29:54.239 align:start position:0%
show when these climate risks emerge
 
03:29:57.110 --> 03:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
from the natural variability problem is
 
03:29:59.110 --> 03:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
the natural variability is measured by
 
03:30:01.269 --> 03:30:01.279 align:start position:0%
historical data which is very lacking in
 
03:30:02.670 --> 03:30:02.680 align:start position:0%
lots of parts of the world there's not a
 
03:30:05.269 --> 03:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
lot of historical data in Africa or Asia
 
03:30:07.670 --> 03:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
or Latin America so the level of
 
03:30:10.150 --> 03:30:10.160 align:start position:0%
certainty around time of emergence is
 
03:30:12.630 --> 03:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
very low and so that's what this chart
 
03:30:15.229 --> 03:30:15.239 align:start position:0%
showed and so he said see the the ipcc
 
03:30:17.510 --> 03:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
has very low level of certainty on these
 
03:30:19.750 --> 03:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
climate risks which is exactly the
 
03:30:21.830 --> 03:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
opposite conclusion that the entire
 
03:30:24.389 --> 03:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
3,000 page report is intended to convey
 
03:30:25.950 --> 03:30:25.960 align:start position:0%
so it was very cherry-picked very
 
03:30:28.429 --> 03:30:28.439 align:start position:0%
selective very cynical yet it had its
 
03:30:30.790 --> 03:30:30.800 align:start position:0%
effect the doubt was cast we heard in
 
03:30:32.790 --> 03:30:32.800 align:start position:0%
our committee that hey you know up could
 
03:30:34.590 --> 03:30:34.600 align:start position:0%
be down down could be up it could be
 
03:30:36.790 --> 03:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
back it could be forth we don't know all
 
03:30:39.110 --> 03:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
opinions are equally valid therefore the
 
03:30:41.110 --> 03:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
proper course of action is to take no
 
03:30:43.950 --> 03:30:43.960 align:start position:0%
action so and I and we we had a quote
 
03:30:46.309 --> 03:30:46.319 align:start position:0%
from I think it was the poet TS Elliot
 
03:30:49.030 --> 03:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
the famous uh climate poet TS Elliott
 
03:30:51.269 --> 03:30:51.279 align:start position:0%
who said reality is very hard it's too
 
03:30:53.189 --> 03:30:53.199 align:start position:0%
hard to discern for the ordinary human
 
03:30:55.630 --> 03:30:55.640 align:start position:0%
being well I agree with that reality is
 
03:30:57.790 --> 03:30:57.800 align:start position:0%
too hard to discern for Orin human
 
03:31:00.630 --> 03:31:00.640 align:start position:0%
beings that's why we have the science
 
03:31:03.870 --> 03:31:03.880 align:start position:0%
they are our eyes and ears and as
 
03:31:06.590 --> 03:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
Leaders as policy makers we count on the
 
03:31:09.150 --> 03:31:09.160 align:start position:0%
science we take the consensus opinion we
 
03:31:10.630 --> 03:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
take the weight of the evidence and we
 
03:31:13.389 --> 03:31:13.399 align:start position:0%
CH a path forward for our constituents
 
03:31:16.070 --> 03:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
that's why these uh contrarian crackpot
 
03:31:18.990 --> 03:31:19.000 align:start position:0%
opinions are no excuse and inaction is
 
03:31:20.550 --> 03:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
not an
 
03:31:24.630 --> 03:31:24.640 align:start position:0%
option this bill HB 106 is basically us
 
03:31:26.790 --> 03:31:26.800 align:start position:0%
taking a walk to the top of a hill to
 
03:31:28.990 --> 03:31:29.000 align:start position:0%
see what is coming if you don't want to
 
03:31:30.750 --> 03:31:30.760 align:start position:0%
take a walk to the top of a hill I would
 
03:31:32.590 --> 03:31:32.600 align:start position:0%
suggest you get out of the way and let
 
03:31:36.710 --> 03:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:36.720 --> 03:31:38.349 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:31:38.349 --> 03:31:38.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:31:41.349 --> 03:31:41.359 align:start position:0%
so I would suggest that we vote red on
 
03:31:43.750 --> 03:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
this itl and move up the hill to a
 
03:31:46.309 --> 03:31:46.319 align:start position:0%
better motion thank you Mr Speaker and I
 
03:31:48.110 --> 03:31:48.120 align:start position:0%
call for a roll call vote
 
03:31:55.750 --> 03:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:58.389 --> 03:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you Mr
 
03:32:02.309 --> 03:32:02.319 align:start position:0%
Speaker uh Mr Speaker this bill is based
 
03:32:05.429 --> 03:32:05.439 align:start position:0%
on a premise that is flawed and is under
 
03:32:08.269 --> 03:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
dispute we did hear expert
 
03:32:13.229 --> 03:32:13.239 align:start position:0%
testimony as to various reasons why um
 
03:32:17.030 --> 03:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
climate change is still up for debate we
 
03:32:19.990 --> 03:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
should not be putting we should not be
 
03:32:23.670 --> 03:32:23.680 align:start position:0%
putting um speculative premises into
 
03:32:26.510 --> 03:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
statute the house will be in
 
03:32:29.429 --> 03:32:29.439 align:start position:0%
order but the real problem with this
 
03:32:33.790 --> 03:32:33.800 align:start position:0%
bill because of the premise is a
 
03:32:37.910 --> 03:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
commission in statute actually
 
03:32:43.550 --> 03:32:43.560 align:start position:0%
blames a one class of of um business
 
03:32:47.269 --> 03:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel companies for damages that
 
03:32:50.070 --> 03:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
have yet to been that have have yet to
 
03:32:52.389 --> 03:32:52.399 align:start position:0%
occur and a predicting of what they
 
03:32:54.630 --> 03:32:54.640 align:start position:0%
might occur in in the
 
03:32:58.710 --> 03:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
future and it says that these fossil
 
03:33:02.950 --> 03:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
fuel companies will be will be charged
 
03:33:06.110 --> 03:33:06.120 align:start position:0%
not if or what will be charged now you
 
03:33:08.950 --> 03:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
can imagine the the potential lawsuits
 
03:33:11.910 --> 03:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
involved with this bill company a says
 
03:33:15.030 --> 03:33:15.040 align:start position:0%
wasn't my fossil fuel fumes that caused
 
03:33:17.269 --> 03:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
this uh crop damage it was company C
 
03:33:20.510 --> 03:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
over here the company C might say oh no
 
03:33:22.389 --> 03:33:22.399 align:start position:0%
it wasn't mine mine didn't get over
 
03:33:24.030 --> 03:33:24.040 align:start position:0%
there uh it must have been coming over
 
03:33:26.510 --> 03:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
from Canada or maybe over from from New
 
03:33:29.790 --> 03:33:29.800 align:start position:0%
York this opens up a lot of bad
 
03:33:32.510 --> 03:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
litigation on
 
03:33:34.670 --> 03:33:34.680 align:start position:0%
this and I'm going to end this by just
 
03:33:37.349 --> 03:33:37.359 align:start position:0%
saying this because this bill if you
 
03:33:40.469 --> 03:33:40.479 align:start position:0%
read it actually says
 
03:33:43.990 --> 03:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
that fossil fuel companies are to blame
 
03:33:48.550 --> 03:33:48.560 align:start position:0%
and will pay this bill almost puts just
 
03:33:49.950 --> 03:33:49.960 align:start position:0%
about puts into question a
 
03:33:53.990 --> 03:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
constitutional issue of guilty without
 
03:33:57.429 --> 03:33:57.439 align:start position:0%
due process so I would rather not go
 
03:33:59.750 --> 03:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
down that route I think this is a
 
03:34:01.790 --> 03:34:01.800 align:start position:0%
dangerous Bill the way it's written
 
03:34:05.189 --> 03:34:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:07.670 --> 03:34:07.680 align:start position:0%
itl representative Kaplan has requested
 
03:34:11.229 --> 03:34:11.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:13.630 --> 03:34:13.640 align:start position:0%
seconded it is sufficiently seconded
 
03:34:15.229 --> 03:34:15.239 align:start position:0%
this will be a roll call vote members
 
03:35:05.990 --> 03:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:06.000 --> 03:35:16.269 align:start position:0%
 
C

03:35:16.269 --> 03:35:16.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:18.030 --> 03:35:18.040 align:start position:0%
the motion before us majority committee
 
03:35:20.110 --> 03:35:20.120 align:start position:0%
report of inexpedient to
 
03:35:23.590 --> 03:35:23.600 align:start position:0%
legislate this is a roll call vote chair
 
03:35:25.070 --> 03:35:25.080 align:start position:0%
recognizer absent of Kaplan for a
 
03:35:25.080 --> 03:35:29.910 align:start position:0%
recognizer absent of Kaplan for a
parliamentary

03:35:29.910 --> 03:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:33.710 --> 03:35:33.720 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
03:35:35.469 --> 03:35:35.479 align:start position:0%
that this bill sets up a study
 
03:35:39.349 --> 03:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
commission and in no way conveys any
 
03:35:41.790 --> 03:35:41.800 align:start position:0%
language that targets any particular
 
03:35:43.790 --> 03:35:43.800 align:start position:0%
business and that a study commission
 
03:35:45.830 --> 03:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
works by consensus and collaboration and
 
03:35:48.229 --> 03:35:48.239 align:start position:0%
hears from experts on any
 
03:35:50.990 --> 03:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
issue before reaching any conclusion or
 
03:35:54.110 --> 03:35:54.120 align:start position:0%
making any recommendations if I know
 
03:35:57.750 --> 03:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
that not to prepare is to prepare to
 
03:36:00.830 --> 03:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
fail and lastly Mr Speaker if I know
 
03:36:03.750 --> 03:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
that 70% of Granite State voters want
 
03:36:05.590 --> 03:36:05.600 align:start position:0%
their government that would be us to do
 
03:36:07.790 --> 03:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
something about this issue which is upon
 
03:36:12.469 --> 03:36:12.479 align:start position:0%
us what I now vote red Mr Speaker if I
 
03:36:14.349 --> 03:36:14.359 align:start position:0%
know that suing big oil is very
 
03:36:16.349 --> 03:36:16.359 align:start position:0%
expensive costing Millions of taxpayer
 
03:36:18.110 --> 03:36:18.120 align:start position:0%
dollars and that previous attempts have
 
03:36:18.120 --> 03:36:19.070 align:start position:0%
dollars and that previous attempts have
been

03:36:19.070 --> 03:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
been
 
03:36:21.229 --> 03:36:21.239 align:start position:0%
unsuccessful and if I further know that
 
03:36:22.229 --> 03:36:22.239 align:start position:0%
the position of the current
 
03:36:25.229 --> 03:36:25.239 align:start position:0%
Administration is drill baby drill then
 
03:36:27.229 --> 03:36:27.239 align:start position:0%
would I now press the big green button
 
03:36:28.990 --> 03:36:29.000 align:start position:0%
to let the federal government and other
 
03:36:31.590 --> 03:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
states with deeper Pockets lead the way
 
03:36:31.600 --> 03:36:32.309 align:start position:0%
states with deeper Pockets lead the way

H and is recognized to uh
 
03:39:46.349 --> 03:39:46.359 align:start position:0%
speak everybody following
 
03:39:48.429 --> 03:39:48.439 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon thank you Mr
 
03:39:50.670 --> 03:39:50.680 align:start position:0%
Speaker okay let me try and explain this
 
03:39:54.870 --> 03:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
one to you um HB 189 is essentially a
 
03:39:57.349 --> 03:39:57.359 align:start position:0%
housekeeping Bill except for the changes
 
03:39:59.510 --> 03:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
adopted by the amendment that we just
 
03:40:04.070 --> 03:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
voted on um the amendment inserts a
 
03:40:06.910 --> 03:40:06.920 align:start position:0%
definition of the words clean energy
 
03:40:08.870 --> 03:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
into the statutory
 
03:40:11.349 --> 03:40:11.359 align:start position:0%
construction that redefines a
 
03:40:13.950 --> 03:40:13.960 align:start position:0%
well-defined term to include low
 
03:40:17.110 --> 03:40:17.120 align:start position:0%
emissions sources
 
03:40:19.590 --> 03:40:19.600 align:start position:0%
uh the bill started with a desire to
 
03:40:21.950 --> 03:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
include nuclear power in the state
 
03:40:25.590 --> 03:40:25.600 align:start position:0%
energy statutes and uh under the clean
 
03:40:27.750 --> 03:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
energy definition that would be put into
 
03:40:30.710 --> 03:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
the statutory language um no one on the
 
03:40:32.710 --> 03:40:32.720 align:start position:0%
science technology and energy uh
 
03:40:35.309 --> 03:40:35.319 align:start position:0%
committee argued that nuclear power
 
03:40:38.469 --> 03:40:38.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't qualify as a clean energy source
 
03:40:41.269 --> 03:40:41.279 align:start position:0%
when nuclear plants run they do not emit
 
03:40:44.429 --> 03:40:44.439 align:start position:0%
pollutants or greenhouse gases and that
 
03:40:45.830 --> 03:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
is the accept
 
03:40:48.229 --> 03:40:48.239 align:start position:0%
definition of clean
 
03:40:50.910 --> 03:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
energy but once we agreed that we should
 
03:40:52.910 --> 03:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
Define the term in the broadest possible
 
03:40:55.630 --> 03:40:55.640 align:start position:0%
sense rather than identifying individual
 
03:40:58.710 --> 03:40:58.720 align:start position:0%
energy sources in the definition we went
 
03:41:01.990 --> 03:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
off to lunch and it devolved into
 
03:41:03.790 --> 03:41:03.800 align:start position:0%
Reinventing the wheel people started
 
03:41:06.510 --> 03:41:06.520 align:start position:0%
word smithing so the definition that we
 
03:41:11.870 --> 03:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
have now as I said includes low emitting
 
03:41:16.469 --> 03:41:16.479 align:start position:0%
sources um we have a choice this morning
 
03:41:18.550 --> 03:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
as to how we want to approach the
 
03:41:21.150 --> 03:41:21.160 align:start position:0%
state's definition of clean energy you
 
03:41:23.990 --> 03:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
can accept the amendment before you
 
03:41:25.710 --> 03:41:25.720 align:start position:0%
which redefines the meaning of clean
 
03:41:28.229 --> 03:41:28.239 align:start position:0%
energy to include sources that emit
 
03:41:30.030 --> 03:41:30.040 align:start position:0%
pollutants and greenhouse gases when
 
03:41:32.790 --> 03:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
they operate or you can review the
 
03:41:34.710 --> 03:41:34.720 align:start position:0%
single sentence floor amendment in your
 
03:41:37.309 --> 03:41:37.319 align:start position:0%
seat pockets that's
 
03:41:41.110 --> 03:41:41.120 align:start position:0%
0246 H which is listed up here um which
 
03:41:43.950 --> 03:41:43.960 align:start position:0%
uses the American Association for the
 
03:41:46.630 --> 03:41:46.640 align:start position:0%
advancement of Sciences is definition of
 
03:41:46.640 --> 03:41:47.750 align:start position:0%
advancement of Sciences is definition of
clean

03:41:47.750 --> 03:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
clean
 
03:41:51.309 --> 03:41:51.319 align:start position:0%
energy um the accepted meaning is clean
 
03:41:53.469 --> 03:41:53.479 align:start position:0%
energy is an energy source that does not
 
03:41:56.110 --> 03:41:56.120 align:start position:0%
release pollutants or greenhouse gases
 
03:42:00.149 --> 03:42:00.159 align:start position:0%
during use it's clear it's simple and
 
03:42:01.510 --> 03:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
it's widely
 
03:42:05.189 --> 03:42:05.199 align:start position:0%
accepted I ask for your no vote on the
 
03:42:07.710 --> 03:42:07.720 align:start position:0%
original well it's too late the that
 
03:42:09.189 --> 03:42:09.199 align:start position:0%
ought to pass uh on the committee
 
03:42:11.670 --> 03:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
Amendment already went through I ask
 
03:42:14.429 --> 03:42:14.439 align:start position:0%
that you uh pass this amendment so that
 
03:42:16.990 --> 03:42:17.000 align:start position:0%
we can send an accurate definition
 
03:42:18.910 --> 03:42:18.920 align:start position:0%
across the wall rather than having them
 
03:42:23.389 --> 03:42:23.399 align:start position:0%
try to repair our inaccurate definition
 
03:42:25.469 --> 03:42:25.479 align:start position:0%
um and I ask that we have a roll call
 
03:42:27.670 --> 03:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
vote on that we should be able to send
 
03:42:33.349 --> 03:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:36.110 --> 03:42:36.120 align:start position:0%
you representative V is recognized speak
 
03:42:39.189 --> 03:42:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:41.990 --> 03:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment colleagues I urge you to vote
 
03:42:43.670 --> 03:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
against this floor Amendment for two
 
03:42:43.680 --> 03:42:45.590 align:start position:0%
against this floor Amendment for two
reasons

03:42:45.590 --> 03:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
03:42:48.750 --> 03:42:48.760 align:start position:0%
number one the original Bill
 
03:42:50.950 --> 03:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
explicitly added nuclear to the
 
03:42:53.510 --> 03:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
definition of clean energy this
 
03:42:57.189 --> 03:42:57.199 align:start position:0%
amendment makes no mention of nuclear it
 
03:42:59.710 --> 03:42:59.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't exclude nuclear but we think
 
03:43:02.790 --> 03:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
it's important to explicitly include
 
03:43:05.630 --> 03:43:05.640 align:start position:0%
nuclear in the definition of clean
 
03:43:08.149 --> 03:43:08.159 align:start position:0%
energy the other reason to oppose this
 
03:43:11.510 --> 03:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
amendment is in the committee Amendment
 
03:43:14.110 --> 03:43:14.120 align:start position:0%
we very consciously and purposefully
 
03:43:16.910 --> 03:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
chose the term low
 
03:43:20.349 --> 03:43:20.359 align:start position:0%
emitting as opposed to non-emitting
 
03:43:23.070 --> 03:43:23.080 align:start position:0%
because we didn't want to exclude
 
03:43:25.910 --> 03:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
certain kinds of renewable energy for
 
03:43:25.920 --> 03:43:26.830 align:start position:0%
certain kinds of renewable energy for
example

03:43:26.830 --> 03:43:26.840 align:start position:0%
example
 
03:43:30.229 --> 03:43:30.239 align:start position:0%
windmills large windmills wind
 
03:43:33.030 --> 03:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
turbines frequently use a diesel motor
 
03:43:36.349 --> 03:43:36.359 align:start position:0%
to start them because the blades are so
 
03:43:38.710 --> 03:43:38.720 align:start position:0%
heavy that the wind can't start them on
 
03:43:40.389 --> 03:43:40.399 align:start position:0%
its own so you have to have a diesel
 
03:43:43.269 --> 03:43:43.279 align:start position:0%
motor to start those turbines in
 
03:43:45.830 --> 03:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
addition those turbines if they're in a
 
03:43:48.229 --> 03:43:48.239 align:start position:0%
cold weather environment like New
 
03:43:50.990 --> 03:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they need a source of
 
03:43:54.110 --> 03:43:54.120 align:start position:0%
heat so the diesel motor in the wind
 
03:43:57.469 --> 03:43:57.479 align:start position:0%
turbine can provide that source of heat
 
03:43:58.710 --> 03:43:58.720 align:start position:0%
but it is an
 
03:43:58.720 --> 03:44:00.349 align:start position:0%
but it is an
emitting

03:44:00.349 --> 03:44:00.359 align:start position:0%
emitting
 
03:44:02.710 --> 03:44:02.720 align:start position:0%
Technologies but it's a low emitting
 
03:44:05.630 --> 03:44:05.640 align:start position:0%
technology and the windmill is mostly a
 
03:44:08.630 --> 03:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
renewable non emitting
 
03:44:13.389 --> 03:44:13.399 align:start position:0%
technology in addition to that some uh
 
03:44:15.830 --> 03:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
effort is being made to to
 
03:44:18.950 --> 03:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
create hydrogen as a form of
 
03:44:21.030 --> 03:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
energy it's not really but that's a
 
03:44:22.349 --> 03:44:22.359 align:start position:0%
subject for another
 
03:44:25.910 --> 03:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
day but the techniques used to create
 
03:44:27.950 --> 03:44:27.960 align:start position:0%
hydrogen are
 
03:44:31.550 --> 03:44:31.560 align:start position:0%
frequently either using natural gas or
 
03:44:34.550 --> 03:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
using Renewables like solar to create
 
03:44:37.309 --> 03:44:37.319 align:start position:0%
hydrogen well if you use natural gas
 
03:44:40.630 --> 03:44:40.640 align:start position:0%
that's a an emitting source so in this
 
03:44:43.229 --> 03:44:43.239 align:start position:0%
definition in this
 
03:44:45.790 --> 03:44:45.800 align:start position:0%
amendment of non-emitting
 
03:44:48.389 --> 03:44:48.399 align:start position:0%
of clean energy
 
03:44:51.710 --> 03:44:51.720 align:start position:0%
a emitting Source like natural gas to
 
03:44:55.590 --> 03:44:55.600 align:start position:0%
create hydrogen would mean that hydrogen
 
03:44:58.349 --> 03:44:58.359 align:start position:0%
is not clean energy so for those reasons
 
03:45:00.469 --> 03:45:00.479 align:start position:0%
we think this amendment is not a good
 
03:45:04.389 --> 03:45:04.399 align:start position:0%
one and we would urge you to vote uh red
 
03:45:07.030 --> 03:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
on the adoption of this amendment thank
 
03:45:09.389 --> 03:45:09.399 align:start position:0%
you does the member yield for a
 
03:45:09.399 --> 03:45:10.990 align:start position:0%
you does the member yield for a
question

03:45:10.990 --> 03:45:11.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:45:13.149 --> 03:45:13.159 align:start position:0%
yes representative Harrington you may
 
03:45:15.110 --> 03:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
inquire thank you Mr speaker thank you
 
03:45:17.229 --> 03:45:17.239 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh representative
 
03:45:19.349 --> 03:45:19.359 align:start position:0%
would you agree that this amendment as
 
03:45:21.309 --> 03:45:21.319 align:start position:0%
written would specifically exclude
 
03:45:23.269 --> 03:45:23.279 align:start position:0%
nuclear power because in order to
 
03:45:25.550 --> 03:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
operate a nuclear power plant must run
 
03:45:28.830 --> 03:45:28.840 align:start position:0%
its diesel generators every 30 days is a
 
03:45:30.950 --> 03:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
condition for continued operation those
 
03:45:32.590 --> 03:45:32.600 align:start position:0%
are polluting they pollute obviously
 
03:45:34.149 --> 03:45:34.159 align:start position:0%
they would be considered low polluting
 
03:45:35.349 --> 03:45:35.359 align:start position:0%
because they don't run that often but
 
03:45:37.630 --> 03:45:37.640 align:start position:0%
under this amendment no nuclear power
 
03:45:39.870 --> 03:45:39.880 align:start position:0%
plant uh in New Hampshire or basically
 
03:45:42.750 --> 03:45:42.760 align:start position:0%
any place else would qualify as clean
 
03:45:42.760 --> 03:45:46.149 align:start position:0%
any place else would qualify as clean
energy

03:45:46.149 --> 03:45:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:48.349 --> 03:45:48.359 align:start position:0%
yes I would agree to that and it falls
 
03:45:50.510 --> 03:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
under the same has the same problem as
 
03:45:53.790 --> 03:45:53.800 align:start position:0%
the wind turbines so thank you for
 
03:45:56.910 --> 03:45:56.920 align:start position:0%
that representative MC McGee requested a
 
03:45:59.469 --> 03:45:59.479 align:start position:0%
roll call is that sufficiently
 
03:46:01.950 --> 03:46:01.960 align:start position:0%
seconded it is officially seconded this
 
03:46:03.670 --> 03:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
will be a roll call vote members take
 
03:46:03.680 --> 03:46:13.910 align:start position:0%
will be a roll call vote members take
your

03:46:13.910 --> 03:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:57.670 --> 03:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:59.830 --> 03:46:59.840 align:start position:0%
the the questions on the adoption of
 
03:47:00.950 --> 03:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
floor Amendment
 
03:47:04.389 --> 03:47:04.399 align:start position:0%
0246 H this is a roll call
 
03:47:06.830 --> 03:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
vote representative McGee is recognized
 
03:47:10.309 --> 03:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
for parliamentary inquiry thank you Mr
 
03:47:13.030 --> 03:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
Speaker um while I respect my colleague
 
03:47:16.389 --> 03:47:16.399 align:start position:0%
and his position uh as spoke against uh

know thank you colleagues it's I'm
 
03:47:32.269 --> 03:47:32.279 align:start position:0%
tired if I know that um that the
 
03:47:35.030 --> 03:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
definition is the only piece of this
 
03:47:39.189 --> 03:47:39.199 align:start position:0%
bill that is in question and if the
 
03:47:41.309 --> 03:47:41.319 align:start position:0%
accepted definition if I know that the
 
03:47:43.830 --> 03:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
accepted definition from the American
 
03:47:45.550 --> 03:47:45.560 align:start position:0%
Association for the the advancement of
 
03:47:48.630 --> 03:47:48.640 align:start position:0%
Sciences has defined clean energy as
 
03:47:50.349 --> 03:47:50.359 align:start position:0%
energy sources that do not release
 
03:47:52.349 --> 03:47:52.359 align:start position:0%
pollutants and greenhouse gases during
 
03:47:54.710 --> 03:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
use and that is what is used in the
 
03:47:58.229 --> 03:47:58.239 align:start position:0%
amendment then would I now press the
 
03:48:00.870 --> 03:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
green button to pass the amendment so
 
03:48:03.269 --> 03:48:03.279 align:start position:0%
that we can send a clean definition of
 
03:48:05.469 --> 03:48:05.479 align:start position:0%
clean energy over to the other side of
 
03:48:07.110 --> 03:48:07.120 align:start position:0%

Speaker Mr Speaker if I know that this
 
03:48:18.750 --> 03:48:18.760 align:start position:0%
amend M would exclude nuclear energy
 
03:48:20.750 --> 03:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
from the definition of clean energy
 
03:48:22.870 --> 03:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
which is the exact opposite of what this
 
03:48:25.349 --> 03:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
bill was intended to do when I now press

Speaker uh as I as I mentioned
 
03:50:09.590 --> 03:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
colleagues um the definition that's
 
03:50:14.910 --> 03:50:14.920 align:start position:0%
currently in uh hb89 as amended does
 
03:50:14.920 --> 03:50:16.550 align:start position:0%
currently in uh hb89 as amended does
include

03:50:16.550 --> 03:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
include
 
03:50:22.229 --> 03:50:22.239 align:start position:0%
non uh non-clean sources and um and why
 
03:50:25.070 --> 03:50:25.080 align:start position:0%
would we need the term clean energy if
 
03:50:27.110 --> 03:50:27.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to include sources that do
 
03:50:29.229 --> 03:50:29.239 align:start position:0%
not meet that definition I would ask
 
03:50:30.910 --> 03:50:30.920 align:start position:0%
that you vote against the
 
03:50:35.030 --> 03:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
OTA um and I would hope that if this
 
03:50:37.070 --> 03:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
definition is going to be adopted that
 
03:50:39.910 --> 03:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
we we are able to come to an agreement
 
03:50:41.469 --> 03:50:41.479 align:start position:0%
on our committee and put it somewhere
 
03:50:43.429 --> 03:50:43.439 align:start position:0%
else we have plenty of bills pending
 
03:50:45.389 --> 03:50:45.399 align:start position:0%
that we could amend this to
 
03:50:47.030 --> 03:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
but um I just don't want to see us
 
03:50:48.429 --> 03:50:48.439 align:start position:0%
passing a definition that is really
 
03:50:50.349 --> 03:50:50.359 align:start position:0%
non-standard and that shouldn't be in
 
03:50:53.950 --> 03:50:53.960 align:start position:0%

Speaker if I know that there is nothing
 
03:53:02.110 --> 03:53:02.120 align:start position:0%
about the definition of clean energy
 
03:53:04.590 --> 03:53:04.600 align:start position:0%
that excludes nuclear power and I would
 
03:53:07.110 --> 03:53:07.120 align:start position:0%
like people to understand that there is
 
03:53:09.950 --> 03:53:09.960 align:start position:0%
no attempt to exclude nuclear power from
 
03:53:13.229 --> 03:53:13.239 align:start position:0%
clean energy and if I know that this
 
03:53:15.870 --> 03:53:15.880 align:start position:0%
bill creat creates a definition of clean
 
03:53:18.590 --> 03:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
energy that is non accepted in the World
 
03:53:20.110 --> 03:53:20.120 align:start position:0%
At Large and there is no reason for New

Hampshire to have its own specific
 
03:53:25.189 --> 03:53:25.199 align:start position:0%
definition that was designed at lunch by

people who have an opinion when there is
 
03:53:31.149 --> 03:53:31.159 align:start position:0%

agree with the majority Report with the
 
04:01:56.189 --> 04:01:56.199 align:start position:0%

committee representative Miller's

04:02:11.309 --> 04:02:11.319 align:start position:0%
report thank you Mr Speaker uh as a
 
04:02:12.830 --> 04:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
first-term representative I had the Good
 
04:02:14.510 --> 04:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
Fortune to participate in our new
 
04:02:16.269 --> 04:02:16.279 align:start position:0%
legislator orientation just a couple
 
04:02:18.510 --> 04:02:18.520 align:start position:0%
weeks ago and one of the things we one
 
04:02:19.910 --> 04:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
of the sessions we had was about what
 
04:02:22.149 --> 04:02:22.159 align:start position:0%
makes a good bill and we were given
 
04:02:24.590 --> 04:02:24.600 align:start position:0%
three guidelines to work from that it is
 
04:02:26.030 --> 04:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
a value to the residents of New
 
04:02:28.269 --> 04:02:28.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that it is coherently CL
 
04:02:30.070 --> 04:02:30.080 align:start position:0%
crafted with penalties and enforcement
 
04:02:32.070 --> 04:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
appropriately specified and that it is
 
04:02:35.149 --> 04:02:35.159 align:start position:0%
fiscally responsible this bill fails on
 
04:02:37.710 --> 04:02:37.720 align:start position:0%
all three of those metrics the number of
 
04:02:38.950 --> 04:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
people who are residents in the state
 
04:02:41.030 --> 04:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
without changing their licensees limited
 
04:02:42.309 --> 04:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
their presence does not present any
 
04:02:43.990 --> 04:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
hardships to the state and and their
 
04:02:45.349 --> 04:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
identity and qualifications to operate
 
04:02:46.790 --> 04:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles remains confirmed by
 
04:02:49.110 --> 04:02:49.120 align:start position:0%
their existing license the majority
 
04:02:50.910 --> 04:02:50.920 align:start position:0%
committee report states that quote this
 
04:02:53.070 --> 04:02:53.080 align:start position:0%
bill requires new residents to transfer
 
04:02:54.710 --> 04:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
their out ofate driver's licenses to a
 
04:02:56.750 --> 04:02:56.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's driver's license end
 
04:03:01.070 --> 04:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
quote it does not do that RSA 263
 
04:03:03.710 --> 04:03:03.720 align:start position:0%
chapter 35 does that it is already the
 
04:03:05.950 --> 04:03:05.960 align:start position:0%
law and already has defined enforcement
 
04:03:05.960 --> 04:03:06.790 align:start position:0%
law and already has defined enforcement
and

04:03:06.790 --> 04:03:06.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:03:08.630 --> 04:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
penalties speaking of enforcement and
 
04:03:10.349 --> 04:03:10.359 align:start position:0%
penalties this bill does not bring any
 
04:03:12.910 --> 04:03:12.920 align:start position:0%
to bear at best this bill simply creates
 
04:03:14.429 --> 04:03:14.439 align:start position:0%
a lot of paperwork
 
04:03:16.469 --> 04:03:16.479 align:start position:0%
there are rumors that some enforcement
 
04:03:18.670 --> 04:03:18.680 align:start position:0%
details may follow in a second Bill if
 
04:03:20.070 --> 04:03:20.080 align:start position:0%
the sponsors want enforcement or
 
04:03:21.469 --> 04:03:21.479 align:start position:0%
penalties that should be included as
 
04:03:23.309 --> 04:03:23.319 align:start position:0%
part of the initial conversation not
 
04:03:25.710 --> 04:03:25.720 align:start position:0%
split out it is inappropriate to create
 
04:03:27.670 --> 04:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
additional regulatory structure without
 
04:03:29.149 --> 04:03:29.159 align:start position:0%
details on how it will be used nor
 
04:03:31.830 --> 04:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
certainty that it will be used finally
 
04:03:33.590 --> 04:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
the proposed legislation imposes
 
04:03:35.429 --> 04:03:35.439 align:start position:0%
unfunded new costs on the department of
 
04:03:37.630 --> 04:03:37.640 align:start position:0%
safety as we Face reduced Revenue
 
04:03:39.630 --> 04:03:39.640 align:start position:0%
forecasts it is incumbent upon us to act
 
04:03:41.670 --> 04:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
responsibly with the funds of the state
 
04:03:43.309 --> 04:03:43.319 align:start position:0%
not to approve unfunded mandates that
 
04:03:46.269 --> 04:03:46.279 align:start position:0%
burden constituents I you to join me in
 
04:03:48.550 --> 04:03:48.560 align:start position:0%
opposing the OTP motion by pressing the
 
04:03:49.950 --> 04:03:49.960 align:start position:0%
red button to vote no and request a
 
04:03:52.030 --> 04:03:52.040 align:start position:0%

you representative PR recognized speak
 
04:03:57.790 --> 04:03:57.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:00.030 --> 04:04:00.040 align:start position:0%
report thank you Mr
 
04:04:02.750 --> 04:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker existing Law requires
 
04:04:03.990 --> 04:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
new residents of New Hampshire to
 
04:04:05.349 --> 04:04:05.359 align:start position:0%
transfer their out ofate driver's
 
04:04:08.750 --> 04:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
license to New Hampshire within 60 days
 
04:04:10.149 --> 04:04:10.159 align:start position:0%
however we have evidence this is not
 
04:04:13.429 --> 04:04:13.439 align:start position:0%
being done back in 2017 the Secretary of
 
04:04:14.429 --> 04:04:14.439 align:start position:0%
State and the commissioner safety
 
04:04:15.830 --> 04:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
compared the voter database from the
 
04:04:17.750 --> 04:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
November 2016 election with the DMV
 
04:04:19.790 --> 04:04:19.800 align:start position:0%
database and issued a joint report
 
04:04:22.910 --> 04:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
stating that 6,540 individuals presented
 
04:04:24.189 --> 04:04:24.199 align:start position:0%
an out ofate driver's license while
 
04:04:26.830 --> 04:04:26.840 align:start position:0%

04:04:28.429 --> 04:04:28.439 align:start position:0%
vote
 
04:04:30.870 --> 04:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh roughly 10 months later when the
 
04:04:32.469 --> 04:04:32.479 align:start position:0%
reports were examined well beyond the
 
04:04:35.670 --> 04:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
60-day requirement of RSA 235
 
04:04:37.870 --> 04:04:37.880 align:start position:0%
26335 only
 
04:04:40.189 --> 04:04:40.199 align:start position:0%
15.5% had since received a New Hampshire
 
04:04:42.990 --> 04:04:43.000 align:start position:0%
driver's license this is it is this
 
04:04:46.349 --> 04:04:46.359 align:start position:0%
dismal 4.5% unexplained non-compliance
 
04:04:48.429 --> 04:04:48.439 align:start position:0%
rate that this bill seeks to
 
04:04:50.750 --> 04:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
address this bill attempts to address
 
04:04:53.630 --> 04:04:53.640 align:start position:0%
this issue by doing two things first it
 
04:04:55.389 --> 04:04:55.399 align:start position:0%
authorizes the sharing information on
 
04:04:57.469 --> 04:04:57.479 align:start position:0%
voters who registered with an out ofate
 
04:05:00.269 --> 04:05:00.279 align:start position:0%
driver's license on an ongoing basis so
 
04:05:03.030 --> 04:05:03.040 align:start position:0%
the DMV can send them reminder
 
04:05:05.309 --> 04:05:05.319 align:start position:0%
notices second it creates a requirement
 
04:05:07.429 --> 04:05:07.439 align:start position:0%
for an individual who does not plan to
 
04:05:09.309 --> 04:05:09.319 align:start position:0%
transfer their driver's license to
 
04:05:12.630 --> 04:05:12.640 align:start position:0%
explain why to the DMV the 2017 report
 
04:05:14.590 --> 04:05:14.600 align:start position:0%
identified a few legitimate reasons why
 
04:05:16.550 --> 04:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
this could happen such as moving back
 
04:05:18.630 --> 04:05:18.640 align:start position:0%
out of state or an elderly person who is
 
04:05:20.670 --> 04:05:20.680 align:start position:0%
giving up their driving privileges
 
04:05:22.510 --> 04:05:22.520 align:start position:0%
tracking these situations will permit
 
04:05:24.870 --> 04:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
future reports to be more
 
04:05:27.389 --> 04:05:27.399 align:start position:0%
accurate this bill is also in part a
 
04:05:30.990 --> 04:05:31.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up to 2018 House Bill
 
04:05:33.469 --> 04:05:33.479 align:start position:0%
1264 which clarified the definitions of
 
04:05:35.790 --> 04:05:35.800 align:start position:0%
domicile and residency no laws
 
04:05:37.910 --> 04:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
effectively making them the same thing
 
04:05:39.710 --> 04:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
prior to this one could in certain
 
04:05:41.630 --> 04:05:41.640 align:start position:0%
circumstances be a qualified voter
 
04:05:44.269 --> 04:05:44.279 align:start position:0%
without being subject to RSA 26
 
04:05:47.510 --> 04:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
335 this is no longer the case that law
 
04:05:49.070 --> 04:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
has twice been before the New Hampshire
 
04:05:50.750 --> 04:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court and both times the court
 
04:05:52.990 --> 04:05:53.000 align:start position:0%
has addressed the interaction between it
 
04:05:55.510 --> 04:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
and RSA 26335 is requirement to get an
 
04:05:57.830 --> 04:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
instate driver's license within 60 days
 
04:05:59.229 --> 04:05:59.239 align:start position:0%

04:06:01.830 --> 04:06:01.840 align:start position:0%

Speaker colleagues if I know that we
 
04:08:43.630 --> 04:08:43.640 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be in the business of creating
 
04:08:46.229 --> 04:08:46.239 align:start position:0%
laws to fix problems that are not
 
04:08:49.030 --> 04:08:49.040 align:start position:0%

fact a a real problem and if I know that
 
04:09:00.389 --> 04:09:00.399 align:start position:0%
when we create laws like this that
 
04:09:04.269 --> 04:09:04.279 align:start position:0%

would require it is a lot of money and
 
04:09:29.030 --> 04:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
if I finally know that this is in
 
04:09:33.269 --> 04:09:33.279 align:start position:0%

the nine counts of Selvin District 8 I
 
04:23:50.870 --> 04:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
intend these remarks to serve as a brief
 
04:23:54.309 --> 04:23:54.319 align:start position:0%
reminder of Our obligation to hear our
 
04:23:56.269 --> 04:23:56.279 align:start position:0%
constituents comments were made two
 
04:23:57.990 --> 04:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
weeks ago by a committee chair
 
04:24:00.590 --> 04:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
suggesting that online testimonies are
 
04:24:02.710 --> 04:24:02.720 align:start position:0%
of less interest and value to our work
 
04:24:04.269 --> 04:24:04.279 align:start position:0%
than in-person
 
04:24:06.469 --> 04:24:06.479 align:start position:0%
presentations the observation was made
 
04:24:08.109 --> 04:24:08.119 align:start position:0%
that organizations can efficiently
 
04:24:10.070 --> 04:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
recruit many voters to participate
 
04:24:12.389 --> 04:24:12.399 align:start position:0%
online and that somehow meant those
 
04:24:15.550 --> 04:24:15.560 align:start position:0%
those folks opinions are of less Merit
 
04:24:18.429 --> 04:24:18.439 align:start position:0%
these remarks continue to be disturbing
 
04:24:20.550 --> 04:24:20.560 align:start position:0%
many voters have expressed considerable
 
04:24:22.950 --> 04:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
distress to me and other members since
 
04:24:25.630 --> 04:24:25.640 align:start position:0%
then to quote one
 
04:24:28.469 --> 04:24:28.479 align:start position:0%
writer that testimony comes from real
 
04:24:31.349 --> 04:24:31.359 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters working people parents
 
04:24:33.750 --> 04:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
caregivers and others who simply cannot
 
04:24:35.830 --> 04:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
drop everything to drive to conquer in
 
04:24:38.429 --> 04:24:38.439 align:start position:0%
the middle of a workday public input
 
04:24:40.229 --> 04:24:40.239 align:start position:0%
should not be limited to those with the
 
04:24:42.389 --> 04:24:42.399 align:start position:0%
privilege of flexible schedules or the
 
04:24:45.030 --> 04:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
AB ility to travel many New Hampshire
 
04:24:47.750 --> 04:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
residents are balancing Jobs family
 
04:24:49.510 --> 04:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and many other
 
04:24:51.229 --> 04:24:51.239 align:start position:0%
commitments that make in-person
 
04:24:54.269 --> 04:24:54.279 align:start position:0%
attendance in conquered impractical to
 
04:24:56.950 --> 04:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
suggest that their voices matter less
 
04:24:58.910 --> 04:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
just because they cannot physically be
 
04:25:02.349 --> 04:25:02.359 align:start position:0%
in the room is both dismissive and
 
04:25:05.510 --> 04:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
undemocratic your own constituents like
 
04:25:08.830 --> 04:25:08.840 align:start position:0%
so many across the state rely on online
 
04:25:11.229 --> 04:25:11.239 align:start position:0%
testimony as one of the few accessible
 
04:25:14.630 --> 04:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
ways to engage with our government with
 
04:25:17.469 --> 04:25:17.479 align:start position:0%
us dismissing their input does them a
 
04:25:19.910 --> 04:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
disservice and undermines the Very idea
 
04:25:24.149 --> 04:25:24.159 align:start position:0%
of representative democracy end quote I
 
04:25:26.950 --> 04:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
want to assure the public that many
 
04:25:29.630 --> 04:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
hopefully most New Hampshire elected
 
04:25:31.590 --> 04:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
officials do pay attention to
 
04:25:34.510 --> 04:25:34.520 align:start position:0%
constituent Communications regardless of
 
04:25:37.309 --> 04:25:37.319 align:start position:0%

your daily lives and know it is not
 
04:25:49.870 --> 04:25:49.880 align:start position:0%
always practical to travel to conquer to
 
04:25:52.590 --> 04:25:52.600 align:start position:0%
speak personally transparency in
 
04:25:55.630 --> 04:25:55.640 align:start position:0%

04:25:59.189 --> 04:25:59.199 align:start position:0%
more than ever to that end I ask each of
 
04:26:01.389 --> 04:26:01.399 align:start position:0%
my colleagues to routinely report
 
04:26:04.109 --> 04:26:04.119 align:start position:0%
