00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you all
 
00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 align:start position:0%
for coming out I think I was just
 
00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 align:start position:0%
running alongside one of these guys
 
00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 align:start position:0%
trying to get here in time
 
00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 align:start position:0%
um let me see
 
00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 align:start position:0%
so my name is Jody Knoll I'm
 
00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 align:start position:0%
representing Cheshire four uh which is a
 
00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
little slice I haven't over there in
 
00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 align:start position:0%
Keene and I just wanted to give a quick
 
00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
introduction to this bill and I'm going
 
00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
to need to scoot off so
 
00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 align:start position:0%
um I know you have all heard a couple
 
00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
Article 5 convention calls and a
 
00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 align:start position:0%
delegate instructions Bill and so I
 
00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 align:start position:0%
really don't think I need to flesh out
 
00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 align:start position:0%
the concept I think you guys probably
 
00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:51.659 align:start position:0%
are pretty familiar with that you've
 
00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 align:start position:0%
seen as well as I have although I'm sure
 
00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
more on account of the seats you hold on
 
00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:57.739 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 align:start position:0%
plenty of emails from folks concerned
 
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
about a well-funded effort to rewrite
 
00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 align:start position:0%
the Constitution by nefarious actors
 
00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
this is a concern I'm very familiar with
 
00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:10.379 align:start position:0%
I actually got involved with this
 
00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
movement I first visited this building
 
00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 align:start position:0%
as a volunteer for an organization
 
00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 align:start position:0%
called wolf pack which is a Grassroots
 
00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 align:start position:0%
funded uh group of volunteers reading
 
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
doj ABA and CRS reports in our spare
 
00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
time and talking to legislators about
 
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
the best solution we knew of how to uh
 
00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 align:start position:0%
to address the corruption of our
 
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
democracy our issue was a corrupting
 
00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 align:start position:0%
issue of the corrupting influence of
 
00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 align:start position:0%
money in politics
 
00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
with Citizens United and all the other
 
00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 align:start position:0%
cases whose precedent it was built on
 
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
with the body directly benefiting from
 
00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 align:start position:0%
this corruption tasked with addressing
 
00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:50.759 align:start position:0%
it fixing this issue surely seemed
 
00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:52.070 align:start position:0%
it fixing this issue surely seemed
insurmountable

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
insurmountable
 
00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.139 align:start position:0%
but there is a way because the one thing
 
00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
that the Supreme Court is beholden to is
 
00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
the Constitution
 
00:16:23.629 --> 00:16:23.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:23.639 --> 00:16:25.670 align:start position:0%
 
but

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:28.860 align:start position:0%
good morning it being 9 15. I am hereby
 
00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:31.500 align:start position:0%
opening the public hearing or reopening
 
00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:34.380 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on HB 38 excuse me
 
00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:36.180 align:start position:0%
not public hearing executive session let
 
00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:37.380 align:start position:0%
me just give me a second to realize
 
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
Where We Are
 
00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:42.660 align:start position:0%
and I will recognize representative
 
00:16:46.009 --> 00:16:46.019 align:start position:0%
Rhodes for a motion
 
00:16:49.069 --> 00:16:49.079 align:start position:0%
chairman I would like to move
 
00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:58.370 --> 00:16:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:02.449 --> 00:17:02.459 align:start position:0%
representative Stone seconds our second
 
00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:04.620 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your motion
 
00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:06.540 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman just very
 
00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:10.020 align:start position:0%
briefly we've heard several bills
 
00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:10.909 align:start position:0%
briefly we've heard several bills
already

00:17:10.909 --> 00:17:10.919 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:17:10.919 --> 00:17:12.470 align:start position:0%
already
um

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:16.260 align:start position:0%
bail and or bail Commissioners and I
 
00:17:17.449 --> 00:17:17.459 align:start position:0%
think that the best thing to do right
 
00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:19.079 align:start position:0%
now is retain these and kind of put them
 
00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
together and see what we can come up
 
00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:22.370 align:start position:0%
together and see what we can come up
with

00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:22.380 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
representative Stone would you like to
 
00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
speak to you a second
 
00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:28.020 align:start position:0%
I would concur with representative
 
00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:29.330 align:start position:0%
I would concur with representative
Rhodes

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:29.340 align:start position:0%
Rhodes
 
00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:30.660 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:33.720 align:start position:0%
um I'll I'll lead off any discussion um
 
00:17:36.049 --> 00:17:36.059 align:start position:0%
by saying the following I have conferred
 
00:17:37.789 --> 00:17:37.799 align:start position:0%
with the court system I've conferred
 
00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:40.620 align:start position:0%
with our colleagues any other body
 
00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:44.220 align:start position:0%
and I have also conferred with um the
 
00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:47.580 align:start position:0%
ACLU and and several other folks who
 
00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
have testified including Professor share
 
00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
and we are working on
 
00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
um combining and several versions of
 
00:17:59.330 --> 00:17:59.340 align:start position:0%
this and we're going to retain just
 
00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:01.980 align:start position:0%
about all of these bills so that we can
 
00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
work on them over the summer the courts
 
00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
right now are very tied up with felonies
 
00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:07.980 align:start position:0%
first and we're going to defer a little
 
00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
bit to let them get their feet on the
 
00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
ground with that so that we can come in
 
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
this fall with a good version that takes
 
00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
all of these into account and covers all
 
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
the concerns addressed by these various
 
00:18:24.409 --> 00:18:24.419 align:start position:0%
bills so for anyone with concerns we're
 
00:18:24.419 --> 00:18:25.310 align:start position:0%
bills so for anyone with concerns we're
not

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
um we're not closing the door on these
 
00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:28.620 align:start position:0%
we're just holding on to them so we can
 
00:18:32.169 --> 00:18:32.179 align:start position:0%
further work on them and distill down
 
00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
a good piece of legislation that is
 
00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
going to move through both bodies and is
 
00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:40.380 align:start position:0%
going to capture all the concerns that
 
00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:41.780 align:start position:0%
everybody has with the current system
 
00:18:43.909 --> 00:18:43.919 align:start position:0%
and with that I'll open it up for any
 
00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
further comments representative Newman
 
00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
yeah I have a question the first one is
 
00:18:52.789 --> 00:18:52.799 align:start position:0%
you said all of these bills I'm assuming
 
00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
that you meant all of the bail
 
00:18:57.409 --> 00:18:57.419 align:start position:0%
type bills as opposed to all of the
 
00:18:59.510 --> 00:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
bills on
 
00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:03.660 align:start position:0%
okay as convenient as that would be no
 
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
just just wanted to make sure for a
 
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
minute maybe I was having flashbacks
 
00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:10.190 align:start position:0%
minute maybe I was having flashbacks
um

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:10.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:12.900 align:start position:0%
the other thing is would could you just
 
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
please go through what it means to
 
00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:17.460 align:start position:0%
retain a bill and what effect that has
 
00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
on next year and who gets to vote on it
 
00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:21.780 align:start position:0%
at the end of the end all of those kind
 
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
of things so that everybody understands
 
00:19:26.029 --> 00:19:26.039 align:start position:0%
what exactly retained means thank you
 
00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:28.520 align:start position:0%
that's a good idea when we retain a bill
 
00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:31.380 align:start position:0%
what it simply means is the committee
 
00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
holds on to the bill
 
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
and it's still alive available for us
 
00:19:38.029 --> 00:19:38.039 align:start position:0%
what it does basically is just gives us
 
00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:39.900 align:start position:0%
more time we have to address the bill
 
00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
this fall with either the same same
 
00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
results of an itl or not to pass it just
 
00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:47.900 align:start position:0%
gives us more time to work on the bill
 
00:19:49.789 --> 00:19:49.799 align:start position:0%
retained means we're going to hold on to
 
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
it we're going to do some more work on
 
00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:54.140 align:start position:0%
it but we still have to come to the same
 
00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
set of conclusions one way or the other
 
00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:57.720 align:start position:0%
that we would have if we would have
 
00:19:59.630 --> 00:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
acted on it right now
 
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
is that and the only follow-up I have to
 
00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
that I I don't I don't never did fully
 
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
understand what happens at the end of
 
00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
the year that if you have to act on it
 
00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
and is it the way I think it might work
 
00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
is that you vote whether it can be heard
 
00:20:20.029 --> 00:20:20.039 align:start position:0%
in the next session or whether it is has
 
00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:22.140 align:start position:0%
the motion that passes that that it
 
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't get hurt is that
 
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
um close
 
00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
um somewhat close what would happen is
 
00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:31.020 align:start position:0%
let's use this as an example let's say
 
00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:33.900 align:start position:0%
we took five bills that had to do with
 
00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:38.100 align:start position:0%
bail and we worked on one of them and
 
00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:40.980 align:start position:0%
amended it so that it encompassed pieces
 
00:20:42.529 --> 00:20:42.539 align:start position:0%
of all the other bills
 
00:20:44.289 --> 00:20:44.299 align:start position:0%
we would then
 
00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
itl the other bills the one bill that we
 
00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:49.020 align:start position:0%
have would be OTP and that would be
 
00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:53.160 align:start position:0%
taken up as as we sat again in January
 
00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:55.260 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:20:58.730 --> 00:20:58.740 align:start position:0%
any other questions or comments
 
00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:01.740 align:start position:0%
seeing none I will excuse me go ahead
 
00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
representative Muse
 
00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
and just a quick comment um all of these
 
00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:10.140 align:start position:0%
bills deal with systemic changes in the
 
00:21:12.049 --> 00:21:12.059 align:start position:0%
uh in the judicial and criminal justice
 
00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:14.340 align:start position:0%
system and
 
00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:17.460 align:start position:0%
um these changes uh tend to have tend to
 
00:21:19.909 --> 00:21:19.919 align:start position:0%
be far far ranging in terms of their
 
00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:23.780 align:start position:0%
impact they also tend to be uh not cheap
 
00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:26.820 align:start position:0%
so putting the brakes on this a little
 
00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:29.220 align:start position:0%
bit so that we can actually make a
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
better decision and have a better bill I
 
00:21:33.409 --> 00:21:33.419 align:start position:0%
think is a is a better outcome in the
 
00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
long term and and I do recognize that
 
00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:37.860 align:start position:0%
there are still some pain points that
 
00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:40.559 align:start position:0%
need to be addressed in the short term
 
00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:43.500 align:start position:0%
um but what I would what I would hope is
 
00:21:45.049 --> 00:21:45.059 align:start position:0%
that some of the testimony that we've
 
00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:47.940 align:start position:0%
heard during this bill and with some of
 
00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:51.720 align:start position:0%
the other bills would lead uh would lead
 
00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:55.620 align:start position:0%
folks to be more aware of perhaps how
 
00:21:58.010 --> 00:21:58.020 align:start position:0%
some of those pain points could be
 
00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:01.260 align:start position:0%
addressed uh in the short term to
 
00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
alleviate the situation somewhat until
 
00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
we actually have a systemic solution so
 
00:22:09.649 --> 00:22:09.659 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to say that you know we're
 
00:22:12.169 --> 00:22:12.179 align:start position:0%
we're aware of the urgency
 
00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:14.100 align:start position:0%
um but we're also aware of the need to
 
00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:16.740 align:start position:0%
pass good uh and thoughtful legislation
 
00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:18.250 align:start position:0%
pass good uh and thoughtful legislation
thanks

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:18.260 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
I would concur with everything that you
 
00:22:24.049 --> 00:22:24.059 align:start position:0%
just said I would also um add to it that
 
00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
we are going to continue working with
 
00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
all of the stakeholders in this to
 
00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
include the bail Commissioners to
 
00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:34.380 align:start position:0%
include the courts to include just about
 
00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
everyone that that has had an opinion on
 
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
it so far and I'm not going to make a
 
00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:40.980 align:start position:0%
subcommittee over this this is important
 
00:22:42.649 --> 00:22:42.659 align:start position:0%
so I intend to work on it as a full
 
00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
committee as we go along so everyone
 
00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
will have input representative Sally
 
00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:49.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I have a procedural
 
00:22:53.029 --> 00:22:53.039 align:start position:0%
question as a new representative so
 
00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:55.380 align:start position:0%
um we have I forget maybe let's say five
 
00:22:58.669 --> 00:22:58.679 align:start position:0%
bills on bail reform issues if if we're
 
00:23:00.529 --> 00:23:00.539 align:start position:0%
aware that like four of them have
 
00:23:01.789 --> 00:23:01.799 align:start position:0%
components that we think are really
 
00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
workable but one we feel is has enough
 
00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
uh misguidance that we really don't
 
00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
think it should even
 
00:23:12.649 --> 00:23:12.659 align:start position:0%
be com considered with the others how to
 
00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
how do we handle do we then vote
 
00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
I guess
 
00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:20.220 align:start position:0%
um any Bill we retain whether or not we
 
00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:22.260 align:start position:0%
feel it has Merit or not would be
 
00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:23.940 align:start position:0%
handled just as if we handled it today
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
so if at the end after we've worked on
 
00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
all these and come up with a good piece
 
00:23:30.529 --> 00:23:30.539 align:start position:0%
of legislation even the ones that have
 
00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
Merit will be itl'd in favor of the one
 
00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:35.400 align:start position:0%
that took pieces from all of the others
 
00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
and the ones that never had any Merit in
 
00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
the first place so we will just deal
 
00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
with them as if we dealt with them today
 
00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
I just don't want to I don't want to
 
00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:44.460 align:start position:0%
Telegraph uh something that I don't
 
00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:46.620 align:start position:0%
intend by italing one bill today and
 
00:23:48.649 --> 00:23:48.659 align:start position:0%
leaving the rest I want to make sure
 
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
that we look at each piece and give it a
 
00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:52.980 align:start position:0%
it's due weight because all of them do
 
00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
have expenses and do
 
00:23:57.289 --> 00:23:57.299 align:start position:0%
will affect the criminal justice system
 
00:23:59.630 --> 00:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
in the state for many years to come so I
 
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
think it's worth looking at everything
 
00:24:03.169 --> 00:24:03.179 align:start position:0%
in depth
 
00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:05.220 align:start position:0%
sure go ahead thank you Mr chairman
 
00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:07.260 align:start position:0%
representative the only thing I would
 
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
like to add that I think was maybe part
 
00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:11.220 align:start position:0%
of your question is each one of each and
 
00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:14.100 align:start position:0%
every single bill will be voted on
 
00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:16.799 align:start position:0%
separately as an individual bill so I
 
00:24:18.409 --> 00:24:18.419 align:start position:0%
may have misled when I said you know
 
00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:20.820 align:start position:0%
kind of mush these whatever word I used
 
00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:22.740 align:start position:0%
each one will still be individually
 
00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:27.780 align:start position:0%
voted on as it is that is that better
 
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
yes thank you I I worry where we were
 
00:24:33.049 --> 00:24:33.059 align:start position:0%
aware that like one of them in
 
00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:34.400 align:start position:0%
particular seems to have a lot of
 
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional elements but others
 
00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:38.580 align:start position:0%
seem to have more components that we can
 
00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:41.220 align:start position:0%
navigate just making sure we're not
 
00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:42.900 align:start position:0%
um punting something that will
 
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
ultimately get us into deeper hot water
 
00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:46.860 align:start position:0%
yeah and there's no commitment to
 
00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:48.780 align:start position:0%
anything by retaining it representative
 
00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:51.289 align:start position:0%
anything by retaining it representative
Bolden

00:24:51.289 --> 00:24:51.299 align:start position:0%
Bolden
 
00:24:51.299 --> 00:24:52.970 align:start position:0%
Bolden
thanks

00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:52.980 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:55.380 align:start position:0%
um going off of all that conversation
 
00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
so I'm imagining that your plan is to
 
00:25:00.409 --> 00:25:00.419 align:start position:0%
have work sessions that are announced
 
00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
that are on all of the bills on this
 
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.190 align:start position:0%
that are on all of the bills on this
topic

00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:04.200 align:start position:0%
topic
 
00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:06.900 align:start position:0%
um and they'll be full committee
 
00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:08.580 align:start position:0%
um and that eventually we might drum up
 
00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:10.140 align:start position:0%
some kind of amendment pick a bill to
 
00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
amend kill the rest and move forward
 
00:25:14.029 --> 00:25:14.039 align:start position:0%
with one bill
 
00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:16.140 align:start position:0%
um and so I just wanted to suggest and
 
00:25:18.529 --> 00:25:18.539 align:start position:0%
you do not have to decide today
 
00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:20.700 align:start position:0%
um but maybe I believe you have the
 
00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:22.860 align:start position:0%
option to hold a public hearing on
 
00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:25.020 align:start position:0%
whatever we ultimately put together if
 
00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:26.460 align:start position:0%
you want to and I don't know if that
 
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
would be a good step or if we just get
 
00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:29.340 align:start position:0%
testimony repeating what we've already
 
00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:31.380 align:start position:0%
heard but if it's significantly
 
00:25:34.789 --> 00:25:34.799 align:start position:0%
different it may be worthwhile thank you
 
00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
um I agree and I I think that our work
 
00:25:39.169 --> 00:25:39.179 align:start position:0%
sessions are public so I think that
 
00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:40.860 align:start position:0%
anyone who cares will probably attend
 
00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:43.740 align:start position:0%
them anyway and if we alter alter the
 
00:25:45.409 --> 00:25:45.419 align:start position:0%
subject matter so much that it it
 
00:25:48.769 --> 00:25:48.779 align:start position:0%
requires a public hearing to re
 
00:25:50.149 --> 00:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
um talk about the issues I certainly
 
00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
will will do that but we can discuss
 
00:25:53.269 --> 00:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
that as a committee
 
00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:56.700 align:start position:0%
representative Newman and and my
 
00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
question is
 
00:26:00.529 --> 00:26:00.539 align:start position:0%
the all of these bills that deal with
 
00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:02.460 align:start position:0%
this will eventually go through this
 
00:26:04.549 --> 00:26:04.559 align:start position:0%
committee because where they are all
 
00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:07.260 align:start position:0%
subject to Second committee to come here
 
00:26:09.529 --> 00:26:09.539 align:start position:0%
for that kind of stuff okay because I
 
00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:10.980 align:start position:0%
don't know if there are any in any other
 
00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:12.950 align:start position:0%
don't know if there are any in any other
committees

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
committees
 
00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that there are but I know
 
00:26:16.549 --> 00:26:16.559 align:start position:0%
that the other body has some too that
 
00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
will be brought and worked on at the
 
00:26:21.409 --> 00:26:21.419 align:start position:0%
same time at the crossover so yeah all
 
00:26:24.169 --> 00:26:24.179 align:start position:0%
roads lead to Rome
 
00:26:26.529 --> 00:26:26.539 align:start position:0%
and you're the emperor
 
00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
with that we will um
 
00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:43.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:45.409 --> 00:26:45.419 align:start position:0%
we'll be taking that bill up in a little
 
00:26:45.419 --> 00:26:47.029 align:start position:0%
we'll be taking that bill up in a little
bit

00:26:47.029 --> 00:26:47.039 align:start position:0%
bit
 
00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative Pratt
 
00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:54.830 align:start position:0%
uh representative Pratt

are we putting things on consent
 
00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
because I think we do have to explicitly

discuss it and agree to it on a retain I
 
00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:14.220 align:start position:0%

previous one so I'm hoping that we do
 
00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
not need to reiterate our previous
 
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:47.760 align:start position:0%

an appropriation to the board

the important service the parole board

serves and the amount of time a member
 
00:31:57.649 --> 00:31:57.659 align:start position:0%
dedicates to the performance of their
 
00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:00.720 align:start position:0%

discussion

00:32:24.370 --> 00:32:24.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:26.120 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:28.440 align:start position:0%
representative here at Gathering right
 
00:32:29.810 --> 00:32:29.820 align:start position:0%
this cold weather is messing with my
 
00:32:33.409 --> 00:32:33.419 align:start position:0%
asthma so if my voice goes out that's
 
00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:34.980 align:start position:0%
the reason
 
00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:35.810 align:start position:0%
the reason
um

00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:35.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:39.409 --> 00:32:39.419 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony from the board on
 
00:32:42.169 --> 00:32:42.179 align:start position:0%
several occasions over the last year and
 
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
last week that they're having a problem
 
00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
actually meeting because if two two
 
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
people are there they don't are gone
 
00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:53.820 align:start position:0%
they don't have enough coverage so we
 
00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:56.340 align:start position:0%
already know that they're behind and so
 
00:32:58.130 --> 00:32:58.140 align:start position:0%
they come to us for help
 
00:33:00.409 --> 00:33:00.419 align:start position:0%
I can't understand why we would be Ito
 
00:33:02.029 --> 00:33:02.039 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
00:33:04.789 --> 00:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
I believe that that's part of our duty
 
00:33:09.889 --> 00:33:09.899 align:start position:0%
to help and he's asked for at least five
 
00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
days or five meetings
 
00:33:14.509 --> 00:33:14.519 align:start position:0%
um a year
 
00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
I think that that's pretty good I
 
00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:17.820 align:start position:0%
personally I think he's going to need
 
00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:20.460 align:start position:0%
more than that okay the way the courts
 
00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:21.720 align:start position:0%
and everything are backed up and how
 
00:33:23.269 --> 00:33:23.279 align:start position:0%
people are trying to get parole and
 
00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:25.500 align:start position:0%
those things of that nature
 
00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
so um we actually had a finance person
 
00:33:31.909 --> 00:33:31.919 align:start position:0%
that actually wrote the Bill and so and
 
00:33:34.389 --> 00:33:34.399 align:start position:0%
and knowing knowing that I truly believe
 
00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
that she's already looked at the
 
00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:38.210 align:start position:0%
that she's already looked at the
finances

00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:38.220 align:start position:0%
finances
 
00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:40.380 align:start position:0%
you know so
 
00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
and felt that we would be able to cover
 
00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:44.940 align:start position:0%
that otherwise I truly don't believe the
 
00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:46.860 align:start position:0%
bill would have been written so if there
 
00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
was a question about the finance I truly
 
00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:50.700 align:start position:0%
believe that we should have gone to
 
00:33:53.509 --> 00:33:53.519 align:start position:0%
finance and inquire instead of putting
 
00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:55.260 align:start position:0%
it out there that we don't have the
 
00:33:58.490 --> 00:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
funds and you know so
 
00:34:10.570 --> 00:34:10.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
at this time I'm going to recess this
 
00:34:14.930 --> 00:34:14.940 align:start position:0%
bill for five minutes and we will pick
 
00:34:17.089 --> 00:34:17.099 align:start position:0%
it up again in five minutes Republican
 
00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:18.060 align:start position:0%
members of the committee could you
 
00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:36.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:51.470 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:51.480 --> 00:35:11.030 align:start position:0%

um I would add that as a point for the
 
00:42:43.490 --> 00:42:43.500 align:start position:0%
reflection we are a policy committee and
 
00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
I we agree with the policy of being able
 
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
to backfill those slots and we agree
 
00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
that they need some more money and um
 
00:42:53.569 --> 00:42:53.579 align:start position:0%
with regard to how much you want percent
 
00:42:55.730 --> 00:42:55.740 align:start position:0%
um we'll let Finance discuss that and I
 
00:42:56.930 --> 00:42:56.940 align:start position:0%
think it's not an outrageous amount
 
00:42:58.730 --> 00:42:58.740 align:start position:0%
they've asked for so
 
00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:00.180 align:start position:0%
um we're going to go ahead and any
 
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
00:43:03.589 --> 00:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
representative salic
 
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just would like to
 
00:43:07.069 --> 00:43:07.079 align:start position:0%
say one of the things that I appreciated
 
00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:09.060 align:start position:0%
was the recognition
 
00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:10.680 align:start position:0%
from the people who presented the bill
 
00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:13.380 align:start position:0%
and testified about it that their goal
 
00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:16.020 align:start position:0%
is not to have substantial increases but
 
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
to accommodate their committee with
 
00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
experienced members for known absences
 
00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:22.740 align:start position:0%
so that they can ensure that their
 
00:43:25.849 --> 00:43:25.859 align:start position:0%
process happens in a timely manner
 
00:43:28.609 --> 00:43:28.619 align:start position:0%
that's a point well taken and I think
 
00:43:29.930 --> 00:43:29.940 align:start position:0%
that one of the things that we've
 
00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
reflected on is the specialty required
 
00:43:35.569 --> 00:43:35.579 align:start position:0%
in these positions that to backfill it
 
00:43:37.609 --> 00:43:37.619 align:start position:0%
and to fill these positions you have to
 
00:43:39.250 --> 00:43:39.260 align:start position:0%
be able to offer some reasonable
 
00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
enumeration for lawyers and people that
 
00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
to take away from their private practice
 
00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:46.260 align:start position:0%
to come in and serve
 
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
00:43:51.290 --> 00:43:51.300 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to thank you for your
 
00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:52.980 align:start position:0%
comments and I think that we I would
 
00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:54.900 align:start position:0%
just like to say that we are in fact a
 
00:43:56.750 --> 00:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
policy committee and we should consider
 
00:43:59.089 --> 00:43:59.099 align:start position:0%
policy we should get the policy right
 
00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:00.900 align:start position:0%
and make sure that's what we want to do
 
00:44:04.130 --> 00:44:04.140 align:start position:0%
and if there's a financial problem with
 
00:44:06.589 --> 00:44:06.599 align:start position:0%
it then the finance committee will
 
00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not they have the
 
00:44:09.829 --> 00:44:09.839 align:start position:0%
resources to be able to let that because
 
00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
we'll go to the second committee for
 
00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:13.069 align:start position:0%
we'll go to the second committee for
financing

00:44:13.069 --> 00:44:13.079 align:start position:0%

00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
the motion of itl for 643 is because of
 
00:45:56.270 --> 00:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences this bill to
 
00:45:58.190 --> 00:45:58.200 align:start position:0%

representative tensor would you like to

speak to you second
 
00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
president uh Pratt said it well
 
00:46:30.050 --> 00:46:30.060 align:start position:0%
I'll open discussion by saying
 
00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
as a as a committee we um there are
 
00:46:35.690 --> 00:46:35.700 align:start position:0%
several bills in another committee that
 
00:46:37.849 --> 00:46:37.859 align:start position:0%
deal with this issue in a much more
 
00:46:40.490 --> 00:46:40.500 align:start position:0%
comprehensive Manner and and have
 
00:46:42.589 --> 00:46:42.599 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support
 
00:46:44.930 --> 00:46:44.940 align:start position:0%
um and I look forward to seeing those um
 
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
above the ones we currently have so I'm
 
00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:49.140 align:start position:0%
going to be supporting the uh in
 
00:46:51.550 --> 00:46:51.560 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate on this one
 
00:46:54.109 --> 00:46:54.119 align:start position:0%
representative salic
 
00:47:02.990 --> 00:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:06.530 --> 00:47:06.540 align:start position:0%
I think as a new representative she got
 
00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
a little overextended in the number of
 
00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
things she attempted to incorporate into
 
00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:13.140 align:start position:0%
this bill and that she recognized that
 
00:47:15.290 --> 00:47:15.300 align:start position:0%
there might be others that would be once
 
00:47:16.730 --> 00:47:16.740 align:start position:0%
she would be happy to continue to
 
00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:17.569 align:start position:0%
she would be happy to continue to
support

00:47:17.569 --> 00:47:17.579 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
and so I just want to recognize her her
 
00:47:22.910 --> 00:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
intent and dedication to the process and
 
00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:24.900 align:start position:0%
recognize that while I hope we will move
 
00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
forward towards supporting similar
 
00:47:28.490 --> 00:47:28.500 align:start position:0%
measures that I agree this one is
 
00:47:31.130 --> 00:47:31.140 align:start position:0%
probably a bit overextended
 
00:47:33.710 --> 00:47:33.720 align:start position:0%
thank you and I would second that and
 
00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
add to it that as a committee
 
00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
um we believe in the in the good
 
00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:39.900 align:start position:0%
intentions of every representative who
 
00:47:42.410 --> 00:47:42.420 align:start position:0%
brings a piece of legislation forward
 
00:47:44.450 --> 00:47:44.460 align:start position:0%
um and they have the best interest of
 
00:47:46.010 --> 00:47:46.020 align:start position:0%
the public at heart and it's our job to
 
00:47:47.329 --> 00:47:47.339 align:start position:0%
help them
 
00:47:49.130 --> 00:47:49.140 align:start position:0%
um do it in the best way possible
 
00:47:54.109 --> 00:47:54.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:57.349 --> 00:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
um my comment deals with the situations
 
00:47:59.829 --> 00:47:59.839 align:start position:0%
where we have many bills
 
00:48:03.650 --> 00:48:03.660 align:start position:0%
that have good parts to them
 
00:48:07.490 --> 00:48:07.500 align:start position:0%
and we just retained a situation like
 
00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:09.720 align:start position:0%
that in order that we could look all of
 
00:48:13.370 --> 00:48:13.380 align:start position:0%
the bills on the same subject so I my
 
00:48:16.130 --> 00:48:16.140 align:start position:0%
own personal feeling is that we should
 
00:48:17.870 --> 00:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
probably retain this bill and use the
 
00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
same process on this category of bills
 
00:48:25.790 --> 00:48:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:28.430 --> 00:48:28.440 align:start position:0%
thank you um and
 
00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
you're not wrong however there's only so
 
00:48:32.809 --> 00:48:32.819 align:start position:0%
many months in the summer and unless you
 
00:48:34.970 --> 00:48:34.980 align:start position:0%
want to spend them all here we wouldn't
 
00:48:36.890 --> 00:48:36.900 align:start position:0%
be able to retain all these there is as
 
00:48:38.809 --> 00:48:38.819 align:start position:0%
I said another set of bills working
 
00:48:40.970 --> 00:48:40.980 align:start position:0%
their way through another committee that
 
00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh a lot of the work will be done for us
 
00:48:46.849 --> 00:48:46.859 align:start position:0%
as far as vetting and Distilling down
 
00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
the best parts and I think that bill or
 
00:48:51.589 --> 00:48:51.599 align:start position:0%
those bills had a head start and they
 
00:48:54.170 --> 00:48:54.180 align:start position:0%
have bipartisan Sport and from both
 
00:48:58.130 --> 00:48:58.140 align:start position:0%
bodies so I think for us to try and work
 
00:49:00.290 --> 00:49:00.300 align:start position:0%
parallel tracks at the same time it's
 
00:49:02.270 --> 00:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
not going to end and the way we hope it
 
00:49:04.250 --> 00:49:04.260 align:start position:0%
would so I respect your opinion on that
 
00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
though representative wheeler thank you
 
00:49:08.270 --> 00:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and I agree with what you
 
00:49:10.010 --> 00:49:10.020 align:start position:0%
just said I don't want to be here all
 
00:49:12.770 --> 00:49:12.780 align:start position:0%
summer and I I respect the intentions of
 
00:49:14.690 --> 00:49:14.700 align:start position:0%
this bill and support the legalization
 
00:49:17.809 --> 00:49:17.819 align:start position:0%
of marijuana and hope that some form of
 
00:49:19.609 --> 00:49:19.619 align:start position:0%
legalization gets to the house floor and
 
00:49:21.530 --> 00:49:21.540 align:start position:0%
passes through the legislature I don't
 
00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:23.220 align:start position:0%
think state-run
 
00:49:25.010 --> 00:49:25.020 align:start position:0%
Cannabis stores is the way to move
 
00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:26.170 align:start position:0%
Cannabis stores is the way to move
forward

00:49:26.170 --> 00:49:26.180 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
the state-run liquor stores I think
 
00:49:31.550 --> 00:49:31.560 align:start position:0%
presents a problem already there are
 
00:49:34.450 --> 00:49:34.460 align:start position:0%
many reports of corruption and I think
 
00:49:37.490 --> 00:49:37.500 align:start position:0%
adding uh products for them to sell
 
00:49:39.829 --> 00:49:39.839 align:start position:0%
would not be the right thing for this
 
00:49:42.170 --> 00:49:42.180 align:start position:0%
legislature to do I I think
 
00:49:44.569 --> 00:49:44.579 align:start position:0%
moving forward with legalization in a
 
00:49:44.579 --> 00:49:46.150 align:start position:0%
moving forward with legalization in a
more

00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:49:49.069 --> 00:49:49.079 align:start position:0%
liberty-minded way where it's it's about
 
00:49:51.410 --> 00:49:51.420 align:start position:0%
people who can grow at their homes and
 
00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
people who can possess and use marijuana
 
00:49:56.030 --> 00:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
if they have it is is the better way to
 
00:49:58.750 --> 00:49:58.760 align:start position:0%
go rather than State sanctioned stores
 
00:50:01.970 --> 00:50:01.980 align:start position:0%
uh selling marijuana so I will vote for
 
00:50:04.370 --> 00:50:04.380 align:start position:0%
the itl motion on this legislation thank
 
00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:05.450 align:start position:0%
the itl motion on this legislation thank
you

00:50:05.450 --> 00:50:05.460 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
representative Newell
 
00:50:10.730 --> 00:50:10.740 align:start position:0%
I would just like to um I I while I
 
00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
recognize all all points and agree with
 
00:50:14.990 --> 00:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of them on principle I'm going to
 
00:50:17.569 --> 00:50:17.579 align:start position:0%
be voting against the itl and what I
 
00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
would like to for people to keep in mind
 
00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about marijuana
 
00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
legalization uh cannabis legalization
 
00:50:25.849 --> 00:50:25.859 align:start position:0%
and things like that is the balance of
 
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:28.020 align:start position:0%
the harm that is actually being done on
 
00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:29.460 align:start position:0%
behalf of it being illegal right now
 
00:50:31.309 --> 00:50:31.319 align:start position:0%
people are suffering the consequences of
 
00:50:33.650 --> 00:50:33.660 align:start position:0%
that people are sitting in jail there's
 
00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
a variety of harms that are happening to
 
00:50:38.270 --> 00:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
people actively because of it it being
 
00:50:40.609 --> 00:50:40.619 align:start position:0%
criminalized so I just want to keep that
 
00:50:42.829 --> 00:50:42.839 align:start position:0%
in mind as far as the personal impact as
 
00:50:45.650 --> 00:50:45.660 align:start position:0%
long as we wait and our inaction has
 
00:50:48.530 --> 00:50:48.540 align:start position:0%
consequences for uh citizens New
 
00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:49.549 align:start position:0%
consequences for uh citizens New
Hampshire

00:50:49.549 --> 00:50:49.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
thank you and I I'll take that as your
 
00:50:54.049 --> 00:50:54.059 align:start position:0%
support of my bill lowering the
 
00:50:55.609 --> 00:50:55.619 align:start position:0%
penalties for first offense possession
 
00:50:57.470 --> 00:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
that will be coming representative
 
00:50:57.480 --> 00:51:00.049 align:start position:0%
that will be coming representative
Bolden

00:51:00.049 --> 00:51:00.059 align:start position:0%
Bolden
 
00:51:04.549 --> 00:51:04.559 align:start position:0%
legalize it but um I support itl
 
00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
um we know
 
00:51:08.450 --> 00:51:08.460 align:start position:0%
what what the Liquor Commission is today
 
00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
and that it was created when a substance
 
00:51:16.849 --> 00:51:16.859 align:start position:0%
was re-legalized and um I think that
 
00:51:18.170 --> 00:51:18.180 align:start position:0%
um arguments I've heard from
 
00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:22.520 align:start position:0%
stakeholders in cannabis legalization
 
00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
they make a good point that people
 
00:51:26.710 --> 00:51:26.720 align:start position:0%
impacted by
 
00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:29.640 align:start position:0%
the criminalization of possession of
 
00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:31.010 align:start position:0%
the criminalization of possession of
cannabis

00:51:31.010 --> 00:51:31.020 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
00:51:32.569 --> 00:51:32.579 align:start position:0%
should have the opportunity to
 
00:51:36.410 --> 00:51:36.420 align:start position:0%
participate in its legal Commerce to
 
00:51:40.490 --> 00:51:40.500 align:start position:0%
kind of um reverse the wrongs of uh you
 
00:51:42.349 --> 00:51:42.359 align:start position:0%
know Decades of or I guess at this point
 
00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
A Century of criminalization
 
00:51:46.069 --> 00:51:46.079 align:start position:0%
um especially in the way that it's
 
00:51:47.630 --> 00:51:47.640 align:start position:0%
affected certain populations of people
 
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
and so to hand it over to the Liquor
 
00:51:53.450 --> 00:51:53.460 align:start position:0%
Commission would deny
 
00:51:55.370 --> 00:51:55.380 align:start position:0%
um some a large portion of those
 
00:51:57.109 --> 00:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
opportunities with the exception of
 
00:51:58.849 --> 00:51:58.859 align:start position:0%
stocking shelves
 
00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:00.660 align:start position:0%
um so that's why I'm going to support
 
00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
itl thanks
 
00:52:05.210 --> 00:52:05.220 align:start position:0%
thank you and my heart is warmed by the
 
00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
unanimous support of the free market
 
00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair
 
00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
I would just like to mention I think
 
00:52:19.849 --> 00:52:19.859 align:start position:0%
that the idea of uh
 
00:52:23.630 --> 00:52:23.640 align:start position:0%
state-run cannabis is not inherently bad
 
00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
considering we're a state that tries to
 
00:52:27.069 --> 00:52:27.079 align:start position:0%
avoid income tax and other
 
00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
increases on our population but that we
 
00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:33.240 align:start position:0%
also are a state that is seeking more
 
00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:35.640 align:start position:0%
streams of Revenue and as of right now
 
00:52:37.549 --> 00:52:37.559 align:start position:0%
anyone in New Hampshire who wants to
 
00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:39.420 align:start position:0%
access cannabis can drive simply 20
 
00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
minutes over the border and bring it
 
00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
back into our state so we are giving
 
00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
that Revenue to the states surrounding
 
00:52:46.970 --> 00:52:46.980 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire because of that I will be
 
00:52:50.089 --> 00:52:50.099 align:start position:0%
voting itl or voting against the itl
 
00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative wheeler I would
 
00:52:55.010 --> 00:52:55.020 align:start position:0%
just uh for my friend representative
 
00:52:56.930 --> 00:52:56.940 align:start position:0%
Murray urged her and anyone interested
 
00:52:59.089 --> 00:52:59.099 align:start position:0%
in the Liquor Commission and what
 
00:53:00.650 --> 00:53:00.660 align:start position:0%
they're doing to go to the finance
 
00:53:02.329 --> 00:53:02.339 align:start position:0%
committee division one and talk to
 
00:53:04.370 --> 00:53:04.380 align:start position:0%
representative Peter leishman he can go
 
00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
in depth on the corruption of the Liquor
 
00:53:08.809 --> 00:53:08.819 align:start position:0%
Commission and I will just reaffirm that
 
00:53:10.910 --> 00:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
this is not something we should be we
 
00:53:14.089 --> 00:53:14.099 align:start position:0%
will um I'd ask you to refrain from
 
00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
um asserting that any official state
 
00:53:18.589 --> 00:53:18.599 align:start position:0%
agency is corrupt at this point please
 
00:53:21.349 --> 00:53:21.359 align:start position:0%

representative Murray thank you Mr chair
 
00:53:25.790 --> 00:53:25.800 align:start position:0%
um just would like to say maybe it would
 
00:53:28.609 --> 00:53:28.619 align:start position:0%
be worthwhile for us to investigate
 
00:53:32.089 --> 00:53:32.099 align:start position:0%
um instituting cannabis Commission
 
00:53:34.069 --> 00:53:34.079 align:start position:0%

00:53:34.079 --> 00:53:36.230 align:start position:0%

00:56:20.630 --> 00:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative gather would
 
00:56:23.329 --> 00:56:23.339 align:start position:0%
you like to speak to your motion yeah
 
00:56:25.210 --> 00:56:25.220 align:start position:0%
um I understand the intent of the bill
 
00:56:28.670 --> 00:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
however no matter what the crime I truly
 
00:56:30.349 --> 00:56:30.359 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
00:56:30.359 --> 00:56:31.309 align:start position:0%
believe that
um

00:56:31.309 --> 00:56:31.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:32.990 --> 00:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
the description
 
00:56:35.270 --> 00:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
of anything rather it's mental illness
 
00:56:38.750 --> 00:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
or anything else or in in
 
00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
how would I say that in dealing with the
 
00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:42.770 align:start position:0%
how would I say that in dealing with the
crime

00:56:42.770 --> 00:56:42.780 align:start position:0%
crime
 
00:56:44.329 --> 00:56:44.339 align:start position:0%
um that discretion should go to the
 
00:56:46.010 --> 00:56:46.020 align:start position:0%
judge I don't believe that we as
 
00:56:48.170 --> 00:56:48.180 align:start position:0%
lawmakers should write laws to say what
 
00:56:51.170 --> 00:56:51.180 align:start position:0%
the judge can can't do and can do
 
00:56:53.630 --> 00:56:53.640 align:start position:0%
so I thought it was a discretionary
 
00:56:57.349 --> 00:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:58.790 --> 00:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
um oh
 
00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:07.190 align:start position:0%
um oh
judge

00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:08.349 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:57:08.349 --> 00:57:08.359 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:57:10.730 --> 00:57:10.740 align:start position:0%
I'm just making sure because you're the
 
00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:12.849 align:start position:0%
I'm just making sure because you're the
same

00:57:12.849 --> 00:57:12.859 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:57:16.430 --> 00:57:16.440 align:start position:0%
no I was saying that I believe that a
 
00:57:19.309 --> 00:57:19.319 align:start position:0%
judge should make make the call not you
 
00:57:19.319 --> 00:57:19.970 align:start position:0%
judge should make make the call not you
know

00:57:19.970 --> 00:57:19.980 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:57:22.549 --> 00:57:22.559 align:start position:0%
um us as lawmakers here that's what I
 
00:57:23.809 --> 00:57:23.819 align:start position:0%
was saying
 
00:57:23.819 --> 00:57:24.589 align:start position:0%
was saying
um

00:57:24.589 --> 00:57:24.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:27.470 --> 00:57:27.480 align:start position:0%
so um the other piece of that is that we
 
00:57:30.049 --> 00:57:30.059 align:start position:0%
had her testimony of a couple towns that
 
00:57:32.829 --> 00:57:32.839 align:start position:0%
um in specific as to what the issue was
 
00:57:35.390 --> 00:57:35.400 align:start position:0%
and then I also had an issue that there
 
00:57:37.010 --> 00:57:37.020 align:start position:0%
were two males honestly that came here
 
00:57:39.890 --> 00:57:39.900 align:start position:0%
to with a bill like that
 
00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:41.210 align:start position:0%
to with a bill like that
um

00:57:41.210 --> 00:57:41.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:43.309 --> 00:57:43.319 align:start position:0%
so I just didn't like the bill all
 
00:57:46.130 --> 00:57:46.140 align:start position:0%
across the town I have 13 grandchildren
 
00:57:48.589 --> 00:57:48.599 align:start position:0%
and I definitely feel that they don't
 
00:57:49.970 --> 00:57:49.980 align:start position:0%
need to be walking down the street in
 
00:57:53.210 --> 00:57:53.220 align:start position:0%
Nashua and seeing um women or anybody
 
00:57:55.790 --> 00:57:55.800 align:start position:0%
topless to be honest with you because in
 
00:57:58.250 --> 00:57:58.260 align:start position:0%
for me they probably should have came
 
00:57:59.510 --> 00:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
with a bill to
 
00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:00.410 align:start position:0%
with a bill to
um

00:58:00.410 --> 00:58:00.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:03.770 --> 00:58:03.780 align:start position:0%
arrest the person the male as well if
 
00:58:06.230 --> 00:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
they were topless I don't feel as though
 
00:58:07.490 --> 00:58:07.500 align:start position:0%
they should be walking around without
 
00:58:10.549 --> 00:58:10.559 align:start position:0%
shirts as well so
 
00:58:12.829 --> 00:58:12.839 align:start position:0%
I'm definitely against the bill so I I
 
00:58:14.750 --> 00:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
moved it thank you representative
 
00:58:16.790 --> 00:58:16.800 align:start position:0%
Catherine representative Rhodes would
 
00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
you like to speak to your second thank
 
00:58:21.290 --> 00:58:21.300 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I I agree with um
 
00:58:23.569 --> 00:58:23.579 align:start position:0%
everything my my colleague and friend
 
00:58:25.370 --> 00:58:25.380 align:start position:0%
said and I
 
00:58:28.809 --> 00:58:28.819 align:start position:0%
you know I I just think
 
00:58:31.609 --> 00:58:31.619 align:start position:0%
what what are we doing here right I I
 
00:58:33.049 --> 00:58:33.059 align:start position:0%
just don't think that anybody in society
 
00:58:34.549 --> 00:58:34.559 align:start position:0%
should be walking around without a shirt
 
00:58:35.690 --> 00:58:35.700 align:start position:0%
on and I agree I don't think the male
 
00:58:37.309 --> 00:58:37.319 align:start position:0%
should be doing it either and I think we
 
00:58:40.490 --> 00:58:40.500 align:start position:0%
need to think of our of our youth and
 
00:58:42.349 --> 00:58:42.359 align:start position:0%
um you know exactly exactly what kind of
 
00:58:44.030 --> 00:58:44.040 align:start position:0%
message that we're sending so
 
00:58:46.849 --> 00:58:46.859 align:start position:0%
pretty much it
 
00:58:48.650 --> 00:58:48.660 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
00:58:50.630 --> 00:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
I would just um thank you Mr chair I
 
00:58:52.309 --> 00:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
would like to remind the committee that
 
00:58:54.589 --> 00:58:54.599 align:start position:0%
it is already legal in the state of New
 
00:58:56.690 --> 00:58:56.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to be topless whether in
 
00:58:58.730 --> 00:58:58.740 align:start position:0%
Nashua Manchester Etc it is already
 
00:58:58.740 --> 00:59:00.109 align:start position:0%
Nashua Manchester Etc it is already
legal

00:59:00.109 --> 00:59:00.119 align:start position:0%
legal
 
00:59:03.829 --> 00:59:03.839 align:start position:0%
um this bill would just override the
 
00:59:06.170 --> 00:59:06.180 align:start position:0%
local ordinances by towns like laconian
 
00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
I believe Milford is the other one who
 
00:59:10.069 --> 00:59:10.079 align:start position:0%
have local ordinances that prohibit
 
00:59:12.710 --> 00:59:12.720 align:start position:0%
female toplessness but across the state
 
00:59:14.750 --> 00:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire it is already legal for
 
00:59:17.690 --> 00:59:17.700 align:start position:0%
anybody to be topless
 
00:59:20.750 --> 00:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for that reminder
 
00:59:23.270 --> 00:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
representative salik
 
00:59:28.670 --> 00:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:32.270 --> 00:59:32.280 align:start position:0%
on one hand I oppose discrimination in
 
00:59:34.130 --> 00:59:34.140 align:start position:0%
all of its forms
 
00:59:35.329 --> 00:59:35.339 align:start position:0%
um and and I agree if we're going to
 
00:59:37.010 --> 00:59:37.020 align:start position:0%
have a bill about who should wear shirts
 
00:59:39.109 --> 00:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
it should be or cover their nipples it
 
00:59:41.930 --> 00:59:41.940 align:start position:0%
should be everyone so you know uh
 
00:59:44.569 --> 00:59:44.579 align:start position:0%
representative Heinz could provide both
 
00:59:48.049 --> 00:59:48.059 align:start position:0%
men and women with pasties if needed but
 
00:59:50.450 --> 00:59:50.460 align:start position:0%
um ultimately what comes down to for me
 
00:59:52.010 --> 00:59:52.020 align:start position:0%
and where I'm really concerned is the
 
00:59:54.170 --> 00:59:54.180 align:start position:0%
idea that we should be overriding a
 
00:59:55.730 --> 00:59:55.740 align:start position:0%
municipal ordinance
 
00:59:58.789 --> 00:59:58.799 align:start position:0%
and I spoke with
 
01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
um the representative from the um one of
 
01:00:04.609 --> 01:00:04.619 align:start position:0%
the municipal associations to just get a
 
01:00:07.010 --> 01:00:07.020 align:start position:0%
better sense of how this would impact if
 
01:00:09.170 --> 01:00:09.180 align:start position:0%
if this bill would essentially set a
 
01:00:13.870 --> 01:00:13.880 align:start position:0%
precedent for our overriding local
 
01:00:17.690 --> 01:00:17.700 align:start position:0%
statutes and local ordinances and his
 
01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
feeling was that it potentially does
 
01:00:22.130 --> 01:00:22.140 align:start position:0%
that and so I I honestly don't know how
 
01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
I'm going to vote when we get to the
 
01:00:26.569 --> 01:00:26.579 align:start position:0%
vote but I I really am struggling with
 
01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
the concept of overriding what a town
 
01:00:33.530 --> 01:00:33.540 align:start position:0%
believes in its best interest just as I
 
01:00:34.849 --> 01:00:34.859 align:start position:0%
know like in the town where I live we
 
01:00:36.530 --> 01:00:36.540 align:start position:0%
have ordinances that are very specific
 
01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
because they're directly relevant to how
 
01:00:40.849 --> 01:00:40.859 align:start position:0%
our town is structured that it would be
 
01:00:42.890 --> 01:00:42.900 align:start position:0%
completely irrelevant in the towns of
 
01:00:45.410 --> 01:00:45.420 align:start position:0%
anyone else who serves on this committee
 
01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:51.289 align:start position:0%
anyone else who serves on this committee
foreign

01:00:51.289 --> 01:00:51.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
thankfully I'm not conflicted I I
 
01:00:56.750 --> 01:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
represent Hampton and part of that is
 
01:00:58.670 --> 01:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
Hampton beach Hampton Beach State Park
 
01:01:02.270 --> 01:01:02.280 align:start position:0%
has an annual event free the nipple
 
01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:03.049 align:start position:0%
has an annual event free the nipple
um

01:01:03.049 --> 01:01:03.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:03.059 --> 01:01:04.430 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:01:04.430 --> 01:01:04.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:06.770 --> 01:01:06.780 align:start position:0%
to go a little bit further into that
 
01:01:08.569 --> 01:01:08.579 align:start position:0%
I've served on a municipal budget
 
01:01:10.930 --> 01:01:10.940 align:start position:0%
committee municipal
 
01:01:12.950 --> 01:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
planning board
 
01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
and I realized that New Hampshire is a
 
01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
Dillon State Dylan rule state so if the
 
01:01:21.410 --> 01:01:21.420 align:start position:0%
state doesn't give you if the state has
 
01:01:23.089 --> 01:01:23.099 align:start position:0%
been silent the legislature has been
 
01:01:26.690 --> 01:01:26.700 align:start position:0%
silent that's our prohibition for a
 
01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:28.069 align:start position:0%
silent that's our prohibition for a
municipality

01:01:28.069 --> 01:01:28.079 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
01:01:30.289 --> 01:01:30.299 align:start position:0%
that covers cities and towns from
 
01:01:33.049 --> 01:01:33.059 align:start position:0%
passing any type of ordinance in that in
 
01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
that subject matter and whereas this
 
01:01:39.609 --> 01:01:39.619 align:start position:0%
legislature has never spoken against
 
01:01:42.770 --> 01:01:42.780 align:start position:0%
displaying of the chest
 
01:01:44.990 --> 01:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
these these municipalities should not be
 
01:01:47.930 --> 01:01:47.940 align:start position:0%
passing ordinances in that effect so
 
01:01:47.940 --> 01:01:49.789 align:start position:0%
passing ordinances in that effect so
uh

01:01:49.789 --> 01:01:49.799 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:01:52.430 --> 01:01:52.440 align:start position:0%
I I won't be voting for The ITIL as a
 
01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
matter of fact I'd offer to write a
 
01:01:56.109 --> 01:01:56.119 align:start position:0%
Minority Report
 
01:01:59.329 --> 01:01:59.339 align:start position:0%
thank you representative um and your
 
01:02:01.309 --> 01:02:01.319 align:start position:0%
point is also well taken however I would
 
01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
I would assume in that state we would um
 
01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
under those circumstances the courts
 
01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
would be the one to resolve whether or
 
01:02:11.150 --> 01:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
not they are authorized or within their
 
01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:13.740 align:start position:0%
rights to uh under dillonsville state to
 
01:02:15.230 --> 01:02:15.240 align:start position:0%
be doing that
 
01:02:18.289 --> 01:02:18.299 align:start position:0%
um representative Newell
 
01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
um I would like to just just comment on
 
01:02:24.530 --> 01:02:24.540 align:start position:0%
uh the idea that we on the state level
 
01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:25.130 align:start position:0%
uh the idea that we on the state level
um

01:02:25.130 --> 01:02:25.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:27.170 --> 01:02:27.180 align:start position:0%
in my opinion what we do is we set a
 
01:02:28.789 --> 01:02:28.799 align:start position:0%
Level Playing Field and what's happening
 
01:02:31.490 --> 01:02:31.500 align:start position:0%
in these towns is that there are
 
01:02:33.589 --> 01:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
um ordinances being made that are
 
01:02:33.599 --> 01:02:35.870 align:start position:0%
um ordinances being made that are
explicitly

01:02:35.870 --> 01:02:35.880 align:start position:0%
explicitly
 
01:02:38.030 --> 01:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
um sexist and based on
 
01:02:40.910 --> 01:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
um on the the perception in
 
01:02:43.370 --> 01:02:43.380 align:start position:0%
sexualization of a woman's body and I
 
01:02:44.329 --> 01:02:44.339 align:start position:0%
think that
 
01:02:45.890 --> 01:02:45.900 align:start position:0%
um yes I will I will be voting against
 
01:02:47.569 --> 01:02:47.579 align:start position:0%
the itl because I think that it is our
 
01:02:49.730 --> 01:02:49.740 align:start position:0%
responsibility in this body to set a
 
01:02:51.710 --> 01:02:51.720 align:start position:0%
Level Playing Field when uh individual
 
01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities may make ordinances that
 
01:02:56.990 --> 01:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
go against that fundamental value
 
01:02:59.150 --> 01:02:59.160 align:start position:0%
thank you I would I would again
 
01:03:01.309 --> 01:03:01.319 align:start position:0%
reiterate though that
 
01:03:03.470 --> 01:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
we did set a Level Playing Field this is
 
01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
a Dylan real estate and the answer to
 
01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:09.839 align:start position:0%
that is through the judicial branch if
 
01:03:12.770 --> 01:03:12.780 align:start position:0%
uh if a local municipality passes an
 
01:03:14.450 --> 01:03:14.460 align:start position:0%
ordinance that they are not within their
 
01:03:16.490 --> 01:03:16.500 align:start position:0%
rights to pass it would be up to the
 
01:03:18.049 --> 01:03:18.059 align:start position:0%
judicial branch to look at that and say
 
01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
you you can't do that if we were to
 
01:03:23.829 --> 01:03:23.839 align:start position:0%
write laws trying to cover every
 
01:03:26.210 --> 01:03:26.220 align:start position:0%
municipality that passes something that
 
01:03:28.130 --> 01:03:28.140 align:start position:0%
we don't think they should we would be
 
01:03:30.289 --> 01:03:30.299 align:start position:0%
playing whack-a-mole up here writing
 
01:03:32.990 --> 01:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
bills every year but your point is well
 
01:03:35.809 --> 01:03:35.819 align:start position:0%
taken representative here Gathering
 
01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:37.740 align:start position:0%
oh and I saw you representative Murphy
 
01:03:40.069 --> 01:03:40.079 align:start position:0%
you'll be next I'm sorry sorry I also
 
01:03:42.349 --> 01:03:42.359 align:start position:0%
wanted to mention that um remember they
 
01:03:44.510 --> 01:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
gave he gave testimony and he sent us
 
01:03:47.930 --> 01:03:47.940 align:start position:0%
the documentation for um he had gone to
 
01:03:49.849 --> 01:03:49.859 align:start position:0%
the local court and to the Supreme Court
 
01:03:53.450 --> 01:03:53.460 align:start position:0%
and um they both ruled against him
 
01:03:57.170 --> 01:03:57.180 align:start position:0%
so yes thank you representative Murphy
 
01:03:58.730 --> 01:03:58.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:03:59.870 --> 01:03:59.880 align:start position:0%
um actually that was what I was going to
 
01:04:01.910 --> 01:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
say as a member of a town governing body
 
01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:04.559 align:start position:0%
myself I recognize that certain issues
 
01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
uh pertain maybe only to certain
 
01:04:09.410 --> 01:04:09.420 align:start position:0%
communities and this isn't one for my
 
01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
community but for communities that it
 
01:04:14.569 --> 01:04:14.579 align:start position:0%
impacts I would hate to see that local
 
01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
control removed so I will be supporting
 
01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
uh an itl and secondly you know I think
 
01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
reading the superior excuse me the
 
01:04:26.750 --> 01:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
supreme court judgment which was issued
 
01:04:28.730 --> 01:04:28.740 align:start position:0%
in February 2019
 
01:04:31.370 --> 01:04:31.380 align:start position:0%
um it just it helped me to confirm uh my
 
01:04:34.190 --> 01:04:34.200 align:start position:0%
my views on it so thank you
 
01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
thank you at this time I'll ask the
 
01:04:38.630 --> 01:04:38.640 align:start position:0%

represent wheeler just really quickly Mr
 
01:04:42.349 --> 01:04:42.359 align:start position:0%
chairman I just wanted to say I I I
 
01:04:44.089 --> 01:04:44.099 align:start position:0%
appreciate everything that's been said
 
01:04:45.530 --> 01:04:45.540 align:start position:0%
for me I'm voting against the Italian
 
01:04:47.089 --> 01:04:47.099 align:start position:0%
motion because I don't think that
 
01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
wearing not being shirtless should be
 
01:04:50.809 --> 01:04:50.819 align:start position:0%
illegal I think whether you're and right
 
01:04:52.549 --> 01:04:52.559 align:start position:0%
now you're being a man and being
 
01:04:55.490 --> 01:04:55.500 align:start position:0%
shirtless is a legal uh you can you can
 
01:04:58.250 --> 01:04:58.260 align:start position:0%
do that and we should equalize it in
 
01:05:01.609 --> 01:05:01.619 align:start position:0%
being shirtless should not be a crime
 
01:05:03.650 --> 01:05:03.660 align:start position:0%
I would ask you how long you would go
 
01:05:06.530 --> 01:05:06.540 align:start position:0%

01:07:08.930 --> 01:07:08.940 align:start position:0%
stone for a motion thank you Mr chair I
 
01:07:11.450 --> 01:07:11.460 align:start position:0%
would like to recommend motioning to uh
 
01:07:14.990 --> 01:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
itl House Bill 201
 
01:07:17.809 --> 01:07:17.819 align:start position:0%
seconds okay
 
01:07:22.430 --> 01:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:23.750 --> 01:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
representative Stone would you like to
 
01:07:25.130 --> 01:07:25.140 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion
 
01:07:27.069 --> 01:07:27.079 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I would
 
01:07:30.349 --> 01:07:30.359 align:start position:0%
House Bill 201 would be going backwards
 
01:07:32.270 --> 01:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
in regards to Public Safety the
 
01:07:34.069 --> 01:07:34.079 align:start position:0%
operation of a motor vehicle is a
 
01:07:35.870 --> 01:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
serious action that can result in
 
01:07:37.609 --> 01:07:37.619 align:start position:0%
serious bodily injury or death a lot of
 
01:07:39.349 --> 01:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
times we take it for granted operating a
 
01:07:41.329 --> 01:07:41.339 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle and I think the penalties
 
01:07:42.529 --> 01:07:42.539 align:start position:0%
that are currently in existence are
 
01:07:42.539 --> 01:07:45.170 align:start position:0%
that are currently in existence are
sufficient

01:07:45.170 --> 01:07:45.180 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:47.109 --> 01:07:47.119 align:start position:0%
representative speak to you a second
 
01:07:49.370 --> 01:07:49.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:07:51.829 --> 01:07:51.839 align:start position:0%
when you get a driver's license
 
01:07:54.529 --> 01:07:54.539 align:start position:0%
there are a set of roles that you
 
01:07:59.150 --> 01:07:59.160 align:start position:0%
agree to to abide by and having it
 
01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:00.950 align:start position:0%
agree to to abide by and having it
renewed

01:08:00.950 --> 01:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
renewed
 
01:08:04.730 --> 01:08:04.740 align:start position:0%
is one of them and I do believe that
 
01:08:08.450 --> 01:08:08.460 align:start position:0%
you know we've all get busy and oh my
 
01:08:10.069 --> 01:08:10.079 align:start position:0%
gosh your birthday month comes and goes
 
01:08:11.569 --> 01:08:11.579 align:start position:0%
and you you didn't go down and have your
 
01:08:13.309 --> 01:08:13.319 align:start position:0%
license renewed
 
01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
but honestly uh if if you are to be
 
01:08:18.410 --> 01:08:18.420 align:start position:0%
pulled over for that which I admittedly
 
01:08:20.510 --> 01:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
have been
 
01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:21.050 align:start position:0%
have been
um

01:08:21.050 --> 01:08:21.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:23.570 --> 01:08:23.580 align:start position:0%
you know I I had the opportunity to to
 
01:08:27.829 --> 01:08:27.839 align:start position:0%
go do that and but to just not let it go
 
01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
and and to have an excuse for that
 
01:08:32.749 --> 01:08:32.759 align:start position:0%
and to just make that all be okay I I
 
01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
don't agree with and I I think that it's
 
01:08:36.169 --> 01:08:36.179 align:start position:0%
it's it's pretty evident when you get
 
01:08:40.490 --> 01:08:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:44.150 --> 01:08:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:46.729 --> 01:08:46.739 align:start position:0%
representative sailing
 
01:08:50.570 --> 01:08:50.580 align:start position:0%
thank you I I disagree with itl I
 
01:08:52.430 --> 01:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
believe this motion
 
01:08:55.370 --> 01:08:55.380 align:start position:0%
ought to pass I think about the
 
01:08:57.470 --> 01:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
number of
 
01:08:57.480 --> 01:08:58.370 align:start position:0%
number of
um

01:08:58.370 --> 01:08:58.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:00.829 --> 01:09:00.839 align:start position:0%
immigrants who come to our country
 
01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
whether as refugees or through other
 
01:09:07.789 --> 01:09:07.799 align:start position:0%
channels who may not have fully
 
01:09:10.789 --> 01:09:10.799 align:start position:0%
understood all of our laws and May
 
01:09:13.849 --> 01:09:13.859 align:start position:0%
inadvertently violate this law because
 
01:09:15.769 --> 01:09:15.779 align:start position:0%
it's not similar to something in their
 
01:09:16.970 --> 01:09:16.980 align:start position:0%
own country
 
01:09:20.689 --> 01:09:20.699 align:start position:0%
and that for them to to
 
01:09:20.699 --> 01:09:21.410 align:start position:0%
and that for them to to
um

01:09:21.410 --> 01:09:21.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:24.530 --> 01:09:24.540 align:start position:0%
be convicted I believe it's right now uh
 
01:09:26.930 --> 01:09:26.940 align:start position:0%
felony it's something high level for a
 
01:09:28.309 --> 01:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
first offense at this point I don't I
 
01:09:29.689 --> 01:09:29.699 align:start position:0%
believe the penalty currently is too
 
01:09:32.030 --> 01:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
strong I also think about the fact that
 
01:09:34.249 --> 01:09:34.259 align:start position:0%
I have a teenager who's learning to
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
drive and
 
01:09:37.849 --> 01:09:37.859 align:start position:0%
um it's hypothetically possible that we
 
01:09:39.410 --> 01:09:39.420 align:start position:0%
might have started before the day she
 
01:09:41.090 --> 01:09:41.100 align:start position:0%
turned 15 and a half
 
01:09:44.030 --> 01:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
and this law would technically put her
 
01:09:46.189 --> 01:09:46.199 align:start position:0%
in the same category
 
01:09:48.050 --> 01:09:48.060 align:start position:0%
um for in terms of the levels of
 
01:09:50.269 --> 01:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
violations and I
 
01:09:57.290 --> 01:09:57.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:59.330 --> 01:09:59.340 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
01:10:01.490 --> 01:10:01.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:10:05.330 --> 01:10:05.340 align:start position:0%
um I believe that we should well I will
 
01:10:07.430 --> 01:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
be voting against the itl I believe that
 
01:10:09.470 --> 01:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
this bill should be ought to pass
 
01:10:12.010 --> 01:10:12.020 align:start position:0%
um as the wording
 
01:10:14.330 --> 01:10:14.340 align:start position:0%
allows for
 
01:10:18.229 --> 01:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
further to increase penalties for those
 
01:10:20.290 --> 01:10:20.300 align:start position:0%
who have repeated offenses against
 
01:10:23.270 --> 01:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
driving without a license but it would
 
01:10:26.050 --> 01:10:26.060 align:start position:0%
only change the first time violation
 
01:10:30.290 --> 01:10:30.300 align:start position:0%
to not be a Class B misdemeanor and I
 
01:10:32.350 --> 01:10:32.360 align:start position:0%
think that allows for understandable
 
01:10:35.209 --> 01:10:35.219 align:start position:0%
mistakes such as a teenager taking out
 
01:10:37.490 --> 01:10:37.500 align:start position:0%
their parents car or someone forgetting
 
01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
to renew their license I don't think
 
01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
someone who you know forgets to renew
 
01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
their license should get a Class B
 
01:10:44.930 --> 01:10:44.940 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor for being busy during the
 
01:10:47.290 --> 01:10:47.300 align:start position:0%
normal business hours that a DMV is open
 
01:10:50.630 --> 01:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
and I think lowering the initial penalty
 
01:10:52.490 --> 01:10:52.500 align:start position:0%
and leaving the increased penalty for
 
01:10:54.649 --> 01:10:54.659 align:start position:0%
repeated offenses is a good way to
 
01:10:57.950 --> 01:10:57.960 align:start position:0%
logically address this
 
01:11:00.709 --> 01:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
I would just um point out to the members
 
01:11:03.890 --> 01:11:03.900 align:start position:0%
who have spoken that currently if you do
 
01:11:05.990 --> 01:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
make that mistake or your teenager makes
 
01:11:08.209 --> 01:11:08.219 align:start position:0%
that mistake or a new arrival to our
 
01:11:10.130 --> 01:11:10.140 align:start position:0%
country makes that mistake the first
 
01:11:12.169 --> 01:11:12.179 align:start position:0%
offense is a violation it's not a
 
01:11:14.330 --> 01:11:14.340 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor not a felony it's a
 
01:11:17.110 --> 01:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
violation which is just a fine
 
01:11:20.450 --> 01:11:20.460 align:start position:0%
so really that is not something that
 
01:11:22.490 --> 01:11:22.500 align:start position:0%
would be alleviated by this bill under
 
01:11:24.890 --> 01:11:24.900 align:start position:0%
the current one
 
01:11:27.410 --> 01:11:27.420 align:start position:0%
no this is the old text that's this is
 
01:11:29.590 --> 01:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
the new
 
01:11:32.689 --> 01:11:32.699 align:start position:0%
so just um asking that you keep that in
 
01:11:32.699 --> 01:11:33.890 align:start position:0%
so just um asking that you keep that in
mind

01:11:33.890 --> 01:11:33.900 align:start position:0%
mind
 
01:11:36.050 --> 01:11:36.060 align:start position:0%
and compare the two versions of the bill
 
01:11:38.630 --> 01:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
before you make your mind representative
 
01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:40.310 align:start position:0%
before you make your mind representative

I have a friend who uh became a citizen
 
01:11:44.990 --> 01:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
part of the naturalization process was
 
01:11:46.850 --> 01:11:46.860 align:start position:0%
for them to learn the laws and a lot of
 
01:11:49.189 --> 01:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
the taxes they have to pay and that's a
 
01:11:50.570 --> 01:11:50.580 align:start position:0%
big section of what they have to learn
 
01:11:52.430 --> 01:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
is make sure they pay their taxes make
 
01:11:55.550 --> 01:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
sure they uh follow the laws so that's
 
01:11:57.229 --> 01:11:57.239 align:start position:0%
part of the naturalization process that
 
01:11:58.430 --> 01:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
he went through and it was very
 
01:12:00.050 --> 01:12:00.060 align:start position:0%
important that you go through that
 
01:12:02.450 --> 01:12:02.460 align:start position:0%
process without that process this could
 
01:12:02.460 --> 01:12:03.410 align:start position:0%
process without that process this could
happen

01:12:03.410 --> 01:12:03.420 align:start position:0%
happen
 
01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:11.630 --> 01:12:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:15.649 --> 01:12:15.659 align:start position:0%
my concern would not be is mostly for
 
01:12:17.450 --> 01:12:17.460 align:start position:0%
the people that were brought to this
 
01:12:20.689 --> 01:12:20.699 align:start position:0%
country when they were infants or or no
 
01:12:23.450 --> 01:12:23.460 align:start position:0%
so and do not have the capability
 
01:12:26.090 --> 01:12:26.100 align:start position:0%
to get a driver's license legally that I
 
01:12:27.470 --> 01:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
know of there may be some states that
 
01:12:29.090 --> 01:12:29.100 align:start position:0%
have passed laws that allowed them to
 
01:12:30.890 --> 01:12:30.900 align:start position:0%
have driver's license which I think is
 
01:12:32.330 --> 01:12:32.340 align:start position:0%
the correct
 
01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
thing to do so therefore I'm I'm going
 
01:12:38.209 --> 01:12:38.219 align:start position:0%
to vote
 
01:12:41.950 --> 01:12:41.960 align:start position:0%
and I have to remember which way that is
 
01:12:44.470 --> 01:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
I will take you away
 
01:12:47.209 --> 01:12:47.219 align:start position:0%
I will vote
 
01:12:49.550 --> 01:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:12:55.310 --> 01:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:59.149 --> 01:12:59.159 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Newell
 
01:13:00.410 --> 01:13:00.420 align:start position:0%
yeah I would agree I'm going to vote
 
01:13:03.290 --> 01:13:03.300 align:start position:0%
against the itl um and I think you know
 
01:13:05.750 --> 01:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
I I consider it essentially a clerical
 
01:13:07.669 --> 01:13:07.679 align:start position:0%
error one that I've been guilty of many
 
01:13:07.679 --> 01:13:08.990 align:start position:0%
error one that I've been guilty of many
times

01:13:08.990 --> 01:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
times
 
01:13:11.450 --> 01:13:11.460 align:start position:0%
um there are so many situations in which
 
01:13:14.630 --> 01:13:14.640 align:start position:0%
just forgetting to forgetting to go to
 
01:13:17.270 --> 01:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
the DMV not having the the money to
 
01:13:19.010 --> 01:13:19.020 align:start position:0%
renew your license um there's a variety
 
01:13:20.750 --> 01:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
of reasons why someone would just
 
01:13:22.250 --> 01:13:22.260 align:start position:0%
innocently not be able to renew their
 
01:13:23.570 --> 01:13:23.580 align:start position:0%
license or
 
01:13:26.990 --> 01:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
um or uh you know be on the app it up
 
01:13:28.790 --> 01:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
paperwork wise I mean at the end of the
 
01:13:31.610 --> 01:13:31.620 align:start position:0%
day it's paperwork so yeah I think
 
01:13:33.410 --> 01:13:33.420 align:start position:0%
lowering the lowering the penalties and
 
01:13:35.149 --> 01:13:35.159 align:start position:0%
understanding that there are so many
 
01:13:37.310 --> 01:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
different reasons without
 
01:13:38.570 --> 01:13:38.580 align:start position:0%
um putting someone in the situation
 
01:13:39.709 --> 01:13:39.719 align:start position:0%
where they have to demonstrate those
 
01:13:42.229 --> 01:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
reasons is probably the right default in
 
01:13:44.030 --> 01:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
my my opinion
 
01:14:23.270 --> 01:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:26.270 --> 01:14:26.280 align:start position:0%
is a sponsor of this bill present
 
01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:28.310 align:start position:0%
is a sponsor of this bill present
no

01:14:28.310 --> 01:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:14:29.990 --> 01:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
the committee would like to invite you
 
01:14:32.510 --> 01:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
to uh if you wouldn't mind
 
01:14:35.570 --> 01:14:35.580 align:start position:0%
um as we're having a little confusion
 
01:14:40.010 --> 01:14:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:41.930 --> 01:14:41.940 align:start position:0%
and here I was trying to thank you Mr

Grafton uh count Grafton 14 now it
 
01:14:53.090 --> 01:14:53.100 align:start position:0%
changed for the last redistricting which
 
01:14:56.270 --> 01:14:56.280 align:start position:0%
is Ward 2. I am the prime sponsor of
 
01:14:57.649 --> 01:14:57.659 align:start position:0%
this bill and thank you for
 
01:15:01.310 --> 01:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
consideration I actually tried to be a
 
01:15:03.709 --> 01:15:03.719 align:start position:0%
little bit Incognito my only purpose in
 
01:15:06.050 --> 01:15:06.060 align:start position:0%
coming this morning was to
 
01:15:08.450 --> 01:15:08.460 align:start position:0%
um Mr chairman you were kind enough to
 
01:15:12.110 --> 01:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
understand that because of various uh
 
01:15:14.930 --> 01:15:14.940 align:start position:0%
personal medical issues for family I was
 
01:15:16.610 --> 01:15:16.620 align:start position:0%
not able to come and introduce the bill
 
01:15:19.729 --> 01:15:19.739 align:start position:0%
originally and I wanted to show respect
 
01:15:21.709 --> 01:15:21.719 align:start position:0%
to the committee that
 
01:15:21.719 --> 01:15:22.370 align:start position:0%
to the committee that
um

01:15:22.370 --> 01:15:22.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:24.290 --> 01:15:24.300 align:start position:0%
it matters to me what you're trying to
 
01:15:26.390 --> 01:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
do here and that that's why I showed up
 
01:15:28.729 --> 01:15:28.739 align:start position:0%
today if you had some questions I don't
 
01:15:31.010 --> 01:15:31.020 align:start position:0%
have a copy of the bill with me I'll try
 
01:15:33.410 --> 01:15:33.420 align:start position:0%
to answer them if you wish
 
01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:34.010 align:start position:0%
to answer them if you wish
um

01:15:34.010 --> 01:15:34.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:37.550 --> 01:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
but anyways there we are
 
01:15:39.590 --> 01:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
would anyone like to inquire of the
 
01:15:43.070 --> 01:15:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:45.470 --> 01:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
am I correct in my understanding of the
 
01:15:49.070 --> 01:15:49.080 align:start position:0%
bill that it would change it so anyone
 
01:15:51.169 --> 01:15:51.179 align:start position:0%
who has never had a license in the state
 
01:15:52.790 --> 01:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire was pulled over for
 
01:15:55.250 --> 01:15:55.260 align:start position:0%
driving without you know that filed
 
01:15:58.270 --> 01:15:58.280 align:start position:0%
license would then only get a violation
 
01:16:01.370 --> 01:16:01.380 align:start position:0%
instead of a Class B misdemeanor and
 
01:16:03.649 --> 01:16:03.659 align:start position:0%
anyone who had a driver's license that
 
01:16:05.209 --> 01:16:05.219 align:start position:0%
would have expired it does not change
 
01:16:07.850 --> 01:16:07.860 align:start position:0%
the current law which is that they would
 
01:16:09.229 --> 01:16:09.239 align:start position:0%
only get a violation on a Class B
 
01:16:11.090 --> 01:16:11.100 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor so really it's only changing
 
01:16:13.310 --> 01:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
for those who have not had a license yet
 
01:16:17.030 --> 01:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
that is my understanding as well first
 
01:16:19.189 --> 01:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
time if your license expires and you get
 
01:16:21.229 --> 01:16:21.239 align:start position:0%
stopped for the first time it is still a
 
01:16:24.890 --> 01:16:24.900 align:start position:0%
violation if you continue to not get
 
01:16:26.450 --> 01:16:26.460 align:start position:0%
your driver's license then it would move
 
01:16:26.460 --> 01:16:27.250 align:start position:0%
your driver's license then it would move
into

01:16:27.250 --> 01:16:27.260 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:16:36.110 --> 01:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:37.910 --> 01:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy would you like to
 
01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:39.950 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy would you like to
inquire

01:16:39.950 --> 01:16:39.960 align:start position:0%
inquire
 
01:16:42.370 --> 01:16:42.380 align:start position:0%
nope 72 left
 
01:16:44.149 --> 01:16:44.159 align:start position:0%
representative Muse would you like to
 
01:16:46.370 --> 01:16:46.380 align:start position:0%
inquire the sponsor yes
 
01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
um for an undocumented person uh to
 
01:16:54.350 --> 01:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
actually uh be charged and convicted of
 
01:16:56.149 --> 01:16:56.159 align:start position:0%
a class B felony
 
01:16:58.130 --> 01:16:58.140 align:start position:0%
what does that do to their immigration
 
01:16:58.140 --> 01:17:01.010 align:start position:0%
what does that do to their immigration
status

01:17:01.010 --> 01:17:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:03.950 --> 01:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm sorry so there is a connection
 
01:17:07.250 --> 01:17:07.260 align:start position:0%
obviously if if a person were to be
 
01:17:10.189 --> 01:17:10.199 align:start position:0%
undocumented and be stopped and then
 
01:17:12.110 --> 01:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
charged with not having a driver's
 
01:17:14.330 --> 01:17:14.340 align:start position:0%
license it would be a misdemeanor but
 
01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
they would then typically uh
 
01:17:21.729 --> 01:17:21.739 align:start position:0%
trickle down to uh
 
01:17:26.689 --> 01:17:26.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:28.490 --> 01:17:28.500 align:start position:0%
so far in the questions that have been
 
01:17:30.530 --> 01:17:30.540 align:start position:0%
asked and I'm not sure and my apologies
 
01:17:32.570 --> 01:17:32.580 align:start position:0%
I wasn't here for the hearing so I don't
 
01:17:34.310 --> 01:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
quite know what you you know we all
 
01:17:36.950 --> 01:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
heard that day but I would apparently
 
01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:41.930 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:17:41.930 --> 01:17:41.940 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:17:44.149 --> 01:17:44.159 align:start position:0%
um but I I would like to remind everyone
 
01:17:47.450 --> 01:17:47.460 align:start position:0%
too that one of the one of the issues
 
01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:48.590 align:start position:0%
too that one of the one of the issues
about

01:17:48.590 --> 01:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:17:51.430 --> 01:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
um driver's license issues is
 
01:17:54.649 --> 01:17:54.659 align:start position:0%
uh typically problems with keeping
 
01:17:56.810 --> 01:17:56.820 align:start position:0%
getting your driver's license on time or
 
01:18:00.010 --> 01:18:00.020 align:start position:0%
getting your license at all sometimes
 
01:18:02.810 --> 01:18:02.820 align:start position:0%
is a financial issue as well and there's
 
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
a certain amount of people who where it
 
01:18:08.930 --> 01:18:08.940 align:start position:0%
becomes more difficult if you're poor
 
01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
and this would help in that regard as
 
01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:12.430 align:start position:0%
and this would help in that regard as
well

01:18:12.430 --> 01:18:12.440 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:18:16.370 --> 01:18:16.380 align:start position:0%
not just it's not just about a narrowly
 
01:18:19.550 --> 01:18:19.560 align:start position:0%
defined issue but thank you for allowing
 
01:18:23.209 --> 01:18:23.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:25.010 --> 01:18:25.020 align:start position:0%
um representative Rhodes thank you Mr
 
01:18:25.020 --> 01:18:25.970 align:start position:0%
um representative Rhodes thank you Mr
chair

01:18:25.970 --> 01:18:25.980 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:18:27.950 --> 01:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
I I just want to confirm because it's my
 
01:18:30.169 --> 01:18:30.179 align:start position:0%
understanding you can renew your
 
01:18:31.910 --> 01:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
driver's license online now right you
 
01:18:34.010 --> 01:18:34.020 align:start position:0%
don't have to actually go during certain
 
01:18:34.020 --> 01:18:35.630 align:start position:0%
don't have to actually go during certain
hours

01:18:35.630 --> 01:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
hours
 
01:18:37.370 --> 01:18:37.380 align:start position:0%
to the DMV while they're open is that
 
01:18:39.770 --> 01:18:39.780 align:start position:0%
yes you are you can't thank you for the
 
01:18:39.780 --> 01:18:40.729 align:start position:0%
yes you are you can't thank you for the
question

01:18:40.729 --> 01:18:40.739 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:18:42.530 --> 01:18:42.540 align:start position:0%
um you can renew your driver's license
 
01:18:47.330 --> 01:18:47.340 align:start position:0%
once online you can't do it forever
 
01:18:50.450 --> 01:18:50.460 align:start position:0%
um but you can do it once
 
01:18:52.610 --> 01:18:52.620 align:start position:0%
look at the representative Hill who's on
 
01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
Transportation with me so representative
 
01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:56.149 align:start position:0%
Transportation with me so representative
Newell

01:18:56.149 --> 01:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
Newell
 
01:18:58.370 --> 01:18:58.380 align:start position:0%
I I would just acknowledge that while
 
01:19:01.669 --> 01:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
these things seem like small barriers of
 
01:19:04.430 --> 01:19:04.440 align:start position:0%
you know online access the financial
 
01:19:07.010 --> 01:19:07.020 align:start position:0%
barrier I mean these are impediments to
 
01:19:08.990 --> 01:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
people in difficult situations well
 
01:19:10.430 --> 01:19:10.440 align:start position:0%
maybe none of us on this committee have
 
01:19:12.290 --> 01:19:12.300 align:start position:0%
been in a situation where that was
 
01:19:15.590 --> 01:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
significant enough to be a a significant
 
01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
barrier to you but I've been in that
 
01:19:19.850 --> 01:19:19.860 align:start position:0%
situation in the past so I mean I just I
 
01:19:21.290 --> 01:19:21.300 align:start position:0%
think it's it's good to take that into
 
01:19:23.030 --> 01:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
account not everybody has the means that
 
01:19:26.270 --> 01:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
that we necessarily do okay uh thank you
 
01:19:29.270 --> 01:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
for your assistance and
 
01:19:31.130 --> 01:19:31.140 align:start position:0%
representative Newman would you like to
 
01:19:33.169 --> 01:19:33.179 align:start position:0%
inquire I just have one one question
 
01:19:34.790 --> 01:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
about something that you testified to
 
01:19:37.669 --> 01:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
that if someone does not have a license
 
01:19:39.470 --> 01:19:39.480 align:start position:0%
and they are stopped for the first time
 
01:19:41.930 --> 01:19:41.940 align:start position:0%
did you say that was a misdemeanor or
 
01:19:43.669 --> 01:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
could be a misdemeanor somehow because
 
01:19:45.470 --> 01:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
of another law and I'm thinking that
 
01:19:49.729 --> 01:19:49.739 align:start position:0%
might no yes an expired first stop is a
 
01:19:52.370 --> 01:19:52.380 align:start position:0%
violation but a no driver's license
 
01:19:55.490 --> 01:19:55.500 align:start position:0%
first time my understanding is that it's
 
01:19:58.550 --> 01:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
a would move to misdemeanor and one the
 
01:20:00.229 --> 01:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
only other thing if I if you would
 
01:20:02.090 --> 01:20:02.100 align:start position:0%
indulge me Mr chairman you've been so
 
01:20:02.100 --> 01:20:03.229 align:start position:0%
indulge me Mr chairman you've been so
kind

01:20:03.229 --> 01:20:03.239 align:start position:0%
kind
 
01:20:07.189 --> 01:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
um this bill came about as a result of a
 
01:20:09.890 --> 01:20:09.900 align:start position:0%
study committee that Transportation
 
01:20:09.900 --> 01:20:11.330 align:start position:0%
study committee that Transportation
undertook

01:20:11.330 --> 01:20:11.340 align:start position:0%
undertook
 
01:20:14.390 --> 01:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
and the one of the participants the in
 
01:20:17.510 --> 01:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
fact the primary driver between behind
 
01:20:22.490 --> 01:20:22.500 align:start position:0%
this was chief justice Nadu who this was
 
01:20:24.530 --> 01:20:24.540 align:start position:0%
one of her recommendations that the
 
01:20:26.750 --> 01:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
legislature try and achieve this purpose
 
01:20:29.990 --> 01:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
and so there was a lot going on why this
 
01:20:32.570 --> 01:20:32.580 align:start position:0%
bill has been introduced and thank you
 
01:20:35.209 --> 01:20:35.219 align:start position:0%
and again I I appreciate everyone's
 
01:20:36.950 --> 01:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
Indulgence and thank you to the
 
01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:38.090 align:start position:0%
Indulgence and thank you to the
committee

01:20:38.090 --> 01:20:38.100 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:20:41.689 --> 01:20:41.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:43.729 --> 01:20:43.739 align:start position:0%
also thank you to the transportation
 
01:20:45.649 --> 01:20:45.659 align:start position:0%
committee study committee to give a bill
 
01:20:47.450 --> 01:20:47.460 align:start position:0%
to criminal justice that was very kind
 
01:20:52.550 --> 01:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:55.850 --> 01:20:55.860 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative Manion
 
01:20:57.770 --> 01:20:57.780 align:start position:0%
just some clarification this is how I
 
01:20:59.689 --> 01:20:59.699 align:start position:0%
understand the current bill is if you're
 
01:21:01.550 --> 01:21:01.560 align:start position:0%
expired which you have a license that's
 
01:21:03.890 --> 01:21:03.900 align:start position:0%
just expired your first offense of the
 
01:21:05.990 --> 01:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
violation second offense will be a Class
 
01:21:08.030 --> 01:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
B misdemeanor in a 12-month period I
 
01:21:10.130 --> 01:21:10.140 align:start position:0%
believe it is
 
01:21:12.169 --> 01:21:12.179 align:start position:0%
the current bill also says that if
 
01:21:13.729 --> 01:21:13.739 align:start position:0%
you've never had a license and you're
 
01:21:13.739 --> 01:21:14.630 align:start position:0%
you've never had a license and you're
driving

01:21:14.630 --> 01:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
driving
 
01:21:16.970 --> 01:21:16.980 align:start position:0%
without regard to getting a license that
 
01:21:18.770 --> 01:21:18.780 align:start position:0%
first offense is a B misdemeanor this
 
01:21:21.590 --> 01:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
law moves to change that so that in both
 
01:21:24.110 --> 01:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
cases it's a violation for first offense
 
01:21:26.689 --> 01:21:26.699 align:start position:0%
B misdemeanor for second offense I don't
 
01:21:29.149 --> 01:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
know if that clarifies it for people it
 
01:21:31.430 --> 01:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't and I would um my comment on
 
01:21:33.649 --> 01:21:33.659 align:start position:0%
that is I don't think that we should be
 
01:21:35.770 --> 01:21:35.780 align:start position:0%
treating people who went to the trouble
 
01:21:38.510 --> 01:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
to get their driver's license go to
 
01:21:40.310 --> 01:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
Driving School spend enormous amount of
 
01:21:42.350 --> 01:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
money to do that and go through the
 
01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:43.610 align:start position:0%
money to do that and go through the
process

01:21:43.610 --> 01:21:43.620 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:21:45.470 --> 01:21:45.480 align:start position:0%
the same as someone who never bothered
 
01:21:47.689 --> 01:21:47.699 align:start position:0%
to do any of those things
 
01:21:50.149 --> 01:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
um one is a misdemeanor because they
 
01:21:53.470 --> 01:21:53.480 align:start position:0%
never even acknowledge the the
 
01:21:55.790 --> 01:21:55.800 align:start position:0%
responsibility to get a driver's license
 
01:21:58.930 --> 01:21:58.940 align:start position:0%
which puts the entire motoring public
 
01:22:01.490 --> 01:22:01.500 align:start position:0%
danger because they obviously aren't
 
01:22:03.590 --> 01:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
insured if you operate a motor vehicle
 
01:22:05.750 --> 01:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
with no driver's license it's dubious as
 
01:22:06.950 --> 01:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
to whether or not the insurance company
 
01:22:08.570 --> 01:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
will cover you in an event of an
 
01:22:11.330 --> 01:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
accident so there are a lot of things I
 
01:22:13.310 --> 01:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
understand the the impact it can have on
 
01:22:15.050 --> 01:22:15.060 align:start position:0%
someone who who may be new to the
 
01:22:16.850 --> 01:22:16.860 align:start position:0%
country or into the country on in an
 
01:22:20.030 --> 01:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
undocumented status but we as a policy
 
01:22:22.490 --> 01:22:22.500 align:start position:0%
committee should not be writing laws to
 
01:22:25.010 --> 01:22:25.020 align:start position:0%
accommodate people who aren't who aren't
 
01:22:26.930 --> 01:22:26.940 align:start position:0%
necessarily here following the rules
 
01:22:29.209 --> 01:22:29.219 align:start position:0%
because they don't understand it I mean
 
01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
I I have empathy for that situation but
 
01:22:34.189 --> 01:22:34.199 align:start position:0%
at the same time I have empathy for the
 
01:22:35.990 --> 01:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
motoring public who could be injured by
 
01:22:38.270 --> 01:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
someone and have no insurance to cover
 
01:22:40.990 --> 01:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
them if they are their family or her
 
01:22:43.910 --> 01:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
01:22:45.709 --> 01:22:45.719 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:22:46.970 --> 01:22:46.980 align:start position:0%
um I would just like to share with the
 
01:22:48.590 --> 01:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
committee um some of my own personal
 
01:22:50.930 --> 01:22:50.940 align:start position:0%
experience with this I was homeschooled
 
01:22:52.370 --> 01:22:52.380 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire and I grew up in a
 
01:22:55.010 --> 01:22:55.020 align:start position:0%
rural area and I since I was
 
01:22:57.530 --> 01:22:57.540 align:start position:0%
homeschooled I didn't have access to
 
01:22:59.270 --> 01:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
um driving school at Public School my
 
01:23:00.770 --> 01:23:00.780 align:start position:0%
parents didn't have the money to pay for
 
01:23:02.570 --> 01:23:02.580 align:start position:0%
me to go to
 
01:23:04.189 --> 01:23:04.199 align:start position:0%
um Drivers School
 
01:23:06.169 --> 01:23:06.179 align:start position:0%
and so I didn't get my license until I
 
01:23:09.890 --> 01:23:09.900 align:start position:0%
was 19. and even though I mostly biked
 
01:23:12.530 --> 01:23:12.540 align:start position:0%
or walked everywhere occasionally I did
 
01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
have to under extreme circumstances
 
01:23:17.649 --> 01:23:17.659 align:start position:0%
drive my parents car without a license
 
01:23:20.270 --> 01:23:20.280 align:start position:0%
and I did get pulled over once but
 
01:23:22.310 --> 01:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
because I was driving safely and the
 
01:23:23.630 --> 01:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
cops knew me
 
01:23:26.390 --> 01:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
um I was not charged with anything but
 
01:23:27.890 --> 01:23:27.900 align:start position:0%
um I would just like to remind the
 
01:23:30.890 --> 01:23:30.900 align:start position:0%
committee that this definitely impacts
 
01:23:32.930 --> 01:23:32.940 align:start position:0%
young people in New Hampshire especially
 
01:23:34.490 --> 01:23:34.500 align:start position:0%
in these rural areas especially those
 
01:23:36.050 --> 01:23:36.060 align:start position:0%
who are homeschooled who don't have
 
01:23:37.669 --> 01:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
access to driving school or for other
 
01:23:39.770 --> 01:23:39.780 align:start position:0%
reasons may be not able to get their
 
01:23:42.709 --> 01:23:42.719 align:start position:0%
license until they're older
 
01:23:46.070 --> 01:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
I I agree and I I actually supported a
 
01:23:47.870 --> 01:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
bill that would allow parents to um
 
01:23:50.330 --> 01:23:50.340 align:start position:0%
legally Legally give driver's EDS but
 
01:23:54.050 --> 01:23:54.060 align:start position:0%
that meant an unfortunate demise uh um I
 
01:23:56.510 --> 01:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
would I would agree with you I too grew
 
01:23:59.270 --> 01:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
up in a small community I never got my
 
01:24:02.450 --> 01:24:02.460 align:start position:0%
driver's license until I actually joined
 
01:24:04.970 --> 01:24:04.980 align:start position:0%
the army and I got my first driver's
 
01:24:08.450 --> 01:24:08.460 align:start position:0%
license I believe it was an m577 tank
 
01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
um that I was first licensed to drive in
 
01:24:14.030 --> 01:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
in yeah and then um a Jeep and a Humvee
 
01:24:15.410 --> 01:24:15.420 align:start position:0%
and several other things the point being
 
01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
I didn't have the money for any of that
 
01:24:18.050 --> 01:24:18.060 align:start position:0%
and I ended up getting it in the
 
01:24:20.630 --> 01:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
military first but to think that we
 
01:24:22.550 --> 01:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
would say well you know it's tough so
 
01:24:24.470 --> 01:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
there's certain people you don't have to
 
01:24:26.810 --> 01:24:26.820 align:start position:0%
it's it's extremely troubling and again
 
01:24:28.430 --> 01:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
I go back to the insurance issue that
 
01:24:30.530 --> 01:24:30.540 align:start position:0%
really worries me is if you end up with
 
01:24:33.410 --> 01:24:33.420 align:start position:0%
a child in another vehicle who was
 
01:24:34.790 --> 01:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
equally as poor as the person who
 
01:24:36.470 --> 01:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
couldn't afford to get their license now
 
01:24:38.090 --> 01:24:38.100 align:start position:0%
is a paraplegic for the rest of their
 
01:24:39.830 --> 01:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
life and how is that family going to
 
01:24:41.030 --> 01:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
afford to take care of that child with
 
01:24:42.590 --> 01:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
no insurance coverage because the other
 
01:24:44.689 --> 01:24:44.699 align:start position:0%
a person decided that they didn't need
 
01:24:45.910 --> 01:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
to get a license
 
01:24:48.709 --> 01:24:48.719 align:start position:0%
representative salic
 
01:24:51.410 --> 01:24:51.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:24:53.149 --> 01:24:53.159 align:start position:0%
I would like to add for for several
 
01:24:55.070 --> 01:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
years the University of New
 
01:24:57.350 --> 01:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
hip did a partnership with a university
 
01:25:00.350 --> 01:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
in China where we had a huge number of
 
01:25:03.229 --> 01:25:03.239 align:start position:0%
students coming and in their country
 
01:25:05.270 --> 01:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses are not part of their
 
01:25:07.130 --> 01:25:07.140 align:start position:0%
culture at all so these students came
 
01:25:10.610 --> 01:25:10.620 align:start position:0%
here and truly did not know based on
 
01:25:13.729 --> 01:25:13.739 align:start position:0%
their experience so we had a series of
 
01:25:15.530 --> 01:25:15.540 align:start position:0%
circumstances of them driving not
 
01:25:17.030 --> 01:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily safely and they were all
 
01:25:19.310 --> 01:25:19.320 align:start position:0%
stopped for that and it was determined
 
01:25:21.290 --> 01:25:21.300 align:start position:0%
that they did not understand
 
01:25:23.209 --> 01:25:23.219 align:start position:0%
based on the immigration process all of
 
01:25:24.709 --> 01:25:24.719 align:start position:0%
which was done completely legally with
 
01:25:26.870 --> 01:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
visas and all of the due process that
 
01:25:29.330 --> 01:25:29.340 align:start position:0%
was appropriate but they no one had had
 
01:25:31.490 --> 01:25:31.500 align:start position:0%
given them the information they weren't
 
01:25:34.570 --> 01:25:34.580 align:start position:0%
trying to evade anything but a
 
01:25:37.070 --> 01:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor for something like that
 
01:25:38.990 --> 01:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
would have compromised their visas
 
01:25:41.570 --> 01:25:41.580 align:start position:0%
forced them not to be able to pay their
 
01:25:44.090 --> 01:25:44.100 align:start position:0%
extensive high-level tuition to UNH
 
01:25:47.390 --> 01:25:47.400 align:start position:0%
among other things and so an education
 
01:25:49.070 --> 01:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
plan was put in place so that when they
 
01:25:50.630 --> 01:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
arrived there was a whole program in
 
01:25:52.130 --> 01:25:52.140 align:start position:0%
order to teach them and educate them so
 
01:25:54.890 --> 01:25:54.900 align:start position:0%
it stopped the practice again to give
 
01:25:57.890 --> 01:25:57.900 align:start position:0%
them a a misdemeanor for something that
 
01:25:59.209 --> 01:25:59.219 align:start position:0%
really should have been a violation that
 
01:26:00.350 --> 01:26:00.360 align:start position:0%
could be used as an educational
 
01:26:03.290 --> 01:26:03.300 align:start position:0%
experience was really the most was not
 
01:26:05.930 --> 01:26:05.940 align:start position:0%
would not have been appropriate so again
 
01:26:07.250 --> 01:26:07.260 align:start position:0%
there are all sorts of different
 
01:26:09.229 --> 01:26:09.239 align:start position:0%
circumstances I don't dispute that there
 
01:26:11.629 --> 01:26:11.639 align:start position:0%
are people who knowingly violate this
 
01:26:13.550 --> 01:26:13.560 align:start position:0%
law and violate it on a regular basis
 
01:26:15.770 --> 01:26:15.780 align:start position:0%
which is why for second third and fourth
 
01:26:17.270 --> 01:26:17.280 align:start position:0%
offenses I think there's a it's
 
01:26:18.770 --> 01:26:18.780 align:start position:0%
appropriate to have much steeper
 
01:26:20.689 --> 01:26:20.699 align:start position:0%
penalties but I do believe that people
 
01:26:23.090 --> 01:26:23.100 align:start position:0%
should be a 4 an opportunity to
 
01:26:25.189 --> 01:26:25.199 align:start position:0%
understand okay I violated this
 
01:26:27.290 --> 01:26:27.300 align:start position:0%
particular provision
 
01:26:30.050 --> 01:26:30.060 align:start position:0%
whether knowingly or unknowingly but not
 
01:26:31.430 --> 01:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
with the intent of harming someone
 
01:26:33.110 --> 01:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
obviously if they're driving recklessly
 
01:26:34.490 --> 01:26:34.500 align:start position:0%
that's a whole separate set of
 
01:26:36.110 --> 01:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
conditions that's different from just
 
01:26:39.050 --> 01:26:39.060 align:start position:0%
not having your physical license and so
 
01:26:40.970 --> 01:26:40.980 align:start position:0%
if someone is driving recklessly that
 
01:26:43.129 --> 01:26:43.139 align:start position:0%
they should be certainly charged with
 
01:26:45.290 --> 01:26:45.300 align:start position:0%
that as a separate
 
01:26:47.390 --> 01:26:47.400 align:start position:0%
um whatever the word is I'm sorry my
 
01:26:49.610 --> 01:26:49.620 align:start position:0%
offense thank you sorry I haven't had
 
01:26:51.169 --> 01:26:51.179 align:start position:0%
enough coffee today
 
01:26:53.570 --> 01:26:53.580 align:start position:0%
um and we should recognize that but but
 
01:26:56.810 --> 01:26:56.820 align:start position:0%
this specific thing I I believe this I
 
01:26:59.030 --> 01:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
support that this should pass
 
01:27:02.149 --> 01:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
thank you I I understand about the
 
01:27:04.370 --> 01:27:04.380 align:start position:0%
Chinese immigrants that's interesting um
 
01:27:06.229 --> 01:27:06.239 align:start position:0%
that they don't in their culture don't
 
01:27:07.490 --> 01:27:07.500 align:start position:0%
have to have that apparently they don't
 
01:27:09.770 --> 01:27:09.780 align:start position:0%
have um anything about floating giant
 
01:27:11.330 --> 01:27:11.340 align:start position:0%
spy balloons over our country either
 
01:27:13.189 --> 01:27:13.199 align:start position:0%
because there's one over Montana right
 
01:27:15.890 --> 01:27:15.900 align:start position:0%
now I I would say that that is well that
 
01:27:17.570 --> 01:27:17.580 align:start position:0%
is true and probably not relevant we
 
01:27:20.030 --> 01:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
also have a huge number of spy
 
01:27:21.890 --> 01:27:21.900 align:start position:0%
elements of our own over their country
 
01:27:24.410 --> 01:27:24.420 align:start position:0%
and I they do not hesitate to shoot them
 
01:27:26.390 --> 01:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
down uh representative Stone
 
01:27:28.430 --> 01:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'd like to remind
 
01:27:30.290 --> 01:27:30.300 align:start position:0%
the committee that the reason to get a
 
01:27:32.270 --> 01:27:32.280 align:start position:0%
license is it measures your knowledge
 
01:27:34.010 --> 01:27:34.020 align:start position:0%
you have to pass a written test and
 
01:27:35.629 --> 01:27:35.639 align:start position:0%
additionally you have to pass a
 
01:27:37.729 --> 01:27:37.739 align:start position:0%
practical test to make sure that you are
 
01:27:39.890 --> 01:27:39.900 align:start position:0%
safe and roadworthy those two
 
01:27:41.270 --> 01:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
requirements are very important to be
 
01:27:43.729 --> 01:27:43.739 align:start position:0%
issued a license I think by negating
 
01:27:46.010 --> 01:27:46.020 align:start position:0%
that you would be creating a really
 
01:27:47.570 --> 01:27:47.580 align:start position:0%
hazardous condition for Public Safety
 
01:27:50.209 --> 01:27:50.219 align:start position:0%
overall thank you
 
01:27:53.030 --> 01:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
I think representative Reed thank you Mr
 
01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:54.050 align:start position:0%
I think representative Reed thank you Mr
chairman

01:27:54.050 --> 01:27:54.060 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:27:55.970 --> 01:27:55.980 align:start position:0%
um just because somebody gets stopped
 
01:27:59.450 --> 01:27:59.460 align:start position:0%
and perhaps you know get a misdemeanor
 
01:28:01.310 --> 01:28:01.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean they're going to tell it to
 
01:28:03.590 --> 01:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
the judge and it doesn't mean it's going
 
01:28:06.649 --> 01:28:06.659 align:start position:0%
to stick so if those chain if the the
 
01:28:08.149 --> 01:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
people who were stopped without a
 
01:28:10.910 --> 01:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
license felt that they did it the judge
 
01:28:13.189 --> 01:28:13.199 align:start position:0%
can make the determination correct
 
01:28:16.129 --> 01:28:16.139 align:start position:0%
yes that's correct just because it says
 
01:28:17.570 --> 01:28:17.580 align:start position:0%
here that's the punishment does not by
 
01:28:18.830 --> 01:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
any stretch of the imagination I mean
 
01:28:20.629 --> 01:28:20.639 align:start position:0%
it's actually going to happen
 
01:28:22.010 --> 01:28:22.020 align:start position:0%
um I think the police would be the first
 
01:28:23.870 --> 01:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
to agree with that and so you have
 
01:28:25.310 --> 01:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
several levels of discretion the police
 
01:28:27.050 --> 01:28:27.060 align:start position:0%
officer can use his discretion not to
 
01:28:29.290 --> 01:28:29.300 align:start position:0%
write a citation or or make the
 
01:28:31.790 --> 01:28:31.800 align:start position:0%
complaint you have the district attorney
 
01:28:33.830 --> 01:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
who might also null across the complaint
 
01:28:35.629 --> 01:28:35.639 align:start position:0%
then you have the judge who might say
 
01:28:37.850 --> 01:28:37.860 align:start position:0%
okay so you've got three levels at least
 
01:28:40.370 --> 01:28:40.380 align:start position:0%
of people who are going to look at that
 
01:28:42.229 --> 01:28:42.239 align:start position:0%
who could say okay this is you know
 
01:28:44.689 --> 01:28:44.699 align:start position:0%
clearly they didn't understand so for us
 
01:28:46.490 --> 01:28:46.500 align:start position:0%
to put a broad brush and say we're going
 
01:28:47.810 --> 01:28:47.820 align:start position:0%
to take that discretion away because we
 
01:28:50.090 --> 01:28:50.100 align:start position:0%
don't trust that system to me is uh
 
01:28:51.709 --> 01:28:51.719 align:start position:0%
disturbing representative Murray and
 
01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
that'll be the last one because I think
 
01:28:55.850 --> 01:28:55.860 align:start position:0%
we agree we're where we're at
 
01:28:57.590 --> 01:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:28:58.970 --> 01:28:58.980 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to emphasize to the
 
01:29:00.110 --> 01:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
committee the fact that this only
 
01:29:02.990 --> 01:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
addresses the first violation if there
 
01:29:04.729 --> 01:29:04.739 align:start position:0%
were another instance of driving without
 
01:29:06.890 --> 01:29:06.900 align:start position:0%
a license within a 12-month period they
 
01:29:08.870 --> 01:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
would get a Class B misdemeanor so this
 
01:29:10.669 --> 01:29:10.679 align:start position:0%
is not encouraging any type of
 
01:29:12.050 --> 01:29:12.060 align:start position:0%
conditions for people to be driving
 
01:29:14.030 --> 01:29:14.040 align:start position:0%
around without a license recklessly and
 
01:29:15.250 --> 01:29:15.260 align:start position:0%
getting pulled over and over again
 
01:29:18.610 --> 01:29:18.620 align:start position:0%
without consequences and also to address
 
01:29:20.810 --> 01:29:20.820 align:start position:0%
representative Muse's question earlier
 
01:29:22.250 --> 01:29:22.260 align:start position:0%
about how this might a Class B
 
01:29:24.649 --> 01:29:24.659 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor could impact immigrants it
 
01:29:27.649 --> 01:29:27.659 align:start position:0%
is not automatic grounds for
 
01:29:29.870 --> 01:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
um expulsion from the country but it can
 
01:29:32.870 --> 01:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:34.910 --> 01:29:34.920 align:start position:0%
thank you um I would ask the clerk to
 
01:29:37.610 --> 01:29:37.620 align:start position:0%
call the roll at this point
 
01:29:39.290 --> 01:29:39.300 align:start position:0%
and the motion on the floor is
 
01:29:43.310 --> 01:29:43.320 align:start position:0%

the motion fails
 
01:30:44.510 --> 01:30:44.520 align:start position:0%
I would remind you that it's open now to
 
01:30:46.129 --> 01:30:46.139 align:start position:0%
another motion however I would
 
01:30:48.110 --> 01:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
anticipate the vote will be exactly the
 
01:30:49.610 --> 01:30:49.620 align:start position:0%
same so
 
01:30:51.229 --> 01:30:51.239 align:start position:0%
um does anyone wish to make another
 
01:30:54.229 --> 01:30:54.239 align:start position:0%
motion representative salik I move the
 
01:31:03.890 --> 01:31:03.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:06.950 --> 01:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna put on my amazing crescan hat
 
01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:07.729 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna put on my amazing crescan hat
and

01:31:07.729 --> 01:31:07.739 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:31:21.229 --> 01:31:21.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:22.850 --> 01:31:22.860 align:start position:0%
representative selig would you like to
 
01:31:26.149 --> 01:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:28.010 --> 01:31:28.020 align:start position:0%
for all the reasons that I explained in
 
01:31:29.990 --> 01:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
our previous conversation that was very
 
01:31:32.209 --> 01:31:32.219 align:start position:0%
kind of you right representative Harriet
 
01:31:33.410 --> 01:31:33.420 align:start position:0%
gather right would you like to speak to
 
01:31:34.250 --> 01:31:34.260 align:start position:0%
you a second
 
01:31:37.070 --> 01:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
only just to remind you again that the
 
01:31:39.110 --> 01:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
committee again that um it's a first
 
01:31:41.750 --> 01:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
offense so I really think the violation
 
01:31:43.610 --> 01:31:43.620 align:start position:0%
was the correct
 
01:31:48.050 --> 01:31:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:50.030 --> 01:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
01:31:51.770 --> 01:31:51.780 align:start position:0%
I also would just uh thank you Mr chair
 
01:31:52.970 --> 01:31:52.980 align:start position:0%
I'd like to remind the committee that
 
01:31:55.070 --> 01:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
this bill came out of a study committee
 
01:31:57.530 --> 01:31:57.540 align:start position:0%
from the Transportation committee and I
 
01:31:59.090 --> 01:31:59.100 align:start position:0%
think that we can trust that they've
 
01:32:01.370 --> 01:32:01.380 align:start position:0%
done the work necessary
 
01:32:01.380 --> 01:32:02.030 align:start position:0%
done the work necessary
um

01:32:02.030 --> 01:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:04.010 --> 01:32:04.020 align:start position:0%
to study all these implications of this
 
01:32:04.020 --> 01:32:05.950 align:start position:0%
to study all these implications of this
bill

01:32:05.950 --> 01:32:05.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:32:11.270 --> 01:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:13.610 --> 01:32:13.620 align:start position:0%
I also wanted to just remind everybody
 
01:32:15.470 --> 01:32:15.480 align:start position:0%
really quickly that we're not talking
 
01:32:18.530 --> 01:32:18.540 align:start position:0%
about waving a penalty here so people
 
01:32:21.169 --> 01:32:21.179 align:start position:0%
who actually commit commit this crime
 
01:32:24.410 --> 01:32:24.420 align:start position:0%
are are not going to go unpunished
 
01:32:27.709 --> 01:32:27.719 align:start position:0%
um uh a violation it'll be a violation
 
01:32:29.570 --> 01:32:29.580 align:start position:0%
level offense and I and I think one of
 
01:32:31.729 --> 01:32:31.739 align:start position:0%
the reasons for us to to pretty strongly
 
01:32:34.250 --> 01:32:34.260 align:start position:0%
consider consider something like that is
 
01:32:36.830 --> 01:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
the impact that it can actually do to
 
01:32:39.010 --> 01:32:39.020 align:start position:0%
somebody's immigration status
 
01:32:41.149 --> 01:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
this is something that can get you sent
 
01:32:44.149 --> 01:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
out of the country and many times
 
01:32:46.550 --> 01:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
somebody who's new to the country is in
 
01:32:49.310 --> 01:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
a financial situation where maybe it's
 
01:32:51.229 --> 01:32:51.239 align:start position:0%
everything that they can afford to be
 
01:32:53.510 --> 01:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
able to buy a car and the only way
 
01:32:55.250 --> 01:32:55.260 align:start position:0%
they're going to make their car payments
 
01:32:57.530 --> 01:32:57.540 align:start position:0%
is if they're able to take that car to
 
01:32:58.970 --> 01:32:58.980 align:start position:0%
work and they can continue to be
 
01:33:02.450 --> 01:33:02.460 align:start position:0%
employed employed so it it's a it's a
 
01:33:04.850 --> 01:33:04.860 align:start position:0%
very difficult Balancing Act
 
01:33:08.030 --> 01:33:08.040 align:start position:0%
um that that folks have to go through
 
01:33:10.010 --> 01:33:10.020 align:start position:0%
um but just a reminder that if they're
 
01:33:12.709 --> 01:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
pulled over and there's stopped they're
 
01:33:15.110 --> 01:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
still subject to a penalty you know
 
01:33:17.510 --> 01:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
we're not this is not a you know the
 
01:33:19.129 --> 01:33:19.139 align:start position:0%
equivalent of a get out of jail free
 
01:33:21.830 --> 01:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
card but what I do think it is is a more
 
01:33:24.310 --> 01:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
a more sensible and appropriate penalty
 
01:33:26.990 --> 01:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
for somebody who's being charged for the
 
01:33:28.610 --> 01:33:28.620 align:start position:0%
first time and I think this is a
 
01:33:31.310 --> 01:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
question that really comes up a lot in
 
01:33:32.990 --> 01:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
in our committee when it comes to
 
01:33:35.750 --> 01:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
penalties for first-time offenders
 
01:33:37.610 --> 01:33:37.620 align:start position:0%
um you know to what extent do we want
 
01:33:40.370 --> 01:33:40.380 align:start position:0%
somebody who's a first-time offender to
 
01:33:42.709 --> 01:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
go through life with with a criminal
 
01:33:42.719 --> 01:33:44.209 align:start position:0%
go through life with with a criminal
record

01:33:44.209 --> 01:33:44.219 align:start position:0%
record
 
01:33:47.570 --> 01:33:47.580 align:start position:0%
um and is you know is is this is this
 
01:33:50.390 --> 01:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
offense really you know does does it
 
01:33:52.550 --> 01:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
reach that level and I know we've had
 
01:33:54.470 --> 01:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
extensive debate as to whether or not it
 
01:33:56.450 --> 01:33:56.460 align:start position:0%
does or not
 
01:33:58.729 --> 01:33:58.739 align:start position:0%
um but but I do think you know the fact
 
01:34:01.970 --> 01:34:01.980 align:start position:0%
that uh the fact that people are are
 
01:34:04.250 --> 01:34:04.260 align:start position:0%
going to be penalized is just something
 
01:34:07.610 --> 01:34:07.620 align:start position:0%
that we really do need to remember
 
01:34:09.410 --> 01:34:09.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:34:11.570 --> 01:34:11.580 align:start position:0%
um representative Hill do you have any
 
01:34:13.070 --> 01:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
input into this
 
01:34:15.890 --> 01:34:15.900 align:start position:0%
being your origin
 
01:34:17.450 --> 01:34:17.460 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair
 
01:34:19.669 --> 01:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
um just a couple of
 
01:34:21.350 --> 01:34:21.360 align:start position:0%
couple of quick things
 
01:34:24.770 --> 01:34:24.780 align:start position:0%
um one is while it did go through a
 
01:34:26.090 --> 01:34:26.100 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
01:34:29.810 --> 01:34:29.820 align:start position:0%
I'm trying in vain to find actually what
 
01:34:32.330 --> 01:34:32.340 align:start position:0%
the outcome of the study committee was
 
01:34:35.990 --> 01:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
it it may have just entered the study
 
01:34:37.729 --> 01:34:37.739 align:start position:0%
committee and come out as no
 
01:34:39.890 --> 01:34:39.900 align:start position:0%
recommendation and I don't I don't have
 
01:34:42.229 --> 01:34:42.239 align:start position:0%
that in front of me and I can't find it
 
01:34:48.590 --> 01:34:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:51.350 --> 01:34:51.360 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily an immigration
 
01:34:53.450 --> 01:34:53.460 align:start position:0%
issue and I will tell you that we are
 
01:34:57.410 --> 01:34:57.420 align:start position:0%
currently battling this same question or
 
01:35:00.830 --> 01:35:00.840 align:start position:0%
or uh tangentially this same question in
 
01:35:00.840 --> 01:35:02.149 align:start position:0%
or uh tangentially this same question in
transportation

01:35:02.149 --> 01:35:02.159 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
01:35:06.770 --> 01:35:06.780 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if we're dealing with the
 
01:35:09.470 --> 01:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
the cart before the horse or not the
 
01:35:11.810 --> 01:35:11.820 align:start position:0%
penalty before we get to the point of
 
01:35:14.750 --> 01:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
determining how we handle
 
01:35:18.530 --> 01:35:18.540 align:start position:0%
um those here illegally and applying for
 
01:35:22.910 --> 01:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
Asylum or those that are here illegally
 
01:35:24.189 --> 01:35:24.199 align:start position:0%
and driving
 
01:35:27.350 --> 01:35:27.360 align:start position:0%
illegally it really is the second
 
01:35:29.629 --> 01:35:29.639 align:start position:0%
offense that we're dealing with they're
 
01:35:31.189 --> 01:35:31.199 align:start position:0%
here illegally and they're driving
 
01:35:33.410 --> 01:35:33.420 align:start position:0%
illegally so
 
01:35:37.070 --> 01:35:37.080 align:start position:0%
um I will be supporting well now I will
 
01:35:40.490 --> 01:35:40.500 align:start position:0%
be voting against the ought to pass and
 
01:35:41.750 --> 01:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
I'm sure we're going to end up in the
 
01:35:44.870 --> 01:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
same spot and we're all saying the same
 
01:35:47.810 --> 01:35:47.820 align:start position:0%
thing for this motion as we did in the
 
01:35:50.090 --> 01:35:50.100 align:start position:0%
past motion so I would assume we're
 
01:35:52.729 --> 01:35:52.739 align:start position:0%
going to end up with no recommendation
 
01:35:55.550 --> 01:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you I appreciate uh
 
01:35:57.470 --> 01:35:57.480 align:start position:0%
giving your role in transportation
 
01:36:00.110 --> 01:36:00.120 align:start position:0%
adding to the um discussion
 
01:36:03.169 --> 01:36:03.179 align:start position:0%
um I think oh representative salik sir
 
01:36:04.790 --> 01:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
one other thing um I just was thinking
 
01:36:06.590 --> 01:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
about representative Reed's comment in
 
01:36:08.450 --> 01:36:08.460 align:start position:0%
the previous discussion about the person
 
01:36:08.460 --> 01:36:09.649 align:start position:0%
the previous discussion about the person
can

01:36:09.649 --> 01:36:09.659 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:36:12.290 --> 01:36:12.300 align:start position:0%
take their misdemeanor to the prosecutor
 
01:36:13.790 --> 01:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
and to the judge and to everything else
 
01:36:15.830 --> 01:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
and in all of the testimony we've heard
 
01:36:17.450 --> 01:36:17.460 align:start position:0%
it's been about how overwhelmed the
 
01:36:19.610 --> 01:36:19.620 align:start position:0%
prosecutor's office is how overwhelmed
 
01:36:21.530 --> 01:36:21.540 align:start position:0%
the public defender's office is and how
 
01:36:23.750 --> 01:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed our judicial system is and
 
01:36:25.850 --> 01:36:25.860 align:start position:0%
so if we're saying that something that's
 
01:36:28.910 --> 01:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
a relatively minor issue that should for
 
01:36:30.590 --> 01:36:30.600 align:start position:0%
first offense only I'm not talking about
 
01:36:33.110 --> 01:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
subsequent offenses but that could be
 
01:36:34.610 --> 01:36:34.620 align:start position:0%
handled as
 
01:36:36.610 --> 01:36:36.620 align:start position:0%
um without needing the court system
 
01:36:39.290 --> 01:36:39.300 align:start position:0%
would ultimately save all of those
 
01:36:41.390 --> 01:36:41.400 align:start position:0%
systems tremendous amounts of money as
 
01:36:43.610 --> 01:36:43.620 align:start position:0%
well as time and just something else to
 
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
be considered
 
01:36:47.629 --> 01:36:47.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for that and I'm gonna close
 
01:36:49.250 --> 01:36:49.260 align:start position:0%
the discussion by just reminding
 
01:36:51.649 --> 01:36:51.659 align:start position:0%
everyone my the main reason for my
 
01:36:55.490 --> 01:36:55.500 align:start position:0%
position is that it it could potentially
 
01:36:58.370 --> 01:36:58.380 align:start position:0%
um set up not only the operator but the
 
01:36:59.930 --> 01:36:59.940 align:start position:0%
people that if they're involved in an
 
01:37:02.330 --> 01:37:02.340 align:start position:0%
accident any kind of insurance coverage
 
01:37:05.629 --> 01:37:05.639 align:start position:0%
for whatever happens horrifically
 
01:37:08.750 --> 01:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
um and and that to me is a it's a very
 
01:37:11.450 --> 01:37:11.460 align:start position:0%
very serious thing when you can end up
 
01:37:12.830 --> 01:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
with someone with medical bills for the
 
01:37:14.930 --> 01:37:14.940 align:start position:0%
rest of their lives who is equally as
 
01:37:16.970 --> 01:37:16.980 align:start position:0%
poor or potentially even also an
 
01:37:16.980 --> 01:37:18.290 align:start position:0%
poor or potentially even also an
immigrant

01:37:18.290 --> 01:37:18.300 align:start position:0%
immigrant
 
01:37:20.270 --> 01:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
um and not have coverage because of that
 
01:37:22.070 --> 01:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
so with that I lost the clerk to call
 
01:37:25.430 --> 01:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:27.290 --> 01:37:27.300 align:start position:0%
and a reminder that the motion on the
 
01:37:29.870 --> 01:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
floor is ought to pass
 
01:37:34.070 --> 01:37:34.080 align:start position:0%

electricity yeah that's why you give me
 
01:43:51.050 --> 01:43:51.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:53.750 --> 01:43:53.760 align:start position:0%

01:45:28.070 --> 01:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
why don't you just drive back to your
 
01:45:30.129 --> 01:45:30.139 align:start position:0%
house and pack it my brother since
 
01:45:35.890 --> 01:45:35.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:38.629 --> 01:45:38.639 align:start position:0%
that's odd job not good job get back in
 
01:45:40.370 --> 01:45:40.380 align:start position:0%
your car someone as long as being
 
01:45:40.380 --> 01:45:43.510 align:start position:0%
your car someone as long as being
penalized

01:45:43.510 --> 01:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:46.189 --> 01:45:46.199 align:start position:0%
screened there and these guys are going
 
01:45:48.109 --> 01:45:48.119 align:start position:0%
to drive a bus now with this stop right
 
01:45:50.330 --> 01:45:50.340 align:start position:0%
yeah so if they smash up again
 
01:45:52.790 --> 01:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
you know they have no license they never
 
01:45:59.229 --> 01:45:59.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:59.239 --> 01:46:03.790 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:46:03.790 --> 01:46:03.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:06.410 --> 01:46:06.420 align:start position:0%
and now you should not make it Vlogs to
 
01:46:08.870 --> 01:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
make it happen right I agree with you
 
01:46:11.810 --> 01:46:11.820 align:start position:0%
Kevin 100 and you know and I'm trying to
 
01:46:14.090 --> 01:46:14.100 align:start position:0%
figure it you know kind of hearing on
 
01:46:22.750 --> 01:46:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:26.209 --> 01:46:26.219 align:start position:0%
as a nurse since 1991 we've worked
 
01:46:28.149 --> 01:46:28.159 align:start position:0%
shortstack shorts
 
01:46:30.649 --> 01:46:30.659 align:start position:0%
you have a job to do you do it whether
 
01:46:32.390 --> 01:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
you're voters understand
 
01:46:36.169 --> 01:46:36.179 align:start position:0%
or not that's not an excuse no no they
 
01:46:38.510 --> 01:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
uh they really dump up an essays they
 
01:46:40.550 --> 01:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
really have a job I almost got Dr help
 
01:46:45.850 --> 01:46:45.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:48.470 --> 01:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
you know and those are people's lives
 
01:46:50.629 --> 01:46:50.639 align:start position:0%
you deal with you know and maybe they
 
01:46:53.209 --> 01:46:53.219 align:start position:0%
get the job done yeah so you know even
 
01:46:55.910 --> 01:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
though they're that's that's just the
 
01:46:55.920 --> 01:47:05.109 align:start position:0%
though they're that's that's just the
beginning

01:47:05.109 --> 01:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:05.119 --> 01:47:20.229 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:47:20.229 --> 01:47:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:23.090 --> 01:47:23.100 align:start position:0%
so yeah I agree with you it's not the
 
01:47:25.010 --> 01:47:25.020 align:start position:0%
point around Down Here Without license
 
01:47:26.750 --> 01:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
you know so many people probably like
 
01:47:28.669 --> 01:47:28.679 align:start position:0%
Chinese people they will never even have
 
01:47:30.830 --> 01:47:30.840 align:start position:0%
a driver's license to begin with so I'll
 
01:47:32.270 --> 01:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
let you know when you have an experience
 
01:47:34.729 --> 01:47:34.739 align:start position:0%
behind the wheel it's a very scary in
 
01:47:38.709 --> 01:47:38.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:38.719 --> 01:47:41.950 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:47:41.950 --> 01:47:41.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:44.270 --> 01:47:44.280 align:start position:0%
they can drive any piece of junk down
 
01:47:45.890 --> 01:47:45.900 align:start position:0%
there right then you have to stick
 
01:47:47.830 --> 01:47:47.840 align:start position:0%
around and it can be a motorcycle
 
01:47:51.350 --> 01:47:51.360 align:start position:0%
without Tire everything else
 
01:48:06.490 --> 01:48:06.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:06.500 --> 01:48:09.490 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:48:09.490 --> 01:48:09.500 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:48:12.229 --> 01:48:12.239 align:start position:0%
I I just feel that we're going to end up
 
01:48:16.250 --> 01:48:16.260 align:start position:0%
being a six Gun City Style in our
 
01:48:16.260 --> 01:48:17.350 align:start position:0%
being a six Gun City Style in our
country

01:48:17.350 --> 01:48:17.360 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:48:21.310 --> 01:48:21.320 align:start position:0%
you know it's a wee type problems
 
01:49:30.430 --> 01:49:30.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:32.510 --> 01:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
they wanted to make the license for you
 
01:49:34.310 --> 01:49:34.320 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't mind the ACT I can't make it
 
01:49:36.830 --> 01:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
so that we have to pass test a driving
 
01:49:39.169 --> 01:49:39.179 align:start position:0%
test and I've written a text once you've
 
01:49:40.609 --> 01:49:40.619 align:start position:0%
been showing you stay within the line
 
01:49:43.310 --> 01:49:43.320 align:start position:0%
you can stop at a stop sign and use your
 
01:49:45.490 --> 01:49:45.500 align:start position:0%
direction or like they never do
 
01:49:49.870 --> 01:49:49.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:59.209 --> 01:49:59.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:59.219 --> 01:50:38.390 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:50:38.390 --> 01:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:40.669 --> 01:50:40.679 align:start position:0%
yeah primary world you can stop signs on
 
01:50:42.470 --> 01:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
a secondary Road and you just let
 
01:50:45.290 --> 01:50:45.300 align:start position:0%
traffic control itself but uh to produce
 
01:50:47.689 --> 01:50:47.699 align:start position:0%
which is stupid you have big trucks
 
01:50:49.010 --> 01:50:49.020 align:start position:0%
trying to go around and take it up two
 
01:50:51.890 --> 01:50:51.900 align:start position:0%
lanes and they're so shut up like God
 
01:50:53.689 --> 01:50:53.699 align:start position:0%
they were so stupid yeah they made two
 
01:50:55.790 --> 01:50:55.800 align:start position:0%
down there and a lot of things I can't
 
01:50:57.530 --> 01:50:57.540 align:start position:0%
get around until I say you can drive
 
01:50:59.209 --> 01:50:59.219 align:start position:0%
with one occur right she's not a good
 
01:51:02.090 --> 01:51:02.100 align:start position:0%
place it's all uh cobblestones right
 
01:51:05.270 --> 01:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
right so the they rebuild them to put a
 
01:51:07.850 --> 01:51:07.860 align:start position:0%
lot of people about just tease me off
 
01:51:10.370 --> 01:51:10.380 align:start position:0%
the Raymond they've got two inches of
 
01:51:13.550 --> 01:51:13.560 align:start position:0%
rain and they've been teachers so you
 
01:51:15.229 --> 01:51:15.239 align:start position:0%
have to actually by a lot of people used
 
01:51:17.570 --> 01:51:17.580 align:start position:0%
to having a boss with one lane two lanes
 
01:51:19.729 --> 01:51:19.739 align:start position:0%
to get out of the bottom and it's just
 
01:51:21.470 --> 01:51:21.480 align:start position:0%
not designed where somebody stops
 
01:51:23.090 --> 01:51:23.100 align:start position:0%
whether it's supposed to stop I tell you
 
01:51:25.250 --> 01:51:25.260 align:start position:0%
where we will come around
 
01:51:27.890 --> 01:51:27.900 align:start position:0%
stupid questions can't go down easily
 
01:51:30.229 --> 01:51:30.239 align:start position:0%
they're not well thought out I only want
 
01:51:31.490 --> 01:51:31.500 align:start position:0%
to make it a nice little village you
 
01:51:34.010 --> 01:51:34.020 align:start position:0%
know the aesthetic well the vehicle's
 
01:51:35.390 --> 01:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
got a nice little Vehicles anymore you
 
01:51:37.010 --> 01:51:37.020 align:start position:0%
know when they hit the wagon game on
 
01:51:39.410 --> 01:51:39.420 align:start position:0%
your floor it was small but now they get
 
01:51:41.689 --> 01:51:41.699 align:start position:0%
these are inches down yellow and green
 
01:51:48.070 --> 01:51:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:50.270 --> 01:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
you're gonna make the road nice and cute
 
01:51:53.950 --> 01:51:53.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:56.750 --> 01:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
and went to the road and they made it
 
01:51:58.910 --> 01:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
like 16 feet wide between three feet of
 
01:52:00.770 --> 01:52:00.780 align:start position:0%
a grass they put trees in it so it
 
01:52:03.410 --> 01:52:03.420 align:start position:0%
looked good it's a fortunate that's what
 
01:52:05.090 --> 01:52:05.100 align:start position:0%
I call it and the trees are directly
 
01:52:07.970 --> 01:52:07.980 align:start position:0%
underneath the whites so when they grow
 
01:52:07.980 --> 01:52:09.310 align:start position:0%
underneath the whites so when they grow
up

01:52:09.310 --> 01:52:09.320 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:52:11.930 --> 01:52:11.940 align:start position:0%
right how can they not figure that out
 
01:52:14.030 --> 01:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
you know it's not about sidewalks how
 
01:52:15.350 --> 01:52:15.360 align:start position:0%
they're stupid enough to put a tree
 
01:52:17.810 --> 01:52:17.820 align:start position:0%
right underneath the wires all the time
 
01:52:20.149 --> 01:52:20.159 align:start position:0%
over and over again in that town and uh
 
01:52:21.709 --> 01:52:21.719 align:start position:0%
eventually that thing will grow up
 
01:52:23.689 --> 01:52:23.699 align:start position:0%
eventually they'll have to cut it off
 
01:52:25.790 --> 01:52:25.800 align:start position:0%
and put a hole for it right it will look
 
01:52:27.830 --> 01:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
terrible right or it'll just go through
 
01:52:29.050 --> 01:52:29.060 align:start position:0%
the wire
 
01:52:31.370 --> 01:52:31.380 align:start position:0%
all right they do it over and over again
 
01:52:33.830 --> 01:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
because they have no thought but it's
 
01:52:36.550 --> 01:52:36.560 align:start position:0%
good enough so the whole time
 
01:52:39.050 --> 01:52:39.060 align:start position:0%
raised and if power truck will go down
 
01:52:41.750 --> 01:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
and clean it off right right yes right
 
01:52:44.209 --> 01:52:44.219 align:start position:0%
it was open yeah
 
01:52:48.729 --> 01:52:48.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:51.530 --> 01:52:51.540 align:start position:0%
he was just one year with so many snows
 
01:52:53.290 --> 01:52:53.300 align:start position:0%
gone he was trying to go back and forth
 
02:03:15.109 --> 02:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:15.119 --> 02:03:17.390 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:03:17.390 --> 02:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:19.490 --> 02:03:19.500 align:start position:0%
at this time I'm opening the executive
 
02:03:22.609 --> 02:03:22.619 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill 291.
 
02:03:25.010 --> 02:03:25.020 align:start position:0%
and I recognize a representative Rhodes
 
02:03:28.070 --> 02:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
for a motion thank you Mr chairman I
 
02:03:30.530 --> 02:03:30.540 align:start position:0%
would like to make a motion of itl for
 
02:03:32.689 --> 02:03:32.699 align:start position:0%
House Bill 291
 
02:03:35.390 --> 02:03:35.400 align:start position:0%
a second
 
02:03:37.129 --> 02:03:37.139 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Rhodes would
 
02:03:39.770 --> 02:03:39.780 align:start position:0%
you like to speak to your motion
 
02:03:41.689 --> 02:03:41.699 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um
 
02:03:43.550 --> 02:03:43.560 align:start position:0%
briefly while I
 
02:03:45.770 --> 02:03:45.780 align:start position:0%
I do believe on the
 
02:03:48.830 --> 02:03:48.840 align:start position:0%
on the surface you know it it certainly
 
02:03:51.530 --> 02:03:51.540 align:start position:0%
is in line with you know the thoughts of
 
02:03:54.410 --> 02:03:54.420 align:start position:0%
it's not okay to go to an apartment and
 
02:03:56.990 --> 02:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
and lie and make false accusations it it
 
02:03:58.430 --> 02:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
puts the department out to have to do
 
02:04:01.609 --> 02:04:01.619 align:start position:0%
investigation it all the employees
 
02:04:03.229 --> 02:04:03.239 align:start position:0%
um it's not sending an okay message it's
 
02:04:04.669 --> 02:04:04.679 align:start position:0%
okay to go make these false reports but
 
02:04:07.129 --> 02:04:07.139 align:start position:0%
on the other hand it was very specific
 
02:04:10.850 --> 02:04:10.860 align:start position:0%
to really one Department
 
02:04:10.860 --> 02:04:12.290 align:start position:0%
to really one Department
um

02:04:12.290 --> 02:04:12.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:14.209 --> 02:04:14.219 align:start position:0%
and I I think overall that the general
 
02:04:17.089 --> 02:04:17.099 align:start position:0%
census is that you know most people are
 
02:04:18.830 --> 02:04:18.840 align:start position:0%
not doing that and sometimes I think it
 
02:04:20.990 --> 02:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
might be a Vengeance situation but I
 
02:04:22.250 --> 02:04:22.260 align:start position:0%
don't think that we want to set laws
 
02:04:26.169 --> 02:04:26.179 align:start position:0%
based on just vengeance
 
02:04:28.370 --> 02:04:28.380 align:start position:0%
representative uh Harry gaps right would
 
02:04:29.750 --> 02:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
you like to speak to you a second I
 
02:04:31.729 --> 02:04:31.739 align:start position:0%
think it was
 
02:04:36.350 --> 02:04:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:38.810 --> 02:04:38.820 align:start position:0%
seeing none I I would simply say that I
 
02:04:41.930 --> 02:04:41.940 align:start position:0%
concur with the the itl
 
02:04:41.940 --> 02:04:43.910 align:start position:0%
concur with the the itl
um

02:04:43.910 --> 02:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:46.430 --> 02:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
there are remedies currently in civil
 
02:04:50.390 --> 02:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
law for someone who Slanders or or
 
02:04:50.400 --> 02:04:51.109 align:start position:0%
law for someone who Slanders or or
um

02:04:51.109 --> 02:04:51.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:52.970 --> 02:04:52.980 align:start position:0%
makes false statements against a
 
02:04:55.430 --> 02:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
business or a person and there are
 
02:04:56.930 --> 02:04:56.940 align:start position:0%
remedies for that I know it's not the
 
02:04:59.149 --> 02:04:59.159 align:start position:0%
most convenient way to do it but I'm
 
02:05:01.729 --> 02:05:01.739 align:start position:0%
cherry picking agencies to
 
02:05:03.830 --> 02:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
or that are
 
02:05:06.830 --> 02:05:06.840 align:start position:0%
attached penalties to them I think it's
 
02:05:09.770 --> 02:05:09.780 align:start position:0%
it's um sets a bad precedent so I'm
 
02:05:11.870 --> 02:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
gonna I'll follow along with that and go
 
02:05:14.270 --> 02:05:14.280 align:start position:0%
with an Ito at this time I would ask the
 
02:05:15.729 --> 02:05:15.739 align:start position:0%

02:06:41.450 --> 02:06:41.460 align:start position:0%
HP 144
 
02:06:43.669 --> 02:06:43.679 align:start position:0%
and I recognize representative jandron
 
02:06:45.530 --> 02:06:45.540 align:start position:0%
to make a motion
 
02:06:48.410 --> 02:06:48.420 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I move to retain house bill

144. and to appoint is there a second
 
02:06:51.719 --> 02:06:53.209 align:start position:0%
144. and to appoint is there a second
second

02:06:53.209 --> 02:06:53.219 align:start position:0%
second
 
02:06:56.510 --> 02:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:59.149 --> 02:06:59.159 align:start position:0%
yes I believe there's some Merit to some
 
02:07:02.990 --> 02:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
offenses being uh listed specifically
 
02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:04.209 align:start position:0%
offenses being uh listed specifically
listed

02:07:04.209 --> 02:07:04.219 align:start position:0%
listed
 
02:07:08.050 --> 02:07:08.060 align:start position:0%
to allow restoring of firearm ownership
 
02:07:12.770 --> 02:07:12.780 align:start position:0%
not all felonies are violent but some
 
02:07:15.669 --> 02:07:15.679 align:start position:0%
that were testified in the hearing
 
02:07:18.530 --> 02:07:18.540 align:start position:0%
although they may not be non-violent
 
02:07:18.540 --> 02:07:19.430 align:start position:0%
although they may not be non-violent
still

02:07:19.430 --> 02:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
still
 
02:07:22.370 --> 02:07:22.380 align:start position:0%
could be considered reasons why we
 
02:07:24.530 --> 02:07:24.540 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to restore those rights so
 
02:07:26.450 --> 02:07:26.460 align:start position:0%
I'd like to have a subcommittee to work
 
02:07:28.010 --> 02:07:28.020 align:start position:0%
on a
 
02:07:32.030 --> 02:07:32.040 align:start position:0%

further review and see what else we
 
02:07:46.010 --> 02:07:46.020 align:start position:0%

02:10:56.810 --> 02:10:56.820 align:start position:0%
although this bill has Merit it deserves
 
02:10:59.990 --> 02:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
further study thank you
 
02:11:01.010 --> 02:11:01.020 align:start position:0%

02:11:14.270 --> 02:11:14.280 align:start position:0%
I'll add we're going to appoint a
 
02:11:15.830 --> 02:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on this to work on this
 
02:11:15.840 --> 02:11:21.890 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on this to work on this
bill

02:11:21.890 --> 02:11:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:23.810 --> 02:11:23.820 align:start position:0%
um because
 
02:11:26.510 --> 02:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
we have two bills that basically do the
 
02:11:29.270 --> 02:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
same thing and we want to spend just a
 
02:11:31.609 --> 02:11:31.619 align:start position:0%
little bit of time on that and I'm
 
02:11:33.410 --> 02:11:33.420 align:start position:0%
making sure that we get the best parts
 
02:11:35.089 --> 02:11:35.099 align:start position:0%
of both of those bills I think we all
 
02:11:38.030 --> 02:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
agree that it is a good idea to provide
 
02:11:40.310 --> 02:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
this testing ability and we want to make
 
02:11:42.649 --> 02:11:42.659 align:start position:0%
sure I understand there's a emotion I
 
02:11:44.689 --> 02:11:44.699 align:start position:0%
mean excuse me an amendment coming and I
 
02:11:46.070 --> 02:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
would like to take and look at both of
 
02:11:48.530 --> 02:11:48.540 align:start position:0%
them and conceal it into one bill this
 
02:11:51.470 --> 02:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
will be a short subcommittee and we
 
02:11:52.790 --> 02:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
should probably deal with it rather
 
02:11:52.800 --> 02:11:54.370 align:start position:0%
should probably deal with it rather
quickly

02:11:54.370 --> 02:11:54.380 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
02:11:56.990 --> 02:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
any more discussion
 
02:11:59.209 --> 02:11:59.219 align:start position:0%
representative Newell
 
02:12:03.109 --> 02:12:03.119 align:start position:0%
uh I agree uh that this and
 
02:12:06.709 --> 02:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
um 287 should be considered and figure
 
02:12:08.330 --> 02:12:08.340 align:start position:0%
out the best way forward I guess what I
 
02:12:09.830 --> 02:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
would just want to say is is that we
 
02:12:12.050 --> 02:12:12.060 align:start position:0%
keep in mind the urgency
 
02:12:14.450 --> 02:12:14.460 align:start position:0%
um of what what uh getting this done in
 
02:12:17.209 --> 02:12:17.219 align:start position:0%
a timely manner
 
02:12:19.669 --> 02:12:19.679 align:start position:0%
I agree but I I think it's equally as
 
02:12:21.229 --> 02:12:21.239 align:start position:0%
important to make sure we come together
 
02:12:25.010 --> 02:12:25.020 align:start position:0%
as a committee and everyone agrees on it
 
02:12:25.020 --> 02:12:25.550 align:start position:0%
as a committee and everyone agrees on it
um

02:12:25.550 --> 02:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:27.169 --> 02:12:27.179 align:start position:0%
so you know further discussion the
 
02:12:31.010 --> 02:12:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:31.020 --> 02:12:32.089 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:12:32.089 --> 02:12:32.099 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:12:35.990 --> 02:12:36.000 align:start position:0%

representative Selleck yes
 
02:13:22.850 --> 02:13:22.860 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler
 
02:13:25.729 --> 02:13:25.739 align:start position:0%
chairman Roy Charles yes
 
02:13:29.770 --> 02:13:29.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:32.450 --> 02:13:32.460 align:start position:0%
with that um
 
02:13:36.350 --> 02:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
HP 287 is retained and I closed the
 
02:13:38.930 --> 02:13:38.940 align:start position:0%
executive session I opened the executive
 
02:13:43.790 --> 02:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
session on HB 470 and recognize
 
02:13:47.750 --> 02:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:50.030 --> 02:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
my motion is also to retain this and put
 
02:13:52.129 --> 02:13:52.139 align:start position:0%
it to the Samsung committee
 
02:13:56.569 --> 02:13:56.579 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:59.870 --> 02:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:03.950 --> 02:14:03.960 align:start position:0%
uh I think it applies that both House
 
02:14:07.490 --> 02:14:07.500 align:start position:0%
Bill 470 and 287 have merits and we'd
 
02:14:12.109 --> 02:14:12.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:13.729 --> 02:14:13.739 align:start position:0%
thank you would you like to speak to you
 
02:14:13.739 --> 02:14:14.990 align:start position:0%
thank you would you like to speak to you
second

02:14:14.990 --> 02:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
second
 
02:14:17.510 --> 02:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
I would concur
 
02:14:20.990 --> 02:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
thank you I would say that um I uh it's
 
02:14:23.330 --> 02:14:23.340 align:start position:0%
the same thing I just said
 
02:14:25.970 --> 02:14:25.980 align:start position:0%
um we like both bills one perhaps a
 
02:14:27.290 --> 02:14:27.300 align:start position:0%
little more than the other but I'd like
 
02:14:30.350 --> 02:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we take a moment and
 
02:14:33.290 --> 02:14:33.300 align:start position:0%
ensure that we come up with the best
 
02:14:34.910 --> 02:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
product that we can all support
 
02:14:37.910 --> 02:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
unanimously and I will be appointing a
 
02:14:39.649 --> 02:14:39.659 align:start position:0%
subcommittee if we agree to retain this
 
02:14:42.050 --> 02:14:42.060 align:start position:0%
one and on that subcommittee will be
 
02:14:43.729 --> 02:14:43.739 align:start position:0%
chaired by representative Manion and
 
02:14:45.729 --> 02:14:45.739 align:start position:0%
we'll have representative Reed Stone
 
02:14:49.910 --> 02:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:53.870 --> 02:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
um with that any further discussion
 
02:14:56.270 --> 02:14:56.280 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
02:14:58.310 --> 02:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:15:00.050 --> 02:15:00.060 align:start position:0%
um my suggestion to the committee would
 
02:15:01.430 --> 02:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
be to
 
02:15:01.440 --> 02:15:02.030 align:start position:0%
be to
um

02:15:02.030 --> 02:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:03.890 --> 02:15:03.900 align:start position:0%
OTP The Spill
 
02:15:05.870 --> 02:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
um while we work on the other one as
 
02:15:07.490 --> 02:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
representative Newell mentioned earlier
 
02:15:10.189 --> 02:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
this is an urgent issue that impacts
 
02:15:12.169 --> 02:15:12.179 align:start position:0%
people every day on whether or not they
 
02:15:14.030 --> 02:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
are taking drugs that are safe or not
 
02:15:14.040 --> 02:15:15.470 align:start position:0%
are taking drugs that are safe or not
and

02:15:15.470 --> 02:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:15:18.050 --> 02:15:18.060 align:start position:0%
um in my opinion people could die if we
 
02:15:21.050 --> 02:15:21.060 align:start position:0%
don't pass legislation like this sooner
 
02:15:24.470 --> 02:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
I agree uh that it is an urgent bill
 
02:15:26.270 --> 02:15:26.280 align:start position:0%
um I have a quick question hold on a
 
02:15:26.280 --> 02:16:27.290 align:start position:0%
um I have a quick question hold on a
second

02:16:27.290 --> 02:16:27.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:30.229 --> 02:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
I'm going to um ask the two people who
 
02:16:32.209 --> 02:16:32.219 align:start position:0%
made a motion if they'd be willing to
 
02:16:34.549 --> 02:16:34.559 align:start position:0%
withdraw it and then hear me out
 
02:16:37.129 --> 02:16:37.139 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I'm just looking now at the
 
02:16:39.290 --> 02:16:39.300 align:start position:0%
house deadlines we have until March 16th
 
02:16:41.810 --> 02:16:41.820 align:start position:0%
to report this bill out and I would
 
02:16:43.969 --> 02:16:43.979 align:start position:0%
agree I'll withdraw my emotion
 
02:16:46.790 --> 02:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
oh I will draw thank you um with that
 
02:16:48.169 --> 02:16:48.179 align:start position:0%
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
 
02:16:50.629 --> 02:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
recess the executive session on this and
 
02:16:51.830 --> 02:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a committee work
 
02:16:53.810 --> 02:16:53.820 align:start position:0%
session and we're going to hammer this
 
02:16:56.089 --> 02:16:56.099 align:start position:0%
out now sometime in the next couple
 
02:16:58.190 --> 02:16:58.200 align:start position:0%
weeks and come up with the product now
 
02:17:01.250 --> 02:17:01.260 align:start position:0%
rather than wait until January to come
 
02:17:03.889 --> 02:17:03.899 align:start position:0%
out with a does that make everyone feel
 
02:17:05.150 --> 02:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
a little bit better
 
02:17:08.150 --> 02:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
I'm all about the warm and fuzzies
 
02:17:10.549 --> 02:17:10.559 align:start position:0%
Okay so we've withdrawn the motion to
 
02:17:12.589 --> 02:17:12.599 align:start position:0%
retain that bill what we're going to do
 
02:17:14.089 --> 02:17:14.099 align:start position:0%
is I'm going to recess the executive
 
02:17:15.230 --> 02:17:15.240 align:start position:0%
session we're going to I'm going to
 
02:17:16.790 --> 02:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
schedule a full committee work session
 
02:17:18.530 --> 02:17:18.540 align:start position:0%
we're going to come in here to deal with
 
02:17:19.969 --> 02:17:19.979 align:start position:0%
just that bill and we're going to merge
 
02:17:21.469 --> 02:17:21.479 align:start position:0%
it with the other Bill and come up with
 
02:17:22.669 --> 02:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
the best product and we're going to get
 
02:17:24.230 --> 02:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
it done this year and we're going to
 
02:17:27.469 --> 02:17:27.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:29.650 --> 02:17:29.660 align:start position:0%
would you like me to not do that okay
 
02:17:32.810 --> 02:17:32.820 align:start position:0%
may make a request please just for for
 
02:17:34.370 --> 02:17:34.380 align:start position:0%
people setting up subcommittee meetings
 
02:17:36.110 --> 02:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
if they could just let the other people
 
02:17:37.549 --> 02:17:37.559 align:start position:0%
on the subcommittee have an idea of
 
02:17:40.250 --> 02:17:40.260 align:start position:0%
scheduling in with sufficient notice
 
02:17:41.750 --> 02:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
especially on days we're not generally
 
02:17:43.370 --> 02:17:43.380 align:start position:0%
intended to be here that would be really
 
02:17:45.110 --> 02:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
helpful if everyone who's in charge of
 
02:17:46.549 --> 02:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
subcommittee heard that please give your
 
02:17:48.889 --> 02:17:48.899 align:start position:0%
members adequate notice and I will
 
02:17:50.089 --> 02:17:50.099 align:start position:0%
certain this is going to be a full
 
02:17:51.349 --> 02:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
committee work session not a
 
02:17:53.089 --> 02:17:53.099 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so we'll all be here
 
02:17:53.099 --> 02:17:54.049 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so we'll all be here
together

02:17:54.049 --> 02:17:54.059 align:start position:0%
together
 
02:17:56.690 --> 02:17:56.700 align:start position:0%
um so bring your lunch I'll let you know
 
02:17:59.150 --> 02:17:59.160 align:start position:0%
when it is so with that I am going to
 
02:17:59.160 --> 02:18:01.129 align:start position:0%
when it is so with that I am going to
recess

02:18:01.129 --> 02:18:01.139 align:start position:0%
recess
 
02:18:01.139 --> 02:18:02.950 align:start position:0%
recess

work session is
 
02:18:11.150 --> 02:18:11.160 align:start position:0%
and with that I'm going to open the pot
 
02:18:14.150 --> 02:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
no the executive session on House Bill
 
02:18:18.230 --> 02:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:20.570 --> 02:18:20.580 align:start position:0%
and recognize
 
02:18:24.469 --> 02:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
292 representative Rhodes promotion
 
02:18:25.969 --> 02:18:25.979 align:start position:0%
well thank you Mr chair if you could
 
02:18:28.549 --> 02:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
just give me one second
 
02:18:31.370 --> 02:18:31.380 align:start position:0%
time I would like to make a motion of
 
02:18:35.209 --> 02:18:35.219 align:start position:0%
itl for house bill 292.
 
02:18:36.530 --> 02:18:36.540 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
02:18:38.030 --> 02:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Rhodes would
 
02:18:40.429 --> 02:18:40.439 align:start position:0%
you like to speak to your motion
 
02:18:43.370 --> 02:18:43.380 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
02:18:45.589 --> 02:18:45.599 align:start position:0%
is unfortunate as is that I think we all
 
02:18:48.169 --> 02:18:48.179 align:start position:0%
agree that sometimes
 
02:18:50.629 --> 02:18:50.639 align:start position:0%
um there may be a meeting that we prefer
 
02:18:52.790 --> 02:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
had not taken place maybe maybe it did
 
02:18:54.410 --> 02:18:54.420 align:start position:0%
maybe it didn't
 
02:18:57.049 --> 02:18:57.059 align:start position:0%
um this is more of a 91a issue it it is
 
02:18:59.270 --> 02:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
illegal to hold a
 
02:19:02.150 --> 02:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
an illegal meeting already
 
02:19:04.610 --> 02:19:04.620 align:start position:0%
um but it is generally frowned upon by
 
02:19:07.129 --> 02:19:07.139 align:start position:0%
the entire legislative body to
 
02:19:09.650 --> 02:19:09.660 align:start position:0%
to have personal penalties for an
 
02:19:14.750 --> 02:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
individual member of a board and um
 
02:19:17.509 --> 02:19:17.519 align:start position:0%
for for that reason I
 
02:19:19.669 --> 02:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
like right to the quick is just uh to I
 
02:19:22.089 --> 02:19:22.099 align:start position:0%
tell it
 
02:19:23.990 --> 02:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
representative would you like to speak
 
02:19:28.310 --> 02:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:28.320 --> 02:19:31.429 align:start position:0%
 
discussion

02:19:31.429 --> 02:19:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:33.110 --> 02:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
I would just add that
 
02:19:35.330 --> 02:19:35.340 align:start position:0%
um these are volunteer positions and
 
02:19:38.570 --> 02:19:38.580 align:start position:0%
oftentimes the people that are doing it
 
02:19:41.270 --> 02:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
um would not do it if they were realized
 
02:19:43.129 --> 02:19:43.139 align:start position:0%
they were at such significant financial
 
02:19:45.950 --> 02:19:45.960 align:start position:0%
risk regardless of whether or not they
 
02:19:47.570 --> 02:19:47.580 align:start position:0%
they made something a mistake or an
 
02:19:49.310 --> 02:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
attempt representative Newman you seem
 
02:19:51.290 --> 02:19:51.300 align:start position:0%
to be wanting to say something
 
02:19:53.150 --> 02:19:53.160 align:start position:0%
and I agree I think that this bill
 
02:19:55.370 --> 02:19:55.380 align:start position:0%
should be itl
 
02:19:58.130 --> 02:19:58.140 align:start position:0%
and but my reason for it is is in
 
02:20:00.710 --> 02:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
section two line nine where it gives any
 
02:20:02.929 --> 02:20:02.939 align:start position:0%
individual the private right to sue a
 
02:20:05.590 --> 02:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
public official when they did X Y or Z
 
02:20:08.090 --> 02:20:08.100 align:start position:0%
and I think that take kind of takes it
 
02:20:09.590 --> 02:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
out of the criminal justice system and
 
02:20:11.570 --> 02:20:11.580 align:start position:0%
puts it in the Civil system and I'm
 
02:20:13.670 --> 02:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
opposed to that kind of language in a
 
02:20:13.680 --> 02:20:15.770 align:start position:0%
opposed to that kind of language in a
bill

02:20:15.770 --> 02:20:15.780 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:20:15.780 --> 02:20:16.910 align:start position:0%
bill
well

02:20:16.910 --> 02:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:20:18.410 --> 02:20:18.420 align:start position:0%
I think we all have our individual
 
02:20:19.910 --> 02:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
regions but we're coming to the same
 
02:20:21.650 --> 02:20:21.660 align:start position:0%
conclusion with that I will ask the
 
02:20:23.389 --> 02:20:23.399 align:start position:0%
clerk to call the road
 
02:20:26.990 --> 02:20:27.000 align:start position:0%

Rights and eight hours in the New
 
02:22:10.849 --> 02:22:10.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution as well I can
 
02:22:12.830 --> 02:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
speak to my personal experience I
 
02:22:14.570 --> 02:22:14.580 align:start position:0%
graduated in 1995 from the police
 
02:22:16.730 --> 02:22:16.740 align:start position:0%
academy and I received training all of
 
02:22:18.130 --> 02:22:18.140 align:start position:0%
those subjects
 
02:22:20.990 --> 02:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
and as we heard from the director of The
 
02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:22.070 align:start position:0%
and as we heard from the director of The
Academy

02:22:22.070 --> 02:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
Academy
 
02:22:24.349 --> 02:22:24.359 align:start position:0%
he provided a fairly comprehensive
 
02:22:27.170 --> 02:22:27.180 align:start position:0%
binder and actually exceeds some of
 
02:22:28.429 --> 02:22:28.439 align:start position:0%
these hours that they're currently
 
02:22:30.830 --> 02:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
teaching and he said he was open to more
 
02:22:33.889 --> 02:22:33.899 align:start position:0%
uh teaching on this subject as well so I
 
02:22:35.690 --> 02:22:35.700 align:start position:0%
think this bill is unnecessary and this
 
02:22:38.330 --> 02:22:38.340 align:start position:0%
this stuff is already being done
 
02:22:39.830 --> 02:22:39.840 align:start position:0%

emotion involved but I'm just going to
 
02:24:39.590 --> 02:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
say for technical reasons we agreed to
 
02:24:41.270 --> 02:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
retain it and that would be the official
 
02:24:43.130 --> 02:24:43.140 align:start position:0%
thing we have to undo that so that we
 
02:24:46.309 --> 02:24:46.319 align:start position:0%
can work on it and fix it with the other
 
02:24:48.830 --> 02:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
bill that we retained that we are going
 
02:24:50.270 --> 02:24:50.280 align:start position:0%
to work on
 
02:24:52.610 --> 02:24:52.620 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yeah
 
02:24:55.429 --> 02:24:55.439 align:start position:0%
we've retained right so if we're undoing
 
02:24:56.630 --> 02:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
that doesn't the person who made the
 
02:25:02.990 --> 02:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:04.490 --> 02:25:04.500 align:start position:0%
does everybody understand let me explain
 
02:25:07.969 --> 02:25:07.979 align:start position:0%
that that I see some looks the bill that
 
02:25:11.090 --> 02:25:11.100 align:start position:0%
we retained on the fentanyl test strips
 
02:25:12.889 --> 02:25:12.899 align:start position:0%
um the other one we did not retain we
 
02:25:14.570 --> 02:25:14.580 align:start position:0%
left it open and we're going to do a
 
02:25:16.490 --> 02:25:16.500 align:start position:0%
work session on it but we voted to
 
02:25:18.170 --> 02:25:18.180 align:start position:0%
retain the other one so the official
 
02:25:19.610 --> 02:25:19.620 align:start position:0%
record going to the clerk would be
 
02:25:22.570 --> 02:25:22.580 align:start position:0%
retain we want to not do that we want to
 
02:25:25.490 --> 02:25:25.500 align:start position:0%
undo that and then leave it open so that
 
02:25:27.230 --> 02:25:27.240 align:start position:0%
we make also work on it does that
 
02:25:29.990 --> 02:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
everyone get that so representative
 
02:25:32.330 --> 02:25:32.340 align:start position:0%
Newman would we then have to have any
 
02:25:33.889 --> 02:25:33.899 align:start position:0%
other vote to have it be able to be
 
02:25:35.510 --> 02:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
combined and worked on in a work session
 
02:25:38.030 --> 02:25:38.040 align:start position:0%
no um no we what we would do is then we
 
02:25:39.469 --> 02:25:39.479 align:start position:0%
would address both bills once we were
 
02:25:40.969 --> 02:25:40.979 align:start position:0%
finished working on it and one of them
 
02:25:42.650 --> 02:25:42.660 align:start position:0%
would be IPL that one of them would move
 
02:25:46.429 --> 02:25:46.439 align:start position:0%
forward if all things work out great
 
02:25:49.190 --> 02:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
with that I would ask the clerk to call
 
02:25:54.710 --> 02:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:56.450 --> 02:25:56.460 align:start position:0%

02:27:26.690 --> 02:27:26.700 align:start position:0%
House Bill 144 and I looked at the house
 
02:27:29.270 --> 02:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
calendar I'm sorry the deadlines for the
 
02:27:33.110 --> 02:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
house I would uh say that in order to
 
02:27:35.750 --> 02:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
have that subcommittee convened for HB
 
02:27:38.809 --> 02:27:38.819 align:start position:0%
144 it would more than likely be
 
02:27:42.170 --> 02:27:42.180 align:start position:0%
after crossover and crossover occurs on
 
02:27:43.550 --> 02:27:43.560 align:start position:0%
April 6th
 
02:27:46.370 --> 02:27:46.380 align:start position:0%
because uh I think it's easier to work
 
02:27:48.050 --> 02:27:48.060 align:start position:0%
on it when we're working on Senate bills
 
02:27:52.130 --> 02:27:52.140 align:start position:0%
as well it is no there's no
 
02:27:52.140 --> 02:27:55.010 align:start position:0%
as well it is no there's no
uh

02:27:55.010 --> 02:27:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:57.650 --> 02:27:57.660 align:start position:0%
urgency to working on this and and to
 
02:27:59.330 --> 02:27:59.340 align:start position:0%
put it before the Full House in next
 
02:28:01.370 --> 02:28:01.380 align:start position:0%
year in January
 
02:28:03.710 --> 02:28:03.720 align:start position:0%
um let's take that logistic discussion
 
02:28:05.630 --> 02:28:05.640 align:start position:0%
offline I need to look at that to make
 
02:28:05.640 --> 02:28:06.590 align:start position:0%
offline I need to look at that to make
sure

02:28:06.590 --> 02:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
sure
 
02:28:09.170 --> 02:28:09.180 align:start position:0%
um anyone who was here today that is
 
02:28:11.389 --> 02:28:11.399 align:start position:0%
interested in uh or following one of the
 
02:28:13.490 --> 02:28:13.500 align:start position:0%
bills I appointed a subcommittee for I
 
02:28:15.170 --> 02:28:15.180 align:start position:0%
would encourage you to reach out to the
 
02:28:17.090 --> 02:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
subcommittee chairs if you want to be a
 
02:28:19.370 --> 02:28:19.380 align:start position:0%
part of that discussion and with that I
 
02:28:21.710 --> 02:28:21.720 align:start position:0%
will close our business for the day and
 
02:28:25.309 --> 02:28:25.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:25.319 --> 02:28:29.830 align:start position:0%
 
huh

02:28:29.830 --> 02:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
