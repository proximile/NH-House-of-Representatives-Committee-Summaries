and then for the utility property tax of
42.3

00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
42.3
 
00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
and then i carried that number into the
 
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
actual worksheet
 
00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:32.639 align:start position:0%
that has all the different revenue
 
00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:35.199 align:start position:0%
sources in it and
 
00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:38.639 align:start position:0%
before you go any further uh chris
 
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
referred to worksheet number three
 
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
the latest handout that we were emailed
 
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
go ahead okay this stop is going to rose
 
00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:52.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 align:start position:0%
um so i'm looking at the excel document
 
00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
00:06:59.350 --> 00:06:59.360 align:start position:0%
um the sheet tab that's dra hi-lo
 
00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.870 align:start position:0%
um the sheet tab that's dra hi-lo
estimate

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
estimate
 
00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:02.800 align:start position:0%
okay if you click that open if you're
 
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
looking at um
 
00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:09.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:12.560 align:start position:0%
so in that row 13 is the interest in
 
00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:13.510 align:start position:0%
so in that row 13 is the interest in
dividends

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
dividends
 
00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
and column b is where you see the first
 
00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:19.360 align:start position:0%
change to 135.5 and as a result of that
 
00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.390 align:start position:0%
change to 135.5 and as a result of that
change

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:24.080 align:start position:0%
columns d and f um increased
 
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
and then in the communication services
 
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
they the dra provider
 
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
16 provided a new number of 38.8 based
 
00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:31.270 align:start position:0%
16 provided a new number of 38.8 based
on

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:34.479 align:start position:0%
january information so that
 
00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
there was no um change in in the 2223
 
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
it's a flat
 
00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
estimate throughout and the same with
 
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
the utah
 
00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:44.800 align:start position:0%
utility property tax on line 22 gave you
 
00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
a new number of 42.3
 
00:07:49.749 --> 00:07:49.759 align:start position:0%
um and they make no estimate on a higher
 
00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:50.560 align:start position:0%
low for the
 
00:07:53.909 --> 00:07:53.919 align:start position:0%
that revenue source mainly because those
 
00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
two revenue sources are fairly stable
 
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
the communication services tax they feel
 
00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
is starting to um
 
00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
plateau i mean for a while was
 
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:05.360 align:start position:0%
continually going down but
 
00:08:06.869 --> 00:08:06.879 align:start position:0%
with some changes i think they
 
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
anticipate it should be
 
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
flattening out and the same with the
 
00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
utility property that's a fairly
 
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
um stable revenue source
 
00:08:19.589 --> 00:08:19.599 align:start position:0%
it's fairly consistent um
 
00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
so i see a couple hands up represent
 
00:08:23.029 --> 00:08:23.039 align:start position:0%
major i don't know
 
00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
well representative
 
00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
just a quick technical point uh could we
 
00:08:32.709 --> 00:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
refer to this spreadsheet as february 2
 
00:08:34.149 --> 00:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't say it's the third
 
00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:35.750 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't say it's the third
one

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
yep it's february 2nd 2021
 
00:08:42.469 --> 00:08:42.479 align:start position:0%
is the date that's in the spreadsheet
 
00:08:43.269 --> 00:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
again because of when the conversations
 
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
i i can put it up on the screen i know
 
00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
that when i share a screen or somebody
 
00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
shares a screen sometimes it
 
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
creates challenges for members when
 
00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
they're trying to look at stuff that
 
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
they have on their screen
 
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
so i guess i would take guidance from
 
00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
the committee when you want me to share
 
00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:08.710 align:start position:0%
the committee when you want me to share
something

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:08.720 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:09:10.949 --> 00:09:10.959 align:start position:0%
otherwise i'll just try to guide you
 
00:09:10.959 --> 00:09:12.150 align:start position:0%
otherwise i'll just try to guide you
verbally

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:12.160 align:start position:0%
verbally
 
00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
i think um by putting it on the screen
 
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
very meaningful yeah it's good
 
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:20.800 align:start position:0%
okay i just know like if some people are
 
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
trying to do stuff on their
 
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
own it sometimes causes a problem so
 
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
i'll share it and
 
00:09:38.389 --> 00:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
so you should you should see the excel
 
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
sheet now
 
00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
yes we do so that the tab is the dra
 
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
high low estimate tab
 
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
and then this is the the row that was
 
00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.710 align:start position:0%
and then this is the the row that was
impacted

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
impacted
 
00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
first the interest and dividends and the
 
00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
135 is
 
00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
the number that they gave you that was
 
00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.430 align:start position:0%
the number that they gave you that was
new

00:09:59.430 --> 00:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
new
 
00:10:02.829 --> 00:10:02.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:16.640 align:start position:0%
better or still needed to be larger
 
00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
that's great
 
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
okay yes and then the next one was the
 
00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
the communication services tax which
 
00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:24.949 align:start position:0%
the communication services tax which
again

00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:24.959 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
uh it was just a flat number they
 
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
changed it's a 38.8
 
00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
um i think it was 38.2 last time
 
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:34.360 align:start position:0%
and then the utility property tax was
 
00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.269 align:start position:0%
and then the utility property tax was
42.3

00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
42.3
 
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
and that was a decrease from the
 
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
previous estimate was 43
 
00:10:44.389 --> 00:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
i feel like it was 43.2 but i'd have to
 
00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:46.160 align:start position:0%
look back at an old sheet
 
00:10:48.389 --> 00:10:48.399 align:start position:0%
and then those changes carry forward
 
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
into the next tab
 
00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
the gf etf worksheet
 
00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
so if you go to column g you should see
 
00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
the 135
 
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
and then the same thing for
 
00:11:05.829 --> 00:11:05.839 align:start position:0%
communications you'll see it's 38 all
 
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:11.200 align:start position:0%
and then in the utility property tax you
 
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
so that was the only changes to the
 
00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
worksheet everything else stayed the
 
00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:26.470 align:start position:0%
worksheet everything else stayed the
same

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
so i don't know what you want to do at
 
00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
this point represent major or how you
 
00:11:29.829 --> 00:11:29.839 align:start position:0%
want to
 
00:11:29.839 --> 00:11:33.590 align:start position:0%
want to
proceed

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:36.949 --> 00:11:36.959 align:start position:0%
what i would like to be able to do is
 
00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:40.720 align:start position:0%
get an agreement on those taxes that we
 
00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable with
 
00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:52.160 align:start position:0%
to me the first good candidate on that
 
00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
the insurance
 
00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:59.590 align:start position:0%
the insurance
tax

00:11:59.590 --> 00:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:03.200 align:start position:0%
they've always been pretty right on
 
00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
had his hand up that's all i was going
 
00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
to say
 
00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
you're muted pat
 
00:12:36.389 --> 00:12:36.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:37.829 --> 00:12:37.839 align:start position:0%
make a motion that we accept the
 
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
insurance numbers as is
 
00:12:42.949 --> 00:12:42.959 align:start position:0%
um she has a good history of
 
00:12:45.829 --> 00:12:45.839 align:start position:0%
of knowing her stuff and doing pretty
 
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
good revenue estimates
 
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
the last presentation she made was as
 
00:12:52.069 --> 00:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
detailed as you're going to get i mean
 
00:12:53.509 --> 00:12:53.519 align:start position:0%
she broke it down into the
 
00:12:56.629 --> 00:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
microscopic portions of of what makes up
 
00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
this these revenues
 
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
and i i don't see how we can um
 
00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
i don't know what she said makes sense
 
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
to me is what i'm getting at so
 
00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
uh i just make the motion and we'll have
 
00:13:08.629 --> 00:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
the discussion
 
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh but i think i i you know
 
00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
i i don't think any of us could come oh
 
00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
i know i can't come up with any numbers
 
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
better than
 
00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:20.240 align:start position:0%
what she has done here so thank you
 
00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
representative bromley made the motion
 
00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
we accept
 
00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:26.240 align:start position:0%
the numbers that the insurance company
 
00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:26.949 align:start position:0%
the numbers that the insurance company
insurance

00:13:26.949 --> 00:13:26.959 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
agency has come up with uh anybody
 
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
second that
 
00:13:34.069 --> 00:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy okay
 
00:13:38.949 --> 00:13:38.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
um yeah representative ames
 
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
i just want to be sure this the uh
 
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
are we are we doing two a high and a low
 
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
um or a single figure yes
 
00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
where we feel it's necessary
 
00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
uh high and low then
 
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:12.160 align:start position:0%
don't take this wrong this is where our
 
00:14:15.189 --> 00:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
best estimate is at this point in time
 
00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
of current law things may change
 
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
two weeks from now and we're going to
 
00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
continually look at these things
 
00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
and if the changes are such that we need
 
00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:29.350 align:start position:0%
and if the changes are such that we need
to

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
make a change in our estimates and we
 
00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:32.720 align:start position:0%
will do that
 
00:14:34.629 --> 00:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
but the information that we have at this
 
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
point in time
 
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
and from and that means
 
00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
listening to the economists listening to
 
00:14:43.269 --> 00:14:43.279 align:start position:0%
the experts
 
00:14:48.069 --> 00:14:48.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
and what we know this will be our best
 
00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
guesstimate at this point in time so for
 
00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
this round we'll
 
00:14:58.629 --> 00:14:58.639 align:start position:0%
do a high and a low on the other
 
00:14:59.750 --> 00:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
agencies it doesn't
 
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh pertain to this particular
 
00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
set of estimates um because they're all
 
00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
the same
 
00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm fine with them going forward
 
00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
with the motion
 
00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
can i chime in please yes
 
00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
yeah again the spreadsheet's only set up
 
00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:18.310 align:start position:0%
yeah again the spreadsheet's only set up
for

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh a single number uh
 
00:15:25.509 --> 00:15:25.519 align:start position:0%
well i guess i guess chris
 
00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:28.160 align:start position:0%
can i ask a question of course we get to
 
00:15:30.069 --> 00:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
the ones where dra day array gave us the
 
00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
high and so the lows
 
00:15:34.389 --> 00:15:34.399 align:start position:0%
did this the spreadsheet is it is it's
 
00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
it's not really set up for highs and
 
00:15:37.269 --> 00:15:37.279 align:start position:0%
lows yet
 
00:15:39.829 --> 00:15:39.839 align:start position:0%
before when we get so reps on broadway
 
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
as you can see i just added another row
 
00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
yep it's magic you can easily add the
 
00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
second row and make it high low
 
00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
if that's the desire of the committee
 
00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:50.240 align:start position:0%
but in the
 
00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
can i just ask a clarifying question as
 
00:15:54.069 --> 00:15:54.079 align:start position:0%
the committee's starting to discuss this
 
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
at the end of this process you're going
 
00:15:57.509 --> 00:15:57.519 align:start position:0%
to have a single number correct
 
00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
yes yes because i i'm not sure if
 
00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
people on the committee have heard but
 
00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
finance is already
 
00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
looking to get the ways and means
 
00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
estimates might be as they start to work
 
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
on the budget
 
00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
right the vice chair of finance
 
00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
called me or i called her because she
 
00:16:17.749 --> 00:16:17.759 align:start position:0%
sent me an email
 
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
and we discussed this last night and our
 
00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:21.509 align:start position:0%
and we discussed this last night and our
goal

00:16:21.509 --> 00:16:21.519 align:start position:0%
goal
 
00:16:24.949 --> 00:16:24.959 align:start position:0%
is on the 23rd is to hand them our
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
estimate at that point in time they're
 
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
very happy with that
 
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
and our estimates will be will contain
 
00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
both highs and lows
 
00:16:35.189 --> 00:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
on those that we feel there ought to be
 
00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:36.320 align:start position:0%
a spread
 
00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
and then a single number
 
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
on such as the insurance so
 
00:16:44.949 --> 00:16:44.959 align:start position:0%
they're happy with that so our goal is
 
00:16:46.629 --> 00:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
on the 23rd to be able to
 
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
provide that in between
 
00:16:51.749 --> 00:16:51.759 align:start position:0%
we're going to be working them we're
 
00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
also going to be sitting down with the
 
00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
governor's budget director
 
00:16:59.749 --> 00:16:59.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
because by that by that time
 
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
well we know the governor's presenting
 
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
his budget i believe
 
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
on the 11th i said chris to the yes he's
 
00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:12.959 align:start position:0%
going to be presenting
 
00:17:15.669 --> 00:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
on the 11th i believe at noon time i'm
 
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
not sure
 
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
what the format is yet it's going to be
 
00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
some sort of a remote but i'm not sure
 
00:17:22.789 --> 00:17:22.799 align:start position:0%
what type of remote setting it's going
 
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:24.720 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
the intention is that usually what
 
00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
happens when the governor presents his
 
00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
budget is our office will get hard
 
00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:32.070 align:start position:0%
budget is our office will get hard
copies

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
copies
 
00:17:33.909 --> 00:17:33.919 align:start position:0%
of the budget as well as the budget
 
00:17:33.919 --> 00:17:35.430 align:start position:0%
of the budget as well as the budget
summary

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
summary
 
00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
so we anticipate we're going to get the
 
00:17:39.669 --> 00:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
those documents
 
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
sometime around noon one o'clock on
 
00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:44.150 align:start position:0%
sometime around noon one o'clock on
thursday

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
thursday
 
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
11th and we will email and excuse me we
 
00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
will mail
 
00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
a hard copy of the um governor's budget
 
00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:52.070 align:start position:0%
a hard copy of the um governor's budget
summary

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
summary
 
00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
to all the ways and means members so
 
00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
and then um from that point
 
00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
we'll have something obviously go on our
 
00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
website as well but i will also try to
 
00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
extrapolate the governor's numbers into
 
00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
a format so that you can see them so
 
00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
um typically on this this worksheet
 
00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:18.160 align:start position:0%
see where row nine is usually right
 
00:18:19.909 --> 00:18:19.919 align:start position:0%
after the official plan we'll put in the
 
00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
governor's estimates but we hadn't had
 
00:18:22.549 --> 00:18:22.559 align:start position:0%
them yet so i didn't
 
00:18:24.789 --> 00:18:24.799 align:start position:0%
have a row for that yet but once we get
 
00:18:26.549 --> 00:18:26.559 align:start position:0%
them i can put them in here so you can
 
00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:28.160 align:start position:0%
see how they sit
 
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
um compared to comparative to the plan
 
00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
for 21 as well as the agency high low
 
00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
estimates and then
 
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
how they would compare to the agency
 
00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
estimates for 22 and 23.
 
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
um having not seen the governor's
 
00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
estimates yet
 
00:18:43.909 --> 00:18:43.919 align:start position:0%
what i don't know is um what
 
00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
changes there are to revenues which
 
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
might impact
 
00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
um the numbers so i that's something
 
00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
where i may need to discuss with matt
 
00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:52.640 align:start position:0%
may you who's the governor's budget
 
00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
director to try to peel away
 
00:18:58.630 --> 00:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
um changes in the revenues streams
 
00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
you know there's a suggested
 
00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
tax change that they're incorporating in
 
00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
their estimate we'll need to peel that
 
00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:06.549 align:start position:0%
their estimate we'll need to peel that
out

00:19:06.549 --> 00:19:06.559 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
um he is going to come matt is scheduled
 
00:19:11.909 --> 00:19:11.919 align:start position:0%
to come before you on the 18th
 
00:19:15.669 --> 00:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
right to discuss the the governor's um
 
00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
address any questions the committee
 
00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
might have and i think between now and
 
00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
then as you work on
 
00:19:25.029 --> 00:19:25.039 align:start position:0%
estimates and and you hear the
 
00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
governor's presentation you may have
 
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
a fair amount of questions the other
 
00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
piece that's going to be different this
 
00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:32.480 align:start position:0%
year about the budget
 
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
um is that house bill 2 needs to come
 
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
out at the same time as the budget there
 
00:19:38.789 --> 00:19:38.799 align:start position:0%
was a piece put in the um
 
00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:40.799 align:start position:0%
last house bill 4 which it was the
 
00:19:43.029 --> 00:19:43.039 align:start position:0%
trailer bill that required that
 
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
so hopefully that will help with
 
00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:46.789 align:start position:0%
so hopefully that will help with
identifying

00:19:46.789 --> 00:19:46.799 align:start position:0%
identifying
 
00:19:48.549 --> 00:19:48.559 align:start position:0%
for this committee identifying where
 
00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
there might be tax changes being
 
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.350 align:start position:0%
there might be tax changes being
suggested

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
suggested
 
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
if there are any i don't know but if
 
00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
there are you could at least see that
 
00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
language that's associated with that
 
00:19:58.630 --> 00:19:58.640 align:start position:0%
um at this point i don't know what the
 
00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
format will look like
 
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
again it's the governor's budget um it
 
00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
hasn't been drafted
 
00:20:08.149 --> 00:20:08.159 align:start position:0%
by the office of legislative services as
 
00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
of yet
 
00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
but they're supposed to provide language
 
00:20:12.549 --> 00:20:12.559 align:start position:0%
at this time
 
00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:16.640 align:start position:0%
on the 11th just as soon after the 11th
 
00:20:20.149 --> 00:20:20.159 align:start position:0%
lpa should be providing us with that
 
00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
what information they can relative to
 
00:20:26.149 --> 00:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
the revenues on the governor's budget
 
00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:28.480 align:start position:0%
we will have two hours with the
 
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
governor's budget director on the 18th
 
00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
so we can determine how much of his
 
00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates our current law and
 
00:20:37.909 --> 00:20:37.919 align:start position:0%
what's not
 
00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
current law which would be in house bill
 
00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:42.390 align:start position:0%
current law which would be in house bill
2.

00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
2.
 
00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
so we can differentiate between the two
 
00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:46.149 align:start position:0%
so we can differentiate between the two
and

00:20:46.149 --> 00:20:46.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
we need to provide the best of the
 
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
finance committee is revenue estimates
 
00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
for current law
 
00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
and then anything other than current law
 
00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:12.149 --> 00:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
anything else on that quest i don't but
 
00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
i i see reps on
 
00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
me and reps over brahmi both have their
 
00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:20.240 align:start position:0%
thank you there's a lot to unpack at
 
00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
this point but
 
00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
on first a request on
 
00:21:28.149 --> 00:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
are you going to to send to all of us
 
00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
whatever you can
 
00:21:32.789 --> 00:21:32.799 align:start position:0%
manage of what the governor's
 
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
revenue uh proposals and estimates
 
00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:40.480 align:start position:0%
are uh are about by uh
 
00:21:43.669 --> 00:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
by email or send us a link that you put
 
00:21:45.669 --> 00:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
up on the website
 
00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
because uh some of us live in the 037
 
00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:50.320 align:start position:0%
zip code and won't get
 
00:21:53.029 --> 00:21:53.039 align:start position:0%
mail for well these days maybe a week
 
00:21:54.789 --> 00:21:54.799 align:start position:0%
and a half
 
00:21:57.909 --> 00:21:57.919 align:start position:0%
um so yes that's the short answer to
 
00:21:58.950 --> 00:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
your question
 
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
so we'll eat we will mail you a hard
 
00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
copy of the governor's budget summary
 
00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
which will have your the revenues in
 
00:22:06.789 --> 00:22:06.799 align:start position:0%
there um but we
 
00:22:08.149 --> 00:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
also will be putting stuff on our
 
00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
website or links on our website to the
 
00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
governor's budget in the summary and
 
00:22:13.669 --> 00:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
that i will email you
 
00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
and if i'm able to comfortably
 
00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
identify his revenues from what might be
 
00:22:20.549 --> 00:22:20.559 align:start position:0%
changes i'll
 
00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
put together something in a spreadsheet
 
00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
for you probably
 
00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
add it to the worksheet and send that to
 
00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
the members as well
 
00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
if i'm having issues or i can't get it
 
00:22:31.029 --> 00:22:31.039 align:start position:0%
done quickly i'll let you know that as
 
00:22:31.039 --> 00:22:33.190 align:start position:0%
done quickly i'll let you know that as
well

00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
what i don't want to do is is compound
 
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
for instance if if they show me a
 
00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
business tax number
 
00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
and i haven't been able to reach out to
 
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
matt to understand
 
00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
how they got to their number because
 
00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
they have language that is changing the
 
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
tax rates
 
00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
i don't want to put it in there to show
 
00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
that that's the number because there's
 
00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
going to be an adjustment if we want to
 
00:22:54.149 --> 00:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
stick with
 
00:22:58.390 --> 00:22:58.400 align:start position:0%
um current law so for those members that
 
00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
were on the committee two years ago
 
00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
you'll recall we had a sheet
 
00:23:05.669 --> 00:23:05.679 align:start position:0%
where the top half was current law and
 
00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
then the bottom half was
 
00:23:08.549 --> 00:23:08.559 align:start position:0%
the changes that were being proposed by
 
00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
the governor and then by the house and
 
00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
i'm anticipating creating that type of
 
00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
because when i talk to governor's budget
 
00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
director he understands
 
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to be talking to him to
 
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.350 align:start position:0%
we're going to be talking to him to
identify

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
identify
 
00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:27.200 align:start position:0%
what those revenues are under current
 
00:23:30.549 --> 00:23:30.559 align:start position:0%
law and those that
 
00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
rely upon house bill 2. yep mr chairman
 
00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
yes the second point was
 
00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
on if if we can somehow make
 
00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:46.640 align:start position:0%
time that we consider on
 
00:23:48.789 --> 00:23:48.799 align:start position:0%
the proposals of his that we don't have
 
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
as bills already
 
00:23:53.909 --> 00:23:53.919 align:start position:0%
and provide information on them to the
 
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
finance committee because
 
00:23:58.310 --> 00:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
in the past the finance committee has
 
00:23:59.830 --> 00:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes gone ahead
 
00:24:03.029 --> 00:24:03.039 align:start position:0%
with tax changes that
 
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
they didn't really understand and that
 
00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:11.029 --> 00:24:11.039 align:start position:0%
this is why i'm talking about my own
 
00:24:12.549 --> 00:24:12.559 align:start position:0%
party here
 
00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:16.240 align:start position:0%
so this is why we're having that meeting
 
00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
on the 18th to identify this
 
00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
and then we can attack each and every
 
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
one of these changes
 
00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
on house bill 2 that's required for
 
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
their revenues
 
00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah representative brown
 
00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:33.990 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah representative brown
niece

00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
niece
 
00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
you have your hands up yep i do uh so uh
 
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
i think for the for the committee we've
 
00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:40.240 align:start position:0%
really got to understand when we're
 
00:24:41.029 --> 00:24:41.039 align:start position:0%
going to put this
 
00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:44.240 align:start position:0%
first stake in the ground officially uh
 
00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of a resolution to the house
 
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.269 align:start position:0%
in terms of a resolution to the house
floor

00:24:47.269 --> 00:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
floor
 
00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
to me that becomes the official
 
00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
statement of this committee as to
 
00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
what we think the revenues are and i
 
00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
understand that as the months go on
 
00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to be updating that and
 
00:24:59.510 --> 00:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
probably have additional resolutions
 
00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
but uh i i would imagine that finance is
 
00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
going to take that resolute their first
 
00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
resolution is the number they have to
 
00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
work with is that is that a safe to say
 
00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
and uh when do you think that will be
 
00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
that we have to do that
 
00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:20.950 align:start position:0%
that we have to do that
20

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:22.480 align:start position:0%
you're scheduled to meet the 23rd
 
00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
representative on the 23rd
 
00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:30.320 align:start position:0%
i told lynn it was then over
 
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
that we would be meeting to put together
 
00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:38.240 align:start position:0%
our draft numbers and
 
00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
she will run with those draft numbers
 
00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
because to get a resolution
 
00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
we need to be able to get it to a
 
00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:48.470 align:start position:0%
we need to be able to get it to a
session

00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to have to talk to the
 
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
speaker to see
 
00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
we know we're going to have a session on
 
00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
the 24th and 25th
 
00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
to see if we can uh it would be too late
 
00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
to do a resolution on either the 24th to
 
00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:06.789 align:start position:0%
to do a resolution on either the 24th to
25th

00:26:06.789 --> 00:26:06.799 align:start position:0%
25th
 
00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
even if it is they're going to run with
 
00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
our draft numbers
 
00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
those draft numbers going to be a range
 
00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
i think traditionally it's not been
 
00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
arranged correct
 
00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
what we will do is for
 
00:26:24.549 --> 00:26:24.559 align:start position:0%
the finance committee split the
 
00:26:24.559 --> 00:26:25.750 align:start position:0%
the finance committee split the
difference

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
difference
 
00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:29.440 align:start position:0%
but we'll still have our range
 
00:26:33.269 --> 00:26:33.279 align:start position:0%
and for for a uh house resolution
 
00:26:36.149 --> 00:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
we did that last last time that was
 
00:26:39.669 --> 00:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
susan we had a range
 
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
but i think uh chair mr chair i think
 
00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
that was
 
00:26:44.789 --> 00:26:44.799 align:start position:0%
that wasn't the last time was in the
 
00:26:44.799 --> 00:26:45.909 align:start position:0%
that wasn't the last time was in the
summer

00:26:45.909 --> 00:26:45.919 align:start position:0%
summer
 
00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
last time was after the virus hit
 
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
i don't think i don't think the
 
00:26:53.029 --> 00:26:53.039 align:start position:0%
resolution the official resolution that
 
00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:54.640 align:start position:0%
we did during the budget cycle which was
 
00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
well before covert
 
00:26:58.470 --> 00:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
those ranges we did the range maybe i'm
 
00:26:59.750 --> 00:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
mistaken but i if i
 
00:27:01.669 --> 00:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
we can double check that but my
 
00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
recollection is that
 
00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
for the budget we gave them a number for
 
00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:06.320 align:start position:0%
each of these
 
00:27:08.549 --> 00:27:08.559 align:start position:0%
revenue streams we will do what makes
 
00:27:08.559 --> 00:27:10.070 align:start position:0%
revenue streams we will do what makes
sense

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
sense
 
00:27:13.669 --> 00:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
at that at the point in time
 
00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
so so representative abrami is correct
 
00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
in that
 
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
house resolutions 16 was done over the
 
00:27:21.669 --> 00:27:21.679 align:start position:0%
summer was a range
 
00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
the ways and means committee wanted a
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
range because of all the
 
00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
dynamic issues that you were dealing
 
00:27:28.549 --> 00:27:28.559 align:start position:0%
with at that time there was just a lot
 
00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
of unknowns
 
00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
and it was the best information was
 
00:27:33.269 --> 00:27:33.279 align:start position:0%
arranged at that time
 
00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
prior to that for the budget it was a
 
00:27:36.549 --> 00:27:36.559 align:start position:0%
single number
 
00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
for each of the revenue categories which
 
00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:41.350 align:start position:0%
for each of the revenue categories which
makes

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
makes
 
00:27:42.789 --> 00:27:42.799 align:start position:0%
probably better sense because you don't
 
00:27:44.389 --> 00:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
want the finance committee potentially
 
00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
spending more money than
 
00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
there's finances to but revenues to take
 
00:27:50.789 --> 00:27:50.799 align:start position:0%
care of
 
00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
yeah and we can make that decision
 
00:28:00.149 --> 00:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
but we'll still operate with the range
 
00:28:07.909 --> 00:28:07.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:11.269 --> 00:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
they'll also know what our range is too
 
00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh representative romney
 
00:28:18.789 --> 00:28:18.799 align:start position:0%
yep no i'm i'm sad
 
00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:20.480 align:start position:0%
oh okay you have your hand up oh i
 
00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
forgot to put it down thank you
 
00:28:27.269 --> 00:28:27.279 align:start position:0%
all right any further questions from
 
00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:41.669 --> 00:28:41.679 align:start position:0%
thank you on just to go back to
 
00:28:41.679 --> 00:28:42.789 align:start position:0%
thank you on just to go back to
insurance

00:28:42.789 --> 00:28:42.799 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
i believe that this one we
 
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
only get um analyzed real numbers
 
00:28:53.269 --> 00:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
in april so
 
00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
what she's given us i think has to be
 
00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
the best we're going to get
 
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
they are very good at this right
 
00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
and when we look at this again in may
 
00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
and june right before the committee
 
00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:12.630 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:12.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
any further questions on the insurance
 
00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
all right um then this is what we'll
 
00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
without any objection this is what we're
 
00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
go with at this point in time
 
00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:38.320 align:start position:0%

mr chairman do you want us to make a
 
00:31:28.389 --> 00:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
motion each time or shall we just
 
00:31:28.399 --> 00:31:28.950 align:start position:0%
motion each time or shall we just
discuss

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
discuss
 
00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:33.200 align:start position:0%
it first why don't we discuss it
 
00:31:35.909 --> 00:31:35.919 align:start position:0%
on column p which is statewide property
 
00:31:35.919 --> 00:31:37.269 align:start position:0%
on column p which is statewide property
tax

00:31:37.269 --> 00:31:37.279 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
that's set by statute at this point in
 
00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:40.640 align:start position:0%
time statute
 
00:31:44.389 --> 00:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
hasn't been changed um
 
00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
the statute calls for 363.1 million
 
00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:49.350 align:start position:0%
the statute calls for 363.1 million
dollars

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes it varies those 1.2 or
 
00:31:58.630 --> 00:31:58.640 align:start position:0%
whatever anybody have any comments
 
00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
no i i i agree that uh we should
 
00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
simply put down 363.1 as the statutory
 
00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:06.789 align:start position:0%
simply put down 363.1 as the statutory
number

00:32:06.789 --> 00:32:06.799 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:32:10.149 --> 00:32:10.159 align:start position:0%
um its current law okay
 
00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
then one is the representative romney i
 
00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
can carbohydrate as well does anybody
 
00:32:19.269 --> 00:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:19.279 --> 00:32:23.110 align:start position:0%
 
then

00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
the statewide property tax is defined in
 
00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:26.830 align:start position:0%
the statewide property tax is defined in
column

00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
column
 
00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
p at 363.1
 
00:32:34.549 --> 00:32:34.559 align:start position:0%
will go with that at this point in time
 
00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
another candidate you may want to
 
00:32:42.549 --> 00:32:42.559 align:start position:0%
consider is
 
00:32:46.789 --> 00:32:46.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:50.149 --> 00:32:50.159 align:start position:0%

so i'm going to let the committee
 
00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:11.909 --> 00:33:11.919 align:start position:0%
representative elmi first
 
00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:15.200 align:start position:0%
on i think we should take
 
00:33:17.909 --> 00:33:17.919 align:start position:0%
their numbers the default of anything
 
00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
else but i do wonder if either of our
 
00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:21.440 align:start position:0%

well as a former lawyer i don't
 
00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:46.789 --> 00:33:46.799 align:start position:0%

i believe these numbers are are
 
00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
from the national consortium that is
 
00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
spending all of their time working on
 
00:34:26.069 --> 00:34:26.079 align:start position:0%
what the number
 
00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
well just a question is is there
 
00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
i can't remember is there a possibility
 
00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
that they'll come back to us with new
 
00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:38.389 align:start position:0%
that they'll come back to us with new
information

00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
and a different number you know there
 
00:34:42.069 --> 00:34:42.079 align:start position:0%
always is
 
00:34:45.669 --> 00:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
because over the years uh it does change
 
00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes and it depends upon
 
00:34:52.149 --> 00:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
you know there's a possibility it may
 
00:34:53.430 --> 00:34:53.440 align:start position:0%
even go up a bit
 
00:34:56.069 --> 00:34:56.079 align:start position:0%
but i don't know how far behind they are
 
00:34:56.079 --> 00:34:56.710 align:start position:0%
but i don't know how far behind they are
because

00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:56.720 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:35:00.829 --> 00:35:00.839 align:start position:0%
it seems like smoking has gone up a bit
 
00:35:00.839 --> 00:35:03.990 align:start position:0%
it seems like smoking has gone up a bit
since

00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
these are good numbers right now we
 
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
don't have anything else so i think
 
00:35:11.109 --> 00:35:11.119 align:start position:0%
right smart just put it in
 
00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
so can we uh anybody have any objections
 
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
christie has been putting his hand up
 
00:35:19.829 --> 00:35:19.839 align:start position:0%
not virtually
 
00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
chris i can't put my hand up virtually
 
00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
because i'm a co-host
 
00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
so i have to raise it in the screen
 
00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
let's apologize
 
00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to um responded uh
 
00:35:33.109 --> 00:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
representative ames question when uh mr
 
00:35:35.109 --> 00:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
saison came and spoke with you he
 
00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
indicated that the soonest they might
 
00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
have any new information might be in
 
00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:39.430 align:start position:0%
have any new information might be in
april

00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
april
 
00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
when settlement money comes in they may
 
00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:43.349 align:start position:0%
when settlement money comes in they may
have

00:35:43.349 --> 00:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:44.720 align:start position:0%
at that point they may have some other
 
00:35:46.349 --> 00:35:46.359 align:start position:0%
information that may impact going into
 
00:35:50.069 --> 00:35:50.079 align:start position:0%
22-23 but he wasn't um
 
00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
overly optimistic about that um
 
00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
and then when you're done when you when
 
00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
you've agreed on what you want to do
 
00:35:57.829 --> 00:35:57.839 align:start position:0%
with tobacco settlement i just wanted to
 
00:35:58.870 --> 00:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
bring up one issue
 
00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
related to it that's it's not directly
 
00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
tied to the revenues
 
00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
indirectly okay uh
 
00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
just as soon as we're finished what
 
00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
might make a change
 
00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
is the non the amount of money that's
 
00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
been put together
 
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
by the non-participating manufacturers
 
00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:22.240 align:start position:0%
and that will be decided on the
 
00:36:26.069 --> 00:36:26.079 align:start position:0%
month you receive in april
 
00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
ahead press so
 
00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:33.200 align:start position:0%
in in the education trust fund statute
 
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
it um basically is a flat figure for the
 
00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
tobacco settlement it says that 40
 
00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
million dollars of the tobacco
 
00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
settlement will be deposited there
 
00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
i was talking with the comptroller um
 
00:36:45.589 --> 00:36:45.599 align:start position:0%
yesterday or the
 
00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
day before um and and she's wondering if
 
00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
that maybe that language should be
 
00:36:53.109 --> 00:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
amended to an up to 40 million amount if
 
00:36:55.109 --> 00:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
we start to collect
 
00:36:57.030 --> 00:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
less than 40 million from the tobacco
 
00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:58.230 align:start position:0%
less than 40 million from the tobacco
settlement

00:36:58.230 --> 00:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
settlement
 
00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:00.720 align:start position:0%
and i believe the concern is um will
 
00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
some people interpret that that there
 
00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
needs to be
 
00:37:05.109 --> 00:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
40 million dollars put into the trust
 
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
fund even if the settlement money
 
00:37:09.829 --> 00:37:09.839 align:start position:0%
doesn't bring in 40 million
 
00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
so it's just an issue um i've asked her
 
00:37:13.109 --> 00:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
to check
 
00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
with the governor's um office to see if
 
00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
they've had any concerns with that and
 
00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
if they've included anything or
 
00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:20.720 align:start position:0%
plan on including anything in their
 
00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
budget proposal
 
00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
but if not it may be something that you
 
00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:26.720 align:start position:0%
know you guys might want to consider
 
00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:28.720 align:start position:0%
and then we talk to finance and see if
 
00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
they can put something in maybe house
 
00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
very good point because particularly
 
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
where the
 
00:37:38.069 --> 00:37:38.079 align:start position:0%
estimates are going down in the out
 
00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
years we've been so far we've collected
 
00:37:41.349 --> 00:37:41.359 align:start position:0%
40 million plus
 
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
every year even though the estimate for
 
00:37:45.589 --> 00:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
last year was 39 and change
 
00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
uh we still got 42 million we don't know
 
00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
and and and based
 
00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
on the conversation um the attorney
 
00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:54.320 align:start position:0%
wasn't real optimistic we were going to
 
00:37:55.829 --> 00:37:55.839 align:start position:0%
be going back up in the 40 million
 
00:37:58.710 --> 00:37:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
one good question to ask again from
 
00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
the attorney general next time you see
 
00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
him how much of that
 
00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
42 and a half million dollars we
 
00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:10.150 align:start position:0%
42 and a half million dollars we
received

00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
received
 
00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:16.829 --> 00:38:16.839 align:start position:0%
was due to the non-participating
 
00:38:16.839 --> 00:38:18.710 align:start position:0%
was due to the non-participating
manufacturers

00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
manufacturers
 
00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:21.440 align:start position:0%
but that is that percentage been going
 
00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
up each year
 
00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:27.190 align:start position:0%
up each year
okay

00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
all right i might even have my hand up
 
00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:32.310 align:start position:0%
all right i might even have my hand up
here

00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
thank you so just to remind the
 
00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:35.510 align:start position:0%
thank you so just to remind the
committee

00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
uh that these numbers are based on the
 
00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:40.640 align:start position:0%
amount of smoking that happens across
 
00:38:43.109 --> 00:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
the country not just new hampshire
 
00:38:45.109 --> 00:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
uh we may have had a little bit of
 
00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
oblique because of the virus in terms of
 
00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
an increase
 
00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
just like this it seems to be an
 
00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
increase in drinking and other things
 
00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:54.320 align:start position:0%
but there's no question that it's
 
00:38:55.589 --> 00:38:55.599 align:start position:0%
steadily been going down
 
00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
at least in my tenure here in the house
 
00:38:59.030 --> 00:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh that
 
00:39:01.589 --> 00:39:01.599 align:start position:0%
uh and the other data variable is is
 
00:39:01.599 --> 00:39:03.030 align:start position:0%
uh and the other data variable is is
vaping

00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
vaping
 
00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
that some people have taken up vaping
 
00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
instead of smoking
 
00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:09.200 align:start position:0%
uh but vaping is not covered under this
 
00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
settlement agreement
 
00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
only the smoking part so it makes sense
 
00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
that the numbers are going down
 
00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh the way they are so let's find a
 
00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:31.589 --> 00:39:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:37.109 --> 00:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
could representative ask also the
 
00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office
 
00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
on whether they can
 
00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
tell us if uh our
 
00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
cigarettes sold goes go up while
 
00:39:59.750 --> 00:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
on the general number is going down
 
00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
on i i believe we don't get fully
 
00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:04.720 align:start position:0%
compensated for us
 
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
going going up but i'm not sure
 
00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
how the formula works on that because we
 
00:40:13.589 --> 00:40:13.599 align:start position:0%
are getting
 
00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
considerably more at least i it may not
 
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
even be for the year that they're
 
00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
covering at this point
 
00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
it isn't are people smoking it it's
 
00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
massachusetts people smoking it
 
00:40:35.349 --> 00:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
but that is the increase
 
00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
but that may even just figure into the
 
00:40:41.589 --> 00:40:41.599 align:start position:0%
formula next year and if it does
 
00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
then we could be seeing an increase
 
00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
so ribs and volume your question is just
 
00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
to see if new hampshire benefits by the
 
00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:54.790 align:start position:0%
to see if new hampshire benefits by the
increased

00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
increased
 
00:40:57.589 --> 00:40:57.599 align:start position:0%
tobacco sales um is there some waiting
 
00:41:00.069 --> 00:41:00.079 align:start position:0%
that occurs as a result of that
 
00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
i'd like to weigh in on that i my
 
00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
recollection and i could be wrong
 
00:41:12.069 --> 00:41:12.079 align:start position:0%
is that when this when this
 
00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:14.480 align:start position:0%
settlement was reached that we were
 
00:41:15.349 --> 00:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
locked in
 
00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
to a percentage of the total
 
00:41:21.589 --> 00:41:21.599 align:start position:0%
based on smoking at that point in time
 
00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that's suggested so
 
00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
that's my recollection but we should get
 
00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
you know confirmation of that uh chris
 
00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
yep so um but i i don't think it varies
 
00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
based on
 
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
we as a state our goal ours goes up or
 
00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:37.750 align:start position:0%
we as a state our goal ours goes up or
down

00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
i know definitely that um
 
00:41:43.589 --> 00:41:43.599 align:start position:0%
that it's based on the overall is based
 
00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:44.720 align:start position:0%
on overall
 
00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:46.640 align:start position:0%
united states smoking whether it's gone
 
00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
up or down uh
 
00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of the amount of the settlement
 
00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:51.910 align:start position:0%
in terms of the amount of the settlement
but

00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:41:53.589 --> 00:41:53.599 align:start position:0%
but the question on the table is how is
 
00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
that allocated does that change
 
00:41:58.150 --> 00:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
the allocation of the total amount
 
00:41:58.160 --> 00:41:59.030 align:start position:0%
the allocation of the total amount
change

00:41:59.030 --> 00:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
or not yep
 
00:42:04.069 --> 00:42:04.079 align:start position:0%
i'll reach out to him and see what he
 
00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
would be nice to know too is
 
00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
how is the non-participating
 
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.270 align:start position:0%
how is the non-participating
manufacturers

00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
manufacturers
 
00:42:19.829 --> 00:42:19.839 align:start position:0%
affecting this from year to year
 
00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
is it do they contribute more to the pot
 
00:42:31.589 --> 00:42:31.599 align:start position:0%
or is it about the same ratio
 
00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
okay another candidate
 
00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
representative major mr chairman this is
 
00:42:39.109 --> 00:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
representative nunez i do have a
 
00:42:39.119 --> 00:42:40.069 align:start position:0%
representative nunez i do have a
question

00:42:40.069 --> 00:42:40.079 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:42:42.309 --> 00:42:42.319 align:start position:0%
yes representative i i just want
 
00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
clarification and maybe for some other
 
00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:45.839 align:start position:0%
of the other new members that are on the
 
00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
line as well uh we start out talking
 
00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
about the
 
00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
tobacco settlement column on line in and
 
00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
then i think we flipped over and started
 
00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
talking about the
 
00:42:58.550 --> 00:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
the the general tobacco tax
 
00:43:01.829 --> 00:43:01.839 align:start position:0%
in column c um can we make clarification
 
00:43:01.839 --> 00:43:02.710 align:start position:0%
in column c um can we make clarification
that

00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:02.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the possibility of less
 
00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:06.640 align:start position:0%
than 40
 
00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
in column in and uh
 
00:43:13.349 --> 00:43:13.359 align:start position:0%
credit to um to mr shea in uh
 
00:43:15.589 --> 00:43:15.599 align:start position:0%
in talking about the possible need for
 
00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
an amendment
 
00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
uh to make it up to 40 so that uh
 
00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
revenue wouldn't be
 
00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:24.160 align:start position:0%
tied up sort of out of statute or or
 
00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
be needing to be funded from somewhere
 
00:43:27.829 --> 00:43:27.839 align:start position:0%
else if 40 has to go into that account
 
00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
am i correct in
 
00:43:32.309 --> 00:43:32.319 align:start position:0%
understanding that chris
 
00:43:35.109 --> 00:43:35.119 align:start position:0%
yep so that i believe that's the concern
 
00:43:35.119 --> 00:43:35.510 align:start position:0%
yep so that i believe that's the concern
that

00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:38.240 align:start position:0%
the comptrollers has and i'm in the
 
00:43:39.589 --> 00:43:39.599 align:start position:0%
middle of um
 
00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:42.640 align:start position:0%
email exchanges with her right now so i
 
00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
had sent some information back to her
 
00:43:46.309 --> 00:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
and requested some clarification
 
00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
but i just wanted to make the committee
 
00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
aware that this may be something that's
 
00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
going to be recommended i asked her to
 
00:43:53.109 --> 00:43:53.119 align:start position:0%
put something in writing if it truly is
 
00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
so that i could share it with the
 
00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
committee so that you you could at least
 
00:43:58.309 --> 00:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
see the rationale behind it but i think
 
00:43:59.510 --> 00:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
the concern is that
 
00:44:02.309 --> 00:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
there might be an interpretation that um
 
00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:02.720 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:04.720 align:start position:0%
you have to provide 40 million dollars
 
00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
to the education trust fund and if the
 
00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
settlement is less than that how does
 
00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
that occur
 
00:44:12.309 --> 00:44:12.319 align:start position:0%
so i think just to make sure it's very
 
00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
clear to those that have to
 
00:44:18.309 --> 00:44:18.319 align:start position:0%
um apply the law
 
00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of the accounting so that
 
00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
there's no question that they're they're
 
00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
they're doing anything
 
00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
um irregular or not
 
00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
thank you mr shea that's that's what i
 
00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
understood i know that we start we
 
00:44:30.550 --> 00:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
started talking about two columns at the
 
00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
same time and it was just a little
 
00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
confusing to me
 
00:44:35.109 --> 00:44:35.119 align:start position:0%
it was i was thinking that maybe there's
 
00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
something that's tied those two columns
 
00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:37.750 align:start position:0%
something that's tied those two columns
together

00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
and i wanted to get that clarified if i
 
00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
might i think
 
00:44:43.589 --> 00:44:43.599 align:start position:0%
the the entire conversation was focused
 
00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
on the tobacco settlement
 
00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
they heard the mention of um to other
 
00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:49.030 align:start position:0%
they heard the mention of um to other
tobacco

00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
tobacco
 
00:44:51.829 --> 00:44:51.839 align:start position:0%
is the menthol sales in new hampshire
 
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
somehow factor in if we are
 
00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
having more sales in new hampshire
 
00:44:57.510 --> 00:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
factor into how it's apportioned out
 
00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of the settlement so that was a
 
00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
question that i've been asked to check
 
00:45:02.309 --> 00:45:02.319 align:start position:0%
in with the
 
00:45:05.109 --> 00:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
doj attorney about in which that revenue
 
00:45:05.119 --> 00:45:05.510 align:start position:0%
doj attorney about in which that revenue
stream

00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
stream
 
00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
come in under column c correct excuse me
 
00:45:11.109 --> 00:45:11.119 align:start position:0%
that that that revenue for the menthol
 
00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:12.880 align:start position:0%
for the menthol cigarettes would come in
 
00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
under column c
 
00:45:17.349 --> 00:45:17.359 align:start position:0%
yes yes so when you're collecting your
 
00:45:19.349 --> 00:45:19.359 align:start position:0%
tobacco tax for the state which you
 
00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
which you're not discussing at the
 
00:45:23.349 --> 00:45:23.359 align:start position:0%
moment um that would be under column c
 
00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
it was just a anecdotal comment about
 
00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
um tobacco sales generally in new
 
00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:29.750 align:start position:0%
um tobacco sales generally in new
hampshire

00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
and if we're selling more as a result of
 
00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:34.240 align:start position:0%
our surrounding states making changes
 
00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
we somehow benefit in the tobacco
 
00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
settlement as a result of that
 
00:45:39.589 --> 00:45:39.599 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i'm all cleared up
 
00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
now right we haven't
 
00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
started discussing ceo
 
00:45:51.349 --> 00:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
okay um has their hand up for episode
 
00:45:51.359 --> 00:45:52.710 align:start position:0%
okay um has their hand up for episode
major

00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:52.720 align:start position:0%
major
 
00:45:56.069 --> 00:45:56.079 align:start position:0%
okay well represented just
 
00:45:59.589 --> 00:45:59.599 align:start position:0%
just for the new people
 
00:46:02.550 --> 00:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
don't hesitate to ask questions there's
 
00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:09.109 --> 00:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
you don't get something fine ask the
 
00:46:09.119 --> 00:46:12.950 align:start position:0%
you don't get something fine ask the
question

00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:16.160 align:start position:0%
thank you just a comment to chris
 
00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
the language that you're talking about
 
00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
for the tobacco settlement would be
 
00:46:21.109 --> 00:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
something that would go
 
00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
into into house bill 2
 
00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
by the finance committee correct i i
 
00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
think so how do we do it
 
00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
i i think it the easy in my mind in
 
00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
looking at what's out there for bills
 
00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
and stuff i think that would be the
 
00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
easiest place to marry it so that it
 
00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
travels with the budget
 
00:46:42.069 --> 00:46:42.079 align:start position:0%
um i bring i mention it to you and
 
00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
you as the committee um just so you're
 
00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:45.670 align:start position:0%
you as the committee um just so you're
aware

00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
aware
 
00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
um and and and if there needs to be
 
00:46:49.829 --> 00:46:49.839 align:start position:0%
conversations between
 
00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
leadership of the ways and means
 
00:46:53.109 --> 00:46:53.119 align:start position:0%
committee and house
 
00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
finance committee um that that could be
 
00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:56.230 align:start position:0%
finance committee um that that could be
had

00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:46:59.030 --> 00:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
but again i just didn't want to um have
 
00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
something be done in house bill 2
 
00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
that is traditionally something that
 
00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
this committee would look at
 
00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
i just wanted you to be aware that
 
00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
that's a conversation that's occurring
 
00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
um and i'll i'll let you know in the
 
00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
next couple of meetings what i get back
 
00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:13.109 align:start position:0%
next couple of meetings what i get back
from

00:47:13.109 --> 00:47:13.119 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:47:15.430 --> 00:47:15.440 align:start position:0%
the comptroller and um if it is still
 
00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
something that really needs to occur or
 
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
if they've
 
00:47:20.309 --> 00:47:20.319 align:start position:0%
they've felt comfortable leaving it
 
00:47:21.589 --> 00:47:21.599 align:start position:0%
alone or not
 
00:47:23.109 --> 00:47:23.119 align:start position:0%
but again i just wanted to make mention
 
00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
of it now in case you hear or see it
 
00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:25.270 align:start position:0%
of it now in case you hear or see it
down

00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
down the road um just a follow-up
 
00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:28.549 align:start position:0%
down the road um just a follow-up
question

00:47:28.549 --> 00:47:28.559 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
because i have more information
 
00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
representative major
 
00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
yes who is that representative
 
00:47:39.829 --> 00:47:39.839 align:start position:0%
um chris i just wondered if you could
 
00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
give us the statutory reference for this
 
00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
40 million dollar
 
00:47:54.549 --> 00:47:54.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:57.990 --> 00:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
one moment 1077
 
00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
e i think it's around
 
00:48:08.309 --> 00:48:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:10.069 --> 00:48:10.079 align:start position:0%
it it's actually in the education
 
00:48:10.079 --> 00:48:12.390 align:start position:0%
it it's actually in the education
statutes

00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:31.630 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:31.630 --> 00:48:32.829 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:48:32.829 --> 00:48:32.839 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:48:32.839 --> 00:48:46.829 align:start position:0%
[Music]
stop

00:48:46.829 --> 00:48:46.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:46.839 --> 00:48:59.270 align:start position:0%
 
just

00:48:59.270 --> 00:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
it's a statement of an amount of
 
00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:02.950 align:start position:0%
it's a statement of an amount of
annually

00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
annually
 
00:49:04.309 --> 00:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
i think the comptroller is just
 
00:49:06.069 --> 00:49:06.079 align:start position:0%
concerned if you're collecting less than
 
00:49:06.079 --> 00:49:07.030 align:start position:0%
concerned if you're collecting less than
that

00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
i understand i understand it's a good
 
00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
point and it may
 
00:49:14.829 --> 00:49:14.839 align:start position:0%
need to be corrected 198.39
 
00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
yep all right thanks a lot
 
00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
okay okay we have identified three
 
00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
columns so far
 
00:49:27.829 --> 00:49:27.839 align:start position:0%
the insurance tax
 
00:49:30.549 --> 00:49:30.559 align:start position:0%
tobacco settlement and the statewide
 
00:49:31.589 --> 00:49:31.599 align:start position:0%
property tax
 
00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
as something that we have confidence in
 
00:49:37.829 --> 00:49:37.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:41.589 --> 00:49:41.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
representative court confined
 
00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
court uh fine fees
 
00:49:51.349 --> 00:49:51.359 align:start position:0%
what's in the model i was going to
 
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
suggest communication
 
00:49:56.790 --> 00:49:56.800 align:start position:0%
tax in the other
 
00:50:00.069 --> 00:50:00.079 align:start position:0%
column column l why don't we take
 
00:50:08.549 --> 00:50:08.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:24.640 align:start position:0%
person major if at any point it's
 
00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
helpful too
 
00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
to bring up the documents from um past
 
00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:29.349 align:start position:0%
to bring up the documents from um past
meetings

00:50:29.349 --> 00:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
00:50:31.109 --> 00:50:31.119 align:start position:0%
just let me know that and i can pull up
 
00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:32.720 align:start position:0%
an agency's document and that way you
 
00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:33.829 align:start position:0%
an agency's document and that way you
can

00:50:33.829 --> 00:50:33.839 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
view that on the screen together could
 
00:50:38.829 --> 00:50:38.839 align:start position:0%
you pull up this one
 
00:50:38.839 --> 00:50:52.870 align:start position:0%
you pull up this one
okay

00:50:52.870 --> 00:50:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:56.309 --> 00:50:56.319 align:start position:0%
if hey pat
 
00:50:58.390 --> 00:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
can you just take over for a minute i'll
 
00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:34.829 --> 00:51:34.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:34.839 --> 00:51:37.990 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
so that gives you um the overview and
 
00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
and when it's
 
00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:45.349 align:start position:0%
and when it's
paid

00:51:45.349 --> 00:51:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
right here's the 10-year trend for the
 
00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:49.510 align:start position:0%
right here's the 10-year trend for the
tax

00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:51:50.790 --> 00:51:50.800 align:start position:0%
right and we'll hold it right there i
 
00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
mean dying i call it a dying tax
 
00:51:56.309 --> 00:51:56.319 align:start position:0%
because basically because of the
 
00:51:58.470 --> 00:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
landlines uh people are giving up their
 
00:51:59.829 --> 00:51:59.839 align:start position:0%
landlines that which is a
 
00:52:03.109 --> 00:52:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:05.349 --> 00:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
businesses keep their landlines for for
 
00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
certain you know for a reason
 
00:52:10.870 --> 00:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh but individuals are abandoning the
 
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
landlines because they have their cell
 
00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:15.430 align:start position:0%
landlines because they have their cell
phones

00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:25.589 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:52:25.589 --> 00:52:25.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:27.589 --> 00:52:27.599 align:start position:0%
just a question i don't remember the
 
00:52:28.790 --> 00:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
answer to this but
 
00:52:31.270 --> 00:52:31.280 align:start position:0%
we all know that there's been a lot of
 
00:52:32.790 --> 00:52:32.800 align:start position:0%
zoom activity
 
00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
and that's two-way i believe so
 
00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
do we have any information on how if at
 
00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:40.230 align:start position:0%
do we have any information on how if at
all

00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:40.240 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
that activity may or will
 
00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
impact on this well the one thing we did
 
00:52:46.549 --> 00:52:46.559 align:start position:0%
we did get was that
 
00:52:49.990 --> 00:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
yes the zoom zoom is taxed and other
 
00:52:52.950 --> 00:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
other platforms like that are taxed uh i
 
00:52:55.030 --> 00:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
don't recall seeing any breakout
 
00:52:57.589 --> 00:52:57.599 align:start position:0%
chris can you recall that so when when
 
00:52:58.549 --> 00:52:58.559 align:start position:0%
the commissioner
 
00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
of dra lindsey stepp spoke to you he
 
00:53:03.030 --> 00:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
indicated that they're in discussions
 
00:53:03.589 --> 00:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:53:05.109 --> 00:53:05.119 align:start position:0%
as it relates to those types of
 
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
platforms some of
 
00:53:09.349 --> 00:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
the entities that should be paying or
 
00:53:11.589 --> 00:53:11.599 align:start position:0%
potentially be paying
 
00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
so it's an unresolved i guess at the
 
00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:15.670 align:start position:0%
so it's an unresolved i guess at the
moment

00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
moment
 
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
so that so it wasn't included i don't
 
00:53:19.589 --> 00:53:19.599 align:start position:0%
believe it was included in any of their
 
00:53:19.599 --> 00:53:20.710 align:start position:0%
believe it was included in any of their
estimates

00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:20.720 align:start position:0%
estimates
 
00:53:24.390 --> 00:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
per se um they did talk about the this
 
00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
flattening out a little bit
 
00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
and um this past session
 
00:53:32.950 --> 00:53:32.960 align:start position:0%
there was language that um clarified um
 
00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
the voip and and um
 
00:53:38.790 --> 00:53:38.800 align:start position:0%
i guess is it like flip phones uh track
 
00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:39.670 align:start position:0%
i guess is it like flip phones uh track
phones

00:53:39.670 --> 00:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
phones
 
00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
like they are communication service
 
00:53:43.990 --> 00:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
taxes applicable to those
 
00:53:45.349 --> 00:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
and there was some revenue estimates
 
00:53:46.630 --> 00:53:46.640 align:start position:0%
associated with that i think it was two
 
00:53:48.630 --> 00:53:48.640 align:start position:0%
and a half million for this uh
 
00:53:50.710 --> 00:53:50.720 align:start position:0%
this fiscal year 21 and they assumed
 
00:53:51.990 --> 00:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
that was going to help
 
00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
balance out some of the losses and
 
00:53:55.030 --> 00:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
that's why i was going to plateau to
 
00:53:57.270 --> 00:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
some extent
 
00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
yeah because when i when i looked at the
 
00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
numbers i said geez
 
00:54:02.790 --> 00:54:02.800 align:start position:0%
that's a good update on on what what
 
00:54:04.150 --> 00:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
they said
 
00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
because i i when i just looked at them
 
00:54:07.829 --> 00:54:07.839 align:start position:0%
this morning i went wow
 
00:54:10.790 --> 00:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
it looks like it flattened and it's
 
00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
bucking the trend so they must have
 
00:54:14.549 --> 00:54:14.559 align:start position:0%
factored in something for that
 
00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
and it sounds like what you just said is
 
00:54:17.829 --> 00:54:17.839 align:start position:0%
is what they've
 
00:54:21.430 --> 00:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:23.589 --> 00:54:23.599 align:start position:0%
would it be reasonable could we ask for
 
00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
an update uh
 
00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
from dra i'm sorry yeah about the zoom
 
00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:30.640 align:start position:0%
uh another related but yeah i think we
 
00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:32.240 align:start position:0%
do that maybe we maybe put this one on
 
00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:32.790 align:start position:0%
do that maybe we maybe put this one on
hold

00:54:32.790 --> 00:54:32.800 align:start position:0%
hold
 
00:54:34.069 --> 00:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
we're not going to do all the revenues
 
00:54:34.079 --> 00:54:35.829 align:start position:0%
we're not going to do all the revenues
today

00:54:35.829 --> 00:54:35.839 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:54:37.030 --> 00:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
you know we're probably going to do the
 
00:54:39.349 --> 00:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
big ones later you know business taxes
 
00:54:40.950 --> 00:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
meals and rooms you know those are the
 
00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
ones that we're still waiting for more
 
00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
information on
 
00:54:46.710 --> 00:54:46.720 align:start position:0%
um we're basically trying to trying to
 
00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:47.109 align:start position:0%
um we're basically trying to trying to
get

00:54:47.109 --> 00:54:47.119 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
some of the smaller ones up but this is
 
00:54:51.270 --> 00:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
maybe we can hold on this one today is
 
00:54:56.230 --> 00:54:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:58.950 --> 00:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
i've had my hand up for a while yep i i
 
00:54:59.589 --> 00:54:59.599 align:start position:0%
can't think
 
00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
yeah that's okay susan sorry i'll i'll
 
00:55:03.349 --> 00:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
try to remember that and just try to
 
00:55:04.230 --> 00:55:04.240 align:start position:0%
break in
 
00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh the the they are still trying to
 
00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
figure out what you
 
00:55:12.069 --> 00:55:12.079 align:start position:0%
tax consume right and zoom has been
 
00:55:12.079 --> 00:55:12.789 align:start position:0%
tax consume right and zoom has been
extremely

00:55:12.789 --> 00:55:12.799 align:start position:0%
extremely
 
00:55:14.789 --> 00:55:14.799 align:start position:0%
important and is going to continue to be
 
00:55:16.789 --> 00:55:16.799 align:start position:0%
important when it wasn't before so we
 
00:55:18.390 --> 00:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
really don't know yet whether we're
 
00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:19.190 align:start position:0%
really don't know yet whether we're
going

00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
going
 
00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
whether we're going to be able to i mean
 
00:55:22.630 --> 00:55:22.640 align:start position:0%
all we do is collect
 
00:55:26.710 --> 00:55:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:29.829 --> 00:55:29.839 align:start position:0%
and are we allowed to tax those or not
 
00:55:32.549 --> 00:55:32.559 align:start position:0%
the legislation probably needs to be
 
00:55:35.190 --> 00:55:35.200 align:start position:0%
clarified once they've gotten further
 
00:55:37.829 --> 00:55:37.839 align:start position:0%
representative this is something next
 
00:55:39.829 --> 00:55:39.839 align:start position:0%
year or the year after maybe we're going
 
00:55:39.839 --> 00:55:40.630 align:start position:0%
year or the year after maybe we're going
to

00:55:40.630 --> 00:55:40.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:55:43.829 --> 00:55:43.839 align:start position:0%
yeah we we need to get the dra
 
00:55:49.990 --> 00:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:52.870 --> 00:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
what i might suggest um you know where
 
00:55:54.549 --> 00:55:54.559 align:start position:0%
dra has a lot of these
 
00:55:56.549 --> 00:55:56.559 align:start position:0%
um taxes that probably are going to have
 
00:55:58.470 --> 00:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
questions related to them
 
00:56:01.430 --> 00:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
then that you have your discussions
 
00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
today and
 
00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
and um tuesday and that maybe i could
 
00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:05.190 align:start position:0%
and um tuesday and that maybe i could
invite

00:56:05.190 --> 00:56:05.200 align:start position:0%
invite
 
00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
dra to come back on that thursday to
 
00:56:09.349 --> 00:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
speak after the
 
00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:12.640 align:start position:0%
governor's budget person and
 
00:56:14.470 --> 00:56:14.480 align:start position:0%
to address any questions you might have
 
00:56:16.390 --> 00:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
as it relates to some of these taxes and
 
00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:16.950 align:start position:0%
as it relates to some of these taxes and
and

00:56:16.950 --> 00:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:56:19.030 --> 00:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
that may it's only a week but maybe
 
00:56:20.390 --> 00:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
there will be something new that they
 
00:56:22.630 --> 00:56:22.640 align:start position:0%
can also share
 
00:56:25.750 --> 00:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
okay okay that'd be fine and then as you
 
00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
ask questions i'll keep track of them
 
00:56:30.870 --> 00:56:30.880 align:start position:0%
and i'll provide them to draw
 
00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
for any of those taxes you might have uh
 
00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:33.910 align:start position:0%
for any of those taxes you might have uh
needing

00:56:33.910 --> 00:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
needing
 
00:56:36.630 --> 00:56:36.640 align:start position:0%
more information or just clarification
 
00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
on something
 
00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:41.440 align:start position:0%
yeah because with this curve to say
 
00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
that the future is going to be flat
 
00:56:46.150 --> 00:56:46.160 align:start position:0%
there's got to be some reason
 
00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:53.190 --> 00:56:53.200 align:start position:0%
mr chairman we do have that they've
 
00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
managed to make the void
 
00:56:58.470 --> 00:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
and flip fun ratio work
 
00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:13.270 --> 00:57:13.280 align:start position:0%
my curve is something that
 
00:57:16.549 --> 00:57:16.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:18.470 --> 00:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
and you're pretty sure that it's going
 
00:57:19.750 --> 00:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
to remain flat
 
00:57:27.829 --> 00:57:27.839 align:start position:0%
in the future i'm not sure
 
00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
question the communication service tax
 
00:57:43.750 --> 00:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
well the representative is a good one
 
00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:45.190 align:start position:0%
well the representative is a good one
there

00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:57:53.430 --> 00:57:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:56.950 --> 00:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
jenna you need to move on
 
00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
sorry i tried to use the space bar um i
 
00:58:02.390 --> 00:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned the other
 
00:58:05.109 --> 00:58:05.119 align:start position:0%
column which is l or or n if you're
 
00:58:06.829 --> 00:58:06.839 align:start position:0%
looking at the
 
00:58:06.839 --> 00:58:10.490 align:start position:0%
looking at the
spreadsheet

00:58:10.490 --> 00:58:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:12.390 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:58:15.670 --> 00:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
that one has a lot of
 
00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
revenue sources but most of revenue
 
00:58:20.710 --> 00:58:20.720 align:start position:0%
sources are extremely small
 
00:58:24.069 --> 00:58:24.079 align:start position:0%
compared to about about a half a dozen
 
00:58:24.079 --> 00:58:24.950 align:start position:0%
compared to about about a half a dozen
other

00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:58:29.349 --> 00:58:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:33.589 --> 00:58:33.599 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately when
 
00:58:36.230 --> 00:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
the time and the interest revenue was
 
00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:37.430 align:start position:0%
the time and the interest revenue was
high

00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
high
 
00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
and it dropped it was offset by
 
00:58:41.910 --> 00:58:41.920 align:start position:0%
something else
 
00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:46.390 align:start position:0%
something else
and

00:58:46.390 --> 00:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:50.150 --> 00:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
you have anything to say on on others uh
 
00:58:53.109 --> 00:58:53.119 align:start position:0%
chris just to um to piggyback your
 
00:58:54.789 --> 00:58:54.799 align:start position:0%
comment about interest revenue
 
00:58:57.190 --> 00:58:57.200 align:start position:0%
going forward they're not projecting any
 
00:58:57.200 --> 00:58:58.470 align:start position:0%
going forward they're not projecting any
um

00:58:58.470 --> 00:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:01.910 --> 00:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
revenue from interest right
 
00:59:03.750 --> 00:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
we had to benefit this last biennium
 
00:59:06.390 --> 00:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
that they were um
 
00:59:09.109 --> 00:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
we were pretty cash heavy and they were
 
00:59:10.630 --> 00:59:10.640 align:start position:0%
able to invest money and we're earning
 
00:59:11.829 --> 00:59:11.839 align:start position:0%
interest on that
 
00:59:15.270 --> 00:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
with the way everything's been going um
 
00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
they have made some adjustments so
 
00:59:19.109 --> 00:59:19.119 align:start position:0%
they're not making any predictions on
 
00:59:20.230 --> 00:59:20.240 align:start position:0%
any interest
 
00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
that would be that would be basic if we
 
00:59:23.829 --> 00:59:23.839 align:start position:0%
do get any interest going forward
 
00:59:25.670 --> 00:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
that would be one of those surprise
 
00:59:27.670 --> 00:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
revenues that maybe offsets one that
 
00:59:29.109 --> 00:59:29.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't come in as strong as they had
 
00:59:29.119 --> 00:59:30.390 align:start position:0%
doesn't come in as strong as they had
anticipated

00:59:30.390 --> 00:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
anticipated
 
00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
right but i just wanted to clarify that
 
00:59:33.829 --> 00:59:33.839 align:start position:0%
because last time last budget
 
00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of discussion about um
 
00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
interest revenue and how much was going
 
00:59:38.870 --> 00:59:38.880 align:start position:0%
to be generated
 
00:59:41.190 --> 00:59:41.200 align:start position:0%
going forward in the 22 and 23 they're
 
00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
00:59:45.670 --> 00:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
estimating any interest revenue um i
 
00:59:47.430 --> 00:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
00:59:51.430 --> 00:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
yes and who is that representative james
 
00:59:53.589 --> 00:59:53.599 align:start position:0%
uh representations would help if you
 
00:59:55.190 --> 00:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
raise your hand
 
01:00:09.430 --> 01:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
so this is a question for chris and
 
01:00:16.150 --> 01:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
i believe at times in the past
 
01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
the other column has has uh
 
01:00:22.470 --> 01:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
been added to by settlement money
 
01:00:25.349 --> 01:00:25.359 align:start position:0%
in uh individual cases now i may be
 
01:00:27.109 --> 01:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
misremembering that mostly
 
01:00:28.789 --> 01:00:28.799 align:start position:0%
many times settlement money is
 
01:00:30.549 --> 01:00:30.559 align:start position:0%
segregated into
 
01:00:34.470 --> 01:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
some special uh designated fund or
 
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
you know a specialized fund but um
 
01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:37.910 align:start position:0%
you know a specialized fund but um
sometimes

01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:40.480 align:start position:0%
not and uh so maybe you could speak to
 
01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
that and the
 
01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
follow-up question is whether
 
01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
we know or don't know if there is any um
 
01:00:51.109 --> 01:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
sort of active court cases that might
 
01:00:51.119 --> 01:00:52.950 align:start position:0%
sort of active court cases that might
trigger

01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
trigger
 
01:00:56.549 --> 01:00:56.559 align:start position:0%
settlement funds of significance
 
01:01:00.069 --> 01:01:00.079 align:start position:0%
so so the answer is yes um
 
01:01:02.069 --> 01:01:02.079 align:start position:0%
typically when you have some of the
 
01:01:03.349 --> 01:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
smaller settlements that aren't
 
01:01:05.190 --> 01:01:05.200 align:start position:0%
designated for a
 
01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
a particular purpose they'll end up in
 
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
the other category as unrestricted
 
01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
revenue you do have occasionally
 
01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
um some of the settlements that are
 
01:01:15.349 --> 01:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
entered into their they have a purpose
 
01:01:17.349 --> 01:01:17.359 align:start position:0%
or judgments settlements or judgments
 
01:01:19.589 --> 01:01:19.599 align:start position:0%
and they have a purpose
 
01:01:22.150 --> 01:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
either because of that particular
 
01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
settlement or judgment or because the
 
01:01:25.829 --> 01:01:25.839 align:start position:0%
legislature has assigned a purpose to it
 
01:01:28.950 --> 01:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
i think the mtp mtbe money is probably
 
01:01:32.309 --> 01:01:32.319 align:start position:0%
um the most notable where there was the
 
01:01:32.319 --> 01:01:32.789 align:start position:0%
um the most notable where there was the
two

01:01:32.789 --> 01:01:32.799 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:01:34.470 --> 01:01:34.480 align:start position:0%
almost 300 million dollars that came to
 
01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
the state that was put into a dedicated
 
01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:37.270 align:start position:0%
the state that was put into a dedicated
fund

01:01:37.270 --> 01:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:01:39.430 --> 01:01:39.440 align:start position:0%
and is is used to help with um clean
 
01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
water and drinking water issues
 
01:01:44.789 --> 01:01:44.799 align:start position:0%
um and there's a and that oversees that
 
01:01:47.109 --> 01:01:47.119 align:start position:0%
so so it depends on what the legislature
 
01:01:48.309 --> 01:01:48.319 align:start position:0%
if they're aware of money coming into
 
01:01:49.589 --> 01:01:49.599 align:start position:0%
the state and if they do something that
 
01:01:51.109 --> 01:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
directs it or if the courts have already
 
01:01:53.670 --> 01:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
directed a use it may be restricted
 
01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
are we am i aware of any large
 
01:01:57.109 --> 01:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
settlement dollars coming down the pike
 
01:01:58.390 --> 01:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
i am not
 
01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
um you may recall a few months back that
 
01:02:05.190 --> 01:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
securities um you're at a settlement of
 
01:02:06.789 --> 01:02:06.799 align:start position:0%
two million dollars
 
01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
so that sits in there um basically sits
 
01:02:10.950 --> 01:02:10.960 align:start position:0%
in their bank account until the end of
 
01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
this year
 
01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
and it would be deposited into the
 
01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
general fund at that point
 
01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
um based on um whatever
 
01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:26.069 --> 01:02:26.079 align:start position:0%
the other thing to know about um
 
01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
judgments and settlements that come into
 
01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:33.190 --> 01:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
if it's in excess of a million dollars
 
01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
ten percent of that goes to the rainy
 
01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
day fund
 
01:02:37.750 --> 01:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
and then the rest can go to the general
 
01:02:39.510 --> 01:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
fund or whatever other purpose it might
 
01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:40.630 align:start position:0%
fund or whatever other purpose it might
have

01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:40.640 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
um so there was a way that the
 
01:02:43.990 --> 01:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
legislature thought it to kind of
 
01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:45.280 align:start position:0%
put a little bit of money towards the
 
01:02:47.190 --> 01:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
rating a fund
 
01:02:49.670 --> 01:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
but it's it's hard to guess or estimate
 
01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
when a a court settlement will be
 
01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:53.670 align:start position:0%
when a a court settlement will be
completed

01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
completed
 
01:02:56.390 --> 01:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
typically we learn about it the same as
 
01:02:57.829 --> 01:02:57.839 align:start position:0%
everybody else and when there's a press
 
01:02:57.839 --> 01:02:58.390 align:start position:0%
everybody else and when there's a press
release

01:02:58.390 --> 01:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
release
 
01:03:01.349 --> 01:03:01.359 align:start position:0%
and and um the state's being told that
 
01:03:03.829 --> 01:03:03.839 align:start position:0%
they they have money to use
 
01:03:06.230 --> 01:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
another dedicated was the volkswagen
 
01:03:07.270 --> 01:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
settlement you know that
 
01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
that money is very specifically used for
 
01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
um area shoes on vehicles and so there's
 
01:03:16.470 --> 01:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
limits on how that money can be spent so
 
01:03:17.430 --> 01:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
it's not it didn't
 
01:03:20.549 --> 01:03:20.559 align:start position:0%
it never touched the general fund it's
 
01:03:25.750 --> 01:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:29.430 --> 01:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
can you put up this sheet on others
 
01:03:33.349 --> 01:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
which shows the uh like the four or five
 
01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:10.870 --> 01:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
there we go that's the page you're
 
01:04:15.990 --> 01:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:18.549 --> 01:04:18.559 align:start position:0%
so that this row here the miscellaneous
 
01:04:21.349 --> 01:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
other revenue that would be
 
01:04:24.470 --> 01:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
um all the other little funds
 
01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:26.640 align:start position:0%
that they talked about and then here are
 
01:04:27.829 --> 01:04:27.839 align:start position:0%
some of your larger the
 
01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
indirect costs are funds that
 
01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
um basically on federal dollars
 
01:04:39.670 --> 01:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
and it's to cover um like
 
01:04:42.390 --> 01:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
those things in in your agency that are
 
01:04:43.990 --> 01:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
are centralized
 
01:04:45.910 --> 01:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
so that you know the accounting staff
 
01:04:47.430 --> 01:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
the human resources staff
 
01:04:49.349 --> 01:04:49.359 align:start position:0%
that maybe the commissioner so those
 
01:04:50.950 --> 01:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
indirect costs help cover that but it
 
01:04:53.349 --> 01:04:53.359 align:start position:0%
comes in as revenue
 
01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
to the state the same with the
 
01:04:57.349 --> 01:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
post-retirement benefits
 
01:04:59.029 --> 01:04:59.039 align:start position:0%
that's federal usually federal dollars
 
01:05:01.349 --> 01:05:01.359 align:start position:0%
grants that come in to cover
 
01:05:03.109 --> 01:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
retirement costs associated with
 
01:05:04.710 --> 01:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
individuals that are working on federal
 
01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:06.390 align:start position:0%
individuals that are working on federal
programs

01:05:06.390 --> 01:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
abandoned property you heard a lot about
 
01:05:10.470 --> 01:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
um the treasurer
 
01:05:13.670 --> 01:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
deals with that and um in june basically
 
01:05:14.789 --> 01:05:14.799 align:start position:0%
they transfer
 
01:05:16.549 --> 01:05:16.559 align:start position:0%
an amount to the general fund and
 
01:05:18.230 --> 01:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
they've made estimates
 
01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh but the exact dollar won't be known
 
01:05:21.910 --> 01:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
because they're in the process of
 
01:05:24.390 --> 01:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
liquidating um
 
01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:26.710 align:start position:0%
liquidating um
[Music]

01:05:26.710 --> 01:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:28.640 align:start position:0%
bonds and stocks that they might have at
 
01:05:31.270 --> 01:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:33.039 align:start position:0%
and then as i mentioned the interest in
 
01:05:34.470 --> 01:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
surplus funds
 
01:05:36.870 --> 01:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
you can see there was a couple of years
 
01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
in 1819
 
01:05:42.390 --> 01:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
and then 20 where we had um a
 
01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
good uptick in in the in the dollars
 
01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
that we got in interest
 
01:05:47.829 --> 01:05:47.839 align:start position:0%
and then in 21 it goes right down to
 
01:05:50.470 --> 01:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
zero let's go back to 16 it was less
 
01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
than a thousand dollars and prior to
 
01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:52.470 align:start position:0%
than a thousand dollars and prior to
that

01:05:52.470 --> 01:05:52.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:05:54.069 --> 01:05:54.079 align:start position:0%
it would have been in the few hundred
 
01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
dollar range so it typically wasn't
 
01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:57.029 align:start position:0%
dollar range so it typically wasn't
included

01:05:57.029 --> 01:05:57.039 align:start position:0%
included
 
01:05:59.510 --> 01:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
um in 19 when the budget was being
 
01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:00.710 align:start position:0%
um in 19 when the budget was being
prepared

01:06:00.710 --> 01:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
prepared
 
01:06:03.029 --> 01:06:03.039 align:start position:0%
uh there was a strong feeling that you
 
01:06:04.470 --> 01:06:04.480 align:start position:0%
know we're getting some significant
 
01:06:05.990 --> 01:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
dollars you should probably put that as
 
01:06:06.549 --> 01:06:06.559 align:start position:0%
part of your
 
01:06:09.430 --> 01:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
other estimate but things have changed
 
01:06:11.990 --> 01:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
going forward so they've removed that
 
01:06:13.190 --> 01:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
and then here with the office of
 
01:06:16.069 --> 01:06:16.079 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and certification
 
01:06:18.309 --> 01:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
that used to be uh money that went to
 
01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
the general fund when they consulted all
 
01:06:20.319 --> 01:06:20.630 align:start position:0%
the general fund when they consulted all
those

01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:06:24.309 --> 01:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
uh boards um back in
 
01:06:27.270 --> 01:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
i think it was 2015 as the language was
 
01:06:27.829 --> 01:06:27.839 align:start position:0%
in that bit
 
01:06:31.349 --> 01:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
in the house bill 2. um
 
01:06:34.309 --> 01:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
then a couple years later the fund was
 
01:06:34.319 --> 01:06:35.349 align:start position:0%
then a couple years later the fund was
restricted

01:06:35.349 --> 01:06:35.359 align:start position:0%
restricted
 
01:06:36.950 --> 01:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
and it no longer went directly to the
 
01:06:38.710 --> 01:06:38.720 align:start position:0%
general fund though there is
 
01:06:41.829 --> 01:06:41.839 align:start position:0%
language um
 
01:06:43.510 --> 01:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
there is language that says at the end
 
01:06:45.190 --> 01:06:45.200 align:start position:0%
of the fiscal year
 
01:06:48.230 --> 01:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
they deposit whatever's left in the fund
 
01:06:49.670 --> 01:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
into the general fund
 
01:06:52.710 --> 01:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
but up until that point the um
 
01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
that the money is used to pay for the
 
01:06:55.829 --> 01:06:55.839 align:start position:0%
boards and the and the
 
01:06:58.870 --> 01:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
operations of the oplc
 
01:07:00.309 --> 01:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
so those are those are some of your
 
01:07:02.309 --> 01:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
bigger accounts
 
01:07:02.319 --> 01:07:06.390 align:start position:0%
bigger accounts
um

01:07:06.390 --> 01:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:11.029 --> 01:07:11.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
these top 12 15
 
01:07:16.069 --> 01:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
these are the ones that um the
 
01:07:17.670 --> 01:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
comptroller discussed that
 
01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
they they keep an eye on those because
 
01:07:22.630 --> 01:07:22.640 align:start position:0%
those are typically some of your larger
 
01:07:24.069 --> 01:07:24.079 align:start position:0%
historically have been some of your
 
01:07:24.079 --> 01:07:26.470 align:start position:0%
historically have been some of your
larger

01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
larger
 
01:07:28.150 --> 01:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
other revenues so that kind of gives
 
01:07:29.430 --> 01:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
them a sense of how things would be
 
01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:30.390 align:start position:0%
them a sense of how things would be
going

01:07:30.390 --> 01:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
going
 
01:07:33.670 --> 01:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
um but as
 
01:07:35.349 --> 01:07:35.359 align:start position:0%
pointed out during the presentation
 
01:07:37.109 --> 01:07:37.119 align:start position:0%
there are some that seem to be changing
 
01:07:38.710 --> 01:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
like the aircraft fee has gone down
 
01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:39.670 align:start position:0%
like the aircraft fee has gone down
significantly

01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
significantly
 
01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
that was it was the result of statutory
 
01:07:43.829 --> 01:07:43.839 align:start position:0%
change that occurred
 
01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
um it actually restricted the some of
 
01:07:48.309 --> 01:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
the money that used to come to the
 
01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
general fund labor
 
01:07:54.630 --> 01:07:54.640 align:start position:0%
is an interesting um it shows 980 but
 
01:07:56.069 --> 01:07:56.079 align:start position:0%
basically they're a transfer at the end
 
01:07:57.829 --> 01:07:57.839 align:start position:0%
of the year as well
 
01:08:01.829 --> 01:08:01.839 align:start position:0%
so years ago uh
 
01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
probably four budgets ago maybe
 
01:08:07.109 --> 01:08:07.119 align:start position:0%
department of labor was all generally
 
01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
funded any fees fines they collected
 
01:08:10.309 --> 01:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
went to the general fund and then there
 
01:08:12.309 --> 01:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
was a change to dedicate all their
 
01:08:13.829 --> 01:08:13.839 align:start position:0%
revenues that they collected through
 
01:08:15.990 --> 01:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
fines and fees and those were used to
 
01:08:17.910 --> 01:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
pay for the agency with again at the end
 
01:08:19.269 --> 01:08:19.279 align:start position:0%
of the fiscal year
 
01:08:22.070 --> 01:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
um any bounce in in the administrative
 
01:08:27.990 --> 01:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:31.829 --> 01:08:31.839 align:start position:0%
so i don't know what else i can share
 
01:08:33.269 --> 01:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
with you
 
01:08:36.390 --> 01:08:36.400 align:start position:0%
or if there's any specific questions the
 
01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:36.789 align:start position:0%
or if there's any specific questions the
only

01:08:36.789 --> 01:08:36.799 align:start position:0%
only
 
01:08:39.349 --> 01:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
question i would have is there any of
 
01:08:40.390 --> 01:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
those that
 
01:08:44.630 --> 01:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
would be tied to the pandemic
 
01:08:49.669 --> 01:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
or or those or any of the ones that
 
01:08:53.590 --> 01:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
are trivial right now that could really
 
01:08:57.910 --> 01:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:00.950 align:start position:0%
 
otherwise

01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:04.229 --> 01:09:04.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:07.269 --> 01:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
i i don't know and and i don't know if
 
01:09:07.279 --> 01:09:08.789 align:start position:0%
i i don't know and and i don't know if
um

01:09:08.789 --> 01:09:08.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
the controller necessarily knows i can
 
01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
check with her though
 
01:09:15.910 --> 01:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
okay it may require her or her staff to
 
01:09:18.149 --> 01:09:18.159 align:start position:0%
reach out to the agencies that are
 
01:09:19.910 --> 01:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
excuse me that are providing the
 
01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:21.829 align:start position:0%
excuse me that are providing the
revenues

01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
again because it comes from a multitude
 
01:09:25.349 --> 01:09:25.359 align:start position:0%
of the agencies i just don't know what
 
01:09:27.189 --> 01:09:27.199 align:start position:0%
the impact is
 
01:09:30.070 --> 01:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
um we probably wouldn't find out what
 
01:09:31.269 --> 01:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
the impact was
 
01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
probably until march and april
 
01:09:36.309 --> 01:09:36.319 align:start position:0%
possibly not i mean and some of these
 
01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
because they're their
 
01:09:40.709 --> 01:09:40.719 align:start position:0%
fees it may also have to do with a cycle
 
01:09:43.749 --> 01:09:43.759 align:start position:0%
of when they collect the fees
 
01:09:45.990 --> 01:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
and and i i'm unfortunately i don't have
 
01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
all that information you know is it a
 
01:09:50.550 --> 01:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
once a year type of thing is it every
 
01:09:52.229 --> 01:09:52.239 align:start position:0%
two years
 
01:09:53.910 --> 01:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
is it twice a year i just don't know on
 
01:09:57.590 --> 01:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
is it throughout the year but um
 
01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
so that's all i have on the other and
 
01:10:03.910 --> 01:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
represent major i see you've got a
 
01:10:06.149 --> 01:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
number of hands up so i'll be quiet
 
01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you mr chairman i'd just like
 
01:10:13.270 --> 01:10:13.280 align:start position:0%
to point out since we're on this page
 
01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
on the initial plate and vanity
 
01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
fund and vanity plate which is four down
 
01:10:24.229 --> 01:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
on crashed for the pandemic they
 
01:10:28.229 --> 01:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
it certainly will be coming back up
 
01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
and restaurant fees down about six below
 
01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:32.310 align:start position:0%
and restaurant fees down about six below
it

01:10:32.310 --> 01:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:10:35.590 --> 01:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
crashed because of the pandemic
 
01:10:39.430 --> 01:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
but there are on
 
01:10:42.550 --> 01:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
that's uh health and human service fees
 
01:10:45.669 --> 01:10:45.679 align:start position:0%
from the restaurants but there are other
 
01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
things that
 
01:10:49.830 --> 01:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
that may have gone in the other
 
01:10:52.709 --> 01:10:52.719 align:start position:0%
direction because we know that that
 
01:10:54.870 --> 01:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
certain economic activity is
 
01:10:58.190 --> 01:10:58.200 align:start position:0%
has been booming in the pandemic and
 
01:10:58.200 --> 01:10:59.830 align:start position:0%
has been booming in the pandemic and
[Music]

01:10:59.830 --> 01:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:11:01.830 --> 01:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
and you can't look at the history of
 
01:11:03.189 --> 01:11:03.199 align:start position:0%
this fund because they
 
01:11:04.870 --> 01:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
keep on putting things into it and
 
01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
taking them out again
 
01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
over in finance and so
 
01:11:12.870 --> 01:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
current law just reflects what they've
 
01:11:14.709 --> 01:11:14.719 align:start position:0%
been doing recently
 
01:11:18.550 --> 01:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
i don't see how we can second guess
 
01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
their estimates on this even though i'm
 
01:11:23.350 --> 01:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
not i don't think their estimates
 
01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
are or can be very good unless they're
 
01:11:27.669 --> 01:11:27.679 align:start position:0%
going to spend all of their time
 
01:11:30.790 --> 01:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
going after all of the agencies
 
01:11:34.229 --> 01:11:34.239 align:start position:0%
so i've tried occasionally to talk to
 
01:11:34.239 --> 01:11:36.390 align:start position:0%
so i've tried occasionally to talk to
them

01:11:36.390 --> 01:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:11:38.950 --> 01:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
you said the initial plates crashed i
 
01:11:39.990 --> 01:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
don't i don't see
 
01:11:44.229 --> 01:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
that because the uh the actual for 2020
 
01:11:44.239 --> 01:11:45.070 align:start position:0%
that because the uh the actual for 2020
was

01:11:45.070 --> 01:11:45.080 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:11:52.830 --> 01:11:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:59.110 align:start position:0%
 
21.

01:11:59.110 --> 01:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:00.790 --> 01:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
so you're looking at the uh through
 
01:12:02.229 --> 01:12:02.239 align:start position:0%
december numbers
 
01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
is why it went down right but
 
01:12:12.070 --> 01:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:15.189 --> 01:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
that's still a problem of of when
 
01:12:19.750 --> 01:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
the money comes in oops we just lost
 
01:12:23.510 --> 01:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
but on and this is the problem they
 
01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
um they have not had anything in sale of
 
01:12:28.630 --> 01:12:28.640 align:start position:0%
real property for some years now because
 
01:12:29.189 --> 01:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
they kept
 
01:12:32.790 --> 01:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
putting in selling laconia and it didn't
 
01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:33.189 align:start position:0%
putting in selling laconia and it didn't
sell

01:12:33.189 --> 01:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
sell
 
01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
so that's just going to show up when it
 
01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:41.189 --> 01:12:41.199 align:start position:0%
i know it's been it's really been
 
01:12:41.199 --> 01:12:41.910 align:start position:0%
i know it's been it's really been
decades

01:12:41.910 --> 01:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
decades
 
01:12:44.950 --> 01:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
time to sell that uh representative
 
01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:46.390 align:start position:0%
time to sell that uh representative
browning

01:12:46.390 --> 01:12:46.400 align:start position:0%
browning
 
01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
yeah it just goes but i had my hand up
 
01:12:49.189 --> 01:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
for a while so this goes back to the
 
01:12:50.149 --> 01:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
conversation about
 
01:12:53.430 --> 01:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
outstanding um settlements the only one
 
01:12:55.590 --> 01:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
i can think of is the pfas
 
01:12:59.189 --> 01:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
is out there i think 3m is being sued
 
01:13:00.870 --> 01:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
and i think we're on we're we're
 
01:13:02.709 --> 01:13:02.719 align:start position:0%
involved in that as a state
 
01:13:04.470 --> 01:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
and that those things take four or five
 
01:13:05.910 --> 01:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
years so
 
01:13:08.950 --> 01:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
i i don't think um i don't think
 
01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
it's going to come in in this period of
 
01:13:13.669 --> 01:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
time that we're talking about here
 
01:13:15.189 --> 01:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
but it's the foam you know the fire
 
01:13:17.110 --> 01:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
retardant foam that was used and
 
01:13:18.950 --> 01:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
manufactured by 3m i think i think it
 
01:13:20.310 --> 01:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
was 3m
 
01:13:23.189 --> 01:13:23.199 align:start position:0%
uh that's that's the big one that i my
 
01:13:24.390 --> 01:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
memory tells me is out
 
01:13:26.950 --> 01:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
still out there unsettled chris you have
 
01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:27.510 align:start position:0%
still out there unsettled chris you have
something

01:13:27.510 --> 01:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:13:30.950 --> 01:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to suggest too that i
 
01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:32.070 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to suggest too that i
believe

01:13:32.070 --> 01:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
believe
 
01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
you were all provided the kafir a hard
 
01:13:35.510 --> 01:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
copy of it
 
01:13:37.750 --> 01:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
or you can look at electronically but in
 
01:13:38.709 --> 01:13:38.719 align:start position:0%
there there is
 
01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
um um legal actions that are
 
01:13:44.070 --> 01:13:44.080 align:start position:0%
taking place and some of these will be
 
01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:45.110 align:start position:0%
taking place and some of these will be
mentioned

01:13:45.110 --> 01:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
01:13:46.229 --> 01:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
that you know you've mentioned or
 
01:13:48.950 --> 01:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
represent others and
 
01:13:51.030 --> 01:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
it might give you it doesn't usually say
 
01:13:52.229 --> 01:13:52.239 align:start position:0%
you know on such a date we're going to
 
01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
have a settlement but it might give you
 
01:13:54.390 --> 01:13:54.400 align:start position:0%
an indication of
 
01:13:55.990 --> 01:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
maybe how far along they are in a
 
01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.910 align:start position:0%
maybe how far along they are in a
process

01:13:57.910 --> 01:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:14:00.790 --> 01:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
and what they they're asked to
 
01:14:02.790 --> 01:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
anticipate what the the
 
01:14:05.110 --> 01:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
value of that might be either positive
 
01:14:06.470 --> 01:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
or negative so if there's a suit against
 
01:14:07.270 --> 01:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:14:08.790 --> 01:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
you know what's the potential liability
 
01:14:10.709 --> 01:14:10.719 align:start position:0%
and if there's a suit for the state
 
01:14:11.350 --> 01:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
what's the
 
01:14:14.790 --> 01:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
potential gain you know often they can't
 
01:14:15.669 --> 01:14:15.679 align:start position:0%
say that
 
01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
for a number of different reasons but at
 
01:14:19.590 --> 01:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
least you can see what types of um
 
01:14:21.270 --> 01:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
court cases might be out there that
 
01:14:23.189 --> 01:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
could have an impact on revenue
 
01:14:26.149 --> 01:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
in the upcoming years but you can't ever
 
01:14:27.990 --> 01:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
say for certainty when when
 
01:14:36.870 --> 01:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
01:14:42.709 --> 01:14:42.719 align:start position:0%
i was actually when i suggested other i
 
01:14:45.030 --> 01:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
was thinking railroad timber and
 
01:14:48.070 --> 01:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
excavation which are three pages in
 
01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
the dra packet so where do those come in
 
01:14:54.229 --> 01:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
i can't seem to find it anywhere
 
01:14:57.590 --> 01:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh you you won't because uh those
 
01:15:01.189 --> 01:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
are um i think
 
01:15:02.950 --> 01:15:02.960 align:start position:0%
i think those are all dedicated to a
 
01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:05.030 align:start position:0%
i think those are all dedicated to a
purpose

01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
01:15:06.790 --> 01:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
i think that they use the funds uh the
 
01:15:08.390 --> 01:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
timber funds are go back to the
 
01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:09.669 align:start position:0%
timber funds are go back to the
communities

01:15:09.669 --> 01:15:09.679 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:15:11.669 --> 01:15:11.679 align:start position:0%
on the railroad fund there is direction
 
01:15:15.350 --> 01:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
of where that goes in the statute
 
01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
there may be small pieces that come and
 
01:15:18.950 --> 01:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
some of it funds the activity within the
 
01:15:20.550 --> 01:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
department but then
 
01:15:22.229 --> 01:15:22.239 align:start position:0%
it gets split up into different ways i'd
 
01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
have to look at the statutes exactly but
 
01:15:27.189 --> 01:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:29.669 --> 01:15:29.679 align:start position:0%
in the dra's bigger revenue numbers if
 
01:15:29.679 --> 01:15:30.550 align:start position:0%
in the dra's bigger revenue numbers if
anything

01:15:30.550 --> 01:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:15:32.630 --> 01:15:32.640 align:start position:0%
you might find it in the other revenue
 
01:15:35.350 --> 01:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
and i'd have to do a search for that
 
01:15:41.510 --> 01:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
right railroad tax goes back to some
 
01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:46.719 align:start position:0%
certain purposes as it relates to some
 
01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
of the lines
 
01:15:50.070 --> 01:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
around the state but i think a piece of
 
01:15:51.990 --> 01:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
that might go into a different fund as
 
01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
well and i would just have to confirm
 
01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:55.030 align:start position:0%
well and i would just have to confirm
that

01:15:55.030 --> 01:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:15:58.149 --> 01:15:58.159 align:start position:0%
thank you representative ah thank you
 
01:16:00.229 --> 01:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
i'd like to go back um to what the
 
01:16:02.229 --> 01:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
chairman said at the very beginning
 
01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
um a lot of these are smaller revenues
 
01:16:05.350 --> 01:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
and they are going to go
 
01:16:08.149 --> 01:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
up and down and i think that may balance
 
01:16:08.159 --> 01:16:08.550 align:start position:0%
up and down and i think that may balance
out

01:16:08.550 --> 01:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:16:11.510 --> 01:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
but i don't think it will be way off so
 
01:16:13.189 --> 01:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
when we look at the total
 
01:16:15.189 --> 01:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
i think it's you know really the best
 
01:16:17.189 --> 01:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
estimate they have right now
 
01:16:19.270 --> 01:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if emotions in order
 
01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
but i would support accepting their
 
01:16:22.310 --> 01:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
total estimate
 
01:16:24.709 --> 01:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
realizing that a lot of the smaller ones
 
01:16:27.590 --> 01:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
are going to go up and down
 
01:16:30.709 --> 01:16:30.719 align:start position:0%
do we have a second on that
 
01:16:34.669 --> 01:16:34.679 align:start position:0%
i'll second it okay uh
 
01:16:43.189 --> 01:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:46.830 --> 01:16:46.840 align:start position:0%
i don't see any hands raised
 
01:16:53.669 --> 01:16:53.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:57.669 --> 01:16:57.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:01.830 --> 01:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
for the court finds normal court
 
01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
just trying to pick off the little ones
 
01:17:05.510 --> 01:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
here yep
 
01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
put lines first column i
 
01:17:18.709 --> 01:17:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:22.470 --> 01:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
and that's been pretty consistent
 
01:17:28.830 --> 01:17:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:30.630 align:start position:0%
 
things

01:17:30.630 --> 01:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:17:33.990 --> 01:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
a variety of courts
 
01:17:37.590 --> 01:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
anything to add to that chris
 
01:17:39.430 --> 01:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
nope i i think that donna did a pretty
 
01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
good job with you the other day
 
01:17:44.229 --> 01:17:44.239 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
01:17:48.070 --> 01:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
she she continually analyzes the revenue
 
01:17:49.110 --> 01:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
that they're collecting within the
 
01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:50.149 align:start position:0%
that they're collecting within the
courts

01:17:50.149 --> 01:17:50.159 align:start position:0%
courts
 
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
and tries to make her best guesses you
 
01:17:53.830 --> 01:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
know going forward and
 
01:17:56.790 --> 01:17:56.800 align:start position:0%
brings in a lot of um information to do
 
01:17:57.590 --> 01:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
that for you
 
01:17:59.030 --> 01:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
and that's why she provides the detail
 
01:18:01.270 --> 01:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
that she does i can pull up her
 
01:18:02.790 --> 01:18:02.800 align:start position:0%
presentation if that's helpful for the
 
01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:03.750 align:start position:0%
presentation if that's helpful for the
committee

01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:18:12.990 --> 01:18:13.000 align:start position:0%
why don't you
 
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:24.830 align:start position:0%
why don't you
[Music]

01:18:24.830 --> 01:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:46.390 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:18:46.390 --> 01:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:48.550 --> 01:18:48.560 align:start position:0%
so this is uh page 12 of their
 
01:18:50.229 --> 01:18:50.239 align:start position:0%
presentation is the historical so it
 
01:18:51.270 --> 01:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
gives you
 
01:18:55.510 --> 01:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
16 through 20.
 
01:18:57.110 --> 01:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
and how they're doing they were doing
 
01:19:00.950 --> 01:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
with their different revenue sources
 
01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
and then on page 13
 
01:19:08.229 --> 01:19:08.239 align:start position:0%
is 20 21 22 and 23
 
01:19:11.030 --> 01:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
and when you're looking at um judicial
 
01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:11.910 align:start position:0%
and when you're looking at um judicial
branch

01:19:11.910 --> 01:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
branch
 
01:19:14.310 --> 01:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
you're considering for the courts and
 
01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:15.510 align:start position:0%
you're considering for the courts and
fines

01:19:15.510 --> 01:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
fines
 
01:19:18.550 --> 01:19:18.560 align:start position:0%
this line right here that
 
01:19:20.630 --> 01:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
that that's the line that you're
 
01:19:21.990 --> 01:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
estimating at this moment
 
01:19:24.870 --> 01:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
so it's rolls everything up above that
 
01:19:27.189 --> 01:19:27.199 align:start position:0%
rolls into that number
 
01:19:29.110 --> 01:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
i i think we can do that the penalty
 
01:19:31.189 --> 01:19:31.199 align:start position:0%
assessment is actually in other
 
01:19:33.110 --> 01:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
is one of the other revenues it goes
 
01:19:39.669 --> 01:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes you have to keep big picture
 
01:19:43.110 --> 01:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
involved here this is such a small
 
01:19:44.390 --> 01:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
revenue stream
 
01:19:46.790 --> 01:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
that even if we're off by ten percent
 
01:19:48.149 --> 01:19:48.159 align:start position:0%
it's not significant
 
01:19:49.750 --> 01:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
if this was a business tax and we're off
 
01:19:52.470 --> 01:19:52.480 align:start position:0%
by 10 that's another story
 
01:19:59.750 --> 01:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:03.110 align:start position:0%
 
patton

01:20:03.110 --> 01:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:06.070 --> 01:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
feel we should peterson the court
 
01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:08.149 align:start position:0%
feel we should peterson the court
numbers

01:20:08.149 --> 01:20:08.159 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:25.830 --> 01:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
it never changes the beer tax you're
 
01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:26.470 align:start position:0%
it never changes the beer tax you're
right

01:20:26.470 --> 01:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:20:31.110 --> 01:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
okay that's amazing
 
01:20:33.669 --> 01:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
for the newbies you know how much tax we
 
01:20:33.679 --> 01:20:35.270 align:start position:0%
for the newbies you know how much tax we
collect

01:20:35.270 --> 01:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
collect
 
01:20:39.830 --> 01:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:41.750 --> 01:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
it's been the same for years and years
 
01:20:46.390 --> 01:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
and years
 
01:20:52.229 --> 01:20:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:56.470 --> 01:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
isn't it 30 cents 30 cents a gallon
 
01:20:58.070 --> 01:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
mr chairman that's what i was going to
 
01:21:01.510 --> 01:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
say it was about 30 cents a gallon
 
01:21:05.669 --> 01:21:05.679 align:start position:0%
decades ago it's still 30 cents a gallon
 
01:21:07.270 --> 01:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to point out people have
 
01:21:09.350 --> 01:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
tried to get us to put it up
 
01:21:12.070 --> 01:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
it would produce very little money and
 
01:21:13.030 --> 01:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
we would be
 
01:21:16.310 --> 01:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
above the states around us
 
01:21:20.629 --> 01:21:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:24.870 --> 01:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:27.669 --> 01:21:27.679 align:start position:0%
to take the agency's numbers but don't
 
01:21:28.149 --> 01:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
let me
 
01:21:30.870 --> 01:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
make that decision the amazing thing is
 
01:21:31.590 --> 01:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
that it's
 
01:21:34.149 --> 01:21:34.159 align:start position:0%
a matter of recession not recession
 
01:21:35.110 --> 01:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
highs lows
 
01:21:37.990 --> 01:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
the world blowing up it seems to be the
 
01:21:39.669 --> 01:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
same amount
 
01:21:43.350 --> 01:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
year after it did it did grow
 
01:21:46.470 --> 01:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
from 10 million i think uh or maybe it
 
01:21:48.149 --> 01:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
was 12 million one
 
01:21:51.510 --> 01:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
one million months uh when we were
 
01:21:55.189 --> 01:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
first looking at this thing
 
01:21:56.950 --> 01:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
i think that's the craft beer that's
 
01:21:59.590 --> 01:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:02.310 --> 01:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
i think we should accept it but what
 
01:22:03.430 --> 01:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
we're saying is we can
 
01:22:08.629 --> 01:22:08.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:11.669 --> 01:22:11.679 align:start position:0%
okay representative tucker says uh we
 
01:22:12.550 --> 01:22:12.560 align:start position:0%
should accept
 
01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
these numbers who agrees
 
01:22:20.629 --> 01:22:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:27.430 --> 01:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:32.709 --> 01:22:32.719 align:start position:0%
another candidate medicaid recoveries
 
01:22:35.830 --> 01:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
it's practically nothing on
 
01:22:40.310 --> 01:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:43.270 --> 01:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
okay medicaid recovery is on page six is
 
01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:44.070 align:start position:0%
okay medicaid recovery is on page six is
called

01:22:44.070 --> 01:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
called
 
01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:47.669 align:start position:0%
called
cue

01:22:47.669 --> 01:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:51.030 --> 01:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
a good presentation on that from
 
01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:57.030 align:start position:0%
a good presentation on that from
hhs

01:22:57.030 --> 01:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:59.669 --> 01:22:59.679 align:start position:0%
did you just want to put the sheet up
 
01:22:59.679 --> 01:23:01.030 align:start position:0%
did you just want to put the sheet up
first

01:23:01.030 --> 01:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:23:18.830 --> 01:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:33.990 align:start position:0%
 
oh

01:23:33.990 --> 01:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:36.550 --> 01:23:36.560 align:start position:0%
so that's what they gave us was the the
 
01:23:37.430 --> 01:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
line graphs
 
01:23:46.390 --> 01:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:49.590 --> 01:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
and just as a reminder you know that
 
01:23:51.910 --> 01:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
there were some higher collections back
 
01:23:53.910 --> 01:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
in the earlier years
 
01:23:56.950 --> 01:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
um with the um recovery income
 
01:23:58.709 --> 01:23:58.719 align:start position:0%
and that's because there was a backlog
 
01:24:00.550 --> 01:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
that was part of the issue there that
 
01:24:03.189 --> 01:24:03.199 align:start position:0%
at a backlog that was ongoing and they
 
01:24:04.550 --> 01:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
had hired some um
 
01:24:07.590 --> 01:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
firms to help them address that
 
01:24:10.550 --> 01:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
as meredith telus had also indicated
 
01:24:12.229 --> 01:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
with the managed care contracts they've
 
01:24:14.070 --> 01:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
negotiated that
 
01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
function as part of that service so that
 
01:24:18.310 --> 01:24:18.320 align:start position:0%
they're now taking that responsibility
 
01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:19.110 align:start position:0%
they're now taking that responsibility
on

01:24:19.110 --> 01:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:24:23.189 --> 01:24:23.199 align:start position:0%
and and the effort really is to um
 
01:24:25.110 --> 01:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
try to stop a service from being paid
 
01:24:26.470 --> 01:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
for before you actually
 
01:24:28.550 --> 01:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
pay for something that wasn't um allowed
 
01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:29.510 align:start position:0%
pay for something that wasn't um allowed
for

01:24:29.510 --> 01:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:24:30.790 --> 01:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
so that's what they're trying to do
 
01:24:32.629 --> 01:24:32.639 align:start position:0%
going forward is to say not that it's
 
01:24:35.189 --> 01:24:35.199 align:start position:0%
not covered this is what is covered
 
01:24:35.199 --> 01:24:40.550 align:start position:0%
not covered this is what is covered
um

01:24:40.550 --> 01:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:51.669 --> 01:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:54.229 --> 01:24:54.239 align:start position:0%
so are we all set medicaid recovery is
 
01:24:56.149 --> 01:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
anybody not
 
01:25:02.870 --> 01:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:06.310 --> 01:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:09.990 --> 01:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
okay but uh norm how about utility
 
01:25:11.590 --> 01:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
property text now tax
 
01:25:14.629 --> 01:25:14.639 align:start position:0%
utility property tax next after week
 
01:25:16.950 --> 01:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
on medicaid recoveries we're all set on
 
01:25:18.870 --> 01:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
that i didn't see anybody
 
01:25:22.390 --> 01:25:22.400 align:start position:0%
not so okay
 
01:25:24.830 --> 01:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
and the utility property tax is the next
 
01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:26.149 align:start position:0%
and the utility property tax is the next
candidate

01:25:26.149 --> 01:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
candidate
 
01:25:28.070 --> 01:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
can i just say something about that norm
 
01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:29.590 align:start position:0%
can i just say something about that norm
yes

01:25:29.590 --> 01:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:25:32.390 --> 01:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
again that's that's taxes but the state
 
01:25:34.070 --> 01:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
not by municipalities make sure there's
 
01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:34.470 align:start position:0%
not by municipalities make sure there's
no

01:25:34.470 --> 01:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:25:37.750 --> 01:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
confusion on utilities
 
01:25:41.350 --> 01:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
that would be the long lines and the
 
01:25:44.550 --> 01:25:44.560 align:start position:0%
utility plant plants that around the
 
01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:45.110 align:start position:0%
utility plant plants that around the
state

01:25:45.110 --> 01:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:25:48.070 --> 01:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
and we don't have much change in that
 
01:25:48.950 --> 01:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
there aren't
 
01:25:52.470 --> 01:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
other than upgrades in a plant or if a
 
01:25:55.350 --> 01:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
major plant goes offline
 
01:25:58.629 --> 01:25:58.639 align:start position:0%
basically this is the this is the
 
01:26:01.510 --> 01:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
the tax that is fairly consistent year
 
01:26:03.110 --> 01:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
after year
 
01:26:04.709 --> 01:26:04.719 align:start position:0%
again unless we built another seabrook
 
01:26:06.870 --> 01:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
or built another plant
 
01:26:09.430 --> 01:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
you know we wouldn't see uh any major
 
01:26:11.350 --> 01:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
change in this
 
01:26:15.270 --> 01:26:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:18.629 --> 01:26:18.639 align:start position:0%
my statute is a rate of six dollars and
 
01:26:19.910 --> 01:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
sixty cents a thousand
 
01:26:25.270 --> 01:26:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:27.830 --> 01:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
and it stays that way and it's assessed
 
01:26:30.470 --> 01:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
by the dra
 
01:26:34.070 --> 01:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
and as pat says we don't see big change
 
01:26:36.310 --> 01:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
on this unless a retiree
 
01:26:39.910 --> 01:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
a power facility
 
01:26:41.830 --> 01:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
but usually there's a one that comes
 
01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:43.189 align:start position:0%
but usually there's a one that comes
online

01:26:43.189 --> 01:26:43.199 align:start position:0%
online
 
01:26:59.669 --> 01:26:59.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:02.790 --> 01:27:02.800 align:start position:0%
thank you this this tax
 
01:27:06.070 --> 01:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
is a uh calculated as an income
 
01:27:09.430 --> 01:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
and expense tax so when the cost
 
01:27:12.310 --> 01:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
of energy goes up the value of the
 
01:27:15.910 --> 01:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
plants goes up on the market basis
 
01:27:20.310 --> 01:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
and they end up on paying more
 
01:27:23.430 --> 01:27:23.440 align:start position:0%
when on the other
 
01:27:26.629 --> 01:27:26.639 align:start position:0%
thing about it is our energy policy
 
01:27:31.270 --> 01:27:31.280 align:start position:0%
and the the um citizens energy policy
 
01:27:34.070 --> 01:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
it's become increasingly difficult to
 
01:27:35.669 --> 01:27:35.679 align:start position:0%
put in a new pipeline
 
01:27:38.790 --> 01:27:38.800 align:start position:0%
that would be added to this on and
 
01:27:42.790 --> 01:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
it's um it also includes
 
01:27:46.149 --> 01:27:46.159 align:start position:0%
solar installations
 
01:27:50.149 --> 01:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
and um on industrial solar and
 
01:27:53.510 --> 01:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
installations and uh windmill
 
01:27:57.750 --> 01:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
installations as i recall and um
 
01:28:01.510 --> 01:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
those are probably not going to be
 
01:28:05.110 --> 01:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
uh stimulated for a while
 
01:28:09.189 --> 01:28:09.199 align:start position:0%
under under our current administration
 
01:28:12.390 --> 01:28:12.400 align:start position:0%
and um so
 
01:28:16.550 --> 01:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
that keeps it from going up any further
 
01:28:19.830 --> 01:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
and it also may mean
 
01:28:22.870 --> 01:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
that old oil plants
 
01:28:26.550 --> 01:28:26.560 align:start position:0%
and and on the
 
01:28:29.350 --> 01:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
the gas pipelines will do a little
 
01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:29.830 align:start position:0%
the gas pipelines will do a little
better

01:28:29.830 --> 01:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
better
 
01:28:33.750 --> 01:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of their their revenue it's
 
01:28:36.390 --> 01:28:36.400 align:start position:0%
it's kind of difficult for us to tell
 
01:28:37.189 --> 01:28:37.199 align:start position:0%
but it does
 
01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
it does go up and down
 
01:28:43.430 --> 01:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
in cycles as you had more when they were
 
01:28:45.110 --> 01:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
adding a lot more pipelines
 
01:28:48.149 --> 01:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:51.910 --> 01:28:51.920 align:start position:0%
hydro plants are also part of this
 
01:28:55.590 --> 01:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
and the value of these plants do vary
 
01:29:00.310 --> 01:29:00.320 align:start position:0%
with the value of the cost of energy
 
01:29:04.390 --> 01:29:04.400 align:start position:0%
all right missy rex and ames
 
01:29:07.510 --> 01:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
yeah um question is
 
01:29:11.270 --> 01:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
for chris do you know if there's a
 
01:29:16.550 --> 01:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
list of utilities by location that are
 
01:29:21.110 --> 01:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
paying this tax i don't but i can
 
01:29:24.390 --> 01:29:24.400 align:start position:0%
ask dra yeah
 
01:29:29.430 --> 01:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:31.990 --> 01:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
and just as a general observation that
 
01:29:33.430 --> 01:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
01:29:35.590 --> 01:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
tax originated along with the statewide
 
01:29:37.910 --> 01:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
education property tax which was at six
 
01:29:39.830 --> 01:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
dollars and sixty cents an hour when it
 
01:29:41.910 --> 01:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
was initiated
 
01:29:45.110 --> 01:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
and the statewide education property tax
 
01:29:46.310 --> 01:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
which is on
 
01:29:49.430 --> 01:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
property across the state does not apply
 
01:29:52.070 --> 01:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
to the property of the utility property
 
01:29:54.790 --> 01:29:54.800 align:start position:0%
tax applies to
 
01:29:57.030 --> 01:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
has a different tax base than the local
 
01:29:58.790 --> 01:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
property tax
 
01:30:01.189 --> 01:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
rate that's applied to property by
 
01:30:01.199 --> 01:30:05.110 align:start position:0%
rate that's applied to property by
municipalities

01:30:05.110 --> 01:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:10.629 --> 01:30:10.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:13.110 --> 01:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
uh thank you just a question um does
 
01:30:13.669 --> 01:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
this tax
 
01:30:16.310 --> 01:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
include dams like the one on the
 
01:30:17.750 --> 01:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
connecticut river
 
01:30:20.790 --> 01:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
uh in dms elsewhere yes it does
 
01:30:23.590 --> 01:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
and how is how is it since the dam or
 
01:30:25.110 --> 01:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
the river
 
01:30:27.110 --> 01:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
or the property line for vermont and new
 
01:30:28.709 --> 01:30:28.719 align:start position:0%
hampshire is on the vermont side
 
01:30:31.750 --> 01:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
so is there any shared tax or is it all
 
01:30:33.189 --> 01:30:33.199 align:start position:0%
new hampshire on these rivers the
 
01:30:35.189 --> 01:30:35.199 align:start position:0%
connecticut specifically
 
01:30:38.790 --> 01:30:38.800 align:start position:0%
i know the answer to that norm
 
01:30:40.709 --> 01:30:40.719 align:start position:0%
yeah i was actually pulled into the uh
 
01:30:42.070 --> 01:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
science and tech pulled me into a bill
 
01:30:44.310 --> 01:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
last year that had to do with this
 
01:30:46.149 --> 01:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
and basically it split right down the
 
01:30:46.159 --> 01:30:47.590 align:start position:0%
and basically it split right down the
middle

01:30:47.590 --> 01:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
middle
 
01:30:50.390 --> 01:30:50.400 align:start position:0%
whatever the equipment is if it's on the
 
01:30:51.830 --> 01:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
if the generators
 
01:30:54.390 --> 01:30:54.400 align:start position:0%
you know the dam is is divided equally
 
01:30:55.990 --> 01:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
because it theoretically goes right down
 
01:30:56.950 --> 01:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
the middle
 
01:30:59.669 --> 01:30:59.679 align:start position:0%
of the river uh of connecticut river but
 
01:31:00.149 --> 01:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
if the
 
01:31:02.629 --> 01:31:02.639 align:start position:0%
generating port is in in new hampshire
 
01:31:03.910 --> 01:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that
 
01:31:05.350 --> 01:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
we get the you know the generators
 
01:31:07.430 --> 01:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
actually where the generators are
 
01:31:09.350 --> 01:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
uh we get we get credit for it if it's
 
01:31:10.629 --> 01:31:10.639 align:start position:0%
on the vermont side
 
01:31:11.830 --> 01:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
they get credit for it it's my
 
01:31:14.310 --> 01:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
understanding thank you
 
01:31:17.430 --> 01:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
representative abrami the river belongs
 
01:31:21.350 --> 01:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:24.470 --> 01:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
at the vermont on shoreline
 
01:31:26.550 --> 01:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
as it was about 200 years ago or
 
01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:27.750 align:start position:0%
as it was about 200 years ago or
something

01:31:27.750 --> 01:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:31:30.790 --> 01:31:30.800 align:start position:0%
oh that's news to me i i again there's a
 
01:31:32.229 --> 01:31:32.239 align:start position:0%
whole bunch human beings
 
01:31:34.870 --> 01:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
there's like at least uh eight or nine
 
01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
dams along
 
01:31:39.830 --> 01:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
going up from uh up and down the uh
 
01:31:42.950 --> 01:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
our border uh and i
 
01:31:44.149 --> 01:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
that was my recollection of the
 
01:31:46.229 --> 01:31:46.239 align:start position:0%
conversation there's a bill right now
 
01:31:47.270 --> 01:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
about this as well
 
01:31:49.669 --> 01:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
that i've i've co-sponsored they asked
 
01:31:51.350 --> 01:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
me to co-sponsor it
 
01:31:54.470 --> 01:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
um but you know we'll learn more about
 
01:31:55.990 --> 01:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
that or we can find out
 
01:31:58.149 --> 01:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
if what i'm saying is correct but my
 
01:31:59.110 --> 01:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
understanding is that there's
 
01:32:01.350 --> 01:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
some kind of a because because there was
 
01:32:02.629 --> 01:32:02.639 align:start position:0%
an assessor who was
 
01:32:04.870 --> 01:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
challenging the methodology for the
 
01:32:06.390 --> 01:32:06.400 align:start position:0%
assessment and
 
01:32:08.470 --> 01:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
uh and how it gets split between the two
 
01:32:10.390 --> 01:32:10.400 align:start position:0%
states chris would you check with the
 
01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:12.470 align:start position:0%
states chris would you check with the
dra

01:32:12.470 --> 01:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
dra
 
01:32:15.510 --> 01:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
yeah i wrote the question down okay
 
01:32:18.550 --> 01:32:18.560 align:start position:0%
representative southwest um
 
01:32:21.990 --> 01:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
hi just to add to the conversation i do
 
01:32:23.110 --> 01:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
believe also
 
01:32:24.550 --> 01:32:24.560 align:start position:0%
that all of the bridges are new
 
01:32:26.310 --> 01:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire's responsibility
 
01:32:28.629 --> 01:32:28.639 align:start position:0%
because of what was said earlier and so
 
01:32:30.070 --> 01:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
i think the bridges across the
 
01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:30.870 align:start position:0%
i think the bridges across the
connecticut

01:32:30.870 --> 01:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
connecticut
 
01:32:34.550 --> 01:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
are generally on new hampshire's list
 
01:32:37.990 --> 01:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
yes we pay for 80 percent of the bridges
 
01:32:42.870 --> 01:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh cost and the and vermont pays for 20.
 
01:32:45.270 --> 01:32:45.280 align:start position:0%
there are some exceptions though
 
01:32:49.669 --> 01:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:51.669 --> 01:32:51.679 align:start position:0%
yes thank you uh regarding the
 
01:32:53.750 --> 01:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
connecticut river remember the issue we
 
01:32:56.229 --> 01:32:56.239 align:start position:0%
had with the interstate compact
 
01:33:00.149 --> 01:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
uh from the 1930 whatever flood
 
01:33:03.270 --> 01:33:03.280 align:start position:0%
and all that some of
 
01:33:06.470 --> 01:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
the distribution
 
01:33:10.550 --> 01:33:10.560 align:start position:0%
and the formula for that comes from that
 
01:33:14.070 --> 01:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
um interstate compact
 
01:33:16.870 --> 01:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
which is why uh vermont uh gets some of
 
01:33:18.470 --> 01:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
the money or some of the revenue from
 
01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:18.950 align:start position:0%
the money or some of the revenue from
the

01:33:18.950 --> 01:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:33:22.229 --> 01:33:22.239 align:start position:0%
from the taxes and also for yes vermont
 
01:33:23.750 --> 01:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
got to pay for the
 
01:33:26.149 --> 01:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
uh footing for the bridge over the
 
01:33:26.159 --> 01:33:27.350 align:start position:0%
uh footing for the bridge over the
connecticut

01:33:27.350 --> 01:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
connecticut
 
01:33:31.030 --> 01:33:31.040 align:start position:0%
um over just beyond keene there whatever
 
01:33:33.510 --> 01:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
the name of the town that is
 
01:33:36.790 --> 01:33:36.800 align:start position:0%
uh the new bridge they put in and we get
 
01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:37.110 align:start position:0%
uh the new bridge they put in and we get
to

01:33:37.110 --> 01:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:33:39.750 --> 01:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
maintain the entire bridge right up to
 
01:33:42.149 --> 01:33:42.159 align:start position:0%
the rotary and back
 
01:33:44.070 --> 01:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
but i think we could accept these
 
01:33:48.229 --> 01:33:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:51.990 --> 01:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
okay representative tucker says
 
01:33:55.270 --> 01:33:55.280 align:start position:0%
to accept the figures that
 
01:34:03.669 --> 01:34:03.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:07.350 --> 01:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
i see three hands still raised
 
01:34:08.709 --> 01:34:08.719 align:start position:0%
representative murphy you have your
 
01:34:11.990 --> 01:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:14.390 --> 01:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
all right you haven't taken it down okay
 
01:34:17.270 --> 01:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
so i don't see any hands going up
 
01:34:20.470 --> 01:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
so we'll take the figures from utility
 
01:34:29.990 --> 01:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:42.709 --> 01:34:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:45.510 --> 01:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
if you're ready to do d for liquor
 
01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:48.229 align:start position:0%
if you're ready to do d for liquor
transfer

01:34:48.229 --> 01:34:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:56.790 --> 01:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:01.669 --> 01:35:01.679 align:start position:0%
stickers in dog
 
01:35:05.270 --> 01:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:14.470 --> 01:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
seemed fairly okay
 
01:35:26.830 --> 01:35:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:40.830 align:start position:0%
 
yep

01:35:40.830 --> 01:35:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:40.840 --> 01:36:09.830 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:12.870 --> 01:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
liquor sliced and diced their data
 
01:36:15.669 --> 01:36:15.679 align:start position:0%
they should have provided a good set of
 
01:36:15.679 --> 01:36:17.270 align:start position:0%
they should have provided a good set of
data

01:36:17.270 --> 01:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
data
 
01:36:20.070 --> 01:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
so what so what they're trying to show
 
01:36:22.470 --> 01:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
on like this earlier slides
 
01:36:25.750 --> 01:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
is they're bringing in 147
 
01:36:28.149 --> 01:36:28.159 align:start position:0%
million dollars approximately not the
 
01:36:29.830 --> 01:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
beer test but that's all your spirits
 
01:36:31.030 --> 01:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
and wines
 
01:36:33.510 --> 01:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
and licensing's associated with that
 
01:36:35.990 --> 01:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
it's their net profit
 
01:36:37.590 --> 01:36:37.600 align:start position:0%
what happens is that a piece of that
 
01:36:40.790 --> 01:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:43.910 --> 01:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
substance abuse and alcohol fund
 
01:36:47.590 --> 01:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
so when you go to slide nine
 
01:36:52.149 --> 01:36:52.159 align:start position:0%
you're going to see in the table
 
01:36:54.790 --> 01:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
three um three point two three three
 
01:36:55.350 --> 01:36:55.360 align:start position:0%
then six
 
01:36:58.550 --> 01:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
eight eight four ten eighteen point five
 
01:37:00.790 --> 01:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
so in the earlier years here it was i
 
01:37:02.709 --> 01:37:02.719 align:start position:0%
think it for three percent
 
01:37:05.109 --> 01:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
so even before that there was a law that
 
01:37:05.990 --> 01:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
um basically
 
01:37:07.750 --> 01:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
said a certain amount of the liquor
 
01:37:09.430 --> 01:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
revenue should be transferred to this
 
01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:10.390 align:start position:0%
revenue should be transferred to this
fund

01:37:10.390 --> 01:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:37:13.030 --> 01:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
it had always been suspended and just an
 
01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate flat appropriation had been
 
01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:16.070 align:start position:0%
appropriate flat appropriation had been
made

01:37:16.070 --> 01:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
made
 
01:37:19.510 --> 01:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
back in 16 um the decision was made to
 
01:37:21.910 --> 01:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
actually put that law into effect stop
 
01:37:24.070 --> 01:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
suspending and and allow for what
 
01:37:26.950 --> 01:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
it was meant to do to occur except they
 
01:37:28.470 --> 01:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
put it at a lesser percent than
 
01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:29.109 align:start position:0%
put it at a lesser percent than
originally

01:37:29.109 --> 01:37:29.119 align:start position:0%
originally
 
01:37:30.790 --> 01:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
talked about so it was i think it was at
 
01:37:33.189 --> 01:37:33.199 align:start position:0%
three percent originally
 
01:37:36.709 --> 01:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
and then in 20 it got up to in the 19
 
01:37:38.870 --> 01:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
budget i think they bumped it up to 5
 
01:37:40.870 --> 01:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
it might have been for 19 i can't
 
01:37:42.870 --> 01:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
remember exactly
 
01:37:46.390 --> 01:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
but now it's at 5 of their revenue
 
01:37:49.109 --> 01:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
what throws you off when you look at 21
 
01:37:52.550 --> 01:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
as you see there's 18.5
 
01:37:55.270 --> 01:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
in the um house bill 4 which is the
 
01:37:56.870 --> 01:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
trailer bill to the budget
 
01:37:59.669 --> 01:37:59.679 align:start position:0%
uh the 2021 budget it was language it
 
01:38:01.990 --> 01:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
was put in there to
 
01:38:04.470 --> 01:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
address any shortfalls in the granite
 
01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:05.830 align:start position:0%
address any shortfalls in the granite
advantage

01:38:05.830 --> 01:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
advantage
 
01:38:09.030 --> 01:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
medicaid expansion fund so if
 
01:38:11.830 --> 01:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
if there was no if the commissioner
 
01:38:12.790 --> 01:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
estimated on a
 
01:38:15.750 --> 01:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
quarterly basis that there was a need
 
01:38:18.390 --> 01:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
for additional funds they could
 
01:38:20.310 --> 01:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
request that of the liquor fund and at
 
01:38:22.229 --> 01:38:22.239 align:start position:0%
this point this year they've requested
 
01:38:24.629 --> 01:38:24.639 align:start position:0%
an additional 8.5 million dollars
 
01:38:27.030 --> 01:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
would you just review for the committee
 
01:38:30.870 --> 01:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
remembers what the granite fund is
 
01:38:33.990 --> 01:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
the medicaid expansion fund um so
 
01:38:35.910 --> 01:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
when medicaid expansion was discussed in
 
01:38:37.270 --> 01:38:37.280 align:start position:0%
the state um
 
01:38:39.270 --> 01:38:39.280 align:start position:0%
there was a decision made to keep it
 
01:38:42.390 --> 01:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
very separate from the existing medicaid
 
01:38:45.669 --> 01:38:45.679 align:start position:0%
and to fund it with um
 
01:38:47.510 --> 01:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
basically the federal dollars that were
 
01:38:48.709 --> 01:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
originally 100
 
01:38:50.709 --> 01:38:50.719 align:start position:0%
match and then as the program moves
 
01:38:52.790 --> 01:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
forward it becomes less of a match so i
 
01:38:53.270 --> 01:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
think it's
 
01:38:55.910 --> 01:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
going to be in like a 90 10 type of
 
01:38:57.510 --> 01:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
situation eventually i don't know if
 
01:38:58.629 --> 01:38:58.639 align:start position:0%
it's there yet
 
01:39:00.310 --> 01:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
but that ten percent that the state's
 
01:39:01.750 --> 01:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
going to be responsible for whatever the
 
01:39:03.109 --> 01:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
state's responsible for
 
01:39:05.590 --> 01:39:05.600 align:start position:0%
it was a desire not to use general funds
 
01:39:07.910 --> 01:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
so there was a few ways that the state
 
01:39:11.590 --> 01:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
um tried to get at that one of them was
 
01:39:13.430 --> 01:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
the insurance premium tax that you saw
 
01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:14.390 align:start position:0%
the insurance premium tax that you saw
discussed

01:39:14.390 --> 01:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
discussed
 
01:39:15.990 --> 01:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
where some of that goes to the granted
 
01:39:17.430 --> 01:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
advantage so that was
 
01:39:18.950 --> 01:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
instead of directing that to the general
 
01:39:20.390 --> 01:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
fund the decision was made if there's
 
01:39:21.830 --> 01:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
any premiums
 
01:39:24.229 --> 01:39:24.239 align:start position:0%
um associated with the grant advantage
 
01:39:26.550 --> 01:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
it would go directly to help fund that
 
01:39:29.830 --> 01:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
there was also a request
 
01:39:32.950 --> 01:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
to um and i'm trying to think of the
 
01:39:34.310 --> 01:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
right way to put this but
 
01:39:36.550 --> 01:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
basically to have donations from certain
 
01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:37.350 align:start position:0%
basically to have donations from certain
entities

01:39:37.350 --> 01:39:37.360 align:start position:0%
entities
 
01:39:40.709 --> 01:39:40.719 align:start position:0%
help fund this program um you know to
 
01:39:42.229 --> 01:39:42.239 align:start position:0%
offset any potential loss
 
01:39:45.510 --> 01:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
and and then the last budget they
 
01:39:46.870 --> 01:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
included the liquor funds to help
 
01:39:49.669 --> 01:39:49.679 align:start position:0%
address any any other shortfalls
 
01:39:52.790 --> 01:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:55.510 --> 01:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
because of the the debate and concerns
 
01:39:56.390 --> 01:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
around what
 
01:39:58.790 --> 01:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
what this is and how it was set up i i
 
01:39:59.590 --> 01:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
there's been
 
01:40:01.669 --> 01:40:01.679 align:start position:0%
a different path of how they try to
 
01:40:03.030 --> 01:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
shore it up so it doesn't go away
 
01:40:05.030 --> 01:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
because there's language in the law
 
01:40:06.950 --> 01:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
it says if for any reason there's not
 
01:40:08.229 --> 01:40:08.239 align:start position:0%
enough funds
 
01:40:10.149 --> 01:40:10.159 align:start position:0%
for the program then the state shall
 
01:40:11.910 --> 01:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
stop doing it
 
01:40:16.629 --> 01:40:16.639 align:start position:0%
so you know it's always funny to hear
 
01:40:18.629 --> 01:40:18.639 align:start position:0%
that they don't want to use general
 
01:40:19.750 --> 01:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
funds so they
 
01:40:21.189 --> 01:40:21.199 align:start position:0%
when i get it from the electoral fund
 
01:40:22.950 --> 01:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
but the liquor fund is what feeds the
 
01:40:25.430 --> 01:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
01:40:29.990 --> 01:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
yes mr chairman representative
 
01:40:32.790 --> 01:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
i think that the problem is the federal
 
01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:34.470 align:start position:0%
i think that the problem is the federal
statutes

01:40:34.470 --> 01:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
01:40:36.629 --> 01:40:36.639 align:start position:0%
and what controls whether they are going
 
01:40:40.149 --> 01:40:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:40.159 --> 01:40:44.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:40:44.470 --> 01:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:48.830 --> 01:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
just for clarification represent me who
 
01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:51.510 align:start position:0%
just for clarification represent me who
contributes

01:40:51.510 --> 01:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
contributes
 
01:40:54.550 --> 01:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
you're muted i thought
 
01:40:58.070 --> 01:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
i done muted on the federal government
 
01:40:59.990 --> 01:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
so the fact that the program was set up
 
01:41:03.189 --> 01:41:03.199 align:start position:0%
with a anticipated matching
 
01:41:05.189 --> 01:41:05.199 align:start position:0%
so it originally was 100 covered and
 
01:41:07.830 --> 01:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
then over a period of years it would be
 
01:41:09.350 --> 01:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
different percentages and i think it
 
01:41:11.030 --> 01:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
gets down to 90 percent
 
01:41:12.470 --> 01:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
covered where the state has to match
 
01:41:14.070 --> 01:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
that with 10 percent
 
01:41:15.510 --> 01:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
the reason i asked for clarification
 
01:41:17.510 --> 01:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
because early in the process when the
 
01:41:19.510 --> 01:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
state started to
 
01:41:23.109 --> 01:41:23.119 align:start position:0%
have to put up its share
 
01:41:25.109 --> 01:41:25.119 align:start position:0%
there was an effort to have insurance
 
01:41:27.189 --> 01:41:27.199 align:start position:0%
companies and
 
01:41:29.350 --> 01:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
i believe the hospitals make a a
 
01:41:32.229 --> 01:41:32.239 align:start position:0%
donation kind of a required donation
 
01:41:34.149 --> 01:41:34.159 align:start position:0%
and that was found not to be allowed
 
01:41:35.510 --> 01:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
through federal
 
01:41:38.070 --> 01:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
guidance so they've approached in a
 
01:41:39.189 --> 01:41:39.199 align:start position:0%
different way and i
 
01:41:40.550 --> 01:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
and i'm not the best person to be
 
01:41:42.550 --> 01:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
talking about this i'm
 
01:41:48.950 --> 01:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:51.510 --> 01:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
representative ames and i were involved
 
01:41:52.149 --> 01:41:52.159 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:41:56.470 --> 01:41:56.480 align:start position:0%
original uh figuring out how we could do
 
01:41:56.480 --> 01:41:56.870 align:start position:0%
original uh figuring out how we could do
this

01:41:56.870 --> 01:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:42:00.149 --> 01:42:00.159 align:start position:0%
without losing medicaid altogether
 
01:42:02.790 --> 01:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
i think or at least the expanded part i
 
01:42:04.070 --> 01:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
think it was
 
01:42:07.510 --> 01:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
both of them this is just
 
01:42:09.990 --> 01:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
this is just so that they don't have to
 
01:42:10.950 --> 01:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
go back
 
01:42:12.830 --> 01:42:12.840 align:start position:0%
they don't have to go get an
 
01:42:12.840 --> 01:42:17.270 align:start position:0%
they don't have to go get an
appropriation

01:42:17.270 --> 01:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:20.709 --> 01:42:20.719 align:start position:0%
i believe so to
 
01:42:23.430 --> 01:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
minimize any debate on a general fund
 
01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:24.390 align:start position:0%
minimize any debate on a general fund
appropriation

01:42:24.390 --> 01:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
01:42:26.070 --> 01:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
because it was clearly stated in the
 
01:42:28.229 --> 01:42:28.239 align:start position:0%
language in new hampshire's law
 
01:42:29.910 --> 01:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
related to this that general funds
 
01:42:31.990 --> 01:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be used
 
01:42:33.830 --> 01:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
and so the only reason i brought it up
 
01:42:37.590 --> 01:42:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:39.030 --> 01:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
when they're coming before the ways and
 
01:42:40.709 --> 01:42:40.719 align:start position:0%
means committee
 
01:42:42.950 --> 01:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
it looks like if they just talk about
 
01:42:43.910 --> 01:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
what they're um
 
01:42:45.669 --> 01:42:45.679 align:start position:0%
going to deposit to the general fund it
 
01:42:47.030 --> 01:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
looks like they're losing money
 
01:42:49.270 --> 01:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
you know if you look back over the years
 
01:42:51.270 --> 01:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
and so that's why on the earlier slides
 
01:42:53.510 --> 01:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
they try to show you the total amount
 
01:42:55.030 --> 01:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
that they're they're generating
 
01:42:58.709 --> 01:42:58.719 align:start position:0%
and then the legislature has um
 
01:43:01.350 --> 01:43:01.360 align:start position:0%
decided that a piece of that needs to go
 
01:43:02.149 --> 01:43:02.159 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:43:04.229 --> 01:43:04.239 align:start position:0%
governor's commission fund the alcohol
 
01:43:05.750 --> 01:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
and substance abuse one
 
01:43:08.070 --> 01:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
and as well as there's a piece that now
 
01:43:09.750 --> 01:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
can be used to help shore up the granite
 
01:43:11.350 --> 01:43:11.360 align:start position:0%
advantage or the medicaid expansion
 
01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:12.470 align:start position:0%
advantage or the medicaid expansion
program

01:43:12.470 --> 01:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:43:14.390 --> 01:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
um and the first time you're seeing that
 
01:43:17.189 --> 01:43:17.199 align:start position:0%
is in fiscal year 21 and it's the 8.5
 
01:43:19.109 --> 01:43:19.119 align:start position:0%
million of the 10 million
 
01:43:21.350 --> 01:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
that's transferred to the alcohol fund
 
01:43:25.430 --> 01:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
that that's where that's coming from
 
01:43:29.189 --> 01:43:29.199 align:start position:0%
could i ask chris another question
 
01:43:31.830 --> 01:43:31.840 align:start position:0%
do you know or could you find out is
 
01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:32.550 align:start position:0%
do you know or could you find out is
that

01:43:32.550 --> 01:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:43:34.870 --> 01:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
is the current law something that
 
01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:35.910 align:start position:0%
is the current law something that
expires

01:43:35.910 --> 01:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
expires
 
01:43:38.629 --> 01:43:38.639 align:start position:0%
at the end of this budget and they will
 
01:43:38.639 --> 01:43:39.109 align:start position:0%
at the end of this budget and they will
be

01:43:39.109 --> 01:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:43:42.550 --> 01:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
redoing something no um
 
01:43:44.390 --> 01:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
my understanding it's in statute so my
 
01:43:45.910 --> 01:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
understanding is that it's it's
 
01:43:47.910 --> 01:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
it there's no repeal date that i'm aware
 
01:43:49.590 --> 01:43:49.600 align:start position:0%
of at this point
 
01:43:51.430 --> 01:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
i'd have to confirm that but i'll do
 
01:43:52.790 --> 01:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
that chris
 
01:43:57.430 --> 01:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:00.790 --> 01:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
change to 21
 
01:44:04.870 --> 01:44:04.880 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't appear in 22-23
 
01:44:06.790 --> 01:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
right because when liquor commission
 
01:44:09.109 --> 01:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
came before you there was no indication
 
01:44:10.070 --> 01:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:44:13.270 --> 01:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
hhs was going to request any funds they
 
01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:13.990 align:start position:0%
hhs was going to request any funds they
basically

01:44:13.990 --> 01:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
basically
 
01:44:19.430 --> 01:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
um are told we need the money by hhs
 
01:44:21.830 --> 01:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
so anticipation in anticipation of that
 
01:44:23.510 --> 01:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
question i have reached out to karen
 
01:44:24.870 --> 01:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
rounds to see if
 
01:44:27.510 --> 01:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
um if the 8.5 is all they need for
 
01:44:29.590 --> 01:44:29.600 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21 at this point
 
01:44:31.590 --> 01:44:31.600 align:start position:0%
and if there's any uh indication they
 
01:44:34.229 --> 01:44:34.239 align:start position:0%
might need money in 22 and 23.
 
01:44:37.910 --> 01:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:41.590 --> 01:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
excuse me never mind i i said does
 
01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:42.229 align:start position:0%
excuse me never mind i i said does
anybody

01:44:42.229 --> 01:44:42.239 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
01:44:46.070 --> 01:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
believe that oh oh
 
01:44:49.430 --> 01:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
but so statutorily they need to uh that
 
01:44:50.870 --> 01:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
the commissioner and the department of
 
01:44:52.470 --> 01:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
health and human services need to review
 
01:44:53.750 --> 01:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
the program and and
 
01:44:56.470 --> 01:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
they provide a report and through that
 
01:44:58.390 --> 01:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
process that's what drives the
 
01:45:00.470 --> 01:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
the saying they have a need for this
 
01:45:02.709 --> 01:45:02.719 align:start position:0%
eight and a half million dollars
 
01:45:05.189 --> 01:45:05.199 align:start position:0%
can you put that question take this
 
01:45:07.109 --> 01:45:07.119 align:start position:0%
again for us
 
01:45:10.790 --> 01:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
about 22 and 23. yeah i actually i i did
 
01:45:11.910 --> 01:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
that this morning so
 
01:45:19.189 --> 01:45:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:19.199 --> 01:45:19.940 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:45:19.940 --> 01:45:19.950 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:45:19.950 --> 01:45:23.990 align:start position:0%
yes
[Music]

01:45:23.990 --> 01:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:26.470 --> 01:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions on the
 
01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:29.590 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions on the
election

01:45:29.590 --> 01:45:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:33.510 --> 01:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
mr chairman yes uh just
 
01:45:36.870 --> 01:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
a comment that we and the liquor
 
01:45:38.950 --> 01:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
commission are being asked to estimate a
 
01:45:39.750 --> 01:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
number which
 
01:45:43.030 --> 01:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
is is quite dependent on
 
01:45:46.790 --> 01:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
whether the hhs needs to ask for more
 
01:45:49.910 --> 01:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
money in 22 or 23.
 
01:45:53.510 --> 01:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
so on well i think we're going to have
 
01:45:55.750 --> 01:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
to argue out after we get an answer back
 
01:45:56.470 --> 01:45:56.480 align:start position:0%
from them
 
01:45:59.109 --> 01:45:59.119 align:start position:0%
whether we decrease what's going to the
 
01:46:01.109 --> 01:46:01.119 align:start position:0%
general fund in the estimates
 
01:46:04.229 --> 01:46:04.239 align:start position:0%
or not to match what they've asked for
 
01:46:05.109 --> 01:46:05.119 align:start position:0%
this year
 
01:46:07.990 --> 01:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
can you tell me an agency that has an
 
01:46:10.629 --> 01:46:10.639 align:start position:0%
opportunity to ask for the money
 
01:46:17.430 --> 01:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:19.750 --> 01:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
it's on the basis of how many people are
 
01:46:21.990 --> 01:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
using expanded medicaid
 
01:46:25.109 --> 01:46:25.119 align:start position:0%
well chris is going to give us a
 
01:46:25.119 --> 01:46:28.070 align:start position:0%
well chris is going to give us a
response

01:46:28.070 --> 01:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:31.350 --> 01:46:31.360 align:start position:0%
somebody failed administrative policy
 
01:46:31.360 --> 01:46:32.470 align:start position:0%
somebody failed administrative policy
101

01:46:32.470 --> 01:46:32.480 align:start position:0%
101
 
01:46:34.310 --> 01:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
when there's money available asked for
 
01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:36.950 align:start position:0%
when there's money available asked for
it

01:46:36.950 --> 01:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:40.950 --> 01:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
this is very cynical all
 
01:46:44.070 --> 01:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry any further questions or
 
01:46:52.709 --> 01:46:52.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:57.189 --> 01:46:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:00.709 --> 01:47:00.719 align:start position:0%
with taking these as our
 
01:47:03.189 --> 01:47:03.199 align:start position:0%
numbers for right now until we get
 
01:47:06.629 --> 01:47:06.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:10.070 --> 01:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
and we will proceed
 
01:47:13.430 --> 01:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
i guess uh this is representative ames
 
01:47:16.310 --> 01:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
yes i'd like to hold on this uh to see
 
01:47:17.350 --> 01:47:17.360 align:start position:0%
if we can get
 
01:47:21.030 --> 01:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
better information from dhhs
 
01:47:24.310 --> 01:47:24.320 align:start position:0%
yes me too okay
 
01:47:26.950 --> 01:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
we'll do a hold on this yeah normal okay
 
01:47:28.229 --> 01:47:28.239 align:start position:0%
with holding
 
01:47:31.350 --> 01:47:31.360 align:start position:0%
fine okay then that's what we're going
 
01:47:31.830 --> 01:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:47:35.510 --> 01:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
on the liquor let's hold it
 
01:47:38.629 --> 01:47:38.639 align:start position:0%
can we do a lottery next good move
 
01:47:41.189 --> 01:47:41.199 align:start position:0%
norm can we do a lottery next okay we go
 
01:47:43.270 --> 01:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
to lottery uh which is
 
01:47:50.870 --> 01:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
called m on page five you might want to
 
01:48:00.390 --> 01:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:01.990 --> 01:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
while he's doing that norm can i make a
 
01:48:04.629 --> 01:48:04.639 align:start position:0%
comment yes yeah
 
01:48:06.390 --> 01:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
i talked to charlie mcintyre the other
 
01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:07.910 align:start position:0%
i talked to charlie mcintyre the other
day

01:48:07.910 --> 01:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
day
 
01:48:10.550 --> 01:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
and uh about something else but he i
 
01:48:12.229 --> 01:48:12.239 align:start position:0%
said geez how did we do this weekend
 
01:48:13.669 --> 01:48:13.679 align:start position:0%
with the super bowl
 
01:48:17.030 --> 01:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
on sports betting say that again i had a
 
01:48:18.950 --> 01:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
conversation with charlie about
 
01:48:21.590 --> 01:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
about uh something else but then i asked
 
01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:21.990 align:start position:0%
about uh something else but then i asked
him

01:48:21.990 --> 01:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
him
 
01:48:24.629 --> 01:48:24.639 align:start position:0%
in passing how'd we do with the super
 
01:48:24.639 --> 01:48:25.270 align:start position:0%
in passing how'd we do with the super
bowl

01:48:25.270 --> 01:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
bowl
 
01:48:28.310 --> 01:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
uh yeah anticipation of
 
01:48:31.030 --> 01:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
well given that it was tom brady playing
 
01:48:33.750 --> 01:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
um it was a disaster
 
01:48:35.990 --> 01:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
the state lost three million dollars
 
01:48:37.830 --> 01:48:37.840 align:start position:0%
because of so many bets going
 
01:48:40.229 --> 01:48:40.239 align:start position:0%
to the bucks and in different
 
01:48:41.669 --> 01:48:41.679 align:start position:0%
combinations of games but
 
01:48:43.510 --> 01:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
charlie wasn't worried he said this we
 
01:48:45.830 --> 01:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
knew this was going to happen
 
01:48:47.109 --> 01:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
because it's the average of the year
 
01:48:49.510 --> 01:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
that counts in terms of these pools
 
01:48:53.189 --> 01:48:53.199 align:start position:0%
so uh but i thought that was interesting
 
01:48:54.629 --> 01:48:54.639 align:start position:0%
to hear that
 
01:48:57.910 --> 01:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
and the state lost 3 million yeah but
 
01:49:00.470 --> 01:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
it's a very temporary law i mean you
 
01:49:01.430 --> 01:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
would think with all the betting going
 
01:49:02.950 --> 01:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
on for the super bowl that we this would
 
01:49:04.629 --> 01:49:04.639 align:start position:0%
be a good thing
 
01:49:07.430 --> 01:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh but it depends on how people bet uh
 
01:49:09.270 --> 01:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
that's why i said remember i said
 
01:49:10.790 --> 01:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
that there's a risk associated with
 
01:49:13.430 --> 01:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
because the venues also lost money the
 
01:49:15.189 --> 01:49:15.199 align:start position:0%
various charitable gaming
 
01:49:17.669 --> 01:49:17.679 align:start position:0%
are the two to two locations that have
 
01:49:19.189 --> 01:49:19.199 align:start position:0%
sports book now
 
01:49:22.950 --> 01:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
also lost money uh on this because
 
01:49:24.790 --> 01:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
uh there's a risk associated with this
 
01:49:26.830 --> 01:49:26.840 align:start position:0%
the way it's set up
 
01:49:30.149 --> 01:49:30.159 align:start position:0%
um and uh but you know it's like it's
 
01:49:32.470 --> 01:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
like vegas you know over time
 
01:49:35.510 --> 01:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
you know the house always wins so
 
01:49:37.189 --> 01:49:37.199 align:start position:0%
the way this is structured we're part of
 
01:49:38.950 --> 01:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
the house the state is part of the house
 
01:49:38.960 --> 01:49:39.350 align:start position:0%
the house the state is part of the house
these

01:49:39.350 --> 01:49:39.360 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:49:40.950 --> 01:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
venues that are running this are part of
 
01:49:43.510 --> 01:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
the house and uh
 
01:49:44.470 --> 01:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
i just thought it was interesting that
 
01:49:46.950 --> 01:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
we lost money on on the super bowl
 
01:49:49.189 --> 01:49:49.199 align:start position:0%
but uh it's because if brady wasn't
 
01:49:49.199 --> 01:49:50.629 align:start position:0%
but uh it's because if brady wasn't
playing

01:49:50.629 --> 01:49:50.639 align:start position:0%
playing
 
01:49:51.669 --> 01:49:51.679 align:start position:0%
i think it would have been a different
 
01:49:53.669 --> 01:49:53.679 align:start position:0%
outcome uh but there was
 
01:49:55.270 --> 01:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
you know a lot of people rooting for
 
01:49:57.589 --> 01:49:57.599 align:start position:0%
brady and they voted that way
 
01:50:00.950 --> 01:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
um that's charlie's view as well
 
01:50:03.109 --> 01:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
on this one but you know it's just an
 
01:50:04.629 --> 01:50:04.639 align:start position:0%
interesting factoid i i don't think it's
 
01:50:05.910 --> 01:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
really going to impact our
 
01:50:08.390 --> 01:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
discussion here but i was just thought
 
01:50:11.750 --> 01:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
i'd share that with everybody
 
01:50:13.270 --> 01:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
well thank you that's certainly
 
01:50:13.280 --> 01:50:17.030 align:start position:0%
well thank you that's certainly
interesting

01:50:17.030 --> 01:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:19.510 --> 01:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
you know it may not hurt norm that we we
 
01:50:21.270 --> 01:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
get a refresher course on how
 
01:50:24.390 --> 01:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
from charlie how sports betting
 
01:50:28.149 --> 01:50:28.159 align:start position:0%
how that all really works um
 
01:50:32.149 --> 01:50:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:33.990 --> 01:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
well that's well you talking about my
 
01:50:38.629 --> 01:50:38.639 align:start position:0%
historic racing bill
 
01:50:39.990 --> 01:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
we could talk about it then until about
 
01:50:41.510 --> 01:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
i don't want to mix apples and oranges
 
01:50:42.310 --> 01:50:42.320 align:start position:0%
there but
 
01:50:44.790 --> 01:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
um but we may have similar conversations
 
01:50:45.430 --> 01:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
about that
 
01:50:51.589 --> 01:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:55.990 --> 01:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
all heard so we're on the lottery
 
01:51:00.229 --> 01:51:00.239 align:start position:0%
column m chris
 
01:51:03.430 --> 01:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
do you have any comments i don't
 
01:51:05.270 --> 01:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
um i mean you can see that there's been
 
01:51:07.430 --> 01:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
an uptick in the revenue assumptions
 
01:51:09.830 --> 01:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
um and i think that charlie indicated a
 
01:51:11.589 --> 01:51:11.599 align:start position:0%
lot of that is the uh
 
01:51:14.870 --> 01:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
the mobile and internet aspect along
 
01:51:16.550 --> 01:51:16.560 align:start position:0%
with the sports betting that has really
 
01:51:16.560 --> 01:51:17.030 align:start position:0%
with the sports betting that has really
helped

01:51:17.030 --> 01:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
helped
 
01:51:21.189 --> 01:51:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:26.950 --> 01:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:30.229 --> 01:51:30.239 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
01:51:35.910 --> 01:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:37.830 --> 01:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
if norm this is representative burst
 
01:51:39.109 --> 01:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
didn't have a question
 
01:51:41.430 --> 01:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
yes representative bernstein well it's
 
01:51:42.950 --> 01:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
regarding what what pat
 
01:51:45.830 --> 01:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh what representative abrami just said
 
01:51:48.310 --> 01:51:48.320 align:start position:0%
and that's that the state lost money
 
01:51:50.550 --> 01:51:50.560 align:start position:0%
i i always thought that a sports book
 
01:51:50.560 --> 01:51:51.350 align:start position:0%
i i always thought that a sports book
adjusts

01:51:51.350 --> 01:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
adjusts
 
01:51:54.629 --> 01:51:54.639 align:start position:0%
the odds so if too much money is coming
 
01:51:54.639 --> 01:51:55.189 align:start position:0%
the odds so if too much money is coming
in

01:51:55.189 --> 01:51:55.199 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:51:58.790 --> 01:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
for um for the bucks
 
01:52:00.950 --> 01:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
then the odds should be adjusted to
 
01:52:02.870 --> 01:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
incentivize people to put more money on
 
01:52:03.990 --> 01:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
the chiefs
 
01:52:06.390 --> 01:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
so the state is not vulnerable or so the
 
01:52:08.470 --> 01:52:08.480 align:start position:0%
sports book is not vulnerable to losing
 
01:52:09.669 --> 01:52:09.679 align:start position:0%
money in other words
 
01:52:13.350 --> 01:52:13.360 align:start position:0%
by the time the game kicks off
 
01:52:16.149 --> 01:52:16.159 align:start position:0%
the bookmaker once not be all that but a
 
01:52:18.310 --> 01:52:18.320 align:start position:0%
large portion of it was the fact that
 
01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:19.030 align:start position:0%
large portion of it was the fact that
it's

01:52:19.030 --> 01:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:52:23.669 --> 01:52:23.679 align:start position:0%
new england so everyone rooted for brady
 
01:52:25.589 --> 01:52:25.599 align:start position:0%
and whereas draftkings which that's
 
01:52:27.109 --> 01:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
where the bets are going through they
 
01:52:28.870 --> 01:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
need to make sure they're balanced
 
01:52:30.390 --> 01:52:30.400 align:start position:0%
nationally which is a completely
 
01:52:33.030 --> 01:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
different picture so kansas city
 
01:52:34.950 --> 01:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
whatever sport books are in kansas city
 
01:52:38.709 --> 01:52:38.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:40.470 --> 01:52:40.480 align:start position:0%
okay it's just a little troubling that
 
01:52:41.990 --> 01:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire can actually
 
01:52:44.390 --> 01:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
lose money on a proposition where we're
 
01:52:46.470 --> 01:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
not supposed to lose money you know and
 
01:52:47.750 --> 01:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
that's why i think
 
01:52:50.550 --> 01:52:50.560 align:start position:0%
it'd be helpful to to the committee that
 
01:52:51.109 --> 01:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
we hear
 
01:52:53.109 --> 01:52:53.119 align:start position:0%
charlie i think specifically come in to
 
01:52:54.629 --> 01:52:54.639 align:start position:0%
talk to us about
 
01:52:57.750 --> 01:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
how how that all works we will have that
 
01:52:57.760 --> 01:52:59.589 align:start position:0%
how how that all works we will have that
happen

01:52:59.589 --> 01:52:59.599 align:start position:0%
happen
 
01:53:04.390 --> 01:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:07.430 --> 01:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
any further explanation questions
 
01:53:10.830 --> 01:53:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:10.840 --> 01:53:13.189 align:start position:0%
 
lottery

01:53:13.189 --> 01:53:13.199 align:start position:0%
lottery
 
01:53:16.470 --> 01:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
you don't want to uh hold the lottery
 
01:53:17.350 --> 01:53:17.360 align:start position:0%
until we
 
01:53:20.390 --> 01:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
talk to charlie no
 
01:53:24.070 --> 01:53:24.080 align:start position:0%
we're okay you're okay
 
01:53:26.950 --> 01:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
i think he's he's he tends to be
 
01:53:26.960 --> 01:53:27.589 align:start position:0%
i think he's he's he tends to be
moderate

01:53:27.589 --> 01:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
moderate
 
01:53:29.910 --> 01:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
unlike our previous people he tends to
 
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
be moderate about his estimates
 
01:53:36.629 --> 01:53:36.639 align:start position:0%
and he was building it in so we will go
 
01:53:36.639 --> 01:53:36.950 align:start position:0%
and he was building it in so we will go
with

01:53:36.950 --> 01:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:53:40.950 --> 01:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
lottery yes yes
 
01:53:45.430 --> 01:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:51.350 --> 01:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:58.390 --> 01:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:02.470 --> 01:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
can you bring that up chris yep
 
01:54:05.669 --> 01:54:05.679 align:start position:0%
you should you see it right yep
 
01:54:09.030 --> 01:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
we do now yeah just took me a second to
 
01:54:11.109 --> 01:54:11.119 align:start position:0%
switch screens
 
01:54:13.830 --> 01:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
everything seems it's instantaneous but
 
01:54:19.589 --> 01:54:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:21.510 --> 01:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
so just uh before you jump into the
 
01:54:23.350 --> 01:54:23.360 align:start position:0%
securities do you want me to invite
 
01:54:24.950 --> 01:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
charlie to come talk to you about sports
 
01:54:24.960 --> 01:54:25.430 align:start position:0%
charlie to come talk to you about sports
betting

01:54:25.430 --> 01:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
betting
 
01:54:29.030 --> 01:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
on the 16th or no yes
 
01:55:03.189 --> 01:55:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:06.790 --> 01:55:06.800 align:start position:0%
i don't see any reason not to take the
 
01:55:26.550 --> 01:55:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:30.830 --> 01:55:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:30.840 --> 01:56:07.910 align:start position:0%
 
presentation

01:56:07.910 --> 01:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:10.550 --> 01:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
are you bringing up the securities page
 
01:56:12.950 --> 01:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry no
 
01:56:27.030 --> 01:56:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:28.629 --> 01:56:28.639 align:start position:0%
so what i'm going to bring up is what he
 
01:56:30.310 --> 01:56:30.320 align:start position:0%
provided you last week
 
01:56:30.320 --> 01:56:40.830 align:start position:0%
provided you last week
yes

01:56:40.830 --> 01:56:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:40.840 --> 01:56:46.070 align:start position:0%
 
maybe

01:56:46.070 --> 01:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:48.870 --> 01:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
you know that's it so so this page is
 
01:56:49.990 --> 01:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
essentially the same as the
 
01:56:51.750 --> 01:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
the one you got the week before what he
 
01:56:53.270 --> 01:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
provided you uh
 
01:56:55.510 --> 01:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
mr glennon provided you an update of uh
 
01:56:58.070 --> 01:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
it was through 131 2021
 
01:56:59.350 --> 01:56:59.360 align:start position:0%
the one i think in the earlier
 
01:57:01.669 --> 01:57:01.679 align:start position:0%
presentation was just through december
 
01:57:03.030 --> 01:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
and he just wanted the committee to see
 
01:57:04.790 --> 01:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
that they had gotten some revenue that
 
01:57:07.030 --> 01:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
at that time wasn't showing
 
01:57:09.189 --> 01:57:09.199 align:start position:0%
but his projections did not change down
 
01:57:10.629 --> 01:57:10.639 align:start position:0%
over here
 
01:57:21.109 --> 01:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:23.430 --> 01:57:23.440 align:start position:0%
which is made up of the investment
 
01:57:25.870 --> 01:57:25.880 align:start position:0%
advisors fees security registration
 
01:57:32.629 --> 01:57:32.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:36.830 --> 01:57:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:36.840 --> 01:57:40.709 align:start position:0%
 
predictable

01:57:40.709 --> 01:57:40.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:44.229 --> 01:57:44.239 align:start position:0%
representative uh hacking phillips
 
01:57:47.270 --> 01:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
hey mr chair i just wanted to say that i
 
01:57:48.550 --> 01:57:48.560 align:start position:0%
feel pretty comfortable with these
 
01:57:50.229 --> 01:57:50.239 align:start position:0%
numbers i'd like to make a motion to
 
01:57:51.430 --> 01:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
accept as presented
 
01:57:54.229 --> 01:57:54.239 align:start position:0%
i think the updates we received last
 
01:57:54.239 --> 01:57:55.990 align:start position:0%
i think the updates we received last
week

01:57:55.990 --> 01:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
week
 
01:57:57.750 --> 01:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
does further substantiate their
 
01:58:01.830 --> 01:58:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:10.310 --> 01:58:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:15.030 --> 01:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:17.750 --> 01:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
well i think we're down to the dra of
 
01:58:18.629 --> 01:58:18.639 align:start position:0%
the dra
 
01:58:22.470 --> 01:58:22.480 align:start position:0%
ones now uh let me see
 
01:58:26.709 --> 01:58:26.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:27.910 --> 01:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
why don't you go through the sheet from
 
01:58:29.910 --> 01:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh a to beta
 
01:58:31.910 --> 01:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
business taxes we haven't done meals in
 
01:58:34.149 --> 01:58:34.159 align:start position:0%
rooms we haven't done
 
01:58:34.159 --> 01:58:36.790 align:start position:0%
rooms we haven't done
um

01:58:36.790 --> 01:58:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:36.800 --> 01:58:38.149 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:58:38.149 --> 01:58:38.159 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:58:42.149 --> 01:58:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:44.310 --> 01:58:44.320 align:start position:0%
let's do red first it's on that page
 
01:58:46.390 --> 01:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
with the others that we've already done
 
01:58:47.750 --> 01:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
yeah real estate transfer we haven't
 
01:58:50.550 --> 01:58:50.560 align:start position:0%
done i think those are the five majors
 
01:58:53.830 --> 01:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:03.270 --> 01:59:03.280 align:start position:0%
on that page okay
 
01:59:09.589 --> 01:59:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:14.830 --> 01:59:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:17.270 --> 01:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
first and the agency
 
01:59:19.830 --> 01:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
has come in with a high and a low on
 
01:59:25.910 --> 01:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:28.830 --> 01:59:28.840 align:start position:0%
any questions or comments on the real
 
01:59:28.840 --> 01:59:33.189 align:start position:0%
any questions or comments on the real
estate

01:59:33.189 --> 01:59:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:36.470 --> 01:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
well currently the norm uh yeah i think
 
01:59:38.149 --> 01:59:38.159 align:start position:0%
most of the uh
 
01:59:41.910 --> 01:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
boom this phenomenon of all these folks
 
01:59:44.070 --> 01:59:44.080 align:start position:0%
moving into new hampshire
 
01:59:47.270 --> 01:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh bidding up bidding up the prices of
 
01:59:47.280 --> 01:59:47.669 align:start position:0%
uh bidding up bidding up the prices of
the

01:59:47.669 --> 01:59:47.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:59:50.790 --> 01:59:50.800 align:start position:0%
of these properties uh and that's
 
01:59:55.030 --> 01:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
what's reflective in the 2021 number
 
01:59:59.430 --> 01:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
um and then it appears the dra is
 
02:00:01.510 --> 02:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
is assuming that that trend will not
 
02:00:01.520 --> 02:00:02.870 align:start position:0%
is assuming that that trend will not
continue

02:00:02.870 --> 02:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
continue
 
02:00:06.629 --> 02:00:06.639 align:start position:0%
i mean it's it's really well above
 
02:00:08.950 --> 02:00:08.960 align:start position:0%
they're projecting a range of 187
 
02:00:10.629 --> 02:00:10.639 align:start position:0%
million to 193
 
02:00:14.550 --> 02:00:14.560 align:start position:0%
on 194 million for 20 21
 
02:00:17.430 --> 02:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
and then they backed that they backed
 
02:00:18.470 --> 02:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
that down a bit
 
02:00:21.030 --> 02:00:21.040 align:start position:0%
over the next couple of years and again
 
02:00:22.310 --> 02:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
the only thing i can remember from the
 
02:00:23.270 --> 02:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
conversation it
 
02:00:25.910 --> 02:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
was this bubble if you will of people
 
02:00:27.430 --> 02:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
moving out of the cities
 
02:00:29.750 --> 02:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
coming coming to new hampshire and
 
02:00:31.270 --> 02:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
there's bidding wars i think none of us
 
02:00:32.310 --> 02:00:32.320 align:start position:0%
will disagree with that
 
02:00:35.350 --> 02:00:35.360 align:start position:0%
that that's what's got been going on
 
02:00:37.910 --> 02:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
but the question is will that continue
 
02:00:37.920 --> 02:00:38.950 align:start position:0%
but the question is will that continue
um

02:00:38.950 --> 02:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:40.709 --> 02:00:40.719 align:start position:0%
and it looks like the dra is saying no
 
02:00:42.310 --> 02:00:42.320 align:start position:0%
that that's that's going to
 
02:00:46.310 --> 02:00:46.320 align:start position:0%
kind of step itself back to more normal
 
02:00:50.229 --> 02:00:50.239 align:start position:0%
conditions that's my that's my read so
 
02:00:55.189 --> 02:00:55.199 align:start position:0%
others weigh in on that
 
02:00:57.270 --> 02:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
uh representative followed by
 
02:01:07.270 --> 02:01:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:09.189 --> 02:01:09.199 align:start position:0%
sorry i believe that representative
 
02:01:11.030 --> 02:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
tudor had his hand up first
 
02:01:14.550 --> 02:01:14.560 align:start position:0%
and then me and then uh rep spokesperson
 
02:01:18.629 --> 02:01:18.639 align:start position:0%
southwood um okay on my screen
 
02:01:29.510 --> 02:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:33.750 --> 02:01:33.760 align:start position:0%
okay i am a little concerned and i've
 
02:01:35.589 --> 02:01:35.599 align:start position:0%
been trying to find it in my notes but i
 
02:01:35.599 --> 02:01:36.310 align:start position:0%
been trying to find it in my notes but i
remember

02:01:36.310 --> 02:01:36.320 align:start position:0%
remember
 
02:01:40.390 --> 02:01:40.400 align:start position:0%
reading it again over the weekend
 
02:01:43.990 --> 02:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
on that the new hampshire housing
 
02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:44.709 align:start position:0%
on that the new hampshire housing
finance

02:01:44.709 --> 02:01:44.719 align:start position:0%
finance
 
02:01:47.750 --> 02:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
authority reported that
 
02:01:51.589 --> 02:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
on of the people that were buying
 
02:01:54.870 --> 02:01:54.880 align:start position:0%
housing last year uh from uh
 
02:01:58.870 --> 02:01:58.880 align:start position:0%
january to october of of 20
 
02:02:02.310 --> 02:02:02.320 align:start position:0%
on no to august of 20 which does contain
 
02:02:03.270 --> 02:02:03.280 align:start position:0%
the first
 
02:02:06.629 --> 02:02:06.639 align:start position:0%
part of the pandemic impact
 
02:02:09.910 --> 02:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
that on i think it was 16
 
02:02:13.510 --> 02:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
18 of the people buying were
 
02:02:16.149 --> 02:02:16.159 align:start position:0%
resident in massachusetts but only one
 
02:02:16.159 --> 02:02:16.709 align:start position:0%
resident in massachusetts but only one
percent

02:02:16.709 --> 02:02:16.719 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:02:19.910 --> 02:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
anywhere else outside the state and that
 
02:02:23.510 --> 02:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
eighty percent of the of the purchases
 
02:02:26.470 --> 02:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
were from inside new hampshire i would
 
02:02:27.270 --> 02:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
really like
 
02:02:31.270 --> 02:02:31.280 align:start position:0%
to see data on uh what that looked like
 
02:02:34.070 --> 02:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
in previous years do we really have the
 
02:02:36.229 --> 02:02:36.239 align:start position:0%
influx that we think we have or
 
02:02:39.350 --> 02:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
have we kind of built it up and do they
 
02:02:44.470 --> 02:02:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:47.589 --> 02:02:47.599 align:start position:0%
chris you think we can get that
 
02:02:48.950 --> 02:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
i can reach out to the new hampshire
 
02:02:50.629 --> 02:02:50.639 align:start position:0%
housing finance authority to see what
 
02:02:52.310 --> 02:02:52.320 align:start position:0%
they have for information
 
02:02:52.320 --> 02:02:55.510 align:start position:0%
they have for information
okay

02:02:55.510 --> 02:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:59.350 --> 02:02:59.360 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury right
 
02:03:01.589 --> 02:03:01.599 align:start position:0%
i i'm comfortable with the idea that
 
02:03:02.709 --> 02:03:02.719 align:start position:0%
there's a clear
 
02:03:07.430 --> 02:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
increase anticipated for fy 21.
 
02:03:09.430 --> 02:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
uh from the connecticut river valley
 
02:03:10.790 --> 02:03:10.800 align:start position:0%
side where i'm at
 
02:03:14.229 --> 02:03:14.239 align:start position:0%
i'd say it's been a discernible pattern
 
02:03:17.589 --> 02:03:17.599 align:start position:0%
but not as great as
 
02:03:20.070 --> 02:03:20.080 align:start position:0%
a national and general press suggests at
 
02:03:22.149 --> 02:03:22.159 align:start position:0%
least here
 
02:03:26.550 --> 02:03:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:29.669 --> 02:03:29.679 align:start position:0%
given the the measurable
 
02:03:31.589 --> 02:03:31.599 align:start position:0%
increase that we've seen more or less
 
02:03:33.350 --> 02:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
since july august
 
02:03:34.870 --> 02:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
by the way i've looked at real estate
 
02:03:38.629 --> 02:03:38.639 align:start position:0%
sales in our town and surrounding towns
 
02:03:42.310 --> 02:03:42.320 align:start position:0%
and there were closings in march
 
02:03:45.109 --> 02:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
uh maybe early april based on contracts
 
02:03:46.470 --> 02:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
already in place
 
02:03:48.950 --> 02:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
the market then died for three to four
 
02:03:48.960 --> 02:03:50.229 align:start position:0%
the market then died for three to four
months

02:03:50.229 --> 02:03:50.239 align:start position:0%
months
 
02:03:52.709 --> 02:03:52.719 align:start position:0%
it wasn't until august that it was
 
02:03:52.719 --> 02:03:54.470 align:start position:0%
it wasn't until august that it was
rekindled

02:03:54.470 --> 02:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
rekindled
 
02:03:57.030 --> 02:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
um there have actually been very few
 
02:03:57.040 --> 02:03:58.310 align:start position:0%
um there have actually been very few
sales

02:03:58.310 --> 02:03:58.320 align:start position:0%
sales
 
02:04:00.149 --> 02:04:00.159 align:start position:0%
they've generally been at five to eight
 
02:04:02.069 --> 02:04:02.079 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars over asking price which
 
02:04:02.079 --> 02:04:03.030 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars over asking price which
is

02:04:03.030 --> 02:04:03.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:04:06.629 --> 02:04:06.639 align:start position:0%
truly a positive indicator but
 
02:04:09.030 --> 02:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
i think the most noticeable thing is how
 
02:04:12.310 --> 02:04:12.320 align:start position:0%
few properties are on the market
 
02:04:15.510 --> 02:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
now i actually think that bodes well
 
02:04:18.229 --> 02:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
because i think that the psychological
 
02:04:18.239 --> 02:04:19.189 align:start position:0%
because i think that the psychological
impacts

02:04:19.189 --> 02:04:19.199 align:start position:0%
impacts
 
02:04:21.270 --> 02:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
of the pandemic are going to hold for a
 
02:04:23.430 --> 02:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
few years anyway
 
02:04:26.390 --> 02:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
and i think that there will be more
 
02:04:28.229 --> 02:04:28.239 align:start position:0%
homes on the market
 
02:04:31.430 --> 02:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
and more homes available to transact so
 
02:04:34.069 --> 02:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
my question is actually not
 
02:04:37.830 --> 02:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
whether we're over estimating
 
02:04:40.229 --> 02:04:40.239 align:start position:0%
it's that i think based on what's
 
02:04:40.239 --> 02:04:40.870 align:start position:0%
it's that i think based on what's
happening

02:04:40.870 --> 02:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
happening
 
02:04:44.470 --> 02:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
in 21 even with limited availability
 
02:04:46.709 --> 02:04:46.719 align:start position:0%
it's not likely to dip as much as this
 
02:04:48.069 --> 02:04:48.079 align:start position:0%
forecast suggests
 
02:04:52.709 --> 02:04:52.719 align:start position:0%
in 2023
 
02:05:02.950 --> 02:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:06.390 --> 02:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
that's southworth uh i'm sorry
 
02:05:09.669 --> 02:05:09.679 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry about that um yes just as a
 
02:05:09.679 --> 02:05:10.870 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry about that um yes just as a
follow-up

02:05:10.870 --> 02:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:05:13.350 --> 02:05:13.360 align:start position:0%
seems to me they made a pretty good case
 
02:05:15.189 --> 02:05:15.199 align:start position:0%
that the availability
 
02:05:16.790 --> 02:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
is going to just be a really tight
 
02:05:18.310 --> 02:05:18.320 align:start position:0%
market just because
 
02:05:20.390 --> 02:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
of you know new homes and all the other
 
02:05:23.189 --> 02:05:23.199 align:start position:0%
factors related to availability
 
02:05:24.950 --> 02:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
so i guess i'd like to hear more from
 
02:05:26.229 --> 02:05:26.239 align:start position:0%
them about that
 
02:05:28.709 --> 02:05:28.719 align:start position:0%
but it just seems like that's really a
 
02:05:30.470 --> 02:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
big part of that drop
 
02:05:32.550 --> 02:05:32.560 align:start position:0%
for the next two years is there just
 
02:05:33.910 --> 02:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
aren't going to be enough places
 
02:05:33.920 --> 02:05:34.790 align:start position:0%
aren't going to be enough places
available

02:05:34.790 --> 02:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
available
 
02:05:42.550 --> 02:05:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:46.390 --> 02:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
representative tudor
 
02:05:48.149 --> 02:05:48.159 align:start position:0%
yeah my regulation was the same as
 
02:05:49.750 --> 02:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
representative southwest that the
 
02:05:51.430 --> 02:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
inventory was going to dry up and that
 
02:05:52.870 --> 02:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
was what was going to drive the real
 
02:05:57.589 --> 02:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:01.430 --> 02:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
02:06:03.350 --> 02:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
of brawny followed by representative
 
02:06:04.550 --> 02:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
hack and phillips
 
02:06:08.470 --> 02:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:10.709 --> 02:06:10.719 align:start position:0%
her handle was the first okay
 
02:06:10.719 --> 02:06:12.709 align:start position:0%
her handle was the first okay
representative

02:06:12.709 --> 02:06:12.719 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:06:16.390 --> 02:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
so mr peter's been waiting oh
 
02:06:22.149 --> 02:06:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:25.430 --> 02:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
should i go ahead mr chair yes thank you
 
02:06:29.189 --> 02:06:29.199 align:start position:0%
um so just um as someone who practices
 
02:06:30.229 --> 02:06:30.239 align:start position:0%
real estate law
 
02:06:34.470 --> 02:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
who was very busy last year um between
 
02:06:37.669 --> 02:06:37.679 align:start position:0%
march and um really the end of the year
 
02:06:40.069 --> 02:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
we did notice a slight dip for
 
02:06:42.390 --> 02:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
residential and commercial closings
 
02:06:45.510 --> 02:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
um in late april but i i should say that
 
02:06:47.350 --> 02:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
our overall
 
02:06:49.189 --> 02:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
experience was pretty steady throughout
 
02:06:51.270 --> 02:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
the year um
 
02:06:52.629 --> 02:06:52.639 align:start position:0%
the other issue i'd like to just bring
 
02:06:54.870 --> 02:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
up is that i know the 20
 
02:06:58.390 --> 02:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21 numbers were 100
 
02:07:01.990 --> 02:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
above their plan according to the
 
02:07:04.470 --> 02:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
folks who presented but they did mention
 
02:07:05.510 --> 02:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
that anomalous
 
02:07:08.709 --> 02:07:08.719 align:start position:0%
holding company activity that they
 
02:07:10.550 --> 02:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
did not believe would continue at the
 
02:07:12.149 --> 02:07:12.159 align:start position:0%
same rate so that may also
 
02:07:15.189 --> 02:07:15.199 align:start position:0%
help explain why 21 seems to be
 
02:07:17.750 --> 02:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
exponentially higher and that they don't
 
02:07:22.550 --> 02:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:27.270 --> 02:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
okay you know at the end of january the
 
02:07:30.229 --> 02:07:30.239 align:start position:0%
real estate transfer tax
 
02:07:35.270 --> 02:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
and that reflects the december activity
 
02:07:38.790 --> 02:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
to july to december is up
 
02:07:44.390 --> 02:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:48.629 --> 02:07:48.639 align:start position:0%
it's really hot for the last six months
 
02:07:51.750 --> 02:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
now how long will it remain that way
 
02:07:55.270 --> 02:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
i do know i have a grandson that
 
02:07:57.189 --> 02:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
he's come back from his third deployment
 
02:07:59.109 --> 02:07:59.119 align:start position:0%
he's got a couple kids and he's trying
 
02:08:00.950 --> 02:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
to buy a home
 
02:08:04.790 --> 02:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
and at least when he looks at
 
02:08:08.629 --> 02:08:08.639 align:start position:0%
his outbid and it isn't good by five or
 
02:08:10.149 --> 02:08:10.159 align:start position:0%
ten million uh
 
02:08:12.069 --> 02:08:12.079 align:start position:0%
five or ten thousand dollars a lot more
 
02:08:13.510 --> 02:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
than that
 
02:08:16.550 --> 02:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
in the area that we live in so
 
02:08:21.589 --> 02:08:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:25.750 --> 02:08:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:27.350 --> 02:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
well let me know you don't have your
 
02:08:29.430 --> 02:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
hands up sorry about that
 
02:08:34.069 --> 02:08:34.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:36.790 --> 02:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
yeah um i i recall i think one of our
 
02:08:38.790 --> 02:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
experts that we had
 
02:08:41.589 --> 02:08:41.599 align:start position:0%
uh one of the economists uh talked to
 
02:08:42.390 --> 02:08:42.400 align:start position:0%
this issue
 
02:08:43.669 --> 02:08:43.679 align:start position:0%
about what's going on and i remember
 
02:08:45.510 --> 02:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
asking the question well
 
02:08:48.390 --> 02:08:48.400 align:start position:0%
supply and demand and i said well geez
 
02:08:50.069 --> 02:08:50.079 align:start position:0%
this seems like a great opportunity
 
02:08:52.790 --> 02:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
for bill you know invest you know for uh
 
02:08:52.800 --> 02:08:53.589 align:start position:0%
for bill you know invest you know for uh
developers

02:08:53.589 --> 02:08:53.599 align:start position:0%
developers
 
02:08:56.790 --> 02:08:56.800 align:start position:0%
builders to build more
 
02:08:58.870 --> 02:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
residences and he but he gave me a lit
 
02:09:01.830 --> 02:09:01.840 align:start position:0%
he gave us all a litany of reasons why
 
02:09:05.430 --> 02:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
that's not happening um
 
02:09:07.750 --> 02:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
you know the prop you know just the land
 
02:09:09.430 --> 02:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
cost themselves
 
02:09:12.709 --> 02:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
the uh the lack of uh tradesmen uh there
 
02:09:13.669 --> 02:09:13.679 align:start position:0%
was a variety of
 
02:09:16.950 --> 02:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
of things that uh and i don't have that
 
02:09:18.550 --> 02:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
right in front of me but
 
02:09:21.030 --> 02:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
um so there there were other people who
 
02:09:22.149 --> 02:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
were saying yes that
 
02:09:24.310 --> 02:09:24.320 align:start position:0%
you would think that it'd be more
 
02:09:25.669 --> 02:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
construction because there's plenty of
 
02:09:25.679 --> 02:09:27.109 align:start position:0%
construction because there's plenty of
demand

02:09:27.109 --> 02:09:27.119 align:start position:0%
demand
 
02:09:29.830 --> 02:09:29.840 align:start position:0%
and with more demand the pricing would
 
02:09:30.629 --> 02:09:30.639 align:start position:0%
come down a bit
 
02:09:33.830 --> 02:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
but um again that's that's all i want to
 
02:09:34.870 --> 02:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
say on that
 
02:09:36.310 --> 02:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
i think there's just a phenomenon going
 
02:09:38.470 --> 02:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
on here uh
 
02:09:41.430 --> 02:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
that's pushing up the prices and again
 
02:09:42.069 --> 02:09:42.079 align:start position:0%
let's let's
 
02:09:44.550 --> 02:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
discern maybe we need to get maybe we
 
02:09:45.990 --> 02:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
need to get those numbers in front of us
 
02:09:49.109 --> 02:09:49.119 align:start position:0%
i think the number of transactions may
 
02:09:50.709 --> 02:09:50.719 align:start position:0%
not be as
 
02:09:52.390 --> 02:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
what's driving this it's just the cost
 
02:09:54.310 --> 02:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
it's the price of the homes
 
02:09:56.149 --> 02:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
and other properties that are driving
 
02:09:57.669 --> 02:09:57.679 align:start position:0%
this right
 
02:10:02.069 --> 02:10:02.079 align:start position:0%
because it is the cost right we will be
 
02:10:03.990 --> 02:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
we will be getting somebody else from
 
02:10:05.270 --> 02:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
the real estate that
 
02:10:09.030 --> 02:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
understands the the economy
 
02:10:12.830 --> 02:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
for real estate to talk to the committee
 
02:10:20.310 --> 02:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:23.910 --> 02:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:26.310 --> 02:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i believe that was
 
02:10:28.069 --> 02:10:28.079 align:start position:0%
ben frost
 
02:10:31.669 --> 02:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
on that was talking about that i've been
 
02:10:35.270 --> 02:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
involved in our local housing market
 
02:10:39.109 --> 02:10:39.119 align:start position:0%
for 20 years now with bankers and
 
02:10:41.910 --> 02:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
and a number of other people and talking
 
02:10:43.669 --> 02:10:43.679 align:start position:0%
with the developers
 
02:10:46.709 --> 02:10:46.719 align:start position:0%
and it's gotten worse and worse and we
 
02:10:46.719 --> 02:10:47.270 align:start position:0%
and it's gotten worse and worse and we
really

02:10:47.270 --> 02:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
really
 
02:10:51.430 --> 02:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
are in the situation now where on
 
02:10:55.510 --> 02:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
housing under 300 000 is pretty much
 
02:11:00.790 --> 02:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
impossible to to create and profit by
 
02:11:02.950 --> 02:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
in what the builders consider a
 
02:11:04.709 --> 02:11:04.719 align:start position:0%
reasonable profit
 
02:11:08.069 --> 02:11:08.079 align:start position:0%
on without some kind of subsidy
 
02:11:11.350 --> 02:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
from from the governments the federal or
 
02:11:11.360 --> 02:11:11.669 align:start position:0%
from from the governments the federal or
the

02:11:11.669 --> 02:11:11.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:11:15.189 --> 02:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
or the state and uh
 
02:11:19.510 --> 02:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
but that's where most of the demand is
 
02:11:22.870 --> 02:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
in in my community um which some people
 
02:11:22.880 --> 02:11:23.189 align:start position:0%
in in my community um which some people
think

02:11:23.189 --> 02:11:23.199 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:11:26.069 --> 02:11:26.079 align:start position:0%
is wealthy we have very few homes above
 
02:11:26.079 --> 02:11:26.790 align:start position:0%
is wealthy we have very few homes above
300

02:11:26.790 --> 02:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
300
 
02:11:28.950 --> 02:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
000 they're starting to get there now
 
02:11:30.310 --> 02:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
because of
 
02:11:32.870 --> 02:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
the incredible demand for these things
 
02:11:34.550 --> 02:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
but there are
 
02:11:36.709 --> 02:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
not that many people that can afford to
 
02:11:38.470 --> 02:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
bid up that
 
02:11:41.109 --> 02:11:41.119 align:start position:0%
at that level whereas the house is above
 
02:11:41.119 --> 02:11:41.910 align:start position:0%
at that level whereas the house is above
600

02:11:41.910 --> 02:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
600
 
02:11:44.550 --> 02:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
000 uh the prices just keep going up and
 
02:11:46.470 --> 02:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
people keep paying them
 
02:11:49.270 --> 02:11:49.280 align:start position:0%
on but we don't have that many people
 
02:11:50.870 --> 02:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
with incomes that can
 
02:11:54.229 --> 02:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
do that except coming from out of state
 
02:11:54.239 --> 02:11:55.109 align:start position:0%
do that except coming from out of state
maybe

02:11:55.109 --> 02:11:55.119 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
02:11:57.189 --> 02:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
so i'd really love to see those out of
 
02:11:58.629 --> 02:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
state numbers
 
02:12:04.830 --> 02:12:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:07.750 --> 02:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
the if you go back to the
 
02:12:12.149 --> 02:12:12.159 align:start position:0%
slide that one right there
 
02:12:14.310 --> 02:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
that is what's going on now at a very
 
02:12:16.790 --> 02:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
steep right
 
02:12:20.149 --> 02:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
since the pandemic i know i mean you
 
02:12:22.149 --> 02:12:22.159 align:start position:0%
could easily buy a home
 
02:12:26.550 --> 02:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
in my area last year earlier last year
 
02:12:29.830 --> 02:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
before the pandemic for 250
 
02:12:32.830 --> 02:12:32.840 align:start position:0%
000. now you can't touch anything for
 
02:12:32.840 --> 02:12:35.350 align:start position:0%
000. now you can't touch anything for
350.

02:12:35.350 --> 02:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
350.
 
02:12:38.950 --> 02:12:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:43.030 --> 02:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:46.149 --> 02:12:46.159 align:start position:0%
and people that live in houses that they
 
02:12:48.390 --> 02:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
bought for 250 don't want to sell for
 
02:12:50.390 --> 02:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
350 because they can't no they won't be
 
02:12:51.910 --> 02:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
able to afford
 
02:12:58.390 --> 02:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:00.830 --> 02:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
i believe representative ulri was up
 
02:13:00.840 --> 02:13:02.229 align:start position:0%
i believe representative ulri was up
first

02:13:02.229 --> 02:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
first
 
02:13:06.709 --> 02:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
well i don't see his hand okay
 
02:13:07.990 --> 02:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
i must have been i must have been
 
02:13:09.750 --> 02:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
confused then um
 
02:13:11.669 --> 02:13:11.679 align:start position:0%
uh when we look at these these charts
 
02:13:13.669 --> 02:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
that have such a meteoric rise like this
 
02:13:15.030 --> 02:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
and we go back and we look over our
 
02:13:16.870 --> 02:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
history of the housing market
 
02:13:19.669 --> 02:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
isn't anybody afraid of a bubble going
 
02:13:19.679 --> 02:13:20.790 align:start position:0%
isn't anybody afraid of a bubble going
on

02:13:20.790 --> 02:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:13:23.990 --> 02:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
definitely because we're not talking
 
02:13:25.750 --> 02:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
about that and when we're looking at
 
02:13:28.229 --> 02:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
projections of revenues
 
02:13:29.990 --> 02:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
maybe we should think about that a
 
02:13:31.990 --> 02:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
02:13:34.229 --> 02:13:34.239 align:start position:0%
well it certainly looks like the dra
 
02:13:34.239 --> 02:13:35.030 align:start position:0%
well it certainly looks like the dra
does

02:13:35.030 --> 02:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
does
 
02:13:35.040 --> 02:13:39.189 align:start position:0%
does
so

02:13:39.189 --> 02:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:41.750 --> 02:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
you're right you've got to keep that in
 
02:13:41.760 --> 02:13:42.470 align:start position:0%
you're right you've got to keep that in
mind

02:13:42.470 --> 02:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
mind
 
02:13:45.510 --> 02:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
because that happens that happened but
 
02:13:47.030 --> 02:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
the 2008
 
02:13:53.669 --> 02:13:53.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:57.669 --> 02:13:57.679 align:start position:0%
uh representative anything else
 
02:14:00.550 --> 02:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
this no sir that was my comment thank
 
02:14:01.510 --> 02:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
02:14:03.830 --> 02:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
rather than early do you have your hand
 
02:14:03.840 --> 02:14:04.550 align:start position:0%
rather than early do you have your hand
up

02:14:04.550 --> 02:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
up
 
02:14:07.750 --> 02:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
oh i see yes i do
 
02:14:12.790 --> 02:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
no big deal um following up on what uh
 
02:14:14.870 --> 02:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
herschel had just said regarding the
 
02:14:16.470 --> 02:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
potential of a bubble let me tell you
 
02:14:18.950 --> 02:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
what's happening on the collection side
 
02:14:22.030 --> 02:14:22.040 align:start position:0%
of there's a horde of
 
02:14:25.350 --> 02:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
refinancing taking place uh from people
 
02:14:26.950 --> 02:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
who couldn't afford their original
 
02:14:27.830 --> 02:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
because the
 
02:14:29.589 --> 02:14:29.599 align:start position:0%
interest rates are so low but with the
 
02:14:32.629 --> 02:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
interest rates being so low
 
02:14:35.430 --> 02:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
more and more people are buying above
 
02:14:36.229 --> 02:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
their means
 
02:14:39.430 --> 02:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
like they did in 2008 and
 
02:14:42.550 --> 02:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
because of the new
 
02:14:47.189 --> 02:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
policy uh issued by the uh
 
02:14:50.229 --> 02:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
by the fed more and more people are
 
02:14:51.350 --> 02:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
going to qualify
 
02:14:53.350 --> 02:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
even though they can't afford even a
 
02:14:55.910 --> 02:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
modest two thousand or
 
02:14:58.550 --> 02:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
or three thousand dollar home modest
 
02:14:58.560 --> 02:14:59.030 align:start position:0%
or three thousand dollar home modest
three

02:14:59.030 --> 02:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
three
 
02:15:01.430 --> 02:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollar home give me a
 
02:15:01.440 --> 02:15:02.149 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollar home give me a
break

02:15:02.149 --> 02:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
break
 
02:15:06.629 --> 02:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
but i'm really concerned because i know
 
02:15:06.639 --> 02:15:07.189 align:start position:0%
but i'm really concerned because i know
that

02:15:07.189 --> 02:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:15:10.390 --> 02:15:10.400 align:start position:0%
my side the collection side has been
 
02:15:12.950 --> 02:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
relatively busy even throughout the
 
02:15:12.960 --> 02:15:14.149 align:start position:0%
relatively busy even throughout the
pandemic

02:15:14.149 --> 02:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
02:15:16.629 --> 02:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
with warnings of you know guys you got
 
02:15:18.310 --> 02:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
to pay attention to what's happening
 
02:15:22.069 --> 02:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
this will end at some time and the
 
02:15:23.669 --> 02:15:23.679 align:start position:0%
number of people i'm visiting
 
02:15:26.950 --> 02:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire is really
 
02:15:30.790 --> 02:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
large so just following up on what
 
02:15:32.950 --> 02:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
representative nunes had to say thank
 
02:15:36.870 --> 02:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
you sir
 
02:15:39.109 --> 02:15:39.119 align:start position:0%
other members of the committee takes
 
02:15:40.790 --> 02:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
that warning from you
 
02:15:44.149 --> 02:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
nunes and the dra
 
02:15:44.159 --> 02:15:47.189 align:start position:0%
nunes and the dra
representative

02:15:47.189 --> 02:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:50.229 --> 02:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
thank you on what uh
 
02:15:53.910 --> 02:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
representative willary said on remind
 
02:15:56.069 --> 02:15:56.079 align:start position:0%
reminded me we really ought to try and
 
02:15:58.149 --> 02:15:58.159 align:start position:0%
get some information on how many of
 
02:15:58.159 --> 02:15:59.030 align:start position:0%
get some information on how many of
these

02:15:59.030 --> 02:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:16:02.310 --> 02:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
are refinancings are
 
02:16:05.750 --> 02:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
or how many mortgages are fixed
 
02:16:09.109 --> 02:16:09.119 align:start position:0%
rate versus negotiable because if
 
02:16:10.470 --> 02:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
they're fixed rate
 
02:16:12.870 --> 02:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
these people probably will be able to
 
02:16:14.310 --> 02:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
continue to afford
 
02:16:16.470 --> 02:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
but if they're negotiable they're going
 
02:16:22.149 --> 02:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:22.159 --> 02:16:26.229 align:start position:0%
 
representation

02:16:26.229 --> 02:16:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:28.470 --> 02:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i agree with
 
02:16:28.480 --> 02:16:29.430 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i agree with
what

02:16:29.430 --> 02:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:16:31.270 --> 02:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
representative almy just said i was
 
02:16:32.709 --> 02:16:32.719 align:start position:0%
thinking the same thing that
 
02:16:34.870 --> 02:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
if they're locked into 30 years or 25
 
02:16:36.070 --> 02:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
years whatever their term
 
02:16:39.030 --> 02:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
is it's it's less likely to create a
 
02:16:39.040 --> 02:16:39.429 align:start position:0%
is it's it's less likely to create a
problem

02:16:39.429 --> 02:16:39.439 align:start position:0%
problem
 
02:16:43.030 --> 02:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
one of the problems in 2008 uh was that
 
02:16:43.750 --> 02:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
there's several
 
02:16:45.509 --> 02:16:45.519 align:start position:0%
there were several things going on then
 
02:16:46.790 --> 02:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
that aren't going on now
 
02:16:49.750 --> 02:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
at least not yet one is interest only
 
02:16:49.760 --> 02:16:50.549 align:start position:0%
at least not yet one is interest only
loans

02:16:50.549 --> 02:16:50.559 align:start position:0%
loans
 
02:16:52.870 --> 02:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
which totally you know people would pay
 
02:16:55.270 --> 02:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
just the interest for five years or so
 
02:16:56.549 --> 02:16:56.559 align:start position:0%
and then all of a sudden they'd be hit
 
02:16:58.709 --> 02:16:58.719 align:start position:0%
with the real mortgage
 
02:17:00.549 --> 02:17:00.559 align:start position:0%
and and sadly wouldn't be able to afford
 
02:17:02.469 --> 02:17:02.479 align:start position:0%
it so you had interest only loans
 
02:17:05.750 --> 02:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
you had um something called undocumented
 
02:17:05.760 --> 02:17:06.549 align:start position:0%
you had um something called undocumented
loans

02:17:06.549 --> 02:17:06.559 align:start position:0%
loans
 
02:17:07.750 --> 02:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
where they basically you could get a
 
02:17:10.070 --> 02:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
loan based on a credit score
 
02:17:12.790 --> 02:17:12.800 align:start position:0%
um there's so all the there's and
 
02:17:14.389 --> 02:17:14.399 align:start position:0%
there's other factors that just made it
 
02:17:15.990 --> 02:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
so easy to get a loan
 
02:17:17.990 --> 02:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
so even though prices are up people are
 
02:17:20.549 --> 02:17:20.559 align:start position:0%
paying maybe they're paying too much
 
02:17:22.150 --> 02:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
but i don't think it's quite the same
 
02:17:23.589 --> 02:17:23.599 align:start position:0%
bubble at this point
 
02:17:26.790 --> 02:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
because it is more it is more stable
 
02:17:28.150 --> 02:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
it's not to say it's not a bubble but
 
02:17:29.990 --> 02:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
it's not as bad a type of bubble as we
 
02:17:31.910 --> 02:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
had in 2008 for the reasons i just
 
02:17:31.920 --> 02:17:32.950 align:start position:0%
had in 2008 for the reasons i just
mentioned

02:17:32.950 --> 02:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
02:17:36.389 --> 02:17:36.399 align:start position:0%
and one other reason we didn't mention
 
02:17:39.429 --> 02:17:39.439 align:start position:0%
was the variable rate loans
 
02:17:45.509 --> 02:17:45.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:48.790 --> 02:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
representative spellsbury yeah uh
 
02:17:50.790 --> 02:17:50.800 align:start position:0%
representative gennadian's point i think
 
02:17:53.750 --> 02:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
is absolutely right on the money
 
02:17:57.190 --> 02:17:57.200 align:start position:0%
but the other element is the
 
02:18:00.709 --> 02:18:00.719 align:start position:0%
fallout of 2008 was reaper
 
02:18:03.910 --> 02:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
repercussions for developments that were
 
02:18:05.910 --> 02:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
accumulating over five to ten years or
 
02:18:05.920 --> 02:18:07.270 align:start position:0%
accumulating over five to ten years or
more

02:18:07.270 --> 02:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:18:09.190 --> 02:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
and they were all based on loose credit
 
02:18:09.200 --> 02:18:10.709 align:start position:0%
and they were all based on loose credit
criteria

02:18:10.709 --> 02:18:10.719 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
02:18:12.870 --> 02:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
and this current environment is based on
 
02:18:16.389 --> 02:18:16.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:19.589 --> 02:18:19.599 align:start position:0%
okay it represented do you
 
02:18:22.070 --> 02:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
have your hand up or yeah the the
 
02:18:23.830 --> 02:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
refinancing that
 
02:18:26.950 --> 02:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
i'm participating in is for a fixed rate
 
02:18:26.960 --> 02:18:27.270 align:start position:0%
i'm participating in is for a fixed rate
and

02:18:27.270 --> 02:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:18:29.910 --> 02:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh there are some some of them are
 
02:18:29.920 --> 02:18:30.629 align:start position:0%
uh there are some some of them are
exceeding

02:18:30.629 --> 02:18:30.639 align:start position:0%
exceeding
 
02:18:33.509 --> 02:18:33.519 align:start position:0%
the 30-year because of the flexibility
 
02:18:35.030 --> 02:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
that the pandemic has allowed but
 
02:18:36.549 --> 02:18:36.559 align:start position:0%
they're all fixed rate and they're all
 
02:18:36.559 --> 02:18:37.830 align:start position:0%
they're all fixed rate and they're all
from

02:18:37.830 --> 02:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:18:40.870 --> 02:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh lenders your your loan depot etc
 
02:18:44.389 --> 02:18:44.399 align:start position:0%
uh that's only one uh there's
 
02:18:47.190 --> 02:18:47.200 align:start position:0%
about half a dozen of real subprime
 
02:18:49.509 --> 02:18:49.519 align:start position:0%
dealers that work in this market
 
02:18:52.230 --> 02:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
that uh have a huge number of holdings
 
02:18:53.990 --> 02:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
and they're backed by the larger banks
 
02:18:58.070 --> 02:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:02.230 --> 02:19:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:05.110 --> 02:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
well yes and no what they what they
 
02:19:07.669 --> 02:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
learned from 2008 was
 
02:19:10.709 --> 02:19:10.719 align:start position:0%
the we don't need to hold these we'll
 
02:19:10.719 --> 02:19:11.750 align:start position:0%
the we don't need to hold these we'll
create

02:19:11.750 --> 02:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
create
 
02:19:14.709 --> 02:19:14.719 align:start position:0%
a company that is set up to fail to hold
 
02:19:14.719 --> 02:19:16.389 align:start position:0%
a company that is set up to fail to hold
these

02:19:16.389 --> 02:19:16.399 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:19:17.910 --> 02:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
and then they sell them amongst the
 
02:19:20.150 --> 02:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
banks that are going to fail that are
 
02:19:21.910 --> 02:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
set up to fail to isolate
 
02:19:24.549 --> 02:19:24.559 align:start position:0%
the primary bank that is that is uh
 
02:19:24.559 --> 02:19:25.429 align:start position:0%
the primary bank that is that is uh
backing

02:19:25.429 --> 02:19:25.439 align:start position:0%
backing
 
02:19:29.030 --> 02:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh the initial um loan and
 
02:19:31.429 --> 02:19:31.439 align:start position:0%
quite honestly um they're pushing to get
 
02:19:33.270 --> 02:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
these things paid
 
02:19:36.629 --> 02:19:36.639 align:start position:0%
and a lot of people are very happy to
 
02:19:39.669 --> 02:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
you know get a a three percent loan
 
02:19:42.070 --> 02:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
uh when they had a five percent subprime
 
02:19:43.589 --> 02:19:43.599 align:start position:0%
loan and
 
02:19:46.070 --> 02:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
that's where the issue is going
 
02:19:46.080 --> 02:19:46.950 align:start position:0%
that's where the issue is going
regarding

02:19:46.950 --> 02:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
02:19:49.830 --> 02:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
building a bubble is that they're still
 
02:19:52.230 --> 02:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
giving this extra money out
 
02:19:54.150 --> 02:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
but then and that money is not going to
 
02:19:56.469 --> 02:19:56.479 align:start position:0%
affect the banks i don't believe
 
02:19:59.270 --> 02:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
as much as it will affect the entire uh
 
02:20:01.349 --> 02:20:01.359 align:start position:0%
structure of the subprime
 
02:20:04.550 --> 02:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
banks that are going to
 
02:20:07.030 --> 02:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
suffer the stings and arrows of no money
 
02:20:12.389 --> 02:20:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:14.870 --> 02:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
representative spillsberry just one
 
02:20:17.110 --> 02:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
further observation in my part of
 
02:20:20.469 --> 02:20:20.479 align:start position:0%
uh the state uh real estate values have
 
02:20:21.910 --> 02:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
still not recovered
 
02:20:24.230 --> 02:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
the levels that they were at at 2008 and
 
02:20:24.240 --> 02:20:27.429 align:start position:0%
the levels that they were at at 2008 and
before

02:20:27.429 --> 02:20:27.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:28.950 --> 02:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
you know i don't remember what part of
 
02:20:32.150 --> 02:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:34.469 --> 02:20:34.479 align:start position:0%
uh i'm in charlestown connecticut river
 
02:20:34.479 --> 02:20:35.349 align:start position:0%
uh i'm in charlestown connecticut river
valley

02:20:35.349 --> 02:20:35.359 align:start position:0%
valley
 
02:20:38.070 --> 02:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
about halfway between keene and lebanon
 
02:20:39.429 --> 02:20:39.439 align:start position:0%
you know where it is i just didn't know
 
02:20:39.439 --> 02:20:40.469 align:start position:0%
you know where it is i just didn't know
where

02:20:40.469 --> 02:20:40.479 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:20:42.710 --> 02:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
you live yeah it's uh it's still a very
 
02:20:44.630 --> 02:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
weak market here so
 
02:20:48.389 --> 02:20:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:50.070 --> 02:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to let anyone go from the
 
02:20:52.469 --> 02:20:52.479 align:start position:0%
north country
 
02:20:54.950 --> 02:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
i'm glad you asked that question
 
02:20:54.960 --> 02:20:56.830 align:start position:0%
i'm glad you asked that question
representative

02:20:56.830 --> 02:20:56.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:20:56.840 --> 02:20:59.990 align:start position:0%
representative
tucker

02:20:59.990 --> 02:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:02.070 --> 02:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
further questions or comments on the
 
02:21:03.990 --> 02:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
real estate
 
02:21:13.670 --> 02:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
so that's definitely a hold
 
02:21:18.150 --> 02:21:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:21.990 --> 02:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
yeah um this has been an interesting
 
02:21:23.110 --> 02:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
discussion and
 
02:21:26.550 --> 02:21:26.560 align:start position:0%
serious issues have been raised around
 
02:21:29.190 --> 02:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
perhaps some kind of bubble phenomenon
 
02:21:30.870 --> 02:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
that's very different from
 
02:21:33.990 --> 02:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
the prior disastrous bubble
 
02:21:37.270 --> 02:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
that we had so
 
02:21:39.590 --> 02:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
i don't know whether this is going to be
 
02:21:41.429 --> 02:21:41.439 align:start position:0%
problematic but certainly serious
 
02:21:42.710 --> 02:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
questions have been raised and
 
02:21:45.750 --> 02:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
i hope that we'll be getting in
 
02:21:47.429 --> 02:21:47.439 align:start position:0%
somebody new new hampshire housing
 
02:21:49.030 --> 02:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
finance authority maybe
 
02:21:54.070 --> 02:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
best to speak to these questions
 
02:21:57.670 --> 02:21:57.680 align:start position:0%
we will and i'm going to try to do that
 
02:21:57.680 --> 02:21:57.990 align:start position:0%
we will and i'm going to try to do that
so

02:21:57.990 --> 02:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:22:02.389 --> 02:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
before the 23rd good thank you
 
02:22:05.510 --> 02:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative yes i think
 
02:22:08.070 --> 02:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
that maybe dean christian would be the
 
02:22:08.080 --> 02:22:08.710 align:start position:0%
that maybe dean christian would be the
best

02:22:08.710 --> 02:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
best
 
02:22:11.830 --> 02:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
for this discussion of
 
02:22:14.630 --> 02:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
is is there a bubble forming i think
 
02:22:14.640 --> 02:22:15.590 align:start position:0%
is is there a bubble forming i think
would

02:22:15.590 --> 02:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:22:19.030 --> 02:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
probably uh
 
02:22:20.870 --> 02:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
if we've talked about a lot of different
 
02:22:23.270 --> 02:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
angles of this
 
02:22:26.309 --> 02:22:26.319 align:start position:0%
but or if if mr
 
02:22:31.590 --> 02:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:34.630 --> 02:22:34.640 align:start position:0%
and been keeping up
 
02:22:39.590 --> 02:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:45.349 --> 02:22:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:48.389 --> 02:22:48.399 align:start position:0%
okay why don't we go to if we do
 
02:22:59.670 --> 02:22:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:01.910 --> 02:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
and if you could put that up on the
 
02:23:01.920 --> 02:23:02.950 align:start position:0%
and if you could put that up on the
screen

02:23:02.950 --> 02:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
screen
 
02:23:02.960 --> 02:23:34.309 align:start position:0%
screen
yep

02:23:34.309 --> 02:23:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:39.429 --> 02:23:39.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:50.870 --> 02:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:54.790 --> 02:23:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:04.230 --> 02:24:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:07.510 --> 02:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
are you not seeing my screen yes
 
02:24:11.190 --> 02:24:11.200 align:start position:0%
yeah i just had to move my um
 
02:24:12.950 --> 02:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
participant screen because it was
 
02:24:12.960 --> 02:24:14.950 align:start position:0%
participant screen because it was
blocking

02:24:14.950 --> 02:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
blocking
 
02:24:18.309 --> 02:24:18.319 align:start position:0%
the titles so i just moved on to the dra
 
02:24:20.469 --> 02:24:20.479 align:start position:0%
high and low estimate sheet and i got
 
02:24:21.670 --> 02:24:21.680 align:start position:0%
the tobacco tax
 
02:24:23.349 --> 02:24:23.359 align:start position:0%
highlighted and you can see the percent
 
02:24:26.830 --> 02:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
changes in 22 23 compared to
 
02:24:26.840 --> 02:24:34.710 align:start position:0%
changes in 22 23 compared to
21.

02:24:34.710 --> 02:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:38.550 --> 02:24:38.560 align:start position:0%
any questions or comments mr chairman
 
02:24:41.590 --> 02:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
on starting from
 
02:24:45.030 --> 02:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
the there are a couple of issues that
 
02:24:48.309 --> 02:24:48.319 align:start position:0%
we've got to deal with i think from the
 
02:24:51.429 --> 02:24:51.439 align:start position:0%
vaping side do we have any
 
02:24:55.270 --> 02:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
data on how much vaping is still
 
02:24:58.630 --> 02:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
going on in in the
 
02:25:03.750 --> 02:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:06.550 --> 02:25:06.560 align:start position:0%
the vaping tax is extremely low so i'm
 
02:25:07.990 --> 02:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
not sure
 
02:25:10.070 --> 02:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
if they if they gave us the data for
 
02:25:11.830 --> 02:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
that we could see but
 
02:25:13.510 --> 02:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
because that is one of the things that
 
02:25:15.349 --> 02:25:15.359 align:start position:0%
we thought would be reducing
 
02:25:18.550 --> 02:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
the amount of smoke normal smoking which
 
02:25:20.389 --> 02:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
has a normal cigarette tax
 
02:25:24.469 --> 02:25:24.479 align:start position:0%
attached to it um and then
 
02:25:27.349 --> 02:25:27.359 align:start position:0%
the second thing is the menthol
 
02:25:28.710 --> 02:25:28.720 align:start position:0%
cigarettes and
 
02:25:33.270 --> 02:25:33.280 align:start position:0%
where massachusetts seems to be going
 
02:25:36.710 --> 02:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
with that if we're going to to actually
 
02:25:37.590 --> 02:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
lose that
 
02:25:42.070 --> 02:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
or not and what percentage
 
02:25:45.190 --> 02:25:45.200 align:start position:0%
of the of the increase
 
02:25:48.230 --> 02:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
we've seen uh
 
02:25:51.990 --> 02:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
is actually uh
 
02:25:55.030 --> 02:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
at risk from them going back to buying
 
02:25:55.510 --> 02:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
it in
 
02:25:57.990 --> 02:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
massachusetts we never had a really good
 
02:26:00.150 --> 02:26:00.160 align:start position:0%
idea and i don't know if we can get one
 
02:26:03.190 --> 02:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
of on how many of the people who were
 
02:26:05.349 --> 02:26:05.359 align:start position:0%
smoking menthol were already coming to
 
02:26:07.429 --> 02:26:07.439 align:start position:0%
new hampshire from massachusetts to buy
 
02:26:08.950 --> 02:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
cigarettes because our cigarettes are
 
02:26:08.960 --> 02:26:11.830 align:start position:0%
cigarettes because our cigarettes are
cheaper

02:26:11.830 --> 02:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:14.469 --> 02:26:14.479 align:start position:0%
and and then the third of course is the
 
02:26:14.479 --> 02:26:15.830 align:start position:0%
and and then the third of course is the
addiction

02:26:15.830 --> 02:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
addiction
 
02:26:20.790 --> 02:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
uh i don't know if we could find out if
 
02:26:22.790 --> 02:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
the medical profession has some kind of
 
02:26:24.230 --> 02:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
handle or
 
02:26:27.270 --> 02:26:27.280 align:start position:0%
tobacco-free kids or somebody has the
 
02:26:29.349 --> 02:26:29.359 align:start position:0%
cancer society has some kind of handle
 
02:26:31.750 --> 02:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
on what's happening during the
 
02:26:34.790 --> 02:26:34.800 align:start position:0%
pandemic have people on going
 
02:26:38.389 --> 02:26:38.399 align:start position:0%
back slid to produce
 
02:26:42.309 --> 02:26:42.319 align:start position:0%
this increase that we've had for
 
02:26:44.389 --> 02:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
for the new people the tobacco tax has
 
02:26:46.309 --> 02:26:46.319 align:start position:0%
always been going down because people
 
02:26:47.590 --> 02:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
have been
 
02:26:51.190 --> 02:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
moving to to vaping or they've been
 
02:26:51.200 --> 02:26:51.830 align:start position:0%
moving to to vaping or they've been
moving

02:26:51.830 --> 02:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
moving
 
02:26:58.550 --> 02:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:02.469 --> 02:27:02.479 align:start position:0%
chris on the uh other
 
02:27:04.630 --> 02:27:04.640 align:start position:0%
tobacco products that's about six
 
02:27:06.389 --> 02:27:06.399 align:start position:0%
percent of the total
 
02:27:09.510 --> 02:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
tobacco revenue is
 
02:27:12.150 --> 02:27:12.160 align:start position:0%
um let me pull the dra presentation they
 
02:27:13.110 --> 02:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
might have a
 
02:27:18.870 --> 02:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:21.510 --> 02:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
vaping is part of the other tobacco
 
02:27:25.030 --> 02:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:28.070 --> 02:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:31.830 --> 02:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
yes if that is six percent
 
02:27:36.469 --> 02:27:36.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:40.469 --> 02:27:40.479 align:start position:0%
other type of tobacco products and they
 
02:27:52.230 --> 02:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:55.670 --> 02:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
i don't think we were given on
 
02:27:58.230 --> 02:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
any breakdown of the different kinds of
 
02:28:00.150 --> 02:28:00.160 align:start position:0%
other tobacco products
 
02:28:01.750 --> 02:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
there's only they must have it for
 
02:28:03.830 --> 02:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
vaping but i'm not sure they have it for
 
02:28:04.710 --> 02:28:04.720 align:start position:0%
the rest
 
02:28:07.510 --> 02:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
i just looked at the presentation and i
 
02:28:11.030 --> 02:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:15.110 --> 02:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
so do you see my um
 
02:28:18.389 --> 02:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
screen yes so the other tobacco products
 
02:28:19.270 --> 02:28:19.280 align:start position:0%
are six percent
 
02:28:21.990 --> 02:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
on that pie chart they showed you all
 
02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:22.550 align:start position:0%
on that pie chart they showed you all
right

02:28:22.550 --> 02:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:28:26.790 --> 02:28:26.800 align:start position:0%
do we have any idea of them
 
02:28:29.429 --> 02:28:29.439 align:start position:0%
percentages that like vaping make up of
 
02:28:29.439 --> 02:28:31.349 align:start position:0%
percentages that like vaping make up of
that

02:28:31.349 --> 02:28:31.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:28:31.359 --> 02:28:37.590 align:start position:0%
that
no

02:28:37.590 --> 02:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:40.550 --> 02:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
mr chairman could we might be able to
 
02:28:41.990 --> 02:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
get some information
 
02:28:45.030 --> 02:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
out of the anti-cancer coalition
 
02:28:50.469 --> 02:28:50.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:53.590 --> 02:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
i could try and and
 
02:28:56.550 --> 02:28:56.560 align:start position:0%
contact them and see if if they think
 
02:28:59.030 --> 02:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
they have something it would only
 
02:29:02.550 --> 02:29:02.560 align:start position:0%
they they work from surveys in schools
 
02:29:06.070 --> 02:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
and uh usually
 
02:29:08.309 --> 02:29:08.319 align:start position:0%
uh their their information on children
 
02:29:13.590 --> 02:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:15.910 --> 02:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
see what you can get because i'd like to
 
02:29:15.920 --> 02:29:18.070 align:start position:0%
see what you can get because i'd like to
see

02:29:18.070 --> 02:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
see
 
02:29:23.349 --> 02:29:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:26.469 --> 02:29:26.479 align:start position:0%
two types of tax on it is
 
02:29:29.270 --> 02:29:29.280 align:start position:0%
how much have we been collecting and how
 
02:29:33.990 --> 02:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:36.550 --> 02:29:36.560 align:start position:0%
representative tucker yes i just wanted
 
02:29:39.670 --> 02:29:39.680 align:start position:0%
to make a comment about the mentholated
 
02:29:43.670 --> 02:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh sales and i i personally don't think
 
02:29:46.630 --> 02:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
that massachusetts will reverse itself
 
02:29:50.950 --> 02:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
because the they're two groups of people
 
02:29:53.670 --> 02:29:53.680 align:start position:0%
primarily apparently that buy
 
02:29:55.349 --> 02:29:55.359 align:start position:0%
mentholated cigarettes
 
02:29:59.910 --> 02:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
it's youth who sort of cover up their
 
02:30:03.030 --> 02:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
early dislike of what actually
 
02:30:05.830 --> 02:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
smoking feels like because the
 
02:30:07.510 --> 02:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
mentholated makes it less
 
02:30:10.710 --> 02:30:10.720 align:start position:0%
harsh and then there's a very political
 
02:30:10.720 --> 02:30:11.349 align:start position:0%
harsh and then there's a very political
issue

02:30:11.349 --> 02:30:11.359 align:start position:0%
issue
 
02:30:16.230 --> 02:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
of that the black and brown populations
 
02:30:20.070 --> 02:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
are drawn to and targeted as
 
02:30:23.429 --> 02:30:23.439 align:start position:0%
the people who are
 
02:30:27.830 --> 02:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
being asked to buy the advertising
 
02:30:31.429 --> 02:30:31.439 align:start position:0%
and the work of the tobacco companies is
 
02:30:35.030 --> 02:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
to have black and brown populations
 
02:30:37.750 --> 02:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
go towards mentholated cigarettes and
 
02:30:39.990 --> 02:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
that's a very political issue
 
02:30:43.030 --> 02:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
that quite frankly doesn't exist in
 
02:30:45.110 --> 02:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire but it certainly does in
 
02:30:47.670 --> 02:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
massachusetts so i personally
 
02:30:51.670 --> 02:30:51.680 align:start position:0%
uh no particular expertise but i don't
 
02:30:55.110 --> 02:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
believe that massachusetts will make it
 
02:30:57.429 --> 02:30:57.439 align:start position:0%
possible to buy mentholated cigarettes
 
02:31:00.389 --> 02:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
in massachusetts because of the
 
02:31:02.389 --> 02:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
particular populations that are being
 
02:31:02.399 --> 02:31:03.910 align:start position:0%
particular populations that are being
targeted

02:31:03.910 --> 02:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
targeted
 
02:31:06.309 --> 02:31:06.319 align:start position:0%
and i think it's unfortunate that new
 
02:31:06.319 --> 02:31:07.750 align:start position:0%
and i think it's unfortunate that new
hampshire

02:31:07.750 --> 02:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:31:12.469 --> 02:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:14.630 --> 02:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
we hadn't counted on them it was a nice
 
02:31:16.870 --> 02:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
surprise though
 
02:31:22.309 --> 02:31:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:25.349 --> 02:31:25.359 align:start position:0%
i don't i there's nothing more to say
 
02:31:26.790 --> 02:31:26.800 align:start position:0%
it's just unfortunate
 
02:31:30.309 --> 02:31:30.319 align:start position:0%
okay representative romney yeah the
 
02:31:33.030 --> 02:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
two things um okay let's make sure
 
02:31:33.990 --> 02:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
microphone was off
 
02:31:37.590 --> 02:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
i was on um yeah two things uh the
 
02:31:41.030 --> 02:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh on the mental cigarettes uh
 
02:31:43.990 --> 02:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
whether something is going to change in
 
02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:45.349 align:start position:0%
whether something is going to change in
massachusetts

02:31:45.349 --> 02:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
02:31:48.070 --> 02:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
we can have research take a look at any
 
02:31:49.110 --> 02:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
they can quickly
 
02:31:50.950 --> 02:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
review bills that have been filed in
 
02:31:53.030 --> 02:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
massachusetts at least in the short run
 
02:31:56.150 --> 02:31:56.160 align:start position:0%
to see if there's any movement there
 
02:31:57.429 --> 02:31:57.439 align:start position:0%
whether it's jennifer or just use
 
02:31:59.429 --> 02:31:59.439 align:start position:0%
regular the research office to
 
02:32:03.670 --> 02:32:03.680 align:start position:0%
to do that for us to reverse this mental
 
02:32:06.790 --> 02:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
tax uh because i'm sure they've noticed
 
02:32:06.800 --> 02:32:08.710 align:start position:0%
tax uh because i'm sure they've noticed
they've

02:32:08.710 --> 02:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
they've
 
02:32:10.710 --> 02:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
that the taxes went down quite a bit for
 
02:32:12.070 --> 02:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
them but again massachusetts is much
 
02:32:13.110 --> 02:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
bigger than us so
 
02:32:16.870 --> 02:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
may not be as big a deal so um
 
02:32:18.790 --> 02:32:18.800 align:start position:0%
that was that and then in terms of the
 
02:32:20.469 --> 02:32:20.479 align:start position:0%
their projections
 
02:32:23.270 --> 02:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
dra i mean clearly it was a step
 
02:32:23.280 --> 02:32:23.750 align:start position:0%
dra i mean clearly it was a step
function

02:32:23.750 --> 02:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
function
 
02:32:26.150 --> 02:32:26.160 align:start position:0%
with menthol cigarettes i think none of
 
02:32:27.429 --> 02:32:27.439 align:start position:0%
us are going to debate that that that
 
02:32:27.439 --> 02:32:28.550 align:start position:0%
us are going to debate that that that
occurred

02:32:28.550 --> 02:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
occurred
 
02:32:30.550 --> 02:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
and then from that point which really
 
02:32:31.590 --> 02:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
changed our base up
 
02:32:35.030 --> 02:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
quite a bit maybe by you know 40 million
 
02:32:36.469 --> 02:32:36.479 align:start position:0%
or something
 
02:32:38.710 --> 02:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
but we've with the rh projecting out
 
02:32:38.720 --> 02:32:40.150 align:start position:0%
but we've with the rh projecting out
years

02:32:40.150 --> 02:32:40.160 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:32:43.270 --> 02:32:43.280 align:start position:0%
uh 22 and 23
 
02:32:45.429 --> 02:32:45.439 align:start position:0%
as slight reductions from that uh
 
02:32:46.710 --> 02:32:46.720 align:start position:0%
continuing their
 
02:32:49.110 --> 02:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
the the normal reduction in the amount
 
02:32:51.190 --> 02:32:51.200 align:start position:0%
of cigarette smoking that is going on
 
02:32:54.710 --> 02:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
uh in our state as well as nationally so
 
02:32:56.550 --> 02:32:56.560 align:start position:0%
i'm comfortable with the numbers here i
 
02:32:58.870 --> 02:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
mean i i have no problem waiting
 
02:33:01.750 --> 02:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh to vote on all of the tobacco of the
 
02:33:04.710 --> 02:33:04.720 align:start position:0%
dra revenues in one at one time
 
02:33:07.510 --> 02:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
but uh but i i think i don't think we're
 
02:33:08.309 --> 02:33:08.319 align:start position:0%
going to change
 
02:33:10.870 --> 02:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
much that's here in terms of the way
 
02:33:12.230 --> 02:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
they've estimated
 
02:33:13.990 --> 02:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
unless we find that some other variable
 
02:33:16.309 --> 02:33:16.319 align:start position:0%
that we we missed
 
02:33:19.349 --> 02:33:19.359 align:start position:0%
so uh i'm willing to reach out unless
 
02:33:20.630 --> 02:33:20.640 align:start position:0%
chris wants to do it
 
02:33:23.910 --> 02:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
i can reach out to jennifer to see if
 
02:33:26.070 --> 02:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
massachusetts is anything in the hopper
 
02:33:27.110 --> 02:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
that would
 
02:33:29.590 --> 02:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
reverse their policy on this or their
 
02:33:31.349 --> 02:33:31.359 align:start position:0%
statutes on this
 
02:33:34.309 --> 02:33:34.319 align:start position:0%
uh if you want me to do that mr why
 
02:33:35.750 --> 02:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
don't you
 
02:33:41.670 --> 02:33:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:41.680 --> 02:33:46.070 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:33:46.070 --> 02:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:50.950 --> 02:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:53.510 --> 02:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
representative spellsbury followed by
 
02:33:54.950 --> 02:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
representative bernstein
 
02:33:58.389 --> 02:33:58.399 align:start position:0%
and mr chairman i believe representative
 
02:34:00.630 --> 02:34:00.640 align:start position:0%
chenegan was before me
 
02:34:03.270 --> 02:34:03.280 align:start position:0%
i don't know what what happens here
 
02:34:04.309 --> 02:34:04.319 align:start position:0%
there's supposed to be an
 
02:34:07.030 --> 02:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
order and he was on the top but then
 
02:34:08.710 --> 02:34:08.720 align:start position:0%
i'll keep it brief
 
02:34:12.070 --> 02:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
i just let me keep track representative
 
02:34:12.080 --> 02:34:12.870 align:start position:0%
i just let me keep track representative
major

02:34:12.870 --> 02:34:12.880 align:start position:0%
major
 
02:34:16.150 --> 02:34:16.160 align:start position:0%
yes okay uh simple observation
 
02:34:18.710 --> 02:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
might take away from the testimony last
 
02:34:18.720 --> 02:34:19.990 align:start position:0%
might take away from the testimony last
week

02:34:19.990 --> 02:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
week
 
02:34:22.870 --> 02:34:22.880 align:start position:0%
was that they would have predicted or
 
02:34:25.990 --> 02:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
forecast a three to six percent decline
 
02:34:28.550 --> 02:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
but because of the surprise the
 
02:34:30.550 --> 02:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
massachusetts rub off
 
02:34:34.309 --> 02:34:34.319 align:start position:0%
their zero to three percent down so
 
02:34:36.950 --> 02:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
computing it that pleasant surprise is
 
02:34:42.550 --> 02:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:47.270 --> 02:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
sounds good uh who's the next
 
02:34:49.910 --> 02:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
one on the list i believe representative
 
02:34:49.920 --> 02:34:52.710 align:start position:0%
one on the list i believe representative
burstein

02:34:52.710 --> 02:34:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:54.630 --> 02:34:54.640 align:start position:0%
thank you uh just in response to
 
02:34:56.630 --> 02:34:56.640 align:start position:0%
representative abrami's question
 
02:35:00.150 --> 02:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
there is an act in the um
 
02:35:03.429 --> 02:35:03.439 align:start position:0%
in the massachusetts senate to repeal
 
02:35:06.469 --> 02:35:06.479 align:start position:0%
the prohibition of menthol cigarettes
 
02:35:08.790 --> 02:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
that's significant that's significant
 
02:35:10.630 --> 02:35:10.640 align:start position:0%
that statement
 
02:35:12.710 --> 02:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
yeah i i would much rather see new
 
02:35:14.710 --> 02:35:14.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire send lobbyists
 
02:35:18.309 --> 02:35:18.319 align:start position:0%
to maine and vermont get them to pass a
 
02:35:19.990 --> 02:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
similar ban
 
02:35:21.510 --> 02:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
anyway i i still think you should have
 
02:35:23.270 --> 02:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
jennifer look into it uh
 
02:35:24.630 --> 02:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
maybe she can find some other
 
02:35:26.630 --> 02:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
information about it that's all i got
 
02:35:30.630 --> 02:35:30.640 align:start position:0%
thanks and how does the speaker feel
 
02:35:33.270 --> 02:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:35.830 --> 02:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
because it's they act differently than
 
02:35:36.950 --> 02:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
02:35:39.110 --> 02:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
everything in new hampshire all the
 
02:35:41.110 --> 02:35:41.120 align:start position:0%
bills have to go to the floor
 
02:35:44.150 --> 02:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
but in other states if a speaker
 
02:35:46.469 --> 02:35:46.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't care for it it never sees the
 
02:35:48.300 --> 02:35:48.310 align:start position:0%
way today
 
02:35:48.310 --> 02:35:49.510 align:start position:0%
way today

02:35:49.510 --> 02:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:35:53.670 --> 02:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:57.910 --> 02:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
senate village uh bill xce 554
 
02:36:01.910 --> 02:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:05.030 --> 02:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
it probably is the senator probably
 
02:36:06.469 --> 02:36:06.479 align:start position:0%
would not have put it in
 
02:36:15.190 --> 02:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:20.230 --> 02:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:21.910 --> 02:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
yes i was just wondering general
 
02:36:23.750 --> 02:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
question the six percent
 
02:36:27.190 --> 02:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
other in the um tobacco chart uh pie
 
02:36:28.550 --> 02:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
chart there
 
02:36:30.630 --> 02:36:30.640 align:start position:0%
do we have any information on how that
 
02:36:32.309 --> 02:36:32.319 align:start position:0%
is that six percent
 
02:36:34.230 --> 02:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
is that number growing is the other
 
02:36:36.950 --> 02:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
number growing i guess is the question
 
02:36:41.429 --> 02:36:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:43.190 --> 02:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
it was the pie chart with the six
 
02:36:44.630 --> 02:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
percent other
 
02:36:46.710 --> 02:36:46.720 align:start position:0%
yep so i just put i'm putting up the bar
 
02:36:48.630 --> 02:36:48.640 align:start position:0%
chart so this is their other tobacco
 
02:36:50.309 --> 02:36:50.319 align:start position:0%
products and you can see
 
02:36:51.830 --> 02:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
the rates that have been associated with
 
02:36:53.830 --> 02:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
that and then where
 
02:36:55.910 --> 02:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
the the bar is going over the last few
 
02:36:55.920 --> 02:36:57.190 align:start position:0%
the the bar is going over the last few
years

02:36:57.190 --> 02:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:36:59.710 --> 02:36:59.720 align:start position:0%
so since 14 the rate has been at the
 
02:37:01.590 --> 02:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
65.03 percent
 
02:37:03.270 --> 02:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
and you can see it it's trending
 
02:37:07.910 --> 02:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:11.110 --> 02:37:11.120 align:start position:0%
so it accounts for you know about back
 
02:37:11.120 --> 02:37:11.510 align:start position:0%
so it accounts for you know about back
in

02:37:11.510 --> 02:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:37:13.429 --> 02:37:13.439 align:start position:0%
16 it was just over 10 million and now
 
02:37:15.830 --> 02:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
it's just over 16 million of the
 
02:37:20.230 --> 02:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
the total pie of your um tobacco
 
02:37:23.349 --> 02:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
okay so so the other has grown to six
 
02:37:23.359 --> 02:37:24.070 align:start position:0%
okay so so the other has grown to six
perc

02:37:24.070 --> 02:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
perc
 
02:37:25.990 --> 02:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
six percent presumably if that trend
 
02:37:27.190 --> 02:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
continues it'll be
 
02:37:29.910 --> 02:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
seven percent and eight percent well
 
02:37:32.150 --> 02:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
knowing that in those years the total
 
02:37:33.670 --> 02:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
tobacco revenue
 
02:37:35.910 --> 02:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
has been dropping an average of three or
 
02:37:38.070 --> 02:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
four percent
 
02:37:40.070 --> 02:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
so the other is taking a bigger
 
02:37:40.080 --> 02:37:43.670 align:start position:0%
so the other is taking a bigger
percentage

02:37:43.670 --> 02:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:48.710 --> 02:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative southworth
 
02:37:51.910 --> 02:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you um i think i can support
 
02:37:54.230 --> 02:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
the agency's estimates i think
 
02:37:57.030 --> 02:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
for 2021 they've taken into account the
 
02:37:59.429 --> 02:37:59.439 align:start position:0%
kind of increases due to vaping
 
02:38:02.070 --> 02:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
the menthol issue and the covet issue
 
02:38:03.510 --> 02:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
and i'd agree with uh
 
02:38:05.510 --> 02:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative abrami that i think then
 
02:38:06.950 --> 02:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
they've gone back to
 
02:38:09.510 --> 02:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
the long-term trend that it's going to
 
02:38:17.910 --> 02:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:21.110 --> 02:38:21.120 align:start position:0%
representative almighty
 
02:38:24.550 --> 02:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
thank you on i would like to
 
02:38:27.110 --> 02:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
hold this one until we've had a chance
 
02:38:27.120 --> 02:38:28.070 align:start position:0%
hold this one until we've had a chance
to

02:38:28.070 --> 02:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:38:31.830 --> 02:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
to ask the people in the anti-tobacco
 
02:38:33.750 --> 02:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
industry where they see things going
 
02:38:35.030 --> 02:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
right now
 
02:38:39.590 --> 02:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:42.950 --> 02:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
and i'll contact mike rolo and talk
 
02:38:46.070 --> 02:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh president that's pat you know you may
 
02:38:47.429 --> 02:38:47.439 align:start position:0%
want to ask him as well
 
02:38:50.150 --> 02:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
that they usually monitor legislation in
 
02:38:51.910 --> 02:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
other states as well
 
02:38:53.990 --> 02:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
if they have a beat on what's going on
 
02:38:55.030 --> 02:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
with that bill
 
02:38:58.469 --> 02:38:58.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:01.830 --> 02:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:07.590 --> 02:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:09.030 --> 02:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
oh no but they would have knowledge of
 
02:39:11.110 --> 02:39:11.120 align:start position:0%
what of all yes that's
 
02:39:16.550 --> 02:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:20.469 --> 02:39:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:23.990 --> 02:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
okay uh yeah
 
02:39:27.670 --> 02:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to chime in and support uh
 
02:39:30.469 --> 02:39:30.479 align:start position:0%
holding this uh i i don't know that we
 
02:39:32.630 --> 02:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
can get better data but i i was looking
 
02:39:33.429 --> 02:39:33.439 align:start position:0%
while we were
 
02:39:35.390 --> 02:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
all talking at um
 
02:39:35.400 --> 02:39:36.870 align:start position:0%
all talking at um
[Music]

02:39:36.870 --> 02:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:39:38.790 --> 02:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
reports from massachusetts on what's
 
02:39:40.630 --> 02:39:40.640 align:start position:0%
going on from their perspective they're
 
02:39:41.990 --> 02:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
losing a lot of money
 
02:39:44.070 --> 02:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
on this issue not just in new hampshire
 
02:39:45.030 --> 02:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
but to
 
02:39:48.150 --> 02:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
other surrounding states so it's a it's
 
02:39:49.429 --> 02:39:49.439 align:start position:0%
a hot topic and
 
02:39:51.349 --> 02:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
the fact that there's a senate bill is
 
02:39:52.630 --> 02:39:52.640 align:start position:0%
interesting and
 
02:39:53.750 --> 02:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know whether we're going to be
 
02:39:55.190 --> 02:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
able to get a better handle on this
 
02:39:56.710 --> 02:39:56.720 align:start position:0%
usually you can't when you're talking
 
02:39:58.309 --> 02:39:58.319 align:start position:0%
about something that's
 
02:40:01.510 --> 02:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
political like this but um but
 
02:40:03.270 --> 02:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
let's see if we can get a little further
 
02:40:04.710 --> 02:40:04.720 align:start position:0%
down that road before
 
02:40:08.150 --> 02:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
making judgments all right then why
 
02:40:09.349 --> 02:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
don't we move on
 
02:40:12.870 --> 02:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
to we have two you have one more
 
02:40:12.880 --> 02:40:13.830 align:start position:0%
to we have two you have one more
question

02:40:13.830 --> 02:40:13.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:40:17.110 --> 02:40:17.120 align:start position:0%
oh there is okay senator burstein
 
02:40:18.870 --> 02:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you uh just one more data
 
02:40:21.190 --> 02:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
point on this and that's the sponsor of
 
02:40:22.790 --> 02:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
the bill in massachusetts
 
02:40:25.910 --> 02:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
is the assistant minority leader
 
02:40:29.269 --> 02:40:29.279 align:start position:0%
yeah um if that gives you any indication
 
02:40:34.150 --> 02:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
on on how much that it does oh yesterday
 
02:40:36.790 --> 02:40:36.800 align:start position:0%

yes they have a minority of two don't
they

02:40:40.389 --> 02:40:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:43.429 --> 02:40:43.439 align:start position:0%
thank you representative bernstein

left we'll go to the meals and roams
 
02:40:55.269 --> 02:40:55.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:07.910 --> 02:41:07.920 align:start position:0%

02:41:21.030 --> 02:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
you would ask me to reach out to the
 
02:41:23.190 --> 02:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
association to see if somebody to talk
 
02:41:24.790 --> 02:41:24.800 align:start position:0%

at least give you a sense of what's
 
02:41:27.910 --> 02:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
going on with the restaurants
 
02:41:29.910 --> 02:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
particularly those small smaller
 
02:41:32.070 --> 02:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
restaurants that might be closing
 
02:41:33.910 --> 02:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
even if it's temporarily you know what's
 
02:41:36.230 --> 02:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
the impact on long term and and what do
 
02:41:37.670 --> 02:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
they foresee
 
02:41:40.389 --> 02:41:40.399 align:start position:0%
um in terms of you know the pandemic and
 
02:41:42.630 --> 02:41:42.640 align:start position:0%
its long-term impact on on
 
02:41:44.309 --> 02:41:44.319 align:start position:0%
restaurants as well as the lodging in
 
02:41:54.790 --> 02:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:56.550 --> 02:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
and i'll just bump it over to the dra
 
02:42:00.150 --> 02:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:01.910 --> 02:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
percentage changes that they were
 
02:42:21.110 --> 02:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:22.630 --> 02:42:22.640 align:start position:0%
and then if you want i can bring up
 
02:42:25.429 --> 02:42:25.439 align:start position:0%
their presentation from the other day
 
02:42:33.190 --> 02:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:37.110 --> 02:42:37.120 align:start position:0%
um why don't we go with this for right
 
02:42:37.120 --> 02:42:38.830 align:start position:0%
um why don't we go with this for right
now

02:42:38.830 --> 02:42:38.840 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:42:38.840 --> 02:42:41.190 align:start position:0%
now
okay

02:42:41.190 --> 02:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:42:44.870 --> 02:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
okay the first one occur
 
02:42:47.750 --> 02:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
yes this is the probably the area where
 
02:42:47.760 --> 02:42:50.230 align:start position:0%
yes this is the probably the area where
the

02:42:50.230 --> 02:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:53.190 --> 02:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
when we think that the normalcy will
 
02:42:54.630 --> 02:42:54.640 align:start position:0%
come from so-called
 
02:42:57.910 --> 02:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
herd immunity and really getting
 
02:43:00.469 --> 02:43:00.479 align:start position:0%
the pandemic behind us is probably the
 
02:43:02.150 --> 02:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
most important
 
02:43:07.510 --> 02:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
so i'm eager to to hear from someone
 
02:43:09.830 --> 02:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
as to when we think that's going to
 
02:43:09.840 --> 02:43:10.710 align:start position:0%
as to when we think that's going to
happen

02:43:10.710 --> 02:43:10.720 align:start position:0%
happen
 
02:43:14.150 --> 02:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
i watched most of the presentation
 
02:43:18.230 --> 02:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
uh at finance on the pandemic
 
02:43:20.389 --> 02:43:20.399 align:start position:0%
and it really had to do with
 
02:43:22.230 --> 02:43:22.240 align:start position:0%
vaccinations and one thing or another
 
02:43:23.990 --> 02:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
they did not deal with
 
02:43:27.269 --> 02:43:27.279 align:start position:0%
i didn't watch the last 15 minutes but
 
02:43:29.750 --> 02:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh they didn't deal with when they think
 
02:43:31.269 --> 02:43:31.279 align:start position:0%
we'll really
 
02:43:34.309 --> 02:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
have new hampshire reopened
 
02:43:37.429 --> 02:43:37.439 align:start position:0%
to things that would involve meals and
 
02:43:40.630 --> 02:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
rentals tax and i think the
 
02:43:43.590 --> 02:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
spread is such that we do need to get a
 
02:43:45.670 --> 02:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
grasp of that
 
02:43:51.030 --> 02:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
it was clear to me that people in the
 
02:43:54.309 --> 02:43:54.319 align:start position:0%
theme park business they haven't issued
 
02:43:56.389 --> 02:43:56.399 align:start position:0%
when they plan to open
 
02:43:59.030 --> 02:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
they haven't issued uh they haven't
 
02:44:01.190 --> 02:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
hired people for the summer
 
02:44:03.349 --> 02:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
people really don't know what's going to
 
02:44:05.590 --> 02:44:05.600 align:start position:0%
happen in the tourist season for the
 
02:44:07.830 --> 02:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
summer which is so important in new
 
02:44:07.840 --> 02:44:08.790 align:start position:0%
summer which is so important in new
hampshire

02:44:08.790 --> 02:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:44:12.550 --> 02:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
so if we could get if we could hold this
 
02:44:14.870 --> 02:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
until we get some idea
 
02:44:17.670 --> 02:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
of what people who know about herd
 
02:44:19.110 --> 02:44:19.120 align:start position:0%
immunity think
 
02:44:22.230 --> 02:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
i think would be useful
 
02:44:27.349 --> 02:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
okay next representative abrami
 
02:44:30.469 --> 02:44:30.479 align:start position:0%
yes uh maybe a good idea i mean
 
02:44:33.910 --> 02:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
logic of restaurants are 80 of this rev
 
02:44:36.950 --> 02:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
review stream 17 18
 
02:44:39.670 --> 02:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
is lodging i think there's also a
 
02:44:41.910 --> 02:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
lodging association isn't there
 
02:44:45.190 --> 02:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
um is that correct norm i think there is
 
02:44:46.550 --> 02:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
a lodging association
 
02:44:49.030 --> 02:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
yes we can have maybe we can have them
 
02:44:50.150 --> 02:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
come in on the same day
 
02:44:53.830 --> 02:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
as uh the restaurant association
 
02:44:56.070 --> 02:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
they're the same thing aren't they right
 
02:44:57.830 --> 02:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
is the restaurant and lodging is that it
 
02:44:59.910 --> 02:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah mr summers represents the new
 
02:45:00.950 --> 02:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire um
 
02:45:02.790 --> 02:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
lodging and restaurant association okay
 
02:45:04.070 --> 02:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
so there we go
 
02:45:06.230 --> 02:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
and and i asked him um to address both
 
02:45:07.750 --> 02:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
aspects um okay
 
02:45:11.429 --> 02:45:11.439 align:start position:0%
during the presentation right um
 
02:45:13.269 --> 02:45:13.279 align:start position:0%
and especially what i've asked him for
 
02:45:15.830 --> 02:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
is is uh to give you a sense of
 
02:45:18.309 --> 02:45:18.319 align:start position:0%
what they've been seeing right now with
 
02:45:19.429 --> 02:45:19.439 align:start position:0%
with restaurants and
 
02:45:21.030 --> 02:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
lodging what they project in the short
 
02:45:22.469 --> 02:45:22.479 align:start position:0%
term and then the long term
 
02:45:27.349 --> 02:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
short term down the road and then longer
 
02:45:29.110 --> 02:45:29.120 align:start position:0%
letting him know that the committee is
 
02:45:30.469 --> 02:45:30.479 align:start position:0%
trying to get a sense of
 
02:45:32.550 --> 02:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
how do they how do you think fiscal 21
 
02:45:33.990 --> 02:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
is going to end and then you got to
 
02:45:36.790 --> 02:45:36.800 align:start position:0%
project into 22 and 23.
 
02:45:39.910 --> 02:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
so um i may have a few more questions
 
02:45:41.349 --> 02:45:41.359 align:start position:0%
from him but i think he's got a sense of
 
02:45:41.990 --> 02:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
what you're looking
 
02:45:45.510 --> 02:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
for this is this is going to be the
 
02:45:45.520 --> 02:45:46.150 align:start position:0%
for this is this is going to be the
tough

02:45:46.150 --> 02:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
tough
 
02:45:47.670 --> 02:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
this is going to be the toughest one i
 
02:45:49.429 --> 02:45:49.439 align:start position:0%
think that and rotol
 
02:45:52.469 --> 02:45:52.479 align:start position:0%
when we get to to that highway fund
 
02:45:53.750 --> 02:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
these are going to be the two toughest
 
02:45:57.190 --> 02:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
ones to project thank you
 
02:46:00.710 --> 02:46:00.720 align:start position:0%
representative southworth uh thank you
 
02:46:02.550 --> 02:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
i agree with everything that's been said
 
02:46:03.750 --> 02:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
so far
 
02:46:05.750 --> 02:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
um i'd like to delve into a little bit
 
02:46:07.990 --> 02:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
what might happen with the bars
 
02:46:10.309 --> 02:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
and um i just wonder in new hampshire if
 
02:46:12.070 --> 02:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
again we'll go up and down they'll open
 
02:46:13.190 --> 02:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
there'll be a spread
 
02:46:15.750 --> 02:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
then they'll close i'm just not sure how
 
02:46:17.349 --> 02:46:17.359 align:start position:0%
smooth it will be
 
02:46:20.070 --> 02:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
i got taken at a restaurant on saturday
 
02:46:20.710 --> 02:46:20.720 align:start position:0%
it was
 
02:46:22.630 --> 02:46:22.640 align:start position:0%
packed there wasn't a single person
 
02:46:24.790 --> 02:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
wearing a mask because they were eating
 
02:46:27.190 --> 02:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
but the place every table was full every
 
02:46:27.200 --> 02:46:28.710 align:start position:0%
but the place every table was full every
chair

02:46:28.710 --> 02:46:28.720 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:46:31.190 --> 02:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
and i can't imagine you know with what
 
02:46:32.070 --> 02:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
we know
 
02:46:34.630 --> 02:46:34.640 align:start position:0%
that that's not going to cause issues
 
02:46:35.910 --> 02:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
also when we get below
 
02:46:38.070 --> 02:46:38.080 align:start position:0%
age 50 i think we're going to have more
 
02:46:40.389 --> 02:46:40.399 align:start position:0%
people who do not get vaccinated
 
02:46:43.110 --> 02:46:43.120 align:start position:0%
so i just think it's very tricky and
 
02:46:47.269 --> 02:46:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:50.070 --> 02:46:50.080 align:start position:0%
was this restaurant in new hampshire
 
02:46:50.080 --> 02:46:51.590 align:start position:0%
was this restaurant in new hampshire
yeah

02:46:51.590 --> 02:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:46:54.230 --> 02:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
i think the tables might have been six
 
02:46:56.790 --> 02:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
feet apart
 
02:46:59.910 --> 02:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
but still for me to see you know over 60
 
02:46:59.920 --> 02:47:00.550 align:start position:0%
but still for me to see you know over 60
people

02:47:00.550 --> 02:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:47:02.790 --> 02:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
even with the table six feet apart not
 
02:47:04.389 --> 02:47:04.399 align:start position:0%
one person had a mask because they were
 
02:47:06.150 --> 02:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
sipping their coffee or whatever
 
02:47:08.389 --> 02:47:08.399 align:start position:0%
it had to be a super spreader from my
 
02:47:08.399 --> 02:47:09.190 align:start position:0%
it had to be a super spreader from my
position

02:47:09.190 --> 02:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
position
 
02:47:12.550 --> 02:47:12.560 align:start position:0%
because not many people have had shots
 
02:47:16.150 --> 02:47:16.160 align:start position:0%
and i have a feeling this is not unusual
 
02:47:21.830 --> 02:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
okay the next one representative nunes
 
02:47:25.269 --> 02:47:25.279 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh mr chair um
 
02:47:27.349 --> 02:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
i just want to to have make a couple of
 
02:47:28.950 --> 02:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
statements concerning this
 
02:47:30.630 --> 02:47:30.640 align:start position:0%
uh you know we're we're still currently
 
02:47:33.269 --> 02:47:33.279 align:start position:0%
dealing with moderated customer access
 
02:47:36.469 --> 02:47:36.479 align:start position:0%
in the restaurants and lodging
 
02:47:40.790 --> 02:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
of those businesses because of the
 
02:47:43.830 --> 02:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
emergency orders that are still in place
 
02:47:45.750 --> 02:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
another another point is that there are
 
02:47:47.670 --> 02:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
many businesses that have closed their
 
02:47:48.550 --> 02:47:48.560 align:start position:0%
doors and
 
02:47:51.670 --> 02:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
we're still seeing drops in revenue
 
02:47:53.910 --> 02:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
because of business closures
 
02:47:55.750 --> 02:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
uh people that are struggling and they
 
02:47:57.670 --> 02:47:57.680 align:start position:0%
just can they're finding out week after
 
02:47:59.110 --> 02:47:59.120 align:start position:0%
week that they just can no longer make
 
02:48:01.429 --> 02:48:01.439 align:start position:0%
it we need to keep that in mind
 
02:48:04.550 --> 02:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
i also wanted to just give a little side
 
02:48:07.670 --> 02:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
note here my mother-in-law went skiing
 
02:48:09.429 --> 02:48:09.439 align:start position:0%
when we had the big storm that came
 
02:48:12.469 --> 02:48:12.479 align:start position:0%
through and
 
02:48:14.309 --> 02:48:14.319 align:start position:0%
she said it was really difficult at the
 
02:48:16.309 --> 02:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
slopes because of the restrictions that
 
02:48:17.910 --> 02:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
were there
 
02:48:21.670 --> 02:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
it it was very frustrating for customers
 
02:48:24.150 --> 02:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
and that the conversations that she had
 
02:48:25.590 --> 02:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
with other people is that they weren't
 
02:48:26.950 --> 02:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
going to be going back because it was
 
02:48:28.230 --> 02:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
too difficult
 
02:48:29.750 --> 02:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
they had to stand in line for the
 
02:48:31.349 --> 02:48:31.359 align:start position:0%
restrooms only one person
 
02:48:33.349 --> 02:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
at a time and i'm just giving you guys
 
02:48:34.389 --> 02:48:34.399 align:start position:0%
some some leads in
 
02:48:37.670 --> 02:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
on on what we're seeing out there um and
 
02:48:39.830 --> 02:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
that you were you were you were timed
 
02:48:41.269 --> 02:48:41.279 align:start position:0%
inside the restaurant you could only be
 
02:48:43.429 --> 02:48:43.439 align:start position:0%
in the restaurant for 30 minutes
 
02:48:46.790 --> 02:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh and uh the the spacing
 
02:48:48.870 --> 02:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
that they had outside for people to
 
02:48:50.389 --> 02:48:50.399 align:start position:0%
stand to get on the lips
 
02:48:52.630 --> 02:48:52.640 align:start position:0%
just made it really difficult and they
 
02:48:54.550 --> 02:48:54.560 align:start position:0%
all had to traverse a long way just to
 
02:48:56.309 --> 02:48:56.319 align:start position:0%
get to a lift and she said
 
02:48:59.269 --> 02:48:59.279 align:start position:0%
we're not going back this year uh until
 
02:49:01.510 --> 02:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
we figure out what's going on
 
02:49:04.150 --> 02:49:04.160 align:start position:0%
as we move out of situations like that i
 
02:49:05.910 --> 02:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
think we have to look at what's going to
 
02:49:05.920 --> 02:49:06.790 align:start position:0%
think we have to look at what's going to
happen

02:49:06.790 --> 02:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
happen
 
02:49:08.389 --> 02:49:08.399 align:start position:0%
i think things will lighten up again in
 
02:49:09.990 --> 02:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
the summertime just as they did last
 
02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:10.469 align:start position:0%
the summertime just as they did last
summer

02:49:10.469 --> 02:49:10.479 align:start position:0%
summer
 
02:49:13.349 --> 02:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
and what happens if future restrictions
 
02:49:15.030 --> 02:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
are applied
 
02:49:17.510 --> 02:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
and we when we move out of the summer
 
02:49:19.990 --> 02:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
months into the cold months again
 
02:49:21.349 --> 02:49:21.359 align:start position:0%
as we have different strains of the
 
02:49:23.590 --> 02:49:23.600 align:start position:0%
virus that are coming out that will be
 
02:49:26.630 --> 02:49:26.640 align:start position:0%
looked at by our people in charge up
 
02:49:27.269 --> 02:49:27.279 align:start position:0%
there making
 
02:49:29.269 --> 02:49:29.279 align:start position:0%
making the decisions about emergency
 
02:49:29.279 --> 02:49:31.110 align:start position:0%
making the decisions about emergency
orders

02:49:31.110 --> 02:49:31.120 align:start position:0%
orders
 
02:49:32.950 --> 02:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
this is all going to have a big effect
 
02:49:34.710 --> 02:49:34.720 align:start position:0%
on on
 
02:49:37.110 --> 02:49:37.120 align:start position:0%
the the possibilities of gauging a
 
02:49:38.389 --> 02:49:38.399 align:start position:0%
revenue stream for
 
02:49:41.030 --> 02:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
rims and meals and i think that we have
 
02:49:43.190 --> 02:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
to take a very conservative approach
 
02:49:44.630 --> 02:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
and i agree that we need to hear a
 
02:49:48.150 --> 02:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:52.309 --> 02:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
the next one representative almighty
 
02:49:56.070 --> 02:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
thank you on i think
 
02:49:59.590 --> 02:49:59.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to have yeah i i agree we
 
02:50:01.030 --> 02:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
have to take a conservative
 
02:50:04.389 --> 02:50:04.399 align:start position:0%
approach with this i do not see
 
02:50:06.389 --> 02:50:06.399 align:start position:0%
how we're going to be able to get good
 
02:50:08.550 --> 02:50:08.560 align:start position:0%
information on how
 
02:50:11.830 --> 02:50:11.840 align:start position:0%
the covid pandemic how long it's going
 
02:50:13.269 --> 02:50:13.279 align:start position:0%
to go
 
02:50:16.950 --> 02:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
on with the variants coming in
 
02:50:20.309 --> 02:50:20.319 align:start position:0%
and on i've been listening to
 
02:50:23.349 --> 02:50:23.359 align:start position:0%
some pretty scary stuff about if we
 
02:50:25.269 --> 02:50:25.279 align:start position:0%
don't get people vaccinated
 
02:50:29.349 --> 02:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
in time on the variants are going to be
 
02:50:32.230 --> 02:50:32.240 align:start position:0%
proliferating or if we don't get the
 
02:50:32.790 --> 02:50:32.800 align:start position:0%
people in
 
02:50:36.309 --> 02:50:36.319 align:start position:0%
africa vaccinated in time they will
 
02:50:38.070 --> 02:50:38.080 align:start position:0%
bring back variants
 
02:50:41.910 --> 02:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
that may be resistant to our
 
02:50:45.590 --> 02:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
to our vaccines and
 
02:50:49.190 --> 02:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
on what it will get away from us again
 
02:50:52.550 --> 02:50:52.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i think we need
 
02:50:55.830 --> 02:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
need medical experts outside of
 
02:50:58.950 --> 02:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
the state to talk to us at this point
 
02:51:00.950 --> 02:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
the state government
 
02:51:04.150 --> 02:51:04.160 align:start position:0%
because on i was listening to their
 
02:51:06.150 --> 02:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
presentation to hhs
 
02:51:07.670 --> 02:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
at the time that they gave it a couple
 
02:51:09.349 --> 02:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
of weeks ago and
 
02:51:11.590 --> 02:51:11.600 align:start position:0%
they were sure that they were going to
 
02:51:12.870 --> 02:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
be able to
 
02:51:15.990 --> 02:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
um move everybody that needed a second
 
02:51:18.389 --> 02:51:18.399 align:start position:0%
shot to a totally separate system and
 
02:51:19.110 --> 02:51:19.120 align:start position:0%
leave room
 
02:51:22.550 --> 02:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
for people who needed a first shot to
 
02:51:24.870 --> 02:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
get a little bit closer to the beginning
 
02:51:26.550 --> 02:51:26.560 align:start position:0%
of 1b
 
02:51:29.830 --> 02:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
uh it looks at this point i mean
 
02:51:33.110 --> 02:51:33.120 align:start position:0%
that didn't work it's been quite a mess
 
02:51:37.030 --> 02:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:38.630 --> 02:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
and once they've got it working
 
02:51:41.269 --> 02:51:41.279 align:start position:0%
hopefully it will help things
 
02:51:43.910 --> 02:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
but if we don't get enough people
 
02:51:43.920 --> 02:51:44.870 align:start position:0%
but if we don't get enough people
vaccinated

02:51:44.870 --> 02:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
02:51:48.070 --> 02:51:48.080 align:start position:0%
before the variants start spreading
 
02:51:50.070 --> 02:51:50.080 align:start position:0%
which they are already doing spreading
 
02:51:51.830 --> 02:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
across the country
 
02:51:55.269 --> 02:51:55.279 align:start position:0%
fairly rapidly at this point then
 
02:51:58.309 --> 02:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a much harder time
 
02:52:02.230 --> 02:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
controlling this epidemic
 
02:52:05.190 --> 02:52:05.200 align:start position:0%
that we for that we need people from the
 
02:52:05.200 --> 02:52:06.309 align:start position:0%
that we for that we need people from the
medical

02:52:06.309 --> 02:52:06.319 align:start position:0%
medical
 
02:52:10.070 --> 02:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
profession that are not uh
 
02:52:13.429 --> 02:52:13.439 align:start position:0%
not obliged to toe the party line
 
02:52:16.870 --> 02:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
and not party sorry on
 
02:52:20.870 --> 02:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
the the state establishment line
 
02:52:24.230 --> 02:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
and we can get this done
 
02:52:28.309 --> 02:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
chris chris yep
 
02:52:32.230 --> 02:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
how are we doing and getting hhs
 
02:52:35.349 --> 02:52:35.359 align:start position:0%
or somebody that's a expert
 
02:52:37.510 --> 02:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
in the vaccine coming before the
 
02:52:37.520 --> 02:52:38.950 align:start position:0%
in the vaccine coming before the
committee

02:52:38.950 --> 02:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:52:41.590 --> 02:52:41.600 align:start position:0%
um i'm still waiting for them to clear
 
02:52:42.469 --> 02:52:42.479 align:start position:0%
somebody from
 
02:52:44.070 --> 02:52:44.080 align:start position:0%
to schedule with us i'm not sure we're
 
02:52:46.230 --> 02:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
going to get somebody i mean that
 
02:52:48.550 --> 02:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
i've been dealing with john williams and
 
02:52:48.560 --> 02:52:49.670 align:start position:0%
i've been dealing with john williams and
abigail

02:52:49.670 --> 02:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
abigail
 
02:52:53.190 --> 02:52:53.200 align:start position:0%
and i forget her last name right now but
 
02:52:54.389 --> 02:52:54.399 align:start position:0%
they were pretty sure we wouldn't be
 
02:52:55.990 --> 02:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
able to get dr chan so they were trying
 
02:52:57.510 --> 02:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
to see who else would be available
 
02:52:59.349 --> 02:52:59.359 align:start position:0%
i gave him the date to the 16th and the
 
02:53:02.790 --> 02:53:02.800 align:start position:0%
18th to try to schedule somebody
 
02:53:04.870 --> 02:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
um i had no luck scheduling the other
 
02:53:06.710 --> 02:53:06.720 align:start position:0%
two doctors that were mentioned
 
02:53:10.710 --> 02:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
dr calderwood and dr mercado
 
02:53:13.429 --> 02:53:13.439 align:start position:0%
um i think i forwarded that information
 
02:53:14.950 --> 02:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
back to the committee
 
02:53:17.030 --> 02:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
um they didn't have time available to
 
02:53:19.030 --> 02:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
come and meet with you
 
02:53:22.830 --> 02:53:22.840 align:start position:0%
um i i don't know what to suggest
 
02:53:25.429 --> 02:53:25.439 align:start position:0%
or provide for information other than
 
02:53:27.030 --> 02:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
that at this point i have nobody
 
02:53:28.790 --> 02:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
to come in and discuss this issue with
 
02:53:31.030 --> 02:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
you maybe there's something interesting
 
02:53:35.830 --> 02:53:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:39.269 --> 02:53:39.279 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry um
 
02:53:42.710 --> 02:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:45.670 --> 02:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
would we be able to solicit something in
 
02:53:45.680 --> 02:53:46.309 align:start position:0%
would we be able to solicit something in
writing

02:53:46.309 --> 02:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
writing
 
02:53:48.950 --> 02:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
maybe from the cdc from their latest
 
02:53:51.030 --> 02:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
bulletins on where they think things are
 
02:53:51.040 --> 02:53:59.830 align:start position:0%
bulletins on where they think things are
going

02:53:59.830 --> 02:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:02.870 --> 02:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
we need to be able to have a
 
02:54:05.429 --> 02:54:05.439 align:start position:0%
question and answer session with the
 
02:54:07.590 --> 02:54:07.600 align:start position:0%
committee so they understand what this
 
02:54:11.349 --> 02:54:11.359 align:start position:0%
what the time tells but meanwhile maybe
 
02:54:13.110 --> 02:54:13.120 align:start position:0%
we all could be looking for things that
 
02:54:15.269 --> 02:54:15.279 align:start position:0%
would be useful to the whole committee
 
02:54:18.870 --> 02:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
i haven't seen really anything but
 
02:54:22.790 --> 02:54:22.800 align:start position:0%
perhaps if we all keep our eyes open to
 
02:54:25.910 --> 02:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
possible stories we need to understand
 
02:54:25.920 --> 02:54:26.550 align:start position:0%
possible stories we need to understand
this

02:54:26.550 --> 02:54:26.560 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:54:30.389 --> 02:54:30.399 align:start position:0%
it's very important so
 
02:54:33.510 --> 02:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
we've got to move it off dead center so
 
02:54:37.670 --> 02:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
let's see i'll talk to you chris
 
02:54:40.870 --> 02:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
yep who's next
 
02:54:44.469 --> 02:54:44.479 align:start position:0%
representative ames okay thank you
 
02:54:47.830 --> 02:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
um yeah i just wanted to say that i
 
02:54:50.309 --> 02:54:50.319 align:start position:0%
uh wholeheartedly with what
 
02:54:52.070 --> 02:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
representative nunes put forward and
 
02:54:54.070 --> 02:54:54.080 align:start position:0%
then others have chimed in
 
02:54:57.990 --> 02:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
um this is this is a really difficult
 
02:55:00.469 --> 02:55:00.479 align:start position:0%
uh source of revenue to estimate and
 
02:55:03.349 --> 02:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
it's also true i i would add
 
02:55:05.030 --> 02:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
for the business taxes which we haven't
 
02:55:07.670 --> 02:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
discussed yet but they're affected by
 
02:55:11.349 --> 02:55:11.359 align:start position:0%
this uh uh covet phenomenon also
 
02:55:14.070 --> 02:55:14.080 align:start position:0%
um i do think we should get what
 
02:55:16.070 --> 02:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
information we can but each of us
 
02:55:19.510 --> 02:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
is you know we're doing that uh i'm sure
 
02:55:21.830 --> 02:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
everybody is reading and searching for
 
02:55:24.309 --> 02:55:24.319 align:start position:0%
good information there's no guru out
 
02:55:25.830 --> 02:55:25.840 align:start position:0%
there that's going to tell us
 
02:55:27.830 --> 02:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
what the case is going to be a year from
 
02:55:29.190 --> 02:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
now we're going to have to make
 
02:55:30.790 --> 02:55:30.800 align:start position:0%
judgments about that
 
02:55:32.790 --> 02:55:32.800 align:start position:0%
and so back to representative nunez's
 
02:55:35.190 --> 02:55:35.200 align:start position:0%
comment i i myself plan to be
 
02:55:38.469 --> 02:55:38.479 align:start position:0%
uh cautious on this conservative uh
 
02:55:41.510 --> 02:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
in my estimating uh knowing that
 
02:55:45.190 --> 02:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
um there is a big piece that is going to
 
02:55:47.510 --> 02:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
affect revenues in a significant way
 
02:55:47.520 --> 02:55:48.550 align:start position:0%
affect revenues in a significant way
that

02:55:48.550 --> 02:55:48.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:55:51.190 --> 02:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
is unpredictable so we just have to make
 
02:55:53.269 --> 02:55:53.279 align:start position:0%
the best judgment we can
 
02:55:55.110 --> 02:55:55.120 align:start position:0%
that's my contribution i look forward to
 
02:55:57.830 --> 02:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
whatever information that can be
 
02:55:59.910 --> 02:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
for the committee and i'll keep poking
 
02:56:04.550 --> 02:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:09.349 --> 02:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
next representative spillsberry
 
02:56:13.590 --> 02:56:13.600 align:start position:0%
right so this is so inherently unknown
 
02:56:16.710 --> 02:56:16.720 align:start position:0%
and that's baked into the range
 
02:56:19.750 --> 02:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
of forecasts we've gotten which is why
 
02:56:22.870 --> 02:56:22.880 align:start position:0%
representative james was inclined
 
02:56:25.830 --> 02:56:25.840 align:start position:0%
the range is especially large with the
 
02:56:27.429 --> 02:56:27.439 align:start position:0%
business tax and the meals and rental
 
02:56:29.030 --> 02:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
stats so
 
02:56:30.950 --> 02:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
while i'm completely open and open
 
02:56:32.950 --> 02:56:32.960 align:start position:0%
minded want to hear as much input
 
02:56:35.670 --> 02:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
as possible i think this is so
 
02:56:35.680 --> 02:56:36.469 align:start position:0%
as possible i think this is so
unknowable

02:56:36.469 --> 02:56:36.479 align:start position:0%
unknowable
 
02:56:38.630 --> 02:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
what we should do is simply go for the
 
02:56:41.349 --> 02:56:41.359 align:start position:0%
most conservative end of the range
 
02:56:43.590 --> 02:56:43.600 align:start position:0%
and then any upside is not counted on
 
02:56:48.550 --> 02:56:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:52.630 --> 02:56:52.640 align:start position:0%
thanks there are no more
 
02:56:55.670 --> 02:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
all right so this is
 
02:56:57.510 --> 02:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
we're gonna hold this until we can get
 
02:57:00.389 --> 02:57:00.399 align:start position:0%
some more information
 
02:57:23.110 --> 02:57:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:24.710 --> 02:57:24.720 align:start position:0%
i think we also have not covered
 
02:57:27.090 --> 02:57:27.100 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends
 
02:57:27.100 --> 02:57:28.389 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends
[Music]

02:57:28.389 --> 02:57:28.399 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:57:36.309 --> 02:57:36.319 align:start position:0%
that is right
 
02:57:39.990 --> 02:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
you are right let's go to the business
 
02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:40.710 align:start position:0%
you are right let's go to the business
taxes

02:57:40.710 --> 02:57:40.720 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
02:57:49.990 --> 02:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
and then interesting
 
02:57:52.230 --> 02:57:52.240 align:start position:0%
so i've got on the general fund
 
02:57:54.389 --> 02:57:54.399 align:start position:0%
education trust fund worksheet page it's
 
02:57:54.399 --> 02:57:54.710 align:start position:0%
education trust fund worksheet page it's
the

02:57:54.710 --> 02:57:54.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:58:00.070 --> 02:58:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:03.190 --> 02:58:03.200 align:start position:0%
remember that the the
 
02:58:07.429 --> 02:58:07.439 align:start position:0%
fy 2021 revenue numbers on a cash basis
 
02:58:09.590 --> 02:58:09.600 align:start position:0%
are actually 30 million dollars higher
 
02:58:11.750 --> 02:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
than what you're using for your base and
 
02:58:13.349 --> 02:58:13.359 align:start position:0%
the reason was there was money that was
 
02:58:14.950 --> 02:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
collected in 21
 
02:58:17.510 --> 02:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
that was attributable to fiscal year 20.
 
02:58:19.910 --> 02:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
so i just want to
 
02:58:22.150 --> 02:58:22.160 align:start position:0%
just remind you of that and it so it's
 
02:58:23.429 --> 02:58:23.439 align:start position:0%
already backed out of the numbers that
 
02:58:26.150 --> 02:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
you have before you
 
02:58:27.670 --> 02:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
in terms of the cash basis when you're
 
02:58:31.030 --> 02:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
looking at the revenue focus
 
02:58:32.710 --> 02:58:32.720 align:start position:0%
if you look at what's been collected to
 
02:58:32.720 --> 02:58:34.790 align:start position:0%
if you look at what's been collected to
date

02:58:34.790 --> 02:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
date
 
02:58:39.190 --> 02:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
by year to date it's going to be higher
 
02:58:41.349 --> 02:58:41.359 align:start position:0%
because there's a line at the bottom of
 
02:58:43.429 --> 02:58:43.439 align:start position:0%
the table that subtracts that 30.8
 
02:58:43.439 --> 02:58:44.469 align:start position:0%
the table that subtracts that 30.8
million

02:58:44.469 --> 02:58:44.479 align:start position:0%
million
 
02:58:46.550 --> 02:58:46.560 align:start position:0%
so for business taxes it's 18 million
 
02:58:48.230 --> 02:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
but for all the other revenue so i've
 
02:58:50.950 --> 02:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
had that we've backed out those um those
 
02:58:50.960 --> 02:58:52.389 align:start position:0%
had that we've backed out those um those
numbers

02:58:52.389 --> 02:58:52.399 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
02:58:54.469 --> 02:58:54.479 align:start position:0%
um i mean i don't have anything to say
 
02:58:55.990 --> 02:58:56.000 align:start position:0%
about the business taxes i think you
 
02:58:56.790 --> 02:58:56.800 align:start position:0%
you're all
 
02:58:59.349 --> 02:58:59.359 align:start position:0%
alluding to the issues and it's there's
 
02:58:59.990 --> 02:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
a lot going
 
02:59:01.990 --> 02:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
on and that could impact your taxes one
 
02:59:03.590 --> 02:59:03.600 align:start position:0%
way or another
 
02:59:05.030 --> 02:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
um you know as it relates to the
 
02:59:07.269 --> 02:59:07.279 align:start position:0%
pandemic as it relates to
 
02:59:09.590 --> 02:59:09.600 align:start position:0%
businesses that are slowed down as a
 
02:59:10.469 --> 02:59:10.479 align:start position:0%
part of it
 
02:59:12.230 --> 02:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
as part of the pandemic others that are
 
02:59:14.309 --> 02:59:14.319 align:start position:0%
accelerated as part of the pandemic and
 
02:59:15.990 --> 02:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
and where that lands in terms of your
 
02:59:18.389 --> 02:59:18.399 align:start position:0%
business taxes is uh
 
02:59:21.910 --> 02:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
uh this is why it's hard to project
 
02:59:24.950 --> 02:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
this is why we need to get somebody that
 
02:59:24.960 --> 02:59:25.429 align:start position:0%
this is why we need to get somebody that
will

02:59:25.429 --> 02:59:25.439 align:start position:0%
will
 
02:59:29.750 --> 02:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
bring us up to date on the status of the
 
02:59:33.190 --> 02:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
vaccinations and the pandemic
 
02:59:36.389 --> 02:59:36.399 align:start position:0%
pandemic as a whole we don't understand
 
02:59:36.399 --> 02:59:38.790 align:start position:0%
pandemic as a whole we don't understand
that

02:59:38.790 --> 02:59:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:51.350 --> 02:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:51.360 --> 02:59:55.510 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:59:55.510 --> 02:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:58.389 --> 02:59:58.399 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um so through january
 
03:00:01.030 --> 03:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
we're 78.5 million ahead of plan the
 
03:00:02.790 --> 03:00:02.800 align:start position:0%
plan that was developed two years ago
 
03:00:04.309 --> 03:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
three years ago
 
03:00:06.950 --> 03:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
so that's a good sign uh but we all know
 
03:00:07.990 --> 03:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
that we're waiting
 
03:00:11.269 --> 03:00:11.279 align:start position:0%
the real real test is going to be
 
03:00:12.469 --> 03:00:12.479 align:start position:0%
what the estimates are going to be
 
03:00:14.950 --> 03:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
coming in at uh in march and april
 
03:00:16.550 --> 03:00:16.560 align:start position:0%
what comes in when people file their
 
03:00:19.030 --> 03:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
final tax return so just want to remind
 
03:00:20.070 --> 03:00:20.080 align:start position:0%
everybody of that
 
03:00:23.670 --> 03:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
but right now it's looking pretty good
 
03:00:26.150 --> 03:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
my sense is that and again we got to
 
03:00:27.990 --> 03:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
remember upside down chart that most of
 
03:00:28.000 --> 03:00:28.309 align:start position:0%
remember upside down chart that most of
this

03:00:28.309 --> 03:00:28.319 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:00:30.950 --> 03:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
business taxes come come from the large
 
03:00:30.960 --> 03:00:32.950 align:start position:0%
business taxes come come from the large
companies

03:00:32.950 --> 03:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
companies
 
03:00:35.110 --> 03:00:35.120 align:start position:0%
my sense is that a large a lot of these
 
03:00:36.710 --> 03:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
larger companies are weathering this
 
03:00:39.269 --> 03:00:39.279 align:start position:0%
storm pretty well
 
03:00:40.790 --> 03:00:40.800 align:start position:0%
and we have a lot of manufacturing
 
03:00:42.870 --> 03:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
producing pieces that go into other
 
03:00:42.880 --> 03:00:43.670 align:start position:0%
producing pieces that go into other
products

03:00:43.670 --> 03:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
products
 
03:00:45.750 --> 03:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
that they sell you know around the
 
03:00:45.760 --> 03:00:47.030 align:start position:0%
that they sell you know around the
country

03:00:47.030 --> 03:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
country
 
03:00:50.389 --> 03:00:50.399 align:start position:0%
so i you know yeah
 
03:00:51.830 --> 03:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
i think this one's going to be a little
 
03:00:53.429 --> 03:00:53.439 align:start position:0%
easier to estimate than
 
03:00:57.030 --> 03:00:57.040 align:start position:0%
than women meals tax
 
03:01:00.550 --> 03:01:00.560 align:start position:0%
and obviously the dra
 
03:01:00.560 --> 03:01:04.070 align:start position:0%
and obviously the dra
is

03:01:04.070 --> 03:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:05.990 --> 03:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
a bit optimistic as well when you look
 
03:01:07.429 --> 03:01:07.439 align:start position:0%
at when you look at
 
03:01:10.790 --> 03:01:10.800 align:start position:0%
their estimates um again
 
03:01:12.630 --> 03:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
we know a lot of the small businesses
 
03:01:14.150 --> 03:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
have been hurt
 
03:01:16.710 --> 03:01:16.720 align:start position:0%
uh but again a lot of them didn't even
 
03:01:16.720 --> 03:01:17.590 align:start position:0%
uh but again a lot of them didn't even
pay

03:01:17.590 --> 03:01:17.600 align:start position:0%
pay
 
03:01:21.030 --> 03:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
these taxes maybe some bet
 
03:01:24.150 --> 03:01:24.160 align:start position:0%
but so i you know i think this one won't
 
03:01:25.349 --> 03:01:25.359 align:start position:0%
be as difficult as
 
03:01:28.550 --> 03:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
as interest and rumor males uh
 
03:01:31.830 --> 03:01:31.840 align:start position:0%
to to estimate unless there's some major
 
03:01:33.030 --> 03:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
catastrophe that
 
03:01:36.070 --> 03:01:36.080 align:start position:0%
unforeseen catastrophe that will
 
03:01:38.550 --> 03:01:38.560 align:start position:0%
impact these larger companies but right
 
03:01:40.550 --> 03:01:40.560 align:start position:0%
now as of this moment it looks like
 
03:01:42.790 --> 03:01:42.800 align:start position:0%
they're weathering it pretty well and
 
03:01:43.910 --> 03:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
these are the companies
 
03:01:46.710 --> 03:01:46.720 align:start position:0%
we rely on that's all i had to say on
 
03:01:46.720 --> 03:01:47.110 align:start position:0%
we rely on that's all i had to say on
this

03:01:47.110 --> 03:01:47.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:01:49.349 --> 03:01:49.359 align:start position:0%
thank you and if you do look at the
 
03:01:50.790 --> 03:01:50.800 align:start position:0%
revenue focus
 
03:01:53.670 --> 03:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
it shows 78 million in the head it's
 
03:01:53.680 --> 03:01:54.150 align:start position:0%
it shows 78 million in the head it's
really

03:01:54.150 --> 03:01:54.160 align:start position:0%
really
 
03:01:57.269 --> 03:01:57.279 align:start position:0%
60 million because of the
 
03:02:00.550 --> 03:02:00.560 align:start position:0%
if you look at down below
 
03:02:03.910 --> 03:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
right i uneven should have gone and 18.2
 
03:02:04.469 --> 03:02:04.479 align:start position:0%
million it
 
03:02:09.590 --> 03:02:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:13.590 --> 03:02:13.600 align:start position:0%
30.8 million 18.3 million
 
03:02:16.950 --> 03:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
is business taxes that are bringing it
 
03:02:18.230 --> 03:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
out of 60
 
03:02:21.830 --> 03:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
right who's next
 
03:02:21.840 --> 03:02:25.670 align:start position:0%
right who's next
representative

03:02:25.670 --> 03:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:29.030 --> 03:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:32.389 --> 03:02:32.399 align:start position:0%
uncertainties uncertainties so um
 
03:02:34.309 --> 03:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
we've got a whole lot of variables
 
03:02:36.070 --> 03:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
feeding into this one
 
03:02:39.750 --> 03:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
that carry uncertainties one is uh
 
03:02:42.870 --> 03:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
current law where there are changes that
 
03:02:43.990 --> 03:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
are going to impact
 
03:02:46.950 --> 03:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh revenues the market market-based
 
03:02:48.309 --> 03:02:48.319 align:start position:0%
sourcing single
 
03:02:51.030 --> 03:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
sales factor both of those are baked
 
03:02:52.389 --> 03:02:52.399 align:start position:0%
into the
 
03:02:54.790 --> 03:02:54.800 align:start position:0%
current upcoming law and we've got to
 
03:02:55.590 --> 03:02:55.600 align:start position:0%
deal with them
 
03:02:58.950 --> 03:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
uh hard as that will be and um
 
03:03:01.030 --> 03:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
as uh representative brownie has pointed
 
03:03:03.670 --> 03:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
out we don't know yet
 
03:03:05.349 --> 03:03:05.359 align:start position:0%
how revenue is going to come in this
 
03:03:06.870 --> 03:03:06.880 align:start position:0%
year and we've got some
 
03:03:09.269 --> 03:03:09.279 align:start position:0%
significant inputs that are going to
 
03:03:09.279 --> 03:03:10.230 align:start position:0%
significant inputs that are going to
happen

03:03:10.230 --> 03:03:10.240 align:start position:0%
happen
 
03:03:13.750 --> 03:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
soon but not soon enough uh
 
03:03:16.389 --> 03:03:16.399 align:start position:0%
and i mean that in terms of our ability
 
03:03:18.309 --> 03:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
to estimate we'll get them a little
 
03:03:19.990 --> 03:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
a little bit late in this budgeting
 
03:03:22.630 --> 03:03:22.640 align:start position:0%
process so there's that
 
03:03:25.349 --> 03:03:25.359 align:start position:0%
there's the rate question we've got the
 
03:03:27.110 --> 03:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
lower rate
 
03:03:29.670 --> 03:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
and we'll get more money out of that and
 
03:03:33.269 --> 03:03:33.279 align:start position:0%
there are arguments in this committee
 
03:03:36.550 --> 03:03:36.560 align:start position:0%
for assuming that the lower rate will
 
03:03:37.910 --> 03:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
lead to more
 
03:03:40.469 --> 03:03:40.479 align:start position:0%
business revenues i i don't agree with
 
03:03:40.479 --> 03:03:41.190 align:start position:0%
business revenues i i don't agree with
that

03:03:41.190 --> 03:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:03:45.670 --> 03:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
um but uh that i think influences uh
 
03:03:48.710 --> 03:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh judgments on uh on revenue
 
03:03:51.910 --> 03:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
and so we will need to talk about that
 
03:03:55.349 --> 03:03:55.359 align:start position:0%
um and uh impacts of
 
03:03:58.870 --> 03:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh various changes in the tax law
 
03:04:02.070 --> 03:04:02.080 align:start position:0%
both federally and uh
 
03:04:06.070 --> 03:04:06.080 align:start position:0%
at the state level continue um
 
03:04:08.230 --> 03:04:08.240 align:start position:0%
foreign dividends for example how will
 
03:04:10.469 --> 03:04:10.479 align:start position:0%
those change or not change
 
03:04:13.990 --> 03:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
uh from the level that they've reached
 
03:04:16.950 --> 03:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
since the enactment of the big federal
 
03:04:16.960 --> 03:04:17.670 align:start position:0%
since the enactment of the big federal
change

03:04:17.670 --> 03:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
change
 
03:04:20.870 --> 03:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
whatever year was i don't remember
 
03:04:24.070 --> 03:04:24.080 align:start position:0%
and uh and so um
 
03:04:26.070 --> 03:04:26.080 align:start position:0%
this is a tough one that's all i can say
 
03:04:29.670 --> 03:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:32.630 --> 03:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
well there's one thing is when we do our
 
03:04:33.910 --> 03:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates
 
03:04:37.510 --> 03:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
it's based on current law
 
03:04:41.030 --> 03:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
the uh house bill 10 which has to do
 
03:04:42.070 --> 03:04:42.080 align:start position:0%
with rate
 
03:04:46.150 --> 03:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
is a separate issue altogether okay
 
03:04:49.429 --> 03:04:49.439 align:start position:0%
okay who's next representative
 
03:04:53.030 --> 03:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
alby thank you
 
03:04:56.150 --> 03:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
on two things first
 
03:04:59.349 --> 03:04:59.359 align:start position:0%
i'd i guess maybe i better concentrate
 
03:05:00.550 --> 03:05:00.560 align:start position:0%
on what people have been
 
03:05:04.710 --> 03:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
talking about recently first on
 
03:05:07.990 --> 03:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
the the dra essentially
 
03:05:11.349 --> 03:05:11.359 align:start position:0%
said it can't estimate single sales
 
03:05:11.359 --> 03:05:12.070 align:start position:0%
said it can't estimate single sales
factor

03:05:12.070 --> 03:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
factor
 
03:05:14.150 --> 03:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
but that the indications are that it
 
03:05:15.670 --> 03:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
will cost us
 
03:05:19.269 --> 03:05:19.279 align:start position:0%
money but that is based on a totally
 
03:05:21.269 --> 03:05:21.279 align:start position:0%
different environment than
 
03:05:24.550 --> 03:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
then it will come into next year
 
03:05:28.070 --> 03:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
and they they don't have a firm handle
 
03:05:28.080 --> 03:05:28.550 align:start position:0%
and they they don't have a firm handle
on

03:05:28.550 --> 03:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:05:30.389 --> 03:05:30.399 align:start position:0%
on market-based sourcing what that
 
03:05:32.389 --> 03:05:32.399 align:start position:0%
impact is going to be either
 
03:05:35.750 --> 03:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
and i don't remember uh them saying
 
03:05:38.150 --> 03:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
anything about that when they talked
 
03:05:39.830 --> 03:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
with us before
 
03:05:43.830 --> 03:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:47.910 --> 03:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
on we've they are current law
 
03:05:49.190 --> 03:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
so i don't know what we're going to do
 
03:05:51.590 --> 03:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
about that but um
 
03:05:55.030 --> 03:05:55.040 align:start position:0%
we might uh start
 
03:05:58.550 --> 03:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
asking them if they included that
 
03:06:02.150 --> 03:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
it's not in their list of effects
 
03:06:05.830 --> 03:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
that affect their decisions on this
 
03:06:10.070 --> 03:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
that were on page 22 of the
 
03:06:13.990 --> 03:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
january 19 presentation
 
03:06:17.429 --> 03:06:17.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:19.670 --> 03:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
and all of the future outlook
 
03:06:21.510 --> 03:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
essentially was
 
03:06:24.870 --> 03:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
coveted related on that one
 
03:06:28.469 --> 03:06:28.479 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:06:31.910 --> 03:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
it's page 22 of of i don't know if
 
03:06:33.110 --> 03:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
you're in the
 
03:06:34.950 --> 03:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
next i'm i think you might be
 
03:06:36.710 --> 03:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
referencing the um
 
03:06:39.349 --> 03:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
presentation that the first presentation
 
03:06:40.830 --> 03:06:40.840 align:start position:0%
the week before
 
03:06:43.349 --> 03:06:43.359 align:start position:0%
yes i have the wrong presentation up i
 
03:06:45.030 --> 03:06:45.040 align:start position:0%
can bring that one up
 
03:06:50.230 --> 03:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:52.630 --> 03:06:52.640 align:start position:0%
and the the covid part of this is going
 
03:06:53.429 --> 03:06:53.439 align:start position:0%
to be really
 
03:06:55.349 --> 03:06:55.359 align:start position:0%
difficult to tell but when he can bring
 
03:06:56.870 --> 03:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
that up
 
03:07:00.230 --> 03:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
on the effects that they were looking at
 
03:07:02.469 --> 03:07:02.479 align:start position:0%
had a lot to do with what the federal
 
03:07:03.429 --> 03:07:03.439 align:start position:0%
aid was
 
03:07:07.830 --> 03:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
the federal aid last year
 
03:07:09.830 --> 03:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
is going to be different from the
 
03:07:11.990 --> 03:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
federal aid this year they probably
 
03:07:14.710 --> 03:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
aren't going to be prioritizing the
 
03:07:16.630 --> 03:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
large corporations
 
03:07:18.070 --> 03:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
which are the ones that give us our
 
03:07:18.080 --> 03:07:19.910 align:start position:0%
which are the ones that give us our
money

03:07:19.910 --> 03:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
money
 
03:07:22.550 --> 03:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
and we i don't know if there's any way
 
03:07:24.710 --> 03:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
we can find out how that one's
 
03:07:26.870 --> 03:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
going we could talk to our congress
 
03:07:26.880 --> 03:07:28.070 align:start position:0%
going we could talk to our congress
people

03:07:28.070 --> 03:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:07:28.080 --> 03:07:29.429 align:start position:0%
people
[Music]

03:07:29.429 --> 03:07:29.439 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:07:33.510 --> 03:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
and get and get an idea of that maybe
 
03:07:36.710 --> 03:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
but it's not our current law
 
03:07:39.910 --> 03:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
i but i think that it's it's part of our
 
03:07:42.710 --> 03:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
environment that uh they're going to be
 
03:07:42.720 --> 03:07:43.429 align:start position:0%
environment that uh they're going to be
changing

03:07:43.429 --> 03:07:43.439 align:start position:0%
changing
 
03:07:47.030 --> 03:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
their law about and probably
 
03:07:49.510 --> 03:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
about the large corporations which are
 
03:07:51.030 --> 03:07:51.040 align:start position:0%
the ones we get
 
03:07:54.230 --> 03:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
most of our business tax revenue from
 
03:07:56.790 --> 03:07:56.800 align:start position:0%
and i don't know how that's going to end
 
03:07:56.800 --> 03:07:57.590 align:start position:0%
and i don't know how that's going to end
oh

03:07:57.590 --> 03:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
oh
 
03:08:02.070 --> 03:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
none of us do but it was page 22 i was
 
03:08:03.269 --> 03:08:03.279 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
03:08:05.590 --> 03:08:05.600 align:start position:0%
yep no i just want i was just bouncing
 
03:08:12.630 --> 03:08:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:15.750 --> 03:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
so the shift in business behaviors all
 
03:08:17.990 --> 03:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh and the federal stimulus money and
 
03:08:20.389 --> 03:08:20.399 align:start position:0%
all of that came out of covet but it was
 
03:08:20.399 --> 03:08:21.030 align:start position:0%
all of that came out of covet but it was
the

03:08:21.030 --> 03:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:08:25.110 --> 03:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
the first on
 
03:08:28.070 --> 03:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
first way of looking at it and it was
 
03:08:30.630 --> 03:08:30.640 align:start position:0%
under a republican administration
 
03:08:33.349 --> 03:08:33.359 align:start position:0%
and the second way of looking at it is
 
03:08:33.990 --> 03:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
03:08:37.110 --> 03:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
under a democratic one
 
03:08:39.830 --> 03:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
which is more concerned with the smaller
 
03:08:39.840 --> 03:08:42.070 align:start position:0%
which is more concerned with the smaller
businesses

03:08:42.070 --> 03:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
03:08:45.269 --> 03:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
and with with ordinary
 
03:08:49.429 --> 03:08:49.439 align:start position:0%
citizens it it'll be
 
03:08:52.150 --> 03:08:52.160 align:start position:0%
interesting to see what they're doing
 
03:08:53.670 --> 03:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
and it'll probably
 
03:08:56.550 --> 03:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
influence our business tax revenues a
 
03:08:57.750 --> 03:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
fair amount
 
03:09:00.150 --> 03:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
i don't know what we do about that and
 
03:09:02.230 --> 03:09:02.240 align:start position:0%
then as you can see the future outlook
 
03:09:03.830 --> 03:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
is lifted restrictions
 
03:09:07.030 --> 03:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
vaccine and an improvement in economy
 
03:09:07.040 --> 03:09:08.150 align:start position:0%
vaccine and an improvement in economy
which

03:09:08.150 --> 03:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
which
 
03:09:17.110 --> 03:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
i think is dependent on that
 
03:09:20.469 --> 03:09:20.479 align:start position:0%
representative abrami
 
03:09:23.190 --> 03:09:23.200 align:start position:0%
another variable uh that we should uh
 
03:09:24.550 --> 03:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
take into mom
 
03:09:27.030 --> 03:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
let's there's some there's action in the
 
03:09:27.990 --> 03:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
senate right now
 
03:09:31.910 --> 03:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
on the ppp program and whether
 
03:09:35.110 --> 03:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
uh the uh ppp
 
03:09:39.990 --> 03:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh forgiven money is taxable or not
 
03:09:42.630 --> 03:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
and uh the senate has a bill that
 
03:09:42.640 --> 03:09:43.349 align:start position:0%
and uh the senate has a bill that
they're

03:09:43.349 --> 03:09:43.359 align:start position:0%
they're
 
03:09:46.070 --> 03:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
going to be acting on but we're we're a
 
03:09:47.910 --> 03:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
non-conforming state
 
03:09:50.389 --> 03:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
for the new members we don't when the
 
03:09:50.399 --> 03:09:51.030 align:start position:0%
for the new members we don't when the
federal

03:09:51.030 --> 03:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
federal
 
03:09:53.429 --> 03:09:53.439 align:start position:0%
when the federal law changes in relation
 
03:09:54.950 --> 03:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
to taxes
 
03:09:57.269 --> 03:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
many states will say well we'll make
 
03:09:58.550 --> 03:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
them part of our
 
03:10:00.950 --> 03:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
our statutes if you will or their
 
03:10:00.960 --> 03:10:02.389 align:start position:0%
our statutes if you will or their
statutes

03:10:02.389 --> 03:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
03:10:04.469 --> 03:10:04.479 align:start position:0%
ours on our state we don't we decided
 
03:10:05.990 --> 03:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
and we had a lot of discussion in our
 
03:10:08.229 --> 03:10:08.239 align:start position:0%
committee over the years about this
 
03:10:11.030 --> 03:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
we we are conforming based on a report
 
03:10:12.710 --> 03:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
that we get in march
 
03:10:15.510 --> 03:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
i think it's march from dra as to
 
03:10:16.870 --> 03:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
03:10:19.030 --> 03:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
they list all the the federal tax law
 
03:10:19.040 --> 03:10:20.790 align:start position:0%
they list all the the federal tax law
changes

03:10:20.790 --> 03:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
changes
 
03:10:22.710 --> 03:10:22.720 align:start position:0%
uh and then we make a decision as to
 
03:10:25.110 --> 03:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
which ones we want to conform to
 
03:10:26.550 --> 03:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
so right now we're a non-conforming
 
03:10:29.429 --> 03:10:29.439 align:start position:0%
state and our statutes are 2018 that we
 
03:10:30.710 --> 03:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
go by
 
03:10:33.030 --> 03:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
so this is where the rub is right now
 
03:10:35.510 --> 03:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
the ppp program made a change in their
 
03:10:39.349 --> 03:10:39.359 align:start position:0%
in the statutes that are
 
03:10:42.790 --> 03:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
different than what our statutes are
 
03:10:45.830 --> 03:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
and because in the in the federal
 
03:10:47.670 --> 03:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
statutes it says specifically under
 
03:10:49.830 --> 03:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
federal law loan amounts received by
 
03:10:51.910 --> 03:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
taxpayers from paycheck protection
 
03:10:51.920 --> 03:10:52.830 align:start position:0%
taxpayers from paycheck protection
program

03:10:52.830 --> 03:10:52.840 align:start position:0%
program
 
03:10:56.550 --> 03:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
ppp that are forgiven will not be
 
03:10:59.510 --> 03:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
included in taxable income federally and
 
03:10:59.520 --> 03:11:00.469 align:start position:0%
included in taxable income federally and
businesses

03:11:00.469 --> 03:11:00.479 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
03:11:03.349 --> 03:11:03.359 align:start position:0%
business expenses paid for with forgiven
 
03:11:06.630 --> 03:11:06.640 align:start position:0%
ppp loans can be deducted
 
03:11:09.910 --> 03:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
now our our statutes are the same except
 
03:11:13.030 --> 03:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
in our case uh
 
03:11:17.030 --> 03:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh can be conducted
 
03:11:18.550 --> 03:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
ours reads under the current new
 
03:11:21.110 --> 03:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire bbt statute loan amounts
 
03:11:21.120 --> 03:11:21.990 align:start position:0%
hampshire bbt statute loan amounts
received

03:11:21.990 --> 03:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
received
 
03:11:25.030 --> 03:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
by new hampshire taxes from ppp that are
 
03:11:25.040 --> 03:11:25.670 align:start position:0%
by new hampshire taxes from ppp that are
forgiven

03:11:25.670 --> 03:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
forgiven
 
03:11:28.070 --> 03:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
will be included in taxable income for
 
03:11:29.750 --> 03:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
wptp purposes
 
03:11:33.590 --> 03:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
and business tax expense paid for
 
03:11:37.190 --> 03:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
for with foreign ppp loans can be
 
03:11:41.590 --> 03:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
can be deducted so so
 
03:11:45.110 --> 03:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a difference in the
 
03:11:48.469 --> 03:11:48.479 align:start position:0%
business expense uh issue so i don't
 
03:11:50.229 --> 03:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
want to spend much time on it now but i
 
03:11:51.349 --> 03:11:51.359 align:start position:0%
think it's something that's going to
 
03:11:52.070 --> 03:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
come to us
 
03:11:55.190 --> 03:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
and fairly soon but but when we're
 
03:11:57.030 --> 03:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
having this discussion
 
03:11:58.950 --> 03:11:58.960 align:start position:0%
we are not conforming with the federal
 
03:12:00.710 --> 03:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
law so i would say that
 
03:12:04.070 --> 03:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
we can continue to project as we are our
 
03:12:05.429 --> 03:12:05.439 align:start position:0%
business taxes on
 
03:12:08.309 --> 03:12:08.319 align:start position:0%
what we perceive as current law not on
 
03:12:10.710 --> 03:12:10.720 align:start position:0%
what the federal government thinks said
 
03:12:12.790 --> 03:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
you know uh our statute should be
 
03:12:14.229 --> 03:12:14.239 align:start position:0%
because we haven't adopted
 
03:12:18.389 --> 03:12:18.399 align:start position:0%
those those the federal uh laws so it's
 
03:12:20.550 --> 03:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
kind of a complicated thing but i think
 
03:12:21.910 --> 03:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
it's worth mentioning that there's
 
03:12:23.349 --> 03:12:23.359 align:start position:0%
something on the horizon that we're
 
03:12:24.790 --> 03:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
going to all be dealing with
 
03:12:28.790 --> 03:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
if the senate passes their bill
 
03:12:30.710 --> 03:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
we will be dealing with it i hadn't
 
03:12:32.150 --> 03:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
brought it up because we're
 
03:12:34.469 --> 03:12:34.479 align:start position:0%
dealing with current law right now yeah
 
03:12:36.070 --> 03:12:36.080 align:start position:0%
but i wanted to but just to
 
03:12:39.349 --> 03:12:39.359 align:start position:0%
just to complete that is that even
 
03:12:40.950 --> 03:12:40.960 align:start position:0%
though we don't conform
 
03:12:44.830 --> 03:12:44.840 align:start position:0%
the federal government our laws does say
 
03:12:47.590 --> 03:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
that if you use it for what it was
 
03:12:47.600 --> 03:12:48.309 align:start position:0%
that if you use it for what it was
intended

03:12:48.309 --> 03:12:48.319 align:start position:0%
intended
 
03:12:51.510 --> 03:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
it's at least 60 percent
 
03:12:55.190 --> 03:12:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:58.229 --> 03:12:58.239 align:start position:0%
and then you can ex expense
 
03:13:01.349 --> 03:13:01.359 align:start position:0%
the money and then if you use it
 
03:13:04.309 --> 03:13:04.319 align:start position:0%
all for expenses then there's no taxes
 
03:13:06.469 --> 03:13:06.479 align:start position:0%
on it
 
03:13:09.510 --> 03:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
but we'll have that discussion
 
03:13:13.990 --> 03:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
when the time comes
 
03:13:17.590 --> 03:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
max representative
 
03:13:20.229 --> 03:13:20.239 align:start position:0%
thank you i'd just like to correct a
 
03:13:22.389 --> 03:13:22.399 align:start position:0%
small piece of that well it wasn't so
 
03:13:22.399 --> 03:13:23.269 align:start position:0%
small piece of that well it wasn't so
small

03:13:23.269 --> 03:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
small
 
03:13:26.830 --> 03:13:26.840 align:start position:0%
on the senate last year on
 
03:13:30.229 --> 03:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
avoided completely are our plan
 
03:13:33.349 --> 03:13:33.359 align:start position:0%
to have a conformity discussed
 
03:13:37.110 --> 03:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
in march this year on because
 
03:13:39.910 --> 03:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
they wanted to stick conformity in
 
03:13:41.990 --> 03:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
various parts of conformity
 
03:13:45.190 --> 03:13:45.200 align:start position:0%
with the federal law law from 17
 
03:13:48.229 --> 03:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
in on in the budget
 
03:13:51.269 --> 03:13:51.279 align:start position:0%
and parts that increased the revenues
 
03:13:54.469 --> 03:13:54.479 align:start position:0%
or probably would increase the revenues
 
03:13:57.670 --> 03:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
and they put those into hb4
 
03:13:59.830 --> 03:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
and they're operating now and they are
 
03:14:01.590 --> 03:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
current current law
 
03:14:05.030 --> 03:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
but they did not touch the ppp loans
 
03:14:08.150 --> 03:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
at that point we've conformed with most
 
03:14:09.110 --> 03:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
of the things
 
03:14:13.429 --> 03:14:13.439 align:start position:0%
that were in the fy 17 changes that we
 
03:14:15.510 --> 03:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
hadn't already decided in the past not
 
03:14:18.630 --> 03:14:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:21.750 --> 03:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
but on and i don't
 
03:14:25.030 --> 03:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
think um i got a letter
 
03:14:28.070 --> 03:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
on at the end of last year i think
 
03:14:29.830 --> 03:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
talking about the conformity which i
 
03:14:32.150 --> 03:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
passed on to representative major
 
03:14:34.790 --> 03:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
on and essentially there wasn't much
 
03:14:34.800 --> 03:14:35.190 align:start position:0%
on and essentially there wasn't much
less

03:14:35.190 --> 03:14:35.200 align:start position:0%
less
 
03:14:37.110 --> 03:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
left to talk about because the senate
 
03:14:39.269 --> 03:14:39.279 align:start position:0%
had already grabbed it and insisted on
 
03:14:41.750 --> 03:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
it being in the budget
 
03:14:43.510 --> 03:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
camera susan i can't recall but i think
 
03:14:45.429 --> 03:14:45.439 align:start position:0%
one of the big issues was section 178
 
03:14:46.710 --> 03:14:46.720 align:start position:0%
and federal law about accelerated
 
03:14:46.720 --> 03:14:48.870 align:start position:0%
and federal law about accelerated
depreciation

03:14:48.870 --> 03:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
depreciation
 
03:14:51.670 --> 03:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
yes that one we avoid that won't be did
 
03:14:53.110 --> 03:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
senate agree with us on that i can't
 
03:14:53.120 --> 03:14:55.429 align:start position:0%
senate agree with us on that i can't
recall

03:14:55.429 --> 03:14:55.439 align:start position:0%
recall
 
03:14:57.990 --> 03:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
and they they didn't want to to use it
 
03:15:00.469 --> 03:15:00.479 align:start position:0%
because accelerated depreciation reduces
 
03:15:01.510 --> 03:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
your evidence
 
03:15:04.790 --> 03:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
right right okay so they agreed with us
 
03:15:06.550 --> 03:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
on that one thank you
 
03:15:09.590 --> 03:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
yeah and the committee will
 
03:15:14.870 --> 03:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
get an education on this whole process
 
03:15:19.030 --> 03:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
of the irs the federal ir
 
03:15:23.510 --> 03:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
code compared to what we do
 
03:15:27.510 --> 03:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
and especially when it comes to
 
03:15:31.429 --> 03:15:31.439 align:start position:0%
a ppp loan and we'll have that when
 
03:15:35.110 --> 03:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
senate bill 3 comes over but we still
 
03:15:38.790 --> 03:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
need to stick to the current law
 
03:15:42.870 --> 03:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
next uh there are no more hands
 
03:15:46.070 --> 03:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
okay this is a definitely hold
 
03:15:50.070 --> 03:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
so we need to go now to the
 
03:15:57.590 --> 03:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:14.830 --> 03:16:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:14.840 --> 03:16:21.590 align:start position:0%
 
my

03:16:21.590 --> 03:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:27.990 --> 03:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:47.030 --> 03:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:48.630 --> 03:16:48.640 align:start position:0%
well he's doing that interest in
 
03:16:48.640 --> 03:16:50.469 align:start position:0%
well he's doing that interest in
dividend

03:16:50.469 --> 03:16:50.479 align:start position:0%
dividend
 
03:16:51.990 --> 03:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
has been doing good this year we're
 
03:16:56.150 --> 03:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
about 45 percent have had a plan
 
03:16:59.429 --> 03:16:59.439 align:start position:0%
to date the big money comes in
 
03:17:02.229 --> 03:17:02.239 align:start position:0%
in april and they can they could put us
 
03:17:02.239 --> 03:17:03.030 align:start position:0%
in april and they can they could put us
below

03:17:03.030 --> 03:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
below
 
03:17:05.590 --> 03:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
the low plan but the bulk of the money
 
03:17:22.790 --> 03:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:24.710 --> 03:17:24.720 align:start position:0%
so you should see the start of their
 
03:17:25.990 --> 03:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
presentation on the interest and
 
03:17:26.000 --> 03:17:32.150 align:start position:0%
presentation on the interest and
dividends

03:17:32.150 --> 03:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:34.070 --> 03:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
the pie charts showing you um the
 
03:17:35.429 --> 03:17:35.439 align:start position:0%
breakdown of how
 
03:17:38.830 --> 03:17:38.840 align:start position:0%
what's paid interest dividends
 
03:17:38.840 --> 03:17:41.349 align:start position:0%
what's paid interest dividends
distributions

03:17:41.349 --> 03:17:41.359 align:start position:0%
distributions
 
03:17:43.269 --> 03:17:43.279 align:start position:0%
individuals versus partnerships in the
 
03:17:43.279 --> 03:17:49.670 align:start position:0%
individuals versus partnerships in the
states

03:17:49.670 --> 03:17:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:51.190 --> 03:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
you've heard mentioned of the the
 
03:17:53.110 --> 03:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
triangles there's one for the ind as
 
03:17:55.429 --> 03:17:55.439 align:start position:0%
well so you can see
 
03:17:58.710 --> 03:17:58.720 align:start position:0%
of the taxpayers generally what they've
 
03:17:58.720 --> 03:17:59.750 align:start position:0%
of the taxpayers generally what they've
paid

03:17:59.750 --> 03:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
paid
 
03:18:02.950 --> 03:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
not individual with that group let me
 
03:18:02.960 --> 03:18:03.590 align:start position:0%
not individual with that group let me
interrupt

03:18:03.590 --> 03:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
interrupt
 
03:18:07.590 --> 03:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
here this triangle picture showed the
 
03:18:11.990 --> 03:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
interest and dividend the bet the bpt
 
03:18:14.229 --> 03:18:14.239 align:start position:0%
you should make copies of this and have
 
03:18:15.269 --> 03:18:15.279 align:start position:0%
it available to
 
03:18:18.309 --> 03:18:18.319 align:start position:0%
always refer to but this tells you
 
03:18:22.389 --> 03:18:22.399 align:start position:0%
who's the major taxpayers here
 
03:18:28.389 --> 03:18:28.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:32.550 --> 03:18:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:36.309 --> 03:18:36.319 align:start position:0%
is paid by a
 
03:18:42.550 --> 03:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:45.750 --> 03:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:53.750 --> 03:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:56.870 --> 03:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
and so here's their trending line from
 
03:19:00.550 --> 03:19:00.560 align:start position:0%
2011 through 2020
 
03:19:02.710 --> 03:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
and as you can see at the bottom of the
 
03:19:03.590 --> 03:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
chart they
 
03:19:04.790 --> 03:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
give you the rate and then they give you
 
03:19:06.070 --> 03:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
some things that could influence the
 
03:19:06.080 --> 03:19:09.030 align:start position:0%
some things that could influence the
revenue

03:19:09.030 --> 03:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:10.790 --> 03:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
including the economy the stock market
 
03:19:12.309 --> 03:19:12.319 align:start position:0%
performance interest rates
 
03:19:14.389 --> 03:19:14.399 align:start position:0%
federal tax reform and money in the bank
 
03:19:16.830 --> 03:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
were all things that they
 
03:19:16.840 --> 03:19:18.790 align:start position:0%
were all things that they
identified

03:19:18.790 --> 03:19:18.800 align:start position:0%
identified
 
03:19:20.950 --> 03:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
and that's um that's all their
 
03:19:22.469 --> 03:19:22.479 align:start position:0%
presentation at the end is the
 
03:19:25.269 --> 03:19:25.279 align:start position:0%
the estimates but this is what they um
 
03:19:26.950 --> 03:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
one of the taxes that they came in
 
03:19:30.070 --> 03:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
last week and because uh january
 
03:19:31.269 --> 03:19:31.279 align:start position:0%
did a little bit better than they
 
03:19:33.429 --> 03:19:33.439 align:start position:0%
expected they revised the
 
03:19:35.790 --> 03:19:35.800 align:start position:0%
um high point that's the increase to the
 
03:19:35.800 --> 03:19:38.229 align:start position:0%
um high point that's the increase to the
135.5

03:19:38.229 --> 03:19:38.239 align:start position:0%
135.5
 
03:19:39.670 --> 03:19:39.680 align:start position:0%
that we discussed at the beginning of
 
03:19:42.070 --> 03:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
today do you go back to the
 
03:19:45.750 --> 03:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
one that has the triangle please yep
 
03:19:45.760 --> 03:19:52.389 align:start position:0%
one that has the triangle please yep
so

03:19:52.389 --> 03:19:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:58.710 --> 03:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:01.910 --> 03:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
is that we do need to study it i see
 
03:20:01.920 --> 03:20:02.710 align:start position:0%
is that we do need to study it i see
that

03:20:02.710 --> 03:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:20:06.950 --> 03:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
that's a really interesting term i think
 
03:20:09.670 --> 03:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
number of people are very high in some
 
03:20:09.680 --> 03:20:10.389 align:start position:0%
number of people are very high in some
places

03:20:10.389 --> 03:20:10.399 align:start position:0%
places
 
03:20:13.349 --> 03:20:13.359 align:start position:0%
but the income is low but then the
 
03:20:15.590 --> 03:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
income is high from a very few people
 
03:20:19.830 --> 03:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
so somehow you can see why
 
03:20:22.150 --> 03:20:22.160 align:start position:0%
not people with modest incomes feel like
 
03:20:24.150 --> 03:20:24.160 align:start position:0%
they're really hard hit
 
03:20:25.830 --> 03:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
by the fact that they were frugal
 
03:20:28.710 --> 03:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
through their lives
 
03:20:32.070 --> 03:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
and they don't feel like they're rich
 
03:20:36.870 --> 03:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
because they're not from income sourcing
 
03:20:39.030 --> 03:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
you have less than two less than three
 
03:20:39.040 --> 03:20:40.150 align:start position:0%
you have less than two less than three
percent

03:20:40.150 --> 03:20:40.160 align:start position:0%
percent
 
03:20:43.349 --> 03:20:43.359 align:start position:0%
of the people pay 50 for tax
 
03:20:45.910 --> 03:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
right and so you have all these people
 
03:20:45.920 --> 03:20:47.349 align:start position:0%
right and so you have all these people
who

03:20:47.349 --> 03:20:47.359 align:start position:0%
who
 
03:20:51.750 --> 03:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
are paying it who have been
 
03:20:54.229 --> 03:20:54.239 align:start position:0%
who aren't part of a wealthy group and
 
03:20:55.190 --> 03:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
they are
 
03:20:57.830 --> 03:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
thought of as wealthy and are being
 
03:20:59.910 --> 03:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
asked to pay something
 
03:21:03.750 --> 03:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
in a state where people don't pay much
 
03:21:06.229 --> 03:21:06.239 align:start position:0%
to the government so it's just a
 
03:21:11.910 --> 03:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:13.910 --> 03:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
and on the fact that it's just a few
 
03:21:15.510 --> 03:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
people who pay most
 
03:21:18.550 --> 03:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
we can also focus on the fact that large
 
03:21:20.070 --> 03:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
numbers of people
 
03:21:24.070 --> 03:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
who don't have a lot of income are
 
03:21:27.030 --> 03:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
are paying something and they're feeling
 
03:21:28.229 --> 03:21:28.239 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:21:35.269 --> 03:21:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:39.110 --> 03:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
this chart along with the b and the bpt
 
03:21:46.150 --> 03:21:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:49.429 --> 03:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
okay um what's next uh
 
03:21:53.510 --> 03:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
representative hillary
 
03:21:56.630 --> 03:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
uh i don't know if everyone is aware but
 
03:21:58.790 --> 03:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
tennessee did a phased-in
 
03:22:01.670 --> 03:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
elimination of their ind over the last
 
03:22:02.790 --> 03:22:02.800 align:start position:0%
four years
 
03:22:04.870 --> 03:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
i've reached out to some people i i know
 
03:22:06.950 --> 03:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
in tennessee
 
03:22:09.990 --> 03:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
on the legislature through alec and i've
 
03:22:10.000 --> 03:22:10.630 align:start position:0%
on the legislature through alec and i've
asked

03:22:10.630 --> 03:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
asked
 
03:22:12.710 --> 03:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
for them to provide me with some
 
03:22:14.630 --> 03:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
information i'm waiting for it
 
03:22:17.910 --> 03:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
the what i've been told orally not
 
03:22:20.630 --> 03:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
with documentation yet their phase out
 
03:22:21.830 --> 03:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
over four years
 
03:22:24.550 --> 03:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
had no significant impact on their
 
03:22:24.560 --> 03:22:25.190 align:start position:0%
had no significant impact on their
budget

03:22:25.190 --> 03:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
budget
 
03:22:27.830 --> 03:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
and it's a much larger budget than that
 
03:22:28.950 --> 03:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
03:22:31.510 --> 03:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
so just we'll see what that information
 
03:22:33.429 --> 03:22:33.439 align:start position:0%
is and just letting you know that
 
03:22:37.110 --> 03:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
it's uh coming in whenever it gets here
 
03:22:40.469 --> 03:22:40.479 align:start position:0%
jordan their interest
 
03:22:42.870 --> 03:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
in dividend tax is what percentage of
 
03:22:45.190 --> 03:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
the total
 
03:22:48.309 --> 03:22:48.319 align:start position:0%
it's just it's uh well i
 
03:22:50.710 --> 03:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
i don't know for sure i'll i'll get that
 
03:22:53.910 --> 03:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
information and and get it out to you
 
03:22:56.710 --> 03:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
i just didn't ask that thing but it uh
 
03:22:56.720 --> 03:22:57.269 align:start position:0%
i just didn't ask that thing but it uh
it's

03:22:57.269 --> 03:22:57.279 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:23:00.229 --> 03:23:00.239 align:start position:0%
it's was a significant chunk of money
 
03:23:01.349 --> 03:23:01.359 align:start position:0%
for the
 
03:23:05.349 --> 03:23:05.359 align:start position:0%
volunteer state um not as much as jack
 
03:23:07.030 --> 03:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
daniels gives them but it was still a
 
03:23:07.040 --> 03:23:07.750 align:start position:0%
daniels gives them but it was still a
significant

03:23:07.750 --> 03:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
significant
 
03:23:21.349 --> 03:23:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:24.790 --> 03:23:24.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman on
 
03:23:27.429 --> 03:23:27.439 align:start position:0%
as long as we're on this chart i'm i
 
03:23:28.830 --> 03:23:28.840 align:start position:0%
want to talk to that
 
03:23:32.070 --> 03:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
first um but
 
03:23:36.150 --> 03:23:36.160 align:start position:0%
on the this is very different from the
 
03:23:38.150 --> 03:23:38.160 align:start position:0%
business profits business enterprise
 
03:23:39.910 --> 03:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
taxes because those
 
03:23:43.269 --> 03:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
are based well the profits tax is
 
03:23:46.469 --> 03:23:46.479 align:start position:0%
based on your income uh
 
03:23:49.830 --> 03:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
on the on the total income profits
 
03:23:54.150 --> 03:23:54.160 align:start position:0%
of the uh corporation the entity
 
03:23:58.150 --> 03:23:58.160 align:start position:0%
that we're taxing whereas in this case
 
03:24:00.950 --> 03:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
we have wealthy people and poor people
 
03:24:03.590 --> 03:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
mixed into
 
03:24:05.670 --> 03:24:05.680 align:start position:0%
the entire to large parts of the
 
03:24:05.680 --> 03:24:06.950 align:start position:0%
the entire to large parts of the
triangle

03:24:06.950 --> 03:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
triangle
 
03:24:10.150 --> 03:24:10.160 align:start position:0%
uh people who are
 
03:24:14.309 --> 03:24:14.319 align:start position:0%
getting a thousand uh paying a thousand
 
03:24:18.309 --> 03:24:18.319 align:start position:0%
dollars who have an income
 
03:24:21.590 --> 03:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
from would have an income from uh
 
03:24:25.590 --> 03:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
of twenty thousand dollars from
 
03:24:28.630 --> 03:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
from the interest dividends
 
03:24:31.110 --> 03:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
distributions and that's all they're
 
03:24:32.790 --> 03:24:32.800 align:start position:0%
living on
 
03:24:35.990 --> 03:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
other many many others in that category
 
03:24:39.030 --> 03:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
would be on wealthy people that put a
 
03:24:40.710 --> 03:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
little bit of their
 
03:24:43.830 --> 03:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
their money in interest on
 
03:24:47.110 --> 03:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
high interest or high dividend uh
 
03:24:50.550 --> 03:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
stocks and and bank accounts
 
03:24:54.550 --> 03:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
so on you've it's not really
 
03:24:57.510 --> 03:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
showing the wealth of the people in
 
03:24:59.269 --> 03:24:59.279 align:start position:0%
those different sectors until you get
 
03:25:00.870 --> 03:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
way up in the
 
03:25:03.670 --> 03:25:03.680 align:start position:0%
in the people someone who's paying 50k
 
03:25:05.670 --> 03:25:05.680 align:start position:0%
an entity it would be that was paying
 
03:25:08.710 --> 03:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
50k in taxes
 
03:25:11.910 --> 03:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
would have uh on
 
03:25:15.750 --> 03:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
what is it a hundred million no two
 
03:25:19.110 --> 03:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
two million of of interest
 
03:25:22.950 --> 03:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
and dividends and distributions
 
03:25:25.910 --> 03:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
so they are highly unlikely to be poor
 
03:25:25.920 --> 03:25:27.590 align:start position:0%
so they are highly unlikely to be poor
people

03:25:27.590 --> 03:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:25:29.990 --> 03:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
but and then we've got the people down
 
03:25:30.000 --> 03:25:31.110 align:start position:0%
but and then we've got the people down
at

03:25:31.110 --> 03:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
at
 
03:25:35.349 --> 03:25:35.359 align:start position:0%
at twenty dollars of interest up to
 
03:25:37.670 --> 03:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
to a thousand dollars of interest at the
 
03:25:38.870 --> 03:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
bottom there
 
03:25:42.389 --> 03:25:42.399 align:start position:0%
so so that's another way to look at that
 
03:25:42.399 --> 03:25:43.110 align:start position:0%
so so that's another way to look at that
chart

03:25:43.110 --> 03:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
chart
 
03:25:45.110 --> 03:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
it's very different from the other two
 
03:25:45.120 --> 03:25:46.630 align:start position:0%
it's very different from the other two
triangles

03:25:46.630 --> 03:25:46.640 align:start position:0%
triangles
 
03:25:50.710 --> 03:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
um but interest on
 
03:25:53.750 --> 03:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
what i'm my question originally was is
 
03:25:57.590 --> 03:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
that on we were assuming
 
03:26:00.710 --> 03:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
uh when you look at at the growth
 
03:26:04.469 --> 03:26:04.479 align:start position:0%
of the intern
 
03:26:07.110 --> 03:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
you accidentally muted yourself the
 
03:26:07.120 --> 03:26:07.590 align:start position:0%
you accidentally muted yourself the
growth

03:26:07.590 --> 03:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
growth
 
03:26:09.590 --> 03:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
sorry the growth of the interest and
 
03:26:11.110 --> 03:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
dividend stacks
 
03:26:11.120 --> 03:26:11.510 align:start position:0%
dividend stacks
um

03:26:11.510 --> 03:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:11.520 --> 03:26:15.349 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

03:26:15.349 --> 03:26:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:18.710 --> 03:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
in the last few years
 
03:26:23.349 --> 03:26:23.359 align:start position:0%
when they did on they did the federal
 
03:26:27.030 --> 03:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
end of 17 tax return
 
03:26:30.309 --> 03:26:30.319 align:start position:0%
tax reform and they
 
03:26:33.590 --> 03:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
produced an incentive for for not as
 
03:26:35.150 --> 03:26:35.160 align:start position:0%
much as they thought but
 
03:26:37.990 --> 03:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
repatriations coming back from overseas
 
03:26:41.110 --> 03:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
of money to american corporations
 
03:26:43.070 --> 03:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
and they were um
 
03:26:43.080 --> 03:26:44.229 align:start position:0%
and they were um
[Music]

03:26:44.229 --> 03:26:44.239 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:26:46.309 --> 03:26:46.319 align:start position:0%
we were assuming that they were going to
 
03:26:47.429 --> 03:26:47.439 align:start position:0%
be pushing
 
03:26:50.389 --> 03:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
on part of this the corporations would
 
03:26:51.429 --> 03:26:51.439 align:start position:0%
put some of this
 
03:26:54.710 --> 03:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
out and increased on
 
03:26:58.070 --> 03:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
dividends and i presume distributions
 
03:27:00.070 --> 03:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
and that it was going to show up and
 
03:27:02.229 --> 03:27:02.239 align:start position:0%
that's what we
 
03:27:05.190 --> 03:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
thought we saw coming towards the end of
 
03:27:05.200 --> 03:27:05.750 align:start position:0%
thought we saw coming towards the end of
fy

03:27:05.750 --> 03:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
fy
 
03:27:09.110 --> 03:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
18 and and especially in fy
 
03:27:13.510 --> 03:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
19 increasing the tax and
 
03:27:15.590 --> 03:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
and i believe representative ames was
 
03:27:16.630 --> 03:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
03:27:20.469 --> 03:27:20.479 align:start position:0%
it showing up in fy 20 as well
 
03:27:22.469 --> 03:27:22.479 align:start position:0%
we don't real i mean that should be
 
03:27:24.550 --> 03:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
dying down at this point but
 
03:27:34.550 --> 03:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:38.389 --> 03:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
thanks representative abrami
 
03:27:40.870 --> 03:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
yeah just one more point on that uh the
 
03:27:40.880 --> 03:27:41.670 align:start position:0%
yeah just one more point on that uh the
triangle

03:27:41.670 --> 03:27:41.680 align:start position:0%
triangle
 
03:27:43.510 --> 03:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
i think representative romney was
 
03:27:44.790 --> 03:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
pointing out
 
03:27:47.269 --> 03:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
so yeah that what it's showing there is
 
03:27:48.870 --> 03:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
how much tax is actually paid to make
 
03:27:50.790 --> 03:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
sure no one's confused about that
 
03:27:53.750 --> 03:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
and that 50k i just said the math so
 
03:27:55.510 --> 03:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
that would mean that that investor that
 
03:27:55.520 --> 03:27:56.070 align:start position:0%
that would mean that that investor that
that

03:27:56.070 --> 03:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:27:59.269 --> 03:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
individual had a million dollars of uh
 
03:28:01.429 --> 03:28:01.439 align:start position:0%
interest and dividend uh revenue coming
 
03:28:03.349 --> 03:28:03.359 align:start position:0%
to them for their investments
 
03:28:06.150 --> 03:28:06.160 align:start position:0%
so five percent of that is 50k so i want
 
03:28:07.910 --> 03:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
to make sure everybody understands
 
03:28:10.070 --> 03:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
what we're looking at there so there
 
03:28:12.550 --> 03:28:12.560 align:start position:0%
really aren't that many people that have
 
03:28:16.070 --> 03:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
well it looks like 131 people in the
 
03:28:17.510 --> 03:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
state that have that kind of
 
03:28:20.309 --> 03:28:20.319 align:start position:0%
uh interest and dividend income coming
 
03:28:22.070 --> 03:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
to them
 
03:28:25.429 --> 03:28:25.439 align:start position:0%
and um the other thing is that interest
 
03:28:28.710 --> 03:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
interest rates are still so low we know
 
03:28:30.150 --> 03:28:30.160 align:start position:0%
that most of this has to be coming from
 
03:28:33.670 --> 03:28:33.680 align:start position:0%
dividends uh because
 
03:28:35.990 --> 03:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
even our treasury is saying we don't
 
03:28:37.429 --> 03:28:37.439 align:start position:0%
even estimate how much
 
03:28:40.150 --> 03:28:40.160 align:start position:0%
but we don't really get much in uh in in
 
03:28:40.160 --> 03:28:41.590 align:start position:0%
but we don't really get much in uh in in
interest

03:28:41.590 --> 03:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
interest
 
03:28:44.710 --> 03:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
from putting our money in the bank but
 
03:28:47.349 --> 03:28:47.359 align:start position:0%
the stock market's doing well um and the
 
03:28:48.790 --> 03:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
stock market's been doing well
 
03:28:50.870 --> 03:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
for for a bunch of years now and it
 
03:28:52.710 --> 03:28:52.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to be slowing down
 
03:28:55.030 --> 03:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
and that you know whether that's an
 
03:28:55.040 --> 03:28:55.910 align:start position:0%
and that you know whether that's an
aberration

03:28:55.910 --> 03:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
aberration
 
03:28:59.429 --> 03:28:59.439 align:start position:0%
or uh uh there's a lot of dollars
 
03:29:01.349 --> 03:29:01.359 align:start position:0%
sitting on the sidelines right now
 
03:29:03.269 --> 03:29:03.279 align:start position:0%
with people looking for places to put it
 
03:29:06.469 --> 03:29:06.479 align:start position:0%
so they're putting it in the market
 
03:29:10.150 --> 03:29:10.160 align:start position:0%
but you know but what really drives
 
03:29:11.590 --> 03:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
dividends is the company's actually
 
03:29:12.630 --> 03:29:12.640 align:start position:0%
doing well
 
03:29:15.110 --> 03:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh and that didn't decide to to share
 
03:29:16.070 --> 03:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
that that
 
03:29:19.510 --> 03:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
profit with the shareholders
 
03:29:22.550 --> 03:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
so obviously that's where dra must be
 
03:29:24.389 --> 03:29:24.399 align:start position:0%
thinking the money's coming from
 
03:29:28.630 --> 03:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
from that that kind of uh optimism
 
03:29:32.070 --> 03:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
um that that's just my observations
 
03:29:36.790 --> 03:29:36.800 align:start position:0%
only 13 of that is from interest
 
03:29:43.110 --> 03:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:47.590 --> 03:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:50.870 --> 03:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
and distributions as well um it's close
 
03:29:52.630 --> 03:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
to 40.
 
03:29:55.030 --> 03:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
which is in other kinds of like the s
 
03:29:56.630 --> 03:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
corpse and so forth the thing we were
 
03:29:57.910 --> 03:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
talking about with one of the bills we
 
03:29:57.920 --> 03:29:59.110 align:start position:0%
talking about with one of the bills we
had

03:29:59.110 --> 03:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
had
 
03:30:02.389 --> 03:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:05.349 --> 03:30:05.359 align:start position:0%
from the company to the individual
 
03:30:05.359 --> 03:30:06.710 align:start position:0%
from the company to the individual
partners

03:30:06.710 --> 03:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
partners
 
03:30:07.990 --> 03:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
is i think what we're talking about
 
03:30:08.000 --> 03:30:13.190 align:start position:0%
is i think what we're talking about
there

03:30:13.190 --> 03:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:16.950 --> 03:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
or maybe not i mean it's uh
 
03:30:18.070 --> 03:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
it's just getting money out of the
 
03:30:21.269 --> 03:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
company giving it to two owners
 
03:30:37.830 --> 03:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:41.269 --> 03:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
yeah does distributions also
 
03:30:45.750 --> 03:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
include on payments to
 
03:30:48.790 --> 03:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
to the ceo and
 
03:30:53.269 --> 03:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
other top officers of these corporations
 
03:30:54.710 --> 03:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
no i think those are handlers they get
 
03:30:57.510 --> 03:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
huge payments you're thinking of bonuses
 
03:30:59.349 --> 03:30:59.359 align:start position:0%
i think bonus payments has treated a
 
03:30:59.359 --> 03:31:00.550 align:start position:0%
i think bonus payments has treated a
salary

03:31:00.550 --> 03:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
salary
 
03:31:08.469 --> 03:31:08.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:11.510 --> 03:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
any other questions um i just have a
 
03:31:11.520 --> 03:31:11.990 align:start position:0%
any other questions um i just have a
question

03:31:11.990 --> 03:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:31:15.990 --> 03:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
myself um does that triangle chart
 
03:31:19.110 --> 03:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
support the bill that wants to raise
 
03:31:27.110 --> 03:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
the exemption figure
 
03:31:30.229 --> 03:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
that exemption applies to
 
03:31:33.110 --> 03:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
all interest and dividends yes that
 
03:31:33.120 --> 03:31:34.389 align:start position:0%
all interest and dividends yes that
exemption

03:31:34.389 --> 03:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
03:31:38.150 --> 03:31:38.160 align:start position:0%
right and so that it would affect it
 
03:31:39.670 --> 03:31:39.680 align:start position:0%
and it would help the people in those
 
03:31:41.990 --> 03:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
slower brackets is that correct
 
03:31:46.870 --> 03:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:52.070 --> 03:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:55.590 --> 03:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
yeah if i could chime in um
 
03:31:58.309 --> 03:31:58.319 align:start position:0%
remember that the exemptions apply
 
03:32:00.469 --> 03:32:00.479 align:start position:0%
generally to everybody
 
03:32:03.590 --> 03:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
but there are also exemptions for elder
 
03:32:06.950 --> 03:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
elder taxpayers and for
 
03:32:09.190 --> 03:32:09.200 align:start position:0%
disabled and blind i think those are the
 
03:32:10.469 --> 03:32:10.479 align:start position:0%
three kids
 
03:32:13.590 --> 03:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
they are on and so uh
 
03:32:16.550 --> 03:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
those exemptions apply across the board
 
03:32:17.910 --> 03:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
they're very small
 
03:32:20.950 --> 03:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
we'll discuss them more
 
03:32:22.790 --> 03:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
we'll look at them closely when we talk
 
03:32:24.790 --> 03:32:24.800 align:start position:0%
about the bill um
 
03:32:27.830 --> 03:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
and do our work session on the uh
 
03:32:30.870 --> 03:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
the proposal to change the exemptions
 
03:32:33.990 --> 03:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
so if you if you mind if i chime in uh
 
03:32:37.510 --> 03:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
go ahead so let's use the 500 one
 
03:32:40.710 --> 03:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
so that to to have to pay to five
 
03:32:42.229 --> 03:32:42.239 align:start position:0%
five hundred dollars in tax that would
 
03:32:43.750 --> 03:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
mean that you have had interest in
 
03:32:44.550 --> 03:32:44.560 align:start position:0%
dividends of
 
03:32:47.110 --> 03:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
ten thousand dollars so what's going to
 
03:32:48.710 --> 03:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
happen is
 
03:32:51.190 --> 03:32:51.200 align:start position:0%
that when we we do if we increase the
 
03:32:52.389 --> 03:32:52.399 align:start position:0%
exemption that would mean
 
03:32:53.590 --> 03:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
well depends on how much we do it let's
 
03:32:55.349 --> 03:32:55.359 align:start position:0%
say let's say we increase the exemption
 
03:32:56.790 --> 03:32:56.800 align:start position:0%
by 1400
 
03:32:59.910 --> 03:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
the 1400 comes off to 10 000.
 
03:33:03.030 --> 03:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
okay it's off of what the actual amount
 
03:33:03.040 --> 03:33:03.590 align:start position:0%
okay it's off of what the actual amount
is

03:33:03.590 --> 03:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:33:07.910 --> 03:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
so i guess yes it will help the smaller
 
03:33:10.950 --> 03:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
the smaller investor if you will
 
03:33:15.510 --> 03:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
um right right now it's 2400
 
03:33:18.710 --> 03:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
and if you're a joint that'd be 48
 
03:33:21.750 --> 03:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
and if you're elderly it would
 
03:33:26.469 --> 03:33:26.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:29.590 --> 03:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
and so you'd pay taxes on 4 000 if you
 
03:33:30.229 --> 03:33:30.239 align:start position:0%
had 10
 
03:33:34.389 --> 03:33:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:36.630 --> 03:33:36.640 align:start position:0%
and if we double that then that
 
03:33:37.670 --> 03:33:37.680 align:start position:0%
particular one
 
03:33:44.469 --> 03:33:44.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:47.510 --> 03:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
further questions uh yes uh
 
03:33:52.070 --> 03:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:55.349 --> 03:33:55.359 align:start position:0%
thanks on looking still at this
 
03:33:57.750 --> 03:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
chart and trying to think about what
 
03:33:59.670 --> 03:33:59.680 align:start position:0%
distributions really are we've never
 
03:33:59.680 --> 03:33:59.990 align:start position:0%
distributions really are we've never
really

03:33:59.990 --> 03:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
really
 
03:34:01.510 --> 03:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
paid a whole lot of attention to them i
 
03:34:03.190 --> 03:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
think they were smaller in the past
 
03:34:05.670 --> 03:34:05.680 align:start position:0%
you know the chart that we were at uh no
 
03:34:07.510 --> 03:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
the the triangle
 
03:34:10.309 --> 03:34:10.319 align:start position:0%
oh sorry sorry i thought you wanted to
 
03:34:11.830 --> 03:34:11.840 align:start position:0%
go back to the pie chart
 
03:34:13.510 --> 03:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
well that one shows that the
 
03:34:16.070 --> 03:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
distributions are almost as important as
 
03:34:17.269 --> 03:34:17.279 align:start position:0%
the dividends
 
03:34:19.429 --> 03:34:19.439 align:start position:0%
uh at this point i don't think they were
 
03:34:21.349 --> 03:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
in the past but maybe that's something
 
03:34:22.469 --> 03:34:22.479 align:start position:0%
to ask
 
03:34:26.830 --> 03:34:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:29.590 --> 03:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
the partnerships
 
03:34:34.790 --> 03:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:37.030 --> 03:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
sorry i need to unmute myself on the
 
03:34:42.389 --> 03:34:42.399 align:start position:0%
other side because i'm
 
03:34:45.269 --> 03:34:45.279 align:start position:0%
there we go okay the partnerships are
 
03:34:45.279 --> 03:34:45.910 align:start position:0%
there we go okay the partnerships are
only

03:34:45.910 --> 03:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
only
 
03:34:50.070 --> 03:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
one million dollars total
 
03:34:53.910 --> 03:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
on that they're contributing so
 
03:34:56.950 --> 03:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
they can't i mean they obviously are not
 
03:35:01.750 --> 03:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
contributing a lot to that that 39
 
03:35:04.530 --> 03:35:04.540 align:start position:0%
of the tax and
 
03:35:04.540 --> 03:35:05.670 align:start position:0%
of the tax and
[Music]

03:35:05.670 --> 03:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:35:08.950 --> 03:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
that leaves individual llc's
 
03:35:12.630 --> 03:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i think we need to
 
03:35:17.590 --> 03:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
to be told told by cpa
 
03:35:20.710 --> 03:35:20.720 align:start position:0%
where the distributions come from maybe
 
03:35:23.510 --> 03:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
if we could ask the cpa society
 
03:35:27.030 --> 03:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
on can you get that uh
 
03:35:30.070 --> 03:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
chris yep hello
 
03:35:31.990 --> 03:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
can i chime in do you mind having a
 
03:35:34.389 --> 03:35:34.399 align:start position:0%
discussion on this briefly here um
 
03:35:38.070 --> 03:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
go ahead uh again when i filed mine when
 
03:35:39.670 --> 03:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
i was an owner of an s-corp
 
03:35:42.630 --> 03:35:42.640 align:start position:0%
remember s-corps are not partnerships
 
03:35:43.110 --> 03:35:43.120 align:start position:0%
but with
 
03:35:46.389 --> 03:35:46.399 align:start position:0%
s-corps you file as an individual
 
03:35:48.229 --> 03:35:48.239 align:start position:0%
the money gets distributed to you as an
 
03:35:50.309 --> 03:35:50.319 align:start position:0%
individual so when i filed my tax to new
 
03:35:50.319 --> 03:35:51.269 align:start position:0%
individual so when i filed my tax to new
hampshire

03:35:51.269 --> 03:35:51.279 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
03:35:54.950 --> 03:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
was under individual uh
 
03:35:57.590 --> 03:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
efficient dividends so the real question
 
03:35:59.269 --> 03:35:59.279 align:start position:0%
is yeah i think we should get
 
03:36:02.630 --> 03:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
further clarification no question but um
 
03:36:05.670 --> 03:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
just understand that as corpse
 
03:36:09.030 --> 03:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
are when you file as a in the state
 
03:36:10.950 --> 03:36:10.960 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends you're flying as
 
03:36:16.710 --> 03:36:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:19.910 --> 03:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
so but we'll have some an expert in this
 
03:36:19.920 --> 03:36:20.309 align:start position:0%
so but we'll have some an expert in this
should

03:36:20.309 --> 03:36:20.319 align:start position:0%
should
 
03:36:22.630 --> 03:36:22.640 align:start position:0%
should chime in i think the drake dra
 
03:36:24.070 --> 03:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
could probably explain this very well as
 
03:36:24.080 --> 03:36:25.190 align:start position:0%
could probably explain this very well as
well

03:36:25.190 --> 03:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:36:26.630 --> 03:36:26.640 align:start position:0%
that that's who i would start with i
 
03:36:29.030 --> 03:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
believe just sensitive state tax and how
 
03:36:29.750 --> 03:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
they would handle
 
03:36:32.229 --> 03:36:32.239 align:start position:0%
the idea of the distributions yeah i
 
03:36:34.389 --> 03:36:34.399 align:start position:0%
think they have the answers to those
 
03:36:37.990 --> 03:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
in fact i think for mr chair
 
03:36:41.110 --> 03:36:41.120 align:start position:0%
when we when we meet next on this
 
03:36:43.190 --> 03:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
since all the open questions are on the
 
03:36:44.870 --> 03:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh maybe you're going to do this but
 
03:36:48.150 --> 03:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
all the open questions are on cra taxes
 
03:36:50.070 --> 03:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
is that they should be included in the
 
03:36:51.910 --> 03:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
meeting i would invite them to the
 
03:36:51.920 --> 03:36:53.670 align:start position:0%
meeting i would invite them to the
meeting

03:36:53.670 --> 03:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
03:36:57.429 --> 03:36:57.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:01.429 --> 03:37:01.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:04.550 --> 03:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
yeah so that's a definite hold
 
03:37:07.670 --> 03:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
on the interest dividend
 
03:37:12.710 --> 03:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
yes so we have a hold on the
 
03:37:14.950 --> 03:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
business taxes loans and meals tax
 
03:37:17.269 --> 03:37:17.279 align:start position:0%
tobacco tax
 
03:37:25.510 --> 03:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:31.750 --> 03:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
the real estate transfer tax
 
03:37:31.760 --> 03:37:36.790 align:start position:0%
the real estate transfer tax
communications

03:37:36.790 --> 03:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:40.070 --> 03:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
communications also did you say that
 
03:37:51.349 --> 03:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:55.110 --> 03:37:55.120 align:start position:0%
yes yes rather than right hold i
 
03:37:57.510 --> 03:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
i had a double question mark that is a
 
03:37:57.520 --> 03:38:02.870 align:start position:0%
i had a double question mark that is a
hold

03:38:02.870 --> 03:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:08.870 --> 03:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:12.150 --> 03:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
so so we have a busy schedule ahead of
 
03:38:12.160 --> 03:38:13.269 align:start position:0%
so so we have a busy schedule ahead of
ourselves

03:38:13.269 --> 03:38:13.279 align:start position:0%
ourselves
 
03:38:17.910 --> 03:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:20.870 --> 03:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
do one more easy one norm can we do fish
 
03:38:22.309 --> 03:38:22.319 align:start position:0%
and game and get that done
 
03:38:25.349 --> 03:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
uh i think highway fund
 
03:38:27.110 --> 03:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
we may want to have some folks in the
 
03:38:29.750 --> 03:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
highway fund because of the
 
03:38:30.550 --> 03:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
we're probably going to have some
 
03:38:32.469 --> 03:38:32.479 align:start position:0%
discussion we have to do that today but
 
03:38:33.830 --> 03:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
discussions around
 
03:38:35.830 --> 03:38:35.840 align:start position:0%
the big the big number there is the uh
 
03:38:35.840 --> 03:38:37.429 align:start position:0%
the big the big number there is the uh
rotol

03:38:37.429 --> 03:38:37.439 align:start position:0%
rotol
 
03:38:40.550 --> 03:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
that we is affected by the by the uh
 
03:38:44.070 --> 03:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
pandemic more than anything else there
 
03:38:45.910 --> 03:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
so we should i'd like to have the age
 
03:38:47.670 --> 03:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
it'd be great if we had the agency in
 
03:38:50.550 --> 03:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
in in with us as we're discussing that
 
03:38:51.750 --> 03:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
and then uh
 
03:38:53.670 --> 03:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
but i think fish and game i think we
 
03:38:55.110 --> 03:38:55.120 align:start position:0%
could yeah we can do
 
03:39:01.750 --> 03:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:04.309 --> 03:39:04.319 align:start position:0%
you want to pull up session game chris
 
03:39:04.319 --> 03:39:07.189 align:start position:0%
you want to pull up session game chris
yep

03:39:07.189 --> 03:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:12.550 --> 03:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:14.630 --> 03:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
my wife is chuckling because i did but i
 
03:39:21.990 --> 03:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
didn't share the screen so
 
03:39:29.990 --> 03:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:33.670 --> 03:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:47.750 --> 03:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:52.630 --> 03:39:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:54.710 --> 03:39:54.720 align:start position:0%
don't know that we need to spend much
 
03:39:56.710 --> 03:39:56.720 align:start position:0%
time on them does anybody have any
 
03:39:56.720 --> 03:39:57.670 align:start position:0%
time on them does anybody have any
issues

03:39:57.670 --> 03:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
issues
 
03:40:04.309 --> 03:40:04.319 align:start position:0%
with the numbers from the fishing game
 
03:40:06.630 --> 03:40:06.640 align:start position:0%
any issues with the numbers from our
 
03:40:08.630 --> 03:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
questions relative to the numbers in the
 
03:40:11.750 --> 03:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:14.229 --> 03:40:14.239 align:start position:0%
looks straightforward all right so
 
03:40:16.309 --> 03:40:16.319 align:start position:0%
anybody have a problem if we go ahead
 
03:40:18.309 --> 03:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
and accept the numbers as they are
 
03:40:21.670 --> 03:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
for this point in time and we will do
 
03:40:21.680 --> 03:40:29.429 align:start position:0%
for this point in time and we will do
that

03:40:29.429 --> 03:40:29.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:32.790 --> 03:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
does anybody else have any questions and
 
03:40:32.800 --> 03:40:34.309 align:start position:0%
does anybody else have any questions and
journals

03:40:34.309 --> 03:40:34.319 align:start position:0%
journals
 
03:40:40.309 --> 03:40:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:44.070 --> 03:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
then we will have
 
03:40:47.269 --> 03:40:47.279 align:start position:0%
somebody come in and talk to us on the
 
03:40:49.189 --> 03:40:49.199 align:start position:0%
status of the vaccination
 
03:40:53.349 --> 03:40:53.359 align:start position:0%
and the pandemic we definitely will have
 
03:40:56.550 --> 03:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
somebody come in and talk to us on the
 
03:40:59.349 --> 03:40:59.359 align:start position:0%
housing situation
 
03:41:02.710 --> 03:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
and the gra will bring them in to
 
03:41:06.950 --> 03:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
cover the the bulk of the
 
03:41:09.990 --> 03:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
high running taxes
 
03:41:13.110 --> 03:41:13.120 align:start position:0%
business meals and rooms tobacco
 
03:41:17.110 --> 03:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
interest in dividend communication
 
03:41:24.950 --> 03:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:30.710 --> 03:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:32.710 --> 03:41:32.720 align:start position:0%
well this isn't a question or comment
 
03:41:34.950 --> 03:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
before we close i'd like to make an
 
03:41:37.750 --> 03:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
announcement to my caucus
 
03:41:39.990 --> 03:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
you can and i'll make an announcement to
 
03:41:42.309 --> 03:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
our caucus right after that
 
03:41:46.550 --> 03:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
okay great um i think that we ought to
 
03:41:50.389 --> 03:41:50.399 align:start position:0%
get together briefly if um
 
03:41:53.750 --> 03:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
at 1 30 perhaps to
 
03:41:58.229 --> 03:41:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:00.389 --> 03:42:00.399 align:start position:0%
see if people want to trade and things
 
03:42:02.710 --> 03:42:02.720 align:start position:0%
like that
 
03:42:05.269 --> 03:42:05.279 align:start position:0%
thanks okay you're going to set it up
 
03:42:05.279 --> 03:42:07.189 align:start position:0%
thanks okay you're going to set it up

oh we have it's already amanda's room
 
03:42:14.710 --> 03:42:14.720 align:start position:0%
if she's not she said we could use it
 
03:42:16.950 --> 03:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
without her actually that's good
 
03:42:19.030 --> 03:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
okay we have a clock in the republican
 
03:42:20.070 --> 03:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
caucus at 3

30 and that link has been sent to you
 
03:42:27.110 --> 03:42:27.120 align:start position:0%
and are you trading too

03:42:36.150 --> 03:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
chairman majors yes that's false just
 
03:42:37.910 --> 03:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative tudor i didn't receive
 
03:42:39.590 --> 03:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
anything on the zoom meeting today so if
 
03:42:40.950 --> 03:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
someone could forward that along i'd
 
03:42:42.229 --> 03:42:42.239 align:start position:0%

03:42:45.189 --> 03:42:45.199 align:start position:0%

03:42:47.030 --> 03:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
representative nunez although i did i
 
03:42:48.550 --> 03:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
knew about the meeting i didn't get the
 
03:42:49.510 --> 03:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
link either
 
03:42:51.189 --> 03:42:51.199 align:start position:0%
you didn't who else didn't get the
 
03:42:56.790 --> 03:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:58.710 --> 03:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
i wanted you to send it to everybody to
 
03:43:01.349 --> 03:43:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:05.429 --> 03:43:05.439 align:start position:0%
yeah i sent it to the republican members
 
03:43:08.710 --> 03:43:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:12.150 --> 03:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
ways and means and so maybe i've got two
 
03:43:16.790 --> 03:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:18.469 --> 03:43:18.479 align:start position:0%

lunch first
 
03:43:31.030 --> 03:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
and i'll get it out after that the thing
 
03:43:32.710 --> 03:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
is that we're getting so many
 
03:43:37.590 --> 03:43:37.600 align:start position:0%
so much mail a charitable uh
 
03:43:40.469 --> 03:43:40.479 align:start position:0%

03:43:40.479 --> 03:43:40.950 align:start position:0%
there's hardly room in our inboxes for
zoom

historical racing just think it could be
 
03:44:12.790 --> 03:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
speed limits unlike winnipesaukee
 
03:44:19.110 --> 03:44:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:20.950 --> 03:44:20.960 align:start position:0%

03:44:43.349 --> 03:44:43.359 align:start position:0%
we're having a republican caucus today
 
03:44:46.469 --> 03:44:46.479 align:start position:0%
to determine what bills we would like to
 
03:44:46.479 --> 03:44:47.590 align:start position:0%

03:44:58.070 --> 03:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
meeting of her caucus and then the
 
03:45:00.469 --> 03:45:00.479 align:start position:0%
ones that will be real controversial
 
03:45:03.030 --> 03:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
we'll save for the next day
 
03:45:05.030 --> 03:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
we'll try to work them in during the
 
03:45:06.309 --> 03:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
public hearings
 
03:45:08.389 --> 03:45:08.399 align:start position:0%
but we'd like to get those easy bills
 
03:45:11.269 --> 03:45:11.279 align:start position:0%
out tomorrow
 
03:45:13.510 --> 03:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
representative major yes representative
 
03:45:14.870 --> 03:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
schamberg here

uh will there be a on-site
 
03:45:21.510 --> 03:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
lob meeting for these bills or is it
 
03:45:23.510 --> 03:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
going to be zoom
 
03:45:26.550 --> 03:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
uh the public caring
 
03:45:29.990 --> 03:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
that's scheduled for thursday
 
03:45:33.189 --> 03:45:33.199 align:start position:0%
no no wednesday tomorrow well wednesday
 
03:45:33.990 --> 03:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
tomorrow is
 
03:45:38.830 --> 03:45:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:38.840 --> 03:45:42.070 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:45:42.070 --> 03:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:46.630 --> 03:45:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:50.150 --> 03:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
i'm going to plan on being in
 
03:45:54.070 --> 03:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
my own home and i don't know okay
 
03:45:59.750 --> 03:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:02.790 --> 03:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
not if you're not going to be there
 
03:46:04.550 --> 03:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
norm i'm debating whether or not one of
 
03:46:08.550 --> 03:46:08.560 align:start position:0%
us should be there
 
03:46:10.710 --> 03:46:10.720 align:start position:0%
the reason why i made that decision is
 
03:46:10.720 --> 03:46:11.670 align:start position:0%
the reason why i made that decision is
that

03:46:11.670 --> 03:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:46:15.429 --> 03:46:15.439 align:start position:0%
how do you expect if people
 
03:46:18.389 --> 03:46:18.399 align:start position:0%
you people can't hear us from the room
 
03:46:19.429 --> 03:46:19.439 align:start position:0%
and they
 
03:46:21.189 --> 03:46:21.199 align:start position:0%
present and you can't understand the
 
03:46:21.199 --> 03:46:22.630 align:start position:0%
present and you can't understand the
presenters

03:46:22.630 --> 03:46:22.640 align:start position:0%
presenters
 
03:46:24.550 --> 03:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
and you can't understand each other why
 
03:46:26.469 --> 03:46:26.479 align:start position:0%
even has a meeting in the first place
 
03:46:30.630 --> 03:46:30.640 align:start position:0%
so that was bad it's like
 
03:46:32.950 --> 03:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
we do a pretty good job communicating
 
03:46:35.429 --> 03:46:35.439 align:start position:0%
this way
 
03:46:38.950 --> 03:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:42.309 --> 03:46:42.319 align:start position:0%
oh that's what my wife tells me for
 
03:46:44.790 --> 03:46:44.800 align:start position:0%
tomorrow's exact other people do
 
03:46:46.630 --> 03:46:46.640 align:start position:0%
tomorrow's execs do you have to have
 
03:46:48.070 --> 03:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
people's pictures
 
03:46:52.389 --> 03:46:52.399 align:start position:0%
yes tomorrow's exact is that
 
03:46:55.510 --> 03:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
you don't exactly he can't see you
 
03:46:59.830 --> 03:46:59.840 align:start position:0%
thanks good point
 
03:47:01.990 --> 03:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
so it would be okay mr mr chairman this
 
03:47:03.510 --> 03:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
is representative nunez it would be okay
 
03:47:05.189 --> 03:47:05.199 align:start position:0%
if we turned our video on so that you
 
03:47:06.630 --> 03:47:06.640 align:start position:0%
can tell it's us and then put our
 
03:47:08.790 --> 03:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
picture up
 
03:47:12.389 --> 03:47:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:15.030 --> 03:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
that's why you're voting though right
 
03:47:15.040 --> 03:47:16.550 align:start position:0%
that's why you're voting though right
yes

03:47:16.550 --> 03:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:47:21.670 --> 03:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:23.110 --> 03:47:23.120 align:start position:0%
mr chairman representative schamberg

here again yes
 
03:47:26.870 --> 03:47:26.880 align:start position:0%

03:47:28.070 --> 03:47:28.080 align:start position:0%

03:47:52.550 --> 03:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
room assigned to us on
 
03:47:55.590 --> 03:47:55.600 align:start position:0%
thursday thursday okay thank you

03:47:59.189 --> 03:47:59.199 align:start position:0%
face to
 
03:48:03.189 --> 03:48:03.199 align:start position:0%
oh oh man jenny
 
03:48:06.870 --> 03:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
yes yes but it's going to look ugly
 
03:48:13.910 --> 03:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
okay what do the rest of us do
 
03:48:16.469 --> 03:48:16.479 align:start position:0%
representative major on thursday
 
03:48:19.510 --> 03:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
we're on we've got some pretty large
 
03:48:19.520 --> 03:48:21.110 align:start position:0%
we're on we've got some pretty large
bills

03:48:21.110 --> 03:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
bills
 
03:48:24.870 --> 03:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
and and certainly the the horse racing
 
03:48:28.309 --> 03:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
is likely to have a lot of people at it
 
03:48:30.469 --> 03:48:30.479 align:start position:0%
how are we going to deal with very large
 
03:48:32.630 --> 03:48:32.640 align:start position:0%
execs at the same time
 
03:48:35.750 --> 03:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
especially if it has to be in the room
 
03:48:36.710 --> 03:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
as well as
 
03:48:40.710 --> 03:48:40.720 align:start position:0%
at home if we have the time
 
03:48:42.630 --> 03:48:42.640 align:start position:0%
in the morning we should be able to work
 
03:48:44.630 --> 03:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
on them
 
03:48:48.309 --> 03:48:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:51.349 --> 03:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
well we'll see let's let's talk tonight
 
03:48:53.910 --> 03:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
after i have the clocks
 
03:48:57.030 --> 03:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
and we'll do the easy easy ones tomorrow
 
03:48:59.990 --> 03:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
and do the difficult ones i try to do
 
03:49:02.389 --> 03:49:02.399 align:start position:0%
difficult ones on thursday
 
03:49:04.070 --> 03:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
i don't think we'll be doing anything in
 
03:49:05.990 --> 03:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
the afternoon because of the length of
 
03:49:11.110 --> 03:49:11.120 align:start position:0%
the hearings
 
03:49:13.830 --> 03:49:13.840 align:start position:0%
all right i'd like to thank mr shea for
 
03:49:15.830 --> 03:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
having all those
 
03:49:20.070 --> 03:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
uh share screen uh materials
 
03:49:24.790 --> 03:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
so quickly yes really
 
03:49:27.670 --> 03:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
it really makes it better than being in
 
03:49:29.830 --> 03:49:29.840 align:start position:0%
our hearing room and each one
 
03:49:33.110 --> 03:49:33.120 align:start position:0%
scrapped through our papers
 
03:49:34.870 --> 03:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
very grateful that you were able to do
 
03:49:39.189 --> 03:49:39.199 align:start position:0%
that i agree chris does a great job also
 
03:49:42.870 --> 03:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
janine does a good job too thank you
 
03:49:46.070 --> 03:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:49.110 --> 03:49:49.120 align:start position:0%
if we didn't have those two we
 
03:49:52.229 --> 03:49:52.239 align:start position:0%
might as well stay home but
 
03:49:56.469 --> 03:49:56.479 align:start position:0%
not join okay i think we've had enough
 
03:49:57.670 --> 03:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
for today
 
03:49:59.269 --> 03:49:59.279 align:start position:0%
represent major just one quick thing
 
03:50:01.670 --> 03:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
before you go would it be advisable to
 
03:50:04.070 --> 03:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
bring dra in on tuesday the 16th when
 
03:50:05.030 --> 03:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
you're meeting
 
03:50:07.030 --> 03:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
yes in case there's questions that um
 
03:50:08.630 --> 03:50:08.640 align:start position:0%
the committee members come up with that
 
03:50:09.269 --> 03:50:09.279 align:start position:0%
they could
