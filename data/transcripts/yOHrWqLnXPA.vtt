and i appreciate the department's
 
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
information that it
 
00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:28.840 align:start position:0%
sent over the other day the supplemental
 
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
information my question really is about
 
00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
how how
 
00:07:36.629 --> 00:07:36.639 align:start position:0%
can we
 
00:07:40.469 --> 00:07:40.479 align:start position:0%
measure the success of the doorways
 
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
program beyond just saying
 
00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
they've had contact 27 000 times
 
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
particularly in light of the fact that
 
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:53.360 align:start position:0%
overdose deaths are up sharply
 
00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
in manchester 36
 
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
versus year ago and nashua 31
 
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
versus a year ago how do we
 
00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
how do we know more than just
 
00:08:09.909 --> 00:08:09.919 align:start position:0%
27 000 interactions is it the same
 
00:08:11.909 --> 00:08:11.919 align:start position:0%
people different people where are they
 
00:08:11.919 --> 00:08:13.189 align:start position:0%
people different people where are they
from

00:08:13.189 --> 00:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:08:13.199 --> 00:08:14.230 align:start position:0%
from
would

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
do we have information that the
 
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
referrals are actually getting picked up
 
00:08:20.309 --> 00:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
and the appointments
 
00:08:20.319 --> 00:08:23.670 align:start position:0%
and the appointments
made

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:26.309 --> 00:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
how how can we really understand that
 
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
this program
 
00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.990 align:start position:0%
this program
is

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.870 align:start position:0%
is
helping

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
so good morning
 
00:08:37.029 --> 00:08:37.039 align:start position:0%
for the record i am katya foxx i am the
 
00:08:39.029 --> 00:08:39.039 align:start position:0%
director of the division for behavioral
 
00:08:40.949 --> 00:08:40.959 align:start position:0%
health and
 
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
in anticipation of your question we did
 
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
prepare quite a comprehensive response
 
00:08:47.829 --> 00:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
which hopefully was shared with the full
 
00:08:47.839 --> 00:08:49.350 align:start position:0%
which hopefully was shared with the full
committee

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.150 align:start position:0%
committee
but

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:52.720 align:start position:0%
to your point and i
 
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
i know this is an area that we often get
 
00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:58.160 align:start position:0%
questions on and we would love to be
 
00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
able to give you a very
 
00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
robust answer but we can tell you that
 
00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:04.959 align:start position:0%
we have the doorway report
 
00:09:04.959 --> 00:09:05.750 align:start position:0%
we have the doorway report
so

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
when we
 
00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:08.959 align:start position:0%
provide those numbers of how many are
 
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:10.720 align:start position:0%
served on a monthly basis and then
 
00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.470 align:start position:0%
served on a monthly basis and then
cumulatively

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
cumulatively
 
00:09:14.389 --> 00:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
those are the numbers of unique
 
00:09:17.269 --> 00:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
individuals in that particular reporting
 
00:09:17.279 --> 00:09:18.710 align:start position:0%
individuals in that particular reporting
period

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
period
 
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
so when we say 27 000 it could be that
 
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
they're replicated but we're seeing um
 
00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
roughly between 800 and a thousand per
 
00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.070 align:start position:0%
roughly between 800 and a thousand per
month

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
month
 
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
um on and that's an on on a unique
 
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:34.720 align:start position:0%
identifier a unique uh visit person they
 
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
may have visited more than once
 
00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
from a referral perspective we do have
 
00:09:42.389 --> 00:09:42.399 align:start position:0%
the requirement through the federal
 
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
grant that we do
 
00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
an assessment and those assessments are
 
00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.150 align:start position:0%
an assessment and those assessments are
done

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:48.160 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
upon initiation of the contact so this
 
00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
is required for that federal funding
 
00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
that we receive that is subject to this
 
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
matter this morning
 
00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
and then there are required follow ups
 
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
at the six month period the 12-month
 
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
period and discharge what we're finding
 
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
and this has been a problem across the
 
00:10:11.269 --> 00:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
country is being able to
 
00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
be in touch with people throughout that
 
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
duration so at the six-month period and
 
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
12 as you get to 12 months it's harder
 
00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
for follow-up because they may have
 
00:10:23.829 --> 00:10:23.839 align:start position:0%
moved they may have moved on
 
00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:26.240 align:start position:0%
they may have relapse they may be in
 
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
recovery and don't want to have that
 
00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.430 align:start position:0%
recovery and don't want to have that
contact

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
contact
 
00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
um and for a variety of reasons
 
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
were unable to have the robust data that
 
00:10:38.949 --> 00:10:38.959 align:start position:0%
we would get if we had
 
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
a higher percentage of returns on those
 
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up assessments which are quite
 
00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.030 align:start position:0%
follow-up assessments which are quite
lengthy

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
lengthy
 
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:51.200 align:start position:0%
continued to look at ways that we can
 
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
work with our quality unit on how we can
 
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
measure effectiveness of this particular
 
00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:56.870 align:start position:0%
measure effectiveness of this particular
system

00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:10:59.670 --> 00:10:59.680 align:start position:0%
access was the number one
 
00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:00.949 align:start position:0%
access was the number one
goal

00:11:00.949 --> 00:11:00.959 align:start position:0%
goal
 
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
of this
 
00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
project in this part what has become a
 
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
program when we receive this so the
 
00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
access appears to be working
 
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
by the numbers and
 
00:11:14.949 --> 00:11:14.959 align:start position:0%
by the surveys that we've done however
 
00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:17.519 align:start position:0%
we do know that we need a
 
00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
really robust evaluation
 
00:11:22.949 --> 00:11:22.959 align:start position:0%
and that is in the works and we'll be
 
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
procuring for that evaluation
 
00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
shortly because that was never part of
 
00:11:28.949 --> 00:11:28.959 align:start position:0%
the initial
 
00:11:28.959 --> 00:11:29.990 align:start position:0%
the initial
funding

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:33.200 align:start position:0%
it was through this samsung-led
 
00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.470 align:start position:0%
it was through this samsung-led
federal

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
survey that we need to do
 
00:11:38.949 --> 00:11:38.959 align:start position:0%
with that without follow-up at the
 
00:11:40.949 --> 00:11:40.959 align:start position:0%
individual level but we need a more
 
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
comprehensive assessment of whether this
 
00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
system is working and again we have
 
00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
secured the funding through some
 
00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
supplemental block grant dollars and
 
00:11:54.629 --> 00:11:54.639 align:start position:0%
we'll be looking at the efficacy
 
00:11:59.190 --> 00:11:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:00.069 --> 00:12:00.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
two quick follow-ups if i could
 
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
one is um
 
00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
if if we re-implemented that closed-loop
 
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
referral kind of thing would that give
 
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
us the data on
 
00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.150 align:start position:0%
us the data on
following

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:16.160 align:start position:0%
following
 
00:12:18.949 --> 00:12:18.959 align:start position:0%
the users across
 
00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:21.200 align:start position:0%
sites and two
 
00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.550 align:start position:0%
sites and two
how

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
how is the doorways going to help
 
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
uh us not see drug overdose deaths that
 
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
are up over 30 percent in our
 
00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:35.200 align:start position:0%
two biggest cities what else
 
00:12:37.269 --> 00:12:37.279 align:start position:0%
do we need to be doing so we're not
 
00:12:37.279 --> 00:12:38.629 align:start position:0%
do we need to be doing so we're not
losing

00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
losing
 
00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
an increasing number of people
 
00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:44.240 align:start position:0%
so i'll answer your second question
 
00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
first in that
 
00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:49.279 align:start position:0%
this action will allow us to move the
 
00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
four million dollars among between class
 
00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:55.200 align:start position:0%
lines to be able to purchase naloxone
 
00:12:57.509 --> 00:12:57.519 align:start position:0%
naloxone and medicated assisted
 
00:12:59.030 --> 00:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
treatment are
 
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
what have
 
00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
prevented deaths we would have many more
 
00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
deaths we have a huge increase in the
 
00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
overdoses but we're finding the
 
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:09.680 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of having the lux uh
 
00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
naloxone be
 
00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:11.990 align:start position:0%
naloxone be
um

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:14.949 --> 00:13:14.959 align:start position:0%
ubiquitous in the in the um areas so
 
00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
that we want to continue that and we're
 
00:13:20.949 --> 00:13:20.959 align:start position:0%
finding that uh the demand for naloxone
 
00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
is high so that's what that four million
 
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
dollars will do in this item so we're
 
00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:28.240 align:start position:0%
doing that i don't think the doorways
 
00:13:30.949 --> 00:13:30.959 align:start position:0%
can solve the problem i think you as you
 
00:13:30.959 --> 00:13:32.150 align:start position:0%
can solve the problem i think you as you
know

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:13:35.269 --> 00:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
it's multi multi-faceted and it's
 
00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
complex and it's only gotten worse as a
 
00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
result of the pandemic
 
00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
and so we're taking other steps so for
 
00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:45.990 align:start position:0%
and so we're taking other steps so for
example

00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
harm reduction the efforts under this is
 
00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
not just to
 
00:13:53.189 --> 00:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
purchase naloxone but to provide it to
 
00:13:55.829 --> 00:13:55.839 align:start position:0%
hard to reach communities
 
00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
which we find
 
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:00.160 align:start position:0%
in the larger areas
 
00:14:02.949 --> 00:14:02.959 align:start position:0%
but again there's there's the whole
 
00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
law enforcement side there's the
 
00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:08.959 align:start position:0%
um individual family situations
 
00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
and there is the housing the lack of
 
00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
housing as an availability
 
00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
and so we're just doing everything we
 
00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
can using all the resources we have to
 
00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:32.389 --> 00:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:32.399 --> 00:14:33.350 align:start position:0%
 
how

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:14:35.269 --> 00:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
how or whether
 
00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
the closed loop referral kind of thing
 
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
would supplement the information you
 
00:14:43.189 --> 00:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
have on the doorways
 
00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:46.240 align:start position:0%
so close loop referral would
 
00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
is a very effective tool at being able
 
00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
to have providers have the information
 
00:14:54.949 --> 00:14:54.959 align:start position:0%
they need to treat somebody in a
 
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
holistic way
 
00:14:59.509 --> 00:14:59.519 align:start position:0%
and so it also assures that when a
 
00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
referral is made i think to your earlier
 
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
point how do we know what happens after
 
00:15:05.829 --> 00:15:05.839 align:start position:0%
referrals made is there follow-up we
 
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
would know that as a as a closed-loop
 
00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.230 align:start position:0%
would know that as a as a closed-loop
referral

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:10.240 align:start position:0%
referral
 
00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
because there would be a report back and
 
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
the exchange of information with the
 
00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:26.949 --> 00:15:26.959 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions yes
 
00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:28.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony today
 
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
is there any way of aggregating the cost
 
00:15:38.069 --> 00:15:38.079 align:start position:0%
of doorways and associated programs
 
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:40.160 align:start position:0%
into a single dollar figure so we can
 
00:15:41.749 --> 00:15:41.759 align:start position:0%
get an estimate of how much the system
 
00:15:45.509 --> 00:15:45.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at you
 
00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:50.240 align:start position:0%
i mean i think we have our funding
 
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
sources we know how much we've spent on
 
00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
each program the state opioid response
 
00:15:58.230 --> 00:15:58.240 align:start position:0%
grant has been in effect since 2018
 
00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
the doorways open january 1st of 2019 we
 
00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839 align:start position:0%
have all of those costs
 
00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:06.160 align:start position:0%
that we could provide
 
00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
and and then the question becomes do you
 
00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
want it holistically to include other
 
00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
federal funds and other
 
00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
um general funds that are were already
 
00:16:17.749 --> 00:16:17.759 align:start position:0%
in place before the
 
00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
state opioid response so it depends on
 
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
how vast you want it but we have all
 
00:16:25.509 --> 00:16:25.519 align:start position:0%
those numbers
 
00:16:27.749 --> 00:16:27.759 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i i leave it to
 
00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
the pleasure of the committee i'd like
 
00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
to know doorways but again if we know
 
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
what we had before and what we're doing
 
00:16:34.389 --> 00:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
now that gives us a basis to start
 
00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:35.839 align:start position:0%
comparing effectiveness in terms of
 
00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
dollars spent
 
00:16:39.509 --> 00:16:39.519 align:start position:0%
sure we can go right back to um i think
 
00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
it was the fall of 2018 for the doorways
 
00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
when we first contracted with them and
 
00:16:46.949 --> 00:16:46.959 align:start position:0%
we can go right through up until now
 
00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
miss rounds you agree
 
00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
yes i was just asking her a question i
 
00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
think that there's a chart that we um
 
00:16:58.949 --> 00:16:58.959 align:start position:0%
created not that long ago that probably
 
00:17:01.749 --> 00:17:01.759 align:start position:0%
would get out the answer okay okay i
 
00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
think senator rosenwald's question about
 
00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.270 align:start position:0%
think senator rosenwald's question about
the

00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:07.350 align:start position:0%
the
effectiveness

00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
effectiveness
 
00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:08.150 align:start position:0%
effectiveness
is

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:09.839 align:start position:0%
is so important
 
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
because just giving
 
00:17:13.429 --> 00:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
i know you use
 
00:17:15.029 --> 00:17:15.039 align:start position:0%
i use narcan
 
00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:17.839 align:start position:0%
out you know doesn't doesn't solve the
 
00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:18.870 align:start position:0%
out you know doesn't doesn't solve the
problem

00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:17:21.429 --> 00:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
it postpones the problem
 
00:17:21.439 --> 00:17:23.029 align:start position:0%
it postpones the problem
and

00:17:23.029 --> 00:17:23.039 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:29.909 --> 00:17:29.919 align:start position:0%
most of us were hoping
 
00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
is that with doorways that we would be
 
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
able to
 
00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
have a better handle on the uh
 
00:17:41.669 --> 00:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
problems with uh drug overdose
 
00:17:41.679 --> 00:17:42.870 align:start position:0%
problems with uh drug overdose
so

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
okay no i mean that's that's just the
 
00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
way it is
 
00:17:50.549 --> 00:17:50.559 align:start position:0%
um are there any other questions or
 
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:52.720 align:start position:0%
comments one question yes thank you
 
00:17:55.029 --> 00:17:55.039 align:start position:0%
madam chair um
 
00:17:57.029 --> 00:17:57.039 align:start position:0%
maybe in the realm of hypothetical but
 
00:17:58.390 --> 00:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
can you in any way
 
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
attempt to correlate the effects of
 
00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.150 align:start position:0%
attempt to correlate the effects of
covid

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
covid
 
00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh and the impacting societal disruption
 
00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
if you will to the spike
 
00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
in these i don't know if you have the
 
00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
capability but i'd be interested to know
 
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
whether this spike is a you know has
 
00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:17.039 align:start position:0%
causation or correlation to covid or is
 
00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
it something that's you know going on
 
00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
i'm turning it off she's turning it on
 
00:18:30.789 --> 00:18:30.799 align:start position:0%
sorry about that so um thank you senator
 
00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
i think that there have been national
 
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
surveys and studies and indications um
 
00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
when you
 
00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
say correlation i think we can we can
 
00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.190 align:start position:0%
say correlation i think we can we can
make

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
make
 
00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.470 align:start position:0%
make
some

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
assumptions about that and share that
 
00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
information that we do have available
 
00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
oh yes senator daniels thank you
 
00:18:54.789 --> 00:18:54.799 align:start position:0%
could you share what the department is
 
00:18:56.789 --> 00:18:56.799 align:start position:0%
doing to
 
00:18:58.789 --> 00:18:58.799 align:start position:0%
prevent these things from happening
 
00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
because i mean the information we got
 
00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
said from from 2019 to the
 
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
to current it's been
 
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
relatively steady which means all the
 
00:19:10.789 --> 00:19:10.799 align:start position:0%
money that we have thrown into this
 
00:19:12.549 --> 00:19:12.559 align:start position:0%
really hasn't done anything in bringing
 
00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
the numbers down
 
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh you're coming and you're asking for
 
00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
an additional four million dollars for
 
00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.710 align:start position:0%
an additional four million dollars for
naloxone

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
but that's indicative
 
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
of the fact that
 
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't need it
 
00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:29.200 align:start position:0%
unless rate and less rates of incidences
 
00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
were increasing so i'm interested in
 
00:19:33.909 --> 00:19:33.919 align:start position:0%
knowing what you're doing to try to
 
00:19:35.669 --> 00:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
get to the root of this
 
00:19:35.679 --> 00:19:36.710 align:start position:0%
get to the root of this
and

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
if there are obstacles to doing that
 
00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
what are they
 
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
so thank you senator that's a great
 
00:19:45.669 --> 00:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity to start talking about
 
00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
prevention and all the prevention
 
00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:49.110 align:start position:0%
prevention and all the prevention
efforts

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
efforts
 
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
when we talk about state opioid response
 
00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
it's a categorical funding it's
 
00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
specifically for opioids and now
 
00:19:59.350 --> 00:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
stimulants and it's after
 
00:20:02.149 --> 00:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
well after the fact when people are in
 
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
crisis and in need of these services
 
00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:07.919 align:start position:0%
we have the governor's commission which
 
00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
has made
 
00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
a big prevention part of a big focus of
 
00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
its work to which we
 
00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
provide the contracts and go before gnc
 
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
with the governor's commission funding
 
00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
to fund those programs so there are
 
00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
multiple programs that are happening at
 
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
the preventative level
 
00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
so i'd be happy to provide
 
00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
a list or the information about the
 
00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
prevention efforts that are happening
 
00:20:36.789 --> 00:20:36.799 align:start position:0%
across the board
 
00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
and not only with us but with the
 
00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead by virtue of the fact that
 
00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:47.200 align:start position:0%
the numbers don't seem to be coming down
 
00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
would you say that the preventative
 
00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
efforts were successful
 
00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
so i think with prevention the problem
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
is we when we make an investment we
 
00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
don't see an immediate return when you
 
00:20:59.590 --> 00:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
give someone naloxone you see an
 
00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
immediate return
 
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
but when you
 
00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
invest in prevention we don't have the
 
00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
it's the absence of
 
00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
and so when we're asked
 
00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:14.320 align:start position:0%
the increase or the steadiness of the
 
00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
numbers of deaths from opioids we don't
 
00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
have the number of those per what we
 
00:21:23.029 --> 00:21:23.039 align:start position:0%
prevented in that in that time period so
 
00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
i think it's hard to quantify and it's
 
00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
hard for us to want to fund it and think
 
00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
about it and invest in it because we
 
00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
don't see that quick return on
 
00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:33.669 align:start position:0%
don't see that quick return on
investment

00:21:33.669 --> 00:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
investment
 
00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
but we do believe that prevention
 
00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
does make a difference
 
00:21:43.669 --> 00:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
yes follow-up would you expect that uh
 
00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
with the money that we put into
 
00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
prevention that you should see the
 
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.430 align:start position:0%
prevention that you should see the
numbers

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:59.110 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:21:59.110 --> 00:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.909 align:start position:0%
 
question

00:22:05.909 --> 00:22:05.919 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:22:09.029 --> 00:22:09.039 align:start position:0%
senator guida thank you madam chair
 
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
i'd be interested in knowing if if the
 
00:22:14.789 --> 00:22:14.799 align:start position:0%
department or perhaps lba could
 
00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
pull together the numbers
 
00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
for under the broad categories of
 
00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.750 align:start position:0%
for under the broad categories of
prevention

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
prevention
 
00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
treatment and interdiction
 
00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
and that would give us a really good
 
00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
representation of the balance of funding
 
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
towards these different efforts and
 
00:22:28.789 --> 00:22:28.799 align:start position:0%
maybe there needs to be some work done
 
00:22:28.799 --> 00:22:29.750 align:start position:0%
maybe there needs to be some work done
there

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:35.669 --> 00:22:35.679 align:start position:0%
i think it also might be helpful
 
00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
if um
 
00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
we could get something from the
 
00:22:44.549 --> 00:22:44.559 align:start position:0%
courts about how many
 
00:22:44.559 --> 00:22:45.750 align:start position:0%
courts about how many
cases

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
cases
 
00:22:47.909 --> 00:22:47.919 align:start position:0%
what's their case load
 
00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
because the things that we're talking
 
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:50.870 align:start position:0%
because the things that we're talking
about

00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
if the case load is going down
 
00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
then i think we would know
 
00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:56.870 align:start position:0%
then i think we would know
that

00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:22:58.710 --> 00:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
you know prevention is working the
 
00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
caseload is going up then
 
00:23:04.789 --> 00:23:04.799 align:start position:0%
it we might not but i do think that you
 
00:23:04.799 --> 00:23:05.669 align:start position:0%
it we might not but i do think that you
can't

00:23:05.669 --> 00:23:05.679 align:start position:0%
can't
 
00:23:08.149 --> 00:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
you can't separate
 
00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
what dhhs is trying to do from what
 
00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:15.280 align:start position:0%
the court system is trying to do
 
00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:16.390 align:start position:0%
the court system is trying to do
yes

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:16.400 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:23:18.149 --> 00:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i have had
 
00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
written inquiries from
 
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
several county attorneys and their staff
 
00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
about what can we possibly do to
 
00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
uh ease
 
00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
the laws
 
00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
i won't say legalize but change the
 
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
parameters because they are buried
 
00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
under under drug cases and that's from
 
00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
two separate counties
 
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:38.480 align:start position:0%

representative leitchman i believe you
 
00:25:01.029 --> 00:25:01.039 align:start position:0%
had some questions on this uh yes thanks
 
00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
and i
 
00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:10.720 align:start position:0%
uh thanks for taking my question i want
 
00:25:12.549 --> 00:25:12.559 align:start position:0%
to just thank you folks for
 
00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
answering a few questions but it led me
 
00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
to a question
 
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
excuse me would you move your microphone
 
00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
a little closer
 
00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
so thank you for taking my question so
 
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
it said in your response that you have a
 
00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
contractor that provides a service and
 
00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
there are about a hundred cases
 
00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
that are under investigation and a
 
00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
backlog of i think it said 860 roughly
 
00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
now during the pandemic there was
 
00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:44.720 align:start position:0%
certainly a severe food issue people
 
00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:46.640 align:start position:0%
weren't getting food now
 
00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
what happens when this investigative
 
00:25:52.149 --> 00:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
unit goes out are they trying to recover
 
00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
monies lost or to verify people that are
 
00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
getting support should be getting
 
00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:01.350 align:start position:0%
getting support should be getting
support

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:02.789 --> 00:26:02.799 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question for the
 
00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
record my name is karen hebert and i'm
 
00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
the director for the division of
 
00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
economic and housing stability
 
00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
so just to clarify uh part of your
 
00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:13.029 align:start position:0%
so just to clarify uh part of your
question

00:26:13.029 --> 00:26:13.039 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
with respect to the special
 
00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
investigations unit that is not a
 
00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
contracted unit those are state
 
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
employees the contractor
 
00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.070 align:start position:0%
employees the contractor
is

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:26:25.269 --> 00:26:25.279 align:start position:0%
for the system known as new heights
 
00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
that maintains the eligibility programs
 
00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:30.640 align:start position:0%
for processing those applications
 
00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:32.720 align:start position:0%
including snap
 
00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
so the consultant is actually the system
 
00:26:39.909 --> 00:26:39.919 align:start position:0%
vendor for those which is the bulk of
 
00:26:39.919 --> 00:26:41.590 align:start position:0%
vendor for those which is the bulk of
the

00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
expenditures for this item
 
00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
so the special investigations unit works
 
00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
to identify
 
00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
whether or not there is you know they
 
00:26:56.149 --> 00:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
make a determination with respect to
 
00:26:58.630 --> 00:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
their findings on fraud investigations
 
00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
whether someone really wasn't eligible
 
00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
who may have
 
00:27:05.669 --> 00:27:05.679 align:start position:0%
uh misled the department and some
 
00:27:07.029 --> 00:27:07.039 align:start position:0%
respect with
 
00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
regarding their eligibility
 
00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
or were using the benefits when they
 
00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
were no longer entitled to them for
 
00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:16.400 align:start position:0%
example if they move out of state
 
00:27:18.789 --> 00:27:18.799 align:start position:0%
they're required to report their address
 
00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
to us so if they've moved out of state
 
00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:23.440 align:start position:0%
and they are using the benefit in
 
00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
another state without us being informed
 
00:27:29.029 --> 00:27:29.039 align:start position:0%
that could be considered fraud
 
00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:31.360 align:start position:0%
so the department would take steps to
 
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
try to recover
 
00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
the funding with the means that it has
 
00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
available to do so
 
00:27:38.549 --> 00:27:38.559 align:start position:0%
so there are
 
00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
a number of
 
00:27:43.669 --> 00:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
special investigation unit
 
00:27:43.679 --> 00:27:44.789 align:start position:0%
special investigation unit
staff

00:27:44.789 --> 00:27:44.799 align:start position:0%
staff
 
00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
who conduct these investigations for the
 
00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:48.710 align:start position:0%
who conduct these investigations for the
department

00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
so this the funding is about seventeen
 
00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars out of this item
 
00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
that would go towards overtime
 
00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
in order to try to catch up with that
 
00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
backlog which was
 
00:28:03.669 --> 00:28:03.679 align:start position:0%
created in part because of the pandemic
 
00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
and an extraordinary number of referrals
 
00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
that the unit received for fraud
 
00:28:11.029 --> 00:28:11.039 align:start position:0%
investigations that were quite higher
 
00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
than what we normally receive
 
00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
just a further question if i could make
 
00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
him chair yes thanks
 
00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
so what's the success rate because
 
00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
obviously a number of these people
 
00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
probably don't have a lot
 
00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
to offer financially so
 
00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:26.470 align:start position:0%
to offer financially so
is

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:26.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
is the unit successful in recouping some
 
00:28:30.389 --> 00:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
of the losses or
 
00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:32.240 align:start position:0%
are we spending a lot of money to chase
 
00:28:34.149 --> 00:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
something we can't catch it is
 
00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
successful in part i think that it
 
00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
depends on the circumstances and if
 
00:28:39.669 --> 00:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
you'd like i'd be more than happy to get
 
00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
you a more precise percentage of the
 
00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
success rate thank you thank you madam
 
00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:47.110 align:start position:0%
success rate thank you thank you madam
chair

00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:50.389 --> 00:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
senator rosenwald thank you madam chair
 
00:28:52.549 --> 00:28:52.559 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
00:28:55.669 --> 00:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
an existing unit in the department
 
00:28:57.510 --> 00:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
did we budget
 
00:28:59.430 --> 00:28:59.440 align:start position:0%
any money in the
 
00:29:01.269 --> 00:29:01.279 align:start position:0%
house bill one
 
00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
to make changes to new heights or
 
00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
um is this the only changes we're making
 
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
to new heights i guess i'm asking
 
00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
why do we only need this now and why
 
00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
didn't the department need it during the
 
00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:16.470 align:start position:0%
didn't the department need it during the
budget

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:29:18.789 --> 00:29:18.799 align:start position:0%
the changes that are needed for the
 
00:29:20.549 --> 00:29:20.559 align:start position:0%
system at this time
 
00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
were predicated by an evaluation
 
00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
conducted by the u.s department of
 
00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
agriculture and findings that we
 
00:29:29.909 --> 00:29:29.919 align:start position:0%
received regarding the need to change
 
00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:32.720 align:start position:0%
the way we were documenting tracking and
 
00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:34.149 align:start position:0%
the way we were documenting tracking and
reporting

00:29:34.149 --> 00:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
00:29:36.389 --> 00:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
these types of cases
 
00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
so the changes are necessary in the
 
00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
system to be able to meet
 
00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
the uh requirements or recommendations
 
00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:52.389 --> 00:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
when did we get that evaluation
 
00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
that is a good question i mean i guess
 
00:29:57.029 --> 00:29:57.039 align:start position:0%
i'm going to say within the fourth the
 
00:30:00.789 --> 00:30:00.799 align:start position:0%
budget was oh yes it's so the the the
 
00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
evaluation would have been completed
 
00:30:05.029 --> 00:30:05.039 align:start position:0%
within the last few months okay so
 
00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
certainly not within time for the budget
 
00:30:09.029 --> 00:30:09.039 align:start position:0%
thank you i would also just mention that
 
00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
these are 100 federal arpa funds and
 
00:30:13.029 --> 00:30:13.039 align:start position:0%
arpa funds were not budgeted in the
 
00:30:13.039 --> 00:30:15.669 align:start position:0%
arpa funds were not budgeted in the
budget

00:30:15.669 --> 00:30:15.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
senator guida thank you madam chair um
 
00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
how many employees are in this
 
00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
department division agency bureau
 
00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
i believe it's five or six at this time
 
00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
right how many cases are follow-up
 
00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
yes thank you manager how many cases are
 
00:30:32.549 --> 00:30:32.559 align:start position:0%
you are you are they prosecuting right
 
00:30:32.559 --> 00:30:33.590 align:start position:0%
you are you are they prosecuting right
now

00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
no i mean are they pursuing right
 
00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
investigating right now sure so at the
 
00:30:41.669 --> 00:30:41.679 align:start position:0%
moment there is a backlog of 866 cases
 
00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
that need to be investigated or
 
00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
completed with the investigation so some
 
00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
of them have already started
 
00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
typically there is an average of about a
 
00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:51.110 align:start position:0%
typically there is an average of about a
hundred

00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
hundred
 
00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
cases pending at any given time so this
 
00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
is quite an extraordinary amount
 
00:30:58.710 --> 00:30:58.720 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions

commissioner
um

00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:38.549 --> 00:32:38.559 align:start position:0%
these are we currently having any funds
 
00:32:43.029 --> 00:32:43.039 align:start position:0%
expended towards attracting folks to
 
00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
the trades
 
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
in our schools whether it's by the ctes
 
00:32:48.149 --> 00:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
or any other
 
00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:50.240 align:start position:0%
agencies of government or otherwise do
 
00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:32:53.509 --> 00:32:53.519 align:start position:0%
speaking for gopher and for my
 
00:32:56.389 --> 00:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
department bea no uh not at this point
 
00:32:58.149 --> 00:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
but i i imagine there may be other
 
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:15.430 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:15.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair would you be
 
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
amenable to tabling this till we can
 
00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:20.640 align:start position:0%
find out whether funds are being
 
00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:22.149 align:start position:0%
find out whether funds are being
expended

00:33:22.149 --> 00:33:22.159 align:start position:0%
expended
 
00:33:22.159 --> 00:33:24.950 align:start position:0%
expended
um

00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
i mean that's obviously your decision
 
00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
senator i think uh this program is
 
00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
one is unique in the sense that it is uh
 
00:33:35.909 --> 00:33:35.919 align:start position:0%
currently in operation
 
00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
in uh in a half the form i suppose that
 
00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
we would hope that we would see it
 
00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
and it has proven to be quite successful
 
00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:43.750 align:start position:0%
and it has proven to be quite successful
uh

00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
in uh lieu of the fact that there if
 
00:33:47.669 --> 00:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
there are other programs i'm not aware
 
00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
of any that are operating at the success
 
00:33:55.029 --> 00:33:55.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:58.230 --> 00:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
yes follow it so
 
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
can you elucidate a little bit on the
 
00:34:02.549 --> 00:34:02.559 align:start position:0%
success rate or you know in terms of
 
00:34:04.549 --> 00:34:04.559 align:start position:0%
funds expended people moving into jobs
 
00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't otherwise go on that way
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
or into training programs is there any
 
00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
way you have any data on that uh well
 
00:34:11.589 --> 00:34:11.599 align:start position:0%
what i could do is i could ask um john
 
00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:13.919 align:start position:0%
nyan who is here today from the hampton
 
00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
chamber who has been running the program
 
00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
for the last several months or years uh
 
00:34:22.629 --> 00:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:27.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:27.919 --> 00:34:32.950 align:start position:0%
 
john

00:34:32.950 --> 00:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
good morning and for the record my name
 
00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
is john nyan
 
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:37.919 align:start position:0%

00:34:37.919 --> 00:34:38.869 align:start position:0%

00:34:44.869 --> 00:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
senator
 
00:34:46.869 --> 00:34:46.879 align:start position:0%
good question
 
00:34:49.589 --> 00:34:49.599 align:start position:0%
this program started if i may just give
 
00:34:51.109 --> 00:34:51.119 align:start position:0%
you a little bit of background
 
00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh this program started with a small ten
 
00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar grant from the new
 
00:34:57.270 --> 00:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire charitable foundation uh
 
00:34:59.510 --> 00:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
nature school of mechanical trades and
 
00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:00.870 align:start position:0%
nature school of mechanical trades and
went

00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
went
 
00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
kind of high school we put 10 kids
 
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
through this program
 
00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
um and it was so successful because of
 
00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:09.990 align:start position:0%
um and it was so successful because of
the

00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
interest from the students to continue
 
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
with the training
 
00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
we had a second grant from the
 
00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
foundation of ten thousand dollars
 
00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:20.720 align:start position:0%
we then expanded with the help of new
 
00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire mechanical trades not wanting
 
00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:24.310 align:start position:0%
hampshire mechanical trades not wanting
to

00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
add more dollars to their cost
 
00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
they actually contributed in kind
 
00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
services for the second program where we
 
00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
then were able to expand
 
00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
one high school to seven high schools
 
00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
and from 10 students to 20 students
 
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
this program
 
00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
that we're proposing would expand it
 
00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
once again
 
00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
not only for seacoast high schools but
 
00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
for greater manchester high schools also
 
00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
to be included since the new hampshire
 
00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
school of mechanical trades has a second
 
00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
location in manchester
 
00:35:58.870 --> 00:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
the success rate so far
 
00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
we have had close to 30 i believe it was
 
00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
29 students that actually completed the
 
00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:05.270 align:start position:0%
29 students that actually completed the
program

00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
and right now at the new hampshire
 
00:36:09.109 --> 00:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
school of mechanical trades we have 10
 
00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
that have gone on to extend
 
00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
training in a particular trade be it
 
00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
plumbing electrical
 
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
hvac oil and heating so it's been a
 
00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:20.950 align:start position:0%
hvac oil and heating so it's been a
success

00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
success
 
00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
and one of the things about this this
 
00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
grant application if you if i may
 
00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
is that we have now connected with
 
00:36:29.349 --> 00:36:29.359 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship new hampshire
 
00:36:32.069 --> 00:36:32.079 align:start position:0%
to where we'll be working with them as a
 
00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
follow-up once the
 
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
student goes through this program they
 
00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
will then have the opportunity and
 
00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
benefit to go into an apprenticeship
 
00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:41.910 align:start position:0%
benefit to go into an apprenticeship
program

00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
um and and this this grant application
 
00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
would support that
 
00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead thank you madam chair so i
 
00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
heard you say that this is taking care
 
00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
of seacoast and manchester
 
00:36:57.109 --> 00:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
that is correct would it be possible to
 
00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
dedicate some of these funds to the more
 
00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
rural areas
 
00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:01.349 align:start position:0%
rural areas
where

00:37:01.349 --> 00:37:01.359 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
i can tell you with my house undergoing
 
00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
some renovations there is a desperate
 
00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:06.069 align:start position:0%
some renovations there is a desperate
need

00:37:06.069 --> 00:37:06.079 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
for and i would like to see some of you
 
00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:09.280 align:start position:0%
some comment on that
 
00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:11.680 align:start position:0%
senator we we would love to expand this
 
00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
program at this point right now there
 
00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:15.270 align:start position:0%
program at this point right now there
are

00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:37:17.109 --> 00:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
only two locations from the new
 
00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire school of mechanical trades i
 
00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
know that there has been discussion
 
00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
which i ca i can't
 
00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
tell you exactly what the details are of
 
00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
them expanding uh to the north country
 
00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
and adding a third
 
00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
location but but i think it's important
 
00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
to to note that this particular
 
00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:37.910 align:start position:0%
to to note that this particular
concept

00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
concept
 
00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
we could do anywhere in the state if we
 
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
and so i would presume by that you mean
 
00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
some sort of a permanent structure
 
00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
that's correct okay
 
00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:54.320 align:start position:0%
yeah the um there are there are some
 
00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:57.200 align:start position:0%
programs not mechanical trades programs
 
00:37:58.550 --> 00:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
that are actually taking place in
 
00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
different high schools
 
00:38:03.109 --> 00:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
um but in this case with mechanical
 
00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
school of trades they have not only
 
00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
classroom facilities but actually
 
00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
workshops where the uh the young adults
 
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
can actually
 
00:38:16.829 --> 00:38:16.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:19.829 --> 00:38:19.839 align:start position:0%
training real quickly on that subject uh
 
00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
this uh program there are other partners
 
00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
involved with it the chambers being one
 
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
of them and they have demonstrated at
 
00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
least in this instance a real aptitude
 
00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
to get this program up and running uh we
 
00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
have committed to continue to working
 
00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
with them uh to find uh other locations
 
00:38:37.349 --> 00:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
to if this program is as successful as
 
00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
we expect it to be uh to grow this
 
00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
program statewide i mean that would be
 
00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
my goal with this because uh this is uh
 
00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
an area that we really need to focus on
 
00:38:47.109 --> 00:38:47.119 align:start position:0%
for reasons similar to what your
 
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
you have a follow-up or are you okay
 
00:38:58.550 --> 00:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
we we're we're creating cte centers all
 
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
around the state and we're enhancing
 
00:39:07.109 --> 00:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
them and proving them all the time
 
00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
why isn't there some kind of a
 
00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
synergistic relationship between these
 
00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
entities that we're creating and we're
 
00:39:17.109 --> 00:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
spending millions and millions of
 
00:39:19.349 --> 00:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
dollars to do that just think of what
 
00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
we're doing in hudson right now with the
 
00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
addition to the school but why isn't
 
00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:26.240 align:start position:0%
there a relationship you got a natural
 
00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
setting you talked about a bricks and
 
00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
mortar the bricks and mortars are there
 
00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
the question is
 
00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:33.109 align:start position:0%
the question is
um

00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
communication is there good
 
00:39:37.109 --> 00:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
communication there between the system
 
00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
the school systems that are that that
 
00:39:41.589 --> 00:39:41.599 align:start position:0%
are operating these cte centers i mean
 
00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
that's why all this money is being spent
 
00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
and we're we're we're programmed to keep
 
00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
spending this money this is an ongoing
 
00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
it's an ongoing situation
 
00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:52.640 align:start position:0%
and you know we're bonding and we're
 
00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
spending this money and it seems to me
 
00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:56.710 align:start position:0%
spending this money and it seems to me
that

00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:56.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:39:59.589 --> 00:39:59.599 align:start position:0%
it must not be working well if indeed
 
00:40:01.349 --> 00:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
you have to do something like this and
 
00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
you're looking for places to go
 
00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
tell me tell me why there isn't a
 
00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
cooperative situation
 
00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
there is actually senator and i know art
 
00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
for speaking for my department we have
 
00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
very good relationship with the cte
 
00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:13.990 align:start position:0%
very good relationship with the cte
centers

00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
centers
 
00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
across the state
 
00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:17.680 align:start position:0%
when i spoke to senator guida about how
 
00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
we're looking at ways to be able to
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
expand this program beyond just the
 
00:40:24.069 --> 00:40:24.079 align:start position:0%
manchester and seacoast areas into rural
 
00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
schools with cte programs that have
 
00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
exactly these types of programs i think
 
00:40:31.109 --> 00:40:31.119 align:start position:0%
that is our next target rather than
 
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
building something new that would be
 
00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
seeing no oh did you know the question
 
00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
i'll move the item all right thank you
 
00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:44.800 align:start position:0%

that anyone would like to ask
 
00:42:33.109 --> 00:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you madam chair jolly
 
00:42:37.589 --> 00:42:37.599 align:start position:0%
always a pleasure to see you
 
00:42:37.599 --> 00:42:39.109 align:start position:0%
always a pleasure to see you
uh

00:42:39.109 --> 00:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
i i've looked at the report i've looked
 
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
at the vacancy report uh commissioner
 
00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:45.589 align:start position:0%
at the vacancy report uh commissioner
and

00:42:45.589 --> 00:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
as as i look at it and i look at the
 
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
percentages in the departments
 
00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:59.750 --> 00:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:01.990 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:43:05.349 --> 00:43:05.359 align:start position:0%
how is this going to
 
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
enhance your ability i've sponsored a
 
00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation for you to do some
 
00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
things with with with recruitment but it
 
00:43:14.309 --> 00:43:14.319 align:start position:0%
seems to me our problem now is
 
00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
recruitment and retention
 
00:43:19.109 --> 00:43:19.119 align:start position:0%
we have a dual problem and when i look
 
00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:21.680 align:start position:0%
at the numbers we've got almost 2 000
 
00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
vacancies in state government
 
00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:24.829 align:start position:0%
vacancies in state government
spread

00:43:24.829 --> 00:43:24.839 align:start position:0%
spread
 
00:43:24.839 --> 00:43:26.630 align:start position:0%
spread
throughout

00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
throughout
 
00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:28.640 align:start position:0%
all of all of our departments
 
00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:29.589 align:start position:0%
all of all of our departments
so

00:43:29.589 --> 00:43:29.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
how is this going to be effective
 
00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
in supporting
 
00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:35.440 align:start position:0%
what what we need is that recruitment
 
00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:36.720 align:start position:0%
policy i guess
 
00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
so to put it in context for for
 
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
everybody um the current vacancy rate in
 
00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
state government is about 18 18 of
 
00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
authorized positions are not filled
 
00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
that's that's one of those things right
 
00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:51.839 align:start position:0%
every department has some positions they
 
00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
just don't fill because if we don't fill
 
00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
if we fill them we can't meet the lapse
 
00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:57.030 align:start position:0%
if we fill them we can't meet the lapse
requirement

00:43:57.030 --> 00:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
00:43:58.790 --> 00:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
you're counting on us to keep them to
 
00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
maintain a very healthy vacancy rate
 
00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
and uh if if state vacancy rates gets
 
00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:06.640 align:start position:0%
get below about 10 percent
 
00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
we can't function as state government
 
00:44:09.829 --> 00:44:09.839 align:start position:0%
because they're too low
 
00:44:12.309 --> 00:44:12.319 align:start position:0%
right and you you've budgeted them to be
 
00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
higher than that
 
00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
um but 18 is is really remarkably high
 
00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
it's ticking down a little bit i'll make
 
00:44:21.589 --> 00:44:21.599 align:start position:0%
that i'll make that note that in the
 
00:44:23.829 --> 00:44:23.839 align:start position:0%
first year of a budget vacancy rates
 
00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
tend to be higher legislatures budgets
 
00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
authorize lots of new positions and they
 
00:44:29.910 --> 00:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
take a while to fill so they tend to be
 
00:44:31.109 --> 00:44:31.119 align:start position:0%
higher in the first year lower in the
 
00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:32.240 align:start position:0%
second year
 
00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
vacancy rates in state government tend
 
00:44:37.829 --> 00:44:37.839 align:start position:0%
to be higher when it's a good economy
 
00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
for job seekers this is a very good
 
00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
economy for job seekers it's a wonderful
 
00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
economy for job seekers because there
 
00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
are lots more positions and there are
 
00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
people looking for them so state
 
00:44:49.829 --> 00:44:49.839 align:start position:0%
government in those circumstances tends
 
00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
to be a little um a little harder to
 
00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
come by we tend to be less nimble than
 
00:44:56.710 --> 00:44:56.720 align:start position:0%
other places um there are a lot of very
 
00:44:58.630 --> 00:44:58.640 align:start position:0%
attractive things about state service
 
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:00.640 align:start position:0%
notably the benefits and there are a lot
 
00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
of things that are a little less
 
00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
attractive in a vibrant economy notably
 
00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
the wages
 
00:45:07.510 --> 00:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:45:10.069 --> 00:45:10.079 align:start position:0%
some of that is to be understood
 
00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
part of what goes on though is that when
 
00:45:13.349 --> 00:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
the vacancy rates are relatively high is
 
00:45:13.359 --> 00:45:14.390 align:start position:0%
the vacancy rates are relatively high is
that

00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
the people in charge of hiring or the
 
00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
people who aren't getting their work
 
00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
done because they don't have people
 
00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
hired and when you're not getting your
 
00:45:21.349 --> 00:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
work done because you don't have
 
00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
somebody hired it's because you're
 
00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
taking on something else and you don't
 
00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
want to take time out from the work that
 
00:45:27.109 --> 00:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
you're doing because you don't have
 
00:45:29.349 --> 00:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
somebody to hire somebody that you don't
 
00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
have and it's sort of this vicious
 
00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
circle um in addition to that there are
 
00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
a bunch of areas we've heard from a
 
00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
bunch of agencies who've said
 
00:45:39.349 --> 00:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
we need help recruiting so the division
 
00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:40.640 align:start position:0%
of personnel came up with this plan
 
00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to hire three people whose
 
00:45:44.309 --> 00:45:44.319 align:start position:0%
job is to do nothing but recruit and
 
00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to start by focusing on the
 
00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
places that are particularly hard to
 
00:45:50.069 --> 00:45:50.079 align:start position:0%
hire for
 
00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
and we we we hope it's a pilot program
 
00:45:54.790 --> 00:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
and we hope it's going to work real well
 
00:45:58.230 --> 00:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
for the question yes please
 
00:46:00.309 --> 00:46:00.319 align:start position:0%
charlie i i agree with the premise i
 
00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
think it's a good one and i'd like to
 
00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
see it work out thank you
 
00:46:06.790 --> 00:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
but over the course of these fiscal
 
00:46:08.710 --> 00:46:08.720 align:start position:0%
committee meetings we have authorized an
 
00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
additional 83 positions
 
00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:12.640 align:start position:0%
that's so far
 
00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
and and we're authorizing more positions
 
00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:16.950 align:start position:0%
and and we're authorizing more positions
here

00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
when when when are we going to see the
 
00:46:21.589 --> 00:46:21.599 align:start position:0%
results of the recruitment and retention
 
00:46:21.599 --> 00:46:22.870 align:start position:0%
results of the recruitment and retention
policies

00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
policies
 
00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
that bring state government to the point
 
00:46:27.109 --> 00:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
where we're actually functioning
 
00:46:27.119 --> 00:46:28.390 align:start position:0%
where we're actually functioning
at

00:46:28.390 --> 00:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
and i never i i can never believe it's
 
00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
at total capacity sure but we're we're
 
00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:34.870 align:start position:0%
at total capacity sure but we're we're
addressing

00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
addressing
 
00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:38.240 align:start position:0%
the needs of state government and i know
 
00:46:40.069 --> 00:46:40.079 align:start position:0%
corrections is here and
 
00:46:43.270 --> 00:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
i've talked to them but indeed if these
 
00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:44.550 align:start position:0%
i've talked to them but indeed if these
problems

00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:44.560 align:start position:0%
problems
 
00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:45.990 align:start position:0%
problems
continue

00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
continue
 
00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
our ability to function
 
00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:51.200 align:start position:0%
is seriously affected very seriously
 
00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:52.550 align:start position:0%
is seriously affected very seriously
affected

00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
affected
 
00:46:56.069 --> 00:46:56.079 align:start position:0%
so some something's got to happen and
 
00:46:58.390 --> 00:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
i i hope these things are working but
 
00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
but indeed as i look at them i i just
 
00:47:04.309 --> 00:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
can't see that positive movement charlie
 
00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
and i hope it occurs
 
00:47:08.069 --> 00:47:08.079 align:start position:0%
there's not significant positive
 
00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
movement and and i don't want to pretend
 
00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
that there's going to be dramatic
 
00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
movement in any case
 
00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
our our task really is to do a lot of
 
00:47:17.109 --> 00:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
little things and to try to improve the
 
00:47:19.510 --> 00:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
situation um state government is always
 
00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
going to be fuller in a bad economy and
 
00:47:24.069 --> 00:47:24.079 align:start position:0%
emptier in a in a good economy that's
 
00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
that's that's the nature of the beast
 
00:47:29.109 --> 00:47:29.119 align:start position:0%
but our our task is to is to work with
 
00:47:31.349 --> 00:47:31.359 align:start position:0%
agencies to help them fill their highest
 
00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
priorities first and to get there um
 
00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
you know i mean i i don't know you know
 
00:47:38.309 --> 00:47:38.319 align:start position:0%
you think about you think about arpa and
 
00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
things like that there's a lot of
 
00:47:41.109 --> 00:47:41.119 align:start position:0%
construction money floating around
 
00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:42.640 align:start position:0%
and someone said we should build this
 
00:47:44.069 --> 00:47:44.079 align:start position:0%
and build this and build this which is
 
00:47:47.589 --> 00:47:47.599 align:start position:0%
all a great idea and and and i speak for
 
00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
my department we're very much in favor
 
00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:50.240 align:start position:0%
of building
 
00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
because we do buildings and everything's
 
00:47:53.109 --> 00:47:53.119 align:start position:0%
kind of a mess
 
00:47:53.119 --> 00:47:53.990 align:start position:0%
kind of a mess
um

00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:56.309 --> 00:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
but you need people to do it and you
 
00:47:58.309 --> 00:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
know uh
 
00:47:59.829 --> 00:47:59.839 align:start position:0%
somebody's having worked under his or
 
00:48:01.349 --> 00:48:01.359 align:start position:0%
her house i forgot who i wasn't paying
 
00:48:03.190 --> 00:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
that much not paying as much attention
 
00:48:05.109 --> 00:48:05.119 align:start position:0%
as i should have um
 
00:48:06.549 --> 00:48:06.559 align:start position:0%
but you know we've all experienced that
 
00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
at some point you want somebody to come
 
00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
fix the steps and there aren't that many
 
00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
bricklayers around
 
00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
so we're going to do everything we can
 
00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
to make a difference this is one thing
 
00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
that's going to make some difference
 
00:48:18.309 --> 00:48:18.319 align:start position:0%
but agencies
 
00:48:20.549 --> 00:48:20.559 align:start position:0%
ultimately it's at agencies and and we
 
00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:27.589 --> 00:48:27.599 align:start position:0%
uh senator morris
 
00:48:29.589 --> 00:48:29.599 align:start position:0%
charlie there's a 50 million dollar item
 
00:48:31.109 --> 00:48:31.119 align:start position:0%
that i think you just talked yourself
 
00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
out of that i've been looking at for
 
00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
fixing buildings so
 
00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
yeah and i can find a use for it so
 
00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
don't worry
 
00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:40.069 align:start position:0%
don't worry
um

00:48:40.069 --> 00:48:40.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:42.549 --> 00:48:42.559 align:start position:0%
can lba or charlie
 
00:48:46.829 --> 00:48:46.839 align:start position:0%
tell us what for seven months this 19
 
00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
vacancy equates to and then the other
 
00:48:52.549 --> 00:48:52.559 align:start position:0%
end of that question is because i i see
 
00:48:54.069 --> 00:48:54.079 align:start position:0%
it happening
 
00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
every time we come here how much of that
 
00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
think charlie can comment on the um
 
00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
number of positions that are vacant as
 
00:49:08.790 --> 00:49:08.800 align:start position:0%
far as
 
00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:10.720 align:start position:0%
i'm looking for
 
00:49:12.549 --> 00:49:12.559 align:start position:0%
other lines um
 
00:49:13.829 --> 00:49:13.839 align:start position:0%
that will take some time we can work
 
00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
with das to see what we can
 
00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
find anything that's come before you
 
00:49:20.309 --> 00:49:20.319 align:start position:0%
anything that's gone before gnc with the
 
00:49:20.319 --> 00:49:21.910 align:start position:0%
anything that's gone before gnc with the
transfer

00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
transfer
 
00:49:23.589 --> 00:49:23.599 align:start position:0%
from state personnel lines be it to
 
00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
overtime or something else
 
00:49:27.349 --> 00:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
we'll try to figure out a way to track
 
00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
that yeah i just bring it up because i
 
00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
know the senator's met with corrections
 
00:49:34.790 --> 00:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
i'm meeting with corrections um
 
00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
25 vacancy
 
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of money
 
00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
and we're transferring it into overtime
 
00:49:42.549 --> 00:49:42.559 align:start position:0%
which i understand we've done this every
 
00:49:46.069 --> 00:49:46.079 align:start position:0%
year i've been here several times a year
 
00:49:46.079 --> 00:49:47.589 align:start position:0%
year i've been here several times a year
but

00:49:47.589 --> 00:49:47.599 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
there's a reality of these dollars what
 
00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:51.200 align:start position:0%
are they
 
00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
and i don't think they total the laps
 
00:49:55.589 --> 00:49:55.599 align:start position:0%
dollars i think they far exceed it so
 
00:49:57.829 --> 00:49:57.839 align:start position:0%
as we're swimming in money
 
00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
and i know the chair from the house the
 
00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
chair from the senate are going to
 
00:50:04.790 --> 00:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
caution everybody stop spending
 
00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
because i think it's crazy that we're
 
00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
having a second budget year but i really
 
00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
do think beyond the budget numbers that
 
00:50:14.549 --> 00:50:14.559 align:start position:0%
you've put out in the public
 
00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
there's a huge lapse here
 
00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
and just in labor i mean and
 
00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
what is being what's happening
 
00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
with that i think we ought to keep our
 
00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
hands on because
 
00:50:28.069 --> 00:50:28.079 align:start position:0%
it's real easy to transfer out of the
 
00:50:29.910 --> 00:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
classified lines to somewhere else and
 
00:50:32.549 --> 00:50:32.559 align:start position:0%
fiscal gets to approve that and
 
00:50:35.589 --> 00:50:35.599 align:start position:0%
you know that's fine but it's spending
 
00:50:37.349 --> 00:50:37.359 align:start position:0%
and i think we ought to
 
00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
be careful there so
 
00:50:41.670 --> 00:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
um anyhow just
 
00:50:42.870 --> 00:50:42.880 align:start position:0%
i'll just note that
 
00:50:45.349 --> 00:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of agencies um where you
 
00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
can't transfer out of class 10. there
 
00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
are a few large agencies where you can
 
00:50:51.430 --> 00:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
but they are the exception of the rules
 
00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
so in most cases
 
00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
for your typical agency that money is
 
00:50:58.390 --> 00:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
going to have to lapse
 
00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
but when you take a department like
 
00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
corrections that's all state funded
 
00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
for the most part you when you transfer
 
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
that out to overtime lines it's
 
00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:10.640 align:start position:0%
significant number one
 
00:51:11.829 --> 00:51:11.839 align:start position:0%
i don't know how we ever solved the
 
00:51:14.069 --> 00:51:14.079 align:start position:0%
problem so we can talk about it till the
 
00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
cows come in you know the reality is
 
00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
it's a good starting job people go in
 
00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
and then they transfer to police
 
00:51:22.549 --> 00:51:22.559 align:start position:0%
departments throughout the state and
 
00:51:24.790 --> 00:51:24.800 align:start position:0%
you know we're just keep doing that same
 
00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
game but i mean the overtime's
 
00:51:30.309 --> 00:51:30.319 align:start position:0%
significant and i think we
 
00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
if that's how we solve the problem great
 
00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
but i'm not sure that they agree that
 
00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
that's great so
 
00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
but anyhow there's a lot of money
 
00:51:39.510 --> 00:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
involved here i think it's far exceeds
 
00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
that lapse that you mentioned charlie
 
00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
and uh that's what i'd like to find out
 
00:51:46.549 --> 00:51:46.559 align:start position:0%
i'm going to avoid any comment on
 
00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:53.670 --> 00:51:53.680 align:start position:0%
senator guy do you have a question
 
00:51:56.790 --> 00:51:56.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so
 
00:51:58.790 --> 00:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
if i heard you correctly
 
00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
when the economy is good
 
00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
historically the state suffers in its
 
00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
employment numbers
 
00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
yeah all right
 
00:52:08.950 --> 00:52:08.960 align:start position:0%
second thing i think i heard you say was
 
00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:11.030 align:start position:0%
second thing i think i heard you say was
that

00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:52:13.109 --> 00:52:13.119 align:start position:0%
employees leave because of
 
00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
better wages on the outside and they
 
00:52:16.630 --> 00:52:16.640 align:start position:0%
come here because of benefits on the
 
00:52:19.109 --> 00:52:19.119 align:start position:0%
inside so to speak correct
 
00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
well i i i think our biggest attraction
 
00:52:23.829 --> 00:52:23.839 align:start position:0%
you know i've been sitting through i'd
 
00:52:25.349 --> 00:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
do all the final interviews in our
 
00:52:27.990 --> 00:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
department lately and um
 
00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
i'd say 50 of the people i talked to
 
00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
when i said why are you interested they
 
00:52:32.470 --> 00:52:32.480 align:start position:0%
say wages
 
00:52:34.069 --> 00:52:34.079 align:start position:0%
it's particularly true at the lower
 
00:52:34.079 --> 00:52:35.109 align:start position:0%
it's particularly true at the lower
levels

00:52:35.109 --> 00:52:35.119 align:start position:0%
levels
 
00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
and it's particularly true of older
 
00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:37.990 align:start position:0%
and it's particularly true of older
workers

00:52:37.990 --> 00:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
workers
 
00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
25 year olds don't tend not to care
 
00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
about wages and 55 year olds 10 or
 
00:52:45.589 --> 00:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
benefits and 55 year olds do
 
00:52:47.589 --> 00:52:47.599 align:start position:0%
so for obvious reasons
 
00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
so the question is if we add three more
 
00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
personnel but we haven't changed the
 
00:52:53.829 --> 00:52:53.839 align:start position:0%
environment that produces this shortfall
 
00:52:56.230 --> 00:52:56.240 align:start position:0%
are we really helping anything
 
00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
well i
 
00:52:59.510 --> 00:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
i don't want to be fatalistic i i think
 
00:53:01.030 --> 00:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
it's one of the it's something to say
 
00:53:02.790 --> 00:53:02.800 align:start position:0%
that you know there are times when it's
 
00:53:05.109 --> 00:53:05.119 align:start position:0%
very difficult to hire but that doesn't
 
00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
mean you don't you don't try and it you
 
00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
know think of a business trying to work
 
00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:10.640 align:start position:0%
its way through a recession
 
00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:11.750 align:start position:0%
its way through a recession
um

00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
you know my mom was in real estate in
 
00:53:15.910 --> 00:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
detroit in the during the last couple of
 
00:53:17.589 --> 00:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
recessions which is sort of a
 
00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
theoretical activity more than an actual
 
00:53:21.589 --> 00:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
one and you don't stop trying to sell
 
00:53:23.589 --> 00:53:23.599 align:start position:0%
houses you're gonna sell fewer but if
 
00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
you stop trying you're gonna sell two
 
00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
and if you if you keep trying you may
 
00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
sell four where you wish you sold eight
 
00:53:32.870 --> 00:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
but you'd rather sell more so it's one
 
00:53:34.390 --> 00:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
of the things that we do we try what we
 
00:53:37.030 --> 00:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
can to do to hire and i think everything
 
00:53:39.430 --> 00:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
we do helps and in a particularly bad
 
00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:41.030 align:start position:0%
we do helps and in a particularly bad
situation

00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
um you know if the vacancy rate were two
 
00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:43.670 align:start position:0%
um you know if the vacancy rate were two
percent

00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:53:45.349 --> 00:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
three percent and i came to you and said
 
00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:47.200 align:start position:0%
we want to hire recruiters you should
 
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
send me send me off with a flea in my
 
00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:49.990 align:start position:0%
send me send me off with a flea in my
ear

00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
ear
 
00:53:52.790 --> 00:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
and um but it's not it's it's you know
 
00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
17.8 among classified workers or
 
00:53:57.510 --> 00:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
whatever the number is and uh and you
 
00:53:58.630 --> 00:53:58.640 align:start position:0%
should say
 
00:54:00.790 --> 00:54:00.800 align:start position:0%
you know what are we doing
 
00:54:02.230 --> 00:54:02.240 align:start position:0%
and you know departments say to us all
 
00:54:04.069 --> 00:54:04.079 align:start position:0%
the time what can you do to help we need
 
00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
to do something and so this is this is
 
00:54:08.309 --> 00:54:08.319 align:start position:0%
something it's not everything but it's
 
00:54:08.319 --> 00:54:11.750 align:start position:0%
something it's not everything but it's
something

00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:12.870 align:start position:0%
 
senate

00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:12.880 align:start position:0%
senate
 
00:54:14.790 --> 00:54:14.800 align:start position:0%
follow-up oh okay
 
00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
follow up so final question
 
00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
so these
 
00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:20.230 align:start position:0%
so these
positions

00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
would be utilized to recruit throughout
 
00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
state government yes okay thank you
 
00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
senator rosenwald you had a question
 
00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i'm just
 
00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
curious given the vacancy rate
 
00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
that you don't have
 
00:54:39.430 --> 00:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
current office space or furniture but
 
00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:42.530 align:start position:0%
you have to acquire more
 
00:54:42.530 --> 00:54:44.950 align:start position:0%
you have to acquire more
[Music]

00:54:44.950 --> 00:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:47.829 align:start position:0%
[Music]
well

00:54:47.829 --> 00:54:47.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:51.270 --> 00:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
as a testament to representative ober
 
00:54:52.870 --> 00:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
who i understand isn't here on this
 
00:54:54.309 --> 00:54:54.319 align:start position:0%
committee anymore but
 
00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
um she sort of hounded in us anytime you
 
00:54:58.950 --> 00:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
ask for a position make sure that you're
 
00:55:00.309 --> 00:55:00.319 align:start position:0%
that you ask for everything that goes
 
00:55:02.950 --> 00:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
along with it in this in this particular
 
00:55:04.630 --> 00:55:04.640 align:start position:0%
case there's the
 
00:55:07.109 --> 00:55:07.119 align:start position:0%
uh the vacancy rate um at the division
 
00:55:09.829 --> 00:55:09.839 align:start position:0%
of personnel is not high i think it may
 
00:55:11.589 --> 00:55:11.599 align:start position:0%
be close to zero and so we would need
 
00:55:11.599 --> 00:55:12.789 align:start position:0%
be close to zero and so we would need
desks

00:55:12.789 --> 00:55:12.799 align:start position:0%
desks
 
00:55:14.630 --> 00:55:14.640 align:start position:0%
in that case i mean there are desks in
 
00:55:16.549 --> 00:55:16.559 align:start position:0%
and around state government although
 
00:55:18.549 --> 00:55:18.559 align:start position:0%
realistically what a lot of agencies do
 
00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
is slowly replace their
 
00:55:23.910 --> 00:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
um world war ii surplus desks
 
00:55:26.069 --> 00:55:26.079 align:start position:0%
um which i'm fond of but not everybody
 
00:55:26.079 --> 00:55:27.030 align:start position:0%
um which i'm fond of but not everybody
is

00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:33.109 --> 00:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
senator mars well i just want to put in
 
00:55:35.190 --> 00:55:35.200 align:start position:0%
a plug that you have to get creative
 
00:55:37.589 --> 00:55:37.599 align:start position:0%
because we approved 15 million dollars
 
00:55:39.829 --> 00:55:39.839 align:start position:0%
to help with drf beds
 
00:55:42.390 --> 00:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
and building them in epping and i know
 
00:55:44.789 --> 00:55:44.799 align:start position:0%
throughout that whole process we told
 
00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:46.720 align:start position:0%
the hospital they have to bring
 
00:55:48.069 --> 00:55:48.079 align:start position:0%
employees from other parts of the
 
00:55:50.470 --> 00:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
country to get that up and running
 
00:55:52.549 --> 00:55:52.559 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reasons we put that
 
00:55:55.109 --> 00:55:55.119 align:start position:0%
pitch together and i think things like
 
00:55:56.950 --> 00:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
that are happening throughout government
 
00:55:58.870 --> 00:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
and you know as we go to the executive
 
00:56:00.870 --> 00:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
council with approval on that there was
 
00:56:03.030 --> 00:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of thought that went into how do
 
00:56:05.030 --> 00:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
we get a company to come in and bring
 
00:56:07.270 --> 00:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
jobs to new hampshire to help solve a
 
00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
problem that we know we have so i think
 
00:56:13.109 --> 00:56:13.119 align:start position:0%
that's we're doing that and i don't i
 
00:56:14.710 --> 00:56:14.720 align:start position:0%
think any business
 
00:56:16.950 --> 00:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
is competing with us for 19
 
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
i mean you know right now in vacancy
 
00:56:21.510 --> 00:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
rates um and that and that's no reason
 
00:56:24.549 --> 00:56:24.559 align:start position:0%
to go and do some kind of study to tell
 
00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:26.240 align:start position:0%
me that you have to raise the rates in
 
00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:28.640 align:start position:0%
government because the other side is
 
00:56:29.910 --> 00:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
going to raise their rates right when
 
00:56:32.069 --> 00:56:32.079 align:start position:0%
you do it so i think there's a balance
 
00:56:34.549 --> 00:56:34.559 align:start position:0%
here we'll figure it out but just keep
 
00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
fighting i mean i think people want
 
00:56:38.789 --> 00:56:38.799 align:start position:0%
these jobs and we should just keep
 
00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:41.440 align:start position:0%
promoting them so
 
00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:42.829 align:start position:0%
promoting them so
senator

00:56:42.829 --> 00:56:42.839 align:start position:0%
senator
 
00:56:45.430 --> 00:56:45.440 align:start position:0%
daniels thank you commissioner you
 
00:56:48.069 --> 00:56:48.079 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh that the new positions
 
00:56:50.230 --> 00:56:50.240 align:start position:0%
would focus on three particular areas
 
00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:52.160 align:start position:0%
could you identify those areas
 
00:56:54.630 --> 00:56:54.640 align:start position:0%
the the i'm gonna have to read the item
 
00:56:57.670 --> 00:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:04.640 align:start position:0%
you know we have issues with
 
00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
let me let me back up a step
 
00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:09.430 align:start position:0%
let me let me back up a step
um

00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:11.589 --> 00:57:11.599 align:start position:0%
what we need to focus on is anywhere in
 
00:57:13.270 --> 00:57:13.280 align:start position:0%
state government where we have
 
00:57:15.109 --> 00:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
difficulty hiring people there's some
 
00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
very obvious ones that people talk about
 
00:57:18.710 --> 00:57:18.720 align:start position:0%
all the time there are a lot of health
 
00:57:20.630 --> 00:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
care professions where we have
 
00:57:23.430 --> 00:57:23.440 align:start position:0%
difficulty maintaining a workforce
 
00:57:25.270 --> 00:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
there are you know i think every fiscal
 
00:57:26.710 --> 00:57:26.720 align:start position:0%
meeting i've been to
 
00:57:28.230 --> 00:57:28.240 align:start position:0%
somebody's talking about earth nurses
 
00:57:29.670 --> 00:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
right and that's an obvious thing that
 
00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
everyone's aware of we want to help to
 
00:57:34.309 --> 00:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
the extent that we can in that area but
 
00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
what we really need to do is to talk to
 
00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:38.630 align:start position:0%
what we really need to do is to talk to
um

00:57:38.630 --> 00:57:38.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:41.910 --> 00:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
agencies about worker worker classes
 
00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
where there are uh where there are large
 
00:57:46.870 --> 00:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
vacancies and whether or not we can help
 
00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
they're going to be some areas where
 
00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
someone says listen i got an issue with
 
00:57:51.829 --> 00:57:51.839 align:start position:0%
pharmacists and you're not going to help
 
00:57:53.910 --> 00:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
me with that i have a different plan for
 
00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
that there's going to be somebody else
 
00:57:56.950 --> 00:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
who says i have an issue here you are
 
00:57:58.789 --> 00:57:58.799 align:start position:0%
going to help me with that so the first
 
00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
thing we're actually going to do it's
 
00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:02.720 align:start position:0%
not really about specific areas like
 
00:58:03.750 --> 00:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
we're not going to do this we're not
 
00:58:05.829 --> 00:58:05.839 align:start position:0%
going to do that it's about identifying
 
00:58:07.109 --> 00:58:07.119 align:start position:0%
the areas where we can add the most
 
00:58:10.390 --> 00:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
value immediately and the the place we
 
00:58:12.549 --> 00:58:12.559 align:start position:0%
start with that is vacancies and some of
 
00:58:13.750 --> 00:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
them you know about some of them you
 
00:58:16.230 --> 00:58:16.240 align:start position:0%
don't right i have 40 vacancy rate among
 
00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
building service workers
 
00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
which you know i think we're the only
 
00:58:21.190 --> 00:58:21.200 align:start position:0%
people we're not the only people we have
 
00:58:22.549 --> 00:58:22.559 align:start position:0%
the most building service workers
 
00:58:24.150 --> 00:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
building service workers used to be
 
00:58:25.510 --> 00:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
called cleaners
 
00:58:27.030 --> 00:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
and they're wonderful people the last
 
00:58:29.349 --> 00:58:29.359 align:start position:0%
person i talk to every single day
 
00:58:31.670 --> 00:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
is beth who cleans the
 
00:58:34.390 --> 00:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
first floor and then some of the annex
 
00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:35.430 align:start position:0%
first floor and then some of the annex
and

00:58:35.430 --> 00:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:58:36.789 --> 00:58:36.799 align:start position:0%
you know god bless her she's been here a
 
00:58:39.829 --> 00:58:39.839 align:start position:0%
long time but um very few people it's
 
00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
not it's not an attractive job and
 
00:58:44.309 --> 00:58:44.319 align:start position:0%
exactly how we change the vacancy rate
 
00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:46.240 align:start position:0%
from 40
 
00:58:47.990 --> 00:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
because you know
 
00:58:49.829 --> 00:58:49.839 align:start position:0%
the state state workforce is a great
 
00:58:52.549 --> 00:58:52.559 align:start position:0%
thing but um it's not a lot to say about
 
00:58:54.309 --> 00:58:54.319 align:start position:0%
cleaning toilets it's just not the
 
00:58:57.190 --> 00:58:57.200 align:start position:0%
number one on anybody's list so so it's
 
00:58:58.630 --> 00:58:58.640 align:start position:0%
not really about areas it's about
 
00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:02.069 align:start position:0%
not really about areas it's about
vacancies

00:59:02.069 --> 00:59:02.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:05.109 --> 00:59:05.119 align:start position:0%
if i call if i recall correctly
 
00:59:07.829 --> 00:59:07.839 align:start position:0%
uh i believe in the budget the the house
 
00:59:09.109 --> 00:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
had put in
 
00:59:12.309 --> 00:59:12.319 align:start position:0%
a an amendment that said that hhs would
 
00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
have no more than 3 000 positions
 
00:59:18.870 --> 00:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
currently as i look at the vacant
 
00:59:21.190 --> 00:59:21.200 align:start position:0%
positions and and the positions there
 
00:59:23.670 --> 00:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
are currently 3249
 
00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:25.030 align:start position:0%
are currently 3249
positions

00:59:25.030 --> 00:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:59:28.230 --> 00:59:28.240 align:start position:0%
so as you're out there looking for hhs
 
00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:30.069 align:start position:0%
so as you're out there looking for hhs
personnel

00:59:30.069 --> 00:59:30.079 align:start position:0%
personnel
 
00:59:32.549 --> 00:59:32.559 align:start position:0%
knowing that you can't go more than
 
00:59:34.390 --> 00:59:34.400 align:start position:0%
three thousand
 
00:59:35.670 --> 00:59:35.680 align:start position:0%
how do you know
 
00:59:38.390 --> 00:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
where to look
 
00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:40.720 align:start position:0%
because well you we would not in a case
 
00:59:42.789 --> 00:59:42.799 align:start position:0%
like that we work with the agency on on
 
00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
on their greatest needs and and and
 
00:59:47.109 --> 00:59:47.119 align:start position:0%
trust them to know
 
00:59:49.270 --> 00:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
my sense is that the
 
00:59:51.190 --> 00:59:51.200 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
00:59:53.109 --> 00:59:53.119 align:start position:0%
has a better handle on its budget than i
 
00:59:53.119 --> 00:59:53.990 align:start position:0%
has a better handle on its budget than i
do

00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:59:56.789 --> 00:59:56.799 align:start position:0%
and can keep me out of trouble
 
00:59:59.510 --> 00:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
i guess my point is you're hiring three
 
01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
people to go out
 
01:00:04.069 --> 01:00:04.079 align:start position:0%
and look for for specific things
 
01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
right now there appear to be more
 
01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.349 align:start position:0%
right now there appear to be more
positions

01:00:07.349 --> 01:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
positions
 
01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
in hhs than were authorized by the
 
01:00:13.589 --> 01:00:13.599 align:start position:0%
legislature so it would be
 
01:00:13.599 --> 01:00:15.190 align:start position:0%
legislature so it would be
uh

01:00:15.190 --> 01:00:15.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:00:17.670 --> 01:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
somebody's duty to to instruct
 
01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
these three individuals just where
 
01:00:21.829 --> 01:00:21.839 align:start position:0%
they're going to be looking for
 
01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
help well
 
01:00:24.789 --> 01:00:24.799 align:start position:0%
it's something we would work on with
 
01:00:26.789 --> 01:00:26.799 align:start position:0%
with frankly with any department about
 
01:00:27.910 --> 01:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
you know what are your what are your
 
01:00:29.349 --> 01:00:29.359 align:start position:0%
needs where are you actually going to
 
01:00:31.510 --> 01:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
hire people and and frankly on some
 
01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
basic level a department will figure out
 
01:00:35.270 --> 01:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
whether they can or can't
 
01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
um in that sense and and i don't want to
 
01:00:39.030 --> 01:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
get into whether they have enough for
 
01:00:41.589 --> 01:00:41.599 align:start position:0%
too many or that's something i'll i'll
 
01:00:43.589 --> 01:00:43.599 align:start position:0%
promise to talk to karen about
 
01:00:45.190 --> 01:00:45.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:00:48.150 --> 01:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
01:00:49.829 --> 01:00:49.839 align:start position:0%
i do have one
 
01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh as you know mr arlinghaus we had
 
01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
suggested that you try to
 
01:00:59.030 --> 01:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
go out to hire a head hunting firm if
 
01:01:01.430 --> 01:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
that's the right term
 
01:01:03.829 --> 01:01:03.839 align:start position:0%
and i believe your answer was you wanted
 
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
to try this first and then you'd come
 
01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:06.789 align:start position:0%
to try this first and then you'd come
back

01:01:06.789 --> 01:01:06.799 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
to fiscal with a change
 
01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:09.670 align:start position:0%
to fiscal with a change
so

01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
how long
 
01:01:13.030 --> 01:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
are we supposed to let you
 
01:01:14.710 --> 01:01:14.720 align:start position:0%
do this
 
01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
well i i would say um you know given
 
01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
that given that
 
01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
bidding and hiring a hench hunter firm
 
01:01:24.630 --> 01:01:24.640 align:start position:0%
would take uh you know three to six
 
01:01:26.069 --> 01:01:26.079 align:start position:0%
months at least
 
01:01:26.079 --> 01:01:27.510 align:start position:0%
months at least
um

01:01:27.510 --> 01:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:28.789 --> 01:01:28.799 align:start position:0%
give me three months to see if i can
 
01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
hire anybody
 
01:01:32.710 --> 01:01:32.720 align:start position:0%
if i can't the distinction right is that
 
01:01:34.950 --> 01:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
if i can hire somebody then we don't
 
01:01:37.109 --> 01:01:37.119 align:start position:0%
need a firm to do this we don't need to
 
01:01:39.589 --> 01:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
to you know overpay a consultant
 
01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
if i can't hire anybody then we might
 
01:01:44.309 --> 01:01:44.319 align:start position:0%
need to overpay a consultant
 
01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
there are all kinds of problems with
 
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
having a consultant do this related to
 
01:01:49.750 --> 01:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
access to the system
 
01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
we can give we can give state employees
 
01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
access to the system in a way that we
 
01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
can't consultants without jumping
 
01:01:57.430 --> 01:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
through a whole lot of hoops and and
 
01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:59.029 align:start position:0%
through a whole lot of hoops and and
um

01:01:59.029 --> 01:01:59.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:00.789 --> 01:02:00.799 align:start position:0%
dennis goulet getting mad at us and
 
01:02:02.950 --> 01:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
while not letting us do it actually um
 
01:02:05.109 --> 01:02:05.119 align:start position:0%
so i think that ideally we would like to
 
01:02:07.029 --> 01:02:07.039 align:start position:0%
not hire not hire a consultant for this
 
01:02:09.670 --> 01:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
i think it's tailor-made for people
 
01:02:10.630 --> 01:02:10.640 align:start position:0%
and i
 
01:02:13.270 --> 01:02:13.280 align:start position:0%
my director personnel tells me that she
 
01:02:16.230 --> 01:02:16.240 align:start position:0%
feels very very confident or that we
 
01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
can hire for this position and i would
 
01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
anticipate um
 
01:02:23.109 --> 01:02:23.119 align:start position:0%
you know we would post immediately and
 
01:02:24.470 --> 01:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
and i'll be able to let you know in a
 
01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
month whether we've filled them or not
 
01:02:29.589 --> 01:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
so that would be my hope so give me a
 
01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
month of month or month and a half to
 
01:02:33.910 --> 01:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
hire and then give me three months to
 
01:02:35.910 --> 01:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
tell you if it's working okay as long as
 
01:02:37.349 --> 01:02:37.359 align:start position:0%
you don't poach from another
 
01:02:37.359 --> 01:02:39.510 align:start position:0%
you don't poach from another
organization

01:02:39.510 --> 01:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
organization
 
01:02:41.829 --> 01:02:41.839 align:start position:0%
okay you got that i uh you got that i
 
01:02:44.309 --> 01:02:44.319 align:start position:0%
can't promise that yeah we post a
 
01:02:46.309 --> 01:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
position people apply and
 
01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
oh yeah the 13th amendment prohibits me
 
01:02:52.230 --> 01:02:52.240 align:start position:0%
from telling them that i can't yeah well
 
01:02:53.990 --> 01:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
filling your position just creates
 
01:02:56.390 --> 01:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
another position it's i mean i
 
01:02:57.990 --> 01:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
i absolutely get that we have that issue
 
01:03:00.390 --> 01:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
all the time we we you know we hire and
 
01:03:02.069 --> 01:03:02.079 align:start position:0%
and oh they're coming from employment
 
01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
security and i said that because i'm
 
01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
pretty sure george isn't here but um
 
01:03:08.789 --> 01:03:08.799 align:start position:0%
that uh and they're like yeah what am i
 
01:03:10.789 --> 01:03:10.799 align:start position:0%
supposed to do now and well you steal
 
01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
somebody from from taylor and then you
 
01:03:15.109 --> 01:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
just go like that and but we're we're
 
01:03:16.630 --> 01:03:16.640 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of churn inside state
 
01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
government which is actually nice for
 
01:03:20.390 --> 01:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
people people like to be able to advance
 
01:03:23.029 --> 01:03:23.039 align:start position:0%
within the state but then we also get we
 
01:03:24.789 --> 01:03:24.799 align:start position:0%
do get a decent number of people coming
 
01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
in from outside too
 
01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:28.150 align:start position:0%
in from outside too
okay

01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
this goes into mike's list that he's
 
01:07:10.069 --> 01:07:10.079 align:start position:0%
keeping on how much money the house is
 
01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
spending and how much money the senate
 
01:07:12.870 --> 01:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
is spending
 
01:07:15.910 --> 01:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
this is a normal process i get it um i
 
01:07:18.470 --> 01:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
think it's a good process for any
 
01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:20.480 align:start position:0%
conceptual idea that the house is going
 
01:07:23.190 --> 01:07:23.200 align:start position:0%
to send the senate on 100 million
 
01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:24.470 align:start position:0%
to send the senate on 100 million
but

01:07:24.470 --> 01:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:07:26.549 --> 01:07:26.559 align:start position:0%
i think it's uh
 
01:07:28.390 --> 01:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
we need to keep this in mind because we
 
01:07:32.470 --> 01:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
do this every year and it's spending so
 
01:07:35.190 --> 01:07:35.200 align:start position:0%
we need to understand that
 
01:07:37.109 --> 01:07:37.119 align:start position:0%
thank you senator
 
01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:39.440 align:start position:0%

yeah
 
01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:57.189 align:start position:0%
yeah
my

01:08:57.189 --> 01:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:08:59.430 --> 01:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
i've met with corrections and
 
01:09:02.470 --> 01:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
asked corrections to uh
 
01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
come up maybe
 
01:09:06.390 --> 01:09:06.400 align:start position:0%
let's let's address their their
 
01:09:08.229 --> 01:09:08.239 align:start position:0%
situation because as senator morris is
 
01:09:10.470 --> 01:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
pointing out we we've been doing this
 
01:09:12.630 --> 01:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
every year that i've been on the fiscal
 
01:09:14.470 --> 01:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
committee for a long long period of time
 
01:09:16.709 --> 01:09:16.719 align:start position:0%
but when you look at the vacancy rate
 
01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh at corrections
 
01:09:22.309 --> 01:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
the rate the the the vacancy rate is
 
01:09:23.910 --> 01:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
extremely high
 
01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh they've used
 
01:09:29.590 --> 01:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
the national guard in the kitchen
 
01:09:32.470 --> 01:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
to help out and we have to pay back
 
01:09:34.070 --> 01:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
the national guard we're gonna use our
 
01:09:36.309 --> 01:09:36.319 align:start position:0%
funds i think to pay back 500 000 to the
 
01:09:37.990 --> 01:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
national guard
 
01:09:39.430 --> 01:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
the overtime
 
01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:41.189 align:start position:0%
the overtime
is

01:09:41.189 --> 01:09:41.199 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:09:43.030 --> 01:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
as as it is here it's it's going to
 
01:09:44.789 --> 01:09:44.799 align:start position:0%
reach 15 million
 
01:09:46.870 --> 01:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
maybe more i'm not sure
 
01:09:48.390 --> 01:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
but think about the second year of the
 
01:09:51.189 --> 01:09:51.199 align:start position:0%
biennium if we don't make those two so
 
01:09:53.269 --> 01:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
just a q if i meant a question to the to
 
01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
the group i i understand you do a
 
01:09:58.630 --> 01:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
magnificent job at maintaining
 
01:10:00.790 --> 01:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
what we have and i credit you for that
 
01:10:03.270 --> 01:10:03.280 align:start position:0%
i've been involved with corrections for
 
01:10:04.790 --> 01:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
most of the time i've been in state
 
01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:06.790 align:start position:0%
most of the time i've been in state
government

01:10:06.790 --> 01:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
the pro the problem that we face now i
 
01:10:12.229 --> 01:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
think is exacerbated
 
01:10:12.239 --> 01:10:13.910 align:start position:0%
think is exacerbated
because

01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:10:16.470 --> 01:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
we just can't find people to fill these
 
01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
corrections jobs
 
01:10:20.790 --> 01:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
the overtime is uh
 
01:10:23.669 --> 01:10:23.679 align:start position:0%
unbelievable and
 
01:10:25.990 --> 01:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
where do we go i mean
 
01:10:29.669 --> 01:10:29.679 align:start position:0%
there's got to be a solution out there
 
01:10:29.679 --> 01:10:31.110 align:start position:0%
there's got to be a solution out there
because

01:10:31.110 --> 01:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:10:33.110 --> 01:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
look at these transfers they take place
 
01:10:35.910 --> 01:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
from authorized positions authorized
 
01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:37.030 align:start position:0%
from authorized positions authorized
benefits

01:10:37.030 --> 01:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
it would move so
 
01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
we always we're always talking about the
 
01:10:42.550 --> 01:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
laps well
 
01:10:44.950 --> 01:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
there's never any lapse from corrections
 
01:10:47.030 --> 01:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
right there's no lapse there
 
01:10:48.870 --> 01:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
but but indeed
 
01:10:51.430 --> 01:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
that this is a this is a problem
 
01:10:54.070 --> 01:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
a very significant problem that that
 
01:10:57.990 --> 01:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
really has to be dealt with
 
01:11:00.070 --> 01:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
can anyone argue with that
 
01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's i understand
 
01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:05.830 align:start position:0%
the the
the

01:11:05.830 --> 01:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
the argument is what's the solution yeah
 
01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
i i agree i agree thank you thank you
 
01:11:13.030 --> 01:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
madam chair yes
 
01:11:14.550 --> 01:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
to the department
 
01:11:16.149 --> 01:11:16.159 align:start position:0%
you know uh
 
01:11:18.550 --> 01:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
what is that what is our game plan here
 
01:11:19.830 --> 01:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:11:21.669 --> 01:11:21.679 align:start position:0%
i think we've made
 
01:11:23.669 --> 01:11:23.679 align:start position:0%
changes about standards and training
 
01:11:23.679 --> 01:11:25.669 align:start position:0%
changes about standards and training
right

01:11:25.669 --> 01:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
in a very quick fashion when it comes to
 
01:11:29.590 --> 01:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
taking these people so
 
01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
the question is do we have a game plan
 
01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
going forward that could address this
 
01:11:37.669 --> 01:11:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:38.950 --> 01:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you senator
 
01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:40.640 align:start position:0%
d'alessandro for
 
01:11:42.550 --> 01:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
sharing all of that information i hope
 
01:11:44.149 --> 01:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
that the committee did receive the
 
01:11:45.830 --> 01:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
activities within the department that we
 
01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:46.709 align:start position:0%
activities within the department that we
have

01:11:46.709 --> 01:11:46.719 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:11:48.790 --> 01:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
engaged in over the last several years
 
01:11:50.709 --> 01:11:50.719 align:start position:0%
to be unique and within the authority of
 
01:11:52.870 --> 01:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
law that we have to both recruit and
 
01:11:54.709 --> 01:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
work to retain our employees that we
 
01:11:57.669 --> 01:11:57.679 align:start position:0%
have and in the resource materials that
 
01:11:59.350 --> 01:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
i've sent forward
 
01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
we were making what i would call strides
 
01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
until coveted 19 hit our institution and
 
01:12:06.470 --> 01:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
even in the first what i would call full
 
01:12:08.790 --> 01:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
year 2020 we did better than i thought
 
01:12:10.950 --> 01:12:10.960 align:start position:0%
we were going to do i'll tell you that
 
01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
second this past second year of working
 
01:12:15.430 --> 01:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
in corrections
 
01:12:17.350 --> 01:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
changing our mitigation strategies we
 
01:12:18.790 --> 01:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
lost a lot of tenured people because
 
01:12:20.950 --> 01:12:20.960 align:start position:0%
they were simply tired and then on top
 
01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
of then i'll quote your term poaching
 
01:12:25.510 --> 01:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
we have a unique
 
01:12:27.669 --> 01:12:27.679 align:start position:0%
law enforcement branch of the justice
 
01:12:31.189 --> 01:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
system our employees work day in day out
 
01:12:33.669 --> 01:12:33.679 align:start position:0%
one-on-one with people with felonies
 
01:12:36.310 --> 01:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
bottom line in a very i'll talk about
 
01:12:38.229 --> 01:12:38.239 align:start position:0%
new hampshire state prison for men old
 
01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
institution so when we're training
 
01:12:42.870 --> 01:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
people that their first line of defense
 
01:12:45.270 --> 01:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
are their verbal de-escalation skills
 
01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
and nationally we're saying that police
 
01:12:49.030 --> 01:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
in the community need to improve their
 
01:12:51.270 --> 01:12:51.280 align:start position:0%
verbal de-escalation skills
 
01:12:53.590 --> 01:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
the corrections employees with
 
01:12:54.950 --> 01:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
you know call it two three years
 
01:12:56.950 --> 01:12:56.960 align:start position:0%
experience are very attractive
 
01:12:59.189 --> 01:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
candidates and then the commensurate
 
01:13:01.430 --> 01:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
equity in wages we pay about ten
 
01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars less to a starting
 
01:13:05.189 --> 01:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
corrections officer that's fully
 
01:13:07.830 --> 01:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
certified than they do and they pay ten
 
01:13:09.669 --> 01:13:09.679 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars more in municipal
 
01:13:11.990 --> 01:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
policing and a state trooper who uh
 
01:13:13.590 --> 01:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
state troopers are struggling as well to
 
01:13:15.430 --> 01:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
recruit people are waiving a lot of
 
01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
their i'll defer to them but in the
 
01:13:18.630 --> 01:13:18.640 align:start position:0%
discussions i've had with them waiving
 
01:13:20.550 --> 01:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
some of their minimum qualifications for
 
01:13:21.990 --> 01:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
physically able
 
01:13:24.310 --> 01:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
psychologically screened candidates
 
01:13:26.550 --> 01:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
so law enforcement in general has faced
 
01:13:29.189 --> 01:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
a hit so when we look at corrections and
 
01:13:31.189 --> 01:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
i thank the legislature for letting us
 
01:13:33.189 --> 01:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
use the transfer strategy of using
 
01:13:35.350 --> 01:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
vacancies because it is the vacancies
 
01:13:36.870 --> 01:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
that are resulting in the overtime to
 
01:13:38.310 --> 01:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
move to overtime
 
01:13:40.149 --> 01:13:40.159 align:start position:0%
because it sends a message to the people
 
01:13:42.390 --> 01:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
working in corrections today that none
 
01:13:44.390 --> 01:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
of us have given up to provide them the
 
01:13:46.470 --> 01:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
resources they need not to work the
 
01:13:48.950 --> 01:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
intense overtime hours and the last two
 
01:13:51.590 --> 01:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
years kova 19 has been the reason we've
 
01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
leaned on the national guard because on
 
01:13:55.110 --> 01:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
top of the vacancies people were
 
01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
legitimately sick and so i had
 
01:13:58.630 --> 01:13:58.640 align:start position:0%
individuals who were corrections
 
01:14:00.149 --> 01:14:00.159 align:start position:0%
officers out of the work environment to
 
01:14:03.430 --> 01:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
the tune of maybe 45 or more in a day on
 
01:14:05.669 --> 01:14:05.679 align:start position:0%
top of our vacancies just fully
 
01:14:08.070 --> 01:14:08.080 align:start position:0%
exacerbated the situation
 
01:14:10.310 --> 01:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
so part of what we've done uniquely is
 
01:14:12.229 --> 01:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
we literally started an introductions to
 
01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
corrections course at the berlin high
 
01:14:16.950 --> 01:14:16.960 align:start position:0%
school we had seven participants in the
 
01:14:19.350 --> 01:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
first class and now we've had a maximum
 
01:14:21.189 --> 01:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
capacity in the second class we're
 
01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
offering so we're going to look to
 
01:14:24.310 --> 01:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
teaching people what corrections
 
01:14:26.870 --> 01:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
literally is that we're not guards we're
 
01:14:29.270 --> 01:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
not watching that table we're correcting
 
01:14:30.630 --> 01:14:30.640 align:start position:0%
people and changing a pattern of
 
01:14:33.030 --> 01:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
behavior we are one-on-one working with
 
01:14:34.950 --> 01:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
individuals with who are committed in
 
01:14:37.350 --> 01:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
many instances egregious crimes and are
 
01:14:38.950 --> 01:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
also struggling with mental health and
 
01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder and they need the
 
01:14:42.630 --> 01:14:42.640 align:start position:0%
support of strong
 
01:14:44.630 --> 01:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
people day in and day out to correct
 
01:14:46.870 --> 01:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
patterns of behavior so
 
01:14:48.390 --> 01:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
i thank you for
 
01:14:50.070 --> 01:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
asking that question i think it's
 
01:14:52.310 --> 01:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
important that this is a profession
 
01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:53.830 align:start position:0%
important that this is a profession
worth

01:14:53.830 --> 01:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
worth
 
01:14:55.990 --> 01:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
continuing to fight for but there are
 
01:14:57.669 --> 01:14:57.679 align:start position:0%
some equities that the agency's trying
 
01:14:59.270 --> 01:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
to resolve and we will need the
 
01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
legislators support so that we're not
 
01:15:03.669 --> 01:15:03.679 align:start position:0%
training fully qualified people who are
 
01:15:05.110 --> 01:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
literally going to another branch of
 
01:15:06.470 --> 01:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
state government to make ten thousand
 
01:15:10.149 --> 01:15:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:12.149 --> 01:15:12.159 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative
 
01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
sorry senator guida thank you madam
 
01:15:15.990 --> 01:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
chair commissioner good to see you nice
 
01:15:18.310 --> 01:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
to see you um
 
01:15:19.430 --> 01:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
when a
 
01:15:21.590 --> 01:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
corrections officer newly trained comes
 
01:15:23.430 --> 01:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
out of the police academy
 
01:15:24.950 --> 01:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
it comes over to you is there any
 
01:15:26.630 --> 01:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
contractual requirement that they remain
 
01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
for a period of time
 
01:15:30.470 --> 01:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
and is that a possibility that could be
 
01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
implemented i don't know contracts and
 
01:15:33.189 --> 01:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
so forth
 
01:15:34.709 --> 01:15:34.719 align:start position:0%
uh senator grant that's a great question
 
01:15:36.550 --> 01:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
there's no contractual relationship
 
01:15:38.709 --> 01:15:38.719 align:start position:0%
there like any other state employee as
 
01:15:39.990 --> 01:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
you heard commissioner earling how
 
01:15:41.590 --> 01:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
someone can recruit them for another
 
01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity that they certify for i will
 
01:15:45.910 --> 01:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
tell you i've seen a few other states
 
01:15:48.470 --> 01:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
that do require i'll call it a tenure in
 
01:15:51.110 --> 01:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
corrections before they can go work in a
 
01:15:53.430 --> 01:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
certified police occupation and i i
 
01:15:54.790 --> 01:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
think i would have my other law
 
01:15:56.310 --> 01:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement partners telling you don't
 
01:15:58.390 --> 01:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
do that to me but that's been some of
 
01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
regardless of the other law enforcement
 
01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
agencies we're here to deal with
 
01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
corrections problems and so would this
 
01:16:10.149 --> 01:16:10.159 align:start position:0%
be something that would be implementable
 
01:16:12.229 --> 01:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
under your uh leadership uh senator
 
01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
guide i think we would have to put
 
01:16:16.310 --> 01:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
forward a legislative change and see
 
01:16:18.229 --> 01:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
what the pallet of the legislature was
 
01:16:21.430 --> 01:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
but i think it's possible
 
01:16:24.229 --> 01:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
01:16:26.630 --> 01:16:26.640 align:start position:0%
yes representative leishman
 
01:16:29.270 --> 01:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
thanks thanks madam chair
 
01:16:32.390 --> 01:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
and thanks commissioner good to see you
 
01:16:34.070 --> 01:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
just a follow-up to representative
 
01:16:36.070 --> 01:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
geider's question we've heard of
 
01:16:38.229 --> 01:16:38.239 align:start position:0%
industry providing some sort of
 
01:16:40.630 --> 01:16:40.640 align:start position:0%
help towards education like a financial
 
01:16:42.470 --> 01:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
benefit and then that individual has to
 
01:16:44.149 --> 01:16:44.159 align:start position:0%
sign some kind of agreement with that
 
01:16:46.149 --> 01:16:46.159 align:start position:0%
employer to stay for a certain period of
 
01:16:48.790 --> 01:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
time would that be something worth
 
01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
the legislature looking at
 
01:16:53.830 --> 01:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
represented bleachman i i think that's
 
01:16:55.990 --> 01:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
an excellent question again i had
 
01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.510 align:start position:0%
an excellent question again i had
suggested

01:16:57.510 --> 01:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
suggested
 
01:16:58.950 --> 01:16:58.960 align:start position:0%
again talking about state employee
 
01:17:01.110 --> 01:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
vacancies before bargaining they had
 
01:17:02.950 --> 01:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
asked me what do you think commissioner
 
01:17:05.189 --> 01:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
and i said well what i'm hearing from my
 
01:17:07.270 --> 01:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
staff is if we did something in the
 
01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
education realm that people would stay
 
01:17:10.709 --> 01:17:10.719 align:start position:0%
on longer but they're going and
 
01:17:12.310 --> 01:17:12.320 align:start position:0%
advancing their career someplace else so
 
01:17:14.149 --> 01:17:14.159 align:start position:0%
it's another i'll call it carrot or
 
01:17:16.470 --> 01:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
attraction to come work for corrections
 
01:17:19.990 --> 01:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:26.550 --> 01:17:26.560 align:start position:0%
i have one
 
01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:28.870 align:start position:0%
i have one
um

01:17:28.870 --> 01:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:31.910 --> 01:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
is the vacancy rate
 
01:17:34.229 --> 01:17:34.239 align:start position:0%
higher at the men's prison than the
 
01:17:36.950 --> 01:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
women's prison
 
01:17:38.790 --> 01:17:38.800 align:start position:0%
as of today madam chair i think they're
 
01:17:41.110 --> 01:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
almost equitable tell you that since uh
 
01:17:43.110 --> 01:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
submitting the information our security
 
01:17:45.590 --> 01:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate is 33 percent that's the
 
01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
highest i've ever seen it
 
01:17:49.350 --> 01:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
and we have some promising new
 
01:17:52.070 --> 01:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
candidates coming uh but it's again with
 
01:17:53.590 --> 01:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
that type of vacancy rate we're going to
 
01:17:56.229 --> 01:17:56.239 align:start position:0%

okay thank you and i i do want to give
 
01:18:00.310 --> 01:18:00.320 align:start position:0%

yes
 
01:18:14.229 --> 01:18:14.239 align:start position:0%
that's because of the terrific job she
 
01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
did when we were doing the budget when
 
01:18:18.870 --> 01:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
we talked about dealing with medical
 
01:18:21.590 --> 01:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
costs how we could reduce medical costs
 
01:18:24.070 --> 01:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
so i give her kudos for that uh we gave
 
01:18:26.229 --> 01:18:26.239 align:start position:0%
her an assignment
 
01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:27.840 align:start position:0%

thanks uh karen good to see you as well
 
01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:25.669 align:start position:0%
thanks uh karen good to see you as well
uh

01:21:25.669 --> 01:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:21:29.030 --> 01:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
the request you have for six positions
 
01:21:31.430 --> 01:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
now when you folks appeared before us i
 
01:21:33.669 --> 01:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
believe back in october
 
01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
on the 22nd
 
01:21:37.350 --> 01:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that
 
01:21:40.149 --> 01:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
in all likelihood the services to run
 
01:21:43.189 --> 01:21:43.199 align:start position:0%
hampstead would be contracted
 
01:21:45.189 --> 01:21:45.199 align:start position:0%
so i was a little surprised to see the
 
01:21:46.950 --> 01:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
number of positions
 
01:21:49.110 --> 01:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
and the cost for the positions in this
 
01:21:51.189 --> 01:21:51.199 align:start position:0%
request could you explain
 
01:21:52.790 --> 01:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
the need now
 
01:21:54.470 --> 01:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
in the response that
 
01:21:56.310 --> 01:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
you provided to some of our questions
 
01:21:58.390 --> 01:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
you did say it was going to be similar
 
01:22:01.110 --> 01:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
to the existing state hospital contract
 
01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:01.910 align:start position:0%
to the existing state hospital contract
so

01:22:01.910 --> 01:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:22:04.550 --> 01:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
could you explain how those two line up
 
01:22:06.229 --> 01:22:06.239 align:start position:0%
sure so i i believe that the
 
01:22:07.669 --> 01:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
commissioner did testify that it was
 
01:22:09.430 --> 01:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
always our intention to keep senior
 
01:22:11.590 --> 01:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
leadership as state employees
 
01:22:13.830 --> 01:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
it offers the state a lot more control
 
01:22:16.390 --> 01:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
over the facility to have the senior
 
01:22:18.790 --> 01:22:18.800 align:start position:0%
leadership be state employees
 
01:22:21.590 --> 01:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
the salary levels are in line with the
 
01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
salaries that are paid to current new
 
01:22:25.350 --> 01:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital executive executives
 
01:22:27.590 --> 01:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
and department executives
 
01:22:29.350 --> 01:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
so that is where those salary amounts
 
01:22:31.669 --> 01:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
are coming from there is legislation in
 
01:22:35.270 --> 01:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
place to create unclassified positions
 
01:22:37.270 --> 01:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
and those unclassified positions will go
 
01:22:38.790 --> 01:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
through the corn ferry process to
 
01:22:40.790 --> 01:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
receive the final salaries so the these
 
01:22:43.270 --> 01:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
positions are essentially temporary so
 
01:22:44.709 --> 01:22:44.719 align:start position:0%
that we can hire
 
01:22:46.310 --> 01:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
the people into them and then they will
 
01:22:48.390 --> 01:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
be transferred to uh permanent
 
01:22:51.590 --> 01:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
unclassified positions later
 
01:22:55.750 --> 01:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
the other piece which i um mentioned in
 
01:22:57.750 --> 01:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
i meant to mention in my answer i may
 
01:22:59.350 --> 01:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
have forgotten
 
01:23:01.510 --> 01:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
the revenue cycle team will also be
 
01:23:02.950 --> 01:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
state employees but those will be
 
01:23:04.629 --> 01:23:04.639 align:start position:0%
classified employees so you will see
 
01:23:06.950 --> 01:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
those come through in the operating
 
01:23:08.470 --> 01:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
budget when i bring that forward to the
 
01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:09.590 align:start position:0%
budget when i bring that forward to the
committee

01:23:09.590 --> 01:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:23:12.070 --> 01:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
revenue cycle being the employees that
 
01:23:13.510 --> 01:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
are working with the insurance companies
 
01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:14.790 align:start position:0%
are working with the insurance companies
collecting

01:23:14.790 --> 01:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
collecting
 
01:23:16.550 --> 01:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
the funds and depositing them because
 
01:23:19.030 --> 01:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
those revenues will be state revenues
 
01:23:21.270 --> 01:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
so there there is a a handful of state
 
01:23:23.910 --> 01:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
employees that um will be part of
 
01:23:26.709 --> 01:23:26.719 align:start position:0%
operating hampstead
 
01:23:30.149 --> 01:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
further question ma'am chair yes
 
01:23:32.390 --> 01:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
so i went back and looked at the minutes
 
01:23:35.830 --> 01:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
from the october 22nd meeting
 
01:23:37.669 --> 01:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
i just want to read a portion i believe
 
01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
this was a
 
01:23:41.590 --> 01:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner shibanette's response to
 
01:23:43.669 --> 01:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
representative edward's concern about
 
01:23:46.870 --> 01:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
the staffing issue of the hospital
 
01:23:49.590 --> 01:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
so it go she goes on to say do the some
 
01:23:51.350 --> 01:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
staffing issues
 
01:23:53.110 --> 01:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
they have not been able to expand their
 
01:23:55.189 --> 01:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
services meeting hampstead hospital i
 
01:23:58.470 --> 01:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
assume yes our goal is again to purchase
 
01:24:01.750 --> 01:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
hampstead in contract with a third party
 
01:24:03.990 --> 01:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
to assist in running it
 
01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.030 align:start position:0%
to assist in running it
so

01:24:05.030 --> 01:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:24:07.270 --> 01:24:07.280 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm concerned with the number of
 
01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
positions you're requesting i could see
 
01:24:11.590 --> 01:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
like a contract officer
 
01:24:13.830 --> 01:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
someone to oversee the running but
 
01:24:16.390 --> 01:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
six positions which include senior
 
01:24:18.390 --> 01:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
management to run a facility that right
 
01:24:20.709 --> 01:24:20.719 align:start position:0%
now has only 45
 
01:24:22.870 --> 01:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
individuals under their care
 
01:24:25.830 --> 01:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
so i i think that uh not to be nuanced
 
01:24:27.510 --> 01:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
but her response was assist in running
 
01:24:29.990 --> 01:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
the facility so i think that that
 
01:24:31.350 --> 01:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
may not have been
 
01:24:32.950 --> 01:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
the most direct way to say that there
 
01:24:34.790 --> 01:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
would be state employees there but i i
 
01:24:36.390 --> 01:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
don't think that that
 
01:24:37.590 --> 01:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
ruled out that there would be state
 
01:24:38.950 --> 01:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
employees there
 
01:24:41.110 --> 01:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
um i think as far as the number of beds
 
01:24:43.430 --> 01:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
we've made it very clear that our intent
 
01:24:45.189 --> 01:24:45.199 align:start position:0%
is to expand the number of beds as
 
01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
quickly as we possibly can and this is a
 
01:24:50.229 --> 01:24:50.239 align:start position:0%
24-hour facility so it certainly
 
01:24:53.350 --> 01:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
requires a number of executives it's a
 
01:24:55.669 --> 01:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
you know right now a ten tens of
 
01:24:57.510 --> 01:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars business so it
 
01:24:59.910 --> 01:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
requires a cfo it requires accounting
 
01:25:01.350 --> 01:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
staff um
 
01:25:02.790 --> 01:25:02.800 align:start position:0%
i i think that these positions are
 
01:25:05.990 --> 01:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely required to run this facility
 
01:25:07.669 --> 01:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
i don't have any further madam chair but
 
01:25:09.350 --> 01:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:25:10.390 --> 01:25:10.400 align:start position:0%
are there
 
01:25:12.709 --> 01:25:12.719 align:start position:0%
senator rosenwald
 
01:25:14.870 --> 01:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:25:17.189 --> 01:25:17.199 align:start position:0%
we got a report from administrative
 
01:25:19.990 --> 01:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
services about the vacancy rates
 
01:25:23.110 --> 01:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire hospital has a 26
 
01:25:25.350 --> 01:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
percent vacancy rate
 
01:25:28.550 --> 01:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
the bulk of which are over 90 days
 
01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:29.510 align:start position:0%
the bulk of which are over 90 days
vacant

01:25:29.510 --> 01:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
vacant
 
01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:31.430 align:start position:0%
vacant
so

01:25:31.430 --> 01:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:25:33.030 --> 01:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
how realistic
 
01:25:35.590 --> 01:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
is it that you can
 
01:25:38.310 --> 01:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
hire all the staff you're going to need
 
01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
for hampstead when we
 
01:25:43.189 --> 01:25:43.199 align:start position:0%
haven't been able to at the state
 
01:25:43.199 --> 01:25:44.870 align:start position:0%
haven't been able to at the state
hospital

01:25:44.870 --> 01:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
yes thank you so much for the question
 
01:25:48.709 --> 01:25:48.719 align:start position:0%
senator my name is marissa henn i'm an
 
01:25:50.470 --> 01:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
associate commissioner
 
01:25:51.830 --> 01:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
and i think one of the things that's
 
01:25:54.390 --> 01:25:54.400 align:start position:0%
important to consider here is how much
 
01:25:56.390 --> 01:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
of a transformation is really occurring
 
01:25:59.510 --> 01:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
at hampstead this is not um
 
01:26:01.110 --> 01:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
hampstead has served a critical role in
 
01:26:03.189 --> 01:26:03.199 align:start position:0%
partnership with the state in caring for
 
01:26:05.590 --> 01:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
children it has done a fantastic job
 
01:26:07.510 --> 01:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
the future is going to be so much more
 
01:26:09.510 --> 01:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
comprehensive in terms of what we will
 
01:26:10.950 --> 01:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
be able to offer
 
01:26:13.030 --> 01:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
youth adolescents across the state
 
01:26:14.950 --> 01:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
including standing up the first ever
 
01:26:16.390 --> 01:26:16.400 align:start position:0%
psychiatric residential treatment
 
01:26:18.629 --> 01:26:18.639 align:start position:0%
facility filling a huge gap in the
 
01:26:20.629 --> 01:26:20.639 align:start position:0%
continuum of services so
 
01:26:22.629 --> 01:26:22.639 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be easy um hiring is
 
01:26:25.189 --> 01:26:25.199 align:start position:0%
not easy right now but what we believe
 
01:26:27.669 --> 01:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
is that this will be an attractive place
 
01:26:27.679 --> 01:26:28.470 align:start position:0%
is that this will be an attractive place
for

01:26:28.470 --> 01:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:26:30.310 --> 01:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
people to come work because they will be
 
01:26:32.229 --> 01:26:32.239 align:start position:0%
part of of what the governor himself has
 
01:26:33.990 --> 01:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
said is and the commissioner as well is
 
01:26:36.470 --> 01:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
really a a state-of-the-art
 
01:26:37.990 --> 01:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
center of excellence
 
01:26:39.750 --> 01:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
ultimately and so i think that's part of
 
01:26:42.310 --> 01:26:42.320 align:start position:0%
it is attracting people based on the
 
01:26:44.470 --> 01:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
ways in which this is um this is a
 
01:26:46.950 --> 01:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
change in status quo and a part of a our
 
01:26:49.189 --> 01:26:49.199 align:start position:0%
larger transformation i think the second
 
01:26:51.510 --> 01:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
thing is that bringing in a vendor who
 
01:26:54.070 --> 01:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
has the capabilities the recruitment
 
01:26:57.110 --> 01:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
skills um the national linkages even to
 
01:26:59.350 --> 01:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
be able to attract people in a way that
 
01:27:01.030 --> 01:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
has not been possible previously we're
 
01:27:02.950 --> 01:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
seeing that right now with the temporary
 
01:27:05.750 --> 01:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
staff that you all approve funding for
 
01:27:07.350 --> 01:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
that has not been easy to bring in that
 
01:27:09.189 --> 01:27:09.199 align:start position:0%
strike team to hampstead but we're doing
 
01:27:10.950 --> 01:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
it we're effectively opening more beds
 
01:27:13.030 --> 01:27:13.040 align:start position:0%
the last several weeks
 
01:27:14.870 --> 01:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
thanks to the ability of a national
 
01:27:17.030 --> 01:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
vendor to extend its reach in bringing
 
01:27:22.390 --> 01:27:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
are there further questions senator
 
01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:25.350 align:start position:0%
are there further questions senator
morris

01:27:25.350 --> 01:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
morris
 
01:27:27.350 --> 01:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
just to be clear we're going to create a
 
01:27:28.870 --> 01:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
management team
 
01:27:32.310 --> 01:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
and we're hiring a vendor
 
01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:34.709 align:start position:0%
and we're hiring a vendor
correct

01:27:34.709 --> 01:27:34.719 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:27:36.790 --> 01:27:36.800 align:start position:0%
but there these positions will not be
 
01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:43.669 --> 01:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
representative lynn yeah i think i'm i'm
 
01:27:45.430 --> 01:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
a little bit confused i wonder if you
 
01:27:47.910 --> 01:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
could just explain uh
 
01:27:49.270 --> 01:27:49.280 align:start position:0%
for us
 
01:27:51.189 --> 01:27:51.199 align:start position:0%
the analogy i think you said at the
 
01:27:52.790 --> 01:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
beginning in response to representative
 
01:27:55.189 --> 01:27:55.199 align:start position:0%
leachman's question um you drew an
 
01:27:56.950 --> 01:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
analogy to the state hospital so i
 
01:27:58.310 --> 01:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
wonder if you could
 
01:28:01.270 --> 01:28:01.280 align:start position:0%
could you just explain for example
 
01:28:03.990 --> 01:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
how many at in the in the top management
 
01:28:06.709 --> 01:28:06.719 align:start position:0%
of the state hospital how many of those
 
01:28:09.030 --> 01:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
people are state employees and then what
 
01:28:11.430 --> 01:28:11.440 align:start position:0%
percentage of the people under them are
 
01:28:14.390 --> 01:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
not state employees and compare that or
 
01:28:15.910 --> 01:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
contrast that with
 
01:28:18.070 --> 01:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
what you envision for
 
01:28:19.590 --> 01:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
hampstead hospital
 
01:28:21.350 --> 01:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
so it's it's definitely not a perfect
 
01:28:23.030 --> 01:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
comparison for a number of reasons but
 
01:28:24.629 --> 01:28:24.639 align:start position:0%
the executive team is similar at new
 
01:28:26.390 --> 01:28:26.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital there's a ceo there's
 
01:28:29.110 --> 01:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
a ceo there's a cfo all of those things
 
01:28:30.950 --> 01:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
exist at new hampshire hospital and they
 
01:28:32.070 --> 01:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
are state employees they are
 
01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:33.590 align:start position:0%
are state employees they are
unclassified

01:28:33.590 --> 01:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
unclassified
 
01:28:35.189 --> 01:28:35.199 align:start position:0%
state employees
 
01:28:35.199 --> 01:28:36.470 align:start position:0%
state employees
the

01:28:36.470 --> 01:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:28:38.629 --> 01:28:38.639 align:start position:0%
the staff at new hampshire hospital
 
01:28:40.229 --> 01:28:40.239 align:start position:0%
there there of course is the contract
 
01:28:41.830 --> 01:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
with dartmouth that provides some of the
 
01:28:43.910 --> 01:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
clinical staff but many of the nurses at
 
01:28:45.590 --> 01:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hospital are state
 
01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:46.950 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hospital are state
employees

01:28:46.950 --> 01:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:28:48.470 --> 01:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
with the contract at hampstead we
 
01:28:50.229 --> 01:28:50.239 align:start position:0%
anticipate that all of the nursing staff
 
01:28:52.390 --> 01:28:52.400 align:start position:0%
will be contracted through the
 
01:28:54.870 --> 01:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
contractor so
 
01:28:57.030 --> 01:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
there are definitely less anticipated
 
01:28:58.550 --> 01:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
state employees at hampstead
 
01:29:00.149 --> 01:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
percentage-wise than there are at new
 
01:29:01.990 --> 01:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital
 
01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:03.110 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital
okay

01:29:03.110 --> 01:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:29:05.669 --> 01:29:05.679 align:start position:0%
follow-up and can i just ask is there is
 
01:29:08.550 --> 01:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
there a plan
 
01:29:11.750 --> 01:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
sort of for over the longer term
 
01:29:14.310 --> 01:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
that um as
 
01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:15.669 align:start position:0%
that um as
uh

01:29:15.669 --> 01:29:15.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:29:17.830 --> 01:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
people that are now contract or people
 
01:29:19.350 --> 01:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
that are envisioned to be contracted
 
01:29:22.070 --> 01:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
employees at hampstead hospital as
 
01:29:23.990 --> 01:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
as they sort of turn over that those
 
01:29:25.590 --> 01:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
people would be replaced with state
 
01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:27.270 align:start position:0%
people would be replaced with state
employees

01:29:27.270 --> 01:29:27.280 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:29:29.590 --> 01:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
no so right now um the in the
 
01:29:31.669 --> 01:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
commissioner has uh
 
01:29:31.679 --> 01:29:32.550 align:start position:0%
commissioner has uh
um

01:29:32.550 --> 01:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:35.350 --> 01:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
informed gmc of this as well our plan is
 
01:29:37.430 --> 01:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
to bring forward a contract a two-year
 
01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:38.550 align:start position:0%
to bring forward a contract a two-year
contract

01:29:38.550 --> 01:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
contract
 
01:29:40.709 --> 01:29:40.719 align:start position:0%
that it will be sole source because we
 
01:29:42.709 --> 01:29:42.719 align:start position:0%
need to move so quickly as we close on
 
01:29:43.990 --> 01:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
this facility
 
01:29:46.390 --> 01:29:46.400 align:start position:0%
during those two years we will evaluate
 
01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:47.669 align:start position:0%
during those two years we will evaluate
what

01:29:47.669 --> 01:29:47.679 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:29:49.669 --> 01:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
what the best model will be and have
 
01:29:51.669 --> 01:29:51.679 align:start position:0%
time to issue an rfp and all of those
 
01:29:53.750 --> 01:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
things so it won't happen
 
01:29:55.350 --> 01:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
rolling throughout those two years when
 
01:29:56.390 --> 01:29:56.400 align:start position:0%
we get
 
01:29:58.149 --> 01:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
through those two years there will be a
 
01:30:00.390 --> 01:30:00.400 align:start position:0%
new you know a potential a new model or
 
01:30:03.750 --> 01:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
the current model will continue
 
01:30:07.830 --> 01:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you senator daniels
 
01:30:09.910 --> 01:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
thank you is it your intent that the
 
01:30:11.910 --> 01:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
executive team that you hire is going to
 
01:30:14.229 --> 01:30:14.239 align:start position:0%
be ongoing operating costs
 
01:30:14.239 --> 01:30:15.110 align:start position:0%
be ongoing operating costs
yes

01:30:15.110 --> 01:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:15.990 align:start position:0%
yes
okay

01:30:15.990 --> 01:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:30:17.830 --> 01:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:30:19.510 --> 01:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
yet your request is that you're going to
 
01:30:21.189 --> 01:30:21.199 align:start position:0%
be using opera
 
01:30:24.070 --> 01:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
funds which are one-time funds yes do
 
01:30:26.790 --> 01:30:26.800 align:start position:0%
you find that a prudent way to use
 
01:30:30.390 --> 01:30:30.400 align:start position:0%
one-time money for ongoing costs
 
01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:31.750 align:start position:0%
one-time money for ongoing costs
so

01:30:31.750 --> 01:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:30:34.390 --> 01:30:34.400 align:start position:0%
i think that some of this is one time in
 
01:30:36.550 --> 01:30:36.560 align:start position:0%
the sense that
 
01:30:39.910 --> 01:30:39.920 align:start position:0%
we may hire them uh you know just prior
 
01:30:41.430 --> 01:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
to acquisition
 
01:30:43.270 --> 01:30:43.280 align:start position:0%
um you know we know that the purchase
 
01:30:45.189 --> 01:30:45.199 align:start position:0%
and sales is in place we may want to get
 
01:30:47.030 --> 01:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
some of those people on board and and
 
01:30:49.350 --> 01:30:49.360 align:start position:0%
moving things along as we come to closer
 
01:30:50.470 --> 01:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
to close
 
01:30:53.110 --> 01:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
um and we will be presenting an
 
01:30:54.870 --> 01:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
operating budget that will fund those
 
01:30:57.669 --> 01:30:57.679 align:start position:0%
positions as unclassified positions
 
01:31:00.629 --> 01:31:00.639 align:start position:0%
um and also we'll likely use arpa funds
 
01:31:02.149 --> 01:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
unless there was a bill in the
 
01:31:05.270 --> 01:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
legislature to appropriate general funds
 
01:31:08.149 --> 01:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
so i i think that the operating budget
 
01:31:10.070 --> 01:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
potentially does include some small
 
01:31:11.830 --> 01:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
amount of operating funds until we move
 
01:31:15.030 --> 01:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
into the budgeting process for
 
01:31:16.629 --> 01:31:16.639 align:start position:0%
i always have to think of the fiscal
 
01:31:18.310 --> 01:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
years in my head we're currently in 22
 
01:31:23.830 --> 01:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:25.750 --> 01:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
are there further questions uh senator
 
01:31:27.830 --> 01:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
guida thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:29.030 align:start position:0%
guida thank you madam chair thank you
karen

01:31:29.030 --> 01:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
karen
 
01:31:30.709 --> 01:31:30.719 align:start position:0%
so if i'm hearing correctly we're
 
01:31:33.189 --> 01:31:33.199 align:start position:0%
establishing a management team that that
 
01:31:34.709 --> 01:31:34.719 align:start position:0%
is unclassified
 
01:31:34.719 --> 01:31:36.310 align:start position:0%
is unclassified
yes

01:31:36.310 --> 01:31:36.320 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:37.510 align:start position:0%
yes
for

01:31:37.510 --> 01:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:31:40.149 --> 01:31:40.159 align:start position:0%
the indefinite future of the hospital
 
01:31:43.430 --> 01:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
and that the vendor to whom refers
 
01:31:45.350 --> 01:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
basically an employment agency that will
 
01:31:46.950 --> 01:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
provide the staff
 
01:31:47.990 --> 01:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
would that be an appropriate
 
01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:49.510 align:start position:0%
would that be an appropriate
characterization

01:31:49.510 --> 01:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
characterization
 
01:31:51.750 --> 01:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
i don't think that that's a
 
01:31:53.750 --> 01:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
the right characterization the the
 
01:31:55.830 --> 01:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
vendor certainly will be doing daily
 
01:31:58.310 --> 01:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
operating of the hospital as well they
 
01:31:59.590 --> 01:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
will just be doing it in conjunction
 
01:32:01.590 --> 01:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
with the management team so it's not
 
01:32:03.110 --> 01:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
like they're just providing a staff and
 
01:32:04.470 --> 01:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
these people will
 
01:32:06.550 --> 01:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
supervise all of them that it's it's not
 
01:32:08.709 --> 01:32:08.719 align:start position:0%
quite like that there would certainly be
 
01:32:10.870 --> 01:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
supervisors within the contracting you
 
01:32:12.709 --> 01:32:12.719 align:start position:0%
know within the contractor that's that's
 
01:32:14.550 --> 01:32:14.560 align:start position:0%
managing the hospital as well it's just
 
01:32:20.390 --> 01:32:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:22.870 --> 01:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
okay are there any other questions yeah
 
01:32:25.830 --> 01:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
may i just yes can you can you give i
 
01:32:28.149 --> 01:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
mean this i have to say this seems like
 
01:32:30.149 --> 01:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
a really
 
01:32:32.870 --> 01:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
strange for lack of a better term way to
 
01:32:35.110 --> 01:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
operate this in the sense that i i mean
 
01:32:38.390 --> 01:32:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:42.950 --> 01:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
real potential for conflict between
 
01:32:46.390 --> 01:32:46.400 align:start position:0%
these the these sort of chiefs
 
01:32:47.910 --> 01:32:47.920 align:start position:0%
you know very high level people that
 
01:32:49.910 --> 01:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
you're proposing to hire that are
 
01:32:52.550 --> 01:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
employees of the state and then
 
01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:53.830 align:start position:0%
employees of the state and then
this

01:32:53.830 --> 01:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:32:55.830 --> 01:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
this um
 
01:32:58.070 --> 01:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
the rest of the universe of employees
 
01:33:01.669 --> 01:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
being under subject to a contract
 
01:33:03.030 --> 01:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
that there would be
 
01:33:05.669 --> 01:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
great potential for con for conflicts
 
01:33:05.679 --> 01:33:06.950 align:start position:0%
great potential for con for conflicts
between

01:33:06.950 --> 01:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:33:09.189 --> 01:33:09.199 align:start position:0%
the state employee directors and the
 
01:33:10.950 --> 01:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
people that are under contract and i'm
 
01:33:13.430 --> 01:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could just give us
 
01:33:15.030 --> 01:33:15.040 align:start position:0%
can you give us some exam it's and it
 
01:33:16.390 --> 01:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
sounds like from what you said earlier
 
01:33:18.629 --> 01:33:18.639 align:start position:0%
that the state hospital really is a
 
01:33:18.639 --> 01:33:19.750 align:start position:0%
that the state hospital really is a
different

01:33:19.750 --> 01:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:33:22.149 --> 01:33:22.159 align:start position:0%
you know you may have a few contract the
 
01:33:24.229 --> 01:33:24.239 align:start position:0%
contract with dartmouth et cetera but
 
01:33:26.709 --> 01:33:26.719 align:start position:0%
most of the employee the the lower level
 
01:33:29.030 --> 01:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
employees there are state employees so
 
01:33:30.790 --> 01:33:30.800 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if you could give us an
 
01:33:32.310 --> 01:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
example of
 
01:33:34.790 --> 01:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
other places in
 
01:33:36.470 --> 01:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
state government
 
01:33:38.550 --> 01:33:38.560 align:start position:0%
that are operated like this where
 
01:33:39.830 --> 01:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
01:33:41.270 --> 01:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
you know uh
 
01:33:43.669 --> 01:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
the the top people are sort of state
 
01:33:46.070 --> 01:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
employees and then they but everybody
 
01:33:48.830 --> 01:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
else is kind of
 
01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:50.709 align:start position:0%
else is kind of
uh

01:33:50.709 --> 01:33:50.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:33:53.110 --> 01:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
independent contractors are subject to
 
01:33:53.120 --> 01:33:54.790 align:start position:0%
independent contractors are subject to
uh

01:33:54.790 --> 01:33:54.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:33:56.550 --> 01:33:56.560 align:start position:0%
a contract
 
01:33:59.030 --> 01:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to back up and i'll answer
 
01:34:01.110 --> 01:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
your question along the way to give you
 
01:34:03.189 --> 01:34:03.199 align:start position:0%
some perspective on why we're
 
01:34:05.189 --> 01:34:05.199 align:start position:0%
structuring it this way
 
01:34:07.030 --> 01:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
the state hospital has very new
 
01:34:08.390 --> 01:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital has very much a
 
01:34:10.790 --> 01:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
blended management team we have
 
01:34:12.550 --> 01:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
many senior executives but like the
 
01:34:14.390 --> 01:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
chief medical officer the chief quality
 
01:34:16.870 --> 01:34:16.880 align:start position:0%
officer both are dartmouth employees
 
01:34:19.510 --> 01:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
along with multiple others and we blend
 
01:34:22.870 --> 01:34:22.880 align:start position:0%
those two leadership teams together to
 
01:34:25.590 --> 01:34:25.600 align:start position:0%
to provide operational excellence at new
 
01:34:27.030 --> 01:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital
 
01:34:29.189 --> 01:34:29.199 align:start position:0%
the the reason for having a leadership
 
01:34:31.110 --> 01:34:31.120 align:start position:0%
team at hampstead hospital is because
 
01:34:33.030 --> 01:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
there is a need to have
 
01:34:34.950 --> 01:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
accountability to more than just that
 
01:34:36.550 --> 01:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
physical hospital
 
01:34:38.629 --> 01:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
that hospital is one part of a
 
01:34:41.430 --> 01:34:41.440 align:start position:0%
children's system of care so the kids
 
01:34:43.189 --> 01:34:43.199 align:start position:0%
sitting in emergency rooms the kids
 
01:34:45.510 --> 01:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
waiting for residential placement all of
 
01:34:47.270 --> 01:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
the kids that are within the children's
 
01:34:50.149 --> 01:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
system of care is linked to the state's
 
01:34:51.750 --> 01:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
children's system of care which is why
 
01:34:54.149 --> 01:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
we want state employees leading that
 
01:34:56.470 --> 01:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
hospital so that the strategy is not
 
01:34:59.990 --> 01:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
just about operating that 70 or 80 beds
 
01:35:02.390 --> 01:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
the strategy of that hospital is how it
 
01:35:04.790 --> 01:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
impacts the entire children's system of
 
01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:05.830 align:start position:0%
impacts the entire children's system of
care

01:35:05.830 --> 01:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
care
 
01:35:10.149 --> 01:35:10.159 align:start position:0%
so the ceo the ceo the cfo
 
01:35:11.990 --> 01:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
those are strategy positions the
 
01:35:15.030 --> 01:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
day-to-day operations the third party
 
01:35:17.030 --> 01:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
the third party contractor will have a
 
01:35:20.070 --> 01:35:20.080 align:start position:0%
hospital administrator there who links
 
01:35:22.709 --> 01:35:22.719 align:start position:0%
and blends with this leadership team but
 
01:35:25.189 --> 01:35:25.199 align:start position:0%
the leadership team is a strategy team
 
01:35:27.750 --> 01:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
the ceo the ceo that's the role that
 
01:35:30.070 --> 01:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
they play in any hospital management
 
01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:31.109 align:start position:0%
they play in any hospital management
team

01:35:31.109 --> 01:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
team
 
01:35:34.550 --> 01:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
their strategy is to create a a campus
 
01:35:36.950 --> 01:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
of excellence a center of excellence to
 
01:35:39.109 --> 01:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
link with the entire system of care for
 
01:35:41.350 --> 01:35:41.360 align:start position:0%
children's behavioral health
 
01:35:44.470 --> 01:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to try this for two years if
 
01:35:47.350 --> 01:35:47.360 align:start position:0%
if we in the next two years find that
 
01:35:49.030 --> 01:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
there are certain positions that should
 
01:35:50.790 --> 01:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
be contracted and not state employees
 
01:35:53.750 --> 01:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
then we will do the rfp that way
 
01:35:56.310 --> 01:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
what we do know is the finance team will
 
01:35:58.470 --> 01:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
never be contracted there is no private
 
01:36:00.790 --> 01:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
entity in this state or nationally that
 
01:36:03.590 --> 01:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
could figure out state financing uh it
 
01:36:05.910 --> 01:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
has it has to be as state employees
 
01:36:08.629 --> 01:36:08.639 align:start position:0%
right so when you pull the finance part
 
01:36:11.750 --> 01:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
out you have the ceo the ceo compliance
 
01:36:13.830 --> 01:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
officer because
 
01:36:15.510 --> 01:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
it's a state-owned building and we need
 
01:36:17.270 --> 01:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
to maintain joint commission compliance
 
01:36:19.350 --> 01:36:19.360 align:start position:0%
in order to continue to bill
 
01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
general counsel again with same with
 
01:36:23.830 --> 01:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
finance the legal system within state
 
01:36:27.189 --> 01:36:27.199 align:start position:0%
government needs to be state employees
 
01:36:27.199 --> 01:36:28.390 align:start position:0%
government needs to be state employees
so

01:36:28.390 --> 01:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:36:31.750 --> 01:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
in any other contract we we also see
 
01:36:34.790 --> 01:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
this type of structure in some of our it
 
01:36:37.430 --> 01:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
departments when it comes to mmis and
 
01:36:40.229 --> 01:36:40.239 align:start position:0%
bridges where we have deloitte
 
01:36:42.790 --> 01:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
being a main contractor having a lot of
 
01:36:45.030 --> 01:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
the on frontline employees and then
 
01:36:46.950 --> 01:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
having state employees supplementing it
 
01:36:50.070 --> 01:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
we see that in other areas
 
01:36:53.270 --> 01:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
so it's not completely unheard of
 
01:36:57.590 --> 01:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:59.590 --> 01:36:59.600 align:start position:0%
representative rose sorry senator
 
01:37:02.950 --> 01:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
rosenwald thank you madam chair so
 
01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:03.990 align:start position:0%
rosenwald thank you madam chair so
um

01:37:03.990 --> 01:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:06.229 --> 01:37:06.239 align:start position:0%
i've been supportive of the state
 
01:37:09.430 --> 01:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
acquiring hampstead but my understanding
 
01:37:12.229 --> 01:37:12.239 align:start position:0%
i think like some other peoples was that
 
01:37:14.310 --> 01:37:14.320 align:start position:0%
after the very short term we were
 
01:37:17.350 --> 01:37:17.360 align:start position:0%
looking at hiring state employees like
 
01:37:18.470 --> 01:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
we do
 
01:37:21.430 --> 01:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
at new hampshire hospital and glencliff
 
01:37:24.149 --> 01:37:24.159 align:start position:0%
for example does this mean that
 
01:37:27.590 --> 01:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
the department might consider
 
01:37:27.600 --> 01:37:29.669 align:start position:0%
the department might consider
changing

01:37:29.669 --> 01:37:29.679 align:start position:0%
changing
 
01:37:32.149 --> 01:37:32.159 align:start position:0%
glencliff for example from a state
 
01:37:32.159 --> 01:37:34.790 align:start position:0%
glencliff for example from a state
employee-driven

01:37:34.790 --> 01:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
employee-driven
 
01:37:37.669 --> 01:37:37.679 align:start position:0%
workforce to outside vendors i'm just
 
01:37:39.189 --> 01:37:39.199 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure
 
01:37:41.109 --> 01:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
why the state
 
01:37:44.629 --> 01:37:44.639 align:start position:0%
would want to own it if we don't want to
 
01:37:47.270 --> 01:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
run it with our own people that we hire
 
01:37:50.229 --> 01:37:50.239 align:start position:0%
and train and because we can't we're
 
01:37:52.310 --> 01:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
we're not market rate with our wages so
 
01:37:54.149 --> 01:37:54.159 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons why commissioner
 
01:37:56.629 --> 01:37:56.639 align:start position:0%
erlinghousen is is here in front of you
 
01:37:59.270 --> 01:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
asking for recruiters is our wage scale
 
01:38:01.270 --> 01:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
does not allow us to
 
01:38:04.390 --> 01:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
to recruit people at the level of skill
 
01:38:06.390 --> 01:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
that we need and
 
01:38:08.229 --> 01:38:08.239 align:start position:0%
i mean that is why new hampshire
 
01:38:10.390 --> 01:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
hospital has a 38 vacancy rate for
 
01:38:12.629 --> 01:38:12.639 align:start position:0%
nurses right now it's why glencliff is
 
01:38:15.350 --> 01:38:15.360 align:start position:0%
running at about 80 out of 120 for
 
01:38:17.750 --> 01:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
census because we can't attract staff up
 
01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:18.550 align:start position:0%
census because we can't attract staff up
there

01:38:18.550 --> 01:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:38:20.550 --> 01:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
our wages are just not competitive a
 
01:38:22.950 --> 01:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
third party can
 
01:38:24.709 --> 01:38:24.719 align:start position:0%
pay wages that are competitive with the
 
01:38:27.270 --> 01:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
marketplace so it makes sense for
 
01:38:30.550 --> 01:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
hampstead going into a new contract that
 
01:38:33.830 --> 01:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
they absorb the direct care workers the
 
01:38:35.750 --> 01:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
nurses the social workers the mental
 
01:38:38.229 --> 01:38:38.239 align:start position:0%
health counselors under their contract
 
01:38:40.629 --> 01:38:40.639 align:start position:0%
so that they can pay a competitive wage
 
01:38:42.709 --> 01:38:42.719 align:start position:0%
do i think that the state at some point
 
01:38:42.719 --> 01:38:44.950 align:start position:0%
do i think that the state at some point
could

01:38:44.950 --> 01:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:38:47.109 --> 01:38:47.119 align:start position:0%
fix the wage scale to pay a competitive
 
01:38:49.830 --> 01:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
wage yes but i think that is a very long
 
01:38:51.510 --> 01:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
process i think that's going to take
 
01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:52.629 align:start position:0%
process i think that's going to take
years

01:38:52.629 --> 01:38:52.639 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:38:54.870 --> 01:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
and we are
 
01:38:56.390 --> 01:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
going to be running hampstead in the
 
01:38:58.790 --> 01:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
next three months
 
01:39:01.350 --> 01:39:01.360 align:start position:0%
follow up please follow up so on top of
 
01:39:04.550 --> 01:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
the competitive wages that the outside
 
01:39:07.430 --> 01:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
vendor has to pay they're presumably
 
01:39:09.189 --> 01:39:09.199 align:start position:0%
going to want to make some profit as
 
01:39:09.199 --> 01:39:10.950 align:start position:0%
going to want to make some profit as
well

01:39:10.950 --> 01:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:39:13.350 --> 01:39:13.360 align:start position:0%
should we not expect that
 
01:39:16.629 --> 01:39:16.639 align:start position:0%
that model is going to be more expensive
 
01:39:18.870 --> 01:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
down the road than
 
01:39:21.030 --> 01:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
having a state
 
01:39:23.750 --> 01:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
owned and operated
 
01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:25.350 align:start position:0%
owned and operated
facility

01:39:25.350 --> 01:39:25.360 align:start position:0%
facility
 
01:39:26.950 --> 01:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
the no
 
01:39:28.709 --> 01:39:28.719 align:start position:0%
i would i would say that if you look at
 
01:39:31.109 --> 01:39:31.119 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hospital and glencliff and
 
01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
you compare it to
 
01:39:35.590 --> 01:39:35.600 align:start position:0%
to comparative facilities new hampshire
 
01:39:37.669 --> 01:39:37.679 align:start position:0%
hospital to other hospitals glencliff to
 
01:39:39.510 --> 01:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
other nursing homes that they're
 
01:39:41.910 --> 01:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
probably some of the most expensive
 
01:39:43.990 --> 01:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
facilities to run
 
01:39:46.790 --> 01:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
because of the cost of state employee
 
01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:48.229 align:start position:0%
because of the cost of state employee
benefits

01:39:48.229 --> 01:39:48.239 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
01:39:50.310 --> 01:39:50.320 align:start position:0%
overall state run
 
01:39:52.070 --> 01:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
i would say that
 
01:39:54.550 --> 01:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
it costs more to run a state-run
 
01:39:56.629 --> 01:39:56.639 align:start position:0%
hospital or a state-run nursing home
 
01:39:58.709 --> 01:39:58.719 align:start position:0%
than a private nursing home or a private
 
01:39:58.719 --> 01:40:00.070 align:start position:0%
than a private nursing home or a private
hospital

01:40:00.070 --> 01:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
01:40:02.229 --> 01:40:02.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:40:04.390 --> 01:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
are there further questions uh
 
01:40:06.149 --> 01:40:06.159 align:start position:0%
representative leishman
 
01:40:08.870 --> 01:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
thanks madam chair and this
 
01:40:11.270 --> 01:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
this question is as a result of your
 
01:40:13.750 --> 01:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
response to senator rosenwald
 
01:40:16.149 --> 01:40:16.159 align:start position:0%
now you said there's a 33 percent
 
01:40:19.510 --> 01:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate at new hampshire hospital
 
01:40:20.950 --> 01:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
how is
 
01:40:23.030 --> 01:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
a contractor coming in that as
 
01:40:25.270 --> 01:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
representative roosevelt pointed out
 
01:40:27.270 --> 01:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
will need a profit
 
01:40:29.990 --> 01:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
how are they going to find a competitive
 
01:40:32.950 --> 01:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
or a good work force if they've got to
 
01:40:35.030 --> 01:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
provide a profit and provide
 
01:40:37.189 --> 01:40:37.199 align:start position:0%
such a rate or contract with you that's
 
01:40:40.149 --> 01:40:40.159 align:start position:0%
competitive they are hiring the current
 
01:40:42.470 --> 01:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
staff at hampstead and increasing their
 
01:40:44.950 --> 01:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
wages to be competitive so
 
01:40:47.590 --> 01:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
there's that um so the hampstead is
 
01:40:51.669 --> 01:40:51.679 align:start position:0%
staffed to run 45 45-bit hospital right
 
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
now so they will be offering employment
 
01:40:56.310 --> 01:40:56.320 align:start position:0%
to all of those staff so their current
 
01:40:58.550 --> 01:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
their current staff they also have
 
01:41:00.070 --> 01:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
national connections where they can
 
01:41:01.910 --> 01:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
recruit out of state and bring in state
 
01:41:04.390 --> 01:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
which is what we're wanting them to do
 
01:41:05.910 --> 01:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
we plan to
 
01:41:08.149 --> 01:41:08.159 align:start position:0%
increase the capacity at hampstead
 
01:41:10.629 --> 01:41:10.639 align:start position:0%
slowly but over the next two years to
 
01:41:13.510 --> 01:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
include a prtf to include other acute
 
01:41:15.910 --> 01:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
units they have a 12 bed
 
01:41:18.629 --> 01:41:18.639 align:start position:0%
adult unit now they have the remaining
 
01:41:20.870 --> 01:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
beds being children but they're also
 
01:41:23.030 --> 01:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
running an iop intensive outpatient
 
01:41:25.590 --> 01:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
program a partial program and other
 
01:41:28.470 --> 01:41:28.480 align:start position:0%
programs that we may or may not continue
 
01:41:30.550 --> 01:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
to run and then we would absorb those
 
01:41:33.030 --> 01:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
staff into the rest of the hospital beds
 
01:41:36.070 --> 01:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
we really need to get in and evaluate it
 
01:41:40.149 --> 01:41:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:43.030 --> 01:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
01:41:46.149 --> 01:41:46.159 align:start position:0%
i do have one
 
01:41:48.629 --> 01:41:48.639 align:start position:0%
i assume that currently hempstead
 
01:41:52.310 --> 01:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
hospital has all of these people
 
01:41:54.070 --> 01:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
okay yeah
 
01:41:55.910 --> 01:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't say all of them but several
 
01:41:57.990 --> 01:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
of them and several of them are
 
01:41:59.510 --> 01:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
candidates to come over to be state
 
01:42:01.350 --> 01:42:01.360 align:start position:0%
employees i mean they may not have a
 
01:42:05.109 --> 01:42:05.119 align:start position:0%
contract manager i i i guess no but
 
01:42:07.030 --> 01:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
several people on their leadership team
 
01:42:09.189 --> 01:42:09.199 align:start position:0%
has expressed interest in coming into
 
01:42:16.629 --> 01:42:16.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:18.550 --> 01:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:42:22.550 --> 01:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
01:42:25.830 --> 01:42:25.840 align:start position:0%
seeing none could i have a motion please
 
01:42:28.470 --> 01:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
madam chair i'll move to table
 
01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:30.550 align:start position:0%
madam chair i'll move to table
uh

01:42:30.550 --> 01:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:42:33.030 --> 01:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
representative leishman moves to table
 
01:42:37.590 --> 01:42:37.600 align:start position:0%

01:43:33.910 --> 01:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:43:36.229 --> 01:43:36.239 align:start position:0%
the vote to table fails
 
01:43:40.390 --> 01:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
uh on a two in favor and eight opposed
 
01:43:42.550 --> 01:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
senator morris yeah madam chair i'm
 
01:43:45.189 --> 01:43:45.199 align:start position:0%
gonna move the item but i'm also gonna
 
01:43:48.709 --> 01:43:48.719 align:start position:0%
uh caution everybody um we need to know
 
01:43:50.870 --> 01:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
more what's going on on that campus
 
01:43:53.270 --> 01:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
um i think we need to understand where
 
01:43:56.070 --> 01:43:56.080 align:start position:0%
we're headed here as a state
 
01:43:57.830 --> 01:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
i'll move the item because i think the
 
01:44:00.950 --> 01:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
operational side i understand already
 
01:44:04.470 --> 01:44:04.480 align:start position:0%
but i think before we go any further
 
01:44:06.229 --> 01:44:06.239 align:start position:0%
with where we're taking plans in the
 
01:44:08.310 --> 01:44:08.320 align:start position:0%
state i think the fiscal needs to
 
01:44:10.470 --> 01:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
understand that and especially if this
 
01:44:12.870 --> 01:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
is going to be decisions made
 
01:44:15.270 --> 01:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
when we get out of here in may
 
01:44:16.470 --> 01:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
i think we
 
01:44:18.709 --> 01:44:18.719 align:start position:0%
need to set some kind of system up where
 
01:44:22.550 --> 01:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal's being briefed on it so
 
01:44:25.030 --> 01:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
i moved the item every second but can i
 
01:44:27.830 --> 01:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
may i also make a comment just
 
01:44:29.830 --> 01:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
of course sort of follow up on what
 
01:44:31.990 --> 01:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
senator moore said i i guess i i you
 
01:44:34.470 --> 01:44:34.480 align:start position:0%
know the one thing that leads me
 
01:44:36.229 --> 01:44:36.239 align:start position:0%
led me to vote not to table was your
 
01:44:38.149 --> 01:44:38.159 align:start position:0%
statement that we're going to sort of
 
01:44:40.070 --> 01:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
see how this goes for a couple of years
 
01:44:42.229 --> 01:44:42.239 align:start position:0%
and if we have to make some changes
 
01:44:44.629 --> 01:44:44.639 align:start position:0%
um that i i
 
01:44:46.870 --> 01:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
i think that's very important that that
 
01:44:49.830 --> 01:44:49.840 align:start position:0%
happened and i i guess i'm you know i'm
 
01:44:51.430 --> 01:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm sort of
 
01:44:53.430 --> 01:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
inclined to defer to what you say you
 
01:44:55.750 --> 01:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
are sort of the experts in this area i'm
 
01:44:58.229 --> 01:44:58.239 align:start position:0%
sort of inclined to defer but
 
01:45:00.550 --> 01:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
i i'm not sure candidly that i've gotten
 
01:45:03.189 --> 01:45:03.199 align:start position:0%
a really satisfactory explanation for
 
01:45:03.199 --> 01:45:04.709 align:start position:0%
a really satisfactory explanation for
why

01:45:04.709 --> 01:45:04.719 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:45:07.910 --> 01:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be appropriate to just have
 
01:45:11.030 --> 01:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
you know one contract administrator
 
01:45:13.750 --> 01:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
for this for this operation
 
01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:14.629 align:start position:0%
for this for this operation
and

01:45:14.629 --> 01:45:14.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:45:18.790 --> 01:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
everyone else be uh subject to to the
 
01:45:20.629 --> 01:45:20.639 align:start position:0%
a contract administrator that's a state
 
01:45:23.109 --> 01:45:23.119 align:start position:0%
employee and everyone else be subject to
 
01:45:24.790 --> 01:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
the contract and presume you know you
 
01:45:26.790 --> 01:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
say you want to make sure that people
 
01:45:28.709 --> 01:45:28.719 align:start position:0%
are all sort of on board following the
 
01:45:30.950 --> 01:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
state's plan and all of that makes
 
01:45:32.790 --> 01:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
perfect sense to me but
 
01:45:34.149 --> 01:45:34.159 align:start position:0%
why can't
 
01:45:37.030 --> 01:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
a why couldn't a contract administrator
 
01:45:38.550 --> 01:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
ensure that
 
01:45:40.310 --> 01:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
all the people that are working under
 
01:45:42.149 --> 01:45:42.159 align:start position:0%
the contract are on
 
01:45:44.550 --> 01:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
are you know on the on the same page so
 
01:45:46.629 --> 01:45:46.639 align:start position:0%
to speak so as i say maybe maybe there
 
01:45:48.709 --> 01:45:48.719 align:start position:0%
are reasons why it makes more sense to
 
01:45:52.470 --> 01:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
do this i'm willing to defer but i'm i i
 
01:45:53.910 --> 01:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
sort of share the same concerns that
 
01:45:55.350 --> 01:45:55.360 align:start position:0%
senator moore says
 
01:45:57.430 --> 01:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:46:01.990 --> 01:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:03.990 --> 01:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
okay senator gaiden thank you madam
 
01:46:06.229 --> 01:46:06.239 align:start position:0%
chair i would i would echo um
 
01:46:08.149 --> 01:46:08.159 align:start position:0%
representative lin's comments
 
01:46:10.310 --> 01:46:10.320 align:start position:0%
uh i've had some experience with federal
 
01:46:12.790 --> 01:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
contracts multi-billion dollar contracts
 
01:46:14.950 --> 01:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
under the auspices of a single contract
 
01:46:17.990 --> 01:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
administrator with very very clearly
 
01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:19.030 align:start position:0%
administrator with very very clearly
defined

01:46:19.030 --> 01:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
defined
 
01:46:21.270 --> 01:46:21.280 align:start position:0%
and omnipotent authority to challenge
 
01:46:23.830 --> 01:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
any deficiencies or potential defects in
 
01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:25.030 align:start position:0%
any deficiencies or potential defects in
performance

01:46:25.030 --> 01:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
performance
 
01:46:26.550 --> 01:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
and so rather than establishing an
 
01:46:28.149 --> 01:46:28.159 align:start position:0%
entire staff i'd like to look towards a
 
01:46:30.310 --> 01:46:30.320 align:start position:0%
contract administrator model
 
01:46:31.990 --> 01:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
and and given credence of course your
 
01:46:33.189 --> 01:46:33.199 align:start position:0%
comments that we have three months to
 
01:46:37.990 --> 01:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:39.830 --> 01:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
representative emerick thank you madam
 
01:46:39.840 --> 01:46:40.629 align:start position:0%
representative emerick thank you madam
chair

01:46:40.629 --> 01:46:40.639 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:46:42.149 --> 01:46:42.159 align:start position:0%
one of the things that's come out of
 
01:46:44.229 --> 01:46:44.239 align:start position:0%
several different dialogues we've had
 
01:46:46.149 --> 01:46:46.159 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
01:46:47.669 --> 01:46:47.679 align:start position:0%
indicates that we're
 
01:46:47.679 --> 01:46:49.109 align:start position:0%
indicates that we're
understaffed

01:46:49.109 --> 01:46:49.119 align:start position:0%
understaffed
 
01:46:51.910 --> 01:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
and i think we we don't really have an
 
01:46:54.470 --> 01:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity loss or an opportunity costs
 
01:46:56.790 --> 01:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
associated with vacancies you
 
01:46:58.390 --> 01:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
highlighted that in the new hampshire
 
01:47:00.310 --> 01:47:00.320 align:start position:0%
hospital you can only have so many beds
 
01:47:02.550 --> 01:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
because you just can't staff it so what
 
01:47:04.390 --> 01:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
that's saying is we are not we're not
 
01:47:07.030 --> 01:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
fulfilling our mission as a state
 
01:47:08.950 --> 01:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
because we can't kiss and i'm not i'm
 
01:47:10.149 --> 01:47:10.159 align:start position:0%
not looking at you and saying you're
 
01:47:11.510 --> 01:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
doing a bad job i'm saying you've
 
01:47:14.390 --> 01:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
highlighted a reality that if we don't
 
01:47:17.270 --> 01:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
do something about staffing we are going
 
01:47:19.910 --> 01:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
to be deficient as a state fulfilling
 
01:47:22.870 --> 01:47:22.880 align:start position:0%
our mission to our citizens so i'm i'm
 
01:47:24.070 --> 01:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
just throwing that out there as a
 
01:47:25.750 --> 01:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
rhetorical comment not directed
 
01:47:27.510 --> 01:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily at you but just that all of
 
01:47:30.709 --> 01:47:30.719 align:start position:0%
the vacancies that we're talking about
 
01:47:32.709 --> 01:47:32.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for that comment and and i'd
 
01:47:34.310 --> 01:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
like to point out that
 
01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:35.189 align:start position:0%
like to point out that
every

01:47:35.189 --> 01:47:35.199 align:start position:0%
every
 
01:47:37.109 --> 01:47:37.119 align:start position:0%
every program that the department
 
01:47:40.070 --> 01:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
oversees whether it's state employee run
 
01:47:41.669 --> 01:47:41.679 align:start position:0%
or not
 
01:47:43.910 --> 01:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
is having workforce issues so every
 
01:47:46.070 --> 01:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
program we want to put forward we can we
 
01:47:48.550 --> 01:47:48.560 align:start position:0%
can have the best ideas on how to solve
 
01:47:50.870 --> 01:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
the substance use disorder crisis the
 
01:47:53.189 --> 01:47:53.199 align:start position:0%
mental health crisis but if our partners
 
01:47:56.070 --> 01:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
in the community also cannot hire people
 
01:47:56.080 --> 01:47:57.669 align:start position:0%
in the community also cannot hire people
then

01:47:57.669 --> 01:47:57.679 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:47:59.830 --> 01:47:59.840 align:start position:0%
it sets us up for failure
 
01:48:03.109 --> 01:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
so it really is a workforce issue across
 
01:48:06.070 --> 01:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
the state and in some areas it is the
 
01:48:07.990 --> 01:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
type of work we do when it when it's
 
01:48:10.070 --> 01:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
mental health and substance use or the
 
01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:10.950 align:start position:0%
mental health and substance use or the
um

01:48:10.950 --> 01:48:10.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:13.109 --> 01:48:13.119 align:start position:0%
the high clinical licensure required and
 
01:48:15.030 --> 01:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
in some cases it's it for the state
 
01:48:17.350 --> 01:48:17.360 align:start position:0%
employees it's it's things like wages so
 
01:48:19.350 --> 01:48:19.360 align:start position:0%
i think every employer has different
 
01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:32.310 align:start position:0%
i think every employer has different
challenges

01:48:32.310 --> 01:48:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:33.750 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:48:33.750 --> 01:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:48:36.229 --> 01:48:36.239 align:start position:0%
commissioner the um you mentioned you're
 
01:48:38.790 --> 01:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
going to be in three months operating
 
01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:39.750 align:start position:0%
going to be in three months operating
which

01:48:39.750 --> 01:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:40.470 align:start position:0%
which
i

01:48:40.470 --> 01:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:48:42.950 --> 01:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
that's good news so that means that your
 
01:48:44.550 --> 01:48:44.560 align:start position:0%
deal is going to be signed
 
01:48:44.560 --> 01:48:46.149 align:start position:0%
deal is going to be signed
um

01:48:46.149 --> 01:48:46.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:48.709 --> 01:48:48.719 align:start position:0%
at that point will you have
 
01:48:51.189 --> 01:48:51.199 align:start position:0%
the ability to talk to us about
 
01:48:53.669 --> 01:48:53.679 align:start position:0%
this concept that you're working on
 
01:48:56.870 --> 01:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
yes so we're expecting our close date
 
01:48:59.270 --> 01:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
for hampstead hospital to be april may
 
01:49:01.430 --> 01:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
and then a third party to come in right
 
01:49:04.149 --> 01:49:04.159 align:start position:0%
after that along with this team to to
 
01:49:05.990 --> 01:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
operate the hospital for the next two
 
01:49:10.229 --> 01:49:10.239 align:start position:0%
years this summer we will enter into
 
01:49:13.350 --> 01:49:13.360 align:start position:0%
drafting an rfp for a long term how the
 
01:49:15.910 --> 01:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
hospital would be would be run we will
 
01:49:18.550 --> 01:49:18.560 align:start position:0%
take what we learn from from the next
 
01:49:20.629 --> 01:49:20.639 align:start position:0%
year or so of operations and incorporate
 
01:49:23.669 --> 01:49:23.679 align:start position:0%
that into the rfp for going forward but
 
01:49:26.550 --> 01:49:26.560 align:start position:0%
right now it's it's the short term right
 
01:49:29.109 --> 01:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
we don't we don't have the luxury of
 
01:49:32.149 --> 01:49:32.159 align:start position:0%
time to really um sit down and make a
 
01:49:32.159 --> 01:49:33.109 align:start position:0%
time to really um sit down and make a
decision

01:49:33.109 --> 01:49:33.119 align:start position:0%
decision
 
01:49:34.709 --> 01:49:34.719 align:start position:0%
who's the contract administrator would
 
01:49:36.950 --> 01:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
be a great example because the decisions
 
01:49:38.950 --> 01:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
made in a hospital are very clinical
 
01:49:40.310 --> 01:49:40.320 align:start position:0%
decisions so does our contract
 
01:49:42.149 --> 01:49:42.159 align:start position:0%
administrator need to be a doctor a
 
01:49:44.070 --> 01:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist a nurse
 
01:49:46.310 --> 01:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
a business person all of those things
 
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
need to be fettered out over the next
 
01:49:49.910 --> 01:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
several months and then we'll be in the
 
01:49:52.550 --> 01:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
rfp once we're running the hospital when
 
01:49:54.870 --> 01:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
we talk about what it what's our plan
 
01:49:54.880 --> 01:49:55.589 align:start position:0%
we talk about what it what's our plan
for

01:49:55.589 --> 01:49:55.599 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:49:58.470 --> 01:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
the the the campus of excellence or the
 
01:49:59.910 --> 01:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
center of excellence what else is going
 
01:50:02.390 --> 01:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
to happen at hampstead hospital as we
 
01:50:04.550 --> 01:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
build out the beds i think there is the
 
01:50:06.470 --> 01:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have a larger discussion
 
01:50:08.870 --> 01:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
about that um spring into summer for
 
01:50:11.109 --> 01:50:11.119 align:start position:0%
sure which is where i think the
 
01:50:14.070 --> 01:50:14.080 align:start position:0%
legislature needs to weigh in
 
01:50:16.629 --> 01:50:16.639 align:start position:0%
because we're talking about a campus and
 
01:50:18.470 --> 01:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
those ideas i don't think have been
 
01:50:21.270 --> 01:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
vetted with the legislature right now
 
01:50:23.910 --> 01:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
i think it would be beneficial in may
 
01:50:25.750 --> 01:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
because we'll be leaving right after
 
01:50:28.470 --> 01:50:28.480 align:start position:0%
that to come back and have a larger
 
01:50:28.480 --> 01:50:29.669 align:start position:0%
that to come back and have a larger
discussion

01:50:29.669 --> 01:50:29.679 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:50:32.310 --> 01:50:32.320 align:start position:0%
about this um you'll certainly be on the
 
01:50:34.470 --> 01:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
operational phase by that and and i
 
01:50:36.149 --> 01:50:36.159 align:start position:0%
think one point
 
01:50:37.270 --> 01:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
and this is
 
01:50:39.589 --> 01:50:39.599 align:start position:0%
in your favor that i think
 
01:50:41.669 --> 01:50:41.679 align:start position:0%
overall what we've been trying to do and
 
01:50:43.510 --> 01:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
i gave it a plug a little while ago but
 
01:50:45.030 --> 01:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
i'll give it again
 
01:50:47.830 --> 01:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
we we are going to a company that can
 
01:50:50.229 --> 01:50:50.239 align:start position:0%
bring employees into new hampshire when
 
01:50:52.709 --> 01:50:52.719 align:start position:0%
we looked at epping we were going to an
 
01:50:54.870 --> 01:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
employee they could bring people into
 
01:50:56.790 --> 01:50:56.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire we're not going to solve
 
01:50:58.870 --> 01:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
this unless we get creative like that
 
01:51:01.430 --> 01:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
and i think that's an important part of
 
01:51:03.430 --> 01:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
this i think it's a little surprise on
 
01:51:05.990 --> 01:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
the management side but
 
01:51:07.510 --> 01:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
that's why maybe if you get in there in
 
01:51:09.830 --> 01:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
may we can go through all this
 
01:51:11.669 --> 01:51:11.679 align:start position:0%
yeah i think i think we've made the
 
01:51:14.070 --> 01:51:14.080 align:start position:0%
determination you know at the department
 
01:51:16.390 --> 01:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
that solving several of the issues
 
01:51:18.229 --> 01:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
workforce included mental health
 
01:51:20.709 --> 01:51:20.719 align:start position:0%
substance abuse is going to take public
 
01:51:22.709 --> 01:51:22.719 align:start position:0%
private partnerships and that's what
 
01:51:24.950 --> 01:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
this is that's what the epping project
 
01:51:26.870 --> 01:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
is it's really that public private so
 
01:51:26.880 --> 01:51:27.990 align:start position:0%
is it's really that public private so
that

01:51:27.990 --> 01:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:51:31.270 --> 01:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
we have leverage on how our system our
 
01:51:33.910 --> 01:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
overall system operates and how that one
 
01:51:36.950 --> 01:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
piece fits into our system but on on the
 
01:51:39.189 --> 01:51:39.199 align:start position:0%
private side they get to pay the wages
 
01:51:41.350 --> 01:51:41.360 align:start position:0%
and have more operational efficiency
 
01:51:44.550 --> 01:51:44.560 align:start position:0%
than a state-run facility
 
01:51:47.350 --> 01:51:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:50.790 --> 01:51:50.800 align:start position:0%
are there any further comments yes
 
01:51:52.550 --> 01:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
representative leishman thanks madam
 
01:51:54.629 --> 01:51:54.639 align:start position:0%
chair and i see senator moore staring at
 
01:51:57.350 --> 01:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
me so i'll keep it short
 
01:51:57.360 --> 01:51:59.510 align:start position:0%
me so i'll keep it short
um

01:51:59.510 --> 01:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:01.430 --> 01:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
so i'm concerned like senator morris
 
01:52:03.350 --> 01:52:03.360 align:start position:0%
about the cost and the long-term
 
01:52:05.830 --> 01:52:05.840 align:start position:0%
implication on the state you know arpa
 
01:52:09.109 --> 01:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
funds were using 1.7 million dollars for
 
01:52:11.830 --> 01:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
these six positions out of the 15
 
01:52:15.030 --> 01:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
million that we took back in october
 
01:52:17.030 --> 01:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
this money is going to run out and this
 
01:52:18.950 --> 01:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
is going to be a state responsibility
 
01:52:21.109 --> 01:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
and i'm very concerned
 
01:52:24.709 --> 01:52:24.719 align:start position:0%
that we have absolutely no idea of the
 
01:52:27.189 --> 01:52:27.199 align:start position:0%
cost and the amount of people necessary
 
01:52:29.669 --> 01:52:29.679 align:start position:0%
to run this position and i will support
 
01:52:33.669 --> 01:52:33.679 align:start position:0%
senator morris's motion but i'm like
 
01:52:36.070 --> 01:52:36.080 align:start position:0%
others very concerned we have not seen
 
01:52:38.629 --> 01:52:38.639 align:start position:0%
the information i think we need to see
 
01:52:40.149 --> 01:52:40.159 align:start position:0%
moving forward
 
01:52:40.159 --> 01:52:41.189 align:start position:0%
moving forward
thanks

01:52:41.189 --> 01:52:41.199 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
01:52:44.149 --> 01:52:44.159 align:start position:0%
madam chair uh yes senator mars yeah and
 
01:52:46.149 --> 01:52:46.159 align:start position:0%
i'm well aware of what we left on the
 
01:52:49.030 --> 01:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
balance on the 15 million so i thought
 
01:52:51.510 --> 01:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
about that before i looked at this
 
01:52:51.520 --> 01:52:53.030 align:start position:0%
about that before i looked at this
but

01:52:53.030 --> 01:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:52:55.189 --> 01:52:55.199 align:start position:0%
i think the reality is if you look at
 
01:52:57.109 --> 01:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
hampstead hospital and this is why we
 
01:52:59.030 --> 01:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
should talk about this in may
 
01:53:00.790 --> 01:53:00.800 align:start position:0%
they're not just serving new hampshire
 
01:53:02.550 --> 01:53:02.560 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:53:05.109 --> 01:53:05.119 align:start position:0%
they have clients outside of our state
 
01:53:05.119 --> 01:53:06.070 align:start position:0%
they have clients outside of our state
um

01:53:06.070 --> 01:53:06.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:07.990 --> 01:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
and they're billing
 
01:53:10.629 --> 01:53:10.639 align:start position:0%
so you're creating a system here and i
 
01:53:12.149 --> 01:53:12.159 align:start position:0%
guess that's what i want to see what the
 
01:53:14.790 --> 01:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
intent is if that's
 
01:53:17.750 --> 01:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
a for-profit setup
 
01:53:19.510 --> 01:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
manage the state's managing the
 
01:53:22.310 --> 01:53:22.320 align:start position:0%
for-profit business
 
01:53:24.709 --> 01:53:24.719 align:start position:0%
there's a lot to look at there i mean
 
01:53:26.390 --> 01:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
you know what are we currently writing
 
01:53:28.390 --> 01:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
to hampstead hospital as a state did we
 
01:53:31.589 --> 01:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
fund them at all you know um and then
 
01:53:33.910 --> 01:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
what's the income going to be on if you
 
01:53:36.790 --> 01:53:36.800 align:start position:0%
take it from 50 beds and turn it into 75
 
01:53:37.830 --> 01:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:53:40.390 --> 01:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
other services you know so i think
 
01:53:42.390 --> 01:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
there's a lot to look at in that whole
 
01:53:45.030 --> 01:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
concept thing um it could all be very
 
01:53:48.149 --> 01:53:48.159 align:start position:0%
good to be honest with you um but i also
 
01:53:49.669 --> 01:53:49.679 align:start position:0%
want to understand what else is going to
 
01:53:53.109 --> 01:53:53.119 align:start position:0%
happen so thank you
 
01:53:55.030 --> 01:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
are there any further comments i would
 
01:53:58.070 --> 01:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
just comment on sender's uh
 
01:53:59.830 --> 01:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
statement because i think
 
01:54:02.470 --> 01:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
it's looking like a business enterprise
 
01:54:04.390 --> 01:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
like the liquor commission
 
01:54:06.070 --> 01:54:06.080 align:start position:0%
to some extent
 
01:54:06.870 --> 01:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:54:08.870 --> 01:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm not trying to
 
01:54:10.470 --> 01:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
equate the two i'm just saying as a
 
01:54:12.470 --> 01:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
business enterprise it may be a better
 
01:54:14.870 --> 01:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
structure than trying to take the state
 
01:54:17.270 --> 01:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
structure and the contract structure and
 
01:54:19.589 --> 01:54:19.599 align:start position:0%
work it together just say okay
 
01:54:21.830 --> 01:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
it's it does its own thing so to speak
 
01:54:23.990 --> 01:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
and makes its own profit
 
01:54:27.510 --> 01:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:30.070 --> 01:54:30.080 align:start position:0%
senator d'alessandro thank you
 
01:54:33.109 --> 01:54:33.119 align:start position:0%
i i think it provides an opportunity for
 
01:54:34.390 --> 01:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:54:37.109 --> 01:54:37.119 align:start position:0%
i think it provides an opportunity
 
01:54:39.910 --> 01:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
and it's it's uh look at i we did this
 
01:54:42.790 --> 01:54:42.800 align:start position:0%
once before when we de-institutionalized
 
01:54:46.070 --> 01:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
it created an opportunity it was okay we
 
01:54:47.910 --> 01:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
started and then we led up on it and
 
01:54:49.270 --> 01:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
didn't didn't
 
01:54:52.149 --> 01:54:52.159 align:start position:0%
fill fulfill our obligations
 
01:54:54.470 --> 01:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
this is an opportunity we currently have
 
01:54:57.030 --> 01:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
a contract with with hampstead hospital
 
01:54:58.550 --> 01:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
what how many how many beds have we
 
01:55:00.310 --> 01:55:00.320 align:start position:0%
contracted for now
 
01:55:01.830 --> 01:55:01.840 align:start position:0%
um we don't have a certain number of
 
01:55:03.830 --> 01:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
beds but we're contracted to provide all

01:57:08.470 --> 01:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
yes uh rep senator rosenwald thank you
 
01:57:13.830 --> 01:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
madam chair i noticed this is a 16-week
 
01:57:15.990 --> 01:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
wage enhancement do you expect to be
 
01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:17.189 align:start position:0%
wage enhancement do you expect to be
back

01:57:17.189 --> 01:57:17.199 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:57:20.390 --> 01:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
after that to request more funding for
 
01:57:22.790 --> 01:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
this program
 
01:57:23.990 --> 01:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
good morning for the record my name is
 
01:57:25.350 --> 01:57:25.360 align:start position:0%
joe christie i'm the cfo for new
 
01:57:27.510 --> 01:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital and glenn cliff
 
01:57:31.030 --> 01:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
we made it a 16-week program um
 
01:57:32.790 --> 01:57:32.800 align:start position:0%
i guess by way of background so in the
 
01:57:32.800 --> 01:57:33.750 align:start position:0%
i guess by way of background so in the
fall

01:57:33.750 --> 01:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
fall
 
01:57:35.910 --> 01:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
most nursing homes received a portion of
 
01:57:38.629 --> 01:57:38.639 align:start position:0%
funding arpa funding and a lot of them
 
01:57:40.950 --> 01:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
have used that for similar kind of wage
 
01:57:43.830 --> 01:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
enhancement programs glencliff was not a
 
01:57:45.669 --> 01:57:45.679 align:start position:0%
part of that at that time but we did
 
01:57:47.990 --> 01:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
approach gopher to request the
 
01:57:50.310 --> 01:57:50.320 align:start position:0%
additional funding
 
01:57:53.589 --> 01:57:53.599 align:start position:0%
and so what we were uh
 
01:57:55.830 --> 01:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
provided or assuming it passes today
 
01:57:58.950 --> 01:57:58.960 align:start position:0%
what we will be provided uh is the uh
 
01:58:02.310 --> 01:58:02.320 align:start position:0%
dollar amount that was uh equal per
 
01:58:04.390 --> 01:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
i believe it was bed as any other
 
01:58:07.350 --> 01:58:07.360 align:start position:0%
nursing home facility in the state
 
01:58:10.070 --> 01:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
so to try to structure
 
01:58:11.750 --> 01:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
knowing that we have kind of that finite
 
01:58:13.589 --> 01:58:13.599 align:start position:0%
amount of money to try to structure
 
01:58:14.950 --> 01:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
something that was meaningful to our
 
01:58:17.589 --> 01:58:17.599 align:start position:0%
lnas to try to stabilize our staffing
 
01:58:17.599 --> 01:58:18.470 align:start position:0%
lnas to try to stabilize our staffing
we

01:58:18.470 --> 01:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:58:21.189 --> 01:58:21.199 align:start position:0%
identified a 16-week program would allow
 
01:58:22.950 --> 01:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
us to pay a rate
 
01:58:24.790 --> 01:58:24.800 align:start position:0%
that that would be meaningful for those
 
01:58:27.430 --> 01:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
individuals so that's kind of how we
 
01:58:30.629 --> 01:58:30.639 align:start position:0%
got to the 16-week time frame we are
 
01:58:32.629 --> 01:58:32.639 align:start position:0%
hopeful that that 16 weeks will carry us
 
01:58:34.870 --> 01:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
into the summer where covid
 
01:58:37.589 --> 01:58:37.599 align:start position:0%
we have seen eases up a little bit
 
01:58:39.270 --> 01:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
and we're hopeful that
 
01:58:40.709 --> 01:58:40.719 align:start position:0%
that helps with some of our staff
 
01:58:42.229 --> 01:58:42.239 align:start position:0%
satisfaction and
 
01:58:44.229 --> 01:58:44.239 align:start position:0%
kind of workload that they're carrying
 
01:58:44.239 --> 01:58:47.270 align:start position:0%
kind of workload that they're carrying
today

01:58:47.270 --> 01:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:49.270 --> 01:58:49.280 align:start position:0%
are there further questions senator
 
01:58:51.189 --> 01:58:51.199 align:start position:0%
guida thank you madam chair can you
 
01:58:53.350 --> 01:58:53.360 align:start position:0%
comment on the census at glencliff as
 
01:58:56.229 --> 01:58:56.239 align:start position:0%
opposed to its full capacity
 
01:58:58.629 --> 01:58:58.639 align:start position:0%
thanks um we're we're running right
 
01:59:01.830 --> 01:59:01.840 align:start position:0%
around 80 right now between 75 and 80
 
01:59:04.149 --> 01:59:04.159 align:start position:0%
total capacity is 119
 
01:59:04.159 --> 01:59:05.109 align:start position:0%
total capacity is 119
so

01:59:05.109 --> 01:59:05.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:59:07.750 --> 01:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
running quite a bit below capacity for a
 
01:59:09.510 --> 01:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
variety of reasons
 
01:59:12.149 --> 01:59:12.159 align:start position:0%
we have leaned on our other nursing
 
01:59:14.950 --> 01:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
homes to take people with mental illness
 
01:59:16.870 --> 01:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
into their communities
 
01:59:19.350 --> 01:59:19.360 align:start position:0%
we don't believe that that the elderly
 
01:59:20.550 --> 01:59:20.560 align:start position:0%
that suffer
 
01:59:22.870 --> 01:59:22.880 align:start position:0%
mental illness need to go to war in new
 
01:59:24.470 --> 01:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire to get services we believe
 
01:59:25.990 --> 01:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
that they should be able to get services
 
01:59:28.149 --> 01:59:28.159 align:start position:0%
in any nursing home across the state
 
01:59:29.750 --> 01:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
so we have been working with nursing
 
01:59:31.830 --> 01:59:31.840 align:start position:0%
homes to open up additional behavioral
 
01:59:35.109 --> 01:59:35.119 align:start position:0%
health beds in local nursing homes
 
01:59:37.270 --> 01:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
in addition to that the staffing issue
 
01:59:40.390 --> 01:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
has created uh an issue for
 
01:59:42.629 --> 01:59:42.639 align:start position:0%
for maintaining it at full census so
 
01:59:44.790 --> 01:59:44.800 align:start position:0%
allowing so dropping it down to a point
 
01:59:46.790 --> 01:59:46.800 align:start position:0%
where we could close off a unit and
 
01:59:48.550 --> 01:59:48.560 align:start position:0%
reallocate the staff
 
01:59:53.430 --> 01:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:55.030 --> 01:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
further further questions let's follow
 
01:59:55.990 --> 01:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
up thank you
 
01:59:58.390 --> 01:59:58.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner so safe to say that the
 
02:00:01.030 --> 02:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
decreased census is due to the shortage
 
02:00:02.870 --> 02:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
of personnel
 
02:00:06.310 --> 02:00:06.320 align:start position:0%
primarily it is both it it is both the
 
02:00:09.189 --> 02:00:09.199 align:start position:0%
the shortage of personnel and it is um
 
02:00:11.430 --> 02:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
our attempts to move men uh people with
 
02:00:12.950 --> 02:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
mental illness that are seniors into the
 
02:00:12.960 --> 02:00:14.310 align:start position:0%
mental illness that are seniors into the
community

02:00:14.310 --> 02:00:14.320 align:start position:0%
community
 
02:00:16.229 --> 02:00:16.239 align:start position:0%
for sure this
 
02:00:19.189 --> 02:00:19.199 align:start position:0%
this enhancement itself just equalizes
 
02:00:21.910 --> 02:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
the playing field we've given this money
 
02:00:23.750 --> 02:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
to every other nursing home in the state
 
02:00:26.229 --> 02:00:26.239 align:start position:0%
to enhance wages for their employees
 
02:00:27.910 --> 02:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
glencliff was not given the same
 
02:00:30.229 --> 02:00:30.239 align:start position:0%
enhancement as nursing homes so all of
 
02:00:32.310 --> 02:00:32.320 align:start position:0%
the the nursing homes around glencliff
 
02:00:34.229 --> 02:00:34.239 align:start position:0%
are pulling from their staff from them
 
02:00:35.750 --> 02:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
because they're offering incentives that
 
02:00:40.950 --> 02:00:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:43.750 --> 02:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
02:00:47.109 --> 02:00:47.119 align:start position:0%

senator morris yeah is this direct money

02:02:28.790 --> 02:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
i guess my bigger question is it's not
 
02:02:31.990 --> 02:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
part of the 990
 
02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:32.950 align:start position:0%
part of the 990
okay

02:02:32.950 --> 02:02:32.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:02:34.709 --> 02:02:34.719 align:start position:0%
no senator uh
 
02:02:37.510 --> 02:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
taylor caswell again uh no this is under
 
02:02:40.229 --> 02:02:40.239 align:start position:0%
the uh emergency rental relief program
 
02:02:41.750 --> 02:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
it's separate from the fiscal recovery
 
02:02:41.760 --> 02:02:43.430 align:start position:0%
it's separate from the fiscal recovery
fund

02:02:43.430 --> 02:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
fund
 
02:02:45.750 --> 02:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:02:49.669 --> 02:02:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:52.229 --> 02:02:52.239 align:start position:0%
uh senator d'alessandro
 
02:02:54.229 --> 02:02:54.239 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh
 
02:02:55.910 --> 02:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
there have been some real concerns about
 
02:02:58.470 --> 02:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
how quickly this is getting out and i
 
02:02:58.480 --> 02:03:00.310 align:start position:0%
how quickly this is getting out and i
know

02:03:00.310 --> 02:03:00.320 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:03:02.149 --> 02:03:02.159 align:start position:0%
people are working overtime but double
 
02:03:05.270 --> 02:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
time to to get it out and taylor what it
 
02:03:06.390 --> 02:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
what is the
 
02:03:08.310 --> 02:03:08.320 align:start position:0%
what is the main problem is it the
 
02:03:11.030 --> 02:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
paperwork is it i mean is it that what
 
02:03:13.430 --> 02:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
it is there's a paper log gm
 
02:03:15.350 --> 02:03:15.360 align:start position:0%
in terms of it i know that the community
 
02:03:18.070 --> 02:03:18.080 align:start position:0%
action programs are basically given the
 
02:03:19.910 --> 02:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility of moving this stuff out
 
02:03:21.990 --> 02:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
the door they've done a pretty good job
 
02:03:24.550 --> 02:03:24.560 align:start position:0%
but what is the basic the the basic
 
02:03:24.560 --> 02:03:25.510 align:start position:0%
but what is the basic the the basic
problem

02:03:25.510 --> 02:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
problem
 
02:03:28.390 --> 02:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
yeah uh senator we i all your points are
 
02:03:30.790 --> 02:03:30.800 align:start position:0%
well taken we've been reducing
 
02:03:32.310 --> 02:03:32.320 align:start position:0%
new hampshire housing finance authority
 
02:03:34.629 --> 02:03:34.639 align:start position:0%
has really been sort of uh spearheading
 
02:03:37.189 --> 02:03:37.199 align:start position:0%
this effort with the caps uh they they
 
02:03:39.750 --> 02:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
have it's a very hand-holding sort of
 
02:03:41.589 --> 02:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
experience that you have to get through
 
02:03:43.270 --> 02:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
for each applicant
 
02:03:44.709 --> 02:03:44.719 align:start position:0%
in order to get
 
02:03:46.149 --> 02:03:46.159 align:start position:0%
you know through the eligibility
 
02:03:48.709 --> 02:03:48.719 align:start position:0%
component and get the money to them
 
02:03:50.470 --> 02:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
the time that it takes for them to
 
02:03:52.870 --> 02:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
process this entire process has been
 
02:03:56.470 --> 02:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
going down as we've gone along here um
 
02:03:58.790 --> 02:03:58.800 align:start position:0%
as far as the specific like exact
 
02:04:00.390 --> 02:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
reasons why
 
02:04:01.430 --> 02:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
i can't really speak to that
 
02:04:03.510 --> 02:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
specifically but we do watch that
 
02:04:05.589 --> 02:04:05.599 align:start position:0%
category from the gopher side i would
 
02:04:08.149 --> 02:04:08.159 align:start position:0%
say broadly though the funding that
 
02:04:10.790 --> 02:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here is a late item
 
02:04:12.870 --> 02:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
because we only got this resource
 
02:04:14.390 --> 02:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
dropped into the state accounts last
 
02:04:16.470 --> 02:04:16.480 align:start position:0%
friday so we want to move that over to
 
02:04:18.149 --> 02:04:18.159 align:start position:0%
them so that that's not standing in the
 
02:04:19.830 --> 02:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
way of any further
 
02:04:22.149 --> 02:04:22.159 align:start position:0%
delays that you're referring to
 
02:04:25.510 --> 02:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you senator rosenwald
 
02:04:26.629 --> 02:04:26.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:04:28.709 --> 02:04:28.719 align:start position:0%
how many um
 
02:04:28.719 --> 02:04:29.830 align:start position:0%
how many um
families

02:04:29.830 --> 02:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
families
 
02:04:32.470 --> 02:04:32.480 align:start position:0%
are you participating this
 
02:04:34.950 --> 02:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
30 million dollars is going to help and
 
02:04:36.550 --> 02:04:36.560 align:start position:0%
what for how long
 
02:04:38.709 --> 02:04:38.719 align:start position:0%
what kind of scope
 
02:04:41.430 --> 02:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
overall at this point under
 
02:04:45.270 --> 02:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
if you take both era 1 and era 2
 
02:04:47.830 --> 02:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
there have been a little over 13 000
 
02:04:49.990 --> 02:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
households that have been assisted thus
 
02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:51.430 align:start position:0%
households that have been assisted thus
far

02:04:51.430 --> 02:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
far
 
02:04:52.629 --> 02:04:52.639 align:start position:0%
and the average amount of that
 
02:04:54.550 --> 02:04:54.560 align:start position:0%
assistance is just under eight thousand
 
02:04:54.560 --> 02:04:56.310 align:start position:0%
assistance is just under eight thousand
dollars

02:04:56.310 --> 02:04:56.320 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:04:59.350 --> 02:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
so that's the scope this continues
 
02:05:05.589 --> 02:05:05.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:07.669 --> 02:05:07.679 align:start position:0%
representative leitchman
 
02:05:09.350 --> 02:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
thanks madam chair nice to see you
 
02:05:10.870 --> 02:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner i guess i could call you
 
02:05:13.510 --> 02:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
the uh our bazaar perhaps could you
 
02:05:16.470 --> 02:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:18.550 --> 02:05:18.560 align:start position:0%
could you tell us you know we see these
 
02:05:20.229 --> 02:05:20.239 align:start position:0%
requests coming in you just mentioned
 
02:05:21.990 --> 02:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
this came in like last friday or
 
02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:23.350 align:start position:0%
this came in like last friday or
whatever

02:05:23.350 --> 02:05:23.360 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
02:05:25.669 --> 02:05:25.679 align:start position:0%
is there more out there is this getting
 
02:05:28.069 --> 02:05:28.079 align:start position:0%
close to that's it there's still more
 
02:05:31.350 --> 02:05:31.360 align:start position:0%
left yeah so we expect to have
 
02:05:33.109 --> 02:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
the ability to see another toronto
 
02:05:35.990 --> 02:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
funding under this particular program
 
02:05:37.589 --> 02:05:37.599 align:start position:0%
sometime in the next couple resources in
 
02:05:39.750 --> 02:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
order to continue to see the funding hit
 
02:05:41.750 --> 02:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
our accounts but once it does hit our
 
02:05:43.510 --> 02:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
accounts we amend the contract and then
 
02:05:45.109 --> 02:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
send that money over to nif and have
 
02:05:47.430 --> 02:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
them continue to run the program
 
02:05:49.430 --> 02:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam chair are

02:06:17.910 --> 02:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:25.589 --> 02:06:25.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:27.589 --> 02:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
good afternoon senator thank you for the
 
02:06:27.599 --> 02:06:28.470 align:start position:0%
good afternoon senator thank you for the
question

02:06:28.470 --> 02:06:28.480 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:06:30.470 --> 02:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is rob daphis i'm
 
02:06:31.830 --> 02:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
the executive director of new hampshire
 
02:06:33.510 --> 02:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
housing finance authority so the
 
02:06:35.189 --> 02:06:35.199 align:start position:0%
emergency rental assistance program was
 
02:06:37.270 --> 02:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
established by congress with
 
02:06:39.830 --> 02:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
income and eligibility limits the income
 
02:06:43.109 --> 02:06:43.119 align:start position:0%
limit is 80 of area median income
 
02:06:45.430 --> 02:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
for where the applicant resides and then
 
02:06:47.589 --> 02:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
there are also eligibility
 
02:06:49.750 --> 02:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
requirements associated with
 
02:06:51.189 --> 02:06:51.199 align:start position:0%
the hardship that the applicant must
 
02:06:53.030 --> 02:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
have experienced during the coveted
 
02:06:56.470 --> 02:06:56.480 align:start position:0%
period and the eligibility the hardship
 
02:06:58.310 --> 02:06:58.320 align:start position:0%
the specifics of that hardship
 
02:06:59.510 --> 02:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
requirement are a little bit different
 
02:07:02.629 --> 02:07:02.639 align:start position:0%
between era 1 and era 2.
 
02:07:04.470 --> 02:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
this funding request is for the era 2
 
02:07:05.910 --> 02:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
funds which are a little bit more
 
02:07:07.589 --> 02:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
flexible somebody must have experienced
 
02:07:08.709 --> 02:07:08.719 align:start position:0%
a significant
 
02:07:11.830 --> 02:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
loss of income or increase in expenses
 
02:07:13.030 --> 02:07:13.040 align:start position:0%
during the period of the coveted
 
02:07:13.040 --> 02:07:17.189 align:start position:0%
during the period of the coveted
pandemic

02:07:17.189 --> 02:07:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:19.270 --> 02:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
do you have a follow-up thank you so my
 
02:07:20.790 --> 02:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
presumption is then
 
02:07:22.310 --> 02:07:22.320 align:start position:0%
that they would have to provide some
 
02:07:22.320 --> 02:07:23.350 align:start position:0%
that they would have to provide some
evidence

02:07:23.350 --> 02:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
02:07:27.189 --> 02:07:27.199 align:start position:0%
of covid causation to be eligible we're
 
02:07:28.709 --> 02:07:28.719 align:start position:0%
not just distributing money to people
 
02:07:29.990 --> 02:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
that want it
 
02:07:32.390 --> 02:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
so that was a specific requirement of
 
02:07:34.310 --> 02:07:34.320 align:start position:0%
era one was that there would be a
 
02:07:35.990 --> 02:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
coveted uh
 
02:07:37.270 --> 02:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
a direct relationship between the
 
02:07:39.589 --> 02:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
coveted pandemic and the uh and the
 
02:07:41.430 --> 02:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
hardship that the person experienced
 
02:07:43.510 --> 02:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
it's not quite as direct a relationship
 
02:07:45.990 --> 02:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
that's required under er a2 and so
 
02:07:47.430 --> 02:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
somebody has to self-attest that they
 
02:07:49.910 --> 02:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
experienced a hardship but they don't
 
02:07:52.069 --> 02:07:52.079 align:start position:0%
have to necessarily draw the connection
 
02:07:53.990 --> 02:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
between the coveted pandemic in a lot of
 
02:07:56.229 --> 02:07:56.239 align:start position:0%
cases this is related to something like
 
02:07:58.390 --> 02:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
increased household costs
 
02:08:00.950 --> 02:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
associated with increased gas prices or
 
02:08:02.950 --> 02:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
food heating utility prices and things
 
02:08:05.270 --> 02:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
like that anybody can get it
 
02:08:11.270 --> 02:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:12.790 --> 02:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
02:08:14.870 --> 02:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
representative emrick thank you madam
 
02:08:14.880 --> 02:08:16.229 align:start position:0%
representative emrick thank you madam
chair

02:08:16.229 --> 02:08:16.239 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:08:18.629 --> 02:08:18.639 align:start position:0%
you you dropped a number out there of 13
 
02:08:18.639 --> 02:08:20.069 align:start position:0%
you you dropped a number out there of 13
000

02:08:20.069 --> 02:08:20.079 align:start position:0%
000
 
02:08:22.550 --> 02:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
are currently in the program or have
 
02:08:24.870 --> 02:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
taken advantage of the program 13 000
 
02:08:26.790 --> 02:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
households that have been assisted or
 
02:08:28.629 --> 02:08:28.639 align:start position:0%
are currently being assisted that's one
 
02:08:31.510 --> 02:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
percent of the population
 
02:08:33.669 --> 02:08:33.679 align:start position:0%
so it's uh households as opposed to
 
02:08:33.679 --> 02:08:35.109 align:start position:0%
so it's uh households as opposed to
individuals

02:08:35.109 --> 02:08:35.119 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
02:08:36.790 --> 02:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
so it's even greater
 
02:08:38.390 --> 02:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
that's right wow okay
 
02:08:40.149 --> 02:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
that was how many
 
02:08:42.870 --> 02:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
do you have a backlog
 
02:08:45.109 --> 02:08:45.119 align:start position:0%
so there there are uh several thousand
 
02:08:47.109 --> 02:08:47.119 align:start position:0%
applications that are currently pending
 
02:08:49.109 --> 02:08:49.119 align:start position:0%
that the cap agencies have received that
 
02:08:51.030 --> 02:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
they haven't completed processing and
 
02:08:53.430 --> 02:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
determined their eligibility uh that's
 
02:08:55.910 --> 02:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh about 4700 applications at the
 
02:08:57.830 --> 02:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
present time now some of those are
 
02:08:59.189 --> 02:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
applications from households that have
 
02:09:00.950 --> 02:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
already been assisted so it's not
 
02:09:02.950 --> 02:09:02.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily another 5 000 households
 
02:09:04.470 --> 02:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
that are going to be assisted because
 
02:09:05.750 --> 02:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
you can only apply for a certain amount
 
02:09:07.990 --> 02:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
of assistance at a time so
 
02:09:09.270 --> 02:09:09.280 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
02:09:12.069 --> 02:09:12.079 align:start position:0%
so using kentucky windage of how many
 
02:09:14.390 --> 02:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
individuals per household blah blah blah
 
02:09:16.149 --> 02:09:16.159 align:start position:0%
we could be talking about three percent
 
02:09:18.709 --> 02:09:18.719 align:start position:0%
of the population
 
02:09:20.950 --> 02:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
50 percent of the households of of the
 
02:09:23.270 --> 02:09:23.280 align:start position:0%
state i'm i'm not trying to pin you down
 
02:09:25.350 --> 02:09:25.360 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying this is a bigger number
 
02:09:25.360 --> 02:09:26.069 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying this is a bigger number
than

02:09:26.069 --> 02:09:26.079 align:start position:0%
than
 
02:09:28.870 --> 02:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
i had envisioned or i could anticipate
 
02:09:30.229 --> 02:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
yes i think it's certainly more than one
 
02:09:31.510 --> 02:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
percent and it
 
02:09:32.790 --> 02:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
may be as high as three percent of the
 
02:09:34.390 --> 02:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
population it's been assisted in some
 
02:09:36.310 --> 02:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
way uh through this program thank you
 
02:09:38.629 --> 02:09:38.639 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
02:09:40.629 --> 02:09:40.639 align:start position:0%
and this is just rental assistance
 
02:09:43.830 --> 02:09:43.840 align:start position:0%
correct this is not mortgage assistance
 
02:09:45.189 --> 02:09:45.199 align:start position:0%
it's not mortgage assistance it's rental
 
02:09:47.189 --> 02:09:47.199 align:start position:0%
assistance and utilities and associated
 
02:09:47.199 --> 02:09:51.030 align:start position:0%
assistance and utilities and associated
costs

02:09:51.030 --> 02:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:52.950 --> 02:09:52.960 align:start position:0%
senator guida thank you ma'am sure did

thank you uh madam chairwoman so i
 
02:11:47.189 --> 02:11:47.199 align:start position:0%
wanted to walk through a couple of
 
02:11:49.350 --> 02:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
things uh with regard to the background
 
02:11:51.109 --> 02:11:51.119 align:start position:0%
of cares act
 
02:11:52.550 --> 02:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
you should have documents in front of
 
02:11:54.629 --> 02:11:54.639 align:start position:0%
you that give you
 
02:11:56.470 --> 02:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
the outline of the programs that were
 
02:11:59.669 --> 02:11:59.679 align:start position:0%
included under cares act
 
02:12:00.870 --> 02:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
so a couple of things i'm going to talk
 
02:12:03.030 --> 02:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
about sort of the background of this
 
02:12:05.669 --> 02:12:05.679 align:start position:0%
what we've the usage that we
 
02:12:07.189 --> 02:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
that we saw as a result of the
 
02:12:09.270 --> 02:12:09.280 align:start position:0%
programming a little bit about how we
 
02:12:11.109 --> 02:12:11.119 align:start position:0%
run the process or how we ran those
 
02:12:11.119 --> 02:12:12.149 align:start position:0%
run the process or how we ran those
programs

02:12:12.149 --> 02:12:12.159 align:start position:0%
programs
 
02:12:14.870 --> 02:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
at uh at gopher
 
02:12:16.069 --> 02:12:16.079 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:12:17.510 --> 02:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
just sort of where we are with keras
 
02:12:18.629 --> 02:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
right now
 
02:12:20.069 --> 02:12:20.079 align:start position:0%
so if you go all the way back to march
 
02:12:21.990 --> 02:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
13th of 2020 that's when the governor
 
02:12:24.069 --> 02:12:24.079 align:start position:0%
declared the state of emergency and the
 
02:12:26.149 --> 02:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
cares act was actually signed a law into
 
02:12:28.310 --> 02:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
law shortly thereafter on i believe was
 
02:12:30.069 --> 02:12:30.079 align:start position:0%
march 27th
 
02:12:33.109 --> 02:12:33.119 align:start position:0%
um we established gopher on april 14th
 
02:12:35.510 --> 02:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
of 2020
 
02:12:36.790 --> 02:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
and immediately
 
02:12:38.629 --> 02:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
those resources started coming to the
 
02:12:41.350 --> 02:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
state and a number of programs were
 
02:12:43.350 --> 02:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
designed initiated and executed and
 
02:12:46.550 --> 02:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
deployed pretty quickly because we had
 
02:12:48.229 --> 02:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
the main street relief fund which was
 
02:12:49.270 --> 02:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
our first
 
02:12:52.229 --> 02:12:52.239 align:start position:0%
uh program that was designed to assist
 
02:12:54.550 --> 02:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
small businesses around the state
 
02:12:57.669 --> 02:12:57.679 align:start position:0%
that launched on may 15th of 2020
 
02:13:01.030 --> 02:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
and in the end that fund ended up
 
02:13:03.030 --> 02:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
providing resources to the tune of
 
02:13:05.510 --> 02:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
around 400 million dollars
 
02:13:08.629 --> 02:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
to state employers
 
02:13:11.750 --> 02:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
subsequently by july 17
 
02:13:14.950 --> 02:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
a good almost a billion dollars worth of
 
02:13:17.430 --> 02:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
that cares act funding that we had
 
02:13:17.440 --> 02:13:18.870 align:start position:0%
that cares act funding that we had
received

02:13:18.870 --> 02:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
received
 
02:13:20.950 --> 02:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
was obligated
 
02:13:23.270 --> 02:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
and started to move out the door pretty
 
02:13:24.709 --> 02:13:24.719 align:start position:0%
quickly and this was
 
02:13:27.189 --> 02:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
very much by design time
 
02:13:28.709 --> 02:13:28.719 align:start position:0%
we wanted to
 
02:13:30.550 --> 02:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
make sure that these immediate relief
 
02:13:32.870 --> 02:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
funds were treated as such and were out
 
02:13:32.880 --> 02:13:33.990 align:start position:0%
funds were treated as such and were out
to

02:13:33.990 --> 02:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:13:35.830 --> 02:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
the people that needed it as quickly as
 
02:13:38.069 --> 02:13:38.079 align:start position:0%
we could get it
 
02:13:40.950 --> 02:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
i do think it's worth noting as well
 
02:13:42.950 --> 02:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
that the speed to which we were able to
 
02:13:45.189 --> 02:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
move those funds enabled a lot of
 
02:13:47.350 --> 02:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
businesses to keep their doors open a
 
02:13:49.589 --> 02:13:49.599 align:start position:0%
lot of people could stay employed
 
02:13:50.950 --> 02:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
through some of the depth of the
 
02:13:50.960 --> 02:13:52.310 align:start position:0%
through some of the depth of the
pandemic

02:13:52.310 --> 02:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
02:13:54.870 --> 02:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
in the summer and fall of 2020
 
02:13:57.589 --> 02:13:57.599 align:start position:0%
and did line us up quite nicely as we
 
02:13:59.270 --> 02:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
started to see our unemployment rate go
 
02:14:01.589 --> 02:14:01.599 align:start position:0%
from sixteen percent at the height uh
 
02:14:03.430 --> 02:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
right down into three percent uh in
 
02:14:05.750 --> 02:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
january and february of 2021.
 
02:14:09.030 --> 02:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh so uh and that was uh at a pace
 
02:14:11.510 --> 02:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
that uh exceeded other states in this
 
02:14:14.149 --> 02:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
part of the country
 
02:14:17.109 --> 02:14:17.119 align:start position:0%
if we look then continuing on we had the
 
02:14:20.149 --> 02:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
deadline original deadline for cares act
 
02:14:21.910 --> 02:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
as you will recall was
 
02:14:24.390 --> 02:14:24.400 align:start position:0%
december of 2020
 
02:14:27.189 --> 02:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
on december 27th of 2020 the federal
 
02:14:28.950 --> 02:14:28.960 align:start position:0%
government changed the deadline and
 
02:14:30.790 --> 02:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
pushed it out for a year
 
02:14:33.189 --> 02:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
which did throw a couple of programs
 
02:14:33.199 --> 02:14:34.149 align:start position:0%
which did throw a couple of programs
into

02:14:34.149 --> 02:14:34.159 align:start position:0%
into
 
02:14:36.470 --> 02:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh you know it enabled us to extend the
 
02:14:38.709 --> 02:14:38.719 align:start position:0%
life of several programs
 
02:14:41.270 --> 02:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
and to recycle some of those resources
 
02:14:44.870 --> 02:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
over the course of 2021.
 
02:14:48.229 --> 02:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
in june 2021 the state of emergency
 
02:14:48.239 --> 02:14:50.310 align:start position:0%
in june 2021 the state of emergency
expired

02:14:50.310 --> 02:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
expired
 
02:14:50.320 --> 02:14:51.350 align:start position:0%
expired
and

02:14:51.350 --> 02:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:14:52.870 --> 02:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
and then we went on from there i would
 
02:14:55.350 --> 02:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
say in between there i would note as
 
02:14:57.109 --> 02:14:57.119 align:start position:0%
well there was
 
02:14:57.119 --> 02:14:57.830 align:start position:0%
well there was
a

02:14:57.830 --> 02:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:15:00.709 --> 02:15:00.719 align:start position:0%
in the april time frame we did require
 
02:15:02.629 --> 02:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
those businesses that had received main
 
02:15:04.149 --> 02:15:04.159 align:start position:0%
street funds
 
02:15:07.830 --> 02:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
to submit their reports to us into dra
 
02:15:09.350 --> 02:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
at which time
 
02:15:11.669 --> 02:15:11.679 align:start position:0%
we were also told that
 
02:15:13.189 --> 02:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
some of those funds if they were not
 
02:15:15.669 --> 02:15:15.679 align:start position:0%
directly attributable to
 
02:15:15.679 --> 02:15:16.790 align:start position:0%
directly attributable to
revenue

02:15:16.790 --> 02:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
02:15:16.800 --> 02:15:17.990 align:start position:0%
revenue
losses

02:15:17.990 --> 02:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
losses
 
02:15:19.270 --> 02:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
during that period of time that there
 
02:15:20.950 --> 02:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
would be a need to recoup some of those
 
02:15:23.750 --> 02:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
funds from some of those businesses
 
02:15:25.510 --> 02:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
at which point that we
 
02:15:28.470 --> 02:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
we launched a new program that allowed
 
02:15:28.480 --> 02:15:29.589 align:start position:0%
we launched a new program that allowed
businesses

02:15:29.589 --> 02:15:29.599 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
02:15:32.149 --> 02:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
to take covert related expenses from
 
02:15:32.159 --> 02:15:33.669 align:start position:0%
to take covert related expenses from
2021

02:15:33.669 --> 02:15:33.679 align:start position:0%
2021
 
02:15:36.149 --> 02:15:36.159 align:start position:0%
and apply them to to the potential
 
02:15:38.629 --> 02:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
recruitment amount that they were facing
 
02:15:41.910 --> 02:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh under that chain under that provision
 
02:15:44.950 --> 02:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
and subsequently reduced the recruitment
 
02:15:47.589 --> 02:15:47.599 align:start position:0%
load pretty significantly uh for
 
02:15:49.750 --> 02:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
businesses around the state i would add
 
02:15:51.750 --> 02:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
that we additionally added a program
 
02:15:55.189 --> 02:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
near the end of 2021 that that further
 
02:15:57.109 --> 02:15:57.119 align:start position:0%
gave further opportunity for businesses
 
02:15:59.990 --> 02:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
to reduce that amount by with a coveted
 
02:16:02.470 --> 02:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
expense program that allowed them to be
 
02:16:05.030 --> 02:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
reimbursed for covert related expenses
 
02:16:06.709 --> 02:16:06.719 align:start position:0%
through for almost the entire year of
 
02:16:08.390 --> 02:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
2021. so
 
02:16:08.400 --> 02:16:09.589 align:start position:0%
2021. so
uh

02:16:09.589 --> 02:16:09.599 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:16:09.599 --> 02:16:11.030 align:start position:0%
uh
that

02:16:11.030 --> 02:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:16:12.709 --> 02:16:12.719 align:start position:0%
extension of time that we had
 
02:16:14.069 --> 02:16:14.079 align:start position:0%
experienced in
 
02:16:16.229 --> 02:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
december of 2020
 
02:16:18.310 --> 02:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
really did allow us to go back and make
 
02:16:19.990 --> 02:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
sure that we recycled those funds back
 
02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:20.950 align:start position:0%
sure that we recycled those funds back
into

02:16:20.950 --> 02:16:20.960 align:start position:0%
into
 
02:16:25.430 --> 02:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:25.440 --> 02:16:26.550 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:16:26.550 --> 02:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:28.069 --> 02:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
just in general
 
02:16:31.750 --> 02:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
of course the total amount that we were
 
02:16:33.830 --> 02:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
provided by the feds under care act
 
02:16:36.950 --> 02:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
cares act was 1.25 billion dollars
 
02:16:38.629 --> 02:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
at this point we have expended an
 
02:16:42.549 --> 02:16:42.559 align:start position:0%
obligated 1.18 billion dollars
 
02:16:44.950 --> 02:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
we fully expect by the time that we're
 
02:16:47.910 --> 02:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
done with the program later this fall
 
02:16:49.910 --> 02:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
that we will have expended every every
 
02:16:53.270 --> 02:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
cent of that 1.25 billion dollars
 
02:16:56.549 --> 02:16:56.559 align:start position:0%
over the course of the life of cares act
 
02:16:59.190 --> 02:16:59.200 align:start position:0%
there were around 70 individual relief
 
02:17:03.110 --> 02:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
programs that were initiated and over 15
 
02:17:03.120 --> 02:17:04.309 align:start position:0%
programs that were initiated and over 15
000

02:17:04.309 --> 02:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
000
 
02:17:07.830 --> 02:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
recipients of funding under the program
 
02:17:09.509 --> 02:17:09.519 align:start position:0%
and as i pointed out
 
02:17:11.830 --> 02:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
a good portion of that roughly about
 
02:17:15.190 --> 02:17:15.200 align:start position:0%
half of those funds were related to
 
02:17:18.070 --> 02:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
employer relief and i i would i would
 
02:17:20.070 --> 02:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
point out that the employer relief
 
02:17:22.629 --> 02:17:22.639 align:start position:0%
component of that was not exclusively
 
02:17:24.309 --> 02:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
for profits
 
02:17:26.389 --> 02:17:26.399 align:start position:0%
we also provided a number of programs
 
02:17:28.709 --> 02:17:28.719 align:start position:0%
for non-profit employers including a
 
02:17:31.270 --> 02:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
program called the nerf program
 
02:17:33.669 --> 02:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
that i think totaled around 41 million
 
02:17:35.910 --> 02:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
dollars that was
 
02:17:37.910 --> 02:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
basically a copy of the main street
 
02:17:39.990 --> 02:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
program that allowed
 
02:17:43.030 --> 02:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
those non-profits to also benefit as
 
02:17:43.040 --> 02:17:44.469 align:start position:0%
those non-profits to also benefit as
employers

02:17:44.469 --> 02:17:44.479 align:start position:0%
employers
 
02:17:47.190 --> 02:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
from those resources we also had
 
02:17:48.950 --> 02:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
programs for hotels and for lodging
 
02:17:50.950 --> 02:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
operations performing arts
 
02:17:52.549 --> 02:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
uh and restaurants
 
02:17:54.629 --> 02:17:54.639 align:start position:0%
as we went through that process
 
02:17:56.790 --> 02:17:56.800 align:start position:0%
the second largest uh component of
 
02:17:58.629 --> 02:17:58.639 align:start position:0%
resources you know if you take them in
 
02:17:59.990 --> 02:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
big buckets was really in the health
 
02:18:02.230 --> 02:18:02.240 align:start position:0%
care space
 
02:18:03.669 --> 02:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
all total on the cares act that was
 
02:18:06.549 --> 02:18:06.559 align:start position:0%
around 236 million dollars
 
02:18:07.990 --> 02:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
those were for things like hospitals
 
02:18:09.990 --> 02:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
support direct hospital support
 
02:18:11.589 --> 02:18:11.599 align:start position:0%
long-term care facilities and
 
02:18:11.599 --> 02:18:13.110 align:start position:0%
long-term care facilities and
stabilization

02:18:13.110 --> 02:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
stabilization
 
02:18:15.509 --> 02:18:15.519 align:start position:0%
mental health facilities and
 
02:18:17.190 --> 02:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder
 
02:18:17.200 --> 02:18:20.389 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder
programming

02:18:20.389 --> 02:18:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:23.669 --> 02:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
i wanted to spend just a quick moment on
 
02:18:25.750 --> 02:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
how this process
 
02:18:29.030 --> 02:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
sort of operated behind the scenes
 
02:18:30.790 --> 02:18:30.800 align:start position:0%
because it is one thing to be able to
 
02:18:32.309 --> 02:18:32.319 align:start position:0%
get the funding
 
02:18:33.830 --> 02:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
approved and to move forward it's
 
02:18:35.669 --> 02:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
another thing to operationalize this
 
02:18:37.589 --> 02:18:37.599 align:start position:0%
number of programs
 
02:18:37.599 --> 02:18:38.549 align:start position:0%
number of programs
and

02:18:38.549 --> 02:18:38.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:18:41.190 --> 02:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
you know while i came to gopher
 
02:18:44.230 --> 02:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
in september of 2021
 
02:18:45.509 --> 02:18:45.519 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of action that had
 
02:18:47.429 --> 02:18:47.439 align:start position:0%
already taken place under
 
02:18:49.110 --> 02:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
jerry little's uh
 
02:18:50.790 --> 02:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
role in the sa in the same role that i
 
02:18:52.549 --> 02:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
had in the staff
 
02:18:54.709 --> 02:18:54.719 align:start position:0%
some of whom are still with us on the
 
02:18:56.870 --> 02:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
gopher side put in
 
02:18:59.429 --> 02:18:59.439 align:start position:0%
extremely long hours in
 
02:19:02.549 --> 02:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
getting these programs up and running
 
02:19:04.709 --> 02:19:04.719 align:start position:0%
we would go through a whole process of
 
02:19:06.950 --> 02:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
making sure that everything that we were
 
02:19:09.910 --> 02:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
proposing all of the provisions of the
 
02:19:09.920 --> 02:19:11.030 align:start position:0%
proposing all of the provisions of the
program

02:19:11.030 --> 02:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:19:12.709 --> 02:19:12.719 align:start position:0%
met the eligibility requirements of
 
02:19:15.030 --> 02:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
cares act we would have to go through a
 
02:19:16.950 --> 02:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
process just for example on the main
 
02:19:18.830 --> 02:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
street fund alone of designing an
 
02:19:22.150 --> 02:19:22.160 align:start position:0%
application uh we that that we tried to
 
02:19:23.990 --> 02:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
keep that as short as we possibly could
 
02:19:25.190 --> 02:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
it went through a whole process of
 
02:19:26.870 --> 02:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
making sure that we were not
 
02:19:28.629 --> 02:19:28.639 align:start position:0%
requiring anything that was not
 
02:19:30.549 --> 02:19:30.559 align:start position:0%
absolutely necessary to run the program
 
02:19:33.190 --> 02:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
or to report on that program later on
 
02:19:35.270 --> 02:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
that all had to be developed and put
 
02:19:35.280 --> 02:19:36.389 align:start position:0%
that all had to be developed and put
online

02:19:36.389 --> 02:19:36.399 align:start position:0%
online
 
02:19:39.509 --> 02:19:39.519 align:start position:0%
uh tested extensively and then used by
 
02:19:42.309 --> 02:19:42.319 align:start position:0%
tens of thousands of businesses
 
02:19:43.830 --> 02:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
and then once those applications were
 
02:19:45.349 --> 02:19:45.359 align:start position:0%
reviewed we had to
 
02:19:46.950 --> 02:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
receive we had to review all of those
 
02:19:49.030 --> 02:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
applications and once again work with
 
02:19:51.110 --> 02:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
those businesses and individual
 
02:19:53.190 --> 02:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
organizations to make sure that what
 
02:19:54.309 --> 02:19:54.319 align:start position:0%
they were requesting met the
 
02:19:54.319 --> 02:19:55.910 align:start position:0%
they were requesting met the
requirements

02:19:55.910 --> 02:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
02:19:57.349 --> 02:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
our whole attitude throughout this
 
02:20:00.150 --> 02:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
entire period was to get this money into
 
02:20:02.150 --> 02:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
the hands of the recipients with his
 
02:20:03.910 --> 02:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
little with his little
 
02:20:05.670 --> 02:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
you know bureaucracy so to speak as
 
02:20:05.680 --> 02:20:07.190 align:start position:0%
you know bureaucracy so to speak as
necessary

02:20:07.190 --> 02:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
02:20:09.670 --> 02:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
and to really continue to recognize as i
 
02:20:12.389 --> 02:20:12.399 align:start position:0%
mentioned that these funds were relief
 
02:20:14.550 --> 02:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
funds and we treated them as such and
 
02:20:15.510 --> 02:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
tried to get them out the door as
 
02:20:17.349 --> 02:20:17.359 align:start position:0%
quickly as possible but there's a lot of
 
02:20:19.670 --> 02:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
businesses had individual circumstances
 
02:20:22.950 --> 02:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
had individual situations uh that needed
 
02:20:24.790 --> 02:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
literally a lot of hand-holding from our
 
02:20:27.429 --> 02:20:27.439 align:start position:0%
staff and also from the department of
 
02:20:28.950 --> 02:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
revenue administration which was very
 
02:20:31.030 --> 02:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
central to at least that particular
 
02:20:31.040 --> 02:20:33.030 align:start position:0%
central to at least that particular
program

02:20:33.030 --> 02:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:20:34.630 --> 02:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
then we get to the point of awards a lot
 
02:20:36.150 --> 02:20:36.160 align:start position:0%
of these programs had literal paper
 
02:20:38.150 --> 02:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
checks that had to go out uh that's
 
02:20:40.870 --> 02:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
where our uh our friends at dis really
 
02:20:42.230 --> 02:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
02:20:44.870 --> 02:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
stepped up and enabled us to move those
 
02:20:46.630 --> 02:20:46.640 align:start position:0%
those funds quickly and to get the
 
02:20:48.469 --> 02:20:48.479 align:start position:0%
checks out uh
 
02:20:50.630 --> 02:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
the behind the scenes uh you know
 
02:20:52.710 --> 02:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
getting addresses and that sort of thing
 
02:20:55.349 --> 02:20:55.359 align:start position:0%
from dr from us to dra to das and this
 
02:20:57.349 --> 02:20:57.359 align:start position:0%
whole process was
 
02:20:59.510 --> 02:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
took a lot of time uh but it did
 
02:21:02.710 --> 02:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
actually work and and the results as
 
02:21:05.510 --> 02:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
i've stated were pretty good
 
02:21:06.950 --> 02:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
now we're very much in the in the
 
02:21:06.960 --> 02:21:08.389 align:start position:0%
now we're very much in the in the
monitoring

02:21:08.389 --> 02:21:08.399 align:start position:0%
monitoring
 
02:21:10.710 --> 02:21:10.720 align:start position:0%
standpoint uh and finishing up and
 
02:21:12.550 --> 02:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
getting those reports done there's a
 
02:21:14.950 --> 02:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
couple of programs as you know that we
 
02:21:16.550 --> 02:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
did a little switcheroo at the end of
 
02:21:19.110 --> 02:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
2021 when they allowed us to put some
 
02:21:20.950 --> 02:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
types of programs
 
02:21:23.429 --> 02:21:23.439 align:start position:0%
into cares act from arpa
 
02:21:24.950 --> 02:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
those programs are
 
02:21:28.150 --> 02:21:28.160 align:start position:0%
wrapping up the recoupment components
 
02:21:29.510 --> 02:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
are wrapping up
 
02:21:30.950 --> 02:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
and we're getting to the point now where
 
02:21:32.469 --> 02:21:32.479 align:start position:0%
we're able to get a clear vision as to
 
02:21:34.469 --> 02:21:34.479 align:start position:0%
what the numbers are looking like
 
02:21:36.070 --> 02:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
and i would say you know the biggest one
 
02:21:37.590 --> 02:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
that we're watching is the waterfall
 
02:21:39.510 --> 02:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
amount as you know at the end of the
 
02:21:42.550 --> 02:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
fund once all of the cares act programs
 
02:21:44.070 --> 02:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
and everything has been said and done
 
02:21:45.990 --> 02:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
and accounted for anything that's
 
02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:47.110 align:start position:0%
and accounted for anything that's
remaining

02:21:47.110 --> 02:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
remaining
 
02:21:49.110 --> 02:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
would waterfall into the state's
 
02:21:50.950 --> 02:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
unemployment trust fund
 
02:21:52.710 --> 02:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
and at this point we're roughly
 
02:21:54.389 --> 02:21:54.399 align:start position:0%
estimating that to be somewhere between
 
02:21:57.510 --> 02:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
45 and 70 million dollars
 
02:21:59.830 --> 02:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
once we get to the end of
 
02:22:03.030 --> 02:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
this whole process and
 
02:22:04.790 --> 02:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
my friend chase here spends a lot of
 
02:22:06.870 --> 02:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
late nights reporting to
 
02:22:09.190 --> 02:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
treasury and gathering information from
 
02:22:11.190 --> 02:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
the different agencies and from so on
 
02:22:13.030 --> 02:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
and so forth
 
02:22:15.510 --> 02:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
to make sure that that all occurs so
 
02:22:18.389 --> 02:22:18.399 align:start position:0%
i guess that's the quick overview i know
 
02:22:20.630 --> 02:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
of a process that many of you were
 
02:22:21.830 --> 02:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
involved in through the legislative
 
02:22:23.030 --> 02:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
advisory board and some of the
 
02:22:24.710 --> 02:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
stakeholder boards that were occurred
 
02:22:26.950 --> 02:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
under the state of emergency uh and
 
02:22:30.150 --> 02:22:30.160 align:start position:0%
again it's just sort of a snapshot and
 
02:22:32.790 --> 02:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
again we'll i think we're planning to
 
02:22:35.429 --> 02:22:35.439 align:start position:0%
come back and be here again and at your
 
02:22:36.870 --> 02:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
march meeting and
 
02:22:38.630 --> 02:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
give a similar update on where we are
 
02:22:40.309 --> 02:22:40.319 align:start position:0%
with the arpa funds so
 
02:22:42.309 --> 02:22:42.319 align:start position:0%
i think i can stop that there and
 
02:22:44.230 --> 02:22:44.240 align:start position:0%
certainly happy to talk about or answer
 
02:22:46.870 --> 02:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
any questions that anybody might have
 
02:22:49.190 --> 02:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
yes senator guida very quickly madam
 
02:22:51.349 --> 02:22:51.359 align:start position:0%
chair thank you uh commissioner taylor
 
02:22:52.469 --> 02:22:52.479 align:start position:0%
for your uh
 
02:22:53.990 --> 02:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh for your testimony i note that your
 
02:22:56.870 --> 02:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
hair wants blonde is now gray
 
02:22:58.309 --> 02:22:58.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for noticing senator and with
 
02:23:00.230 --> 02:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
that i would i would ask is there any
 
02:23:02.550 --> 02:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
kind of an audit function of these funds
 
02:23:04.389 --> 02:23:04.399 align:start position:0%
you know spot audits for
 
02:23:05.910 --> 02:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
for the integrity of applicants and
 
02:23:07.830 --> 02:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
things like that absolutely that's a
 
02:23:09.190 --> 02:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
good point i neglected to mention that
 
02:23:10.550 --> 02:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
particularly under
 
02:23:12.710 --> 02:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
the larger programs we absolutely
 
02:23:14.150 --> 02:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
perform spot audits and we're still
 
02:23:15.349 --> 02:23:15.359 align:start position:0%
doing that
 
02:23:20.790 --> 02:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:23.910 --> 02:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
yes senator daniels thank you would you
 
02:23:25.830 --> 02:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
expect that the amount that you'll be
 
02:23:27.750 --> 02:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
left over in the waterfall going to
 
02:23:30.070 --> 02:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
employment security would be enough to
 
02:23:31.990 --> 02:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
trigger a decrease in rates for
 
02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:33.429 align:start position:0%
trigger a decrease in rates for
employers

02:23:33.429 --> 02:23:33.439 align:start position:0%
employers
 
02:23:33.439 --> 02:23:34.469 align:start position:0%
employers
uh

02:23:34.469 --> 02:23:34.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:23:35.910 --> 02:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
as i recall
 
02:23:37.750 --> 02:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
there is a threshold that we are trying
 
02:23:38.870 --> 02:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
to meet
 
02:23:41.030 --> 02:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
with that category and to also stay
 
02:23:42.469 --> 02:23:42.479 align:start position:0%
under because i think we changed that
 
02:23:43.670 --> 02:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
didn't we
 
02:23:44.830 --> 02:23:44.840 align:start position:0%
do you want to explain
 
02:23:44.840 --> 02:23:46.469 align:start position:0%
do you want to explain
that

02:23:46.469 --> 02:23:46.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:23:48.630 --> 02:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
uh chase hageman deputy director at uh
 
02:23:50.150 --> 02:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
gopher it's probably a better question
 
02:23:52.389 --> 02:23:52.399 align:start position:0%
for nhes but we have had conversations
 
02:23:55.590 --> 02:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
about um making you know ensuring that
 
02:23:57.990 --> 02:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh the timelines are appropriate in
 
02:24:00.309 --> 02:24:00.319 align:start position:0%
terms of meeting any thresholds and
 
02:24:02.389 --> 02:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
triggering any any rate cuts or
 
02:24:03.910 --> 02:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
increases um
 
02:24:05.830 --> 02:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
and i i believe the
 
02:24:08.710 --> 02:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
the amount that we're talking about
 
02:24:09.830 --> 02:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
should not
 
02:24:11.750 --> 02:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
at least in loot in in preliminary
 
02:24:13.429 --> 02:24:13.439 align:start position:0%
conversations not cause any problems
 
02:24:16.389 --> 02:24:16.399 align:start position:0%
basically is really the short answer
 
02:24:19.190 --> 02:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:19.200 --> 02:24:19.910 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:24:19.910 --> 02:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:24:21.830 --> 02:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
representative leishman
 
02:24:23.750 --> 02:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
thanks many chair and commissioner this
 
02:24:26.469 --> 02:24:26.479 align:start position:0%
report was very helpful and uh do you
 
02:24:28.710 --> 02:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
share my concerns because i look at
 
02:24:28.720 --> 02:24:29.510 align:start position:0%
share my concerns because i look at
these

02:24:29.510 --> 02:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:24:31.670 --> 02:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
a number of the recipients like veterans
 
02:24:33.750 --> 02:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
programs homelessness
 
02:24:36.630 --> 02:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
all good causes when this money
 
02:24:38.389 --> 02:24:38.399 align:start position:0%
is completely gone
 
02:24:40.469 --> 02:24:40.479 align:start position:0%
are we going to see a very negative
 
02:24:42.469 --> 02:24:42.479 align:start position:0%
impact on some of these programs that we
 
02:24:44.790 --> 02:24:44.800 align:start position:0%
helped create or support or are my
 
02:24:47.910 --> 02:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
concerns like misguided
 
02:24:49.510 --> 02:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
that's a good point representation i
 
02:24:51.830 --> 02:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
mean we sort of refer to that issue as
 
02:24:54.870 --> 02:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
the prime directive at gopher just said
 
02:24:56.389 --> 02:24:56.399 align:start position:0%
jokingly i guess but
 
02:24:56.399 --> 02:24:57.429 align:start position:0%
jokingly i guess but
um

02:24:57.429 --> 02:24:57.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:00.870 --> 02:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
the idea of making these investments is
 
02:25:03.349 --> 02:25:03.359 align:start position:0%
as as one time as we possibly can make
 
02:25:03.359 --> 02:25:04.070 align:start position:0%
as as one time as we possibly can make
them

02:25:04.070 --> 02:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:25:05.590 --> 02:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
has been um
 
02:25:06.870 --> 02:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
you know certain part of the culture
 
02:25:09.270 --> 02:25:09.280 align:start position:0%
throughout we have not we've been very
 
02:25:11.030 --> 02:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
sensitive to the fact
 
02:25:13.670 --> 02:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
that as you point out there are
 
02:25:15.429 --> 02:25:15.439 align:start position:0%
potentially instances where the
 
02:25:17.030 --> 02:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
emergency and the nature of the
 
02:25:20.309 --> 02:25:20.319 align:start position:0%
emergency created a need an immediate
 
02:25:22.150 --> 02:25:22.160 align:start position:0%
need in the in the
 
02:25:23.910 --> 02:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
to benefit the public to make
 
02:25:23.920 --> 02:25:25.030 align:start position:0%
to benefit the public to make
investments

02:25:25.030 --> 02:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
investments
 
02:25:25.040 --> 02:25:26.150 align:start position:0%
investments
um

02:25:26.150 --> 02:25:26.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:29.110 --> 02:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
uh in in more than one yes
 
02:25:31.030 --> 02:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
it's sort of operational management type
 
02:25:34.070 --> 02:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:36.550 --> 02:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
my hope is that those can trigger
 
02:25:39.110 --> 02:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
institutional changes
 
02:25:41.349 --> 02:25:41.359 align:start position:0%
in those networks where we had to make
 
02:25:44.870 --> 02:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
those investments to avoid the issue of
 
02:25:47.590 --> 02:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
setting up basically a cliff where we
 
02:25:50.070 --> 02:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
have made investments that are going to
 
02:25:52.790 --> 02:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
carry an institution or an organization
 
02:25:54.790 --> 02:25:54.800 align:start position:0%
out to a certain point and then the
 
02:25:58.309 --> 02:25:58.319 align:start position:0%
money drops and away it goes so
 
02:26:01.110 --> 02:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
we have had the uh i would say in most
 
02:26:03.110 --> 02:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
instances what you're seeing in the
 
02:26:05.510 --> 02:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
programs particularly under arpa cares
 
02:26:06.790 --> 02:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
act was a little bit different in the
 
02:26:10.150 --> 02:26:10.160 align:start position:0%
sense that it was an emergency situation
 
02:26:11.830 --> 02:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
but we've been very sensitive to
 
02:26:13.990 --> 02:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
minimizing that type those types of
 
02:26:16.070 --> 02:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
investments thank you thank you madam
 
02:26:16.080 --> 02:26:17.190 align:start position:0%
investments thank you thank you madam
chair

it's an excellent summary that all of us
 
02:26:30.870 --> 02:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
i think knew
 
02:26:33.670 --> 02:26:33.680 align:start position:0%
little parts and pieces of but
 
02:26:36.870 --> 02:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
didn't have the the full um the full
 
02:26:38.309 --> 02:26:38.319 align:start position:0%
picture of
 
02:26:38.319 --> 02:26:40.389 align:start position:0%
picture of
what

02:26:40.389 --> 02:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:26:43.990 --> 02:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
i can't even say that money uh what the
 
02:26:46.230 --> 02:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
yes i can
 
02:26:48.150 --> 02:26:48.160 align:start position:0%
only because when i was in the air force
 
02:26:49.910 --> 02:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
we'd say oh well it's a billion here and
 
02:26:51.830 --> 02:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
a billionaire what difference does it
 
02:26:52.870 --> 02:26:52.880 align:start position:0%

02:30:15.750 --> 02:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
the plan has about
 
02:30:17.510 --> 02:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
over 800 000
 
02:30:17.520 --> 02:30:18.389 align:start position:0%
over 800 000
accounts

02:30:18.389 --> 02:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
accounts
 
02:30:18.399 --> 02:30:21.590 align:start position:0%
accounts
and

02:30:21.590 --> 02:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:23.830 --> 02:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
and you had a very successful year over
 
02:30:26.550 --> 02:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
the past year um the plan uh grew
 
02:30:28.469 --> 02:30:28.479 align:start position:0%
approximately i don't know i don't have
 
02:30:34.309 --> 02:30:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:35.910 --> 02:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
sixteen percent
 
02:30:38.309 --> 02:30:38.319 align:start position:0%
and that can be attributed to uh again
 
02:30:40.070 --> 02:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
the performance of the um the excellent
 
02:30:41.590 --> 02:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
performance of the capital markets but
 
02:30:44.870 --> 02:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
also uh due to the contributions from a
 
02:30:47.190 --> 02:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
program manager federal investments that
 
02:30:49.590 --> 02:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
continue their efforts to increase new
 
02:30:49.600 --> 02:30:50.710 align:start position:0%
continue their efforts to increase new
accounts

02:30:50.710 --> 02:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
accounts
 
02:30:50.720 --> 02:30:51.510 align:start position:0%
accounts
and

02:30:51.510 --> 02:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:30:53.270 --> 02:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
increase contributions as this plan
 
02:30:55.590 --> 02:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
continues to mature and more families
 
02:30:58.950 --> 02:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
use these funds to withdraw them for for
 
02:31:00.469 --> 02:31:00.479 align:start position:0%
the college expenses
 
02:31:02.630 --> 02:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh again the the plan continues with a
 
02:31:04.389 --> 02:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
what a steady growth
 
02:31:04.399 --> 02:31:05.270 align:start position:0%
what a steady growth
um

02:31:05.270 --> 02:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:07.990 --> 02:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
as you also know um the state also
 
02:31:09.670 --> 02:31:09.680 align:start position:0%
benefits from the
 
02:31:11.590 --> 02:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
administrative assessment that is
 
02:31:15.030 --> 02:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
charged to 59 participants and again the
 
02:31:15.040 --> 02:31:16.550 align:start position:0%
charged to 59 participants and again the
state

02:31:16.550 --> 02:31:16.560 align:start position:0%

between were ranged between
 
02:31:40.389 --> 02:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
1 000 and 11 000 for for families for
 
02:31:40.399 --> 02:31:41.429 align:start position:0%
1 000 and 11 000 for for families for
students

02:31:41.429 --> 02:31:41.439 align:start position:0%
students
 
02:31:43.750 --> 02:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
so again another successful year so we
 
02:31:45.830 --> 02:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
hope that this strength continues in
 
02:31:48.309 --> 02:31:48.319 align:start position:0%
many years to come so with that i will
 
02:31:50.230 --> 02:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
turn it over to mr burns for the actual
 
02:31:52.389 --> 02:31:52.399 align:start position:0%
audit results
 
02:31:54.230 --> 02:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
perfect thanks a lot and it's great to
 
02:31:56.790 --> 02:31:56.800 align:start position:0%
be here in person and for the record i'm
 
02:31:58.230 --> 02:31:58.240 align:start position:0%
declan byrne the other partner
 
02:32:00.950 --> 02:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
responsible for the audits for pwc for
 
02:32:03.190 --> 02:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
the 529 plans here in new hampshire it
 
02:32:05.349 --> 02:32:05.359 align:start position:0%
is great to be here in person and it's
 
02:32:07.190 --> 02:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
been a been a two years since we
 
02:32:09.510 --> 02:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
presented these results in person and
 
02:32:10.950 --> 02:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
it's one of the highlights of the year
 
02:32:13.110 --> 02:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
for me come here and present the results
 
02:32:14.389 --> 02:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
and we did provide our materials in
 
02:32:16.630 --> 02:32:16.640 align:start position:0%
advance maybe i'll refer to page six
 
02:32:18.790 --> 02:32:18.800 align:start position:0%
which which is the substantive areas of
 
02:32:21.270 --> 02:32:21.280 align:start position:0%
our of our audit which we executed as of
 
02:32:23.190 --> 02:32:23.200 align:start position:0%
9 30 year-round
 
02:32:24.630 --> 02:32:24.640 align:start position:0%
and as monica said it was a very
 
02:32:26.950 --> 02:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
successful audit no major findings as
 
02:32:29.190 --> 02:32:29.200 align:start position:0%
part of this year's year's audit we
 
02:32:31.190 --> 02:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
we've signed off our ordered opinion on
 
02:32:32.630 --> 02:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
december 20th
 
02:32:33.990 --> 02:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
that was pretty consistent with prior
 
02:32:35.429 --> 02:32:35.439 align:start position:0%
year pretty consistent with where we
 
02:32:38.309 --> 02:32:38.319 align:start position:0%
planned and our designed our procedures
 
02:32:40.469 --> 02:32:40.479 align:start position:0%
uh did not have to substantially change
 
02:32:42.150 --> 02:32:42.160 align:start position:0%
during the course of the audit that's a
 
02:32:44.309 --> 02:32:44.319 align:start position:0%
reflection of the good support we got
 
02:32:46.469 --> 02:32:46.479 align:start position:0%
from both fidelity the administrator as
 
02:32:48.630 --> 02:32:48.640 align:start position:0%
well as monacan team as we work through
 
02:32:50.630 --> 02:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
our audits through october november and
 
02:32:53.190 --> 02:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
december so pretty standard good results
 
02:32:55.270 --> 02:32:55.280 align:start position:0%
with a lot of our team work from home
 
02:32:57.190 --> 02:32:57.200 align:start position:0%
but that is the new normal and my
 
02:32:59.030 --> 02:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
highlight on some of the pages here some
 
02:33:00.870 --> 02:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
of the report reportable items and
 
02:33:02.790 --> 02:33:02.800 align:start position:0%
there's not a lot significant of a
 
02:33:04.950 --> 02:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
negative manner to report and we did not
 
02:33:06.950 --> 02:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
find any significant deficiencies
 
02:33:10.870 --> 02:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
material weaknesses fraud legal acts
 
02:33:12.630 --> 02:33:12.640 align:start position:0%
anything in the control environment
 
02:33:14.550 --> 02:33:14.560 align:start position:0%
worthy of your attention
 
02:33:16.469 --> 02:33:16.479 align:start position:0%
we rely significantly on the on the
 
02:33:18.150 --> 02:33:18.160 align:start position:0%
audits of the
 
02:33:19.910 --> 02:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
internal controls of fidelity at the
 
02:33:22.230 --> 02:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
provider they they house the books and
 
02:33:23.910 --> 02:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
records and we spend a lot of time with
 
02:33:25.990 --> 02:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
that organization understanding their
 
02:33:28.070 --> 02:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
control environment and making sure
 
02:33:29.750 --> 02:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
they're accurately recording the
 
02:33:32.469 --> 02:33:32.479 align:start position:0%
existence valuation and dda plan
 
02:33:34.389 --> 02:33:34.399 align:start position:0%
expenses that are in the plan
 
02:33:36.150 --> 02:33:36.160 align:start position:0%
we didn't find any exceptions we'd have
 
02:33:38.389 --> 02:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
no unrecorded misstatements or record
 
02:33:39.910 --> 02:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
misstatements so i would say it was a
 
02:33:41.190 --> 02:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
very smooth
 
02:33:43.670 --> 02:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh well-organized audit and we released
 
02:33:45.590 --> 02:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
on time so our team could go off and
 
02:33:47.590 --> 02:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
have their christmas break
 
02:33:47.600 --> 02:33:48.389 align:start position:0%
have their christmas break
um

02:33:48.389 --> 02:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:51.270 --> 02:33:51.280 align:start position:0%
in terms of our other areas of focus in
 
02:33:54.309 --> 02:33:54.319 align:start position:0%
the order that's fraud we certainly tend
 
02:33:56.469 --> 02:33:56.479 align:start position:0%
to mix up our procedures every year from
 
02:33:59.429 --> 02:33:59.439 align:start position:0%
an unpredictable predictably standpoint
 
02:34:00.710 --> 02:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
uh testing
 
02:34:02.469 --> 02:34:02.479 align:start position:0%
material items just to keep fidelity on
 
02:34:03.670 --> 02:34:03.680 align:start position:0%
their toes
 
02:34:05.670 --> 02:34:05.680 align:start position:0%
no exceptions noted we also do fraud
 
02:34:07.030 --> 02:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
inquiries with
 
02:34:08.790 --> 02:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
members of management and nothing came
 
02:34:11.030 --> 02:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
to our attention um from a fraud or
 
02:34:13.349 --> 02:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
legal acts perspective
 
02:34:15.830 --> 02:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
now the other parts of our report covers
 
02:34:17.830 --> 02:34:17.840 align:start position:0%
our required communications and these
 
02:34:19.349 --> 02:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
are standard under professional
 
02:34:21.510 --> 02:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
standards and i'd refer to them on asian
 
02:34:23.429 --> 02:34:23.439 align:start position:0%
10 but really with nothing of
 
02:34:25.349 --> 02:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
significance that i would actually draw
 
02:34:26.870 --> 02:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
your attention we have a lot of no
 
02:34:29.030 --> 02:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
answers here that's a good result
 
02:34:30.870 --> 02:34:30.880 align:start position:0%
some of the hot major highlights here is
 
02:34:32.630 --> 02:34:32.640 align:start position:0%
we didn't encounter many difficulties in
 
02:34:34.469 --> 02:34:34.479 align:start position:0%
the audit the quality of the financial
 
02:34:36.070 --> 02:34:36.080 align:start position:0%
statements uh
 
02:34:38.230 --> 02:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
are always in line with professional
 
02:34:39.990 --> 02:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
standards and we've no major exceptions
 
02:34:41.910 --> 02:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
as it relates to disclosures
 
02:34:44.070 --> 02:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
and as i mentioned no no controlled
 
02:34:46.630 --> 02:34:46.640 align:start position:0%
efficiencies or identified misstatements
 
02:34:49.349 --> 02:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
so overall as we sit back um we're very
 
02:34:51.590 --> 02:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
pleased that we signed off on time
 
02:34:53.270 --> 02:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
great collaboration with management
 
02:34:55.030 --> 02:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
we're so we're very happy that we're
 
02:34:56.150 --> 02:34:56.160 align:start position:0%
able to
 
02:34:57.910 --> 02:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh finish on time and in a
 
02:35:00.150 --> 02:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
well-organized manner so um you know
 
02:35:02.550 --> 02:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
another successful year behind us and we
 
02:35:04.870 --> 02:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
thanked the monican team and the
 
02:35:07.030 --> 02:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
fidelity for being good partners and
 
02:35:08.870 --> 02:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
giving us all the required support on
 
02:35:10.950 --> 02:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
time so we're able to effectively uh
 
02:35:12.550 --> 02:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
finish your audit so
 
02:35:14.710 --> 02:35:14.720 align:start position:0%
with that um happy to answer any
 
02:35:16.710 --> 02:35:16.720 align:start position:0%
questions i know our materials have the
 
02:35:18.790 --> 02:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
other required communications they're
 
02:35:20.630 --> 02:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
just our standard representation letters
 
02:35:22.230 --> 02:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
engagement letters that we work with
 
02:35:24.630 --> 02:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
steve monican team but uh nothing of
 
02:35:26.630 --> 02:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
note all in line with what you'd expect
 
02:35:29.190 --> 02:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
and probably seen before
 
02:35:32.389 --> 02:35:32.399 align:start position:0%
well i'm happy that our 529 account yes
 
02:35:34.230 --> 02:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
and accounts are in
 
02:35:36.630 --> 02:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
in good shape it's uh
 
02:35:39.110 --> 02:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
and yeah and i also didn't realize i
 
02:35:43.030 --> 02:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
knew that we had a large 529 program but
 
02:35:45.750 --> 02:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
i didn't realize we were fourth
 
02:35:48.550 --> 02:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:50.790 --> 02:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
in the us i think we are we're the
 
02:35:53.349 --> 02:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
fourth largest in the country yeah um
 
02:35:56.950 --> 02:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
feel the largest are um virginia nevada
 
02:35:58.150 --> 02:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
new york
 
02:35:58.160 --> 02:35:59.030 align:start position:0%
new york
um

02:35:59.030 --> 02:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:01.670 --> 02:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
we're behind them but okay
 
02:36:02.870 --> 02:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
that just
 
02:36:04.870 --> 02:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
yeah that just um
 
02:36:07.910 --> 02:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
really speaks to the quality of our
 
02:36:10.389 --> 02:36:10.399 align:start position:0%
our 529 program and
 
02:36:12.309 --> 02:36:12.319 align:start position:0%

02:37:53.670 --> 02:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
determine whether the cclu's licensing
 
02:37:55.910 --> 02:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
functions were efficient and effective
 
02:37:59.510 --> 02:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
during fiscal years 2018 to 2021
 
02:38:01.750 --> 02:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
and our executive summary starts on page
 
02:38:01.760 --> 02:38:03.429 align:start position:0%
and our executive summary starts on page
one

02:38:03.429 --> 02:38:03.439 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:38:05.349 --> 02:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
we found the cclu was generally
 
02:38:07.190 --> 02:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
effective in helping to ensure child
 
02:38:08.710 --> 02:38:08.720 align:start position:0%
care programs in new hampshire were
 
02:38:11.270 --> 02:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
compliant with licensing requirements it
 
02:38:13.110 --> 02:38:13.120 align:start position:0%
was also responsive to the child care
 
02:38:16.070 --> 02:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
programs it oversaw almost 90 percent of
 
02:38:17.750 --> 02:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
child care programs responding to our
 
02:38:20.309 --> 02:38:20.319 align:start position:0%
survey reported cclu staff were
 
02:38:23.270 --> 02:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
professional knowledgeable fair and
 
02:38:23.280 --> 02:38:25.510 align:start position:0%
professional knowledgeable fair and
responsive

02:38:25.510 --> 02:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
responsive
 
02:38:27.349 --> 02:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
as shown in our recommendation summary
 
02:38:30.150 --> 02:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
on page three our report contains eight
 
02:38:32.550 --> 02:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
observations with recommendations to
 
02:38:34.710 --> 02:38:34.720 align:start position:0%
increase the cclu's efficiency and
 
02:38:36.550 --> 02:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
ensure and ensure it continues to
 
02:38:38.630 --> 02:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
operate effectively
 
02:38:40.630 --> 02:38:40.640 align:start position:0%
the cclu concurred with all eight
 
02:38:42.630 --> 02:38:42.640 align:start position:0%
observations require some legislative
 
02:38:42.640 --> 02:38:45.510 align:start position:0%
observations require some legislative
action

02:38:45.510 --> 02:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:47.590 --> 02:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
our first three observations addressed
 
02:38:47.600 --> 02:38:48.790 align:start position:0%
our first three observations addressed
timeliness

02:38:48.790 --> 02:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
timeliness
 
02:38:51.030 --> 02:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
we found the cclu processed initial
 
02:38:53.190 --> 02:38:53.200 align:start position:0%
permits quickly so that new child care
 
02:38:54.950 --> 02:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
programs could begin operating as soon
 
02:38:57.510 --> 02:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
as possible this was consistent with its
 
02:39:00.630 --> 02:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
priority of ensuring new programs opened
 
02:39:00.640 --> 02:39:01.750 align:start position:0%
priority of ensuring new programs opened
quickly

02:39:01.750 --> 02:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
02:39:03.990 --> 02:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
even during the combat 19 pandemic it
 
02:39:06.070 --> 02:39:06.080 align:start position:0%
processed permits 12 days faster than
 
02:39:08.070 --> 02:39:08.080 align:start position:0%
before the pandemic
 
02:39:09.830 --> 02:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
however it did not always convert
 
02:39:12.309 --> 02:39:12.319 align:start position:0%
permits to full licenses timely
 
02:39:14.150 --> 02:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
half of the permits we reviewed were not
 
02:39:16.150 --> 02:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
converted to full three-year licenses
 
02:39:18.309 --> 02:39:18.319 align:start position:0%
before the permit expired
 
02:39:20.389 --> 02:39:20.399 align:start position:0%
additionally less than 20 percent of the
 
02:39:22.309 --> 02:39:22.319 align:start position:0%
renewal licenses we renewed were
 
02:39:23.750 --> 02:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
processed within the time limits
 
02:39:25.990 --> 02:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
established in statute
 
02:39:28.150 --> 02:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
finally we found the cclu needed to
 
02:39:30.469 --> 02:39:30.479 align:start position:0%
improve its process to ensure programs
 
02:39:33.349 --> 02:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
filed their renewal applications timely
 
02:39:35.190 --> 02:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
but despite these shortcomings programs
 
02:39:36.950 --> 02:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
remained open to ensure children were
 
02:39:39.670 --> 02:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
not displaced while the cclu processed
 
02:39:39.680 --> 02:39:41.510 align:start position:0%
not displaced while the cclu processed
applications

02:39:41.510 --> 02:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
applications
 
02:39:43.270 --> 02:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
additional management oversight and some
 
02:39:45.990 --> 02:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
legislative action establishing specific
 
02:39:48.230 --> 02:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
application processing time frames could
 
02:39:50.309 --> 02:39:50.319 align:start position:0%
help the cclu be more efficient in
 
02:39:54.150 --> 02:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:56.870 --> 02:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
three of our observations numbers four
 
02:39:58.469 --> 02:39:58.479 align:start position:0%
five and seven
 
02:40:00.389 --> 02:40:00.399 align:start position:0%
discuss the cclu's oversight of
 
02:40:02.150 --> 02:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
licensing rules
 
02:40:04.469 --> 02:40:04.479 align:start position:0%
we found the cclu conducted unannounced
 
02:40:06.230 --> 02:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
visits to child care programs as
 
02:40:09.270 --> 02:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
required by federal law in fact 99 of
 
02:40:11.429 --> 02:40:11.439 align:start position:0%
the programs we reviewed received at
 
02:40:14.469 --> 02:40:14.479 align:start position:0%
least one unannounced visit each year
 
02:40:17.030 --> 02:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
however the cclu did not had not
 
02:40:18.710 --> 02:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
implemented a standardized tool for
 
02:40:21.030 --> 02:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
licensing coordinators to use when
 
02:40:23.110 --> 02:40:23.120 align:start position:0%
conducting annual visits risking some
 
02:40:25.349 --> 02:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
inconsistency although it is working
 
02:40:26.950 --> 02:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
towards one
 
02:40:29.190 --> 02:40:29.200 align:start position:0%
the cclu was also effective in ensuring
 
02:40:31.349 --> 02:40:31.359 align:start position:0%
programs corrected violations of
 
02:40:34.309 --> 02:40:34.319 align:start position:0%
critical rules before issuing licenses
 
02:40:35.910 --> 02:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
critical rules were those which were
 
02:40:37.910 --> 02:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
deemed most likely to jeopardize the
 
02:40:40.230 --> 02:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
health safety or well-being of children
 
02:40:41.910 --> 02:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
or the operations of the child care
 
02:40:43.510 --> 02:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
program itself
 
02:40:46.630 --> 02:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
however we found the cclu lacked needed
 
02:40:48.710 --> 02:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
a formal process to monitor the child
 
02:40:50.710 --> 02:40:50.720 align:start position:0%
care program's correct violations of
 
02:40:53.269 --> 02:40:53.279 align:start position:0%
non-critical rules as well as a process
 
02:40:54.950 --> 02:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
to track when corrective action plans
 
02:40:56.870 --> 02:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
were due
 
02:40:59.269 --> 02:40:59.279 align:start position:0%
our remaining two observations number
 
02:41:01.429 --> 02:41:01.439 align:start position:0%
six and eight address improvements to
 
02:41:02.950 --> 02:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
the background check process and
 
02:41:05.030 --> 02:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
strengthening data collection to help
 
02:41:08.550 --> 02:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
management evaluate cclu's performance
 
02:41:10.550 --> 02:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
our report also contains two other
 
02:41:12.710 --> 02:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
issues and concerns that did not rise to
 
02:41:14.950 --> 02:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
the level of an observation but cclu
 
02:41:17.030 --> 02:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
management may want to consider
 
02:41:19.110 --> 02:41:19.120 align:start position:0%
these include reviewing the process for
 
02:41:20.710 --> 02:41:20.720 align:start position:0%
making employment eligibility
 
02:41:22.950 --> 02:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
determinations for some child care
 
02:41:24.790 --> 02:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
workers who previously lived outside of
 
02:41:25.910 --> 02:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
02:41:27.750 --> 02:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
and establishing a process to track the
 
02:41:32.630 --> 02:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:34.309 --> 02:41:34.319 align:start position:0%
our report also contains some
 
02:41:36.309 --> 02:41:36.319 align:start position:0%
information on the state of the child
 
02:41:38.469 --> 02:41:38.479 align:start position:0%
care industry this chapter starts on
 
02:41:40.309 --> 02:41:40.319 align:start position:0%
page 11.
 
02:41:42.230 --> 02:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
in this section we provide a map showing
 
02:41:44.790 --> 02:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
licensed child care capacity by me by
 
02:41:48.710 --> 02:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
municipality as of june 30th 2021 the
 
02:41:50.469 --> 02:41:50.479 align:start position:0%
map shows areas where there are high
 
02:41:52.550 --> 02:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
concentrations of child licensed child
 
02:41:54.950 --> 02:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
care spaces in dark blue while areas
 
02:41:56.790 --> 02:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
where there are no licensed child care
 
02:41:59.910 --> 02:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
spaces in dark red
 
02:42:03.990 --> 02:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
you can also see on table 2 on page 13.
 
02:42:05.590 --> 02:42:05.600 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
02:42:07.750 --> 02:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
when you say there are no beds avail no
 
02:42:07.760 --> 02:42:10.950 align:start position:0%
when you say there are no beds avail no
beds

02:42:10.950 --> 02:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:13.110 --> 02:42:13.120 align:start position:0%
no spaces available
 
02:42:15.510 --> 02:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
does that mean they have child care but
 
02:42:17.349 --> 02:42:17.359 align:start position:0%
it's just not
 
02:42:17.359 --> 02:42:19.349 align:start position:0%
it's just not
open

02:42:19.349 --> 02:42:19.359 align:start position:0%
open
 
02:42:21.990 --> 02:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
you just don't have slots for people no
 
02:42:23.830 --> 02:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
that means that there are no licensed
 
02:42:26.710 --> 02:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
child care facility spaces in that town
 
02:42:29.030 --> 02:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
so there may be license exempt
 
02:42:31.190 --> 02:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
facilities which we didn't look at but
 
02:42:34.230 --> 02:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
those areas in red have no child care
 
02:42:34.240 --> 02:42:36.469 align:start position:0%
those areas in red have no child care
programs

02:42:36.469 --> 02:42:36.479 align:start position:0%
programs
 
02:42:39.429 --> 02:42:39.439 align:start position:0%
that's very scary
 
02:42:41.510 --> 02:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
02:42:44.710 --> 02:42:44.720 align:start position:0%
you can also see in table two on page 13
 
02:42:46.389 --> 02:42:46.399 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire had a net loss in the
 
02:42:48.230 --> 02:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
number of child care programs of about
 
02:42:50.630 --> 02:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
three percent each year or total of nine
 
02:42:52.950 --> 02:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
percent during the entire audit period
 
02:42:55.190 --> 02:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
however the loss of licensed child care
 
02:42:57.590 --> 02:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
spaces wasn't as dramatic it wasn't as
 
02:42:57.600 --> 02:42:58.950 align:start position:0%
spaces wasn't as dramatic it wasn't as
drastic

02:42:58.950 --> 02:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
drastic
 
02:43:01.830 --> 02:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
if you look at table 4 on page 15 you'll
 
02:43:04.870 --> 02:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
see that from fiscal years 2018 to 2019
 
02:43:07.030 --> 02:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
the state actually had a net gain
 
02:43:09.590 --> 02:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
in licensed child care spaces the same
 
02:43:13.830 --> 02:43:13.840 align:start position:0%
was true for fiscal years 2019 to 2020.
 
02:43:15.510 --> 02:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
the only time period new hampshire had a
 
02:43:17.429 --> 02:43:17.439 align:start position:0%
net loss in child care spaces was
 
02:43:20.710 --> 02:43:20.720 align:start position:0%
between fiscal years 2020 and 2021
 
02:43:22.150 --> 02:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
during the height of the covet 19
 
02:43:22.160 --> 02:43:23.750 align:start position:0%
during the height of the covet 19
pandemic

02:43:23.750 --> 02:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
02:43:25.670 --> 02:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
the actual impact on the number of child
 
02:43:28.070 --> 02:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
care spaces is still unclear
 
02:43:29.670 --> 02:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
even though the number of licensed child
 
02:43:31.910 --> 02:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
care spaces did not change drastically
 
02:43:33.910 --> 02:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
child care programs
 
02:43:35.990 --> 02:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
who responded to our survey indicated
 
02:43:38.150 --> 02:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
they were operating at about 20 percent
 
02:43:41.349 --> 02:43:41.359 align:start position:0%
below their licensed capacity
 
02:43:43.349 --> 02:43:43.359 align:start position:0%
as child care supply and demand begin to
 
02:43:45.750 --> 02:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
stabilize in the state the cclu will
 
02:43:48.870 --> 02:43:48.880 align:start position:0%
have to continue to review its processes
 
02:43:52.070 --> 02:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
and adjust its practices
 
02:43:53.990 --> 02:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
this concludes my presentation i'd like
 
02:43:56.070 --> 02:43:56.080 align:start position:0%
to thank the cclu staff for their help
 
02:43:58.070 --> 02:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
during the audit and i'll turn it over
 
02:44:02.710 --> 02:44:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:05.190 --> 02:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you thank you madam
 
02:44:07.269 --> 02:44:07.279 align:start position:0%
chair members of the committee um i want
 
02:44:10.070 --> 02:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
to first thank the audit team for their
 
02:44:13.590 --> 02:44:13.600 align:start position:0%
work i really have appreciated their
 
02:44:16.309 --> 02:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
collaboration and cooperation as they
 
02:44:18.230 --> 02:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
come as they came in and requested our
 
02:44:20.630 --> 02:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
records and reviewed everything and made
 
02:44:22.870 --> 02:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
these observations we concurred with
 
02:44:25.510 --> 02:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
everything that they found we recognized
 
02:44:27.269 --> 02:44:27.279 align:start position:0%
that we do need to strengthen some of
 
02:44:29.750 --> 02:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
our policies and procedures some of that
 
02:44:31.990 --> 02:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
is due to the fact that i have worked in
 
02:44:33.750 --> 02:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
the child care licensing unit for 20
 
02:44:36.230 --> 02:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
years the supervisors i have under me
 
02:44:37.990 --> 02:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
have been there 14 years or longer as
 
02:44:40.070 --> 02:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
has our office staff so much of our
 
02:44:43.349 --> 02:44:43.359 align:start position:0%
policies and procedures are probably not
 
02:44:45.269 --> 02:44:45.279 align:start position:0%
written down as well and as clearly as
 
02:44:47.429 --> 02:44:47.439 align:start position:0%
they should be there it's institutional
 
02:44:49.190 --> 02:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
knowledge is that we've had because we
 
02:44:50.950 --> 02:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
have such a long-term staff in our
 
02:44:52.870 --> 02:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
office so we are definitely working on
 
02:44:55.510 --> 02:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
remedying that situation we recognize
 
02:44:57.510 --> 02:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
the need to do that as well and we
 
02:45:00.309 --> 02:45:00.319 align:start position:0%
certainly look forward to implementing
 
02:45:02.309 --> 02:45:02.319 align:start position:0%
what has been recommended as we move
 
02:45:04.950 --> 02:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
forward so we can improve our efficiency
 
02:45:06.469 --> 02:45:06.479 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to answer any questions
 
02:45:07.990 --> 02:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
you have
 
02:45:11.429 --> 02:45:11.439 align:start position:0%
well it's uh it's very nice to
 
02:45:14.870 --> 02:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
to see that
 
02:45:17.990 --> 02:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
child care is not falling apart like we
 
02:45:19.429 --> 02:45:19.439 align:start position:0%
thought it would be
 
02:45:21.349 --> 02:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
and maybe it is but we just don't
 
02:45:22.790 --> 02:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
realize it
 
02:45:22.800 --> 02:45:24.230 align:start position:0%
realize it
yet

02:45:24.230 --> 02:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
yet
 
02:45:27.590 --> 02:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
with uh you know closers and
 
02:45:27.600 --> 02:45:28.950 align:start position:0%
with uh you know closers and
get the

02:45:28.950 --> 02:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
get the
 
02:45:31.110 --> 02:45:31.120 align:start position:0%
percentage but really i thank you for
 
02:45:33.830 --> 02:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
all of the work that uh that you do in
 
02:45:37.190 --> 02:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
this and uh i am familiar with uh
 
02:45:38.790 --> 02:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
your inspections and they're very
 
02:45:42.150 --> 02:45:42.160 align:start position:0%
thorough and as they should be so are
 
02:45:43.990 --> 02:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
there any other questions yes
 
02:45:45.830 --> 02:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
representative emerick
 
02:45:47.590 --> 02:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
nope you turned yourself off thank you
 
02:45:49.349 --> 02:45:49.359 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
02:45:52.469 --> 02:45:52.479 align:start position:0%
i was stunned when i read this on page
 
02:45:55.429 --> 02:45:55.439 align:start position:0%
one in the first paragraph it says there
 
02:45:59.190 --> 02:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
are over 1 000 licensing rules
 
02:46:02.070 --> 02:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
how can keep anyone keep track of a
 
02:46:03.830 --> 02:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
thousand rules
 
02:46:05.910 --> 02:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
so um thank you for that question and
 
02:46:08.309 --> 02:46:08.319 align:start position:0%
it's a it's an eye opening one i
 
02:46:10.230 --> 02:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely understand that when you look
 
02:46:11.750 --> 02:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
at the child care licensing rules and
 
02:46:13.349 --> 02:46:13.359 align:start position:0%
how they're laid out
 
02:46:15.670 --> 02:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
they are laid out are the rules section
 
02:46:17.230 --> 02:46:17.240 align:start position:0%
is hec
 
02:46:20.309 --> 02:46:20.319 align:start position:0%
4002 so when you look at any rules in
 
02:46:22.950 --> 02:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
that section they are often say
 
02:46:25.750 --> 02:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
hcc 40204
 
02:46:27.190 --> 02:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
letter a
 
02:46:29.429 --> 02:46:29.439 align:start position:0%
number one
 
02:46:31.990 --> 02:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
um roman numeral one so they're broken
 
02:46:34.630 --> 02:46:34.640 align:start position:0%
up so that they're very specific
 
02:46:36.870 --> 02:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
so it looks like a thousand rules but
 
02:46:40.630 --> 02:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
they may have an overall subject such as
 
02:46:42.550 --> 02:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
the physic the registration form needs
 
02:46:44.630 --> 02:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
to contain the following items so the
 
02:46:47.349 --> 02:46:47.359 align:start position:0%
registration form has like 19 items we
 
02:46:50.950 --> 02:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
require so it's 19 rules so it's it's
 
02:46:53.030 --> 02:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
still a lot we are working with the new
 
02:46:55.670 --> 02:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
rule that we have um we have submitted
 
02:46:58.870 --> 02:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
to um ols and it is under review
 
02:47:00.950 --> 02:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
hopefully soon by um joint legislative
 
02:47:02.790 --> 02:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
committee on administrative rules we
 
02:47:04.870 --> 02:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
have done our best to condense them we
 
02:47:08.070 --> 02:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
have created more sections but fewer
 
02:47:10.790 --> 02:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
rules so we are working towards that
 
02:47:12.790 --> 02:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
we we completely understand it but
 
02:47:14.389 --> 02:47:14.399 align:start position:0%
that's it was just a stunning number
 
02:47:16.389 --> 02:47:16.399 align:start position:0%
that's all and some of that just has to
 
02:47:17.590 --> 02:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
do with how
 
02:47:19.190 --> 02:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
previous rules when they were written
 
02:47:20.870 --> 02:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
they were laid out so they were very
 
02:47:23.670 --> 02:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
specific such as name date of birth
 
02:47:26.870 --> 02:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
address like that's could be you know 19
 
02:47:28.389 --> 02:47:28.399 align:start position:0%
rules just for that one registration
 
02:47:32.070 --> 02:47:32.080 align:start position:0%
form okay thank you sure thank you
 
02:47:35.590 --> 02:47:35.600 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
02:47:38.070 --> 02:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much and thank you

is um
 
02:49:31.429 --> 02:49:31.439 align:start position:0%
i don't know if any of you have looked
 
02:49:34.469 --> 02:49:34.479 align:start position:0%
at this streaming youtube video
 
02:49:36.070 --> 02:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
but there are
 
02:49:37.910 --> 02:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
closed captions
 
02:49:40.950 --> 02:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
on the um
 
02:49:42.070 --> 02:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
on the
 
02:49:42.080 --> 02:49:43.670 align:start position:0%
on the
screen

02:49:43.670 --> 02:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
screen
 
02:49:47.269 --> 02:49:47.279 align:start position:0%
and you need to remember to truly
 
02:49:47.279 --> 02:49:49.030 align:start position:0%
and you need to remember to truly
enunciate

02:49:49.030 --> 02:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
enunciate
 
02:49:50.790 --> 02:49:50.800 align:start position:0%
very clearly
 
02:49:55.670 --> 02:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:58.630 --> 02:49:58.640 align:start position:0%
there are some embarrassing things that
 
02:49:59.990 --> 02:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
show up
 
02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:00.790 align:start position:0%
show up
on

02:50:00.790 --> 02:50:00.800 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:50:02.389 --> 02:50:02.399 align:start position:0%
the scrolling
 
02:50:02.399 --> 02:50:03.110 align:start position:0%
the scrolling
so

02:50:03.110 --> 02:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:50:04.950 --> 02:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
i should have mentioned that
 
02:50:07.590 --> 02:50:07.600 align:start position:0%
at the beginning and i didn't but
 
02:50:10.309 --> 02:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
i will mention it at the end so that
 
02:50:12.870 --> 02:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
next time we're in a session like this
 
02:50:14.469 --> 02:50:14.479 align:start position:0%
we will uh
 
02:50:17.030 --> 02:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
try to remember to enunciate no don't
 
02:50:17.990 --> 02:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
that way we'll have some good
 
02:50:20.309 --> 02:50:20.319 align:start position:0%
entertainment yeah
 
02:50:22.950 --> 02:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't i don't think we need that
 
02:50:25.910 --> 02:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
all right is there any further business
 
02:50:32.309 --> 02:50:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:14.630 --> 02:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:14.640 --> 02:51:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
you
