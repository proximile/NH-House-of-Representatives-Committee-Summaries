today I think a little differently than
 
00:05:34.309 --> 00:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
the past is either to recommend for
 
00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:39.039 align:start position:0%
future or to not recommend for future
 
00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:42.039 align:start position:0%
legislation um I'd like to recognize

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
not recommend for future legislation
 
00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:27.199 align:start position:0%
discussion I've I've been told that that
 
00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:29.720 align:start position:0%
this legislation's being entered again
 
00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
you know anyways at this point in time
 
00:06:34.749 --> 00:06:34.759 align:start position:0%
for the next session so good luck with
 
00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:40.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.790 align:start position:0%
 
Madam

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:41.800 align:start position:0%
Madam
 
00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
yes for for discussion I think no matter
 
00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
what the topic is my opinion is that
 
00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:52.520 align:start position:0%
it's poor legislation poor governance if
 
00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:54.639 align:start position:0%
you say no no matter what it is we're
 
00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
not going to ever do it um things happen
 
00:07:00.869 --> 00:07:00.879 align:start position:0%
good things bad things unexpected one
 
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:03.080 align:start position:0%
way or the other and uh so I I just
 
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
think it's poor legislation poor
 
00:07:08.029 --> 00:07:08.039 align:start position:0%
governance to have any legislation that
 
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
is a blanket say no to a um to something
 
00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:14.720 align:start position:0%

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
contain electric vehicle EV charging
 
00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
infrastructure with that I will
 
00:09:14.829 --> 00:09:14.839 align:start position:0%
recognize representative Boyd Mr
 
00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:17.000 align:start position:0%
chairman as a relates to House Bill 606
 
00:09:20.269 --> 00:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
FN I move not to
 
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:22.360 align:start position:0%
recommend motion's been made and
 
00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:26.150 align:start position:0%
recommend motion's been made and
seconded

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
discussion Mr chairman uh I like the
 
00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
principle of this bill and I've talked
 
00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:32.360 align:start position:0%
with the prime sponsor but I think it's
 
00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:34.360 align:start position:0%
too broad it talks about apartment
 
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:36.160 align:start position:0%
buildings and it talks about State
 
00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
construction projects I personally would
 
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
like to and I express my I'm willing to
 
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
work with a prime sponsor if you want on
 
00:09:45.829 --> 00:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
maybe a SE a separate bill or even two
 
00:09:48.389 --> 00:09:48.399 align:start position:0%
separate bills it's just too broad the
 
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
way it's written but it's I I in
 
00:09:53.389 --> 00:09:53.399 align:start position:0%
principle I I have nothing against EVS
 
00:09:55.949 --> 00:09:55.959 align:start position:0%
but I'm going to vote to vote to not
 
00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
recommend based on the way it's written
 
00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
thank you hey uh
 
00:10:04.509 --> 00:10:04.519 align:start position:0%
yes I'm also in favor of the bill and
 
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
concept but I recognize that it's not
 
00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:10.160 align:start position:0%
likely to get much support the way it's
 
00:10:12.509 --> 00:10:12.519 align:start position:0%
structured and that we shouldn't be
 
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
spending the time spinning our wheels on
 
00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:18.200 align:start position:0%
it so I I agree with representative cler
 
00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:19.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative pner any
 
00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.829 align:start position:0%
thank you representative pner any
further

00:10:21.829 --> 00:10:21.839 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
please thank you Mr chairman um
 
00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:32.720 align:start position:0%
as putting the EV charging
 
00:10:34.829 --> 00:10:34.839 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in a lot of apartments
 
00:10:38.509 --> 00:10:38.519 align:start position:0%
and stuff as it was been mentioned as
 
00:10:41.829 --> 00:10:41.839 align:start position:0%
we're looking at trying to create also
 
00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
affordable apartment
 
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
rentals uh adding cost that someone in
 
00:10:52.069 --> 00:10:52.079 align:start position:0%
that framework of looking for affordable
 
00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
housing is not going to be buying
 
00:10:58.350 --> 00:10:58.360 align:start position:0%
$100,000 EV so with that in mind we must
 
00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:02.240 align:start position:0%
move carefully as we're trying to create
 
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
affordable housing and apartment rentals
 
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
and also requiring more regulations to
 
00:11:12.949 --> 00:11:12.959 align:start position:0%
add cost so please be cautious about
 
00:11:14.829 --> 00:11:14.839 align:start position:0%
that okay thank you representative
 
00:11:14.839 --> 00:11:16.350 align:start position:0%
that okay thank you representative
represent

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:16.360 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:20.360 align:start position:0%
fuler just couldn't help but take the
 
00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:22.760 align:start position:0%
bait I don't
 
00:11:25.389 --> 00:11:25.399 align:start position:0%
Eevee I'm very happy with it I paid
 
00:11:28.509 --> 00:11:28.519 align:start position:0%
$27,000 for it and there certainly are
 
00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
more and more used EVS now so it's not
 
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
just the high-end Market anymore and
 
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
we're now at 7 or 8% of the of the
 
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
market and and in growing
 
00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
so some of the past assumptions based
 
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
upon the early
 
00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:48.200 align:start position:0%
uh early entries into the EV Market
 
00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:49.720 align:start position:0%
aren't going to hold up much longer so
 
00:11:52.269 --> 00:11:52.279 align:start position:0%
I've just wanted to okay thank you put
 
00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:54.680 align:start position:0%
that in any any further
 
00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:57.200 align:start position:0%

our our third piece is House Bill 488 FN
 
00:13:07.389 --> 00:13:07.399 align:start position:0%
relative to Hazard mitigation funding I
 
00:13:09.949 --> 00:13:09.959 align:start position:0%
recognize representative
 
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
Mills Mr chair I vote I I recommend not
 
00:13:18.189 --> 00:13:18.199 align:start position:0%
recommended for future legislation
 
00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:20.920 align:start position:0%
seconded motions made and seconded is
 
00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:22.430 align:start position:0%
seconded motions made and seconded is
there

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
discussion yes yes yes with all due
 
00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:29.240 align:start position:0%
respect to everybody here I plan to vote
 
00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:32.120 align:start position:0%
against the motion of not recommend and
 
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
the reason why I'm voting against it we
 
00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
we have had a problem over in my neck of
 
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
the woods Sullivan County maybe chesher
 
00:13:40.949 --> 00:13:40.959 align:start position:0%
County and one of the communities I
 
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
represent in addition to Claremont is
 
00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:45.800 align:start position:0%
cin and last summer and I think again
 
00:13:48.509 --> 00:13:48.519 align:start position:0%
this past summer there were heavy rains
 
00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
which flooded out a lot of cin a lot of
 
00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
aworth which rep the prime sponsor comes
 
00:13:56.629 --> 00:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
from and other communities and I think
 
00:13:59.269 --> 00:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor made an attempt to try
 
00:14:01.189 --> 00:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
to rectify this is trying to make to
 
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:04.240 align:start position:0%
make Rectify this situation A Hazard
 
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
mitigation fund would maybe prevent some
 
00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
of these disasters from happening again
 
00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
and I realize it's it's not a lot of
 
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:13.880 align:start position:0%
money but I think we begin begin need to
 
00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
do something to address this issue again
 
00:14:17.829 --> 00:14:17.839 align:start position:0%
and I believe she's going to introduce
 
00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:20.360 align:start position:0%
the same bill again but I think in good
 
00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:22.680 align:start position:0%
conscience when I'm voting against this
 
00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to represent my cin
 
00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
constituents thank you thank you m thank
 
00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
you represent cluder I I will just add
 
00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:33.880 align:start position:0%
to that that U uh many of us have had
 
00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:37.240 align:start position:0%
these terrible events and continuously
 
00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
having these events and I think I think
 
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
my misgiving on this is that it was a
 
00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
bill involving funding and coming in on
 
00:14:48.069 --> 00:14:48.079 align:start position:0%
on a non-budget year so I'm glad they're
 
00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:50.360 align:start position:0%
going to bring the conversation and LSR
 
00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:52.360 align:start position:0%
forward and I think the appropriate
 
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
places in the new budget any other yes
 
00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
please thank you Mr chair uh I'd also
 
00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
like to add that when you look at the
 
00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:02.720 align:start position:0%
bill and what the cost would be of they
 
00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:04.120 align:start position:0%
estimated at
 
00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:06.920 align:start position:0%
400,000 and that the payouts to the
 
00:15:09.389 --> 00:15:09.399 align:start position:0%
given towns would they have some real
 
00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
surveyor problems it's only 50 Grand
 
00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
that uh the concept I think is good but
 
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
the uh disproportionate payout for the
 
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
for what it cost is at this point I
 
00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:23.000 align:start position:0%
think is not wise thank youer further
 
00:15:24.749 --> 00:15:24.759 align:start position:0%
question further
 
00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:27.839 align:start position:0%

Bill
 
00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:41.800 align:start position:0%
1547 requiring mileage based exit
 
00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:45.480 align:start position:0%
numbers on tier one highways and I will
 
00:16:48.389 --> 00:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
recognize representative Boyd Mr
 
00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you as it relates to
 
00:16:54.069 --> 00:16:54.079 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1547 I move to not
 
00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
recommend motions made not to recommend
 
00:16:59.389 --> 00:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
is there a second second
 
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
second by Mills um
 
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
discussion yes represent
 
00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
fuler uh recognize that this isn't
 
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
necessarily a bad idea it's just
 
00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
something that should be taken up as
 
00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:16.120 align:start position:0%
part of the uh Highway Transportation
 
00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:20.079 align:start position:0%
10year plan then I think this was
 
00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:22.520 align:start position:0%
uh wrong bill at the wrong time and
 
00:17:23.949 --> 00:17:23.959 align:start position:0%
we'll deal with the you Department in
 
00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
terms of where that fits in
 
00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:27.880 align:start position:0%
priority thank you I concur with your
 
00:17:30.909 --> 00:17:30.919 align:start position:0%
comment clud yeah is there someone from
 
00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:34.520 align:start position:0%
do here for a question by any chance I
 
00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
think we have three all right okay uh
 
00:17:39.789 --> 00:17:39.799 align:start position:0%
just the question is there about a
 
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
mandate to do this and if so what year
 
00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:57.430 align:start position:0%
 
it

00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:59.590 --> 00:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
button thank you Mr chairman members of
 
00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
Bill oldenberg I'm the director of
 
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:04.720 align:start position:0%
project development for New Hampshire
 
00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:08.200 align:start position:0%
dot um the
 
00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:11.480 align:start position:0%
requirement to do this the exit sign
 
00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
numbering was part of the mutcd update
 
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
starting in
 
00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
2009 where it was required or well it
 
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.029 align:start position:0%
2009 where it was required or well it
was

00:18:23.029 --> 00:18:23.039 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:26.120 align:start position:0%
recommended um but in the the last
 
00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:29.240 align:start position:0%
update in 2014
 
00:18:30.549 --> 00:18:30.559 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
required um and
 
00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:36.440 align:start position:0%
just bit of History we have put in a
 
00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
bill or put in a a project in the
 
00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
10-year plan um since then we've gone
 
00:18:46.669 --> 00:18:46.679 align:start position:0%
through six cycles and um that that
 
00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
project in the 10year plan has been
 
00:18:51.549 --> 00:18:51.559 align:start position:0%
removed either by the governor or
 
00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
through the gaset
 
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
process thank you follow up uh yes if we
 
00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:01.640 align:start position:0%
don't do this is there will we lose
 
00:19:03.149 --> 00:19:03.159 align:start position:0%
Federal Highway
 
00:19:07.149 --> 00:19:07.159 align:start position:0%
funds there's the potential um but right
 
00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:09.080 align:start position:0%
now it's it's
 
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
a they they note that we we don't comply
 
00:19:17.549 --> 00:19:17.559 align:start position:0%
they ask what we do and they accept um
 
00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:20.200 align:start position:0%
currently they accept the fact that the
 
00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:24.520 align:start position:0%
our legislative process either e either
 
00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:27.080 align:start position:0%
um through the house or through the
 
00:19:29.149 --> 00:19:29.159 align:start position:0%
governor or through the the asset
 
00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:32.600 align:start position:0%
process we are unable to to to do this
 
00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
so they accept that um right now um ma
 
00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
majority of the state
 
00:19:42.149 --> 00:19:42.159 align:start position:0%
so a little bit more history is most of
 
00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
the country does exits by mile post
 
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
marker um New England was was basically
 
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
the loan hold out that did it
 
00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
consecutive numbering system like we
 
00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
still have the the group of states that
 
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
are have consecutive mile marker or mile
 
00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
exit numbers is slowly
 
00:20:04.669 --> 00:20:04.679 align:start position:0%
dwindling um and soon it'll be will be
 
00:20:07.789 --> 00:20:07.799 align:start position:0%
the last one standing I think um so
 
00:20:09.549 --> 00:20:09.559 align:start position:0%
that's where I think the spotlight might
 
00:20:12.669 --> 00:20:12.679 align:start position:0%
come on us so thank you president bar do
 
00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:14.200 align:start position:0%
you have a question are you satisfied
 
00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:17.480 align:start position:0%
represent FL here uh yes thank you res B
 
00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:22.280 align:start position:0%
please thank you uh I've noticed on 93
 
00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
on the south end headed towards uh
 
00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts that we're building a new
 
00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:29.400 align:start position:0%
bridge or it's almost completed and
 
00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:32.440 align:start position:0%
we're putting a new exit in uh out of
 
00:20:34.909 --> 00:20:34.919 align:start position:0%
curiosity with our numbering system The
 
00:20:37.789 --> 00:20:37.799 align:start position:0%
Way It Is What would be the number for
 
00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
this new entrance exit ramp on to 93
 
00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:44.200 align:start position:0%
it's going to be called Exit 4
 
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
a but under the the new mile post marker
 
00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:49.720 align:start position:0%
it would
 
00:20:53.549 --> 00:20:53.559 align:start position:0%
be um I think I wrote that down actually
 
00:20:57.909 --> 00:20:57.919 align:start position:0%
no I didn't somewhere around 145
 
00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
00:21:01.789 --> 00:21:01.799 align:start position:0%
all right thankk you you all you settled
 
00:21:04.029 --> 00:21:04.039 align:start position:0%
there you all set representative all

boy second Mr thank you so we we're
 
00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:28.799 align:start position:0%
ready to uh call just one further thing
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
chairman what would that be Mr uh okay
 
00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
the bill is written there is no fiscal
 
00:21:35.149 --> 00:21:35.159 align:start position:0%
note in the bill so even if the state
 
00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:37.000 align:start position:0%
would say we were going to do this and I
 
00:21:38.549 --> 00:21:38.559 align:start position:0%
would prefer the feds do it if they're
 
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
mandating what's the cost of doing this
 
00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:45.400 align:start position:0%
and also it says not until 2035 uh I I
 
00:21:47.789 --> 00:21:47.799 align:start position:0%
don't know by 2035 what the cost of this
 
00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
will be for the feds or for us we don't
 
00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:51.880 align:start position:0%
know with inflation so I have some real
 
00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:53.960 align:start position:0%
concerns about this and the way I'm on
 
00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
the study commission and we've got to uh
 
00:21:58.710 --> 00:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
get more money for a highway fund so
 
00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:00.520 align:start position:0%
until we're until we're forced and if
 
00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
we're forced the feds better pay for it
 
00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
