morning it being 10: a.m.
 
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 align:start position:0%
like to call the meeting of Public Works
 
00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
and highways to
 
00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
order and we're going to start with
 
00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:10.039 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:13.560 align:start position:0%
375 and
 
00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
recognize main sponsor representative
 
00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
Maguire you're on sir thank you Mr
 
00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:21.400 align:start position:0%
chairman members of the committee for
 
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Dan Maguire I
 
00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:27.080 align:start position:0%
represent the town of Epsom so this bill
 
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
um just started as an idea that came to
 
00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:34.639 align:start position:0%
me when I saw how capable modern ATVs
 
00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:37.759 align:start position:0%
are and how really how expensive I mean
 
00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:40.360 align:start position:0%
some of them are $20,000 up so they're
 
00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:43.919 align:start position:0%
almost standard Vehicles right I mean
 
00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
and um they essentially all come with
 
00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
headlights and brake lights and so on um
 
00:06:53.309 --> 00:06:53.319 align:start position:0%
and and it seemed to me that it would
 
00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:57.080 align:start position:0%
sort of enhance um tourism if people
 
00:06:59.589 --> 00:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
were allowed to use them not just
 
00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:02.639 align:start position:0%
off-road but also onroad in some cases
 
00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:06.280 align:start position:0%
right so they can um go from their
 
00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:09.080 align:start position:0%
perhaps rental property to restaurants
 
00:07:12.309 --> 00:07:12.319 align:start position:0%
and stores and things like that and so I
 
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
started looking into the situation it
 
00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:16.520 align:start position:0%
turns out there's lots of other people
 
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
who were sort of there with that idea
 
00:07:21.189 --> 00:07:21.199 align:start position:0%
way way ahead of me and I discovered
 
00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:25.240 align:start position:0%
that this is already implemented in um
 
00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
the city of Berlin and also the town of
 
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
colbrook and Poss possibly others that I
 
00:07:33.589 --> 00:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
don't know of but but it's it is
 
00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:35.800 align:start position:0%
something that I've heard from uh the
 
00:07:38.309 --> 00:07:38.319 align:start position:0%
representatives from Berlin that it's
 
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
been a big boost to their Town's economy
 
00:07:45.749 --> 00:07:45.759 align:start position:0%
that that um uh they have designated uh
 
00:07:48.909 --> 00:07:48.919 align:start position:0%
town roads as being and and I believe
 
00:07:52.189 --> 00:07:52.199 align:start position:0%
some state roads as being capable of uh
 
00:07:54.909 --> 00:07:54.919 align:start position:0%
people driving their ATVs into town and
 
00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
so on and um it's caused a lot more um
 
00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:02.680 align:start position:0%
tourism in their area um more people
 
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
going to restaurants all this sort of
 
00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
stuff so they're they're very positive
 
00:08:09.469 --> 00:08:09.479 align:start position:0%
about it and so I thought that I would
 
00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:13.000 align:start position:0%
put in the bill just to I mean there's
 
00:08:14.909 --> 00:08:14.919 align:start position:0%
currently nothing in law as far as I can
 
00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:17.560 align:start position:0%
tell that allows it or disallows it or
 
00:08:20.149 --> 00:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
so on or gives it any structure so I
 
00:08:22.149 --> 00:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
thought I put in the bill so that our
 
00:08:25.469 --> 00:08:25.479 align:start position:0%
law would have kind of a you know ground
 
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
rules of how this is to be done um uh
 
00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:33.640 align:start position:0%
and and certain structure to it that
 
00:08:37.149 --> 00:08:37.159 align:start position:0%
towns can adopt it's all none of this is
 
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
mandatory it's just that if you want to
 
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
allow ATVs to to be used on your roads
 
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
this is the structure you would you
 
00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:49.000 align:start position:0%
would follow and so um I'm not wetted to
 
00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
any of the details in it if you think
 
00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
I'm gone over or under in some area and
 
00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:57.160 align:start position:0%
want to change things great you know
 
00:09:00.069 --> 00:09:00.079 align:start position:0%
this is really not you know I don't
 
00:09:02.509 --> 00:09:02.519 align:start position:0%
often put in bills in this area so you
 
00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
know my knowledge of it is is not that
 
00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
broad but um let me point out
 
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
specifically what it does so it
 
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
basically allows a municipality to
 
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
designate certain uh Section Road
 
00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:19.880 align:start position:0%
segments as as being you uh available
 
00:09:25.069 --> 00:09:25.079 align:start position:0%
for ATV travel and it um would require
 
00:09:29.069 --> 00:09:29.079 align:start position:0%
them to to make a map um both available
 
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
at town office and online of those areas
 
00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
it allows them if they want to to put up
 
00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:40.680 align:start position:0%
signs uh showing it it allows them to
 
00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
designate those um areas as having a
 
00:09:46.829 --> 00:09:46.839 align:start position:0%
certain seasonality so you know if you
 
00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:48.959 align:start position:0%
only want to do it in summer or only in
 
00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:51.880 align:start position:0%
Winter or not in mud season or whatever
 
00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:56.120 align:start position:0%
you can do you can do that um it uh
 
00:09:59.430 --> 00:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
requires that those sections of Road the
 
00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:01.640 align:start position:0%
way this is written it has a maximum
 
00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:04.600 align:start position:0%
speed limit of 40 m an hour now I have
 
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:07.000 align:start position:0%
in the back of my mind that I intended
 
00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:10.200 align:start position:0%
30 miles an hour so I don't remember I
 
00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
don't remember what Berlin actually does
 
00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:15.560 align:start position:0%
I think it might be 30 and not 40 but uh
 
00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
maybe you'll you'll find out about that
 
00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:20.600 align:start position:0%
but but anyways it's it's only for roads
 
00:10:23.069 --> 00:10:23.079 align:start position:0%
up to some speed limit you could change
 
00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
that if you wanted to and um the other
 
00:10:29.949 --> 00:10:29.959 align:start position:0%
thing it puts some restrictions on
 
00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
ATVs themselves and the and the most um
 
00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
the one you might want to think about is
 
00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:40.040 align:start position:0%
directional signals so so they have to
 
00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.949 align:start position:0%
directional signals so so they have to
have

00:10:41.949 --> 00:10:41.959 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:44.720 align:start position:0%
um uh they would have to have headlights
 
00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
tail lights brake lights I think that's
 
00:10:50.269 --> 00:10:50.279 align:start position:0%
already standard in the law um it adds
 
00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
here a horn emergency flashers and
 
00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
directional signals and my understanding
 
00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
is most are not manufactured with
 
00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
directional signals but those are an
 
00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:03.320 align:start position:0%
add-on that people can get if they want
 
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
to so I just thought for safety if
 
00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:08.600 align:start position:0%
you're driving these at night that's an
 
00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:10.760 align:start position:0%
important feature you might think
 
00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
otherwise so that that's the part that
 
00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:16.120 align:start position:0%
might be controversial um but other than
 
00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:18.680 align:start position:0%
that I'm I'm happy to answer
 
00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:20.680 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative
 
00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
McGuire representative
 
00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:25.000 align:start position:0%
fauler thank you Mr
 
00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:28.200 align:start position:0%
chairman um thank you for taking
 
00:11:31.069 --> 00:11:31.079 align:start position:0%
questions I
 
00:11:34.509 --> 00:11:34.519 align:start position:0%
drive a uh side by side which is
 
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
registered for travel on the uh on the
 
00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:40.600 align:start position:0%
roadways as an agricultural vehicle but
 
00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:42.040 align:start position:0%
it has different requirements and there
 
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
was a state state law that allows allows
 
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
that but uh doesn't include horns
 
00:11:50.269 --> 00:11:50.279 align:start position:0%
directional signals or flashers does
 
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:53.480 align:start position:0%
require lights requires
 
00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:56.120 align:start position:0%
mirrors and requires
 
00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
a slow vehicle triangle to you mounted
 
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
so is there an attempt to
 
00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
um I wonder if there's a conflict
 
00:12:09.949 --> 00:12:09.959 align:start position:0%
between one set of regulations for one
 
00:12:13.189 --> 00:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
vehicle looks very much like your your
 
00:12:13.199 --> 00:12:14.389 align:start position:0%
vehicle looks very much like your your
off-road

00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
off-road
 
00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:18.760 align:start position:0%
vehicles um and whether you
 
00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
really whether you considered the um
 
00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
that particular conflict yes thank you
 
00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:27.320 align:start position:0%
for the question my my intention is not
 
00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.150 align:start position:0%
for the question my my intention is not
to

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:32.440 align:start position:0%
be to get in the way of any existing use
 
00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
right so you talked about agricultural
 
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
so this is intended mostly to be to be
 
00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:41.000 align:start position:0%
on top of whatever people use the road
 
00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
for and the ways they use the road and
 
00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:47.240 align:start position:0%
um be more again for tourism or
 
00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:49.240 align:start position:0%
occasional use and and that kind of
 
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
thing um so I don't think there's
 
00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
necessarily a conflict because if you
 
00:12:58.230 --> 00:12:58.240 align:start position:0%
already have your agricultural plate and
 
00:12:59.949 --> 00:12:59.959 align:start position:0%
your you know other requirements and
 
00:13:01.949 --> 00:13:01.959 align:start position:0%
you're following those I don't think
 
00:13:06.949 --> 00:13:06.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
way I'm sorry any other
 
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
questions representative bogert thank
 
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman
 
00:13:20.189 --> 00:13:20.199 align:start position:0%
um along with the ATVs that are in
 
00:13:23.949 --> 00:13:23.959 align:start position:0%
modern day with this requirement uh golf
 
00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
carts seem to also be uh heading towards
 
00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
that way we're allow to cities and stuff
 
00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:33.560 align:start position:0%
or communities and stuff are allowing
 
00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
golf carts to be driven around like a
 
00:13:38.189 --> 00:13:38.199 align:start position:0%
car and they have all the same function
 
00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:41.000 align:start position:0%
and stuff would that also be something
 
00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:45.160 align:start position:0%
that is thought of I'm yes thank you for
 
00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
your question so I mean a golf cart is
 
00:13:51.509 --> 00:13:51.519 align:start position:0%
sort of a summer only vehicle right so
 
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
um I don't know it's quite
 
00:13:58.230 --> 00:13:58.240 align:start position:0%
as quite as likely to be wanted to be
 
00:14:02.949 --> 00:14:02.959 align:start position:0%
used in New Hampshire as ATVs right um
 
00:14:05.269 --> 00:14:05.279 align:start position:0%
but I I guess it would depend there's
 
00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:07.480 align:start position:0%
some there's a certain section of law
 
00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
here um RSA
 
00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.470 align:start position:0%
here um RSA
25-a

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
25-a
 
00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:15.720 align:start position:0%
colon4 which has specifications for what
 
00:14:18.189 --> 00:14:18.199 align:start position:0%
these kind of vehicles have and so I
 
00:14:21.829 --> 00:14:21.839 align:start position:0%
guess if a golf cart met that RSA then
 
00:14:24.829 --> 00:14:24.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:30.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:33.320 align:start position:0%
excuse me uh representative
 
00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
Brown thank you Mr chairman so on on
 
00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
line six on the bill the question I have
 
00:14:41.269 --> 00:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
is um I'm not un not sure what this
 
00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:43.240 align:start position:0%
exemption portion is here in line six
 
00:14:44.629 --> 00:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
where it says municipalities and the
 
00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
Bureau of trails are exempt from the
 
00:14:48.509 --> 00:14:48.519 align:start position:0%
permitting process and requirements of
 
00:14:51.749 --> 00:14:51.759 align:start position:0%

00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:56.360 align:start position:0%
so can you clarify that for me thank you
 
00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:58.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and I'm I
 
00:15:00.069 --> 00:15:00.079 align:start position:0%
don't think I can
 
00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
um I saw somebody from Bureau of trails
 
00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:04.720 align:start position:0%
here who might be able to answer that
 
00:15:06.829 --> 00:15:06.839 align:start position:0%
better um that's something the drafter
 
00:15:10.189 --> 00:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
put in and found so I I'd be happy to

NHD hi good morning for the record uh my
 
00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
name is alen hansom I'm the state
 
00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:26.240 align:start position:0%
maintenance engineer for the Hampshire
 
00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:27.560 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
Transportation um we have a a couple of
 
00:16:33.389 --> 00:16:33.399 align:start position:0%
um portions of the bill that that cause
 
00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
questions for for our agency um the
 
00:16:38.749 --> 00:16:38.759 align:start position:0%
first being the question that
 
00:16:42.389 --> 00:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
representative Brown posed regarding um
 
00:16:43.829 --> 00:16:43.839 align:start position:0%
municipalities and Bureau of Trail has
 
00:16:46.509 --> 00:16:46.519 align:start position:0%
been exempt from the permitting process
 
00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
um the permitting process is what we use
 
00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
in state agencies to authoriz to
 
00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:55.160 align:start position:0%
interact with with applicants and
 
00:16:56.629 --> 00:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
interact and
 
00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
uh um issue the authorization for the
 
00:17:04.789 --> 00:17:04.799 align:start position:0%
use if that is the end product of it um
 
00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:06.839 align:start position:0%
to uh to
 
00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:09.720 align:start position:0%
exempt um entities from the pering
 
00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:11.640 align:start position:0%
process kind of
 
00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:13.720 align:start position:0%
subverts what the department of TR
 
00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
Transportation does to uh to regulate
 
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
the highway so we question how that
 
00:17:19.949 --> 00:17:19.959 align:start position:0%
might work
 
00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
um um
 
00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.069 align:start position:0%
um um
in

00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:24.079 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:29.320 align:start position:0%
determining what happens and and uh um
 
00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
what the end result might be from from
 
00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:33.640 align:start position:0%
the request uh to use a certain section
 
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
of Road um so we would we would request
 
00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
that that be Revisited um and and the
 
00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
other comment that that we would offer
 
00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
is that we recommend the uh that they
 
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
follow the the requirements of RSA 215
 
00:17:52.669 --> 00:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
A6 um 9 which
 
00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:55.400 align:start position:0%
includes uh the requirement for public
 
00:17:58.870 --> 00:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
hearing um signage at the limits of the
 
00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
of the segments designated to um alert
 
00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
Road uses that they can expect ATV
 
00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:09.080 align:start position:0%
travel on the road as well as alert the
 
00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:12.760 align:start position:0%
ATV users of where they can can start
 
00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:15.240 align:start position:0%
using the road and and end using the
 
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
road um and uh imposing requirements on
 
00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:21.640 align:start position:0%
the Riders to uh to follow the
 
00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:24.510 align:start position:0%
the Riders to uh to follow the
regulations

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:24.520 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:28.120 align:start position:0%
um um that being said I think I uh open
 
00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:31.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:32.630 align:start position:0%
 
any

00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:35.480 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:18:37.669 --> 00:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
Malone thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:40.280 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so um can do
 
00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
you have any data on ATV uh safety in
 
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for for example just
 
00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:49.640 align:start position:0%
what's in particularly maybe on the
 
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
rates of accidents that ATVs have I I
 
00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:56.120 align:start position:0%
don't I I don't I don't do ATVs I do
 
00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
Highway Maintenance so I'm not I'm not
 
00:18:59.390 --> 00:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
familiar with uh
 
00:19:02.549 --> 00:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
with what um with a question that you're

follow please thank you so do you know
 
00:19:11.149 --> 00:19:11.159 align:start position:0%
where we to get that data um the the uh
 
00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:13.960 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies for ATV use which
 
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
would be um State Police and fishing
 
00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
game I think would be better suited to
 
00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:26.520 align:start position:0%

question

00:19:41.149 --> 00:19:41.159 align:start position:0%
question

you're over here in my blind
 
00:19:49.549 --> 00:19:49.559 align:start position:0%
spot thank you Mr chairman uh I was just
 
00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:52.520 align:start position:0%
curious if you could clarify because uh
 
00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:55.240 align:start position:0%
when you were speaking to that uh
 
00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
section one um and I didn't know if I
 
00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:02.600 align:start position:0%
quite understood what you were trying to
 
00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
make a point at for your recommendation
 
00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:07.400 align:start position:0%
for that
 
00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:11.240 align:start position:0%
section sure thank you um well as
 
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
written it says that the municip
 
00:20:15.029 --> 00:20:15.039 align:start position:0%
municipalities and Bureau of trails are
 
00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
exempt from the permitting Pro per
 
00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
permitting process sorry um regarding
 
00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:22.280 align:start position:0%
Bridge or connectors along the portion
 
00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:24.520 align:start position:0%
of the highway so the the connector is a
 
00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
trail along the along the
 
00:20:28.669 --> 00:20:28.679 align:start position:0%
roadside if they're exempt from the
 
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
pering process what
 
00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
determines um where where the where the
 
00:20:37.909 --> 00:20:37.919 align:start position:0%
travel is allowed um how are we alerted
 
00:20:40.909 --> 00:20:40.919 align:start position:0%
to it do we have an opportunity to
 
00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:45.880 align:start position:0%
review and approve it um this this says
 
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
that you know for instance the town can
 
00:20:51.149 --> 00:20:51.159 align:start position:0%
can determine a section of road to be
 
00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:54.280 align:start position:0%
open for ATV use but we're we're out of
 
00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
the picture so we not being involved in
 
00:20:59.390 --> 00:20:59.400 align:start position:0%
a permitting process
 
00:21:02.669 --> 00:21:02.679 align:start position:0%
um we're we're not aware of um the
 
00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
goings on and who's asking for what so I
 
00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
I don't know what I don't know what that
 
00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
what that means how how they would
 
00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
expect it to to operate so
 
00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
followup thank you Mr chairman so let's
 
00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
say an expressway went through a town
 
00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes they do and uh are you
 
00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:27.400 align:start position:0%
indicating that maybe not being able to
 
00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:30.440 align:start position:0%
be have a uh seat at the table they
 
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
could allow ATVs all of a sudden to be
 
00:21:36.269 --> 00:21:36.279 align:start position:0%
on an expressway for a short period of
 
00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
time and then come back off at at at
 
00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
Will based on the municipality only
 
00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
saying that they can do that I I believe
 
00:21:50.909 --> 00:21:50.919 align:start position:0%
that might be the result of this we we
 
00:21:50.919 --> 00:21:51.789 align:start position:0%
that might be the result of this we we
don't

00:21:51.789 --> 00:21:51.799 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
know um some some towns have interstate
 
00:21:59.710 --> 00:21:59.720 align:start position:0%
highway main throw fairs and back roads
 
00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
and um it's not
 
00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:03.750 align:start position:0%
and um it's not
clear

00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
clear
 
00:22:06.549 --> 00:22:06.559 align:start position:0%
um what uh what the guidelines would be
 
00:22:09.669 --> 00:22:09.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
so thank you any further
 
00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
rockmore thank you Mr chairman um so
 
00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire told us that the
 
00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
towns of burlin and cber had also had
 
00:22:26.789 --> 00:22:26.799 align:start position:0%
already opened up some of their roads to
 
00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
ATVs so am I to understand that that
 
00:22:31.789 --> 00:22:31.799 align:start position:0%
those towns went through a permitting
 
00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:35.080 align:start position:0%
process with do before they did so yeah
 
00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
there was a coordinated effort between U
 
00:22:40.269 --> 00:22:40.279 align:start position:0%
between the OHV groups regulate
 
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:47.669 --> 00:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
do thank you any further
 
00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
questions representative jurus thank you
 
00:22:52.909 --> 00:22:52.919 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and so would it be
 
00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
my understanding uh like you talk about
 
00:22:58.510 --> 00:22:58.520 align:start position:0%
Berlin and gorm that you need the
 
00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:01.480 align:start position:0%
necessary signage where the sign would
 
00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
say where you can get on and where you
 
00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
could get off the uh State
 
00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:09.400 align:start position:0%
Road yes on on the designated routes up
 
00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
in the North Country there is a sign
 
00:23:14.669 --> 00:23:14.679 align:start position:0%
that says um ATV use allowed and I think
 
00:23:18.029 --> 00:23:18.039 align:start position:0%
on the far end of it there's a End ATV
 
00:23:20.549 --> 00:23:20.559 align:start position:0%
use or signs to that effect so they
 
00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
there's a sign at either end of the of
 
00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
the allowed section to alert you know
 
00:23:28.029 --> 00:23:28.039 align:start position:0%
operators not to continue on where
 
00:23:29.549 --> 00:23:29.559 align:start position:0%
they're going
 
00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
follow quick followup thank you Mr
 
00:23:33.789 --> 00:23:33.799 align:start position:0%
chairman uh so in this case in the way
 
00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
the Bill's
 
00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:37.960 align:start position:0%
written uh the town would pay for the
 
00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:41.320 align:start position:0%
signage but the permitting process
 
00:23:43.269 --> 00:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
through the state wouldn't be able
 
00:23:47.269 --> 00:23:47.279 align:start position:0%
to um Define what you just said where
 
00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
you can access and then where you can
 
00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:52.520 align:start position:0%
depart the particular State
 
00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
Road I'm not sure I understand the
 
00:23:57.710 --> 00:23:57.720 align:start position:0%
question but to today there there's
 
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
permitting process cesses for uh many
 
00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
activities in a right away and there's
 
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
um to Define you know the the the use of
 
00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:09.320 align:start position:0%
the driveway of the of the trench permit
 
00:24:11.549 --> 00:24:11.559 align:start position:0%
for water sewer lines or something like
 
00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:15.480 align:start position:0%
that that there would be an ability to
 
00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:18.520 align:start position:0%
to have designated roots and include the
 
00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:20.840 align:start position:0%
the signage where required that's part
 
00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
of it today if you look in BR and gorm
 
00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
this the signs are there
 
00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure that that
 
00:24:32.669 --> 00:24:32.679 align:start position:0%
one one uh prohibits the other from
 
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
happening so okay thank
 
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
you seeing no further questions thank
 
00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:42.440 align:start position:0%
you uh and I'd like to call on Captain
 
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
Michael is that Eastman East Eastman of
 
00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:53.480 align:start position:0%
please thank you Mr chairman and the
 
00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I uh didn't
 
00:24:58.430 --> 00:24:58.440 align:start position:0%
intend to testify today just U because
 
00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
because uh my Colonel had asked me just
 
00:25:02.789 --> 00:25:02.799 align:start position:0%
to come in and sign in um but it seems
 
00:25:04.389 --> 00:25:04.399 align:start position:0%
that you have a lot of questions um
 
00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
about this so um I will Sor to say that
 
00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
my commission did oppose uh this bill uh
 
00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
just kind of the way that it's written
 
00:25:16.029 --> 00:25:16.039 align:start position:0%
um and nothing not speaking to
 
00:25:18.549 --> 00:25:18.559 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire or Senator Pearl
 
00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
um you know I think they are good
 
00:25:22.029 --> 00:25:22.039 align:start position:0%
intentioned in in this bill and uh
 
00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
submitting this bill um really at this
 
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
time uh there are laws it's that so 250
 
00:25:30.909 --> 00:25:30.919 align:start position:0%
15 A6 says that you need to have
 
00:25:32.789 --> 00:25:32.799 align:start position:0%
permission or you cannot operate on
 
00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
highways class one 3A highways public WS
 
00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
you cannot operate um uh at oh hrvs um
 
00:25:44.269 --> 00:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
one issue with the bill is that uh it's
 
00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
speaks about ATVs which there are
 
00:25:51.909 --> 00:25:51.919 align:start position:0%
definitions of so ohvs encompasses
 
00:25:55.909 --> 00:25:55.919 align:start position:0%
snowmobiles uh ATVs
 
00:25:58.789 --> 00:25:58.799 align:start position:0%
utvs um and so there's
 
00:26:01.029 --> 00:26:01.039 align:start position:0%
a difference between those those
 
00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:04.520 align:start position:0%
different Vehicles an ATV would be uh
 
00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:06.520 align:start position:0%
basically what you would what we would
 
00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:08.440 align:start position:0%
consider the four-wheeler that were the
 
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
used to the original ones with the Honda
 
00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
were the three-wheelers and those are
 
00:26:16.269 --> 00:26:16.279 align:start position:0%
right on top motorcycle style um if you
 
00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
will Vehicles a UTV is totally different
 
00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
that's what you're going to see I think
 
00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:23.039 align:start position:0%
that's what uh representative fauler was
 
00:26:26.029 --> 00:26:26.039 align:start position:0%
speaking about um and that uh they you
 
00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
get inside them ride them they're more
 
00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:30.440 align:start position:0%
like a dune buggy esque type of vehicle
 
00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
so the definition is very you know very
 
00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:35.039 align:start position:0%
different between or the vehicle by
 
00:26:37.789 --> 00:26:37.799 align:start position:0%
definition makes it very different uh
 
00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
right now um any town or any
 
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
municipality can open up their roads uh
 
00:26:46.789 --> 00:26:46.799 align:start position:0%
to ATV UTV o HRV use um and that can be
 
00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
done um in in you know at town meeting
 
00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:51.880 align:start position:0%
or or through the selectman whatever the
 
00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:55.000 align:start position:0%
case may be um and uh there are laws
 
00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:56.840 align:start position:0%
that go along with that saying that they
 
00:26:58.549 --> 00:26:58.559 align:start position:0%
have to consider you know what what the
 
00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
law enforcement for that or the law
 
00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:02.720 align:start position:0%
enforcement for that town or the lack
 
00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
thereof is responsible for you know if
 
00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
if there's a complaint then the local
 
00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:10.360 align:start position:0%
police department is going to cover that
 
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
complaint um so uh you know certainly
 
00:27:16.389 --> 00:27:16.399 align:start position:0%
they can do that now um there's also a
 
00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
law that says that towns um within and
 
00:27:22.029 --> 00:27:22.039 align:start position:0%
this changed probably 15 years ago uh
 
00:27:24.269 --> 00:27:24.279 align:start position:0%
that says that in Coos County Grafton
 
00:27:26.149 --> 00:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
County and a portion of actually
 
00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro um there are State highways
 
00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:31.880 align:start position:0%
that are open to ohrv use um and there's
 
00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
actually another bill currently um that
 
00:27:37.029 --> 00:27:37.039 align:start position:0%
just I just believed it received in a
 
00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:39.200 align:start position:0%
house number believe it's
 
00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:42.360 align:start position:0%
367 is that right
 
00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:45.720 align:start position:0%
Rich um believe it's 367 that speaks
 
00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:49.240 align:start position:0%
about extending those those counties um
 
00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
for use for ohrv use um just to speak on
 
00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
a couple of the questions that I heard
 
00:28:00.909 --> 00:28:00.919 align:start position:0%
um as far as oh the accidents uh we
 
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
retain our fishing game retains
 
00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:05.640 align:start position:0%
accidents there about 60 if you will
 
00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:08.440 align:start position:0%
throughout the state snowmobile and oh
 
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
HRV um and the the basic the largest
 
00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:16.120 align:start position:0%
cont contributing factor to that is uh
 
00:28:18.909 --> 00:28:18.919 align:start position:0%
speed and in experience that's the and
 
00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
then I think this year like careless and
 
00:28:23.269 --> 00:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
Reckless kind of came in there as one of
 
00:28:27.149 --> 00:28:27.159 align:start position:0%
the top three um any anything that
 
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
occurs or any accd that occur on the
 
00:28:31.269 --> 00:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
roads are covered by either that
 
00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
municipality's police department or the
 
00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
state police um because we don't cover
 
00:28:39.029 --> 00:28:39.039 align:start position:0%
accidents on roadways we cover the ones
 
00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:40.360 align:start position:0%
that happen out in the woods on the
 
00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:43.000 align:start position:0%
trails now certainly in absence you know
 
00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:45.080 align:start position:0%
if they're if State Police is covering a
 
00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
domestic in Lancaster and can't get to
 
00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:50.480 align:start position:0%
cover an ohrv accent on you know 113 and
 
00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
in Berlin we will help them obviously um
 
00:28:56.789 --> 00:28:56.799 align:start position:0%
so um in as far as the uh I heard the
 
00:28:58.909 --> 00:28:58.919 align:start position:0%
question about the um
 
00:29:01.149 --> 00:29:01.159 align:start position:0%
golf carts golf carts are not defined as
 
00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
an O HRV or an ATV so they would not
 
00:29:07.789 --> 00:29:07.799 align:start position:0%
fall on this um there is actually a u a
 
00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:09.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Motor Vehicle and I can't
 
00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:11.080 align:start position:0%
speak too much to it but I do know that
 
00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
there is a slow moving vehicle plate
 
00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
that people can get for um you know for
 
00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:19.720 align:start position:0%
uh golf carts uh for instance you know
 
00:29:21.549 --> 00:29:21.559 align:start position:0%
if they live within a community and they
 
00:29:23.029 --> 00:29:23.039 align:start position:0%
can drive their golf cart down to the
 
00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:25.240 align:start position:0%
beach they can get that plate and there
 
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
are a lot of restrictions that go along
 
00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:28.600 align:start position:0%
with that as well uh
 
00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
and so but that's for Department of
 
00:29:33.509 --> 00:29:33.519 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicle really to speak to um as
 
00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
far as the special commercial plates
 
00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
which representative F was speaking
 
00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:39.320 align:start position:0%
about um that is a plate for agriculture
 
00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:43.000 align:start position:0%
and light industrial use um so that is
 
00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:44.360 align:start position:0%
once again through Department of Motor
 
00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:46.120 align:start position:0%
Vehicle and there are restrictions on
 
00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:48.440 align:start position:0%
that there's as he said the the speed
 
00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:51.080 align:start position:0%
limit restrictions um agriculturally you
 
00:29:54.029 --> 00:29:54.039 align:start position:0%
can only go 10 miles from the from the
 
00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
farm or wherever you know uh that
 
00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:58.509 align:start position:0%
farm or wherever you know uh that
agricultural

00:29:58.509 --> 00:29:58.519 align:start position:0%
agricultural
 
00:30:00.549 --> 00:30:00.559 align:start position:0%
businesses going on and then light
 
00:30:02.909 --> 00:30:02.919 align:start position:0%
industrial is 2 miles um and I always
 
00:30:05.549 --> 00:30:05.559 align:start position:0%
explain it it's like you know if FW web
 
00:30:09.509 --> 00:30:09.519 align:start position:0%
had a uh you know a storage area two
 
00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
miles down the road and they want to
 
00:30:14.149 --> 00:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
take an ATV to go get plumbing supplies
 
00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:15.640 align:start position:0%
and bring them back to the main store
 
00:30:17.149 --> 00:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
that would be some that would be a use
 
00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
that they could use it for or you know
 
00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
anything any other maybe Landscaping use
 
00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
or something like that that's where we
 
00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:29.720 align:start position:0%
generally see them so um
 
00:30:31.389 --> 00:30:31.399 align:start position:0%
so those were the questions I heard and
 
00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
certainly I'm I'm here if there's any
 
00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:34.950 align:start position:0%
certainly I'm I'm here if there's any
other

00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
questions Point privilege Captain asan
 
00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
thank you first of all because that took
 
00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
care of all the questions I had that I
 
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
was jotting down as we were going over
 
00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:46.760 align:start position:0%
here that hadn't been asked yet and I
 
00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:48.760 align:start position:0%
think the most important thing that I
 
00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:51.320 align:start position:0%
heard out of your testimony was the fact
 
00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
that we already do have u a a position a
 
00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:00.440 align:start position:0%
procedure in place to get most of this
 
00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
done already that this bill is trying to
 
00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
cover having said that representative
 
00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
fauler thank you again I had a couple
 
00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:11.320 align:start position:0%
questions about the vehicles uh that are
 
00:31:14.549 --> 00:31:14.559 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the in the bill here uh one
 
00:31:16.629 --> 00:31:16.639 align:start position:0%
is because I think you might be familiar
 
00:31:20.029 --> 00:31:20.039 align:start position:0%
with it they indicate the vehicle should
 
00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:23.320 align:start position:0%
be capable of going 40 miles an hour I
 
00:31:25.629 --> 00:31:25.639 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure it's safe to drive with
 
00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
ohrv tires on a paved roadway at that
 
00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
speed I never do and do most of these
 
00:31:35.029 --> 00:31:35.039 align:start position:0%
actually come with directional signals
 
00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
uh flashers and other the the other
 
00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:39.880 align:start position:0%
items here or is that is
 
00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
that is that is that part of what a know
 
00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
normal off-road vehicle has I can speak
 
00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
to that uh it really all depends what
 
00:31:49.509 --> 00:31:49.519 align:start position:0%
you are looking for and what you pay for
 
00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
if you walk into any ohrv store and say
 
00:31:54.389 --> 00:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
I want a side by side you know so I can
 
00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
go ride in Jericho State Park you're
 
00:31:59.909 --> 00:31:59.919 align:start position:0%
going to get the one that has uh you
 
00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
know ATV tires for off-road use now
 
00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:04.840 align:start position:0%
certainly um there are different types
 
00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:07.000 align:start position:0%
of utvs out there you know you can go to
 
00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
the Tractor any tractor store and buy
 
00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:12.360 align:start position:0%
like a gator style um that does come
 
00:32:14.549 --> 00:32:14.559 align:start position:0%
with different you know break breaks
 
00:32:15.909 --> 00:32:15.919 align:start position:0%
with directionals you can get really
 
00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:17.200 align:start position:0%
whatever you want and there's a lot of
 
00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:20.320 align:start position:0%
aftermarket stuff out there as well um
 
00:32:22.389 --> 00:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
but at the end of the day um with all
 
00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
that said when you and we're not a title
 
00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:28.120 align:start position:0%
state for ATVs or utvs or any ohrv but
 
00:32:29.509 --> 00:32:29.519 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day when they get that
 
00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
title in hand it says off off Highway
 
00:32:35.549 --> 00:32:35.559 align:start position:0%
recreational vehicle uh no matter what
 
00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:43.389 --> 00:32:43.399 align:start position:0%
it uh thank you Mr chairman and and
 
00:32:45.389 --> 00:32:45.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh agreeing to answer some
 
00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
questions uh given that we already have
 
00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:50.600 align:start position:0%
the permitting process and it's managed
 
00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
apparently it's managed by Dot and
 
00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
working well uh and particularly if you
 
00:32:56.549 --> 00:32:56.559 align:start position:0%
look at section two of the bill it seeks
 
00:32:59.389 --> 00:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
to preempt the existing permitting
 
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
statutes uh in your opinion does this
 
00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:04.559 align:start position:0%
bill add any value to the process that's
 
00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
already in
 
00:33:08.789 --> 00:33:08.799 align:start position:0%
place I could say that certainly
 
00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation does have a
 
00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
perming process in those areas where
 
00:33:14.509 --> 00:33:14.519 align:start position:0%
it's allowed they do a lot of like Road
 
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
Crossings for snowmobile trails um so
 
00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
the perming process for instance an
 
00:33:23.149 --> 00:33:23.159 align:start position:0%
example I can give you is uh in gorum um
 
00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
there is a section of Route 16 portions
 
00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
of Route 16 in in Coos County are open
 
00:33:30.389 --> 00:33:30.399 align:start position:0%
but there's a section from what is now
 
00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
moms used to be Shaws um to just before
 
00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
you get into town in Berlin that's
 
00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
closed on that section and the reason
 
00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:40.440 align:start position:0%
for that is because there's a large
 
00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
intersection uh which houses Walmart and
 
00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
um and it is quite busy and uh so for
 
00:33:49.029 --> 00:33:49.039 align:start position:0%
instance that small section is closed
 
00:33:50.509 --> 00:33:50.519 align:start position:0%
and there are other businesses within
 
00:33:53.029 --> 00:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
there besides Walmart small strip malls
 
00:33:55.509 --> 00:33:55.519 align:start position:0%
above that um so it's really it's just
 
00:33:58.430 --> 00:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
so in that permitting process yes 16 you
 
00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
can operate on it and you can go to moms
 
00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
and leave moms and and buy whatever you
 
00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
want but um if you go beyond that it is
 
00:34:08.149 --> 00:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
closed just because it is so busy in the
 
00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
interaction with those smaller vehicles
 
00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
and understand these vehicles are
 
00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:14.200 align:start position:0%
they're not you know they might be the
 
00:34:16.990 --> 00:34:17.000 align:start position:0%
size of a you know a Toyota Yus but
 
00:34:20.109 --> 00:34:20.119 align:start position:0%
they're not through the same crash um
 
00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
you know specifics that that toyot ARS
 
00:34:30.829 --> 00:34:30.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:33.200 align:start position:0%
representative Brown thank you Mr
 
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
chairman can you just expand a little
 
00:34:37.869 --> 00:34:37.879 align:start position:0%
bit captain on the uh issues that the
 
00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
commission had why they're against this
 
00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you uh well for one I already
 
00:34:45.669 --> 00:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
stated was the ATV definition that was
 
00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
one that I had brought to them um the
 
00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:49.399 align:start position:0%
other is is that in the way that I read
 
00:34:51.430 --> 00:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
it and it's potentially them reading it
 
00:34:53.149 --> 00:34:53.159 align:start position:0%
wrong but the way that I saw it was that
 
00:34:57.270 --> 00:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
a municipality could um say yes we want
 
00:34:59.670 --> 00:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
to have roads we want to open up roads
 
00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:01.560 align:start position:0%
within our town and we want to open up
 
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
State highways um and in question that
 
00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:07.400 align:start position:0%
comes to my mind is there different
 
00:35:10.069 --> 00:35:10.079 align:start position:0%
there's different uh funding mechanisms
 
00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
there so obviously town roads are taken
 
00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
care of through town funds whereas state
 
00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:16.200 align:start position:0%
roads are taken care of and I I'm
 
00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
probably speaking out of turn here and
 
00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh General can speak much better on that
 
00:35:23.069 --> 00:35:23.079 align:start position:0%
but um so for instance you know this
 
00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:25.000 align:start position:0%
time of year the town is plowing the
 
00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
town roads and Dot is plowing the state
 
00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:30.760 align:start position:0%
roads so once again where does that come
 
00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
into that that funding mechanism and and
 
00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:36.280 align:start position:0%
now you have you know low pressure tires
 
00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
tearing up sides of roads and pavement
 
00:35:40.589 --> 00:35:40.599 align:start position:0%
and how do you pay for that so that it
 
00:35:43.069 --> 00:35:43.079 align:start position:0%
just brings some questions to my mind on
 
00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
on that side of it as far as funding so
 
00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:46.720 align:start position:0%
that's really the two things that I
 
00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:48.640 align:start position:0%
presented to the to the commission and
 
00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:50.240 align:start position:0%
why they had issue with
 
00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
it followup please uh so Captain if you
 
00:35:56.109 --> 00:35:56.119 align:start position:0%
if I understand right if if the
 
00:35:59.230 --> 00:35:59.240 align:start position:0%
permitting process was place that was
 
00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:02.280 align:start position:0%
kind of uh exempt in this initially if
 
00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
that was in place you wouldn't object to
 
00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:07.240 align:start position:0%
the bill as it's indicated if we cleared
 
00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
OHV once again like I said I I think
 
00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
that uh representative Maguire and
 
00:36:18.430 --> 00:36:18.440 align:start position:0%
Senator Pearl are good intentioned on
 
00:36:20.349 --> 00:36:20.359 align:start position:0%
this bill but I think that um you know
 
00:36:22.069 --> 00:36:22.079 align:start position:0%
there are other bills out there that
 
00:36:24.109 --> 00:36:24.119 align:start position:0%
kind of uses the same mechanisms that
 
00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:26.680 align:start position:0%
we're using right now um that do is
 
00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
using Bureau Trail are using um that
 
00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
would be better to to continue on with
 
00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:35.560 align:start position:0%
with those review processes that are
 
00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
you I'm
 
00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:47.800 align:start position:0%
sorry representative Lewis thank you Mr
 
00:36:49.589 --> 00:36:49.599 align:start position:0%
chairman Captain there was one thing I
 
00:36:52.589 --> 00:36:52.599 align:start position:0%
just real quick the uh you you gave a an
 
00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
approximate number of uh accidents that
 
00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
fishing games responded to none of those
 
00:36:59.710 --> 00:36:59.720 align:start position:0%
were uh particular they would have been
 
00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
all on Trails or is that those accidents
 
00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
are referring to also on on roads and
 
00:37:07.390 --> 00:37:07.400 align:start position:0%
and I had a follow up to that after the
 
00:37:09.309 --> 00:37:09.319 align:start position:0%
I can't say that all of those I mean the
 
00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:11.480 align:start position:0%
majority of them are on Trails um
 
00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
because that's really what we would keep
 
00:37:16.309 --> 00:37:16.319 align:start position:0%
those acents for now if um you know the
 
00:37:18.589 --> 00:37:18.599 align:start position:0%
local police department or uh where it
 
00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
happens on a road would they would do it
 
00:37:23.109 --> 00:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
under Ro a i they believe it's a DS smv
 
00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
form which is the the traditional motor
 
00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
vehicle accident form um so because they
 
00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:30.440 align:start position:0%
would have to treat it as a motor
 
00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
vehicle so you wouldn't you wouldn't
 
00:37:34.349 --> 00:37:34.359 align:start position:0%
have any record of of what they're
 
00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:36.040 align:start position:0%
responding to if they were involved with
 
00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:38.720 align:start position:0%
an ohrv if a town municipality responded
 
00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
to that the fishing game doesn't track
 
00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:42.760 align:start position:0%
that we do not sometimes they send them
 
00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
to us and sometimes they don't thank you
 
00:37:48.829 --> 00:37:48.839 align:start position:0%
thank you any other further questions
 
00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much Captain
 
00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:54.920 align:start position:0%
thank you uh next I'd like to hear our
 
00:37:58.910 --> 00:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
final speaker uh Craig reny
 
00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:05.960 align:start position:0%
yourself good morning uh my name is
 
00:38:07.309 --> 00:38:07.319 align:start position:0%
Craig reny I'm the chief of the Bureau
 
00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:08.920 align:start position:0%
of trails at the Department of Natural
 
00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:10.640 align:start position:0%
and cultural resources and I was here
 
00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:12.040 align:start position:0%
this morning to help answer some
 
00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
questions um so I did fill out a card so
 
00:38:17.069 --> 00:38:17.079 align:start position:0%
I could just speak briefly the the
 
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
permit process that's and by the way
 
00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
we're not taking a position on the bill
 
00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:22.200 align:start position:0%
but I just wanted to clarify a few
 
00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
things um the permit process that was um
 
00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:26.680 align:start position:0%
questioned earlier by representative
 
00:38:28.990 --> 00:38:29.000 align:start position:0%
Brown so that process that we go through
 
00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
Bureau trails and Dot now works very
 
00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
well we uh you know we we look for you
 
00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:35.560 align:start position:0%
know we permit Highway Crossings and
 
00:38:39.109 --> 00:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
connectors with do so as ohrv trails are
 
00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
crossing highways or there's on Highway
 
00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:42.920 align:start position:0%
connectors they submit them to Bureau
 
00:38:45.109 --> 00:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
Trails we review them and then we submit
 
00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
them to do because we depend on their
 
00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:49.160 align:start position:0%
expertise their engineering expertise to
 
00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
make sure it's safe to Cross or use you
 
00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
know Highway rways and stuff for for our
 
00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:55.400 align:start position:0%
Trail connections so that's an important
 
00:38:58.270 --> 00:38:58.280 align:start position:0%
part of that process um if if you will
 
00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:00.200 align:start position:0%
and as Captain e Eastman mentioned
 
00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:02.440 align:start position:0%
there's a um there's another bill
 
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
upcoming in the rr&amp;d committee that is
 
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
adding five counties to on Highway use
 
00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:11.200 align:start position:0%
for ohvs I think this bill uh is pointed
 
00:39:14.309 --> 00:39:14.319 align:start position:0%
out stating ATVs but the the other house
 
00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
bill is ohvs which includes utvs side by
 
00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
sides as well as as well as ATVs U but
 
00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:22.040 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions you
 
00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:24.230 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions you
may

00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
may
 
00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:27.560 align:start position:0%
have thank you
 
00:39:29.349 --> 00:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
is that a you want to ask a question I
 
00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:31.640 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:34.270 align:start position:0%
have a question
Mr

00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:34.280 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
recognize boy thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:39:38.309 --> 00:39:38.319 align:start position:0%
Mr reny thank you very much for taking
 
00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
my question y simply put do you know in
 
00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:42.440 align:start position:0%
your experience how long does the
 
00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:44.230 align:start position:0%
your experience how long does the
process

00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:39:46.589 --> 00:39:46.599 align:start position:0%
take um it can take a few it can take a
 
00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
few months so the the first part when a
 
00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
say an oav Club comes to us or or even a
 
00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
municipality and say Hey you know we
 
00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:55.400 align:start position:0%
want to have a highway Crossing or
 
00:39:57.390 --> 00:39:57.400 align:start position:0%
connector here we go out with our
 
00:39:59.270 --> 00:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
District supervisor and and look at the
 
00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
Crossing you know with the the person
 
00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
requesting whether it's the club or or
 
00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
municipality check it out make sure it's
 
00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
a it's a good area to connect the trail
 
00:40:09.069 --> 00:40:09.079 align:start position:0%
Network and then we we have actually an
 
00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:11.000 align:start position:0%
application form that goes to dot for
 
00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
review and then they'll often meet with
 
00:40:14.589 --> 00:40:14.599 align:start position:0%
us on site as well and we'll look at the
 
00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:17.240 align:start position:0%
safety aspects so line of sight you know
 
00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
for highway traffic the what's the
 
00:40:21.790 --> 00:40:21.800 align:start position:0%
vehicle speed on the highway um you know
 
00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
what are the slopes approaching the
 
00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:24.920 align:start position:0%
highway on the shoulders all those
 
00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
safety things should be considered when
 
00:40:27.829 --> 00:40:27.839 align:start position:0%
you're crossing a highway or getting on
 
00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
a highway
 
00:40:33.069 --> 00:40:33.079 align:start position:0%
system does that answer your question
 
00:40:35.589 --> 00:40:35.599 align:start position:0%
few months it takes a few months
 
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
generally speaking um I I will say uh to
 
00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
to Do's credit um on the ohrv side they
 
00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
created a GIS mapping tool a few years
 
00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
ago to kind of map out where all the
 
00:40:50.349 --> 00:40:50.359 align:start position:0%
ohrv highway Crossing connector permits
 
00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
are so both agency can look at that look
 
00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:54.880 align:start position:0%
at that tool and see where the crossings
 
00:40:56.349 --> 00:40:56.359 align:start position:0%
are see where there's pending
 
00:40:57.910 --> 00:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
applications see where some have been
 
00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:00.200 align:start position:0%
approved or denied and so we both have
 
00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:01.800 align:start position:0%
access as agencies to look at that
 
00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
information and it's to help you know
 
00:41:05.309 --> 00:41:05.319 align:start position:0%
get us better aligned to get those
 
00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:07.480 align:start position:0%
reviewed and approved in a timely manner
 
00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:09.240 align:start position:0%
uh so that tool is that mapping tool is
 
00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
working pretty good so you know that's a
 
00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:14.440 align:start position:0%
benefit to both agencies I would say
 
00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for your answer thank you
 
00:41:18.349 --> 00:41:18.359 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman yeah any further questions
 
00:41:19.230 --> 00:41:19.240 align:start position:0%
for Mr
 
00:41:23.069 --> 00:41:23.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
bogert uh thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:41:27.550 --> 00:41:27.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:30.670 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
question

00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:30.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:35.480 align:start position:0%
um after listening to your testimony and
 
00:41:38.829 --> 00:41:38.839 align:start position:0%
and that of do is there anything that
 
00:41:42.109 --> 00:41:42.119 align:start position:0%
this bill brings to the table that
 
00:41:42.119 --> 00:41:44.349 align:start position:0%
this bill brings to the table that
current

00:41:44.349 --> 00:41:44.359 align:start position:0%
current
 
00:41:49.150 --> 00:41:49.160 align:start position:0%
law doesn't have so right now for on
 
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
Highway use um for oh hrvs in law now
 
00:41:56.309 --> 00:41:56.319 align:start position:0%
it's Grafton and Coos counties and um
 
00:41:57.950 --> 00:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
and then there's some other
 
00:42:00.109 --> 00:42:00.119 align:start position:0%
um specific areas called out in the law
 
00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
like there's a section um there's a
 
00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
highway Crossing on Route 114 that's
 
00:42:05.230 --> 00:42:05.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the section of Law and
 
00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:07.640 align:start position:0%
there's few others in Hillsboro County
 
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
but um this opens up the whole state uh
 
00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
to ohvs and I think again there's an
 
00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
existing process for and I guess maybe I
 
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
don't want to confuse the issue but
 
00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
there really is two issues for ohrv use
 
00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:24.680 align:start position:0%
on highways there's Crossing and
 
00:42:26.549 --> 00:42:26.559 align:start position:0%
connectors which is one part of the
 
00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
statute and other stat part of the
 
00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
statute where I mentioned Grafton and
 
00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
cost County that's on Highway use so
 
00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:34.760 align:start position:0%
there's two different parts of 215a that
 
00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:36.400 align:start position:0%
you're looking at
 
00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:38.750 align:start position:0%
you're looking at
here

00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:42:43.589 --> 00:42:43.599 align:start position:0%
followup uh thank you so you indicated
 
00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:45.880 align:start position:0%
that this bill opens it up across the
 
00:42:50.990 --> 00:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
state and it also allows on Highway
 
00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:54.760 align:start position:0%
use across the state correct and and it
 
00:42:59.430 --> 00:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't specify what types of Highways
 
00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
and byways and expressways correct and
 
00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
those other sections of Statute call out
 
00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
highways one class one through three or
 
00:43:10.109 --> 00:43:10.119 align:start position:0%
4 through six in the existing statute
 
00:43:14.309 --> 00:43:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
identified one follow up thank you
 
00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
um so the current laws that there to
 
00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:29.240 align:start position:0%
certain counties as one aspect of it is
 
00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
and it was indicated that they're
 
00:43:35.230 --> 00:43:35.240 align:start position:0%
looking there's already a a house bill
 
00:43:38.829 --> 00:43:38.839 align:start position:0%
somewhere that's looking to expand that
 
00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
but maintain the current permitting
 
00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
processes and the current language
 
00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:47.640 align:start position:0%
wouldn't change and stuff so all the
 
00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:50.200 align:start position:0%
Safeguard the guard rails that are in
 
00:43:54.309 --> 00:43:54.319 align:start position:0%
place would remain is just adding new
 
00:43:56.549 --> 00:43:56.559 align:start position:0%
counties to the list correct that's my
 
00:43:58.589 --> 00:43:58.599 align:start position:0%
understanding the bill it doesn't change
 
00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:00.160 align:start position:0%
any of the permit procedes or review
 
00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:05.589 --> 00:44:05.599 align:start position:0%

e

00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
at this point in time I'd like to call
 
00:49:10.309 --> 00:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
the I'd like to declare the public
 
00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
hearing for House Bill 181
 
00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:27.349 --> 00:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
answer good morning CH Mr chairman and
 
00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
the members of the committee I'm
 
00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
representative Mark PR from Hillsboro 15
 
00:49:35.710 --> 00:49:35.720 align:start position:0%
which is Manchester Ward 8 uh today I
 
00:49:37.829 --> 00:49:37.839 align:start position:0%
bring you Bill
 
00:49:41.950 --> 00:49:41.960 align:start position:0%
181 uh reference to the opticom system
 
00:49:46.829 --> 00:49:46.839 align:start position:0%
uh which is what emergency vehicles use
 
00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
to change the the traffic lights to our
 
00:49:52.150 --> 00:49:52.160 align:start position:0%
favor so we can get through them without
 
00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
crashing into people or people crashing
 
00:49:56.349 --> 00:49:56.359 align:start position:0%
into us either usually them crashing
 
00:50:00.069 --> 00:50:00.079 align:start position:0%
into us um but over the years we've
 
00:50:03.549 --> 00:50:03.559 align:start position:0%
noticed that on the state intersections
 
00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:06.680 align:start position:0%
they haven't been working so I'm
 
00:50:08.829 --> 00:50:08.839 align:start position:0%
springing this to see if we can't get
 
00:50:12.270 --> 00:50:12.280 align:start position:0%
them uh repaired and maintained uh
 
00:50:13.470 --> 00:50:13.480 align:start position:0%
because I'm not show what happened they
 
00:50:16.710 --> 00:50:16.720 align:start position:0%
used to do a really great job and then
 
00:50:18.309 --> 00:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
and the problem with that
 
00:50:21.150 --> 00:50:21.160 align:start position:0%
is this one works the other one was
 
00:50:23.230 --> 00:50:23.240 align:start position:0%
working yesterday but now it's not
 
00:50:26.309 --> 00:50:26.319 align:start position:0%
working we and then we're looking for
 
00:50:30.109 --> 00:50:30.119 align:start position:0%
the and they're not working for us and
 
00:50:33.069 --> 00:50:33.079 align:start position:0%
um so it's kind of confusing for us
 
00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
whether they're going to work today or
 
00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
not or is this one working but the other
 
00:50:38.670 --> 00:50:38.680 align:start position:0%
one doesn't so we're just trying to get
 
00:50:41.789 --> 00:50:41.799 align:start position:0%
them maintained and uh that's really all
 
00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
I have I know there's money involved and
 
00:50:49.950 --> 00:50:49.960 align:start position:0%
uh but that's all I have any
 
00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:52.760 align:start position:0%
questions do we have yes we do
 
00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:54.670 align:start position:0%
questions do we have yes we do
representative

00:50:54.670 --> 00:50:54.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:50:57.109 --> 00:50:57.119 align:start position:0%
Bogart thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:50:58.549 --> 00:50:58.559 align:start position:0%
you for taking my
 
00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
question um this uh system that you're
 
00:51:07.789 --> 00:51:07.799 align:start position:0%
looking to have do start to take care of
 
00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:11.640 align:start position:0%
who installs this equipment initially
 
00:51:13.710 --> 00:51:13.720 align:start position:0%
and who purchased it
 
00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
initially as far as I know the dot
 
00:51:22.030 --> 00:51:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:24.390 --> 00:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
it the other question is representative
 
00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:27.470 align:start position:0%
it the other question is representative
fauler

00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh you basically describe what kind of
 
00:51:30.910 --> 00:51:30.920 align:start position:0%
vehicles you use it is it mostly
 
00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:33.400 align:start position:0%
Municipal Vehicles fire police fire
 
00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:34.829 align:start position:0%
Municipal Vehicles fire police fire
police

00:51:34.829 --> 00:51:34.839 align:start position:0%
police
 
00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
ambulances so do any state Vehicles use
 
00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
the Opticon and is
 
00:51:45.870 --> 00:51:45.880 align:start position:0%
the uh not the level that we use as far
 
00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
as I understand so uh Fire Marshall
 
00:51:52.349 --> 00:51:52.359 align:start position:0%
might be using it or State Police might
 
00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
be using
 
00:51:57.390 --> 00:51:57.400 align:start position:0%
it ref follow up at follow up please so
 
00:51:59.710 --> 00:51:59.720 align:start position:0%
uh right now the municipality typically
 
00:52:01.230 --> 00:52:01.240 align:start position:0%
would be maintaining some parts of the
 
00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
system the ones that are on their own
 
00:52:04.750 --> 00:52:04.760 align:start position:0%
correct and they have the
 
00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
expertise to maintain it yes so we're
 
00:52:10.349 --> 00:52:10.359 align:start position:0%
really talking about who pays for that
 
00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:12.839 align:start position:0%
rather than so how it gets done
 
00:52:15.589 --> 00:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
initially when the system came out and
 
00:52:17.230 --> 00:52:17.240 align:start position:0%
this was a long time ago so I may have
 
00:52:19.109 --> 00:52:19.119 align:start position:0%
some of the may be fuzzy for me on some
 
00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
of the exact facts and I'm sure the
 
00:52:24.549 --> 00:52:24.559 align:start position:0%
people behind me have them um the system
 
00:52:28.430 --> 00:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
came out one once you declared your city
 
00:52:31.710 --> 00:52:31.720 align:start position:0%
or whatever a opticom city every
 
00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:35.160 align:start position:0%
intersection had to have it and if it
 
00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
was in a municipality on a Municipal
 
00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
Road the municipality was charged with
 
00:52:44.349 --> 00:52:44.359 align:start position:0%
maintaining and keeping that system
 
00:52:49.230 --> 00:52:49.240 align:start position:0%
up and I also knew that the state had
 
00:52:52.470 --> 00:52:52.480 align:start position:0%
the same deal if they put them in and
 
00:52:54.549 --> 00:52:54.559 align:start position:0%
and they were putting them in it was
 
00:52:57.349 --> 00:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
their responsibility to maintain them
 
00:52:59.870 --> 00:52:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:03.150 --> 00:53:03.160 align:start position:0%
understood thank you any other further
 
00:53:05.710 --> 00:53:05.720 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative Brown thank
 
00:53:08.789 --> 00:53:08.799 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman so what your concern is
 
00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:10.440 align:start position:0%
is basically that on the state roads
 
00:53:11.950 --> 00:53:11.960 align:start position:0%
there's a problem with the maintenance Z
 
00:53:14.549 --> 00:53:14.559 align:start position:0%
correct so what would be wrong with just
 
00:53:16.270 --> 00:53:16.280 align:start position:0%
ensuring that the municipalities do
 
00:53:18.069 --> 00:53:18.079 align:start position:0%
their part and that the state roads are
 
00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
taken over and maintained by the
 
00:53:23.630 --> 00:53:23.640 align:start position:0%
state so absolutely the municipalities
 
00:53:25.109 --> 00:53:25.119 align:start position:0%
do their part they
 
00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:29.480 align:start position:0%
maintain their system were the ones that
 
00:53:31.150 --> 00:53:31.160 align:start position:0%
are being neglected are the state ones
 
00:53:33.910 --> 00:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
as far as I at least in my area that I'm
 
00:53:36.190 --> 00:53:36.200 align:start position:0%
functioning in although I noticed one of
 
00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:39.240 align:start position:0%
them got fixed the other day so follow
 
00:53:41.710 --> 00:53:41.720 align:start position:0%
chair thank you um
 
00:53:44.829 --> 00:53:44.839 align:start position:0%
so is there a a a maintenance schedule
 
00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:47.640 align:start position:0%
like I have a security system in my home
 
00:53:50.349 --> 00:53:50.359 align:start position:0%
my security company does a standard test
 
00:53:52.630 --> 00:53:52.640 align:start position:0%
monthly to make sure that my system's
 
00:53:55.069 --> 00:53:55.079 align:start position:0%
working properly is there a program for
 
00:53:56.670 --> 00:53:56.680 align:start position:0%
that in the municipalities or the State
 
00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
you don't know in the municipalities if
 
00:54:00.910 --> 00:54:00.920 align:start position:0%
we notice one I used to work for the
 
00:54:02.470 --> 00:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
city of Nashville on the fire department
 
00:54:04.549 --> 00:54:04.559 align:start position:0%
if we notice one wasn't working we got
 
00:54:05.710 --> 00:54:05.720 align:start position:0%
back to the station we called the
 
00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:06.630 align:start position:0%
back to the station we called the
highway

00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:06.640 align:start position:0%
highway
 
00:54:10.349 --> 00:54:10.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
fixed I used to be on the fire
 
00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
department too and I'd be concerned if
 
00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
there were no regular testing and then
 
00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
we get out there and we're going to an
 
00:54:18.789 --> 00:54:18.799 align:start position:0%
intersection we could potentially have
 
00:54:20.829 --> 00:54:20.839 align:start position:0%
an accident we're ready to go through
 
00:54:23.670 --> 00:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
that so all right thank you I I think
 
00:54:25.349 --> 00:54:25.359 align:start position:0%
any other further questions pertaining
 
00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
to that might be held for DOT when it's
 
00:54:30.589 --> 00:54:30.599 align:start position:0%
their opportunity to speak uh if there
 
00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
are no other further questions for
 
00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
um representative Edgar thank you Mr
 
00:54:39.589 --> 00:54:39.599 align:start position:0%
chairman um I know there's different
 
00:54:42.109 --> 00:54:42.119 align:start position:0%
words to the effect of some of this but
 
00:54:45.870 --> 00:54:45.880 align:start position:0%
just to clarify it again to me the part
 
00:54:47.910 --> 00:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
of the system that is on the vehicles
 
00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
themselves is installed and maintained
 
00:54:54.270 --> 00:54:54.280 align:start position:0%
by who by us the municipality that put
 
00:54:57.510 --> 00:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
it on their vehicle okay so you
 
00:55:00.150 --> 00:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
all of it okay yep on your own vehicles
 
00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:02.240 align:start position:0%
thank you yep thank
 
00:55:04.990 --> 00:55:05.000 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
00:55:09.390 --> 00:55:09.400 align:start position:0%
Mr next call on Leo
 
00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:12.230 align:start position:0%
Mr next call on Leo
leeon

00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
leeon
 
00:55:17.589 --> 00:55:17.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:20.069 --> 00:55:20.079 align:start position:0%
do please introduce yourself welcome to
 
00:55:21.829 --> 00:55:21.839 align:start position:0%
Public Works introduce yourself please
 
00:55:23.630 --> 00:55:23.640 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair members of the
 
00:55:25.470 --> 00:55:25.480 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for the opportunity
 
00:55:28.390 --> 00:55:28.400 align:start position:0%
to speak to you my name is Lee bonis I
 
00:55:29.990 --> 00:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
am the administrator of the Bureau of
 
00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
traffic at dot also the state traffic
 
00:55:34.750 --> 00:55:34.760 align:start position:0%
engineer among other things the Bureau
 
00:55:37.349 --> 00:55:37.359 align:start position:0%
of traffic is responsible for the design
 
00:55:39.549 --> 00:55:39.559 align:start position:0%
operation and maintenance of traffic
 
00:55:42.670 --> 00:55:42.680 align:start position:0%
signals on state maintained roadways uh
 
00:55:44.190 --> 00:55:44.200 align:start position:0%
the department does not take a position
 
00:55:45.990 --> 00:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
on this bill but I'm here to provide
 
00:55:49.069 --> 00:55:49.079 align:start position:0%
some basic information and to answer any
 
00:55:52.270 --> 00:55:52.280 align:start position:0%
questions um I have some some notes here
 
00:55:54.309 --> 00:55:54.319 align:start position:0%
to kind of go through what preemption
 
00:55:57.710 --> 00:55:57.720 align:start position:0%
systems are and how they work um and uh
 
00:56:00.750 --> 00:56:00.760 align:start position:0%
the current situation if you if you may
 
00:56:03.950 --> 00:56:03.960 align:start position:0%
I'll proceed with that please okay uh
 
00:56:05.950 --> 00:56:05.960 align:start position:0%
traffic signal preemption systems that's
 
00:56:08.829 --> 00:56:08.839 align:start position:0%
more of the generic term than opticom uh
 
00:56:11.029 --> 00:56:11.039 align:start position:0%
they're technology that interrupt the
 
00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:13.880 align:start position:0%
normal traffic signal cycle to provide a
 
00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
traffic signal indication that's
 
00:56:18.109 --> 00:56:18.119 align:start position:0%
favorable to the user and then
 
00:56:20.589 --> 00:56:20.599 align:start position:0%
transitions the signal back to a normal
 
00:56:22.470 --> 00:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
cycle I think many of us have seen them
 
00:56:25.069 --> 00:56:25.079 align:start position:0%
work here in conquer and other other
 
00:56:28.430 --> 00:56:28.440 align:start position:0%
cities uh generally these are uh
 
00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:30.640 align:start position:0%
installed for emergency vehicles that's
 
00:56:32.430 --> 00:56:32.440 align:start position:0%
what we see predominantly but they can
 
00:56:35.190 --> 00:56:35.200 align:start position:0%
also be used in other cases such as for
 
00:56:37.870 --> 00:56:37.880 align:start position:0%
Transit priority uh for maintenance and
 
00:56:39.309 --> 00:56:39.319 align:start position:0%
also for
 
00:56:42.270 --> 00:56:42.280 align:start position:0%
railroads uh when railroads are in close
 
00:56:43.950 --> 00:56:43.960 align:start position:0%
proximity to a traffic
 
00:56:46.789 --> 00:56:46.799 align:start position:0%
signal uh the components of the system
 
00:56:48.829 --> 00:56:48.839 align:start position:0%
are the initiator which is usually
 
00:56:51.069 --> 00:56:51.079 align:start position:0%
mounted on a vehicle or some other
 
00:56:52.990 --> 00:56:53.000 align:start position:0%
location like a fire station which
 
00:56:56.670 --> 00:56:56.680 align:start position:0%
initiates the uh call for a preemption
 
00:56:58.870 --> 00:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh there's detectors that receive that
 
00:57:01.309 --> 00:57:01.319 align:start position:0%
signal and then there's preemption
 
00:57:03.750 --> 00:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
circuitry within the traffic signal
 
00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
cabinet that interpret those um messages
 
00:57:10.270 --> 00:57:10.280 align:start position:0%
from the initiator and Trigger uh the
 
00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
change in the traffic signal
 
00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
controller uh there are uh a couple of
 
00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
different technologies that are used uh
 
00:57:20.069 --> 00:57:20.079 align:start position:0%
the one we're talking about here is an
 
00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
optical technology uh the two common
 
00:57:27.349 --> 00:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
brands are opticom uh as well as Tomar
 
00:57:29.910 --> 00:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh opticom is kind of the generic or has
 
00:57:33.029 --> 00:57:33.039 align:start position:0%
become the the name kind of like Kleenex
 
00:57:38.109 --> 00:57:38.119 align:start position:0%
is for tissue um so uh not all systems
 
00:57:41.710 --> 00:57:41.720 align:start position:0%
are opticom um but they may be Optical
 
00:57:45.349 --> 00:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
actuated um the optical technology is a
 
00:57:48.029 --> 00:57:48.039 align:start position:0%
mature technology uh as you heard it
 
00:57:51.109 --> 00:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
it's been around for a long time um I
 
00:57:53.069 --> 00:57:53.079 align:start position:0%
like to use the term mature instead of
 
00:57:57.750 --> 00:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
old um so but it is um it it continues
 
00:58:02.190 --> 00:58:02.200 align:start position:0%
to evolve um the there are challenges
 
00:58:04.430 --> 00:58:04.440 align:start position:0%
with with that technology like many
 
00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:05.430 align:start position:0%
with with that technology like many
other

00:58:05.430 --> 00:58:05.440 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:58:08.670 --> 00:58:08.680 align:start position:0%
Technologies um there's issues of um
 
00:58:13.670 --> 00:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
false calls uh there's um issues with a
 
00:58:15.870 --> 00:58:15.880 align:start position:0%
the detection can only be received
 
00:58:18.349 --> 00:58:18.359 align:start position:0%
within a short distance and it doesn't
 
00:58:22.069 --> 00:58:22.079 align:start position:0%
it takes too long to cycle through the
 
00:58:25.109 --> 00:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
uh traffic signal phases to get to a a
 
00:58:28.230 --> 00:58:28.240 align:start position:0%
green for the approaching vehicle um
 
00:58:30.230 --> 00:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
generally fire apparatus which move a
 
00:58:34.190 --> 00:58:34.200 align:start position:0%
little slower than uh police cars May um
 
00:58:35.870 --> 00:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
T it tends to work better for the fire
 
00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
apparatus than police cars they may
 
00:58:39.270 --> 00:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
still arrive at an intersection see a
 
00:58:43.349 --> 00:58:43.359 align:start position:0%
red light um there's uh there are other
 
00:58:45.390 --> 00:58:45.400 align:start position:0%
technologies that are used for Signal
 
00:58:48.349 --> 00:58:48.359 align:start position:0%
preemption these can include radio
 
00:58:51.270 --> 00:58:51.280 align:start position:0%
transponders uh GPS technology that
 
00:58:54.349 --> 00:58:54.359 align:start position:0%
either goes to um local antennas or up
 
00:58:58.870 --> 00:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
to the cloud um some of the U some
 
00:59:02.150 --> 00:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
cities and towns uh are employing the
 
00:59:06.789 --> 00:59:06.799 align:start position:0%
alternative Technologies at this point
 
00:59:09.670 --> 00:59:09.680 align:start position:0%
um the existing landscape uh under
 
00:59:11.470 --> 00:59:11.480 align:start position:0%
current policy and practice traffic
 
00:59:14.470 --> 00:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
signals on state highways host emergency
 
00:59:17.750 --> 00:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
preemption systems as specified by the
 
00:59:20.069 --> 00:59:20.079 align:start position:0%
respective municipality the choice of
 
00:59:21.789 --> 00:59:21.799 align:start position:0%
the technology is determined by the
 
00:59:24.190 --> 00:59:24.200 align:start position:0%
municipality to ensure compatibility
 
00:59:27.190 --> 00:59:27.200 align:start position:0%
between the vehicle amounted initiators
 
00:59:30.549 --> 00:59:30.559 align:start position:0%
and the system at the traffic signal uh
 
00:59:31.789 --> 00:59:31.799 align:start position:0%
for initial
 
00:59:34.230 --> 00:59:34.240 align:start position:0%
installations um such as a brand new
 
00:59:37.589 --> 00:59:37.599 align:start position:0%
traffic signal the dot includes uh a
 
00:59:40.950 --> 00:59:40.960 align:start position:0%
Tomar or opticom uh traffic signal
 
00:59:43.069 --> 00:59:43.079 align:start position:0%
preemption system as part of the package
 
00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
that's installed um because it's
 
00:59:46.829 --> 00:59:46.839 align:start position:0%
certainly more economical to install it
 
00:59:50.549 --> 00:59:50.559 align:start position:0%
all at once uh this includes the um
 
00:59:52.309 --> 00:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
receivers which are up on the Mast arms
 
00:59:55.750 --> 00:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
near the traffic signal displays uh as
 
00:59:58.109 --> 00:59:58.119 align:start position:0%
well as as the circuitry inside the
 
01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
traffic signal cabinet um however
 
01:00:04.549 --> 01:00:04.559 align:start position:0%
subsequent repair and maintenance of the
 
01:00:07.109 --> 01:00:07.119 align:start position:0%
systems testing um falls to the
 
01:00:08.910 --> 01:00:08.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the
 
01:00:13.829 --> 01:00:13.839 align:start position:0%
municipality um in practice uh the use
 
01:00:16.270 --> 01:00:16.280 align:start position:0%
and investment uh by municipalities and
 
01:00:18.510 --> 01:00:18.520 align:start position:0%
Signal preemption varies widely across
 
01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
the towns in the state some towns don't
 
01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
need it some don't use it uh some have
 
01:00:26.470 --> 01:00:26.480 align:start position:0%
one signal in town uh
 
01:00:30.589 --> 01:00:30.599 align:start position:0%
um and they you know not participate and
 
01:00:33.390 --> 01:00:33.400 align:start position:0%
then other locations city of conquer
 
01:00:36.270 --> 01:00:36.280 align:start position:0%
Manchester Nashua which have their own
 
01:00:39.829 --> 01:00:39.839 align:start position:0%
traffic signal um Crews for their o for
 
01:00:42.549 --> 01:00:42.559 align:start position:0%
their municipally owned signals um
 
01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
maintain their systems um and make full
 
01:00:49.549 --> 01:00:49.559 align:start position:0%
use of the capabilities of these systems
 
01:00:52.309 --> 01:00:52.319 align:start position:0%
so we see a wide range across the
 
01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:54.720 align:start position:0%
state uh I believe Nashua has just
 
01:00:57.549 --> 01:00:57.559 align:start position:0%
transitioned to a alternative technology
 
01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
using um GPS and um transponders that
 
01:01:06.190 --> 01:01:06.200 align:start position:0%
communicate to to the cloud and uh that
 
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
allow the system to understand where all
 
01:01:10.670 --> 01:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
the vehicles are and how they're
 
01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
approaching different intersections and
 
01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
it's uh much more of a smart intelligent
 
01:01:19.829 --> 01:01:19.839 align:start position:0%
system um than the than the opticom
 
01:01:24.069 --> 01:01:24.079 align:start position:0%
which is um you know essentially uh
 
01:01:25.589 --> 01:01:25.599 align:start position:0%
pushing a button saying I want to come
 
01:01:26.910 --> 01:01:26.920 align:start position:0%
through this this
 
01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:31.029 align:start position:0%
through this this
intersection

01:01:31.029 --> 01:01:31.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:34.670 --> 01:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
um so as I said it has been policy since
 
01:01:37.829 --> 01:01:37.839 align:start position:0%
these have been in use that the uh
 
01:01:39.990 --> 01:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities are responsible for
 
01:01:42.270 --> 01:01:42.280 align:start position:0%
maintenance of the systems uh the
 
01:01:44.309 --> 01:01:44.319 align:start position:0%
department does assist municipalities
 
01:01:47.109 --> 01:01:47.119 align:start position:0%
where they can um however when it comes
 
01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
to purchasing equipment or replacement
 
01:01:52.990 --> 01:01:53.000 align:start position:0%
parts um we we work with the
 
01:01:56.230 --> 01:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
municipality for to get that from them
 
01:01:57.670 --> 01:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
uh and have things
 
01:02:03.230 --> 01:02:03.240 align:start position:0%
installed um the um where we can uh as
 
01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
as available we do provide assistance
 
01:02:07.549 --> 01:02:07.559 align:start position:0%
with troubleshooting and getting systems
 
01:02:09.870 --> 01:02:09.880 align:start position:0%
back back in line like I said some
 
01:02:14.710 --> 01:02:14.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities have a uh full traffic
 
01:02:17.390 --> 01:02:17.400 align:start position:0%
signal uh work crew that is very
 
01:02:19.230 --> 01:02:19.240 align:start position:0%
familiar with these systems other
 
01:02:21.549 --> 01:02:21.559 align:start position:0%
municipalities do not and rely just on
 
01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
their their highway road agent in some
 
01:02:26.069 --> 01:02:26.079 align:start position:0%
cases uh in which case we need to
 
01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
provide more more expertise to
 
01:02:32.589 --> 01:02:32.599 align:start position:0%
assist um so the proposed legislation
 
01:02:33.870 --> 01:02:33.880 align:start position:0%
specifies the Department of
 
01:02:35.510 --> 01:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
Transportation would become responsible
 
01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
for the maintenance of the pr uh traffic
 
01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
signal preemption systems um I think the
 
01:02:43.789 --> 01:02:43.799 align:start position:0%
intended benefit is uh consistent
 
01:02:45.029 --> 01:02:45.039 align:start position:0%
performance and maintenance of
 
01:02:48.549 --> 01:02:48.559 align:start position:0%
preemption systems um we prepared a
 
01:02:51.910 --> 01:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal note uh which has been included
 
01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
um some of the key assumptions in that
 
01:02:56.470 --> 01:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
is that we are looking looking at an
 
01:02:59.710 --> 01:02:59.720 align:start position:0%
optical only system uh that we're not um
 
01:03:02.190 --> 01:03:02.200 align:start position:0%
endeavoring to use the higher
 
01:03:04.349 --> 01:03:04.359 align:start position:0%
intelligence systems because of the
 
01:03:07.230 --> 01:03:07.240 align:start position:0%
additional cost and in many cases uh is
 
01:03:11.309 --> 01:03:11.319 align:start position:0%
not uh is not of value to the particular
 
01:03:16.470 --> 01:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
locations um the we have excluded uh any
 
01:03:18.549 --> 01:03:18.559 align:start position:0%
work on the vehicle emitters those are
 
01:03:20.349 --> 01:03:20.359 align:start position:0%
the strobes that are mounted on the
 
01:03:22.510 --> 01:03:22.520 align:start position:0%
emergency vehicles there's a wide
 
01:03:26.029 --> 01:03:26.039 align:start position:0%
variety of mountings and types and uh
 
01:03:28.390 --> 01:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
how they're powered and that is not our
 
01:03:29.789 --> 01:03:29.799 align:start position:0%
business to
 
01:03:32.829 --> 01:03:32.839 align:start position:0%
be um mucking around underneath the
 
01:03:35.470 --> 01:03:35.480 align:start position:0%
dashboard of a fire apparatus or police
 
01:03:37.990 --> 01:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
vehicles um so that was not included in
 
01:03:41.230 --> 01:03:41.240 align:start position:0%
our in our fiscal note um this would
 
01:03:43.870 --> 01:03:43.880 align:start position:0%
create a very significant expansion of
 
01:03:46.829 --> 01:03:46.839 align:start position:0%
workload um we have four traffic signal
 
01:03:50.430 --> 01:03:50.440 align:start position:0%
Crews to serve the the entire State um
 
01:03:52.190 --> 01:03:52.200 align:start position:0%
we estimate that we would need at least
 
01:03:55.789 --> 01:03:55.799 align:start position:0%
one more crew of two plus a vehicle uh
 
01:03:59.230 --> 01:03:59.240 align:start position:0%
to raise raise us up to five Crews uh
 
01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:00.680 align:start position:0%
because of the workload that would be
 
01:04:04.029 --> 01:04:04.039 align:start position:0%
involved in in maintaining these systems
 
01:04:05.910 --> 01:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
and we've also assumed that this would
 
01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
only apply to signals owned and
 
01:04:10.069 --> 01:04:10.079 align:start position:0%
maintained by the by the state not the
 
01:04:14.069 --> 01:04:14.079 align:start position:0%
municipal um signals so in summary the
 
01:04:17.109 --> 01:04:17.119 align:start position:0%
advantages uh that I that I see are
 
01:04:19.750 --> 01:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
Consolidated responsibility it would
 
01:04:22.069 --> 01:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
involve U would allow for centralized
 
01:04:24.670 --> 01:04:24.680 align:start position:0%
training to a limited number of people
 
01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:27.240 align:start position:0%
um so that that each municipality didn't
 
01:04:29.990 --> 01:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
have to have uh someone knowledgeable or
 
01:04:33.069 --> 01:04:33.079 align:start position:0%
hire a contractor to to do the work uh
 
01:04:35.309 --> 01:04:35.319 align:start position:0%
it would help provide some consistent uh
 
01:04:39.029 --> 01:04:39.039 align:start position:0%
level of Maintenance of the systems um
 
01:04:40.789 --> 01:04:40.799 align:start position:0%
and that would be an improvement for
 
01:04:43.870 --> 01:04:43.880 align:start position:0%
many communities um who either don't or
 
01:04:46.390 --> 01:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
are unable to maintain their systems
 
01:04:50.750 --> 01:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
however it would also probably lower the
 
01:04:52.549 --> 01:04:52.559 align:start position:0%
uh you know the attention in some
 
01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities where uh they have the
 
01:04:58.829 --> 01:04:58.839 align:start position:0%
capability and interest uh in that
 
01:05:02.549 --> 01:05:02.559 align:start position:0%
investment um and it basically brings
 
01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
everybody to a Level Playing Field uh
 
01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
some of the drawbacks of the systems um
 
01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
there are there will still remain
 
01:05:13.109 --> 01:05:13.119 align:start position:0%
operational challenges um these systems
 
01:05:16.670 --> 01:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
are um can be Troublesome uh and it
 
01:05:19.109 --> 01:05:19.119 align:start position:0%
takes quite a quite a bit of effort to
 
01:05:22.710 --> 01:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
get these optimize to work um you think
 
01:05:25.190 --> 01:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
about it you're you're transmitting a
 
01:05:29.589 --> 01:05:29.599 align:start position:0%
flash ing uh light or a uh flashing Al
 
01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
um uh infrared uh emitter at a point way
 
01:05:36.910 --> 01:05:36.920 align:start position:0%
down the at the end of the block on this
 
01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:40.079 align:start position:0%
little thing that sits up on top of a
 
01:05:42.349 --> 01:05:42.359 align:start position:0%
intersection um You've Got Dirt you've
 
01:05:44.670 --> 01:05:44.680 align:start position:0%
got we we see a lot of spider nests that
 
01:05:47.190 --> 01:05:47.200 align:start position:0%
get into these uh detectors uh that
 
01:05:49.309 --> 01:05:49.319 align:start position:0%
block those signals you've got potential
 
01:05:52.470 --> 01:05:52.480 align:start position:0%
wire disconnections uh issues with the
 
01:05:55.230 --> 01:05:55.240 align:start position:0%
card um there's a lot of things that can
 
01:05:57.390 --> 01:05:57.400 align:start position:0%
that can go wrong with these systems uh
 
01:06:00.630 --> 01:06:00.640 align:start position:0%
so I don't want anyone to have um the
 
01:06:03.789 --> 01:06:03.799 align:start position:0%
illusion that um magically everything is
 
01:06:08.309 --> 01:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
going to work uh every time all the time
 
01:06:11.230 --> 01:06:11.240 align:start position:0%
um this will another drawback is the
 
01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:13.480 align:start position:0%
amount of workload that this will add as
 
01:06:15.269 --> 01:06:15.279 align:start position:0%
well as the potential liability for the
 
01:06:20.029 --> 01:06:20.039 align:start position:0%
State uh if if the uh a crash occurs and
 
01:06:24.390 --> 01:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
there's question of whether the um the
 
01:06:26.190 --> 01:06:26.200 align:start position:0%
uh preemption system was operating
 
01:06:28.670 --> 01:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
properly uh we already have liability
 
01:06:30.630 --> 01:06:30.640 align:start position:0%
with maintaining the traffic signals
 
01:06:33.069 --> 01:06:33.079 align:start position:0%
themselves uh this com you know adds
 
01:06:37.109 --> 01:06:37.119 align:start position:0%
adds an additional level to that um the
 
01:06:39.789 --> 01:06:39.799 align:start position:0%
response to concerns will be prioritized
 
01:06:42.670 --> 01:06:42.680 align:start position:0%
at a Statewide level um essentially it's
 
01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
taking it out of local control uh you
 
01:06:47.309 --> 01:06:47.319 align:start position:0%
know the um you know the town of
 
01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
Smithville um may have someone who has a
 
01:06:51.670 --> 01:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
great deal of interest in there opticom
 
01:06:54.870 --> 01:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
and would jump on any issues immediately
 
01:06:57.710 --> 01:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
um if it's at the state level we have to
 
01:07:01.230 --> 01:07:01.240 align:start position:0%
assess uh and prioritize our work uh to
 
01:07:02.990 --> 01:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
deal with traffic signals throughout the
 
01:07:05.349 --> 01:07:05.359 align:start position:0%
state and so that may not get the
 
01:07:07.470 --> 01:07:07.480 align:start position:0%
attention that the town of smithmill
 
01:07:09.470 --> 01:07:09.480 align:start position:0%
might be interested in now I hope that's
 
01:07:12.990 --> 01:07:13.000 align:start position:0%
a fictitious town I didn't mean to imply
 
01:07:16.710 --> 01:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
any particular Town um one approach may
 
01:07:18.870 --> 01:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
not work for all municipalities as I as
 
01:07:22.990 --> 01:07:23.000 align:start position:0%
I mentioned Nashua has uh taken on a a
 
01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
an intelligence system um that has many
 
01:07:28.789 --> 01:07:28.799 align:start position:0%
many capabilities that work work very
 
01:07:31.069 --> 01:07:31.079 align:start position:0%
well for them um that is not something
 
01:07:33.230 --> 01:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
that we would necessarily be able to
 
01:07:37.150 --> 01:07:37.160 align:start position:0%
provide um for every municipality that
 
01:07:40.029 --> 01:07:40.039 align:start position:0%
that wants such a system um the
 
01:07:42.390 --> 01:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
municipal signals would not be part of
 
01:07:45.630 --> 01:07:45.640 align:start position:0%
this effort so there could still be um
 
01:07:48.510 --> 01:07:48.520 align:start position:0%
gaps in maintenance depending on how
 
01:07:50.589 --> 01:07:50.599 align:start position:0%
thorough the municipality is with with
 
01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
work on their own signals and also the
 
01:07:55.589 --> 01:07:55.599 align:start position:0%
municipalities and responder agencies
 
01:07:58.269 --> 01:07:58.279 align:start position:0%
would still be responsible for their um
 
01:07:59.589 --> 01:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
equipment on their
 
01:08:01.950 --> 01:08:01.960 align:start position:0%
vehicles so I'll stop there and I'll
 
01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
take questions Mr chairman thank you Mr
 
01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
Bron before I recognize anybody else I
 
01:08:09.950 --> 01:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
just want to uh make sure I heard this
 
01:08:11.870 --> 01:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
correctly that the current system right
 
01:08:15.670 --> 01:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
now is that after the municipality
 
01:08:17.669 --> 01:08:17.679 align:start position:0%
decides that they're going to install
 
01:08:20.709 --> 01:08:20.719 align:start position:0%
this system that they maintain it
 
01:08:22.669 --> 01:08:22.679 align:start position:0%
whether it's on a state road or not
 
01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
because it's in their municipality they
 
01:08:27.510 --> 01:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
may maintain it right now that's the
 
01:08:29.669 --> 01:08:29.679 align:start position:0%
current procedure so if anything goes
 
01:08:30.749 --> 01:08:30.759 align:start position:0%
wrong so
 
01:08:33.829 --> 01:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
you basically don't maintain any of
 
01:08:37.269 --> 01:08:37.279 align:start position:0%
these right now on state roads correct
 
01:08:39.990 --> 01:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
we we are not responsible we do assist
 
01:08:44.030 --> 01:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
when requested by towns um some are very
 
01:08:45.950 --> 01:08:45.960 align:start position:0%
capable and don't need our assistance
 
01:08:49.110 --> 01:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
others um others do okay thank you
 
01:08:51.030 --> 01:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
representative clud here okay thank you
 
01:08:54.309 --> 01:08:54.319 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman a question in the bill uh
 
01:08:56.269 --> 01:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 2
 
01:08:58.590 --> 01:08:58.600 align:start position:0%
on lines 11 through 13 it says the
 
01:09:00.189 --> 01:09:00.199 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation shall
 
01:09:01.630 --> 01:09:01.640 align:start position:0%
include in its
 
01:09:05.590 --> 01:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
banal budget requests under RSA 9 col 4
 
01:09:07.990 --> 01:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
funding for any administrative cost
 
01:09:09.669 --> 01:09:09.679 align:start position:0%
related to the maintenance of traffic
 
01:09:12.149 --> 01:09:12.159 align:start position:0%
signal preemption technology systems
 
01:09:14.510 --> 01:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
used for emergency vehicles could you
 
01:09:17.470 --> 01:09:17.480 align:start position:0%
explain briefly uh what administrative
 
01:09:19.870 --> 01:09:19.880 align:start position:0%
costs mean I'm a little bit I'm whole on
 
01:09:23.789 --> 01:09:23.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:26.590 --> 01:09:26.600 align:start position:0%
so I am not sure exactly what that
 
01:09:30.590 --> 01:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
refers to as well um there is a uh there
 
01:09:32.950 --> 01:09:32.960 align:start position:0%
is a cost to operating our
 
01:09:37.110 --> 01:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
maintenance um unit at uh at the Bureau
 
01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:40.520 align:start position:0%
of traffic um there's a cost for uh the
 
01:09:43.349 --> 01:09:43.359 align:start position:0%
staff the people the uh oversight the
 
01:09:46.789 --> 01:09:46.799 align:start position:0%
training uh and so forth uh I think
 
01:09:49.630 --> 01:09:49.640 align:start position:0%
expanding um the number of Crews as
 
01:09:53.430 --> 01:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
necessary uh will increase um the
 
01:09:55.550 --> 01:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
overall cost of operation the overhead
 
01:09:58.470 --> 01:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
so to speak um also there will be
 
01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
increased interactions with each of the
 
01:10:03.750 --> 01:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh as we uh go through
 
01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:05.470 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh as we uh go through
and

01:10:05.470 --> 01:10:05.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:10:08.030 --> 01:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
um upgrade the systems bring them up
 
01:10:11.070 --> 01:10:11.080 align:start position:0%
into operation uh to full operation and
 
01:10:13.470 --> 01:10:13.480 align:start position:0%
um kind of like I said level the playing
 
01:10:17.669 --> 01:10:17.679 align:start position:0%
field uh I'm I can't really get into
 
01:10:20.189 --> 01:10:20.199 align:start position:0%
what those costs might be at this point
 
01:10:23.270 --> 01:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure exactly what that refers to
 
01:10:25.350 --> 01:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
follow chairman followup please okay
 
01:10:27.709 --> 01:10:27.719 align:start position:0%
okay yeah a question I know this this
 
01:10:30.350 --> 01:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
bill hasn't become law yet if it be
 
01:10:31.990 --> 01:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
passes it would become law I guess
 
01:10:34.870 --> 01:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
written July 1st of 2025 do you know of
 
01:10:37.590 --> 01:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
any plans that the department has or any
 
01:10:39.590 --> 01:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
requ preliminary requests because I
 
01:10:41.550 --> 01:10:41.560 align:start position:0%
realize the governor hasn't submitted
 
01:10:44.110 --> 01:10:44.120 align:start position:0%
her budget yet about including money in
 
01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
its in its budget request for
 
01:10:49.590 --> 01:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
administrative costs for this not not in
 
01:10:54.590 --> 01:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
response to this this bill um it is um
 
01:10:55.830 --> 01:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
if if it be
 
01:10:59.229 --> 01:10:59.239 align:start position:0%
becomes um we we are we are not
 
01:11:01.110 --> 01:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
financially prepared for the additional
 
01:11:03.750 --> 01:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
burden of of Performing this additional
 
01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
level of work uh without additional
 
01:11:09.350 --> 01:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
funding okay thank
 
01:11:12.030 --> 01:11:12.040 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative Jack uh
 
01:11:13.590 --> 01:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:11:15.790 --> 01:11:15.800 align:start position:0%
coming uh you've been very clear that
 
01:11:17.630 --> 01:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities understand that after the
 
01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
signal is installed they're responsible
 
01:11:22.070 --> 01:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
for maintenance and yet the prime
 
01:11:25.590 --> 01:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
sponsor uh is is issuing a cry for help
 
01:11:27.790 --> 01:11:27.800 align:start position:0%
that the ones on the state roads the
 
01:11:29.630 --> 01:11:29.640 align:start position:0%
maintenance is declining and the
 
01:11:32.270 --> 01:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities work great do we have any
 
01:11:35.709 --> 01:11:35.719 align:start position:0%
either data or can you uh speculate on
 
01:11:38.629 --> 01:11:38.639 align:start position:0%
on how it can be that that that
 
01:11:40.669 --> 01:11:40.679 align:start position:0%
condition that that the maintenance that
 
01:11:42.270 --> 01:11:42.280 align:start position:0%
the town knows they're supposed to do
 
01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:44.350 align:start position:0%
the town knows they're supposed to do
isn't

01:11:44.350 --> 01:11:44.360 align:start position:0%
isn't
 
01:11:46.030 --> 01:11:46.040 align:start position:0%
happening I guess it would be
 
01:11:48.669 --> 01:11:48.679 align:start position:0%
speculation I don't know the particular
 
01:11:50.830 --> 01:11:50.840 align:start position:0%
uh municipality involved and I don't I
 
01:11:52.910 --> 01:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily have the details I
 
01:11:55.709 --> 01:11:55.719 align:start position:0%
don't interact on this topic uh um our
 
01:11:58.189 --> 01:11:58.199 align:start position:0%
signal maintenance Crews interact with
 
01:12:01.270 --> 01:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
the towns um
 
01:12:06.110 --> 01:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
so it's it's easily I would think it
 
01:12:08.790 --> 01:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
could be easily misunderstood that you
 
01:12:12.030 --> 01:12:12.040 align:start position:0%
know a a state-owned signal uh you
 
01:12:13.950 --> 01:12:13.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily expect that a
 
01:12:16.590 --> 01:12:16.600 align:start position:0%
municipality would have responsibility
 
01:12:20.470 --> 01:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
for parts of it um it in our business
 
01:12:24.350 --> 01:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
it's not unusual but it you know it it I
 
01:12:27.070 --> 01:12:27.080 align:start position:0%
I I I'm not surprised if if there's a
 
01:12:29.310 --> 01:12:29.320 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding um but that is a it has
 
01:12:31.310 --> 01:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
been a long-standing policy established
 
01:12:33.229 --> 01:12:33.239 align:start position:0%
when we first started dealing with
 
01:12:37.709 --> 01:12:37.719 align:start position:0%
opticom and preemption um and it may be
 
01:12:40.910 --> 01:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
the municipalities are not aware and so
 
01:12:43.189 --> 01:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
as as issues come up we we try to make
 
01:12:46.310 --> 01:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
them aware share
 
01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:47.830 align:start position:0%
them aware share
that

01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:12:50.229 --> 01:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
followup uh if that's the case can we do
 
01:12:52.790 --> 01:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
some Outreach to the towns and the fire
 
01:12:54.830 --> 01:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
departments to make sure they know who
 
01:12:56.070 --> 01:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to be reporting
 
01:12:57.750 --> 01:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
problems to and who's responsible for
 
01:13:01.149 --> 01:13:01.159 align:start position:0%
fixing them yes we can do that yep thank
 
01:13:02.709 --> 01:13:02.719 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:13:05.189 --> 01:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
Boger thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:13:06.990 --> 01:13:07.000 align:start position:0%
you for taking my
 
01:13:10.910 --> 01:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
question when y'all install U when
 
01:13:12.470 --> 01:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
there's road work done and you're going
 
01:13:15.430 --> 01:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
to install a new signal system in the
 
01:13:18.310 --> 01:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
town asked y'all to add this Opticon
 
01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:19.629 align:start position:0%
town asked y'all to add this Opticon
type

01:13:19.629 --> 01:13:19.639 align:start position:0%
type
 
01:13:22.790 --> 01:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
thing y'all do a memorandum of
 
01:13:24.910 --> 01:13:24.920 align:start position:0%
understanding on the scope of the work
 
01:13:27.390 --> 01:13:27.400 align:start position:0%
that being done and the
 
01:13:30.030 --> 01:13:30.040 align:start position:0%
responsibilities thereof and is it
 
01:13:33.709 --> 01:13:33.719 align:start position:0%
spelled out in the I call it memorandum
 
01:13:37.110 --> 01:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
of understanding which takes care of who
 
01:13:39.510 --> 01:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
does what and who's responsible for what
 
01:13:41.830 --> 01:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
and what not would that not have been
 
01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
spelled out in that document yeah there
 
01:13:50.790 --> 01:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
was um we have um a history of varying
 
01:13:55.310 --> 01:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
levels of documentation in the past um
 
01:13:58.629 --> 01:13:58.639 align:start position:0%
we now all projects have Municipal
 
01:14:00.709 --> 01:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
agreements U that are part of the
 
01:14:02.910 --> 01:14:02.920 align:start position:0%
project so if work is being done within
 
01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:03.590 align:start position:0%
project so if work is being done within
a

01:14:03.590 --> 01:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:14:06.629 --> 01:14:06.639 align:start position:0%
municipality um all these items are
 
01:14:08.950 --> 01:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
detailed um
 
01:14:11.149 --> 01:14:11.159 align:start position:0%
historically uh I can't say that that
 
01:14:15.270 --> 01:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
has been done um back in the original um
 
01:14:17.910 --> 01:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
days that you know handshakes and
 
01:14:20.629 --> 01:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
understandings um you know life was a
 
01:14:23.950 --> 01:14:23.960 align:start position:0%
bit simpler then and uh uh you know
 
01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
going back and EST lishing those those
 
01:14:28.510 --> 01:14:28.520 align:start position:0%
agreements is not hasn't been
 
01:14:31.470 --> 01:14:31.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily a um a mission that we've
 
01:14:33.669 --> 01:14:33.679 align:start position:0%
we've had so we've you know we deal with
 
01:14:36.189 --> 01:14:36.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:38.990 --> 01:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
forward followup
 
01:14:42.030 --> 01:14:42.040 align:start position:0%
please and as you follow up and do
 
01:14:44.510 --> 01:14:44.520 align:start position:0%
upgrades and stuff that would fall under
 
01:14:47.390 --> 01:14:47.400 align:start position:0%
that memorandum uh at that point when
 
01:14:49.629 --> 01:14:49.639 align:start position:0%
y'all do your upgrades and stuff to
 
01:14:51.590 --> 01:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
something that's existing and that way
 
01:14:55.629 --> 01:14:55.639 align:start position:0%
you can catch up from past to the
 
01:14:58.910 --> 01:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
present ye yes we do when when there's
 
01:15:01.270 --> 01:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
um projects that are done and traffic
 
01:15:03.950 --> 01:15:03.960 align:start position:0%
signals have very long lives uh so it's
 
01:15:06.590 --> 01:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
not often that one is removed and
 
01:15:10.030 --> 01:15:10.040 align:start position:0%
completely replaced um we we have them
 
01:15:13.310 --> 01:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
added um but generally the existing
 
01:15:16.390 --> 01:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
intersections don't see too much work um
 
01:15:20.189 --> 01:15:20.199 align:start position:0%
so as new new projects come in and take
 
01:15:22.590 --> 01:15:22.600 align:start position:0%
um establish new traffic signals that's
 
01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
part of the the maintenance agreements
 
01:15:28.590 --> 01:15:28.600 align:start position:0%
do we have any other further questions
 
01:15:30.910 --> 01:15:30.920 align:start position:0%
representative jurus thank you Mr
 
01:15:32.669 --> 01:15:32.679 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for being here
 
01:15:35.790 --> 01:15:35.800 align:start position:0%
today might I understand that the in a
 
01:15:40.270 --> 01:15:40.280 align:start position:0%
situation where a a town takes care of a
 
01:15:42.430 --> 01:15:42.440 align:start position:0%
traffic opticom
 
01:15:48.350 --> 01:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
system uh that signal case be um it it's
 
01:15:51.990 --> 01:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
being uh accessed by those by the town
 
01:15:53.709 --> 01:15:53.719 align:start position:0%
but that signal case is owned by the
 
01:15:55.550 --> 01:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
01:15:58.390 --> 01:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
correct the the signal cabinet uh the
 
01:16:00.110 --> 01:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
silver or black cabinet on the side of
 
01:16:04.110 --> 01:16:04.120 align:start position:0%
the road in the corner um is is property
 
01:16:07.910 --> 01:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
of the State uh the within that cabinet
 
01:16:09.950 --> 01:16:09.960 align:start position:0%
would be components that are provided by
 
01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:10.629 align:start position:0%
would be components that are provided by
the

01:16:10.629 --> 01:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
town um so if an OP if a preemption
 
01:16:16.510 --> 01:16:16.520 align:start position:0%
system were added to a traffic signal
 
01:16:18.750 --> 01:16:18.760 align:start position:0%
after the initial construction uh that
 
01:16:20.750 --> 01:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
would be in there uh and like I said
 
01:16:23.350 --> 01:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
when we do new signals we include it as
 
01:16:26.030 --> 01:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
part of the project um but that becomes
 
01:16:29.030 --> 01:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
part of uh the municipality's
 
01:16:30.790 --> 01:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
responsibility okay and just a quick
 
01:16:34.030 --> 01:16:34.040 align:start position:0%
followup thank you Mr chairman uh does
 
01:16:36.430 --> 01:16:36.440 align:start position:0%
the municipality alert you or is there
 
01:16:39.470 --> 01:16:39.480 align:start position:0%
an alarm or something that feeds back to
 
01:16:41.270 --> 01:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
a control point that says somebody's in
 
01:16:45.750 --> 01:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
that case other than your technicians in
 
01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
in the signal crew of the State of New
 
01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire generally they contact us for
 
01:16:55.350 --> 01:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
access to the cabinets um the
 
01:16:57.750 --> 01:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
there to answer your question no there's
 
01:16:59.750 --> 01:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
not some sort of indication that someone
 
01:17:02.110 --> 01:17:02.120 align:start position:0%
else is in the cabinets um that's a
 
01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:04.760 align:start position:0%
that's another issue um different topic

out and meet them and then they learn
 
01:17:48.550 --> 01:17:48.560 align:start position:0%
together um sometimes we can help them
 
01:17:50.470 --> 01:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
and they can help us understand what
 
01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:51.709 align:start position:0%
and they can help us understand what
they're

01:17:51.709 --> 01:17:51.719 align:start position:0%

department thank you
 
01:20:41.030 --> 01:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
um we oppose this particular bill um
 
01:20:43.830 --> 01:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
Conway Scenic Railroad has 57 miles of
 
01:20:45.550 --> 01:20:45.560 align:start position:0%
track that they negotiate with the New
 
01:20:47.270 --> 01:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of
 
01:20:49.990 --> 01:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
Transportation we get no subsidy and and
 
01:20:52.910 --> 01:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
no funds uh to operate that with the
 
01:20:55.709 --> 01:20:55.719 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire we uh operate it
 
01:20:57.669 --> 01:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
at our own expense and take care of the
 
01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:01.199 align:start position:0%
work that needs to be done the train
 
01:21:05.350 --> 01:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
this year or in 2024 carried 150,000
 
01:21:08.790 --> 01:21:08.800 align:start position:0%
passengers it's doubled since 19 uh I
 
01:21:14.270 --> 01:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
mean 2018 when uh the SS um took
 
01:21:18.510 --> 01:21:18.520 align:start position:0%
over we employ 76 to 80 people full-time
 
01:21:20.790 --> 01:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
and we never lay anyone off in the
 
01:21:23.870 --> 01:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
winter or during a slow season everybody
 
01:21:27.430 --> 01:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
continues to get their pay salary or a
 
01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
minimum of their 40
 
01:21:32.350 --> 01:21:32.360 align:start position:0%
hours we oppose it because this
 
01:21:35.149 --> 01:21:35.159 align:start position:0%
particular bill in section or line four
 
01:21:39.510 --> 01:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
through 8 for example um to assess the
 
01:21:41.830 --> 01:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
costs and incomes related to the removal
 
01:21:44.669 --> 01:21:44.679 align:start position:0%
of rail and ties were necessary to
 
01:21:47.110 --> 01:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
provide a level safe surface for
 
01:21:49.149 --> 01:21:49.159 align:start position:0%
recreational activities on the existing
 
01:21:49.159 --> 01:21:50.229 align:start position:0%
recreational activities on the existing
track

01:21:50.229 --> 01:21:50.239 align:start position:0%
track
 
01:21:52.709 --> 01:21:52.719 align:start position:0%
bed well I'll give you an example once
 
01:21:54.870 --> 01:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
the tracks are gone that's very diff ult
 
01:21:57.310 --> 01:21:57.320 align:start position:0%
to put them back and you in this state
 
01:21:59.270 --> 01:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
are very fortunate to have some
 
01:22:02.070 --> 01:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
wonderful train operators you have
 
01:22:04.189 --> 01:22:04.199 align:start position:0%
private sector that offer tours which is
 
01:22:07.550 --> 01:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
a huge economic impact to your state and
 
01:22:10.830 --> 01:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
now with the new operation of CSX taking
 
01:22:13.270 --> 01:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
over from PanAm is a better partner for
 
01:22:16.870 --> 01:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
most people and other rail programs that
 
01:22:20.870 --> 01:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
take uh that operate here in your great
 
01:22:24.229 --> 01:22:24.239 align:start position:0%
state that Conway Branch uh believe it
 
01:22:26.669 --> 01:22:26.679 align:start position:0%
or not goes all the way to
 
01:22:29.430 --> 01:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
Portland um and it's called the mountain
 
01:22:32.790 --> 01:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
division so Conway Scenic has to the
 
01:22:36.669 --> 01:22:36.679 align:start position:0%
fryberg line fryberg Maine for example
 
01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:41.800 align:start position:0%
has a great uh Trail and train
 
01:22:45.030 --> 01:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
track uh setup the trail runs next to
 
01:22:47.189 --> 01:22:47.199 align:start position:0%
the tracks so that if they were ever
 
01:22:48.629 --> 01:22:48.639 align:start position:0%
needed which they're not being operated
 
01:22:49.629 --> 01:22:49.639 align:start position:0%
on right
 
01:22:53.709 --> 01:22:53.719 align:start position:0%
now and uh um it's a great working
 
01:22:57.510 --> 01:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
relationship fryberg did an amazing job
 
01:22:59.750 --> 01:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
other communities in Maine once the
 
01:23:02.510 --> 01:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
smaller communities have found out that
 
01:23:05.070 --> 01:23:05.080 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of the trails is
 
01:23:07.830 --> 01:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
their town to upkeep have become
 
01:23:09.790 --> 01:23:09.800 align:start position:0%
concerned because they have to plow it
 
01:23:11.310 --> 01:23:11.320 align:start position:0%
they have to mow the grass they have to
 
01:23:12.990 --> 01:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
pick up the trash put out the
 
01:23:15.070 --> 01:23:15.080 align:start position:0%
receptacles all that sort of thing cuz
 
01:23:18.189 --> 01:23:18.199 align:start position:0%
in Maine for example the do or Trails
 
01:23:20.910 --> 01:23:20.920 align:start position:0%
folks do not take responsibility of
 
01:23:23.830 --> 01:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
cleaning up or tending to the trail so I
 
01:23:25.310 --> 01:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
don't know what that circumstance would
 
01:23:26.750 --> 01:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
be here in the great state of New
 
01:23:28.470 --> 01:23:28.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but that's been a bon of
 
01:23:30.750 --> 01:23:30.760 align:start position:0%
contention for some of the smaller folks
 
01:23:32.709 --> 01:23:32.719 align:start position:0%
a smaller communities just because some
 
01:23:34.790 --> 01:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
of them only have one or two employees
 
01:23:36.950 --> 01:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
that are in their Highway
 
01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:39.510 align:start position:0%
that are in their Highway
division

01:23:39.510 --> 01:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
division
 
01:23:42.590 --> 01:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
so the Environmental Protection
 
01:23:46.310 --> 01:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
Agency says that we produce trains that
 
01:23:50.550 --> 01:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
offer Freight and passenger rail service
 
01:23:53.629 --> 01:23:53.639 align:start position:0%
1.7% of greenhouse gas admissions
 
01:23:58.669 --> 01:23:58.679 align:start position:0%
compared to 58.5 produced by cars 23.4
 
01:24:00.750 --> 01:24:00.760 align:start position:0%
produced by trucks in the United
 
01:24:03.510 --> 01:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
States passenger rail is even Greener
 
01:24:06.550 --> 01:24:06.560 align:start position:0%
coming in at 0. 2% in general moving
 
01:24:08.830 --> 01:24:08.840 align:start position:0%
Freight by rail instead of trucks
 
01:24:11.430 --> 01:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
reduces our admissions by
 
01:24:14.229 --> 01:24:14.239 align:start position:0%
75% the time is now to maintain and
 
01:24:16.709 --> 01:24:16.719 align:start position:0%
develop rail infr in
 
01:24:18.550 --> 01:24:18.560 align:start position:0%
infrastructure so that we can build
 
01:24:21.629 --> 01:24:21.639 align:start position:0%
towards a stronger and Greener
 
01:24:24.990 --> 01:24:25.000 align:start position:0%
future railroads are secured considered
 
01:24:26.709 --> 01:24:26.719 align:start position:0%
secure infrastructure which
 
01:24:28.790 --> 01:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
significantly benefits any Property
 
01:24:31.510 --> 01:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
Owners adjacent to the track and I
 
01:24:34.550 --> 01:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh the abutters um Express
 
01:24:37.629 --> 01:24:37.639 align:start position:0%
great con concern about creating free
 
01:24:40.629 --> 01:24:40.639 align:start position:0%
access to the trail systems because
 
01:24:43.470 --> 01:24:43.480 align:start position:0%
again I use Maine it becomes a homeless
 
01:24:46.790 --> 01:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
Highway and that's where tent cities and
 
01:24:49.629 --> 01:24:49.639 align:start position:0%
that s things start to start to
 
01:24:54.669 --> 01:24:54.679 align:start position:0%
develop so New Hampshire has a lot
 
01:24:56.470 --> 01:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
of great operators that are in the
 
01:24:59.189 --> 01:24:59.199 align:start position:0%
railroad business whether it be Scenic
 
01:24:59.199 --> 01:25:00.229 align:start position:0%
railroad business whether it be Scenic
or

01:25:00.229 --> 01:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:25:04.390 --> 01:25:04.400 align:start position:0%
commercial um committees to review and
 
01:25:08.510 --> 01:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
to do studies always cost a lot of money
 
01:25:11.189 --> 01:25:11.199 align:start position:0%
and you seem to have a system right now
 
01:25:15.310 --> 01:25:15.320 align:start position:0%
if it ain't broke don't fix it so um we
 
01:25:18.270 --> 01:25:18.280 align:start position:0%

committee seeing none thank you for your
 
01:25:33.030 --> 01:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
testimony sir thank
 
01:25:35.470 --> 01:25:35.480 align:start position:0%
you at this point in time I'd like to
 
01:25:40.669 --> 01:25:40.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:44.510 --> 01:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
please welcome to Public Works long time
 
01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:45.669 align:start position:0%
please welcome to Public Works long time
no

01:25:45.669 --> 01:25:45.679 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:25:48.430 --> 01:25:48.440 align:start position:0%
see I think I'll be here a lot so thank
 
01:25:50.750 --> 01:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
you so for the matter of the record my
 
01:25:52.390 --> 01:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
name is Shelley Winters I'm the director
 
01:25:53.950 --> 01:25:53.960 align:start position:0%
of the division of Aeronautics Rail and
 
01:25:55.790 --> 01:25:55.800 align:start position:0%
trans at the Department of
 
01:25:58.390 --> 01:25:58.400 align:start position:0%
Transportation um here just to provide
 
01:26:01.149 --> 01:26:01.159 align:start position:0%
some um maybe some testimony some some
 
01:26:03.030 --> 01:26:03.040 align:start position:0%
background of perhaps for your
 
01:26:04.669 --> 01:26:04.679 align:start position:0%
consideration about the duplicative
 
01:26:07.709 --> 01:26:07.719 align:start position:0%
nature of this in comparison to House
 
01:26:10.950 --> 01:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
Bill 1468 that was was passed last year
 
01:26:13.590 --> 01:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
and directing the department to work
 
01:26:16.910 --> 01:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
through a process uh to develop a a
 
01:26:18.629 --> 01:26:18.639 align:start position:0%
Planning Group to look at the Conway
 
01:26:21.790 --> 01:26:21.800 align:start position:0%
Branch so the state owns 21 miles of the
 
01:26:24.430 --> 01:26:24.440 align:start position:0%
Conway Branch it does connect uh new
 
01:26:26.350 --> 01:26:26.360 align:start position:0%
North Coast and active freight line to
 
01:26:28.990 --> 01:26:29.000 align:start position:0%
con weic um who are a great partner to
 
01:26:31.750 --> 01:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
us last year under house bill 1468 and
 
01:26:33.149 --> 01:26:33.159 align:start position:0%
we delivered the report to the governor
 
01:26:35.669 --> 01:26:35.679 align:start position:0%
and executive Council and and members of
 
01:26:37.149 --> 01:26:37.159 align:start position:0%
this committee earlier this year in
 
01:26:39.750 --> 01:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
January we convened a Planning Group to
 
01:26:42.669 --> 01:26:42.679 align:start position:0%
look at the the best use and best value
 
01:26:44.990 --> 01:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
to the state currently for the 21 miles
 
01:26:48.030 --> 01:26:48.040 align:start position:0%
of State own Corridor and um can submit
 
01:26:50.229 --> 01:26:50.239 align:start position:0%
a copy of of the report for the record
 
01:26:52.070 --> 01:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
and and for you to share but essentially
 
01:26:53.669 --> 01:26:53.679 align:start position:0%
the outcome of that was that based on
 
01:26:56.709 --> 01:26:56.719 align:start position:0%
the public input and participation from
 
01:26:58.709 --> 01:26:58.719 align:start position:0%
members of the public communities
 
01:27:00.830 --> 01:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
through which this Corridor goes and
 
01:27:04.270 --> 01:27:04.280 align:start position:0%
elected officials is that um it should
 
01:27:05.870 --> 01:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
be used for an interim use as a
 
01:27:08.470 --> 01:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
recreational rail trail so the
 
01:27:09.910 --> 01:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation and the
 
01:27:11.270 --> 01:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Natural and cultural
 
01:27:13.990 --> 01:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
resources of which um one of my cohorts
 
01:27:16.310 --> 01:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
is here we are in the process of
 
01:27:18.390 --> 01:27:18.400 align:start position:0%
effectuating a transfer of the
 
01:27:22.030 --> 01:27:22.040 align:start position:0%
management of the 21 miles from do to
 
01:27:25.070 --> 01:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
dncr and then dncr would be working
 
01:27:29.109 --> 01:27:29.119 align:start position:0%
through their normal process of um rail
 
01:27:31.070 --> 01:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
to Trail conversion and and what that
 
01:27:32.270 --> 01:27:32.280 align:start position:0%
would look like we don't know how that
 
01:27:34.390 --> 01:27:34.400 align:start position:0%
will play out over time but uh we
 
01:27:37.990 --> 01:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
believe that uh you know the the product
 
01:27:39.629 --> 01:27:39.639 align:start position:0%
has been delivered and the wheels are in
 
01:27:41.550 --> 01:27:41.560 align:start position:0%
motion to go to governor and Council by
 
01:27:43.510 --> 01:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
by March so by and large we've gone
 
01:27:44.950 --> 01:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
through a public process with public
 
01:27:48.149 --> 01:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
meetings um stakeholders convened and um
 
01:27:50.270 --> 01:27:50.280 align:start position:0%
the department will retain uh a
 
01:27:52.470 --> 01:27:52.480 align:start position:0%
reversionary clause so if in the future
 
01:27:54.629 --> 01:27:54.639 align:start position:0%
funds should be availed for rail or
 
01:27:57.229 --> 01:27:57.239 align:start position:0%
other more mass transportation uses the
 
01:27:58.990 --> 01:27:59.000 align:start position:0%
state will still own this property it
 
01:28:00.750 --> 01:28:00.760 align:start position:0%
will just be the day-to-day management
 
01:28:04.430 --> 01:28:04.440 align:start position:0%
will be deferred to dncr and the interim
 
01:28:07.310 --> 01:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
use will be recreational uh recreational
 
01:28:10.189 --> 01:28:10.199 align:start position:0%
is not a game or a mode or what the
 
01:28:12.350 --> 01:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation normally
 
01:28:14.470 --> 01:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
does so again we wanted to give it to
 
01:28:16.790 --> 01:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
our sister agency who could better work
 
01:28:18.590 --> 01:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
with the the users and the funding
 
01:28:21.229 --> 01:28:21.239 align:start position:0%
sources that support that so um with
 
01:28:24.510 --> 01:28:24.520 align:start position:0%
that I'm happy to take any questions
 
01:28:28.149 --> 01:28:28.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr MERS uh representative Jack
 
01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:28:31.709 --> 01:28:31.719 align:start position:0%
for appearing uh starting on line 12
 
01:28:33.669 --> 01:28:33.679 align:start position:0%
this bill also establishes a general
 
01:28:36.189 --> 01:28:36.199 align:start position:0%
study committee to study rail uh if I'm
 
01:28:38.390 --> 01:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
not mistaken we have a state rail plan
 
01:28:42.070 --> 01:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
and wouldn't that also be uh somewhat
 
01:28:44.149 --> 01:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
duplicative that's another good point
 
01:28:46.229 --> 01:28:46.239 align:start position:0%
yes sir uh so right now the department
 
01:28:49.070 --> 01:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
is um updating its state rail plan it
 
01:28:51.109 --> 01:28:51.119 align:start position:0%
was last done in about
 
01:28:54.109 --> 01:28:54.119 align:start position:0%
2012 we're in the midst of uh public
 
01:28:55.310 --> 01:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
hearings and meetings for that in a
 
01:28:56.990 --> 01:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
stakeholder group and that report for
 
01:28:58.790 --> 01:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
the updated State rail plan is planned
 
01:29:00.590 --> 01:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
to be delivered within this calendar
 
01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
year so um looking at the the rail
 
01:29:04.990 --> 01:29:05.000 align:start position:0%
network from a holistic um would
 
01:29:09.070 --> 01:29:09.080 align:start position:0%
probably be covered by by that ongoing
 
01:29:11.550 --> 01:29:11.560 align:start position:0%
effort representative
 
01:29:13.990 --> 01:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
Bogart thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:29:17.070 --> 01:29:17.080 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
01:29:19.910 --> 01:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
um I don't remember what bill it was
 
01:29:21.629 --> 01:29:21.639 align:start position:0%
last year but this committee heard a
 
01:29:24.790 --> 01:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
bill that was going to remove track
 
01:29:28.390 --> 01:29:28.400 align:start position:0%
back in somewhere in that area and turn
 
01:29:31.189 --> 01:29:31.199 align:start position:0%
it over the trail is this the 21 miles
 
01:29:34.310 --> 01:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
that are being discussed now yes there
 
01:29:35.990 --> 01:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
were a few different bills last year
 
01:29:37.669 --> 01:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
some of them were more prescriptively
 
01:29:40.109 --> 01:29:40.119 align:start position:0%
looking at smaller subsets 10 miles or
 
01:29:42.669 --> 01:29:42.679 align:start position:0%
so but uh yeah so the effort we looked
 
01:29:45.629 --> 01:29:45.639 align:start position:0%
at was aimed at that 10 miles originally
 
01:29:47.229 --> 01:29:47.239 align:start position:0%
of track removal but we looked at the
 
01:29:49.070 --> 01:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
whole 21 miles cuz to the department
 
01:29:51.669 --> 01:29:51.679 align:start position:0%
it's a contiguous Corridor so the
 
01:29:54.350 --> 01:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
effects of a 10 mile decision affect 20
 
01:29:57.950 --> 01:29:57.960 align:start position:0%
mil so um it is the same
 
01:29:57.960 --> 01:29:59.910 align:start position:0%
mil so um it is the same
representative

01:29:59.910 --> 01:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:30:04.750 --> 01:30:04.760 align:start position:0%
follow so it was then uh passed and
 
01:30:07.550 --> 01:30:07.560 align:start position:0%
agreed upon to go ahead and and do this
 
01:30:09.350 --> 01:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:30:13.109 --> 01:30:13.119 align:start position:0%
do has been actively working towards
 
01:30:16.550 --> 01:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
converting it uh removing Rail and
 
01:30:18.790 --> 01:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
converting it to a
 
01:30:23.109 --> 01:30:23.119 align:start position:0%
trail and this bill I'm sorry it's a
 
01:30:26.189 --> 01:30:26.199 align:start position:0%
longer question but and this bill would
 
01:30:30.550 --> 01:30:30.560 align:start position:0%
kind of stop that process and and reset
 
01:30:34.550 --> 01:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
it to leaving the tracks in place and
 
01:30:37.709 --> 01:30:37.719 align:start position:0%
doing something different is that the
 
01:30:40.270 --> 01:30:40.280 align:start position:0%
scope I'm understanding so line in one
 
01:30:42.550 --> 01:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
line one and line two direct the
 
01:30:45.229 --> 01:30:45.239 align:start position:0%
department to request you know to submit
 
01:30:48.030 --> 01:30:48.040 align:start position:0%
an RFP to look for on rail uses and and
 
01:30:51.270 --> 01:30:51.280 align:start position:0%
by and large the department has agreed
 
01:30:54.669 --> 01:30:54.679 align:start position:0%
to foro that as part of the direct under
 
01:30:58.229 --> 01:30:58.239 align:start position:0%
house bill 1468 from last session um and
 
01:31:00.189 --> 01:31:00.199 align:start position:0%
then looked at the interim recreational
 
01:31:02.910 --> 01:31:02.920 align:start position:0%
uses so we have not actively removed any
 
01:31:05.189 --> 01:31:05.199 align:start position:0%
rail when we do the the management
 
01:31:07.109 --> 01:31:07.119 align:start position:0%
transfer to Department of Natural and
 
01:31:08.750 --> 01:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
cultural resources they will work
 
01:31:11.430 --> 01:31:11.440 align:start position:0%
through um any stages or phases of rail
 
01:31:13.310 --> 01:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
removal as they develop trails and
 
01:31:14.910 --> 01:31:14.920 align:start position:0%
that's not a foregone conclusion because
 
01:31:16.550 --> 01:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
there is some interest and some
 
01:31:19.390 --> 01:31:19.400 align:start position:0%
recreational on rail uses whether it's
 
01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
motorized putt puts rail biking so again
 
01:31:24.550 --> 01:31:24.560 align:start position:0%
dncr now let them speak to it I believe
 
01:31:27.270 --> 01:31:27.280 align:start position:0%
we'll have um an interactive process
 
01:31:29.430 --> 01:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
with the host communities to figure out
 
01:31:31.270 --> 01:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
what will be going on but there's no
 
01:31:33.709 --> 01:31:33.719 align:start position:0%
planned active rail use Freight or
 
01:31:35.790 --> 01:31:35.800 align:start position:0%
passenger rail that would occur upon the
 
01:31:40.229 --> 01:31:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:42.430 --> 01:31:42.440 align:start position:0%
dncr any other questions yes
 
01:31:44.590 --> 01:31:44.600 align:start position:0%
representative Brown thank you Mr
 
01:31:46.109 --> 01:31:46.119 align:start position:0%
chairman I just want to make sure I'm
 
01:31:49.030 --> 01:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
I'm clear on this so um Mr Briggs
 
01:31:52.470 --> 01:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
indicated they have 80 jobs uh that are
 
01:31:54.470 --> 01:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
supported by the existing in Conway
 
01:31:57.270 --> 01:31:57.280 align:start position:0%
railro and 150,000 passengers per year
 
01:31:59.470 --> 01:31:59.480 align:start position:0%
use it now the the section that we're
 
01:32:02.070 --> 01:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
talking about the 21 miles that includes
 
01:32:04.590 --> 01:32:04.600 align:start position:0%
the existing Conway Scenic Railroad
 
01:32:07.590 --> 01:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
use no 21 miles of the state owned
 
01:32:09.470 --> 01:32:09.480 align:start position:0%
Conway Branch are the state owned
 
01:32:11.189 --> 01:32:11.199 align:start position:0%
privately for which we have no tenant
 
01:32:12.870 --> 01:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
railroads so the department has an
 
01:32:14.470 --> 01:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
agreement with Conway Scenic on its
 
01:32:17.870 --> 01:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
Mountain division the line that um goes
 
01:32:20.109 --> 01:32:20.119 align:start position:0%
uh east west across the state to the to
 
01:32:22.310 --> 01:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
the main line so we have no tenant
 
01:32:24.830 --> 01:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
railroads who we will be um who are
 
01:32:26.350 --> 01:32:26.360 align:start position:0%
actively providing service that we will
 
01:32:28.830 --> 01:32:28.840 align:start position:0%
be severing any agreements with okay so
 
01:32:31.510 --> 01:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
these are follow follow so these are
 
01:32:34.030 --> 01:32:34.040 align:start position:0%
basically 21 miles that's independent of
 
01:32:36.390 --> 01:32:36.400 align:start position:0%
the existing use correct correct it
 
01:32:38.950 --> 01:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
connects south of their private
 
01:32:40.669 --> 01:32:40.679 align:start position:0%
ownership Conway Scenic owns some
 
01:32:43.109 --> 01:32:43.119 align:start position:0%
private portions of the Conway Branch
 
01:32:44.750 --> 01:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
the northern po piece of the Conway
 
01:32:46.390 --> 01:32:46.400 align:start position:0%
branch is owned by Conway Scenic so the
 
01:32:48.350 --> 01:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
21 miles to the south of that are
 
01:32:50.470 --> 01:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
abandoned and have only been used for
 
01:32:54.709 --> 01:32:54.719 align:start position:0%
winter snowmobile use by dncr so
 
01:32:55.910 --> 01:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
01:32:58.070 --> 01:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
01:33:00.590 --> 01:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
questions representative jurus thank you
 
01:33:02.790 --> 01:33:02.800 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for being here so
 
01:33:04.990 --> 01:33:05.000 align:start position:0%
there's when it goes to
 
01:33:10.189 --> 01:33:10.199 align:start position:0%
dnca there's will there be any work I
 
01:33:10.990 --> 01:33:11.000 align:start position:0%
guess they're going to come up to
 
01:33:12.990 --> 01:33:13.000 align:start position:0%
testify but will there be any pursuit of
 
01:33:16.109 --> 01:33:16.119 align:start position:0%
a possible uh Rail caror
 
01:33:19.109 --> 01:33:19.119 align:start position:0%
between um our section of that that
 
01:33:21.669 --> 01:33:21.679 align:start position:0%
railroad all the way out to to Portland
 
01:33:23.830 --> 01:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
Maine so that would be on the mountain
 
01:33:25.470 --> 01:33:25.480 align:start position:0%
division so that would be separate from
 
01:33:28.990 --> 01:33:29.000 align:start position:0%
these 21 miles so our 21 miles go north
 
01:33:30.470 --> 01:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
connect to Conway Scenic and then
 
01:33:32.510 --> 01:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
connect to the state own Mountain
 
01:33:34.990 --> 01:33:35.000 align:start position:0%
division which runs from the main Town
 
01:33:37.070 --> 01:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
Line over to well the main border over
 
01:33:40.430 --> 01:33:40.440 align:start position:0%
to the Vermont border so um dncr
 
01:33:42.470 --> 01:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have any interface or
 
01:33:44.629 --> 01:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
interaction on any grants or development
 
01:33:47.310 --> 01:33:47.320 align:start position:0%
on the mountain division to fryberg
 
01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:48.270 align:start position:0%
on the mountain division to fryberg
thank

01:33:48.270 --> 01:33:48.280 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:33:51.030 --> 01:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
you any further
 
01:33:56.669 --> 01:33:56.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:03.030 --> 01:34:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:05.030 --> 01:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
speakers seeing
 
01:34:07.470 --> 01:34:07.480 align:start position:0%
none can move to close the public
 
01:34:09.830 --> 01:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
hearing on
 
01:34:18.550 --> 01:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:21.149 --> 01:34:21.159 align:start position:0%
you we' got it's been an hour and a half
 
01:34:22.709 --> 01:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
we've got a couple of minutes before we
 
01:34:25.990 --> 01:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
have to start uh HP 100 if anybody wants
 
01:34:28.870 --> 01:34:28.880 align:start position:0%
to take about 3 minutes to uh restroom
 
01:34:31.390 --> 01:34:31.400 align:start position:0%
it or not you may
 
01:34:34.590 --> 01:34:34.600 align:start position:0%
go we'll we will open up the public here
 
01:34:52.629 --> 01:34:52.639 align:start position:0%

01:40:39.589 --> 01:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
it's being 11:34 I'm going to call the
 
01:40:42.430 --> 01:40:42.440 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill
 
01:40:45.430 --> 01:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
100 prohibiting the use of State funds
 
01:40:49.790 --> 01:40:49.800 align:start position:0%
for new passenger rail projects to order
 
01:40:52.510 --> 01:40:52.520 align:start position:0%
and I recognize representative Ross
 
01:40:54.550 --> 01:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
Berry thank you and thank you Mr
 
01:40:57.790 --> 01:40:57.800 align:start position:0%
chairman for um hearing me out I'm here
 
01:41:01.510 --> 01:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
to introduce uh House Bill 100 which
 
01:41:03.669 --> 01:41:03.679 align:start position:0%
would prohibit new passenger Rail
 
01:41:04.990 --> 01:41:05.000 align:start position:0%
Products I do think the bill probably
 
01:41:06.030 --> 01:41:06.040 align:start position:0%
does need an amendment because I think
 
01:41:08.070 --> 01:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
the language is a little clunky um the
 
01:41:10.070 --> 01:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
purpose of it is specifically designed
 
01:41:14.149 --> 01:41:14.159 align:start position:0%
to stop the um the project number
 
01:41:17.030 --> 01:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
40818 which is the Nashua Manchester
 
01:41:19.830 --> 01:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
Cocker quote unquote commuter rail um so
 
01:41:21.510 --> 01:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
this has been that particular project
 
01:41:22.589 --> 01:41:22.599 align:start position:0%
I'm going to leave my remarks to that
 
01:41:24.709 --> 01:41:24.719 align:start position:0%
particular project which is why I signed
 
01:41:28.430 --> 01:41:28.440 align:start position:0%
on to the bill uh it is time that we as
 
01:41:30.390 --> 01:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
a state accept that this is never going
 
01:41:32.790 --> 01:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
to happen we keep spending more and more
 
01:41:34.310 --> 01:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
and more taxpayer money trying to study
 
01:41:36.669 --> 01:41:36.679 align:start position:0%
something that is never going to happen
 
01:41:40.470 --> 01:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
this particular stretch has been in
 
01:41:43.669 --> 01:41:43.679 align:start position:0%
place before two times and both times it
 
01:41:45.270 --> 01:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
has gone under because people didn't
 
01:41:48.950 --> 01:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
want to write it so it it's like uh you
 
01:41:51.390 --> 01:41:51.400 align:start position:0%
know I there was this movie by Lizzy
 
01:41:52.990 --> 01:41:53.000 align:start position:0%
Lohan a couple years ago called mean
 
01:41:54.750 --> 01:41:54.760 align:start position:0%
girl and one of the characters kept
 
01:41:57.109 --> 01:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
using this word fetch she's like and she
 
01:41:59.350 --> 01:41:59.360 align:start position:0%
would try to interject it you know oh
 
01:42:00.709 --> 01:42:00.719 align:start position:0%
that's so fetch that's so fetch and
 
01:42:02.589 --> 01:42:02.599 align:start position:0%
finally they told her stop trying to
 
01:42:04.070 --> 01:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
make fetch happen fetch is never going
 
01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:05.030 align:start position:0%
make fetch happen fetch is never going
to

01:42:05.030 --> 01:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:42:08.229 --> 01:42:08.239 align:start position:0%
happen this Commuter Rail Project 40818
 
01:42:09.950 --> 01:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
the one between Nash and conquered is
 
01:42:12.870 --> 01:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
fetch it is never going to happen we now
 
01:42:14.149 --> 01:42:14.159 align:start position:0%
live in a different world from when
 
01:42:15.550 --> 01:42:15.560 align:start position:0%
commuter rail would have actually been
 
01:42:18.229 --> 01:42:18.239 align:start position:0%
somewhat feasible so we now live in a
 
01:42:19.430 --> 01:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
world where more and more people are
 
01:42:21.070 --> 01:42:21.080 align:start position:0%
working from home more and more people
 
01:42:24.030 --> 01:42:24.040 align:start position:0%
want to work from home um and the need
 
01:42:27.030 --> 01:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
for this is basically gone there the
 
01:42:28.629 --> 01:42:28.639 align:start position:0%
proponents of the project are always
 
01:42:30.030 --> 01:42:30.040 align:start position:0%
putting forward kind of these fantasy
 
01:42:31.510 --> 01:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
lands things that it wouldn't do like oh
 
01:42:33.270 --> 01:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
you'll be able to jump on the train at
 
01:42:34.669 --> 01:42:34.679 align:start position:0%
at you know six o'clock in Manchester
 
01:42:36.990 --> 01:42:37.000 align:start position:0%
and go catch a game at finway no you're
 
01:42:38.510 --> 01:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
that that's not how it works it's
 
01:42:40.229 --> 01:42:40.239 align:start position:0%
Commuter so it's people leaving in the
 
01:42:41.589 --> 01:42:41.599 align:start position:0%
morning to go to work people coming back
 
01:42:41.599 --> 01:42:42.310 align:start position:0%
morning to go to work people coming back
from

01:42:42.310 --> 01:42:42.320 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:42:45.629 --> 01:42:45.639 align:start position:0%
work when we look forward in the future
 
01:42:47.709 --> 01:42:47.719 align:start position:0%
rail is probably not going to be the way
 
01:42:50.229 --> 01:42:50.239 align:start position:0%
that humans transport themselves the
 
01:42:52.109 --> 01:42:52.119 align:start position:0%
Advent of electronic of electric
 
01:42:54.510 --> 01:42:54.520 align:start position:0%
vehicles and the Advent of autonomous
 
01:42:56.390 --> 01:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
vehicles are basically going to replace
 
01:42:59.149 --> 01:42:59.159 align:start position:0%
anyone wanting to get on a fixed mode of
 
01:43:01.030 --> 01:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
transportation um it also erases the
 
01:43:03.310 --> 01:43:03.320 align:start position:0%
enironmental concerns that rail might be
 
01:43:05.669 --> 01:43:05.679 align:start position:0%
better for than a CO2 emitting car if
 
01:43:07.910 --> 01:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
you have a fully electronic vehicle that
 
01:43:09.790 --> 01:43:09.800 align:start position:0%
you can charge with clean energy and it
 
01:43:11.149 --> 01:43:11.159 align:start position:0%
will take you exactly where you want to
 
01:43:12.229 --> 01:43:12.239 align:start position:0%
go and you never have to touch the
 
01:43:13.790 --> 01:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
steering wheel why would you get on a
 
01:43:17.149 --> 01:43:17.159 align:start position:0%
rail why would you ever do that you
 
01:43:20.390 --> 01:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't so when they proposed this
 
01:43:22.950 --> 01:43:22.960 align:start position:0%
project before they always have it's
 
01:43:24.950 --> 01:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
like like the same formula which is
 
01:43:27.109 --> 01:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
every time they study it they project
 
01:43:29.550 --> 01:43:29.560 align:start position:0%
less ridership and it costing more so
 
01:43:31.270 --> 01:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
less ridership costing more every single
 
01:43:32.870 --> 01:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
time they go through this iteration of
 
01:43:36.870 --> 01:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
fewer Riders more money and I think
 
01:43:38.070 --> 01:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
you're actually at a point now where
 
01:43:40.149 --> 01:43:40.159 align:start position:0%
projected ridership would be lower than
 
01:43:41.990 --> 01:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
the number of people that that train
 
01:43:43.430 --> 01:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
going through there eight times a day
 
01:43:45.750 --> 01:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
would disturb so I used to live right by
 
01:43:48.070 --> 01:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
the proposed rail uh right now that
 
01:43:50.870 --> 01:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
train track it sees a
 
01:43:55.109 --> 01:43:55.119 align:start position:0%
train maybe once every two days um let's
 
01:43:56.669 --> 01:43:56.679 align:start position:0%
just call it once every day just for the
 
01:43:58.709 --> 01:43:58.719 align:start position:0%
sake of benefit um it's very disturbing
 
01:43:59.750 --> 01:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
when that train comes through there the
 
01:44:00.910 --> 01:44:00.920 align:start position:0%
Train's been running there I think since
 
01:44:03.910 --> 01:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
like 1910 or something it's not new but
 
01:44:05.910 --> 01:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
it's you know the house is Shake right
 
01:44:07.109 --> 01:44:07.119 align:start position:0%
it's but it's it's one of those things
 
01:44:09.070 --> 01:44:09.080 align:start position:0%
of like you know you bought the house
 
01:44:10.390 --> 01:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
the tracks were there but you kind of
 
01:44:12.910 --> 01:44:12.920 align:start position:0%
knew the frequency of the schedule this
 
01:44:14.870 --> 01:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
is talking about bringing a train
 
01:44:17.669 --> 01:44:17.679 align:start position:0%
through there eight 16 times a day So a
 
01:44:21.030 --> 01:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
multiple a multiple a a multiplier of
 
01:44:22.189 --> 01:44:22.199 align:start position:0%
how much time that train is going to be
 
01:44:23.990 --> 01:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
going through there that no one will be
 
01:44:25.870 --> 01:44:25.880 align:start position:0%
writing just being honest with yourself
 
01:44:27.270 --> 01:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
no one's going to write it so you're
 
01:44:28.830 --> 01:44:28.840 align:start position:0%
going to disturb a bunch of people bunch
 
01:44:30.830 --> 01:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
of single family homes uh starter homes
 
01:44:32.790 --> 01:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
by the way uh they're going to serve a
 
01:44:33.910 --> 01:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
bunch of people they're not going to
 
01:44:35.030 --> 01:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
ride it then you're going to take going
 
01:44:38.390 --> 01:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
to raise their taxes because the fee the
 
01:44:40.070 --> 01:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
the fees you would charge won't cover
 
01:44:41.950 --> 01:44:41.960 align:start position:0%
the cost so you're going to tax them
 
01:44:43.070 --> 01:44:43.080 align:start position:0%
more you're going to decrease the value
 
01:44:44.870 --> 01:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
of the house you're going to disturb
 
01:44:48.109 --> 01:44:48.119 align:start position:0%
them all so that you can have some
 
01:44:50.270 --> 01:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
project that no one's going to ride uh
 
01:44:52.669 --> 01:44:52.679 align:start position:0%
and I I'll leave you with this one if
 
01:44:55.470 --> 01:44:55.480 align:start position:0%
commu rail was going to be a thing if if
 
01:44:56.990 --> 01:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
that if that track was going to run
 
01:44:58.510 --> 01:44:58.520 align:start position:0%
again that the third iteration of it
 
01:45:00.430 --> 01:45:00.440 align:start position:0%
because it's already failed twice if
 
01:45:02.669 --> 01:45:02.679 align:start position:0%
that was going to run again someone
 
01:45:05.229 --> 01:45:05.239 align:start position:0%
would already do it the people that own
 
01:45:07.229 --> 01:45:07.239 align:start position:0%
those tracks Want A train running on
 
01:45:09.310 --> 01:45:09.320 align:start position:0%
those tracks They want to monetize those
 
01:45:11.669 --> 01:45:11.679 align:start position:0%
tracks if they thought that they could
 
01:45:13.629 --> 01:45:13.639 align:start position:0%
be economically feasible to have that
 
01:45:15.830 --> 01:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
train running and make money I assure
 
01:45:17.510 --> 01:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
you as greedy capitalist they would do
 
01:45:19.910 --> 01:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
it but it doesn't work unless the
 
01:45:22.350 --> 01:45:22.360 align:start position:0%
taxpayers fund out a bunch of money so
 
01:45:24.950 --> 01:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
they're not going to do that it's time
 
01:45:27.709 --> 01:45:27.719 align:start position:0%
we just put this issue to bed and accept
 
01:45:30.030 --> 01:45:30.040 align:start position:0%
that this is never going to be a thing
 
01:45:32.350 --> 01:45:32.360 align:start position:0%
um they had a vote I think last week in
 
01:45:34.910 --> 01:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
nasua and maybe two weeks ago um where
 
01:45:36.270 --> 01:45:36.280 align:start position:0%
they actually discussed spending
 
01:45:38.350 --> 01:45:38.360 align:start position:0%
Municipal money on this project and I
 
01:45:40.589 --> 01:45:40.599 align:start position:0%
think they stopped it by one vote
 
01:45:42.790 --> 01:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
because somebody finally kind of said
 
01:45:45.030 --> 01:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
what I was said Nash was the people that
 
01:45:47.390 --> 01:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
the Alman of Nash are not exactly of uh
 
01:45:50.109 --> 01:45:50.119 align:start position:0%
my political persuasion someone finally
 
01:45:52.189 --> 01:45:52.199 align:start position:0%
said why are we spending a quarter of a
 
01:45:53.750 --> 01:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
million dollars on project that's never
 
01:45:55.589 --> 01:45:55.599 align:start position:0%
going to happen when we have homeless
 
01:45:57.830 --> 01:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
people freezing in the streets that fin
 
01:45:59.350 --> 01:45:59.360 align:start position:0%
somebody finally said the quiet part out
 
01:46:01.270 --> 01:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
loud um and they also recognize the
 
01:46:03.510 --> 01:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
reality which was they said I won't see
 
01:46:05.189 --> 01:46:05.199 align:start position:0%
the rail my children won't see the rail
 
01:46:06.589 --> 01:46:06.599 align:start position:0%
but maybe my children's children will
 
01:46:08.390 --> 01:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
see the rail so let's stop spending
 
01:46:09.910 --> 01:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
money on things that are never going to
 
01:46:12.350 --> 01:46:12.360 align:start position:0%
happen let's just acknowledge it's not a
 
01:46:15.750 --> 01:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
thing and we just we just move on so uh
 
01:46:17.270 --> 01:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
I have to be very brief in questions cuz
 
01:46:19.629 --> 01:46:19.639 align:start position:0%
I'm in committee right now too um so
 
01:46:21.270 --> 01:46:21.280 align:start position:0%
I'll take like one or two but I'm I'm
 
01:46:23.229 --> 01:46:23.239 align:start position:0%
basically going to going to Ro so I'm
 
01:46:24.310 --> 01:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
sorry to do that but if I wasn't in
 
01:46:25.510 --> 01:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
committee I'd stay here and have a have
 
01:46:27.510 --> 01:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
a good time thank you Mr Ro
 
01:46:29.189 --> 01:46:29.199 align:start position:0%
representative Ross representative Jack
 
01:46:30.910 --> 01:46:30.920 align:start position:0%
has it uh thank you Mr chairman thank
 
01:46:32.270 --> 01:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
you for appearing I'm curious why you
 
01:46:33.910 --> 01:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
want to stop project
 
01:46:36.510 --> 01:46:36.520 align:start position:0%
40818 which was completed two years ago
 
01:46:40.030 --> 01:46:40.040 align:start position:0%
in February of of 2023 and is no longer
 
01:46:42.589 --> 01:46:42.599 align:start position:0%
in the 10-year plan or any funds being
 
01:46:45.109 --> 01:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
expended on it well it's the NASA I said
 
01:46:46.149 --> 01:46:46.159 align:start position:0%
I don't know the project number because
 
01:46:47.750 --> 01:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
that's was in the bill I'm not the prime
 
01:46:50.270 --> 01:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
sponsor as I said but the the I'm I'm
 
01:46:52.109 --> 01:46:52.119 align:start position:0%
discussing the Nash Manchester conquered
 
01:46:54.589 --> 01:46:54.599 align:start position:0%
corridor so so long as that rail is not
 
01:46:56.589 --> 01:46:56.599 align:start position:0%
running that's the intention of the bill
 
01:46:58.470 --> 01:46:58.480 align:start position:0%
um you know I I said I'm not I'm here as
 
01:47:00.589 --> 01:47:00.599 align:start position:0%
a I'm here as a courtesy to the prime
 
01:47:03.669 --> 01:47:03.679 align:start position:0%
sponsor so okay follow up then uh there
 
01:47:06.430 --> 01:47:06.440 align:start position:0%
is no currently funded project in this
 
01:47:09.390 --> 01:47:09.400 align:start position:0%
Corridor so it seems like your goal is
 
01:47:11.390 --> 01:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
achieved without this bill I I would
 
01:47:13.270 --> 01:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
disagree because someone will bring it
 
01:47:15.790 --> 01:47:15.800 align:start position:0%
back it just keeps coming back they've
 
01:47:16.990 --> 01:47:17.000 align:start position:0%
already brought it back to they've
 
01:47:18.870 --> 01:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
already brought it back twice so if it's
 
01:47:20.229 --> 01:47:20.239 align:start position:0%
dead for a third time it'll be back and
 
01:47:23.669 --> 01:47:23.679 align:start position:0%
forth put it to bed and I I do got to go
 
01:47:25.430 --> 01:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
with that one
 
01:47:28.229 --> 01:47:28.239 align:start position:0%
because you're excused I'm sure there'll
 
01:47:31.310 --> 01:47:31.320 align:start position:0%
be other people answer any
 
01:47:34.109 --> 01:47:34.119 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:47:34.119 --> 01:47:36.510 align:start position:0%
questions representative
B

01:47:36.510 --> 01:47:36.520 align:start position:0%
B
 
01:47:39.629 --> 01:47:39.639 align:start position:0%
please welcome to public
 
01:47:42.629 --> 01:47:42.639 align:start position:0%
works thank you Mr chairman state your
 
01:47:44.430 --> 01:47:44.440 align:start position:0%
name and for the record please all right
 
01:47:47.030 --> 01:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
I'm Ralph B and correcting what I
 
01:47:50.350 --> 01:47:50.360 align:start position:0%
printed out I'm in Hillsboro District
 
01:47:55.510 --> 01:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:58.950 --> 01:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
Lichfield thank you anyway commuta rail
 
01:48:01.830 --> 01:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
in the early 90s I was on Jud Greg's
 
01:48:04.870 --> 01:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
Railway commission we studied bringing
 
01:48:07.550 --> 01:48:07.560 align:start position:0%
commuter rail to nashwa we had many
 
01:48:10.149 --> 01:48:10.159 align:start position:0%
meetings for a year and including
 
01:48:13.350 --> 01:48:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:16.070 --> 01:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
MBTA after a year discussing and looking
 
01:48:18.070 --> 01:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
at the issues determined that computer
 
01:48:21.430 --> 01:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
rail was not financially
 
01:48:25.550 --> 01:48:25.560 align:start position:0%
feasible more so now it was determined
 
01:48:27.990 --> 01:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
that the tracks from low up would have
 
01:48:30.910 --> 01:48:30.920 align:start position:0%
to be completely replaced and include
 
01:48:34.550 --> 01:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
turnoff tracks the existing track is 15
 
01:48:37.390 --> 01:48:37.400 align:start position:0%
mph Freight and worse now is there are
 
01:48:40.910 --> 01:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
less train traffic 15 mph Freight that
 
01:48:42.709 --> 01:48:42.719 align:start position:0%
you can
 
01:48:45.669 --> 01:48:45.679 align:start position:0%
contribute make believe it's a class six
 
01:48:48.950 --> 01:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
Road a dirt road you can't put highspeed
 
01:48:50.270 --> 01:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
rail on
 
01:48:52.830 --> 01:48:52.840 align:start position:0%
it of course the initial course of the
 
01:48:55.470 --> 01:48:55.480 align:start position:0%
trains the upkeep Etc or that coming
 
01:48:57.430 --> 01:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
from my other pocket the one that pays
 
01:49:00.790 --> 01:49:00.800 align:start position:0%
federal income taxes the MBT operation
 
01:49:03.589 --> 01:49:03.599 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts is paid for by their
 
01:49:07.430 --> 01:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
sales tax and property tax for most of
 
01:49:09.149 --> 01:49:09.159 align:start position:0%
the towns east of
 
01:49:13.910 --> 01:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
495 50 years ago I lived in Hudson Mass
 
01:49:17.430 --> 01:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
and it was on our property tax pill for
 
01:49:20.390 --> 01:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
subsidizing the MBTA and the train
 
01:49:24.790 --> 01:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:26.709 --> 01:49:26.719 align:start position:0%
towns are assessed even though no Grail
 
01:49:28.070 --> 01:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
goes through the
 
01:49:30.950 --> 01:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
town the people that ride the train do
 
01:49:35.030 --> 01:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
not pay for the cost of it it is all
 
01:49:37.990 --> 01:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
subsidized the whole world is subsidized
 
01:49:39.350 --> 01:49:39.360 align:start position:0%
for rail
 
01:49:41.550 --> 01:49:41.560 align:start position:0%
Transportation except for what I
 
01:49:43.750 --> 01:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
understand the Tokyo rail system and
 
01:49:46.510 --> 01:49:46.520 align:start position:0%
they use people to push the PE push the
 
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
passengers onto the
 
01:49:51.589 --> 01:49:51.599 align:start position:0%
train and we know that and we've heard
 
01:49:54.390 --> 01:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
about a lot of well the down Easter the
 
01:49:56.990 --> 01:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
train that goes from Maine to Boston
 
01:50:00.510 --> 01:50:00.520 align:start position:0%
that's Amtrak that's subsidizes by
 
01:50:03.229 --> 01:50:03.239 align:start position:0%
your income
 
01:50:05.790 --> 01:50:05.800 align:start position:0%
tax and they're in
 
01:50:08.070 --> 01:50:08.080 align:start position:0%
trouble the argument that all
 
01:50:10.390 --> 01:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
transportation and subsidized only go so
 
01:50:13.189 --> 01:50:13.199 align:start position:0%
far yes in our property taxes we pay for
 
01:50:16.390 --> 01:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
Road plowing improvements Etc but that
 
01:50:20.589 --> 01:50:20.599 align:start position:0%
we can control by our vote but Road
 
01:50:24.950 --> 01:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
Transportation benefits 100% of us all
 
01:50:27.510 --> 01:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
we have to eat the trucks bring the food
 
01:50:30.790 --> 01:50:30.800 align:start position:0%
we get mail and all that so that's
 
01:50:33.629 --> 01:50:33.639 align:start position:0%
entirely different we all use the
 
01:50:35.950 --> 01:50:35.960 align:start position:0%
roads instead of spending money on
 
01:50:37.990 --> 01:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
trains the Manny should be spent on New
 
01:50:40.229 --> 01:50:40.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire making it more cost effective
 
01:50:42.709 --> 01:50:42.719 align:start position:0%
for businesses to move to New Hampshire
 
01:50:44.310 --> 01:50:44.320 align:start position:0%
so that the workers don't have to
 
01:50:46.270 --> 01:50:46.280 align:start position:0%
compute and we heard that a lot of them
 
01:50:46.280 --> 01:50:47.310 align:start position:0%
compute and we heard that a lot of them
are

01:50:47.310 --> 01:50:47.320 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:50:50.229 --> 01:50:50.239 align:start position:0%
remotely and if Manchester and Nashville
 
01:50:53.270 --> 01:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
W trains they can pay for it there was a
 
01:50:56.069 --> 01:50:56.079 align:start position:0%
trade run once back in the 90s and I
 
01:50:58.629 --> 01:50:58.639 align:start position:0%
think it lasted a year because it wasn't
 
01:51:02.069 --> 01:51:02.079 align:start position:0%
being utilized So and I've always been
 
01:51:04.709 --> 01:51:04.719 align:start position:0%
let those that use a service pay for it
 
01:51:07.470 --> 01:51:07.480 align:start position:0%
my gas taxes go for the road and one of
 
01:51:09.990 --> 01:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
the problems we have is e EV vehicles
 
01:51:12.350 --> 01:51:12.360 align:start position:0%
are using the road for free and that
 
01:51:16.109 --> 01:51:16.119 align:start position:0%
needs to be fixed so thank
 
01:51:19.470 --> 01:51:19.480 align:start position:0%
you any questions for representative
 
01:51:21.550 --> 01:51:21.560 align:start position:0%
bone representative
 
01:51:24.229 --> 01:51:24.239 align:start position:0%
fauler quick one are you aware that EVS
 
01:51:26.030 --> 01:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
in fact are charged
 
01:51:28.390 --> 01:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
$100 regist but that's still a whole lot
 
01:51:31.109 --> 01:51:31.119 align:start position:0%
less than what I'm paying for gas gas
 
01:51:34.790 --> 01:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
taxes equivalent of 500 gallons yeah
 
01:51:36.910 --> 01:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
which would take me in my car 50,000
 
01:51:39.149 --> 01:51:39.159 align:start position:0%
miles I I realize that that that was
 
01:51:41.149 --> 01:51:41.159 align:start position:0%
just started
 
01:51:43.589 --> 01:51:43.599 align:start position:0%
recently any other questions
 
01:51:45.709 --> 01:51:45.719 align:start position:0%
representative jurus thank you Mr
 
01:51:47.830 --> 01:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
chairman and uh thank you uh
 
01:51:50.950 --> 01:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
representative B uh when you lived in
 
01:51:53.910 --> 01:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
Hudson Mass did and part of the the town
 
01:51:56.030 --> 01:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
may have uh been part of the communities
 
01:51:59.790 --> 01:51:59.800 align:start position:0%
in mass that uh were uh were charged
 
01:52:02.589 --> 01:52:02.599 align:start position:0%
with supporting the te the town of
 
01:52:05.310 --> 01:52:05.320 align:start position:0%
Hudson had uh he still had commuter rail
 
01:52:08.189 --> 01:52:08.199 align:start position:0%
stops in in either Acton or Fitchburg
 
01:52:11.310 --> 01:52:11.320 align:start position:0%
that uh that those residents could could
 
01:52:14.310 --> 01:52:14.320 align:start position:0%
access yeah but back then we looked at
 
01:52:17.229 --> 01:52:17.239 align:start position:0%
who was riding the riding the trails and
 
01:52:20.069 --> 01:52:20.079 align:start position:0%
we did a survey and whatnot and we
 
01:52:21.830 --> 01:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
figured hey we can ride these people to
 
01:52:24.589 --> 01:52:24.599 align:start position:0%
van and be cheaper you know I mean than
 
01:52:26.750 --> 01:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
the property taxes and I know people in
 
01:52:29.310 --> 01:52:29.320 align:start position:0%
all the towns in mayard and Hudson in
 
01:52:31.830 --> 01:52:31.840 align:start position:0%
that whole area really were very upset
 
01:52:34.310 --> 01:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
that that was on their property tax bill
 
01:52:36.669 --> 01:52:36.679 align:start position:0%
then and it'd be worse now in New
 
01:52:39.069 --> 01:52:39.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can you imagine if I'm living
 
01:52:41.149 --> 01:52:41.159 align:start position:0%
in litfield and I had this thing on my
 
01:52:43.470 --> 01:52:43.480 align:start position:0%
property tax bill for subsidizing that
 
01:52:46.270 --> 01:52:46.280 align:start position:0%
madebe nobody used
 
01:52:49.910 --> 01:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
so follow up is it is it would you
 
01:52:51.270 --> 01:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
understand that it's possible that right
 
01:52:53.629 --> 01:52:53.639 align:start position:0%
now residents of litfield and Hudson
 
01:52:56.189 --> 01:52:56.199 align:start position:0%
commute to either L the Gallagher
 
01:52:57.990 --> 01:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
Terminal of North Bara station to catch
 
01:53:00.270 --> 01:53:00.280 align:start position:0%
the commuter rail or possibly even drive
 
01:53:02.189 --> 01:53:02.199 align:start position:0%
down the air wife to catch the uh the
 
01:53:02.199 --> 01:53:02.910 align:start position:0%
down the air wife to catch the uh the
red

01:53:02.910 --> 01:53:02.920 align:start position:0%
red
 
01:53:06.430 --> 01:53:06.440 align:start position:0%
line I don't know of anybody that would
 
01:53:09.109 --> 01:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
that would use conceivably if the if I
 
01:53:10.750 --> 01:53:10.760 align:start position:0%
could follow conceivably if the trade
 
01:53:12.870 --> 01:53:12.880 align:start position:0%
sto were in Nashville those residents
 
01:53:15.229 --> 01:53:15.239 align:start position:0%
could conceivably you know cross the
 
01:53:18.270 --> 01:53:18.280 align:start position:0%
bridge and and go to the station in Nash
 
01:53:21.109 --> 01:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
correct well one yeah one of the things
 
01:53:23.229 --> 01:53:23.239 align:start position:0%
we have in that we have
 
01:53:26.750 --> 01:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
the the the Boston the Boston Express
 
01:53:30.310 --> 01:53:30.320 align:start position:0%
that goes through 91 and three the bus
 
01:53:33.870 --> 01:53:33.880 align:start position:0%
line the problem in nashar is the bus
 
01:53:36.350 --> 01:53:36.360 align:start position:0%
line mainly for nashar people is in
 
01:53:40.510 --> 01:53:40.520 align:start position:0%
tingbo there's one in Northern hash
 
01:53:44.470 --> 01:53:44.480 align:start position:0%
but I mean it the problem when we had
 
01:53:47.910 --> 01:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
the the commission was finding a place
 
01:53:50.069 --> 01:53:50.079 align:start position:0%
in nashille for putting the train
 
01:53:53.510 --> 01:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
station to start with nobody wanted it
 
01:53:55.950 --> 01:53:55.960 align:start position:0%
but now and then people looking at it
 
01:53:57.750 --> 01:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
and that was even Fez and Lane mall we
 
01:53:59.189 --> 01:53:59.199 align:start position:0%
thought that would be a great place for
 
01:54:01.350 --> 01:54:01.360 align:start position:0%
it but Fez and Lan Mall's said no way
 
01:54:02.990 --> 01:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
you know because people can come up and
 
01:54:05.510 --> 01:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
Shop but you know so it wasn't feasible
 
01:54:07.910 --> 01:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
then financially for the course of the
 
01:54:10.350 --> 01:54:10.360 align:start position:0%
trains the subsidies that would be
 
01:54:13.430 --> 01:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
needed and you know and it' be it' be
 
01:54:16.390 --> 01:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
worse now and like previous speaker
 
01:54:17.790 --> 01:54:17.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned it
 
01:54:20.470 --> 01:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
was less and less people going to
 
01:54:22.510 --> 01:54:22.520 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts now and we want the people
 
01:54:24.990 --> 01:54:25.000 align:start position:0%
to come up to New Hampshire to work
 
01:54:26.830 --> 01:54:26.840 align:start position:0%
people stay in New Hampshire to work and
 
01:54:30.109 --> 01:54:30.119 align:start position:0%
not have to commute to
 
01:54:32.350 --> 01:54:32.360 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts any further questions for
 
01:54:35.550 --> 01:54:35.560 align:start position:0%
representative B representative
 
01:54:40.069 --> 01:54:40.079 align:start position:0%
cludia question represent
 
01:54:43.310 --> 01:54:43.320 align:start position:0%
conern apologize okay I am concerned
 
01:54:45.629 --> 01:54:45.639 align:start position:0%
that the way this bill is presently
 
01:54:47.830 --> 01:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
written would this it sounds like it
 
01:54:50.270 --> 01:54:50.280 align:start position:0%
could apply to the Cog Railway we with
 
01:54:52.390 --> 01:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
no more State funding for the Cog
 
01:54:54.430 --> 01:54:54.440 align:start position:0%
because it is a passenger railroad even
 
01:54:56.390 --> 01:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
though it's mainly used just I think for
 
01:54:59.470 --> 01:54:59.480 align:start position:0%
tourism so I think are you concerned
 
01:55:01.030 --> 01:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
about that because I just noticed this
 
01:55:02.629 --> 01:55:02.639 align:start position:0%
in reading the
 
01:55:06.430 --> 01:55:06.440 align:start position:0%
language um yeah I think yeah but I
 
01:55:08.470 --> 01:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
think they came up before and I thought
 
01:55:11.510 --> 01:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
this language had fixed that but I'm not
 
01:55:14.109 --> 01:55:14.119 align:start position:0%
sure okay all right thank
 
01:55:16.350 --> 01:55:16.360 align:start position:0%
you any further questions for
 
01:55:18.910 --> 01:55:18.920 align:start position:0%
representative B representative
 
01:55:22.910 --> 01:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
Edgar uh thank you Mr chair um
 
01:55:24.629 --> 01:55:24.639 align:start position:0%
this would prevent I guess the
 
01:55:26.270 --> 01:55:26.280 align:start position:0%
completion I I guess I'll probably get
 
01:55:27.750 --> 01:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
some help with this but the uh the
 
01:55:29.510 --> 01:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
completion of the report that was being
 
01:55:31.350 --> 01:55:31.360 align:start position:0%
done all the money was spent on so that
 
01:55:33.830 --> 01:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
we could actually see comprehensively
 
01:55:36.830 --> 01:55:36.840 align:start position:0%
what what the costs were at least ex
 
01:55:39.030 --> 01:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
going to be prophesized to be Bic
 
01:55:41.430 --> 01:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
calculated that we then we' be able to
 
01:55:43.470 --> 01:55:43.480 align:start position:0%
make a a better decision a lot of people
 
01:55:46.430 --> 01:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
if they saw the actual report if there
 
01:55:49.510 --> 01:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
was an official one put out then people
 
01:55:50.870 --> 01:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
make a decision be a lot of people would
 
01:55:52.870 --> 01:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
say no this this doesn't make sense or
 
01:55:54.390 --> 01:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
they might say yes it does make sense
 
01:55:56.149 --> 01:55:56.159 align:start position:0%
based on a report this would prevent
 
01:55:57.910 --> 01:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
that from coming out yeah the current
 
01:55:59.990 --> 01:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
one I don't know what the status is of
 
01:56:02.550 --> 01:56:02.560 align:start position:0%
the the one that had mentioned I know
 
01:56:04.629 --> 01:56:04.639 align:start position:0%
there was a report done when I was on
 
01:56:07.830 --> 01:56:07.840 align:start position:0%
Jud Greg's commission but uh the latest
 
01:56:10.350 --> 01:56:10.360 align:start position:0%
one what I understand I don't know I
 
01:56:11.629 --> 01:56:11.639 align:start position:0%
haven't seen it and I don't know if
 
01:56:15.430 --> 01:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
one's been out followup uh thank you Mr
 
01:56:19.030 --> 01:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
chair but if if this goes through then
 
01:56:21.270 --> 01:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't be able to have the a final
 
01:56:23.149 --> 01:56:23.159 align:start position:0%
final report that everybody could take a
 
01:56:25.910 --> 01:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
look at and judge or make a decision um
 
01:56:27.629 --> 01:56:27.639 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that be better than would that
 
01:56:29.310 --> 01:56:29.320 align:start position:0%
be better than just throwing out
 
01:56:30.550 --> 01:56:30.560 align:start position:0%
different things that might be wrong
 
01:56:33.669 --> 01:56:33.679 align:start position:0%
with it but the thing is it's like I
 
01:56:36.709 --> 01:56:36.719 align:start position:0%
mean testimony mine and the previous is
 
01:56:38.470 --> 01:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
like less and less people are going to
 
01:56:41.350 --> 01:56:41.360 align:start position:0%
be using the rail and why do we need it
 
01:56:43.510 --> 01:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
and why we want to continue spending
 
01:56:45.709 --> 01:56:45.719 align:start position:0%
money on something that will probably
 
01:56:45.719 --> 01:56:46.589 align:start position:0%
money on something that will probably
never

01:56:46.589 --> 01:56:46.599 align:start position:0%
never
 
01:56:50.109 --> 01:56:50.119 align:start position:0%
happen thank you thank you any further
 
01:56:54.350 --> 01:56:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:54.360 --> 01:56:55.950 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:56:55.950 --> 01:56:55.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:56:57.990 --> 01:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
rockmore I'll get
 
01:57:02.109 --> 01:57:02.119 align:start position:0%
it thank you Mr chairman um do you
 
01:57:03.870 --> 01:57:03.880 align:start position:0%
understand this bill to prohibit the
 
01:57:08.629 --> 01:57:08.639 align:start position:0%
state from say repairing a a a track
 
01:57:12.270 --> 01:57:12.280 align:start position:0%
that carries Freight because that also
 
01:57:14.510 --> 01:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
would be because that track might also
 
01:57:17.189 --> 01:57:17.199 align:start position:0%
carry passengers and the state has its
 
01:57:21.189 --> 01:57:21.199 align:start position:0%
hands tied it can't money on a TR when I
 
01:57:22.669 --> 01:57:22.679 align:start position:0%
understand the track now that does the
 
01:57:24.550 --> 01:57:24.560 align:start position:0%
freight is owned by the company that
 
01:57:26.550 --> 01:57:26.560 align:start position:0%
runs the
 
01:57:31.510 --> 01:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
trains the problem is if we if we do the
 
01:57:36.069 --> 01:57:36.079 align:start position:0%
pass rain all that track north of LEL up
 
01:57:38.149 --> 01:57:38.159 align:start position:0%
would have to be completely replaced
 
01:57:40.790 --> 01:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
along with turnoff tracks in other words
 
01:57:42.510 --> 01:57:42.520 align:start position:0%
for a train that turn off has another
 
01:57:45.270 --> 01:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
trains coming so that track so that
 
01:57:47.470 --> 01:57:47.480 align:start position:0%
track would probably have to be used
 
01:57:51.430 --> 01:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
State money to do it because the com
 
01:57:52.910 --> 01:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
current company
 
01:57:55.430 --> 01:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
I mean if they were going to do rail
 
01:57:57.669 --> 01:57:57.679 align:start position:0%
they would be doing it I mean commuter
 
01:57:59.950 --> 01:57:59.960 align:start position:0%
rail they would be doing it and nobody
 
01:58:01.910 --> 01:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
wants to do
 
01:58:06.950 --> 01:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
it follow up thank you um the situation
 
01:58:10.510 --> 01:58:10.520 align:start position:0%
I'm imagining is say the co Scenic the
 
01:58:12.669 --> 01:58:12.679 align:start position:0%
conoy Scenic Railway says we have some
 
01:58:14.709 --> 01:58:14.719 align:start position:0%
broken track we're a wonderful employer
 
01:58:16.030 --> 01:58:16.040 align:start position:0%
in the state we're a great tourist
 
01:58:18.270 --> 01:58:18.280 align:start position:0%
attraction could the state pitch in a
 
01:58:21.189 --> 01:58:21.199 align:start position:0%
little bit to help us repair this track
 
01:58:22.510 --> 01:58:22.520 align:start position:0%
and with this law we would would have to
 
01:58:25.750 --> 01:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
say no we absolutely cannot do
 
01:58:28.870 --> 01:58:28.880 align:start position:0%
that am I understanding this correctly
 
01:58:31.310 --> 01:58:31.320 align:start position:0%
we have a budget problem now how much
 
01:58:33.470 --> 01:58:33.480 align:start position:0%
money are we going to spend and where
 
01:58:37.629 --> 01:58:37.639 align:start position:0%
are we going to get the money to spend
 
01:58:39.950 --> 01:58:39.960 align:start position:0%
it thank
 
01:58:43.189 --> 01:58:43.199 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:58:47.189 --> 01:58:47.199 align:start position:0%
Newman yes thank you um I had just read
 
01:58:49.589 --> 01:58:49.599 align:start position:0%
an article uh a few days ago about the
 
01:58:52.709 --> 01:58:52.719 align:start position:0%
Cog Railway is looking to go electri now
 
01:58:57.589 --> 01:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
that gets State support so how would
 
01:59:01.189 --> 01:59:01.199 align:start position:0%
passage of this legislation affect work
 
01:59:03.870 --> 01:59:03.880 align:start position:0%
that's going on with that isn't the Cog
 
01:59:06.589 --> 01:59:06.599 align:start position:0%
Railway owned by is that estate owned
 
01:59:09.950 --> 01:59:09.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of it's not here copy the
 
01:59:12.790 --> 01:59:12.800 align:start position:0%
article oh I'm s I'm not aware that I
 
01:59:14.589 --> 01:59:14.599 align:start position:0%
thought that was a private
 
01:59:18.669 --> 01:59:18.679 align:start position:0%
owned it does get State support whatever
 
01:59:20.790 --> 01:59:20.800 align:start position:0%
the definition of of that could
 
01:59:22.589 --> 01:59:22.599 align:start position:0%
Encompass so
 
01:59:24.550 --> 01:59:24.560 align:start position:0%
I guess I would put that question to you
 
01:59:27.589 --> 01:59:27.599 align:start position:0%
what would you see to that could that
 
01:59:29.470 --> 01:59:29.480 align:start position:0%
stop everything but I think the Cog
 
01:59:31.669 --> 01:59:31.679 align:start position:0%
Railway I mean that's pretty much
 
01:59:35.550 --> 01:59:35.560 align:start position:0%
self-supporting and I think if you
 
01:59:39.229 --> 01:59:39.239 align:start position:0%
know it it does have state support I
 
01:59:40.830 --> 01:59:40.840 align:start position:0%
guess I I'll leave it at that I don't
 
01:59:43.189 --> 01:59:43.199 align:start position:0%
know to what to what the amount is I'm
 
01:59:45.510 --> 01:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
not aware of that like
 
01:59:48.830 --> 01:59:48.840 align:start position:0%
okay yeah and repres I'm going to step
 
01:59:53.589 --> 01:59:53.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:56.069 --> 01:59:56.079 align:start position:0%
conversation limited to this current
 
01:59:58.910 --> 01:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
bill right now and I I I think I might
 
02:00:00.830 --> 02:00:00.840 align:start position:0%
be able to help on some of this this
 
02:00:03.109 --> 02:00:03.119 align:start position:0%
bill does say it prohibits prohibits the
 
02:00:06.390 --> 02:00:06.400 align:start position:0%
use of State funds for new passenger
 
02:00:09.430 --> 02:00:09.440 align:start position:0%

02:00:22.470 --> 02:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
bill it says for the planning
 
02:00:24.589 --> 02:00:24.599 align:start position:0%

02:00:30.750 --> 02:00:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:34.430 --> 02:00:34.440 align:start position:0%
new don't sounds like
 
02:00:38.229 --> 02:00:38.239 align:start position:0%
it maybe an amendment is needed maybe it
 
02:00:41.629 --> 02:00:41.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:44.270 --> 02:00:44.280 align:start position:0%

02:01:18.109 --> 02:01:18.119 align:start position:0%
lonia uh a couple things on some of this
 
02:01:20.270 --> 02:01:20.280 align:start position:0%
I first of all getting back to the last
 
02:01:22.790 --> 02:01:22.800 align:start position:0%
time the commuter train ran from Boston
 
02:01:25.350 --> 02:01:25.360 align:start position:0%
to conquer excuse
 
02:01:28.390 --> 02:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
me that uh ended in 1980 I believe it
 
02:01:30.510 --> 02:01:30.520 align:start position:0%
was in January February of 1980 there's
 
02:01:32.709 --> 02:01:32.719 align:start position:0%
been nothing since then up through that
 
02:01:34.910 --> 02:01:34.920 align:start position:0%
Corridor and we're talking about the
 
02:01:36.629 --> 02:01:36.639 align:start position:0%
railroad company that owns that track
 
02:01:39.470 --> 02:01:39.480 align:start position:0%
now South that CSX now uh the people
 
02:01:41.669 --> 02:01:41.679 align:start position:0%
that owned them before Guilford uh spent
 
02:01:43.589 --> 02:01:43.599 align:start position:0%
no money on the tracks and it was indeed
 
02:01:46.669 --> 02:01:46.679 align:start position:0%
10 to 15 miles an hour CSX is now in the
 
02:01:49.270 --> 02:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
progress of upgrading all their track uh
 
02:01:50.830 --> 02:01:50.840 align:start position:0%
throughout New England with since
 
02:01:52.589 --> 02:01:52.599 align:start position:0%
they've bought all this track uh and you
 
02:01:54.030 --> 02:01:54.040 align:start position:0%
can see their equipment out there
 
02:01:55.870 --> 02:01:55.880 align:start position:0%
working all the
 
02:02:00.109 --> 02:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
time the down Easter was mentioned uh
 
02:02:01.390 --> 02:02:01.400 align:start position:0%
obviously I'm not in support of this
 
02:02:03.790 --> 02:02:03.800 align:start position:0%
bill the down Easter has been mentioned
 
02:02:07.310 --> 02:02:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:09.790 --> 02:02:09.800 align:start position:0%
times if you're on that train which I am
 
02:02:13.270 --> 02:02:13.280 align:start position:0%
a lot because I I just can't stand 93 so
 
02:02:16.229 --> 02:02:16.239 align:start position:0%
I go drive the DOA to catch it to Boston
 
02:02:18.950 --> 02:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh on days when there are Red Sox games
 
02:02:21.950 --> 02:02:21.960 align:start position:0%
um Celtics Bruins the train is full of
 
02:02:24.629 --> 02:02:24.639 align:start position:0%
their fans so for somebody to say that
 
02:02:26.550 --> 02:02:26.560 align:start position:0%
that doesn't happen that that's just not
 
02:02:28.350 --> 02:02:28.360 align:start position:0%
the case and I would encourage you to
 
02:02:30.350 --> 02:02:30.360 align:start position:0%
take the train on those days to see it
 
02:02:33.589 --> 02:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
there are five train sets a day running
 
02:02:36.870 --> 02:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
between Brunswick Maine and
 
02:02:39.430 --> 02:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
Boston many many many New Hampshire
 
02:02:42.470 --> 02:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
people get on in exiter Dover and even
 
02:02:45.910 --> 02:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
Durham uh I watch them this past month
 
02:02:49.709 --> 02:02:49.719 align:start position:0%
the train uh reached its 10 millionth
 
02:02:52.709 --> 02:02:52.719 align:start position:0%
passenger that was my briefcase my 10th
 
02:02:55.669 --> 02:02:55.679 align:start position:0%
million it's 10th million passenger the
 
02:02:57.990 --> 02:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
train has been doing
 
02:03:01.550 --> 02:03:01.560 align:start position:0%
fine um so what I did when this bill
 
02:03:02.629 --> 02:03:02.639 align:start position:0%
came up
 
02:03:05.470 --> 02:03:05.480 align:start position:0%
before was I put a petition at my
 
02:03:07.430 --> 02:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
business up in lonia and I just set it
 
02:03:09.470 --> 02:03:09.480 align:start position:0%
there I didn't talk to many people about
 
02:03:12.149 --> 02:03:12.159 align:start position:0%
it when I did they would usually uh just
 
02:03:14.589 --> 02:03:14.599 align:start position:0%
say what with regards to this bill so I
 
02:03:16.830 --> 02:03:16.840 align:start position:0%
want to hand these in it just says we
 
02:03:19.030 --> 02:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
the undersign request the state of New
 
02:03:20.629 --> 02:03:20.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire invest in the development of
 
02:03:21.750 --> 02:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
Passenger rail service through
 
02:03:25.109 --> 02:03:25.119 align:start position:0%
throughout the state where possible I am
 
02:03:26.709 --> 02:03:26.719 align:start position:0%
a resident of New Hampshire there's
 
02:03:29.069 --> 02:03:29.079 align:start position:0%
approximately 600 here if I had made
 
02:03:30.950 --> 02:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
this my goal in life I could have had
 
02:03:32.629 --> 02:03:32.639 align:start position:0%
thousands and there's no doubt about
 
02:03:35.030 --> 02:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
that I was encouraged to do an online
 
02:03:38.149 --> 02:03:38.159 align:start position:0%
petition but I thought this would look a
 
02:03:42.109 --> 02:03:42.119 align:start position:0%
little more uh just look a little more
 
02:03:44.629 --> 02:03:44.639 align:start position:0%
power to it so I I'll leave that here
 
02:03:46.430 --> 02:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
and uh please uh if you're not going to
 
02:03:48.430 --> 02:03:48.440 align:start position:0%
use them I'd love to have it back I want
 
02:03:50.750 --> 02:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
to remind everybody that we all know
 
02:03:52.270 --> 02:03:52.280 align:start position:0%
public transportation
 
02:03:54.950 --> 02:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
never pays for itself the airlines are
 
02:03:57.229 --> 02:03:57.239 align:start position:0%
subsidized we subsidize the bus to
 
02:03:59.549 --> 02:03:59.559 align:start position:0%
Boston some of the buses say right on
 
02:04:01.990 --> 02:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
them owned and operated by New Hampshire
 
02:04:04.589 --> 02:04:04.599 align:start position:0%
do I have no problem with that that's
 
02:04:06.589 --> 02:04:06.599 align:start position:0%
called a wide openen public
 
02:04:08.990 --> 02:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
transportation system one shoe does not
 
02:04:12.830 --> 02:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
fit all we support the Airlines lonia
 
02:04:15.350 --> 02:04:15.360 align:start position:0%
airport gets an incredible amount of
 
02:04:17.709 --> 02:04:17.719 align:start position:0%
government subsidy there's not even any
 
02:04:20.510 --> 02:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
commercial flights out of there this is
 
02:04:23.149 --> 02:04:23.159 align:start position:0%

02:04:26.709 --> 02:04:26.719 align:start position:0%

they just really don't understand why
 
02:05:42.109 --> 02:05:42.119 align:start position:0%
this hasn't already been done I remind
 
02:05:44.350 --> 02:05:44.360 align:start position:0%
everybody that the initial startup would
 
02:05:47.990 --> 02:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
be with Federal money our tax dollars
 
02:05:50.470 --> 02:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
coming back to help us in New Hampshire
 
02:05:52.310 --> 02:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
what a what a switch that with would be
 
02:05:53.830 --> 02:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
because when we don't take that money
 
02:05:55.189 --> 02:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
that's out there for this type of
 
02:05:56.790 --> 02:05:56.800 align:start position:0%
Transportation it just goes to other
 
02:05:58.589 --> 02:05:58.599 align:start position:0%
states they're there with their hands
 
02:05:59.990 --> 02:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
wide open saying yeah we'll take it
 
02:06:02.030 --> 02:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
we'll take it this would be a a
 
02:06:05.109 --> 02:06:05.119 align:start position:0%
wonderful boom not just for commuter but
 
02:06:07.189 --> 02:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
for tourism you again you take the down
 
02:06:09.310 --> 02:06:09.320 align:start position:0%
Easter you'll see people on there with
 
02:06:11.430 --> 02:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
suitcases look at the development that's
 
02:06:13.950 --> 02:06:13.960 align:start position:0%
going on in DOA around the station it's
 
02:06:15.350 --> 02:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
incredible the buildings that have gone
 
02:06:18.830 --> 02:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
up all housing and because people will
 
02:06:20.430 --> 02:06:20.440 align:start position:0%
take the train they want to live near
 
02:06:22.830 --> 02:06:22.840 align:start position:0%
the station and dover's done a great job
 
02:06:26.270 --> 02:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
of uh reaching out to that so there's so
 
02:06:28.589 --> 02:06:28.599 align:start position:0%
much of it out there I made the offer
 
02:06:30.229 --> 02:06:30.239 align:start position:0%
the last time I spoke here if somebody
 
02:06:31.830 --> 02:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't know about the down Easter I'll
 
02:06:33.830 --> 02:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
be more than happy to purchase you a
 
02:06:36.669 --> 02:06:36.679 align:start position:0%
ticket and take you on a tour I believe
 
02:06:40.030 --> 02:06:40.040 align:start position:0%
I've done that with one of your uh
 
02:06:42.629 --> 02:06:42.639 align:start position:0%
members here uh just to show how many
 
02:06:44.669 --> 02:06:44.679 align:start position:0%
people get on in New Hampshire and how
 
02:06:46.390 --> 02:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
many people move to New Hampshire
 
02:06:47.549 --> 02:06:47.559 align:start position:0%
because they didn't want to live in
 
02:06:49.709 --> 02:06:49.719 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts so they moved here yes
 
02:06:51.950 --> 02:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
they work in Massachusetts but they now
 
02:06:53.549 --> 02:06:53.559 align:start position:0%
live in New Hampshire the residents here
 
02:06:56.069 --> 02:06:56.079 align:start position:0%
they pay taxes it it's it helps the
 
02:06:59.069 --> 02:06:59.079 align:start position:0%
bottom line right across the
 
02:07:02.069 --> 02:07:02.079 align:start position:0%
board I think you just a quick followup
 
02:07:05.430 --> 02:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
follow if you would uh so okay we
 
02:07:08.510 --> 02:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned going Southbound but is it
 
02:07:10.830 --> 02:07:10.840 align:start position:0%
sounds like it's almost possible for
 
02:07:13.870 --> 02:07:13.880 align:start position:0%
commuters that come Northbound to go to
 
02:07:15.750 --> 02:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
events you mentioned the the ball game
 
02:07:18.790 --> 02:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
in in in Manchester but also to to work
 
02:07:21.149 --> 02:07:21.159 align:start position:0%
is it possible for those commuters who
 
02:07:21.159 --> 02:07:22.390 align:start position:0%
is it possible for those commuters who
live

02:07:22.390 --> 02:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
live
 
02:07:24.589 --> 02:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
us down the line to come Northbound to
 
02:07:26.549 --> 02:07:26.559 align:start position:0%
work in places like Nashville or
 
02:07:29.830 --> 02:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
Manchester um knowing too that uh the C
 
02:07:32.870 --> 02:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
the Alantic Chambers the Alantic uh
 
02:07:36.310 --> 02:07:36.320 align:start position:0%
Committee in in nashille voted to um to
 
02:07:40.310 --> 02:07:40.320 align:start position:0%
put the uh put the rail uh study into
 
02:07:42.589 --> 02:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
the into the budget for next year as
 
02:07:44.390 --> 02:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
opposed to passing it in this past
 
02:07:46.709 --> 02:07:46.719 align:start position:0%
session this in a bill with other B with
 
02:07:49.629 --> 02:07:49.639 align:start position:0%
other uh bills uh so would that is that
 
02:07:52.189 --> 02:07:52.199 align:start position:0%
possible as well oh question is and I
 
02:07:53.629 --> 02:07:53.639 align:start position:0%
and I agree with the people that say
 
02:07:55.189 --> 02:07:55.199 align:start position:0%
we've studied this stuff to death and
 
02:07:56.870 --> 02:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
they're spending a lot of money studying
 
02:07:58.470 --> 02:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
something year after year when new
 
02:08:00.629 --> 02:08:00.639 align:start position:0%
members come into the government uh I
 
02:08:03.149 --> 02:08:03.159 align:start position:0%
would just say take a look over to the
 
02:08:05.510 --> 02:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
coastal communities and how they've
 
02:08:09.109 --> 02:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
profited from this and how um how the
 
02:08:12.990 --> 02:08:13.000 align:start position:0%
state of Maine is now lengthened the the
 
02:08:15.950 --> 02:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
um the route that the Train's gone over
 
02:08:18.430 --> 02:08:18.440 align:start position:0%
there I mean this is not not rocket
 
02:08:20.790 --> 02:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
science I don't think I it's going to
 
02:08:22.830 --> 02:08:22.840 align:start position:0%
cost money everything we do cost money
 
02:08:24.310 --> 02:08:24.320 align:start position:0%
with regards to
 
02:08:24.320 --> 02:08:26.549 align:start position:0%
with regards to
Transportation

02:08:26.549 --> 02:08:26.559 align:start position:0%

the union leader what a boondoggle that
 
02:09:24.149 --> 02:09:24.159 align:start position:0%
was going to be in a waste of tax tax
 
02:09:25.910 --> 02:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
money because nobody was going to ride
 
02:09:28.870 --> 02:09:28.880 align:start position:0%

representative St Clair for taking my CH
 
02:10:20.270 --> 02:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
uh question in your previous testimony
 
02:10:23.149 --> 02:10:23.159 align:start position:0%
you talked anecdotally about the Fisher
 
02:10:26.229 --> 02:10:26.239 align:start position:0%
Cats management team enjoying the idea
 
02:10:28.750 --> 02:10:28.760 align:start position:0%
of traffic coming up from Boston to
 
02:10:31.950 --> 02:10:31.960 align:start position:0%
Manchester the question is is there any
 
02:10:34.549 --> 02:10:34.559 align:start position:0%
data from the down Easter that would
 
02:10:37.030 --> 02:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
support Northbound traffic going to
 
02:10:38.669 --> 02:10:38.679 align:start position:0%
Portland Main to see the Sea Dogs at
 
02:10:41.069 --> 02:10:41.079 align:start position:0%
adlock field I am absolutely positive
 
02:10:43.270 --> 02:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
there would be that data uh and I think
 
02:10:45.629 --> 02:10:45.639 align:start position:0%
that it would be very easy to uh to
 
02:10:48.629 --> 02:10:48.639 align:start position:0%
reach out and get that uh the down
 
02:10:50.589 --> 02:10:50.599 align:start position:0%
Easter's headquarters is in Portland
 
02:10:52.990 --> 02:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
Maine I do not have the woman's name in
 
02:10:54.390 --> 02:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
front of me that's in charge of that but
 
02:10:57.589 --> 02:10:57.599 align:start position:0%
they keep very good records of of uh all
 
02:10:59.390 --> 02:10:59.400 align:start position:0%
their passengers the tickets they sell
 
02:11:01.350 --> 02:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
where they get on where they get off
 
02:11:03.950 --> 02:11:03.960 align:start position:0%
they're very good at that so I would
 
02:11:06.390 --> 02:11:06.400 align:start position:0%
that can be found easily and if somebody
 
02:11:08.510 --> 02:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to do it and I was tasked
 
02:11:09.709 --> 02:11:09.719 align:start position:0%
with doing that I'd be more than happy
 
02:11:11.950 --> 02:11:11.960 align:start position:0%

02:11:14.350 --> 02:11:14.360 align:start position:0%

about the the possibility of rail coming
 
02:11:21.639 --> 02:11:23.310 align:start position:0%
about the the possibility of rail coming
north

02:11:23.310 --> 02:11:23.320 align:start position:0%

of this bill uh I think I wrote on the
 
02:12:31.950 --> 02:12:31.960 align:start position:0%
card I'm going to take a minute maybe
 
02:12:36.750 --> 02:12:36.760 align:start position:0%
two so I'm I'm going to be blunt um I
 
02:12:38.350 --> 02:12:38.360 align:start position:0%
budgets are about
 
02:12:41.310 --> 02:12:41.320 align:start position:0%
priorities uh as I look at the budget uh
 
02:12:45.270 --> 02:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
we have uh a lot of priorities uh we
 
02:12:48.589 --> 02:12:48.599 align:start position:0%
have potentially needing to step in and
 
02:12:52.030 --> 02:12:52.040 align:start position:0%
and do a better job funding our pensions
 
02:12:55.549 --> 02:12:55.559 align:start position:0%
uh we need to take a look at upgrading
 
02:12:57.790 --> 02:12:57.800 align:start position:0%
um uh the state contributions to
 
02:13:00.229 --> 02:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
education we're still liable for a
 
02:13:03.270 --> 02:13:03.280 align:start position:0%
massive lawsuit related to
 
02:13:08.109 --> 02:13:08.119 align:start position:0%
YDC um so for the next few years I think
 
02:13:11.750 --> 02:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
we have some very strategic things that
 
02:13:15.510 --> 02:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
we need to U uh keep our eye on and as a
 
02:13:18.350 --> 02:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
risk mitigation approach I do not think
 
02:13:22.069 --> 02:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
we should be taking on uh new spending
 
02:13:22.079 --> 02:13:23.069 align:start position:0%
we should be taking on uh new spending
uh

02:13:23.069 --> 02:13:23.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:13:25.709 --> 02:13:25.719 align:start position:0%
possibilities uh I don't think a
 
02:13:28.390 --> 02:13:28.400 align:start position:0%
passenger train is paid for itself
 
02:13:30.109 --> 02:13:30.119 align:start position:0%
anywhere in the United States I believe
 
02:13:33.270 --> 02:13:33.280 align:start position:0%
the previous testimony uh uh of the
 
02:13:35.629 --> 02:13:35.639 align:start position:0%
representative in favor of this bill
 
02:13:38.830 --> 02:13:38.840 align:start position:0%
stated that uh I have um a lot of
 
02:13:41.189 --> 02:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
experience having lived in California
 
02:13:44.390 --> 02:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
with the uh the bullet train to Nowhere
 
02:13:47.030 --> 02:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
um uh they they've spent billions on
 
02:13:49.510 --> 02:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
that it caused them to take their eye
 
02:13:52.870 --> 02:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
off the ball they didn't invest in fire
 
02:13:56.229 --> 02:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
prevention and and uh fire reduction and
 
02:13:59.189 --> 02:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
so that that's a real world example of
 
02:14:01.430 --> 02:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
how trying to spend too much money and
 
02:14:03.589 --> 02:14:03.599 align:start position:0%
not keeping your priorities straight
 
02:14:07.149 --> 02:14:07.159 align:start position:0%
lead to other disasters and so so I I
 
02:14:09.790 --> 02:14:09.800 align:start position:0%
would just encourage us to continue
 
02:14:12.790 --> 02:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
moratorium on spending General funds on
 
02:14:15.669 --> 02:14:15.679 align:start position:0%
H this particular project because uh
 
02:14:17.830 --> 02:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
there there are vastly more ways to
 
02:14:20.750 --> 02:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
spend our money that would probably do
 
02:14:23.270 --> 02:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
better for all of our citizens that
 
02:14:24.669 --> 02:14:24.679 align:start position:0%
that's my testimony thank you
 
02:14:26.750 --> 02:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
representative will you take questions
 
02:14:31.510 --> 02:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:34.310 --> 02:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
Edwards representative Boyd thank you Mr
 
02:14:36.189 --> 02:14:36.199 align:start position:0%
chairman representative Edwards thank
 
02:14:38.149 --> 02:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question would you
 
02:14:39.910 --> 02:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
believe that the proposed nashille
 
02:14:41.870 --> 02:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
Manchester conquered line goes through
 
02:14:44.549 --> 02:14:44.559 align:start position:0%
an8 Mile Stretch of rail in the town of
 
02:14:46.189 --> 02:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
marac which would impact four
 
02:14:48.189 --> 02:14:48.199 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods and require the town to
 
02:14:50.790 --> 02:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
spend 60 million taxpayer dollars to
 
02:14:52.669 --> 02:14:52.679 align:start position:0%
move of the town's own sewer intercept a
 
02:14:54.390 --> 02:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
line with no train station being
 
02:14:57.950 --> 02:14:57.960 align:start position:0%
proposed for the town uh that's not at
 
02:14:59.950 --> 02:14:59.960 align:start position:0%
all surprising that's what happens when
 
02:15:02.390 --> 02:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
Central planning steps in and and
 
02:15:04.750 --> 02:15:04.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't take a look at the real local
 
02:15:06.750 --> 02:15:06.760 align:start position:0%
needs that's why this is better done by
 
02:15:09.310 --> 02:15:09.320 align:start position:0%
the private sector I'd also point out
 
02:15:12.629 --> 02:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
that that line of rail would not benefit
 
02:15:15.470 --> 02:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
the the citizens of of Chester Auburn
 
02:15:17.189 --> 02:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
candy or deer
 
02:15:19.910 --> 02:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
Deerfield thank you Mr chairman any
 
02:15:21.910 --> 02:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
02:15:24.430 --> 02:15:24.440 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards you got off easy
 
02:15:26.750 --> 02:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for your
 
02:15:31.629 --> 02:15:31.639 align:start position:0%

launch Peggy Gilmore please welcome to
 
02:15:35.280 --> 02:15:36.109 align:start position:0%
launch Peggy Gilmore please welcome to
public

02:15:36.109 --> 02:15:36.119 align:start position:0%
public
 
02:15:38.589 --> 02:15:38.599 align:start position:0%
works and you are from the nationville
 
02:15:45.310 --> 02:15:45.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:47.830 --> 02:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
Commerce that's correct and thank you Mr
 
02:15:50.310 --> 02:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
chair for the record Peggy Gilmore
 
02:15:51.910 --> 02:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
representing the greater nashille
 
02:15:53.950 --> 02:15:53.960 align:start position:0%
Chamber of Commerce I hadn't planned to
 
02:15:56.950 --> 02:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
speak but but did want to bring uh the
 
02:15:59.870 --> 02:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
business perspective to this the Nash
 
02:16:03.109 --> 02:16:03.119 align:start position:0%
chamber has long supported the potential
 
02:16:06.310 --> 02:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
I say the potential for having passenger
 
02:16:09.870 --> 02:16:09.880 align:start position:0%
rail that would come to nashille and
 
02:16:13.109 --> 02:16:13.119 align:start position:0%
onto Manchester and perhaps onto conquer
 
02:16:15.350 --> 02:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
but that really
 
02:16:19.470 --> 02:16:19.480 align:start position:0%
wasn't so much um in the feasibility of
 
02:16:21.510 --> 02:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
the feasibility
 
02:16:23.750 --> 02:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
and the reason that the chamber has
 
02:16:26.830 --> 02:16:26.840 align:start position:0%
supported this is because the proven
 
02:16:29.510 --> 02:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
Economic Development that's shown when
 
02:16:33.429 --> 02:16:33.439 align:start position:0%
there is uh good Transportation good
 
02:16:38.790 --> 02:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
rail service through an area also uh the
 
02:16:41.830 --> 02:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
stay workor play or people who have
 
02:16:46.950 --> 02:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
looked at what uh incentivizes young
 
02:16:50.309 --> 02:16:50.319 align:start position:0%
people to live in the southern part of
 
02:16:51.589 --> 02:16:51.599 align:start position:0%
the state
 
02:16:55.910 --> 02:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
particularly is access to Boston and so
 
02:16:59.349 --> 02:16:59.359 align:start position:0%
it's seen as the the potential for rail
 
02:17:02.870 --> 02:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
passenger rail Boston to man to
 
02:17:05.870 --> 02:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
Nashville and Manchester is seen as an
 
02:17:09.150 --> 02:17:09.160 align:start position:0%
incentivize to bring young people here
 
02:17:13.070 --> 02:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
and the rail goes two ways and we have
 
02:17:18.549 --> 02:17:18.559 align:start position:0%
seen a bad Workforce shortage in the in
 
02:17:21.509 --> 02:17:21.519 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and there is able
 
02:17:24.190 --> 02:17:24.200 align:start position:0%
Workforce we have on our
 
02:17:27.150 --> 02:17:27.160 align:start position:0%
board uh someone who runs a staffing
 
02:17:32.349 --> 02:17:32.359 align:start position:0%
agency and she has said if she could get
 
02:17:36.589 --> 02:17:36.599 align:start position:0%
ra pass an easy passenger transport to
 
02:17:40.389 --> 02:17:40.399 align:start position:0%
Nashua she could fill several jobs so
 
02:17:43.790 --> 02:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
that's anecdotal the other thing I'd
 
02:17:48.270 --> 02:17:48.280 align:start position:0%
say as a prior legislature it to
 
02:17:53.750 --> 02:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
me it's not good policy to prohibit
 
02:17:57.070 --> 02:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
something now not knowing what the
 
02:18:00.270 --> 02:18:00.280 align:start position:0%
future will bring as representative Jack
 
02:18:03.030 --> 02:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
said this particular project is not
 
02:18:05.629 --> 02:18:05.639 align:start position:0%
currently in the 10-year plan but who
 
02:18:08.270 --> 02:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
knows what we're going to
 
02:18:11.870 --> 02:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
want and how we're going to set our
 
02:18:16.669 --> 02:18:16.679 align:start position:0%
priorities as the future comes um things
 
02:18:19.790 --> 02:18:19.800 align:start position:0%
change Transportation has changed we see
 
02:18:22.070 --> 02:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
it we don't know what changes are going
 
02:18:25.429 --> 02:18:25.439 align:start position:0%
to come and we don't know what the
 
02:18:28.429 --> 02:18:28.439 align:start position:0%
future will bring around this and so it
 
02:18:31.589 --> 02:18:31.599 align:start position:0%
seems that it's not a good idea to
 
02:18:33.910 --> 02:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
prohibit something not knowing what will
 
02:18:37.629 --> 02:18:37.639 align:start position:0%
be the future and this committee this
 
02:18:40.190 --> 02:18:40.200 align:start position:0%
this I think is the third time this bill
 
02:18:43.070 --> 02:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
has come before this committee first
 
02:18:47.349 --> 02:18:47.359 align:start position:0%
time it was somewhere it was uh
 
02:18:51.990 --> 02:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
itl and the last time it was retain
 
02:18:55.629 --> 02:18:55.639 align:start position:0%
and so when you looked at it in the
 
02:18:58.990 --> 02:18:59.000 align:start position:0%
fall uh this committee I believe voted
 
02:19:02.709 --> 02:19:02.719 align:start position:0%
unanimously not to recommend future
 
02:19:06.030 --> 02:19:06.040 align:start position:0%
legislation and here is the future
 
02:19:10.110 --> 02:19:10.120 align:start position:0%
legislation so just saying that you've
 
02:19:13.030 --> 02:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
had it you've done it it maybe it's time
 
02:19:14.589 --> 02:19:14.599 align:start position:0%
to stop
 
02:19:21.549 --> 02:19:21.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:24.669 --> 02:19:24.679 align:start position:0%
representative cier chairman now hasn't
 
02:19:29.110 --> 02:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
remember when uh as I said in 2019 and
 
02:19:32.750 --> 02:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
and 20 when the our committee passed a
 
02:19:35.469 --> 02:19:35.479 align:start position:0%
bill that then Senator melan Lake
 
02:19:37.709 --> 02:19:37.719 align:start position:0%
sponsored or an engineering project and
 
02:19:39.910 --> 02:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
we got it through the house no it was a
 
02:19:41.469 --> 02:19:41.479 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill I'm stand correct it was a
 
02:19:44.030 --> 02:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
Senate bill it it was passed the Senate
 
02:19:46.990 --> 02:19:47.000 align:start position:0%
came to the house this committee voted
 
02:19:49.630 --> 02:19:49.640 align:start position:0%
it out we passed it on the house floor
 
02:19:51.150 --> 02:19:51.160 align:start position:0%
and then the governor
 
02:19:53.389 --> 02:19:53.399 align:start position:0%
uh just uh let it become law without his
 
02:19:55.750 --> 02:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
signature then Governor sonunu so
 
02:19:57.630 --> 02:19:57.640 align:start position:0%
something was started and some money I
 
02:20:00.190 --> 02:20:00.200 align:start position:0%
think was appropriate for an engineering
 
02:20:01.510 --> 02:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
study and I don't know if you can
 
02:20:03.510 --> 02:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
comment on that and some of the data
 
02:20:06.469 --> 02:20:06.479 align:start position:0%
that this study has uh uncovered so far
 
02:20:08.550 --> 02:20:08.560 align:start position:0%
about how much it would cost a construct
 
02:20:13.030 --> 02:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
passenger Rail between uh Manchester
 
02:20:16.870 --> 02:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
Manchester and the mass
 
02:20:21.910 --> 02:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
line uh I can't uh speak to that study
 
02:20:23.910 --> 02:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
the the results of that study in a way
 
02:20:25.710 --> 02:20:25.720 align:start position:0%
that I would be comfortable bringing
 
02:20:29.790 --> 02:20:29.800 align:start position:0%
forth right today but I will say when
 
02:20:33.870 --> 02:20:33.880 align:start position:0%
the final part of that study was stopped
 
02:20:36.590 --> 02:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
because the executive Council didn't
 
02:20:41.590 --> 02:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate the funds um you know again
 
02:20:43.830 --> 02:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
if you a couple of people I think
 
02:20:46.510 --> 02:20:46.520 align:start position:0%
representative voy has asked for data or
 
02:20:48.830 --> 02:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
people have asked for data you can't
 
02:20:51.830 --> 02:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
have the data to make your decision if
 
02:20:51.840 --> 02:20:52.910 align:start position:0%
have the data to make your decision if
you

02:20:52.910 --> 02:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:20:56.910 --> 02:20:56.920 align:start position:0%
don't get the data and so to prohibit
 
02:20:59.510 --> 02:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
the the continuation of a study which
 
02:21:03.550 --> 02:21:03.560 align:start position:0%
would complete the data again I think is
 
02:21:08.150 --> 02:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:10.830 --> 02:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
policy any further
 
02:21:13.750 --> 02:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
02:21:21.510 --> 02:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:22.990 --> 02:21:23.000 align:start position:0%
I call
 
02:21:27.830 --> 02:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
on Shelly Winters from the do please to
 
02:21:35.550 --> 02:21:35.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:37.670 --> 02:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
works so again for the record my name is
 
02:21:39.150 --> 02:21:39.160 align:start position:0%
shelle Winters I'm the director of the
 
02:21:41.070 --> 02:21:41.080 align:start position:0%
division of Aeronautics Rail and Transit
 
02:21:42.630 --> 02:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
at the Department of
 
02:21:45.190 --> 02:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
Transportation um and here to oppose
 
02:21:47.309 --> 02:21:47.319 align:start position:0%
again I'm not here to advocate for the
 
02:21:49.030 --> 02:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Capital Corridor project
 
02:21:50.830 --> 02:21:50.840 align:start position:0%
which has been bandied about just
 
02:21:53.670 --> 02:21:53.680 align:start position:0%
looking at the wording of the bill um
 
02:21:55.950 --> 02:21:55.960 align:start position:0%
we're really here to express a concern
 
02:21:59.230 --> 02:21:59.240 align:start position:0%
about leaving future options open and
 
02:22:00.870 --> 02:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
also point out a concern which is
 
02:22:03.110 --> 02:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
brought up by some others that testified
 
02:22:05.270 --> 02:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
on the committee about the specific
 
02:22:08.349 --> 02:22:08.359 align:start position:0%
wording using passenger rail the title
 
02:22:10.429 --> 02:22:10.439 align:start position:0%
again is clear says new when you get
 
02:22:13.750 --> 02:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
into the text of um the bill it does not
 
02:22:16.590 --> 02:22:16.600 align:start position:0%
use the term new and it converts from
 
02:22:18.429 --> 02:22:18.439 align:start position:0%
using commuter rail down to passenger
 
02:22:20.550 --> 02:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
rail that's been a question we've had
 
02:22:22.230 --> 02:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
had as a department the last three times
 
02:22:24.309 --> 02:22:24.319 align:start position:0%
this has been brought forward is what is
 
02:22:27.670 --> 02:22:27.680 align:start position:0%
the definition of Passenger rail that
 
02:22:29.910 --> 02:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
could that be construed to include the
 
02:22:32.830 --> 02:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
existing um Amtrak Services both stop
 
02:22:34.030 --> 02:22:34.040 align:start position:0%
with the stoping Claremont on the
 
02:22:35.670 --> 02:22:35.680 align:start position:0%
Vermont on the vermonter and then the
 
02:22:39.270 --> 02:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
down Easter on do D do um Durham and
 
02:22:41.670 --> 02:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
exitor Does it include the Cog Railway
 
02:22:43.710 --> 02:22:43.720 align:start position:0%
Does it include Conway Scenic who is
 
02:22:45.510 --> 02:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
here to testify before that bring a lot
 
02:22:48.349 --> 02:22:48.359 align:start position:0%
of tourist um business into the state so
 
02:22:50.830 --> 02:22:50.840 align:start position:0%
again our concerns are about um the
 
02:22:53.429 --> 02:22:53.439 align:start position:0%
wording in line nine with passenger Rail
 
02:22:56.150 --> 02:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
and what that definition means and again
 
02:22:59.349 --> 02:22:59.359 align:start position:0%
tying our future selves and what is what
 
02:23:02.230 --> 02:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
do state funds really mean because as
 
02:23:04.790 --> 02:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
was brought up before the Cog and other
 
02:23:08.150 --> 02:23:08.160 align:start position:0%
railroads have accessed a revolving um
 
02:23:09.990 --> 02:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
railroad fund that's established under
 
02:23:13.870 --> 02:23:13.880 align:start position:0%
statute as under 228 66a the state has a
 
02:23:15.750 --> 02:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
revolving rail railroad fund where the
 
02:23:18.469 --> 02:23:18.479 align:start position:0%
state bonds and the railroads pay back
 
02:23:20.469 --> 02:23:20.479 align:start position:0%
over a 20 or 30-year period for the
 
02:23:22.950 --> 02:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
Investments that they make in in Rail
 
02:23:25.710 --> 02:23:25.720 align:start position:0%
lines and a lot of those are supporting
 
02:23:29.150 --> 02:23:29.160 align:start position:0%
um passeng passenger related um services
 
02:23:30.510 --> 02:23:30.520 align:start position:0%
and also the state has a special
 
02:23:32.590 --> 02:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
railroad fund which is EST established
 
02:23:34.670 --> 02:23:34.680 align:start position:0%
under statute um
 
02:23:38.269 --> 02:23:38.279 align:start position:0%
22868 it's a non-aps fund funds that uh
 
02:23:40.190 --> 02:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
are derived from the use of state-owned
 
02:23:41.870 --> 02:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
railroad properties are put into this
 
02:23:44.550 --> 02:23:44.560 align:start position:0%
restricted account and then reinvested
 
02:23:46.150 --> 02:23:46.160 align:start position:0%
by the department and again some of
 
02:23:48.070 --> 02:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
those tenant railroads that use our
 
02:23:50.590 --> 02:23:50.600 align:start position:0%
railroad lines are providing passenger
 
02:23:53.309 --> 02:23:53.319 align:start position:0%
related Services again not commuter but
 
02:23:55.990 --> 02:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
passenger related so um just I think we
 
02:23:58.910 --> 02:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to to focus on the wording and
 
02:24:01.269 --> 02:24:01.279 align:start position:0%
the intentionality of of the wording
 
02:24:02.590 --> 02:24:02.600 align:start position:0%
right now seems to be a little bit
 
02:24:04.269 --> 02:24:04.279 align:start position:0%
broader and that's been our testimony in
 
02:24:06.469 --> 02:24:06.479 align:start position:0%
the past as well we currently have
 
02:24:08.830 --> 02:24:08.840 align:start position:0%
nothing in the 10-year plan as was
 
02:24:11.150 --> 02:24:11.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned by representative Jack the um
 
02:24:13.990 --> 02:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
the last iteration of project 40818 came
 
02:24:17.349 --> 02:24:17.359 align:start position:0%
to an early conclusion in Winter of 2023
 
02:24:20.030 --> 02:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
we pulled that project number out of um
 
02:24:22.150 --> 02:24:22.160 align:start position:0%
an earlier 10-year plan there's nothing
 
02:24:25.269 --> 02:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
in our current 10-year plan relative to
 
02:24:27.750 --> 02:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
anything that would be by Any Other Name
 
02:24:29.990 --> 02:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
construed to mean a Commuter Rail
 
02:24:33.389 --> 02:24:33.399 align:start position:0%
Project between Massachusetts tasa
 
02:24:35.590 --> 02:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
Manchester or conquer so just wanted to
 
02:24:37.429 --> 02:24:37.439 align:start position:0%
provide that Clarity that we currently
 
02:24:39.469 --> 02:24:39.479 align:start position:0%
have nothing in our 10-year plan
 
02:24:41.670 --> 02:24:41.680 align:start position:0%
relative to the project with with the
 
02:24:44.110 --> 02:24:44.120 align:start position:0%
most attention here
 
02:24:47.550 --> 02:24:47.560 align:start position:0%
today any questions for Miss Winters
 
02:24:49.630 --> 02:24:49.640 align:start position:0%
representative Jack uh thank you Mr
 
02:24:52.469 --> 02:24:52.479 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you uh can you just
 
02:24:56.190 --> 02:24:56.200 align:start position:0%
clarify the the study that was stopped
 
02:24:58.870 --> 02:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
and Po and is posted on the website does
 
02:25:01.150 --> 02:25:01.160 align:start position:0%
it have the completed financial plan or
 
02:25:03.230 --> 02:25:03.240 align:start position:0%
did they need to do more work on that I
 
02:25:05.389 --> 02:25:05.399 align:start position:0%
had heard at one point the additional
 
02:25:07.070 --> 02:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
work they wanted to do was the new
 
02:25:08.750 --> 02:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
starts application
 
02:25:11.269 --> 02:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
only so the financial plan that is
 
02:25:14.150 --> 02:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
posted on our website is based on a 30%
 
02:25:17.030 --> 02:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
design level so um had we continued the
 
02:25:19.469 --> 02:25:19.479 align:start position:0%
design uh would have likely escalated
 
02:25:21.030 --> 02:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
that was also in the time period that
 
02:25:23.950 --> 02:25:23.960 align:start position:0%
PanAm was being acquired by CSX so
 
02:25:25.990 --> 02:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
additional conversations would have been
 
02:25:28.870 --> 02:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
had with CSX and with the MBTA to to
 
02:25:30.990 --> 02:25:31.000 align:start position:0%
talk about um additional needed
 
02:25:33.830 --> 02:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
improvements so um it's final based on
 
02:25:35.950 --> 02:25:35.960 align:start position:0%
the engineering done at the time and
 
02:25:39.349 --> 02:25:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:42.150 --> 02:25:42.160 align:start position:0%
so further questions representative
 
02:25:45.070 --> 02:25:45.080 align:start position:0%
cluder okay thank you Mr chairman again
 
02:25:49.389 --> 02:25:49.399 align:start position:0%
a 37 a 30% what is that again I'm sorry
 
02:25:51.710 --> 02:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
level I'm didn't get that design level
 
02:25:54.190 --> 02:25:54.200 align:start position:0%
design level thank you and a followup
 
02:25:57.269 --> 02:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
please followup would this bill as
 
02:26:00.750 --> 02:26:00.760 align:start position:0%
written ban future funding for
 
02:26:03.710 --> 02:26:03.720 align:start position:0%
improvements to such tourist as a Cog
 
02:26:05.790 --> 02:26:05.800 align:start position:0%
Railway and other legislations as you
 
02:26:09.469 --> 02:26:09.479 align:start position:0%
read it as it's written now I think
 
02:26:10.830 --> 02:26:10.840 align:start position:0%
that's our concern with the wording
 
02:26:13.190 --> 02:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
saying passenger Rail and note State
 
02:26:16.150 --> 02:26:16.160 align:start position:0%
funds without further Clarity to State
 
02:26:18.070 --> 02:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
funds being defined or passenger rail
 
02:26:20.349 --> 02:26:20.359 align:start position:0%
being defined there's a concern about
 
02:26:23.910 --> 02:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
the uh the broad application of that yes
 
02:26:23.920 --> 02:26:25.030 align:start position:0%
the uh the broad application of that yes
thank

02:26:25.030 --> 02:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:26:29.469 --> 02:26:29.479 align:start position:0%
you any further questions for Miss
 
02:26:32.510 --> 02:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
Winters representative alone thank you
 
02:26:34.190 --> 02:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I'm just going to follow up on
 
02:26:37.910 --> 02:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
that um mentioned earlier uh wur article
 
02:26:40.429 --> 02:26:40.439 align:start position:0%
about $1.2 million loan that was given
 
02:26:42.429 --> 02:26:42.439 align:start position:0%
to the Cog Railway are you familiar with
 
02:26:45.389 --> 02:26:45.399 align:start position:0%
that from that was done in the 20121 the
 
02:26:47.030 --> 02:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
dollar amount escapes me but the Cog
 
02:26:49.710 --> 02:26:49.720 align:start position:0%
rail Lo has applied and been a recipient
 
02:26:52.150 --> 02:26:52.160 align:start position:0%
of railroad revolving loan funds through
 
02:26:55.269 --> 02:26:55.279 align:start position:0%
the department correct follow followup
 
02:26:56.269 --> 02:26:56.279 align:start position:0%
there was also
 
02:26:59.030 --> 02:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
$160,000 that was uh awarded uh for
 
02:27:00.990 --> 02:27:01.000 align:start position:0%
other projects were you aware of that or
 
02:27:02.670 --> 02:27:02.680 align:start position:0%
something is that that fund that you
 
02:27:04.230 --> 02:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
were talking about that revolving fund
 
02:27:06.230 --> 02:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
that's the railroad revolving Loan Fund
 
02:27:08.070 --> 02:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
is restricted to um certain
 
02:27:10.349 --> 02:27:10.359 align:start position:0%
classifications of railroads the only uh
 
02:27:12.630 --> 02:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
recipient in the last few years the last
 
02:27:14.510 --> 02:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
few rounds has been the Cog Railway in
 
02:27:15.750 --> 02:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
the past it has been Plymouth and
 
02:27:18.230 --> 02:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
Lincoln Railroad and others but um I
 
02:27:20.150 --> 02:27:20.160 align:start position:0%
would have to to check on the other 160
 
02:27:21.590 --> 02:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
,000 you talk about it could be from a
 
02:27:23.230 --> 02:27:23.240 align:start position:0%
different Source it's not ringing a bell
 
02:27:24.630 --> 02:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
it's usually a much higher amount
 
02:27:24.640 --> 02:27:25.469 align:start position:0%
it's usually a much higher amount
through

02:27:25.469 --> 02:27:25.479 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:27:30.110 --> 02:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
us thank you thank you thank you any
 
02:27:33.670 --> 02:27:33.680 align:start position:0%
other further questions for Miss
 
02:27:37.830 --> 02:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
Winters M represented of rockmore thank
 
02:27:40.030 --> 02:27:40.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman so these loans from the
 
02:27:42.830 --> 02:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
revolving railroad funds are they below
 
02:27:47.030 --> 02:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
market rate or market rate I'm not aware
 
02:27:49.070 --> 02:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
of the treasury um we send them the
 
02:27:50.550 --> 02:27:50.560 align:start position:0%
information they look at what the
 
02:27:52.269 --> 02:27:52.279 align:start position:0%
balance is in this revolving Loan
 
02:27:54.510 --> 02:27:54.520 align:start position:0%
account and then they work just like
 
02:27:57.349 --> 02:27:57.359 align:start position:0%
they do through all the other um bonded
 
02:27:59.510 --> 02:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
it is lower rate that we offer than they
 
02:28:01.309 --> 02:28:01.319 align:start position:0%
can get privately that's why it was
 
02:28:02.790 --> 02:28:02.800 align:start position:0%
