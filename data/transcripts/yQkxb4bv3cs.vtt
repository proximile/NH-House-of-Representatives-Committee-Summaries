00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone welcome to Ways
 
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 align:start position:0%
and Means today we'll be looking at
 
00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 align:start position:0%
agency presentations and we'll start
 
00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Justice is Warren
 
00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Warren cormack
 
00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 align:start position:0%
I'm an attorney at the Department of
 
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
Justice I manage the tobacco Master
 
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 align:start position:0%
settlement agreement
 
00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 align:start position:0%
and I ensure diligent enforcement of RSA
 
00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 align:start position:0%
541 C and 541d the statutes that govern
 
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh diligent enforcement of the
 
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 align:start position:0%
Ambassador settlement agreement
 
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 align:start position:0%
I submitted a memorandum on February 2nd
 
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 align:start position:0%
2023 detailing the estimated payments
 
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
for 2023 through 2025
 
00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 align:start position:0%
from the master settlement agreement
 
00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
and in that memorandum I outlined some
 
00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 align:start position:0%
factors that change the payments
 
00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 align:start position:0%
payments are very difficult to predict
 
00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 align:start position:0%
and any estimate is likely to be wrong
 
00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 align:start position:0%
past actual payments have varied widely
 
00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 align:start position:0%
from estimated payments
 
00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 align:start position:0%
that said the current estimated payment
 
00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 align:start position:0%
for 2023 is around 42 million dollars
 
00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
some of the factors that go towards MSA
 
00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 align:start position:0%
payments include the volume of
 
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 align:start position:0%
cigarettes sold across the United States
 
00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 align:start position:0%
inflation whether a tobacco company
 
00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:23.159 align:start position:0%
decides to dispute a portion of the
 
00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:24.050 align:start position:0%
decides to dispute a portion of the
payment

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 align:start position:0%
payment
 
00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:26.159 align:start position:0%
whether a state has diligently enforced
 
00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 align:start position:0%
the tobacco statutes and other factors
 
00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:32.159 align:start position:0%
go towards the some that we eventually
 
00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:33.649 align:start position:0%
go towards the some that we eventually
perceive

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:33.659 align:start position:0%
perceive
 
00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
and many of those factors vary up until
 
00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
the point of distribution
 
00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to answer any questions
 
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.570 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to answer any questions
about

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 align:start position:0%
the tobacco Master settlement agreement
 
00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 align:start position:0%
estimated payments or anything like that
 
00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 align:start position:0%
thank you that was concise of course the
 
00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 align:start position:0%
big question is well how much do they
 
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 align:start position:0%
fluctuate uh what What's the variance
 
00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 align:start position:0%
last year the variance from the
 
00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 align:start position:0%
originally estimated amount was around
 
00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:02.159 align:start position:0%
10 million dollars and in past years
 
00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
it's not unheard of for
 
00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
it to be around five million dollars
 
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions yes
 
00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 align:start position:0%
representative Ames
 
00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:15.289 align:start position:0%
good morning
um

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 align:start position:0%
do you was there anything special that
 
00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 align:start position:0%
happened last time around that boosted
 
00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:23.759 align:start position:0%
the revenues is 48 a particularly High
 
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
number I don't have the you know over a
 
00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
series of years yes 48 is a very high
 
00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 align:start position:0%
number and there are a couple factors
 
00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 align:start position:0%
that go towards that the first
 
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
the first is uh inflation
 
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
um inflation was very high in 2021 it
 
00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 align:start position:0%
was higher than we have ever seen it uh
 
00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
before in the course of receiving
 
00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:50.759 align:start position:0%
payments which started in 1999 that was
 
00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 align:start position:0%
when we first started tracking inflation
 
00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
it uh I recall correctly it didn't raise
 
00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 align:start position:0%
above four or five percent uh up until
 
00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 align:start position:0%
this past year
 
00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 align:start position:0%
and so that's a big factor uh we also
 
00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
there were fewer disputes to the payment
 
00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 align:start position:0%
than we
 
00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 align:start position:0%
uh conservatively estimated there might
 
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
be so that was another factor that went
 
00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 align:start position:0%
towards a payment that was higher than
 
00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.950 align:start position:0%
towards a payment that was higher than
anticipated

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
anticipated
 
00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 align:start position:0%
representative ulrey has a question
 
00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh a comment first we
 
00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
hear better if that microphone is closer
 
00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:30.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
uh this we have speakers from each one
 
00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
of us I see
 
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.830 align:start position:0%
of us I see
um

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 align:start position:0%
when you talk about 48 million that's a
 
00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.380 align:start position:0%
dollar value do you have access to or
 
00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
information about the number of cartons
 
00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 align:start position:0%
sold because that's that would give a
 
00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
better fact uh figure to us regarding uh
 
00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 align:start position:0%
an increase or decrease in uh
 
00:05:58.969 --> 00:05:58.979 align:start position:0%
individual sales uh the amount of
 
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
Revenue that is received we can then
 
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
adjust by taxation purposes but if we
 
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
know whether this is a a decreasing line
 
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
or an increasing line regarding the
 
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:12.600 align:start position:0%
number of packages or cartons in this
 
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780 align:start position:0%
case sold would
 
00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:20.660 align:start position:0%
I think give us a a sense as to
 
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:24.600 align:start position:0%
what uh revenues may or may not be uh
 
00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:28.139 align:start position:0%
expected uh there are a couple ways that
 
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:29.580 align:start position:0%
I should answer that question the first
 
00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
is that tobacco sales generally Decline
 
00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
and one of the factors that I failed to
 
00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:39.780 align:start position:0%
mention into the previous question is
 
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:43.020 align:start position:0%
that 19 really affected cigarette sales
 
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:45.300 align:start position:0%
they skyrocketed and so that contributed
 
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:47.580 align:start position:0%
to the higher payment and now that
 
00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:50.100 align:start position:0%
things are evening out it could be that
 
00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:53.639 align:start position:0%
we continue to see declines and that is
 
00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:56.220 align:start position:0%
what the future payments account for
 
00:06:59.270 --> 00:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
with respect to how cigarette sales
 
00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:03.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
the short answer is They Don't Really uh
 
00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:08.580 align:start position:0%
they they do in the sense that the MSA
 
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:11.220 align:start position:0%
payment tracks
 
00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
on the first instance a base amount that
 
00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:17.220 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire receives that is then
 
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
increased by the volume of cigarettes
 
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:21.660 align:start position:0%
but then the subsequent modifications to
 
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
that number
 
00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:25.919 align:start position:0%
can cause it to vary widely to the point
 
00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:27.050 align:start position:0%
can cause it to vary widely to the point
that

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:27.060 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:30.300 align:start position:0%
the eventual payment doesn't track
 
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
actual sticks sold to a degree that
 
00:07:36.409 --> 00:07:36.419 align:start position:0%
would be uh particularly useful which is
 
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
why one of the reasons why I report in
 
00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:41.759 align:start position:0%
the potential estimated amount
 
00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:44.340 align:start position:0%
the way that the MSA payment works is
 
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
not like uh the way that the department
 
00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:49.979 align:start position:0%
Revenue collects tobacco taxes the MSA
 
00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:51.780 align:start position:0%
payment is based in a contract between
 
00:07:54.529 --> 00:07:54.539 align:start position:0%
the states and the tobacco companies and
 
00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:56.340 align:start position:0%
the tobacco companies can for example
 
00:07:58.249 --> 00:07:58.259 align:start position:0%
dispute a portion of their payment under
 
00:08:01.309 --> 00:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
that contract and there's not a lot that
 
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
the states can do to
 
00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:05.460 align:start position:0%
get that money if it's disputed and sent
 
00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:06.900 align:start position:0%
into a separate account and not sent to
 
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
the states
 
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
I'll follow up
 
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
yeah that yes that is a contract but
 
00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:15.900 align:start position:0%
that contract is based in large part on
 
00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:17.689 align:start position:0%
that contract is based in large part on
um

00:08:17.689 --> 00:08:17.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:21.660 align:start position:0%
well the MSA is not but the the the uh
 
00:08:23.809 --> 00:08:23.819 align:start position:0%
volume of sales by a particular
 
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:25.800 align:start position:0%
manufacturer who's a
 
00:08:28.909 --> 00:08:28.919 align:start position:0%
has an input and that is the basis for
 
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
them to dispute sections based upon
 
00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:33.300 align:start position:0%
their volume of sales and whether or not
 
00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:34.919 align:start position:0%
they're actually selling this much or
 
00:08:36.469 --> 00:08:36.479 align:start position:0%
that much and therefore they owe this
 
00:08:37.969 --> 00:08:37.979 align:start position:0%
much of that much
 
00:08:41.329 --> 00:08:41.339 align:start position:0%
am I not correct on that
 
00:08:44.449 --> 00:08:44.459 align:start position:0%
uh you you are correct in the first
 
00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:46.140 align:start position:0%
instance that the base payment is first
 
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
adjusted for volume
 
00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:51.300 align:start position:0%
then it's adjusted for uh profit so
 
00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:52.500 align:start position:0%
there's an adjustment that's based in
 
00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:55.500 align:start position:0%
profit there are adjustments on which
 
00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:57.420 align:start position:0%
companies need to pay how much
 
00:08:58.910 --> 00:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
proportionally based on which ones were
 
00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:00.300 align:start position:0%
original signatories to the agreement
 
00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:02.100 align:start position:0%
which ones were subsequent signatories
 
00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:05.700 align:start position:0%
to the agreement there's also a very
 
00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
significant inflation adjustment that
 
00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
on the lowest amount increases it by
 
00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
three percent every year last year it
 
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
was over seven percent so
 
00:09:19.009 --> 00:09:19.019 align:start position:0%
and then their subsequent adjustments
 
00:09:19.019 --> 00:09:20.150 align:start position:0%
and then their subsequent adjustments
for

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:22.980 align:start position:0%
different categories of States uh and
 
00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
then a significant adjustment for
 
00:09:28.009 --> 00:09:28.019 align:start position:0%
the npm adjustment which is called the
 
00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:29.100 align:start position:0%
npm because it stands for
 
00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:31.260 align:start position:0%
non-participating manufacturers so these
 
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
are tobacco companies that actually are
 
00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:36.660 align:start position:0%
not on the MSA that
 
00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:40.740 align:start position:0%
sell cigarettes in the state and uh
 
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I do is enforce
 
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
the tobacco statutes and when we enforce
 
00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
the tobacco statutes for those
 
00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:49.500 align:start position:0%
npms which levels the playing field
 
00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:50.630 align:start position:0%
npms which levels the playing field
across

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
across
 
00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:52.860 align:start position:0%
the tobacco companies that are obligated
 
00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:54.660 align:start position:0%
to pay to the states
 
00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:56.700 align:start position:0%
it makes the other tobacco companies
 
00:09:57.889 --> 00:09:57.899 align:start position:0%
that are not signatories to the
 
00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:00.300 align:start position:0%
agreement pay into an escrow fund to
 
00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:02.820 align:start position:0%
level out the amount that they're taking
 
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
out of
 
00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:07.620 align:start position:0%
what they sell and so if we diligently
 
00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:09.720 align:start position:0%
enforce those statutes then
 
00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:12.420 align:start position:0%
we receive a certain amount as a result
 
00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:15.240 align:start position:0%
of that but that could also reduce and
 
00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:17.580 align:start position:0%
then it also doesn't there's also the
 
00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:19.620 align:start position:0%
factor of bankruptcy so it is there are
 
00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:20.820 align:start position:0%
a lot of factors that go into the
 
00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:23.640 align:start position:0%
equation that aren't volume granted
 
00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:25.620 align:start position:0%
volume is a major factor in the amount
 
00:10:28.009 --> 00:10:28.019 align:start position:0%
that we receive
 
00:10:28.019 --> 00:10:30.889 align:start position:0%
that we receive
uh

00:10:30.889 --> 00:10:30.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:30.899 --> 00:10:34.250 align:start position:0%
 
it's

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:35.519 align:start position:0%
I guess what I'm trying to say is that
 
00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:37.740 align:start position:0%
there's a reason as to why this is
 
00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:39.420 align:start position:0%
reported as a dollar figure as opposed
 
00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:40.310 align:start position:0%
reported as a dollar figure as opposed
to

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
a stick figure
 
00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:43.980 align:start position:0%
representative Army and then we'll work
 
00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
our way around the room and then we'll
 
00:10:49.009 --> 00:10:49.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:53.389 --> 00:10:53.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:57.949 --> 00:10:57.959 align:start position:0%
five years where there was a log Jam of
 
00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:01.260 align:start position:0%
disputes on between the tobacco
 
00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:04.620 align:start position:0%
companies and the states about whether
 
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
the states were doing proper enforcement
 
00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
or not can you tell whether that's been
 
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
resolved enough that we're not going to
 
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
see that affecting things anymore
 
00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
uh I would love to be able to say that
 
00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:21.180 align:start position:0%
we are not going to see that affect
 
00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
things but the reality of the how the
 
00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:26.279 align:start position:0%
payments work is that in any year
 
00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
tobacco companies have the ability to
 
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
dispute the payment that we might
 
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
receive and so
 
00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:35.640 align:start position:0%
it's very hard to account for that in
 
00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:37.380 align:start position:0%
any sort of payment estimate
 
00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:39.420 align:start position:0%
because it could happen at the moment of
 
00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:41.100 align:start position:0%
just distribution and we suddenly
 
00:11:42.829 --> 00:11:42.839 align:start position:0%
realize that there's a large portion
 
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
that's disputed and Those portions can
 
00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.030 align:start position:0%
that's disputed and Those portions can
be

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
several hundreds of Millions for the
 
00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:51.720 align:start position:0%
total States receiving which can
 
00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:54.300 align:start position:0%
translate to a significant portion for
 
00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:11:58.670 --> 00:11:58.680 align:start position:0%
as far as the past
 
00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:04.980 align:start position:0%
I don't have an answer for you right now
 
00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:07.260 align:start position:0%
as to how much I believe you're talking
 
00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
about a portion of payments that were
 
00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
withheld from roughly like 2005 to
 
00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:15.470 align:start position:0%
withheld from roughly like 2005 to
2011-ish

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
I don't have an answer for you as to how
 
00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
much of that the states have received or
 
00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
not but
 
00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:25.260 align:start position:0%
you're correct in so far as any time a
 
00:12:27.009 --> 00:12:27.019 align:start position:0%
portion of the payment is disputed
 
00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:29.700 align:start position:0%
oftentimes it gets sent into a separate
 
00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
a disputed payments account and then it
 
00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:33.540 align:start position:0%
could potentially be paid out to the
 
00:12:35.269 --> 00:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
state so
 
00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:37.140 align:start position:0%
that's another factor that makes it
 
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
difficult to predict because we could
 
00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:40.200 align:start position:0%
have an upward
 
00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:42.540 align:start position:0%
adjustment as a result of that quick
 
00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:43.790 align:start position:0%
adjustment as a result of that quick
follow-up

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:12:47.389 --> 00:12:47.399 align:start position:0%
thank you so you can't tell whether they
 
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
dumped a lot of money on us last year
 
00:12:53.629 --> 00:12:53.639 align:start position:0%
from one of those holding accounts last
 
00:12:53.639 --> 00:12:55.310 align:start position:0%
from one of those holding accounts last
year

00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:57.060 align:start position:0%
basically there were there were two
 
00:12:59.329 --> 00:12:59.339 align:start position:0%
major factors the first is inflation
 
00:13:00.949 --> 00:13:00.959 align:start position:0%
which was
 
00:13:00.959 --> 00:13:01.910 align:start position:0%
which was
um

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:04.860 align:start position:0%
higher than we've ever seen before uh as
 
00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:06.420 align:start position:0%
it relates to the MSA payment it was
 
00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
over seven percent
 
00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:11.820 align:start position:0%
uh and then the other Factor was covid
 
00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:15.240 align:start position:0%
which caused profits to increase it
 
00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:19.260 align:start position:0%
caused a a lot of uh cigarettes to be
 
00:13:22.009 --> 00:13:22.019 align:start position:0%
sold and it caused more expensive
 
00:13:23.569 --> 00:13:23.579 align:start position:0%
cigarettes to be sold like more premium
 
00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
Brands which tend to be party to the MSA
 
00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
as opposed to more discount Brands which
 
00:13:32.629 --> 00:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
tend not to be speaking generally
 
00:13:34.009 --> 00:13:34.019 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
those two factors combined with the fact
 
00:13:38.509 --> 00:13:38.519 align:start position:0%
that the companies didn't dispute as
 
00:13:39.769 --> 00:13:39.779 align:start position:0%
much as they
 
00:13:41.389 --> 00:13:41.399 align:start position:0%
might have
 
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
led to a much higher payment than usual
 
00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:47.220 align:start position:0%
representative Platt has a question
 
00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question you
 
00:13:52.069 --> 00:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
mentioned that the forecast you give
 
00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:55.500 align:start position:0%
could be two million to five million off
 
00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
either way or is there a bias
 
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
it could be more than that off I don't I
 
00:14:04.069 --> 00:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
don't want to give the impression that I
 
00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:06.060 align:start position:0%
um I'm limiting the degree to which this
 
00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:07.980 align:start position:0%
could be off if every Tobacco Company
 
00:14:13.129 --> 00:14:13.139 align:start position:0%
went bankrupt today uh then you know it
 
00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
could just go away for the next you know
 
00:14:17.629 --> 00:14:17.639 align:start position:0%
so it's it's a really difficult thing to
 
00:14:17.639 --> 00:14:18.769 align:start position:0%
so it's it's a really difficult thing to
predict

00:14:18.769 --> 00:14:18.779 align:start position:0%
predict
 
00:14:18.779 --> 00:14:19.430 align:start position:0%
predict
um

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:22.980 align:start position:0%
that said uh I'm I might have
 
00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
interrupted you I want to make sure that
 
00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:26.700 align:start position:0%
I'm directly answering your question the
 
00:14:29.329 --> 00:14:29.339 align:start position:0%
question was is that two to five or
 
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
whatever the number is was the Fair
 
00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:34.380 align:start position:0%
statement is that biased up or but down
 
00:14:37.269 --> 00:14:37.279 align:start position:0%
or is it either side are your estimates
 
00:14:39.769 --> 00:14:39.779 align:start position:0%
come out in the middle or is there a
 
00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:42.300 align:start position:0%
bias uh high or bias low that's our math
 
00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:44.810 align:start position:0%
bias uh high or bias low that's our math
here

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:44.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:46.860 align:start position:0%
the estimates
 
00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:49.740 align:start position:0%
we try to be somewhat conservative that
 
00:14:51.949 --> 00:14:51.959 align:start position:0%
said again there are a lot of factors
 
00:14:54.769 --> 00:14:54.779 align:start position:0%
that go into this and
 
00:14:54.779 --> 00:14:55.970 align:start position:0%
that go into this and
um

00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:55.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:58.490 --> 00:14:58.500 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't count on the estimated
 
00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:01.860 align:start position:0%
payments being under uh particularly in
 
00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:04.980 align:start position:0%
light of possible disputes
 
00:15:06.889 --> 00:15:06.899 align:start position:0%
inflation possibly going down I mean
 
00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
whether it's going to be higher or lower
 
00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:14.940 align:start position:0%
than the actual payment
 
00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:23.269 --> 00:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:24.889 --> 00:15:24.899 align:start position:0%
I should know the answer to this but
 
00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
does the MSA agreement run out at some
 
00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
point in time is there an end date to
 
00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:33.540 align:start position:0%
this thing if my understanding of the
 
00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:36.180 align:start position:0%
MSA is if they the signatories to the
 
00:15:38.269 --> 00:15:38.279 align:start position:0%
agreement are selling cigarettes we're
 
00:15:40.009 --> 00:15:40.019 align:start position:0%
receiving money from the sale of those
 
00:15:40.019 --> 00:15:42.410 align:start position:0%
receiving money from the sale of those
cigarettes

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:44.220 align:start position:0%
so okay we're gonna put you on the spot
 
00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:46.380 align:start position:0%
here what if you could give a percentage
 
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
to your percentage of certainty with the
 
00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:51.060 align:start position:0%
numbers you gave us is it 80 is it more
 
00:15:53.629 --> 00:15:53.639 align:start position:0%
it just so we have a rough idea oh it
 
00:15:56.629 --> 00:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
the numbers are wrong uh but I would say
 
00:15:58.430 --> 00:15:58.440 align:start position:0%
zero percent
 
00:15:58.440 --> 00:15:59.230 align:start position:0%
zero percent
um

00:15:59.230 --> 00:15:59.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:03.949 --> 00:16:03.959 align:start position:0%
yeah as far as the general trend
 
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
the general trend has generally been
 
00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
downwards but that was completely
 
00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:09.839 align:start position:0%
reversed in covet 19.
 
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
um all right so we're going to throw a
 
00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:13.500 align:start position:0%
dart and do the best we can we
 
00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:15.180 align:start position:0%
appreciate you thank you so much thank
 
00:16:18.889 --> 00:16:18.899 align:start position:0%
you okay we will now invite up well go
 
00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
ahead I'm sorry we have a question I'm
 
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
sorry could you stay for one more
 
00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.829 align:start position:0%
sorry could you stay for one more
question

00:16:23.829 --> 00:16:23.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:26.269 --> 00:16:26.279 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question so
 
00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:30.360 align:start position:0%
the numbers are wrong are they high or
 
00:16:32.509 --> 00:16:32.519 align:start position:0%
low wrong
 
00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:35.940 align:start position:0%
take a wild guess so I I tried I tried
 
00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:37.380 align:start position:0%
to answer that question
 
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
um as it related to whether the
 
00:16:41.689 --> 00:16:41.699 align:start position:0%
estimates were conservative or not
 
00:16:41.699 --> 00:16:42.710 align:start position:0%
estimates were conservative or not
um

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:47.100 align:start position:0%
the it is very difficult to predict uh
 
00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
and the estimates don't account as I
 
00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:51.240 align:start position:0%
said for bankruptcy they don't account
 
00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
for possible Menthol bans which have
 
00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:54.060 align:start position:0%
been going into in some jurisdictions
 
00:16:56.509 --> 00:16:56.519 align:start position:0%
which actually can affect uh New
 
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because MSA payments are
 
00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:01.980 align:start position:0%
sent to the entirety of the U.S and then
 
00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:03.300 align:start position:0%
distributed based on allocation
 
00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:05.220 align:start position:0%
percentages to the states so what
 
00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:06.360 align:start position:0%
happens in a different state actually
 
00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:09.839 align:start position:0%
does affect us to some degree so uh it's
 
00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
very difficult to predict okay follow-up
 
00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
question please follow up so could you
 
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh please provide us with a chart of
 
00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:19.799 align:start position:0%
some kind bar chart any kind of graph so
 
00:17:21.289 --> 00:17:21.299 align:start position:0%
we can just see what the numbers look
 
00:17:21.299 --> 00:17:21.970 align:start position:0%
we can just see what the numbers look
like

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:21.980 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
pictorially would you do that for us
 
00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.929 align:start position:0%
pictorially would you do that for us
please

00:17:26.929 --> 00:17:26.939 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
I I can do that
 
00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.409 align:start position:0%
I I can do that
um

00:17:30.409 --> 00:17:30.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
uh the National Association for
 
00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:34.260 align:start position:0%
Attorneys General publishes a chart like
 
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
that it's worth keeping in mind that New
 
00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:39.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a signatory to more than
 
00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
just the MSA we're also a signatory to
 
00:17:44.049 --> 00:17:44.059 align:start position:0%
What's called the npm ASA which is the
 
00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:47.340 align:start position:0%
non-participating manufacturer
 
00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:49.130 align:start position:0%
non-participating manufacturer
oh

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:49.140 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:51.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for the reminder
 
00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:53.220 align:start position:0%
so New Hampshire is a signatory to the
 
00:17:57.409 --> 00:17:57.419 align:start position:0%
MSA but also subsequent agreements that
 
00:17:59.870 --> 00:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
increase the amount we're paid in
 
00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
addition to the MSA payment so a lot of
 
00:18:04.669 --> 00:18:04.679 align:start position:0%
the charts that are are published on
 
00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:08.580 align:start position:0%
this don't necessarily address the other
 
00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:10.260 align:start position:0%
agreements that were
 
00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:13.320 align:start position:0%
party to like for example the npma essay
 
00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
okay so is that something you can break
 
00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:19.380 align:start position:0%
out for New Hampshire or not I I could
 
00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
look at
 
00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:22.260 align:start position:0%
past Trends I don't have that
 
00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
information immediately on hand
 
00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:26.460 align:start position:0%
okay very good thank you madam chair
 
00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
thank you those are good questions and
 
00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:29.220 align:start position:0%
and we'll see if you could work with
 
00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:31.380 align:start position:0%
maybe Chris Shea on uh getting a little
 
00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:33.720 align:start position:0%
bit more information on this so we just
 
00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
so just for clarification when you ask
 
00:18:45.409 --> 00:18:45.419 align:start position:0%
for a chart are you just asking for
 
00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:47.100 align:start position:0%
what's been provided over let's say the
 
00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:49.020 align:start position:0%
last 10 years or 15 years yeah I was
 
00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:50.700 align:start position:0%
thinking like five to ten years before
 
00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:53.100 align:start position:0%
covid so we could see where it was going
 
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
and then the impact to covet because it
 
00:18:58.010 --> 00:18:58.020 align:start position:0%
doesn't surprise me to hear that it's
 
00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
spiked I mean I think alcohol sales were
 
00:19:02.029 --> 00:19:02.039 align:start position:0%
up too
 
00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:04.260 align:start position:0%
so so we can do that but that is also
 
00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:05.820 align:start position:0%
contained in the Akbar you have a
 
00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:08.220 align:start position:0%
10-year picture of the revenue that we
 
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
received through tobacco settlement but
 
00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:11.940 align:start position:0%
I can pull that together because it's in
 
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
the general fund in the education trust
 
00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
fund so
 
00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
um the other thing just to keep in mind
 
00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:19.740 align:start position:0%
too is that with the settlement funds
 
00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
the first 40 million dollars that comes
 
00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:23.580 align:start position:0%
to the state goes directly into the
 
00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:26.220 align:start position:0%
education trust fund any amount over 40
 
00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:28.799 align:start position:0%
million would go into the general fund
 
00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
so it's already been restricted to the
 
00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:42.529 --> 00:19:42.539 align:start position:0%
what was the last time that we went
 
00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:46.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:49.020 align:start position:0%
yeah well it was above 40 last year but
 
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
we've spent above 40 for the last few
 
00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.430 align:start position:0%
we've spent above 40 for the last few
years

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
for covet and before that
 
00:19:59.570 --> 00:19:59.580 align:start position:0%
so it's um
 
00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
it's been above 40 all the way back to
 
00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:03.710 align:start position:0%
it's been above 40 all the way back to
2013.

00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:03.720 align:start position:0%
2013.
 
00:20:06.169 --> 00:20:06.179 align:start position:0%
oh I was remembering it may not be a lot
 
00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
above 40. so in 2016 it was a million
 
00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.350 align:start position:0%
above 40. so in 2016 it was a million
four

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
four
 
00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:11.220 align:start position:0%
but that went to the general fund so
 
00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:16.260 align:start position:0%
we've got 41 million 400. back in 2013
 
00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
we got 63 million but I think uh Mr
 
00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:20.940 align:start position:0%
McCormick McCormick explained that
 
00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:23.220 align:start position:0%
there's been some changes
 
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
um you know there's just different
 
00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:27.260 align:start position:0%
factors that go into this and up through
 
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
2011-12 there was some significant
 
00:20:31.789 --> 00:20:31.799 align:start position:0%
changes that were reconciled or
 
00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:35.160 align:start position:0%
rectified that do impact the payments
 
00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:36.669 align:start position:0%
rectified that do impact the payments
okay

00:20:36.669 --> 00:20:36.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
so I'm glad you're seeing how hard our
 
00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:41.220 align:start position:0%
job is now because we have to put this
 
00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
all together any other questions yes uh
 
00:20:47.029 --> 00:20:47.039 align:start position:0%
representative thank you so would it be
 
00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:49.860 align:start position:0%
fair to say that based on the past there
 
00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:52.500 align:start position:0%
really is not likely to be a lot that's
 
00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:54.780 align:start position:0%
going to go into the general fund
 
00:20:56.930 --> 00:20:56.940 align:start position:0%
uh that's correct yeah yeah I mean I
 
00:20:58.610 --> 00:20:58.620 align:start position:0%
think for our purposes that's kind of
 
00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
the key that no there's not going to be
 
00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:02.940 align:start position:0%
a lot probably going into the general
 
00:21:05.029 --> 00:21:05.039 align:start position:0%
fund if there is great but probably not
 
00:21:06.529 --> 00:21:06.539 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
the and I think just to add to I mean
 
00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
this group in the past has relied on the
 
00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:14.220 align:start position:0%
conservative estimates
 
00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:16.980 align:start position:0%
um of the doj when they come in to give
 
00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:18.360 align:start position:0%
you kind of the base number and you've
 
00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:20.940 align:start position:0%
you've often just accepted that knowing
 
00:21:22.549 --> 00:21:22.559 align:start position:0%
that there's a lot of factors that
 
00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
influence what's going to come out in
 
00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:25.860 align:start position:0%
the wash at the end
 
00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:28.380 align:start position:0%
um and the numbers have been showing a
 
00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
decline in the presentations over the
 
00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:32.940 align:start position:0%
last couple of budget Cycles again I
 
00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:35.700 align:start position:0%
think as Warren suggested that they're
 
00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:37.860 align:start position:0%
considering the sales
 
00:21:39.649 --> 00:21:39.659 align:start position:0%
um the you know the sale of tobacco or
 
00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:41.460 align:start position:0%
cigarettes and and then other influences
 
00:21:44.029 --> 00:21:44.039 align:start position:0%
on that if you see the trend down until
 
00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
covet and then it popped up but I think
 
00:21:47.149 --> 00:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
we're going to see it Trend down again
 
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
and I think when dra comes up you'll
 
00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
hear a little bit about that in terms of
 
00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:58.730 --> 00:21:58.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:02.820 align:start position:0%
okay so uh we have on our agenda the dra
 
00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:05.220 align:start position:0%
at 10 30 but because this isn't an
 
00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
actual public hearing on a bill and
 
00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:08.940 align:start position:0%
they're here would you want to start
 
00:22:36.409 --> 00:22:36.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
ready when you are welcome all right

Administration with me Keene Wong tax
 
00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:18.900 align:start position:0%
policy Council you've probably seen
 
00:23:21.529 --> 00:23:21.539 align:start position:0%
Keane quite a bit so far this session
 
00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:22.980 align:start position:0%
um what we're going to do today is kind
 
00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
of a follow-up presentation to the Joint
 
00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:26.700 align:start position:0%
economic briefing that we did a few
 
00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
weeks ago
 
00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
some things in this presentation will
 
00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:31.380 align:start position:0%
seem a little bit repetitive but I
 
00:23:33.049 --> 00:23:33.059 align:start position:0%
assume many of you are kind of feeling
 
00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:34.860 align:start position:0%
like you're drinking from a fire hose at
 
00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:35.820 align:start position:0%
the moment with the amount of
 
00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
information that we're you're receiving
 
00:23:39.289 --> 00:23:39.299 align:start position:0%
so we're going to go through everything
 
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
one more time my goal to with this
 
00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
presentation is it to serve as a
 
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:46.260 align:start position:0%
reference for you
 
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
um as we go through the taxes and as we
 
00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:49.500 align:start position:0%
go through the revenue estimating
 
00:23:51.649 --> 00:23:51.659 align:start position:0%
process most of the information that
 
00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:53.100 align:start position:0%
you'll need will be contained within
 
00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
this presentation so
 
00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
um if anybody needs some light bedtime
 
00:23:59.810 --> 00:23:59.820 align:start position:0%
reading you may refer to it from time to
 
00:24:03.409 --> 00:24:03.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:05.460 align:start position:0%
um I will note the date on the front
 
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
page is the date of our original
 
00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
presentation I decided to save paper and
 
00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:11.100 align:start position:0%
ink and I left that date but feel free
 
00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:12.780 align:start position:0%
to cross it out and update it with
 
00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:16.140 align:start position:0%
February 7th of 2023.
 
00:24:18.409 --> 00:24:18.419 align:start position:0%

the proper amount of taxes due incurring
 
00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:29.340 align:start position:0%
the least cost to taxpayers in amer in a
 
00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
manner that merits the highest degree of
 
00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
public confidence in our integrity
 
00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:34.740 align:start position:0%
further we provide prompt and
 
00:24:36.409 --> 00:24:36.419 align:start position:0%

on slide three taxpayer interaction it's
 
00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:46.860 align:start position:0%
a policy of the dra to administer the
 
00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
tax laws of the state in a manner that
 
00:24:51.289 --> 00:24:51.299 align:start position:0%
demonstrates efficiency fairness and
 
00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
courtesy to every taxpayer
 
00:24:57.649 --> 00:24:57.659 align:start position:0%
slide four just a general overview of
 
00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
the organizational structure of the dra
 
00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:03.480 align:start position:0%
we have four divisions the audit
 
00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:05.460 align:start position:0%
division which does exactly that they
 
00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
audit taxpayers Returns the collections
 
00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:10.860 align:start position:0%
division they collect past due amounts
 
00:25:13.549 --> 00:25:13.559 align:start position:0%
for the Department the municipal and
 
00:25:16.789 --> 00:25:16.799 align:start position:0%
property division sets the tax rates for
 
00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:18.600 align:start position:0%

00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
provides support to the municipal units
 
00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:22.799 align:start position:0%
of government and assist with the
 
00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
appraisal of real estate and then all
 
00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:26.460 align:start position:0%
the way on the right the taxpayer
 
00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:28.620 align:start position:0%
services division this is our division
 
00:25:30.649 --> 00:25:30.659 align:start position:0%
that processes the payments that we
 
00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:32.820 align:start position:0%
receive the tax returns that we receive
 
00:25:35.029 --> 00:25:35.039 align:start position:0%
they are the ones that answer the phones
 
00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
in our call center and they perform kind
 
00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
of routine account maintenance so
 
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
they're kind of a One-Stop shop for
 
00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:43.620 align:start position:0%
taxpayers so long as you are not under
 
00:25:45.409 --> 00:25:45.419 align:start position:0%
audit and we are not trying to collect
 
00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:47.400 align:start position:0%
from you most of your interactions will
 
00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:49.400 align:start position:0%
be with our taxpayer services division
 
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:51.600 align:start position:0%

I'm going to turn it over to Keen
 
00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:07.620 align:start position:0%
through to walk through the next few
 
00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:13.500 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:26:18.769 --> 00:26:18.779 align:start position:0%
okay so the uh this on the slide five uh
 
00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:21.900 align:start position:0%
some brief information on the tax policy
 
00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
and legislative analysis group and this
 
00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
is one of the uh the groups that's in
 
00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:28.380 align:start position:0%
the in the business uh administrative
 
00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
unit that was mentioned in the previous
 
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.010 align:start position:0%
unit that was mentioned in the previous
slide

00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:31.020 align:start position:0%
slide
 
00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
within this group there are the three of
 
00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:35.340 align:start position:0%
us that's me uh tax policy Council and
 
00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:37.140 align:start position:0%
there's uh Lauren Sullivan she's the
 
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:39.240 align:start position:0%
senior financial analyst and that's
 
00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
Wendy metivier she's a financial analyst
 
00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
and you probably have seen emails from
 
00:26:46.909 --> 00:26:46.919 align:start position:0%
Wendy on a monthly basis with the
 
00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
reports that that we we generate
 
00:26:54.049 --> 00:26:54.059 align:start position:0%
um and the function of this group is
 
00:26:54.059 --> 00:26:55.190 align:start position:0%
um and the function of this group is
essentially

00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
00:26:58.010 --> 00:26:58.020 align:start position:0%
um to assist in the in legislative work
 
00:27:00.649 --> 00:27:00.659 align:start position:0%
with the committee and with legislators
 
00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
so we prepare fiscal note worksheets and
 
00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:04.799 align:start position:0%
quick guides for legislation so that
 
00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
that's about right now when um lsrs or
 
00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:11.820 align:start position:0%
bills are introduced in uh fiscal notes
 
00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:14.820 align:start position:0%
requests are made so we had a team that
 
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
work on the fiscal worksheets and we
 
00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:19.140 align:start position:0%
prepare the quick guides as you as you
 
00:27:21.049 --> 00:27:21.059 align:start position:0%
have seen during the committee hearings
 
00:27:23.149 --> 00:27:23.159 align:start position:0%
I pass out the quick guides to uh to
 
00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:25.740 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
00:27:27.769 --> 00:27:27.779 align:start position:0%
um and then we also would work with
 
00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:29.700 align:start position:0%
legislators in analyzing the tax policy
 
00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:32.220 align:start position:0%
and fiscal impact uh so to understand
 
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
the uh the fiscal worksheet that we
 
00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
prepared and to talk talk to that
 
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
um and also we would attend hearings
 
00:27:42.529 --> 00:27:42.539 align:start position:0%
um during for the House and Senate
 
00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
committee and um the House and Senate
 
00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:46.260 align:start position:0%
committee deliberation on the
 
00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:47.269 align:start position:0%
committee deliberation on the
legislation

00:27:47.269 --> 00:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:49.020 align:start position:0%
and also at the same time we'll be
 
00:27:51.049 --> 00:27:51.059 align:start position:0%
testifying before the House and Senate
 
00:27:54.169 --> 00:27:54.179 align:start position:0%
committees on the uh on the tax policy
 
00:27:56.930 --> 00:27:56.940 align:start position:0%
and fiscal impact uh uh and then on the
 
00:27:58.850 --> 00:27:58.860 align:start position:0%
back end we also track legislations make
 
00:28:01.669 --> 00:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
sure that we know what's going on and we
 
00:28:03.769 --> 00:28:03.779 align:start position:0%
would also assist in Department rule
 
00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:07.140 align:start position:0%
changes and form changes as uh generated
 
00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
moving on to the next slide this is a a
 
00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:17.580 align:start position:0%
great overview on the uh the Texas
 
00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:20.220 align:start position:0%
administered by the dra so in fiscal
 
00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:22.980 align:start position:0%
year 22 we administer about 2.9 billion
 
00:28:25.789 --> 00:28:25.799 align:start position:0%
dollars in revenue of the uh of all the
 
00:28:28.789 --> 00:28:28.799 align:start position:0%
taxes and on the left hand column you
 
00:28:31.669 --> 00:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
see the tax type it's not in any means
 
00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
uh organized by um alphabetical order so
 
00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
um but it's the the two top headers for
 
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
business for tax tax revenue would be
 
00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:44.100 align:start position:0%
the business Enterprise tax and business
 
00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
profits tax
 
00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
um and those two combine uh the the
 
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
business taxes for the state
 
00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
um followed by then there's the CST the
 
00:28:56.810 --> 00:28:56.820 align:start position:0%
IND and so on so forth so this is a list
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
of text types that that this
 
00:29:00.649 --> 00:29:00.659 align:start position:0%
administered by the dra and on the
 
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
center column that's the uh the tax
 
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
rates the current tax rates and then on
 
00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:07.500 align:start position:0%
the right hand column uh that's where if
 
00:29:09.529 --> 00:29:09.539 align:start position:0%
you want to look at um do more research
 
00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
on those text types the statutes are
 
00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:14.940 align:start position:0%
listed on the on the third Column Way on
 
00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:22.730 align:start position:0%
 
yep

00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:22.740 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead and put your hand up sorry
 
00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:26.100 align:start position:0%
I missed that go ahead and represent
 
00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:27.409 align:start position:0%
I missed that go ahead and represent
fellows

00:29:27.409 --> 00:29:27.419 align:start position:0%
fellows
 
00:29:27.419 --> 00:29:28.070 align:start position:0%
fellows
um

00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:30.049 --> 00:29:30.059 align:start position:0%
so when you the middle column where it
 
00:29:31.789 --> 00:29:31.799 align:start position:0%
says current tasks rate you're talking
 
00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:39.049 --> 00:29:39.059 align:start position:0%
uh yes so that current tax rate is the
 
00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:41.100 align:start position:0%
the current rate that's right now so
 
00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:43.860 align:start position:0%
it's for uh tax year
 
00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
um tax year 2022 I'll tax you 23.
 
00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
in in oh yeah follow-up and are there's
 
00:29:56.210 --> 00:29:56.220 align:start position:0%
there I know there are some scheduled to
 
00:29:59.570 --> 00:29:59.580 align:start position:0%
be changed for next biennium yeah so I
 
00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:01.500 align:start position:0%
know the business
 
00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:04.140 align:start position:0%
I know which uh business profits I know
 
00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
for sure is changing but can you no none
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
of them are actually changing unless we
 
00:30:11.269 --> 00:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
pass legislation to do so this year
 
00:30:14.149 --> 00:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
right so every all these rates are baked
 
00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:16.260 align:start position:0%
baked in for tax year
 
00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:18.250 align:start position:0%
baked in for tax year
2023

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:18.260 align:start position:0%
2023
 
00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead did you have something to
 
00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:23.100 align:start position:0%
say representative Army did you want to
 
00:30:32.409 --> 00:30:32.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:37.620 align:start position:0%
oh yes but but not in tax year 2023.
 
00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:38.940 align:start position:0%
you understand the difference between
 
00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:41.820 align:start position:0%
tax year and fiscal year
 
00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:43.860 align:start position:0%
I do okay
 
00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
because we can go over that more if
 
00:30:48.289 --> 00:30:48.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
I I thought the business tax what what
 
00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
was passed with the business tax uh
 
00:30:57.409 --> 00:30:57.419 align:start position:0%
business I can't remember profits tax do
 
00:30:58.370 --> 00:30:58.380 align:start position:0%
you want to go ahead and answer that
 
00:31:02.149 --> 00:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
King yes so uh the tax rate is uh is
 
00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:04.860 align:start position:0%
fixed by Statute the business tax is
 
00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:07.860 align:start position:0%
what's going to change is the threshold
 
00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
so on a bi-annual basis that threshold
 
00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:14.460 align:start position:0%
is going to be adjusted based on CPI
 
00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:17.220 align:start position:0%
consumer price index of two years going
 
00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
forward in entries so that's the BPT as
 
00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:23.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:25.860 align:start position:0%
representative fellas I believe the rate
 
00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:28.860 align:start position:0%
change that you're referring to was the
 
00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:33.080 align:start position:0%
BPT rate going from 7.6 percent to 7.5
 
00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
we're showing 7.5 on this chart and that
 
00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:40.020 align:start position:0%
7.5 percent rate is for taxable periods
 
00:31:45.049 --> 00:31:45.059 align:start position:0%
ending on or after 12 31 of 2023.
 
00:31:48.169 --> 00:31:48.179 align:start position:0%
so because we are in 2023 calendar year
 
00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:50.820 align:start position:0%
2023 at the moment we included that
 
00:31:53.149 --> 00:31:53.159 align:start position:0%
seven percent rate so it's it has this
 
00:31:54.529 --> 00:31:54.539 align:start position:0%
chart has already accounted for the rate
 
00:31:56.210 --> 00:31:56.220 align:start position:0%
change that you are thinking of I
 
00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:57.350 align:start position:0%
change that you are thinking of I
believe

00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:31:59.330 --> 00:31:59.340 align:start position:0%
go ahead so I'm just trying to learn
 
00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:02.840 align:start position:0%
here so if that's tax year
 
00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
2023 isn't that Revenue coming in in 20
 
00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:09.380 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year
 
00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:11.090 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year
2020

00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:11.100 align:start position:0%
2020
 
00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:12.230 align:start position:0%
2020
four

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
four
 
00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:14.580 align:start position:0%
so we will start receiving estimated
 
00:32:19.669 --> 00:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
payments for tax year ending 1231 23
 
00:32:22.789 --> 00:32:22.799 align:start position:0%
starting in April which would be fiscal
 
00:32:25.669 --> 00:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
year 23. we'll receive another set of
 
00:32:27.889 --> 00:32:27.899 align:start position:0%
estimate payments in June which will be
 
00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23 but returns won't be
 
00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:34.500 align:start position:0%
filed until fiscal 24. we have a nice
 
00:32:36.289 --> 00:32:36.299 align:start position:0%
chart that we can maybe share with you
 
00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
about how the tax years kind of straddle
 
00:32:41.389 --> 00:32:41.399 align:start position:0%
the fiscal years because it it can be
 
00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:43.020 align:start position:0%
confusing and so we try to be very clear
 
00:32:45.169 --> 00:32:45.179 align:start position:0%
when we're talking tax year versus
 
00:32:46.789 --> 00:32:46.799 align:start position:0%
fiscal year because they're not
 
00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:55.250 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:32:55.250 --> 00:32:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:56.810 --> 00:32:56.820 align:start position:0%
yes there is a chart coming up
 
00:32:59.810 --> 00:32:59.820 align:start position:0%
representative that would be uh exactly
 
00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:11.220 align:start position:0%
and this is a breakup of the uh the
 
00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:14.700 align:start position:0%
revenue uh by text type and you see here
 
00:33:17.509 --> 00:33:17.519 align:start position:0%
that the uh as I mentioned earlier the
 
00:33:20.149 --> 00:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
the big Revenue maker here would be
 
00:33:24.889 --> 00:33:24.899 align:start position:0%
business taxes and you see that's 1.2 uh
 
00:33:24.899 --> 00:33:26.090 align:start position:0%
business taxes and you see that's 1.2 uh
well

00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:26.100 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
1.2 billion of the total 2.9 billion of
 
00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:33.720 align:start position:0%
uh revenue for fiscal year 22. and
 
00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:36.720 align:start position:0%
that's about 40 of the of the total of
 
00:33:40.549 --> 00:33:40.559 align:start position:0%
2.9 billion and um the next sort of
 
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
highest item
 
00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
um that is on on the uh in terms of uh
 
00:33:48.289 --> 00:33:48.299 align:start position:0%
amount would be the Statewide education
 
00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
property tax and that's 13 of the 2.9
 
00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:53.460 align:start position:0%
billion that's 363 and that's a fixed
 
00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
amount by Statute
 
00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:56.630 align:start position:0%
amount by Statute
um

00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:57.830 align:start position:0%
um
right

00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:01.140 align:start position:0%
moving on to the next slide so here is a
 
00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:05.220 align:start position:0%
pie chart a good pictorial uh showing
 
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:09.419 align:start position:0%
the share of the the taxes in terms of
 
00:34:12.349 --> 00:34:12.359 align:start position:0%
the tax type and you see here the once
 
00:34:14.930 --> 00:34:14.940 align:start position:0%
again the the largest amount here is uh
 
00:34:16.669 --> 00:34:16.679 align:start position:0%
business taxes which is made up of the
 
00:34:19.369 --> 00:34:19.379 align:start position:0%
business profits tax which is 27 percent
 
00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
and then combined with the business
 
00:34:23.930 --> 00:34:23.940 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax that's ten percent of all
 
00:34:26.450 --> 00:34:26.460 align:start position:0%
the of all the total taxes now this is
 
00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
the uh of the revenues this is the share
 
00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
of unrestricted revenues my apologies
 
00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:34.970 align:start position:0%
of unrestricted revenues my apologies
foreign

00:34:34.970 --> 00:34:34.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:37.369 --> 00:34:37.379 align:start position:0%
moving on to the next slide so that this
 
00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:40.260 align:start position:0%
is uh going in right into the uh each
 
00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
text type so first the text type that
 
00:34:44.450 --> 00:34:44.460 align:start position:0%
we're talking about right now will be
 
00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
the business profits tax
 
00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:48.780 align:start position:0%
um as mentioned earlier just now um the
 
00:34:53.450 --> 00:34:53.460 align:start position:0%
current rate is 7.5 percent of uh
 
00:34:55.810 --> 00:34:55.820 align:start position:0%
taxable business profits and this is for
 
00:34:59.030 --> 00:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
taxpayers ending on or after December 31
 
00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:04.040 align:start position:0%
23. prior to that was a tax rate of um
 
00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:08.220 align:start position:0%
7.6 percent and that was for tax peers
 
00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
ending on or after December 3122 and
 
00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
before that was 7.7 so that's just the
 
00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:16.380 align:start position:0%
trend of the uh the PPT rates that's
 
00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:18.109 align:start position:0%
trend of the uh the PPT rates that's
going

00:35:18.109 --> 00:35:18.119 align:start position:0%
going
 
00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
um and so the tax is
 
00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:22.980 align:start position:0%
is incurred on every Enterprise
 
00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:25.260 align:start position:0%
organized for gain or profits carrying
 
00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
on a business activity within the state
 
00:35:30.050 --> 00:35:30.060 align:start position:0%
and then the third bullet point here is
 
00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:31.980 align:start position:0%
the threshold which is the gross
 
00:35:33.650 --> 00:35:33.660 align:start position:0%
business income in excess of hundred and
 
00:35:35.569 --> 00:35:35.579 align:start position:0%
three thousand dollars for all
 
00:35:38.089 --> 00:35:38.099 align:start position:0%
activities and this is adjusted uh for
 
00:35:40.849 --> 00:35:40.859 align:start position:0%
for a CPI so every two years and this
 
00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:43.800 align:start position:0%
will taxable peers beginning 1 123 so
 
00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
the next one will be on uh one one uh
 
00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:51.470 align:start position:0%
the next one will be on uh one one uh
25.

00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:53.220 align:start position:0%
um another point that uh that's not on
 
00:35:55.010 --> 00:35:55.020 align:start position:0%
this slide is that uh just to mention
 
00:35:57.290 --> 00:35:57.300 align:start position:0%
that we are conforming to the Internal
 
00:36:00.490 --> 00:36:00.500 align:start position:0%
Revenue code uh as of December 31 2018
 
00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:03.180 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire business profits tax
 
00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:05.940 align:start position:0%
is on a static Conformity so when uh
 
00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
when you hear that oh
 
00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:11.460 align:start position:0%
sorry uh so the New Hampshire business
 
00:36:13.130 --> 00:36:13.140 align:start position:0%
profits taxes on a static Conformity
 
00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:16.500 align:start position:0%
with the IRC uh so when you hear that
 
00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
all the feds are making changes to the
 
00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh to the tax laws that that does not
 
00:36:24.349 --> 00:36:24.359 align:start position:0%
necessarily impact New Hampshire because
 
00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
we are static to the December 31 2018.
 
00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of filing of the BPT
 
00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
the filing deadline is dependent on the
 
00:36:37.730 --> 00:36:37.740 align:start position:0%
entity type so Partnerships returns are
 
00:36:40.849 --> 00:36:40.859 align:start position:0%
due on March 15 whereas the corporate
 
00:36:42.530 --> 00:36:42.540 align:start position:0%
Partnerships and fiduciary returns are
 
00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:46.020 align:start position:0%
due April 15th and there's a seven month
 
00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:48.660 align:start position:0%
extension that's available so if uh if
 
00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
the entities find that they need more
 
00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:52.440 align:start position:0%
time to file their returns they will
 
00:36:55.069 --> 00:36:55.079 align:start position:0%
file an extension uh upon their due date
 
00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
of the return
 
00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
and during any particular tax year the
 
00:37:02.329 --> 00:37:02.339 align:start position:0%
business entity the business
 
00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
organization would be required to pay
 
00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:07.320 align:start position:0%
estimated taxes if they think that their
 
00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
liability exists 200 and the estimated
 
00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
taxes is broken down to four payments
 
00:37:16.490 --> 00:37:16.500 align:start position:0%
um it's the April 15th June 15 September
 
00:37:19.609 --> 00:37:19.619 align:start position:0%
15 and December 15th this is based on a
 
00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:21.720 align:start position:0%
calendar year filer so if it's not a
 
00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:23.640 align:start position:0%
calendar filer you'll look at just the
 
00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:25.740 align:start position:0%
fourth month the sixth month the ninth
 
00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:28.380 align:start position:0%
month and the 12th month of the um of
 
00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:30.440 align:start position:0%
the tax tax year
 
00:37:35.569 --> 00:37:35.579 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire vpt most 91 of our
 
00:37:37.849 --> 00:37:37.859 align:start position:0%
filers are calendar year file is so you
 
00:37:40.069 --> 00:37:40.079 align:start position:0%
see at those times you'll see the spike
 
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:46.200 align:start position:0%
actually I have a quick question on
 
00:37:46.970 --> 00:37:46.980 align:start position:0%
something and then we'll go to
 
00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:49.020 align:start position:0%
representative Almy so uh you mentioned
 
00:37:51.170 --> 00:37:51.180 align:start position:0%
that we are in static conformance with
 
00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
IRC 2018 yes
 
00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
but maybe one exception is well there
 
00:37:58.190 --> 00:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
could be several but on the nol carry
 
00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
forward I believe we're different from
 
00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:03.180 align:start position:0%
that in terms of we have a Max on the
 
00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
terms of number of years and the dollar
 
00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
amount so those are not in conformance
 
00:38:10.609 --> 00:38:10.619 align:start position:0%
at the moment that that is correct okay
 
00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
so we are generally in Conformity to
 
00:38:15.589 --> 00:38:15.599 align:start position:0%
2018 and then with other adjustments
 
00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:18.540 align:start position:0%
specific to New Hampshire yes that's a
 
00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
correct observation great thank you
 
00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:22.550 align:start position:0%
correct observation great thank you
representative

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:26.540 align:start position:0%
thank you hon if I'm a startup business
 
00:38:28.609 --> 00:38:28.619 align:start position:0%
and I
 
00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:34.260 align:start position:0%
on my liabilities is around 400 dollars
 
00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:35.720 align:start position:0%
the year before
 
00:38:38.329 --> 00:38:38.339 align:start position:0%
and I
 
00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:42.660 align:start position:0%
um all of a sudden burst out and I'm
 
00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:45.770 align:start position:0%
um all of a sudden burst out and I'm
by

00:38:45.770 --> 00:38:45.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:47.569 align:start position:0%
 
June

00:38:47.569 --> 00:38:47.579 align:start position:0%
June
 
00:38:52.490 --> 00:38:52.500 align:start position:0%
15 on I've got four times that amount
 
00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
coming in
 
00:38:57.470 --> 00:38:57.480 align:start position:0%
do you go back at the end of the year
 
00:39:00.730 --> 00:39:00.740 align:start position:0%
and say hey you didn't pay the estimates
 
00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:09.660 align:start position:0%
yes I believe we do uh the we will look
 
00:39:10.849 --> 00:39:10.859 align:start position:0%
back to
 
00:39:12.829 --> 00:39:12.839 align:start position:0%
um throughout the year
 
00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:15.240 align:start position:0%
um and then if the taxpayer feels that
 
00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
during at the earlier part of the year
 
00:39:19.370 --> 00:39:19.380 align:start position:0%
that they received a large amount of
 
00:39:21.349 --> 00:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
Revenue as at that time that they would
 
00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
need to make the payment
 
00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
um on increase the estimated payment uh
 
00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:29.220 align:start position:0%
to to us to the dra yes that would
 
00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
impact when
 
00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:33.540 align:start position:0%
um in terms of underpayment penalty
 
00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:37.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
however if the taxpayer pays in
 
00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:42.180 align:start position:0%
estimated payments ninety percent of
 
00:39:44.329 --> 00:39:44.339 align:start position:0%
their tax liability from the prior year
 
00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
they would not be subject to the
 
00:39:48.170 --> 00:39:48.180 align:start position:0%
underpayment Penalty so in your example
 
00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:51.060 align:start position:0%
if they had a 200 liability in the prior
 
00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
year and they made
 
00:39:56.089 --> 00:39:56.099 align:start position:0%
um four fifty dollar payments equaling
 
00:39:57.770 --> 00:39:57.780 align:start position:0%
that two hundred dollars but in the
 
00:39:59.690 --> 00:39:59.700 align:start position:0%
current year suddenly their liability
 
00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:01.800 align:start position:0%
was a thousand dollars they would not
 
00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:03.839 align:start position:0%
receive an underpayment penalty because
 
00:40:05.569 --> 00:40:05.579 align:start position:0%
they had essentially paid their prior
 
00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:07.260 align:start position:0%
year amount
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
if that makes sense
 
00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:18.109 --> 00:40:18.119 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to point out and you can
 
00:40:20.569 --> 00:40:20.579 align:start position:0%
correct me or spell this out a little
 
00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:22.020 align:start position:0%
more than I can
 
00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
that the timelines for filing returns
 
00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
changed as I recall for partnership
 
00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
returns and and corporate returns
 
00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:34.030 align:start position:0%
returns and and corporate returns
um

00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:34.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
so that when somebody like me is trying
 
00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
to go back in time and compare
 
00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:45.060 align:start position:0%
the month of April or March with prior
 
00:40:47.109 --> 00:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
marches in aprils
 
00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:49.740 align:start position:0%
we're comparing apples and oranges
 
00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:52.140 align:start position:0%
because the partnership returns were due
 
00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
here and there that kind of thing you're
 
00:40:57.170 --> 00:40:57.180 align:start position:0%
correct so we changed the New Hampshire
 
00:40:59.810 --> 00:40:59.820 align:start position:0%
changed the return due dates to conform
 
00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
to the federal due dates so that you're
 
00:41:03.829 --> 00:41:03.839 align:start position:0%
filing your New Hampshire return at the
 
00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
same time that you're filing your
 
00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:07.500 align:start position:0%
federal return so you will often hear us
 
00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:09.170 align:start position:0%
federal return so you will often hear us
say

00:41:09.170 --> 00:41:09.180 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:41:11.450 --> 00:41:11.460 align:start position:0%
it's best to really just combine March
 
00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
and April revenues together and do that
 
00:41:15.410 --> 00:41:15.420 align:start position:0%
if you're going to compare to Prior
 
00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:16.390 align:start position:0%
if you're going to compare to Prior
Years

00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
Years
 
00:41:18.829 --> 00:41:18.839 align:start position:0%
also I would just take this opportunity
 
00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
to note the seven month extension that
 
00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
Keane referenced it's a seven month
 
00:41:26.569 --> 00:41:26.579 align:start position:0%
extension to file the return to actually
 
00:41:28.970 --> 00:41:28.980 align:start position:0%
fill out the information and submit it
 
00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:31.500 align:start position:0%
to the department it is not an extension
 
00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:35.400 align:start position:0%
to pay so we you taxpayers should be
 
00:41:37.730 --> 00:41:37.740 align:start position:0%
paying their full amount due in March
 
00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:39.540 align:start position:0%
and April so we should be receiving the
 
00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
revenue in March and April if they're a
 
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
calendar year filer but we give them a
 
00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:44.700 align:start position:0%
seven month extension to fill out the
 
00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
actual return with the information so
 
00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
extension of time to file not extension
 
00:41:54.410 --> 00:41:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:57.530 --> 00:41:57.540 align:start position:0%
right okay
 
00:41:59.870 --> 00:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
um so moving on to the next slide uh the
 
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
slide 10 and this is the slide that will
 
00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:03.710 align:start position:0%
slide 10 and this is the slide that will
show

00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:03.720 align:start position:0%
show
 
00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
um the events of um the the text forms
 
00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
that we're receiving as compared to the
 
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
calendar year and also of course
 
00:42:15.829 --> 00:42:15.839 align:start position:0%
layering it on to a fiscal year on the
 
00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:19.020 align:start position:0%
top part of it uh the first bar the
 
00:42:21.109 --> 00:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
first calendar you see January to
 
00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
December that's a calendar year 2022 and
 
00:42:27.650 --> 00:42:27.660 align:start position:0%
then on the bottom it's a fiscal year 23
 
00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
which is July 22 through June 23. so
 
00:42:33.109 --> 00:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
going back to the calendar year
 
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
pictorial you'll see that in March which
 
00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:40.200 align:start position:0%
is the uh the due date for the
 
00:42:42.050 --> 00:42:42.060 align:start position:0%
partnership returns this is 2021
 
00:42:45.490 --> 00:42:45.500 align:start position:0%
partnership returns filed in March of 22
 
00:42:50.210 --> 00:42:50.220 align:start position:0%
and then you then April would be the uh
 
00:42:52.849 --> 00:42:52.859 align:start position:0%
um the corporate returns and then that's
 
00:42:54.829 --> 00:42:54.839 align:start position:0%
also when you will see the first
 
00:42:58.069 --> 00:42:58.079 align:start position:0%
estimate for 20 calendar year 2022
 
00:42:58.079 --> 00:42:59.510 align:start position:0%
estimate for 20 calendar year 2022
payments

00:42:59.510 --> 00:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
payments
 
00:43:01.609 --> 00:43:01.619 align:start position:0%
so you see April there'll be two events
 
00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:03.960 align:start position:0%
happening which is the filing of returns
 
00:43:06.109 --> 00:43:06.119 align:start position:0%
for corporate followers as well as
 
00:43:08.930 --> 00:43:08.940 align:start position:0%
estimated payments and it may would be
 
00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
the non-profit filers and in June will
 
00:43:14.990 --> 00:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
be the second estimate payments for
 
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.790 align:start position:0%
be the second estimate payments for
2022.

00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
2022.
 
00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
so all that but you see that from
 
00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:21.180 align:start position:0%
January to June 2022 that all that
 
00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
actually falls into fiscal year of 22
 
00:43:26.569 --> 00:43:26.579 align:start position:0%
and then fiscal year 23 starts in July
 
00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
of 22 onwards and you'll see the the
 
00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
first event that happens is the uh the
 
00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:34.020 align:start position:0%
third payment of the estimates in
 
00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
September 22 and then you'll have the um
 
00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
the October Returns on extensions for
 
00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:40.680 align:start position:0%
Partnerships because it's seven month
 
00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
extension from March so the Thousand
 
00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
October and in November uh is the
 
00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:48.660 align:start position:0%
settlement extension for corporate
 
00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:52.200 align:start position:0%
filers so filing in November 22. and
 
00:43:55.370 --> 00:43:55.380 align:start position:0%
then in December uh you the uh
 
00:43:57.530 --> 00:43:57.540 align:start position:0%
the big thing here it would be the the
 
00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:00.300 align:start position:0%
fourth quarter estimate for uh 22
 
00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
estimate payments
 
00:44:03.829 --> 00:44:03.839 align:start position:0%
and so that's layered on to if you've
 
00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
layered that onto the fiscal year 22
 
00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:06.900 align:start position:0%
calendar and you'll see how all that
 
00:44:08.930 --> 00:44:08.940 align:start position:0%
plays into uh in terms of when things
 
00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
are happening that was very helpful I
 
00:44:12.050 --> 00:44:12.060 align:start position:0%
think to see visually like that
 
00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:14.940 align:start position:0%
representative fellows has a question
 
00:44:18.170 --> 00:44:18.180 align:start position:0%
yes in in terms of
 
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
looking at the revenues that come in for
 
00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:24.180 align:start position:0%
this tax
 
00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:27.540 align:start position:0%
can you tell me any kind of split in
 
00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
terms of what kind of calendar years the
 
00:44:33.109 --> 00:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
filers are using are most of them are
 
00:44:35.329 --> 00:44:35.339 align:start position:0%
most of them using a calendar year or
 
00:44:38.089 --> 00:44:38.099 align:start position:0%
something else yes about 91 percent of
 
00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:44.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:54.589 --> 00:44:54.599 align:start position:0%
representative Almy has a question
 
00:44:57.290 --> 00:44:57.300 align:start position:0%
uh yes I was under the impression that
 
00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
the the filers in October
 
00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
air time were
 
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
were sending quite a lot more money than
 
00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
than the ones that had a regular
 
00:45:16.069 --> 00:45:16.079 align:start position:0%
calendar year
 
00:45:18.770 --> 00:45:18.780 align:start position:0%
oh uh using fiscal year filers uh
 
00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
sending in more money than um Calia
 
00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:22.370 align:start position:0%
sending in more money than um Calia
filers

00:45:22.370 --> 00:45:22.380 align:start position:0%
filers
 
00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
as a whole
 
00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:25.849 align:start position:0%
as a whole
um

00:45:25.849 --> 00:45:25.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:25.859 --> 00:45:27.530 align:start position:0%
um
it

00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:27.540 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
potentially we'll have to look into that
 
00:45:32.329 --> 00:45:32.339 align:start position:0%
um but usually if
 
00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:35.160 align:start position:0%
so in terms of trying to uh tolerate
 
00:45:38.690 --> 00:45:38.700 align:start position:0%
tolerate correlate uh Revenue amounts
 
00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:41.400 align:start position:0%
with filers I would say that
 
00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:42.230 align:start position:0%
with filers I would say that
um

00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:46.250 --> 00:45:46.260 align:start position:0%
most of our big Revenue filers are what
 
00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:49.260 align:start position:0%
is h filers and if and so there are
 
00:45:51.589 --> 00:45:51.599 align:start position:0%
corporate returns and if they are on a
 
00:45:53.569 --> 00:45:53.579 align:start position:0%
fiscal year basis then you'll see that
 
00:45:56.210 --> 00:45:56.220 align:start position:0%
the that the payments would
 
00:45:59.930 --> 00:45:59.940 align:start position:0%
blend in with their fiscal year period
 
00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
tax tax period
 
00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
um so yeah oh sorry
 
00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:07.069 align:start position:0%
um so yeah oh sorry
yeah

00:46:07.069 --> 00:46:07.079 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
follow-up I I believe that's what was
 
00:46:13.130 --> 00:46:13.140 align:start position:0%
causing what I thought was a lot more
 
00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
money coming in on the the fiscal year
 
00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:17.390 align:start position:0%
money coming in on the the fiscal year
filers

00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
filers
 
00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:19.309 align:start position:0%
filers
um

00:46:19.309 --> 00:46:19.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
if I could just ask one more while I'm
 
00:46:24.890 --> 00:46:24.900 align:start position:0%
at it sure on I have never seen the
 
00:46:27.349 --> 00:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
return due for non-profits what are they
 
00:46:27.359 --> 00:46:29.109 align:start position:0%
return due for non-profits what are they
returning

00:46:29.109 --> 00:46:29.119 align:start position:0%
returning
 
00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
it would be for any
 
00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
um business income that's unrelated to
 
00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
their non-profit Mission so if they
 
00:46:39.650 --> 00:46:39.660 align:start position:0%
um happen to be a non-profit that owned
 
00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
rental property and they received money
 
00:46:44.329 --> 00:46:44.339 align:start position:0%
related to that rental property and that
 
00:46:45.890 --> 00:46:45.900 align:start position:0%
rental property is unrelated to their
 
00:46:48.530 --> 00:46:48.540 align:start position:0%
charitable Mission then um that they
 
00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:51.780 align:start position:0%
would file a BPT return we don't receive
 
00:46:53.930 --> 00:46:53.940 align:start position:0%
a lot of them but it is technically in
 
00:46:58.550 --> 00:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:00.349 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:47:00.349 --> 00:47:00.359 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:47:00.359 --> 00:47:01.670 align:start position:0%
yeah
Council

00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
Council
 
00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
right so moving on to the next slide is
 
00:47:07.849 --> 00:47:07.859 align:start position:0%
a slide 11. this is a historical
 
00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
business tax returns estimates
 
00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
extensions tax notice payments and
 
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.609 align:start position:0%
extensions tax notice payments and
refunds

00:47:13.609 --> 00:47:13.619 align:start position:0%
refunds
 
00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:16.680 align:start position:0%
um so this chart here shows the movement
 
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
of the revenue and it's a year-over-year
 
00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:21.720 align:start position:0%
change basis so you see the percentage
 
00:47:24.290 --> 00:47:24.300 align:start position:0%
numbers on the bar charts itself those
 
00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:27.060 align:start position:0%
are percentage of changes from one year
 
00:47:31.130 --> 00:47:31.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:34.010 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:47:34.010 --> 00:47:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
um and in fiscal year 22
 
00:47:40.309 --> 00:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
um the total amount of uh Revenue here
 
00:47:44.270 --> 00:47:44.280 align:start position:0%
is a 1.2 billion and then uh for fiscal
 
00:47:47.930 --> 00:47:47.940 align:start position:0%
year 21 is one slightly over 1 billion
 
00:47:50.930 --> 00:47:50.940 align:start position:0%
um the the amount for fiscal year 23
 
00:47:53.329 --> 00:47:53.339 align:start position:0%
that is only through December of 23
 
00:47:53.339 --> 00:47:54.589 align:start position:0%
that is only through December of 23
currently

00:47:54.589 --> 00:47:54.599 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:47:57.050 --> 00:47:57.060 align:start position:0%
so it's only half
 
00:47:59.150 --> 00:47:59.160 align:start position:0%
of it also it's good just a good
 
00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:01.560 align:start position:0%
takeaway from this this chart here you
 
00:48:03.650 --> 00:48:03.660 align:start position:0%
will see that the majority of the
 
00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
payments here are essentially estimate
 
00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:09.470 align:start position:0%
payments here are essentially estimate
payments

00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:18.290 --> 00:48:18.300 align:start position:0%
word thank you
 
00:48:22.069 --> 00:48:22.079 align:start position:0%
this is a little academic exercise if
 
00:48:23.390 --> 00:48:23.400 align:start position:0%
you will
 
00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
could we get
 
00:48:27.109 --> 00:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
a chart
 
00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
or a graphic display of some kind
 
00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:33.720 align:start position:0%
that compares where we are now
 
00:48:36.530 --> 00:48:36.540 align:start position:0%
with other years
 
00:48:38.569 --> 00:48:38.579 align:start position:0%
just gross it doesn't need to be broken
 
00:48:41.270 --> 00:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
down into everything just the gross
 
00:48:44.450 --> 00:48:44.460 align:start position:0%
revenues so that we could compare
 
00:48:46.309 --> 00:48:46.319 align:start position:0%
what percentage
 
00:48:49.309 --> 00:48:49.319 align:start position:0%
that we've received now
 
00:48:51.170 --> 00:48:51.180 align:start position:0%
for example last year which was the
 
00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
banner year
 
00:48:58.250 --> 00:48:58.260 align:start position:0%
are we ahead of behind about right
 
00:49:00.650 --> 00:49:00.660 align:start position:0%
and then if you could go back to 14 it
 
00:49:01.970 --> 00:49:01.980 align:start position:0%
would be that because you just have it
 
00:49:04.970 --> 00:49:04.980 align:start position:0%
around 14 that's on here
 
00:49:07.490 --> 00:49:07.500 align:start position:0%
am I making my
 
00:49:10.750 --> 00:49:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:13.609 --> 00:49:13.619 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking that is wouldn't this chart
 
00:49:18.670 --> 00:49:18.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:20.930 --> 00:49:20.940 align:start position:0%
this chart tells us how much was
 
00:49:25.010 --> 00:49:25.020 align:start position:0%
received but how much was received at
 
00:49:28.849 --> 00:49:28.859 align:start position:0%
this time of year it does not say
 
00:49:28.859 --> 00:49:30.530 align:start position:0%
this time of year it does not say
oh

00:49:30.530 --> 00:49:30.540 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:49:32.569 --> 00:49:32.579 align:start position:0%
can I ask you to hold your question
 
00:49:35.170 --> 00:49:35.180 align:start position:0%
until slide 55
 
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
and then we can
 
00:49:39.290 --> 00:49:39.300 align:start position:0%
because I think we have part of what you
 
00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
need there but I think we need to add to
 
00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:41.930 align:start position:0%
need there but I think we need to add to
it

00:49:41.930 --> 00:49:41.940 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
fair enough okay representative
 
00:49:44.930 --> 00:49:44.940 align:start position:0%
Schamberg has a question
 
00:49:46.730 --> 00:49:46.740 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:52.309 --> 00:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
looking at this chart here fiscal year
 
00:49:56.329 --> 00:49:56.339 align:start position:0%
2023 which we're halfway through and
 
00:49:59.270 --> 00:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
if there was to be a change in what is
 
00:50:01.250 --> 00:50:01.260 align:start position:0%
coming in are there any alarm bells that
 
00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:04.020 align:start position:0%
go off or anything in your organization
 
00:50:06.109 --> 00:50:06.119 align:start position:0%
that says uh oh
 
00:50:06.119 --> 00:50:08.150 align:start position:0%
that says uh oh
we

00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:50:10.970 --> 00:50:10.980 align:start position:0%
have a problem coming up
 
00:50:12.829 --> 00:50:12.839 align:start position:0%
I thank you for that question because
 
00:50:15.829 --> 00:50:15.839 align:start position:0%
you're going to allow me to say one of
 
00:50:18.290 --> 00:50:18.300 align:start position:0%
my favorite little tax Jokes which many
 
00:50:19.790 --> 00:50:19.800 align:start position:0%
of you have heard before but bear with
 
00:50:21.470 --> 00:50:21.480 align:start position:0%
me for a minute so
 
00:50:23.569 --> 00:50:23.579 align:start position:0%
um as Keane mentioned the majority of
 
00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
Revenue that we receive is in the form
 
00:50:28.089 --> 00:50:28.099 align:start position:0%
of estimated payments
 
00:50:30.770 --> 00:50:30.780 align:start position:0%
an estimated payment is a very simple
 
00:50:32.450 --> 00:50:32.460 align:start position:0%
form with the taxpayer's name
 
00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
identification number and a dollar
 
00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:36.470 align:start position:0%
identification number and a dollar
amount

00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
amount
 
00:50:38.809 --> 00:50:38.819 align:start position:0%
um my joke is there's never uh or very
 
00:50:40.730 --> 00:50:40.740 align:start position:0%
rarely are there little love notes that
 
00:50:44.210 --> 00:50:44.220 align:start position:0%
tell me why that estimate payment may be
 
00:50:46.370 --> 00:50:46.380 align:start position:0%
different from prior estimated payments
 
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
for that business or maybe different
 
00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
from prior Year's estimated payments if
 
00:50:52.370 --> 00:50:52.380 align:start position:0%
taxpayers would like to include that I
 
00:50:53.930 --> 00:50:53.940 align:start position:0%
would love it because it would give us
 
00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
better insight to your point so we
 
00:50:58.309 --> 00:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
really just track how the estimated
 
00:51:00.410 --> 00:51:00.420 align:start position:0%
payments have kind of performed to Prior
 
00:51:03.829 --> 00:51:03.839 align:start position:0%
quarters and prior years and we can kind
 
00:51:06.109 --> 00:51:06.119 align:start position:0%
of see if there are Trends happening to
 
00:51:08.329 --> 00:51:08.339 align:start position:0%
date we are not seeing any alarm Bells
 
00:51:11.809 --> 00:51:11.819 align:start position:0%
estimates are still strong in December
 
00:51:15.650 --> 00:51:15.660 align:start position:0%
for business taxes so
 
00:51:17.930 --> 00:51:17.940 align:start position:0%
it's a bit of a challenge where the
 
00:51:19.609 --> 00:51:19.619 align:start position:0%
majority of our revenue is coming in
 
00:51:21.530 --> 00:51:21.540 align:start position:0%
with very little information that
 
00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
information is coming in when that
 
00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:26.460 align:start position:0%
return is filed and that can be you know
 
00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:28.680 align:start position:0%
if our calendar year filer where their
 
00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:31.380 align:start position:0%
year ends at the end of December we may
 
00:51:33.109 --> 00:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
not receive that return till the
 
00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
following November so I've got almost 10
 
00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
to 11 months where I'm waiting for that
 
00:51:40.910 --> 00:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
information to know what's really going
 
00:51:43.849 --> 00:51:43.859 align:start position:0%
on so it is a struggle with the majority
 
00:51:45.349 --> 00:51:45.359 align:start position:0%
of the revenue coming in with with
 
00:51:45.359 --> 00:51:50.630 align:start position:0%
of the revenue coming in with with
estimates

00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:53.530 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:51:53.530 --> 00:51:53.540 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:51:57.530 --> 00:51:57.540 align:start position:0%
moving on to the next slide so being
 
00:51:59.210 --> 00:51:59.220 align:start position:0%
said that the estimates make a large
 
00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
majority of the other Revenue so we did
 
00:52:04.730 --> 00:52:04.740 align:start position:0%
analysis on the estimate itself and
 
00:52:07.490 --> 00:52:07.500 align:start position:0%
breaking that down to the various uh
 
00:52:10.970 --> 00:52:10.980 align:start position:0%
entity types and once again the takeaway
 
00:52:13.010 --> 00:52:13.020 align:start position:0%
here has been the theme of this uh
 
00:52:15.589 --> 00:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
presentation on BPT so far is that the
 
00:52:17.210 --> 00:52:17.220 align:start position:0%
majority of the payments are coming from
 
00:52:23.210 --> 00:52:23.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:26.450 --> 00:52:26.460 align:start position:0%
moving on to the next slide slide 13 and
 
00:52:29.630 --> 00:52:29.640 align:start position:0%
this is a chart that shows try to break
 
00:52:32.450 --> 00:52:32.460 align:start position:0%
up the um to show the the types of
 
00:52:35.690 --> 00:52:35.700 align:start position:0%
filers and the um the amount of the
 
00:52:38.930 --> 00:52:38.940 align:start position:0%
percentage of the BPT that those filers
 
00:52:43.069 --> 00:52:43.079 align:start position:0%
are paying into this is essentially a um
 
00:52:46.309 --> 00:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
an extract that's from our pyramids
 
00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
um reverse pyramid chart that's in our
 
00:52:50.809 --> 00:52:50.819 align:start position:0%
annual report and here you'll see on the
 
00:52:53.210 --> 00:52:53.220 align:start position:0%
left hand side these are the uh entity
 
00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
type filers
 
00:52:57.950 --> 00:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
um the the largest amount of filers here
 
00:53:00.650 --> 00:53:00.660 align:start position:0%
are proprietorships makes up 39.6
 
00:53:04.549 --> 00:53:04.559 align:start position:0%
percent however the percent of the
 
00:53:06.890 --> 00:53:06.900 align:start position:0%
revenue BPT Revenue that's brought in by
 
00:53:08.690 --> 00:53:08.700 align:start position:0%
this proprietorship is only 4.3 percent
 
00:53:10.670 --> 00:53:10.680 align:start position:0%
of the BPT tax
 
00:53:12.530 --> 00:53:12.540 align:start position:0%
and then you move down on the left hand
 
00:53:15.130 --> 00:53:15.140 align:start position:0%
side you see that a Water's Edge filers
 
00:53:17.930 --> 00:53:17.940 align:start position:0%
5.8 percent of filers at Water's Edge
 
00:53:21.829 --> 00:53:21.839 align:start position:0%
but then they make up 57.6 of the BPT
 
00:53:21.839 --> 00:53:28.849 align:start position:0%
but then they make up 57.6 of the BPT
Revenue

00:53:28.849 --> 00:53:28.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:31.609 --> 00:53:31.619 align:start position:0%
and moving on to the next slide slide 14
 
00:53:35.329 --> 00:53:35.339 align:start position:0%
here is the uh the reverse triangle
 
00:53:37.430 --> 00:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
um and this is uh taken straight from
 
00:53:39.470 --> 00:53:39.480 align:start position:0%
our annual report
 
00:53:41.450 --> 00:53:41.460 align:start position:0%
um and you'll see that the the bottom
 
00:53:45.230 --> 00:53:45.240 align:start position:0%
part of the triangle is the uh the
 
00:53:48.309 --> 00:53:48.319 align:start position:0%
larger amount of tax being reported
 
00:53:53.930 --> 00:53:53.940 align:start position:0%
and the count here is 78
 
00:53:56.210 --> 00:53:56.220 align:start position:0%
um 78 followers with the larger than 1
 
00:53:56.220 --> 00:53:57.290 align:start position:0%
um 78 followers with the larger than 1
million

00:53:57.290 --> 00:53:57.300 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
um and you see here the BPT sum is 200
 
00:54:02.690 --> 00:54:02.700 align:start position:0%
200 million dollars
 
00:54:05.150 --> 00:54:05.160 align:start position:0%
um and the population is only 0.1
 
00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:07.430 align:start position:0%
um and the population is only 0.1
percent

00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:09.349 --> 00:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
making more sense of discharge you move
 
00:54:10.970 --> 00:54:10.980 align:start position:0%
down to the second part of the chart you
 
00:54:13.250 --> 00:54:13.260 align:start position:0%
hear you see corporations and Waters
 
00:54:16.970 --> 00:54:16.980 align:start position:0%
Edge the count of filers is about 30 30
 
00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
000 filers and the sum of BPT is about
 
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
400 million dollars and um compared to
 
00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:31.069 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:54:31.069 --> 00:54:31.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
moving on to the next slide slide 15
 
00:54:37.010 --> 00:54:37.020 align:start position:0%
here is a trend analysis A tenure Trend
 
00:54:40.490 --> 00:54:40.500 align:start position:0%
analysis of the BPT Revenue uh the Blue
 
00:54:43.190 --> 00:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
Line being the uh BPT audited revenue
 
00:54:46.849 --> 00:54:46.859 align:start position:0%
and the green dash line is the fiscal
 
00:54:50.030 --> 00:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
year 23 plan revenue and you see there
 
00:54:54.170 --> 00:54:54.180 align:start position:0%
is a slight dip in fiscal year 20 going
 
00:54:57.829 --> 00:54:57.839 align:start position:0%
from fiscal year 19 of 473 million to
 
00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
450 million and that is likely a small
 
00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
covet adjustment there and then but
 
00:55:07.549 --> 00:55:07.559 align:start position:0%
after that as we all not see in the news
 
00:55:09.549 --> 00:55:09.559 align:start position:0%
and see what's happening with revenues
 
00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
businesses and uh just somehow doing
 
00:55:16.490 --> 00:55:16.500 align:start position:0%
really well and right now we are above
 
00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:20.690 align:start position:0%
really well and right now we are above
plan

00:55:20.690 --> 00:55:20.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:26.710 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:55:26.710 --> 00:55:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:29.809 --> 00:55:29.819 align:start position:0%
so that concludes the BPT presentation
 
00:55:33.049 --> 00:55:33.059 align:start position:0%
uh we're going to move on to bet
 
00:55:35.630 --> 00:55:35.640 align:start position:0%
right okay
 
00:55:39.470 --> 00:55:39.480 align:start position:0%
um so business Enterprise tags it's uh
 
00:55:41.329 --> 00:55:41.339 align:start position:0%
it's it's in tandem with the business
 
00:55:44.329 --> 00:55:44.339 align:start position:0%
profits tags so it's um to make up the
 
00:55:46.609 --> 00:55:46.619 align:start position:0%
total business taxes it's Point
 
00:55:49.010 --> 00:55:49.020 align:start position:0%
currently is 0.55 of the Enterprise
 
00:55:51.890 --> 00:55:51.900 align:start position:0%
Value tax base uh and that's for
 
00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
taxpayers ending December 31 22. the
 
00:55:58.910 --> 00:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
Enterprise Value tax base is make is
 
00:56:01.250 --> 00:56:01.260 align:start position:0%
made up of the dividends paid the
 
00:56:03.770 --> 00:56:03.780 align:start position:0%
compensation and wages accrued and paid
 
00:56:07.370 --> 00:56:07.380 align:start position:0%
and the interest paid or recruit
 
00:56:09.829 --> 00:56:09.839 align:start position:0%
um every Prof every profit and
 
00:56:11.870 --> 00:56:11.880 align:start position:0%
non-profit Enterprise or organization
 
00:56:13.849 --> 00:56:13.859 align:start position:0%
with the business activity inside New
 
00:56:16.849 --> 00:56:16.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire other than the 501c3 will be
 
00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:20.220 align:start position:0%
subject to the subject to the bet the
 
00:56:23.750 --> 00:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
threshold for bet is slightly higher and
 
00:56:27.290 --> 00:56:27.300 align:start position:0%
it is a 281 thousand dollars for both
 
00:56:29.329 --> 00:56:29.339 align:start position:0%
Enterprise Value tax base as well as
 
00:56:31.309 --> 00:56:31.319 align:start position:0%
close receipts
 
00:56:33.130 --> 00:56:33.140 align:start position:0%
um and that
 
00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
threshold is for taxpayers beginning 1 1
 
00:56:39.290 --> 00:56:39.300 align:start position:0%
of 23 and it's also going to be adjusted
 
00:56:44.510 --> 00:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
on a bi-annual basis based on uh CPI
 
00:56:47.150 --> 00:56:47.160 align:start position:0%
uh interesting to note is that the BET
 
00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:48.410 align:start position:0%
uh interesting to note is that the BET
taxes

00:56:48.410 --> 00:56:48.420 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
00:56:51.410 --> 00:56:51.420 align:start position:0%
um that is paid will be considered as a
 
00:56:54.770 --> 00:56:54.780 align:start position:0%
credit against BPT so essentially
 
00:56:57.230 --> 00:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
um the whatever bad taxes that tax
 
00:56:59.210 --> 00:56:59.220 align:start position:0%
liability that you have is going to be
 
00:57:02.210 --> 00:57:02.220 align:start position:0%
uh used to reduce the BPT soil overall
 
00:57:04.430 --> 00:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
uh where if you have your BPT higher
 
00:57:07.549 --> 00:57:07.559 align:start position:0%
than your bad overall what that means is
 
00:57:09.829 --> 00:57:09.839 align:start position:0%
that you're just paying essentially the
 
00:57:12.790 --> 00:57:12.800 align:start position:0%
BPT tax because whatever
 
00:57:15.470 --> 00:57:15.480 align:start position:0%
is credited against PPT
 
00:57:17.930 --> 00:57:17.940 align:start position:0%
uh if in the situation where you have
 
00:57:19.730 --> 00:57:19.740 align:start position:0%
excess bet
 
00:57:21.230 --> 00:57:21.240 align:start position:0%
um that will be able to be carried over
 
00:57:23.569 --> 00:57:23.579 align:start position:0%
for 10 years
 
00:57:26.630 --> 00:57:26.640 align:start position:0%
the filing for the BET return is uh
 
00:57:29.450 --> 00:57:29.460 align:start position:0%
similar to the BBT return so
 
00:57:31.730 --> 00:57:31.740 align:start position:0%
Partnerships returns are due March 15th
 
00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:33.960 align:start position:0%
corporate files are April 15 and so on
 
00:57:35.690 --> 00:57:35.700 align:start position:0%
so forth with the same seven month
 
00:57:39.049 --> 00:57:39.059 align:start position:0%
extensions as well as with the um the
 
00:57:41.329 --> 00:57:41.339 align:start position:0%
estimate payments so there's no need for
 
00:57:44.270 --> 00:57:44.280 align:start position:0%
filing uh splitting your filing
 
00:57:46.250 --> 00:57:46.260 align:start position:0%
requirements between bad and BPT so you
 
00:57:51.349 --> 00:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:52.970 --> 00:57:52.980 align:start position:0%
but do you have a slide that goes over
 
00:57:56.450 --> 00:57:56.460 align:start position:0%
what's included in that Enterprise Value
 
00:57:58.609 --> 00:57:58.619 align:start position:0%
you know payroll interest expense yeah
 
00:58:00.890 --> 00:58:00.900 align:start position:0%
right could you explain that so
 
00:58:03.230 --> 00:58:03.240 align:start position:0%
um so the Enterprise Value tax base is
 
00:58:05.390 --> 00:58:05.400 align:start position:0%
made up of the dividends paid uh the
 
00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
comp and wages paid recruit and interest
 
00:58:11.690 --> 00:58:11.700 align:start position:0%
paid or accrued uh you we sort of we see
 
00:58:14.809 --> 00:58:14.819 align:start position:0%
that a majority of the um
 
00:58:17.510 --> 00:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
the bulk of the uh
 
00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
the component that makes up the
 
00:58:22.549 --> 00:58:22.559 align:start position:0%
Enterprise Value tax base is the the
 
00:58:24.710 --> 00:58:24.720 align:start position:0%
Company wages
 
00:58:27.470 --> 00:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
so payroll yes payroll gotcha questions
 
00:58:29.329 --> 00:58:29.339 align:start position:0%
yes representative fellows
 
00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
so you mentioned benefits doesn't
 
00:58:34.370 --> 00:58:34.380 align:start position:0%
doesn't that include like medical
 
00:58:34.380 --> 00:58:36.770 align:start position:0%
doesn't that include like medical
insurance

00:58:36.770 --> 00:58:36.780 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
00:58:40.130 --> 00:58:40.140 align:start position:0%
no can you repeat the question I'm sorry
 
00:58:40.140 --> 00:58:41.210 align:start position:0%
no can you repeat the question I'm sorry
the

00:58:41.210 --> 00:58:41.220 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:58:43.730 --> 00:58:43.740 align:start position:0%
follow-up to the um chairperson's
 
00:58:46.490 --> 00:58:46.500 align:start position:0%
question the business the base for the
 
00:58:49.910 --> 00:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax you mentioned at
 
00:58:52.849 --> 00:58:52.859 align:start position:0%
first that it covered wages and benefits
 
00:58:56.470 --> 00:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
so what about things like employer paid
 
00:59:00.430 --> 00:59:00.440 align:start position:0%
medical insurance isn't that a benefit
 
00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
so the um the the com the component for
 
00:59:08.270 --> 00:59:08.280 align:start position:0%
uh bet is compensation and Wages that's
 
00:59:10.069 --> 00:59:10.079 align:start position:0%
paid or accrued
 
00:59:13.130 --> 00:59:13.140 align:start position:0%
um benefits paid on behalf of employees
 
00:59:20.809 --> 00:59:20.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:22.609 --> 00:59:22.619 align:start position:0%
right not including benefits it's
 
00:59:25.490 --> 00:59:25.500 align:start position:0%
compensation and wages accrued or paid
 
00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
so let's say you accruing a bonus for
 
00:59:28.200 --> 00:59:29.569 align:start position:0%
so let's say you accruing a bonus for
someone

00:59:29.569 --> 00:59:29.579 align:start position:0%
someone
 
00:59:31.730 --> 00:59:31.740 align:start position:0%
maybe I don't know yeah right other
 
00:59:33.650 --> 00:59:33.660 align:start position:0%
questions over here uh representative
 
00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:35.640 align:start position:0%
has a question
 
00:59:38.089 --> 00:59:38.099 align:start position:0%
thank you I hadn't thought about this
 
00:59:38.099 --> 00:59:41.510 align:start position:0%
thank you I hadn't thought about this
before

00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:45.650 --> 00:59:45.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
have we ever looked at how much of our
 
00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
credit carry forward we always worry
 
00:59:52.789 --> 00:59:52.799 align:start position:0%
about is excess bet
 
00:59:56.030 --> 00:59:56.040 align:start position:0%
the that that is a different type of
 
00:59:58.789 --> 00:59:58.799 align:start position:0%
credit carry forward the credit care for
 
01:00:02.329 --> 01:00:02.339 align:start position:0%
I believe that uh you're referring to is
 
01:00:04.730 --> 01:00:04.740 align:start position:0%
this is the CCO limitation of the 500 to
 
01:00:10.010 --> 01:00:10.020 align:start position:0%
50 that is Money Paid in by the company
 
01:00:12.829 --> 01:00:12.839 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers that is kept on account
 
01:00:16.490 --> 01:00:16.500 align:start position:0%
with us right X extra money so-called
 
01:00:18.829 --> 01:00:18.839 align:start position:0%
that instead of refunding it to say okay
 
01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
yeah you guys keep it for a while
 
01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
um and then whereas this uh this credit
 
01:00:28.069 --> 01:00:28.079 align:start position:0%
is a bad credit uh essentially it's the
 
01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
bad taxes that um that is due on the
 
01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:34.440 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise that's compared to
 
01:00:37.490 --> 01:00:37.500 align:start position:0%
the BPT and then if there's you have
 
01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
more bad
 
01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
taxes you just keep on account to be
 
01:00:43.549 --> 01:00:43.559 align:start position:0%
used against the BPT
 
01:00:45.829 --> 01:00:45.839 align:start position:0%
so it's a totally different company it's
 
01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
different yeah
 
01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
very simply it would the BET credit that
 
01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
is available to be used against BBT if
 
01:00:55.250 --> 01:00:55.260 align:start position:0%
it's if it's not used against BBT it's
 
01:00:56.930 --> 01:00:56.940 align:start position:0%
not going to be refunded
 
01:00:59.450 --> 01:00:59.460 align:start position:0%
because it was an actual liability that
 
01:01:01.730 --> 01:01:01.740 align:start position:0%
was paid under the bet so it's counted
 
01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:03.960 align:start position:0%
separately than the CCO that Keane
 
01:01:05.210 --> 01:01:05.220 align:start position:0%
mentioned where we were tracking
 
01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
payments at a business received for
 
01:01:08.930 --> 01:01:08.940 align:start position:0%
which they didn't have a liability but
 
01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
so there's no refunding of the excess
 
01:01:16.549 --> 01:01:16.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:18.829 --> 01:01:18.839 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead
 
01:01:18.839 --> 01:01:19.549 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead
um

01:01:19.549 --> 01:01:19.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:21.720 align:start position:0%
just to understand the distinction
 
01:01:24.730 --> 01:01:24.740 align:start position:0%
between non-profit and
 
01:01:30.289 --> 01:01:30.299 align:start position:0%
501c3 are things like some hospitals are
 
01:01:33.710 --> 01:01:33.720 align:start position:0%
I know they're non-profit what what is
 
01:01:37.069 --> 01:01:37.079 align:start position:0%
happening with the bet for those in in
 
01:01:41.630 --> 01:01:41.640 align:start position:0%
some private schools so a 501c3 is a an
 
01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:42.849 align:start position:0%
some private schools so a 501c3 is a an
IRS

01:01:42.849 --> 01:01:42.859 align:start position:0%
IRS
 
01:01:46.549 --> 01:01:46.559 align:start position:0%
designation you the the non-profit
 
01:01:48.770 --> 01:01:48.780 align:start position:0%
organization has to apply for a 501c3
 
01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:50.150 align:start position:0%
organization has to apply for a 501c3
classification

01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
classification
 
01:01:51.650 --> 01:01:51.660 align:start position:0%
uh just because you call yourself a
 
01:01:53.569 --> 01:01:53.579 align:start position:0%
non-profit doesn't mean you're you're a
 
01:01:53.579 --> 01:01:55.370 align:start position:0%
non-profit doesn't mean you're you're a
501c3

01:01:55.370 --> 01:01:55.380 align:start position:0%
501c3
 
01:01:58.609 --> 01:01:58.619 align:start position:0%
um therefore if you're just a non-profit
 
01:02:01.010 --> 01:02:01.020 align:start position:0%
without the 501c3 you'll be still be
 
01:02:04.549 --> 01:02:04.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:04.559 --> 01:02:05.589 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:02:05.589 --> 01:02:05.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:09.890 --> 01:02:09.900 align:start position:0%
that's not addressing my question so you
 
01:02:12.289 --> 01:02:12.299 align:start position:0%
have to tell me a little more about what
 
01:02:15.770 --> 01:02:15.780 align:start position:0%
makes a 501
 
01:02:19.309 --> 01:02:19.319 align:start position:0%
so an organization that's tell me about
 
01:02:21.829 --> 01:02:21.839 align:start position:0%
hospitals and private schools hospitals
 
01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
and private schools are traditionally
 
01:02:25.970 --> 01:02:25.980 align:start position:0%
501c3 organizations the majority of
 
01:02:28.910 --> 01:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
non-profit organizations are 501c3
 
01:02:31.010 --> 01:02:31.020 align:start position:0%
organizations to Keane's point though
 
01:02:33.829 --> 01:02:33.839 align:start position:0%
there is a long list of IRS designations
 
01:02:38.450 --> 01:02:38.460 align:start position:0%
that are not 501c3s there's 501c1 C2 C8
 
01:02:41.930 --> 01:02:41.940 align:start position:0%
C9 C4s Etc the majority though of what
 
01:02:44.089 --> 01:02:44.099 align:start position:0%
you would think of as a non-profit is
 
01:02:46.849 --> 01:02:46.859 align:start position:0%
likely a 501c3 and would not be subject
 
01:02:50.329 --> 01:02:50.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:52.430 --> 01:02:52.440 align:start position:0%
so just to make sure that what I'm
 
01:02:54.289 --> 01:02:54.299 align:start position:0%
thinking in my head I'm not trying to be
 
01:02:56.510 --> 01:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
political or anything thinking in my
 
01:02:58.010 --> 01:02:58.020 align:start position:0%
head is correct
 
01:03:01.130 --> 01:03:01.140 align:start position:0%
so when hospitals in private schools
 
01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
have for example you know whoever's at
 
01:03:06.170 --> 01:03:06.180 align:start position:0%
the top of the organizational chart are
 
01:03:10.370 --> 01:03:10.380 align:start position:0%
receiving salaries of like 350
 
01:03:14.510 --> 01:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
000 a year or more that the bet is not
 
01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:21.049 --> 01:03:21.059 align:start position:0%
representative ulrey has a question uh
 
01:03:22.910 --> 01:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
not really a question just amplify on
 
01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:23.750 align:start position:0%
not really a question just amplify on
that

01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:25.370 align:start position:0%
that
um

01:03:25.370 --> 01:03:25.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:27.190 --> 01:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
there are I think
 
01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:28.809 align:start position:0%
there are I think
5254

01:03:28.809 --> 01:03:28.819 align:start position:0%
5254
 
01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
501cs on the IRS code
 
01:03:36.589 --> 01:03:36.599 align:start position:0%
uh for example uh the Masons our 501c10
 
01:03:39.530 --> 01:03:39.540 align:start position:0%
the Knights of Columbus are 501 C8 uh
 
01:03:40.870 --> 01:03:40.880 align:start position:0%
some schools are
 
01:03:43.370 --> 01:03:43.380 align:start position:0%
501c4s I believe
 
01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:44.150 align:start position:0%
501c4s I believe
um

01:03:44.150 --> 01:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:46.069 --> 01:03:46.079 align:start position:0%
which is different
 
01:03:48.109 --> 01:03:48.119 align:start position:0%
and it depends on what you do with your
 
01:03:50.510 --> 01:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
money and how you do it whether or not
 
01:03:52.069 --> 01:03:52.079 align:start position:0%
you show a profit
 
01:03:54.890 --> 01:03:54.900 align:start position:0%
as to whether or not it becomes then
 
01:03:57.710 --> 01:03:57.720 align:start position:0%
subject to the BET and these guys get to
 
01:04:03.609 --> 01:04:03.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
representative fellows so my take of
 
01:04:10.130 --> 01:04:10.140 align:start position:0%
what I think I'm hearing is that they
 
01:04:12.289 --> 01:04:12.299 align:start position:0%
don't get to be judge and jury because
 
01:04:15.950 --> 01:04:15.960 align:start position:0%
the IRS has already made that they're
 
01:04:17.930 --> 01:04:17.940 align:start position:0%
the ones making that decision
 
01:04:20.569 --> 01:04:20.579 align:start position:0%
just point of information we also have a
 
01:04:22.250 --> 01:04:22.260 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire entity the charitable
 
01:04:23.870 --> 01:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
trust division of the Department of
 
01:04:25.990 --> 01:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
Justice that is also monitoring
 
01:04:28.069 --> 01:04:28.079 align:start position:0%
non-profits to make sure that they're
 
01:04:29.510 --> 01:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
staying in compliance just so you know
 
01:04:30.650 --> 01:04:30.660 align:start position:0%
we have a state arm as well
 
01:04:32.809 --> 01:04:32.819 align:start position:0%
representative ulrey has a question and
 
01:04:34.430 --> 01:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
within the charitable trust anyone who
 
01:04:37.069 --> 01:04:37.079 align:start position:0%
says that they are is whether they are
 
01:04:38.890 --> 01:04:38.900 align:start position:0%
or not
 
01:04:42.230 --> 01:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
is that opinion or fact I don't know any
 
01:04:43.849 --> 01:04:43.859 align:start position:0%
questions on this side of the room
 
01:04:47.630 --> 01:04:47.640 align:start position:0%
okay back to you okay
 
01:04:51.349 --> 01:04:51.359 align:start position:0%
and uh so moving on to slide 17 uh this
 
01:04:54.410 --> 01:04:54.420 align:start position:0%
is another breakdown of the um showing
 
01:04:57.950 --> 01:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
the the filers on the left hand side by
 
01:05:00.829 --> 01:05:00.839 align:start position:0%
entity type and then the percentage of
 
01:05:03.589 --> 01:05:03.599 align:start position:0%
bad taxes on the right hand side and
 
01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
once again the theme is still the same
 
01:05:08.510 --> 01:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
you'll see that the water's edge files
 
01:05:11.690 --> 01:05:11.700 align:start position:0%
is 5.8 percent whereas they bring in
 
01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:20.990 --> 01:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh the the next slide is uh the similar
 
01:05:22.609 --> 01:05:22.619 align:start position:0%
slides to the BPT however this is just
 
01:05:24.109 --> 01:05:24.119 align:start position:0%
for the bed and this is the triangle the
 
01:05:28.069 --> 01:05:28.079 align:start position:0%
reverse triangle and you see that um for
 
01:05:31.549 --> 01:05:31.559 align:start position:0%
uh you know for some of bad tax bad
 
01:05:35.690 --> 01:05:35.700 align:start position:0%
taxes uh from uh 100 400 000 onwards to
 
01:05:37.670 --> 01:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
a million dollars so that range is about
 
01:05:41.809 --> 01:05:41.819 align:start position:0%
155 million dollars in in bad taxes uh
 
01:05:44.690 --> 01:05:44.700 align:start position:0%
but then the the percentage of uh
 
01:05:48.289 --> 01:05:48.299 align:start position:0%
the filers in that uh in that for that
 
01:05:50.990 --> 01:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
kind of Revenue it's only 3.7 of the um
 
01:05:53.569 --> 01:05:53.579 align:start position:0%
of the the filers that brings in about
 
01:05:56.089 --> 01:05:56.099 align:start position:0%
155 million dollars out of the 216
 
01:06:01.549 --> 01:06:01.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:05.630 --> 01:06:05.640 align:start position:0%
and the um the next graph here is the
 
01:06:08.569 --> 01:06:08.579 align:start position:0%
10-year trend for bad Revenue
 
01:06:10.730 --> 01:06:10.740 align:start position:0%
um and you see here it seems to be a
 
01:06:13.250 --> 01:06:13.260 align:start position:0%
more drastic change on fiscal year 20
 
01:06:15.470 --> 01:06:15.480 align:start position:0%
the dip is more drastic if you remember
 
01:06:19.490 --> 01:06:19.500 align:start position:0%
with the BPT BPT chart that's because uh
 
01:06:21.890 --> 01:06:21.900 align:start position:0%
as we mentioned earlier the uh the bad
 
01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
tax is based out of the dividends pay
 
01:06:28.670 --> 01:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
the compensation paid and and so
 
01:06:30.829 --> 01:06:30.839 align:start position:0%
compensation being a majority part of
 
01:06:33.289 --> 01:06:33.299 align:start position:0%
the element for bet uh you see that
 
01:06:36.049 --> 01:06:36.059 align:start position:0%
covet year fiscal year 20
 
01:06:38.390 --> 01:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
um that's probably the the main reason
 
01:06:40.309 --> 01:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
for that
 
01:06:42.170 --> 01:06:42.180 align:start position:0%
so just to clarify so as people are
 
01:06:44.270 --> 01:06:44.280 align:start position:0%
getting pay raises and paying get paid
 
01:06:46.370 --> 01:06:46.380 align:start position:0%
more money businesses pay more on that
 
01:06:48.410 --> 01:06:48.420 align:start position:0%
the BET tax will probably likely go up
 
01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:53.329 align:start position:0%
the BET tax will probably likely go up
yes

01:06:53.329 --> 01:06:53.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:55.670 --> 01:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
sorry representative mommy thanks before
 
01:06:57.890 --> 01:06:57.900 align:start position:0%
we leave these two is there a way to
 
01:07:01.849 --> 01:07:01.859 align:start position:0%
combine the inverted triangles for
 
01:07:06.170 --> 01:07:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:08.270 --> 01:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
since we always consider the business
 
01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:09.710 align:start position:0%
since we always consider the business
taxes

01:07:09.710 --> 01:07:09.720 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:11.109 align:start position:0%
taxes
together

01:07:11.109 --> 01:07:11.119 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:07:13.849 --> 01:07:13.859 align:start position:0%
when we're doing the work
 
01:07:16.609 --> 01:07:16.619 align:start position:0%
it might be interesting to look at that
 
01:07:19.069 --> 01:07:19.079 align:start position:0%
it's probably I mean it the numbers are
 
01:07:21.049 --> 01:07:21.059 align:start position:0%
extreme enough that
 
01:07:26.930 --> 01:07:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
right going over to slide 20 so this is
 
01:07:33.589 --> 01:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
a combined bet and BBT Revenue Trend
 
01:07:35.930 --> 01:07:35.940 align:start position:0%
analysis for 10 years and you see that
 
01:07:40.010 --> 01:07:40.020 align:start position:0%
the chart is it's similar to the the two
 
01:07:42.770 --> 01:07:42.780 align:start position:0%
charts before the line charts before
 
01:07:44.690 --> 01:07:44.700 align:start position:0%
um and once again you see the dip in
 
01:07:46.609 --> 01:07:46.619 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 20
 
01:07:50.329 --> 01:07:50.339 align:start position:0%
um and uh the dotted line is the
 
01:07:54.890 --> 01:07:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:54.900 --> 01:07:59.210 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:07:59.210 --> 01:07:59.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:59.220 --> 01:08:01.609 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:08:01.609 --> 01:08:01.619 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:08:04.549 --> 01:08:04.559 align:start position:0%
okay the next slide slide 21 uh just to
 
01:08:06.770 --> 01:08:06.780 align:start position:0%
summarize the different business tax
 
01:08:10.250 --> 01:08:10.260 align:start position:0%
changes uh the statute changes that that
 
01:08:12.170 --> 01:08:12.180 align:start position:0%
was implemented on the business profits
 
01:08:14.690 --> 01:08:14.700 align:start position:0%
uh the business taxes in total the first
 
01:08:17.269 --> 01:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
bullet point is the market-based
 
01:08:19.309 --> 01:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
sourcing that's what tax will appears
 
01:08:22.249 --> 01:08:22.259 align:start position:0%
ending on or after December 31 2021.
 
01:08:24.349 --> 01:08:24.359 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing essentially this
 
01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:28.380 align:start position:0%
impacts um business organizations that
 
01:08:30.410 --> 01:08:30.420 align:start position:0%
conduct business activities inside and
 
01:08:32.510 --> 01:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
outside of New Hampshire so market-based
 
01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
Outsourcing is the terms of
 
01:08:37.189 --> 01:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
apportionment of sales other than sales
 
01:08:39.530 --> 01:08:39.540 align:start position:0%
of tangible personal property so a
 
01:08:42.110 --> 01:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
business organization could have
 
01:08:44.570 --> 01:08:44.580 align:start position:0%
two kinds of sales either sales selling
 
01:08:46.010 --> 01:08:46.020 align:start position:0%
tangible personal property like selling
 
01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
widgets and stuff like that and another
 
01:08:50.269 --> 01:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
type of sales is sale selling of uh
 
01:08:51.530 --> 01:08:51.540 align:start position:0%
sales other than tangible personal
 
01:08:51.540 --> 01:08:52.630 align:start position:0%
sales other than tangible personal
property

01:08:52.630 --> 01:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
property
 
01:08:54.829 --> 01:08:54.839 align:start position:0%
historically what New Hampshire was
 
01:08:57.650 --> 01:08:57.660 align:start position:0%
doing is the uh the sourcing was based
 
01:08:59.510 --> 01:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
on cost of performance sourcing so prior
 
01:09:02.470 --> 01:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
to tax year ending December 3122 not 21
 
01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire was using cost of
 
01:09:08.570 --> 01:09:08.580 align:start position:0%
performance sourcing where we see where
 
01:09:12.709 --> 01:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
is the plural plurality of the cost of
 
01:09:14.930 --> 01:09:14.940 align:start position:0%
Performing that that income producing
 
01:09:17.150 --> 01:09:17.160 align:start position:0%
activity and there that would be where
 
01:09:20.030 --> 01:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
it's sourced to now in for tax year
 
01:09:22.910 --> 01:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
December 3121 that has all changed to
 
01:09:24.769 --> 01:09:24.779 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing so we now see
 
01:09:27.709 --> 01:09:27.719 align:start position:0%
where the market is for the sale of the
 
01:09:30.169 --> 01:09:30.179 align:start position:0%
uh not uh other than tangible personal
 
01:09:30.179 --> 01:09:31.910 align:start position:0%
uh not uh other than tangible personal
property

01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
property
 
01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
the next bullet point is the cap on
 
01:09:38.269 --> 01:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
credit carryover so as we were talking
 
01:09:41.150 --> 01:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
earlier there's this uh business
 
01:09:44.450 --> 01:09:44.460 align:start position:0%
organized business organizations pay in
 
01:09:46.729 --> 01:09:46.739 align:start position:0%
their estimates and then the they
 
01:09:48.650 --> 01:09:48.660 align:start position:0%
estimate the amount of taxes that they
 
01:09:50.030 --> 01:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
would owe and then when the father
 
01:09:53.090 --> 01:09:53.100 align:start position:0%
return potentially maybe they might not
 
01:09:55.310 --> 01:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
needed to have paid that much so then
 
01:09:58.070 --> 01:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
there's this credit on account the tax
 
01:10:01.010 --> 01:10:01.020 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers could either request that
 
01:10:03.470 --> 01:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
money back for a refund or say no you
 
01:10:05.169 --> 01:10:05.179 align:start position:0%
just keep it for next year's credit
 
01:10:08.030 --> 01:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
apply to next year's taxes so this is
 
01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
the credit carryover uh item that we
 
01:10:14.030 --> 01:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
were talking about earlier and for
 
01:10:16.610 --> 01:10:16.620 align:start position:0%
textures uh tax periods ending on or
 
01:10:20.510 --> 01:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
after December 31 22 that amount is kept
 
01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
at 500 percent of the total tax
 
01:10:26.870 --> 01:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
liability of the particular taxpayer uh
 
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
so this would sort of encourage and you
 
01:10:31.250 --> 01:10:31.260 align:start position:0%
see the the trend of 500 going down to
 
01:10:34.010 --> 01:10:34.020 align:start position:0%
250 and you're going down to 100 so this
 
01:10:36.830 --> 01:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
is trying to persuade the taxpayers to
 
01:10:38.930 --> 01:10:38.940 align:start position:0%
not keep their
 
01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:39.590 align:start position:0%
not keep their
um

01:10:39.590 --> 01:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:42.169 --> 01:10:42.179 align:start position:0%
money with the state and and then you
 
01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
know and more muscle to have them take
 
01:10:47.390 --> 01:10:47.400 align:start position:0%
that money out and refund because the
 
01:10:49.850 --> 01:10:49.860 align:start position:0%
potential issue is that uh whenever the
 
01:10:52.729 --> 01:10:52.739 align:start position:0%
tax payment uh say okay this year I want
 
01:10:52.739 --> 01:10:53.450 align:start position:0%
tax payment uh say okay this year I want
to

01:10:53.450 --> 01:10:53.460 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:10:56.330 --> 01:10:56.340 align:start position:0%
get a refund and so we may not be
 
01:10:58.610 --> 01:10:58.620 align:start position:0%
prepared for that kind of scenario in
 
01:11:00.530 --> 01:11:00.540 align:start position:0%
terms of a revenue focus a revenue
 
01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
forecasting so this helps us
 
01:11:07.669 --> 01:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
predict better in terms of the the
 
01:11:09.649 --> 01:11:09.659 align:start position:0%
revenue that we would be seeing in the
 
01:11:09.659 --> 01:11:10.850 align:start position:0%
revenue that we would be seeing in the
future

01:11:10.850 --> 01:11:10.860 align:start position:0%
future
 
01:11:12.530 --> 01:11:12.540 align:start position:0%
representative Almy header a question
 
01:11:13.729 --> 01:11:13.739 align:start position:0%
here's her hand up do you still have a
 
01:11:13.739 --> 01:11:15.950 align:start position:0%
here's her hand up do you still have a
question

01:11:15.950 --> 01:11:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:16.550 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:20.330 --> 01:11:20.340 align:start position:0%
I don't know how much we ought to maybe
 
01:11:22.490 --> 01:11:22.500 align:start position:0%
just get into these more thoroughly
 
01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:23.689 align:start position:0%
just get into these more thoroughly
later

01:11:23.689 --> 01:11:23.699 align:start position:0%
later
 
01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:27.960 align:start position:0%
but market-based sourcing happened
 
01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:29.810 align:start position:0%
but market-based sourcing happened
um

01:11:29.810 --> 01:11:29.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:33.770 --> 01:11:33.780 align:start position:0%
two two years ago essentially for us and
 
01:11:36.890 --> 01:11:36.900 align:start position:0%
we've got some kind of idea that
 
01:11:39.470 --> 01:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
of what it may have done to us
 
01:11:43.010 --> 01:11:43.020 align:start position:0%
but also I think people need to
 
01:11:45.250 --> 01:11:45.260 align:start position:0%
understand better what market-based
 
01:11:49.910 --> 01:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
sourcing is it's the repairman
 
01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
who sits in New Hampshire and does a lot
 
01:11:55.630 --> 01:11:55.640 align:start position:0%
of work in Massachusetts
 
01:11:59.570 --> 01:11:59.580 align:start position:0%
but he gets all his equipment together
 
01:12:01.729 --> 01:12:01.739 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire he does his his
 
01:12:04.130 --> 01:12:04.140 align:start position:0%
Contracting into from New Hampshire and
 
01:12:08.510 --> 01:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
Etc and he was paying taxes in New
 
01:12:10.850 --> 01:12:10.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire on that rather than in
 
01:12:13.669 --> 01:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts so now with market-based
 
01:12:16.070 --> 01:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
sourcing most of his clients are in
 
01:12:18.169 --> 01:12:18.179 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and he's paying
 
01:12:20.689 --> 01:12:20.699 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts instead
 
01:12:24.169 --> 01:12:24.179 align:start position:0%
and somebody who sits in Massachusetts
 
01:12:28.790 --> 01:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
like our septic guy does uh and comes up
 
01:12:31.390 --> 01:12:31.400 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire to work
 
01:12:33.890 --> 01:12:33.900 align:start position:0%
he would be paying to New Hampshire
 
01:12:35.689 --> 01:12:35.699 align:start position:0%
whereas before he was paying to
 
01:12:35.699 --> 01:12:38.870 align:start position:0%
whereas before he was paying to
Massachusetts

01:12:38.870 --> 01:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:39.950 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:12:39.950 --> 01:12:39.960 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:12:41.930 --> 01:12:41.940 align:start position:0%
but yeah we've gone over this a couple
 
01:12:43.610 --> 01:12:43.620 align:start position:0%
times but we can keep talking about it
 
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
this is a good time to do it because in
 
01:12:47.630 --> 01:12:47.640 align:start position:0%
very soon order we're going to actually
 
01:12:50.510 --> 01:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
be putting a pencil to paper yeah okay
 
01:12:52.790 --> 01:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
but all of these things like the credit
 
01:12:55.070 --> 01:12:55.080 align:start position:0%
carry forward every one of them has a
 
01:12:57.050 --> 01:12:57.060 align:start position:0%
complicated story behind it and I'm
 
01:12:58.550 --> 01:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
worried about getting through everything
 
01:13:00.530 --> 01:13:00.540 align:start position:0%
yeah before noon well we've talked about
 
01:13:02.390 --> 01:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
that before but we can keep talking
 
01:13:04.130 --> 01:13:04.140 align:start position:0%
about it do you want to cover the carry
 
01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
forward because I know you and
 
01:13:06.709 --> 01:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
representative major worked really hard
 
01:13:08.689 --> 01:13:08.699 align:start position:0%
on that basically forcing people to get
 
01:13:10.370 --> 01:13:10.380 align:start position:0%
returns so we don't have a huge
 
01:13:12.530 --> 01:13:12.540 align:start position:0%
liability on the books right
 
01:13:15.530 --> 01:13:15.540 align:start position:0%
yeah feel free to explain that if
 
01:13:17.450 --> 01:13:17.460 align:start position:0%
now this was basically representative
 
01:13:19.550 --> 01:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
Majors I worried about the single sales
 
01:13:21.470 --> 01:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
Factor he worried about the credit carry
 
01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:22.669 align:start position:0%
Factor he worried about the credit carry
forward

01:13:22.669 --> 01:13:22.679 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:13:22.679 --> 01:13:23.450 align:start position:0%
forward
um

01:13:23.450 --> 01:13:23.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:26.630 --> 01:13:26.640 align:start position:0%
and the credit carry forward on our
 
01:13:29.890 --> 01:13:29.900 align:start position:0%
books is about 300 million at this point
 
01:13:33.350 --> 01:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
it's been growing quite a lot in the
 
01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:34.189 align:start position:0%
it's been growing quite a lot in the
last

01:13:34.189 --> 01:13:34.199 align:start position:0%
last
 
01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
five years ten years on and essentially
 
01:13:42.470 --> 01:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
it's money that we owe to the businesses
 
01:13:46.910 --> 01:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
about half of it on turns over every
 
01:13:50.870 --> 01:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
year as the businesses that kept the
 
01:13:53.209 --> 01:13:53.219 align:start position:0%
money there use it for their estimated
 
01:13:53.219 --> 01:13:55.130 align:start position:0%
money there use it for their estimated
payments

01:13:55.130 --> 01:13:55.140 align:start position:0%
payments
 
01:13:58.550 --> 01:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
and I frankly don't understand how we
 
01:14:01.010 --> 01:14:01.020 align:start position:0%
account for them when we're figuring out
 
01:14:03.590 --> 01:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
how much our estimated payments have
 
01:14:06.709 --> 01:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
gone one way or the other but anyway on
 
01:14:06.719 --> 01:14:08.570 align:start position:0%
gone one way or the other but anyway on
and

01:14:08.570 --> 01:14:08.580 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:14:12.290 --> 01:14:12.300 align:start position:0%
on the other half we don't know what it
 
01:14:14.689 --> 01:14:14.699 align:start position:0%
is which is why I was jumping on the BET
 
01:14:16.610 --> 01:14:16.620 align:start position:0%
before that I thought maybe I finally
 
01:14:18.590 --> 01:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
had an answer but
 
01:14:20.570 --> 01:14:20.580 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
01:14:24.669 --> 01:14:24.679 align:start position:0%
we're worried that it could be
 
01:14:29.270 --> 01:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
that in a major recession or even a
 
01:14:31.310 --> 01:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
semi-recession where people are still
 
01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
coming out of the covet era that a lot
 
01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
of businesses would come back to us at
 
01:14:40.810 --> 01:14:40.820 align:start position:0%
the same time and would say
 
01:14:43.669 --> 01:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
I want my money back
 
01:14:45.830 --> 01:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
and the treasury might have a lot of
 
01:14:47.770 --> 01:14:47.780 align:start position:0%
trouble with that
 
01:14:47.780 --> 01:14:49.430 align:start position:0%
trouble with that
so

01:14:49.430 --> 01:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:14:51.050 --> 01:14:51.060 align:start position:0%
um and we've been worrying about it for
 
01:14:52.430 --> 01:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
a long time and doing nothing about it
 
01:14:54.110 --> 01:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
because it's expensive it could be
 
01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:56.270 align:start position:0%
because it's expensive it could be
expensive

01:14:56.270 --> 01:14:56.280 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:57.110 align:start position:0%
expensive
um

01:14:57.110 --> 01:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:59.750 --> 01:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I've been
 
01:15:02.810 --> 01:15:02.820 align:start position:0%
worrying about lately is
 
01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
we've got this schedule that we put
 
01:15:08.930 --> 01:15:08.940 align:start position:0%
together and it was on purpose that we
 
01:15:11.390 --> 01:15:11.400 align:start position:0%
were going to take just the businesses
 
01:15:14.030 --> 01:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
with the most credit carry forward first
 
01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
and they weren't going to cost us a
 
01:15:17.450 --> 01:15:17.460 align:start position:0%
whole lot
 
01:15:19.610 --> 01:15:19.620 align:start position:0%
so that we could see how this was going
 
01:15:25.070 --> 01:15:25.080 align:start position:0%
to go and then in 25 we would hit the
 
01:15:26.930 --> 01:15:26.940 align:start position:0%
Vise a little bit
 
01:15:30.410 --> 01:15:30.420 align:start position:0%
harder and more of them would have to
 
01:15:32.450 --> 01:15:32.460 align:start position:0%
take back their money
 
01:15:36.530 --> 01:15:36.540 align:start position:0%
and by 27 probably the finance committee
 
01:15:38.270 --> 01:15:38.280 align:start position:0%
would have intervened and said okay
 
01:15:40.250 --> 01:15:40.260 align:start position:0%
let's slow this down a little
 
01:15:42.709 --> 01:15:42.719 align:start position:0%
but but
 
01:15:42.719 --> 01:15:43.550 align:start position:0%
but but
um

01:15:43.550 --> 01:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:47.270 --> 01:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
what could also be happening right now
 
01:15:50.510 --> 01:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
if some businesses are struggling
 
01:15:54.350 --> 01:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
is that they and they're in the 250
 
01:15:56.270 --> 01:15:56.280 align:start position:0%
percent one
 
01:15:58.430 --> 01:15:58.440 align:start position:0%
that they would think oh maybe I'll
 
01:15:59.890 --> 01:15:59.900 align:start position:0%
start right now
 
01:16:02.630 --> 01:16:02.640 align:start position:0%
so that I'll have some more money to
 
01:16:05.149 --> 01:16:05.159 align:start position:0%
operate with the next year or two
 
01:16:06.350 --> 01:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
because I don't know what's going to
 
01:16:08.770 --> 01:16:08.780 align:start position:0%
happen 24.
 
01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
so um that's that's a very helpful
 
01:16:14.030 --> 01:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
background did you have a question
 
01:16:16.070 --> 01:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
representative jinnegan thank you madam
 
01:16:18.110 --> 01:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
chair uh just a clarification
 
01:16:19.850 --> 01:16:19.860 align:start position:0%
um representative almi stated that
 
01:16:21.709 --> 01:16:21.719 align:start position:0%
there's about 300 million I just want is
 
01:16:25.070 --> 01:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
that correct that is roughly correct 300
 
01:16:27.169 --> 01:16:27.179 align:start position:0%
315 320
 
01:16:29.390 --> 01:16:29.400 align:start position:0%
um it's somewhere in there okay
 
01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:30.890 align:start position:0%
um it's somewhere in there okay
so

01:16:30.890 --> 01:16:30.900 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:16:32.689 --> 01:16:32.699 align:start position:0%
talking generally about these
 
01:16:34.490 --> 01:16:34.500 align:start position:0%
legislative changes
 
01:16:36.290 --> 01:16:36.300 align:start position:0%
um we kind of hit on the large ones
 
01:16:38.450 --> 01:16:38.460 align:start position:0%
which is market-based sourcing the cap
 
01:16:40.610 --> 01:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
on the CCO the last one I just wanted to
 
01:16:42.830 --> 01:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
mention that's notable here is the
 
01:16:45.169 --> 01:16:45.179 align:start position:0%
single sales Factor apportionment as
 
01:16:48.290 --> 01:16:48.300 align:start position:0%
representative almi mentioned
 
01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:49.189 align:start position:0%
representative almi mentioned
um

01:16:49.189 --> 01:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:49.199 --> 01:16:50.630 align:start position:0%
um
under

01:16:50.630 --> 01:16:50.640 align:start position:0%
under
 
01:16:52.430 --> 01:16:52.440 align:start position:0%
we used to operate under what's called
 
01:16:54.709 --> 01:16:54.719 align:start position:0%
three-factor apportionment where if you
 
01:16:56.510 --> 01:16:56.520 align:start position:0%
are a business that operates in multiple
 
01:16:58.550 --> 01:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
States and you have your pie of of
 
01:17:00.649 --> 01:17:00.659 align:start position:0%
profit and you need to divide that pie
 
01:17:02.510 --> 01:17:02.520 align:start position:0%
up into the various states that you
 
01:17:05.390 --> 01:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
operate New Hampshire would say tell me
 
01:17:07.130 --> 01:17:07.140 align:start position:0%
what you have for payroll in New
 
01:17:08.510 --> 01:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire tell me what you have for
 
01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
property and tell me what you have for
 
01:17:12.770 --> 01:17:12.780 align:start position:0%
sales and that those are the factors
 
01:17:14.510 --> 01:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
that we would use to determine how much
 
01:17:17.149 --> 01:17:17.159 align:start position:0%
of your pie you should pay taxes on here
 
01:17:18.890 --> 01:17:18.900 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
01:17:20.689 --> 01:17:20.699 align:start position:0%
for taxable periods ending on or after
 
01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
December 31st of 22 now we only care
 
01:17:25.370 --> 01:17:25.380 align:start position:0%
what you have for sales into New
 
01:17:27.709 --> 01:17:27.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we no longer care about how
 
01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
much property or how much payroll
 
01:17:31.250 --> 01:17:31.260 align:start position:0%
obviously payroll is still taxed under
 
01:17:33.830 --> 01:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
bet but you're apportionment how you
 
01:17:36.770 --> 01:17:36.780 align:start position:0%
divide that pie only matters based on
 
01:17:38.570 --> 01:17:38.580 align:start position:0%
how much you have for sales in New
 
01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so that's a change to how
 
01:17:42.709 --> 01:17:42.719 align:start position:0%
you're going to divide your pie for
 
01:17:44.330 --> 01:17:44.340 align:start position:0%
those businesses that operate in
 
01:17:47.209 --> 01:17:47.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:47.219 --> 01:17:48.669 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:17:48.669 --> 01:17:48.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:17:51.470 --> 01:17:51.480 align:start position:0%
representative ulrey has a question
 
01:17:53.810 --> 01:17:53.820 align:start position:0%
yeah just to put that in practical
 
01:17:53.820 --> 01:17:56.510 align:start position:0%
yeah just to put that in practical
application

01:17:56.510 --> 01:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
application
 
01:17:58.610 --> 01:17:58.620 align:start position:0%
I'm a
 
01:18:01.550 --> 01:18:01.560 align:start position:0%
Construction Company
 
01:18:04.149 --> 01:18:04.159 align:start position:0%
located in the Border Town
 
01:18:07.370 --> 01:18:07.380 align:start position:0%
I do most of my work building big tall
 
01:18:10.910 --> 01:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:13.910 --> 01:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
most of my sales are in Boston but my
 
01:18:16.490 --> 01:18:16.500 align:start position:0%
employees all live in New Hampshire
 
01:18:19.550 --> 01:18:19.560 align:start position:0%
just work that out for me right so under
 
01:18:22.370 --> 01:18:22.380 align:start position:0%
three Factor apportionment you would
 
01:18:24.110 --> 01:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
look at what your payroll was to
 
01:18:26.330 --> 01:18:26.340 align:start position:0%
employees you would look at where your
 
01:18:28.370 --> 01:18:28.380 align:start position:0%
property was so if you owned property on
 
01:18:30.290 --> 01:18:30.300 align:start position:0%
a Border Town to house all of your large
 
01:18:32.330 --> 01:18:32.340 align:start position:0%
construction equipment and then we'd
 
01:18:34.390 --> 01:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
look to where your sales were
 
01:18:36.590 --> 01:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
now we're only going to look to where
 
01:18:38.930 --> 01:18:38.940 align:start position:0%
your sales were so it is likely in your
 
01:18:40.850 --> 01:18:40.860 align:start position:0%
scenario that most of your profit would
 
01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
be taxable in Massachusetts and not here
 
01:18:44.630 --> 01:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and so in your example
 
01:18:47.810 --> 01:18:47.820 align:start position:0%
that business would pay less tax in New
 
01:18:52.030 --> 01:18:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:54.229 --> 01:18:54.239 align:start position:0%
representative MS
 
01:18:57.290 --> 01:18:57.300 align:start position:0%
just to take that a step further
 
01:18:59.990 --> 01:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
is different for the BET for that same
 
01:19:03.050 --> 01:19:03.060 align:start position:0%
business which may have a very
 
01:19:07.370 --> 01:19:07.380 align:start position:0%
significant bet component if
 
01:19:10.130 --> 01:19:10.140 align:start position:0%
substantial numbers of employees are
 
01:19:12.530 --> 01:19:12.540 align:start position:0%
located here you're still going to
 
01:19:16.310 --> 01:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
apportion kind of the same way but yes
 
01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:18.410 align:start position:0%
apportion kind of the same way but yes
yes

01:19:18.410 --> 01:19:18.420 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:19:22.070 --> 01:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
it it gets complicated
 
01:19:25.130 --> 01:19:25.140 align:start position:0%
um but yes you're gonna your your bet is
 
01:19:26.990 --> 01:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
still on your payroll here in New
 
01:19:28.610 --> 01:19:28.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but if those employees are
 
01:19:30.770 --> 01:19:30.780 align:start position:0%
working in Massachusetts doesn't matter
 
01:19:32.149 --> 01:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
where you cut the check from it matters
 
01:19:33.169 --> 01:19:33.179 align:start position:0%
where they're working right so if
 
01:19:34.790 --> 01:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
they're working in Massachusetts then
 
01:19:37.490 --> 01:19:37.500 align:start position:0%
it's not likely that you would be um
 
01:19:38.689 --> 01:19:38.699 align:start position:0%
they would be subject to bet because
 
01:19:40.970 --> 01:19:40.980 align:start position:0%
they're not New Hampshire employees
 
01:19:40.980 --> 01:19:43.370 align:start position:0%
they're not New Hampshire employees
yes

01:19:43.370 --> 01:19:43.380 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:19:46.490 --> 01:19:46.500 align:start position:0%
um I guess the other question we're all
 
01:19:48.709 --> 01:19:48.719 align:start position:0%
waiting for information on how this is
 
01:19:50.750 --> 01:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
playing out yes so that's what I was
 
01:19:52.070 --> 01:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
going to get to do okay are you ready
 
01:19:55.550 --> 01:19:55.560 align:start position:0%
okay so this is um if you go to slide 22
 
01:19:57.290 --> 01:19:57.300 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to go through this in
 
01:19:58.729 --> 01:19:58.739 align:start position:0%
detail because it is a little bit
 
01:20:02.330 --> 01:20:02.340 align:start position:0%
complicated and just keeping an eye on
 
01:20:03.590 --> 01:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
the time
 
01:20:05.390 --> 01:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
what I wanted to just generally explain
 
01:20:07.310 --> 01:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
is how this is all going to factor into
 
01:20:09.110 --> 01:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
the revenue estimating that we're going
 
01:20:10.729 --> 01:20:10.739 align:start position:0%
to work on with all of you
 
01:20:13.729 --> 01:20:13.739 align:start position:0%
so on slide 22 we've included some of
 
01:20:15.350 --> 01:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
the larger changes that we just
 
01:20:17.510 --> 01:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
discussed the market-based sourcing the
 
01:20:20.450 --> 01:20:20.460 align:start position:0%
CCO cap the single sales factor and then
 
01:20:22.450 --> 01:20:22.460 align:start position:0%
there is a small change to
 
01:20:25.610 --> 01:20:25.620 align:start position:0%
the nol calculation
 
01:20:29.630 --> 01:20:29.640 align:start position:0%
I've included here what the impact of
 
01:20:32.630 --> 01:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
those tax changes look like over the
 
01:20:35.149 --> 01:20:35.159 align:start position:0%
next few fiscal years so kind of the
 
01:20:37.729 --> 01:20:37.739 align:start position:0%
timing of those tax changes when will we
 
01:20:40.729 --> 01:20:40.739 align:start position:0%
see those tax changes come into effect
 
01:20:42.830 --> 01:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do with you for
 
01:20:46.430 --> 01:20:46.440 align:start position:0%
Revenue estimating to help make all of
 
01:20:48.169 --> 01:20:48.179 align:start position:0%
these complications hopefully a little
 
01:20:51.590 --> 01:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
bit simpler is when we come to you we're
 
01:20:54.770 --> 01:20:54.780 align:start position:0%
going to give you estimates for any of
 
01:20:57.470 --> 01:20:57.480 align:start position:0%
these tax changes that we haven't fully
 
01:21:00.410 --> 01:21:00.420 align:start position:0%
realized the effect of yet
 
01:21:03.229 --> 01:21:03.239 align:start position:0%
so if a tax change has been fully
 
01:21:05.090 --> 01:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
implemented and would have been seen in
 
01:21:07.130 --> 01:21:07.140 align:start position:0%
revenues we're not going to have to talk
 
01:21:09.530 --> 01:21:09.540 align:start position:0%
about it we're just going to work with
 
01:21:11.990 --> 01:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
you on those tax changes that we haven't
 
01:21:15.649 --> 01:21:15.659 align:start position:0%
seen the full impact in our revenues yet
 
01:21:17.689 --> 01:21:17.699 align:start position:0%
again in a way to hopefully make it
 
01:21:19.970 --> 01:21:19.980 align:start position:0%
simpler and we'll do the the legwork for
 
01:21:22.370 --> 01:21:22.380 align:start position:0%
you about what we haven't seen yet and
 
01:21:24.370 --> 01:21:24.380 align:start position:0%
what we think that impact is going to be
 
01:21:27.169 --> 01:21:27.179 align:start position:0%
so I know it feels like there there's
 
01:21:28.910 --> 01:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
been a lot of changes over the past few
 
01:21:30.890 --> 01:21:30.900 align:start position:0%
years and it can be overwhelming but
 
01:21:32.149 --> 01:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
we're going to try to make it as simple
 
01:21:34.490 --> 01:21:34.500 align:start position:0%
as possible and just talk through those
 
01:21:36.709 --> 01:21:36.719 align:start position:0%
changes for which we haven't seen the
 
01:21:39.649 --> 01:21:39.659 align:start position:0%
full impact yet in our revenues
 
01:21:42.709 --> 01:21:42.719 align:start position:0%
sound good representative fellows
 
01:21:44.630 --> 01:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
so they're
 
01:21:47.990 --> 01:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
um going back to page 21 so the
 
01:21:49.970 --> 01:21:49.980 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing and the single
 
01:21:54.050 --> 01:21:54.060 align:start position:0%
sales Factor those came about because a
 
01:21:56.750 --> 01:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
bill was passed yep those are changes
 
01:21:58.130 --> 01:21:58.140 align:start position:0%
that came about through legislation
 
01:22:00.350 --> 01:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
correct do you know
 
01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:01.970 align:start position:0%
correct do you know
um

01:22:01.970 --> 01:22:01.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:04.669 --> 01:22:04.679 align:start position:0%
do do you have any references
 
01:22:06.950 --> 01:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
we can get you the build numbers they're
 
01:22:08.450 --> 01:22:08.460 align:start position:0%
included in our technical information
 
01:22:10.669 --> 01:22:10.679 align:start position:0%
releases that we do every year based on
 
01:22:12.530 --> 01:22:12.540 align:start position:0%
the legislative session so we can get
 
01:22:16.030 --> 01:22:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:18.530 --> 01:22:18.540 align:start position:0%
representative spilsbury
 
01:22:22.130 --> 01:22:22.140 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair do we accrue and
 
01:22:25.490 --> 01:22:25.500 align:start position:0%
ultimately pay an interest liability to
 
01:22:28.370 --> 01:22:28.380 align:start position:0%
those who carry um
 
01:22:30.130 --> 01:22:30.140 align:start position:0%
carry over there
 
01:22:34.130 --> 01:22:34.140 align:start position:0%
we would pay interest only we have 90
 
01:22:36.470 --> 01:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
days to pay out a refund after it's been
 
01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:38.209 align:start position:0%
days to pay out a refund after it's been
requested

01:22:38.209 --> 01:22:38.219 align:start position:0%
requested
 
01:22:42.350 --> 01:22:42.360 align:start position:0%
so the 300 plus million carries with it
 
01:22:44.689 --> 01:22:44.699 align:start position:0%
an undefined interest liability
 
01:22:46.970 --> 01:22:46.980 align:start position:0%
potentially potentially but as long as
 
01:22:48.770 --> 01:22:48.780 align:start position:0%
we pay out those refunds in a timely
 
01:22:50.810 --> 01:22:50.820 align:start position:0%
manner from the date of request there
 
01:22:58.010 --> 01:22:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:02.030 --> 01:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
okay so we sorry I apologize I missed a
 
01:23:04.189 --> 01:23:04.199 align:start position:0%
hand representative all me
 
01:23:06.890 --> 01:23:06.900 align:start position:0%
thank you I'd just like to say this
 
01:23:09.709 --> 01:23:09.719 align:start position:0%
committee agreed with market-based
 
01:23:09.719 --> 01:23:11.870 align:start position:0%
committee agreed with market-based
sourcing

01:23:11.870 --> 01:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
sourcing
 
01:23:14.750 --> 01:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
and you thought that it probably wasn't
 
01:23:17.090 --> 01:23:17.100 align:start position:0%
going to change stuff much
 
01:23:20.570 --> 01:23:20.580 align:start position:0%
and and we'll find out and we will find
 
01:23:22.370 --> 01:23:22.380 align:start position:0%
out we won't find out about any of this
 
01:23:26.270 --> 01:23:26.280 align:start position:0%
stuff but market-based sourcing on you
 
01:23:28.610 --> 01:23:28.620 align:start position:0%
told us that once it had been in place
 
01:23:32.149 --> 01:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
for enough time we'd be able to get a
 
01:23:34.130 --> 01:23:34.140 align:start position:0%
clearer estimate of what single sales
 
01:23:36.950 --> 01:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
Factor would do to us and this committee
 
01:23:40.669 --> 01:23:40.679 align:start position:0%
fought tooth and nail in the budget uh
 
01:23:42.189 --> 01:23:42.199 align:start position:0%
and lost
 
01:23:46.610 --> 01:23:46.620 align:start position:0%
to of to push single sales factor out to
 
01:23:46.620 --> 01:23:49.070 align:start position:0%
to of to push single sales factor out to
26.

01:23:49.070 --> 01:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
26.
 
01:23:51.950 --> 01:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
right so to represent of elmy's Point
 
01:23:54.950 --> 01:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
um when the legislature had the desire
 
01:23:57.950 --> 01:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
to move from the cost of performance
 
01:24:01.010 --> 01:24:01.020 align:start position:0%
method of apportionment for sales and
 
01:24:03.530 --> 01:24:03.540 align:start position:0%
services and intangibles excuse me to
 
01:24:07.750 --> 01:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing we were unable to
 
01:24:10.490 --> 01:24:10.500 align:start position:0%
develop a revenue impact for that
 
01:24:14.510 --> 01:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
because we didn't know where the
 
01:24:16.010 --> 01:24:16.020 align:start position:0%
customers were we knew where the
 
01:24:17.930 --> 01:24:17.940 align:start position:0%
services were being performed that's how
 
01:24:20.149 --> 01:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
it worked under cost of performance but
 
01:24:21.649 --> 01:24:21.659 align:start position:0%
we didn't have any data that told us
 
01:24:23.390 --> 01:24:23.400 align:start position:0%
where the customers were which is how
 
01:24:24.830 --> 01:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
the apportionment was going to work
 
01:24:28.250 --> 01:24:28.260 align:start position:0%
under market-based sourcing so we had no
 
01:24:30.470 --> 01:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
Revenue impact no ability to estimate
 
01:24:32.689 --> 01:24:32.699 align:start position:0%
that Revenue impact
 
01:24:35.870 --> 01:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
going from three Factor apportionment to
 
01:24:39.050 --> 01:24:39.060 align:start position:0%
single sales Factor we can do that math
 
01:24:41.270 --> 01:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
because we know what the sales factor is
 
01:24:42.950 --> 01:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
because they're currently reporting it
 
01:24:46.070 --> 01:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
to us with the two other factors
 
01:24:48.649 --> 01:24:48.659 align:start position:0%
the problem there was that single sales
 
01:24:51.110 --> 01:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
Factor was coming right on the heels of
 
01:24:53.750 --> 01:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
the change to market-based sourcing and
 
01:24:56.750 --> 01:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
so the revenue impacts that we estimated
 
01:24:59.570 --> 01:24:59.580 align:start position:0%
for the move to single sales was under
 
01:25:01.550 --> 01:25:01.560 align:start position:0%
the cost of performance method so
 
01:25:03.229 --> 01:25:03.239 align:start position:0%
because these two changes are happening
 
01:25:06.350 --> 01:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
in quick secession we don't have the
 
01:25:08.030 --> 01:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
data yet and didn't have it at the time
 
01:25:09.169 --> 01:25:09.179 align:start position:0%
that the legislation was being
 
01:25:11.390 --> 01:25:11.400 align:start position:0%
contemplated to actually estimate the
 
01:25:15.290 --> 01:25:15.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:17.870 --> 01:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
representative ulery
 
01:25:20.630 --> 01:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for the
 
01:25:23.149 --> 01:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
dedication to the changes that we're
 
01:25:23.159 --> 01:25:24.290 align:start position:0%
dedication to the changes that we're
making

01:25:24.290 --> 01:25:24.300 align:start position:0%
making
 
01:25:26.930 --> 01:25:26.940 align:start position:0%
sometimes mind-boggling the question I
 
01:25:29.330 --> 01:25:29.340 align:start position:0%
have going back to the example that I
 
01:25:31.010 --> 01:25:31.020 align:start position:0%
provided and there's a couple of
 
01:25:33.350 --> 01:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
companies down where I'm located to do
 
01:25:35.290 --> 01:25:35.300 align:start position:0%
that how do they become Massachusetts
 
01:25:39.470 --> 01:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
employees when they clock in in Hudson
 
01:25:42.410 --> 01:25:42.420 align:start position:0%
so it's it's hard to talk about specific
 
01:25:45.050 --> 01:25:45.060 align:start position:0%
examples because each business is going
 
01:25:47.630 --> 01:25:47.640 align:start position:0%
to operate differently so those are you
 
01:25:49.490 --> 01:25:49.500 align:start position:0%
know where they clock in where they do
 
01:25:51.709 --> 01:25:51.719 align:start position:0%
their work where they're paid where
 
01:25:54.169 --> 01:25:54.179 align:start position:0%
their home base is considered do they
 
01:25:56.149 --> 01:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
have a home base do they not these are
 
01:25:58.610 --> 01:25:58.620 align:start position:0%
all things that would factor into their
 
01:26:01.010 --> 01:26:01.020 align:start position:0%
actual liability so for these businesses
 
01:26:02.629 --> 01:26:02.639 align:start position:0%
it's kind of it's difficult to talk
 
01:26:04.550 --> 01:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
about exactly how it would work without
 
01:26:08.810 --> 01:26:08.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:11.990 --> 01:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
this also applies to an other
 
01:26:14.030 --> 01:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
legislation we have coming up regarding
 
01:26:17.390 --> 01:26:17.400 align:start position:0%
income taxes or uh Massachusetts trying
 
01:26:18.649 --> 01:26:18.659 align:start position:0%
to take money from New Hampshire
 
01:26:20.930 --> 01:26:20.940 align:start position:0%
employees which is one of the reasons I
 
01:26:22.729 --> 01:26:22.739 align:start position:0%
want to hit this
 
01:26:25.970 --> 01:26:25.980 align:start position:0%
uh question uh a little a little more
 
01:26:28.370 --> 01:26:28.380 align:start position:0%
deeply uh
 
01:26:28.380 --> 01:26:30.350 align:start position:0%
deeply uh
so

01:26:30.350 --> 01:26:30.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:26:32.810 --> 01:26:32.820 align:start position:0%
it would be interesting if if we got a
 
01:26:35.689 --> 01:26:35.699 align:start position:0%
list of that that we could apply not
 
01:26:37.910 --> 01:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
only to this discussion into estimating
 
01:26:41.689 --> 01:26:41.699 align:start position:0%
but also to the income tax issue that we
 
01:26:43.310 --> 01:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
have coming up we can kind of list out
 
01:26:45.169 --> 01:26:45.179 align:start position:0%
for you factors that would be considered
 
01:26:47.090 --> 01:26:47.100 align:start position:0%
under where the employee would be
 
01:26:48.950 --> 01:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
considered taxable if that's acceptable
 
01:26:50.149 --> 01:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
Madam chair
 
01:26:59.330 --> 01:26:59.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:02.570 --> 01:27:02.580 align:start position:0%
okay how do we feel on business taxes I
 
01:27:04.010 --> 01:27:04.020 align:start position:0%
apologize we have another question
 
01:27:07.850 --> 01:27:07.860 align:start position:0%
representative Ames I'm sorry uh
 
01:27:11.510 --> 01:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
thinking about this for a a business
 
01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:12.649 align:start position:0%
thinking about this for a a business
that

01:27:12.649 --> 01:27:12.659 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:27:16.910 --> 01:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
is selling into several States
 
01:27:19.490 --> 01:27:19.500 align:start position:0%
or even just one are you interacting
 
01:27:21.649 --> 01:27:21.659 align:start position:0%
with the tax departments on the other
 
01:27:23.330 --> 01:27:23.340 align:start position:0%
states I mean there needs to be a
 
01:27:25.970 --> 01:27:25.980 align:start position:0%
uniform approach to this that's a good
 
01:27:27.950 --> 01:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
point so yes we have exchange agreements
 
01:27:29.990 --> 01:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
with other states we routinely interact
 
01:27:31.370 --> 01:27:31.380 align:start position:0%
with them
 
01:27:33.950 --> 01:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
um but to your point one of the reasons
 
01:27:35.390 --> 01:27:35.400 align:start position:0%
that brought about this change
 
01:27:37.850 --> 01:27:37.860 align:start position:0%
especially to market-based sourcing was
 
01:27:40.790 --> 01:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
that when states are not uniform in
 
01:27:43.970 --> 01:27:43.980 align:start position:0%
their methodologies businesses can pay
 
01:27:46.729 --> 01:27:46.739 align:start position:0%
tax say on services that they perform
 
01:27:49.070 --> 01:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire they can pay tax
 
01:27:50.750 --> 01:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire under cost of
 
01:27:53.209 --> 01:27:53.219 align:start position:0%
performance and then if their customer
 
01:27:56.149 --> 01:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
is in Massachusetts and Massachusetts is
 
01:27:57.890 --> 01:27:57.900 align:start position:0%
a market-based sourcing state they're
 
01:27:59.750 --> 01:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
going to pay tax in Massachusetts on
 
01:28:01.310 --> 01:28:01.320 align:start position:0%
that same service
 
01:28:04.970 --> 01:28:04.980 align:start position:0%
so until the states or if ever the
 
01:28:06.830 --> 01:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
states are totally uniform in how they
 
01:28:09.649 --> 01:28:09.659 align:start position:0%
apportion income there are instances
 
01:28:11.870 --> 01:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
where business can pay the tax in New
 
01:28:14.149 --> 01:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for work and pay tax in
 
01:28:16.189 --> 01:28:16.199 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts for that same work and
 
01:28:17.330 --> 01:28:17.340 align:start position:0%
that was one of the reasons why
 
01:28:19.310 --> 01:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing that shift to
 
01:28:21.229 --> 01:28:21.239 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing came about here in
 
01:28:22.550 --> 01:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire because many of our
 
01:28:24.649 --> 01:28:24.659 align:start position:0%
neighboring states are also market-based
 
01:28:26.209 --> 01:28:26.219 align:start position:0%
sourcing States and so this should
 
01:28:26.219 --> 01:28:28.070 align:start position:0%
sourcing States and so this should
decrease

01:28:28.070 --> 01:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
decrease
 
01:28:29.390 --> 01:28:29.400 align:start position:0%
um the instances where New Hampshire
 
01:28:31.729 --> 01:28:31.739 align:start position:0%
businesses were paying tax on the same
 
01:28:36.649 --> 01:28:36.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:38.510 --> 01:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
okay are we feeling okay on business
 
01:28:41.629 --> 01:28:41.639 align:start position:0%
taxes we got a half hour to get through
 
01:28:43.070 --> 01:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
the rest well and just so we're going to
 
01:28:44.810 --> 01:28:44.820 align:start position:0%
keep this keep going your questions are
 
01:28:45.950 --> 01:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
excellent the information you're
 
01:28:47.750 --> 01:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
providing is excellent and then they're
 
01:28:49.070 --> 01:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
going to come back and then we're going
 
01:28:50.390 --> 01:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
to do Revenue estimates and we're going
 
01:28:51.890 --> 01:28:51.900 align:start position:0%
to have we're going to make sure we give
 
01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
this agency as much time as we need so
 
01:28:56.810 --> 01:28:56.820 align:start position:0%
we can talk through each piece again
 
01:28:58.490 --> 01:28:58.500 align:start position:0%
okay sure
 
01:28:59.870 --> 01:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
thank you okay so we'll move pretty
 
01:29:00.950 --> 01:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
quickly I think through the rest
 
01:29:02.810 --> 01:29:02.820 align:start position:0%
business taxes are by far the most
 
01:29:04.550 --> 01:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
complicated so we should be able to move
 
01:29:06.290 --> 01:29:06.300 align:start position:0%
pretty quickly
 
01:29:07.370 --> 01:29:07.380 align:start position:0%
um and again most of this information
 
01:29:09.530 --> 01:29:09.540 align:start position:0%
was previously provided so hopefully
 
01:29:10.910 --> 01:29:10.920 align:start position:0%
some of it is sounding at least a little
 
01:29:13.010 --> 01:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
bit familiar uh the meals and rooms are
 
01:29:15.110 --> 01:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
the meals and rentals tax is it eight
 
01:29:17.570 --> 01:29:17.580 align:start position:0%
and a half percent tax on meals room
 
01:29:19.850 --> 01:29:19.860 align:start position:0%
rentals and motor vehicle rentals the
 
01:29:21.830 --> 01:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
taxes paid by you the consumer at the
 
01:29:24.709 --> 01:29:24.719 align:start position:0%
time that you eat that meal the operator
 
01:29:26.330 --> 01:29:26.340 align:start position:0%
who operates the restaurant where you
 
01:29:28.310 --> 01:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
might be dining is responsible for
 
01:29:30.709 --> 01:29:30.719 align:start position:0%
collecting that tax and remitting it to
 
01:29:32.810 --> 01:29:32.820 align:start position:0%
the department on a monthly basis
 
01:29:35.570 --> 01:29:35.580 align:start position:0%
doing so in a manner compliant with the
 
01:29:38.450 --> 01:29:38.460 align:start position:0%
statute meaning on-time filing allows
 
01:29:40.850 --> 01:29:40.860 align:start position:0%
those operators to retain three percent
 
01:29:42.649 --> 01:29:42.659 align:start position:0%
for the work that they do for collecting
 
01:29:45.169 --> 01:29:45.179 align:start position:0%
the tax on the state's behalf
 
01:29:47.689 --> 01:29:47.699 align:start position:0%
returns are filing filed on a monthly
 
01:29:50.390 --> 01:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
basis on the 15th day of the month for
 
01:29:53.030 --> 01:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
the following for the prior month and
 
01:29:55.370 --> 01:29:55.380 align:start position:0%
electronically electronic filing is
 
01:29:59.209 --> 01:29:59.219 align:start position:0%
available to operators a paper return is
 
01:30:01.010 --> 01:30:01.020 align:start position:0%
not required so operators have the
 
01:30:02.689 --> 01:30:02.699 align:start position:0%
opportunity to just file electronically
 
01:30:04.490 --> 01:30:04.500 align:start position:0%
and not worry about sending us paper on
 
01:30:07.610 --> 01:30:07.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:11.629 --> 01:30:11.639 align:start position:0%
on side 24 there are two
 
01:30:13.490 --> 01:30:13.500 align:start position:0%
amounts that come out of the meals and
 
01:30:15.649 --> 01:30:15.659 align:start position:0%
rentals tax on a monthly basis that I
 
01:30:18.709 --> 01:30:18.719 align:start position:0%
just wanted to flag for you on the left
 
01:30:21.169 --> 01:30:21.179 align:start position:0%
is the school building Aid this is
 
01:30:23.770 --> 01:30:23.780 align:start position:0%
school building Aid Debt Service
 
01:30:27.470 --> 01:30:27.480 align:start position:0%
for fiscal 23 the total amount for the
 
01:30:29.510 --> 01:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
year is just over seven million dollars
 
01:30:32.510 --> 01:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
and we transfer over just half a million
 
01:30:35.330 --> 01:30:35.340 align:start position:0%
out of the general fund on a monthly
 
01:30:35.340 --> 01:30:37.010 align:start position:0%
out of the general fund on a monthly
basis

01:30:37.010 --> 01:30:37.020 align:start position:0%
basis
 
01:30:40.610 --> 01:30:40.620 align:start position:0%
more notably on the right is the
 
01:30:43.310 --> 01:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
municipal Revenue fund and this as we
 
01:30:45.770 --> 01:30:45.780 align:start position:0%
mentioned at the prior presentation this
 
01:30:47.990 --> 01:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
began in fiscal 2022
 
01:30:51.290 --> 01:30:51.300 align:start position:0%
and 30 percent of m r uh from the most
 
01:30:53.450 --> 01:30:53.460 align:start position:0%
recent fiscal year is distributed to
 
01:30:55.910 --> 01:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
cities and towns via this Municipal
 
01:30:57.590 --> 01:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
Revenue fund
 
01:30:59.450 --> 01:30:59.460 align:start position:0%
amounts are transferred on a monthly
 
01:31:02.090 --> 01:31:02.100 align:start position:0%
basis out of the general fund and into
 
01:31:04.149 --> 01:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
this dedicated fund
 
01:31:09.169 --> 01:31:09.179 align:start position:0%
in fiscal 22 the amount was just over
 
01:31:11.930 --> 01:31:11.940 align:start position:0%
100 million 100.1 million and in fiscal
 
01:31:15.530 --> 01:31:15.540 align:start position:0%
23 we will be transferring 121 million
 
01:31:17.629 --> 01:31:17.639 align:start position:0%
out of the general fund into this
 
01:31:20.570 --> 01:31:20.580 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund again this happens on a
 
01:31:23.209 --> 01:31:23.219 align:start position:0%
monthly basis right now in fiscal 23
 
01:31:25.729 --> 01:31:25.739 align:start position:0%
it's about 10 million dollars each month
 
01:31:28.550 --> 01:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
the amount per month fluctuates based on
 
01:31:30.410 --> 01:31:30.420 align:start position:0%
the amount of Revenue that we typically
 
01:31:32.750 --> 01:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
receive in that month
 
01:31:35.149 --> 01:31:35.159 align:start position:0%
so just note that when you're comparing
 
01:31:41.270 --> 01:31:41.280 align:start position:0%
m r to fiscal 21 and prior we were not
 
01:31:43.910 --> 01:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
taking this money out so you'll see on
 
01:31:45.470 --> 01:31:45.480 align:start position:0%
the slides it looks like m r has
 
01:31:47.510 --> 01:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
actually gone down when it act when it
 
01:31:50.689 --> 01:31:50.699 align:start position:0%
hasn't the the reflection of this
 
01:31:52.370 --> 01:31:52.380 align:start position:0%
Municipal Revenue transfer is looking
 
01:31:54.290 --> 01:31:54.300 align:start position:0%
like a reduction
 
01:31:56.390 --> 01:31:56.400 align:start position:0%
in m r
 
01:31:59.390 --> 01:31:59.400 align:start position:0%
um on the third bullet on the right hand
 
01:31:59.400 --> 01:32:00.709 align:start position:0%
um on the third bullet on the right hand
side

01:32:00.709 --> 01:32:00.719 align:start position:0%
side
 
01:32:03.229 --> 01:32:03.239 align:start position:0%
I'm just showing what the municipal
 
01:32:06.050 --> 01:32:06.060 align:start position:0%
Revenue transfer used to be so the
 
01:32:08.930 --> 01:32:08.940 align:start position:0%
amount used to be 40 however it had been
 
01:32:12.229 --> 01:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
capped for a number of years and these
 
01:32:13.970 --> 01:32:13.980 align:start position:0%
amounts were paid out at the end of the
 
01:32:16.790 --> 01:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
year it was not done via a monthly
 
01:32:21.410 --> 01:32:21.420 align:start position:0%
Revenue transfer so grow or so m r
 
01:32:24.050 --> 01:32:24.060 align:start position:0%
amounts again for fiscal 21 in Prior
 
01:32:28.669 --> 01:32:28.679 align:start position:0%
will not reflect these m r distributions
 
01:32:31.189 --> 01:32:31.199 align:start position:0%
um but they will in 22 and 23. so
 
01:32:33.410 --> 01:32:33.420 align:start position:0%
comparing year to year
 
01:32:35.149 --> 01:32:35.159 align:start position:0%
we will work with you when we're doing
 
01:32:37.250 --> 01:32:37.260 align:start position:0%
Revenue estimates to actually estimate
 
01:32:39.350 --> 01:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
the gross revenue that would be received
 
01:32:41.270 --> 01:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
and then we'll take out these transfers
 
01:32:43.790 --> 01:32:43.800 align:start position:0%
to make it simple and make it more
 
01:32:45.910 --> 01:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
um easier to compare prior years
 
01:32:48.709 --> 01:32:48.719 align:start position:0%
representative thank you madam chair
 
01:32:51.050 --> 01:32:51.060 align:start position:0%
just a quick question uh you say the
 
01:32:53.510 --> 01:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
amounts were capped they were capped at
 
01:32:56.930 --> 01:32:56.940 align:start position:0%
roughly 22 percent I believe yeah that's
 
01:32:59.090 --> 01:32:59.100 align:start position:0%
roughly the amount so even though the
 
01:33:02.030 --> 01:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
statute said 40 percent legislation via
 
01:33:04.790 --> 01:33:04.800 align:start position:0%
hb2 frequently as you can see for a
 
01:33:06.530 --> 01:33:06.540 align:start position:0%
number of years capped the amount at
 
01:33:08.450 --> 01:33:08.460 align:start position:0%
what had been distributed pre in the
 
01:33:10.129 --> 01:33:10.139 align:start position:0%
previous years
 
01:33:11.990 --> 01:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:33:14.090 --> 01:33:14.100 align:start position:0%
representative Phyllis
 
01:33:15.530 --> 01:33:15.540 align:start position:0%
um thank you I have a question about the
 
01:33:18.110 --> 01:33:18.120 align:start position:0%
school building Aid that so where the
 
01:33:21.169 --> 01:33:21.179 align:start position:0%
state is paying off debt it borrowed
 
01:33:23.750 --> 01:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
money to fund the schools that were
 
01:33:26.930 --> 01:33:26.940 align:start position:0%
built does are we finished
 
01:33:28.669 --> 01:33:28.679 align:start position:0%
um paying off that debt when we get to
 
01:33:32.629 --> 01:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
2030 that's correct okay thank you
 
01:33:34.370 --> 01:33:34.380 align:start position:0%
for the current round of debt if there
 
01:33:35.689 --> 01:33:35.699 align:start position:0%
was additional debt that the state
 
01:33:38.149 --> 01:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
chooses to fund in this manner then it
 
01:33:40.189 --> 01:33:40.199 align:start position:0%
could extend beyond 2030 but right now
 
01:33:45.290 --> 01:33:45.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:48.590 --> 01:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
okay slide 25 this just shows the
 
01:33:50.450 --> 01:33:50.460 align:start position:0%
breakdown between meals rooms and motor
 
01:33:52.070 --> 01:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
vehicle rentals you'll see the vast
 
01:33:54.890 --> 01:33:54.900 align:start position:0%
majority of m r revenue is received from
 
01:33:54.900 --> 01:33:57.530 align:start position:0%
majority of m r revenue is received from
food

01:33:57.530 --> 01:33:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:00.050 --> 01:34:00.060 align:start position:0%
on slide 26 I think this may have been
 
01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned at our prior presentation but
 
01:34:04.970 --> 01:34:04.980 align:start position:0%
just looking at the m r Revenue that's
 
01:34:07.970 --> 01:34:07.980 align:start position:0%
generated by county
 
01:34:10.550 --> 01:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
um so you'll see at the top we have the
 
01:34:13.370 --> 01:34:13.380 align:start position:0%
various counties going from left to
 
01:34:15.649 --> 01:34:15.659 align:start position:0%
right you will see
 
01:34:17.990 --> 01:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
um we're moving from largest to smallest
 
01:34:20.689 --> 01:34:20.699 align:start position:0%
so Rockingham County generates the
 
01:34:24.890 --> 01:34:24.900 align:start position:0%
largest amount of m r Revenue this is
 
01:34:27.610 --> 01:34:27.620 align:start position:0%
for fiscal 22 at
 
01:34:30.830 --> 01:34:30.840 align:start position:0%
131.2 million Sullivan County being the
 
01:34:34.189 --> 01:34:34.199 align:start position:0%
smallest at 4.5 million
 
01:34:36.470 --> 01:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
at the bottom you'll see the breakdown
 
01:34:37.970 --> 01:34:37.980 align:start position:0%
by county
 
01:34:41.090 --> 01:34:41.100 align:start position:0%
and then broken down by meals rooms in
 
01:34:43.550 --> 01:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle a couple of things I would
 
01:34:45.709 --> 01:34:45.719 align:start position:0%
point out here you'll see Stratford
 
01:34:49.250 --> 01:34:49.260 align:start position:0%
Rockingham Sullivan County mostly meals
 
01:34:51.110 --> 01:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
if you move over to Hillsboro you'll see
 
01:34:52.750 --> 01:34:52.760 align:start position:0%
that there's quite a large amount
 
01:34:55.129 --> 01:34:55.139 align:start position:0%
comparatively of motor vehicle rentals
 
01:34:57.709 --> 01:34:57.719 align:start position:0%
that would be the rental cars at the
 
01:34:57.719 --> 01:34:59.590 align:start position:0%
that would be the rental cars at the
airport

01:34:59.590 --> 01:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
airport
 
01:35:02.510 --> 01:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
and then moving over to Carol and koa's
 
01:35:05.090 --> 01:35:05.100 align:start position:0%
counties you'll see that there's in koas
 
01:35:07.250 --> 01:35:07.260 align:start position:0%
almost an equal distribution between
 
01:35:09.350 --> 01:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
meals and rooms Carol has slightly more
 
01:35:10.970 --> 01:35:10.980 align:start position:0%
meals than rooms but you'll just see how
 
01:35:16.610 --> 01:35:16.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:17.330 --> 01:35:17.340 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:35:20.090 --> 01:35:20.100 align:start position:0%
representative Russia has a question
 
01:35:20.100 --> 01:35:21.770 align:start position:0%
representative Russia has a question
so

01:35:21.770 --> 01:35:21.780 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:35:24.350 --> 01:35:24.360 align:start position:0%
percentage of this room's
 
01:35:26.090 --> 01:35:26.100 align:start position:0%
tax that we're collecting is
 
01:35:28.550 --> 01:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
attributable to short-term rentals
 
01:35:30.110 --> 01:35:30.120 align:start position:0%
yes and no
 
01:35:32.209 --> 01:35:32.219 align:start position:0%
um so when
 
01:35:34.010 --> 01:35:34.020 align:start position:0%
an operator
 
01:35:34.020 --> 01:35:35.090 align:start position:0%
an operator
um

01:35:35.090 --> 01:35:35.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:37.129 --> 01:35:37.139 align:start position:0%
receives a license from the Department
 
01:35:40.129 --> 01:35:40.139 align:start position:0%
they self-identify what sort of business
 
01:35:42.050 --> 01:35:42.060 align:start position:0%
they are so are they a full-service
 
01:35:44.030 --> 01:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
hotel are they a full service rent
 
01:35:46.550 --> 01:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
restaurant are they a fast food
 
01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:48.290 align:start position:0%
restaurant are they a fast food
restaurant

01:35:48.290 --> 01:35:48.300 align:start position:0%
restaurant
 
01:35:50.149 --> 01:35:50.159 align:start position:0%
um short-term rentals is not technically
 
01:35:52.850 --> 01:35:52.860 align:start position:0%
a category but they typically fall under
 
01:35:55.790 --> 01:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
what we would call rental agents and so
 
01:35:58.129 --> 01:35:58.139 align:start position:0%
those would be either your online travel
 
01:36:01.310 --> 01:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
platforms or your local real estate
 
01:36:03.490 --> 01:36:03.500 align:start position:0%
agent that also has a rental business
 
01:36:06.110 --> 01:36:06.120 align:start position:0%
and you can rent homes you know vacation
 
01:36:09.169 --> 01:36:09.179 align:start position:0%
homes Etc through there so we can we can
 
01:36:11.750 --> 01:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
give you that breakdown if that's
 
01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:13.790 align:start position:0%
give you that breakdown if that's
helpful

01:36:13.790 --> 01:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
01:36:15.890 --> 01:36:15.900 align:start position:0%
yeah follow up thank you I I think it
 
01:36:17.149 --> 01:36:17.159 align:start position:0%
would be helpful because you know
 
01:36:18.649 --> 01:36:18.659 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of
 
01:36:21.229 --> 01:36:21.239 align:start position:0%
discussion right now about limiting
 
01:36:22.910 --> 01:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals or putting
 
01:36:26.149 --> 01:36:26.159 align:start position:0%
concessions on short-term rentals and um
 
01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
you know I think it would help our
 
01:36:30.470 --> 01:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
communities anyway to get a better idea
 
01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:31.790 align:start position:0%
communities anyway to get a better idea
of

01:36:31.790 --> 01:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:36:33.770 --> 01:36:33.780 align:start position:0%
whether whether that's something you can
 
01:36:36.350 --> 01:36:36.360 align:start position:0%
do in applic just in the application
 
01:36:38.570 --> 01:36:38.580 align:start position:0%
without the legislature's involvement
 
01:36:42.290 --> 01:36:42.300 align:start position:0%
just to get a better idea of really
 
01:36:44.629 --> 01:36:44.639 align:start position:0%
how much of our money is coming from
 
01:36:46.910 --> 01:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
from that I know where I'm from it's a
 
01:36:49.010 --> 01:36:49.020 align:start position:0%
topic of discussion but I'm afraid that
 
01:36:49.020 --> 01:36:49.850 align:start position:0%
topic of discussion but I'm afraid that
it's

01:36:49.850 --> 01:36:49.860 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:36:52.490 --> 01:36:52.500 align:start position:0%
you know it might have unintended
 
01:36:54.830 --> 01:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
consequences you know when it comes time
 
01:36:56.149 --> 01:36:56.159 align:start position:0%
to so it would get it would give the
 
01:36:58.729 --> 01:36:58.739 align:start position:0%
municipalities a little more data sure
 
01:37:02.629 --> 01:37:02.639 align:start position:0%
so I can just looking at December
 
01:37:02.639 --> 01:37:03.649 align:start position:0%
so I can just looking at December
um

01:37:03.649 --> 01:37:03.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:06.110 --> 01:37:06.120 align:start position:0%
meals and rentals Revenue that we
 
01:37:10.189 --> 01:37:10.199 align:start position:0%
received in January rental agents were
 
01:37:13.070 --> 01:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
about just under 1.2 million of the
 
01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:14.330 align:start position:0%
about just under 1.2 million of the
total

01:37:14.330 --> 01:37:14.340 align:start position:0%
total
 
01:37:18.410 --> 01:37:18.420 align:start position:0%
in December of 21 in December of 22 they
 
01:37:20.510 --> 01:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
were 1.5 million so we there's
 
01:37:21.950 --> 01:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
definitely a year-over-year increase
 
01:37:25.790 --> 01:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
there of over 25 percent
 
01:37:27.530 --> 01:37:27.540 align:start position:0%
um and then just to give you some
 
01:37:27.540 --> 01:37:36.229 align:start position:0%
um and then just to give you some
context

01:37:36.229 --> 01:37:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:38.330 --> 01:37:38.340 align:start position:0%
full service hotels which I think
 
01:37:39.890 --> 01:37:39.900 align:start position:0%
generally would be kind of what you
 
01:37:42.530 --> 01:37:42.540 align:start position:0%
anticipate like a Marietta Hampton Inn
 
01:37:44.930 --> 01:37:44.940 align:start position:0%
you know a full-service Hotel
 
01:37:47.450 --> 01:37:47.460 align:start position:0%
um in December of 21 they were 2.5
 
01:37:50.750 --> 01:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
million of m r revenue and December of
 
01:37:53.270 --> 01:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
22 they were 2.8 million so they saw an
 
01:37:56.390 --> 01:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
increase of just under 13 percent
 
01:37:58.610 --> 01:37:58.620 align:start position:0%
just to give you some context
 
01:38:00.770 --> 01:38:00.780 align:start position:0%
um in terms of what a full-service Hotel
 
01:38:04.189 --> 01:38:04.199 align:start position:0%
population versus this rental agent
 
01:38:06.770 --> 01:38:06.780 align:start position:0%
population again it's not totally
 
01:38:08.510 --> 01:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
foolproof because it's a self-identified
 
01:38:10.550 --> 01:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
code but I think we can see that
 
01:38:12.590 --> 01:38:12.600 align:start position:0%
definitely that short-term rental or
 
01:38:14.750 --> 01:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
rental agent category grew year over
 
01:38:18.050 --> 01:38:18.060 align:start position:0%
year more than the full service hotels
 
01:38:20.290 --> 01:38:20.300 align:start position:0%
did and I think that's kind of
 
01:38:22.370 --> 01:38:22.380 align:start position:0%
consistent with what we're hearing
 
01:38:22.380 --> 01:38:23.570 align:start position:0%
consistent with what we're hearing
generally

01:38:23.570 --> 01:38:23.580 align:start position:0%
generally
 
01:38:26.390 --> 01:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:28.129 --> 01:38:28.139 align:start position:0%
representative homie
 
01:38:31.430 --> 01:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:38:34.390 --> 01:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
the gentleman asked on about
 
01:38:36.950 --> 01:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities and I think it's
 
01:38:39.709 --> 01:38:39.719 align:start position:0%
important to point out that we don't
 
01:38:43.010 --> 01:38:43.020 align:start position:0%
know for municipalities because there
 
01:38:48.250 --> 01:38:48.260 align:start position:0%
may be an owner in a town that has no
 
01:38:52.070 --> 01:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
restaurants at all who owns Six
 
01:38:55.070 --> 01:38:55.080 align:start position:0%
restaurants in the region and he reports
 
01:38:56.870 --> 01:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
them from his town or from his
 
01:38:59.930 --> 01:38:59.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:02.330 --> 01:39:02.340 align:start position:0%
so that's a good point so it's
 
01:39:04.490 --> 01:39:04.500 align:start position:0%
um we've been asked previously about
 
01:39:07.189 --> 01:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
that distribution to municipalities that
 
01:39:10.910 --> 01:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
I mentioned how that calculation is done
 
01:39:12.890 --> 01:39:12.900 align:start position:0%
and that is currently done based on
 
01:39:16.250 --> 01:39:16.260 align:start position:0%
population so the we take the total
 
01:39:18.290 --> 01:39:18.300 align:start position:0%
population of the state we figure out
 
01:39:20.750 --> 01:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
how much population is in each town and
 
01:39:22.250 --> 01:39:22.260 align:start position:0%
that's how the amount is divvied up
 
01:39:24.229 --> 01:39:24.239 align:start position:0%
we've been asked well can't you
 
01:39:26.270 --> 01:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
distribute couldn't the state distribute
 
01:39:28.490 --> 01:39:28.500 align:start position:0%
the revenue to municipalities based on
 
01:39:31.669 --> 01:39:31.679 align:start position:0%
where the revenue is generated
 
01:39:33.649 --> 01:39:33.659 align:start position:0%
and to representative Ami's point the
 
01:39:37.970 --> 01:39:37.980 align:start position:0%
answer to that really is no because you
 
01:39:40.430 --> 01:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
do have an option as an m r fire filer
 
01:39:42.530 --> 01:39:42.540 align:start position:0%
to file a Consolidated return to file
 
01:39:45.470 --> 01:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
one return per month rather than five
 
01:39:48.110 --> 01:39:48.120 align:start position:0%
returns per month and so when you file
 
01:39:49.610 --> 01:39:49.620 align:start position:0%
that one return per month you're going
 
01:39:51.410 --> 01:39:51.420 align:start position:0%
to put your one address on it it might
 
01:39:53.270 --> 01:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
be the address of your headquarters but
 
01:39:55.729 --> 01:39:55.739 align:start position:0%
you might have locations in five or six
 
01:39:58.010 --> 01:39:58.020 align:start position:0%
different towns and so it's difficult
 
01:40:00.410 --> 01:40:00.420 align:start position:0%
for us to know without additional
 
01:40:03.470 --> 01:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
reporting if the operators
 
01:40:06.050 --> 01:40:06.060 align:start position:0%
um if we're required to do so we could
 
01:40:07.790 --> 01:40:07.800 align:start position:0%
break that information down but based on
 
01:40:09.229 --> 01:40:09.239 align:start position:0%
the information we have right now we
 
01:40:10.370 --> 01:40:10.380 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
01:40:13.490 --> 01:40:13.500 align:start position:0%
exactly how much revenue is generated in
 
01:40:16.790 --> 01:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
each town so when we do this chart based
 
01:40:18.890 --> 01:40:18.900 align:start position:0%
on County
 
01:40:22.189 --> 01:40:22.199 align:start position:0%
you there may be some
 
01:40:22.199 --> 01:40:24.290 align:start position:0%
you there may be some
um

01:40:24.290 --> 01:40:24.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:26.270 --> 01:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
we don't know for sure that all of the
 
01:40:28.250 --> 01:40:28.260 align:start position:0%
revenue is necessarily generated in that
 
01:40:30.430 --> 01:40:30.440 align:start position:0%
county if it was a Consolidated return
 
01:40:33.410 --> 01:40:33.420 align:start position:0%
but at the county basis it's probably
 
01:40:35.390 --> 01:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
pretty accurate but we can't go down to
 
01:40:37.790 --> 01:40:37.800 align:start position:0%
a town level basis because we could have
 
01:40:40.790 --> 01:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
five restaurants reporting under say
 
01:40:43.250 --> 01:40:43.260 align:start position:0%
just the Manchester location for
 
01:40:43.260 --> 01:40:44.590 align:start position:0%
just the Manchester location for
instance

01:40:44.590 --> 01:40:44.600 align:start position:0%
instance
 
01:40:46.430 --> 01:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
representative fellows and then
 
01:40:48.590 --> 01:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
representative oh thank you
 
01:40:50.390 --> 01:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
um I just had a question on your
 
01:40:53.510 --> 01:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
definition of short-term rentals and if
 
01:40:55.370 --> 01:40:55.380 align:start position:0%
you think
 
01:40:57.290 --> 01:40:57.300 align:start position:0%
um there are
 
01:40:59.390 --> 01:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
entities that are
 
01:41:02.890 --> 01:41:02.900 align:start position:0%
maybe doing short-term rentals that were
 
01:41:06.229 --> 01:41:06.239 align:start position:0%
missing out on the revenue that maybe we
 
01:41:09.530 --> 01:41:09.540 align:start position:0%
maybe we should be collecting so under
 
01:41:11.689 --> 01:41:11.699 align:start position:0%
the m r statute
 
01:41:14.570 --> 01:41:14.580 align:start position:0%
um rentals room rentals that are taxable
 
01:41:17.510 --> 01:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
are are stays shorter than six months so
 
01:41:20.270 --> 01:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
that's what we kind of use as a
 
01:41:24.110 --> 01:41:24.120 align:start position:0%
short-term definition per the statute if
 
01:41:26.510 --> 01:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
you are renting an apartment for a year
 
01:41:29.510 --> 01:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
that is not subject to tax under the
 
01:41:31.250 --> 01:41:31.260 align:start position:0%
meals and rentals tax that's a long-term
 
01:41:31.260 --> 01:41:32.510 align:start position:0%
meals and rentals tax that's a long-term
rental

01:41:32.510 --> 01:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
rental
 
01:41:35.330 --> 01:41:35.340 align:start position:0%
in terms of are there short-term rentals
 
01:41:37.729 --> 01:41:37.739 align:start position:0%
that we are missing out on there's
 
01:41:40.189 --> 01:41:40.199 align:start position:0%
multiple ways if I own a second home and
 
01:41:42.050 --> 01:41:42.060 align:start position:0%
I want to rent that out to people to
 
01:41:45.169 --> 01:41:45.179 align:start position:0%
come up to hold Earnest to go skiing
 
01:41:48.229 --> 01:41:48.239 align:start position:0%
um I can do that in a number of ways I
 
01:41:52.010 --> 01:41:52.020 align:start position:0%
can do that via an online platform and
 
01:41:54.590 --> 01:41:54.600 align:start position:0%
they will collect and remit the tax on
 
01:41:58.149 --> 01:41:58.159 align:start position:0%
my behalf I can do it through my local
 
01:42:01.310 --> 01:42:01.320 align:start position:0%
real estate or rental agent and that
 
01:42:02.930 --> 01:42:02.940 align:start position:0%
same scenario would apply they would
 
01:42:05.030 --> 01:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
collect and remit the tax on my behalf
 
01:42:07.910 --> 01:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
or I can put it out on Facebook to my
 
01:42:11.270 --> 01:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
friends and I would need to have a meals
 
01:42:14.149 --> 01:42:14.159 align:start position:0%
and rentals operator license I would
 
01:42:15.830 --> 01:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
need to collect that tax from the people
 
01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
that stay in my home and remit it to the
 
01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:19.490 align:start position:0%
that stay in my home and remit it to the
state

01:42:19.490 --> 01:42:19.500 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:42:21.830 --> 01:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
um there is a requirement in the law
 
01:42:24.229 --> 01:42:24.239 align:start position:0%
that if I am doing option three where
 
01:42:25.850 --> 01:42:25.860 align:start position:0%
I'm renting it out myself and I'm
 
01:42:27.590 --> 01:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
putting it out even say an ad in the
 
01:42:29.930 --> 01:42:29.940 align:start position:0%
newspaper that I include my meals and
 
01:42:32.390 --> 01:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
rentals tax license so that folks know
 
01:42:35.330 --> 01:42:35.340 align:start position:0%
that I am licensed and collecting in the
 
01:42:37.550 --> 01:42:37.560 align:start position:0%
remitting the tax
 
01:42:39.770 --> 01:42:39.780 align:start position:0%
um we will use those advertisements to
 
01:42:41.750 --> 01:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
help identify people that may or not may
 
01:42:45.970 --> 01:42:45.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:49.129 --> 01:42:49.139 align:start position:0%
if the rental agent if they're using a
 
01:42:51.649 --> 01:42:51.659 align:start position:0%
rental agent in that rental agent is not
 
01:42:54.050 --> 01:42:54.060 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire do would we still
 
01:42:56.209 --> 01:42:56.219 align:start position:0%
collect they would still need to have a
 
01:42:57.709 --> 01:42:57.719 align:start position:0%
license yep if they're renting property
 
01:42:59.510 --> 01:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
so if it's if they're on the border and
 
01:43:00.950 --> 01:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
they're in Massachusetts or On the
 
01:43:02.209 --> 01:43:02.219 align:start position:0%
Border in Maine but they're renting
 
01:43:03.470 --> 01:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
property in New Hampshire they would
 
01:43:05.149 --> 01:43:05.159 align:start position:0%
need to be licensed
 
01:43:07.609 --> 01:43:07.619 align:start position:0%
correct represent Oliver did you have
 
01:43:07.619 --> 01:43:08.930 align:start position:0%
correct represent Oliver did you have
something

01:43:08.930 --> 01:43:08.940 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:43:12.229 --> 01:43:12.239 align:start position:0%
yeah just to follow up immediately or
 
01:43:14.090 --> 01:43:14.100 align:start position:0%
operating an online service in
 
01:43:16.250 --> 01:43:16.260 align:start position:0%
California renting properties correct
 
01:43:18.109 --> 01:43:18.119 align:start position:0%
correct so the your online travel
 
01:43:20.689 --> 01:43:20.699 align:start position:0%
platforms etc those it doesn't matter
 
01:43:22.189 --> 01:43:22.199 align:start position:0%
that they're not physically here if
 
01:43:23.990 --> 01:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
they're renting property here then they
 
01:43:25.790 --> 01:43:25.800 align:start position:0%
need to be licensed I was just going to
 
01:43:28.070 --> 01:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong but just to put
 
01:43:30.770 --> 01:43:30.780 align:start position:0%
a face on the difficulty in the signing
 
01:43:33.830 --> 01:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
to towns you have uh franchise
 
01:43:36.350 --> 01:43:36.360 align:start position:0%
operations uh there's a couple of large
 
01:43:38.990 --> 01:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
families that have several large Dunkin
 
01:43:41.570 --> 01:43:41.580 align:start position:0%
Donut franchises great example of 15
 
01:43:45.770 --> 01:43:45.780 align:start position:0%
different stores uh McDonald's even
 
01:43:49.129 --> 01:43:49.139 align:start position:0%
um the great Foods chain correct which
 
01:43:50.570 --> 01:43:50.580 align:start position:0%
has what four different restaurants
 
01:43:53.209 --> 01:43:53.219 align:start position:0%
correct uh are four different restaurant
 
01:43:56.149 --> 01:43:56.159 align:start position:0%
Brands Brands yes and 20 some odd
 
01:43:58.129 --> 01:43:58.139 align:start position:0%
restaurants they're in different towns
 
01:44:00.050 --> 01:44:00.060 align:start position:0%
all over the state so they're because
 
01:44:02.750 --> 01:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
they're filing on a monthly basis
 
01:44:04.790 --> 01:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
um they're going to file one return
 
01:44:06.590 --> 01:44:06.600 align:start position:0%
yeah they're gonna file 12 returns but
 
01:44:08.570 --> 01:44:08.580 align:start position:0%
if they had to file by location or break
 
01:44:10.070 --> 01:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
that information out by location it
 
01:44:11.689 --> 01:44:11.699 align:start position:0%
would be significantly more work for
 
01:44:13.310 --> 01:44:13.320 align:start position:0%
them yeah I just
 
01:44:17.930 --> 01:44:17.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:20.810 --> 01:44:20.820 align:start position:0%
okay slide 27 this is a chart you've
 
01:44:22.430 --> 01:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
seen before in the prior presentation
 
01:44:25.550 --> 01:44:25.560 align:start position:0%
this is just the 10-year Trend
 
01:44:28.729 --> 01:44:28.739 align:start position:0%
um of m r Revenue again this is after
 
01:44:31.250 --> 01:44:31.260 align:start position:0%
the municipal Revenue fund transfer so
 
01:44:34.370 --> 01:44:34.380 align:start position:0%
it looks like we have a decrease in
 
01:44:37.669 --> 01:44:37.679 align:start position:0%
revenue from fiscal year 21 to 22 but
 
01:44:41.330 --> 01:44:41.340 align:start position:0%
fiscal 22 transferred 100.1 million to
 
01:44:43.850 --> 01:44:43.860 align:start position:0%
the municipal Revenue fund so gross
 
01:44:47.109 --> 01:44:47.119 align:start position:0%
revenue in 22 was actually
 
01:44:49.790 --> 01:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
407.3 million
 
01:44:53.330 --> 01:44:53.340 align:start position:0%
so again we will add these back in and
 
01:44:55.310 --> 01:44:55.320 align:start position:0%
we'll grow the gross and then take it
 
01:44:57.290 --> 01:44:57.300 align:start position:0%
out for Revenue estimating purposes to
 
01:44:58.910 --> 01:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
make it a little bit easier for all of
 
01:44:58.920 --> 01:45:00.950 align:start position:0%
make it a little bit easier for all of
you

01:45:00.950 --> 01:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:45:02.510 --> 01:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
then we take it out then we add it back
 
01:45:02.520 --> 01:45:04.370 align:start position:0%
then we take it out then we add it back
in

01:45:04.370 --> 01:45:04.380 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:45:10.010 --> 01:45:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:10.020 --> 01:45:11.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:45:11.990 --> 01:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:45:14.149 --> 01:45:14.159 align:start position:0%
all right so uh moving on to the next
 
01:45:17.629 --> 01:45:17.639 align:start position:0%
text type is tobacco tax so tobacco is
 
01:45:21.950 --> 01:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
tax uh a few different ways one is if
 
01:45:25.010 --> 01:45:25.020 align:start position:0%
it's uh the tax stamps and the other if
 
01:45:26.870 --> 01:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
it's taxed as in other tobacco products
 
01:45:31.490 --> 01:45:31.500 align:start position:0%
so for tax stamps it is a tax at uh 1.78
 
01:45:35.050 --> 01:45:35.060 align:start position:0%
per pack of 20s 20 cigarettes and uh
 
01:45:39.669 --> 01:45:39.679 align:start position:0%
2.23 cents per pack of 25 and then
 
01:45:43.129 --> 01:45:43.139 align:start position:0%
65.03 percent of the wholesale price for
 
01:45:45.109 --> 01:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
other tobacco products except for
 
01:45:46.550 --> 01:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
e-cigarettes e-cigarettes depending on
 
01:45:48.050 --> 01:45:48.060 align:start position:0%
the type of e-cigarettes it's going to
 
01:45:50.149 --> 01:45:50.159 align:start position:0%
be taxed differently as well so
 
01:45:54.229 --> 01:45:54.239 align:start position:0%
e-cigarettes the close system tax rate
 
01:45:57.169 --> 01:45:57.179 align:start position:0%
is 0.3 per point three cents per
 
01:45:59.810 --> 01:45:59.820 align:start position:0%
millimeter on the volume of liquid or
 
01:46:02.450 --> 01:46:02.460 align:start position:0%
other substance containing nicotine and
 
01:46:04.490 --> 01:46:04.500 align:start position:0%
the open system is taxed at eight
 
01:46:07.430 --> 01:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
percent of the wholesale price of the
 
01:46:09.649 --> 01:46:09.659 align:start position:0%
container of the liquid
 
01:46:13.850 --> 01:46:13.860 align:start position:0%
now currently premium cigars are exempt
 
01:46:16.430 --> 01:46:16.440 align:start position:0%
from taxation uh premium cigars are
 
01:46:17.990 --> 01:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
defined as a
 
01:46:20.330 --> 01:46:20.340 align:start position:0%
cigars that's made by hand uh with
 
01:46:22.729 --> 01:46:22.739 align:start position:0%
natural tobacco leave weighs more than
 
01:46:25.070 --> 01:46:25.080 align:start position:0%
three pounds per 1000 cigars and it's
 
01:46:28.129 --> 01:46:28.139 align:start position:0%
kept in the humidor tax on tobacco
 
01:46:31.070 --> 01:46:31.080 align:start position:0%
products as a direct tax on consumer at
 
01:46:33.890 --> 01:46:33.900 align:start position:0%
retail but it's collected pre-collected
 
01:46:35.930 --> 01:46:35.940 align:start position:0%
and paid by the wholesaler so
 
01:46:37.550 --> 01:46:37.560 align:start position:0%
essentially it's a tax on on the
 
01:46:37.560 --> 01:46:40.609 align:start position:0%
essentially it's a tax on on the
consumer

01:46:40.609 --> 01:46:40.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:43.609 --> 01:46:43.619 align:start position:0%
um and for packages of uh 20 and or 25
 
01:46:45.590 --> 01:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
cigarettes payment of tax is evidenced
 
01:46:47.870 --> 01:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
by a wholesaler purchase of tobacco tax
 
01:46:50.450 --> 01:46:50.460 align:start position:0%
stamps and that's a fixed to the the
 
01:46:57.490 --> 01:46:57.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:59.930 --> 01:46:59.940 align:start position:0%
representative Valerie
 
01:47:01.490 --> 01:47:01.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:47:03.709 --> 01:47:03.719 align:start position:0%
the question is you get nine percent
 
01:47:07.910 --> 01:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:10.910 --> 01:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
what is the cost to administer that tax
 
01:47:14.870 --> 01:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
versus the revenue generated
 
01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:16.370 align:start position:0%
versus the revenue generated
um

01:47:16.370 --> 01:47:16.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:24.890 --> 01:47:24.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:26.570 --> 01:47:26.580 align:start position:0%
well um
 
01:47:27.950 --> 01:47:27.960 align:start position:0%
I guess that's another rhetorical
 
01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:34.609 align:start position:0%
I guess that's another rhetorical
question

01:47:34.609 --> 01:47:34.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:36.830 --> 01:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
I appreciate just the opportunity to
 
01:47:38.689 --> 01:47:38.699 align:start position:0%
bring that forward because the cost to
 
01:47:41.570 --> 01:47:41.580 align:start position:0%
administer collection of taxes is also a
 
01:47:41.580 --> 01:47:42.590 align:start position:0%
administer collection of taxes is also a
fact

01:47:42.590 --> 01:47:42.600 align:start position:0%
fact
 
01:47:48.050 --> 01:47:48.060 align:start position:0%
a factor into the cost of administering
 
01:47:48.060 --> 01:47:49.970 align:start position:0%
a factor into the cost of administering
generation

01:47:49.970 --> 01:47:49.980 align:start position:0%
generation
 
01:47:52.850 --> 01:47:52.860 align:start position:0%
it says negative factor but
 
01:47:55.010 --> 01:47:55.020 align:start position:0%
I will say one thing about the the
 
01:47:57.830 --> 01:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
tobacco tax is that the tax is collected
 
01:48:00.290 --> 01:48:00.300 align:start position:0%
at the wholesaler level
 
01:48:03.950 --> 01:48:03.960 align:start position:0%
not so that to your point about the cost
 
01:48:07.669 --> 01:48:07.679 align:start position:0%
to administer it if the tax was if it
 
01:48:10.490 --> 01:48:10.500 align:start position:0%
was the retailers that were collecting
 
01:48:11.990 --> 01:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
and remitting the tax that would
 
01:48:14.510 --> 01:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
obviously be the bottom of the period it
 
01:48:16.550 --> 01:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
pyramid and would be a much larger
 
01:48:20.030 --> 01:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
number of taxpayers that we were dealing
 
01:48:22.490 --> 01:48:22.500 align:start position:0%
with so where the taxes really collected
 
01:48:25.250 --> 01:48:25.260 align:start position:0%
and remitted at the wholesale level it's
 
01:48:27.890 --> 01:48:27.900 align:start position:0%
a smaller Universe of of businesses that
 
01:48:29.390 --> 01:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
we're interacting with
 
01:48:32.570 --> 01:48:32.580 align:start position:0%
to your point if that makes sense okay
 
01:48:35.270 --> 01:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
representative liply
 
01:48:36.770 --> 01:48:36.780 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:48:39.709 --> 01:48:39.719 align:start position:0%
I was wondering if and I'm not sure if
 
01:48:41.209 --> 01:48:41.219 align:start position:0%
this is a question for you or for the
 
01:48:43.129 --> 01:48:43.139 align:start position:0%
committee I was wondering if there was a
 
01:48:45.290 --> 01:48:45.300 align:start position:0%
technical reason we don't tax the
 
01:48:47.030 --> 01:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
premium cigars
 
01:48:49.250 --> 01:48:49.260 align:start position:0%
like how did that it's not a technical
 
01:48:51.169 --> 01:48:51.179 align:start position:0%
reason that is a policy decision that
 
01:48:53.030 --> 01:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
this committee has made for many years
 
01:48:54.950 --> 01:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
we have a bill about that I believe
 
01:48:57.470 --> 01:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
coming up so we'll revisit that in
 
01:48:59.149 --> 01:48:59.159 align:start position:0%
Greater detail get the history on that
 
01:49:01.189 --> 01:49:01.199 align:start position:0%
thank you all the questions yes
 
01:49:04.250 --> 01:49:04.260 align:start position:0%
representative fellows yep thank you
 
01:49:07.310 --> 01:49:07.320 align:start position:0%
um do you think that people are buying
 
01:49:09.770 --> 01:49:09.780 align:start position:0%
their tobacco products over the internet
 
01:49:12.890 --> 01:49:12.900 align:start position:0%
and avoiding this tax so the tax would
 
01:49:15.109 --> 01:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
not be avoided over the Internet there
 
01:49:16.970 --> 01:49:16.980 align:start position:0%
is a statutory requirement that if you
 
01:49:18.530 --> 01:49:18.540 align:start position:0%
do purchase
 
01:49:20.450 --> 01:49:20.460 align:start position:0%
um as a consumer you purchase products
 
01:49:22.970 --> 01:49:22.980 align:start position:0%
over the Internet or in some other maybe
 
01:49:25.790 --> 01:49:25.800 align:start position:0%
legal way for which the
 
01:49:28.669 --> 01:49:28.679 align:start position:0%
um tax has not already been collected
 
01:49:30.649 --> 01:49:30.659 align:start position:0%
and remitted on your behalf we do have a
 
01:49:32.270 --> 01:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
form that you would fill out and pay the
 
01:49:35.510 --> 01:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
tax on those products do you are not
 
01:49:37.609 --> 01:49:37.619 align:start position:0%
avoiding the tax by purchasing on the
 
01:49:39.649 --> 01:49:39.659 align:start position:0%
internet you have an obligation to pay
 
01:49:42.169 --> 01:49:42.179 align:start position:0%
that tax
 
01:49:42.179 --> 01:49:49.669 align:start position:0%
that tax
correct

01:49:49.669 --> 01:49:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:52.550 --> 01:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
all right and um so
 
01:49:56.270 --> 01:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
um I guess we can oh so can move on to
 
01:49:57.890 --> 01:49:57.900 align:start position:0%
the next slide
 
01:49:59.689 --> 01:49:59.699 align:start position:0%
all right okay
 
01:50:02.330 --> 01:50:02.340 align:start position:0%
uh tobacco tax and this is a pie chart
 
01:50:04.070 --> 01:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
as uh representative ulery pointed out
 
01:50:07.729 --> 01:50:07.739 align:start position:0%
uh the uh OTP it represents nine percent
 
01:50:10.250 --> 01:50:10.260 align:start position:0%
of the total tobacco tax revenue whereas
 
01:50:12.290 --> 01:50:12.300 align:start position:0%
the bulk of the tobacco tax revenue
 
01:50:14.149 --> 01:50:14.159 align:start position:0%
comes from Tech stamps
 
01:50:17.570 --> 01:50:17.580 align:start position:0%
and moving on to slide 30 this is a
 
01:50:20.330 --> 01:50:20.340 align:start position:0%
tobacco Tech stamp Revenue graph and it
 
01:50:23.870 --> 01:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
shows on a fiscal year basis how much of
 
01:50:25.669 --> 01:50:25.679 align:start position:0%
the tobacco Tax and Revenue is being
 
01:50:29.270 --> 01:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
collected and you see here uh there is
 
01:50:33.169 --> 01:50:33.179 align:start position:0%
Ace fiscal year 19 it's slight dipped
 
01:50:34.669 --> 01:50:34.679 align:start position:0%
there and then slightly going up in
 
01:50:38.209 --> 01:50:38.219 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 20 and fiscated 21 that's it
 
01:50:41.030 --> 01:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
significant increase there and that is
 
01:50:43.430 --> 01:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh potentially could be two reasons one
 
01:50:45.770 --> 01:50:45.780 align:start position:0%
is the debt coincides with the
 
01:50:47.709 --> 01:50:47.719 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts ban on
 
01:50:50.950 --> 01:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
flavored uh flavor tobacco including
 
01:50:55.010 --> 01:50:55.020 align:start position:0%
mentholated cigarettes and with that so
 
01:50:58.129 --> 01:50:58.139 align:start position:0%
since the those kinds of cigarettes are
 
01:50:59.870 --> 01:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
not being cannot be sold in
 
01:51:02.270 --> 01:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts a lot we received the
 
01:51:05.390 --> 01:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
elasticity of the sales a lot of the
 
01:51:08.990 --> 01:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
users are purchasing it here in in New
 
01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:10.010 align:start position:0%
users are purchasing it here in in New
Hampshire

01:51:10.010 --> 01:51:10.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:51:11.629 --> 01:51:11.639 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:51:14.930 --> 01:51:14.940 align:start position:0%
moving on to the next slide slide 31 and
 
01:51:17.750 --> 01:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
this is the OTP Revenue so this sort of
 
01:51:20.750 --> 01:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
puts some kind of um more meat into the
 
01:51:21.830 --> 01:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
question that was asked by
 
01:51:24.350 --> 01:51:24.360 align:start position:0%
representative early you see that the
 
01:51:26.810 --> 01:51:26.820 align:start position:0%
revenue for OTP essentially is actually
 
01:51:31.070 --> 01:51:31.080 align:start position:0%
increasing so uh if if the cost to
 
01:51:33.590 --> 01:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
administer Remains the Same you'll see a
 
01:51:37.070 --> 01:51:37.080 align:start position:0%
higher return to the cost as the EU goes
 
01:51:37.080 --> 01:51:39.950 align:start position:0%
higher return to the cost as the EU goes
by

01:51:39.950 --> 01:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:42.109 --> 01:51:42.119 align:start position:0%
and next moving on to the next slide
 
01:51:46.310 --> 01:51:46.320 align:start position:0%
slide 32 this is a 10-year Revenue Trend
 
01:51:49.729 --> 01:51:49.739 align:start position:0%
with tobacco taxes and once again the uh
 
01:51:52.010 --> 01:51:52.020 align:start position:0%
probably the only significant item to
 
01:51:54.709 --> 01:51:54.719 align:start position:0%
attend to note here is that fiscal year
 
01:51:57.350 --> 01:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
20 that the Massachusetts ban what's
 
01:51:59.570 --> 01:51:59.580 align:start position:0%
happening there showing an upward
 
01:52:02.330 --> 01:52:02.340 align:start position:0%
trajectory of Revenue uh in fiscal year
 
01:52:02.340 --> 01:52:03.649 align:start position:0%
trajectory of Revenue uh in fiscal year
21.

01:52:03.649 --> 01:52:03.659 align:start position:0%
21.
 
01:52:05.629 --> 01:52:05.639 align:start position:0%
and you do see a slight decline from
 
01:52:09.169 --> 01:52:09.179 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21 to fiscal year 22 most
 
01:52:11.930 --> 01:52:11.940 align:start position:0%
likely it's because uh people are being
 
01:52:13.370 --> 01:52:13.380 align:start position:0%
a bit more health conscious at that time
 
01:52:15.530 --> 01:52:15.540 align:start position:0%
and people are sort of coming back to
 
01:52:17.930 --> 01:52:17.940 align:start position:0%
the office to work and so the
 
01:52:19.910 --> 01:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
restrictions in terms of smoking and
 
01:52:22.129 --> 01:52:22.139 align:start position:0%
using tobacco products when when they're
 
01:52:23.510 --> 01:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
at the office versus when they're at
 
01:52:27.470 --> 01:52:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:29.870 --> 01:52:29.880 align:start position:0%
foreign moving on to the next slide
 
01:52:33.290 --> 01:52:33.300 align:start position:0%
slide 33 uh this is just a slight to
 
01:52:38.149 --> 01:52:38.159 align:start position:0%
show the the ranking of uh the the tax
 
01:52:41.330 --> 01:52:41.340 align:start position:0%
rates on the tobacco products and then
 
01:52:44.450 --> 01:52:44.460 align:start position:0%
also the sort of the um the unless the
 
01:52:44.460 --> 01:52:45.729 align:start position:0%
also the sort of the um the unless the
illegal

01:52:45.729 --> 01:52:45.739 align:start position:0%
illegal
 
01:52:47.930 --> 01:52:47.940 align:start position:0%
smuggling of cigarettes and can be
 
01:52:50.390 --> 01:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
consumed in that state and you see that
 
01:52:52.970 --> 01:52:52.980 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire ranks really low in terms
 
01:52:57.470 --> 01:52:57.480 align:start position:0%
of uh Revenue loss from uh uh smuggle
 
01:53:02.810 --> 01:53:02.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:04.790 --> 01:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
representative Valerie so you're
 
01:53:07.490 --> 01:53:07.500 align:start position:0%
referring to cigarette smuggled in to
 
01:53:09.830 --> 01:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire not the truckloads going
 
01:53:11.750 --> 01:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
to New York City that's that's right yes
 
01:53:14.629 --> 01:53:14.639 align:start position:0%
it is in terms of revenue revenue to the
 
01:53:17.629 --> 01:53:17.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:19.609 --> 01:53:19.619 align:start position:0%
I just want to make one last point if I
 
01:53:21.470 --> 01:53:21.480 align:start position:0%
can on the tobacco tax
 
01:53:23.930 --> 01:53:23.940 align:start position:0%
um in the monthly reports that we send
 
01:53:25.189 --> 01:53:25.199 align:start position:0%
to you
 
01:53:27.770 --> 01:53:27.780 align:start position:0%
um you will see one of our reports shows
 
01:53:29.930 --> 01:53:29.940 align:start position:0%
tobacco tax stamp sales so you can see
 
01:53:31.729 --> 01:53:31.739 align:start position:0%
literally the number of stamps that we
 
01:53:33.350 --> 01:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
sell each month and each one of those
 
01:53:35.450 --> 01:53:35.460 align:start position:0%
stamps goes on a bottom bottom of a pack
 
01:53:38.090 --> 01:53:38.100 align:start position:0%
of cigarettes before it's sold you'll
 
01:53:39.709 --> 01:53:39.719 align:start position:0%
also see in the bottom part of that
 
01:53:43.270 --> 01:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
report is the receivable Bond balance
 
01:53:46.070 --> 01:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
when the cigarette or tobacco
 
01:53:48.530 --> 01:53:48.540 align:start position:0%
wholesalers purchase those tobacco tax
 
01:53:50.810 --> 01:53:50.820 align:start position:0%
stamps from us they're able to purchase
 
01:53:53.510 --> 01:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
those on Bond and so they don't need to
 
01:53:55.189 --> 01:53:55.199 align:start position:0%
make a payment at the time of purchase
 
01:53:57.470 --> 01:53:57.480 align:start position:0%
they need to make a payment within 30
 
01:54:00.229 --> 01:54:00.239 align:start position:0%
days so at the end of each month we'll
 
01:54:02.330 --> 01:54:02.340 align:start position:0%
show you how much revenue is kind of
 
01:54:04.970 --> 01:54:04.980 align:start position:0%
outstanding for the next month because
 
01:54:07.430 --> 01:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
it can be a little bit of foreshadowing
 
01:54:09.470 --> 01:54:09.480 align:start position:0%
into the revenue that we'll receive in
 
01:54:11.750 --> 01:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
the subsequent month so that's the kind
 
01:54:12.890 --> 01:54:12.900 align:start position:0%
of the difference what you're seeing at
 
01:54:14.570 --> 01:54:14.580 align:start position:0%
the top is the gross amount of stamps
 
01:54:16.910 --> 01:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
stamps that we sold and at the bottom is
 
01:54:18.530 --> 01:54:18.540 align:start position:0%
okay how much money from those stamp
 
01:54:20.149 --> 01:54:20.159 align:start position:0%
sales are we going to expect to see in
 
01:54:25.310 --> 01:54:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:28.669 --> 01:54:28.679 align:start position:0%
anything else on Tobacco
 
01:54:30.830 --> 01:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
01:54:34.850 --> 01:54:34.860 align:start position:0%
yes premium cigars yes
 
01:54:37.370 --> 01:54:37.380 align:start position:0%
um real estate transfer tax we've
 
01:54:40.490 --> 01:54:40.500 align:start position:0%
um talked about this before this is the
 
01:54:43.129 --> 01:54:43.139 align:start position:0%
tax on the sale granting and transfer of
 
01:54:45.050 --> 01:54:45.060 align:start position:0%
property real property or interest in
 
01:54:47.450 --> 01:54:47.460 align:start position:0%
property it is split between the buyer
 
01:54:50.450 --> 01:54:50.460 align:start position:0%
and the seller each paying 75 cents per
 
01:54:52.550 --> 01:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars
 
01:54:55.189 --> 01:54:55.199 align:start position:0%
um this is the effectuation of this
 
01:54:57.590 --> 01:54:57.600 align:start position:0%
taxes done at the registry of deeds and
 
01:55:00.229 --> 01:55:00.239 align:start position:0%
each County retains four percent as a
 
01:55:00.239 --> 01:55:02.810 align:start position:0%
each County retains four percent as a
commission

01:55:02.810 --> 01:55:02.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:05.510 --> 01:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
um on slide 35 we've talked about this
 
01:55:07.430 --> 01:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
before in terms of how we kind of
 
01:55:10.310 --> 01:55:10.320 align:start position:0%
forecast Rhett revenue and there's
 
01:55:13.189 --> 01:55:13.199 align:start position:0%
really two pieces to it right you need
 
01:55:16.910 --> 01:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
transactions to occur in order to uh
 
01:55:19.609 --> 01:55:19.619 align:start position:0%
receive the revenue but the value of
 
01:55:22.070 --> 01:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
that transaction determines how much
 
01:55:25.250 --> 01:55:25.260 align:start position:0%
revenue we receive so we can go through
 
01:55:27.770 --> 01:55:27.780 align:start position:0%
a period of time where we're seeing a
 
01:55:29.930 --> 01:55:29.940 align:start position:0%
decline in the number of transactions
 
01:55:32.629 --> 01:55:32.639 align:start position:0%
but if the value of those sales is
 
01:55:34.550 --> 01:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
increasing we can actually see ret
 
01:55:38.510 --> 01:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
remain the same or even go up so in
 
01:55:41.870 --> 01:55:41.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal 22 this shows you the average
 
01:55:44.990 --> 01:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
monthly percent of transactions and the
 
01:55:47.750 --> 01:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
average monthly percent of Revenue by
 
01:55:50.090 --> 01:55:50.100 align:start position:0%
County so I would just I'll just
 
01:55:51.649 --> 01:55:51.659 align:start position:0%
highlight two counties if you look at
 
01:55:54.169 --> 01:55:54.179 align:start position:0%
Grafton County on average they're just
 
01:55:55.910 --> 01:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
under 10 percent of the number of
 
01:55:55.920 --> 01:55:58.729 align:start position:0%
under 10 percent of the number of
transactions

01:55:58.729 --> 01:55:58.739 align:start position:0%
transactions
 
01:56:01.790 --> 01:56:01.800 align:start position:0%
but there's seven percent of the tax
 
01:56:04.790 --> 01:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
going down to Rockingham County they're
 
01:56:07.850 --> 01:56:07.860 align:start position:0%
20 percent of their transactions but 28
 
01:56:10.970 --> 01:56:10.980 align:start position:0%
and a half percent of the tax so
 
01:56:13.129 --> 01:56:13.139 align:start position:0%
that's kind of how those two pieces
 
01:56:16.609 --> 01:56:16.619 align:start position:0%
interact with each other so as we move
 
01:56:18.649 --> 01:56:18.659 align:start position:0%
through the next couple of months and
 
01:56:21.830 --> 01:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
maybe year or two where we may see a
 
01:56:25.850 --> 01:56:25.860 align:start position:0%
decline in the number of sales
 
01:56:27.770 --> 01:56:27.780 align:start position:0%
well which we even have been seeing up
 
01:56:29.149 --> 01:56:29.159 align:start position:0%
to this point
 
01:56:31.189 --> 01:56:31.199 align:start position:0%
the impact on Rhett is really going to
 
01:56:34.129 --> 01:56:34.139 align:start position:0%
be based on the value of those sales so
 
01:56:37.189 --> 01:56:37.199 align:start position:0%
we are showing that on slide 36 you can
 
01:56:39.169 --> 01:56:39.179 align:start position:0%
see that we've had a number of good
 
01:56:42.649 --> 01:56:42.659 align:start position:0%
years now significant increase in ret in
 
01:56:46.910 --> 01:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal 21 and fiscal 22.
 
01:56:49.850 --> 01:56:49.860 align:start position:0%
um you may have noticed at least for 22
 
01:56:52.850 --> 01:56:52.860 align:start position:0%
you can see and 21 we're we're above
 
01:56:56.390 --> 01:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal 23 Revenue plan and through
 
01:56:59.450 --> 01:56:59.460 align:start position:0%
December of fiscal 23 we had been
 
01:57:01.910 --> 01:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
significantly above plan you may have
 
01:57:04.209 --> 01:57:04.219 align:start position:0%
noticed in the
 
01:57:07.669 --> 01:57:07.679 align:start position:0%
January revenue Focus the January came
 
01:57:07.679 --> 01:57:08.450 align:start position:0%
January revenue Focus the January came
in

01:57:08.450 --> 01:57:08.460 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:57:12.410 --> 01:57:12.420 align:start position:0%
pretty close to plan so we may be seeing
 
01:57:14.689 --> 01:57:14.699 align:start position:0%
a bit of cool of cooling in the real
 
01:57:17.689 --> 01:57:17.699 align:start position:0%
estate market plan did anticipate that
 
01:57:19.629 --> 01:57:19.639 align:start position:0%
to happen to some extent
 
01:57:22.550 --> 01:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
I will note though that for
 
01:57:26.030 --> 01:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
Revenue received in January which is for
 
01:57:30.229 --> 01:57:30.239 align:start position:0%
December transactions we received 16.2
 
01:57:30.239 --> 01:57:31.430 align:start position:0%
December transactions we received 16.2
million

01:57:31.430 --> 01:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:57:35.030 --> 01:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
this January that's compared to 25.8
 
01:57:38.270 --> 01:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
last January however looking at
 
01:57:41.209 --> 01:57:41.219 align:start position:0%
pre-covered levels the highest we had
 
01:57:44.510 --> 01:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
seen was about 14 million so 16 million
 
01:57:47.810 --> 01:57:47.820 align:start position:0%
is still good Revenue compared to
 
01:57:49.550 --> 01:57:49.560 align:start position:0%
pre-covered levels it's just less than
 
01:57:51.290 --> 01:57:51.300 align:start position:0%
what we've seen over the past two fiscal
 
01:57:54.229 --> 01:57:54.239 align:start position:0%
years representative thank you thank you
 
01:57:56.030 --> 01:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
01:57:58.729 --> 01:57:58.739 align:start position:0%
Um this can be impacted I believe also
 
01:58:00.950 --> 01:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
by some anomalies depending if there's
 
01:58:02.510 --> 01:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
some large sales just wanted to know
 
01:58:05.570 --> 01:58:05.580 align:start position:0%
about that is true so if there are large
 
01:58:08.390 --> 01:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
sales if there's large properties that
 
01:58:11.030 --> 01:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
sell large apartment complexes those
 
01:58:13.370 --> 01:58:13.380 align:start position:0%
sorts of things we do get weekly reports
 
01:58:15.350 --> 01:58:15.360 align:start position:0%
of all real estate transactions within
 
01:58:17.390 --> 01:58:17.400 align:start position:0%
the state and we will monitor for those
 
01:58:19.490 --> 01:58:19.500 align:start position:0%
to make sure we know whether or not what
 
01:58:21.830 --> 01:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
we're seeing is the result of an anomaly
 
01:58:24.649 --> 01:58:24.659 align:start position:0%
or a very large transaction or if it's
 
01:58:26.510 --> 01:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
really just an increase in the Baseline
 
01:58:28.790 --> 01:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
so thank you that's a great point
 
01:58:30.709 --> 01:58:30.719 align:start position:0%
representative Oliver
 
01:58:32.990 --> 01:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
and if I'm correct
 
01:58:35.689 --> 01:58:35.699 align:start position:0%
when you're transferring from a trust a
 
01:58:38.629 --> 01:58:38.639 align:start position:0%
revocable trust there's because there's
 
01:58:41.149 --> 01:58:41.159 align:start position:0%
no cash value involved in that transfer
 
01:58:44.750 --> 01:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
there's no uh rent paid uh to to refi
 
01:58:46.910 --> 01:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
your home that's correct that's correct
 
01:58:49.010 --> 01:58:49.020 align:start position:0%
and so there are a number of exceptions
 
01:58:51.350 --> 01:58:51.360 align:start position:0%
to the red that are listed out in the
 
01:58:51.360 --> 01:58:52.609 align:start position:0%
to the red that are listed out in the
statute

01:58:52.609 --> 01:58:52.619 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:58:53.930 --> 01:58:53.940 align:start position:0%
um and we can certainly dive into that
 
01:58:55.669 --> 01:58:55.679 align:start position:0%
with the committee and a future
 
01:58:58.010 --> 01:58:58.020 align:start position:0%
presentation if you'd like
 
01:58:59.930 --> 01:58:59.940 align:start position:0%
representative Phyllis
 
01:59:03.830 --> 01:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
um do business long-term leases do those
 
01:59:06.830 --> 01:59:06.840 align:start position:0%
are those subject to this tax it's it's
 
01:59:09.770 --> 01:59:09.780 align:start position:0%
when the there is a transfer in either
 
01:59:11.330 --> 01:59:11.340 align:start position:0%
the interest of the property or an
 
01:59:13.010 --> 01:59:13.020 align:start position:0%
actual sale of the property so if it's
 
01:59:14.450 --> 01:59:14.460 align:start position:0%
just a lease then that wouldn't be
 
01:59:18.830 --> 01:59:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:18.840 --> 01:59:22.970 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:59:22.970 --> 01:59:22.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:25.490 --> 01:59:25.500 align:start position:0%
moving on to the next text type is the
 
01:59:28.010 --> 01:59:28.020 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends tax
 
01:59:32.330 --> 01:59:32.340 align:start position:0%
um the right now the the for tax peers
 
01:59:35.270 --> 01:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
ending on or after December 3123 the tax
 
01:59:38.209 --> 01:59:38.219 align:start position:0%
rate is at four percent and with current
 
01:59:41.390 --> 01:59:41.400 align:start position:0%
uh statute that tax rate is going to be
 
01:59:44.089 --> 01:59:44.099 align:start position:0%
decreasing year over year and uh right
 
01:59:46.669 --> 01:59:46.679 align:start position:0%
up to one percent in the tax periods
 
01:59:49.370 --> 01:59:49.380 align:start position:0%
ending December 31 26 and will be repeal
 
01:59:51.830 --> 01:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
effective gen 1 of 27. pardon my
 
01:59:53.450 --> 01:59:53.460 align:start position:0%
Interruption is I just looked at the
 
01:59:56.209 --> 01:59:56.219 align:start position:0%
time and I need to make sure folks get a
 
01:59:58.550 --> 01:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
time for lunch and you have quite a bit
 
02:00:01.010 --> 02:00:01.020 align:start position:0%
of a presentation left
 
02:00:04.490 --> 02:00:04.500 align:start position:0%
may I propose we have you back maybe
 
02:00:07.070 --> 02:00:07.080 align:start position:0%
next Monday for a little bit to continue
 
02:00:09.350 --> 02:00:09.360 align:start position:0%
with this maybe we'll have some of these
 
02:00:12.589 --> 02:00:12.599 align:start position:0%
thoughts and questions formed and we can
 
02:00:14.030 --> 02:00:14.040 align:start position:0%
do a little bit more
 
02:00:15.530 --> 02:00:15.540 align:start position:0%
before we start putting pencil to paper
 
02:00:18.109 --> 02:00:18.119 align:start position:0%
is that are you open to that Chris I
 
02:00:19.729 --> 02:00:19.739 align:start position:0%
don't know if you have any time to maybe
 
02:00:21.770 --> 02:00:21.780 align:start position:0%
see if we can have them back on next
 
02:00:24.350 --> 02:00:24.360 align:start position:0%
Monday the 13th just maybe for an hour
 
02:00:25.910 --> 02:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
and a half or something
 
02:00:27.410 --> 02:00:27.420 align:start position:0%
that way because I don't want to I don't
 
02:00:29.149 --> 02:00:29.159 align:start position:0%
want anyone to feel rushed and we still
 
02:00:30.709 --> 02:00:30.719 align:start position:0%
have a lot of material and you might
 
02:00:32.209 --> 02:00:32.219 align:start position:0%
have more follow-up questions on things
 
02:00:34.070 --> 02:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
we've already covered does that work
 
02:00:34.080 --> 02:00:35.270 align:start position:0%
we've already covered does that work
okay

02:00:35.270 --> 02:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:00:36.890 --> 02:00:36.900 align:start position:0%
and I think that's a good idea because
 
02:00:38.870 --> 02:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
we're not coming in until the week after
 
02:00:40.850 --> 02:00:40.860 align:start position:0%
next to actually start our Revenue
 
02:00:43.250 --> 02:00:43.260 align:start position:0%
estimate right so we've got next week to
 
02:00:45.109 --> 02:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
to do that so that's totally fine that
 
02:00:46.609 --> 02:00:46.619 align:start position:0%
would be great yeah we know what we all
 
02:00:49.430 --> 02:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
we lost a big day with that snow day so
 
02:00:51.350 --> 02:00:51.360 align:start position:0%
now we're playing catch-up and we have a
 
02:00:52.910 --> 02:00:52.920 align:start position:0%
lot of folks that are kind of new to
 
02:00:55.430 --> 02:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
these topics so you know there's no need
 
02:00:57.290 --> 02:00:57.300 align:start position:0%
to rush through this great presentation
 
02:00:58.910 --> 02:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
and you know I think having you come
 
02:01:00.709 --> 02:01:00.719 align:start position:0%
back we'll have some even more refined
 
02:01:02.870 --> 02:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
questions for you so that would be great
 
02:01:05.089 --> 02:01:05.099 align:start position:0%
thank you so much so we'll see you next
 
02:01:07.609 --> 02:01:07.619 align:start position:0%
week okay great awesome so we'll break
 
02:01:08.870 --> 02:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
for lunch
 
02:01:10.430 --> 02:01:10.440 align:start position:0%
um and just heads up we do have another
 
02:01:12.470 --> 02:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
four or five bills that we need to take
 
02:01:14.510 --> 02:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
up in terms of hearings so I'm looking
 
02:01:17.330 --> 02:01:17.340 align:start position:0%
at next Wednesday which I believe is the
 
02:01:20.629 --> 02:01:20.639 align:start position:0%
15th so on Tuesday so Monday we're going
 
02:01:22.370 --> 02:01:22.380 align:start position:0%
to have a presentation and maybe any
 
02:01:24.530 --> 02:01:24.540 align:start position:0%
other follow-up presentations Tuesday
 
02:01:26.750 --> 02:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
we'll have house session and then the
 
02:01:29.149 --> 02:01:29.159 align:start position:0%
governor's budget address then Wednesday
 
02:01:31.010 --> 02:01:31.020 align:start position:0%
we'll take up the remaining bills that
 
02:01:33.109 --> 02:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
we haven't had hearings on and some of
 
02:01:34.790 --> 02:01:34.800 align:start position:0%
those bills will deal with some of these
 
02:01:36.709 --> 02:01:36.719 align:start position:0%
tax policies policies we're hearing now
 
02:01:39.890 --> 02:01:39.900 align:start position:0%
so for example tobacco tax so dra will
 
02:01:41.990 --> 02:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
be here to help us drill down at that
 
02:01:45.050 --> 02:01:45.060 align:start position:0%
time as well right okay and then the
 
02:01:46.490 --> 02:01:46.500 align:start position:0%
following week that's when we're
 
02:01:48.830 --> 02:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
starting to drill down on the revenue
 
02:01:50.810 --> 02:01:50.820 align:start position:0%
estimates and there will be some as we
 
02:01:52.250 --> 02:01:52.260 align:start position:0%
notice from the Department of Justice
 
02:01:55.669 --> 02:01:55.679 align:start position:0%
today on that tobacco suit we probably
 
02:01:57.589 --> 02:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
don't need him to come back we have all
 
02:01:59.629 --> 02:01:59.639 align:start position:0%
the information he can give us so we'll
 
02:02:02.689 --> 02:02:02.699 align:start position:0%
spend more time the valuable time with
 
02:02:04.609 --> 02:02:04.619 align:start position:0%
these fine folks because this is where
 
02:02:06.890 --> 02:02:06.900 align:start position:0%
the bulk of the revenue is
 
02:02:09.950 --> 02:02:09.960 align:start position:0%
makes sense okay great let's break and
 
02:02:11.570 --> 02:02:11.580 align:start position:0%
we'll see you back here at one thank you
 
03:01:10.730 --> 03:01:10.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:10.740 --> 03:01:12.849 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:01:12.849 --> 03:01:12.859 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
03:01:15.889 --> 03:01:15.899 align:start position:0%
the uh the time being just past one
 
03:01:15.899 --> 03:01:17.090 align:start position:0%
the uh the time being just past one
o'clock

03:01:17.090 --> 03:01:17.100 align:start position:0%
o'clock
 
03:01:18.530 --> 03:01:18.540 align:start position:0%
um we're gonna get started with the
 
03:01:20.710 --> 03:01:20.720 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative services
 
03:01:24.410 --> 03:01:24.420 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to welcome them up
 
03:01:24.420 --> 03:01:34.969 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to welcome them up
foreign

03:01:34.969 --> 03:01:34.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:36.830 --> 03:01:36.840 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I'm Dana call I'm the
 
03:01:39.110 --> 03:01:39.120 align:start position:0%
State Comptroller and uh normally I'd
 
03:01:40.670 --> 03:01:40.680 align:start position:0%
have commissioner Charlie arlinghaus
 
03:01:43.010 --> 03:01:43.020 align:start position:0%
with me today but he had to get pulled
 
03:01:45.410 --> 03:01:45.420 align:start position:0%
into another meeting so it'll just be me
 
03:01:45.420 --> 03:01:46.610 align:start position:0%
into another meeting so it'll just be me
today

03:01:46.610 --> 03:01:46.620 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:01:49.250 --> 03:01:49.260 align:start position:0%
um I am the director of the division of
 
03:01:51.469 --> 03:01:51.479 align:start position:0%
accounting services which is part of
 
03:01:54.050 --> 03:01:54.060 align:start position:0%
administrative services so
 
03:01:56.330 --> 03:01:56.340 align:start position:0%
I think you have my presentation so I'll
 
03:02:03.590 --> 03:02:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:06.230 --> 03:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
so I was asked to present essentially
 
03:02:09.950 --> 03:02:09.960 align:start position:0%
the category of other Revenue today as
 
03:02:12.530 --> 03:02:12.540 align:start position:0%
well as talk a little bit about what Das
 
03:02:15.790 --> 03:02:15.800 align:start position:0%
does in terms of Revenue reporting
 
03:02:19.910 --> 03:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
so on page two a little oversight a
 
03:02:23.630 --> 03:02:23.640 align:start position:0%
little overview of admin services in our
 
03:02:27.429 --> 03:02:27.439 align:start position:0%
Central oversight role over all things
 
03:02:30.230 --> 03:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
accounting and again as I mentioned
 
03:02:32.389 --> 03:02:32.399 align:start position:0%
division of accounting services handles
 
03:02:34.550 --> 03:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
all Statewide accounting requirements
 
03:02:36.889 --> 03:02:36.899 align:start position:0%
including the state akfer which is the
 
03:02:40.010 --> 03:02:40.020 align:start position:0%
annual comprehensive financial report
 
03:02:43.070 --> 03:02:43.080 align:start position:0%
um so that is the largest of our list of
 
03:02:45.410 --> 03:02:45.420 align:start position:0%
items but I also provided you a
 
03:02:47.750 --> 03:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
reference to some of the other external
 
03:02:49.849 --> 03:02:49.859 align:start position:0%
Financial reports that we prepare
 
03:02:51.590 --> 03:02:51.600 align:start position:0%
throughout the course of the year
 
03:02:53.929 --> 03:02:53.939 align:start position:0%
regarding unrestricted revenue on page
 
03:02:53.939 --> 03:02:55.610 align:start position:0%
regarding unrestricted revenue on page
three

03:02:55.610 --> 03:02:55.620 align:start position:0%
three
 
03:02:57.590 --> 03:02:57.600 align:start position:0%
most of you might be familiar with the
 
03:02:59.929 --> 03:02:59.939 align:start position:0%
monthly Revenue Focus that's an
 
03:03:02.150 --> 03:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
unaudited interim financial statement
 
03:03:04.010 --> 03:03:04.020 align:start position:0%
that we put out just to cut and give a
 
03:03:05.630 --> 03:03:05.640 align:start position:0%
sense of where we're at during the
 
03:03:07.309 --> 03:03:07.319 align:start position:0%
course of the fiscal year with
 
03:03:09.769 --> 03:03:09.779 align:start position:0%
unrestricted revenues
 
03:03:12.110 --> 03:03:12.120 align:start position:0%
um that report is based on an annual
 
03:03:13.790 --> 03:03:13.800 align:start position:0%
revenue plan that we prepare at the
 
03:03:16.010 --> 03:03:16.020 align:start position:0%
beginning of the fiscal year based on
 
03:03:18.650 --> 03:03:18.660 align:start position:0%
the state budget that gets enacted the
 
03:03:20.990 --> 03:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
state budget provides an annual plan and
 
03:03:23.450 --> 03:03:23.460 align:start position:0%
then we work with each agency that
 
03:03:26.750 --> 03:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
collects the revenue to establish what
 
03:03:28.849 --> 03:03:28.859 align:start position:0%
month they think that Revenue might
 
03:03:30.950 --> 03:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
likely come in I know you heard a
 
03:03:33.230 --> 03:03:33.240 align:start position:0%
detailed presentation for most of the
 
03:03:35.389 --> 03:03:35.399 align:start position:0%
other agencies including Department of
 
03:03:38.809 --> 03:03:38.819 align:start position:0%
Revenue theirs is the most the largest
 
03:03:40.610 --> 03:03:40.620 align:start position:0%
portion and the most important in terms
 
03:03:43.190 --> 03:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
of timing because they can anticipate
 
03:03:45.650 --> 03:03:45.660 align:start position:0%
what month they expect the bulk of their
 
03:03:48.050 --> 03:03:48.060 align:start position:0%
revenues to come in to some degree
 
03:03:51.110 --> 03:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
so the focus just gives you a an actual
 
03:03:53.870 --> 03:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
versus uh plan and then if there are
 
03:03:55.790 --> 03:03:55.800 align:start position:0%
other items that come about through
 
03:03:58.190 --> 03:03:58.200 align:start position:0%
other legislation outside of the enacted
 
03:04:00.530 --> 03:04:00.540 align:start position:0%
budget those don't affect the actual
 
03:04:02.750 --> 03:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
Revenue plan we might footnote those
 
03:04:06.110 --> 03:04:06.120 align:start position:0%
because it will affect actuals but the
 
03:04:07.969 --> 03:04:07.979 align:start position:0%
revenue plan that's presented in the
 
03:04:10.429 --> 03:04:10.439 align:start position:0%
focus is just the budget that gets
 
03:04:13.550 --> 03:04:13.560 align:start position:0%
established once every two years
 
03:04:16.389 --> 03:04:16.399 align:start position:0%
so turning to page four
 
03:04:18.650 --> 03:04:18.660 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
03:04:20.090 --> 03:04:20.100 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
03:04:22.670 --> 03:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
just a little sense of the timing
 
03:04:25.670 --> 03:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
beginning with this July 1st when we
 
03:04:29.450 --> 03:04:29.460 align:start position:0%
have a approved enacted budget
 
03:04:33.230 --> 03:04:33.240 align:start position:0%
then the next week we'll be issuing our
 
03:04:36.290 --> 03:04:36.300 align:start position:0%
cash basis Focus for the last month the
 
03:04:37.790 --> 03:04:37.800 align:start position:0%
last of the the end of the previous
 
03:04:42.170 --> 03:04:42.180 align:start position:0%
fiscal year which was June and then in
 
03:04:44.750 --> 03:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
July we also give a preliminary cool
 
03:04:46.790 --> 03:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
Focus so you get two focuses that month
 
03:04:50.090 --> 03:04:50.100 align:start position:0%
that tells you sort of how things look
 
03:04:52.550 --> 03:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of taking into account timing
 
03:04:54.830 --> 03:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
adjustments and things that will
 
03:04:56.990 --> 03:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
ultimately affect the audited financial
 
03:04:57.000 --> 03:04:58.250 align:start position:0%
ultimately affect the audited financial
statements

03:04:58.250 --> 03:04:58.260 align:start position:0%
statements
 
03:05:00.590 --> 03:05:00.600 align:start position:0%
and then in July we also as I mentioned
 
03:05:02.389 --> 03:05:02.399 align:start position:0%
prepare the annual revenue plan
 
03:05:04.730 --> 03:05:04.740 align:start position:0%
allocating it on a monthly basis going
 
03:05:07.550 --> 03:05:07.560 align:start position:0%
forward for the ensuing year
 
03:05:10.790 --> 03:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
in August you can expect to see a cash
 
03:05:14.450 --> 03:05:14.460 align:start position:0%
basis fisc revenue report for the first
 
03:05:17.950 --> 03:05:17.960 align:start position:0%
July of the new fiscal year as well as
 
03:05:21.950 --> 03:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
we release again the annual plan so in
 
03:05:23.750 --> 03:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
each month you'll get a focus and if
 
03:05:25.130 --> 03:05:25.140 align:start position:0%
you're on that if you want to be added
 
03:05:26.809 --> 03:05:26.819 align:start position:0%
to that distribution list we have
 
03:05:28.550 --> 03:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
contact information through our office
 
03:05:31.969 --> 03:05:31.979 align:start position:0%
we also posted on the Das website so
 
03:05:33.410 --> 03:05:33.420 align:start position:0%
that's it's always going to be there as
 
03:05:35.630 --> 03:05:35.640 align:start position:0%
soon as it goes out and we try to get
 
03:05:37.670 --> 03:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
those out fairly timely obviously
 
03:05:40.790 --> 03:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
because it is cash basis so we
 
03:05:42.769 --> 03:05:42.779 align:start position:0%
essentially know where we end the month
 
03:05:44.450 --> 03:05:44.460 align:start position:0%
but we have to do some month-end closing
 
03:05:46.130 --> 03:05:46.140 align:start position:0%
procedures and then we and then we send
 
03:05:49.790 --> 03:05:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:52.269 --> 03:05:52.279 align:start position:0%
any questions on the focus the process
 
03:05:56.150 --> 03:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
I'll move on to page five these are some
 
03:05:59.150 --> 03:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
of the more significant areas within
 
03:06:02.030 --> 03:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
other so again others are miscellaneous
 
03:06:04.670 --> 03:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
category uh in so if you think of the
 
03:06:07.250 --> 03:06:07.260 align:start position:0%
focus and towards the end of the list of
 
03:06:09.050 --> 03:06:09.060 align:start position:0%
all the business taxes and everything
 
03:06:12.830 --> 03:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
else kind of lands in other so I'll give
 
03:06:14.570 --> 03:06:14.580 align:start position:0%
you a little page six if you want to
 
03:06:16.969 --> 03:06:16.979 align:start position:0%
turn to the actual numbers
 
03:06:22.429 --> 03:06:22.439 align:start position:0%
is a history of other and it's not a
 
03:06:25.490 --> 03:06:25.500 align:start position:0%
line item that's easy to budget for
 
03:06:28.269 --> 03:06:28.279 align:start position:0%
because it's variable in nature
 
03:06:31.190 --> 03:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
much of the things that sometimes there
 
03:06:33.410 --> 03:06:33.420 align:start position:0%
can be one-time items that end up in
 
03:06:35.630 --> 03:06:35.640 align:start position:0%
other and again it's it's anything that
 
03:06:38.090 --> 03:06:38.100 align:start position:0%
comes in that's unrestricted so
 
03:06:41.530 --> 03:06:41.540 align:start position:0%
available to support general fund spend
 
03:06:43.730 --> 03:06:43.740 align:start position:0%
General and education I should say
 
03:06:47.330 --> 03:06:47.340 align:start position:0%
combined but this is uh
 
03:06:49.790 --> 03:06:49.800 align:start position:0%
some of the items again the first line
 
03:06:52.130 --> 03:06:52.140 align:start position:0%
I'll get into in on the next page that's
 
03:06:53.990 --> 03:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
really the the miscellaneous but some of
 
03:06:56.630 --> 03:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
the items are larger and we can sort of
 
03:06:59.330 --> 03:06:59.340 align:start position:0%
um plan for based on looking at several
 
03:07:02.690 --> 03:07:02.700 align:start position:0%
years worth of activity so we have um
 
03:07:04.910 --> 03:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
both reimbursement for indirect costs
 
03:07:07.550 --> 03:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
which is also referred to as swycap and
 
03:07:10.070 --> 03:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
post retirement benefits recovery these
 
03:07:13.250 --> 03:07:13.260 align:start position:0%
are items that support uh we recover
 
03:07:16.309 --> 03:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
from federal and other sources to
 
03:07:18.050 --> 03:07:18.060 align:start position:0%
support activities that are generally
 
03:07:19.929 --> 03:07:19.939 align:start position:0%
funded so for instance my office
 
03:07:22.429 --> 03:07:22.439 align:start position:0%
accounting services is a centralized
 
03:07:26.330 --> 03:07:26.340 align:start position:0%
office supports the entire state but any
 
03:07:28.550 --> 03:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
there are there are federal rules that
 
03:07:31.070 --> 03:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
allow us to recover some of those costs
 
03:07:33.590 --> 03:07:33.600 align:start position:0%
from Federal grant grants and other
 
03:07:36.410 --> 03:07:36.420 align:start position:0%
Revenue sources so what that does is we
 
03:07:38.630 --> 03:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
prepare we have a whole calculation we
 
03:07:41.030 --> 03:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
prepare rate agencies we will Bill
 
03:07:42.950 --> 03:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
agencies they'll pay us on those funds
 
03:07:45.830 --> 03:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
and that gets collected in unrestricted
 
03:07:48.170 --> 03:07:48.180 align:start position:0%
other so it's based basically to the
 
03:07:50.570 --> 03:07:50.580 align:start position:0%
bottom line support of general education
 
03:07:52.670 --> 03:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
fund spending
 
03:07:54.769 --> 03:07:54.779 align:start position:0%
those are two of the larger line items
 
03:07:56.590 --> 03:07:56.600 align:start position:0%
and then I know
 
03:07:59.450 --> 03:07:59.460 align:start position:0%
Treasurer that the Treasury office will
 
03:08:02.090 --> 03:08:02.100 align:start position:0%
will talk to you after me about
 
03:08:04.070 --> 03:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
abandoned property and interest on
 
03:08:05.510 --> 03:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
surplus funds so those are just
 
03:08:07.010 --> 03:08:07.020 align:start position:0%
highlighted so you can kind of see the
 
03:08:08.929 --> 03:08:08.939 align:start position:0%
trend analysis but you'll get more
 
03:08:11.290 --> 03:08:11.300 align:start position:0%
information from the treasurer on that
 
03:08:13.610 --> 03:08:13.620 align:start position:0%
and then if you want to switch to pay
 
03:08:16.550 --> 03:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
turn to page seven this is a little bit
 
03:08:19.269 --> 03:08:19.279 align:start position:0%
more detail on that miscellaneous other
 
03:08:22.190 --> 03:08:22.200 align:start position:0%
again these are line items that are
 
03:08:24.230 --> 03:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
collected at the other agencies so some
 
03:08:26.269 --> 03:08:26.279 align:start position:0%
of these agencies are presenting to you
 
03:08:29.150 --> 03:08:29.160 align:start position:0%
separately if they have a an item that's
 
03:08:32.690 --> 03:08:32.700 align:start position:0%
large enough for us to track we we do
 
03:08:34.010 --> 03:08:34.020 align:start position:0%
have a
 
03:08:36.710 --> 03:08:36.720 align:start position:0%
various items that the top section that
 
03:08:39.110 --> 03:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
we've tracked over the years if you look
 
03:08:42.950 --> 03:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
at line 25 all other that's basically
 
03:08:44.990 --> 03:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
everything else that's considered not
 
03:08:48.170 --> 03:08:48.180 align:start position:0%
tracked it's not predictable it comes in
 
03:08:51.950 --> 03:08:51.960 align:start position:0%
at different levels so that is about a
 
03:08:54.469 --> 03:08:54.479 align:start position:0%
hundred other individual Revenue sources
 
03:08:56.510 --> 03:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
and I've given you detail on that at the
 
03:08:59.450 --> 03:08:59.460 align:start position:0%
end of the presentation so we have again
 
03:09:01.190 --> 03:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
these line items you'll see if you've
 
03:09:02.630 --> 03:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
been on this committee before this
 
03:09:04.610 --> 03:09:04.620 align:start position:0%
format should look familiar to you and
 
03:09:06.349 --> 03:09:06.359 align:start position:0%
you'll see that we track these items
 
03:09:10.610 --> 03:09:10.620 align:start position:0%
year over year as compared to plan
 
03:09:13.370 --> 03:09:13.380 align:start position:0%
and then really again like other than
 
03:09:15.530 --> 03:09:15.540 align:start position:0%
the highlighted ones that you're hearing
 
03:09:18.830 --> 03:09:18.840 align:start position:0%
uh from the other agencies about how to
 
03:09:21.050 --> 03:09:21.060 align:start position:0%
predict most of these items are
 
03:09:21.060 --> 03:09:23.990 align:start position:0%
predict most of these items are
unpredictable

03:09:23.990 --> 03:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
unpredictable
 
03:09:29.389 --> 03:09:29.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:31.670 --> 03:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
I'll stay on page seven we do have a
 
03:09:34.849 --> 03:09:34.859 align:start position:0%
question representative Ames yeah
 
03:09:34.859 --> 03:09:35.750 align:start position:0%
question representative Ames yeah
um

03:09:35.750 --> 03:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:38.750 --> 03:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
so on page six sure
 
03:09:38.760 --> 03:09:40.010 align:start position:0%
so on page six sure
um

03:09:40.010 --> 03:09:40.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:43.010 --> 03:09:43.020 align:start position:0%
just wondering uh there's a spike and
 
03:09:45.830 --> 03:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
then indirect cost reimbursement and FY
 
03:09:45.840 --> 03:09:47.150 align:start position:0%
then indirect cost reimbursement and FY
22

03:09:47.150 --> 03:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
22
 
03:09:49.309 --> 03:09:49.319 align:start position:0%
at least in the five years or so that
 
03:09:50.929 --> 03:09:50.939 align:start position:0%
are covered here that's
 
03:09:52.730 --> 03:09:52.740 align:start position:0%
pretty significant
 
03:09:55.370 --> 03:09:55.380 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:09:57.410 --> 03:09:57.420 align:start position:0%
and then also in the miscellaneous other
 
03:09:59.030 --> 03:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
Revenue says was there anything special
 
03:10:01.929 --> 03:10:01.939 align:start position:0%
I'm looking for special stuff you know
 
03:10:04.490 --> 03:10:04.500 align:start position:0%
not particularly
 
03:10:07.309 --> 03:10:07.319 align:start position:0%
um the the calculation for both indirect
 
03:10:09.950 --> 03:10:09.960 align:start position:0%
costs and post retirement is on a bit of
 
03:10:13.510 --> 03:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
a lag schedule so we we have to use
 
03:10:17.150 --> 03:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
prior year data to submit to the federal
 
03:10:19.670 --> 03:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
government what a future rate is going
 
03:10:21.650 --> 03:10:21.660 align:start position:0%
to look like and get that rate approved
 
03:10:23.870 --> 03:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
so that we can Bill agencies and it can
 
03:10:26.510 --> 03:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
be built into the enacted budget so some
 
03:10:30.110 --> 03:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
of it is timing some agencies have might
 
03:10:32.630 --> 03:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
have something that affects the
 
03:10:35.030 --> 03:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
collectibility so it might shift in
 
03:10:38.929 --> 03:10:38.939 align:start position:0%
fiscal years so maybe we might have over
 
03:10:40.790 --> 03:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
the years sometimes we adjust how we
 
03:10:43.070 --> 03:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
bill to make it a little bit more
 
03:10:46.070 --> 03:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
manageable for agencies so nothing in
 
03:10:48.650 --> 03:10:48.660 align:start position:0%
particular comes to mind in in FY 22
 
03:10:51.230 --> 03:10:51.240 align:start position:0%
other than we do have
 
03:10:53.929 --> 03:10:53.939 align:start position:0%
um again there's some lag in in the rate
 
03:10:56.510 --> 03:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
that gets calculated and there's a piece
 
03:10:57.710 --> 03:10:57.720 align:start position:0%
of it that's called a roll forward
 
03:11:00.170 --> 03:11:00.180 align:start position:0%
adjustment that sort of um
 
03:11:02.690 --> 03:11:02.700 align:start position:0%
will affect a future year but we we've
 
03:11:06.349 --> 03:11:06.359 align:start position:0%
been trying budgetarily to look at it
 
03:11:08.330 --> 03:11:08.340 align:start position:0%
over a longer term and smooth that
 
03:11:11.510 --> 03:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
budget rate so that when the agency gets
 
03:11:13.370 --> 03:11:13.380 align:start position:0%
their rate that we that admin Services
 
03:11:15.170 --> 03:11:15.180 align:start position:0%
tells them to budget that it we don't
 
03:11:17.870 --> 03:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
have these Peaks and valleys so we've
 
03:11:19.730 --> 03:11:19.740 align:start position:0%
been working towards smoothing that but
 
03:11:20.630 --> 03:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
I don't think there was anything
 
03:11:22.670 --> 03:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
specific regarding that year
 
03:11:24.950 --> 03:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome any other
 
03:11:27.170 --> 03:11:27.180 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
03:11:29.870 --> 03:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:11:32.929 --> 03:11:32.939 align:start position:0%
um I have two questions is post
 
03:11:35.570 --> 03:11:35.580 align:start position:0%
retirement benefit recovery is that
 
03:11:38.690 --> 03:11:38.700 align:start position:0%
mostly related to health insurance and
 
03:11:41.389 --> 03:11:41.399 align:start position:0%
my second question is abandoned property
 
03:11:44.090 --> 03:11:44.100 align:start position:0%
is 18 million dollars but is that what
 
03:11:46.910 --> 03:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
you show as having available but but
 
03:11:49.849 --> 03:11:49.859 align:start position:0%
people make claims on it so we the state
 
03:11:51.349 --> 03:11:51.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't really end up with that much
 
03:11:51.359 --> 03:11:52.490 align:start position:0%
doesn't really end up with that much
money

03:11:52.490 --> 03:11:52.500 align:start position:0%
money
 
03:11:54.050 --> 03:11:54.060 align:start position:0%
so I'm gonna let the treasurer take the
 
03:11:56.150 --> 03:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
second question because she's much
 
03:11:58.370 --> 03:11:58.380 align:start position:0%
better at explaining that than I am
 
03:12:00.469 --> 03:12:00.479 align:start position:0%
um the post-retirement recovery is
 
03:12:02.809 --> 03:12:02.819 align:start position:0%
similar it's it's not Health it's
 
03:12:06.830 --> 03:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
retirement costs and essentially we have
 
03:12:08.809 --> 03:12:08.819 align:start position:0%
a pool of employees obviously that are
 
03:12:11.510 --> 03:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
eligible for State retirement and much
 
03:12:14.269 --> 03:12:14.279 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry it's retired it it's retiree
 
03:12:17.269 --> 03:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
Health but it's specific to retirees so
 
03:12:19.370 --> 03:12:19.380 align:start position:0%
not the active employees but retiree
 
03:12:21.889 --> 03:12:21.899 align:start position:0%
Health costs that get funded in the
 
03:12:25.389 --> 03:12:25.399 align:start position:0%
general in the admin Services budget so
 
03:12:28.190 --> 03:12:28.200 align:start position:0%
much of that if it's not direct it's a
 
03:12:29.269 --> 03:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
little complicated much of it if it's
 
03:12:32.450 --> 03:12:32.460 align:start position:0%
not direct build we have a line item in
 
03:12:34.429 --> 03:12:34.439 align:start position:0%
administrative services for retiree
 
03:12:36.710 --> 03:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
Health costs and what we're doing is
 
03:12:39.349 --> 03:12:39.359 align:start position:0%
we're recovering a portion of that from
 
03:12:42.590 --> 03:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
where the person spent their time our
 
03:12:44.690 --> 03:12:44.700 align:start position:0%
best estimate at how they spent their
 
03:12:46.370 --> 03:12:46.380 align:start position:0%
time and if they were federally funded
 
03:12:47.870 --> 03:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
during their course of their time
 
03:12:50.389 --> 03:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
working here we can recover a portion of
 
03:12:53.150 --> 03:12:53.160 align:start position:0%
that cost from those Federal Grant so it
 
03:12:55.790 --> 03:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
works similarly to the Statewide cost
 
03:12:57.410 --> 03:12:57.420 align:start position:0%
allocation plan which is the indirect
 
03:13:00.170 --> 03:13:00.180 align:start position:0%
cost recovery this is a specific cost
 
03:13:02.870 --> 03:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
recovery relating to retiree Health but
 
03:13:05.870 --> 03:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
retiree health is budgeted the bulk of
 
03:13:07.610 --> 03:13:07.620 align:start position:0%
it in admin services in a generally
 
03:13:10.070 --> 03:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
funded accounting unit so we're trying
 
03:13:12.230 --> 03:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
to recover non-general funds to support
 
03:13:14.870 --> 03:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
that future cost
 
03:13:17.510 --> 03:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
so if if you do want there's a little
 
03:13:19.309 --> 03:13:19.319 align:start position:0%
bit more information on both of those
 
03:13:20.990 --> 03:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
because I know I really just glossed
 
03:13:23.210 --> 03:13:23.220 align:start position:0%
over those two line items but page eight
 
03:13:26.690 --> 03:13:26.700 align:start position:0%
and page nine is a little narrative
 
03:13:30.050 --> 03:13:30.060 align:start position:0%
explanation as to the nature of those
 
03:13:35.090 --> 03:13:35.100 align:start position:0%
line items again not particularly we're
 
03:13:37.429 --> 03:13:37.439 align:start position:0%
trying to smooth out those costs best we
 
03:13:40.550 --> 03:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
can so there's not a a large variability
 
03:13:43.550 --> 03:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
year over year but that's the basis
 
03:13:45.410 --> 03:13:45.420 align:start position:0%
these these two line items have been
 
03:13:48.889 --> 03:13:48.899 align:start position:0%
around for a very long time so
 
03:13:48.899 --> 03:13:50.210 align:start position:0%
around for a very long time so
um

03:13:50.210 --> 03:13:50.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:13:52.370 --> 03:13:52.380 align:start position:0%
that's why we sort of highlight them in
 
03:13:54.650 --> 03:13:54.660 align:start position:0%
this other presentation because they are
 
03:13:58.809 --> 03:13:58.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:01.550 --> 03:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
represent Rochford
 
03:14:03.469 --> 03:14:03.479 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair
 
03:14:07.250 --> 03:14:07.260 align:start position:0%
um thank you page seven I I going back
 
03:14:08.450 --> 03:14:08.460 align:start position:0%
to that just want to make sure I'm
 
03:14:10.309 --> 03:14:10.319 align:start position:0%
reading that right looking at fiscal
 
03:14:13.910 --> 03:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
year 22 just like uh
 
03:14:16.610 --> 03:14:16.620 align:start position:0%
lines seven and eight corporate records
 
03:14:19.550 --> 03:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
fees and Corporate filing fees it looks
 
03:14:22.309 --> 03:14:22.319 align:start position:0%
like there was a dip in Revenue there
 
03:14:24.950 --> 03:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
based on what was planned is that am I
 
03:14:26.990 --> 03:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
reading that correctly
 
03:14:29.210 --> 03:14:29.220 align:start position:0%
yeah when you're excuse yes you're
 
03:14:31.969 --> 03:14:31.979 align:start position:0%
looking at actual versus plan for fy22
 
03:14:36.530 --> 03:14:36.540 align:start position:0%
small yeah so so what what is what is
 
03:14:38.389 --> 03:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
encompassed into those fees or is that
 
03:14:39.889 --> 03:14:39.899 align:start position:0%
something that's in
 
03:14:41.269 --> 03:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
because what is Encompass under those
 
03:14:44.630 --> 03:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
fees uh it's I think that so any of
 
03:14:45.769 --> 03:14:45.779 align:start position:0%
these fees
 
03:14:47.809 --> 03:14:47.819 align:start position:0%
um again where I give you the agency
 
03:14:50.630 --> 03:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
that collects that fee they would be
 
03:14:53.210 --> 03:14:53.220 align:start position:0%
best to answer specifically what may
 
03:14:54.950 --> 03:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
have occurred in that year and I know
 
03:14:56.990 --> 03:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
many of them are coming before this
 
03:14:59.150 --> 03:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
group in separate presentations I'm not
 
03:15:00.830 --> 03:15:00.840 align:start position:0%
sure about secretary of state that one
 
03:15:02.389 --> 03:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
example but
 
03:15:04.490 --> 03:15:04.500 align:start position:0%
um I know department of safety insurance
 
03:15:07.610 --> 03:15:07.620 align:start position:0%
labor like they're all they can explain
 
03:15:11.030 --> 03:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
the nature of those exact fees that
 
03:15:15.110 --> 03:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
particular swing is not not huge so it
 
03:15:17.809 --> 03:15:17.819 align:start position:0%
could just be a timing aspect again
 
03:15:19.910 --> 03:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
there's a budget and then there's
 
03:15:21.710 --> 03:15:21.720 align:start position:0%
billing and collecting that occurs and
 
03:15:24.050 --> 03:15:24.060 align:start position:0%
some sometimes things can be affected by
 
03:15:26.650 --> 03:15:26.660 align:start position:0%
timing but that one in particular
 
03:15:30.110 --> 03:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem like a huge swing not
 
03:15:31.730 --> 03:15:31.740 align:start position:0%
compared to some of the swings we were
 
03:15:33.410 --> 03:15:33.420 align:start position:0%
talking about with with indirect cost
 
03:15:34.969 --> 03:15:34.979 align:start position:0%
recoveries but
 
03:15:37.010 --> 03:15:37.020 align:start position:0%
um but yeah they they would I I couldn't
 
03:15:39.290 --> 03:15:39.300 align:start position:0%
speak to exactly what what occurred in
 
03:15:41.570 --> 03:15:41.580 align:start position:0%
fiscal 22 for that particular line item
 
03:15:44.870 --> 03:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
but that is why if you do have follow-up
 
03:15:47.210 --> 03:15:47.220 align:start position:0%
questions I know crochet can get you to
 
03:15:49.370 --> 03:15:49.380 align:start position:0%
the contact people at these particular
 
03:15:52.190 --> 03:15:52.200 align:start position:0%
agencies and that way they can tell you
 
03:15:54.830 --> 03:15:54.840 align:start position:0%
specifically because again we we report
 
03:15:57.050 --> 03:15:57.060 align:start position:0%
on it but we don't collect it thank you
 
03:15:59.990 --> 03:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:01.790 --> 03:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
say no other question I have one quick
 
03:16:01.800 --> 03:16:02.690 align:start position:0%
say no other question I have one quick
question

03:16:02.690 --> 03:16:02.700 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:16:04.490 --> 03:16:04.500 align:start position:0%
um what is the minimum
 
03:16:06.830 --> 03:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
number that it needs to be to track it
 
03:16:09.110 --> 03:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
you said in other if it's you know it's
 
03:16:11.090 --> 03:16:11.100 align:start position:0%
got to be above a certain threshold uh
 
03:16:12.650 --> 03:16:12.660 align:start position:0%
it's that's a good question
 
03:16:14.690 --> 03:16:14.700 align:start position:0%
um I don't think we've set a minimum
 
03:16:16.969 --> 03:16:16.979 align:start position:0%
number but we've just again with these
 
03:16:19.150 --> 03:16:19.160 align:start position:0%
categories that I've outlined here
 
03:16:22.250 --> 03:16:22.260 align:start position:0%
traditionally have been ones that have
 
03:16:25.309 --> 03:16:25.319 align:start position:0%
generated interest so you know if
 
03:16:27.710 --> 03:16:27.720 align:start position:0%
there's anyone in those particular
 
03:16:30.590 --> 03:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
agencies that are used to presenting
 
03:16:32.750 --> 03:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
these items they we would continue to
 
03:16:35.809 --> 03:16:35.819 align:start position:0%
track those over the years some of them
 
03:16:37.969 --> 03:16:37.979 align:start position:0%
um a couple of them have dropped off you
 
03:16:40.429 --> 03:16:40.439 align:start position:0%
know again if I would say if it gets if
 
03:16:43.070 --> 03:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
it gets below 500 000 you know that's
 
03:16:44.570 --> 03:16:44.580 align:start position:0%
probably a point at which we're probably
 
03:16:46.250 --> 03:16:46.260 align:start position:0%
going to take them off sort of the
 
03:16:48.230 --> 03:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
reported track list but they'll still be
 
03:16:51.050 --> 03:16:51.060 align:start position:0%
in the untracked portion in there in the
 
03:16:53.690 --> 03:16:53.700 align:start position:0%
accounting system so okay great thank
 
03:16:53.700 --> 03:16:56.410 align:start position:0%
accounting system so okay great thank
you

03:16:56.410 --> 03:16:56.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:59.809 --> 03:16:59.819 align:start position:0%
so that's that's all I have on
 
03:17:02.450 --> 03:17:02.460 align:start position:0%
um General other again it's a small a
 
03:17:04.250 --> 03:17:04.260 align:start position:0%
small category so I will be happy to
 
03:17:06.769 --> 03:17:06.779 align:start position:0%
turn it over to Monica to speak with you
 
03:17:09.110 --> 03:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
about the to the treasury items
 
03:17:11.870 --> 03:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
okay any final questions
 
03:17:28.429 --> 03:17:28.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:31.550 --> 03:17:31.560 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman a members of
 
03:17:33.410 --> 03:17:33.420 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record uh say
 
03:17:36.469 --> 03:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
Treasurer Monica mazzapelli and with me
 
03:17:38.210 --> 03:17:38.220 align:start position:0%
this afternoon as the Director of
 
03:17:41.349 --> 03:17:41.359 align:start position:0%
abandoned property uh Thomas mechanespi
 
03:17:44.510 --> 03:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
so maybe before you start your your part
 
03:17:46.130 --> 03:17:46.140 align:start position:0%
of the presentation we'll get to
 
03:17:47.990 --> 03:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
representative fellow's second question
 
03:17:51.410 --> 03:17:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:53.630 --> 03:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
yes and um I think
 
03:17:53.640 --> 03:17:54.290 align:start position:0%
yes and um I think
um

03:17:54.290 --> 03:17:54.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:58.010 --> 03:17:58.020 align:start position:0%
part of what I so my goal today is to
 
03:17:59.630 --> 03:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
provide an overview of the abandoned
 
03:18:02.630 --> 03:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
property uh program and I mean the quick
 
03:18:05.809 --> 03:18:05.819 align:start position:0%
answer is that the 18 million is is our
 
03:18:08.030 --> 03:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
estimate for our restricted Revenue it's
 
03:18:09.710 --> 03:18:09.720 align:start position:0%
not the total property that we have for
 
03:18:11.690 --> 03:18:11.700 align:start position:0%
for abandoned property but
 
03:18:13.610 --> 03:18:13.620 align:start position:0%
um this is part of what I'll
 
03:18:16.550 --> 03:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
plan to present to you all today uh to
 
03:18:18.410 --> 03:18:18.420 align:start position:0%
talk about the providing overview of the
 
03:18:20.030 --> 03:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
abandoned property program as part of
 
03:18:23.929 --> 03:18:23.939 align:start position:0%
what um our restricted Revenue sources
 
03:18:25.610 --> 03:18:25.620 align:start position:0%
if that's if that's okay uh
 
03:18:25.620 --> 03:18:35.750 align:start position:0%
if that's if that's okay uh
representative

03:18:35.750 --> 03:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:38.570 --> 03:18:38.580 align:start position:0%
so um I believe you have a presentation
 
03:18:41.330 --> 03:18:41.340 align:start position:0%
and I was just asked to provide a very
 
03:18:43.370 --> 03:18:43.380 align:start position:0%
uh brief overview of our department and
 
03:18:47.030 --> 03:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
I I my intention is not to repeat what I
 
03:18:49.250 --> 03:18:49.260 align:start position:0%
said last time we met so I'll be very
 
03:18:49.260 --> 03:18:50.570 align:start position:0%
said last time we met so I'll be very
brief

03:18:50.570 --> 03:18:50.580 align:start position:0%
brief
 
03:18:53.570 --> 03:18:53.580 align:start position:0%
um about our functions so
 
03:18:57.170 --> 03:18:57.180 align:start position:0%
um and I'll I'll jump to um
 
03:18:59.990 --> 03:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh page 13 and
 
03:19:03.110 --> 03:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
um I mean I'm sorry page three and this
 
03:19:05.150 --> 03:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
is just an overview of the functions of
 
03:19:07.670 --> 03:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
the treasury so the treasury
 
03:19:11.450 --> 03:19:11.460 align:start position:0%
um is um is is currently comprised of 23
 
03:19:13.969 --> 03:19:13.979 align:start position:0%
positions and we see the treasury in two
 
03:19:16.790 --> 03:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
main areas uh one is our cash
 
03:19:19.429 --> 03:19:19.439 align:start position:0%
Investments the management of custodian
 
03:19:21.590 --> 03:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
of our cash and Investments and our debt
 
03:19:23.510 --> 03:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
management functions
 
03:19:25.250 --> 03:19:25.260 align:start position:0%
um responsible for issuing bonds to
 
03:19:27.889 --> 03:19:27.899 align:start position:0%
finance Capital products and the other
 
03:19:29.630 --> 03:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
side of the treasury is what we call
 
03:19:31.670 --> 03:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
Administration compliance or our
 
03:19:34.130 --> 03:19:34.140 align:start position:0%
treasury operations so that's comprised
 
03:19:37.370 --> 03:19:37.380 align:start position:0%
of the functions of again treasury
 
03:19:39.769 --> 03:19:39.779 align:start position:0%
operations which which the treasury is
 
03:19:41.929 --> 03:19:41.939 align:start position:0%
um we similar to the ministerial
 
03:19:43.790 --> 03:19:43.800 align:start position:0%
Services we are a central Service Agency
 
03:19:46.130 --> 03:19:46.140 align:start position:0%
you know we process and we see the final
 
03:19:48.710 --> 03:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
payments um disbursements and cash
 
03:19:50.389 --> 03:19:50.399 align:start position:0%
receipts yeah you know we have that
 
03:19:52.490 --> 03:19:52.500 align:start position:0%
relationship with our banks to do that
 
03:19:54.769 --> 03:19:54.779 align:start position:0%
and the other function that we have is
 
03:19:57.650 --> 03:19:57.660 align:start position:0%
our section of what we are it's sort of
 
03:20:00.530 --> 03:20:00.540 align:start position:0%
growing our College savings fighting and
 
03:20:03.290 --> 03:20:03.300 align:start position:0%
plan are stable New Hampshire
 
03:20:06.530 --> 03:20:06.540 align:start position:0%
um Savings Program and we also um we
 
03:20:08.269 --> 03:20:08.279 align:start position:0%
have have the oversight of three
 
03:20:10.730 --> 03:20:10.740 align:start position:0%
scholarship programs which we
 
03:20:14.450 --> 03:20:14.460 align:start position:0%
collaborate with the college tuition
 
03:20:16.250 --> 03:20:16.260 align:start position:0%
Savings Plan advisor commission for
 
03:20:19.070 --> 03:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
those programs and the last piece there
 
03:20:21.110 --> 03:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
is there abandoned property Division and
 
03:20:23.330 --> 03:20:23.340 align:start position:0%
and that's the one I'll I'll focus on
 
03:20:25.429 --> 03:20:25.439 align:start position:0%
this afternoon
 
03:20:27.650 --> 03:20:27.660 align:start position:0%
so we do the treasury does not generate
 
03:20:29.570 --> 03:20:29.580 align:start position:0%
Revenue we don't collect we don't
 
03:20:32.929 --> 03:20:32.939 align:start position:0%
collect Revenue per se but we do
 
03:20:34.969 --> 03:20:34.979 align:start position:0%
um end up generating two unrestricted
 
03:20:37.550 --> 03:20:37.560 align:start position:0%
Revenue sources one SRS treatment
 
03:20:37.560 --> 03:20:39.290 align:start position:0%
Revenue sources one SRS treatment
Revenue

03:20:39.290 --> 03:20:39.300 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
03:20:41.450 --> 03:20:41.460 align:start position:0%
um account and the other one is our
 
03:20:43.309 --> 03:20:43.319 align:start position:0%
interest in surplus funds which that's
 
03:20:47.809 --> 03:20:47.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:50.630 --> 03:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
so moving on to page four
 
03:20:54.889 --> 03:20:54.899 align:start position:0%
and this is just to do a quick dip dive
 
03:20:56.950 --> 03:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
on then claim property program so we
 
03:21:00.130 --> 03:21:00.140 align:start position:0%

administering the abandoned property
 
03:21:07.849 --> 03:21:07.859 align:start position:0%
program and and what it is is that we
 
03:21:11.929 --> 03:21:11.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:15.170 --> 03:21:15.180 align:start position:0%
um and returning intangible property to

um is is
 
03:21:31.670 --> 03:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
um could be unclaimed checks could be
 
03:21:35.630 --> 03:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
cash could be bank accounts could be
 
03:21:38.650 --> 03:21:38.660 align:start position:0%

um
 
03:22:14.830 --> 03:22:14.840 align:start position:0%
about 600
 
03:22:17.389 --> 03:22:17.399 align:start position:0%
6500 institutional holders reported to
 
03:22:19.550 --> 03:22:19.560 align:start position:0%

03:22:23.090 --> 03:22:23.100 align:start position:0%
um over 27 million dollars in cash and
 
03:22:26.269 --> 03:22:26.279 align:start position:0%
2.8 million uh in shares of stock or
 
03:22:29.090 --> 03:22:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:31.370 --> 03:22:31.380 align:start position:0%
um page five is just showing us the
 
03:22:34.790 --> 03:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
10-year Trend and this is again what we
 
03:22:37.490 --> 03:22:37.500 align:start position:0%
have collected uh over the last 10 years
 
03:22:42.650 --> 03:22:42.660 align:start position:0%
and that is about 192.8 million and
 
03:22:45.349 --> 03:22:45.359 align:start position:0%
that's an average of about 19.2 million
 
03:22:50.389 --> 03:22:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:52.490 --> 03:22:52.500 align:start position:0%
so on page six
 
03:22:52.500 --> 03:22:54.410 align:start position:0%
so on page six
um

03:22:54.410 --> 03:22:54.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:56.469 --> 03:22:56.479 align:start position:0%
it just
 
03:22:58.490 --> 03:22:58.500 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
03:23:00.290 --> 03:23:00.300 align:start position:0%
um you know our responsibility to to
 
03:23:03.110 --> 03:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
notify the rifle owners of the property
 
03:23:05.570 --> 03:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
of Beholder that we hold
 
03:23:08.389 --> 03:23:08.399 align:start position:0%
um and so each so we we do um generally
 
03:23:11.150 --> 03:23:11.160 align:start position:0%
we do our reach and as part of that
 
03:23:13.849 --> 03:23:13.859 align:start position:0%
Outreach and in advertising each October
 
03:23:15.650 --> 03:23:15.660 align:start position:0%
we publish
 
03:23:15.660 --> 03:23:16.429 align:start position:0%
we publish
um

03:23:16.429 --> 03:23:16.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:19.010 --> 03:23:19.020 align:start position:0%
a nano publication and the Union New
 
03:23:21.290 --> 03:23:21.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire union leader with all the new
 
03:23:23.389 --> 03:23:23.399 align:start position:0%
names and all the new property that we
 
03:23:28.130 --> 03:23:28.140 align:start position:0%
received in the prior reporting year
 
03:23:30.769 --> 03:23:30.779 align:start position:0%
we also send um
 
03:23:34.010 --> 03:23:34.020 align:start position:0%
we also mail postcard notifications to
 
03:23:35.809 --> 03:23:35.819 align:start position:0%
um to those individuals and businesses
 
03:23:38.090 --> 03:23:38.100 align:start position:0%
and we send it to the last known address
 
03:23:40.849 --> 03:23:40.859 align:start position:0%
that we have so that occurs in the
 
03:23:43.729 --> 03:23:43.739 align:start position:0%
months of August and September
 
03:23:46.250 --> 03:23:46.260 align:start position:0%
so now we're able to
 
03:23:46.260 --> 03:23:48.290 align:start position:0%
so now we're able to
um

03:23:48.290 --> 03:23:48.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:51.769 --> 03:23:51.779 align:start position:0%
we called in our database we now folks
 
03:23:54.769 --> 03:23:54.779 align:start position:0%
are able to do online searches and and
 
03:23:58.130 --> 03:23:58.140 align:start position:0%
people can claim directly by going to
 
03:24:00.170 --> 03:24:00.180 align:start position:0%
our website and that's how folks can
 
03:24:02.510 --> 03:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
claim uh abandoned properties so right
 
03:24:05.510 --> 03:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
now we are the website that we have is
 
03:24:07.269 --> 03:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire dot find your
 
03:24:09.950 --> 03:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
unclaimproperty.com but that's about to
 
03:24:13.550 --> 03:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
change if it hasn't changed yet not yet
 
03:24:16.070 --> 03:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
so it's going to be an easier name find
 
03:24:18.110 --> 03:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshiremoney.gov so we're about to
 
03:24:19.969 --> 03:24:19.979 align:start position:0%
change that name to to make it easier
 
03:24:19.979 --> 03:24:21.170 align:start position:0%
change that name to to make it easier
for

03:24:21.170 --> 03:24:21.180 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:24:23.330 --> 03:24:23.340 align:start position:0%
um to claim to claim the funds but again
 
03:24:26.030 --> 03:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's a it's a lot we have
 
03:24:28.849 --> 03:24:28.859 align:start position:0%
implemented new technology and over the
 
03:24:31.550 --> 03:24:31.560 align:start position:0%
last few years uh has you know in order
 
03:24:34.070 --> 03:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
to facilitate and to to make it easier
 
03:24:37.729 --> 03:24:37.739 align:start position:0%
for for the general public now we're
 
03:24:41.090 --> 03:24:41.100 align:start position:0%
able anyone can search property online
 
03:24:44.330 --> 03:24:44.340 align:start position:0%
and folks can claim directly so the
 
03:24:47.150 --> 03:24:47.160 align:start position:0%
claim is is done so the claim and the
 
03:24:49.190 --> 03:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
claiming of funds can can happen right
 
03:24:52.670 --> 03:24:52.680 align:start position:0%
away we also implemented a new features
 
03:24:56.269 --> 03:24:56.279 align:start position:0%
called Fast Track and now if the if the
 
03:24:59.690 --> 03:24:59.700 align:start position:0%
claimant meets specific criteria the
 
03:25:02.990 --> 03:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
system actually approves a claim and in
 
03:25:05.150 --> 03:25:05.160 align:start position:0%
two weeks the claimer receives the check
 
03:25:07.190 --> 03:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
so it's just it's right now we have
 
03:25:08.809 --> 03:25:08.819 align:start position:0%
amounts those are amounts under a
 
03:25:11.450 --> 03:25:11.460 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars but we're about to
 
03:25:12.889 --> 03:25:12.899 align:start position:0%
increase the threshold we just wanted to
 
03:25:14.929 --> 03:25:14.939 align:start position:0%
do some testing with that but it's going
 
03:25:16.490 --> 03:25:16.500 align:start position:0%
really well and what that's doing is
 
03:25:19.190 --> 03:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
really cleaning our database so folks
 
03:25:21.050 --> 03:25:21.060 align:start position:0%
that were not willing to submit the
 
03:25:23.750 --> 03:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
paperwork or so now it's easier to do it
 
03:25:26.510 --> 03:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
and they get the check two weeks later
 
03:25:29.090 --> 03:25:29.100 align:start position:0%
um so just uh so in first gear 22 the
 
03:25:32.030 --> 03:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
division uh returned about 6.6 million
 
03:25:34.010 --> 03:25:34.020 align:start position:0%
and that and
 
03:25:36.550 --> 03:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
that was about um
 
03:25:38.809 --> 03:25:38.819 align:start position:0%
789 claims
 
03:25:41.150 --> 03:25:41.160 align:start position:0%
so page seven is showing uh again the
 
03:25:42.650 --> 03:25:42.660 align:start position:0%
10-year Trend
 
03:25:44.990 --> 03:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
um and it looks like um you know on
 
03:25:48.349 --> 03:25:48.359 align:start position:0%
average we return about 6.5 million
 
03:25:55.070 --> 03:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:56.630 --> 03:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
so that's really the goal of this
 
03:25:59.330 --> 03:25:59.340 align:start position:0%
program to to collect all this unclaimed
 
03:26:02.690 --> 03:26:02.700 align:start position:0%
property and the dormant property that
 
03:26:02.700 --> 03:26:03.889 align:start position:0%
property and the dormant property that
holders

03:26:03.889 --> 03:26:03.899 align:start position:0%
holders
 
03:26:07.130 --> 03:26:07.140 align:start position:0%
um have and but if we're unable to
 
03:26:09.170 --> 03:26:09.180 align:start position:0%
return this property
 
03:26:11.090 --> 03:26:11.100 align:start position:0%
um during a period of three years the
 
03:26:14.510 --> 03:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
law requires us to allows us to is cheat
 
03:26:19.250 --> 03:26:19.260 align:start position:0%
that property to County treasures
 
03:26:22.130 --> 03:26:22.140 align:start position:0%
or if his property from out of state
 
03:26:24.349 --> 03:26:24.359 align:start position:0%
that is treats to the general fund and
 
03:26:25.670 --> 03:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
so that's the unrestricted Revenue
 
03:26:29.030 --> 03:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
amount that is um
 
03:26:31.729 --> 03:26:31.739 align:start position:0%
that we report that we generate
 
03:26:34.370 --> 03:26:34.380 align:start position:0%
so on page eight it shows we're showing
 
03:26:37.429 --> 03:26:37.439 align:start position:0%
the calculation for fiscal year 22 and
 
03:26:41.090 --> 03:26:41.100 align:start position:0%
and so all that does is it just shows
 
03:26:43.969 --> 03:26:43.979 align:start position:0%
that's the property the line that says
 
03:26:46.490 --> 03:26:46.500 align:start position:0%
net amount remitted that's for the
 
03:26:48.650 --> 03:26:48.660 align:start position:0%
report year 18 so that was fiscal year
 
03:26:51.650 --> 03:26:51.660 align:start position:0%
19. so that was property limited to us
 
03:26:51.660 --> 03:26:53.450 align:start position:0%
19. so that was property limited to us
and

03:26:53.450 --> 03:26:53.460 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:26:56.269 --> 03:26:56.279 align:start position:0%
um also the the claims against that
 
03:26:59.210 --> 03:26:59.220 align:start position:0%
property so that's the net amount and
 
03:27:01.070 --> 03:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
then we also
 
03:27:04.010 --> 03:27:04.020 align:start position:0%
um this includes this proceeds from
 
03:27:06.530 --> 03:27:06.540 align:start position:0%
Securities that we liquidate that was
 
03:27:09.410 --> 03:27:09.420 align:start position:0%
about 4 million and 22 we are allowed to
 
03:27:12.110 --> 03:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
subtract them in a certain expenses
 
03:27:16.610 --> 03:27:16.620 align:start position:0%
and then um again this so the minus the
 
03:27:18.710 --> 03:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
payments to the counties and physical 22
 
03:27:21.950 --> 03:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
was 1.4 million and so and so the net
 
03:27:25.610 --> 03:27:25.620 align:start position:0%
amount was uh 15.2 million that we
 
03:27:25.620 --> 03:27:26.389 align:start position:0%
amount was uh 15.2 million that we
um

03:27:26.389 --> 03:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:30.349 --> 03:27:30.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:32.750 --> 03:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
so page page 9 is just showing you again
 
03:27:35.210 --> 03:27:35.220 align:start position:0%
the 10-year Trend and this shows uh the
 
03:27:37.910 --> 03:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
two components of our achievement is um
 
03:27:40.250 --> 03:27:40.260 align:start position:0%
the the Char the bar the charts with the
 
03:27:42.969 --> 03:27:42.979 align:start position:0%
bars just shows those are that's the
 
03:27:46.250 --> 03:27:46.260 align:start position:0%
property from institutional holders and
 
03:27:48.110 --> 03:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
then the bottom is showing um the
 
03:27:50.870 --> 03:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
security liquidation proceeds and
 
03:27:53.210 --> 03:27:53.220 align:start position:0%
obviously the the property that is
 
03:27:55.370 --> 03:27:55.380 align:start position:0%
reported To Us by holder that's the cash
 
03:27:57.530 --> 03:27:57.540 align:start position:0%
we we all know that amount is more
 
03:28:00.229 --> 03:28:00.239 align:start position:0%
predictable the Pisa is more it's it's
 
03:28:01.969 --> 03:28:01.979 align:start position:0%
just more unpredictable and difficult to
 
03:28:04.969 --> 03:28:04.979 align:start position:0%
estimate is these are the Securities
 
03:28:08.809 --> 03:28:08.819 align:start position:0%
that we hold and each year we sell those
 
03:28:11.690 --> 03:28:11.700 align:start position:0%
Securities in order to achieve those
 
03:28:13.969 --> 03:28:13.979 align:start position:0%
amounts to Regional funds so that's
 
03:28:15.590 --> 03:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
um that's again an amount that is
 
03:28:17.210 --> 03:28:17.220 align:start position:0%
unpredictable and it's based on the
 
03:28:18.830 --> 03:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
value of the Securities at the time that
 
03:28:20.929 --> 03:28:20.939 align:start position:0%
we we sell those Securities so
 
03:28:23.030 --> 03:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
essentially it depends on the conditions
 
03:28:25.010 --> 03:28:25.020 align:start position:0%
on the market
 
03:28:27.410 --> 03:28:27.420 align:start position:0%
representative Ami
 
03:28:28.969 --> 03:28:28.979 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:28:28.979 --> 03:28:30.290 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

03:28:30.290 --> 03:28:30.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:34.250 --> 03:28:34.260 align:start position:0%
it's like FY 18 was a banner year for us
 
03:28:34.260 --> 03:28:35.830 align:start position:0%
it's like FY 18 was a banner year for us
but

03:28:35.830 --> 03:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:28:40.030 --> 03:28:40.040 align:start position:0%
FY 18 reported
 
03:28:43.849 --> 03:28:43.859 align:start position:0%
and cash claims paid
 
03:28:46.190 --> 03:28:46.200 align:start position:0%
seemed normal
 
03:28:49.969 --> 03:28:49.979 align:start position:0%
so is is this a year off the achievement
 
03:28:51.769 --> 03:28:51.779 align:start position:0%
later than the
 
03:28:54.830 --> 03:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
yeah with uh
 
03:28:56.630 --> 03:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
if you when you see something like that
 
03:28:59.750 --> 03:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
it means that we in that particular year
 
03:29:02.510 --> 03:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
the um where the claims remain
 
03:29:04.969 --> 03:29:04.979 align:start position:0%
relatively steady that's going to be
 
03:29:07.670 --> 03:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
based upon that that's going to be based
 
03:29:12.349 --> 03:29:12.359 align:start position:0%
upon the the uh two factors one we had
 
03:29:14.889 --> 03:29:14.899 align:start position:0%
additional reports from
 
03:29:18.050 --> 03:29:18.060 align:start position:0%
additional cash reports from holders
 
03:29:19.969 --> 03:29:19.979 align:start position:0%
that particular year but if you also
 
03:29:21.710 --> 03:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
look we had a good year selling the
 
03:29:23.450 --> 03:29:23.460 align:start position:0%
stock the the Securities that we
 
03:29:24.950 --> 03:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
liquidated that year were close to Six
 
03:29:27.050 --> 03:29:27.060 align:start position:0%
Million Dollars
 
03:29:29.150 --> 03:29:29.160 align:start position:0%
and you take a look at like fiscal year
 
03:29:31.490 --> 03:29:31.500 align:start position:0%
2020 like the treasurer spoke to the
 
03:29:33.590 --> 03:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
volatility we sell them at the same
 
03:29:36.050 --> 03:29:36.060 align:start position:0%
period every year we don't want to
 
03:29:38.030 --> 03:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
ever be saying like we're trying to
 
03:29:40.010 --> 03:29:40.020 align:start position:0%
Leverage The Market or looking because
 
03:29:41.570 --> 03:29:41.580 align:start position:0%
then you could never really pick the
 
03:29:43.910 --> 03:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
perfect time to do it so we do at the
 
03:29:47.450 --> 03:29:47.460 align:start position:0%
same time every year in fiscal year 2020
 
03:29:49.190 --> 03:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
we sold it and it was you know during
 
03:29:51.110 --> 03:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
the height of the pandemic the stock
 
03:29:53.269 --> 03:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
market was down and you see that we you
 
03:29:54.830 --> 03:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
know we had one of our worst here so
 
03:29:57.530 --> 03:29:57.540 align:start position:0%
that's just that that becomes the you
 
03:30:00.170 --> 03:30:00.180 align:start position:0%
know the very volatile part of putting
 
03:30:04.309 --> 03:30:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:08.210 --> 03:30:08.220 align:start position:0%
yes if I could follow up I think two
 
03:30:12.349 --> 03:30:12.359 align:start position:0%
years ago we were asking if it would be
 
03:30:13.910 --> 03:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
better if
 
03:30:17.570 --> 03:30:17.580 align:start position:0%
things were sold every month instead of
 
03:30:23.090 --> 03:30:23.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:26.090 --> 03:30:26.100 align:start position:0%
I do recall that question I think um we
 
03:30:28.969 --> 03:30:28.979 align:start position:0%
we did consider that if I recall I think
 
03:30:30.769 --> 03:30:30.779 align:start position:0%
the difficult part is we we still have
 
03:30:34.070 --> 03:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
to wait you know three years to to
 
03:30:36.050 --> 03:30:36.060 align:start position:0%
um to know how much we're gonna cheat
 
03:30:39.410 --> 03:30:39.420 align:start position:0%
and and we and um but the time at the
 
03:30:40.910 --> 03:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
time that we start doing this
 
03:30:43.309 --> 03:30:43.319 align:start position:0%
transactions we were just discussing it
 
03:30:45.710 --> 03:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
starts in March to be able to start
 
03:30:48.050 --> 03:30:48.060 align:start position:0%
um we notify our custodian it's time to
 
03:30:51.229 --> 03:30:51.239 align:start position:0%
start selling security so it takes a few
 
03:30:52.969 --> 03:30:52.979 align:start position:0%
months to do that
 
03:30:55.190 --> 03:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
um you know those transactions so I
 
03:30:57.349 --> 03:30:57.359 align:start position:0%
think it would be probably difficult
 
03:30:59.450 --> 03:30:59.460 align:start position:0%
um to do it if we were to where to do it
 
03:31:00.889 --> 03:31:00.899 align:start position:0%
more often
 
03:31:02.630 --> 03:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
um so that's that's part of what you
 
03:31:04.849 --> 03:31:04.859 align:start position:0%
know sort of um staying with what we do
 
03:31:08.090 --> 03:31:08.100 align:start position:0%
is is not an exact science and we we do
 
03:31:10.849 --> 03:31:10.859 align:start position:0%
our best system and I and I can in you
 
03:31:13.550 --> 03:31:13.560 align:start position:0%
know on page 10 I was um was going to
 
03:31:15.830 --> 03:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
talk about estimates but what we use to
 
03:31:17.950 --> 03:31:17.960 align:start position:0%
estimate um
 
03:31:20.389 --> 03:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
again this is sort of isn't a
 
03:31:21.769 --> 03:31:21.779 align:start position:0%
predictable amount how much we're going
 
03:31:23.330 --> 03:31:23.340 align:start position:0%
to return each year how much we're going
 
03:31:25.190 --> 03:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
to collect this year but what we've been
 
03:31:27.530 --> 03:31:27.540 align:start position:0%
doing for our estimates is we we base it
 
03:31:30.290 --> 03:31:30.300 align:start position:0%
on a 10-year average and that's just our
 
03:31:32.450 --> 03:31:32.460 align:start position:0%
history you know based on history and
 
03:31:34.790 --> 03:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
that's just our best estimate what we
 
03:31:37.250 --> 03:31:37.260 align:start position:0%
need to do and we were just um director
 
03:31:40.130 --> 03:31:40.140 align:start position:0%
and I uh we were just discussing that we
 
03:31:41.870 --> 03:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
need to do is compare how close we are
 
03:31:43.729 --> 03:31:43.739 align:start position:0%
every time we estimate and we we don't
 
03:31:45.110 --> 03:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
have that exercise for this time but
 
03:31:47.570 --> 03:31:47.580 align:start position:0%
we're about we need to do that uh but
 
03:31:49.429 --> 03:31:49.439 align:start position:0%
again that's you know using our history
 
03:31:52.729 --> 03:31:52.739 align:start position:0%
is really the best methodology that we
 
03:31:54.590 --> 03:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
found to be able to provide these
 
03:31:54.600 --> 03:31:58.370 align:start position:0%
found to be able to provide these
estimates

03:31:58.370 --> 03:31:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:01.070 --> 03:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
representative pleb I have to start with
 
03:32:04.250 --> 03:32:04.260 align:start position:0%
basics in the term for a sheet that is
 
03:32:07.610 --> 03:32:07.620 align:start position:0%
taking property from somebody who passed
 
03:32:09.349 --> 03:32:09.359 align:start position:0%
who has no heirs
 
03:32:13.130 --> 03:32:13.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:15.170 --> 03:32:15.180 align:start position:0%
actually used as a misnomer in this
 
03:32:17.570 --> 03:32:17.580 align:start position:0%
particular case a sheet is a true
 
03:32:19.790 --> 03:32:19.800 align:start position:0%
Rasheed is the government taking money
 
03:32:22.969 --> 03:32:22.979 align:start position:0%
that has no that will never be given
 
03:32:24.650 --> 03:32:24.660 align:start position:0%
back so
 
03:32:26.690 --> 03:32:26.700 align:start position:0%
in the in abandoned property in an
 
03:32:29.150 --> 03:32:29.160 align:start position:0%
unclaimed property it is sometimes used
 
03:32:30.889 --> 03:32:30.899 align:start position:0%
as called you know it's called in a
 
03:32:33.170 --> 03:32:33.180 align:start position:0%
sheet but it's never truly in the sheet
 
03:32:35.269 --> 03:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
because every state hasn't been a
 
03:32:36.469 --> 03:32:36.479 align:start position:0%
property Division and they're all
 
03:32:38.450 --> 03:32:38.460 align:start position:0%
because they're every it's all custodial
 
03:32:41.570 --> 03:32:41.580 align:start position:0%
takings because the the individual or
 
03:32:43.910 --> 03:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
The Heirs at law have the right to claim
 
03:32:46.550 --> 03:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
that property anytime in the future so
 
03:32:48.110 --> 03:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
there's never a truer sheet even though
 
03:32:49.309 --> 03:32:49.319 align:start position:0%
we transfer the money to the general
 
03:32:53.150 --> 03:32:53.160 align:start position:0%
fund it's always subject by law subject
 
03:32:54.950 --> 03:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
to be withdrawn from the general fund so
 
03:32:57.290 --> 03:32:57.300 align:start position:0%
we can pay that claim so it isn't that
 
03:32:59.269 --> 03:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
truest sheet that you'd have there's
 
03:33:01.010 --> 03:33:01.020 align:start position:0%
never anything that we take that's an
 
03:33:03.410 --> 03:33:03.420 align:start position:0%
absolute Cruise sheet that there's no
 
03:33:05.690 --> 03:33:05.700 align:start position:0%
one that could come forward I mean in
 
03:33:07.610 --> 03:33:07.620 align:start position:0%
some limited instances that is the case
 
03:33:09.410 --> 03:33:09.420 align:start position:0%
because there are people that die truly
 
03:33:11.210 --> 03:33:11.220 align:start position:0%
with no ears
 
03:33:13.370 --> 03:33:13.380 align:start position:0%
um and so that money once it does go
 
03:33:16.190 --> 03:33:16.200 align:start position:0%
there is no chance that it would ever be
 
03:33:19.610 --> 03:33:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:21.830 --> 03:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
03:33:22.910 --> 03:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:33:29.630 --> 03:33:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:31.790 --> 03:33:31.800 align:start position:0%
same title but they don't have the same
 
03:33:36.290 --> 03:33:36.300 align:start position:0%
dollar amount am I supposed to
 
03:33:39.830 --> 03:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
on page nine is it yes so so page nine
 
03:33:42.590 --> 03:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
it just shows essentially the break I
 
03:33:44.570 --> 03:33:44.580 align:start position:0%
guess make it easier on page 10 is just
 
03:33:46.969 --> 03:33:46.979 align:start position:0%
the total amount so we as cheat to the
 
03:33:49.969 --> 03:33:49.979 align:start position:0%
general fund page nine it shows that in
 
03:33:51.710 --> 03:33:51.720 align:start position:0%
two parts
 
03:33:54.769 --> 03:33:54.779 align:start position:0%
um the the the graph with the bars is
 
03:33:57.349 --> 03:33:57.359 align:start position:0%
those are the properties reported to us
 
03:33:59.510 --> 03:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
and essentially in cash from
 
03:34:02.630 --> 03:34:02.640 align:start position:0%
institutional holders the um the bottom
 
03:34:05.030 --> 03:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
section shows security so we call those
 
03:34:07.190 --> 03:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
Securities so add them together for
 
03:34:08.769 --> 03:34:08.779 align:start position:0%
three years because some some
 
03:34:11.389 --> 03:34:11.399 align:start position:0%
individuals and some exactly some
 
03:34:14.210 --> 03:34:14.220 align:start position:0%
businesses uh choose to re-register that
 
03:34:16.190 --> 03:34:16.200 align:start position:0%
instead of receiving cash when they
 
03:34:18.550 --> 03:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
claim they can re-register the stock
 
03:34:21.050 --> 03:34:21.060 align:start position:0%
essentially and just we just transfer
 
03:34:22.790 --> 03:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
that to them
 
03:34:24.889 --> 03:34:24.899 align:start position:0%
and so when it's time to so when we
 
03:34:27.050 --> 03:34:27.060 align:start position:0%
haven't been able to find uh the owners
 
03:34:29.690 --> 03:34:29.700 align:start position:0%
of this property that's the time that we
 
03:34:32.809 --> 03:34:32.819 align:start position:0%
do have to sell this and liquidate these
 
03:34:35.450 --> 03:34:35.460 align:start position:0%
Securities in order to cheat in order to
 
03:34:38.809 --> 03:34:38.819 align:start position:0%
send money to the general fund just like
 
03:34:43.370 --> 03:34:43.380 align:start position:0%
follow-up so in in both of these the the
 
03:34:46.030 --> 03:34:46.040 align:start position:0%
when you had to transfer the properties
 
03:34:49.429 --> 03:34:49.439 align:start position:0%
to the county that that's in neither of
 
03:34:51.830 --> 03:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
these that's already taken out it is
 
03:34:54.170 --> 03:34:54.180 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
03:34:56.090 --> 03:34:56.100 align:start position:0%
that's correct this presentation doesn't
 
03:34:58.250 --> 03:34:58.260 align:start position:0%
doesn't show the amount that we send to
 
03:34:59.990 --> 03:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
the counties just what we send to the
 
03:35:01.490 --> 03:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
03:35:03.710 --> 03:35:03.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:35:07.010 --> 03:35:07.020 align:start position:0%
and and so just to to conclude this this
 
03:35:10.070 --> 03:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
part is just the again the the bottom um
 
03:35:14.090 --> 03:35:14.100 align:start position:0%
portion of um page five is just showing
 
03:35:16.010 --> 03:35:16.020 align:start position:0%
um the amounts that we're projecting for
 
03:35:18.349 --> 03:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23
 
03:35:21.110 --> 03:35:21.120 align:start position:0%
um for first year 24 and 25 and again
 
03:35:23.389 --> 03:35:23.399 align:start position:0%
these are these are based on our uh
 
03:35:23.399 --> 03:35:25.070 align:start position:0%
these are these are based on our uh
10-year

03:35:25.070 --> 03:35:25.080 align:start position:0%
10-year
 
03:35:25.080 --> 03:35:25.790 align:start position:0%
10-year
um

03:35:25.790 --> 03:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:25.800 --> 03:35:34.130 align:start position:0%
um
history

03:35:34.130 --> 03:35:34.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:36.590 --> 03:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
I think you said page five but did you
 
03:35:38.630 --> 03:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
mean page ten minutes and I'm sorry
 
03:35:41.450 --> 03:35:41.460 align:start position:0%
about that did I um so page 10 okay I
 
03:35:47.389 --> 03:35:47.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:50.110 --> 03:35:50.120 align:start position:0%
so if there are no other questions about
 
03:35:52.250 --> 03:35:52.260 align:start position:0%
unclaimed property I could move to
 
03:35:55.070 --> 03:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
interest on surplus funds
 
03:35:55.080 --> 03:35:58.250 align:start position:0%
interest on surplus funds
okay

03:35:58.250 --> 03:35:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:01.250 --> 03:36:01.260 align:start position:0%
so interesting Surplus sponsors is
 
03:36:03.170 --> 03:36:03.180 align:start position:0%
essentially the income that we generate
 
03:36:05.929 --> 03:36:05.939 align:start position:0%
from from our investments
 
03:36:09.349 --> 03:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
as you'll know the treacherous required
 
03:36:10.729 --> 03:36:10.739 align:start position:0%
to invest
 
03:36:13.130 --> 03:36:13.140 align:start position:0%
um any excess funds anything that we're
 
03:36:15.950 --> 03:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
not contemplating for operating expenses
 
03:36:19.010 --> 03:36:19.020 align:start position:0%
we we invest those funds
 
03:36:22.670 --> 03:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
um so uh the interest income depends
 
03:36:24.290 --> 03:36:24.300 align:start position:0%
obviously on the interest rate
 
03:36:26.870 --> 03:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
environment and the average cash
 
03:36:29.269 --> 03:36:29.279 align:start position:0%
balances that we have so
 
03:36:31.429 --> 03:36:31.439 align:start position:0%
um as I mentioned when I was with you
 
03:36:33.650 --> 03:36:33.660 align:start position:0%
during the last this last presentation
 
03:36:36.469 --> 03:36:36.479 align:start position:0%
about three weeks ago our cash position
 
03:36:39.830 --> 03:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
has significantly grown uh during the
 
03:36:41.929 --> 03:36:41.939 align:start position:0%
last two years and that's uh primarily
 
03:36:43.610 --> 03:36:43.620 align:start position:0%
due to the
 
03:36:45.530 --> 03:36:45.540 align:start position:0%
um the arpa funding that we have
 
03:36:48.710 --> 03:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
received so we know so right now what we
 
03:36:49.849 --> 03:36:49.859 align:start position:0%
know is
 
03:36:52.550 --> 03:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
um for the most part what's left is what
 
03:36:54.229 --> 03:36:54.239 align:start position:0%
we call the state and local fiscal
 
03:36:56.269 --> 03:36:56.279 align:start position:0%
recovery funds
 
03:36:59.510 --> 03:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
um in that we we know it's going to be
 
03:37:03.110 --> 03:37:03.120 align:start position:0%
with us for a few more years and so
 
03:37:04.490 --> 03:37:04.500 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
03:37:06.710 --> 03:37:06.720 align:start position:0%
um the dashboard that the Department
 
03:37:09.830 --> 03:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
administrative Services prepares through
 
03:37:12.650 --> 03:37:12.660 align:start position:0%
December 31st of 22 approximately 94
 
03:37:16.190 --> 03:37:16.200 align:start position:0%
percent of the 994 million that the
 
03:37:18.530 --> 03:37:18.540 align:start position:0%
state has received relative to this
 
03:37:18.540 --> 03:37:19.969 align:start position:0%
state has received relative to this
particular

03:37:19.969 --> 03:37:19.979 align:start position:0%
particular
 
03:37:19.979 --> 03:37:20.870 align:start position:0%
particular
um

03:37:20.870 --> 03:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:20.880 --> 03:37:22.849 align:start position:0%
um
Grant

03:37:22.849 --> 03:37:22.859 align:start position:0%
Grant
 
03:37:24.969 --> 03:37:24.979 align:start position:0%
um only 94
 
03:37:28.550 --> 03:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
94 has been allocated to agencies but
 
03:37:31.790 --> 03:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
only 22 percent has been expanded so
 
03:37:33.469 --> 03:37:33.479 align:start position:0%
we're trying to work with state agencies
 
03:37:35.450 --> 03:37:35.460 align:start position:0%
to try to figure it out or to try to
 
03:37:37.849 --> 03:37:37.859 align:start position:0%
learn the spend implants and that will
 
03:37:40.610 --> 03:37:40.620 align:start position:0%
help us determine for how long we can
 
03:37:43.729 --> 03:37:43.739 align:start position:0%
invest this fund so we're we're speaking
 
03:37:45.650 --> 03:37:45.660 align:start position:0%
with larger agencies like Department of
 
03:37:46.910 --> 03:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
administrative Services they have
 
03:37:50.889 --> 03:37:50.899 align:start position:0%
received large amounts of this grants
 
03:37:53.090 --> 03:37:53.100 align:start position:0%
Bureau of economic Affairs that's
 
03:37:56.090 --> 03:37:56.100 align:start position:0%
another recipient of our large large
 
03:37:59.150 --> 03:37:59.160 align:start position:0%
Grant from from this part of money and
 
03:38:00.290 --> 03:38:00.300 align:start position:0%
so again we're working with state
 
03:38:02.330 --> 03:38:02.340 align:start position:0%
agencies to determine how long we're
 
03:38:03.590 --> 03:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
going to have those funds so we can
 
03:38:05.330 --> 03:38:05.340 align:start position:0%
invest them
 
03:38:07.729 --> 03:38:07.739 align:start position:0%
um so so from that from those funds that
 
03:38:10.309 --> 03:38:10.319 align:start position:0%
we so we pull all the cash that this day
 
03:38:13.190 --> 03:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
receives and from that uh we are allowed
 
03:38:14.269 --> 03:38:14.279 align:start position:0%
to deduct
 
03:38:16.849 --> 03:38:16.859 align:start position:0%
um or pay for our banking costs and an
 
03:38:19.969 --> 03:38:19.979 align:start position:0%
investment fees from from that and from
 
03:38:21.769 --> 03:38:21.779 align:start position:0%
those earnings
 
03:38:23.929 --> 03:38:23.939 align:start position:0%
um so once we obviously calculate the
 
03:38:26.990 --> 03:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
earnings we we need to this uh we need
 
03:38:29.809 --> 03:38:29.819 align:start position:0%
to allocate um interest to those funds
 
03:38:32.150 --> 03:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
who are entitled to receive interest so
 
03:38:33.050 --> 03:38:33.060 align:start position:0%
we have
 
03:38:35.030 --> 03:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
um the or make what we call our major or
 
03:38:38.389 --> 03:38:38.399 align:start position:0%
major funds the par um dedication trust
 
03:38:40.370 --> 03:38:40.380 align:start position:0%
fund receives an interest allocation for
 
03:38:41.809 --> 03:38:41.819 align:start position:0%
example the lottery receives interest
 
03:38:44.090 --> 03:38:44.100 align:start position:0%
allocation but also the smaller
 
03:38:47.090 --> 03:38:47.100 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds are entitled to uh those
 
03:38:48.769 --> 03:38:48.779 align:start position:0%
are those are entitled to receive an
 
03:38:50.269 --> 03:38:50.279 align:start position:0%
interest allocation will receive an
 
03:38:52.309 --> 03:38:52.319 align:start position:0%
interest allocation
 
03:38:52.319 --> 03:38:53.090 align:start position:0%
interest allocation
um

03:38:53.090 --> 03:38:53.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:56.450 --> 03:38:56.460 align:start position:0%
so so with that um on page 12
 
03:38:56.460 --> 03:38:57.710 align:start position:0%
so so with that um on page 12
um

03:38:57.710 --> 03:38:57.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:59.990 --> 03:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
we have I'm sorry we have a question uh
 
03:39:02.210 --> 03:39:02.220 align:start position:0%
representative Ames sorry to interrupt
 
03:39:04.910 --> 03:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
you in mid-sentence
 
03:39:06.650 --> 03:39:06.660 align:start position:0%
so I'm interested in the state and local
 
03:39:09.410 --> 03:39:09.420 align:start position:0%
fiscal recovery funds uh which you
 
03:39:11.330 --> 03:39:11.340 align:start position:0%
mentioned and that indicated you're
 
03:39:12.769 --> 03:39:12.779 align:start position:0%
working on that working with state
 
03:39:15.410 --> 03:39:15.420 align:start position:0%
agencies to I guess figure out what's
 
03:39:18.190 --> 03:39:18.200 align:start position:0%
going on and um
 
03:39:22.190 --> 03:39:22.200 align:start position:0%
and there's also this uh apparent uh
 
03:39:25.370 --> 03:39:25.380 align:start position:0%
part of this picture that involves
 
03:39:29.450 --> 03:39:29.460 align:start position:0%
obligated funds and uh and expenditures
 
03:39:33.530 --> 03:39:33.540 align:start position:0%
and um with respect to the obligating of
 
03:39:35.710 --> 03:39:35.720 align:start position:0%
the slrf
 
03:39:38.330 --> 03:39:38.340 align:start position:0%
slfr funds
 
03:39:42.250 --> 03:39:42.260 align:start position:0%
um I I suppose that an obligation can be
 
03:39:45.110 --> 03:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
disobligated if you will and then
 
03:39:48.830 --> 03:39:48.840 align:start position:0%
re-obligated re-aligned as long as
 
03:39:50.510 --> 03:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
you're working within the time frame of
 
03:39:53.570 --> 03:39:53.580 align:start position:0%
the federal law so my question is
 
03:39:57.130 --> 03:39:57.140 align:start position:0%
whether we can get a picture
 
03:40:00.229 --> 03:40:00.239 align:start position:0%
of the whole of this thing
 
03:40:02.389 --> 03:40:02.399 align:start position:0%
um and where we would go to get that
 
03:40:04.190 --> 03:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
picture whether it's you or somewhere
 
03:40:06.710 --> 03:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
else this is a lot of money we're
 
03:40:08.410 --> 03:40:08.420 align:start position:0%
talking about close to a billion bucks
 
03:40:13.389 --> 03:40:13.399 align:start position:0%
yes so I believe the LBA tracks
 
03:40:15.830 --> 03:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
those locations I should have known
 
03:40:18.170 --> 03:40:18.180 align:start position:0%
Chris Chris knows everything and what
 
03:40:22.010 --> 03:40:22.020 align:start position:0%
the agency is so again about 94 has been
 
03:40:24.590 --> 03:40:24.600 align:start position:0%
allocated but yes you are correct that
 
03:40:27.889 --> 03:40:27.899 align:start position:0%
agencies can if they don't see uh if
 
03:40:29.750 --> 03:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
something doesn't go the way they were
 
03:40:32.750 --> 03:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
expecting they can go back and request a
 
03:40:35.750 --> 03:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
reallocation or of those funds but you
 
03:40:38.389 --> 03:40:38.399 align:start position:0%
again you're correct that the time end
 
03:40:40.309 --> 03:40:40.319 align:start position:0%
of that needs to be prior to December
 
03:40:43.309 --> 03:40:43.319 align:start position:0%
31st of 2022 and then the funds need to
 
03:40:45.590 --> 03:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
be uh oh everything needs to be spent by
 
03:40:45.600 --> 03:40:47.570 align:start position:0%
be uh oh everything needs to be spent by
26.

03:40:47.570 --> 03:40:47.580 align:start position:0%
26.
 
03:40:50.210 --> 03:40:50.220 align:start position:0%
um so but I believe that the lva is
 
03:40:51.650 --> 03:40:51.660 align:start position:0%
tracking all of
 
03:40:55.370 --> 03:40:55.380 align:start position:0%
those allocations you're welcome
 
03:40:55.380 --> 03:40:58.010 align:start position:0%
those allocations you're welcome
representative

03:40:58.010 --> 03:40:58.020 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:41:02.210 --> 03:41:02.220 align:start position:0%
thank you on at your last point is to
 
03:41:04.969 --> 03:41:04.979 align:start position:0%
get funds and to receive interest will
 
03:41:08.330 --> 03:41:08.340 align:start position:0%
receive an allocation on
 
03:41:11.269 --> 03:41:11.279 align:start position:0%
does that have to be written into the
 
03:41:13.490 --> 03:41:13.500 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund language for every single
 
03:41:15.410 --> 03:41:15.420 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund because I don't even
 
03:41:17.030 --> 03:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
remember seeing it
 
03:41:19.250 --> 03:41:19.260 align:start position:0%
well exactly so there are some dedicated
 
03:41:22.190 --> 03:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
accounts that they do specifically State
 
03:41:24.769 --> 03:41:24.779 align:start position:0%
shall receive an interest allocation or
 
03:41:27.410 --> 03:41:27.420 align:start position:0%
one and those are the ones that truly
 
03:41:29.809 --> 03:41:29.819 align:start position:0%
receive the allocation when the statute
 
03:41:32.090 --> 03:41:32.100 align:start position:0%
allows and it says may we do not
 
03:41:34.670 --> 03:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
consider those for for this exercise but
 
03:41:36.590 --> 03:41:36.600 align:start position:0%
but yes we do have to review every
 
03:41:38.990 --> 03:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
single dedicated account to know
 
03:41:42.349 --> 03:41:42.359 align:start position:0%
which which fun is entitled to receive
 
03:41:46.910 --> 03:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:48.710 --> 03:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
so again that that's what we do so so
 
03:41:50.330 --> 03:41:50.340 align:start position:0%
there are some years as you can see on
 
03:41:54.050 --> 03:41:54.060 align:start position:0%
page 12 which is my last page
 
03:41:54.060 --> 03:41:56.269 align:start position:0%
page 12 which is my last page
um

03:41:56.269 --> 03:41:56.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:58.729 --> 03:41:58.739 align:start position:0%
it really is a revenue Source all over
 
03:42:01.610 --> 03:42:01.620 align:start position:0%
the board it really is based on uh or
 
03:42:03.710 --> 03:42:03.720 align:start position:0%
the interest rate environment so there
 
03:42:05.990 --> 03:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
you know this is the 10-year Trend and
 
03:42:08.210 --> 03:42:08.220 align:start position:0%
you can see essentially you can't really
 
03:42:12.110 --> 03:42:12.120 align:start position:0%
count on this for to pay your bills but
 
03:42:14.809 --> 03:42:14.819 align:start position:0%
um so we can see for example 2009 that
 
03:42:16.429 --> 03:42:16.439 align:start position:0%
was a good year the rates that are
 
03:42:19.010 --> 03:42:19.020 align:start position:0%
increasing during that time but then
 
03:42:21.349 --> 03:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
again in 2020 the rates were cut and
 
03:42:23.929 --> 03:42:23.939 align:start position:0%
that's you know and then the income the
 
03:42:26.570 --> 03:42:26.580 align:start position:0%
interest income was reduced and during
 
03:42:28.610 --> 03:42:28.620 align:start position:0%
those times when we don't receive uh
 
03:42:30.290 --> 03:42:30.300 align:start position:0%
interest when we don't generate interest
 
03:42:33.950 --> 03:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
uh you know we we use the lower you know
 
03:42:36.290 --> 03:42:36.300 align:start position:0%
the earnings that we end up generating
 
03:42:38.630 --> 03:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
are to be able to pay our banking costs
 
03:42:40.010 --> 03:42:40.020 align:start position:0%
and investment fees unfortunately we
 
03:42:42.469 --> 03:42:42.479 align:start position:0%
still have to pay those bills
 
03:42:44.929 --> 03:42:44.939 align:start position:0%
um the good news is that with the rate
 
03:42:48.469 --> 03:42:48.479 align:start position:0%
environment where we're we're in we we
 
03:42:51.769 --> 03:42:51.779 align:start position:0%
are about to see some significant
 
03:42:54.290 --> 03:42:54.300 align:start position:0%
changes so we are estimated and so
 
03:42:56.750 --> 03:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
through fiscal year so by the end of
 
03:42:56.760 --> 03:42:57.530 align:start position:0%
through fiscal year so by the end of
um

03:42:57.530 --> 03:42:57.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:01.309 --> 03:43:01.319 align:start position:0%
to December 31st of 22 we have recorded
 
03:43:05.269 --> 03:43:05.279 align:start position:0%
about 17.2 million um and this is in a
 
03:43:06.830 --> 03:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
cash basis
 
03:43:10.190 --> 03:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
um that we we earned just by investing
 
03:43:13.429 --> 03:43:13.439 align:start position:0%
you know the funds and we expect that at
 
03:43:15.469 --> 03:43:15.479 align:start position:0%
least we'll probably see double that
 
03:43:17.090 --> 03:43:17.100 align:start position:0%
amount so we're estimating that for
 
03:43:19.670 --> 03:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
fiscal 23 we're probably going to see
 
03:43:21.469 --> 03:43:21.479 align:start position:0%
about 35 million
 
03:43:23.450 --> 03:43:23.460 align:start position:0%
is it is a conservative number it's
 
03:43:24.830 --> 03:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
possible that we'll receive more than
 
03:43:27.110 --> 03:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
that and then again in fiscal year 24
 
03:43:29.809 --> 03:43:29.819 align:start position:0%
and 25 we're also using conservative
 
03:43:33.170 --> 03:43:33.180 align:start position:0%
estimates but we expect about you know
 
03:43:35.330 --> 03:43:35.340 align:start position:0%
in a neighborhood of 31 million and 25
 
03:43:37.910 --> 03:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
another 24 million and again this is all
 
03:43:39.410 --> 03:43:39.420 align:start position:0%
going to be based on so we're making
 
03:43:41.929 --> 03:43:41.939 align:start position:0%
some some assumptions you know for
 
03:43:45.229 --> 03:43:45.239 align:start position:0%
example for 20 24 25 whereas we're
 
03:43:47.150 --> 03:43:47.160 align:start position:0%
making assumption that some of that
 
03:43:48.710 --> 03:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
those thorough funds are going to be
 
03:43:51.710 --> 03:43:51.720 align:start position:0%
spent so we're reducing those
 
03:43:54.170 --> 03:43:54.180 align:start position:0%
um you know average cash balances but
 
03:43:55.729 --> 03:43:55.739 align:start position:0%
we'll calculate
 
03:43:56.870 --> 03:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
um you know we're calculating the
 
03:44:00.650 --> 03:44:00.660 align:start position:0%
interest based on those assumptions
 
03:44:02.750 --> 03:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
um but again based on the interest rates
 
03:44:04.250 --> 03:44:04.260 align:start position:0%
and the expectation that the rates is
 
03:44:05.809 --> 03:44:05.819 align:start position:0%
going to stay about where they are right
 
03:44:11.090 --> 03:44:11.100 align:start position:0%
now we think that 20 24 25 will see some
 
03:44:14.269 --> 03:44:14.279 align:start position:0%
interest income being generated in the
 
03:44:17.510 --> 03:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
state can benefit will benefit from this
 
03:44:19.010 --> 03:44:19.020 align:start position:0%
and with that that concludes my
 
03:44:20.389 --> 03:44:20.399 align:start position:0%
presentation be happy to answer any
 
03:44:22.250 --> 03:44:22.260 align:start position:0%
other questions or anything that I
 
03:44:25.130 --> 03:44:25.140 align:start position:0%
didn't cover last time when we met
 
03:44:27.110 --> 03:44:27.120 align:start position:0%
I I have a general question so the
 
03:44:28.610 --> 03:44:28.620 align:start position:0%
interest rates you have here for example
 
03:44:32.210 --> 03:44:32.220 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 2023 four percent
 
03:44:34.190 --> 03:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
um the latest CD rate I just saw was
 
03:44:37.010 --> 03:44:37.020 align:start position:0%
about four percent are you is the state
 
03:44:39.170 --> 03:44:39.180 align:start position:0%
putting money in CDs or what do you do
 
03:44:41.690 --> 03:44:41.700 align:start position:0%
to get these interest rates yeah so we
 
03:44:44.510 --> 03:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
we're our um
 
03:44:47.210 --> 03:44:47.220 align:start position:0%
we are used in a variety the law allows
 
03:44:50.050 --> 03:44:50.060 align:start position:0%
us to invest in in a variety of
 
03:44:54.769 --> 03:44:54.779 align:start position:0%
types of security so we are we have
 
03:44:56.450 --> 03:44:56.460 align:start position:0%
we're your lesson right now an
 
03:44:58.429 --> 03:44:58.439 align:start position:0%
investment consultant that is helping us
 
03:45:00.050 --> 03:45:00.060 align:start position:0%
to manage all this fund the state has
 
03:45:02.570 --> 03:45:02.580 align:start position:0%
never really had well has never had this
 
03:45:05.269 --> 03:45:05.279 align:start position:0%
much money or excess money and access
 
03:45:05.279 --> 03:45:07.490 align:start position:0%
much money or excess money and access
um

03:45:07.490 --> 03:45:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:07.500 --> 03:45:10.010 align:start position:0%
 
essentially

03:45:10.010 --> 03:45:10.020 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
03:45:12.530 --> 03:45:12.540 align:start position:0%
money in excess of our operating you
 
03:45:14.990 --> 03:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
know what we need for operations so so
 
03:45:17.269 --> 03:45:17.279 align:start position:0%
we're investing we have positions and
 
03:45:20.510 --> 03:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
CDs we have uh positions we have U.S
 
03:45:23.750 --> 03:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
treasuries we are investing in U.S
 
03:45:25.610 --> 03:45:25.620 align:start position:0%
referral agencies
 
03:45:25.620 --> 03:45:26.510 align:start position:0%
referral agencies
um

03:45:26.510 --> 03:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:45:30.229 --> 03:45:30.239 align:start position:0%
we have mutual funds we are are using
 
03:45:32.030 --> 03:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
just our interest bearing accounts and
 
03:45:34.190 --> 03:45:34.200 align:start position:0%
we are have a diversified right now
 
03:45:36.950 --> 03:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
portfolio because we also need uh funds
 
03:45:39.950 --> 03:45:39.960 align:start position:0%
to be liquid to meet our our our needs
 
03:45:41.809 --> 03:45:41.819 align:start position:0%
and but we also know again if we're
 
03:45:43.370 --> 03:45:43.380 align:start position:0%
going to have some funds for several
 
03:45:45.410 --> 03:45:45.420 align:start position:0%
years we want to make sure that we take
 
03:45:47.090 --> 03:45:47.100 align:start position:0%
advantage of the higher interest rates
 
03:45:49.670 --> 03:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
and higher yields uh when we know we're
 
03:45:52.190 --> 03:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
not going to spend you know certain pots
 
03:45:54.889 --> 03:45:54.899 align:start position:0%
of money for one two three years so
 
03:45:56.510 --> 03:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
we're looking at that the other piece
 
03:45:58.490 --> 03:45:58.500 align:start position:0%
that has also helped to generate this
 
03:46:01.550 --> 03:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
fund this earnings is a rainy day fund
 
03:46:03.710 --> 03:46:03.720 align:start position:0%
so we invest a rainy day fund again with
 
03:46:06.790 --> 03:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
the time same type of diversification
 
03:46:09.469 --> 03:46:09.479 align:start position:0%
and all of the all of those earnings
 
03:46:11.870 --> 03:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
from the rainy day fund go directly to
 
03:46:14.210 --> 03:46:14.220 align:start position:0%
the general fund um per statue that
 
03:46:16.490 --> 03:46:16.500 align:start position:0%
needs to be credited to to the general
 
03:46:21.769 --> 03:46:21.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:24.710 --> 03:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
well representative spilsbury
 
03:46:26.630 --> 03:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:46:26.640 --> 03:46:27.650 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

03:46:27.650 --> 03:46:27.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:29.690 --> 03:46:29.700 align:start position:0%
I gather that the two billion dollars
 
03:46:32.630 --> 03:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
currently on hand is unusually large am
 
03:46:37.990 --> 03:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
I correctly understanding that the uh 78
 
03:46:41.389 --> 03:46:41.399 align:start position:0%
unexpected arpa funds are part of that 2
 
03:46:44.630 --> 03:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
billion they're in in that figure that
 
03:46:46.910 --> 03:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
is correct so it's about that a billion
 
03:46:48.710 --> 03:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
dollars that we have so that certainly
 
03:46:50.710 --> 03:46:50.720 align:start position:0%
accounts for a major
 
03:46:53.389 --> 03:46:53.399 align:start position:0%
degree to which they are greater than
 
03:46:53.399 --> 03:46:54.349 align:start position:0%
degree to which they are greater than
normal

03:46:54.349 --> 03:46:54.359 align:start position:0%
normal
 
03:46:58.429 --> 03:46:58.439 align:start position:0%
uh what is the minimum balance you
 
03:47:00.469 --> 03:47:00.479 align:start position:0%
generally expect to need
 
03:47:03.250 --> 03:47:03.260 align:start position:0%
just to meet the working capital
 
03:47:06.530 --> 03:47:06.540 align:start position:0%
demands of State cash flow
 
03:47:08.929 --> 03:47:08.939 align:start position:0%
that's a great question we just started
 
03:47:11.570 --> 03:47:11.580 align:start position:0%
um evaluating that a little more but it
 
03:47:13.550 --> 03:47:13.560 align:start position:0%
could be in the neighborhood of between
 
03:47:17.630 --> 03:47:17.640 align:start position:0%
300 million and 600 million also that
 
03:47:19.190 --> 03:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
also depends on you know when we have
 
03:47:20.889 --> 03:47:20.899 align:start position:0%
times when we are
 
03:47:23.809 --> 03:47:23.819 align:start position:0%
have good Revenue performance and as we
 
03:47:25.790 --> 03:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
see you know more funds being collected
 
03:47:28.250 --> 03:47:28.260 align:start position:0%
obviously that help us with the cushion
 
03:47:30.410 --> 03:47:30.420 align:start position:0%
but it could be in the neighborhood uh
 
03:47:33.530 --> 03:47:33.540 align:start position:0%
between 300 and 600 million and that's
 
03:47:35.090 --> 03:47:35.100 align:start position:0%
what we want to make sure we have liquid
 
03:47:37.610 --> 03:47:37.620 align:start position:0%
very liquid
 
03:47:41.150 --> 03:47:41.160 align:start position:0%
so in other words in an interest in an
 
03:47:42.530 --> 03:47:42.540 align:start position:0%
environment where interest rates are
 
03:47:45.170 --> 03:47:45.180 align:start position:0%
increasing we get a a bit of a bonus in
 
03:47:47.450 --> 03:47:47.460 align:start position:0%
terms of investment returns but you
 
03:47:49.670 --> 03:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
would need a major amount of money just
 
03:47:52.910 --> 03:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of managing liquidity that is
 
03:47:54.290 --> 03:47:54.300 align:start position:0%
the three to six hundred minutes that is
 
03:47:56.269 --> 03:47:56.279 align:start position:0%
correct but the good news is that we you
 
03:47:58.550 --> 03:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
know right now because of the the
 
03:48:00.790 --> 03:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
interest rates are higher so even
 
03:48:03.469 --> 03:48:03.479 align:start position:0%
maintaining our funds with in in
 
03:48:05.809 --> 03:48:05.819 align:start position:0%
interest bearing accounts or this you
 
03:48:07.910 --> 03:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
know sweep accounts products that we use
 
03:48:12.050 --> 03:48:12.060 align:start position:0%
we are we are seeing yields of you know
 
03:48:14.750 --> 03:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
about four percent three percent and
 
03:48:16.550 --> 03:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
that is perhaps it will keep moving
 
03:48:19.490 --> 03:48:19.500 align:start position:0%
because of the um the activity of the
 
03:48:21.050 --> 03:48:21.060 align:start position:0%
Federal Reserve so the federal received
 
03:48:23.929 --> 03:48:23.939 align:start position:0%
the followers are keeps raising rates uh
 
03:48:26.090 --> 03:48:26.100 align:start position:0%
we will see that even with those
 
03:48:27.590 --> 03:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
accounts where we need to maintain our
 
03:48:30.950 --> 03:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:36.050 --> 03:48:36.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:39.469 --> 03:48:39.479 align:start position:0%
all right any other questions
 
03:48:50.150 --> 03:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:52.550 --> 03:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I missed some of that but I'll
 
03:48:53.990 --> 03:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
make sure I read everything thoroughly
 
03:48:55.729 --> 03:48:55.739 align:start position:0%
so we have a little 10 minute stretch
 
03:48:59.090 --> 03:48:59.100 align:start position:0%
break before we begin go ahead we have
 
03:49:01.190 --> 03:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
Chris here unless unless ajs is here and
 
03:49:09.650 --> 03:49:09.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:17.090 --> 03:49:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:33.889 --> 03:49:33.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:36.290 --> 03:49:36.300 align:start position:0%
well we still have a caucus so don't
 
03:49:36.300 --> 03:49:40.809 align:start position:0%
well we still have a caucus so don't
leave

03:49:40.809 --> 03:49:40.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:47.929 --> 03:49:47.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:50.330 --> 03:49:50.340 align:start position:0%
so well thank you I just had a couple of
 
03:49:51.889 --> 03:49:51.899 align:start position:0%
things I just wanted to point out to the
 
03:49:53.630 --> 03:49:53.640 align:start position:0%
committee so the treasurer was just
 
03:49:55.969 --> 03:49:55.979 align:start position:0%
presenting to you the interest on page
 
03:49:59.210 --> 03:49:59.220 align:start position:0%
12 of our document you'll see 23 is 35
 
03:50:02.570 --> 03:50:02.580 align:start position:0%
million dollars potential 24 is 31 and
 
03:50:05.450 --> 03:50:05.460 align:start position:0%
25 is for 24 million
 
03:50:07.190 --> 03:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
if you look at what the Comptroller
 
03:50:09.950 --> 03:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
provided in her document on page seven
 
03:50:11.990 --> 03:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
row 29
 
03:50:13.729 --> 03:50:13.739 align:start position:0%
which is the interest and surplus line
 
03:50:15.830 --> 03:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
for Treasury
 
03:50:18.590 --> 03:50:18.600 align:start position:0%
you'll note that those numbers are blank
 
03:50:20.630 --> 03:50:20.640 align:start position:0%
so you when you're considering your
 
03:50:22.929 --> 03:50:22.939 align:start position:0%
other Revenue you may want to include
 
03:50:24.889 --> 03:50:24.899 align:start position:0%
these interest numbers that the
 
03:50:27.769 --> 03:50:27.779 align:start position:0%
treasurer provided you
 
03:50:29.710 --> 03:50:29.720 align:start position:0%
so for example
 
03:50:34.309 --> 03:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
the projected revenue for 23 is 76
 
03:50:36.469 --> 03:50:36.479 align:start position:0%
million dollars you may want to add
 
03:50:39.110 --> 03:50:39.120 align:start position:0%
another 35 million to that to be closer
 
03:50:40.910 --> 03:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
to what's projected should be projected
 
03:50:53.929 --> 03:50:53.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:56.030 --> 03:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
if you want me to repeat that I can if I
 
03:50:56.040 --> 03:50:56.809 align:start position:0%
if you want me to repeat that I can if I
was

03:50:56.809 --> 03:50:56.819 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:50:59.570 --> 03:50:59.580 align:start position:0%
too quick on you but it's page seven of
 
03:51:01.849 --> 03:51:01.859 align:start position:0%
the comptroller's document
 
03:51:04.670 --> 03:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
line 29
 
03:51:06.170 --> 03:51:06.180 align:start position:0%
that is the line that has the interest
 
03:51:11.450 --> 03:51:11.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:13.610 --> 03:51:13.620 align:start position:0%
the treasurer presented on page 12 of
 
03:51:16.309 --> 03:51:16.319 align:start position:0%
her document what they project would be
 
03:51:19.550 --> 03:51:19.560 align:start position:0%
general fund interest potential so again
 
03:51:21.229 --> 03:51:21.239 align:start position:0%
you would want to add that to the those
 
03:51:23.150 --> 03:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
two numbers yeah you want to add the
 
03:51:25.250 --> 03:51:25.260 align:start position:0%
treasures numbers to the comptroller's
 
03:51:27.429 --> 03:51:27.439 align:start position:0%
number to get a truer other estimate
 
03:51:30.229 --> 03:51:30.239 align:start position:0%
could you add this to your spreadsheet
 
03:51:31.969 --> 03:51:31.979 align:start position:0%
but break it out so that we can think
 
03:51:34.849 --> 03:51:34.859 align:start position:0%
about it okay yep thank you and the
 
03:51:36.170 --> 03:51:36.180 align:start position:0%
other there's two other things I just
 
03:51:37.610 --> 03:51:37.620 align:start position:0%
wanted to touch base with when the
 
03:51:40.429 --> 03:51:40.439 align:start position:0%
Comptroller was up she mentioned that at
 
03:51:41.870 --> 03:51:41.880 align:start position:0%
the end of the budget process they take
 
03:51:43.550 --> 03:51:43.560 align:start position:0%
all the information and come up with a
 
03:51:44.630 --> 03:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
revenue plan
 
03:51:45.950 --> 03:51:45.960 align:start position:0%
when they're doing that they consider
 
03:51:49.729 --> 03:51:49.739 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 changes and as I've
 
03:51:51.590 --> 03:51:51.600 align:start position:0%
told this committee that if there's
 
03:51:53.870 --> 03:51:53.880 align:start position:0%
changes to revenue throughout this
 
03:51:56.090 --> 03:51:56.100 align:start position:0%
session we carry it on the Surplus
 
03:51:58.370 --> 03:51:58.380 align:start position:0%
statement and the Comptroller will
 
03:52:00.050 --> 03:52:00.060 align:start position:0%
consider that as they do the revenue
 
03:52:00.060 --> 03:52:01.070 align:start position:0%
consider that as they do the revenue
plan

03:52:01.070 --> 03:52:01.080 align:start position:0%
plan
 
03:52:03.290 --> 03:52:03.300 align:start position:0%
going forward after the budget set has
 
03:52:05.410 --> 03:52:05.420 align:start position:0%
been adopted and passed
 
03:52:08.870 --> 03:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
if there's changes in the next session
 
03:52:11.090 --> 03:52:11.100 align:start position:0%
that impact Revenue it's not going to
 
03:52:13.790 --> 03:52:13.800 align:start position:0%
change your Revenue plan that that plan
 
03:52:16.729 --> 03:52:16.739 align:start position:0%
stays the same the Comptroller may make
 
03:52:19.969 --> 03:52:19.979 align:start position:0%
a note on the revenue Focus that there's
 
03:52:22.190 --> 03:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
some impact of Revenue that's as a
 
03:52:24.469 --> 03:52:24.479 align:start position:0%
result of a bill or some other action
 
03:52:27.110 --> 03:52:27.120 align:start position:0%
that may have occurred so I just like to
 
03:52:28.670 --> 03:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
say that because I get that question
 
03:52:30.110 --> 03:52:30.120 align:start position:0%
throughout the process about you know
 
03:52:31.729 --> 03:52:31.739 align:start position:0%
who's tracking these changes that we
 
03:52:34.370 --> 03:52:34.380 align:start position:0%
support it's like it does get caught for
 
03:52:36.050 --> 03:52:36.060 align:start position:0%
this cycle right so as you're building
 
03:52:37.670 --> 03:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
the budget and your Revenue estimates
 
03:52:39.650 --> 03:52:39.660 align:start position:0%
but in the next session if there's any
 
03:52:42.349 --> 03:52:42.359 align:start position:0%
changes to that impact Revenue those
 
03:52:44.990 --> 03:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
don't change your official Revenue plan
 
03:52:47.990 --> 03:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
because the the unrestricted estimates
 
03:52:49.729 --> 03:52:49.739 align:start position:0%
and the PLA and the budget have been
 
03:52:51.830 --> 03:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
kind of adopted through the
 
03:52:54.050 --> 03:52:54.060 align:start position:0%
um chapter law that's put it enacted
 
03:52:56.269 --> 03:52:56.279 align:start position:0%
and then the last thing
 
03:52:57.469 --> 03:52:57.479 align:start position:0%
representative Dames had a question
 
03:52:59.870 --> 03:52:59.880 align:start position:0%
about the arpa funds so our office
 
03:53:02.750 --> 03:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
tracks what's been allocated but we
 
03:53:04.309 --> 03:53:04.319 align:start position:0%
can't track what's been expended because
 
03:53:06.050 --> 03:53:06.060 align:start position:0%
we don't know
 
03:53:08.090 --> 03:53:08.100 align:start position:0%
um gopher which is the governor's office
 
03:53:10.130 --> 03:53:10.140 align:start position:0%
that has been tracking cares money as
 
03:53:11.570 --> 03:53:11.580 align:start position:0%
well as the arpa money
 
03:53:13.610 --> 03:53:13.620 align:start position:0%
is in charge of or responsible for
 
03:53:15.050 --> 03:53:15.060 align:start position:0%
tracking the actual expenditures
 
03:53:16.429 --> 03:53:16.439 align:start position:0%
associated with that because they need
 
03:53:18.950 --> 03:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
to report back to the federal government
 
03:53:20.510 --> 03:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
um we have made a request of them to
 
03:53:21.950 --> 03:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
find out where we're at with the
 
03:53:24.349 --> 03:53:24.359 align:start position:0%
expenses we haven't gotten an answer to
 
03:53:26.389 --> 03:53:26.399 align:start position:0%
that question yet
 
03:53:26.399 --> 03:53:27.710 align:start position:0%
that question yet
um

03:53:27.710 --> 03:53:27.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:30.050 --> 03:53:30.060 align:start position:0%
but it does we do have a sheet that we
 
03:53:32.210 --> 03:53:32.220 align:start position:0%
track we could provide to you that would
 
03:53:33.830 --> 03:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
show you what's been allocated and where
 
03:53:35.210 --> 03:53:35.220 align:start position:0%
it's been allocated
 
03:53:38.330 --> 03:53:38.340 align:start position:0%
gopher also has a on their website a um
 
03:53:40.729 --> 03:53:40.739 align:start position:0%
a graph that the colorful graph that
 
03:53:41.929 --> 03:53:41.939 align:start position:0%
kind of shows you what's been allocated
 
03:53:43.790 --> 03:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
and then but below that they'll show you
 
03:53:46.910 --> 03:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
by category it's a water appropriated or
 
03:53:49.070 --> 03:53:49.080 align:start position:0%
it's housing appropriation or its
 
03:53:51.229 --> 03:53:51.239 align:start position:0%
Recreation appropriation and it'll tie
 
03:53:53.870 --> 03:53:53.880 align:start position:0%
back to a fiscal committee item
 
03:53:55.729 --> 03:53:55.739 align:start position:0%
um so again I can forward those links to
 
03:53:59.330 --> 03:53:59.340 align:start position:0%
you just so you can look at that
 
03:54:01.550 --> 03:54:01.560 align:start position:0%
representative Ames
 
03:54:03.769 --> 03:54:03.779 align:start position:0%
that's helpful um
 
03:54:06.170 --> 03:54:06.180 align:start position:0%
I guess I I'm wondering
 
03:54:09.469 --> 03:54:09.479 align:start position:0%
um when you expect to receive an answer
 
03:54:13.729 --> 03:54:13.739 align:start position:0%
to your request about spending and uh
 
03:54:16.729 --> 03:54:16.739 align:start position:0%
when you started asking
 
03:54:19.670 --> 03:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
um so we started earlier in the fall and
 
03:54:21.710 --> 03:54:21.720 align:start position:0%
we haven't gotten anything yet I don't
 
03:54:24.469 --> 03:54:24.479 align:start position:0%
know when to expect anything
 
03:54:27.050 --> 03:54:27.060 align:start position:0%
um there was a report that
 
03:54:28.729 --> 03:54:28.739 align:start position:0%
I think it was a September report we
 
03:54:30.290 --> 03:54:30.300 align:start position:0%
asked after that to get another update
 
03:54:32.030 --> 03:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
because there was additional uh
 
03:54:34.189 --> 03:54:34.199 align:start position:0%
Appropriations made through fiscal
 
03:54:35.929 --> 03:54:35.939 align:start position:0%
committee and because they had that same
 
03:54:37.849 --> 03:54:37.859 align:start position:0%
type of question
 
03:54:39.889 --> 03:54:39.899 align:start position:0%
um but we again we haven't received that
 
03:54:43.130 --> 03:54:43.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:45.410 --> 03:54:45.420 align:start position:0%
representative almi yep
 
03:54:46.670 --> 03:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:54:49.130 --> 03:54:49.140 align:start position:0%
does this mean that
 
03:54:49.140 --> 03:54:50.929 align:start position:0%
does this mean that
potentially

03:54:50.929 --> 03:54:50.939 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
03:54:54.790 --> 03:54:54.800 align:start position:0%
in two years in in in
 
03:54:57.469 --> 03:54:57.479 align:start position:0%
2026 on
 
03:55:00.830 --> 03:55:00.840 align:start position:0%
we could find that like half the money
 
03:55:04.010 --> 03:55:04.020 align:start position:0%
was actually expended
 
03:55:06.050 --> 03:55:06.060 align:start position:0%
I suspect not because I believe Gophers
 
03:55:08.210 --> 03:55:08.220 align:start position:0%
keeping a pretty good eye on that and
 
03:55:09.530 --> 03:55:09.540 align:start position:0%
what they'll do and they have done
 
03:55:11.269 --> 03:55:11.279 align:start position:0%
through fiscals they come in and
 
03:55:13.849 --> 03:55:13.859 align:start position:0%
reallocate funds so if an agency came in
 
03:55:16.790 --> 03:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
and had an idea to do something
 
03:55:18.769 --> 03:55:18.779 align:start position:0%
and they were out we'll just make it up
 
03:55:19.969 --> 03:55:19.979 align:start position:0%
but just say they were given five
 
03:55:23.269 --> 03:55:23.279 align:start position:0%
million dollars to accomplish Project X
 
03:55:24.889 --> 03:55:24.899 align:start position:0%
as they move forward in trying to do
 
03:55:27.410 --> 03:55:27.420 align:start position:0%
Project X they realize that that we
 
03:55:29.389 --> 03:55:29.399 align:start position:0%
don't need 5 million or we can't do it
 
03:55:32.750 --> 03:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
they would notify gopher and say you let
 
03:55:34.429 --> 03:55:34.439 align:start position:0%
us use 5 million we can't do the project
 
03:55:36.650 --> 03:55:36.660 align:start position:0%
we thought we could do so you can have
 
03:55:38.330 --> 03:55:38.340 align:start position:0%
that back and then they would reallocate
 
03:55:39.830 --> 03:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
it but they're tracking that and that's
 
03:55:41.570 --> 03:55:41.580 align:start position:0%
what makes part of the
 
03:55:43.370 --> 03:55:43.380 align:start position:0%
um the expenditure question difficult
 
03:55:45.349 --> 03:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
because the agencies it's not immediate
 
03:55:47.689 --> 03:55:47.699 align:start position:0%
they may be allocated some funds to do
 
03:55:49.250 --> 03:55:49.260 align:start position:0%
something it may take them several
 
03:55:51.170 --> 03:55:51.180 align:start position:0%
months to determine if they can really
 
03:55:53.210 --> 03:55:53.220 align:start position:0%
accomplish that with the appropriation
 
03:55:54.769 --> 03:55:54.779 align:start position:0%
that's been provided and they may run
 
03:55:57.769 --> 03:55:57.779 align:start position:0%
into other issues such as permitting or
 
03:56:00.050 --> 03:56:00.060 align:start position:0%
Personnel or materials or whatever it
 
03:56:02.090 --> 03:56:02.100 align:start position:0%
might be that keep them from from doing
 
03:56:04.670 --> 03:56:04.680 align:start position:0%
that but again go for
 
03:56:07.130 --> 03:56:07.140 align:start position:0%
I would suggest gopher will try to
 
03:56:08.389 --> 03:56:08.399 align:start position:0%
expend as much of the money that's been
 
03:56:10.790 --> 03:56:10.800 align:start position:0%
allocated to the state or make sure that
 
03:56:12.590 --> 03:56:12.600 align:start position:0%
it gets spent they don't necessarily do
 
03:56:13.790 --> 03:56:13.800 align:start position:0%
the direct spend but they would try to
 
03:56:15.229 --> 03:56:15.239 align:start position:0%
make sure it could spend before it has
 
03:56:16.969 --> 03:56:16.979 align:start position:0%
to go back to the federal government
 
03:56:19.729 --> 03:56:19.739 align:start position:0%
representative fellows has a question
 
03:56:23.150 --> 03:56:23.160 align:start position:0%
so oh oh dear
 
03:56:25.309 --> 03:56:25.319 align:start position:0%
in terms of in terms of what we're just
 
03:56:28.250 --> 03:56:28.260 align:start position:0%
been talking about I mean I will the
 
03:56:31.670 --> 03:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
single audit get through Identify some
 
03:56:33.710 --> 03:56:33.720 align:start position:0%
of this I know that's only through the
 
03:56:37.910 --> 03:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
end of end of June but will that help
 
03:56:40.309 --> 03:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
yes I was going to just mention to Chris
 
03:56:43.130 --> 03:56:43.140 align:start position:0%
that and my office prepares the audit
 
03:56:45.070 --> 03:56:45.080 align:start position:0%
report of all the federal financial
 
03:56:47.990 --> 03:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
awards that have been spent based on the
 
03:56:50.630 --> 03:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
year they were spent so you're correct
 
03:56:52.729 --> 03:56:52.739 align:start position:0%
we are currently preparing the single
 
03:56:56.689 --> 03:56:56.699 align:start position:0%
audit for fiscal year 22. it has a March
 
03:56:59.389 --> 03:56:59.399 align:start position:0%
deadline so it's it's a nine month
 
03:57:01.070 --> 03:57:01.080 align:start position:0%
process rather than the act for which is
 
03:57:04.670 --> 03:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
a six-month process so it takes a while
 
03:57:07.729 --> 03:57:07.739 align:start position:0%
it is fully audited by KPMG which is our
 
03:57:09.830 --> 03:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
external audit firm so they're auditing
 
03:57:12.349 --> 03:57:12.359 align:start position:0%
the arpa funds amongst all of the other
 
03:57:15.830 --> 03:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
Federal programs Medicaid everything and
 
03:57:19.010 --> 03:57:19.020 align:start position:0%
so that report while there's a lag it
 
03:57:21.349 --> 03:57:21.359 align:start position:0%
it's based on the time spent so every
 
03:57:24.110 --> 03:57:24.120 align:start position:0%
dollar that is spent is being reflected
 
03:57:27.229 --> 03:57:27.239 align:start position:0%
in that annual single audit report for
 
03:57:28.910 --> 03:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
the year it was spent so there will be
 
03:57:31.250 --> 03:57:31.260 align:start position:0%
multiple years of this that you'll see
 
03:57:34.189 --> 03:57:34.199 align:start position:0%
that spend take place but you can be
 
03:57:36.410 --> 03:57:36.420 align:start position:0%
assured that it's being reported on by
 
03:57:38.330 --> 03:57:38.340 align:start position:0%
Das and audited
 
03:57:41.210 --> 03:57:41.220 align:start position:0%
each year so it won't give you the level
 
03:57:42.830 --> 03:57:42.840 align:start position:0%
of detail that you're looking for
 
03:57:45.530 --> 03:57:45.540 align:start position:0%
programmatically it will be this the
 
03:57:47.450 --> 03:57:47.460 align:start position:0%
state fiscal recovery funds will be in
 
03:57:50.570 --> 03:57:50.580 align:start position:0%
one line item but obviously there's a
 
03:57:52.849 --> 03:57:52.859 align:start position:0%
multitude of detailed reports uh that
 
03:57:57.769 --> 03:57:57.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:59.510 --> 03:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
representative almonds
 
03:58:02.570 --> 03:58:02.580 align:start position:0%
yes I'm still quite trying
 
03:58:04.849 --> 03:58:04.859 align:start position:0%
I never have wrapped my head around how
 
03:58:06.710 --> 03:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
I can find out enough about the budget
 
03:58:11.030 --> 03:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
to suit myself but on does
 
03:58:11.040 --> 03:58:12.349 align:start position:0%
to suit myself but on does
uh

03:58:12.349 --> 03:58:12.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:58:15.590 --> 03:58:15.600 align:start position:0%
does that mean that the finance
 
03:58:17.570 --> 03:58:17.580 align:start position:0%
committee at least or the fiscal
 
03:58:22.130 --> 03:58:22.140 align:start position:0%
committee gets a annual report on how
 
03:58:26.030 --> 03:58:26.040 align:start position:0%
much spending has been done and is left
 
03:58:27.650 --> 03:58:27.660 align:start position:0%
to do
 
03:58:27.660 --> 03:58:29.150 align:start position:0%
to do
in

03:58:29.150 --> 03:58:29.160 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:58:33.050 --> 03:58:33.060 align:start position:0%
in those on different stimulus packages
 
03:58:37.729 --> 03:58:37.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:40.309 --> 03:58:40.319 align:start position:0%
through that report that Dana was just
 
03:58:42.469 --> 03:58:42.479 align:start position:0%
talking about yes but on a more finite
 
03:58:44.210 --> 03:58:44.220 align:start position:0%
detail you know if you're thinking
 
03:58:46.189 --> 03:58:46.199 align:start position:0%
programmatically as an agency coming in
 
03:58:47.750 --> 03:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
and reporting to fiscal or Finance
 
03:58:50.750 --> 03:58:50.760 align:start position:0%
that's not happening
 
03:58:54.530 --> 03:58:54.540 align:start position:0%
yeah so if I'm interested in housing in
 
03:58:56.809 --> 03:58:56.819 align:start position:0%
particular I'm never going to know
 
03:58:59.090 --> 03:58:59.100 align:start position:0%
for instance
 
03:59:00.830 --> 03:59:00.840 align:start position:0%
so if you were interested in
 
03:59:00.840 --> 03:59:01.510 align:start position:0%
so if you were interested in
um

03:59:01.510 --> 03:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:04.429 --> 03:59:04.439 align:start position:0%
I mean I I think that I've actually sat
 
03:59:07.250 --> 03:59:07.260 align:start position:0%
in this room at times when a fiscal
 
03:59:09.410 --> 03:59:09.420 align:start position:0%
committee has requested that a
 
03:59:12.110 --> 03:59:12.120 align:start position:0%
particular agency present on their
 
03:59:14.990 --> 03:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
programs so it can be requested the the
 
03:59:19.809 --> 03:59:19.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:22.429 --> 03:59:22.439 align:start position:0%
reporting representative Oliver you
 
03:59:25.309 --> 03:59:25.319 align:start position:0%
think right yep uh thank you madam chair
 
03:59:27.349 --> 03:59:27.359 align:start position:0%
and I don't know
 
03:59:29.750 --> 03:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
where this is going to go but
 
03:59:33.290 --> 03:59:33.300 align:start position:0%
individual programming is interesting
 
03:59:36.349 --> 03:59:36.359 align:start position:0%
but not necessary for us to come up with
 
03:59:40.309 --> 03:59:40.319 align:start position:0%
a resolution regarding our revenues I
 
03:59:43.189 --> 03:59:43.199 align:start position:0%
don't correct me if I'm wrong somebody
 
03:59:45.530 --> 03:59:45.540 align:start position:0%
correct me please I don't think it's
 
03:59:48.290 --> 03:59:48.300 align:start position:0%
necessary it's interesting and it's very
 
03:59:48.300 --> 03:59:49.729 align:start position:0%
necessary it's interesting and it's very
useful

03:59:49.729 --> 03:59:49.739 align:start position:0%
useful
 
03:59:51.710 --> 03:59:51.720 align:start position:0%
but getting
 
03:59:54.670 --> 03:59:54.680 align:start position:0%
the amount of money that is
 
03:59:56.689 --> 03:59:56.699 align:start position:0%
still available
 
03:59:56.699 --> 03:59:59.030 align:start position:0%
still available
unencumbered

03:59:59.030 --> 03:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
unencumbered
 
04:00:02.809 --> 04:00:02.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:06.290 --> 04:00:06.300 align:start position:0%
I'm getting confused and
 
04:00:09.469 --> 04:00:09.479 align:start position:0%
unencumbered monies is for us to come up
 
04:00:11.150 --> 04:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
with the budget we can spend this much
 
04:00:12.830 --> 04:00:12.840 align:start position:0%
from federal money we can spend this
 
04:00:16.070 --> 04:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
much from uh tax revenues and this much
 
04:00:18.170 --> 04:00:18.180 align:start position:0%
from fee revenues
 
04:00:21.830 --> 04:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
is are those figures available so with
 
04:00:25.429 --> 04:00:25.439 align:start position:0%
arpa it's outside of the budget process
 
04:00:27.410 --> 04:00:27.420 align:start position:0%
so those federal dollars are being
 
04:00:27.420 --> 04:00:28.670 align:start position:0%
so those federal dollars are being
allocated

04:00:28.670 --> 04:00:28.680 align:start position:0%
allocated
 
04:00:31.490 --> 04:00:31.500 align:start position:0%
through fiscal committee and that's been
 
04:00:33.229 --> 04:00:33.239 align:start position:0%
intentionally done that way
 
04:00:34.670 --> 04:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
I don't believe
 
04:00:34.680 --> 04:00:36.050 align:start position:0%
I don't believe
um

04:00:36.050 --> 04:00:36.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:37.429 --> 04:00:37.439 align:start position:0%
I don't believe
 
04:00:39.170 --> 04:00:39.180 align:start position:0%
having not seen the governor's budget I
 
04:00:40.429 --> 04:00:40.439 align:start position:0%
don't believe it's going to be included
 
04:00:42.590 --> 04:00:42.600 align:start position:0%
in agencies budgets because it's funding
 
04:00:45.349 --> 04:00:45.359 align:start position:0%
that is short-term they may have it for
 
04:00:47.450 --> 04:00:47.460 align:start position:0%
through 26 but it's not something that's
 
04:00:49.969 --> 04:00:49.979 align:start position:0%
going to be happening year after year so
 
04:00:51.530 --> 04:00:51.540 align:start position:0%
I think the real reason that's been
 
04:00:53.330 --> 04:00:53.340 align:start position:0%
discussed here today and how it impacts
 
04:00:55.250 --> 04:00:55.260 align:start position:0%
this committee is when you start looking
 
04:00:58.370 --> 04:00:58.380 align:start position:0%
at the interest Revenue potential on the
 
04:01:00.769 --> 04:01:00.779 align:start position:0%
general fund because the treasurer is
 
04:01:03.170 --> 04:01:03.180 align:start position:0%
able to invest those dollars that
 
04:01:05.510 --> 04:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
haven't been committed yet and are going
 
04:01:07.729 --> 04:01:07.739 align:start position:0%
to be spent within a certain time and
 
04:01:09.530 --> 04:01:09.540 align:start position:0%
from that she's able to earn interest
 
04:01:12.650 --> 04:01:12.660 align:start position:0%
for the State of New Hampshire
 
04:01:14.389 --> 04:01:14.399 align:start position:0%
that is then deposited into the general
 
04:01:14.399 --> 04:01:15.710 align:start position:0%
that is then deposited into the general
fund

04:01:15.710 --> 04:01:15.720 align:start position:0%
fund
 
04:01:17.990 --> 04:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
okay so representative fellows
 
04:01:18.000 --> 04:01:20.510 align:start position:0%
okay so representative fellows
next

04:01:20.510 --> 04:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
next
 
04:01:23.290 --> 04:01:23.300 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure that I don't
 
04:01:26.809 --> 04:01:26.819 align:start position:0%
assume something that's not true
 
04:01:29.630 --> 04:01:29.640 align:start position:0%
aren't some of the arpa funds directly
 
04:01:32.150 --> 04:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
to a state agency for example the U.S
 
04:01:34.309 --> 04:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to the State
 
04:01:36.349 --> 04:01:36.359 align:start position:0%
Department of Education or are you
 
04:01:39.650 --> 04:01:39.660 align:start position:0%
saying all of including that
 
04:01:42.830 --> 04:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
goes through gopher
 
04:01:44.809 --> 04:01:44.819 align:start position:0%
the state recovery dollars goes through
 
04:01:46.429 --> 04:01:46.439 align:start position:0%
gopher there are direct Appropriations
 
04:01:49.490 --> 04:01:49.500 align:start position:0%
to agencies for various programs
 
04:01:53.630 --> 04:01:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:53.640 --> 04:01:55.370 align:start position:0%
 
the

04:01:55.370 --> 04:01:55.380 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:01:57.650 --> 04:01:57.660 align:start position:0%
are you much much of that money won't be
 
04:01:58.729 --> 04:01:58.739 align:start position:0%
in the budget but there are some
 
04:02:00.650 --> 04:02:00.660 align:start position:0%
agencies that it's an existing program
 
04:02:02.510 --> 04:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
where maybe it was enhanced through arpa
 
04:02:04.429 --> 04:02:04.439 align:start position:0%
that may go through the budget but again
 
04:02:07.010 --> 04:02:07.020 align:start position:0%
it's not the the state
 
04:02:07.020 --> 04:02:08.929 align:start position:0%
it's not the the state
um

04:02:08.929 --> 04:02:08.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:13.250 --> 04:02:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:13.260 --> 04:02:14.990 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:02:14.990 --> 04:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:02:17.330 --> 04:02:17.340 align:start position:0%
um am I hearing that
 
04:02:21.229 --> 04:02:21.239 align:start position:0%
when I hear about a certain program that
 
04:02:23.269 --> 04:02:23.279 align:start position:0%
the recently there was an announcement
 
04:02:25.070 --> 04:02:25.080 align:start position:0%
about the State Department of Education
 
04:02:27.729 --> 04:02:27.739 align:start position:0%
using Federal
 
04:02:31.429 --> 04:02:31.439 align:start position:0%
arpa related money for I think it was
 
04:02:35.689 --> 04:02:35.699 align:start position:0%
online tutoring so do I not really know
 
04:02:37.729 --> 04:02:37.739 align:start position:0%
if that was directly from the Department
 
04:02:39.950 --> 04:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
of Education U.S Department of Education
 
04:02:42.650 --> 04:02:42.660 align:start position:0%
to our ours or it could have been go for
 
04:02:44.929 --> 04:02:44.939 align:start position:0%
money that came through gopher is that
 
04:02:46.790 --> 04:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
the situation
 
04:02:49.130 --> 04:02:49.140 align:start position:0%
that's correct I mean I would if there
 
04:02:50.389 --> 04:02:50.399 align:start position:0%
was a source that you were wondering
 
04:02:52.610 --> 04:02:52.620 align:start position:0%
about I would have to check and see what
 
04:02:54.410 --> 04:02:54.420 align:start position:0%
you know where it came from was it a
 
04:02:56.809 --> 04:02:56.819 align:start position:0%
direct from the U.S doe or was it from
 
04:02:59.809 --> 04:02:59.819 align:start position:0%
some other agency
 
04:03:01.790 --> 04:03:01.800 align:start position:0%
okay I just want to make sure I don't
 
04:03:04.130 --> 04:03:04.140 align:start position:0%
miss anyone on this side of the room any
 
04:03:06.229 --> 04:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
questions over here okay back to this
 
04:03:09.830 --> 04:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:14.269 --> 04:03:14.279 align:start position:0%
on I think that it is of importance to
 
04:03:18.290 --> 04:03:18.300 align:start position:0%
this committee to have an idea of
 
04:03:21.710 --> 04:03:21.720 align:start position:0%
whether the massive stimulus funds that
 
04:03:24.950 --> 04:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
came in are being spent
 
04:03:28.849 --> 04:03:28.859 align:start position:0%
on now or are going to be spent three
 
04:03:31.030 --> 04:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
years from now or never
 
04:03:33.889 --> 04:03:33.899 align:start position:0%
because they are supposed to be
 
04:03:36.170 --> 04:03:36.180 align:start position:0%
stimulating the economy and that is
 
04:03:42.469 --> 04:03:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:45.370 --> 04:03:45.380 align:start position:0%
and I'll just put that out as a
 
04:03:47.210 --> 04:03:47.220 align:start position:0%
discussion point
 
04:03:49.250 --> 04:03:49.260 align:start position:0%
well again we can provide you the links
 
04:03:51.469 --> 04:03:51.479 align:start position:0%
to the Gophers site where their reports
 
04:03:53.510 --> 04:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
are we can provide you with the fiscal
 
04:03:56.030 --> 04:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
committee report is
 
04:03:57.950 --> 04:03:57.960 align:start position:0%
you may want to ask gopher to come sit
 
04:04:00.290 --> 04:04:00.300 align:start position:0%
before the committee and explain you
 
04:04:01.849 --> 04:04:01.859 align:start position:0%
know how they allocate and track what's
 
04:04:01.859 --> 04:04:03.050 align:start position:0%
know how they allocate and track what's
expended

04:04:03.050 --> 04:04:03.060 align:start position:0%
expended
 
04:04:06.349 --> 04:04:06.359 align:start position:0%
if that seems appropriate but
 
04:04:08.510 --> 04:04:08.520 align:start position:0%
I don't have that answer I don't think
 
04:04:10.490 --> 04:04:10.500 align:start position:0%
the Comptroller has that answer at this
 
04:04:12.830 --> 04:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
point and in terms of the spend rate
 
04:04:15.170 --> 04:04:15.180 align:start position:0%
once an appropriation has been made or
 
04:04:18.050 --> 04:04:18.060 align:start position:0%
an allocation has been made
 
04:04:19.610 --> 04:04:19.620 align:start position:0%
because I think it's going to vary on
 
04:04:21.530 --> 04:04:21.540 align:start position:0%
the programs and and what how the
 
04:04:28.849 --> 04:04:28.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:30.469 --> 04:04:30.479 align:start position:0%
all right are we good on this right now
 
04:04:33.469 --> 04:04:33.479 align:start position:0%
sure yeah oh representative Ames sorry I
 
04:04:36.050 --> 04:04:36.060 align:start position:0%
just like to say that I I would for one
 
04:04:39.110 --> 04:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
appreciate getting that those those
 
04:04:43.130 --> 04:04:43.140 align:start position:0%
references that you you just mentioned
 
04:04:46.969 --> 04:04:46.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:49.849 --> 04:04:49.859 align:start position:0%
I'll make sure the committee gets them
 
04:04:52.130 --> 04:04:52.140 align:start position:0%
excellent but those extracurricular make
 
04:04:55.070 --> 04:04:55.080 align:start position:0%
sure you do your base work first
 
04:04:57.950 --> 04:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
that is spending we are Revenue we have
 
04:05:01.490 --> 04:05:01.500 align:start position:0%
to focus on our bills and our task first
 
04:05:03.590 --> 04:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
and then if we have free time we can
 
04:05:04.969 --> 04:05:04.979 align:start position:0%
play with other things
 
04:05:08.389 --> 04:05:08.399 align:start position:0%
okay clean up our sandbox
 
04:05:08.399 --> 04:05:09.650 align:start position:0%
okay clean up our sandbox
um

04:05:09.650 --> 04:05:09.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:12.769 --> 04:05:12.779 align:start position:0%

and today I'm here joined by
 
04:06:08.450 --> 04:06:08.460 align:start position:0%
Meredith Telus director of program
 
04:06:11.389 --> 04:06:11.399 align:start position:0%
quality and integrity
 
04:06:14.150 --> 04:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
and attorney Janelle Le Legion general

04:06:26.450 --> 04:06:26.460 align:start position:0%
and we are here today to provide you an
 
04:06:29.689 --> 04:06:29.699 align:start position:0%
overview of the Medicaid recoveries
 
04:06:32.210 --> 04:06:32.220 align:start position:0%
um before you is a presentation that we
 
04:06:33.530 --> 04:06:33.540 align:start position:0%
put together
 
04:06:37.309 --> 04:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
um on page two uh all of the high level
 
04:06:39.410 --> 04:06:39.420 align:start position:0%
projections for both state fiscal year
 
04:06:43.189 --> 04:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
23 and what what we are predicting for
 
04:06:46.429 --> 04:06:46.439 align:start position:0%
24 and 25 we have listed out there for
 
04:06:48.170 --> 04:06:48.180 align:start position:0%
today's presentation
 
04:06:50.809 --> 04:06:50.819 align:start position:0%
um Meredith and Janelle are here to go
 
04:06:52.610 --> 04:06:52.620 align:start position:0%
through each one of these to talk a
 
04:06:55.729 --> 04:06:55.739 align:start position:0%
little bit about child support talk a
 
04:06:56.809 --> 04:06:56.819 align:start position:0%
little bit about Medicaid estate
 
04:06:59.150 --> 04:06:59.160 align:start position:0%
recoveries and just to talk about some
 
04:07:00.889 --> 04:07:00.899 align:start position:0%
of the variations that you may see from
 
04:07:04.849 --> 04:07:04.859 align:start position:0%
year to year overall recoveries there
 
04:07:06.590 --> 04:07:06.600 align:start position:0%
are some elements that we can control
 
04:07:09.349 --> 04:07:09.359 align:start position:0%
when when predicting and projecting what
 
04:07:12.710 --> 04:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
we anticipate to be the revenues coming
 
04:07:14.330 --> 04:07:14.340 align:start position:0%
in from that but there are also a
 
04:07:16.370 --> 04:07:16.380 align:start position:0%
variety of external factors for which we
 
04:07:18.830 --> 04:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
cannot control so from one year to the
 
04:07:20.750 --> 04:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
next depending upon the type of recovery
 
04:07:23.389 --> 04:07:23.399 align:start position:0%
you may see some large swings just due
 
04:07:23.399 --> 04:07:24.830 align:start position:0%
you may see some large swings just due
to

04:07:24.830 --> 04:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:07:27.889 --> 04:07:27.899 align:start position:0%
um a settlement or some type of audit or
 
04:07:29.570 --> 04:07:29.580 align:start position:0%
other variable
 
04:07:31.010 --> 04:07:31.020 align:start position:0%
um that that's external to the
 
04:07:34.670 --> 04:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
Department's control so with that um we
 
04:07:36.530 --> 04:07:36.540 align:start position:0%
can turn to page three and we can go
 
04:07:38.210 --> 04:07:38.220 align:start position:0%
through each one of these and I will
 
04:07:43.670 --> 04:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:45.349 --> 04:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
04:07:48.769 --> 04:07:48.779 align:start position:0%
so uh each of the
 
04:07:48.779 --> 04:07:49.670 align:start position:0%
so uh each of the
um

04:07:49.670 --> 04:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:53.090 --> 04:07:53.100 align:start position:0%
items that you see here is as uh Nathan
 
04:07:56.090 --> 04:07:56.100 align:start position:0%
pointed out are related to various
 
04:07:58.550 --> 04:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
Medicaid recoveries the first instance
 
04:08:00.710 --> 04:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
is child support payments where a
 
04:08:02.870 --> 04:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
non-custodial payment is ordered to pay
 
04:08:05.210 --> 04:08:05.220 align:start position:0%
medical support related to the to the
 
04:08:07.550 --> 04:08:07.560 align:start position:0%
child to reimburse Medicaid where
 
04:08:09.530 --> 04:08:09.540 align:start position:0%
Medicaid is made a payment as you can
 
04:08:11.510 --> 04:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
see it's a relatively low amount and we
 
04:08:14.870 --> 04:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
expect it to remain relatively low
 
04:08:16.849 --> 04:08:16.859 align:start position:0%
on the next page we have cost
 
04:08:19.670 --> 04:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
settlements cost settlements are a
 
04:08:22.010 --> 04:08:22.020 align:start position:0%
function of our payment methodology to
 
04:08:24.490 --> 04:08:24.500 align:start position:0%
hospitals for outpatient
 
04:08:28.250 --> 04:08:28.260 align:start position:0%
services and we have an arrangement
 
04:08:29.630 --> 04:08:29.640 align:start position:0%
where we
 
04:08:32.750 --> 04:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
um pay for critical access hospitals a
 
04:08:35.090 --> 04:08:35.100 align:start position:0%
percentage of cost and for non-critical
 
04:08:36.650 --> 04:08:36.660 align:start position:0%
Access hospitals another percentage of
 
04:08:39.530 --> 04:08:39.540 align:start position:0%
cost so there's an interim payment made
 
04:08:43.070 --> 04:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
but ultimately they have cost reports
 
04:08:45.290 --> 04:08:45.300 align:start position:0%
that they submit to Medicare those are
 
04:08:47.510 --> 04:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
audited and then once they're audited we
 
04:08:49.250 --> 04:08:49.260 align:start position:0%
would do a settlement based on what the
 
04:08:51.229 --> 04:08:51.239 align:start position:0%
cost is ultimately determined to be from
 
04:08:53.330 --> 04:08:53.340 align:start position:0%
the when the interim payment was made a
 
04:08:55.490 --> 04:08:55.500 align:start position:0%
few years prior so that can mean a
 
04:08:57.050 --> 04:08:57.060 align:start position:0%
return of funds to the state or it can
 
04:08:58.490 --> 04:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
mean that we have to give out money to
 
04:09:00.170 --> 04:09:00.180 align:start position:0%
the hospital depending upon what their
 
04:09:02.750 --> 04:09:02.760 align:start position:0%
actual costs were for that year and then
 
04:09:04.490 --> 04:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
the difference in the settlement is the
 
04:09:05.990 --> 04:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
amount ultimately that the state will
 
04:09:07.729 --> 04:09:07.739 align:start position:0%
earn in recoveries
 
04:09:11.330 --> 04:09:11.340 align:start position:0%
and that's what you see on page four uh
 
04:09:13.370 --> 04:09:13.380 align:start position:0%
page five
 
04:09:15.050 --> 04:09:15.060 align:start position:0%
um specifically these are supplemental
 
04:09:16.969 --> 04:09:16.979 align:start position:0%
funds from diabetic supply manufacturing
 
04:09:19.070 --> 04:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
companies this is an incredibly low
 
04:09:21.530 --> 04:09:21.540 align:start position:0%
amount you'll see and I want to use this
 
04:09:24.229 --> 04:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
as an opportunity to um to discuss kind
 
04:09:26.750 --> 04:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
of a theme that you'll see which is that
 
04:09:30.110 --> 04:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of these numbers are are low and
 
04:09:32.090 --> 04:09:32.100 align:start position:0%
any of you that are familiar with what
 
04:09:34.309 --> 04:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
the department had for recoveries in
 
04:09:35.750 --> 04:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
Prior years like let's say over the last
 
04:09:38.150 --> 04:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
10 years or so these are much lower than
 
04:09:39.889 --> 04:09:39.899 align:start position:0%
those were and that's because we've
 
04:09:42.670 --> 04:09:42.680 align:start position:0%
moved from being a fee for service
 
04:09:45.710 --> 04:09:45.720 align:start position:0%
insurance company Medicaid where we pay
 
04:09:47.450 --> 04:09:47.460 align:start position:0%
all of the services our fee for service
 
04:09:50.330 --> 04:09:50.340 align:start position:0%
payments into a Managed Care Arrangement
 
04:09:53.030 --> 04:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
so our managed care companies now
 
04:09:55.250 --> 04:09:55.260 align:start position:0%
perform a lot of these functions for us
 
04:09:57.070 --> 04:09:57.080 align:start position:0%
and we have a much much smaller
 
04:10:00.229 --> 04:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
fee-for-service population and so we are
 
04:10:01.910 --> 04:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
not earning the same recoveries because
 
04:10:03.530 --> 04:10:03.540 align:start position:0%
we're doing it off a much much smaller
 
04:10:03.540 --> 04:10:06.290 align:start position:0%
we're doing it off a much much smaller
population

04:10:06.290 --> 04:10:06.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:08.650 --> 04:10:08.660 align:start position:0%
so that's um
 
04:10:10.969 --> 04:10:10.979 align:start position:0%
diabetic supplies see the next one oh
 
04:10:13.010 --> 04:10:13.020 align:start position:0%
other recoveries prior year yeah this is
 
04:10:15.650 --> 04:10:15.660 align:start position:0%
just a line item that we have it it is
 
04:10:17.750 --> 04:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
all of the same recovery types that you
 
04:10:19.849 --> 04:10:19.859 align:start position:0%
see on the other Pages it simply has to
 
04:10:21.590 --> 04:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
do with an instance where it's not
 
04:10:23.150 --> 04:10:23.160 align:start position:0%
related to a service from this year it's
 
04:10:24.889 --> 04:10:24.899 align:start position:0%
related to a prior year and so we put it
 
04:10:28.429 --> 04:10:28.439 align:start position:0%
in its own category
 
04:10:30.349 --> 04:10:30.359 align:start position:0%
page seven
 
04:10:33.650 --> 04:10:33.660 align:start position:0%
the AG's office Fraud Unit these are
 
04:10:35.630 --> 04:10:35.640 align:start position:0%
specifically instances where we are
 
04:10:38.389 --> 04:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
looking at a particular provider and
 
04:10:40.070 --> 04:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
suspect fraud it's referred to the
 
04:10:42.050 --> 04:10:42.060 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office they would
 
04:10:44.210 --> 04:10:44.220 align:start position:0%
pursue that case and they can seek a
 
04:10:44.220 --> 04:10:45.769 align:start position:0%
pursue that case and they can seek a
recovery

04:10:45.769 --> 04:10:45.779 align:start position:0%
recovery
 
04:10:47.870 --> 04:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
um and then that whatever the recovery
 
04:10:50.210 --> 04:10:50.220 align:start position:0%
amount is there's a portion that is
 
04:10:51.650 --> 04:10:51.660 align:start position:0%
returned to the federal government and a
 
04:10:53.330 --> 04:10:53.340 align:start position:0%
portion that's kept by the state
 
04:10:53.340 --> 04:10:55.250 align:start position:0%
portion that's kept by the state
yeah

04:10:55.250 --> 04:10:55.260 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:10:58.130 --> 04:10:58.140 align:start position:0%
yes representative ulery
 
04:10:58.140 --> 04:10:59.990 align:start position:0%
yes representative ulery
I

04:10:59.990 --> 04:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:11:02.570 --> 04:11:02.580 align:start position:0%
have a threefold increase and
 
04:11:04.189 --> 04:11:04.199 align:start position:0%
one year
 
04:11:07.130 --> 04:11:07.140 align:start position:0%
so I my suspicion is that our our budget
 
04:11:09.830 --> 04:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
for 24 and 25 are actually probably more
 
04:11:11.950 --> 04:11:11.960 align:start position:0%
than Norm I'm not sure why we're so low
 
04:11:14.210 --> 04:11:14.220 align:start position:0%
this year
 
04:11:16.429 --> 04:11:16.439 align:start position:0%
um but normally these cases are very
 
04:11:19.490 --> 04:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
much dependent upon what the AG's office
 
04:11:22.610 --> 04:11:22.620 align:start position:0%
can kind of take on all at one time and
 
04:11:24.349 --> 04:11:24.359 align:start position:0%
we do have instances where they can
 
04:11:26.929 --> 04:11:26.939 align:start position:0%
either they'll settle or they'll win a
 
04:11:28.910 --> 04:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
number of cases in a single year and it
 
04:11:31.670 --> 04:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
bounces up and then for some reason uh
 
04:11:33.530 --> 04:11:33.540 align:start position:0%
maybe a case is moving much more slowly
 
04:11:34.849 --> 04:11:34.859 align:start position:0%
than they anticipated they have to do
 
04:11:36.650 --> 04:11:36.660 align:start position:0%
more investigation and you have a lower
 
04:11:36.660 --> 04:11:38.689 align:start position:0%
more investigation and you have a lower
recovery

04:11:38.689 --> 04:11:38.699 align:start position:0%
recovery
 
04:11:41.530 --> 04:11:41.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:43.790 --> 04:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
representative lippley
 
04:11:46.490 --> 04:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair are these numbers
 
04:11:49.670 --> 04:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
per thousand or not per thousand are
 
04:11:51.590 --> 04:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
they in the thousands
 
04:11:54.229 --> 04:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
or these are these are total so it's
 
04:11:57.769 --> 04:11:57.779 align:start position:0%
when it says 2024 agency budget it's 120
 
04:11:59.870 --> 04:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
000 correct thank you yes so we're
 
04:12:02.150 --> 04:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
dealing with a lot smaller numbers which
 
04:12:04.250 --> 04:12:04.260 align:start position:0%
is why I mentioned earlier we we may or
 
04:12:06.050 --> 04:12:06.060 align:start position:0%
may not want this particular agency to
 
04:12:08.090 --> 04:12:08.100 align:start position:0%
come back because we're dealing with a
 
04:12:09.530 --> 04:12:09.540 align:start position:0%
just a much smaller number than of
 
04:12:11.809 --> 04:12:11.819 align:start position:0%
course we are with the dra right
 
04:12:13.490 --> 04:12:13.500 align:start position:0%
so and something to keep in mind is
 
04:12:15.349 --> 04:12:15.359 align:start position:0%
these are the general fund portions of
 
04:12:17.210 --> 04:12:17.220 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid payments so depending if it
 
04:12:18.530 --> 04:12:18.540 align:start position:0%
was a regular
 
04:12:20.570 --> 04:12:20.580 align:start position:0%
um a traditional Medicaid where it's 50
 
04:12:22.429 --> 04:12:22.439 align:start position:0%
50 goes back to the federal government
 
04:12:25.130 --> 04:12:25.140 align:start position:0%
if it was a granite Advantage population
 
04:12:27.349 --> 04:12:27.359 align:start position:0%
90 would be going back to the feds but
 
04:12:28.670 --> 04:12:28.680 align:start position:0%
this is all that's left for the general
 
04:12:33.530 --> 04:12:33.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:37.610 --> 04:12:37.620 align:start position:0%
uh page eight is program Integrity unit
 
04:12:39.530 --> 04:12:39.540 align:start position:0%
so this is where we are identifying
 
04:12:43.250 --> 04:12:43.260 align:start position:0%
instances of uh for us excuse me waste
 
04:12:44.809 --> 04:12:44.819 align:start position:0%
or abuse not something that's turned
 
04:12:46.370 --> 04:12:46.380 align:start position:0%
into fraud and goes to the AG's office
 
04:12:48.070 --> 04:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
but just things that we would retain
 
04:12:51.290 --> 04:12:51.300 align:start position:0%
within the agency because we identify
 
04:12:53.630 --> 04:12:53.640 align:start position:0%
what we would refer to as waster abuse
 
04:12:55.790 --> 04:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
in a provider and we do the recruitment
 
04:12:57.710 --> 04:12:57.720 align:start position:0%
but it hasn't risen to the level of
 
04:12:57.720 --> 04:13:00.830 align:start position:0%
but it hasn't risen to the level of
fraud

04:13:00.830 --> 04:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:07.130 --> 04:13:07.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:09.650 --> 04:13:09.660 align:start position:0%
oh member fraud yep so these are related
 
04:13:13.010 --> 04:13:13.020 align:start position:0%
to instances of member fraud
 
04:13:15.290 --> 04:13:15.300 align:start position:0%
um where there's been a court order for
 
04:13:18.650 --> 04:13:18.660 align:start position:0%
us to recoup on a member who
 
04:13:20.630 --> 04:13:20.640 align:start position:0%
fraudulently represented that they were
 
04:13:25.910 --> 04:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:30.050 --> 04:13:30.060 align:start position:0%
page 10 is related to
 
04:13:31.849 --> 04:13:31.859 align:start position:0%
um what's called third party liability
 
04:13:35.030 --> 04:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
so where a member has both Medicaid and
 
04:13:37.189 --> 04:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
another form of insurance and the other
 
04:13:39.769 --> 04:13:39.779 align:start position:0%
form of insurance should have paid for a
 
04:13:41.510 --> 04:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
service and Medicaid paid we would then
 
04:13:42.950 --> 04:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
go and recoup the other part of the
 
04:13:46.729 --> 04:13:46.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:49.670 --> 04:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
and in this instance you'll see that
 
04:13:51.889 --> 04:13:51.899 align:start position:0%
it's a little elevated in 23 and then it
 
04:13:54.229 --> 04:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
goes down we did have an issue with our
 
04:13:56.030 --> 04:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy billing that we managed to
 
04:13:57.950 --> 04:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
catch up on so it's a little elevated in
 
04:13:59.570 --> 04:13:59.580 align:start position:0%
this year we don't expect that to
 
04:13:59.580 --> 04:14:00.769 align:start position:0%
this year we don't expect that to
continue

04:14:00.769 --> 04:14:00.779 align:start position:0%
continue
 
04:14:02.630 --> 04:14:02.640 align:start position:0%
and on the next page
 
04:14:04.849 --> 04:14:04.859 align:start position:0%
um Casualty Insurance so this is related
 
04:14:06.530 --> 04:14:06.540 align:start position:0%
to instances of accident and Trauma
 
04:14:08.809 --> 04:14:08.819 align:start position:0%
where there's subrogation of insurance
 
04:14:13.309 --> 04:14:13.319 align:start position:0%
and um there was a particular case in
 
04:14:15.290 --> 04:14:15.300 align:start position:0%
this year that earned the department an
 
04:14:17.290 --> 04:14:17.300 align:start position:0%
additional amount of money
 
04:14:20.150 --> 04:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
these generally both both what you see
 
04:14:23.570 --> 04:14:23.580 align:start position:0%
on page 11 the TPL casualty and some of
 
04:14:26.269 --> 04:14:26.279 align:start position:0%
the um other provider
 
04:14:29.450 --> 04:14:29.460 align:start position:0%
um recoveries are just really case
 
04:14:31.790 --> 04:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
specific and they are somewhat hard to
 
04:14:34.309 --> 04:14:34.319 align:start position:0%
project we know we're not going to see a
 
04:14:35.870 --> 04:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
million dollars out of any of them
 
04:14:38.809 --> 04:14:38.819 align:start position:0%
necessarily but but it can bounce up and
 
04:14:41.030 --> 04:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
down just depending upon this particular
 
04:14:47.150 --> 04:14:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:49.910 --> 04:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
for estate recoveries yeah yep well you
 
04:14:51.349 --> 04:14:51.359 align:start position:0%
guys deal in bigger numbers anyway so
 
04:14:55.130 --> 04:14:55.140 align:start position:0%
and that is the um fraud waste and abuse
 
04:14:57.530 --> 04:14:57.540 align:start position:0%
and TPL recoveries and I'll pass it to
 
04:14:59.030 --> 04:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
Janella Legion to talk a little bit
 
04:15:03.650 --> 04:15:03.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:05.330 --> 04:15:05.340 align:start position:0%
oh yeah
 
04:15:08.090 --> 04:15:08.100 align:start position:0%
where are we there representative thank
 
04:15:09.769 --> 04:15:09.779 align:start position:0%
you madam chair you mentioned uh and
 
04:15:11.870 --> 04:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for showing up and being here
 
04:15:13.429 --> 04:15:13.439 align:start position:0%
today you mentioned that the state
 
04:15:15.229 --> 04:15:15.239 align:start position:0%
Medicare system has switched to a
 
04:15:17.450 --> 04:15:17.460 align:start position:0%
Managed Care model
 
04:15:20.689 --> 04:15:20.699 align:start position:0%
um just two days ago Indiana I guess
 
04:15:23.090 --> 04:15:23.100 align:start position:0%
yesterday Indiana well I guess it was
 
04:15:24.650 --> 04:15:24.660 align:start position:0%
Friday Indiana announced a settlement
 
04:15:27.170 --> 04:15:27.180 align:start position:0%
with their Managed Care Organization for
 
04:15:30.530 --> 04:15:30.540 align:start position:0%
66 million dollars for over billing the
 
04:15:30.540 --> 04:15:31.729 align:start position:0%
66 million dollars for over billing the
state

04:15:31.729 --> 04:15:31.739 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:15:33.769 --> 04:15:33.779 align:start position:0%
um in the past couple months we've seen
 
04:15:35.889 --> 04:15:35.899 align:start position:0%
settlements with Texas
 
04:15:38.870 --> 04:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
165 million Massachusetts 14 million
 
04:15:42.050 --> 04:15:42.060 align:start position:0%
Washington State 33 million
 
04:15:42.060 --> 04:15:42.710 align:start position:0%
Washington State 33 million
um

04:15:42.710 --> 04:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:45.950 --> 04:15:45.960 align:start position:0%
I think Oregon and Iowa are well are
 
04:15:47.750 --> 04:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
also working on settlements with their
 
04:15:49.010 --> 04:15:49.020 align:start position:0%
case where their Managed Care
 
04:15:51.410 --> 04:15:51.420 align:start position:0%
Organization promised to deliver savings
 
04:15:54.530 --> 04:15:54.540 align:start position:0%
but in fact did just the opposite so
 
04:15:56.150 --> 04:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
we're looking at
 
04:15:59.150 --> 04:15:59.160 align:start position:0%
some of the fraud or fraud wasted abuse
 
04:16:01.250 --> 04:16:01.260 align:start position:0%
I mean obviously we look at fraud waste
 
04:16:02.990 --> 04:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
and abuse as it relates to the recipient
 
04:16:06.170 --> 04:16:06.180 align:start position:0%
but also are you auditing fraud waste
 
04:16:07.790 --> 04:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
for fraud waste and abuse of your
 
04:16:10.790 --> 04:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
Managed Care Organization and is that a
 
04:16:14.210 --> 04:16:14.220 align:start position:0%
transparent model that you're getting at
 
04:16:15.349 --> 04:16:15.359 align:start position:0%
the state
 
04:16:17.570 --> 04:16:17.580 align:start position:0%
we have thank you for the question it's
 
04:16:19.490 --> 04:16:19.500 align:start position:0%
a great question we have a lot of
 
04:16:21.469 --> 04:16:21.479 align:start position:0%
oversight mechanisms for our Managed
 
04:16:24.590 --> 04:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
Care organizations I cannot speak to all
 
04:16:28.189 --> 04:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
of them I can tell you that for for this
 
04:16:30.290 --> 04:16:30.300 align:start position:0%
fraud wasted abuse and third-party
 
04:16:32.030 --> 04:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
liability some of the mechanisms that we
 
04:16:35.269 --> 04:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
use is we look at their
 
04:16:37.969 --> 04:16:37.979 align:start position:0%
um we have reporting from them that we
 
04:16:39.950 --> 04:16:39.960 align:start position:0%
compare to their claims so that we can
 
04:16:41.630 --> 04:16:41.640 align:start position:0%
see the work that they're doing related
 
04:16:44.510 --> 04:16:44.520 align:start position:0%
to those items and where we find them
 
04:16:47.210 --> 04:16:47.220 align:start position:0%
less than satisfactory we can adjust the
 
04:16:48.710 --> 04:16:48.720 align:start position:0%
rates that we pay those Managed Care
 
04:16:50.510 --> 04:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
organizations to say this is what we
 
04:16:52.309 --> 04:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
expect out of you and you're not hitting
 
04:16:53.990 --> 04:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
that Mark so we're adjusting the rate
 
04:16:55.610 --> 04:16:55.620 align:start position:0%
and we actually did that in our third
 
04:16:58.010 --> 04:16:58.020 align:start position:0%
party liability area so that we we
 
04:16:59.870 --> 04:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
basically said to them this is the level
 
04:17:01.790 --> 04:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
of third-party recoveries we expect from
 
04:17:03.710 --> 04:17:03.720 align:start position:0%
you and you can make it or not make it
 
04:17:05.269 --> 04:17:05.279 align:start position:0%
it's not going to impact the state
 
04:17:06.769 --> 04:17:06.779 align:start position:0%
because we've already adjusted our rate
 
04:17:08.630 --> 04:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
for the amount we expect you to to
 
04:17:08.640 --> 04:17:10.070 align:start position:0%
for the amount we expect you to to
perform

04:17:10.070 --> 04:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
perform
 
04:17:12.170 --> 04:17:12.180 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you
 
04:17:14.330 --> 04:17:14.340 align:start position:0%
um have you ever contracted with an
 
04:17:17.150 --> 04:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
independent auditor perhaps to take a
 
04:17:18.950 --> 04:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
deep dive into because because you know
 
04:17:20.929 --> 04:17:20.939 align:start position:0%
I mean these numbers that we're seeing
 
04:17:23.090 --> 04:17:23.100 align:start position:0%
in these man because that's the trend in
 
04:17:24.290 --> 04:17:24.300 align:start position:0%
the states is to go on to these
 
04:17:26.809 --> 04:17:26.819 align:start position:0%
management they're staggering and I just
 
04:17:28.910 --> 04:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that you know you're
 
04:17:30.950 --> 04:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
right this is a small number that we're
 
04:17:33.170 --> 04:17:33.180 align:start position:0%
dealing with today but I'm wondering if
 
04:17:35.389 --> 04:17:35.399 align:start position:0%
there's more that the state is
 
04:17:37.070 --> 04:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
overpaying for that maybe could be
 
04:17:37.080 --> 04:17:38.389 align:start position:0%
overpaying for that maybe could be
uncovered

04:17:38.389 --> 04:17:38.399 align:start position:0%
uncovered
 
04:17:40.429 --> 04:17:40.439 align:start position:0%
I would need to look at what kind of
 
04:17:42.950 --> 04:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
each of those settlements were for the
 
04:17:44.330 --> 04:17:44.340 align:start position:0%
state was part of a very large
 
04:17:45.950 --> 04:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
settlement with the centene corporation
 
04:17:48.590 --> 04:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
a couple of years ago and received 21
 
04:17:50.689 --> 04:17:50.699 align:start position:0%
million dollars out of that so there
 
04:17:51.889 --> 04:17:51.899 align:start position:0%
there are different settlements for
 
04:17:53.210 --> 04:17:53.220 align:start position:0%
different purposes and I'm not sure what
 
04:17:55.189 --> 04:17:55.199 align:start position:0%
each of those are for we have just
 
04:17:57.650 --> 04:17:57.660 align:start position:0%
engaged with an auditor to do an audit
 
04:18:00.410 --> 04:18:00.420 align:start position:0%
of the um
 
04:18:02.809 --> 04:18:02.819 align:start position:0%
um managed care companies uh medical
 
04:18:06.610 --> 04:18:06.620 align:start position:0%
loss ratio so the medical loss ratio is
 
04:18:08.929 --> 04:18:08.939 align:start position:0%
an amount that we anticipate they're
 
04:18:10.729 --> 04:18:10.739 align:start position:0%
spending on claims versus Administration
 
04:18:13.010 --> 04:18:13.020 align:start position:0%
and profit and they report those to us
 
04:18:14.570 --> 04:18:14.580 align:start position:0%
but we haven't done an actual audit of
 
04:18:16.610 --> 04:18:16.620 align:start position:0%
it previously we've we've done sort of
 
04:18:18.469 --> 04:18:18.479 align:start position:0%
what you call desk reviews we're now
 
04:18:20.210 --> 04:18:20.220 align:start position:0%
going to start auditing those from the
 
04:18:20.220 --> 04:18:22.010 align:start position:0%
going to start auditing those from the
mcos

04:18:22.010 --> 04:18:22.020 align:start position:0%
mcos
 
04:18:27.110 --> 04:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:29.870 --> 04:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Janelle leiji
 
04:18:31.309 --> 04:18:31.319 align:start position:0%
and I manage the Department's estate
 
04:18:32.689 --> 04:18:32.699 align:start position:0%
Recovery Unit
 
04:18:36.650 --> 04:18:36.660 align:start position:0%
this unit is federally oops there we go
 
04:18:38.689 --> 04:18:38.699 align:start position:0%
federally mandated
 
04:18:41.210 --> 04:18:41.220 align:start position:0%
we recover on behalf of the state the
 
04:18:42.830 --> 04:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
federal government the counties and
 
04:18:44.570 --> 04:18:44.580 align:start position:0%
sometimes the town depending on the age
 
04:18:46.189 --> 04:18:46.199 align:start position:0%
of the assistance from which we're
 
04:18:46.199 --> 04:18:47.630 align:start position:0%
of the assistance from which we're
recovering

04:18:47.630 --> 04:18:47.640 align:start position:0%
recovering
 
04:18:50.030 --> 04:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
at any given time we have about 2 000
 
04:18:52.670 --> 04:18:52.680 align:start position:0%
open cases most of our recoveries happen
 
04:18:55.070 --> 04:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
post death there are some that happen
 
04:18:57.170 --> 04:18:57.180 align:start position:0%
during one's lifetime in the instances
 
04:18:59.330 --> 04:18:59.340 align:start position:0%
where we have a lien secured by real
 
04:18:59.340 --> 04:19:01.610 align:start position:0%
where we have a lien secured by real
property

04:19:01.610 --> 04:19:01.620 align:start position:0%
property
 
04:19:01.620 --> 04:19:02.990 align:start position:0%
property
um

04:19:02.990 --> 04:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:06.769 --> 04:19:06.779 align:start position:0%
this uh what you see on page 12 is the
 
04:19:09.349 --> 04:19:09.359 align:start position:0%
state's share of what we recover on
 
04:19:11.510 --> 04:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
average over the last 16 years we
 
04:19:13.309 --> 04:19:13.319 align:start position:0%
recover about six and a half million
 
04:19:15.290 --> 04:19:15.300 align:start position:0%
dollars per year total
 
04:19:17.570 --> 04:19:17.580 align:start position:0%
but as I indicated the state share for
 
04:19:20.269 --> 04:19:20.279 align:start position:0%
just the medical assistance is about one
 
04:19:21.889 --> 04:19:21.899 align:start position:0%
and a half million dollars we also
 
04:19:24.650 --> 04:19:24.660 align:start position:0%
recover for financial assistance certain
 
04:19:26.990 --> 04:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
types of financial assistance and that's
 
04:19:28.910 --> 04:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
not part of the Medicaid Program so you
 
04:19:32.450 --> 04:19:32.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:34.670 --> 04:19:34.680 align:start position:0%
if there's any other questions
 
04:19:37.130 --> 04:19:37.140 align:start position:0%
I I with common to the million dollar
 
04:19:39.590 --> 04:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
recovery for what it's worth we did just
 
04:19:41.150 --> 04:19:41.160 align:start position:0%
process the check for one million
 
04:19:42.769 --> 04:19:42.779 align:start position:0%
dollars and the state got half of that
 
04:19:45.710 --> 04:19:45.720 align:start position:0%
so this year will be a big year
 
04:19:48.290 --> 04:19:48.300 align:start position:0%
when we couldn't have predicted that
 
04:19:50.570 --> 04:19:50.580 align:start position:0%
yeah we understand but thank you so much
 
04:19:58.790 --> 04:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:02.330 --> 04:20:02.340 align:start position:0%
sorry uh try again I want to dig down a
 
04:20:06.469 --> 04:20:06.479 align:start position:0%
little bit into uh what this this
 
04:20:09.590 --> 04:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
particular item reflects and um and I
 
04:20:11.809 --> 04:20:11.819 align:start position:0%
write in thinking that at least a part
 
04:20:13.910 --> 04:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
of it is
 
04:20:13.920 --> 04:20:14.929 align:start position:0%
of it is
um

04:20:14.929 --> 04:20:14.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:18.110 --> 04:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
situations where the an individual who
 
04:20:20.750 --> 04:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
legitimately was on Medicaid
 
04:20:20.760 --> 04:20:22.010 align:start position:0%
legitimately was on Medicaid
but

04:20:22.010 --> 04:20:22.020 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:20:25.070 --> 04:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
um had a home
 
04:20:29.090 --> 04:20:29.100 align:start position:0%
that uh the department gained a lean on
 
04:20:32.750 --> 04:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
but continued to be served
 
04:20:36.189 --> 04:20:36.199 align:start position:0%
for health care and the
 
04:20:40.189 --> 04:20:40.199 align:start position:0%
costs eventually were recovered are
 
04:20:41.750 --> 04:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
recovered by
 
04:20:44.450 --> 04:20:44.460 align:start position:0%
by you through this estate recovery
 
04:20:47.689 --> 04:20:47.699 align:start position:0%
system is that am I way off or
 
04:20:49.550 --> 04:20:49.560 align:start position:0%
well yes and no
 
04:20:49.560 --> 04:20:51.050 align:start position:0%
well yes and no
um

04:20:51.050 --> 04:20:51.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:53.389 --> 04:20:53.399 align:start position:0%
when someone has a home
 
04:20:55.490 --> 04:20:55.500 align:start position:0%
the home may be subject to a lien only
 
04:20:58.370 --> 04:20:58.380 align:start position:0%
in certain circumstances for Medicaid
 
04:21:01.250 --> 04:21:01.260 align:start position:0%
they have to be over the age of 55. they
 
04:21:02.990 --> 04:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
also have to be the permanent resident
 
04:21:05.630 --> 04:21:05.640 align:start position:0%
of a nursing home that is they're not
 
04:21:07.729 --> 04:21:07.739 align:start position:0%
expected to return home
 
04:21:09.530 --> 04:21:09.540 align:start position:0%
and that none of the following people
 
04:21:11.269 --> 04:21:11.279 align:start position:0%
live in the home or in the community
 
04:21:13.070 --> 04:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
their spouse
 
04:21:15.889 --> 04:21:15.899 align:start position:0%
a blind child a disabled child as that
 
04:21:17.510 --> 04:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
term is defined by the Social Security
 
04:21:19.729 --> 04:21:19.739 align:start position:0%
Act or a sibling with an equity interest
 
04:21:22.189 --> 04:21:22.199 align:start position:0%
in the home that lived there for at
 
04:21:24.410 --> 04:21:24.420 align:start position:0%
least two years prior to the other
 
04:21:26.750 --> 04:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
person's entry into the nursing home
 
04:21:29.630 --> 04:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
so in your example where you're where
 
04:21:33.110 --> 04:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
your person had a home we would only
 
04:21:36.110 --> 04:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
have a lien on it if all those that list
 
04:21:38.630 --> 04:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
of criteria were satisfied which means
 
04:21:40.130 --> 04:21:40.140 align:start position:0%
that person was open for Medicaid
 
04:21:42.530 --> 04:21:42.540 align:start position:0%
long-term care services
 
04:21:44.150 --> 04:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
and if they didn't have any of those
 
04:21:45.889 --> 04:21:45.899 align:start position:0%
other people in the community they would
 
04:21:47.750 --> 04:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
have also been required to sell the home
 
04:21:50.570 --> 04:21:50.580 align:start position:0%
to help offset the cost of their care my
 
04:21:52.670 --> 04:21:52.680 align:start position:0%
office may or may not have gotten to the
 
04:21:54.710 --> 04:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
Opera gotten the opportunity to place a
 
04:21:56.990 --> 04:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
lien yet we do always give people notice
 
04:21:59.450 --> 04:21:59.460 align:start position:0%
and opportunity for a hearing before we
 
04:22:02.389 --> 04:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
do that if we did have a lien and if if
 
04:22:04.130 --> 04:22:04.140 align:start position:0%
it was if they had a hearing and it was
 
04:22:07.010 --> 04:22:07.020 align:start position:0%
found to be appropriate all process is
 
04:22:10.010 --> 04:22:10.020 align:start position:0%
satisfied we would recover from the sale
 
04:22:12.110 --> 04:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
of the home up to the amount that we
 
04:22:13.670 --> 04:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
were owed if there were enough in the
 
04:22:16.309 --> 04:22:16.319 align:start position:0%
net proceeds I will tell you I've been
 
04:22:18.950 --> 04:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
doing this for 15 years we have never
 
04:22:21.830 --> 04:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
once forced the sale of a home or forced
 
04:22:23.809 --> 04:22:23.819 align:start position:0%
anyone out of the home I just want to
 
04:22:25.189 --> 04:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
add that
 
04:22:27.349 --> 04:22:27.359 align:start position:0%
it's very important to us after someone
 
04:22:29.210 --> 04:22:29.220 align:start position:0%
dies and they own a home in their estate
 
04:22:32.210 --> 04:22:32.220 align:start position:0%
which is subject to a state recovery if
 
04:22:34.370 --> 04:22:34.380 align:start position:0%
they want to stay in the home we work
 
04:22:36.889 --> 04:22:36.899 align:start position:0%
out a repayment plan with them and
 
04:22:38.809 --> 04:22:38.819 align:start position:0%
sometimes that means no monthly payments
 
04:22:41.450 --> 04:22:41.460 align:start position:0%
at all it means deferring payment from
 
04:22:43.130 --> 04:22:43.140 align:start position:0%
the value in the home out another
 
04:22:45.170 --> 04:22:45.180 align:start position:0%
generation because that's the right
 
04:22:47.570 --> 04:22:47.580 align:start position:0%
thing to do
 
04:22:53.150 --> 04:22:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:54.889 --> 04:22:54.899 align:start position:0%
representative ulrey
 
04:22:56.990 --> 04:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
while it's not within your purview to
 
04:22:58.849 --> 04:22:58.859 align:start position:0%
recover but there's also the five-year
 
04:23:00.429 --> 04:23:00.439 align:start position:0%
setback in the
 
04:23:03.170 --> 04:23:03.180 align:start position:0%
irrevocable trust aspect that applies to
 
04:23:05.510 --> 04:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
some of this is that correct so the
 
04:23:06.769 --> 04:23:06.779 align:start position:0%
five-year look back is something
 
04:23:08.809 --> 04:23:08.819 align:start position:0%
different that's something that happens
 
04:23:10.969 --> 04:23:10.979 align:start position:0%
when a person applies for certain types
 
04:23:13.429 --> 04:23:13.439 align:start position:0%
of Medicaid Home and Community Based
 
04:23:16.010 --> 04:23:16.020 align:start position:0%
care long-term care services are the two
 
04:23:18.110 --> 04:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
that are most commonly
 
04:23:21.530 --> 04:23:21.540 align:start position:0%
encountered by Medicaid applicants and
 
04:23:23.330 --> 04:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
what happens when they apply for those
 
04:23:25.130 --> 04:23:25.140 align:start position:0%
types of services
 
04:23:27.590 --> 04:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
we look back at every transaction that
 
04:23:29.929 --> 04:23:29.939 align:start position:0%
they made for the last five years
 
04:23:32.330 --> 04:23:32.340 align:start position:0%
if it's found that they've transferred
 
04:23:34.550 --> 04:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
an asset for less than fair market value
 
04:23:36.050 --> 04:23:36.060 align:start position:0%
because sometimes
 
04:23:38.330 --> 04:23:38.340 align:start position:0%
mom and dad want to give away the house
 
04:23:40.250 --> 04:23:40.260 align:start position:0%
to their children so that their children
 
04:23:42.950 --> 04:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
can have the house it might be that the
 
04:23:45.830 --> 04:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
house has to be returned to them
 
04:23:48.530 --> 04:23:48.540 align:start position:0%
because first and foremost
 
04:23:50.870 --> 04:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
their assets have to be used to pay for
 
04:23:52.969 --> 04:23:52.979 align:start position:0%
their care before the taxpayers pay for
 
04:23:56.389 --> 04:23:56.399 align:start position:0%
their care and that's difficult water to
 
04:23:58.969 --> 04:23:58.979 align:start position:0%
tread in as you may all well imagine we
 
04:24:02.030 --> 04:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
do work with again with families to try
 
04:24:04.250 --> 04:24:04.260 align:start position:0%
to explain it to explain the policy that
 
04:24:07.250 --> 04:24:07.260 align:start position:0%
Medicaid is a payer of Last Resort and I
 
04:24:09.410 --> 04:24:09.420 align:start position:0%
don't want to use the W word in a
 
04:24:11.570 --> 04:24:11.580 align:start position:0%
negative way but it is a form of welfare
 
04:24:14.210 --> 04:24:14.220 align:start position:0%
and so we have to try to balance that
 
04:24:16.670 --> 04:24:16.680 align:start position:0%
and that is where Congress has chosen to
 
04:24:19.370 --> 04:24:19.380 align:start position:0%
draw the Line in the Sand
 
04:24:25.189 --> 04:24:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:27.830 --> 04:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
if you had a question about trusts
 
04:24:29.929 --> 04:24:29.939 align:start position:0%
because you mentioned irrevocable trust
 
04:24:31.130 --> 04:24:31.140 align:start position:0%
as well
 
04:24:34.010 --> 04:24:34.020 align:start position:0%
no the irrevocable trust don't apply in
 
04:24:35.689 --> 04:24:35.699 align:start position:0%
this instance because that can be just
 
04:24:37.610 --> 04:24:37.620 align:start position:0%
changed the drop of a hat but the
 
04:24:40.729 --> 04:24:40.739 align:start position:0%
revocable TR or being strike that other
 
04:24:41.650 --> 04:24:41.660 align:start position:0%
way around
 
04:24:44.570 --> 04:24:44.580 align:start position:0%
irrevocable trust cannot be dropped
 
04:24:46.969 --> 04:24:46.979 align:start position:0%
where the revocable one can be
 
04:24:49.790 --> 04:24:49.800 align:start position:0%
if the asset were transferred into the
 
04:24:51.830 --> 04:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
irrevocable trust within the five years
 
04:24:56.030 --> 04:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
then it would count as an asset transfer
 
04:25:00.050 --> 04:25:00.060 align:start position:0%
right f right provided that it is truly
 
04:25:01.729 --> 04:25:01.739 align:start position:0%
irrevocable because as you mentioned
 
04:25:05.469 --> 04:25:05.479 align:start position:0%
that can be changed I look at everything
 
04:25:08.389 --> 04:25:08.399 align:start position:0%
Medicaid yes I look at every single one
 
04:25:11.090 --> 04:25:11.100 align:start position:0%
of those trusts believe it or not
 
04:25:13.610 --> 04:25:13.620 align:start position:0%
um it's not always the most exciting
 
04:25:15.889 --> 04:25:15.899 align:start position:0%
work but it's very interesting I do you
 
04:25:22.250 --> 04:25:22.260 align:start position:0%

you'll note that during covert we did
 
04:28:11.149 --> 04:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
see a sharp increase in sales on
 
04:28:14.990 --> 04:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
licenses that has started to decline as
 
04:28:17.929 --> 04:28:17.939 align:start position:0%
we move away from that one of the things
 
04:28:21.170 --> 04:28:21.180 align:start position:0%
is when things all shut down and kids
 
04:28:22.790 --> 04:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
were home from school and parents were
 
04:28:23.990 --> 04:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
home and their children they were
 
04:28:25.929 --> 04:28:25.939 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
04:28:28.849 --> 04:28:28.859 align:start position:0%
some fun things to do that didn't
 
04:28:31.750 --> 04:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily get you into a big crowd and
 
04:28:34.849 --> 04:28:34.859 align:start position:0%
fishing and I and hunting in those types
 
04:28:36.950 --> 04:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
of activities uh soared through the roof
 
04:28:40.010 --> 04:28:40.020 align:start position:0%
for a few years unfortunately for our
 
04:28:42.469 --> 04:28:42.479 align:start position:0%
license sales things are coming back to
 
04:28:43.729 --> 04:28:43.739 align:start position:0%
normal and kids are back in school
 
04:28:45.649 --> 04:28:45.659 align:start position:0%
participating in school programs and
 
04:28:47.389 --> 04:28:47.399 align:start position:0%
parents are rushing around trying to get
 
04:28:49.550 --> 04:28:49.560 align:start position:0%
them from one thing to the other and and
 
04:28:51.290 --> 04:28:51.300 align:start position:0%
and they're no we're not selling the
 
04:28:55.189 --> 04:28:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:55.199 --> 04:28:59.090 align:start position:0%

04:29:01.189 --> 04:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um I guess the
 
04:29:03.349 --> 04:29:03.359 align:start position:0%
thing that jumped right out at me was
 
04:29:06.410 --> 04:29:06.420 align:start position:0%
the salt water licenses being zero why
 
04:29:11.630 --> 04:29:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:13.790 --> 04:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
hi I'm Kathy Labonte and I'm the chief
 
04:29:15.530 --> 04:29:15.540 align:start position:0%
of the fine
 
04:29:17.510 --> 04:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
um business division so I oversee all
 
04:29:20.149 --> 04:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
finances for the Department I put this
 
04:29:22.729 --> 04:29:22.739 align:start position:0%
little spreadsheet together and what it
 
04:29:24.530 --> 04:29:24.540 align:start position:0%
is actually is kind of like a snapshot
 
04:29:26.990 --> 04:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
view of all of our unrestricted revenues
 
04:29:32.149 --> 04:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
from fiscal year 13 through 22 is actual
 
04:29:35.510 --> 04:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
23 is budgeted with the exception of the
 
04:29:37.670 --> 04:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
unrefunded road toll the two at the
 
04:29:40.610 --> 04:29:40.620 align:start position:0%
bottom those are actuals and to answer
 
04:29:44.050 --> 04:29:44.060 align:start position:0%
your questions sir saltwater licenses
 
04:29:48.290 --> 04:29:48.300 align:start position:0%
were a separate receipt account all the
 
04:29:51.290 --> 04:29:51.300 align:start position:0%
way through fiscal year 15 where they
 
04:29:53.809 --> 04:29:53.819 align:start position:0%
were accounted for separately when the
 
04:29:56.389 --> 04:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
salt water license was enacted
 
04:29:58.969 --> 04:29:58.979 align:start position:0%
and then it became apparent that it
 
04:30:00.950 --> 04:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
really wasn't worth it to keep that
 
04:30:02.990 --> 04:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
saltwater license separate from our
 
04:30:05.389 --> 04:30:05.399 align:start position:0%
other license revenues so we just put it
 
04:30:07.910 --> 04:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
together with our other licenses
 
04:30:10.130 --> 04:30:10.140 align:start position:0%
so it's part of the overall license
 
04:30:10.140 --> 04:30:14.750 align:start position:0%
so it's part of the overall license
Revenue

04:30:14.750 --> 04:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:18.229 --> 04:30:18.239 align:start position:0%
lots of questions uh representative
 
04:30:21.290 --> 04:30:21.300 align:start position:0%
yeah just to elaborate on the saltwater
 
04:30:23.929 --> 04:30:23.939 align:start position:0%
license I seem to remember that we put
 
04:30:26.809 --> 04:30:26.819 align:start position:0%
that in effect in order to forestall a
 
04:30:29.990 --> 04:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
higher uh federal license that was being
 
04:30:33.110 --> 04:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
put on if the state didn't have a
 
04:30:34.729 --> 04:30:34.739 align:start position:0%
license then we were gonna
 
04:30:37.849 --> 04:30:37.859 align:start position:0%
it was going to cost the the the striper
 
04:30:40.610 --> 04:30:40.620 align:start position:0%
fishermen more money to get stripers
 
04:30:43.309 --> 04:30:43.319 align:start position:0%
than if he bought us a ticket from us
 
04:30:46.670 --> 04:30:46.680 align:start position:0%
that is true it was going to be 15 at
 
04:30:49.070 --> 04:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
the Federal level or ten dollars at the
 
04:30:50.330 --> 04:30:50.340 align:start position:0%
state level
 
04:30:52.729 --> 04:30:52.739 align:start position:0%
and there's not that many we don't have
 
04:30:54.110 --> 04:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
good starters you got to go down to the
 
04:30:54.120 --> 04:30:55.490 align:start position:0%
good starters you got to go down to the
cape

04:30:55.490 --> 04:30:55.500 align:start position:0%
cape
 
04:30:56.990 --> 04:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
representative all me I'm sorry I missed
 
04:30:58.969 --> 04:30:58.979 align:start position:0%
your hand earlier
 
04:31:01.429 --> 04:31:01.439 align:start position:0%
thank you I just can't distinguish my
 
04:31:04.610 --> 04:31:04.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:04.620 --> 04:31:06.410 align:start position:0%
 
on

04:31:06.410 --> 04:31:06.420 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:31:06.420 --> 04:31:07.670 align:start position:0%
on
I

04:31:07.670 --> 04:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:31:12.110 --> 04:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
how big is your total budget this is
 
04:31:14.450 --> 04:31:14.460 align:start position:0%
just a very small piece of it isn't it
 
04:31:14.460 --> 04:31:16.550 align:start position:0%
just a very small piece of it isn't it
yes

04:31:16.550 --> 04:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:31:19.790 --> 04:31:19.800 align:start position:0%
if you take arfa out of the picture it's
 
04:31:23.330 --> 04:31:23.340 align:start position:0%
about I'm sorry if you take arpa out of
 
04:31:31.990 --> 04:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:34.610 --> 04:31:34.620 align:start position:0%
okay representative fellows did I see
 
04:31:36.229 --> 04:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
your hand up before
 
04:31:36.239 --> 04:31:39.050 align:start position:0%
your hand up before
okay

04:31:39.050 --> 04:31:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:42.649 --> 04:31:42.659 align:start position:0%
so my question was about the fourth line
 
04:31:45.590 --> 04:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
down the miscellaneous sales in income
 
04:31:49.370 --> 04:31:49.380 align:start position:0%
so I'm assuming that includes
 
04:31:52.429 --> 04:31:52.439 align:start position:0%
like I every year I make a donation to
 
04:31:55.969 --> 04:31:55.979 align:start position:0%
the non-game fund so is that in that
 
04:31:59.570 --> 04:31:59.580 align:start position:0%
line or no the non-game program is a 100
 
04:32:03.889 --> 04:32:03.899 align:start position:0%
percent dedicated program there are no
 
04:32:06.410 --> 04:32:06.420 align:start position:0%
unrestricted fishing game funds within
 
04:32:09.410 --> 04:32:09.420 align:start position:0%
that program so your donation goes
 
04:32:12.110 --> 04:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
directly to fund that okay it's not on
 
04:32:14.809 --> 04:32:14.819 align:start position:0%
here that's correct the biggest deposit
 
04:32:17.330 --> 04:32:17.340 align:start position:0%
into the miscellaneous sales and income
 
04:32:19.809 --> 04:32:19.819 align:start position:0%
of about three hundred thousand dollars
 
04:32:23.030 --> 04:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
is actually an internal administrative
 
04:32:26.030 --> 04:32:26.040 align:start position:0%
charge that we charge to our dedicated
 
04:32:30.950 --> 04:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
accounts to pay for the overhead of
 
04:32:33.469 --> 04:32:33.479 align:start position:0%
people such as myself and people in the
 
04:32:35.330 --> 04:32:35.340 align:start position:0%
business office and people within the
 
04:32:38.210 --> 04:32:38.220 align:start position:0%
director's office who work on those
 
04:32:42.889 --> 04:32:42.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:44.990 --> 04:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
representative shamberg
 
04:32:47.750 --> 04:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
04:32:49.670 --> 04:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
taking this question it has to do with
 
04:32:52.790 --> 04:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
the unfunded road toll on both the ohrv
 
04:32:55.070 --> 04:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
and the Marine
 
04:32:58.670 --> 04:32:58.680 align:start position:0%
is that a percentage of of just a quick
 
04:33:01.250 --> 04:33:01.260 align:start position:0%
explanation it's not a percentage it's
 
04:33:03.710 --> 04:33:03.720 align:start position:0%
actually a formula based on the amount
 
04:33:06.349 --> 04:33:06.359 align:start position:0%
of Regis for ohrv it's based on the
 
04:33:09.349 --> 04:33:09.359 align:start position:0%
amount of registrations sold
 
04:33:12.709 --> 04:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
and it's the same for boats for the
 
04:33:15.470 --> 04:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
amount of boat registration sold and
 
04:33:17.209 --> 04:33:17.219 align:start position:0%
those funds come to us from the
 
04:33:20.390 --> 04:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety they do all of the
 
04:33:23.029 --> 04:33:23.039 align:start position:0%
the mathematical work
 
04:33:24.470 --> 04:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:33:26.570 --> 04:33:26.580 align:start position:0%
representative ulery again
 
04:33:28.310 --> 04:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm just to elaborate on
 
04:33:30.410 --> 04:33:30.420 align:start position:0%
representative Schaumburg
 
04:33:34.131 --> 04:33:34.141 align:start position:0%
and some people don't no
 
04:33:37.330 --> 04:33:37.340 align:start position:0%
ohrv and Marine do not are not
 
04:33:39.769 --> 04:33:39.779 align:start position:0%
responsible for paying the road toll
 
04:33:42.289 --> 04:33:42.299 align:start position:0%
which is dedicated fee
 
04:33:44.330 --> 04:33:44.340 align:start position:0%
for Highway Maintenance
 
04:33:46.010 --> 04:33:46.020 align:start position:0%
so if you
 
04:33:49.131 --> 04:33:49.141 align:start position:0%
go and get gasoline for your jet ski or
 
04:33:52.250 --> 04:33:52.260 align:start position:0%
for your uh four-wheeler you don't have
 
04:33:54.170 --> 04:33:54.180 align:start position:0%
to pay the fee you take your receipt
 
04:33:56.390 --> 04:33:56.400 align:start position:0%
send it in to you and you reimburse them
 
04:33:59.510 --> 04:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
the the tax but if they don't do that
 
04:34:02.209 --> 04:34:02.219 align:start position:0%
then this money is comes in but it's not
 
04:34:05.570 --> 04:34:05.580 align:start position:0%
real money it's an accounting
 
04:34:11.330 --> 04:34:11.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:18.590 --> 04:34:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:20.689 --> 04:34:20.699 align:start position:0%
are there any up yep representative
 
04:34:23.990 --> 04:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
Rushford yes thank you madam chair so
 
04:34:27.769 --> 04:34:27.779 align:start position:0%
Federal recoveries what is that is this
 
04:34:30.590 --> 04:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
is the Fed feds give you fund you Monday
 
04:34:32.390 --> 04:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
through grants is that is that what that
 
04:34:32.400 --> 04:34:35.550 align:start position:0%
through grants is that is that what that
is

04:34:35.550 --> 04:34:35.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:35.560 --> 04:34:37.551 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:34:37.551 --> 04:34:37.561 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:34:40.369 --> 04:34:40.379 align:start position:0%
indirect charge on all of our federal
 
04:34:43.730 --> 04:34:43.740 align:start position:0%
grants and we have 50 plus different
 
04:34:45.551 --> 04:34:45.561 align:start position:0%
federal grants
 
04:34:49.689 --> 04:34:49.699 align:start position:0%
and we do a formula-based methodology
 
04:34:53.029 --> 04:34:53.039 align:start position:0%
every year on an annual basis and it
 
04:34:56.631 --> 04:34:56.641 align:start position:0%
runs between 18 and 19 percent and again
 
04:35:00.590 --> 04:35:00.600 align:start position:0%
that is a charge to be able to pay for
 
04:35:02.449 --> 04:35:02.459 align:start position:0%
the overhead of people in the business
 
04:35:06.230 --> 04:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
office and the director's office that do
 
04:35:08.150 --> 04:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
not directly charge federal grants
 
04:35:10.429 --> 04:35:10.439 align:start position:0%
that's what those funds are so similar
 
04:35:12.289 --> 04:35:12.299 align:start position:0%
to that miscellaneous sales and income
 
04:35:15.529 --> 04:35:15.539 align:start position:0%
where you said 300 of that was to cover
 
04:35:17.810 --> 04:35:17.820 align:start position:0%
you charge yourself we charge our own
 
04:35:19.609 --> 04:35:19.619 align:start position:0%
dedicated accounts yes sir all right
 
04:35:21.949 --> 04:35:21.959 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
04:35:24.890 --> 04:35:24.900 align:start position:0%
representative orrs
 
04:35:26.689 --> 04:35:26.699 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
04:35:29.990 --> 04:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question the safe hiking pass
 
04:35:32.750 --> 04:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
is that included in these numbers it is
 
04:35:35.090 --> 04:35:35.100 align:start position:0%
not that's a dedicated revenue and that
 
04:35:37.250 --> 04:35:37.260 align:start position:0%
goes directly into the search and rescue
 
04:35:37.260 --> 04:35:38.390 align:start position:0%
goes directly into the search and rescue
account

04:35:38.390 --> 04:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
account
 
04:35:43.449 --> 04:35:43.459 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:47.510 --> 04:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
all right go ahead may we ask a further
 
04:35:49.970 --> 04:35:49.980 align:start position:0%
questions uh regarding the uh safe
 
04:35:53.090 --> 04:35:53.100 align:start position:0%
hiking and the the rescue aspect of Fish
 
04:35:56.570 --> 04:35:56.580 align:start position:0%
and Game which uh I understand takes up
 
04:36:01.369 --> 04:36:01.379 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:04.131 --> 04:36:04.141 align:start position:0%
that's restricted funds but it is
 
04:36:06.289 --> 04:36:06.299 align:start position:0%
restricted funds yeah so that's not in
 
04:36:08.631 --> 04:36:08.641 align:start position:0%
our peer review really oh would you want
 
04:36:10.131 --> 04:36:10.141 align:start position:0%
to yeah you guys just are curious about
 
04:36:11.890 --> 04:36:11.900 align:start position:0%
everything I love it
 
04:36:14.990 --> 04:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
I I specifically told the director there
 
04:36:17.769 --> 04:36:17.779 align:start position:0%
would be no other questions other than
 
04:36:23.510 --> 04:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:25.609 --> 04:36:25.619 align:start position:0%
however the uh I would like to know
 
04:36:27.529 --> 04:36:27.539 align:start position:0%
whether or not that safe hiking passes
 
04:36:31.010 --> 04:36:31.020 align:start position:0%
is making us a significant impact or
 
04:36:33.051 --> 04:36:33.061 align:start position:0%
whether and because that came before
 
04:36:34.869 --> 04:36:34.879 align:start position:0%
this committee when it went into effect
 
04:36:37.189 --> 04:36:37.199 align:start position:0%
it absolutely is
 
04:36:40.070 --> 04:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
and it is making an impact it is helping
 
04:36:46.609 --> 04:36:46.619 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:49.070 --> 04:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
covering a lot of the variable expenses
 
04:36:51.051 --> 04:36:51.061 align:start position:0%
associated with search and rescue but
 
04:36:53.150 --> 04:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
it's not generating enough income yet to
 
04:36:53.160 --> 04:36:54.529 align:start position:0%
it's not generating enough income yet to
cover

04:36:54.529 --> 04:36:54.539 align:start position:0%
cover
 
04:36:58.070 --> 04:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
um the hourly wage and benefits of the
 
04:36:59.929 --> 04:36:59.939 align:start position:0%
COS that are involved in it but it does
 
04:37:01.990 --> 04:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
cover like any overtime
 
04:37:04.869 --> 04:37:04.879 align:start position:0%
equipment purchases that kind of stuff
 
04:37:07.670 --> 04:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair for me one
 
04:37:10.189 --> 04:37:10.199 align:start position:0%
further question follow-up if you
 
04:37:12.650 --> 04:37:12.660 align:start position:0%
believe that it's not generating
 
04:37:15.051 --> 04:37:15.061 align:start position:0%
sufficient income could your office
 
04:37:17.269 --> 04:37:17.279 align:start position:0%
examine that to determine whether or not
 
04:37:20.510 --> 04:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
a fee increase may be appropriate and
 
04:37:24.349 --> 04:37:24.359 align:start position:0%
perhaps reach out to uh this committee
 
04:37:26.570 --> 04:37:26.580 align:start position:0%
as to uh modifications that may be
 
04:37:29.269 --> 04:37:29.279 align:start position:0%
necessary before the filing period for
 
04:37:31.609 --> 04:37:31.619 align:start position:0%
future legislation
 
04:37:33.230 --> 04:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
um actually last year the legislature
 
04:37:34.609 --> 04:37:34.619 align:start position:0%
gave us the power to go through
 
04:37:36.590 --> 04:37:36.600 align:start position:0%
rulemaking to set the fee on hike safe
 
04:37:39.349 --> 04:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
cards like on our licenses
 
04:37:41.631 --> 04:37:41.641 align:start position:0%
um right now we are trying to we're
 
04:37:43.910 --> 04:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
working with some outside groups like
 
04:37:46.189 --> 04:37:46.199 align:start position:0%
U.S forest Service
 
04:37:47.631 --> 04:37:47.641 align:start position:0%
um spin-off and some of the other groups
 
04:37:50.269 --> 04:37:50.279 align:start position:0%
to look at ways that we might be able to
 
04:37:53.869 --> 04:37:53.879 align:start position:0%
increase sales at the existing price
 
04:37:55.551 --> 04:37:55.561 align:start position:0%
um you know we're just scratching the
 
04:37:57.830 --> 04:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
market right now we know we're not
 
04:37:59.449 --> 04:37:59.459 align:start position:0%
selling to everybody that's going hiking
 
04:38:01.010 --> 04:38:01.020 align:start position:0%
and if we can try to change that and
 
04:38:03.109 --> 04:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
increase those sales that would serve
 
04:38:04.609 --> 04:38:04.619 align:start position:0%
the same purpose
 
04:38:08.269 --> 04:38:08.279 align:start position:0%
it is voluntary yeah Madam chair yeah it
 
04:38:10.010 --> 04:38:10.020 align:start position:0%
is voluntary and I know several other
 
04:38:12.769 --> 04:38:12.779 align:start position:0%
states that have a a similar uh
 
04:38:16.131 --> 04:38:16.141 align:start position:0%
environment that uh have been taking a
 
04:38:18.590 --> 04:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
good long look at that as a method so we
 
04:38:19.970 --> 04:38:19.980 align:start position:0%
actually have had
 
04:38:22.189 --> 04:38:22.199 align:start position:0%
um phone calls from as far away as Spain
 
04:38:22.199 --> 04:38:23.869 align:start position:0%
um phone calls from as far away as Spain
from

04:38:23.869 --> 04:38:23.879 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:38:26.150 --> 04:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
other folks that are looking at trying
 
04:38:28.429 --> 04:38:28.439 align:start position:0%
to to come up with the same similar
 
04:38:30.609 --> 04:38:30.619 align:start position:0%
program to this
 
04:38:33.590 --> 04:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
representative fellows right thank you
 
04:38:33.600 --> 04:38:34.609 align:start position:0%
representative fellows right thank you
okay

04:38:34.609 --> 04:38:34.619 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:38:36.709 --> 04:38:36.719 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering if you did something
 
04:38:40.631 --> 04:38:40.641 align:start position:0%
like when they bought the hiking card
 
04:38:43.189 --> 04:38:43.199 align:start position:0%
that you gave them something like one of
 
04:38:46.070 --> 04:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
those mylar blankets at the same time
 
04:38:47.750 --> 04:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
that might be an incentive but that's
 
04:38:51.051 --> 04:38:51.061 align:start position:0%
not my question my question is what what
 
04:38:55.670 --> 04:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
is why is it so long high on line four
 
04:39:02.869 --> 04:39:02.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:07.369 --> 04:39:07.379 align:start position:0%
um we sold our Brentwood Game Farm
 
04:39:11.150 --> 04:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
that is when we sold Brentwood and the
 
04:39:14.330 --> 04:39:14.340 align:start position:0%
revenue was deposited into our
 
04:39:19.609 --> 04:39:19.619 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:23.269 --> 04:39:23.279 align:start position:0%
in those revenues subsequently were used
 
04:39:26.090 --> 04:39:26.100 align:start position:0%
and this was part of that sale they were
 
04:39:29.990 --> 04:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
subsequently used as matching funds for
 
04:39:32.570 --> 04:39:32.580 align:start position:0%
a one million dollar branch
 
04:39:37.250 --> 04:39:37.260 align:start position:0%
for our Reserve program for the Glencove
 
04:39:42.170 --> 04:39:42.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:45.610 --> 04:39:45.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:47.690 --> 04:39:47.700 align:start position:0%
representative janaian
 
04:39:49.610 --> 04:39:49.620 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so if that was
 
04:39:52.250 --> 04:39:52.260 align:start position:0%
used for one time does that mean
 
04:39:54.230 --> 04:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
this is going away after this
 
04:39:59.030 --> 04:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
miscellaneous um item then we'll drop so
 
04:40:00.590 --> 04:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
it was a capital sale it was a real
 
04:40:02.150 --> 04:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
estate sale it was a real estate sale
 
04:40:02.160 --> 04:40:06.410 align:start position:0%
estate sale it was a real estate sale
yeah

04:40:06.410 --> 04:40:06.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:08.750 --> 04:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
04:40:11.030 --> 04:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
representative all me a different
 
04:40:14.750 --> 04:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
question on the same thing if this is
 
04:40:16.788 --> 04:40:16.798 align:start position:0%
supposed to be unrestricted Revenue
 
04:40:19.130 --> 04:40:19.140 align:start position:0%
going to the general fund
 
04:40:21.288 --> 04:40:21.298 align:start position:0%
how were you able to use it as a
 
04:40:24.590 --> 04:40:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:28.130 --> 04:40:28.140 align:start position:0%
we designated the funds sorry we
 
04:40:28.140 --> 04:40:29.750 align:start position:0%
we designated the funds sorry we
designated

04:40:29.750 --> 04:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
designated
 
04:40:33.110 --> 04:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
to be able to use unrestricted fishing
 
04:40:38.208 --> 04:40:38.218 align:start position:0%
game funds to match those Grant funds
 
04:40:41.510 --> 04:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
as all grants the funds are not used
 
04:40:45.110 --> 04:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
until the expenses incurred so the funds
 
04:40:47.690 --> 04:40:47.700 align:start position:0%
actually just sit in the unrestricted
 
04:40:50.270 --> 04:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
Fish and Game fund until the expenses
 
04:40:53.270 --> 04:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
incurred and then we use the funds so
 
04:40:54.948 --> 04:40:54.958 align:start position:0%
really they're just sitting in a pot
 
04:40:54.958 --> 04:40:56.770 align:start position:0%
really they're just sitting in a pot
until

04:40:56.770 --> 04:40:56.780 align:start position:0%
until
 
04:41:02.390 --> 04:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:02.400 --> 04:41:05.050 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:41:05.050 --> 04:41:05.060 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:41:08.810 --> 04:41:08.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:11.930 --> 04:41:11.940 align:start position:0%
this is an unrestricted fund within
 
04:41:13.788 --> 04:41:13.798 align:start position:0%
fishing game
 
04:41:16.310 --> 04:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
that we're looking at or this is these
 
04:41:18.890 --> 04:41:18.900 align:start position:0%
are all unrestricted within fish the
 
04:41:22.368 --> 04:41:22.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:25.250 --> 04:41:25.260 align:start position:0%
okay so no general fund involved in this
 
04:41:28.010 --> 04:41:28.020 align:start position:0%
no not at all there are no General funds
 
04:41:30.128 --> 04:41:30.138 align:start position:0%
here yeah
 
04:41:32.270 --> 04:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
so then
 
04:41:35.150 --> 04:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
under all of this
 
04:41:40.310 --> 04:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
is the 50 plus or whatever no that's
 
04:41:43.270 --> 04:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
federal grants but uh
 
04:41:46.730 --> 04:41:46.740 align:start position:0%
however many sub funds you've dedicated
 
04:41:49.850 --> 04:41:49.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:49.860 --> 04:41:51.708 align:start position:0%
 
15

04:41:51.708 --> 04:41:51.718 align:start position:0%
15
 
04:41:53.930 --> 04:41:53.940 align:start position:0%
they're only 15. we have about 15
 
04:41:56.330 --> 04:41:56.340 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds so we've Consolidated
 
04:41:58.070 --> 04:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
just about everything it used to be
 
04:41:59.690 --> 04:41:59.700 align:start position:0%
about 50.
 
04:42:06.788 --> 04:42:06.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:08.930 --> 04:42:08.940 align:start position:0%
representative Malloy has a question or
 
04:42:11.330 --> 04:42:11.340 align:start position:0%
comment thank you madam chair thank you
 
04:42:13.850 --> 04:42:13.860 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
04:42:15.288 --> 04:42:15.298 align:start position:0%
would you believe that I live in
 
04:42:17.510 --> 04:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
Greenland and we do appreciate your uh
 
04:42:19.490 --> 04:42:19.500 align:start position:0%
work on Glencove
 
04:42:23.830 --> 04:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:26.510 --> 04:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
representative Morris thank you madam
 
04:42:27.948 --> 04:42:27.958 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
04:42:30.970 --> 04:42:30.980 align:start position:0%
question do you folks keep statistics
 
04:42:34.788 --> 04:42:34.798 align:start position:0%
on recovery and rescue from various
 
04:42:37.730 --> 04:42:37.740 align:start position:0%
States in other words if you rescued or
 
04:42:39.650 --> 04:42:39.660 align:start position:0%
recovered 100 bodies
 
04:42:42.410 --> 04:42:42.420 align:start position:0%
honey do you have a Breakout by state
 
04:42:45.470 --> 04:42:45.480 align:start position:0%
and if so should we be charging more for
 
04:42:53.090 --> 04:42:53.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:54.470 --> 04:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't get away with it for
 
04:42:55.970 --> 04:42:55.980 align:start position:0%
very long
 
04:42:55.980 --> 04:42:58.190 align:start position:0%
very long
um

04:42:58.190 --> 04:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:02.448 --> 04:43:02.458 align:start position:0%
so when we do a rescue if
 
04:43:02.458 --> 04:43:03.050 align:start position:0%
so when we do a rescue if
um

04:43:03.050 --> 04:43:03.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:05.690 --> 04:43:05.700 align:start position:0%
the person first of all obviously we
 
04:43:08.868 --> 04:43:08.878 align:start position:0%
want to make sure to encourage people to
 
04:43:10.610 --> 04:43:10.620 align:start position:0%
pick you know to call for help when they
 
04:43:12.170 --> 04:43:12.180 align:start position:0%
when they need help you want that call
 
04:43:14.390 --> 04:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
to take place we never want to have
 
04:43:16.128 --> 04:43:16.138 align:start position:0%
somebody sit there and and worry about
 
04:43:19.128 --> 04:43:19.138 align:start position:0%
paying for the rescue and therefore not
 
04:43:21.830 --> 04:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
making the call and therefore having you
 
04:43:26.270 --> 04:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
know turning an incident into a tragedy
 
04:43:29.390 --> 04:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
um but we do have the authority
 
04:43:33.110 --> 04:43:33.120 align:start position:0%
um in certain cases uh to collect the
 
04:43:35.570 --> 04:43:35.580 align:start position:0%
costs of a rescue
 
04:43:37.430 --> 04:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
um and that goes through the Attorney
 
04:43:39.230 --> 04:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
General's office they approve each and
 
04:43:41.390 --> 04:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
every one of these that we bill out and
 
04:43:43.010 --> 04:43:43.020 align:start position:0%
then we build those out and we do
 
04:43:45.230 --> 04:43:45.240 align:start position:0%
collect money regardless of the state of
 
04:43:48.830 --> 04:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
residency it runs off the top of my head
 
04:43:51.110 --> 04:43:51.120 align:start position:0%
I would think it's running about 50 50
 
04:43:52.970 --> 04:43:52.980 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents and and out of
 
04:43:55.910 --> 04:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
state folks as far as that goes we also
 
04:43:59.090 --> 04:43:59.100 align:start position:0%
have the authority to charge people
 
04:44:03.490 --> 04:44:03.500 align:start position:0%
um and I apologize that Reckless conduct
 
04:44:06.850 --> 04:44:06.860 align:start position:0%
negligence if you've done something
 
04:44:09.410 --> 04:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
that is excuse me
 
04:44:13.970 --> 04:44:13.980 align:start position:0%
called the Darwin fee I'm sorry
 
04:44:16.190 --> 04:44:16.200 align:start position:0%
so if you've done something that is now
 
04:44:20.570 --> 04:44:20.580 align:start position:0%
putting the rescuer's life at risk
 
04:44:22.610 --> 04:44:22.620 align:start position:0%
um we have the the ability to to charge
 
04:44:24.470 --> 04:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
somebody with criminal penalty and this
 
04:44:29.990 --> 04:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:32.750 --> 04:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:44:34.550 --> 04:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much for your
 
04:44:37.490 --> 04:44:37.500 align:start position:0%
presentation we really appreciate it
 
04:44:39.110 --> 04:44:39.120 align:start position:0%
Chris do you want to come join us for a
 
04:44:42.470 --> 04:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:42.480 --> 04:45:24.470 align:start position:0%
 
ah

04:45:24.470 --> 04:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:27.410 --> 04:45:27.420 align:start position:0%
Chris remind me how many more agencies
 
04:45:30.410 --> 04:45:30.420 align:start position:0%
have we not had an initial presentation
 
04:45:30.420 --> 04:45:32.628 align:start position:0%
have we not had an initial presentation
from

04:45:32.628 --> 04:45:32.638 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:45:34.910 --> 04:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
so you've had presentations from The
 
04:45:37.430 --> 04:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
Usual Suspects that they come to Ways
 
04:45:38.810 --> 04:45:38.820 align:start position:0%
and Means everybody's been through at
 
04:45:41.628 --> 04:45:41.638 align:start position:0%
least once okay good um
 
04:45:45.170 --> 04:45:45.180 align:start position:0%
tentatively penciled in Wednesday
 
04:45:48.410 --> 04:45:48.420 align:start position:0%
February 22nd as a day to do more
 
04:45:52.190 --> 04:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
and right now I have dra
 
04:45:54.410 --> 04:45:54.420 align:start position:0%
and the governor's budget director
 
04:45:56.690 --> 04:45:56.700 align:start position:0%
penciled in but I do know that February
 
04:46:00.170 --> 04:46:00.180 align:start position:0%
22nd is potentially a session day
 
04:46:03.410 --> 04:46:03.420 align:start position:0%
so I've made a dra aware I haven't
 
04:46:06.110 --> 04:46:06.120 align:start position:0%
contacted the governor's budget director
 
04:46:09.288 --> 04:46:09.298 align:start position:0%
yet but what I suggested to the
 
04:46:10.970 --> 04:46:10.980 align:start position:0%
commissioner of dra is that if for some
 
04:46:13.190 --> 04:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
reason the 22nd doesn't work we'll try
 
04:46:18.890 --> 04:46:18.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:18.900 --> 04:46:20.208 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:46:20.208 --> 04:46:20.218 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:46:20.218 --> 04:46:21.288 align:start position:0%
yes
um

04:46:21.288 --> 04:46:21.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:24.830 --> 04:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
because obviously the 27th 28th March
 
04:46:26.990 --> 04:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
1st that's when we really want to start
 
04:46:30.490 --> 04:46:30.500 align:start position:0%
getting our projections done because
 
04:46:33.070 --> 04:46:33.080 align:start position:0%
finances bugging me daily
 
04:46:35.930 --> 04:46:35.940 align:start position:0%
to get those and of course our hands are
 
04:46:37.850 --> 04:46:37.860 align:start position:0%
slightly tight until we hear the
 
04:46:40.250 --> 04:46:40.260 align:start position:0%
governor's budget which is next
 
04:46:43.788 --> 04:46:43.798 align:start position:0%
Tuesday right yeah next Tuesday so we're
 
04:46:45.530 --> 04:46:45.540 align:start position:0%
a little bit tired until then but we
 
04:46:47.208 --> 04:46:47.218 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that we can get it
 
04:46:49.610 --> 04:46:49.620 align:start position:0%
done soon thereafter so
 
04:46:52.490 --> 04:46:52.500 align:start position:0%
so as of this morning we have dra coming
 
04:46:55.430 --> 04:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
back on Monday the 13th they'll be here
 
04:46:57.230 --> 04:46:57.240 align:start position:0%
from 10 to noonish
 
04:46:59.570 --> 04:46:59.580 align:start position:0%
so that you can finish the they can
 
04:47:01.250 --> 04:47:01.260 align:start position:0%
finish their presentation to you but as
 
04:47:03.230 --> 04:47:03.240 align:start position:0%
well if there's questions that you had
 
04:47:05.208 --> 04:47:05.218 align:start position:0%
left over from today you can re-ask
 
04:47:07.250 --> 04:47:07.260 align:start position:0%
those so if you know you're thinking
 
04:47:08.868 --> 04:47:08.878 align:start position:0%
about the material that they provided
 
04:47:10.490 --> 04:47:10.500 align:start position:0%
and reading it over the weekend you're
 
04:47:12.650 --> 04:47:12.660 align:start position:0%
like oh geez I a little confused on this
 
04:47:15.590 --> 04:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
bet and how it might re you know
 
04:47:17.930 --> 04:47:17.940 align:start position:0%
interplay with BPT you could re-ask that
 
04:47:19.788 --> 04:47:19.798 align:start position:0%
question to try to sort that out before
 
04:47:21.708 --> 04:47:21.718 align:start position:0%
we get into
 
04:47:21.718 --> 04:47:22.628 align:start position:0%
we get into
um

04:47:22.628 --> 04:47:22.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:24.948 --> 04:47:24.958 align:start position:0%
dra sitting with you and doing the
 
04:47:27.410 --> 04:47:27.420 align:start position:0%
estimate ranges because I think as you
 
04:47:28.610 --> 04:47:28.620 align:start position:0%
heard from the commissioner today
 
04:47:29.868 --> 04:47:29.878 align:start position:0%
they're gonna
 
04:47:31.850 --> 04:47:31.860 align:start position:0%
try to account for some aspects of the
 
04:47:33.288 --> 04:47:33.298 align:start position:0%
changes in law but they're going to try
 
04:47:34.910 --> 04:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
to show it separately so it's going to
 
04:47:37.190 --> 04:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
be a little bit different I think for
 
04:47:40.310 --> 04:47:40.320 align:start position:0%
members that are veterans to Ways and
 
04:47:41.930 --> 04:47:41.940 align:start position:0%
Means for new people it's not going to
 
04:47:44.150 --> 04:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
be as anything different but for those
 
04:47:45.530 --> 04:47:45.540 align:start position:0%
that have been here before it may look a
 
04:47:46.788 --> 04:47:46.798 align:start position:0%
little bit different in some of the way
 
04:47:49.368 --> 04:47:49.378 align:start position:0%
they show their projections which may
 
04:47:52.788 --> 04:47:52.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:55.788 --> 04:47:55.798 align:start position:0%
just as a reminder Chris will be
 
04:47:59.270 --> 04:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
populating a big spreadsheet with what
 
04:48:00.470 --> 04:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
the agency
 
04:48:02.990 --> 04:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
projections are so what you have heard
 
04:48:05.930 --> 04:48:05.940 align:start position:0%
up to this point from the agencies
 
04:48:07.310 --> 04:48:07.320 align:start position:0%
um so like for instance today with the
 
04:48:09.410 --> 04:48:09.420 align:start position:0%
other Revenue I'll be putting that into
 
04:48:13.128 --> 04:48:13.138 align:start position:0%
this Excel spreadsheet that will show
 
04:48:14.628 --> 04:48:14.638 align:start position:0%
you what the other Revenue projections
 
04:48:16.368 --> 04:48:16.378 align:start position:0%
are but from the agency's point of view
 
04:48:18.110 --> 04:48:18.120 align:start position:0%
right so that you'll have everything in
 
04:48:19.670 --> 04:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
front of you
 
04:48:21.350 --> 04:48:21.360 align:start position:0%
um you also will have what the governor
 
04:48:23.030 --> 04:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
is recommending
 
04:48:25.910 --> 04:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
you'll have what the plan was for 23.
 
04:48:28.070 --> 04:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
and you'll have what the plan was for 22
 
04:48:30.650 --> 04:48:30.660 align:start position:0%
and what the actual Revenue was for 22.
 
04:48:32.570 --> 04:48:32.580 align:start position:0%
so you'll have a little bit of History
 
04:48:34.730 --> 04:48:34.740 align:start position:0%
right in front of you as you look at the
 
04:48:37.430 --> 04:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
um the information that's coming at you
 
04:48:40.010 --> 04:48:40.020 align:start position:0%
dra until I see what they're providing
 
04:48:41.868 --> 04:48:41.878 align:start position:0%
I'll figure out how we might have to
 
04:48:43.970 --> 04:48:43.980 align:start position:0%
show that to you if it's going to have
 
04:48:45.708 --> 04:48:45.718 align:start position:0%
multiple levels that may not fit in the
 
04:48:49.128 --> 04:48:49.138 align:start position:0%
traditional spreadsheet that we've used
 
04:48:49.138 --> 04:48:50.150 align:start position:0%
traditional spreadsheet that we've used
um

04:48:50.150 --> 04:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:53.270 --> 04:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
the only agency that not the only agency
 
04:48:55.550 --> 04:48:55.560 align:start position:0%
excuse me the one agency you do need to
 
04:48:58.490 --> 04:48:58.500 align:start position:0%
have come back as a lottery when they
 
04:49:00.350 --> 04:49:00.360 align:start position:0%
presented before you they didn't provide
 
04:49:04.788 --> 04:49:04.798 align:start position:0%
you with their 23 24 25 estimates
 
04:49:04.798 --> 04:49:05.810 align:start position:0%
you with their 23 24 25 estimates
um

04:49:05.810 --> 04:49:05.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:09.170 --> 04:49:09.180 align:start position:0%
I could ask Charlie uh director McIntyre
 
04:49:11.208 --> 04:49:11.218 align:start position:0%
if maybe he wants if the committee is up
 
04:49:14.868 --> 04:49:14.878 align:start position:0%
for it poke his head in on Monday
 
04:49:16.850 --> 04:49:16.860 align:start position:0%
you know in the uh you know come in at
 
04:49:18.590 --> 04:49:18.600 align:start position:0%
noon at the end of Lindsay's
 
04:49:20.570 --> 04:49:20.580 align:start position:0%
presentation and and just give you a
 
04:49:23.330 --> 04:49:23.340 align:start position:0%
quick what he thinks is 22 3 24 25 would
 
04:49:24.708 --> 04:49:24.718 align:start position:0%
be or I can put it off to the following
 
04:49:26.510 --> 04:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
yeah let me run it by folks here on that
 
04:49:28.610 --> 04:49:28.620 align:start position:0%
but at a minimum could he email them to
 
04:49:31.430 --> 04:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
us oh sir that would be great as soon as
 
04:49:33.110 --> 04:49:33.120 align:start position:0%
possible so we can start looking at them
 
04:49:34.250 --> 04:49:34.260 align:start position:0%
and then if we feel like we have
 
04:49:36.230 --> 04:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
questions we can see when makes sense
 
04:49:38.150 --> 04:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
from members
 
04:49:38.160 --> 04:49:42.650 align:start position:0%
from members
okay

04:49:42.650 --> 04:49:42.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:45.890 --> 04:49:45.900 align:start position:0%
yeah representative fellows so when we
 
04:49:47.690 --> 04:49:47.700 align:start position:0%
start working on this on the estimates
 
04:49:49.910 --> 04:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
how do we approach it do we like start
 
04:49:52.550 --> 04:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
with the ones that are those the smaller
 
04:49:54.948 --> 04:49:54.958 align:start position:0%
ones and work our way up or how does
 
04:49:56.208 --> 04:49:56.218 align:start position:0%
that go
 
04:49:58.788 --> 04:49:58.798 align:start position:0%
uh let me ask Chris that
 
04:50:00.948 --> 04:50:00.958 align:start position:0%
it's been a while since I saw that
 
04:50:02.150 --> 04:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet how do you how do you have
 
04:50:05.510 --> 04:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:07.788 --> 04:50:07.798 align:start position:0%
well I have it it's it's organized on
 
04:50:10.910 --> 04:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
how it's presented okay in the in the
 
04:50:13.250 --> 04:50:13.260 align:start position:0%
budget I guess for me personally taxes
 
04:50:15.830 --> 04:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
and then it'll go through to recoveries
 
04:50:18.890 --> 04:50:18.900 align:start position:0%
is the last thing I think
 
04:50:20.330 --> 04:50:20.340 align:start position:0%
the committee has approached it in
 
04:50:22.190 --> 04:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
different ways over the years sometimes
 
04:50:23.868 --> 04:50:23.878 align:start position:0%
the committee will try to get those
 
04:50:26.090 --> 04:50:26.100 align:start position:0%
revenues that are easy or not
 
04:50:28.190 --> 04:50:28.200 align:start position:0%
contentious out of the way
 
04:50:29.990 --> 04:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
that you're going to say swept is going
 
04:50:32.030 --> 04:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
to be 363 million
 
04:50:33.830 --> 04:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
statutes going to guide that so you say
 
04:50:35.708 --> 04:50:35.718 align:start position:0%
okay we can agree to that
 
04:50:38.750 --> 04:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
just as an example you may say that the
 
04:50:40.250 --> 04:50:40.260 align:start position:0%
other Revenue you know we're going to
 
04:50:42.230 --> 04:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
trust with the treasurer and the
 
04:50:44.090 --> 04:50:44.100 align:start position:0%
Comptroller has put before us and we're
 
04:50:46.070 --> 04:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that number we're
 
04:50:48.470 --> 04:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
comfortable with Securities we're not so
 
04:50:49.970 --> 04:50:49.980 align:start position:0%
comfortable with liquor so we want to
 
04:50:51.170 --> 04:50:51.180 align:start position:0%
hold that for a minute because we want
 
04:50:52.910 --> 04:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
to consider some things with liquor so
 
04:50:55.250 --> 04:50:55.260 align:start position:0%
it would really be up to you know the
 
04:50:58.010 --> 04:50:58.020 align:start position:0%
committee and the chairs to or the chair
 
04:51:00.410 --> 04:51:00.420 align:start position:0%
to decide how you want to kind of tackle
 
04:51:02.150 --> 04:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
I guess that was my thought while we're
 
04:51:03.288 --> 04:51:03.298 align:start position:0%
talking about this is we'll start with
 
04:51:05.510 --> 04:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
some easy stuff first that you know like
 
04:51:07.010 --> 04:51:07.020 align:start position:0%
some of the numbers we looked at were
 
04:51:08.390 --> 04:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
fairly small
 
04:51:11.510 --> 04:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
there's not much wiggle room there we'll
 
04:51:12.650 --> 04:51:12.660 align:start position:0%
probably start with some of the easier
 
04:51:14.510 --> 04:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
stuff first
 
04:51:16.490 --> 04:51:16.500 align:start position:0%
um and then start having conversations
 
04:51:18.890 --> 04:51:18.900 align:start position:0%
about maybe the more controversial I
 
04:51:20.628 --> 04:51:20.638 align:start position:0%
don't know liquor maybe one
 
04:51:23.330 --> 04:51:23.340 align:start position:0%
um and see where we are and look at the
 
04:51:25.430 --> 04:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
range of possibilities there and then we
 
04:51:26.930 --> 04:51:26.940 align:start position:0%
might have to caucus
 
04:51:29.090 --> 04:51:29.100 align:start position:0%
and see where each side is on and then
 
04:51:31.128 --> 04:51:31.138 align:start position:0%
come back and see what we can you know
 
04:51:31.850 --> 04:51:31.860 align:start position:0%
if we're gonna have two different
 
04:51:34.010 --> 04:51:34.020 align:start position:0%
numbers or we're gonna have one average
 
04:51:36.470 --> 04:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
or how we want to handle that but some
 
04:51:38.030 --> 04:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
might take several discussions we want
 
04:51:40.128 --> 04:51:40.138 align:start position:0%
to start and then come back to it
 
04:51:42.170 --> 04:51:42.180 align:start position:0%
some will be easy and you know obviously
 
04:51:44.628 --> 04:51:44.638 align:start position:0%
all the dra numbers are going to be a
 
04:51:47.090 --> 04:51:47.100 align:start position:0%
lot more thoughtful so we might need to
 
04:51:49.368 --> 04:51:49.378 align:start position:0%
come back the next day to do it again
 
04:51:49.378 --> 04:51:51.288 align:start position:0%
come back the next day to do it again
yes

04:51:51.288 --> 04:51:51.298 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:51:53.510 --> 04:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm thinking that some of them
 
04:51:57.590 --> 04:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
can be impacted by things like
 
04:52:02.030 --> 04:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
um inflation and job reports and so I'm
 
04:52:04.190 --> 04:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
thinking though you know you can't push
 
04:52:06.948 --> 04:52:06.958 align:start position:0%
them out too far but we might be able to
 
04:52:08.868 --> 04:52:08.878 align:start position:0%
get like a little bit more information
 
04:52:12.410 --> 04:52:12.420 align:start position:0%
on some of those factors I'm just mostly
 
04:52:14.690 --> 04:52:14.700 align:start position:0%
thinking about business Enterprise and
 
04:52:17.090 --> 04:52:17.100 align:start position:0%
business profits
 
04:52:20.330 --> 04:52:20.340 align:start position:0%
yeah in fact we had an economist come to
 
04:52:23.570 --> 04:52:23.580 align:start position:0%
our economic briefing back
 
04:52:26.510 --> 04:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
early January I guess it was and we he
 
04:52:28.730 --> 04:52:28.740 align:start position:0%
had only had data through a certain
 
04:52:31.730 --> 04:52:31.740 align:start position:0%
point and we'd asked for a an upgrade on
 
04:52:34.670 --> 04:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
that do you remember who that was
 
04:52:37.250 --> 04:52:37.260 align:start position:0%
that Brian yeah
 
04:52:38.570 --> 04:52:38.580 align:start position:0%
yeah maybe him and then there was
 
04:52:40.670 --> 04:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
someone else from an outside bank or
 
04:52:40.680 --> 04:52:41.510 align:start position:0%
someone else from an outside bank or
something

04:52:41.510 --> 04:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
something
 
04:52:41.520 --> 04:52:42.770 align:start position:0%
something
um

04:52:42.770 --> 04:52:42.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:52:45.110 --> 04:52:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh I'll have to go look at my notes um
 
04:52:47.030 --> 04:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
but yeah it would be great if we could
 
04:52:49.128 --> 04:52:49.138 align:start position:0%
go back to them and and see if they
 
04:52:50.628 --> 04:52:50.638 align:start position:0%
could have an update
 
04:52:52.368 --> 04:52:52.378 align:start position:0%
and they could at least just email it to
 
04:52:54.890 --> 04:52:54.900 align:start position:0%
us yeah representative ulery or
 
04:52:57.230 --> 04:52:57.240 align:start position:0%
Southworth I can't see a hand thank you
 
04:53:00.650 --> 04:53:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:01.970 --> 04:53:01.980 align:start position:0%
you know I was just going to add the
 
04:53:04.430 --> 04:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
last few times have gone really smoothly
 
04:53:07.190 --> 04:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
and um you know I'm just not sure we
 
04:53:09.470 --> 04:53:09.480 align:start position:0%
want to make any major changes in the
 
04:53:12.050 --> 04:53:12.060 align:start position:0%
process what he's done before he's had a
 
04:53:13.368 --> 04:53:13.378 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet it actually started with
 
04:53:15.530 --> 04:53:15.540 align:start position:0%
business taxes it had the highest and
 
04:53:18.350 --> 04:53:18.360 align:start position:0%
lows recommended by dra we all got that
 
04:53:18.360 --> 04:53:19.910 align:start position:0%
lows recommended by dra we all got that
ahead

04:53:19.910 --> 04:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
04:53:21.770 --> 04:53:21.780 align:start position:0%
um the caucus has got to talk and think
 
04:53:23.930 --> 04:53:23.940 align:start position:0%
ahead and then when we sat down we were
 
04:53:26.750 --> 04:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
ready and we just went through and
 
04:53:28.430 --> 04:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes it was near lunch we'd say
 
04:53:31.190 --> 04:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
can't we polish off an easy one but what
 
04:53:32.930 --> 04:53:32.940 align:start position:0%
he did with us the last several times
 
04:53:35.570 --> 04:53:35.580 align:start position:0%
was very systematic because maybe you
 
04:53:36.530 --> 04:53:36.540 align:start position:0%
know there needs to be a little more
 
04:53:37.910 --> 04:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
communication but I just want to put
 
04:53:39.708 --> 04:53:39.718 align:start position:0%
that out there excellent yes uh and that
 
04:53:41.330 --> 04:53:41.340 align:start position:0%
was my experience several years ago as
 
04:53:43.670 --> 04:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
well that lbao really helps us through
 
04:53:45.590 --> 04:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
this so they'll hold our hands
 
04:53:47.448 --> 04:53:47.458 align:start position:0%
throughout the process
 
04:53:48.770 --> 04:53:48.780 align:start position:0%
representative only did you have
 
04:53:48.780 --> 04:53:54.590 align:start position:0%
representative only did you have
something

04:53:54.590 --> 04:53:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:56.628 --> 04:53:56.638 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah one thing that I hope Chris
 
04:53:59.510 --> 04:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
can follow through with the
 
04:54:04.788 --> 04:54:04.798 align:start position:0%
um I think it was yeah Dana gave us Dana
 
04:54:07.368 --> 04:54:07.378 align:start position:0%
Cole gave us the uh
 
04:54:11.390 --> 04:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
other revenues without the Surplus
 
04:54:13.610 --> 04:54:13.620 align:start position:0%
interest in it
 
04:54:17.330 --> 04:54:17.340 align:start position:0%
and on the treasury gave us Surplus
 
04:54:19.788 --> 04:54:19.798 align:start position:0%
interest right but
 
04:54:23.690 --> 04:54:23.700 align:start position:0%
um just to make sure that on Mr Arling
 
04:54:26.750 --> 04:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
house doesn't disagree with putting that
 
04:54:29.208 --> 04:54:29.218 align:start position:0%
number in there so I I don't know when
 
04:54:30.770 --> 04:54:30.780 align:start position:0%
they were here if you saw me talked
 
04:54:33.170 --> 04:54:33.180 align:start position:0%
about the controller and the treasurer I
 
04:54:34.550 --> 04:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
would confirm that they were okay with
 
04:54:36.050 --> 04:54:36.060 align:start position:0%
taking that interest number and adding
 
04:54:38.090 --> 04:54:38.100 align:start position:0%
it to the other and that's why I had
 
04:54:39.708 --> 04:54:39.718 align:start position:0%
brought it forward to you guys just to
 
04:54:41.390 --> 04:54:41.400 align:start position:0%
make you aware that they were not
 
04:54:43.190 --> 04:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
included the interest was not included
 
04:54:45.050 --> 04:54:45.060 align:start position:0%
in the other and that you may take that
 
04:54:47.150 --> 04:54:47.160 align:start position:0%
what the treasurer is recommending or
 
04:54:48.830 --> 04:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
you may adjust that to be something
 
04:54:51.288 --> 04:54:51.298 align:start position:0%
slightly different depending on the the
 
04:54:54.288 --> 04:54:54.298 align:start position:0%
desire of the committee
 
04:54:56.570 --> 04:54:56.580 align:start position:0%
um and if I could just back up to
 
04:54:58.128 --> 04:54:58.138 align:start position:0%
representative Southworth and just kind
 
04:55:00.470 --> 04:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
of piggyback onto his comment
 
04:55:02.090 --> 04:55:02.100 align:start position:0%
um I will provide the committee you know
 
04:55:03.708 --> 04:55:03.718 align:start position:0%
as we get a little bit closer with the
 
04:55:05.510 --> 04:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet I'll give it to you in a PDF
 
04:55:07.070 --> 04:55:07.080 align:start position:0%
and I'll give it to you in Excel I'll
 
04:55:09.288 --> 04:55:09.298 align:start position:0%
email it to everybody
 
04:55:09.298 --> 04:55:09.948 align:start position:0%
email it to everybody
um

04:55:09.948 --> 04:55:09.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:12.170 --> 04:55:12.180 align:start position:0%
the Excel would be meant to
 
04:55:14.930 --> 04:55:14.940 align:start position:0%
um work on on your electronic device and
 
04:55:16.610 --> 04:55:16.620 align:start position:0%
make your adjustments don't try to print
 
04:55:17.990 --> 04:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
that because you may run into some
 
04:55:20.208 --> 04:55:20.218 align:start position:0%
issues the PDF would be meant if you
 
04:55:21.708 --> 04:55:21.718 align:start position:0%
wanted to print something but I'll also
 
04:55:23.810 --> 04:55:23.820 align:start position:0%
have hard copies anytime we get together
 
04:55:26.650 --> 04:55:26.660 align:start position:0%
so I would provide you the hard copies
 
04:55:29.810 --> 04:55:29.820 align:start position:0%
but if there was a caucus occurring you
 
04:55:31.430 --> 04:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
may want to print a copy for yourself so
 
04:55:34.190 --> 04:55:34.200 align:start position:0%
you can write it up you know ideas and
 
04:55:37.788 --> 04:55:37.798 align:start position:0%
suggestions or that so I just want to
 
04:55:40.310 --> 04:55:40.320 align:start position:0%
let you know but if at any point you're
 
04:55:41.690 --> 04:55:41.700 align:start position:0%
feeling like you're missing something or
 
04:55:43.250 --> 04:55:43.260 align:start position:0%
you need something please reach out to
 
04:55:45.050 --> 04:55:45.060 align:start position:0%
me you know you have my contact
 
04:55:46.910 --> 04:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
information shoot me an email and say I
 
04:55:48.288 --> 04:55:48.298 align:start position:0%
don't have the worksheet or I don't have
 
04:55:50.270 --> 04:55:50.280 align:start position:0%
this presentation or I need information
 
04:55:53.390 --> 04:55:53.400 align:start position:0%
X let me know and I can get that for you
 
04:55:54.890 --> 04:55:54.900 align:start position:0%
so that you have everything you need as
 
04:55:58.010 --> 04:55:58.020 align:start position:0%
you're working on your Revenue estimates
 
04:56:01.128 --> 04:56:01.138 align:start position:0%
and your ideas and thoughts
 
04:56:02.930 --> 04:56:02.940 align:start position:0%
representative Wars
 
04:56:04.610 --> 04:56:04.620 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thanks for
 
04:56:07.010 --> 04:56:07.020 align:start position:0%
taking my question would the Excel work
 
04:56:08.930 --> 04:56:08.940 align:start position:0%
with the Chromebook version I forget
 
04:56:10.730 --> 04:56:10.740 align:start position:0%
what it's called the spreadsheet in
 
04:56:13.250 --> 04:56:13.260 align:start position:0%
Chrome Chromebook do you know I assume
 
04:56:15.230 --> 04:56:15.240 align:start position:0%
it would I don't know I honestly don't
 
04:56:17.930 --> 04:56:17.940 align:start position:0%
okay we can test it and make sure it
 
04:56:20.690 --> 04:56:20.700 align:start position:0%
does thank you so
 
04:56:23.750 --> 04:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
you're asking a non-it guy
 
04:56:31.610 --> 04:56:31.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:38.208 --> 04:56:38.218 align:start position:0%
what about the idea of on just mostly
 
04:56:40.490 --> 04:56:40.500 align:start position:0%
working this out in caucuses and coming
 
04:56:43.490 --> 04:56:43.500 align:start position:0%
back because I do think that we learn
 
04:56:46.670 --> 04:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
from each other and each of us has a
 
04:56:48.830 --> 04:56:48.840 align:start position:0%
different take on the economy of the
 
04:56:51.650 --> 04:56:51.660 align:start position:0%
state and what it might be doing to the
 
04:56:53.990 --> 04:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
revenues and half of us don't get to
 
04:56:55.910 --> 04:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
hear what the other half are discussing
 
04:56:58.310 --> 04:56:58.320 align:start position:0%
when we do it that way
 
04:57:01.730 --> 04:57:01.740 align:start position:0%
so it does mean more time together but
 
04:57:04.270 --> 04:57:04.280 align:start position:0%
I think it produces a better product
 
04:57:08.208 --> 04:57:08.218 align:start position:0%
speaking as someone who had the upper
 
04:57:11.750 --> 04:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
end of the the revenues estimates last
 
04:57:14.030 --> 04:57:14.040 align:start position:0%
term and
 
04:57:16.788 --> 04:57:16.798 align:start position:0%
your side had the lower end and we just
 
04:57:20.330 --> 04:57:20.340 align:start position:0%
took the median or mean or something of
 
04:57:20.340 --> 04:57:21.310 align:start position:0%
took the median or mean or something of
them

04:57:21.310 --> 04:57:21.320 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:57:24.830 --> 04:57:24.840 align:start position:0%
and the revenues came in above what all
 
04:57:27.530 --> 04:57:27.540 align:start position:0%
of us said so
 
04:57:30.050 --> 04:57:30.060 align:start position:0%
I'm very open-minded I'm here just to
 
04:57:32.448 --> 04:57:32.458 align:start position:0%
help administer the process uh you know
 
04:57:34.070 --> 04:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
your wishes are my command yes
 
04:57:37.670 --> 04:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
representative fellows um yes so one of
 
04:57:39.830 --> 04:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
the statistics that came out recently in
 
04:57:41.930 --> 04:57:41.940 align:start position:0%
the news had to do with
 
04:57:45.708 --> 04:57:45.718 align:start position:0%
um job growth like more people being
 
04:57:49.430 --> 04:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
hired and also about the ratio of
 
04:57:52.910 --> 04:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
uh unfilled position in in people who
 
04:57:57.070 --> 04:57:57.080 align:start position:0%
were looking for work and so I'm really
 
04:57:59.930 --> 04:57:59.940 align:start position:0%
interested in hearing a little more
 
04:58:02.270 --> 04:58:02.280 align:start position:0%
about that because I think that that
 
04:58:04.610 --> 04:58:04.620 align:start position:0%
would have a big impact on business
 
04:58:07.190 --> 04:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
Enterprise taxes and I don't want to
 
04:58:09.288 --> 04:58:09.298 align:start position:0%
slow down the process but if we could
 
04:58:12.288 --> 04:58:12.298 align:start position:0%
have that Economist come and talk to him
 
04:58:14.090 --> 04:58:14.100 align:start position:0%
and even if we only say like you have to
 
04:58:16.368 --> 04:58:16.378 align:start position:0%
keep it to 10 minutes or so 15 minutes
 
04:58:18.590 --> 04:58:18.600 align:start position:0%
something like that just I really would
 
04:58:22.310 --> 04:58:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:23.750 --> 04:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
Chris is that something you could help
 
04:58:25.190 --> 04:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
us with
 
04:58:27.830 --> 04:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
which Economist represent fellows do you
 
04:58:30.770 --> 04:58:30.780 align:start position:0%
mean uh Brian I think it would be easier
 
04:58:32.628 --> 04:58:32.638 align:start position:0%
to get Brian here
 
04:58:34.670 --> 04:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
than it would be the person from The
 
04:58:36.948 --> 04:58:36.958 align:start position:0%
Reserve Bank yeah
 
04:58:38.570 --> 04:58:38.580 align:start position:0%
Reserve Bank person I might see if
 
04:58:40.910 --> 04:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
Jennifer will email that person and if
 
04:58:42.770 --> 04:58:42.780 align:start position:0%
there's an updated report like a simple
 
04:58:45.410 --> 04:58:45.420 align:start position:0%
summary report we could get just to get
 
04:58:47.448 --> 04:58:47.458 align:start position:0%
an update that would be helpful but he
 
04:58:54.650 --> 04:58:54.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:54.660 --> 04:58:57.708 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:58:57.708 --> 04:58:57.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:01.310 --> 04:59:01.320 align:start position:0%
exactly yeah okay if you could reach out
 
04:59:03.050 --> 04:59:03.060 align:start position:0%
to Brian Gottlieb yeah and I try to
 
04:59:05.570 --> 04:59:05.580 align:start position:0%
schedule him for either the 27th or 28th
 
04:59:06.948 --> 04:59:06.958 align:start position:0%
depending on what he's available for
 
04:59:09.230 --> 04:59:09.240 align:start position:0%
yeah just to yeah like you said just
 
04:59:11.030 --> 04:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
brief update because we don't get the
 
04:59:12.890 --> 04:59:12.900 align:start position:0%
full presentation but now we just want
 
04:59:14.628 --> 04:59:14.638 align:start position:0%
to get it updated yeah that would be
 
04:59:14.638 --> 04:59:18.830 align:start position:0%
to get it updated yeah that would be
great

04:59:18.830 --> 04:59:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:22.190 --> 04:59:22.200 align:start position:0%
uh we have settled on dear here dra here
 
04:59:25.010 --> 04:59:25.020 align:start position:0%
to finish what they started today this
 
04:59:27.530 --> 04:59:27.540 align:start position:0%
coming Monday so next Monday February
 
04:59:30.650 --> 04:59:30.660 align:start position:0%
13th from 10 to noon
 
04:59:32.448 --> 04:59:32.458 align:start position:0%
which gives you guys enough time to do
 
04:59:34.310 --> 04:59:34.320 align:start position:0%
what you need to do in the afternoon
 
04:59:37.850 --> 04:59:37.860 align:start position:0%
and then uh
 
04:59:40.250 --> 04:59:40.260 align:start position:0%
it's Monday then on Tuesday we have a
 
04:59:40.260 --> 04:59:41.150 align:start position:0%
it's Monday then on Tuesday we have a
session

04:59:41.150 --> 04:59:41.160 align:start position:0%
session
 
04:59:42.890 --> 04:59:42.900 align:start position:0%
so we're busy with that
 
04:59:44.628 --> 04:59:44.638 align:start position:0%
then what the governor's budget which
 
04:59:46.730 --> 04:59:46.740 align:start position:0%
will help us because we can waiting to
 
04:59:49.430 --> 04:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
see what we got going on there and then
 
04:59:53.150 --> 04:59:53.160 align:start position:0%
the following week uh we'll get going
 
04:59:55.730 --> 04:59:55.740 align:start position:0%
again as best as we can so there's some
 
04:59:57.948 --> 04:59:57.958 align:start position:0%
deadlines coming up for the freshmen so
 
05:00:00.288 --> 05:00:00.298 align:start position:0%
you know that we have to get some
 
05:00:01.910 --> 05:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
committee work done
 
05:00:05.090 --> 05:00:05.100 align:start position:0%
it at a house session and so we're up
 
05:00:06.948 --> 05:00:06.958 align:start position:0%
against a deadline that Wednesday the
 
05:00:09.708 --> 05:00:09.718 align:start position:0%
22nd and Thursday the 23rd so you might
 
05:00:12.110 --> 05:00:12.120 align:start position:0%
have two back-to-back session days so we
 
05:00:13.430 --> 05:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
just don't know yet
 
05:00:15.170 --> 05:00:15.180 align:start position:0%
so that's a little wild card so I I
 
05:00:17.270 --> 05:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
can't schedule too far out there we
 
05:00:18.770 --> 05:00:18.780 align:start position:0%
definitely know
 
05:00:21.650 --> 05:00:21.660 align:start position:0%
the last week of February the Monday
 
05:00:25.670 --> 05:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
February 27th Tuesday 28th March 1st
 
05:00:28.010 --> 05:00:28.020 align:start position:0%
we're getting down in business
 
05:00:28.020 --> 05:00:29.448 align:start position:0%
we're getting down in business
right

05:00:29.448 --> 05:00:29.458 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:00:29.458 --> 05:00:30.490 align:start position:0%
right
yeah

05:00:30.490 --> 05:00:30.500 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:00:32.810 --> 05:00:32.820 align:start position:0%
in the 15th that's right I forgot about
 
05:00:35.990 --> 05:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
that which is next Wednesday
 
05:00:38.750 --> 05:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
I think we should do our remaining Bill
 
05:00:38.760 --> 05:00:40.250 align:start position:0%
I think we should do our remaining Bill
hearings

05:00:40.250 --> 05:00:40.260 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
05:00:44.030 --> 05:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm hoping we can also exec some
 
05:00:46.310 --> 05:00:46.320 align:start position:0%
bills that day the bills that we've
 
05:00:48.170 --> 05:00:48.180 align:start position:0%
already heard
 
05:00:50.150 --> 05:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
so I'll list that they'll list them all
 
05:00:51.530 --> 05:00:51.540 align:start position:0%
and we'll see if we can get that done
 
05:00:53.390 --> 05:00:53.400 align:start position:0%
while we're here
 
05:00:53.400 --> 05:00:58.490 align:start position:0%
while we're here
okay

05:00:58.490 --> 05:00:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:02.570 --> 05:01:02.580 align:start position:0%
no I think there's four plus a bill that
 
05:01:05.510 --> 05:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
was passed through e-dna and then we're
 
05:01:07.010 --> 05:01:07.020 align:start position:0%
the second committee so there may be a
 
05:01:08.930 --> 05:01:08.940 align:start position:0%
total of five bills
 
05:01:12.410 --> 05:01:12.420 align:start position:0%
some may not need a lot of time and so
 
05:01:14.570 --> 05:01:14.580 align:start position:0%
we'll see if we have time to do an exact
 
05:01:16.310 --> 05:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
session if we will if we're able to take
 
05:01:18.708 --> 05:01:18.718 align:start position:0%
up some pills and deal with them
 
05:01:20.390 --> 05:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
basically we'll try to
 
05:01:24.230 --> 05:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:27.230 --> 05:01:27.240 align:start position:0%
that fist bill olpc
 
05:01:30.708 --> 05:01:30.718 align:start position:0%
that is going to take time is it okay so
 
05:01:32.690 --> 05:01:32.700 align:start position:0%
we may or may not be able to do that I
 
05:01:34.670 --> 05:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
probably want to do a work session on it
 
05:01:37.788 --> 05:01:37.798 align:start position:0%
later so okay all right so maybe that
 
05:01:39.410 --> 05:01:39.420 align:start position:0%
one might need a little bit more time so
 
05:01:41.510 --> 05:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
at a minimum you know there's like four
 
05:01:42.890 --> 05:01:42.900 align:start position:0%
bills that we haven't heard anything
 
05:01:44.930 --> 05:01:44.940 align:start position:0%
about yet which we gotta get scheduled
 
05:01:46.910 --> 05:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
and it's assortment of different topics
 
05:01:49.730 --> 05:01:49.740 align:start position:0%
so we'll get those done I'll put the
 
05:01:52.310 --> 05:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
exact session on the calendar in case we
 
05:01:53.868 --> 05:01:53.878 align:start position:0%
can do it because we gotta we have to
 
05:01:56.510 --> 05:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
notice an executive session even if we
 
05:01:58.250 --> 05:01:58.260 align:start position:0%
decide not to do it and just recess it
 
05:01:59.750 --> 05:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
but at least we have to notice it in
 
05:02:01.310 --> 05:02:01.320 align:start position:0%
case maybe there's some things that we
 
05:02:03.830 --> 05:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
we can deal with
 
05:02:03.840 --> 05:02:06.230 align:start position:0%
we can deal with
okay

05:02:06.230 --> 05:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:02:08.208 --> 05:02:08.218 align:start position:0%
okay great
 
05:02:13.190 --> 05:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:14.948 --> 05:02:14.958 align:start position:0%
wait till we get through the process
 
05:02:18.708 --> 05:02:18.718 align:start position:0%
we're totally trusting you
 
05:02:21.350 --> 05:02:21.360 align:start position:0%
so uh Republicans will be caucusing now
 
05:02:23.390 --> 05:02:23.400 align:start position:0%
we're going to go upstairs to the one of
 
05:02:24.708 --> 05:02:24.718 align:start position:0%
the 300 rooms I don't know what number
 
05:02:26.448 --> 05:02:26.458 align:start position:0%
it is but we'll figure that out and
 
05:02:28.490 --> 05:02:28.500 align:start position:0%
we'll just uh chat about the schedule
 
05:02:28.500 --> 05:02:30.920 align:start position:0%
we'll just uh chat about the schedule
okay
