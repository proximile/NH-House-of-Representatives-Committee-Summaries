that he knows
 
00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:24.470 align:start position:0%
that he knows
on

00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:24.480 align:start position:0%

00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
part of it becomes a doctor's office or
 
00:41:05.349 --> 00:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
it becomes a um
 
00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
a games of chance
 
00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:08.950 align:start position:0%

uh
 
00:41:13.589 --> 00:41:13.599 align:start position:0%
which then turns from being a poker
 
00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
place into a machine place
 
00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:19.109 align:start position:0%
place into a machine place
um

00:41:19.109 --> 00:41:19.119 align:start position:0%

specific dates when such
 
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
extension is authorized which makes it a
 
00:42:33.109 --> 00:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
lot more flexible for everybody
 
00:42:37.589 --> 00:42:37.599 align:start position:0%

00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:00.240 align:start position:0%

00:43:14.069 --> 00:43:14.079 align:start position:0%
to be towing all of the
 
00:43:14.079 --> 00:43:15.990 align:start position:0%
to be towing all of the
the

00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:18.160 align:start position:0%

00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
flexible version of of this bill
 
00:43:44.309 --> 00:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
and it balances
 
00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
the rights
 
00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:49.280 align:start position:0%

isn't quite under it
 
00:45:53.119 --> 00:45:53.990 align:start position:0%
isn't quite under it

but
 
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.430 align:start position:0%

00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
as often as the rest of you i i actually
 
00:47:19.510 --> 00:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
have a legitimate question and that is
 
00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:22.160 align:start position:0%
um we're not a home rule state and my
 
00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
question is without one of the three
 
00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
amendments that i have seen
 
00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
do the municipalities have the authority
 
00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
to pass ordinances that govern these or
 
00:47:33.829 --> 00:47:33.839 align:start position:0%
do they need us to add this in with an
 
00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:50.549 --> 00:47:50.559 align:start position:0%
yes the authority already exists
 
00:47:53.109 --> 00:47:53.119 align:start position:0%
and this was uh just in case
 
00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:54.800 align:start position:0%
let's put it in
 
00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
kind of a thing
 
00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:57.510 align:start position:0%
kind of a thing
uh

00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:47:58.630 --> 00:47:58.640 align:start position:0%
that's why
 
00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
it already exists we know we know that
 
00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:03.030 align:start position:0%
it already exists we know we know that
municipalities

00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
00:48:06.549 --> 00:48:06.559 align:start position:0%
uh have limited locations in the town or
 
00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
wherever you know in the example of
 
00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:09.750 align:start position:0%
wherever you know in the example of
salem

00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
salem
 
00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
where charitable gaming locations can be
 
00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
to have the ability we heard testimony
 
00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:16.309 align:start position:0%
to have the ability we heard testimony
from

00:48:16.309 --> 00:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
the lottery
 
00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
director executive director
 
00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
that yes there's no restriction for a
 
00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
town to not place an ordinance to limit
 
00:48:27.109 --> 00:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
whatever they want to limit
 
00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:28.640 align:start position:0%
related to these
 
00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:29.910 align:start position:0%
related to these
so

00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
you know the question we debated this
 
00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
last week whether or not we need an
 
00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
amendment or not
 
00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:36.640 align:start position:0%
um we thought it wouldn't hurt
 
00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:37.829 align:start position:0%
um we thought it wouldn't hurt
but

00:48:37.829 --> 00:48:37.839 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:48:39.589 --> 00:48:39.599 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
we'll see how what the outcome of the
 
00:48:42.630 --> 00:48:42.640 align:start position:0%

00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
that we would
 
00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:32.710 align:start position:0%
that we would
need

00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:32.720 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:34.150 align:start position:0%
need
permission

00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
permission
 
00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
to be able
 
00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:37.190 align:start position:0%
to be able
to

00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:37.990 align:start position:0%
to
do

00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:49:39.589 --> 00:49:39.599 align:start position:0%
to change
 
00:49:43.589 --> 00:49:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
on this entity or any entity that was
 
00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
already there to to change their ability
 
00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:51.750 align:start position:0%
already there to to change their ability
to

00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
and i don't know we need need
 
00:50:03.589 --> 00:50:03.599 align:start position:0%
people who know more about municipal
 
00:50:07.109 --> 00:50:07.119 align:start position:0%
uh law to talk to us about this
 
00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:08.640 align:start position:0%
representative waltz
 
00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
thank you so traditionally
 
00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:12.640 align:start position:0%
under the law
 
00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities can regulate time place
 
00:50:17.670 --> 00:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
manner hours noise those kinds of things
 
00:50:19.829 --> 00:50:19.839 align:start position:0%
by passing this bill we are taking away
 
00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
from the municipality the authority to
 
00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:24.160 align:start position:0%
regulate the time it appears
 
00:50:27.349 --> 00:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
unless this is a local option
 
00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
and i don't see it as saying that i see
 
00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
that we are commanding that everybody
 
00:50:32.309 --> 00:50:32.319 align:start position:0%
gets to do this until four in the
 
00:50:36.069 --> 00:50:36.079 align:start position:0%
morning and i would suggest that perhaps
 
00:50:39.109 --> 00:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
it may make sense to um do this but do
 
00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
it with a local option so that if a
 
00:50:43.829 --> 00:50:43.839 align:start position:0%
community if the if a gaming facility is
 
00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
in a residential area and it's becoming
 
00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
problematic after 1am then a
 
00:50:49.990 --> 00:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
municipality has the authority to to
 
00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
deal with those kinds of things so i
 
00:50:53.829 --> 00:50:53.839 align:start position:0%
understand the advantage of leaving them
 
00:50:55.589 --> 00:50:55.599 align:start position:0%
open but i'm concerned by the fact that
 
00:50:57.829 --> 00:50:57.839 align:start position:0%
we are taking away from the municipality
 
00:51:00.069 --> 00:51:00.079 align:start position:0%
the ability to regulate those kinds of
 
00:51:00.079 --> 00:51:03.430 align:start position:0%
the ability to regulate those kinds of
things

00:51:03.430 --> 00:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:04.870 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:51:04.870 --> 00:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:51:06.309 --> 00:51:06.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chad i'm just going to
 
00:51:07.829 --> 00:51:07.839 align:start position:0%
repeat some of what we've already said
 
00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
in public testimony but as i've said
 
00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
before i'm a zoning board chair i've
 
00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
been on been on the zoning for a decade
 
00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:15.270 align:start position:0%
been on been on the zoning for a decade
now

00:51:15.270 --> 00:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:51:17.829 --> 00:51:17.839 align:start position:0%
site plan reviews are done with
 
00:51:19.589 --> 00:51:19.599 align:start position:0%
businesses that come into town we just
 
00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
had one for an auto
 
00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
auto dealership auto repair place was
 
00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
coming in during that site plan review
 
00:51:27.829 --> 00:51:27.839 align:start position:0%
the things you were talking about
 
00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
the hours the the parking the health and
 
00:51:32.069 --> 00:51:32.079 align:start position:0%
safety issues are all addressed in the
 
00:51:34.230 --> 00:51:34.240 align:start position:0%
site plan review
 
00:51:36.069 --> 00:51:36.079 align:start position:0%
so when a business submits a site plan
 
00:51:37.829 --> 00:51:37.839 align:start position:0%
review to a planning board it says our
 
00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
hour operations are going to be from 10
 
00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
am to 6 pm
 
00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
that's part of the site plan that's
 
00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
approved if they want to change those
 
00:51:48.309 --> 00:51:48.319 align:start position:0%
hours there's an obligation that they
 
00:51:49.829 --> 00:51:49.839 align:start position:0%
come back in front of the planning board
 
00:51:51.430 --> 00:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
and say we're changing our hours of
 
00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
operation because the site plan was only
 
00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
allowed from 10 to six
 
00:51:57.589 --> 00:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
so again i i think between the health
 
00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
and safety code the parking code the
 
00:52:02.069 --> 00:52:02.079 align:start position:0%
noise enforcement code all of these
 
00:52:04.790 --> 00:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
options are available to towns and i'm
 
00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:06.800 align:start position:0%
not sure that adding another rule that
 
00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
towns aren't using anyway it sounds like
 
00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:11.680 align:start position:0%
as helps anybody um and and and make
 
00:52:13.829 --> 00:52:13.839 align:start position:0%
another exemption especially in this
 
00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
situation where we're doing a specific
 
00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
carve out for a specific industry which
 
00:52:21.349 --> 00:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
i think is wrong um and so what i'm
 
00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
saying is i from my hat as a zoning
 
00:52:25.270 --> 00:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
board chair the rules already exist for
 
00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities to be able to do what
 
00:52:27.829 --> 00:52:27.839 align:start position:0%
they want to do they can set parking
 
00:52:29.190 --> 00:52:29.200 align:start position:0%
requirements they can set health and
 
00:52:31.589 --> 00:52:31.599 align:start position:0%
safety requirements they can set
 
00:52:33.109 --> 00:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
all kinds of hours of operation
 
00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
requirements i did it for uh for a
 
00:52:38.150 --> 00:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
gravel pit that wanted to go in our
 
00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
community and we set the hours of
 
00:52:40.950 --> 00:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
operation somebody complained because
 
00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
they were outside the hours of operation
 
00:52:44.230 --> 00:52:44.240 align:start position:0%
on a saturday morning we sent the zoning
 
00:52:45.990 --> 00:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
guy out he looked at he said sure enough
 
00:52:48.390 --> 00:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
it is and we sent him a cease and desist
 
00:52:51.349 --> 00:52:51.359 align:start position:0%
and so towns have the ability to set
 
00:52:53.589 --> 00:52:53.599 align:start position:0%
time place manner parking health and
 
00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
safety codes lighting codes there's all
 
00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
kinds of things that we can do for
 
00:52:59.589 --> 00:52:59.599 align:start position:0%
businesses so i i think adding another
 
00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
rule that
 
00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
that when they're not taking advantage
 
00:53:03.510 --> 00:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
of the rules that already exist doesn't
 
00:53:04.870 --> 00:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
make any sense
 
00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
i would agree representative lang and i
 
00:53:07.829 --> 00:53:07.839 align:start position:0%
certainly understand those kinds of
 
00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
things but i would suggest that the
 
00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
wording of this amendment removes that
 
00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
discretion from municipalities and i
 
00:53:15.270 --> 00:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
find that concerning
 
00:53:17.829 --> 00:53:17.839 align:start position:0%
any further discussion on three one
 
00:53:17.839 --> 00:53:20.230 align:start position:0%
any further discussion on three one
eight

00:53:20.230 --> 00:53:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:21.670 align:start position:0%
 
representation

00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
representation
 
00:53:24.069 --> 00:53:24.079 align:start position:0%
thank you you are talking about
 
00:53:27.589 --> 00:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
businesses that have their own buildings
 
00:53:30.309 --> 00:53:30.319 align:start position:0%
i am talking about multi-use large
 
00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
buildings which industrial old
 
00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
industrial towns have got a lot of
 
00:53:38.309 --> 00:53:38.319 align:start position:0%
and uh they are multi-use
 
00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
uh we didn't have anything like a poker
 
00:53:44.950 --> 00:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
parlor in that building before it came
 
00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:45.670 align:start position:0%
parlor in that building before it came
in

00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
without a problem with
 
00:53:50.950 --> 00:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
with a safety inspection
 
00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:53.200 align:start position:0%
and that's all we
 
00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:55.030 align:start position:0%
and that's all we
do

00:53:55.030 --> 00:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:53:57.109 --> 00:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
because it's a multi-use building the
 
00:53:59.589 --> 00:53:59.599 align:start position:0%
main occupant at this point is village
 
00:53:59.599 --> 00:54:00.710 align:start position:0%
main occupant at this point is village
pizza

00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
pizza
 
00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:01.670 align:start position:0%
pizza
on

00:54:01.670 --> 00:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:04.480 align:start position:0%
there is a large basement which i think
 
00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
they're going to ask to expand into that
 
00:54:11.349 --> 00:54:11.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't get tenants very often
 
00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
but it was a very small floral shop
 
00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
that folded and the poker place moved in
 
00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:22.240 align:start position:0%
and there was a safety inspection
 
00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
and at that point we do not have the
 
00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
right to talk about
 
00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:28.150 align:start position:0%
right to talk about
ours

00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
ours
 
00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:30.400 align:start position:0%
and such
 
00:54:34.309 --> 00:54:34.319 align:start position:0%
any further discussion on 318
 
00:54:36.740 --> 00:54:36.750 align:start position:0%
representative ames
 
00:54:36.750 --> 00:54:39.270 align:start position:0%
representative ames
[Music]

00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:54:41.109 --> 00:54:41.119 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm not going to talk
 
00:54:43.270 --> 00:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
any length on this but uh
 
00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
i i i
 
00:54:48.150 --> 00:54:48.160 align:start position:0%
agree with what representative walsh has
 
00:54:51.109 --> 00:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
said i think this bill and in making a
 
00:54:53.349 --> 00:54:53.359 align:start position:0%
specific reference to a period of
 
00:54:53.359 --> 00:54:54.630 align:start position:0%
specific reference to a period of
operation

00:54:54.630 --> 00:54:54.640 align:start position:0%
operation
 
00:54:57.270 --> 00:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
that's allowed has uh
 
00:54:59.510 --> 00:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
the potential because i don't know i'm
 
00:55:02.309 --> 00:55:02.319 align:start position:0%
no expert in municipal law the potential
 
00:55:04.309 --> 00:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
of being interpreted
 
00:55:07.589 --> 00:55:07.599 align:start position:0%
uh when challenged by some disgruntled
 
00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
butter and that's going to happen
 
00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:11.430 align:start position:0%
butter and that's going to happen
um

00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:11.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:15.109 --> 00:55:15.119 align:start position:0%
as a uh an action by the state that has
 
00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
taken away
 
00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
the discretion of the municipality
 
00:55:20.549 --> 00:55:20.559 align:start position:0%
essentially what
 
00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
representative walsh was saying i
 
00:55:25.510 --> 00:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
as if this bill goes forward without
 
00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:28.630 align:start position:0%
as if this bill goes forward without
amendment

00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:32.230 --> 00:55:32.240 align:start position:0%
i ask that the report at least
 
00:55:35.829 --> 00:55:35.839 align:start position:0%
state the committees understanding
 
00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
or position
 
00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:38.910 align:start position:0%
or position
that

00:55:38.910 --> 00:55:38.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:55:42.549 --> 00:55:42.559 align:start position:0%
municipalities would retain discretion
 
00:55:42.559 --> 00:55:43.510 align:start position:0%
municipalities would retain discretion
to

00:55:43.510 --> 00:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:55:48.309 --> 00:55:48.319 align:start position:0%
set different hours of operation
 
00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:53.430 --> 00:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
00:55:55.990 --> 00:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
mr chairman there's just one more thing
 
00:55:57.910 --> 00:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
i wanted to add which is i understand
 
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
there are eight more locations now
 
00:56:04.710 --> 00:56:04.720 align:start position:0%
which will not be able to apply
 
00:56:07.829 --> 00:56:07.839 align:start position:0%
to expand their operations
 
00:56:11.430 --> 00:56:11.440 align:start position:0%
for another uh three years i think it is
 
00:56:13.510 --> 00:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
now but then they will be i don't know
 
00:56:16.870 --> 00:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
where these locations are but
 
00:56:19.750 --> 00:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
some of them may also be in old mill
 
00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:21.430 align:start position:0%
some of them may also be in old mill
towns

00:56:21.430 --> 00:56:21.440 align:start position:0%
towns
 
00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
and would have the same
 
00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:26.480 align:start position:0%
problem because people are trying to put
 
00:56:29.190 --> 00:56:29.200 align:start position:0%
new businesses into
 
00:56:31.750 --> 00:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
old buildings that
 
00:56:39.030 --> 00:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:41.670 --> 00:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
perhaps and waltz
 
00:56:43.589 --> 00:56:43.599 align:start position:0%
thank you i was just looking uh there's
 
00:56:45.750 --> 00:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
an amendment that's in the room i'm not
 
00:56:47.109 --> 00:56:47.119 align:start position:0%
really sure whose amendment this is
 
00:56:49.190 --> 00:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
anymore though it says abrami on the top
 
00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
15 13 and 1513 clarifies that
 
00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities continue to have the
 
00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:56.549 align:start position:0%
municipalities continue to have the
hours

00:56:56.549 --> 00:56:56.559 align:start position:0%
hours
 
00:56:56.559 --> 00:56:57.510 align:start position:0%
hours
um

00:56:57.510 --> 00:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:59.430 --> 00:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
the authority to do the hours it's the
 
00:57:01.589 --> 00:57:01.599 align:start position:0%
only thing the amendment does
 
00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:02.720 align:start position:0%
given that
 
00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:03.510 align:start position:0%
given that
i

00:57:03.510 --> 00:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
at least two lawyers in the room are
 
00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
concerned that
 
00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:07.190 align:start position:0%
concerned that
the

00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:57:09.589 --> 00:57:09.599 align:start position:0%
bill as drafted removes the authority
 
00:57:12.549 --> 00:57:12.559 align:start position:0%
from the municipality i see no harm in
 
00:57:15.349 --> 00:57:15.359 align:start position:0%
passing 1513 that clarifies that the
 
00:57:17.430 --> 00:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
municipality retains the authority to
 
00:57:18.870 --> 00:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
regulate ours
 
00:57:21.270 --> 00:57:21.280 align:start position:0%
i just don't want the this to go through
 
00:57:23.910 --> 00:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
and and as representative ames said
 
00:57:25.589 --> 00:57:25.599 align:start position:0%
later on three or four years from now in
 
00:57:27.109 --> 00:57:27.119 align:start position:0%
the courts you have somebody disgruntled
 
00:57:28.470 --> 00:57:28.480 align:start position:0%
bring it to the courts and have a fight
 
00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:30.160 align:start position:0%
over it there should be no question
 
00:57:31.829 --> 00:57:31.839 align:start position:0%
municipalities still have the authority
 
00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
to regulate the hours so i would suggest
 
00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
that somebody in this room
 
00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
i would if i could have the authority
 
00:57:39.430 --> 00:57:39.440 align:start position:0%
but i don't think i do introduce
 
00:57:44.309 --> 00:57:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:46.710 --> 00:57:46.720 align:start position:0%
at this point in time we're in a work
 
00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:47.829 align:start position:0%
at this point in time we're in a work
session

00:57:47.829 --> 00:57:47.839 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:57:51.589 --> 00:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:52.829 --> 00:57:52.839 align:start position:0%
any further
 
00:57:55.829 --> 00:57:55.839 align:start position:0%
discussion on the amendment that
 
00:57:58.230 --> 00:57:58.240 align:start position:0%
representative almy had brought up which
 
00:58:02.470 --> 00:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:06.789 --> 00:58:06.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:08.789 --> 00:58:08.799 align:start position:0%
representative tucker
 
00:58:11.109 --> 00:58:11.119 align:start position:0%
uh could i ask you uh representative
 
00:58:11.119 --> 00:58:11.990 align:start position:0%
uh could i ask you uh representative
elmi

00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
elmi
 
00:58:15.990 --> 00:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:18.950 align:start position:0%
 
amendment

00:58:18.950 --> 00:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:23.030 --> 00:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
15 13 would be adequate
 
00:58:23.990 --> 00:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
since it
 
00:58:26.309 --> 00:58:26.319 align:start position:0%
apparently removes a concern of some
 
00:58:27.829 --> 00:58:27.839 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
00:58:33.990 --> 00:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
it's 15 13 15 13. um i would i would be
 
00:58:37.030 --> 00:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
okay with that one great that's good to
 
00:58:41.510 --> 00:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
00:58:45.670 --> 00:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
any further discussion saying none then
 
00:58:47.270 --> 00:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
i'm going to
 
00:58:50.309 --> 00:58:50.319 align:start position:0%
open the executive session and
 
00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:52.640 align:start position:0%
representative gisette
 
00:58:54.789 --> 00:58:54.799 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i move out to pass
 
00:58:59.030 --> 00:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:09.510 --> 00:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:11.190 --> 00:59:11.200 align:start position:0%
representative deciding on speaking
 
00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:14.309 align:start position:0%
representative deciding on speaking
emotion

00:59:14.309 --> 00:59:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:16.630 --> 00:59:16.640 align:start position:0%
certainly we i won't belabor this but
 
00:59:18.630 --> 00:59:18.640 align:start position:0%
we've heard much
 
00:59:21.109 --> 00:59:21.119 align:start position:0%
discussion and testimony in relation to
 
00:59:24.870 --> 00:59:24.880 align:start position:0%
why it's advantageous to not only the
 
00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
charities the state and the operators to
 
00:59:30.309 --> 00:59:30.319 align:start position:0%
extend these hours in the workforce here
 
00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire so um
 
00:59:34.950 --> 00:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
this has come to us from the senate as
 
00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:36.069 align:start position:0%
this has come to us from the senate as
written

00:59:36.069 --> 00:59:36.079 align:start position:0%
written
 
00:59:37.430 --> 00:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
and i believe it's a good piece of
 
00:59:40.470 --> 00:59:40.480 align:start position:0%
legislation for all involved
 
00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you any further this discussion
 
00:59:44.789 --> 00:59:44.799 align:start position:0%
representative should move on
 
00:59:44.799 --> 00:59:49.270 align:start position:0%
representative should move on
yeah

00:59:49.270 --> 00:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:52.710 --> 00:59:52.720 align:start position:0%
i will move amendment on 1513
 
00:59:56.630 --> 00:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
since people seem to prefer that one
 
01:00:00.549 --> 01:00:00.559 align:start position:0%
so you're moving amendment 15 13
 
01:00:00.559 --> 01:00:01.510 align:start position:0%
so you're moving amendment 15 13
yes

01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:00:05.910 --> 01:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
which provides the flexibility needed by
 
01:00:07.589 --> 01:00:07.599 align:start position:0%
towns and
 
01:00:11.589 --> 01:00:11.599 align:start position:0%
small cities especially on that will be
 
01:00:11.599 --> 01:00:13.670 align:start position:0%
small cities especially on that will be
on

01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:14.630 align:start position:0%
on
be

01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:00:16.630 --> 01:00:16.640 align:start position:0%
having to deal
 
01:00:20.309 --> 01:00:20.319 align:start position:0%
with the uh secondary effects of the
 
01:00:23.589 --> 01:00:23.599 align:start position:0%
business being open far into the morning
 
01:00:23.599 --> 01:00:25.270 align:start position:0%
business being open far into the morning
hours

01:00:25.270 --> 01:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
hours
 
01:00:28.390 --> 01:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
especially in winter but also
 
01:00:30.630 --> 01:00:30.640 align:start position:0%
on due to the
 
01:00:33.430 --> 01:00:33.440 align:start position:0%
parking problems that are involved in
 
01:00:35.430 --> 01:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
some of them
 
01:00:42.549 --> 01:00:42.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:46.950 --> 01:00:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:49.270 --> 01:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
may i speak to my second
 
01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:51.190 align:start position:0%
may i speak to my second
yes

01:00:51.190 --> 01:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
this amendment does only what
 
01:00:55.829 --> 01:00:55.839 align:start position:0%
representative lang says already happens
 
01:00:57.750 --> 01:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
it just puts it in writing to make it
 
01:00:59.750 --> 01:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
clear it doesn't change the bill it
 
01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't change the intent of the bill it
 
01:01:03.990 --> 01:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
just clarifies the language to do what
 
01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
representative lang says
 
01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
everybody wants it to do
 
01:01:10.150 --> 01:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
so i i don't see that it should be
 
01:01:12.150 --> 01:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
controversial because all it does is
 
01:01:13.829 --> 01:01:13.839 align:start position:0%
recognize the authority of the town to
 
01:01:18.390 --> 01:01:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:20.390 --> 01:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
is not known as uh this is a point of
 
01:01:23.349 --> 01:01:23.359 align:start position:0%
order mr chairman we were talking to
 
01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
representative alame's amendment and
 
01:01:27.589 --> 01:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
that's what we were going to move in on
 
01:01:29.109 --> 01:01:29.119 align:start position:0%
and now we're talking about another
 
01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
amendment i would like some
 
01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
clarification from the chairs to what
 
01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:33.599 align:start position:0%
we're doing
 
01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
we were in work session
 
01:01:38.309 --> 01:01:38.319 align:start position:0%
discuss all three amendments the first
 
01:01:40.870 --> 01:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
two amendments were waved out
 
01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:42.640 align:start position:0%
we discussed representative allen's
 
01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:43.829 align:start position:0%
we discussed representative allen's
amendment

01:01:43.829 --> 01:01:43.839 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
and then represented walls in the
 
01:01:47.910 --> 01:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
discussion of that brought up uh
 
01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:49.349 align:start position:0%
discussion of that brought up uh
amendment

01:01:49.349 --> 01:01:49.359 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:01:49.359 --> 01:01:55.829 align:start position:0%
amendment
15

01:01:55.829 --> 01:01:55.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:55.839 --> 01:01:58.390 align:start position:0%
 
1513h

01:01:58.390 --> 01:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
1513h
 
01:02:01.349 --> 01:02:01.359 align:start position:0%
which says it's a representative romney
 
01:02:02.950 --> 01:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
but it's really a representative ames
 
01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:17.829 align:start position:0%
but it's really a representative ames
amendment

01:02:17.829 --> 01:02:17.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
yeah i just like to clarify that the one
 
01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
thing that this does make a difference
 
01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:24.789 align:start position:0%
thing that this does make a difference
for

01:02:24.789 --> 01:02:24.799 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:02:28.789 --> 01:02:28.799 align:start position:0%
is for the situations in
 
01:02:31.990 --> 01:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
in places where you move
 
01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:32.829 align:start position:0%
in places where you move
a

01:02:32.829 --> 01:02:32.839 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:36.640 align:start position:0%
um a new business into
 
01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
a multi-use building
 
01:02:42.069 --> 01:02:42.079 align:start position:0%
which is mostly going to be occurring in
 
01:02:44.069 --> 01:02:44.079 align:start position:0%
old mill towns some of them are pretty
 
01:02:46.390 --> 01:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
small some of them are are
 
01:02:49.190 --> 01:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
fairly large um and
 
01:02:51.109 --> 01:02:51.119 align:start position:0%
manchester probably doesn't have a
 
01:02:52.789 --> 01:02:52.799 align:start position:0%
problem because they have a very clear
 
01:02:52.799 --> 01:02:54.230 align:start position:0%
problem because they have a very clear
downtown

01:02:54.230 --> 01:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
downtown
 
01:02:55.589 --> 01:02:55.599 align:start position:0%
uh which
 
01:02:55.599 --> 01:02:56.870 align:start position:0%
uh which
uh

01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:02:58.789 --> 01:02:58.799 align:start position:0%
they already have to deal with
 
01:02:58.799 --> 01:03:00.309 align:start position:0%
they already have to deal with
uh

01:03:00.309 --> 01:03:00.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:03:04.470 --> 01:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
but for those of us that are in between
 
01:03:07.589 --> 01:03:07.599 align:start position:0%
where the downtown is actually also a
 
01:03:10.150 --> 01:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
residential district and also
 
01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:11.109 align:start position:0%
residential district and also
uh

01:03:11.109 --> 01:03:11.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:03:14.470 --> 01:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
all of the parking is concentrated in
 
01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
that downtown area
 
01:03:19.589 --> 01:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
and we have to do snowplowing and winter
 
01:03:21.910 --> 01:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
i didn't even think about this till my
 
01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
my city manager talked to me about it
 
01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
on we need some flexibility in order to
 
01:03:31.510 --> 01:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
be able to figure out
 
01:03:34.150 --> 01:03:34.160 align:start position:0%
with that business in a public hearing
 
01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:35.270 align:start position:0%
with that business in a public hearing
how

01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
how
 
01:03:37.829 --> 01:03:37.839 align:start position:0%
this is going to work because
 
01:03:37.839 --> 01:03:38.789 align:start position:0%
this is going to work because
we

01:03:38.789 --> 01:03:38.799 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:03:38.799 --> 01:03:39.750 align:start position:0%
we
don't

01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:40.549 align:start position:0%
don't
do

01:03:40.549 --> 01:03:40.559 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:03:45.829 --> 01:03:45.839 align:start position:0%
site evaluations of pieces of buildings
 
01:03:48.069 --> 01:03:48.079 align:start position:0%
we only do them
 
01:03:49.750 --> 01:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
for the whole building when the whole
 
01:03:51.589 --> 01:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
building was created and that whole
 
01:03:54.549 --> 01:03:54.559 align:start position:0%
building was created as a multi-use
 
01:03:54.559 --> 01:03:57.190 align:start position:0%
building was created as a multi-use
retail

01:03:57.190 --> 01:03:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:59.990 --> 01:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
any further discussion on amendment 15
 
01:04:03.109 --> 01:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
13 h
 
01:04:05.349 --> 01:04:05.359 align:start position:0%
president lyon thank you again i'm going
 
01:04:06.789 --> 01:04:06.799 align:start position:0%
to vote against this amendment we're
 
01:04:09.589 --> 01:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
creating a unique carve out for a unique
 
01:04:11.829 --> 01:04:11.839 align:start position:0%
business business structure which i
 
01:04:13.829 --> 01:04:13.839 align:start position:0%
think is inappropriate we know we heard
 
01:04:16.390 --> 01:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
in testimony that the town of hampton
 
01:04:18.069 --> 01:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
beach i think it was already has some
 
01:04:20.710 --> 01:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
like one o'clock curfew laws and so that
 
01:04:22.549 --> 01:04:22.559 align:start position:0%
that limits some of these organizations
 
01:04:25.349 --> 01:04:25.359 align:start position:0%
to do certain things so but it's a broad
 
01:04:27.670 --> 01:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
it's a broad uh ordinance it's not
 
01:04:29.510 --> 01:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
target it's not a targeted ordinance
 
01:04:31.510 --> 01:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
saying on this particular industry we're
 
01:04:33.190 --> 01:04:33.200 align:start position:0%
going to make special rules so i think
 
01:04:35.109 --> 01:04:35.119 align:start position:0%
that that's a bad policy to get into
 
01:04:36.789 --> 01:04:36.799 align:start position:0%
where we start making special rules for
 
01:04:39.270 --> 01:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
special industries like this that are
 
01:04:41.349 --> 01:04:41.359 align:start position:0%
that could be subject so i'm going to be
 
01:04:43.109 --> 01:04:43.119 align:start position:0%
voting against this the towns already
 
01:04:45.109 --> 01:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
have the authority it's wasted words of
 
01:04:48.309 --> 01:04:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:50.390 --> 01:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
represented waltz
 
01:04:51.829 --> 01:04:51.839 align:start position:0%
thank you well if that's the case we
 
01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be passing this underlying law
 
01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
because that is for a specific industry
 
01:04:57.510 --> 01:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
and it's setting times for a specific
 
01:04:59.270 --> 01:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
industry so if we don't want to set
 
01:05:01.910 --> 01:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
times for a specific industry let's just
 
01:05:03.990 --> 01:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
itl the law but if you're going to pass
 
01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
the law and set these times for a
 
01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
specific industry then i think you need
 
01:05:09.430 --> 01:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
to give the local option
 
01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:10.390 align:start position:0%
to give the local option
so

01:05:10.390 --> 01:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:05:11.829 --> 01:05:11.839 align:start position:0%
you know you can't have it both ways is
 
01:05:13.430 --> 01:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
what i'm trying to say if we set the
 
01:05:14.789 --> 01:05:14.799 align:start position:0%
times for the industry we have to give
 
01:05:16.309 --> 01:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
them a local option or we just don't
 
01:05:18.069 --> 01:05:18.079 align:start position:0%
pass the bill but it
 
01:05:19.589 --> 01:05:19.599 align:start position:0%
the argument doesn't cut both ways
 
01:05:22.230 --> 01:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
representative lange
 
01:05:24.710 --> 01:05:24.720 align:start position:0%

does anybody have any additional
 
01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:06.950 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any additional
information

01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:10:08.709 --> 01:10:08.719 align:start position:0%
that they want to present to the
 
01:10:08.719 --> 01:10:11.510 align:start position:0%
that they want to present to the
committee

01:10:11.510 --> 01:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:13.669 --> 01:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
saying none then i'm going to go into
 
01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:30.790 --> 01:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
representative lange i move itl on
 
01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:38.070 --> 01:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
representative lang moves out itl
 
01:10:39.669 --> 01:10:39.679 align:start position:0%
and do we have a second representative
 
01:10:39.679 --> 01:10:45.669 align:start position:0%
and do we have a second representative
nunes

01:10:45.669 --> 01:10:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:48.390 --> 01:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
mr chair real quick just a comment the i
 
01:10:49.830 --> 01:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
think you hit the nail on the head when
 
01:10:51.030 --> 01:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
we had our public hearing in our
 
01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
discussion on this last time um this
 
01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
opens the doors for things like how do
 
01:10:58.149 --> 01:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
we apportion business profits tax how do
 
01:11:01.110 --> 01:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
we apportion gas tax how do we apportion
 
01:11:03.750 --> 01:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
all the limited state taxes that we have
 
01:11:06.310 --> 01:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
um and and i think that's again these
 
01:11:08.550 --> 01:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
are state taxes for state purposes for
 
01:11:10.070 --> 01:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
all the hampshire citizens so i think
 
01:11:11.510 --> 01:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
the equitable distribution that's done
 
01:11:13.270 --> 01:11:13.280 align:start position:0%
now based on population is appropriate
 
01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:17.910 --> 01:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion
 
01:11:19.350 --> 01:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
representative romney followed by
 
01:11:20.709 --> 01:11:20.719 align:start position:0%
representative hatch
 
01:11:22.390 --> 01:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
i think we heard in uh
 
01:11:25.669 --> 01:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
in testimony from the dra that
 
01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
in in this
 
01:11:28.790 --> 01:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
it's the perception over the years has
 
01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
been that we haven't even looked at
 
01:11:32.630 --> 01:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
something like this because rims wasn't
 
01:11:34.709 --> 01:11:34.719 align:start position:0%
in place the more advanced computer
 
01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
system that's now there
 
01:11:37.910 --> 01:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
but it turns out that's not really the
 
01:11:40.070 --> 01:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
case this could have been done a long
 
01:11:41.350 --> 01:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
time ago
 
01:11:43.270 --> 01:11:43.280 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:44.149 align:start position:0%
and uh
but

01:11:44.149 --> 01:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:11:45.830 --> 01:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
this kind of a bill but this is the
 
01:11:48.149 --> 01:11:48.159 align:start position:0%
study but the underlying thing is a bill
 
01:11:50.149 --> 01:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
where municipalities have
 
01:11:51.910 --> 01:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
the opportunity well the first they want
 
01:11:55.350 --> 01:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
a greater proportion of the uh taxes for
 
01:11:57.030 --> 01:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
for one thing
 
01:11:59.110 --> 01:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
mainly rooms tax
 
01:12:00.630 --> 01:12:00.640 align:start position:0%
and then the the other thing was that
 
01:12:02.630 --> 01:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
the study was a two dollar municipal
 
01:12:05.189 --> 01:12:05.199 align:start position:0%
occupancy tax which is a slippery slope
 
01:12:06.470 --> 01:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
by the way
 
01:12:08.790 --> 01:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
that we've that we've killed in the past
 
01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
not giving the municipalities the
 
01:12:13.110 --> 01:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
ability to tax that way we don't allow
 
01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
our municipalities to tax
 
01:12:16.470 --> 01:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
this way
 
01:12:18.149 --> 01:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
and uh i don't think there's really
 
01:12:19.750 --> 01:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
anything much to study here if someone
 
01:12:21.750 --> 01:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
wants to move something like this they
 
01:12:23.270 --> 01:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
should move a bill
 
01:12:25.750 --> 01:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
that does one of one or the other
 
01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh i don't think we need to study it
 
01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:28.709 align:start position:0%
uh i don't think we need to study it
anymore

01:12:28.709 --> 01:12:28.719 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
01:12:28.719 --> 01:12:29.669 align:start position:0%
anymore
we've

01:12:29.669 --> 01:12:29.679 align:start position:0%
we've
 
01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
we've beaten this to death over the
 
01:12:33.110 --> 01:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
years thank you
 
01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
representative hatch
 
01:12:37.830 --> 01:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i just
 
01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
really disagree with it yelling this uh
 
01:12:44.470 --> 01:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
in 2008 i believe it was
 
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
when the economy
 
01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:47.350 align:start position:0%
when the economy
crashed

01:12:47.350 --> 01:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
crashed
 
01:12:49.270 --> 01:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
we changed how this
 
01:12:51.110 --> 01:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
tax was utilized and how it was
 
01:12:53.590 --> 01:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
apportioned to communities
 
01:12:55.590 --> 01:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
and we took back
 
01:12:58.390 --> 01:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
much of what used to go to communities
 
01:12:58.400 --> 01:12:59.669 align:start position:0%
much of what used to go to communities
and

01:12:59.669 --> 01:12:59.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:13:01.830 --> 01:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
having been here for
 
01:13:04.070 --> 01:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
a number of years when these discussions
 
01:13:06.950 --> 01:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
did and didn't take place
 
01:13:09.189 --> 01:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
it's something that is still
 
01:13:09.199 --> 01:13:11.189 align:start position:0%
it's something that is still
unresolved

01:13:11.189 --> 01:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
unresolved
 
01:13:13.910 --> 01:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
for many of our constituents and many of
 
01:13:15.750 --> 01:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
our communities
 
01:13:18.790 --> 01:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
i suspect most of us have has heard at
 
01:13:20.390 --> 01:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
one time or the other
 
01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:21.350 align:start position:0%
one time or the other
how

01:13:21.350 --> 01:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
how
 
01:13:24.870 --> 01:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
maybe their community is not
 
01:13:27.510 --> 01:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
receiving an appropriate a
 
01:13:29.350 --> 01:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate amount
 
01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
from this tax compared to what they
 
01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
contribute to it and a myriad of other
 
01:13:37.669 --> 01:13:37.679 align:start position:0%
things and and i'm not here to say which
 
01:13:40.550 --> 01:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
is right or wrong but i am here to say
 
01:13:43.350 --> 01:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
that when we changed how this was
 
01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:44.550 align:start position:0%
that when we changed how this was
apportioned

01:13:44.550 --> 01:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
apportioned
 
01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
when we took back from many of the
 
01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:47.590 align:start position:0%
when we took back from many of the
communities

01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:48.630 align:start position:0%
communities
um

01:13:48.630 --> 01:13:48.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:51.590 --> 01:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
monies they re used to get
 
01:13:53.910 --> 01:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
i think as a body
 
01:13:56.149 --> 01:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
we have an obligation
 
01:13:57.110 --> 01:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:14:00.630 --> 01:14:00.640 align:start position:0%
what was stated by those before us
 
01:14:03.030 --> 01:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
that when things change
 
01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
this will be looked at and it can be
 
01:14:08.630 --> 01:14:08.640 align:start position:0%
addressed as
 
01:14:10.870 --> 01:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
far as the inequities
 
01:14:13.350 --> 01:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
of how this is distributed because there
 
01:14:16.070 --> 01:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
are inequities there are bases how this
 
01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
is distributed that really don't have a
 
01:14:21.189 --> 01:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
lot to do with how it's gathered so um
 
01:14:23.669 --> 01:14:23.679 align:start position:0%
just with that i i really can't
 
01:14:25.430 --> 01:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
support an itl and i'm really
 
01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:27.110 align:start position:0%
support an itl and i'm really
disappointed

01:14:27.110 --> 01:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
disappointed
 
01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:28.640 align:start position:0%
that we won't at least take the
 
01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:30.630 align:start position:0%
that we won't at least take the
opportunity

01:14:30.630 --> 01:14:30.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
to look at this and look at it in depth
 
01:14:37.110 --> 01:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
and and give it to serious consideration
 
01:14:40.709 --> 01:14:40.719 align:start position:0%
um that it deserves thank you mr chair
 
01:14:46.790 --> 01:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:49.669 --> 01:14:49.679 align:start position:0%
send none then i'm going to
 
01:14:52.630 --> 01:14:52.640 align:start position:0%
oh representative elmi
 
01:14:55.030 --> 01:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
thank you i
 
01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:03.510 --> 01:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
the need not to distribute this back
 
01:15:06.310 --> 01:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
just to the places that uh
 
01:15:07.669 --> 01:15:07.679 align:start position:0%
raised it
 
01:15:13.189 --> 01:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
but we do have a problem which has been
 
01:15:15.750 --> 01:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
hidden within the problem with the
 
01:15:18.149 --> 01:15:18.159 align:start position:0%
education property tax
 
01:15:18.159 --> 01:15:19.189 align:start position:0%
education property tax
on

01:15:19.189 --> 01:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:15:19.199 --> 01:15:20.229 align:start position:0%
on
and

01:15:20.229 --> 01:15:20.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:15:22.870 --> 01:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
and the education funding
 
01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:24.630 align:start position:0%

the two dollar municipal occupancy fee
 
01:15:55.990 --> 01:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
not a tax it would have been related
 
01:15:59.590 --> 01:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
as it had gone in in a number of times
 
01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:00.550 align:start position:0%
as it had gone in in a number of times
too

01:16:00.550 --> 01:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
too
 
01:16:01.990 --> 01:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
on the

the extra costs to the municipalities of
 
01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:06.550 align:start position:0%
the extra costs to the municipalities of
this

01:16:06.550 --> 01:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:07.669 align:start position:0%
this
on

01:16:07.669 --> 01:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:16:09.669 --> 01:16:09.679 align:start position:0%
is something that i've been working on
 
01:16:11.430 --> 01:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
for a fair amount of time because
 
01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
lebanon is one of those urban hubs that
 
01:16:15.590 --> 01:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
has this problem
 
01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:16.709 align:start position:0%
has this problem
on

01:16:16.709 --> 01:16:16.719 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:16:16.719 --> 01:16:18.310 align:start position:0%
on
and

01:16:18.310 --> 01:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:16:22.149 --> 01:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
on this is on that piece of it line 20
 
01:16:25.350 --> 01:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
is from uh my senator's bill
 
01:16:29.030 --> 01:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh which the senate combined into there
 
01:16:32.470 --> 01:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
so on i'm going to be voting against but
 
01:16:34.950 --> 01:16:34.960 align:start position:0%
in general i agree with you
 
01:16:37.030 --> 01:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
on the bill
 
01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:42.709 align:start position:0%
further discussion
representatives

01:16:42.709 --> 01:16:42.719 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
01:16:44.709 --> 01:16:44.719 align:start position:0%
yeah i just want to say that i will be
 
01:16:48.950 --> 01:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
voting for the itl motion uh i
 
01:16:51.350 --> 01:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
01:16:53.350 --> 01:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
the information is always good to get
 
01:16:56.709 --> 01:16:56.719 align:start position:0%
and we can work on fine-tuning what we
 
01:16:59.350 --> 01:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
get in terms of source of
 
01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
revenues but there's a
 
01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:04.630 align:start position:0%
revenues but there's a
direction

01:17:04.630 --> 01:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
direction
 
01:17:06.709 --> 01:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
in which this bill points which i
 
01:17:08.149 --> 01:17:08.159 align:start position:0%
disagree with
 
01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh for the reasons really that
 
01:17:12.470 --> 01:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
representative langston stated i
 
01:17:14.870 --> 01:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
think the revenues that are raised from
 
01:17:17.430 --> 01:17:17.440 align:start position:0%
attacks like this are
 
01:17:18.870 --> 01:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
are then
 
01:17:23.430 --> 01:17:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:24.149 align:start position:0%
 
for

01:17:24.149 --> 01:17:24.159 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:17:27.030 --> 01:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
distribution according to action by the
 
01:17:30.630 --> 01:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
state and should be uh
 
01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:32.149 align:start position:0%
state and should be uh
occasionally

01:17:32.149 --> 01:17:32.159 align:start position:0%
occasionally
 
01:17:34.470 --> 01:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate to earmark but
 
01:17:37.430 --> 01:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
as a general rule i try to avoid that
 
01:17:38.709 --> 01:17:38.719 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
01:17:40.550 --> 01:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
that's why i will vote against it i'd
 
01:17:43.669 --> 01:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
also note that as a practical matter
 
01:17:45.590 --> 01:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
we're uh now
 
01:17:47.030 --> 01:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
in uh
 
01:17:50.630 --> 01:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
yeah where the heck are we in mid-april
 
01:17:51.910 --> 01:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:17:54.630 --> 01:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
we're headed into more time while this
 
01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:55.830 align:start position:0%
we're headed into more time while this
bill

01:17:55.830 --> 01:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:17:59.669 --> 01:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
uh gets to the end of its uh
 
01:18:01.830 --> 01:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
trio to enactment and if it were to be
 
01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
enacted we'd be into the mid-summer
 
01:18:06.229 --> 01:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
and we're in an election year and i
 
01:18:08.149 --> 01:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
doubt very much that any significant
 
01:18:09.750 --> 01:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
study will happen
 
01:18:11.910 --> 01:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
uh in that remaining time and i just
 
01:18:13.750 --> 01:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
assumed see it uh
 
01:18:16.149 --> 01:18:16.159 align:start position:0%
set aside and if there's a lot of
 
01:18:18.070 --> 01:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
interest in uh
 
01:18:20.070 --> 01:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
in uh doing this
 
01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh representative romney
 
01:18:29.990 --> 01:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
yeah i just i just want to comment that
 
01:18:32.630 --> 01:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
in terms of us studying this bill
 
01:18:35.430 --> 01:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
there's been five bills since 2015 of
 
01:18:36.709 --> 01:18:36.719 align:start position:0%
this kind
 
01:18:39.830 --> 01:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
to do actually act on on this uh not a
 
01:18:41.910 --> 01:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
study and we have a history in this
 
01:18:44.630 --> 01:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
committee of of forming subcommittees
 
01:18:46.070 --> 01:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
and i know there are several at least
 
01:18:48.149 --> 01:18:48.159 align:start position:0%
several subcommittees that have
 
01:18:51.030 --> 01:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
looked at this in depth over the years
 
01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:51.910 align:start position:0%
looked at this in depth over the years
so

01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:18:54.550 --> 01:18:54.560 align:start position:0%
again i i think this is i think we
 
01:18:56.310 --> 01:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
understand the issues
 
01:18:57.910 --> 01:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
it's just a matter of whether we have
 
01:18:59.669 --> 01:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
will and ways of means to pass a bill
 
01:19:01.110 --> 01:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
that does something that
 
01:19:02.950 --> 01:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
is being requested to be studied here
 
01:19:04.950 --> 01:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:19:07.990 --> 01:19:08.000 align:start position:0%

01:21:48.149 --> 01:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
the concerns i have is for the small
 
01:21:51.830 --> 01:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
business comp community in new hampshire
 
01:21:54.550 --> 01:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
now my general overall view of
 
01:21:57.110 --> 01:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
senate bill 435 is
 
01:21:58.390 --> 01:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
one portion of the bill is an
 
01:22:01.990 --> 01:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
apportionment fix for the big companies
 
01:22:05.750 --> 01:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
all right but for the 72 plus thousand
 
01:22:08.229 --> 01:22:08.239 align:start position:0%
small business owners that pay between
 
01:22:08.239 --> 01:22:09.189 align:start position:0%
small business owners that pay between
zero

01:22:09.189 --> 01:22:09.199 align:start position:0%
zero
 
01:22:11.350 --> 01:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
and ten thousand dollars
 
01:22:15.669 --> 01:22:15.679 align:start position:0%
in taxes paid from data from 2019
 
01:22:17.990 --> 01:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
the small businesses
 
01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:18.950 align:start position:0%
the small businesses
that

01:22:18.950 --> 01:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:22:19.990 --> 01:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
do not
 
01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.510 align:start position:0%
do not
apportion

01:22:21.510 --> 01:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
apportion
 
01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
the proposed n
 
01:22:26.709 --> 01:22:26.719 align:start position:0%
l nold and senate bill 435 is not a fix
 
01:22:29.110 --> 01:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
for them
 
01:22:31.669 --> 01:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
my biggest overall concern
 
01:22:33.750 --> 01:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
is that under existing law the small
 
01:22:36.709 --> 01:22:36.719 align:start position:0%
business owner can fully recover and
 
01:22:41.350 --> 01:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
utilize the nolds before reporting any
 
01:22:44.070 --> 01:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
taxable income
 
01:22:47.189 --> 01:22:47.199 align:start position:0%
under senate bill 435 the small business
 
01:22:47.199 --> 01:22:48.470 align:start position:0%
under senate bill 435 the small business
owner

01:22:48.470 --> 01:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
owner
 
01:22:51.350 --> 01:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
nold would be capped at 80 percent and
 
01:22:53.189 --> 01:22:53.199 align:start position:0%
this is where my concern is
 
01:22:55.350 --> 01:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
this is no fix for the small business
 
01:22:57.590 --> 01:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
owner trying to recover
 
01:22:59.830 --> 01:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
from the past two years of covid
 
01:23:04.310 --> 01:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
restrictions or the business turndowns
 
01:23:07.669 --> 01:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
what this does is handicaps
 
01:23:09.990 --> 01:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
this bill would handicap especially the
 
01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.390 align:start position:0%
this bill would handicap especially the
80

01:23:12.390 --> 01:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:14.229 --> 01:23:14.239 align:start position:0%
the survival
 
01:23:17.110 --> 01:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
of small businesses living off
 
01:23:18.310 --> 01:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
a small
 
01:23:21.030 --> 01:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
profit margin
 
01:23:24.629 --> 01:23:24.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:28.470 --> 01:23:28.480 align:start position:0%
on the elimination of the bpt nol
 
01:23:30.870 --> 01:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
double apportionment
 
01:23:34.070 --> 01:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
fiscally it will produce a decrease to
 
01:23:36.070 --> 01:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
the general
 
01:23:38.470 --> 01:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
and educational trust fund
 
01:23:40.550 --> 01:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
as stated by
 
01:23:43.030 --> 01:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
the dra
 
01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:50.070 align:start position:0%
 
third

01:23:50.070 --> 01:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
third
 
01:23:53.110 --> 01:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
what house bill 435 is also asking in
 
01:23:55.590 --> 01:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
this bill is to make changes without
 
01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:56.709 align:start position:0%
this bill is to make changes without
data

01:23:56.709 --> 01:23:56.719 align:start position:0%
data
 
01:23:59.189 --> 01:23:59.199 align:start position:0%
and the effect upon the state revenue
 
01:24:00.830 --> 01:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
for state
 
01:24:03.189 --> 01:24:03.199 align:start position:0%
programs the state switched to
 
01:24:05.030 --> 01:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing
 
01:24:07.590 --> 01:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
we have yet to see if the bpt
 
01:24:10.709 --> 01:24:10.719 align:start position:0%
is losing or gaining revenue without the
 
01:24:13.270 --> 01:24:13.280 align:start position:0%
federal stimulus monies that have been
 
01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:15.350 align:start position:0%
federal stimulus monies that have been
inserted

01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
inserted
 
01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:24:18.310 --> 01:24:18.320 align:start position:0%
or will refund
 
01:24:20.470 --> 01:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
taxes for businesses that got pp
 
01:24:23.430 --> 01:24:23.440 align:start position:0%
stimulus we do not know exactly how much
 
01:24:25.590 --> 01:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
anywhere between 90 and 100 million
 
01:24:28.390 --> 01:24:28.400 align:start position:0%
dollars over maybe a two or three year
 
01:24:31.430 --> 01:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
time period and now
 
01:24:33.030 --> 01:24:33.040 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
is moving to the single sales factor
 
01:24:39.270 --> 01:24:39.280 align:start position:0%
that this committee wish to hold off
 
01:24:42.709 --> 01:24:42.719 align:start position:0%
until 2025-26
 
01:24:45.990 --> 01:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
so that data could be compared by the
 
01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:47.590 align:start position:0%
so that data could be compared by the
dra

01:24:47.590 --> 01:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
dra
 
01:24:49.750 --> 01:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
to the prior property payroll sales
 
01:24:53.430 --> 01:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
formula through market-based sourcing
 
01:24:55.990 --> 01:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
we i think all want our small businesses
 
01:24:57.270 --> 01:24:57.280 align:start position:0%
to survive
 
01:24:59.590 --> 01:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
they are the largest employers
 
01:25:07.350 --> 01:25:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:09.990 --> 01:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
as i look across the room to
 
01:25:13.030 --> 01:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
my friends on the other side my business
 
01:25:16.070 --> 01:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
friends on the other side
 
01:25:18.470 --> 01:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
i am suggesting maybe we have an
 
01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:19.750 align:start position:0%
i am suggesting maybe we have an
amendment

01:25:19.750 --> 01:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:25:24.070 --> 01:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
to assist the small business owners
 
01:25:26.950 --> 01:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
and i hope that my friends across the
 
01:25:28.390 --> 01:25:28.400 align:start position:0%
aisle that are pro-business would be
 
01:25:31.510 --> 01:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
willing to work maybe to
 
01:25:34.310 --> 01:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
either decouple through an amendment
 
01:25:36.470 --> 01:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh the 80 cap
 
01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:37.750 align:start position:0%
uh the 80 cap
or

01:25:37.750 --> 01:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:38.709 align:start position:0%
or
adopt

01:25:38.709 --> 01:25:38.719 align:start position:0%
adopt
 
01:25:40.950 --> 01:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
the 80 percent cap
 
01:25:43.910 --> 01:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
and have an indefinite carry forward or
 
01:25:46.229 --> 01:25:46.239 align:start position:0%
maybe there's a third option or fourth
 
01:25:46.239 --> 01:25:47.270 align:start position:0%
maybe there's a third option or fourth
option

01:25:47.270 --> 01:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
option
 
01:25:48.950 --> 01:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
that is possible
 
01:25:51.750 --> 01:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
but to come together so that we can give
 
01:25:54.149 --> 01:25:54.159 align:start position:0%
our small business owners a break and
 
01:25:56.870 --> 01:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
maybe and level the tax
 
01:25:56.880 --> 01:25:57.990 align:start position:0%
maybe and level the tax
field

01:25:57.990 --> 01:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
field
 
01:25:58.000 --> 01:25:59.830 align:start position:0%
field
between

01:25:59.830 --> 01:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:26:02.550 --> 01:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
big and small
 
01:26:05.350 --> 01:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:26:07.510 --> 01:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative schoenberg
 
01:26:10.790 --> 01:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
and representative rodney
 
01:26:11.990 --> 01:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
okay can i
 
01:26:14.310 --> 01:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
01:26:16.709 --> 01:26:16.719 align:start position:0%
representative schoenberg so
 
01:26:18.870 --> 01:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
you're okay with section one of the bill
 
01:26:20.310 --> 01:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
01:26:23.590 --> 01:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
yes i am i'm not happy but i'm okay okay
 
01:26:25.030 --> 01:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
so we're we're really talking about the
 
01:26:27.110 --> 01:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
second section of the bill and basically
 
01:26:28.629 --> 01:26:28.639 align:start position:0%
pretty much the 80
 
01:26:28.639 --> 01:26:29.590 align:start position:0%
pretty much the 80
part

01:26:29.590 --> 01:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
part
 
01:26:30.790 --> 01:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
true so
 
01:26:34.550 --> 01:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
and all the 80 part does is is extends
 
01:26:36.149 --> 01:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
they they can eventually all businesses
 
01:26:37.750 --> 01:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
can eventually take all their net
 
01:26:39.910 --> 01:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
operating loss
 
01:26:41.830 --> 01:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
yes they can
 
01:26:43.750 --> 01:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
over time
 
01:26:45.990 --> 01:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
okay but this just slows it down a bit
 
01:26:48.709 --> 01:26:48.719 align:start position:0%
by having the 80 they can't take
 
01:26:51.350 --> 01:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
it extends it out okay
 
01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:52.310 align:start position:0%
it extends it out okay
so

01:26:52.310 --> 01:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:26:54.390 --> 01:26:54.400 align:start position:0%
uh i'm not necessarily opposed to your
 
01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:55.350 align:start position:0%
uh i'm not necessarily opposed to your
thought

01:26:55.350 --> 01:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
thought
 
01:26:56.870 --> 01:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
about trying to protect
 
01:26:58.790 --> 01:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
smaller businesses
 
01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:01.110 align:start position:0%
smaller businesses
uh

01:27:01.110 --> 01:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:27:03.030 --> 01:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
this is interesting because you know
 
01:27:05.189 --> 01:27:05.199 align:start position:0%
with this second part of the bill
 
01:27:07.030 --> 01:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
it actually
 
01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:08.550 align:start position:0%
it actually
actually

01:27:08.550 --> 01:27:08.560 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:27:11.270 --> 01:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
slows the flow of revenue it is more
 
01:27:13.590 --> 01:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
with like five 4.5 million estimated by
 
01:27:16.070 --> 01:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
the dra
 
01:27:17.590 --> 01:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
that would
 
01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:19.430 align:start position:0%
that would
would

01:27:19.430 --> 01:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:27:21.669 --> 01:27:21.679 align:start position:0%
uh stay with the state and not go to
 
01:27:21.679 --> 01:27:24.390 align:start position:0%
uh stay with the state and not go to
businesses

01:27:24.390 --> 01:27:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:25.430 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:27:25.430 --> 01:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:26.709 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:27:26.709 --> 01:27:26.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:29.110 --> 01:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
you know so i see this to do
 
01:27:30.790 --> 01:27:30.800 align:start position:0%
what you're proposing is either get rid
 
01:27:33.350 --> 01:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
of the 80 totally and which we don't
 
01:27:35.510 --> 01:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
have just don't adept up the
 
01:27:37.189 --> 01:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
new federal guideline for that
 
01:27:39.270 --> 01:27:39.280 align:start position:0%
particular thing
 
01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:40.390 align:start position:0%
particular thing
or

01:27:40.390 --> 01:27:40.400 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:27:41.430 --> 01:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:42.229 align:start position:0%
you know
or

01:27:42.229 --> 01:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:27:45.510 --> 01:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
uh do something that we we put a tier in
 
01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:46.709 align:start position:0%
uh do something that we we put a tier in
here

01:27:46.709 --> 01:27:46.719 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:27:49.189 --> 01:27:49.199 align:start position:0%
for smaller businesses
 
01:27:50.629 --> 01:27:50.639 align:start position:0%
and that's something we need to discuss
 
01:27:52.149 --> 01:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
01:27:53.750 --> 01:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:27:55.750 --> 01:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
representative thank you we have carolyn
 
01:27:56.950 --> 01:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
in the room so i might have a question
 
01:27:58.830 --> 01:27:58.840 align:start position:0%
before she runs away to the washington
 
01:28:01.110 --> 01:28:01.120 align:start position:0%
dc um i want to make sure i'm clear
 
01:28:03.350 --> 01:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
because because what was said i i was a
 
01:28:05.590 --> 01:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
little confusing so my understanding of
 
01:28:08.550 --> 01:28:08.560 align:start position:0%
what this does with the 80 carryover is
 
01:28:09.830 --> 01:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
if you have a business in the first year
 
01:28:11.270 --> 01:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
that lost a hundred thousand dollars in
 
01:28:13.189 --> 01:28:13.199 align:start position:0%
the second year they made a hundred
 
01:28:14.390 --> 01:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
01:28:15.750 --> 01:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
they would be able to take eighty
 
01:28:17.270 --> 01:28:17.280 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in the first year and
 
01:28:18.870 --> 01:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
apply that towards their so they're only
 
01:28:20.470 --> 01:28:20.480 align:start position:0%
paying taxes on
 
01:28:22.950 --> 01:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand dollars is that correct
 
01:28:24.950 --> 01:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
and then the third year they could use
 
01:28:26.390 --> 01:28:26.400 align:start position:0%
the balance of that twenty thousand
 
01:28:27.590 --> 01:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
dollars assuming they made the same
 
01:28:28.950 --> 01:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars they could then
 
01:28:30.550 --> 01:28:30.560 align:start position:0%
take that same twenty thousand dollar
 
01:28:32.470 --> 01:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
loss put it into the third years and
 
01:28:33.990 --> 01:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
they would only pay taxes on eighty
 
01:28:35.750 --> 01:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars is that the clearance
 
01:28:37.510 --> 01:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
thing so they they get the full use of
 
01:28:39.110 --> 01:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
the net operating loss over the course
 
01:28:41.189 --> 01:28:41.199 align:start position:0%
of it it's just spread out
 
01:28:43.350 --> 01:28:43.360 align:start position:0%
so i think so she's shaking her head yes
 
01:28:44.790 --> 01:28:44.800 align:start position:0%
for anybody who has doesn't see her on
 
01:28:46.950 --> 01:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
the camera so mr chair i guess the way i
 
01:28:48.790 --> 01:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
look at this is this is actually helps
 
01:28:50.629 --> 01:28:50.639 align:start position:0%
the state with revenues relative to
 
01:28:50.639 --> 01:28:52.149 align:start position:0%
the state with revenues relative to
flattening

01:28:52.149 --> 01:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
flattening
 
01:28:53.910 --> 01:28:53.920 align:start position:0%
problems right so again if you have a
 
01:28:55.110 --> 01:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
bunch of businesses take a bunch of
 
01:28:56.550 --> 01:28:56.560 align:start position:0%
losses and they take all the losses in
 
01:28:58.550 --> 01:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
the first year that's going to tank our
 
01:28:58.560 --> 01:28:59.750 align:start position:0%
the first year that's going to tank our
revenues

01:28:59.750 --> 01:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
01:29:01.110 --> 01:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
in one year
 
01:29:03.750 --> 01:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
whereas by using the 80 factor
 
01:29:06.229 --> 01:29:06.239 align:start position:0%
when they go to take that loss
 
01:29:07.510 --> 01:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
they get the full loss they just got to
 
01:29:09.110 --> 01:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
take it over a longer period of time
 
01:29:11.350 --> 01:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
which helps our revenues stabilize so i
 
01:29:13.430 --> 01:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
looked this as a tax stabilization bill
 
01:29:15.510 --> 01:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
that helps us with businesses even
 
01:29:16.790 --> 01:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
through rough times and when they come
 
01:29:18.149 --> 01:29:18.159 align:start position:0%
out of those rough times be able to
 
01:29:20.870 --> 01:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
still use 100 of their nol
 
01:29:23.590 --> 01:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
but at the same time it doesn't bang the
 
01:29:26.070 --> 01:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
state as hard on its revenues so i look
 
01:29:27.910 --> 01:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
at it as a good bill for stabilization
 
01:29:29.910 --> 01:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
with state revenues to help us make it
 
01:29:32.950 --> 01:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
through those hard times um and and i'll
 
01:29:34.870 --> 01:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
be voting in favor of them
 
01:29:36.629 --> 01:29:36.639 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
01:29:36.639 --> 01:29:40.310 align:start position:0%
mr chair
representative

01:29:40.310 --> 01:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:44.550 --> 01:29:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:46.070 --> 01:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
i'm glad you're concerned about the
 
01:29:47.669 --> 01:29:47.679 align:start position:0%
state but what about the small business
 
01:29:50.149 --> 01:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
owner that that needs that money
 
01:29:53.270 --> 01:29:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh that small margin to stay in business
 
01:29:56.149 --> 01:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
to keep his employees
 
01:29:56.159 --> 01:29:57.270 align:start position:0%
to keep his employees
employed

01:29:57.270 --> 01:29:57.280 align:start position:0%
employed
 
01:29:59.350 --> 01:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
paying and buying
 
01:30:02.149 --> 01:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
uh products here in new hampshire
 
01:30:06.310 --> 01:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
so that more revenue can come in i i i
 
01:30:08.070 --> 01:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
i'm having a hard time
 
01:30:10.070 --> 01:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
following your i understand what you're
 
01:30:10.080 --> 01:30:11.590 align:start position:0%
following your i understand what you're
saying

01:30:11.590 --> 01:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
saying
 
01:30:14.070 --> 01:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
but i'm having a hard time following why
 
01:30:15.750 --> 01:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
do you not want to
 
01:30:17.189 --> 01:30:17.199 align:start position:0%
assist the
 
01:30:20.629 --> 01:30:20.639 align:start position:0%
small business owner now
 
01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
just one one quick response one thing
 
01:30:23.750 --> 01:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
remember is that new hampshire is an
 
01:30:25.189 --> 01:30:25.199 align:start position:0%
outlier in this
 
01:30:27.110 --> 01:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
right so i think we heard 49 other
 
01:30:29.590 --> 01:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
states do it this way with the 80
 
01:30:32.310 --> 01:30:32.320 align:start position:0%
and adopting that federal rule right so
 
01:30:34.070 --> 01:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
it makes it more compliant and makes
 
01:30:36.229 --> 01:30:36.239 align:start position:0%
businesses or move that are dealing
 
01:30:37.590 --> 01:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
either whether it's a multi-state
 
01:30:39.430 --> 01:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
business or otherwise again it
 
01:30:41.430 --> 01:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
standardizes states so we're not this
 
01:30:44.070 --> 01:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
one-off in the entire country so you
 
01:30:45.830 --> 01:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
know while i recognize that and again we
 
01:30:47.030 --> 01:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
are giving them the benefit which is
 
01:30:48.629 --> 01:30:48.639 align:start position:0%
only given 80 of the benefit that last
 
01:30:50.149 --> 01:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
20 percent they still get they just got
 
01:30:51.590 --> 01:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
to wait one more year for us so i don't
 
01:30:53.990 --> 01:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
think we're you know i i don't think
 
01:30:56.149 --> 01:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
we're hurt it's that it's it's as
 
01:30:57.669 --> 01:30:57.679 align:start position:0%
drastic as you say i guess is my
 
01:30:57.679 --> 01:30:59.750 align:start position:0%
drastic as you say i guess is my
statement

01:30:59.750 --> 01:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
statement
 
01:31:01.669 --> 01:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
the um problem
 
01:31:01.679 --> 01:31:02.790 align:start position:0%
the um problem
is

01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:02.800 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:31:03.910 --> 01:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
how do
 
01:31:07.270 --> 01:31:07.280 align:start position:0%
how do you define that small business
 
01:31:09.910 --> 01:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
the point where they get the exemption
 
01:31:11.510 --> 01:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
or not
 
01:31:17.830 --> 01:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:19.590 --> 01:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
if we were in a maybe a study committee
 
01:31:21.590 --> 01:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
we might be able to come up with a
 
01:31:23.669 --> 01:31:23.679 align:start position:0%
a good answer on that
 
01:31:23.679 --> 01:31:25.030 align:start position:0%
a good answer on that
representative

almy

01:31:32.110 --> 01:31:32.120 align:start position:0%
thank you on my thought on this was on
 
01:31:35.270 --> 01:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
250 000
 
01:31:37.669 --> 01:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
of net on
 
01:31:39.910 --> 01:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
taxable profit
 
01:31:42.790 --> 01:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
uh before the nold
 
01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:44.709 align:start position:0%
uh before the nold
on

01:31:44.709 --> 01:31:44.719 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:31:47.910 --> 01:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know if they've got some idea in
 
01:31:51.430 --> 01:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
dra or could create it of
 
01:31:53.590 --> 01:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
how much that would actually lose us of
 
01:31:54.790 --> 01:31:54.800 align:start position:0%
this money
 
01:31:57.590 --> 01:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
because a lot of this money comes from
 
01:32:02.229 --> 01:32:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:02.239 --> 01:32:03.270 align:start position:0%
 
but

01:32:03.270 --> 01:32:03.280 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:32:06.550 --> 01:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
the example we were given by mr seglio
 
01:32:11.189 --> 01:32:11.199 align:start position:0%
is on for a two-year recession
 
01:32:14.390 --> 01:32:14.400 align:start position:0%
and it took till
 
01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:15.189 align:start position:0%
and it took till
they

01:32:15.189 --> 01:32:15.199 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:32:18.229 --> 01:32:18.239 align:start position:0%
would be paying
 
01:32:18.239 --> 01:32:20.709 align:start position:0%
would be paying
on

01:32:20.709 --> 01:32:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:22.870 --> 01:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
it would take them three years four
 
01:32:25.270 --> 01:32:25.280 align:start position:0%
years to get out of this
 
01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:26.950 align:start position:0%
years to get out of this
on

01:32:26.950 --> 01:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:32:29.189 --> 01:32:29.199 align:start position:0%
this cost
 
01:32:31.510 --> 01:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
and if it was a
 
01:32:34.709 --> 01:32:34.719 align:start position:0%
bigger loss and a bigger recession
 
01:32:36.790 --> 01:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
on as we had
 
01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:38.950 align:start position:0%
on as we had
n08

01:32:38.950 --> 01:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
n08
 
01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:42.400 align:start position:0%
to 11.
 
01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:43.350 align:start position:0%
to 11.
then

01:32:43.350 --> 01:32:43.360 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:44.310 align:start position:0%
then
they

01:32:44.310 --> 01:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:32:46.870 --> 01:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
they come to a point where
 
01:32:48.229 --> 01:32:48.239 align:start position:0%
they really
 
01:32:48.239 --> 01:32:48.950 align:start position:0%
they really
uh

01:32:48.950 --> 01:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:32:52.830 --> 01:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
a small portion of this money disappears
 
01:32:57.110 --> 01:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
completely as i understand it
 
01:32:57.120 --> 01:32:58.229 align:start position:0%
completely as i understand it
but

01:32:58.229 --> 01:32:58.239 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:32:58.239 --> 01:33:00.070 align:start position:0%
but
on

01:33:00.070 --> 01:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:33:02.950 --> 01:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
the it's the small businesses that don't
 
01:33:04.550 --> 01:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
have a cushion
 
01:33:06.709 --> 01:33:06.719 align:start position:0%
usually to take them through this unless
 
01:33:08.790 --> 01:33:08.800 align:start position:0%
they've got somebody working another job
 
01:33:10.870 --> 01:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
that didn't lose the job and things like
 
01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:12.950 align:start position:0%
that didn't lose the job and things like
that

01:33:12.950 --> 01:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:33:14.550 --> 01:33:14.560 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:15.750 align:start position:0%
and so
it's

01:33:15.750 --> 01:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:33:17.750 --> 01:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
it's the and
 
01:33:21.189 --> 01:33:21.199 align:start position:0%
our our tax we have to remember that our
 
01:33:22.790 --> 01:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
business taxes
 
01:33:25.510 --> 01:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
are a much larger part of our budget
 
01:33:28.229 --> 01:33:28.239 align:start position:0%
than in any other state
 
01:33:31.030 --> 01:33:31.040 align:start position:0%
and a lot of them regard their business
 
01:33:32.950 --> 01:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
taxes as
 
01:33:37.590 --> 01:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
as we regard our communications tax
 
01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:39.030 align:start position:0%
as we regard our communications tax
so

01:33:39.030 --> 01:33:39.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:33:41.030 --> 01:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
presumably their businesses are not
 
01:33:43.830 --> 01:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
being taxed that much through that
 
01:33:46.790 --> 01:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
area if we were to do that we would not
 
01:33:49.910 --> 01:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
have a government left because we don't
 
01:33:54.870 --> 01:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:58.629 --> 01:33:58.639 align:start position:0%
we need more than a guideline of
 
01:34:01.430 --> 01:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
250 000
 
01:34:03.910 --> 01:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
we need a better definition of a small
 
01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:04.870 align:start position:0%
we need a better definition of a small
business

01:34:04.870 --> 01:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:34:07.750 --> 01:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
because a lot a huge
 
01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:09.270 align:start position:0%
because a lot a huge
business

01:34:09.270 --> 01:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:34:12.550 --> 01:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
could have a year where they have 240
 
01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:13.510 align:start position:0%
could have a year where they have 240
000

01:34:13.510 --> 01:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
000
 
01:34:14.950 --> 01:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
and they would get
 
01:34:16.950 --> 01:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
the advantage
 
01:34:18.709 --> 01:34:18.719 align:start position:0%
if you're trying to protect the small
 
01:34:21.510 --> 01:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
business it should be concentrated to
 
01:34:23.430 --> 01:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
the small business
 
01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:25.030 align:start position:0%
the small business
um

01:34:25.030 --> 01:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:28.550 --> 01:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
represent ames did you
 
01:34:31.030 --> 01:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
did you have an idea of how to define
 
01:34:36.629 --> 01:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:40.149 --> 01:34:40.159 align:start position:0%
i really hadn't thought about that no
 
01:34:43.350 --> 01:34:43.360 align:start position:0%
i i think if we're going to go down this
 
01:34:44.629 --> 01:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
road then
 
01:34:46.950 --> 01:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
we need to use
 
01:34:48.310 --> 01:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
the next
 
01:34:50.229 --> 01:34:50.239 align:start position:0%
two weeks to
 
01:34:52.310 --> 01:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
develop an amendment that
 
01:34:55.350 --> 01:34:55.360 align:start position:0%
would be have a reasonable uh
 
01:34:57.109 --> 01:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
cut off basically we're talking about
 
01:34:59.830 --> 01:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
cut off at
 
01:35:01.590 --> 01:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
see if see if that
 
01:35:03.830 --> 01:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
indeed would work and
 
01:35:06.149 --> 01:35:06.159 align:start position:0%
the other comment i make is
 
01:35:08.149 --> 01:35:08.159 align:start position:0%
responding to some of the discussion is
 
01:35:10.550 --> 01:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
01:35:13.830 --> 01:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
that we wouldn't have a 10 year limit if
 
01:35:14.950 --> 01:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
we didn't
 
01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:15.910 align:start position:0%
we didn't
or

01:35:15.910 --> 01:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:35:18.629 --> 01:35:18.639 align:start position:0%
it used to be a shorter limit if we
 
01:35:23.270 --> 01:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:25.669 --> 01:35:25.679 align:start position:0%
some businesses might go up to that
 
01:35:27.830 --> 01:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
limit we wouldn't have extended it out
 
01:35:29.590 --> 01:35:29.600 align:start position:0%
to 10 years
 
01:35:31.030 --> 01:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:35:32.790 --> 01:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
the federal government wouldn't have
 
01:35:34.950 --> 01:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
extended it out indefinitely if they
 
01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:35.830 align:start position:0%
extended it out indefinitely if they
didn't

01:35:35.830 --> 01:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
01:35:38.709 --> 01:35:38.719 align:start position:0%
if there wasn't some evidence that some
 
01:35:38.719 --> 01:35:40.470 align:start position:0%
if there wasn't some evidence that some
businesses

01:35:40.470 --> 01:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
01:35:42.790 --> 01:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
needed that extended period of time so
 
01:35:45.830 --> 01:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
if you if you drop down to 80
 
01:35:47.990 --> 01:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh there's a good likelihood it strikes
 
01:35:50.629 --> 01:35:50.639 align:start position:0%
me that there will be some businesses
 
01:35:53.990 --> 01:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
that will year after year take up to 80
 
01:35:57.030 --> 01:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
of their operating loss
 
01:35:59.350 --> 01:35:59.360 align:start position:0%
and come out at the end of 10 years with
 
01:36:01.030 --> 01:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
still some
 
01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:02.629 align:start position:0%
still some
operating

01:36:02.629 --> 01:36:02.639 align:start position:0%
operating
 
01:36:05.910 --> 01:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
up to 80 of their profit i meant to say
 
01:36:07.990 --> 01:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
will come up to the end of 10 years and
 
01:36:09.910 --> 01:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
still have some operating laws that they
 
01:36:13.510 --> 01:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
haven't taken and now they've run out
 
01:36:15.109 --> 01:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
i think that's inevitable that's just a
 
01:36:17.830 --> 01:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
matter of math and reality
 
01:36:19.669 --> 01:36:19.679 align:start position:0%
and just reading between the lines of
 
01:36:21.109 --> 01:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
why there's been this pressure at the
 
01:36:22.629 --> 01:36:22.639 align:start position:0%
federal level to
 
01:36:25.270 --> 01:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
go to an unlimited time limit
 
01:36:27.350 --> 01:36:27.360 align:start position:0%
so those are my comments
 
01:36:29.510 --> 01:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
representative gamalo
 
01:36:32.149 --> 01:36:32.159 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative ames said a
 
01:36:34.310 --> 01:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
couple of the points i wanted to make
 
01:36:35.830 --> 01:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
um but i'd like to point out that
 
01:36:38.470 --> 01:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
there's according to this chart 18
 
01:36:40.629 --> 01:36:40.639 align:start position:0%
states that have conformed
 
01:36:40.639 --> 01:36:42.629 align:start position:0%
states that have conformed
and

01:36:42.629 --> 01:36:42.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:36:42.639 --> 01:36:43.510 align:start position:0%
and
what

01:36:43.510 --> 01:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:36:46.310 --> 01:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
mr eusiglio's recommendation was if we
 
01:36:49.189 --> 01:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
kept the 80 cap was to go to the
 
01:36:51.109 --> 01:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
indefinite carry forward period like
 
01:36:53.189 --> 01:36:53.199 align:start position:0%
representative ames just said
 
01:36:54.550 --> 01:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
and i believe we already had an
 
01:36:56.470 --> 01:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
amendment in the works to eliminate
 
01:36:58.870 --> 01:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
lines 5 to 22
 
01:37:00.870 --> 01:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
so maybe we could just add that one
 
01:37:02.709 --> 01:37:02.719 align:start position:0%
piece and not worry about what a small
 
01:37:05.669 --> 01:37:05.679 align:start position:0%
business is or not but just say that um
 
01:37:07.350 --> 01:37:07.360 align:start position:0%
we have an indefinite carry forward
 
01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
period instead of
 
01:37:12.950 --> 01:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
trying to make it too complicated
 
01:37:14.629 --> 01:37:14.639 align:start position:0%
rob's in a line
 
01:37:16.070 --> 01:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
so i did submit that amendment but i
 
01:37:18.229 --> 01:37:18.239 align:start position:0%
think we all got the email from david
 
01:37:20.070 --> 01:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
saying with the rush that amendments are
 
01:37:21.590 --> 01:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
being delayed
 
01:37:23.510 --> 01:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
out of ols so we didn't have it in time
 
01:37:25.030 --> 01:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
for this meeting so
 
01:37:27.189 --> 01:37:27.199 align:start position:0%
um again i well i would love to clean up
 
01:37:28.709 --> 01:37:28.719 align:start position:0%
the language i'm happy to move it
 
01:37:30.229 --> 01:37:30.239 align:start position:0%
forward the way it is and not delay
 
01:37:32.229 --> 01:37:32.239 align:start position:0%
again the house's scheduling is
 
01:37:33.910 --> 01:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
important and getting bills out of
 
01:37:35.669 --> 01:37:35.679 align:start position:0%
committee is important and i i don't
 
01:37:37.109 --> 01:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
think just cleaning up the language is
 
01:37:39.990 --> 01:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
enough to delay this bill so i we we
 
01:37:41.910 --> 01:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
postulated the idea of moving it to 20
 
01:37:43.669 --> 01:37:43.679 align:start position:0%
years and it felt like the committee had
 
01:37:45.910 --> 01:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
no appetite for that
 
01:37:47.750 --> 01:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
when we discussed it the last at the
 
01:37:50.070 --> 01:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
last meeting so the only thing the
 
01:37:51.590 --> 01:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
amendment would have done was strike a
 
01:37:52.550 --> 01:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
through d
 
01:37:54.709 --> 01:37:54.719 align:start position:0%
and that was a cleanup language so i i'm
 
01:37:56.149 --> 01:37:56.159 align:start position:0%
happy to move the bill forward the way
 
01:38:01.350 --> 01:38:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:03.910 align:start position:0%
 
representation

01:38:03.910 --> 01:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
representation
 
01:38:05.750 --> 01:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you we've been having this
 
01:38:08.550 --> 01:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
discussion for a number of years as
 
01:38:11.510 --> 01:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
other states and the federal government
 
01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:12.390 align:start position:0%
other states and the federal government
on

01:38:12.390 --> 01:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:38:15.109 --> 01:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
at least here in new hampshire
 
01:38:18.950 --> 01:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
on when we moved to 10 years
 
01:38:21.380 --> 01:38:21.390 align:start position:0%
i think we were at two
 
01:38:21.390 --> 01:38:22.629 align:start position:0%
i think we were at two
[Music]

01:38:22.629 --> 01:38:22.639 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:38:22.639 --> 01:38:23.830 align:start position:0%
[Music]
and

01:38:23.830 --> 01:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:38:26.310 --> 01:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
it might have been five
 
01:38:28.709 --> 01:38:28.719 align:start position:0%
but the general idea was other states
 
01:38:30.550 --> 01:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
are doing it we have to do it too it
 
01:38:33.030 --> 01:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
wasn't really anything else
 
01:38:34.629 --> 01:38:34.639 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:38:34.639 --> 01:38:35.669 align:start position:0%
and the
the

01:38:35.669 --> 01:38:35.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:38:38.149 --> 01:38:38.159 align:start position:0%
advice against it which was really
 
01:38:40.390 --> 01:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
extreme towards the beginning of our
 
01:38:43.030 --> 01:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
time uh commissioner blatzos was still
 
01:38:45.990 --> 01:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
there he didn't have very good he didn't
 
01:38:50.149 --> 01:38:50.159 align:start position:0%
have any uh analysis to back this up
 
01:38:53.109 --> 01:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
but on he was afraid that it was going
 
01:38:55.430 --> 01:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
to cost a huge amount of money
 
01:38:59.189 --> 01:38:59.199 align:start position:0%
uh with all of the data collection that
 
01:39:01.270 --> 01:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
we've done we can't predict the future
 
01:39:04.470 --> 01:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
as dra has said and so they can't tell
 
01:39:07.910 --> 01:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
us how much we might lose or not lose if
 
01:39:10.830 --> 01:39:10.840 align:start position:0%
we went out to indefinite
 
01:39:14.550 --> 01:39:14.560 align:start position:0%
on from 10 years
 
01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:16.229 align:start position:0%
on from 10 years
and

01:39:16.229 --> 01:39:16.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:39:18.790 --> 01:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
the only way that i can see that
 
01:39:22.550 --> 01:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
we would have businesses operating with
 
01:39:24.790 --> 01:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
such huge operating losses and still
 
01:39:28.390 --> 01:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
able to be part of it is
 
01:39:31.990 --> 01:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
this on sharing of intangibles
 
01:39:33.030 --> 01:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
that they
 
01:39:35.910 --> 01:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
can a large corporation creates a
 
01:39:38.790 --> 01:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
business inside of new hampshire which
 
01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:39.590 align:start position:0%
business inside of new hampshire which
is

01:39:39.590 --> 01:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:40.950 align:start position:0%
is
basically

01:39:40.950 --> 01:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
basically
 
01:39:43.750 --> 01:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
uh sending all of its profits out to new
 
01:39:45.669 --> 01:39:45.679 align:start position:0%
jersey or what not they wouldn't do new
 
01:39:47.669 --> 01:39:47.679 align:start position:0%
jersey to florida
 
01:39:47.679 --> 01:39:48.629 align:start position:0%
jersey to florida
and

01:39:48.629 --> 01:39:48.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:39:52.830 --> 01:39:52.840 align:start position:0%
and uh reporting them there by way of of
 
01:39:54.790 --> 01:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
selling on
 
01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:55.669 align:start position:0%
selling on
their

01:39:55.669 --> 01:39:55.679 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:39:55.679 --> 01:39:56.870 align:start position:0%
their
brand

01:39:56.870 --> 01:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
brand
 
01:39:58.870 --> 01:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
to the place in
 
01:39:58.880 --> 01:39:59.910 align:start position:0%
to the place in
on

01:39:59.910 --> 01:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:40:02.629 --> 01:40:02.639 align:start position:0%
in florida or something like that and
 
01:40:05.669 --> 01:40:05.679 align:start position:0%
then having to pay royalties to them
 
01:40:05.679 --> 01:40:06.830 align:start position:0%
then having to pay royalties to them
so

01:40:06.830 --> 01:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:40:11.030 --> 01:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
um so that that is something that would
 
01:40:13.669 --> 01:40:13.679 align:start position:0%
allow very large businesses to do that
 
01:40:15.590 --> 01:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
kind of thing i don't think any small
 
01:40:17.750 --> 01:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
business could possibly
 
01:40:19.669 --> 01:40:19.679 align:start position:0%
manage that
 
01:40:19.679 --> 01:40:20.550 align:start position:0%
manage that
but

01:40:20.550 --> 01:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:40:23.830 --> 01:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:25.910 --> 01:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:40:28.149 --> 01:40:28.159 align:start position:0%
i'm comfortable with the balance
 
01:40:28.159 --> 01:40:29.669 align:start position:0%
i'm comfortable with the balance
um

01:40:29.669 --> 01:40:29.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:32.070 --> 01:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
as the senate has presented the bill
 
01:40:34.950 --> 01:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
to us and i'll be supporting it
 
01:40:37.430 --> 01:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
i think as a practical matter
 
01:40:40.149 --> 01:40:40.159 align:start position:0%
10 years provides ample time
 
01:40:40.159 --> 01:40:41.270 align:start position:0%
10 years provides ample time
to

01:40:41.270 --> 01:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:40:43.109 --> 01:40:43.119 align:start position:0%
recapture your losses and apply them
 
01:40:45.990 --> 01:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
against future gains even with the 80
 
01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:47.750 align:start position:0%
against future gains even with the 80
percent

01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
as to representative southworth's
 
01:40:51.990 --> 01:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
concern about small business which i
 
01:40:53.510 --> 01:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
think we all share the concern is a
 
01:40:55.590 --> 01:40:55.600 align:start position:0%
generalized matter
 
01:40:57.350 --> 01:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
let's just remember that last year in
 
01:41:00.470 --> 01:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
sb2 we took a very significant step
 
01:41:03.430 --> 01:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
uh in that direction by nearly doubling
 
01:41:06.470 --> 01:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
the filing threshold and so i would
 
01:41:08.229 --> 01:41:08.239 align:start position:0%
venture that
 
01:41:10.149 --> 01:41:10.159 align:start position:0%
the list of small businesses that
 
01:41:12.870 --> 01:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
representative southworth is and excuse
 
01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:13.990 align:start position:0%
representative southworth is and excuse
me

01:41:13.990 --> 01:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:41:15.350 --> 01:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
pardon me
 
01:41:17.430 --> 01:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
is referring to
 
01:41:20.470 --> 01:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
which is a 2019 list
 
01:41:22.629 --> 01:41:22.639 align:start position:0%
i would bet that a very large number of
 
01:41:24.550 --> 01:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
those taxpayers are now alleviated
 
01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:28.629 align:start position:0%
those taxpayers are now alleviated
altogether

01:41:28.629 --> 01:41:28.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:31.109 --> 01:41:31.119 align:start position:0%
for the discussion um
 
01:41:33.750 --> 01:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
with the dra
 
01:41:42.229 --> 01:41:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:44.950 --> 01:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
representative bromley
 
01:41:46.870 --> 01:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
yeah uh following on to what
 
01:41:48.950 --> 01:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
representative pillsbury said
 
01:41:52.149 --> 01:41:52.159 align:start position:0%
that change in the threshold
 
01:41:52.159 --> 01:41:53.270 align:start position:0%
that change in the threshold
really

01:41:53.270 --> 01:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:54.229 align:start position:0%
really
really

01:41:54.229 --> 01:41:54.239 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:41:55.510 --> 01:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
means that there are a lot more
 
01:41:57.910 --> 01:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
businesses that are not paying the
 
01:41:57.920 --> 01:41:59.189 align:start position:0%
businesses that are not paying the
bpt

01:41:59.189 --> 01:41:59.199 align:start position:0%
bpt
 
01:41:59.199 --> 01:42:01.910 align:start position:0%
bpt
correct

01:42:01.910 --> 01:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:03.430 --> 01:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
that's right i don't have my fiscal
 
01:42:06.629 --> 01:42:06.639 align:start position:0%
analysis from the those bills but i
 
01:42:08.390 --> 01:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
believe in that analysis we actually
 
01:42:09.830 --> 01:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
named the number
 
01:42:11.270 --> 01:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
of bills that would no longer be
 
01:42:12.870 --> 01:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
required to pay and i believe in both
 
01:42:14.470 --> 01:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
instances it was in the thousands
 
01:42:16.629 --> 01:42:16.639 align:start position:0%
because we raised both the bpt and the
 
01:42:19.830 --> 01:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
bet threshold last session right right
 
01:42:21.109 --> 01:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:42:23.750 --> 01:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
i know uh devin
 
01:42:25.590 --> 01:42:25.600 align:start position:0%
created a document
 
01:42:28.149 --> 01:42:28.159 align:start position:0%
that i have in front of me here that
 
01:42:30.629 --> 01:42:30.639 align:start position:0%
shows the number of businesses by the by
 
01:42:32.149 --> 01:42:32.159 align:start position:0%
the categories you know how we break it
 
01:42:33.990 --> 01:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
by the amount of uh
 
01:42:35.990 --> 01:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
of tax
 
01:42:39.189 --> 01:42:39.199 align:start position:0%
and yes i mean it it this does seem to
 
01:42:40.390 --> 01:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
say that
 
01:42:43.910 --> 01:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
the adjusted uh business profit tax
 
01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:45.990 align:start position:0%
the adjusted uh business profit tax
um

01:42:45.990 --> 01:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:47.590 --> 01:42:47.600 align:start position:0%
there's definitely benefit for the
 
01:42:49.270 --> 01:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
double apportionment for all size
 
01:42:50.790 --> 01:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
businesses and i don't think we're
 
01:42:52.790 --> 01:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
debating that we're debating the second
 
01:42:54.310 --> 01:42:54.320 align:start position:0%
part of the bill
 
01:42:54.320 --> 01:42:55.189 align:start position:0%
part of the bill
um

01:42:55.189 --> 01:42:55.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:57.830 --> 01:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
that it appears that
 
01:42:59.910 --> 01:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
for what representative schomburg is
 
01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:00.950 align:start position:0%
for what representative schomburg is
saying

01:43:00.950 --> 01:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
saying
 
01:43:02.629 --> 01:43:02.639 align:start position:0%
is that yes there there's a lot because
 
01:43:05.109 --> 01:43:05.119 align:start position:0%
there's a lot more smaller businesses
 
01:43:07.430 --> 01:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
there that are that have their profits
 
01:43:10.310 --> 01:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
are less than a hundred hundred thousand
 
01:43:10.320 --> 01:43:11.109 align:start position:0%
are less than a hundred hundred thousand
uh

01:43:11.109 --> 01:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:43:14.550 --> 01:43:14.560 align:start position:0%
in which the tax would have to be
 
01:43:14.560 --> 01:43:16.070 align:start position:0%
in which the tax would have to be
paid

01:43:16.070 --> 01:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
paid
 
01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:18.070 align:start position:0%
paid
um

01:43:18.070 --> 01:43:18.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:20.070 --> 01:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
i don't know i i'm trying to understand
 
01:43:21.669 --> 01:43:21.679 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm trying to say
 
01:43:23.990 --> 01:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
the whole break point issue first is
 
01:43:25.910 --> 01:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
that constitutional for us to come up
 
01:43:27.270 --> 01:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
with a
 
01:43:28.950 --> 01:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
an arbitrary number
 
01:43:30.149 --> 01:43:30.159 align:start position:0%
are we treating
 
01:43:32.149 --> 01:43:32.159 align:start position:0%
that tax differently for different
 
01:43:35.350 --> 01:43:35.360 align:start position:0%
businesses is that a problem
 
01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:36.870 align:start position:0%
businesses is that a problem
um

01:43:36.870 --> 01:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:39.790 --> 01:43:39.800 align:start position:0%
gosh i would hate to wax about the
 
01:43:42.629 --> 01:43:42.639 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of that um
 
01:43:44.470 --> 01:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
but i think the one thing i would say
 
01:43:46.870 --> 01:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
was is that the conversation about
 
01:43:48.870 --> 01:43:48.880 align:start position:0%
conformity and conforming to the
 
01:43:50.629 --> 01:43:50.639 align:start position:0%
internal revenue code
 
01:43:50.639 --> 01:43:51.750 align:start position:0%
internal revenue code
um

01:43:51.750 --> 01:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:54.629 --> 01:43:54.639 align:start position:0%
is generally for sort of low impact
 
01:43:57.189 --> 01:43:57.199 align:start position:0%
changes a conversation about
 
01:44:00.070 --> 01:44:00.080 align:start position:0%
administrative ease and clarity
 
01:44:02.390 --> 01:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
and so i would suggest that perhaps
 
01:44:02.400 --> 01:44:03.510 align:start position:0%
and so i would suggest that perhaps
creating

01:44:03.510 --> 01:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
creating
 
01:44:06.629 --> 01:44:06.639 align:start position:0%
a threshold for taxpayers where the 80
 
01:44:09.590 --> 01:44:09.600 align:start position:0%
percent applies to some but not others
 
01:44:11.830 --> 01:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
may be moving in the wrong direction as
 
01:44:14.310 --> 01:44:14.320 align:start position:0%
it relates to complexity and it might
 
01:44:16.550 --> 01:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
not just be better to do nothing
 
01:44:19.350 --> 01:44:19.360 align:start position:0%
and continue to conform to an old code
 
01:44:21.510 --> 01:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
rather than conform to the new code for
 
01:44:24.149 --> 01:44:24.159 align:start position:0%
some taxpayers and the old code for
 
01:44:28.790 --> 01:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:32.390 --> 01:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
any further questions for the dra
 
01:44:35.590 --> 01:44:35.600 align:start position:0%
i do i do so if we decide to take the 80
 
01:44:38.310 --> 01:44:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:40.629 --> 01:44:40.639 align:start position:0%
from what i see from from devon we're
 
01:44:42.229 --> 01:44:42.239 align:start position:0%
talking about right now that would have
 
01:44:42.239 --> 01:44:43.109 align:start position:0%
talking about right now that would have
actually

01:44:43.109 --> 01:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:44:45.030 --> 01:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
for the first year
 
01:44:47.270 --> 01:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
would have increased taxes to the state
 
01:44:49.910 --> 01:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
by 4.5 million
 
01:44:51.669 --> 01:44:51.679 align:start position:0%
that's that's correct if you did nothing
 
01:44:54.149 --> 01:44:54.159 align:start position:0%
with conformity um you would forego that
 
01:44:55.510 --> 01:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
four and a half million dollars in
 
01:44:57.910 --> 01:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
additional revenue right
 
01:45:00.310 --> 01:45:00.320 align:start position:0%
so so that's what we're talking about
 
01:45:03.830 --> 01:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
um if we're if we if we do it the
 
01:45:05.990 --> 01:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
state's going to get 4.5 million more
 
01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:07.030 align:start position:0%
state's going to get 4.5 million more
dollars

01:45:07.030 --> 01:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:45:09.189 --> 01:45:09.199 align:start position:0%
in in the coming years
 
01:45:11.750 --> 01:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
if we if we just leave we we don't
 
01:45:14.350 --> 01:45:14.360 align:start position:0%
conform to the federal 85 percent
 
01:45:16.709 --> 01:45:16.719 align:start position:0%
then uh
 
01:45:17.590 --> 01:45:17.600 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:45:20.870 --> 01:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
then then it's the other way around
 
01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:23.109 align:start position:0%
then then it's the other way around
ah

01:45:23.109 --> 01:45:23.119 align:start position:0%
ah
 
01:45:27.109 --> 01:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
okay could i ask one more question yes
 
01:45:29.510 --> 01:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
do you remember how much
 
01:45:29.520 --> 01:45:31.109 align:start position:0%
do you remember how much
on

01:45:31.109 --> 01:45:31.119 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:45:31.119 --> 01:45:32.790 align:start position:0%
on
reducing

01:45:32.790 --> 01:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
reducing
 
01:45:36.149 --> 01:45:36.159 align:start position:0%
uh increase increasing the floor for

01:47:33.510 --> 01:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:34.870 --> 01:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
for those
 
01:47:37.109 --> 01:47:37.119 align:start position:0%
that want to work on an amendment an
 
01:47:40.550 --> 01:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
amendment is not existing right now
 
01:47:42.470 --> 01:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
we would uh
 
01:47:45.189 --> 01:47:45.199 align:start position:0%
schedule a meeting
 
01:47:48.870 --> 01:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
we have time for one more meeting
 
01:47:50.470 --> 01:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
and that would be
 
01:47:54.229 --> 01:47:54.239 align:start position:0%
if we did it would be the 27th
 
01:47:56.070 --> 01:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
of this month because i was going to do
 
01:47:58.390 --> 01:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
it on the 26th but

salem's having their election that day
 
01:48:02.470 --> 01:48:02.480 align:start position:0%

it would be the 27th
 
01:48:07.189 --> 01:48:07.199 align:start position:0%

01:53:42.070 --> 01:53:42.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:53:44.229 --> 01:53:44.239 align:start position:0%
wasn't absolutely sure that i could
 
01:53:46.870 --> 01:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
quite grasp all its nuances
 
01:53:48.950 --> 01:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
and i must say that the
 
01:53:50.950 --> 01:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
witnesses the presentations the
 
01:53:50.960 --> 01:53:52.470 align:start position:0%
witnesses the presentations the
discussion

01:53:52.470 --> 01:53:52.480 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:53:55.430 --> 01:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
i feel very comfortable now so i i think
 
01:53:55.440 --> 01:53:56.310 align:start position:0%
i feel very comfortable now so i i think
that

01:53:56.310 --> 01:53:56.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:53:57.910 --> 01:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
01:54:00.470 --> 01:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
i serve as sort of the
 
01:54:01.910 --> 01:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:54:03.350 --> 01:54:03.360 align:start position:0%
canary in the
 
01:54:04.709 --> 01:54:04.719 align:start position:0%
in the mine
 
01:54:06.310 --> 01:54:06.320 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:54:08.709 --> 01:54:08.719 align:start position:0%
i just think it's it's nice to know the
 
01:54:10.950 --> 01:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
system works that having a large group
 
01:54:12.070 --> 01:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
of people
 
01:54:14.550 --> 01:54:14.560 align:start position:0%
all of whom have different talents and
 
01:54:14.560 --> 01:54:15.830 align:start position:0%
all of whom have different talents and
experiences

01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
experiences
 
01:54:18.310 --> 01:54:18.320 align:start position:0%
does work to make it so
 
01:54:19.589 --> 01:54:19.599 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about is
 
01:54:22.070 --> 01:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
understandable yeah it's a constant
 
01:54:24.709 --> 01:54:24.719 align:start position:0%
learning process for all of us yeah we
 
01:54:27.350 --> 01:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
have lots of different talent here on
 
01:54:28.790 --> 01:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
both sides
 
01:54:31.350 --> 01:54:31.360 align:start position:0%
and i certainly appreciate that i think
 
01:54:32.950 --> 01:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
everybody else and i just wanted to
 
01:54:35.750 --> 01:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
comment on that because sometimes it
 
01:54:37.109 --> 01:54:37.119 align:start position:0%
feels like
 
01:54:39.350 --> 01:54:39.360 align:start position:0%
overwhelming a little overwhelming but
 
01:54:42.470 --> 01:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
this it does work and having
 
01:54:44.950 --> 01:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
uh people from the community
 
01:54:48.229 --> 01:54:48.239 align:start position:0%
people who are knowledgeable having dra
 
01:54:51.430 --> 01:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
it really does make it so we can
 
01:54:54.790 --> 01:54:54.800 align:start position:0%
reach an informed decision
 
01:54:56.310 --> 01:54:56.320 align:start position:0%

01:54:58.229 --> 01:54:58.239 align:start position:0%
