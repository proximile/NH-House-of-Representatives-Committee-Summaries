scholarship
 
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 align:start position:0%
program there's been some concern of why
 
00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:15.319 align:start position:0%
did education get this vers another
 
00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:17.639 align:start position:0%
committee here in the house side it was
 
00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:20.039 align:start position:0%
handed to us so very very late and it is
 
00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
an early bill it would cost a lot of
 
00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:25.960 align:start position:0%
issues if it been vacated to a we've
 
00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:28.639 align:start position:0%
already vacated several BS this year but
 
00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:30.680 align:start position:0%
we had time to do it and consider it we
 
00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:32.479 align:start position:0%
have had no time to deal it so we are
 
00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:35.240 align:start position:0%
going to address this I know Senate Ed
 
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
addressed it so I'd like to welcome uh
 
00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:40.000 align:start position:0%

legislative Aid Senator richardi wishes
 
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
she could be here today to introduce
 
00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
this important piece of legislation but
 
00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:07.479 align:start position:0%
she had a prior commitment to an event
 
00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:09.800 align:start position:0%
within her District nevertheless I'm
 
00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:11.960 align:start position:0%
here to speak on the importance of sp sp
 
00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:14.639 align:start position:0%
596 Early Childhood stakeholders came to
 
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
Senator rardy this past fall asking for
 
00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:18.520 align:start position:0%
help to address the issue of
 
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
differential payment access for Children
 
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
at Risk of of Developmental
 
00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:25.360 align:start position:0%
disability while our existing Child Care
 
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
framework provides necessary support for
 
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
children with diagnosed disabilities it
 
00:07:32.189 --> 00:07:32.199 align:start position:0%
unfortunately leaves behind those at the
 
00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
cusp of De developmental challenges
 
00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
those not yet diagnosed but showing
 
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
clear signs of being at
 
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
risk these are children who show clear
 
00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
delays in motor function speech
 
00:07:46.469 --> 00:07:46.479 align:start position:0%
cognitive play and social emotional
 
00:07:49.029 --> 00:07:49.039 align:start position:0%
development children who often later
 
00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
receive formal diagnosises for autism
 
00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:53.800 align:start position:0%
attention deficit disorder and other
 
00:07:57.390 --> 00:07:57.400 align:start position:0%
learning uh impartment uh the evidence
 
00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:00.440 align:start position:0%
is clear the earlier we identify
 
00:08:02.189 --> 00:08:02.199 align:start position:0%
intervene and support children who are
 
00:08:04.149 --> 00:08:04.159 align:start position:0%
at risk for developmental delay the
 
00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
greater the likelihood the child is to
 
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
is later able to catch up academically
 
00:08:11.309 --> 00:08:11.319 align:start position:0%
to their peers to address this issue
 
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
Senator richardi proposed SB 596 to
 
00:08:16.029 --> 00:08:16.039 align:start position:0%
expand the definition of disability
 
00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:17.800 align:start position:0%
within our child care scholarship
 
00:08:20.589 --> 00:08:20.599 align:start position:0%
program Advocates working with DHHS
 
00:08:22.909 --> 00:08:22.919 align:start position:0%
proposed an amendment to S SP 596 which
 
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
did not change the intent of s SP 596
 
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
but more efficiently outlin the process
 
00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:30.440 align:start position:0%
necessary to strengthen the differential
 
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
pain the amended version of s SP 596
 
00:08:36.269 --> 00:08:36.279 align:start position:0%
would enable DHHS to enter rul making to
 
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
Define this class of children and ensure
 
00:08:40.949 --> 00:08:40.959 align:start position:0%
the definition includes not only
 
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:43.320 align:start position:0%
children with diagnosed delay uh but
 
00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:46.240 align:start position:0%
those at high risk it would enable DHHS
 
00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
to work with experts and Advocates to
 
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
identify the proper screening tools and
 
00:08:52.389 --> 00:08:52.399 align:start position:0%
verification needed to ensure eligible
 
00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
children can get the support they need
 
00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:56.680 align:start position:0%
childcare differential payments as it
 
00:08:58.509 --> 00:08:58.519 align:start position:0%
currently exists is grossly
 
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
underutilized by by providers in part
 
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
because so few children can demonstrate
 
00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
a diagnosable disability when they're
 
00:09:08.269 --> 00:09:08.279 align:start position:0%
under the age of 3 or four this policy
 
00:09:09.949 --> 00:09:09.959 align:start position:0%
change is not only about supporting
 
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:12.040 align:start position:0%
children but also about bolstering our
 
00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
child care providers by enabling access
 
00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
to differential payments for atrisk
 
00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:19.320 align:start position:0%
children we can provide centers with the
 
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
necessary resources to maintain
 
00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:23.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate ratios and offer high
 
00:09:25.829 --> 00:09:25.839 align:start position:0%
quality Care thereby expanding access to
 
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:27.640 align:start position:0%
child care for All Families across our
 
00:09:30.389 --> 00:09:30.399 align:start position:0%
state senator rard has heard time and
 
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:32.440 align:start position:0%
time again of Provider suppressing
 
00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:34.760 align:start position:0%
ratios in classrooms because they have a
 
00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:36.720 align:start position:0%
few children requiring additional
 
00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:38.920 align:start position:0%
support with access to differential
 
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
payment centers uh differential payment
 
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
centers will be able to bring in some
 
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
additional staff capacity and classroom
 
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
support to assist in providing these
 
00:09:49.269 --> 00:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
children with the Hands-On learning
 
00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
support they need to be
 
00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:54.200 align:start position:0%
successful in conclusion this bill
 
00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:56.600 align:start position:0%
represents a strategic evidence informed
 
00:09:58.630 --> 00:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
approach to enhancing our child care
 
00:09:58.640 --> 00:09:59.829 align:start position:0%
approach to enhancing our child care
system

00:09:59.829 --> 00:09:59.839 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:01.880 align:start position:0%
it ensures that children particularly
 
00:10:04.269 --> 00:10:04.279 align:start position:0%
those at risk of Developmental delays
 
00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:06.040 align:start position:0%
receive the support they need during
 
00:10:07.509 --> 00:10:07.519 align:start position:0%
their most formative
 
00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:09.560 align:start position:0%
years I urge the members of this
 
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:10.920 align:start position:0%

director at new Futures new Futures is a

nonpartisan nonprofit organization
 
00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
working to improve the health and
 
00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
wellbeing of New Hampshire's residents
 
00:11:57.310 --> 00:11:57.320 align:start position:0%
through policy change and I focus on our
 
00:11:59.710 --> 00:11:59.720 align:start position:0%
tiniest residents our children as New
 
00:12:01.069 --> 00:12:01.079 align:start position:0%

00:12:03.509 --> 00:12:03.519 align:start position:0%
organization new futur also advocates
 
00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:05.240 align:start position:0%
for databased policies to support
 
00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
granted State families I'm here today to
 
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:10.720 align:start position:0%
speak in favor of Senate Bill 596 as
 
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
it's an important bill in our state's
 
00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:13.880 align:start position:0%
effort to address and alleviate the
 
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:16.160 align:start position:0%
child care crisis Phil did a really good
 
00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:18.680 align:start position:0%
job introducing this bill so I'm just
 
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
going to highlight a couple of points
 
00:12:23.189 --> 00:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
number one as mentioned uh this bill
 
00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
does not um address anything relative to
 
00:12:28.629 --> 00:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
K through 12 education it is primarily
 
00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
and solely focused on our child care
 
00:12:33.389 --> 00:12:33.399 align:start position:0%
scholarship program which is supported
 
00:12:36.069 --> 00:12:36.079 align:start position:0%
by the child care development block
 
00:12:39.069 --> 00:12:39.079 align:start position:0%
grant I will also say that for the past
 
00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
two years new Futures has convened a
 
00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:43.480 align:start position:0%
broad group of stakeholders to identify
 
00:12:45.269 --> 00:12:45.279 align:start position:0%
pressing issues facing childcare
 
00:12:47.629 --> 00:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
providers teachers and families in order
 
00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:50.440 align:start position:0%
to identify and craft important policy
 
00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:53.480 align:start position:0%
Solutions one of the clear issues that
 
00:12:55.829 --> 00:12:55.839 align:start position:0%
um has arisen is the fact that children
 
00:12:57.870 --> 00:12:57.880 align:start position:0%
who are displaying more complex uh
 
00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
social and emotional Behavior aval needs
 
00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
are often struggling to find access to
 
00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:05.800 align:start position:0%
child care and that is because um there
 
00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
are limited resources for kids who do
 
00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:11.480 align:start position:0%
not have a diagnosed disability it is
 
00:13:13.949 --> 00:13:13.959 align:start position:0%
also very hard to diagnose a young child
 
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
with a disability so we are in this
 
00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
space where there are lots of Children
 
00:13:20.189 --> 00:13:20.199 align:start position:0%
at Risk but we don't have the necessary
 
00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:22.040 align:start position:0%
supports within our system to ensure
 
00:13:25.189 --> 00:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
they have access to child care and this
 
00:13:27.509 --> 00:13:27.519 align:start position:0%
is shown number one not only through um
 
00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:29.560 align:start position:0%
anecdotal stories but the but the fact
 
00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:31.720 align:start position:0%
that our utilization of this child care
 
00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
differential is really low what happens
 
00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
is that there is either a suppression of
 
00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:40.600 align:start position:0%
ratios in child care centers far below
 
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
license capacity this is to allow
 
00:13:44.389 --> 00:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
teachers and providers to be able to
 
00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
manage class rooms with high needs
 
00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
children or children who are at risk of
 
00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
developmental delay or disability cannot
 
00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:51.720 align:start position:0%
find centers which are willing or
 
00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:54.440 align:start position:0%
equipped to take care of them so to
 
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
address this issue s SP 596 proposes a
 
00:13:59.230 --> 00:13:59.240 align:start position:0%
modification of the definition of
 
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
disability to allow for these
 
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
differential payments um to centers with
 
00:14:05.949 --> 00:14:05.959 align:start position:0%
children who are screening high risk for
 
00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
developmental um delay or
 
00:14:10.509 --> 00:14:10.519 align:start position:0%
disability the differential payment is
 
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:13.880 align:start position:0%
only $100 a week but from our um
 
00:14:15.629 --> 00:14:15.639 align:start position:0%
feedback from providers this really
 
00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:17.800 align:start position:0%
would be a critical payment for them to
 
00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:20.600 align:start position:0%
be able to um employ classroom based
 
00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
approaches to ensure that those kiddos
 
00:14:24.629 --> 00:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
are receiving services in classrooms
 
00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
with um other peers and not just
 
00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:29.320 align:start position:0%
receiving Services outside of the class
 
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
room I want to address the uh question
 
00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:34.720 align:start position:0%
from the representative on what does it
 
00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:37.000 align:start position:0%
mean to be at risk that really is a
 
00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:39.160 align:start position:0%
clinical definition in early childhood
 
00:14:41.629 --> 00:14:41.639 align:start position:0%
we do develop not me but providers do
 
00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
developmental screening which show that
 
00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:47.320 align:start position:0%
kids um on a raing scale either have a
 
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
developmental delay or disability or
 
00:14:51.949 --> 00:14:51.959 align:start position:0%
they're at high risk and that is really
 
00:14:53.829 --> 00:14:53.839 align:start position:0%
because there are many Early Childhood
 
00:14:56.389 --> 00:14:56.399 align:start position:0%
interventions that can help prevent that
 
00:14:59.550 --> 00:14:59.560 align:start position:0%
delay to um becoming a fullblown delay
 
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
or disability or ensure that that child
 
00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
is on a path to um full and happy
 
00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
development so when we think of things
 
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
like that that's like a speech
 
00:15:09.949 --> 00:15:09.959 align:start position:0%
impediment or speech delay a fine motor
 
00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
skill so it's at risk meaning that
 
00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:14.720 align:start position:0%
without intervention that can worsen but
 
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
um at risk does not mean every single
 
00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
child there would be a screening tool
 
00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:20.240 align:start position:0%
that would identify those
 
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
children questions from the commit thank
 
00:15:24.069 --> 00:15:24.079 align:start position:0%
you questions from the committee yes
 
00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:26.240 align:start position:0%
represent Woodcock good morning thank
 
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
you for being here uh just a question un
 
00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:30.680 align:start position:0%
sure you have the answer probably guess
 
00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
you do I'm looking on line 20 on the uh
 
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh Bill and it talks about on the bill
 
00:15:40.509 --> 00:15:40.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:43.069 --> 00:15:43.079 align:start position:0%
you thank just caught you off got the
 
00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:45.160 align:start position:0%
first question no that's fine I got it
 
00:15:48.189 --> 00:15:48.199 align:start position:0%
thank you um line 20 and one on the
 
00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
first page it talks about or other
 
00:15:52.069 --> 00:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
approved licensed professional yeah do
 
00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
you know what that means I don't so that
 
00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
would be as I said a um certified
 
00:15:59.269 --> 00:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
occupational speech therapist or other
 
00:16:01.309 --> 00:16:01.319 align:start position:0%
type of Early Childhood trained
 
00:16:03.389 --> 00:16:03.399 align:start position:0%
professional that is used to working
 
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
with young children to help them
 
00:16:07.309 --> 00:16:07.319 align:start position:0%
overcome their um delays okay thank you
 
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
so much you're welcome thank you I I
 
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
have one question first here uh we
 
00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
oftentimes deal with uh students
 
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
children that are ages three through
 
00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:17.720 align:start position:0%
five very rarely do we ever go down
 
00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
below that age that's really the domain
 
00:16:23.269 --> 00:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
of HHS y
 
00:16:25.829 --> 00:16:25.839 align:start position:0%
um you're you're talking here about
 
00:16:28.389 --> 00:16:28.399 align:start position:0%
students in which age bracket this would
 
00:16:31.189 --> 00:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
be um any child who is old enough to
 
00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:33.160 align:start position:0%
enter um a child care center so that
 
00:16:37.509 --> 00:16:37.519 align:start position:0%
could be a infant all the way through
 
00:16:40.189 --> 00:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
age5 okay so I do have a followup on
 
00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:42.920 align:start position:0%
that then uh I'm I always look at the
 
00:16:44.389 --> 00:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
bottom the
 
00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:48.440 align:start position:0%
appropriation and there was a line or
 
00:16:51.629 --> 00:16:51.639 align:start position:0%
two put in dealing from the Senate that
 
00:16:55.069 --> 00:16:55.079 align:start position:0%
if oura money is available if other
 
00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079 align:start position:0%
federal funds are available we we talk
 
00:17:00.629 --> 00:17:00.639 align:start position:0%
about 375 ,000 there then they put in
 
00:17:04.429 --> 00:17:04.439 align:start position:0%
the $1 um can you talk to that a little
 
00:17:07.909 --> 00:17:07.919 align:start position:0%
bit yes so um during discussions with
 
00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:10.079 align:start position:0%
the Senate there was some concerns
 
00:17:12.669 --> 00:17:12.679 align:start position:0%
around March revenues but the Senators
 
00:17:14.429 --> 00:17:14.439 align:start position:0%
identified this as an important priority
 
00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:16.120 align:start position:0%
and wanted to carry the conversation
 
00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
forward into the house so our
 
00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
understanding is that um this would be a
 
00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
discussion for finance to determine
 
00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:24.520 align:start position:0%
whether or not there's flexibility in
 
00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
existing funding or other sources to be
 
00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
able to support this policy change thank
 
00:17:31.029 --> 00:17:31.039 align:start position:0%
you better be prepared because I've seen
 
00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:32.240 align:start position:0%
several other bills come in with the
 
00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
same language Che uh going forward to
 
00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:37.160 align:start position:0%
representative Damon and then represent
 
00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
belch thank you Mr chair good morning
 
00:17:42.029 --> 00:17:42.039 align:start position:0%
and thank you for being here um so I
 
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
have a background question and then
 
00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:47.240 align:start position:0%
probably a followup could you just tell
 
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
us a little bit more about the basis of
 
00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
the child care scholarship program just
 
00:17:57.149 --> 00:17:57.159 align:start position:0%
a broad picture of it please sure so um
 
00:17:58.909 --> 00:17:58.919 align:start position:0%
the childcare scholarship program is
 
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
supported primarily through our
 
00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
childcare development block grant which
 
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
is a federal block grant which allows
 
00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
the state to create a subsidy program to
 
00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:10.799 align:start position:0%
help lowincome Working Families access
 
00:18:14.029 --> 00:18:14.039 align:start position:0%
child care so based on income and
 
00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:16.360 align:start position:0%
enrollment a child care center will
 
00:18:18.549 --> 00:18:18.559 align:start position:0%
receive a certain amount of funds to
 
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
offset the cost of child care for
 
00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
low-income families so the childcare um
 
00:18:25.789 --> 00:18:25.799 align:start position:0%
scholarship program doesn't go to
 
00:18:27.789 --> 00:18:27.799 align:start position:0%
families it goes to Providers and it
 
00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
allows low-income families to be able to
 
00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:32.360 align:start position:0%
access Child Care given if you've heard
 
00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:34.520 align:start position:0%
probably many times the extreme costs of
 
00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:36.669 align:start position:0%
probably many times the extreme costs of
child

00:18:36.669 --> 00:18:36.679 align:start position:0%
child
 
00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
care follow up thank you and thank you
 
00:18:43.909 --> 00:18:43.919 align:start position:0%
so in your written testimony you note
 
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:46.720 align:start position:0%
that the Child Care Program currently
 
00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
provides differential payments if the
 
00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:51.320 align:start position:0%
children have a formal diagnosis of a
 
00:18:55.789 --> 00:18:55.799 align:start position:0%
disability of $100 per week so that's in
 
00:18:55.799 --> 00:18:56.950 align:start position:0%
disability of $100 per week so that's in
addition

00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
addition
 
00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
to the child care scholarship that any
 
00:19:01.909 --> 00:19:01.919 align:start position:0%
uh low-income child might be eligible
 
00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:03.880 align:start position:0%
for is that correct correct so that
 
00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:06.200 align:start position:0%
would in fact in effect be if you had a
 
00:19:09.669 --> 00:19:09.679 align:start position:0%
family receiving you know $150 towards
 
00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:12.520 align:start position:0%
their um Child Care each week and that
 
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
child had a diagnosed disability that
 
00:19:17.149 --> 00:19:17.159 align:start position:0%
Center would receive an extra $100 for
 
00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:19.720 align:start position:0%
that child and it is in recognition that
 
00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
children with high needs or disabilities
 
00:19:23.789 --> 00:19:23.799 align:start position:0%
need different types of supports within
 
00:19:26.549 --> 00:19:26.559 align:start position:0%
the child care
 
00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
setting Bel no come back to than you Mr
 
00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:32.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Sher uh and thank you for
 
00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
being here to take these questions um
 
00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
I'd like to get a little bit deeper into
 
00:19:38.909 --> 00:19:38.919 align:start position:0%
the issue of identifying uh students
 
00:19:42.149 --> 00:19:42.159 align:start position:0%
with um with disabilities as as as far
 
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
as it says those who are risk for and
 
00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that there are clinical
 
00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:47.400 align:start position:0%
guidelines for that so I'm curious would
 
00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:49.480 align:start position:0%
would a portion any portion of that
 
00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
clinical guidelines include Aces or
 
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
adverse childhood event scoring I can't
 
00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
speak exactly to that um the traditional
 
00:19:58.750 --> 00:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
there are a number of authorized
 
00:20:02.909 --> 00:20:02.919 align:start position:0%
National screening tools um their ages
 
00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
and stages questionnaire is the number
 
00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
one that we use but I can't say whether
 
00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:09.640 align:start position:0%
or not there's a child specific Aces
 
00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
screening tool I think that that um the
 
00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:16.520 align:start position:0%
impact of Aces is often shown in the de
 
00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
development of children so you would see
 
00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
it that way but I can't speak to whether
 
00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:21.960 align:start position:0%
or not there's a specific Asus screening
 
00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:24.520 align:start position:0%
tool that would be valid so one thing I
 
00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
want to emphasize is that um there are
 
00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:28.799 align:start position:0%
federal guidelines about what we can
 
00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
cannot do with childcare scholarship
 
00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
funds so the amendment is written to not
 
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
identify specific screening tools
 
00:20:39.029 --> 00:20:39.039 align:start position:0%
because the screening tools change and
 
00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:41.080 align:start position:0%
they need to me meet certain state and
 
00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
federal guidelines and also we want to
 
00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
give DHHS the difference to ensure that
 
00:20:48.549 --> 00:20:48.559 align:start position:0%
those were the best tools also in here
 
00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
is a need to do verification so if
 
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
there's an ages and stages questionnaire
 
00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
done at a child care center before a
 
00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
child is enrolled and that indicates
 
00:20:59.590 --> 00:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
there's a high risk of developmental
 
00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:01.880 align:start position:0%
delay that would have to be verified by
 
00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:04.440 align:start position:0%
a licensed professional so just to give
 
00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
a little bit more context of what needs
 
00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:07.990 align:start position:0%
a little bit more context of what needs
to

00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:11.720 align:start position:0%
happen if if I may just a yes thank you
 
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
um so one of the reasons I I wanted to
 
00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:16.840 align:start position:0%
get deeper into this is is because these
 
00:21:18.269 --> 00:21:18.279 align:start position:0%
services that are offered to various
 
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
students now they're certainly needed by
 
00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
some students but they're not they do
 
00:21:23.549 --> 00:21:23.559 align:start position:0%
have the potential to be harmful if
 
00:21:24.669 --> 00:21:24.679 align:start position:0%
they're offered if they're given to
 
00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
students who don't necessarily need them
 
00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
um now at least we have if we have a
 
00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
diagnosis we have some level of
 
00:21:33.029 --> 00:21:33.039 align:start position:0%
certitude that that these services are
 
00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
actually necessary but without a
 
00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
diagnosis should we have concerns about
 
00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:39.320 align:start position:0%
the risk of introducing these potential
 
00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
treatments and other things to students
 
00:21:44.149 --> 00:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
so I think um sorry to interrupt but I
 
00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
think the clarification here is the
 
00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:47.320 align:start position:0%
child care center is not offering a
 
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
treatment we're supporting the child
 
00:21:51.269 --> 00:21:51.279 align:start position:0%
care center to have additional capacity
 
00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
to keep those kids within their Center
 
00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:55.400 align:start position:0%
so one thing we heard is a number of
 
00:21:57.390 --> 00:21:57.400 align:start position:0%
children who have more complex
 
00:21:59.950 --> 00:21:59.960 align:start position:0%
developmental chall Alles are being
 
00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
kicked out of child care because
 
00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:04.120 align:start position:0%
childcare Centers do not have the
 
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
Staffing or training or expertise to be
 
00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
able to ensure those kids um can stay
 
00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
there and that in part has to do with
 
00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:14.120 align:start position:0%
the pressures on the child care centers
 
00:22:16.669 --> 00:22:16.679 align:start position:0%
the long weight lists so to take in a
 
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
child that is more complex but could
 
00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
benefit from being around their peers
 
00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:22.840 align:start position:0%
Child Care Centers have to suppress the
 
00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
number of other children that they can
 
00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:26.440 align:start position:0%
have in the classroom and that's just
 
00:22:29.269 --> 00:22:29.279 align:start position:0%
because the child demands more um from
 
00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:31.480 align:start position:0%
the center itself so I want to clarify
 
00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:33.880 align:start position:0%
that this bill does not create a
 
00:22:36.149 --> 00:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
treatment for kiddos it allows that
 
00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:37.880 align:start position:0%
Center to hire a pair professional to
 
00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
come in to support the teacher it helps
 
00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:43.720 align:start position:0%
them to um uh purchase classroom based
 
00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
programs or initiatives that may help um
 
00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
bolster the Child Care Center's ability
 
00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:53.000 align:start position:0%
to take in a diverse um type of uh
 
00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
children just a a followup to what you
 
00:22:56.549 --> 00:22:56.559 align:start position:0%
were saying and then I'll go back to
 
00:22:59.190 --> 00:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
represent Damon then represent uh or
 
00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
beside me um the difference between
 
00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:05.080 align:start position:0%
student and children I don't want to mix
 
00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:07.480 align:start position:0%
and match these terminologies here we
 
00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
have students in grades K through 12 but
 
00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
we also deal with child F early in three
 
00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:17.080 align:start position:0%
three through five ages below age three
 
00:23:19.149 --> 00:23:19.159 align:start position:0%
we're not talking students are we so we
 
00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:21.400 align:start position:0%
need to get that clarified Y and I will
 
00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:23.960 align:start position:0%
say that um for that Age 3 to 5 child
 
00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
find is a great resource but often those
 
00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
Services may not be done in the
 
00:23:30.149 --> 00:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
classroom with peers or the child is
 
00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
offsite and so this is really about how
 
00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
do you equip a child care center to be
 
00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:36.200 align:start position:0%
in a better position to take all kids or
 
00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
consider all kids because the reality
 
00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:40.799 align:start position:0%
right now is that many centers based on
 
00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:42.200 align:start position:0%
the pressures on our child care system
 
00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire are not taking these
 
00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:47.320 align:start position:0%
children in and it is creating not only
 
00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
a burden on the workforce but on
 
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
families when you cannot find a child
 
00:23:52.549 --> 00:23:52.559 align:start position:0%
care center that you know your child
 
00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
will be safe at and be supported at and
 
00:23:58.549 --> 00:23:58.559 align:start position:0%
I do not um you know pass judgment on
 
00:24:00.269 --> 00:24:00.279 align:start position:0%
Child Care Centers because it is a lack
 
00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
of capacity it is a lack of funding and
 
00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
although this is a small amount we have
 
00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
heard from centers it would be extremely
 
00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
helpful um in their ability to and
 
00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
desire to serve all children in this
 
00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
state thank you representative Damon and
 
00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:16.720 align:start position:0%
then represent dry thank you Mr chair
 
00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:18.440 align:start position:0%
and thank you again and then I'll come
 
00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:20.440 align:start position:0%
down could you speak
 
00:24:26.669 --> 00:24:26.679 align:start position:0%
to um the results of facilitating a
 
00:24:28.549 --> 00:24:28.559 align:start position:0%
child's developmentally appr apprpriate
 
00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:32.320 align:start position:0%
Care at a younger age in terms of their
 
00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:34.120 align:start position:0%
capabilities going forward what is
 
00:24:35.669 --> 00:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
likely to happen and I know that's a
 
00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:38.840 align:start position:0%
broad question um I can provide more
 
00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
specific details on the return on
 
00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
investment um around early intervention
 
00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:46.760 align:start position:0%
and um children being able to be um in
 
00:24:49.389 --> 00:24:49.399 align:start position:0%
child care and going back to Aces we
 
00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:51.640 align:start position:0%
know that one of the major interventions
 
00:24:53.669 --> 00:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
in a positive way for children who have
 
00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:55.880 align:start position:0%
experienced adversity and have a high
 
00:24:59.310 --> 00:24:59.320 align:start position:0%
Asis score is high quality child care so
 
00:25:01.549 --> 00:25:01.559 align:start position:0%
being in situations where there are
 
00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:04.200 align:start position:0%
strong serve and return relationships
 
00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
that help that brain architecture
 
00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
results in lots of savings not only to
 
00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:10.720 align:start position:0%
the state but also in that child's life
 
00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:12.200 align:start position:0%
being able to build that strong
 
00:25:16.029 --> 00:25:16.039 align:start position:0%
foundation so that they can be a um a
 
00:25:18.149 --> 00:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
hardworking member of you know New
 
00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's future so it's an important
 
00:25:23.029 --> 00:25:23.039 align:start position:0%
investment PR and dry thank you and
 
00:25:25.029 --> 00:25:25.039 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question in my
 
00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:28.760 align:start position:0%
own Hometown we have a variety of Child
 
00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
Care situations there are people that do
 
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
it in their home there is a a a business
 
00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:37.640 align:start position:0%
that uses a building in town and now
 
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
there's talk of pre at the school are
 
00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
all those varieties eligible for the
 
00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund yeah that's one of the
 
00:25:46.269 --> 00:25:46.279 align:start position:0%
most wonderful things about our child
 
00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:48.200 align:start position:0%
care scholarship program is that it
 
00:25:50.789 --> 00:25:50.799 align:start position:0%
allows child care to be in lots of
 
00:25:52.909 --> 00:25:52.919 align:start position:0%
licensed settings so that can be a home
 
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
setting that can be a a faith-based
 
00:25:57.310 --> 00:25:57.320 align:start position:0%
setting that can be a child care center
 
00:25:59.269 --> 00:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
so at the core of it really is um
 
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
parental choice and that where do you
 
00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
want your kid to be best be served based
 
00:26:06.789 --> 00:26:06.799 align:start position:0%
on your values and systems and um
 
00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
community so again this bill would also
 
00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
provide that support to those centers as
 
00:26:15.389 --> 00:26:15.399 align:start position:0%
long as they are accepting um of they
 
00:26:16.549 --> 00:26:16.559 align:start position:0%
participate in our child care
 
00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:18.520 align:start position:0%
scholarship program and the child in
 
00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
question qualifies for child care
 
00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:23.039 align:start position:0%
scholarship so again this is a program
 
00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:25.240 align:start position:0%
that is aimed at lowincome working New
 
00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:27.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire families represent Miler and
 
00:26:30.909 --> 00:26:30.919 align:start position:0%
then represent uh Pell thank you Mr
 
00:26:32.909 --> 00:26:32.919 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for being here you
 
00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned the uh issue again of lowi
 
00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
income it's interesting this is kind of
 
00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:40.120 align:start position:0%
a new new uh area for us we usually
 
00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
dealing with kids either either prek or
 
00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
not this young of a child so the
 
00:26:46.909 --> 00:26:46.919 align:start position:0%
question I have you you mentioned low
 
00:26:49.909 --> 00:26:49.919 align:start position:0%
income could you define low income and
 
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:52.720 align:start position:0%
also is there an annual recertification
 
00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
of the families to be able to
 
00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
participate in this program thank you
 
00:26:58.470 --> 00:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
yes and that's a great question um
 
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
through bipartisan efforts last year
 
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
this legislature um modified what low
 
00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
income was so right now the cap is 85%
 
00:27:09.549 --> 00:27:09.559 align:start position:0%
of State median income at that point and
 
00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:11.720 align:start position:0%
above you don't qualify for scholarship
 
00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
any longer and um the amount of your
 
00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:17.960 align:start position:0%
scholarship is based on steps um that
 
00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:19.960 align:start position:0%
are determined by your family's income
 
00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:22.600 align:start position:0%
and size so it's variable I can provide
 
00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
you all with some background so you have
 
00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
Clarity on exactly how much those income
 
00:27:28.389 --> 00:27:28.399 align:start position:0%
brackets are I don't remember the off
 
00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
the top of my head so it is based on um
 
00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
family size and income with a cap and
 
00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
there is annual recertification just
 
00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:40.440 align:start position:0%
like any other program you're
 
00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
welcome represent pet now thank you and
 
00:27:45.789 --> 00:27:45.799 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here and taking my
 
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
question can you um give me an example
 
00:27:49.789 --> 00:27:49.799 align:start position:0%
of some of the children who might be
 
00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:51.480 align:start position:0%
turned away from these Child Care
 
00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:55.240 align:start position:0%
settings yeah so um in my testimony and
 
00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
I think Senator rardy it's children who
 
00:28:01.789 --> 00:28:01.799 align:start position:0%
may um be presenting with um ADHD or
 
00:28:04.149 --> 00:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
hyperactivity or Autism but they have
 
00:28:06.149 --> 00:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
not yet been screened by child fine
 
00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
because they're not three um and they
 
00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:10.200 align:start position:0%
may not have had a formal diagnosis for
 
00:28:13.509 --> 00:28:13.519 align:start position:0%
a number of reasons um it also can be uh
 
00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
individuals who are new to this country
 
00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:18.200 align:start position:0%
and they do not speak English yet and so
 
00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
it is very difficult for them to
 
00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
assimilate and we do not have the
 
00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
training or capacity within the staff to
 
00:28:27.149 --> 00:28:27.159 align:start position:0%
be able to provide those um supports it
 
00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
also can be kids who experienced um
 
00:28:32.509 --> 00:28:32.519 align:start position:0%
complex trauma so children that have
 
00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:34.120 align:start position:0%
been in the foster care system that are
 
00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
now um you know at the point of living
 
00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:38.600 align:start position:0%
in a safe and stable environment and
 
00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
they're being introduced into child care
 
00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
and they have many Behavioral Health
 
00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
needs that cannot be that aren't
 
00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
diagnosed or addressed um in traditional
 
00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:49.480 align:start position:0%
means thank you very much represent
 
00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
cascaden thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:28:55.389 --> 00:28:55.399 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um so do you have
 
00:28:58.590 --> 00:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
any insight on why it sounds like there
 
00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
is um a need obviously in the early
 
00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
child in the child care setting for more
 
00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:07.640 align:start position:0%
support or more assistance have you got
 
00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:10.440 align:start position:0%
any insight on why that is
 
00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
so that's a complicated question um you
 
00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
all are very used to uh focusing on K
 
00:29:17.669 --> 00:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
through 12 and the first thing I'll say
 
00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
is our child care system doesn't have um
 
00:29:23.509 --> 00:29:23.519 align:start position:0%
a a subsidy that is for every child
 
00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
there are not requirements that young
 
00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:28.200 align:start position:0%
children from you know birth through
 
00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:33.320 align:start position:0%
age3 receive uh uh special services u
 
00:29:35.509 --> 00:29:35.519 align:start position:0%
based on their diagnosis often that is
 
00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:37.640 align:start position:0%
determined whether or not the family has
 
00:29:39.789 --> 00:29:39.799 align:start position:0%
adequate access to health care and there
 
00:29:41.669 --> 00:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
are other um social barriers whether it
 
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
is financial so these children um are
 
00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
not in the same system as K to2 and
 
00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
there are many gaps in funding and
 
00:29:50.669 --> 00:29:50.679 align:start position:0%
support our child care system is
 
00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:53.240 align:start position:0%
tuition-based so um there are many
 
00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
market dynamics within our um child care
 
00:29:58.789 --> 00:29:58.799 align:start position:0%
system that the expectations are similar
 
00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
through K through 12 but the funding
 
00:30:02.789 --> 00:30:02.799 align:start position:0%
streams are not which is why looking at
 
00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:04.760 align:start position:0%
our child care development block grant
 
00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
is so crucial how are we maximizing
 
00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:09.240 align:start position:0%
those federal dollars to ensure that
 
00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
we're really helping our low-income
 
00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:14.360 align:start position:0%
working families and their
 
00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:17.640 align:start position:0%
children further questions represent
 
00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:19.720 align:start position:0%
whitcock thank you again for taking my
 
00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:22.760 align:start position:0%
question um in the child care block
 
00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
grant program now about how many
 
00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:28.840 align:start position:0%
youngsters are being serviced
 
00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:31.720 align:start position:0%
I do not want guess between five and
 
00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:35.080 align:start position:0%
6,000 wow okay and I should also note
 
00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:38.840 align:start position:0%
there are some um there are traditional
 
00:30:40.029 --> 00:30:40.039 align:start position:0%
children and then there are children who
 
00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
are protective and pro protective and
 
00:30:45.789 --> 00:30:45.799 align:start position:0%
preventative um who access Child Care um
 
00:30:47.789 --> 00:30:47.799 align:start position:0%
if they are in the um our child
 
00:30:47.799 --> 00:30:49.269 align:start position:0%
if they are in the um our child
protection

00:30:49.269 --> 00:30:49.279 align:start position:0%
protection
 
00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:52.360 align:start position:0%
system than can just final question I'm
 
00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
going back to follow up on what
 
00:30:55.269 --> 00:30:55.279 align:start position:0%
representative lad asked a minute ago
 
00:30:57.269 --> 00:30:57.279 align:start position:0%
about the funding piece I want to make
 
00:30:59.269 --> 00:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
sure I understood correctly what this
 
00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:01.480 align:start position:0%
says um when I'm looking at the end of
 
00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:05.320 align:start position:0%
the bill 29 and and then on page uh 2
 
00:31:08.389 --> 00:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
one two and three am I to interpret
 
00:31:11.509 --> 00:31:11.519 align:start position:0%
particularly on page two the line one
 
00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:15.240 align:start position:0%
that actual State
 
00:31:18.549 --> 00:31:18.559 align:start position:0%
funds is going to be no ma no more than
 
00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
$1 that is what was um so this is so
 
00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:24.360 align:start position:0%
this is really not a state taxpayer fund
 
00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:25.720 align:start position:0%
this is this is a redistribution of
 
00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:28.600 align:start position:0%
federal money and how it goes I will
 
00:31:29.909 --> 00:31:29.919 align:start position:0%
leave that question hopefully for
 
00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
finance but there is some Nuance around
 
00:31:34.549 --> 00:31:34.559 align:start position:0%
um figuring out how we fund this both
 
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
maximizing what we have for our
 
00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
childcare scholarship and minimizing our
 
00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
state fund appropriation okay thank you
 
00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
so much you're welcome just a followup
 
00:31:44.549 --> 00:31:44.559 align:start position:0%
uh regarding Medicaid we have Medicaid
 
00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
to for the schools we work with
 
00:31:51.549 --> 00:31:51.559 align:start position:0%
HHS does that Medicaid do offer any
 
00:31:54.389 --> 00:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
support down on age three
 
00:32:00.029 --> 00:32:00.039 align:start position:0%
to less so this is a um complicated area
 
00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
and yes if a child has a diagnosed
 
00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
disability Medicaid will pay for certain
 
00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
interventions however those
 
00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
interventions cannot be classroom based
 
00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
so really when you're looking at helping
 
00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
a child in that zero to three age you
 
00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
have to have a matrix of different
 
00:32:19.789 --> 00:32:19.799 align:start position:0%
funding streams and types of services I
 
00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
think one of the the largest gaps is the
 
00:32:26.669 --> 00:32:26.679 align:start position:0%
idea that how do we keep children in uh
 
00:32:28.549 --> 00:32:28.559 align:start position:0%
rooms with other children because we
 
00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
know how important that is this bill
 
00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:34.200 align:start position:0%
provides a small um differential to
 
00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
allow those classroom based approaches
 
00:32:37.669 --> 00:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
whether it's supporting the teacher or
 
00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:40.120 align:start position:0%
the child specifically um the ways in
 
00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
which we can support young children 0 to
 
00:32:44.549 --> 00:32:44.559 align:start position:0%
three through Medicaid are very very
 
00:32:48.269 --> 00:32:48.279 align:start position:0%
limited and they are not conducive or um
 
00:32:50.149 --> 00:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
they don't really support uh child care
 
00:32:51.909 --> 00:32:51.919 align:start position:0%
as a whole and the child care provider
 
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
often can't be the one because those are
 
00:32:55.789 --> 00:32:55.799 align:start position:0%
more interventions and treatments they
 
00:32:58.669 --> 00:32:58.679 align:start position:0%
are not um classroom based support
 
00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
and a follow-up question I noticed that
 
00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
the effective date on this is January 1
 
00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
2025 are you working on the annual year
 
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year and and uh there's also
 
00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
rule making in here as well is that all
 
00:33:15.789 --> 00:33:15.799 align:start position:0%
attached somehow yes so the um effective
 
00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
date is there to give DHHS time to
 
00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:21.880 align:start position:0%
engage into rule making so that um it
 
00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:23.480 align:start position:0%
can be effectively rolled out at that
 
00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:26.840 align:start position:0%
time and six months is enough time that
 
00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:29.519 align:start position:0%
is what um DHHS and I discussed and
 
00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
seems like would' be ample time for this
 
00:33:33.029 --> 00:33:33.039 align:start position:0%
thank you are there further questions
 
00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:34.720 align:start position:0%
from the committee yes representative
 
00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you and thank you
 
00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:40.840 align:start position:0%
again would it be correct to uh
 
00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:44.440 align:start position:0%
recognize that helping the students who
 
00:33:48.149 --> 00:33:48.159 align:start position:0%
would qualify under this proposal to be
 
00:33:51.549 --> 00:33:51.559 align:start position:0%
in a normal child care setting is also
 
00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
good for the other children there
 
00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
yes further questions thank you very
 
00:33:59.269 --> 00:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
much Rebecca you're welcome thank you
 
00:34:01.389 --> 00:34:01.399 align:start position:0%
you're welcome uh I'd like to invite
 
00:34:01.399 --> 00:34:13.750 align:start position:0%
you're welcome uh I'd like to invite
Kathy

00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
Holmes good morning there there you go
 
00:34:18.909 --> 00:34:18.919 align:start position:0%
yes Kathy Holmes one thing I did remind
 
00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
have been asked by the committee we have
 
00:34:23.589 --> 00:34:23.599 align:start position:0%
some Ren renovation or not renovation
 
00:34:25.990 --> 00:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
destruction going across the street here
 
00:34:27.869 --> 00:34:27.879 align:start position:0%
and it gets noisy at times so when there
 
00:34:29.869 --> 00:34:29.879 align:start position:0%
are people speaking can you speak really
 
00:34:31.629 --> 00:34:31.639 align:start position:0%
closely to the mic so all can hear
 
00:34:32.629 --> 00:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
especially that side of the room they're
 
00:34:37.149 --> 00:34:37.159 align:start position:0%
having difficulty okay Kathy Holmes Chai
 
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
Chester um I just got this bill last
 
00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
night this isn't the bill but this was
 
00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
my testimony and listening I've been
 
00:34:48.909 --> 00:34:48.919 align:start position:0%
altering it so you see I I'm
 
00:34:50.909 --> 00:34:50.919 align:start position:0%
understanding more about the bill even
 
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
now um my career has been in teaching
 
00:34:58.910 --> 00:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
for 40 years and
 
00:35:04.589 --> 00:35:04.599 align:start position:0%
um I um my view is that the the
 
00:35:07.349 --> 00:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
Democrats well no I won't start with
 
00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
that I'll go with
 
00:35:12.430 --> 00:35:12.440 align:start position:0%
um well the Democrats do have a Playbook
 
00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
and this is what I saw in all my years
 
00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
identify more learning disability
 
00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
problems learning um difficulties and
 
00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:23.880 align:start position:0%
you get more budget you get bigger they
 
00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:25.270 align:start position:0%
you get more budget you get bigger they
want

00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
want
 
00:35:29.109 --> 00:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
more control and more
 
00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
um more rule I'm sorry um but the
 
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
Playbook that I saw then is is in this
 
00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:42.200 align:start position:0%
bill too it's at the root it's expanding
 
00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
the money they
 
00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:46.520 align:start position:0%
get and
 
00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
um this bill is rushed there's another
 
00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
tactic that they use I'm sorry that um
 
00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
some Republican friends have joined in
 
00:35:59.589 --> 00:35:59.599 align:start position:0%
on this on this bill but there's a red
 
00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
flag too whenever a republican agrees
 
00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:05.400 align:start position:0%
with a Democrat Sailors take
 
00:36:09.069 --> 00:36:09.079 align:start position:0%
warning um yeah yes I hear you represent
 
00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:11.240 align:start position:0%
luno I would appreciate that we're not
 
00:36:13.309 --> 00:36:13.319 align:start position:0%
going to be critical either Democrats or
 
00:36:15.589 --> 00:36:15.599 align:start position:0%
Republicans in here this has
 
00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
co-sponsorship on that bill if we look
 
00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:21.880 align:start position:0%
at it Prime sponsor yeah I got it I got
 
00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
it so we're not going to do any more of
 
00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
this one way or the other Mr chair point
 
00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:27.640 align:start position:0%
of order can we point to Any House rule
 
00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
would prohibit a member of the public
 
00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
from speaking freely in this committee
 
00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
representative I am speaking right now
 
00:36:35.309 --> 00:36:35.319 align:start position:0%
to everybody here we're not going to
 
00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:37.960 align:start position:0%
openly say that this is a Democrat bill
 
00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
this is a Republican bill we're not
 
00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:42.440 align:start position:0%
going there I said they join together or
 
00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:45.160 align:start position:0%
or that it's a causation as a result of
 
00:36:47.309 --> 00:36:47.319 align:start position:0%
one party or the other let's present the
 
00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:49.480 align:start position:0%
bill I'm talking about myself too I'm a
 
00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
republican understand I understand that
 
00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
please um another point is that it's
 
00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
this sounds like welfare state um this
 
00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
system that's been used in K through a
 
00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
which was what I was had my career in is
 
00:37:10.589 --> 00:37:10.599 align:start position:0%
now expanding down to infants so um I
 
00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
think you need to steer clear of this
 
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
bill is there any further
 
00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:19.880 align:start position:0%

01:04:11.150 --> 01:04:11.160 align:start position:0%
341 uh this is a hearing relative to
 
01:04:13.390 --> 01:04:13.400 align:start position:0%
mandatory Disclosure by School District
 
01:04:15.190 --> 01:04:15.200 align:start position:0%
employees to parents and I'd like to
 
01:04:17.549 --> 01:04:17.559 align:start position:0%
welcome Senator Lang thank you Mr
 
01:04:18.589 --> 01:04:18.599 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you members of the
 
01:04:19.750 --> 01:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
committee it's great to be back in front
 
01:04:22.349 --> 01:04:22.359 align:start position:0%
of house education again um this is
 
01:04:23.870 --> 01:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
probably one of your shorter bills one
 
01:04:26.670 --> 01:04:26.680 align:start position:0%
page um it's a pretty simple statement
 
01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
of um of it's a process bill um what the
 
01:04:31.870 --> 01:04:31.880 align:start position:0%
bill does just like in many other areas
 
01:04:33.950 --> 01:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
of law we have timelines and processes
 
01:04:36.269 --> 01:04:36.279 align:start position:0%
that have to occur in order to keep uh
 
01:04:38.750 --> 01:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
be accountable to our citizens um this
 
01:04:40.349 --> 01:04:40.359 align:start position:0%
bill established a process and a
 
01:04:43.950 --> 01:04:43.960 align:start position:0%
timeline it says that um Educators u
 
01:04:46.349 --> 01:04:46.359 align:start position:0%
meaning school districts must respond to
 
01:04:47.589 --> 01:04:47.599 align:start position:0%
a parent's written request for
 
01:04:49.789 --> 01:04:49.799 align:start position:0%
information within 10 days and that
 
01:04:53.789 --> 01:04:53.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:55.789 --> 01:04:55.799 align:start position:0%
transparent there was followup
 
01:04:57.829 --> 01:04:57.839 align:start position:0%
conversation talking about what if the
 
01:04:59.789 --> 01:04:59.799 align:start position:0%
disclosure of the information puts the
 
01:05:02.789 --> 01:05:02.799 align:start position:0%
child at risk so therefore in in section
 
01:05:04.910 --> 01:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
two of this bill we establish an an
 
01:05:07.430 --> 01:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
escape clause for the educator that says
 
01:05:10.150 --> 01:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
that if an A Affair um and and good
 
01:05:11.829 --> 01:05:11.839 align:start position:0%
faith determination of the credentialing
 
01:05:14.069 --> 01:05:14.079 align:start position:0%
holder the educator that the disclosure
 
01:05:15.950 --> 01:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
of the information would put a child at
 
01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
risk they're not obligated to disclose
 
01:05:22.589 --> 01:05:22.599 align:start position:0%
however educators are are mandatory
 
01:05:24.910 --> 01:05:24.920 align:start position:0%
reporters if they know a child is at
 
01:05:27.390 --> 01:05:27.400 align:start position:0%
risk they have an obligation to report
 
01:05:29.109 --> 01:05:29.119 align:start position:0%
and this bill just says that if they
 
01:05:31.750 --> 01:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
chosen not to disclose because it'll put
 
01:05:34.309 --> 01:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
the child at risk that child is at risk
 
01:05:36.630 --> 01:05:36.640 align:start position:0%
and therefore should have a man should
 
01:05:38.549 --> 01:05:38.559 align:start position:0%
have a disclosure of that information
 
01:05:43.029 --> 01:05:43.039 align:start position:0%
under the mandatory reporting um
 
01:05:45.829 --> 01:05:45.839 align:start position:0%
component what happens if if someone
 
01:05:48.670 --> 01:05:48.680 align:start position:0%
lies uh an educator lies doesn't
 
01:05:51.789 --> 01:05:51.799 align:start position:0%
disclose what happens um the answer is
 
01:05:54.069 --> 01:05:54.079 align:start position:0%
that that's a that's a matter of um
 
01:05:56.990 --> 01:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
employment um and a matter of discipline
 
01:05:59.390 --> 01:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
right in any one of our jobs if you were
 
01:06:02.589 --> 01:06:02.599 align:start position:0%
to lie would you be expected not to have
 
01:06:05.109 --> 01:06:05.119 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action the answer is no
 
01:06:06.829 --> 01:06:06.839 align:start position:0%
right we would all expect that if we
 
01:06:09.549 --> 01:06:09.559 align:start position:0%
lied um we would have displaying action
 
01:06:11.589 --> 01:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
taken against us by our employer so this
 
01:06:13.549 --> 01:06:13.559 align:start position:0%
bill does set a process that if it comes
 
01:06:17.630 --> 01:06:17.640 align:start position:0%
out that there was a there was a lie was
 
01:06:19.109 --> 01:06:19.119 align:start position:0%
was done it would be an investigation
 
01:06:20.470 --> 01:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
determined when from fact whether there
 
01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:22.640 align:start position:0%
was a lie and then that would be subject
 
01:06:25.870 --> 01:06:25.880 align:start position:0%
to um the code of ethics U which I saw
 
01:06:27.269 --> 01:06:27.279 align:start position:0%
that was handed out you guys all have in
 
01:06:29.390 --> 01:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
front of you um the teacher code of
 
01:06:31.829 --> 01:06:31.839 align:start position:0%
ethics and allow the local school board
 
01:06:34.269 --> 01:06:34.279 align:start position:0%
or the Department of Education to take
 
01:06:36.510 --> 01:06:36.520 align:start position:0%
action based on the code of ethics
 
01:06:38.510 --> 01:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
that's the bill pretty straightforward
 
01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
pretty clear um I I'm amazed that we're
 
01:06:43.990 --> 01:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
having an argument that we that we even
 
01:06:45.670 --> 01:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
anybody would oppose the idea that a
 
01:06:48.069 --> 01:06:48.079 align:start position:0%
teacher should be truthful to a parent
 
01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
um we're going to have a fight about
 
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
this we think that's okay not to be
 
01:06:55.710 --> 01:06:55.720 align:start position:0%
truthful to a parent um I I I I struck
 
01:06:57.069 --> 01:06:57.079 align:start position:0%
my three terms in the house serving
 
01:06:59.349 --> 01:06:59.359 align:start position:0%
several times on this committee as a
 
01:07:01.870 --> 01:07:01.880 align:start position:0%
substitute um and and over in the Senate
 
01:07:04.230 --> 01:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
serving on the house education when we
 
01:07:06.630 --> 01:07:06.640 align:start position:0%
talk about the trust relationship right
 
01:07:07.829 --> 01:07:07.839 align:start position:0%
everyone talks about the trust
 
01:07:10.710 --> 01:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
relationship that occurs and if you're
 
01:07:12.589 --> 01:07:12.599 align:start position:0%
talking to the educator side of the
 
01:07:14.910 --> 01:07:14.920 align:start position:0%
argument they believe that the priority
 
01:07:17.230 --> 01:07:17.240 align:start position:0%
of the trust relationship is the teacher
 
01:07:20.029 --> 01:07:20.039 align:start position:0%
to the student is the priority and if
 
01:07:23.710 --> 01:07:23.720 align:start position:0%
you talk to a parent their argument is
 
01:07:25.109 --> 01:07:25.119 align:start position:0%
that the trust relationship is between
 
01:07:26.950 --> 01:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
the school school district and the
 
01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
parent remember we have compulsory
 
01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
education parents are obligated to send
 
01:07:33.029 --> 01:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
their kid to
 
01:07:35.950 --> 01:07:35.960 align:start position:0%
school they have to trust that that
 
01:07:38.990 --> 01:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
school is going to act appropriately so
 
01:07:40.789 --> 01:07:40.799 align:start position:0%
the trust relationship isn't between the
 
01:07:42.589 --> 01:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
priority isn't between the teacher and
 
01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
the and the student the priority
 
01:07:46.309 --> 01:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
relationship is the trust that I give as
 
01:07:49.589 --> 01:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
a father of four when I send my child to
 
01:07:51.230 --> 01:07:51.240 align:start position:0%
a public school trusting they're going
 
01:07:53.230 --> 01:07:53.240 align:start position:0%
to educate my child they're going to act
 
01:07:55.190 --> 01:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
appropriately with my child and if I
 
01:07:57.510 --> 01:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
have any questions about that I should
 
01:07:59.470 --> 01:07:59.480 align:start position:0%
be able to ask the question put it in
 
01:08:02.230 --> 01:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
writing and ask a question get a timely
 
01:08:06.069 --> 01:08:06.079 align:start position:0%
honest response from the school I that's
 
01:08:08.549 --> 01:08:08.559 align:start position:0%
my right as a parent for for engaging in
 
01:08:11.069 --> 01:08:11.079 align:start position:0%
that trust relationship with public
 
01:08:13.710 --> 01:08:13.720 align:start position:0%
education this bill just does that happy
 
01:08:15.150 --> 01:08:15.160 align:start position:0%
to take questions thank you very much
 
01:08:16.829 --> 01:08:16.839 align:start position:0%

01:08:19.110 --> 01:08:19.120 align:start position:0%

taking my
 
01:08:26.269 --> 01:08:26.279 align:start position:0%
question based on the way that you
 
01:08:28.950 --> 01:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
explained the what was your phrase
 
01:08:31.709 --> 01:08:31.719 align:start position:0%
process that this is a process Bill and
 
01:08:34.749 --> 01:08:34.759 align:start position:0%
what it is should it not therefore apply
 
01:08:36.349 --> 01:08:36.359 align:start position:0%
to every educational setting that a
 
01:08:39.590 --> 01:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:41.870 --> 01:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire again I think it it has to
 
01:08:46.189 --> 01:08:46.199 align:start position:0%
deal with every credentialed um educator
 
01:08:48.910 --> 01:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
right that's what it applies to every
 
01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:50.550 align:start position:0%
right that's what it applies to every
credentialed

01:08:50.550 --> 01:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
credentialed
 
01:08:53.829 --> 01:08:53.839 align:start position:0%

01:09:00.349 --> 01:09:00.359 align:start position:0%
taking my question how is the uh
 
01:09:03.030 --> 01:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
Department going to enforce this section
 
01:09:05.510 --> 01:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
to determine whether there's been a
 
01:09:07.630 --> 01:09:07.640 align:start position:0%
violation uh made by the credential
 
01:09:10.749 --> 01:09:10.759 align:start position:0%
holder to supply both a complete and
 
01:09:12.910 --> 01:09:12.920 align:start position:0%
honest response sure thank you for the
 
01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
question first off I hope we don't have
 
01:09:15.870 --> 01:09:15.880 align:start position:0%
an argument what honest means and what
 
01:09:17.470 --> 01:09:17.480 align:start position:0%
complete means I'm pretty sure those are
 
01:09:19.149 --> 01:09:19.159 align:start position:0%
pretty simple terms we all understand
 
01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
what that means honest and complete it
 
01:09:23.229 --> 01:09:23.239 align:start position:0%
would be like any other violation of the
 
01:09:24.709 --> 01:09:24.719 align:start position:0%
ethics code when someone files a
 
01:09:26.390 --> 01:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
complaint there's investigation done
 
01:09:27.789 --> 01:09:27.799 align:start position:0%
they would make a determination on the
 
01:09:29.829 --> 01:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
ruling whether or not the ethics code
 
01:09:32.749 --> 01:09:32.759 align:start position:0%
was violated and then take action
 
01:09:35.349 --> 01:09:35.359 align:start position:0%
accordingly thank further questions from
 
01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
the committee not seeing thank you very
 
01:09:39.829 --> 01:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
much oh the represent
 
01:09:42.349 --> 01:09:42.359 align:start position:0%
whitcock thank you Senator take a
 
01:09:44.349 --> 01:09:44.359 align:start position:0%
question I'm not going to go up on
 
01:09:47.590 --> 01:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
honors to con complete um I do have a
 
01:09:51.510 --> 01:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
question though um see to the mic yeah
 
01:09:55.510 --> 01:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
thank you sir um thank you
 
01:09:59.229 --> 01:09:59.239 align:start position:0%
so a parent
 
01:10:01.709 --> 01:10:01.719 align:start position:0%
um for some reason whatever that reason
 
01:10:04.189 --> 01:10:04.199 align:start position:0%
may be is going to submit a written
 
01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
request to a teacher asking uh what is
 
01:10:09.390 --> 01:10:09.400 align:start position:0%
the curriculum uh dealing with social
 
01:10:11.790 --> 01:10:11.800 align:start position:0%
studies World War II and the teacher
 
01:10:13.830 --> 01:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
responds that here it is or it's on the
 
01:10:18.630 --> 01:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
website um but if a parent wants to know
 
01:10:21.990 --> 01:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
more about something more
 
01:10:25.390 --> 01:10:25.400 align:start position:0%
personal and they ask a teacher do you
 
01:10:28.990 --> 01:10:29.000 align:start position:0%
you know for instance if my son John is
 
01:10:33.070 --> 01:10:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:36.350 --> 01:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
soup and Mary Sue has already conf John
 
01:10:38.030 --> 01:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
has confined the teacher you know we're
 
01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:41.080 align:start position:0%
involved we're in love y y
 
01:10:43.830 --> 01:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
y the parent the teacher is required to
 
01:10:47.030 --> 01:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
tell them that this youngster is yes
 
01:10:49.390 --> 01:10:49.400 align:start position:0%
involved with that girl so again if it's
 
01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
knowledge known to the teacher and and
 
01:10:53.870 --> 01:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
it's not an it's not a guess it's not
 
01:10:56.430 --> 01:10:56.440 align:start position:0%
hearsay it's not your instance that you
 
01:10:57.990 --> 01:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
gave me there was a direct conversation
 
01:10:59.550 --> 01:10:59.560 align:start position:0%
between the student and the and the
 
01:11:01.149 --> 01:11:01.159 align:start position:0%
teacher yes I don't think in any
 
01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
instance that a parent a school should
 
01:11:04.630 --> 01:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
keep secrets from
 
01:11:07.669 --> 01:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
parents follow up thank you
 
01:11:09.870 --> 01:11:09.880 align:start position:0%
so I guess I'm not think of a secret I'm
 
01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
thinking about
 
01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
if if I come to a teacher as a student
 
01:11:18.070 --> 01:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
and I understand your trust scenario
 
01:11:20.189 --> 01:11:20.199 align:start position:0%
there I don't particularly agree with it
 
01:11:21.950 --> 01:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
uh if I come to
 
01:11:24.550 --> 01:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
the parent to the teacher as a student
 
01:11:26.910 --> 01:11:26.920 align:start position:0%
and say you know I think Mary Lou and I
 
01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
Mary Sue and I need help um is there any
 
01:11:31.990 --> 01:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
place in you can you can suggest that we
 
01:11:33.990 --> 01:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
go to get help um I don't want my
 
01:11:35.270 --> 01:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
parents to know because we don't know
 
01:11:36.790 --> 01:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
what's going on we just need to get more
 
01:11:40.149 --> 01:11:40.159 align:start position:0%
help so they're not it's not a 51a it's
 
01:11:42.470 --> 01:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
not child abuse it's not imminent danger
 
01:11:44.270 --> 01:11:44.280 align:start position:0%
is I'm afraid my parents would not
 
01:11:46.830 --> 01:11:46.840 align:start position:0%
accept this and they may throw me out
 
01:11:48.870 --> 01:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
okay so those those don't meet any
 
01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
criteria 51a but they do meet the
 
01:11:54.470 --> 01:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
criteria of their student in need so am
 
01:11:56.149 --> 01:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
am I precluding from saying well you
 
01:11:58.229 --> 01:11:58.239 align:start position:0%
know what I think you should go to the
 
01:12:00.510 --> 01:12:00.520 align:start position:0%
guidance counselor or to the maybe to
 
01:12:02.790 --> 01:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
the school nurse or to the to the
 
01:12:04.350 --> 01:12:04.360 align:start position:0%
doctor's office or depending what the
 
01:12:08.470 --> 01:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
isue happens to be um and that I don't I
 
01:12:11.390 --> 01:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
only could tell you that uh in in in
 
01:12:13.790 --> 01:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
honestly if you're asking me but if a
 
01:12:16.189 --> 01:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
teacher ask me in writing have you had
 
01:12:17.910 --> 01:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
conversations with my youngster or do
 
01:12:19.070 --> 01:12:19.080 align:start position:0%
you know anything about that I have to
 
01:12:21.189 --> 01:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
respond to that and put that put that
 
01:12:25.629 --> 01:12:25.639 align:start position:0%
youngster at risk well again so I I I I
 
01:12:27.070 --> 01:12:27.080 align:start position:0%
would just like we have a difference
 
01:12:28.390 --> 01:12:28.400 align:start position:0%
apparently in the trust relationship
 
01:12:30.070 --> 01:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
argument where that trust relationship
 
01:12:32.030 --> 01:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
resides um well I think it's with the
 
01:12:33.229 --> 01:12:33.239 align:start position:0%
parents and you must think it's with the
 
01:12:36.110 --> 01:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
students in this situation again schools
 
01:12:38.110 --> 01:12:38.120 align:start position:0%
should not keep secrets from parents
 
01:12:40.510 --> 01:12:40.520 align:start position:0%
period right is that when a when a
 
01:12:42.550 --> 01:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
conversation occurs the teacher should
 
01:12:45.390 --> 01:12:45.400 align:start position:0%
always play in in mind that when a
 
01:12:46.990 --> 01:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
conversation occurs a relationship is
 
01:12:48.270 --> 01:12:48.280 align:start position:0%
with the parent and have asked they have
 
01:12:50.229 --> 01:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
to give an honest answer you can't lie
 
01:12:51.590 --> 01:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
about that to
 
01:12:54.550 --> 01:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
parent last one thank you last one
 
01:12:58.229 --> 01:12:58.239 align:start position:0%
surely um so I want to go back to this
 
01:13:00.510 --> 01:13:00.520 align:start position:0%
things just have you ever taught in a
 
01:13:02.350 --> 01:13:02.360 align:start position:0%
school I'm sorry have you ever taught in
 
01:13:04.470 --> 01:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
a school yes I have okay in a public
 
01:13:06.669 --> 01:13:06.679 align:start position:0%
school yes okay good so you know that
 
01:13:08.430 --> 01:13:08.440 align:start position:0%
the students would come to you ask you
 
01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:09.830 align:start position:0%
the students would come to you ask you
things

01:13:09.830 --> 01:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:13:13.030 --> 01:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
um if that is the students's only
 
01:13:16.390 --> 01:13:16.400 align:start position:0%
Lifeline to get information is through
 
01:13:19.149 --> 01:13:19.159 align:start position:0%
that teacher and they're petrified that
 
01:13:20.510 --> 01:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
you're going to tell the parent so we're
 
01:13:23.030 --> 01:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
going to now allow the student to be out
 
01:13:26.510 --> 01:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
there confused not have any accurate
 
01:13:28.629 --> 01:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
Direction so because we're afraid we
 
01:13:30.790 --> 01:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
have to tell the parent I mean can you
 
01:13:32.669 --> 01:13:32.679 align:start position:0%
understand what my concern as a teacher
 
01:13:34.629 --> 01:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
absolutely I understand your concern but
 
01:13:36.390 --> 01:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
again I go back to the argument of trust
 
01:13:37.950 --> 01:13:37.960 align:start position:0%
relationship the relationship is not
 
01:13:39.629 --> 01:13:39.639 align:start position:0%
between the student and the teacher the
 
01:13:41.189 --> 01:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
relationship is between the teacher and
 
01:13:43.229 --> 01:13:43.239 align:start position:0%
the parent and the trust that the parent
 
01:13:45.830 --> 01:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
puts in the public education system to
 
01:13:49.149 --> 01:13:49.159 align:start position:0%
to uh to teach their child if you're
 
01:13:54.149 --> 01:13:54.159 align:start position:0%
trust can I excuse me so if I so again
 
01:13:56.990 --> 01:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
if that relationship is is is truthful
 
01:13:59.189 --> 01:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
right and I and I I I would presume by
 
01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
your question you think it's okay for
 
01:14:02.709 --> 01:14:02.719 align:start position:0%
the teacher not to tell the parent that
 
01:14:04.629 --> 01:14:04.639 align:start position:0%
information and hide it from the parent
 
01:14:04.639 --> 01:14:05.430 align:start position:0%
information and hide it from the parent
I

01:14:05.430 --> 01:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:14:07.629 --> 01:14:07.639 align:start position:0%
disagree thank you very much are there
 
01:14:09.629 --> 01:14:09.639 align:start position:0%
further represent Myer thank you Mr
 
01:14:12.110 --> 01:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for being here so would
 
01:14:15.430 --> 01:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
it be based upon what you've said so far
 
01:14:18.870 --> 01:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
Senator would it be fair to say that
 
01:14:21.550 --> 01:14:21.560 align:start position:0%
this bill would end the confidentiality
 
01:14:23.189 --> 01:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
that teachers would have with students
 
01:14:25.669 --> 01:14:25.679 align:start position:0%
is that correct I think I was pretty
 
01:14:27.629 --> 01:14:27.639 align:start position:0%
clear teachers should never keep secrets
 
01:14:29.790 --> 01:14:29.800 align:start position:0%
from parents so the answer is yes the
 
01:14:31.149 --> 01:14:31.159 align:start position:0%
answer is Teachers should never keep
 
01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
secrets from parents answer is yes I
 
01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
don't how many times I can answer the
 
01:14:36.430 --> 01:14:36.440 align:start position:0%
question well I I'm just asking you a
 
01:14:38.550 --> 01:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
very simple question yes or teacher yes
 
01:14:40.070 --> 01:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
teachers should not keep secrets from
 
01:14:42.510 --> 01:14:42.520 align:start position:0%
parents so they there no confidentiality
 
01:14:46.950 --> 01:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
then thank you represent B Bon thank you
 
01:14:48.430 --> 01:14:48.440 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:14:50.990 --> 01:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
question um I was just wondering I I
 
01:14:52.470 --> 01:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
know that there was an initiative in the
 
01:14:54.550 --> 01:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
department of education for a program
 
01:14:57.430 --> 01:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
called one one trusted adult um how do
 
01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
you see this bill interacting with the
 
01:15:02.030 --> 01:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
program one trusted adult because the
 
01:15:04.510 --> 01:15:04.520 align:start position:0%
whole premise of the program is to give
 
01:15:06.510 --> 01:15:06.520 align:start position:0%
students who might be in need or need an
 
01:15:08.430 --> 01:15:08.440 align:start position:0%
extra person to talk to at a certain
 
01:15:11.830 --> 01:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
time might not be ready uh to talk to
 
01:15:15.229 --> 01:15:15.239 align:start position:0%
their parents um to me this uh just
 
01:15:18.390 --> 01:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
totally dissolves that program again
 
01:15:20.870 --> 01:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
Nothing Stops the student from talking
 
01:15:22.550 --> 01:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
to the parent I mean sorry student
 
01:15:25.149 --> 01:15:25.159 align:start position:0%
talking to the teacher um Nothing Stops
 
01:15:26.510 --> 01:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
that interact there's nothing in this
 
01:15:29.110 --> 01:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
bill that says they can't have that
 
01:15:32.270 --> 01:15:32.280 align:start position:0%
communication further questions I I want
 
01:15:34.550 --> 01:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
to remind everybody we have 35 cards up
 
01:15:37.550 --> 01:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
here and so if you have another followup
 
01:15:40.629 --> 01:15:40.639 align:start position:0%
represent Bon can we do it quickly no
 
01:15:42.709 --> 01:15:42.719 align:start position:0%
for yes representa Cornell I I think
 
01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
there should be trust everywhere but
 
01:15:46.910 --> 01:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
you're not getting to the trust between
 
01:15:49.590 --> 01:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
the the student the child and the parent
 
01:15:51.669 --> 01:15:51.679 align:start position:0%
so if the parent has to write a written
 
01:15:53.350 --> 01:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
note to the teacher asking them about
 
01:15:56.350 --> 01:15:56.360 align:start position:0%
something their child is doing wouldn't
 
01:15:58.030 --> 01:15:58.040 align:start position:0%
the parent go to the child first and
 
01:15:59.870 --> 01:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
shouldn't they have that relationship so
 
01:16:02.030 --> 01:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
that they can trust the child to tell
 
01:16:03.750 --> 01:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
them the truth thank you for the
 
01:16:06.110 --> 01:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
question so I'm a parent to four kids
 
01:16:08.030 --> 01:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
two boys and two girls I was lucky
 
01:16:11.350 --> 01:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
enough to go girl boy girl boy um but as
 
01:16:14.070 --> 01:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
I know with with my own children is that
 
01:16:15.669 --> 01:16:15.679 align:start position:0%
a relationship between a parent and a
 
01:16:17.750 --> 01:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
child es and flows there are times your
 
01:16:19.030 --> 01:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
kids will tell you things you wish they
 
01:16:20.790 --> 01:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
didn't tell you and there are time that
 
01:16:22.830 --> 01:16:22.840 align:start position:0%
they tell they won't talk to you at all
 
01:16:24.510 --> 01:16:24.520 align:start position:0%
that's the nature of a child and so if
 
01:16:26.709 --> 01:16:26.719 align:start position:0%
I'm in the E side of that that
 
01:16:28.270 --> 01:16:28.280 align:start position:0%
relationship with my child where the
 
01:16:30.590 --> 01:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
child I I'm I know there's something

this bill says that they have an
 
01:17:20.030 --> 01:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
obligation to
 
01:17:22.070 --> 01:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
help further questions from the
 
01:17:25.310 --> 01:17:25.320 align:start position:0%
committee represent beler
 
01:17:27.030 --> 01:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
01:17:28.990 --> 01:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
senator for providing us with this bill
 
01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
I like I the intention in where this
 
01:17:32.669 --> 01:17:32.679 align:start position:0%
bill is going I like very much I have a
 
01:17:34.629 --> 01:17:34.639 align:start position:0%
little bit of a concern hoping you can
 
01:17:35.950 --> 01:17:35.960 align:start position:0%
help assuage it a little bit so let me
 
01:17:37.709 --> 01:17:37.719 align:start position:0%
paint you a picture of what I'm what I'm
 
01:17:41.510 --> 01:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
thinking um so because this bill uses uh
 
01:17:43.910 --> 01:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
the standard of good faith determination
 
01:17:46.070 --> 01:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
of the credential holder and not the
 
01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
reasonable person standard um and it
 
01:17:52.550 --> 01:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
also goes on to talk about um well it
 
01:17:53.950 --> 01:17:53.960 align:start position:0%
goes on to create a requirement for
 
01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:55.430 align:start position:0%
goes on to create a requirement for
reporting

01:17:55.430 --> 01:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
01:17:58.390 --> 01:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
um with the argument seemingly being
 
01:18:02.070 --> 01:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
that if there is a requirement uh or if
 
01:18:03.790 --> 01:18:03.800 align:start position:0%
there is a real reason to fear any sort
 
01:18:06.270 --> 01:18:06.280 align:start position:0%
of imminent harm to a child due to
 
01:18:08.430 --> 01:18:08.440 align:start position:0%
disclosing this information then there
 
01:18:12.709 --> 01:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
really is also um a risk generally to
 
01:18:12.719 --> 01:18:13.430 align:start position:0%
really is also um a risk generally to
the

01:18:13.430 --> 01:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:18:17.030 --> 01:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
child um I guess my my concern comes in
 
01:18:18.629 --> 01:18:18.639 align:start position:0%
is okay let's we we' played out the
 
01:18:21.149 --> 01:18:21.159 align:start position:0%
scenario it's been reported because it's
 
01:18:22.750 --> 01:18:22.760 align:start position:0%
in this bill even though the teacher
 
01:18:24.270 --> 01:18:24.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have reported it otherwise
 
01:18:27.229 --> 01:18:27.239 align:start position:0%
because weren't really thinking about it
 
01:18:29.430 --> 01:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
now it turns out the complaint was
 
01:18:33.790 --> 01:18:33.800 align:start position:0%
totally unfounded you go to the process
 
01:18:36.030 --> 01:18:36.040 align:start position:0%
of of trying to hold somebody
 
01:18:38.110 --> 01:18:38.120 align:start position:0%
accountable for is there a question yes
 
01:18:39.669 --> 01:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying get to it real quickly
 
01:18:43.149 --> 01:18:43.159 align:start position:0%
not a background yeah so okay so now the
 
01:18:46.790 --> 01:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
standard to move forward is based on not
 
01:18:48.350 --> 01:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
the reasonable person standard but the
 
01:18:51.470 --> 01:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
good faith of this person is it even
 
01:18:54.310 --> 01:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
possible realistically to think that
 
01:18:56.270 --> 01:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
somebody could be held accountable for a
 
01:18:59.110 --> 01:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
report that is false under that standard
 
01:19:01.990 --> 01:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
in this so my answer is yes again so my
 
01:19:03.830 --> 01:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
previous life I was a police prosecutor
 
01:19:06.709 --> 01:19:06.719 align:start position:0%
so I understand the the the stages of of
 
01:19:09.470 --> 01:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
um you know knowing Reckless negligent
 
01:19:12.149 --> 01:19:12.159 align:start position:0%
those kind of things right so again in
 
01:19:14.830 --> 01:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
this case if a teacher had a good faith
 
01:19:16.510 --> 01:19:16.520 align:start position:0%
argument they have to make they have to
 
01:19:18.070 --> 01:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
articulate that they have to be able to
 
01:19:19.270 --> 01:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
you know if they're being challenge they
 
01:19:20.470 --> 01:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
have to be able to say here's why I
 
01:19:22.110 --> 01:19:22.120 align:start position:0%
thought that and then a reasonable
 
01:19:23.910 --> 01:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
Arbiter would have to say no that well
 
01:19:26.149 --> 01:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
you had a good reason to think that um
 
01:19:27.750 --> 01:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
and so therefore you have the right to
 
01:19:29.270 --> 01:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
withhold the information so I think
 
01:19:31.229 --> 01:19:31.239 align:start position:0%
again it's about the investigation and
 
01:19:34.550 --> 01:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
about why if a teacher chose to withhold
 
01:19:36.629 --> 01:19:36.639 align:start position:0%
information what was their reasoning for
 
01:19:38.470 --> 01:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
doing that and that is stand that
 
01:19:40.669 --> 01:19:40.679 align:start position:0%
standard is based on good faith
 
01:19:43.310 --> 01:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
reasoning representative
 
01:19:49.070 --> 01:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:51.629 --> 01:19:51.639 align:start position:0%
yeah thank it's been a long day already
 
01:19:56.229 --> 01:19:56.239 align:start position:0%
I guess uh the uh the the concept here
 
01:19:59.950 --> 01:19:59.960 align:start position:0%
of confidentiality has been re raised uh
 
01:20:02.750 --> 01:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
during the uh questioning that you've
 
01:20:07.030 --> 01:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
received and uh I'm I'm I'm wondering
 
01:20:10.790 --> 01:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
are you are you aware of whether or not
 
01:20:13.149 --> 01:20:13.159 align:start position:0%
there is any sort of standard
 
01:20:16.550 --> 01:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
established in law with respect to
 
01:20:19.030 --> 01:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
confidentiality between a student and a
 
01:20:21.990 --> 01:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
teacher a teacher and a student is is
 
01:20:23.830 --> 01:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
there any basis for this in law
 
01:20:26.510 --> 01:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
confidentiality such that a teacher
 
01:20:28.990 --> 01:20:29.000 align:start position:0%
would not have to disclose because of a
 
01:20:31.030 --> 01:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
kind of a quasi confidential
 
01:20:33.550 --> 01:20:33.560 align:start position:0%
relationship that's been established so
 
01:20:34.750 --> 01:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
I I guess what you're trying to get to
 
01:20:37.070 --> 01:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
is like a doctor patient relationship
 
01:20:39.030 --> 01:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
attorney client privilege that kind of
 
01:20:40.950 --> 01:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
thing is not to my knowledge at all
 
01:20:42.390 --> 01:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
there's no such standard at all well
 
01:20:43.870 --> 01:20:43.880 align:start position:0%
thank you I didn't think so thanks
 
01:20:45.390 --> 01:20:45.400 align:start position:0%
further questions from the
 
01:20:47.470 --> 01:20:47.480 align:start position:0%

now a state representative as you
 
01:21:28.310 --> 01:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
probably know from previous times I've
 
01:21:29.629 --> 01:21:29.639 align:start position:0%
testified before you I used to be a
 
01:21:30.990 --> 01:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
middle school and high school English
 
01:21:32.870 --> 01:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
teacher I've been out of the classroom
 
01:21:34.709 --> 01:21:34.719 align:start position:0%
for a while now some of my former
 
01:21:36.350 --> 01:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
students have now turned 40 but they
 
01:21:37.990 --> 01:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
still reach out to me for guidance and
 
01:21:40.070 --> 01:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
advice in fact I was chatting with one
 
01:21:41.510 --> 01:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
online just
 
01:21:43.390 --> 01:21:43.400 align:start position:0%
yesterday um when I was a teacher I
 
01:21:44.709 --> 01:21:44.719 align:start position:0%
worked really hard to Foster
 
01:21:47.070 --> 01:21:47.080 align:start position:0%
relationships with all of my students so
 
01:21:48.189 --> 01:21:48.199 align:start position:0%
that they would feel safe and
 
01:21:50.189 --> 01:21:50.199 align:start position:0%
comfortable talking with me about
 
01:21:52.390 --> 01:21:52.400 align:start position:0%
problems sometimes it was how to
 
01:21:53.790 --> 01:21:53.800 align:start position:0%
navigate a difficult situation with
 
01:21:55.310 --> 01:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
another teacher
 
01:21:56.510 --> 01:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes it was because they'd had an
 
01:21:58.149 --> 01:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
argument with their parents and needed
 
01:22:00.189 --> 01:22:00.199 align:start position:0%
to find a safe space to vent so they
 
01:22:01.669 --> 01:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
could go back and work out whatever the
 
01:22:05.149 --> 01:22:05.159 align:start position:0%
issue was we would often practice how to
 
01:22:06.750 --> 01:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
have that conversation so that they'd be
 
01:22:08.310 --> 01:22:08.320 align:start position:0%
able to go back and no matter what their
 
01:22:10.390 --> 01:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
parents say they'd be able to stay calm
 
01:22:12.550 --> 01:22:12.560 align:start position:0%
to have the discussion with their
 
01:22:14.270 --> 01:22:14.280 align:start position:0%
parents sometimes it was about
 
01:22:16.390 --> 01:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
relationship issues sometimes it was
 
01:22:17.510 --> 01:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
about relationship issues they knew
 
01:22:19.030 --> 01:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
their parents wouldn't be comfortable
 
01:22:21.470 --> 01:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
with in fact one of my specific
 
01:22:23.270 --> 01:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
responsibilities as an adviser was to
 
01:22:24.590 --> 01:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
create the kind of safe space for
 
01:22:26.110 --> 01:22:26.120 align:start position:0%
students could come talk to me to get
 
01:22:28.149 --> 01:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
the advice and guidance they needed on
 
01:22:30.229 --> 01:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
how to navigate those challenging
 
01:22:32.790 --> 01:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
aspects of their life and it was crucial
 
01:22:34.870 --> 01:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
that I kept their confidence while they
 
01:22:38.030 --> 01:22:38.040 align:start position:0%
figured out these issues there were some
 
01:22:39.350 --> 01:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
occasions where kids might have come to
 
01:22:40.950 --> 01:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
talk to me because they knew or maybe
 
01:22:43.550 --> 01:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
they suspected they were lgbtq and they
 
01:22:45.310 --> 01:22:45.320 align:start position:0%
just needed to figure out how to talk to
 
01:22:46.750 --> 01:22:46.760 align:start position:0%
their parents about it when they felt
 
01:22:49.229 --> 01:22:49.239 align:start position:0%
safe and ready to do so they might have
 
01:22:51.270 --> 01:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
discussed their depression they might
 
01:22:52.790 --> 01:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
have discussed their worries about their
 
01:22:54.950 --> 01:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
parents' Health in one case I had a
 
01:22:57.189 --> 01:22:57.199 align:start position:0%
student who came to me because it was
 
01:23:00.470 --> 01:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
just after 911 and uh her father an
 
01:23:02.590 --> 01:23:02.600 align:start position:0%
unnamed Pentagon official had just been
 
01:23:04.430 --> 01:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
deployed that was certainly something I
 
01:23:06.830 --> 01:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
had to keep extremely conf confidential
 
01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:07.790 align:start position:0%
had to keep extremely conf confidential
from

01:23:07.790 --> 01:23:07.800 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:09.870 align:start position:0%
from
everyone

01:23:09.870 --> 01:23:09.880 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
01:23:12.310 --> 01:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
um so kids came to talk to me about all
 
01:23:14.990 --> 01:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
sorts of things we need that safe space
 
01:23:17.870 --> 01:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
we need to have that ability um in
 
01:23:19.830 --> 01:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
general my feel my children do feel safe
 
01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
I have two teenagers they feel safe
 
01:23:23.629 --> 01:23:23.639 align:start position:0%
coming to talk to me about most things
 
01:23:25.430 --> 01:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
but not everything
 
01:23:27.830 --> 01:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
time's up okay I urge you to oppose this
 
01:23:30.189 --> 01:23:30.199 align:start position:0%

01:23:31.950 --> 01:23:31.960 align:start position:0%

you Mr chairman and members of the
 
01:24:25.990 --> 01:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
committee uh prior to becoming a state
 
01:24:27.310 --> 01:24:27.320 align:start position:0%
representative I was a high school
 
01:24:29.189 --> 01:24:29.199 align:start position:0%
teacher for 40 years both in private and
 
01:24:31.310 --> 01:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
public schools and I'm here to speak on
 
01:24:33.590 --> 01:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
behalf of my students who over the years
 
01:24:35.750 --> 01:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
some have confided in me and didn't
 
01:24:37.629 --> 01:24:37.639 align:start position:0%
necessarily want me sharing with uh
 
01:24:39.910 --> 01:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
others there was the student who for
 
01:24:41.310 --> 01:24:41.320 align:start position:0%
whatever reason felt the need to
 
01:24:43.149 --> 01:24:43.159 align:start position:0%
complain to me about her mother almost
 
01:24:45.070 --> 01:24:45.080 align:start position:0%
every day sometimes breaking down in
 
01:24:47.470 --> 01:24:47.480 align:start position:0%
tears now as a young adult she and her
 
01:24:49.390 --> 01:24:49.400 align:start position:0%
mother are best friends and I was happy
 
01:24:51.470 --> 01:24:51.480 align:start position:0%
to pres preside over her wedding this
 
01:24:53.629 --> 01:24:53.639 align:start position:0%
past summer there was the student who
 
01:24:55.310 --> 01:24:55.320 align:start position:0%
confided the meting that she didn't
 
01:24:56.910 --> 01:24:56.920 align:start position:0%
believe that her father loved her
 
01:24:58.470 --> 01:24:58.480 align:start position:0%
because he took a strong interest in her
 
01:25:00.189 --> 01:25:00.199 align:start position:0%
brother's Sports and attended all of his
 
01:25:02.350 --> 01:25:02.360 align:start position:0%
games but didn't go to any of her school
 
01:25:04.229 --> 01:25:04.239 align:start position:0%
events and didn't support her Ambitions
 
01:25:06.550 --> 01:25:06.560 align:start position:0%
to go to college I remember the student
 
01:25:08.709 --> 01:25:08.719 align:start position:0%
who shared with me how sad she was
 
01:25:10.590 --> 01:25:10.600 align:start position:0%
because she broke up with her boyfriend
 
01:25:12.189 --> 01:25:12.199 align:start position:0%
she did so because she believed it was
 
01:25:14.310 --> 01:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
inevitable anyway since they'd soon be
 
01:25:16.550 --> 01:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
going off to college and I told her you
 
01:25:18.750 --> 01:25:18.760 align:start position:0%
know you should just enjoy senior year
 
01:25:21.629 --> 01:25:21.639 align:start position:0%
and see how things play out well today
 
01:25:23.950 --> 01:25:23.960 align:start position:0%
they're married my only regret is they
 
01:25:26.590 --> 01:25:26.600 align:start position:0%
didn't named their firstborn child after
 
01:25:29.470 --> 01:25:29.480 align:start position:0%
me most disheartening was the student
 
01:25:31.350 --> 01:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
who told me about her mother's mental
 
01:25:33.709 --> 01:25:33.719 align:start position:0%
illness and that her father was an
 
01:25:35.430 --> 01:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
alcoholic and that when he'd come home
 
01:25:37.629 --> 01:25:37.639 align:start position:0%
from work drunk they would argue and she
 
01:25:39.709 --> 01:25:39.719 align:start position:0%
would go out to the car to escape
 
01:25:42.189 --> 01:25:42.199 align:start position:0%
sometimes falling asleep there today
 
01:25:44.030 --> 01:25:44.040 align:start position:0%
she's married she has her own child and
 
01:25:46.270 --> 01:25:46.280 align:start position:0%
I can go on and on and on with stories
 
01:25:47.750 --> 01:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
kids come to talk to their teachers
 
01:25:50.430 --> 01:25:50.440 align:start position:0%
about all kinds of things my point is
 
01:25:53.149 --> 01:25:53.159 align:start position:0%
this these are real people these are
 
01:25:55.950 --> 01:25:55.960 align:start position:0%
kids who sometimes feel the need to talk
 
01:25:58.669 --> 01:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
with a trusted adult especially if for
 
01:26:00.470 --> 01:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
whatever reason they just don't feel
 
01:26:02.550 --> 01:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
comfortable or are not ready to talk
 
01:26:05.149 --> 01:26:05.159 align:start position:0%
with their parents just to vent to share
 
01:26:07.310 --> 01:26:07.320 align:start position:0%
their worries and concerns bounce ideas
 
01:26:10.430 --> 01:26:10.440 align:start position:0%
off of to be reassured validated and to
 
01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
know that they can be open talk freely
 
01:26:15.310 --> 01:26:15.320 align:start position:0%
without being harshly
 
01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
judged last Point quickly please I serve
 
01:26:20.790 --> 01:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
on children and family law okay and I
 
01:26:23.510 --> 01:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
can tell you that there are many many
 
01:26:25.830 --> 01:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
dysfunctional families out there in a
 
01:26:28.070 --> 01:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
perfect world parents could talk to kids
 
01:26:29.790 --> 01:26:29.800 align:start position:0%
and kids could talk to parents but we
 
01:26:31.390 --> 01:26:31.400 align:start position:0%
know that's not a reality plain and
 
01:26:33.910 --> 01:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
simple this is a harmful legislation and
 
01:26:35.750 --> 01:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
I urge you please to uh vote in
 
01:26:37.910 --> 01:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
expedient to legisl thank representative
 
01:26:39.709 --> 01:26:39.719 align:start position:0%
are there questions yes representative P
 
01:26:41.910 --> 01:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
or no thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:26:44.669 --> 01:26:44.679 align:start position:0%
for um taking my question you gave a lot
 
01:26:47.870 --> 01:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
of examples of instances where students
 
01:26:50.390 --> 01:26:50.400 align:start position:0%
came to you and confided in you but have
 
01:26:52.070 --> 01:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
you ever had an exam do you have any
 
01:26:54.229 --> 01:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
examples of parents asking you question
 
01:26:56.149 --> 01:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
questions that you felt like they
 
01:26:59.270 --> 01:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have the answer to no that's
 
01:27:00.750 --> 01:27:00.760 align:start position:0%
that's the thing that I find quite
 
01:27:03.189 --> 01:27:03.199 align:start position:0%
interesting about this bill is that
 
01:27:05.350 --> 01:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
after 40 years I really never had any
 
01:27:07.910 --> 01:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
student ask me questions or come to me
 
01:27:10.709 --> 01:27:10.719 align:start position:0%
to confide in U matters of their sexual
 
01:27:13.149 --> 01:27:13.159 align:start position:0%
orientation or identity it's just a
 
01:27:15.350 --> 01:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
matter of kids opening up and talking
 
01:27:17.870 --> 01:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
but I mean should that parent ask
 
01:27:21.149 --> 01:27:21.159 align:start position:0%
me um is my child talking to you to you
 
01:27:23.229 --> 01:27:23.239 align:start position:0%
about my relationship with my husband do
 
01:27:25.229 --> 01:27:25.239 align:start position:0%
I have to reveal yes she told me that
 
01:27:26.629 --> 01:27:26.639 align:start position:0%
you struggle with mental illness and
 
01:27:28.030 --> 01:27:28.040 align:start position:0%
your husband comes home drunk every
 
01:27:30.030 --> 01:27:30.040 align:start position:0%
night I mean that would be incredibly
 
01:27:32.149 --> 01:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
awkward and inappropriate but that
 
01:27:33.790 --> 01:27:33.800 align:start position:0%
student really felt they needed to go to
 
01:27:35.470 --> 01:27:35.480 align:start position:0%
an adult and just get that off their
 
01:27:39.189 --> 01:27:39.199 align:start position:0%
chest and just you know just express it
 
01:27:42.669 --> 01:27:42.679 align:start position:0%
and should a parent ask me what is it
 
01:27:44.950 --> 01:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
that um my kid is talking to you about
 
01:27:47.229 --> 01:27:47.239 align:start position:0%
and I have to answer those kinds of
 
01:27:49.669 --> 01:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
questions kids need to talk to an adult
 
01:27:53.109 --> 01:27:53.119 align:start position:0%
sometimes just a vent so I don't know
 
01:27:55.790 --> 01:27:55.800 align:start position:0%
thank you first the questions represent
 
01:27:57.870 --> 01:27:57.880 align:start position:0%
beler thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:28:00.149 --> 01:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
being here I just wanted to to nail down
 
01:28:03.350 --> 01:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
one part and and uh be clear uh you were
 
01:28:05.070 --> 01:28:05.080 align:start position:0%
talking about students when you would
 
01:28:07.070 --> 01:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
you you would been involved confiding
 
01:28:08.950 --> 01:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
things like sexual orientation and
 
01:28:11.030 --> 01:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
whatnot is it is it your intent to
 
01:28:13.390 --> 01:28:13.400 align:start position:0%
testify this committee that children in
 
01:28:15.109 --> 01:28:15.119 align:start position:0%
public schools should be able to talk
 
01:28:17.830 --> 01:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
about sex with employees of the public
 
01:28:20.629 --> 01:28:20.639 align:start position:0%
employees of public schools uh privately
 
01:28:22.790 --> 01:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
and with expectation of confidentiality
 
01:28:25.870 --> 01:28:25.880 align:start position:0%
from their parents I think that teachers
 
01:28:27.870 --> 01:28:27.880 align:start position:0%
most teachers are responsible adults and
 
01:28:29.870 --> 01:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
they're surrogate parents and that when
 
01:28:32.270 --> 01:28:32.280 align:start position:0%
students come to them and ask them
 
01:28:34.550 --> 01:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
honest uh questions uh they expect
 
01:28:39.790 --> 01:28:39.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:42.030 --> 01:28:42.040 align:start position:0%
um I have to say that I loved being a
 
01:28:43.590 --> 01:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
teacher and I loved my students and I
 
01:28:45.830 --> 01:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
treated them like I would treat my own
 
01:28:48.629 --> 01:28:48.639 align:start position:0%
my own kids my own my own children uh I
 
01:28:50.990 --> 01:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
I took my profession very very seriously
 
01:28:52.709 --> 01:28:52.719 align:start position:0%
uh this past weekend I was at a
 
01:28:54.550 --> 01:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
political event in man
 
01:28:57.350 --> 01:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
and a 50-year-old man saw me and said
 
01:28:59.350 --> 01:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
excuse me are you Mr patrino and I said
 
01:29:01.510 --> 01:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
yes he said I had you in school many
 
01:29:04.229 --> 01:29:04.239 align:start position:0%
years ago and wow I just can't believe
 
01:29:06.189 --> 01:29:06.199 align:start position:0%
that I've run into you and I have to
 
01:29:07.910 --> 01:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for all you did for me many
 
01:29:09.910 --> 01:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
many years ago and I was surprised you
 
01:29:13.030 --> 01:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
recognize me CU back then I had hair but
 
01:29:15.669 --> 01:29:15.679 align:start position:0%
I I really felt good to know that I made
 
01:29:18.350 --> 01:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
an impact on this person's life teachers
 
01:29:20.709 --> 01:29:20.719 align:start position:0%
are surrogate parents and and good
 
01:29:23.149 --> 01:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
teachers want to do good things for kids
 
01:29:25.270 --> 01:29:25.280 align:start position:0%
and I really believe that this
 
01:29:27.709 --> 01:29:27.719 align:start position:0%
legislation takes away that important
 
01:29:29.550 --> 01:29:29.560 align:start position:0%
relationship when kids have no place to
 
01:29:31.590 --> 01:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
turn to they can go to a teacher that
 
01:29:33.629 --> 01:29:33.639 align:start position:0%
they trust and you can have honest and
 
01:29:35.270 --> 01:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
open discussions with them and there's
 
01:29:37.310 --> 01:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
nothing wrong with that nothing wrong at
 
01:29:39.270 --> 01:29:39.280 align:start position:0%
all it's very healthy and normal and
 
01:29:41.270 --> 01:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
natural thank you any further questions
 
01:29:43.830 --> 01:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
from the committee thank you very much
 
01:29:45.750 --> 01:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
representative thank you I'd like to
 
01:30:00.270 --> 01:30:00.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:02.229 --> 01:30:02.239 align:start position:0%
thank you very much as uh probably most
 
01:30:03.830 --> 01:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
of you probably remember um I'm
 
01:30:05.709 --> 01:30:05.719 align:start position:0%
represent Tim Horgan from stford County
 
01:30:07.990 --> 01:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
District 10 which is the town of Durham
 
01:30:11.030 --> 01:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
and I actually never have been a teacher
 
01:30:14.750 --> 01:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
but I was a uh but my uh although my uh
 
01:30:16.870 --> 01:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
father's an educator he's a professor
 
01:30:18.830 --> 01:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
and uh my actually my mother trained to
 
01:30:20.430 --> 01:30:20.440 align:start position:0%
be a teacher too and I was a student for
 
01:30:23.229 --> 01:30:23.239 align:start position:0%
many years so I know so I know I think I
 
01:30:25.870 --> 01:30:25.880 align:start position:0%
know a thing or two about this issue
 
01:30:28.910 --> 01:30:28.920 align:start position:0%
um and uh this bill you know comes at
 
01:30:30.430 --> 01:30:30.440 align:start position:0%
the height of what I only describe as
 
01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:31.910 align:start position:0%
the height of what I only describe as
Nationwide

01:30:31.910 --> 01:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
Nationwide
 
01:30:34.030 --> 01:30:34.040 align:start position:0%
anti-lgbtq Panic anti especially
 
01:30:36.390 --> 01:30:36.400 align:start position:0%
anti-gay and anti-trans panic because
 
01:30:37.870 --> 01:30:37.880 align:start position:0%
the b stands for bisexual and
 
01:30:40.270 --> 01:30:40.280 align:start position:0%
everybody's at least somewhat bisexual
 
01:30:42.390 --> 01:30:42.400 align:start position:0%
nobody's complete no straight person is
 
01:30:44.149 --> 01:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
completely straight no gay person you
 
01:30:48.149 --> 01:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
know is completely you know 100% 100%
 
01:30:50.790 --> 01:30:50.800 align:start position:0%
gays so even they have so even uh people
 
01:30:53.470 --> 01:30:53.480 align:start position:0%
so these issues are difficult for for
 
01:30:55.510 --> 01:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
any Young person and this actually isn't
 
01:30:59.510 --> 01:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
just about um you know issues about sex
 
01:31:02.149 --> 01:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
or uh or gayness or straightness because
 
01:31:05.109 --> 01:31:05.119 align:start position:0%
it it covers just about anything so it
 
01:31:06.790 --> 01:31:06.800 align:start position:0%
would make it essentially impossible for
 
01:31:08.030 --> 01:31:08.040 align:start position:0%
a child to discuss anything
 
01:31:09.390 --> 01:31:09.400 align:start position:0%
confidentially with their teachers or
 
01:31:11.830 --> 01:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
really any other adults at the
 
01:31:14.790 --> 01:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
school um any parent will be able in
 
01:31:16.510 --> 01:31:16.520 align:start position:0%
fact any parent made band report on just
 
01:31:18.189 --> 01:31:18.199 align:start position:0%
about anything going on at the child
 
01:31:19.629 --> 01:31:19.639 align:start position:0%
school that report has to come out
 
01:31:21.910 --> 01:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
within a pretty short time period 10
 
01:31:25.390 --> 01:31:25.400 align:start position:0%
business days which I um it's equivalent
 
01:31:27.590 --> 01:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
to two weeks and the report has to be
 
01:31:29.510 --> 01:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
made by the individual educator rather
 
01:31:31.310 --> 01:31:31.320 align:start position:0%
by the school even that teacher isn't
 
01:31:33.870 --> 01:31:33.880 align:start position:0%
really necessarily in a position to be
 
01:31:35.350 --> 01:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
able to definitively speak for the
 
01:31:38.669 --> 01:31:38.679 align:start position:0%
school or even you know give a useful
 
01:31:42.430 --> 01:31:42.440 align:start position:0%
answer to the question so there's many
 
01:31:44.510 --> 01:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
um there's many reasons why a young
 
01:31:45.870 --> 01:31:45.880 align:start position:0%
person might discuss something with a
 
01:31:47.510 --> 01:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
trusted adult which are not ready to
 
01:31:49.550 --> 01:31:49.560 align:start position:0%
discuss with their parents I mean even
 
01:31:52.790 --> 01:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
those of us um my parents both passed
 
01:31:55.350 --> 01:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
away but even uh you know even when I an
 
01:31:57.030 --> 01:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
even when I was an older person I
 
01:31:58.750 --> 01:31:58.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes found things hard to discuss
 
01:32:00.109 --> 01:32:00.119 align:start position:0%
with my parents that I could discuss
 
01:32:01.790 --> 01:32:01.800 align:start position:0%
more easily with with other people and
 
01:32:03.550 --> 01:32:03.560 align:start position:0%
if this becomes law confiden is only
 
01:32:05.750 --> 01:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
allow this child is at imminent risk of
 
01:32:08.750 --> 01:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
physical harm so the risk is your time
 
01:32:12.629 --> 01:32:12.639 align:start position:0%
is up anyway it's a bad idea there's uh
 
01:32:14.870 --> 01:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
just many problems it makes no provision
 
01:32:17.709 --> 01:32:17.719 align:start position:0%
for um situation where the parent ask
 
01:32:19.510 --> 01:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
for material information which violates
 
01:32:21.430 --> 01:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
the privacy of someone else's child um
 
01:32:23.070 --> 01:32:23.080 align:start position:0%
you have the written testimony I've
 
01:32:25.270 --> 01:32:25.280 align:start position:0%
actually email to everyone subm your
 
01:32:27.229 --> 01:32:27.239 align:start position:0%
pronounce and put it on the web portal
 
01:32:30.350 --> 01:32:30.360 align:start position:0%
so you have three copies of it and so
 
01:32:33.149 --> 01:32:33.159 align:start position:0%
this can't be fixed it's not needed so I
 
01:32:35.550 --> 01:32:35.560 align:start position:0%
recommend that you uh find the nhpd to
 
01:32:37.350 --> 01:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
legislate I'm glad to see thank you very
 
01:32:39.430 --> 01:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
much are there questions from the
 
01:32:41.750 --> 01:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
committee not see thank you yes it's
 
01:32:48.229 --> 01:32:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:50.430 --> 01:32:50.440 align:start position:0%
mccardy have to squeeze my three minute
 
01:32:53.189 --> 01:32:53.199 align:start position:0%
speech into a two-minute speech so I
 
01:32:55.070 --> 01:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
might have to talk a a little
 
01:32:55.080 --> 01:32:56.669 align:start position:0%
might have to talk a a little
fast

01:32:56.669 --> 01:32:56.679 align:start position:0%
fast
 
01:33:00.830 --> 01:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
so uh I'm here to oppose SP 341 you know
 
01:33:03.149 --> 01:33:03.159 align:start position:0%
every time one of these builds I'm sorry
 
01:33:05.030 --> 01:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
just give your name first please oh Kate
 
01:33:06.310 --> 01:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
mccardy I'm sorry I thought you you're
 
01:33:08.310 --> 01:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
welcome okay uh so every time one of
 
01:33:09.990 --> 01:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
these builds comes up my mind does this
 
01:33:11.709 --> 01:33:11.719 align:start position:0%
thing it starts casting about trying to
 
01:33:13.470 --> 01:33:13.480 align:start position:0%
think of some magical word or phrase
 
01:33:15.310 --> 01:33:15.320 align:start position:0%
that will end this but I'm always
 
01:33:16.709 --> 01:33:16.719 align:start position:0%
disappointed because there are no
 
01:33:18.709 --> 01:33:18.719 align:start position:0%
magical words I can say that will fix it
 
01:33:20.470 --> 01:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
but countless medical professionals
 
01:33:21.950 --> 01:33:21.960 align:start position:0%
social workers and teachers have said
 
01:33:23.990 --> 01:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
them over and over again these are
 
01:33:25.990 --> 01:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
harmful and they keep repeating that I'm
 
01:33:28.189 --> 01:33:28.199 align:start position:0%
a 911 dispatcher more times than I can
 
01:33:29.590 --> 01:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
count a caller will say I don't know
 
01:33:31.310 --> 01:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
what to do and I'll be saying all you
 
01:33:32.669 --> 01:33:32.679 align:start position:0%
need to do is listen and I'll tell you
 
01:33:34.750 --> 01:33:34.760 align:start position:0%
exactly what to do I see the same thing
 
01:33:36.590 --> 01:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
happening here half of you are saying
 
01:33:38.709 --> 01:33:38.719 align:start position:0%
trans kids what should we do and the
 
01:33:40.030 --> 01:33:40.040 align:start position:0%
professionals are all saying all you
 
01:33:41.709 --> 01:33:41.719 align:start position:0%
need to do is listen we're telling you
 
01:33:43.669 --> 01:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
exactly what to do and that should be
 
01:33:45.910 --> 01:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
enough when a bill comes before you do
 
01:33:47.470 --> 01:33:47.480 align:start position:0%
you do research do you study all the
 
01:33:49.109 --> 01:33:49.119 align:start position:0%
pros and cons do you do what we're
 
01:33:50.870 --> 01:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
trusting you to do and Trust the
 
01:33:52.270 --> 01:33:52.280 align:start position:0%
professionals the ones who know more
 
01:33:54.350 --> 01:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
about these things than anyone else or
 
01:33:55.510 --> 01:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
do you look for someone who gets their
 
01:33:57.550 --> 01:33:57.560 align:start position:0%
stories from a subreddit who provides
 
01:33:59.149 --> 01:33:59.159 align:start position:0%
only anecdotal evidence that can't be
 
01:34:01.390 --> 01:34:01.400 align:start position:0%
fact checked when did one pathological
 
01:34:03.109 --> 01:34:03.119 align:start position:0%
liar with a sandwich board become more
 
01:34:05.229 --> 01:34:05.239 align:start position:0%
of an authority on transgender issues
 
01:34:06.750 --> 01:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
than all of the professionals and the
 
01:34:08.629 --> 01:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
actual trans people who are the subject
 
01:34:11.189 --> 01:34:11.199 align:start position:0%
of these bills put together if you were
 
01:34:12.510 --> 01:34:12.520 align:start position:0%
questioned down the line about why you
 
01:34:13.910 --> 01:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
voted the way you did on these issues
 
01:34:15.870 --> 01:34:15.880 align:start position:0%
how will you answer will you be able to
 
01:34:17.470 --> 01:34:17.480 align:start position:0%
say I thought it was a bad idea because
 
01:34:19.629 --> 01:34:19.639 align:start position:0%
all of the professionals said it was or
 
01:34:21.030 --> 01:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
will you have to say I thought it was a
 
01:34:22.750 --> 01:34:22.760 align:start position:0%
good idea because the lady with the big
 
01:34:24.870 --> 01:34:24.880 align:start position:0%
sign said it was and well that's how our
 
01:34:26.910 --> 01:34:26.920 align:start position:0%
party votes New Hampshire is at a
 
01:34:29.070 --> 01:34:29.080 align:start position:0%
Crossroads make no mistake there will be
 
01:34:30.629 --> 01:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
an accounting later on when the body
 
01:34:32.350 --> 01:34:32.360 align:start position:0%
count Rises when the homeless teen
 
01:34:34.790 --> 01:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
population grows when Gen Z AG is out
 
01:34:37.189 --> 01:34:37.199 align:start position:0%
and demands answers because they will
 
01:34:38.709 --> 01:34:38.719 align:start position:0%
this generation understands that people
 
01:34:40.070 --> 01:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
don't need to dress a certain way in
 
01:34:42.030 --> 01:34:42.040 align:start position:0%
order to be respected they understand
 
01:34:43.430 --> 01:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
that simply addressing someone by the
 
01:34:45.750 --> 01:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
pronouns they choose Will Do no harm
 
01:34:47.750 --> 01:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
this generation has had enough they've
 
01:34:49.189 --> 01:34:49.199 align:start position:0%
had enough of hiding during lockdown
 
01:34:50.470 --> 01:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
drills and having to urinate in the
 
01:34:51.790 --> 01:34:51.800 align:start position:0%
litter box because they can't come out
 
01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
till it's safe and then reading the
 
01:34:55.430 --> 01:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
today that the litter boxes are to
 
01:34:56.910 --> 01:34:56.920 align:start position:0%
accommodate kids who identify
 
01:34:58.910 --> 01:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
differently because as always someone
 
01:35:00.669 --> 01:35:00.679 align:start position:0%
has to lie to try and turn the country
 
01:35:03.750 --> 01:35:03.760 align:start position:0%

oldest lgbtq plus organization and the
 
01:35:44.229 --> 01:35:44.239 align:start position:0%
we are focused on serving youth across

New Hampshire I'm here today in
 
01:35:48.070 --> 01:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
opposition to
 
01:35:51.669 --> 01:35:51.679 align:start position:0%
s341 our objections are simple and clear
 
01:35:54.350 --> 01:35:54.360 align:start position:0%
students deserve to be safe at school
 
01:35:56.109 --> 01:35:56.119 align:start position:0%
they deserve the opportunity to have
 
01:35:58.390 --> 01:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
safe and confidential conversations with
 
01:36:01.270 --> 01:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
trusted adults in preparation for having
 
01:36:02.990 --> 01:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
those conversations with their parents
 
01:36:05.310 --> 01:36:05.320 align:start position:0%
and their caregivers they deserve the
 
01:36:07.950 --> 01:36:07.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity to develop healthy autonomy
 
01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
and to advocate for their own
 
01:36:12.229 --> 01:36:12.239 align:start position:0%
well-being this bill puts the health and
 
01:36:15.189 --> 01:36:15.199 align:start position:0%
well-being of lgbtq plus students an
 
01:36:17.709 --> 01:36:17.719 align:start position:0%
already vulnerable group particularly at
 
01:36:20.629 --> 01:36:20.639 align:start position:0%
risk the language in this bill is vague
 
01:36:23.030 --> 01:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
and Broad it could be construed as a
 
01:36:25.470 --> 01:36:25.480 align:start position:0%
mandate out students to their parents
 
01:36:27.990 --> 01:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
before they are ready or in situations
 
01:36:31.030 --> 01:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
where it may be unsafe to do so we know
 
01:36:33.189 --> 01:36:33.199 align:start position:0%
that students learn best and are most
 
01:36:34.990 --> 01:36:35.000 align:start position:0%
successful in a school environment when
 
01:36:38.030 --> 01:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
they feel safe seen and protected the
 
01:36:40.070 --> 01:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
department of education's own words
 
01:36:42.510 --> 01:36:42.520 align:start position:0%
State clearly what we know to be true
 
01:36:45.430 --> 01:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
research shows that youth who can name a
 
01:36:47.790 --> 01:36:47.800 align:start position:0%
trusted adult outside of their home are
 
01:36:50.550 --> 01:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
less likely to bully or be bullied
 
01:36:53.590 --> 01:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
suffer from depression abuse substances
 
01:36:56.070 --> 01:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
be suspended expelled or drop out of
 
01:36:58.669 --> 01:36:58.679 align:start position:0%
school in short we are asking the state
 
01:37:01.149 --> 01:37:01.159 align:start position:0%
to live up to what our own doe has
 
01:37:03.629 --> 01:37:03.639 align:start position:0%
already advocated for and to protect
 
01:37:05.629 --> 01:37:05.639 align:start position:0%
their relationship between students and
 
01:37:09.270 --> 01:37:09.280 align:start position:0%
teachers including lgbtq plus students
 
01:37:11.629 --> 01:37:11.639 align:start position:0%
at se Coast outright we work to Foster
 
01:37:14.590 --> 01:37:14.600 align:start position:0%
Community empathy and understanding and
 
01:37:16.669 --> 01:37:16.679 align:start position:0%
we believe this bill is detrimental to
 
01:37:19.109 --> 01:37:19.119 align:start position:0%
that work thank you again for hearing my
 
01:37:21.390 --> 01:37:21.400 align:start position:0%
testimony this morning thank you very
 
01:37:22.950 --> 01:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
much other questions yes represent
 
01:37:25.149 --> 01:37:25.159 align:start position:0%
McDonald thank you for your M um thank
 
01:37:27.669 --> 01:37:27.679 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony and you mentioned
 
01:37:29.790 --> 01:37:29.800 align:start position:0%
that part of this bill is vague and
 
01:37:31.310 --> 01:37:31.320 align:start position:0%
would be detrimental and I'm just
 
01:37:33.229 --> 01:37:33.239 align:start position:0%
curious what portion of the bill is
 
01:37:35.550 --> 01:37:35.560 align:start position:0%
there a particular line that you find
 
01:37:38.149 --> 01:37:38.159 align:start position:0%
problematic um we believe that the
 
01:37:40.430 --> 01:37:40.440 align:start position:0%
language about completely and honestly
 
01:37:42.750 --> 01:37:42.760 align:start position:0%
is not adequately defined in the bill
 
01:37:44.550 --> 01:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
and could be misconstrued to be harmful
 
01:37:48.070 --> 01:37:48.080 align:start position:0%
to students and may I follow up yes how
 
01:37:50.070 --> 01:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
could that be misconstrued do you have a
 
01:37:51.870 --> 01:37:51.880 align:start position:0%
way that you are interpreting that you
 
01:37:53.669 --> 01:37:53.679 align:start position:0%
believe is different than what the
 
01:37:56.189 --> 01:37:56.199 align:start position:0%
sponsor intended we I think I captured
 
01:37:58.109 --> 01:37:58.119 align:start position:0%
that in my testimony but particularly
 
01:38:01.470 --> 01:38:01.480 align:start position:0%
for the the youth that we serve we have
 
01:38:04.350 --> 01:38:04.360 align:start position:0%
concerns that this could put students in
 
01:38:06.390 --> 01:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
a position where they are outed to their
 
01:38:08.990 --> 01:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
parents before they're ready to do so
 
01:38:10.669 --> 01:38:10.679 align:start position:0%
because a teacher believes that they
 
01:38:12.830 --> 01:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
need to operate within the confines of
 
01:38:14.910 --> 01:38:14.920 align:start position:0%
how this bill is written thank you
 
01:38:17.109 --> 01:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee not
 
01:38:18.750 --> 01:38:18.760 align:start position:0%
see thank you thank you very much thank
 
01:38:27.070 --> 01:38:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:31.229 --> 01:38:31.239 align:start position:0%
you pronounced my last name correctly
 
01:38:34.070 --> 01:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
yay thank you okay I'm going to
 
01:38:37.270 --> 01:38:37.280 align:start position:0%
abbreviate this for the sake of time
 
01:38:39.270 --> 01:38:39.280 align:start position:0%
I've already submitted
 
01:38:42.669 --> 01:38:42.679 align:start position:0%
online so my name is Pamela sinot and I
 
01:38:45.390 --> 01:38:45.400 align:start position:0%
live in conquer and I'm a licensed
 
01:38:47.669 --> 01:38:47.679 align:start position:0%
independent clinical social worker with
 
01:38:51.390 --> 01:38:51.400 align:start position:0%
over 26 years of experience in the field
 
01:38:53.550 --> 01:38:53.560 align:start position:0%
working with Children and adolescents
 
01:38:55.109 --> 01:38:55.119 align:start position:0%
and their
 
01:38:57.070 --> 01:38:57.080 align:start position:0%
families I have worked with several
 
01:39:00.310 --> 01:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
teens who are members of the lgbtq plus
 
01:39:03.229 --> 01:39:03.239 align:start position:0%
Community um I'm going to skip some of
 
01:39:06.149 --> 01:39:06.159 align:start position:0%
this and go straight to the two things
 
01:39:10.430 --> 01:39:10.440 align:start position:0%
that concern me about the bill one um
 
01:39:11.910 --> 01:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
this has to do with the
 
01:39:14.149 --> 01:39:14.159 align:start position:0%
language how will
 
01:39:17.149 --> 01:39:17.159 align:start position:0%
the credential holder in all likelihood
 
01:39:19.790 --> 01:39:19.800 align:start position:0%
either a teacher or a guidance counselor
 
01:39:22.510 --> 01:39:22.520 align:start position:0%
be able to determine whether or not to
 
01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:24.189 align:start position:0%
be able to determine whether or not to
disclose

01:39:24.189 --> 01:39:24.199 align:start position:0%
disclose
 
01:39:26.790 --> 01:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
um quote would put the student at
 
01:39:29.870 --> 01:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
imminent risk of physical harm abuse or
 
01:39:33.430 --> 01:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
neglect and quote and be able to make
 
01:39:36.149 --> 01:39:36.159 align:start position:0%
such a determination in less than 48
 
01:39:39.390 --> 01:39:39.400 align:start position:0%
hours in order to quote file a report
 
01:39:42.669 --> 01:39:42.679 align:start position:0%
within 48 Hours of such a
 
01:39:44.830 --> 01:39:44.840 align:start position:0%
determination such a requirement would
 
01:39:47.470 --> 01:39:47.480 align:start position:0%
further burden School staff and in
 
01:39:51.149 --> 01:39:51.159 align:start position:0%
essence force them to take on another
 
01:39:54.589 --> 01:39:54.599 align:start position:0%
role that of the quote outing plan
 
01:39:58.910 --> 01:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
Le two the one type of risk to the
 
01:40:03.229 --> 01:40:03.239 align:start position:0%
student that is not defined in SB 341 is
 
01:40:05.950 --> 01:40:05.960 align:start position:0%
what is perhaps the most common risk
 
01:40:10.030 --> 01:40:10.040 align:start position:0%
emotional abuse which can take many
 
01:40:12.709 --> 01:40:12.719 align:start position:0%
forms which can take sorry can take many
 
01:40:16.189 --> 01:40:16.199 align:start position:0%
forms the word abuse is included in the
 
01:40:19.229 --> 01:40:19.239 align:start position:0%
bill but is not defined clearly
 
01:40:21.430 --> 01:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
emotional abuse can include passive
 
01:40:24.790 --> 01:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
aggressive behaviors like stonewalling
 
01:40:27.470 --> 01:40:27.480 align:start position:0%
that is ignoring or not speaking to
 
01:40:30.669 --> 01:40:30.679 align:start position:0%
someone or excluding a child from a
 
01:40:30.679 --> 01:40:32.390 align:start position:0%
someone or excluding a child from a
family

01:40:32.390 --> 01:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
family
 
01:40:35.669 --> 01:40:35.679 align:start position:0%
activity there are many ways to express
 
01:40:38.030 --> 01:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
disapproval or
 
01:40:40.830 --> 01:40:40.840 align:start position:0%
anger I urge you to vote in opposition
 
01:40:44.470 --> 01:40:44.480 align:start position:0%

come out to others for critical reasons
 
01:42:14.589 --> 01:42:14.599 align:start position:0%
regardless of this bill this bill only
 
01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
stands to create undue fear and shed
 
01:42:20.109 --> 01:42:20.119 align:start position:0%
light on the P pervasiveness of
 
01:42:24.109 --> 01:42:24.119 align:start position:0%

Ser good morning thank you Nancy Brennan
 
01:44:11.669 --> 01:44:11.679 align:start position:0%
she her I live in weer um I have several
 
01:44:13.790 --> 01:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
problems with this bill first and
 
01:44:17.109 --> 01:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
foremost it seems to be one in a number
 
01:44:20.109 --> 01:44:20.119 align:start position:0%
of bills dealing with parental rights we
 
01:44:22.149 --> 01:44:22.159 align:start position:0%
had earlier bills where teachers were
 
01:44:23.750 --> 01:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
supposed to call
 
01:44:26.229 --> 01:44:26.239 align:start position:0%
if they learn something and now this one
 
01:44:30.870 --> 01:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
is if you are asked and I as a teacher I
 
01:44:32.990 --> 01:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
taught for many many years middle and
 
01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:34.430 align:start position:0%
taught for many many years middle and
high

01:44:34.430 --> 01:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
high
 
01:44:39.109 --> 01:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
school if I feel like there is some
 
01:44:43.390 --> 01:44:43.400 align:start position:0%
desire out there to um vilify especially
 
01:44:45.669 --> 01:44:45.679 align:start position:0%
Public School teachers and so this kind
 
01:44:48.470 --> 01:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
of a bill allows parents who are sure
 
01:44:50.350 --> 01:44:50.360 align:start position:0%
that teachers are doing this that and
 
01:44:53.750 --> 01:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
the other thing I mean I had a kid uh
 
01:44:57.270 --> 01:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
who uh came to me one day and into my
 
01:45:00.430 --> 01:45:00.440 align:start position:0%
office broke down crying because his
 
01:45:02.990 --> 01:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
parents were getting divorced he loved
 
01:45:04.470 --> 01:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
his parents he didn't know they were
 
01:45:06.709 --> 01:45:06.719 align:start position:0%
having troubles but then he heard that
 
01:45:09.189 --> 01:45:09.199 align:start position:0%
his father had had an affair and so
 
01:45:10.270 --> 01:45:10.280 align:start position:0%
telling me all this stuff and I'm
 
01:45:12.750 --> 01:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
thinking okay I mean I was listening and
 
01:45:16.350 --> 01:45:16.360 align:start position:0%
I was kind and he said and you can't
 
01:45:18.950 --> 01:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
tell anybody cuz if I tell my friends
 
01:45:21.229 --> 01:45:21.239 align:start position:0%
they'll tell their parents and if if you
 
01:45:23.310 --> 01:45:23.320 align:start position:0%
tell my mother she'll be so mad cuz she
 
01:45:26.109 --> 01:45:26.119 align:start position:0%
said don't tell anybody so I did what
 
01:45:27.750 --> 01:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
most of us who have been in these kind
 
01:45:29.870 --> 01:45:29.880 align:start position:0%
of situations did I sat with him and I
 
01:45:32.709 --> 01:45:32.719 align:start position:0%
talked to him and I listen to him and I
 
01:45:35.350 --> 01:45:35.360 align:start position:0%
convinced him to go to the guidance
 
01:45:37.830 --> 01:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
counselor but also to find a way to
 
01:45:40.430 --> 01:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
Broach it with his mother now if in the
 
01:45:43.990 --> 01:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
meantime his father had sent me a letter
 
01:45:47.709 --> 01:45:47.719 align:start position:0%
and said I know you are tutoring qu
 
01:45:51.669 --> 01:45:51.679 align:start position:0%
Chris two days a week in algebra what
 
01:45:53.870 --> 01:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
else do you talk about
 
01:45:56.830 --> 01:45:56.840 align:start position:0%
would I have to relate that story I
 
01:45:59.030 --> 01:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
think I'd be fired first and I think a
 
01:46:01.390 --> 01:46:01.400 align:start position:0%
lot of us who have dealt with delicate
 
01:46:04.629 --> 01:46:04.639 align:start position:0%
kids feel the same way one of my other
 
01:46:06.270 --> 01:46:06.280 align:start position:0%
problems with this and I have a million
 
01:46:08.310 --> 01:46:08.320 align:start position:0%
stories just like the Reps we Tau but
 
01:46:11.229 --> 01:46:11.239 align:start position:0%

this bill in 2017 Bruce L taught a

01:46:50.709 --> 01:46:50.719 align:start position:0%
explicit conversations with them and
 
01:46:52.350 --> 01:46:52.360 align:start position:0%
soliciting the students to send him
 
01:46:55.030 --> 01:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
naked phot photos of himself of
 
01:46:56.709 --> 01:46:56.719 align:start position:0%
themselves he also solicited them to
 
01:46:59.149 --> 01:46:59.159 align:start position:0%
meet with him to engage in sex on the
 
01:47:02.629 --> 01:47:02.639 align:start position:0%
app grinder in 2021 Timberland High
 
01:47:04.470 --> 01:47:04.480 align:start position:0%
School teacher David Russell was charged
 
01:47:07.149 --> 01:47:07.159 align:start position:0%
with two felony counts of sexual assault
 
01:47:08.870 --> 01:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
for inappropriately touching a
 
01:47:10.510 --> 01:47:10.520 align:start position:0%
16-year-old student he had formerly
 
01:47:12.990 --> 01:47:13.000 align:start position:0%
taught in Nashua where he was accused of
 
01:47:14.550 --> 01:47:14.560 align:start position:0%
touching young female students and
 
01:47:17.189 --> 01:47:17.199 align:start position:0%
giving them therapeutic massages
 
01:47:19.070 --> 01:47:19.080 align:start position:0%
teachers sexually abusing students is
 
01:47:21.149 --> 01:47:21.159 align:start position:0%
not uncommon these teachers are too I
 
01:47:23.229 --> 01:47:23.239 align:start position:0%
know the details of because of their
 
01:47:25.470 --> 01:47:25.480 align:start position:0%
association with my city of
 
01:47:28.350 --> 01:47:28.360 align:start position:0%
nashwa Google teachers sexually abusing
 
01:47:30.390 --> 01:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
students in New Hampshire to find many
 
01:47:33.270 --> 01:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
many more such cases many of those
 
01:47:34.870 --> 01:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
testifying saying they are concerned
 
01:47:37.950 --> 01:47:37.960 align:start position:0%
about protecting lgbtq students and that
 
01:47:40.109 --> 01:47:40.119 align:start position:0%
we should automatically trust teachers
 
01:47:42.390 --> 01:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
to do the best for their students and
 
01:47:44.109 --> 01:47:44.119 align:start position:0%
these teachers can be trusted to keep
 
01:47:47.030 --> 01:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
secrets from parents the truth is is
 
01:47:49.430 --> 01:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
that no one cares about kids more than
 
01:47:51.870 --> 01:47:51.880 align:start position:0%
their parents teachers are human and
 
01:47:53.709 --> 01:47:53.719 align:start position:0%
fallible and have much less invested in
 
01:47:56.229 --> 01:47:56.239 align:start position:0%
the well-being of students and have
 
01:47:58.950 --> 01:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
their own interests at
 
01:48:01.470 --> 01:48:01.480 align:start position:0%
heart many say The Spill undermines
 
01:48:03.030 --> 01:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
trust between students and teachers but
 
01:48:04.870 --> 01:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
those some same people think nothing of
 
01:48:06.629 --> 01:48:06.639 align:start position:0%
undermining trust between those students
 
01:48:08.830 --> 01:48:08.840 align:start position:0%
and their parents by allowing teachers
 
01:48:10.510 --> 01:48:10.520 align:start position:0%
to hide
 
01:48:12.430 --> 01:48:12.440 align:start position:0%
information children hide a lot of
 
01:48:14.229 --> 01:48:14.239 align:start position:0%
critical information from parents when
 
01:48:16.109 --> 01:48:16.119 align:start position:0%
they're taking drugs cutting themselves
 
01:48:17.870 --> 01:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
starving themselves binging purging
 
01:48:20.070 --> 01:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
driving recklessly and the list goes
 
01:48:22.390 --> 01:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
on by the same logic I've heard from
 
01:48:24.030 --> 01:48:24.040 align:start position:0%
many the fact that the child is hiding
 
01:48:25.669 --> 01:48:25.679 align:start position:0%
that from parents means that the parents
 
01:48:28.030 --> 01:48:28.040 align:start position:0%
can't be trusted with that information
 
01:48:29.109 --> 01:48:29.119 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:48:31.189 --> 01:48:31.199 align:start position:0%
ludicrous the bill says that the teacher
 
01:48:32.750 --> 01:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
does not have to tell parents anything
 
01:48:34.830 --> 01:48:34.840 align:start position:0%
until the parent inquires If the parents
 
01:48:38.390 --> 01:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
your your time is up okay anyway I think
 
01:48:40.229 --> 01:48:40.239 align:start position:0%
teacher should not be lying about these
 
01:48:40.239 --> 01:48:41.270 align:start position:0%
teacher should not be lying about these
critical

01:48:41.270 --> 01:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
critical
 
01:48:44.109 --> 01:48:44.119 align:start position:0%
issues and and because of this families
 
01:48:46.189 --> 01:48:46.199 align:start position:0%
are fleeing Public Schools if you if
 
01:48:48.070 --> 01:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
people care about public schools they
 
01:48:49.830 --> 01:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
need to win back the trust of parents
 
01:48:52.030 --> 01:48:52.040 align:start position:0%
please vote octop pass thank you are the
 
01:48:54.510 --> 01:48:54.520 align:start position:0%
are the questions from the
 
01:48:56.550 --> 01:48:56.560 align:start position:0%
committee not see you thank you very
 
01:48:58.270 --> 01:48:58.280 align:start position:0%

01:49:00.589 --> 01:49:00.599 align:start position:0%
husband Steven scar um do you have
 
01:49:02.629 --> 01:49:02.639 align:start position:0%
written uh testimony right there could
 
01:49:04.470 --> 01:49:04.480 align:start position:0%
you hand that around so we could put it
 
01:49:06.870 --> 01:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
in as anybody with written testimony
 
01:49:10.669 --> 01:49:10.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:13.229 --> 01:49:13.239 align:start position:0%
docket of the record okay I'd like to
 
01:49:24.990 --> 01:49:25.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:27.589 --> 01:49:27.599 align:start position:0%
good morning Nancy Beerman I would like
 
01:49:30.390 --> 01:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
to State first of all that teachers are
 
01:49:33.830 --> 01:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
not the kids friends and I'd also say
 
01:49:36.589 --> 01:49:36.599 align:start position:0%
they're not surrogate parents either and
 
01:49:39.030 --> 01:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
that has been stated a number of times
 
01:49:41.629 --> 01:49:41.639 align:start position:0%
today when a child enters a school that
 
01:49:43.510 --> 01:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
parent has known their child for many
 
01:49:46.669 --> 01:49:46.679 align:start position:0%
many years a teacher will know a student
 
01:49:46.679 --> 01:49:47.950 align:start position:0%
many years a teacher will know a student
for

01:49:47.950 --> 01:49:47.960 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:49:51.109 --> 01:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
maybe 180
 
01:49:55.270 --> 01:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
days 900 25 hours at that child's in the
 
01:49:57.830 --> 01:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
elementary school by the end of the year
 
01:49:59.550 --> 01:49:59.560 align:start position:0%
you don't know the history you don't
 
01:50:01.390 --> 01:50:01.400 align:start position:0%
know the child you don't know the family
 
01:50:04.109 --> 01:50:04.119 align:start position:0%
you don't know anything about that child
 
01:50:05.870 --> 01:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:50:07.990 --> 01:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
circumstances How can any teacher
 
01:50:09.470 --> 01:50:09.480 align:start position:0%
believe that they know what is best for
 
01:50:12.390 --> 01:50:12.400 align:start position:0%
any student under that time limit I have
 
01:50:15.149 --> 01:50:15.159 align:start position:0%
heard many people vilify parents and say
 
01:50:19.390 --> 01:50:19.400 align:start position:0%
parents are wrong parents rights do not
 
01:50:21.910 --> 01:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
end end when a child enters the school
 
01:50:21.920 --> 01:50:23.830 align:start position:0%
end end when a child enters the school
building

01:50:23.830 --> 01:50:23.840 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:50:26.790 --> 01:50:26.800 align:start position:0%
and from being a teacher of 15 years and
 
01:50:29.229 --> 01:50:29.239 align:start position:0%
I've taught uh students K to 12 they
 
01:50:30.830 --> 01:50:30.840 align:start position:0%
come to school they complain about their
 
01:50:30.840 --> 01:50:32.070 align:start position:0%
come to school they complain about their
parents'

01:50:32.070 --> 01:50:32.080 align:start position:0%
parents'
 
01:50:34.870 --> 01:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
decisions be from what they wear to what
 
01:50:37.550 --> 01:50:37.560 align:start position:0%
they eat to who they play with a parent
 
01:50:39.430 --> 01:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
has the right to direct their child in
 
01:50:41.189 --> 01:50:41.199 align:start position:0%
these decisions that is not the
 
01:50:44.589 --> 01:50:44.599 align:start position:0%
teacher's job it's not
 
01:50:48.109 --> 01:50:48.119 align:start position:0%
their right to do anything and say what
 
01:50:50.629 --> 01:50:50.639 align:start position:0%
is right and wrong if a teacher is
 
01:50:52.189 --> 01:50:52.199 align:start position:0%
concerned about a home situation they
 
01:50:53.990 --> 01:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
should be reporting the concern to the
 
01:50:55.990 --> 01:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate people I've also heard
 
01:50:58.910 --> 01:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
teachers saying that they're coaching
 
01:51:00.870 --> 01:51:00.880 align:start position:0%
and counseling these students again that
 
01:51:02.470 --> 01:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
is not part of your teaching certificate
 
01:51:04.270 --> 01:51:04.280 align:start position:0%
you are crossing a
 
01:51:06.750 --> 01:51:06.760 align:start position:0%
line the idea that all parents are
 
01:51:09.550 --> 01:51:09.560 align:start position:0%
guilty and presume guilty is wrong and
 
01:51:11.870 --> 01:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
any teacher who thinks that lying to a
 
01:51:15.109 --> 01:51:15.119 align:start position:0%
parent is right they are wrong I have
 
01:51:17.950 --> 01:51:17.960 align:start position:0%
never ever lied to a parent in all my
 
01:51:19.390 --> 01:51:19.400 align:start position:0%
years of teaching if a parent comes to
 
01:51:22.069 --> 01:51:22.079 align:start position:0%
me and asks about a child or a situation
 
01:51:24.629 --> 01:51:24.639 align:start position:0%
I have always told them the truth and
 
01:51:26.310 --> 01:51:26.320 align:start position:0%
the fact that we have to sit there and
 
01:51:28.830 --> 01:51:28.840 align:start position:0%
mandate teachers to tell the truth is
 
01:51:32.030 --> 01:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
just wrong thank you thank you very much
 
01:51:33.790 --> 01:51:33.800 align:start position:0%
pass the spill are there any questions
 
01:51:34.910 --> 01:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
from the
 
01:51:40.790 --> 01:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:55.990 --> 01:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:57.830 --> 01:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for taking the time to
 
01:52:00.109 --> 01:52:00.119 align:start position:0%
hear my testimony uh for the record my
 
01:52:02.350 --> 01:52:02.360 align:start position:0%
name is Courtney Reid I serve as policy
 
01:52:05.510 --> 01:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
Advocate uh at the ACLU of New Hampshire
 
01:52:09.270 --> 01:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
and we oppose this bill because it would
 
01:52:11.310 --> 01:52:11.320 align:start position:0%
uh create an unlimited burden on
 
01:52:13.990 --> 01:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
Educators with the complete and honest
 
01:52:16.310 --> 01:52:16.320 align:start position:0%
standard uh and although this bill was
 
01:52:18.470 --> 01:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
amended in the Senate it is still
 
01:52:21.030 --> 01:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
insufficient to protect students from
 
01:52:23.109 --> 01:52:23.119 align:start position:0%
harm um
 
01:52:25.830 --> 01:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
in reading this bill uh we see that it
 
01:52:29.830 --> 01:52:29.840 align:start position:0%
is uh unsafe unwelcome and
 
01:52:32.750 --> 01:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
unworkable and we've heard numerous
 
01:52:34.950 --> 01:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
times from various stakeholders in the
 
01:52:37.629 --> 01:52:37.639 align:start position:0%
state such as service providers the
 
01:52:39.350 --> 01:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
impartial Office of the office of the
 
01:52:41.950 --> 01:52:41.960 align:start position:0%
child advocate families previous
 
01:52:45.030 --> 01:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
teachers that this legislation would put
 
01:52:47.470 --> 01:52:47.480 align:start position:0%
Children at Risk specifically less than
 
01:52:49.510 --> 01:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
a month ago the office of the child
 
01:52:51.550 --> 01:52:51.560 align:start position:0%
advocate had said that this bill would
 
01:52:54.149 --> 01:52:54.159 align:start position:0%
threaten the health safety and intrinsic
 
01:52:56.510 --> 01:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
right of Granite State lgbtq residents
 
01:52:58.709 --> 01:52:58.719 align:start position:0%
and their families and that's because
 
01:53:02.669 --> 01:53:02.679 align:start position:0%
this bill isn't about uh honesty when it
 
01:53:05.709 --> 01:53:05.719 align:start position:0%
comes to asking questions from parents
 
01:53:07.950 --> 01:53:07.960 align:start position:0%
it's about putting teachers in an
 
01:53:10.430 --> 01:53:10.440 align:start position:0%
impossible and unreachable situation
 
01:53:12.189 --> 01:53:12.199 align:start position:0%
where they're being required to meddle
 
01:53:14.830 --> 01:53:14.840 align:start position:0%
in what should be private family Affairs
 
01:53:17.669 --> 01:53:17.679 align:start position:0%
and this complete and honest standard is
 
01:53:18.990 --> 01:53:19.000 align:start position:0%
something that we heard in previous
 
01:53:23.189 --> 01:53:23.199 align:start position:0%
testimony is really used in law for
 
01:53:27.109 --> 01:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
discreet requests like a list of assets
 
01:53:29.830 --> 01:53:29.840 align:start position:0%
uh or things like that not um complete
 
01:53:32.310 --> 01:53:32.320 align:start position:0%
and honest in regard to what information
 
01:53:34.470 --> 01:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
a student might have told a teacher in
 
01:53:36.229 --> 01:53:36.239 align:start position:0%
confidence or what a teacher might have
 
01:53:38.669 --> 01:53:38.679 align:start position:0%
heard uh a student say walking through
 
01:53:42.550 --> 01:53:42.560 align:start position:0%
the halls and I wanted to um pose a
 
01:53:45.350 --> 01:53:45.360 align:start position:0%
scenario where perhaps uh in compliance
 
01:53:46.189 --> 01:53:46.199 align:start position:0%
with this
 
01:53:51.589 --> 01:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
bill uh a parent puts a request asking
 
01:53:55.310 --> 01:53:55.320 align:start position:0%
uh you know several questions like uh
 
01:53:57.709 --> 01:53:57.719 align:start position:0%
what does my child have uh for lunch you
 
01:53:58.950 --> 01:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
know who do they eat lunch with what
 
01:54:01.910 --> 01:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
clubs are they in um and what sexual
 
01:54:04.510 --> 01:54:04.520 align:start position:0%
orientation is my child how is a teacher
 
01:54:06.669 --> 01:54:06.679 align:start position:0%
supposed to to answer that with this
 
01:54:08.830 --> 01:54:08.840 align:start position:0%
Omission requirement are they supposed
 
01:54:11.310 --> 01:54:11.320 align:start position:0%
to your time is up leave one push and
 
01:54:13.950 --> 01:54:13.960 align:start position:0%
blank I just wanted to express that even
 
01:54:13.960 --> 01:54:14.750 align:start position:0%
blank I just wanted to express that even
a

01:54:14.750 --> 01:54:14.760 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:54:17.030 --> 01:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
non-answer uh implies something that
 
01:54:19.310 --> 01:54:19.320 align:start position:0%
could be harmful for this for the child
 
01:54:20.870 --> 01:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
in this situation and we've heard so
 
01:54:24.390 --> 01:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
many advocates Express that uh this
 
01:54:26.270 --> 01:54:26.280 align:start position:0%
isn't enough to protect children and I I
 
01:54:28.990 --> 01:54:29.000 align:start position:0%
go at length you very your time is up
 
01:54:30.510 --> 01:54:30.520 align:start position:0%
thank you question yes representer
 
01:54:32.270 --> 01:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
Cornell Thank you thank you for your
 
01:54:35.550 --> 01:54:35.560 align:start position:0%
testimony um do you think a result of
 
01:54:37.109 --> 01:54:37.119 align:start position:0%
this I know there's the program we have
 
01:54:39.069 --> 01:54:39.079 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire you know one trusted
 
01:54:41.430 --> 01:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
adult but if this actually goes into
 
01:54:43.709 --> 01:54:43.719 align:start position:0%
effect and certified teachers not
 
01:54:45.510 --> 01:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
non-certified teachers who are also in
 
01:54:47.390 --> 01:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
the building but just the certified
 
01:54:49.149 --> 01:54:49.159 align:start position:0%
teachers who will have an Ethics
 
01:54:50.990 --> 01:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
complaint filed against them if a
 
01:54:52.990 --> 01:54:53.000 align:start position:0%
student came to a teacher
 
01:54:54.669 --> 01:54:54.679 align:start position:0%
I'm having a really big problem and I
 
01:54:55.990 --> 01:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
really need to talk to somebody said
 
01:54:59.149 --> 01:54:59.159 align:start position:0%
well don't talk to me and that and the
 
01:55:01.069 --> 01:55:01.079 align:start position:0%
student will no longer have any trusted
 
01:55:03.669 --> 01:55:03.679 align:start position:0%
adults to talk to do you think that
 
01:55:03.679 --> 01:55:04.470 align:start position:0%
adults to talk to do you think that
might

01:55:04.470 --> 01:55:04.480 align:start position:0%
might
 
01:55:06.589 --> 01:55:06.599 align:start position:0%
happen I think that this Bill thank you
 
01:55:08.950 --> 01:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
for your question I think that this bill
 
01:55:11.390 --> 01:55:11.400 align:start position:0%
puts Educators in an impossible
 
01:55:13.510 --> 01:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
situation and one of the things we
 
01:55:15.430 --> 01:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
actually saw in the teacher shortage
 
01:55:16.870 --> 01:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
report that was released just this fall
 
01:55:19.750 --> 01:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
is that bills like this um have prompted
 
01:55:22.430 --> 01:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
stress and concerns of consequences and
 
01:55:24.310 --> 01:55:24.320 align:start position:0%
is one of the reasons that educators are
 
01:55:26.830 --> 01:55:26.840 align:start position:0%
actually leaving the state and so part
 
01:55:29.149 --> 01:55:29.159 align:start position:0%
of the one trusted adult program is that
 
01:55:31.550 --> 01:55:31.560 align:start position:0%
that information is meant to stay
 
01:55:33.910 --> 01:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
between the child and the educator
 
01:55:37.310 --> 01:55:37.320 align:start position:0%
unless um there are instances of self
 
01:55:39.470 --> 01:55:39.480 align:start position:0%
harm threats to harm others you know
 
01:55:42.669 --> 01:55:42.679 align:start position:0%
typical instances that we would want to
 
01:55:44.470 --> 01:55:44.480 align:start position:0%
uh get child protective services or
 
01:55:46.669 --> 01:55:46.679 align:start position:0%
other investigations involved in but
 
01:55:48.030 --> 01:55:48.040 align:start position:0%
this I think and we've heard from the
 
01:55:49.550 --> 01:55:49.560 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill would completely
 
01:55:52.390 --> 01:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
deprive that confidentiality and take
 
01:55:55.310 --> 01:55:55.320 align:start position:0%
away that opportunity for students to um
 
01:55:57.189 --> 01:55:57.199 align:start position:0%
build up the confidence and trust with
 
01:55:59.149 --> 01:55:59.159 align:start position:0%
with people before talking to their
 
01:56:03.390 --> 01:56:03.400 align:start position:0%
parents um and I think another point of
 
01:56:06.510 --> 01:56:06.520 align:start position:0%
concern with that is that um that that
 
01:56:09.629 --> 01:56:09.639 align:start position:0%
standard is unworkable so imagine uh a
 
01:56:11.109 --> 01:56:11.119 align:start position:0%
parent hears an answer that they don't
 
01:56:13.390 --> 01:56:13.400 align:start position:0%
like who's to say whether or not that
 
01:56:16.189 --> 01:56:16.199 align:start position:0%
answer is complete or true and if there
 
01:56:17.870 --> 01:56:17.880 align:start position:0%
is a disciplinary action or the
 
01:56:20.430 --> 01:56:20.440 align:start position:0%
investigation that's listed in the bill
 
01:56:21.910 --> 01:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
there's no explicit provision in the
 
01:56:23.990 --> 01:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
bill that gives an educator an appeal
 
01:56:26.430 --> 01:56:26.440 align:start position:0%
process so I think we're hearing from
 
01:56:28.109 --> 01:56:28.119 align:start position:0%
teachers that there's a real concern
 
01:56:29.750 --> 01:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
that their careers might be on the line
 
01:56:31.669 --> 01:56:31.679 align:start position:0%
when they're just trying to to do their
 
01:56:34.629 --> 01:56:34.639 align:start position:0%
jobs um and as far as I know there's
 
01:56:39.669 --> 01:56:39.679 align:start position:0%
also been no call for this bill uh from
 
01:56:42.189 --> 01:56:42.199 align:start position:0%
Educators thank you so much thank you
 
01:56:45.310 --> 01:56:45.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:50.030 --> 01:56:50.040 align:start position:0%
leus I'm thinking about um seems that
 
01:56:51.910 --> 01:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
people are assuming that that teacher is
 
01:56:55.229 --> 01:56:55.239 align:start position:0%
the only one who knows anything about
 
01:56:59.390 --> 01:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
that kid and my question is if somebody
 
01:57:01.870 --> 01:57:01.880 align:start position:0%
else who also knows whether by
 
01:57:03.629 --> 01:57:03.639 align:start position:0%
observation or being a friend or
 
01:57:05.750 --> 01:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
whatever should happen to say something
 
01:57:07.350 --> 01:57:07.360 align:start position:0%
and the parents should happen to find
 
01:57:09.550 --> 01:57:09.560 align:start position:0%
out say a friend says something to their
 
01:57:10.950 --> 01:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
parents and the parents say something to
 
01:57:12.750 --> 01:57:12.760 align:start position:0%
the kids's
 
01:57:16.629 --> 01:57:16.639 align:start position:0%
parents and the te and the parents have
 
01:57:19.109 --> 01:57:19.119 align:start position:0%
asked the teacher the teacher hasn't
 
01:57:21.790 --> 01:57:21.800 align:start position:0%
either lied or not given a proper or or
 
01:57:24.910 --> 01:57:24.920 align:start position:0%
refused to answer the question is if
 
01:57:28.149 --> 01:57:28.159 align:start position:0%
those parents then do something harmful
 
01:57:29.790 --> 01:57:29.800 align:start position:0%
which is what we're talking about right
 
01:57:31.830 --> 01:57:31.840 align:start position:0%
if a parent does something harmful
 
01:57:35.350 --> 01:57:35.360 align:start position:0%
because they find out are they not just
 
01:57:37.950 --> 01:57:37.960 align:start position:0%
as likely to do something harmful if
 
01:57:40.870 --> 01:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
they find out from somebody else rather
 
01:57:43.229 --> 01:57:43.239 align:start position:0%
than the teacher and should not the
 
01:57:45.149 --> 01:57:45.159 align:start position:0%
parent if they think if they truly
 
01:57:46.830 --> 01:57:46.840 align:start position:0%
believe that something harmful should be
 
01:57:50.510 --> 01:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
done reported because otherwise it may
 
01:57:53.069 --> 01:57:53.079 align:start position:0%
still be done because that parent may
 
01:57:56.350 --> 01:57:56.360 align:start position:0%
find out in a different
 
01:57:58.189 --> 01:57:58.199 align:start position:0%
way thank you for your question
 
01:58:00.709 --> 01:58:00.719 align:start position:0%
representative so to follow um and
 
01:58:02.830 --> 01:58:02.840 align:start position:0%
trying to understand are you suggesting
 
01:58:06.270 --> 01:58:06.280 align:start position:0%
that it would be better for parents to
 
01:58:08.510 --> 01:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
find out from a teacher that might have
 
01:58:09.950 --> 01:58:09.960 align:start position:0%
heard something in the hallway as
 
01:58:14.030 --> 01:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
opposed to from another Community member
 
01:58:16.350 --> 01:58:16.360 align:start position:0%
no what I'm saying well it could be
 
01:58:18.470 --> 01:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
because a teacher is a mandatory
 
01:58:21.589 --> 01:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
reporter what I'm saying is if the
 
01:58:24.589 --> 01:58:24.599 align:start position:0%
teacher is legitimately afraid that
 
01:58:26.229 --> 01:58:26.239 align:start position:0%
something will happen if the parents
 
01:58:29.109 --> 01:58:29.119 align:start position:0%
find out should they not be
 
01:58:33.430 --> 01:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
reporting and will lying make that any
 
01:58:35.669 --> 01:58:35.679 align:start position:0%
different thank you for your question
 
01:58:40.189 --> 01:58:40.199 align:start position:0%
and so my understanding is that if a
 
01:58:44.229 --> 01:58:44.239 align:start position:0%
educator um who's Bound by this bill has
 
01:58:47.510 --> 01:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
a good faith determination of uh
 
01:58:49.510 --> 01:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
imminent risk of physical harm abuse or
 
01:58:52.430 --> 01:58:52.440 align:start position:0%
neglect they then put in a Report with
 
01:58:55.069 --> 01:58:55.079 align:start position:0%
ghhs and omit that
 
01:58:57.350 --> 01:58:57.360 align:start position:0%
information what we have heard from
 
01:59:00.069 --> 01:59:00.079 align:start position:0%
Advocates is that this is insufficient
 
01:59:04.589 --> 01:59:04.599 align:start position:0%
to protect youth because the uh dcyf
 
01:59:06.790 --> 01:59:06.800 align:start position:0%
only gets involved when there are
 
01:59:09.709 --> 01:59:09.719 align:start position:0%
suspected incidences of abuse
 
01:59:12.390 --> 01:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
not risks of abuse happening they only
 
01:59:14.669 --> 01:59:14.679 align:start position:0%
get involved after there have been
 
01:59:17.910 --> 01:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
reports of that abuse happening and so
 
01:59:20.149 --> 01:59:20.159 align:start position:0%
um what I was speaking to also was when
 
01:59:23.390 --> 01:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
there is a non-answer i I think we're
 
01:59:25.350 --> 01:59:25.360 align:start position:0%
Advocates are also afraid of what might
 
01:59:28.390 --> 01:59:28.400 align:start position:0%
happen um in a in a non-answer scenario
 
01:59:30.709 --> 01:59:30.719 align:start position:0%
what does that imply to a parent who
 
01:59:32.390 --> 01:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
educators are not you know trained to
 
01:59:34.350 --> 01:59:34.360 align:start position:0%
handle these intimate Affairs what is
 
01:59:36.709 --> 01:59:36.719 align:start position:0%
that what what will the response be from
 
01:59:40.109 --> 01:59:40.119 align:start position:0%
a parent um Educators really have no
 
01:59:42.870 --> 01:59:42.880 align:start position:0%
place in getting involved in what are
 
01:59:44.629 --> 01:59:44.639 align:start position:0%
very sensitive intimate family
 
01:59:47.229 --> 01:59:47.239 align:start position:0%
situations and uh I think this bill as
 
01:59:48.790 --> 01:59:48.800 align:start position:0%
we've heard from many other peoples puts
 
01:59:52.709 --> 01:59:52.719 align:start position:0%
them in a situation where they might
 
01:59:54.830 --> 01:59:54.840 align:start position:0%
unintentionally put a child at risk and
 
01:59:56.310 --> 01:59:56.320 align:start position:0%
that there aren't enough safeguards to
 
01:59:59.149 --> 01:59:59.159 align:start position:0%
prevent that from happening thank you no
 
02:00:00.910 --> 02:00:00.920 align:start position:0%
we're not going to go that uh
 
02:00:03.189 --> 02:00:03.199 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
02:00:05.189 --> 02:00:05.199 align:start position:0%
dry thank you and thank you for taking
 
02:00:07.750 --> 02:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
my question I'd like to ask a little bit
 
02:00:09.870 --> 02:00:09.880 align:start position:0%
about the one trusted adult program do
 
02:00:13.030 --> 02:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
you know much about that uh thank you I
 
02:00:14.709 --> 02:00:14.719 align:start position:0%
can try to answer your question but I
 
02:00:16.310 --> 02:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
might defer to some folks who are more
 
02:00:18.149 --> 02:00:18.159 align:start position:0%
active in the education space okay so
 
02:00:20.470 --> 02:00:20.480 align:start position:0%
I'm just reading that that two years ago
 
02:00:22.470 --> 02:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
it started to to uh
 
02:00:24.470 --> 02:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
get into the districts for training and
 
02:00:27.189 --> 02:00:27.199 align:start position:0%
I just wondered on um what the progress
 
02:00:31.069 --> 02:00:31.079 align:start position:0%
of that was and also if it does kind of
 
02:00:33.270 --> 02:00:33.280 align:start position:0%
establish confidentiality for that
 
02:00:35.270 --> 02:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
information in the training that that
 
02:00:37.189 --> 02:00:37.199 align:start position:0%
they do for
 
02:00:39.470 --> 02:00:39.480 align:start position:0%
this thank you for your question I think
 
02:00:41.149 --> 02:00:41.159 align:start position:0%
I would defer that to some other folks
 
02:00:42.709 --> 02:00:42.719 align:start position:0%
from teachers associations to better
 
02:00:45.709 --> 02:00:45.719 align:start position:0%
answer thank you represent
 
02:00:49.790 --> 02:00:49.800 align:start position:0%
ter thank you um early on in your
 
02:00:52.109 --> 02:00:52.119 align:start position:0%
testimony you used the word in
 
02:00:54.350 --> 02:00:54.360 align:start position:0%
sufficient perhaps you may
 
02:00:59.069 --> 02:00:59.079 align:start position:0%
recall and um I I remember that you
 
02:01:02.430 --> 02:01:02.440 align:start position:0%
characterized the amendment to the bill
 
02:01:05.390 --> 02:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
in the Senate and then as passed in the
 
02:01:07.189 --> 02:01:07.199 align:start position:0%
Senate as being
 
02:01:09.550 --> 02:01:09.560 align:start position:0%
insufficient uh the change being
 
02:01:11.750 --> 02:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
insufficient representing the American
 
02:01:13.830 --> 02:01:13.840 align:start position:0%
civil liberties Union I'm sure you can
 
02:01:16.390 --> 02:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
appreciate how important Precision is
 
02:01:18.270 --> 02:01:18.280 align:start position:0%
with respect to the language and the
 
02:01:20.629 --> 02:01:20.639 align:start position:0%
terms that you use so I I'm curious to
 
02:01:24.030 --> 02:01:24.040 align:start position:0%
know um what in your view the view of
 
02:01:25.870 --> 02:01:25.880 align:start position:0%
the American civil liberties Union would
 
02:01:28.390 --> 02:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
constitute sufficient
 
02:01:30.750 --> 02:01:30.760 align:start position:0%
changes uh I think that that would be a
 
02:01:32.310 --> 02:01:32.320 align:start position:0%
conversation that I would love to have
 
02:01:34.510 --> 02:01:34.520 align:start position:0%
with you and uh in addition with some
 
02:01:37.510 --> 02:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
lawyers at the ACLU I just wanted to
 
02:01:39.990 --> 02:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
Echo again that after that amendment was
 
02:01:42.430 --> 02:01:42.440 align:start position:0%
introduced we had still seen opposition
 
02:01:44.950 --> 02:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
um from a policy perspective from
 
02:01:46.390 --> 02:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
various stakeholders in New Hampshire
 
02:01:48.270 --> 02:01:48.280 align:start position:0%
which includes the office of the child
 
02:01:50.390 --> 02:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
advocate so just to be clear you're
 
02:01:51.870 --> 02:01:51.880 align:start position:0%
you're not prepared to offer any Sugg
 
02:01:54.149 --> 02:01:54.159 align:start position:0%
suggestions as to what would move in the
 
02:01:56.870 --> 02:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
direction of sufficient not at this time
 
02:01:59.550 --> 02:01:59.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:01:59.560 --> 02:02:02.350 align:start position:0%
thank you

thank you okay I'm I'm from face um just

I back on a question that you I want to
 
02:02:10.189 --> 02:02:10.199 align:start position:0%
make sure I heard it correctly the New
 
02:02:14.030 --> 02:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Department of office of
 
02:02:17.790 --> 02:02:17.800 align:start position:0%
child advocate opposes this Bill yes
 
02:02:20.189 --> 02:02:20.199 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you further questions
 
02:02:22.109 --> 02:02:22.119 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
02:02:23.350 --> 02:02:23.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
02:02:41.270 --> 02:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:43.589 --> 02:02:43.599 align:start position:0%
Hansen good morning everyone my name is
 
02:02:46.910 --> 02:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
Peter Hansen I'm a resident of Penbrook
 
02:02:50.109 --> 02:02:50.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm also the father of five uh
 
02:02:52.350 --> 02:02:52.360 align:start position:0%
my wife and I have five kids
 
02:02:55.069 --> 02:02:55.079 align:start position:0%
um so I would hope I have some vested
 
02:02:56.750 --> 02:02:56.760 align:start position:0%
interest in this conversation and
 
02:02:58.709 --> 02:02:58.719 align:start position:0%
especially in this bill I'm I'm
 
02:03:01.470 --> 02:03:01.480 align:start position:0%
commenting in support of SB
 
02:03:05.030 --> 02:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
341 um let's be honest here the trust
 
02:03:06.189 --> 02:03:06.199 align:start position:0%
between the schools and parents has
 
02:03:07.550 --> 02:03:07.560 align:start position:0%
already been broken or we wouldn't be
 
02:03:10.790 --> 02:03:10.800 align:start position:0%
having this conversation right now it's
 
02:03:12.910 --> 02:03:12.920 align:start position:0%
unfortunate but people don't always do
 
02:03:14.470 --> 02:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
the right
 
02:03:16.629 --> 02:03:16.639 align:start position:0%
thing and that's why we actually have to
 
02:03:18.589 --> 02:03:18.599 align:start position:0%
sit in the room like this today and have
 
02:03:20.510 --> 02:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
a discussion about whether a school
 
02:03:21.830 --> 02:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
official will have to tell the truth
 
02:03:25.750 --> 02:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
truth to a parent who's put in writing a
 
02:03:29.069 --> 02:03:29.079 align:start position:0%
question about their child their minor
 
02:03:31.589 --> 02:03:31.599 align:start position:0%
child not a grown-up I know some of the
 
02:03:32.669 --> 02:03:32.679 align:start position:0%
previous speakers have talked about
 
02:03:33.910 --> 02:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
grown-ups coming back to them and
 
02:03:36.310 --> 02:03:36.320 align:start position:0%
everything else we're talking about
 
02:03:39.030 --> 02:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
underage minor children who haven't
 
02:03:40.430 --> 02:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
fully developed their
 
02:03:43.709 --> 02:03:43.719 align:start position:0%
brains who have all kinds of
 
02:03:46.149 --> 02:03:46.159 align:start position:0%
ideas who are to be educated by the
 
02:03:46.159 --> 02:03:47.830 align:start position:0%
ideas who are to be educated by the
education

02:03:47.830 --> 02:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
education
 
02:03:51.229 --> 02:03:51.239 align:start position:0%
system the parents have the right to
 
02:03:54.270 --> 02:03:54.280 align:start position:0%
know what is being talked
 
02:03:58.069 --> 02:03:58.079 align:start position:0%
about by school Educators with their
 
02:04:00.310 --> 02:04:00.320 align:start position:0%
children I'm not condemning all teachers
 
02:04:02.629 --> 02:04:02.639 align:start position:0%
in this I have great relationships with
 
02:04:05.310 --> 02:04:05.320 align:start position:0%
the school that we're in there's many
 
02:04:07.109 --> 02:04:07.119 align:start position:0%
great teachers but we can't be naive
 
02:04:08.830 --> 02:04:08.840 align:start position:0%
enough to think that all teachers will
 
02:04:10.069 --> 02:04:10.079 align:start position:0%
do the right thing and make good
 
02:04:12.950 --> 02:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
decisions and not promote their own
 
02:04:16.310 --> 02:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
agendas or beliefs onto our
 
02:04:18.629 --> 02:04:18.639 align:start position:0%
children and as we all learned in school
 
02:04:20.189 --> 02:04:20.199 align:start position:0%
most laws and regulations get created
 
02:04:21.430 --> 02:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
because people don't always do the right
 
02:04:21.440 --> 02:04:22.350 align:start position:0%
because people don't always do the right
thing

02:04:22.350 --> 02:04:22.360 align:start position:0%
thing
 
02:04:24.229 --> 02:04:24.239 align:start position:0%
case in point there's been articles in
 
02:04:26.310 --> 02:04:26.320 align:start position:0%
the Chicago Sun Times New York Times
 
02:04:28.709 --> 02:04:28.719 align:start position:0%
documenting cases where parents ried to
 
02:04:30.390 --> 02:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
about their children and their
 
02:04:32.390 --> 02:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
transitioning one of those parents was
 
02:04:34.109 --> 02:04:34.119 align:start position:0%
actively engaged with the administration
 
02:04:36.189 --> 02:04:36.199 align:start position:0%
of the school regarding their child's
 
02:04:37.950 --> 02:04:37.960 align:start position:0%
well-being as she sense something was
 
02:04:40.350 --> 02:04:40.360 align:start position:0%
wrong and the school still
 
02:04:43.189 --> 02:04:43.199 align:start position:0%
withheld the information that they were
 
02:04:45.669 --> 02:04:45.679 align:start position:0%
calling that young child by a different
 
02:04:47.709 --> 02:04:47.719 align:start position:0%
name a different
 
02:04:50.589 --> 02:04:50.599 align:start position:0%
gender under her nose for over six
 
02:04:56.709 --> 02:04:56.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:59.229 --> 02:04:59.239 align:start position:0%
school in short she had to rescue her
 
02:05:04.229 --> 02:05:04.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:06.149 --> 02:05:06.159 align:start position:0%
system there was another case in
 
02:05:09.390 --> 02:05:09.400 align:start position:0%
California for two years the school had
 
02:05:10.870 --> 02:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
been calling their child by a different
 
02:05:12.669 --> 02:05:12.679 align:start position:0%
name when was she supposed to find this
 
02:05:15.310 --> 02:05:15.320 align:start position:0%
out at graduation at the graduation
 
02:05:17.109 --> 02:05:17.119 align:start position:0%
ceremony when when the name was called
 
02:05:19.669 --> 02:05:19.679 align:start position:0%
out come get your
 
02:05:22.189 --> 02:05:22.199 align:start position:0%
diploma is that appropriate
 
02:05:24.069 --> 02:05:24.079 align:start position:0%
is that what you are all advocating for
 
02:05:25.350 --> 02:05:25.360 align:start position:0%
those of you that are opposed to this
 
02:05:27.950 --> 02:05:27.960 align:start position:0%
bill that you would hide this so the
 
02:05:33.310 --> 02:05:33.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:36.189 --> 02:05:36.199 align:start position:0%
out I'm in favor of this bill because
 
02:05:38.229 --> 02:05:38.239 align:start position:0%
school officials should not have to tell
 
02:05:39.870 --> 02:05:39.880 align:start position:0%
the should have to tell the truth of ask
 
02:05:41.030 --> 02:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
they should not be in the business of
 
02:05:43.270 --> 02:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
picking and choosing to tell what
 
02:05:45.270 --> 02:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
they're going to tell the truth about
 
02:05:47.030 --> 02:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
they don't get to decide that your your
 
02:05:49.430 --> 02:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
time is up thank you I appreciate your
 
02:05:51.990 --> 02:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
time I would hope that all of you would
 
02:05:55.350 --> 02:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
vote to support this Bill thank you
 
02:05:57.750 --> 02:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee not
 
02:06:01.149 --> 02:06:01.159 align:start position:0%
see thank thank you very
 
02:06:10.510 --> 02:06:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:13.350 --> 02:06:13.360 align:start position:0%
brigata hi my name is Laura Bata um I
 
02:06:17.069 --> 02:06:17.079 align:start position:0%
live in Hudson New Hampshire um parents
 
02:06:20.229 --> 02:06:20.239 align:start position:0%
need the whole truth about their child
 
02:06:22.589 --> 02:06:22.599 align:start position:0%
teachers have if teachers have a true
 
02:06:24.910 --> 02:06:24.920 align:start position:0%
concern there's the child protective
 
02:06:27.430 --> 02:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
services angle but the idea that
 
02:06:29.669 --> 02:06:29.679 align:start position:0%
teachers are supposed to substitute
 
02:06:32.229 --> 02:06:32.239 align:start position:0%
their judgment for parents' judgment
 
02:06:34.790 --> 02:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
parents are the ones raising their
 
02:06:37.270 --> 02:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
children parents are
 
02:06:41.990 --> 02:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
invested and a lot of the talk remind
 
02:06:44.589 --> 02:06:44.599 align:start position:0%
really sounds like people don't trust
 
02:06:46.950 --> 02:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
parents and people expect parents to
 
02:06:49.229 --> 02:06:49.239 align:start position:0%
somehow be fragile children may have
 
02:06:51.149 --> 02:06:51.159 align:start position:0%
fears that oh my mom and dad they're
 
02:06:54.950 --> 02:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
going to be so upset and even if parents
 
02:06:57.390 --> 02:06:57.400 align:start position:0%
are upset or disappointed that doesn't
 
02:06:59.549 --> 02:06:59.559 align:start position:0%
mean that parents can't take it there is
 
02:07:02.589 --> 02:07:02.599 align:start position:0%
such a fragility that is being described
 
02:07:05.830 --> 02:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
here um that I I really questioned so
 
02:07:09.069 --> 02:07:09.079 align:start position:0%
again please support the bill and
 
02:07:10.950 --> 02:07:10.960 align:start position:0%

02:07:12.950 --> 02:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
children thank you thank you very much

for good morning and thank you for
 
02:07:39.750 --> 02:07:39.760 align:start position:0%

name is Emma Sven I'm the children's
 
02:07:42.589 --> 02:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health policy coordinator at
 
02:07:45.069 --> 02:07:45.079 align:start position:0%
new Futures new Futures solves Pol uh
 
02:07:46.750 --> 02:07:46.760 align:start position:0%
solves problems through policy change
 
02:07:49.549 --> 02:07:49.559 align:start position:0%
and is supportive of a robust and strong
 
02:07:52.149 --> 02:07:52.159 align:start position:0%
system of care for children new Futures
 
02:07:54.229 --> 02:07:54.239 align:start position:0%
is here in opposition of Senate Bill 341
 
02:07:55.510 --> 02:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
because it discourages students from
 
02:07:57.229 --> 02:07:57.239 align:start position:0%
establishing support networks outside of
 
02:07:58.750 --> 02:07:58.760 align:start position:0%
their families which has been shown to
 
02:08:00.149 --> 02:08:00.159 align:start position:0%
improve mental health outcomes for
 
02:08:02.310 --> 02:08:02.320 align:start position:0%
students who experience mental health
 
02:08:02.320 --> 02:08:03.990 align:start position:0%
students who experience mental health
challenges

02:08:03.990 --> 02:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
challenges
 
02:08:06.990 --> 02:08:07.000 align:start position:0%
um as you'll see in my testimony the
 
02:08:11.229 --> 02:08:11.239 align:start position:0%
rates of depression suicidality anxiety
 
02:08:13.030 --> 02:08:13.040 align:start position:0%
and other concerning mental health
 
02:08:16.669 --> 02:08:16.679 align:start position:0%
conditions are are very high for lgbtq
 
02:08:19.149 --> 02:08:19.159 align:start position:0%
Youth and this is a direct response to
 
02:08:22.709 --> 02:08:22.719 align:start position:0%
feelings of um discrimination against
 
02:08:26.310 --> 02:08:26.320 align:start position:0%
them when they when lgbtq young people
 
02:08:28.310 --> 02:08:28.320 align:start position:0%
feel supported in their communities
 
02:08:30.470 --> 02:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
schools and with their parents they have
 
02:08:32.870 --> 02:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
mental health outcomes on par with their
 
02:08:37.149 --> 02:08:37.159 align:start position:0%
peers it is clear that when lgbtq kids
 
02:08:40.390 --> 02:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
are outed to their parents prior to
 
02:08:43.510 --> 02:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
their um feeling ready to they have
 
02:08:46.270 --> 02:08:46.280 align:start position:0%
higher levels of depressive symptoms and
 
02:08:48.189 --> 02:08:48.199 align:start position:0%
lower amounts of family support than
 
02:08:50.350 --> 02:08:50.360 align:start position:0%
those who wait and come out at their own
 
02:08:53.350 --> 02:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
time and when they are fully
 
02:08:56.990 --> 02:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
comfortable um for those reasons new
 
02:08:59.390 --> 02:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
Futures opposes this spill and would ask
 
02:09:01.910 --> 02:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
the committee to vote uh itl I'm happy
 
02:09:03.750 --> 02:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
to take any questions thank you very
 
02:09:06.109 --> 02:09:06.119 align:start position:0%
much are there any questions from the
 
02:09:08.149 --> 02:09:08.159 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing you thank you very
 
02:09:13.990 --> 02:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:29.870 --> 02:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:32.629 --> 02:09:32.639 align:start position:0%
yeah so I didn't turn the last one off
 
02:09:36.950 --> 02:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:39.549 --> 02:09:39.559 align:start position:0%
started good morning good morning Mr
 
02:09:41.189 --> 02:09:41.199 align:start position:0%
chairman my name is David Trumble I'm
 
02:09:42.709 --> 02:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
from the town of we and I oppose this
 
02:09:44.990 --> 02:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
bill for two reasons first children
 
02:09:47.669 --> 02:09:47.679 align:start position:0%
should be able to live honestly and have
 
02:09:50.390 --> 02:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
a say in matters about their own lives
 
02:09:52.990 --> 02:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang's of the world is that a 16
 
02:09:55.910 --> 02:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
or 17year old is
 
02:09:58.629 --> 02:09:58.639 align:start position:0%
legally an infant they have no more
 
02:10:02.149 --> 02:10:02.159 align:start position:0%
rights than a kindergartener in his view
 
02:10:04.950 --> 02:10:04.960 align:start position:0%
the trust relationship is solely between
 
02:10:07.589 --> 02:10:07.599 align:start position:0%
the school and the parents there is zero
 
02:10:10.109 --> 02:10:10.119 align:start position:0%
room for children in Senator Lang's view
 
02:10:12.510 --> 02:10:12.520 align:start position:0%
of the world that does not make sense if
 
02:10:14.870 --> 02:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
you've raised teenagers you know that
 
02:10:16.750 --> 02:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
they grow up and start to have a say in
 
02:10:19.310 --> 02:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
their own life also New Hampshire law
 
02:10:22.030 --> 02:10:22.040 align:start position:0%
supports that notion when it's divorce
 
02:10:23.830 --> 02:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
cases the Supreme Court of this state
 
02:10:25.790 --> 02:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
has held that by the time they're 13 or
 
02:10:29.430 --> 02:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
14 children's interests and statements
 
02:10:32.229 --> 02:10:32.239 align:start position:0%
about what they want take precedent in
 
02:10:35.229 --> 02:10:35.239 align:start position:0%
special education law by the time
 
02:10:37.069 --> 02:10:37.079 align:start position:0%
children are in the eighth G grade
 
02:10:38.790 --> 02:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
they're encouraged to participate in
 
02:10:42.229 --> 02:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
their IEPs Senator Lang says though that
 
02:10:46.270 --> 02:10:46.280 align:start position:0%
until year 17 in 364 days you have no
 
02:10:48.910 --> 02:10:48.920 align:start position:0%
rights as a child the second problem
 
02:10:51.310 --> 02:10:51.320 align:start position:0%
with this bill is that it will break up
 
02:10:54.669 --> 02:10:54.679 align:start position:0%
amilies this bill is not all about
 
02:10:56.910 --> 02:10:56.920 align:start position:0%
mandatory reporters it creates a brand
 
02:11:00.229 --> 02:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
new category of mandatory reporters in
 
02:11:03.430 --> 02:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
169c you're a mandatory reporter if the
 
02:11:06.350 --> 02:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
abuse or neglect has already happened if
 
02:11:09.149 --> 02:11:09.159 align:start position:0%
there's evidence of it this bill says if
 
02:11:12.709 --> 02:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
a teacher thinks there may be imminent
 
02:11:16.149 --> 02:11:16.159 align:start position:0%
risk of harm they have to report so take
 
02:11:18.790 --> 02:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
an example child says I don't think my
 
02:11:21.830 --> 02:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
dad can handle knowing that I'm LGBT Q
 
02:11:23.589 --> 02:11:23.599 align:start position:0%
he'll throw me out of the house so the
 
02:11:25.149 --> 02:11:25.159 align:start position:0%
teacher says I don't really think I
 
02:11:27.549 --> 02:11:27.559 align:start position:0%
should tell the dad there's nobody's
 
02:11:29.189 --> 02:11:29.199 align:start position:0%
been thrown out of the house already
 
02:11:31.149 --> 02:11:31.159 align:start position:0%
it's a risk that the child might be
 
02:11:32.870 --> 02:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
thrown out of the house but under this
 
02:11:36.109 --> 02:11:36.119 align:start position:0%
bill mandatory reporting that has to be
 
02:11:38.470 --> 02:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
filed with the the government that leads
 
02:11:41.030 --> 02:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
to a mandatory investigation all kinds
 
02:11:43.750 --> 02:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
of procedures that would be is that my
 
02:11:46.270 --> 02:11:46.280 align:start position:0%
time you have a very good ears Mr
 
02:11:49.549 --> 02:11:49.559 align:start position:0%

02:11:52.400 --> 02:11:53.390 align:start position:0%
the end of your time okay any questions
for

02:11:53.390 --> 02:11:53.400 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:11:56.229 --> 02:11:56.239 align:start position:0%
David thank you very much you're welcome
 
02:12:07.589 --> 02:12:07.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:09.870 --> 02:12:09.880 align:start position:0%
jackow hello members of the committee my
 
02:12:12.830 --> 02:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
name is Lind Jak house I am in
 
02:12:14.589 --> 02:12:14.599 align:start position:0%
opposition to SP
 
02:12:17.149 --> 02:12:17.159 align:start position:0%
341 the individuals in support of this
 
02:12:19.669 --> 02:12:19.679 align:start position:0%
bill are portraying this bill as a do
 
02:12:21.669 --> 02:12:21.679 align:start position:0%
not lie to parents bill
 
02:12:23.470 --> 02:12:23.480 align:start position:0%
if this were simply a bill that stated
 
02:12:25.950 --> 02:12:25.960 align:start position:0%
that the many lgbtq people you see here
 
02:12:27.790 --> 02:12:27.800 align:start position:0%
in opposition today would not be an
 
02:12:30.270 --> 02:12:30.280 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill this bill
 
02:12:32.270 --> 02:12:32.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't explicitly name situations
 
02:12:35.629 --> 02:12:35.639 align:start position:0%
related to lgbtq youth like last year's
 
02:12:37.950 --> 02:12:37.960 align:start position:0%
sb272 but we know that the effect of
 
02:12:40.350 --> 02:12:40.360 align:start position:0%
forced outing will be the same this is
 
02:12:41.990 --> 02:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
not just if a student confides in a
 
02:12:44.189 --> 02:12:44.199 align:start position:0%
school employee this is expecting all
 
02:12:46.189 --> 02:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
Educators to report anything that they
 
02:12:48.549 --> 02:12:48.559 align:start position:0%
may have overheard regarding students
 
02:12:50.390 --> 02:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
how do students feel safe at school when
 
02:12:51.830 --> 02:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
they feel like the people around them
 
02:12:54.390 --> 02:12:54.400 align:start position:0%
could report anything they say most
 
02:12:56.589 --> 02:12:56.599 align:start position:0%
likely teachers will have to record many
 
02:12:59.350 --> 02:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
details of sensitive conversations and
 
02:13:01.109 --> 02:13:01.119 align:start position:0%
in the event that they are asked by a
 
02:13:03.669 --> 02:13:03.679 align:start position:0%
parent and when students see them doing
 
02:13:05.229 --> 02:13:05.239 align:start position:0%
that they will be less likely to have
 
02:13:07.069 --> 02:13:07.079 align:start position:0%
necessary conversations with trusted
 
02:13:09.629 --> 02:13:09.639 align:start position:0%
adults this bill will have a chilling
 
02:13:12.549 --> 02:13:12.559 align:start position:0%
effect Additionally the language around
 
02:13:14.950 --> 02:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
reporting cases of abuse and neglect is
 
02:13:17.430 --> 02:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
unworkable this bill requires Educators
 
02:13:19.709 --> 02:13:19.719 align:start position:0%
to submit a report to DHHS if they
 
02:13:21.589 --> 02:13:21.599 align:start position:0%
believe abuse or neglect could take
 
02:13:24.910 --> 02:13:24.920 align:start position:0%
place however DHHS does not respond to
 
02:13:27.629 --> 02:13:27.639 align:start position:0%
reports of potential abuse or neglect
 
02:13:28.950 --> 02:13:28.960 align:start position:0%
these children will be failed if there
 
02:13:31.350 --> 02:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
is not extremely strong evidence of
 
02:13:34.069 --> 02:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
abuse or neglect parents and teachers
 
02:13:35.950 --> 02:13:35.960 align:start position:0%
should be partners this bill assumes
 
02:13:37.870 --> 02:13:37.880 align:start position:0%
that they are adversaries and puts pits
 
02:13:39.990 --> 02:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
them against each other teachers should
 
02:13:41.870 --> 02:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
be able to say that's really a
 
02:13:43.270 --> 02:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
conversation you should have with their
 
02:13:45.149 --> 02:13:45.159 align:start position:0%
child if parents are asking if their
 
02:13:46.350 --> 02:13:46.360 align:start position:0%
child is
 
02:13:49.189 --> 02:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
lgbtq many lgbtq young people feel a
 
02:13:50.790 --> 02:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
strong need to come out to peers first
 
02:13:52.390 --> 02:13:52.400 align:start position:0%
for regardless of whether or not their
 
02:13:54.709 --> 02:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
parents are affirming when I realized
 
02:13:56.149 --> 02:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
that I liked girls when I was in high
 
02:13:57.750 --> 02:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
school I knew it wasn't safe to come out
 
02:13:59.669 --> 02:13:59.679 align:start position:0%
to my dad and I planned to come out to
 
02:14:01.149 --> 02:14:01.159 align:start position:0%
him only after I was no longer
 
02:14:03.549 --> 02:14:03.559 align:start position:0%
financially reliant on him when my
 
02:14:05.189 --> 02:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
father did find out I had feelings for
 
02:14:06.709 --> 02:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
my best friend by hacking into my
 
02:14:08.709 --> 02:14:08.719 align:start position:0%
personal internet accounts he told me
 
02:14:10.830 --> 02:14:10.840 align:start position:0%
that I was disgusting and immoral and
 
02:14:12.990 --> 02:14:13.000 align:start position:0%
that's not how I was raised took away my
 
02:14:14.229 --> 02:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
phone and there was a moment when I
 
02:14:15.790 --> 02:14:15.800 align:start position:0%
thought I might be sent to conversion
 
02:14:18.669 --> 02:14:18.679 align:start position:0%
therapy which was leg very time is up
 
02:14:19.830 --> 02:14:19.840 align:start position:0%

strong Advocate from my children from
 
02:15:53.669 --> 02:15:53.679 align:start position:0%
the moment they entered my world I have
 
02:15:55.350 --> 02:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
never felt they belong to me they are
 
02:15:57.629 --> 02:15:57.639 align:start position:0%
not my possessions I've always called
 
02:15:59.350 --> 02:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
them my little people as they are just
 
02:16:01.629 --> 02:16:01.639 align:start position:0%
that their own person I believe they
 
02:16:03.549 --> 02:16:03.559 align:start position:0%
have the same rights as we as adults
 
02:16:05.310 --> 02:16:05.320 align:start position:0%
have and as parents we are here to see
 
02:16:07.430 --> 02:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
that they are allowed these rights I did
 
02:16:08.990 --> 02:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
not become a parent to control their
 
02:16:11.669 --> 02:16:11.679 align:start position:0%
path and future I was not aware that my
 
02:16:13.470 --> 02:16:13.480 align:start position:0%
now 17-year-old had been experiencing
 
02:16:16.069 --> 02:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
gender dysphoria since the age of 13
 
02:16:17.870 --> 02:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
feeling lost in their own body they
 
02:16:19.350 --> 02:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
struggled to even look at themselves in
 
02:16:21.430 --> 02:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
the mirror but yet I didn't not hear of
 
02:16:24.030 --> 02:16:24.040 align:start position:0%
this until their 16th year last summer
 
02:16:26.030 --> 02:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
my team was in such a dark place that
 
02:16:27.629 --> 02:16:27.639 align:start position:0%
they tried to take their own life while
 
02:16:29.589 --> 02:16:29.599 align:start position:0%
feeling incredibly isolated and alone in
 
02:16:31.750 --> 02:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
their thoughts today they have the full
 
02:16:33.389 --> 02:16:33.399 align:start position:0%
support of their parents their family
 
02:16:35.270 --> 02:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
and their friends as they begin their
 
02:16:36.669 --> 02:16:36.679 align:start position:0%
own journey to living in a body that
 
02:16:38.589 --> 02:16:38.599 align:start position:0%
feels more like their home beginning
 
02:16:40.429 --> 02:16:40.439 align:start position:0%
hormone replacement therapy in January
 
02:16:44.349 --> 02:16:44.359 align:start position:0%
of 24 in October 23 they asked us all to
 
02:16:46.950 --> 02:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
begin using they them pronouns I cannot
 
02:16:48.469 --> 02:16:48.479 align:start position:0%
help but think how they would have felt
 
02:16:49.830 --> 02:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
if they had reached out to someone
 
02:16:52.429 --> 02:16:52.439 align:start position:0%
sooner if my teen had chosen to speak to
 
02:16:53.950 --> 02:16:53.960 align:start position:0%
one of their teachers and ask them to
 
02:16:55.629 --> 02:16:55.639 align:start position:0%
use they them pronouns before they were
 
02:16:58.110 --> 02:16:58.120 align:start position:0%
ready to ask me to use new pronouns I
 
02:16:59.469 --> 02:16:59.479 align:start position:0%
can say with confidence that I would
 
02:17:01.030 --> 02:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
have felt incredibly thankful for the
 
02:17:03.589 --> 02:17:03.599 align:start position:0%
support of their teachers being able to
 
02:17:05.070 --> 02:17:05.080 align:start position:0%
share who you are with the world is
 
02:17:07.589 --> 02:17:07.599 align:start position:0%
incredibly important to all human beings
 
02:17:09.870 --> 02:17:09.880 align:start position:0%
feeling accepted and uplifted by others
 
02:17:11.589 --> 02:17:11.599 align:start position:0%
when sharing who we are is one of the
 
02:17:13.669 --> 02:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
healthiest experiences we can have of as
 
02:17:16.110 --> 02:17:16.120 align:start position:0%
people having the support accessible in
 
02:17:17.709 --> 02:17:17.719 align:start position:0%
any and every way is essential to
 
02:17:19.349 --> 02:17:19.359 align:start position:0%
allowing all people to thrive in their
 
02:17:21.830 --> 02:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
own lives as a parent I do not feel
 
02:17:23.230 --> 02:17:23.240 align:start position:0%
threatened or negated by others
 
02:17:24.950 --> 02:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
supporting my children I am grateful
 
02:17:26.389 --> 02:17:26.399 align:start position:0%
every day that each of them feel the
 
02:17:28.309 --> 02:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
love that others may have for them and I
 
02:17:29.750 --> 02:17:29.760 align:start position:0%

to testify I'm Michelle VY the executive
 
02:18:08.309 --> 02:18:08.319 align:start position:0%
director of New Hampshire businesses for
 
02:18:10.790 --> 02:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
social responsibility we represent
 
02:18:12.950 --> 02:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
businesses and organizations across the
 
02:18:15.309 --> 02:18:15.319 align:start position:0%
state that create jobs products and
 
02:18:17.429 --> 02:18:17.439 align:start position:0%
services that support the residents of
 
02:18:20.230 --> 02:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire our employees
 
02:18:22.870 --> 02:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
their family Ames and and their friends
 
02:18:26.389 --> 02:18:26.399 align:start position:0%
are members of the lgbtq plus Community
 
02:18:28.190 --> 02:18:28.200 align:start position:0%
we know that it's important for each of
 
02:18:30.870 --> 02:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
us to feel safe and in control of our
 
02:18:33.709 --> 02:18:33.719 align:start position:0%
personal lives and to be valued for our
 
02:18:37.669 --> 02:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
authentic selves our businesses and our
 
02:18:40.750 --> 02:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
workplaces are constrained we are having
 
02:18:44.750 --> 02:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
a tough time finding enough employees to
 
02:18:47.190 --> 02:18:47.200 align:start position:0%
be productive businesses within the
 
02:18:50.230 --> 02:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
state we are also businesses and you can
 
02:18:51.950 --> 02:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
see by the letter that you hold in your
 
02:18:54.669 --> 02:18:54.679 align:start position:0%
hand we are businesses that care very
 
02:18:57.629 --> 02:18:57.639 align:start position:0%
deeply about having inclusive um
 
02:18:59.870 --> 02:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
environments for our employees and
 
02:19:02.070 --> 02:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
inclusive environments for their
 
02:19:04.709 --> 02:19:04.719 align:start position:0%
families we therefore stand in
 
02:19:07.389 --> 02:19:07.399 align:start position:0%
opposition to SB
 
02:19:10.389 --> 02:19:10.399 align:start position:0%
341 we hope to continue to thrive and
 
02:19:13.309 --> 02:19:13.319 align:start position:0%
grow as companies in the state but we
 
02:19:15.669 --> 02:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
are troubled by the drum beat a proposed
 
02:19:17.629 --> 02:19:17.639 align:start position:0%
legislation in the state house that
 
02:19:21.230 --> 02:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
unfairly targets lgbtq individuals
 
02:19:24.309 --> 02:19:24.319 align:start position:0%
particularly transgender youth these
 
02:19:27.790 --> 02:19:27.800 align:start position:0%
bills aim to limit access to services
 
02:19:30.669 --> 02:19:30.679 align:start position:0%
and support for for these children to be
 
02:19:34.429 --> 02:19:34.439 align:start position:0%
able to talk to a trusted adult so I
 
02:19:36.870 --> 02:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
hope that you will reconsider if you are
 
02:19:38.830 --> 02:19:38.840 align:start position:0%
considering voting in favor of this
 
02:19:41.469 --> 02:19:41.479 align:start position:0%
reconsider that all of our residents
 
02:19:43.389 --> 02:19:43.399 align:start position:0%
have rights and that we should not
 
02:19:46.549 --> 02:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
Advance discriminatory measures against
 
02:19:49.070 --> 02:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
any of our residents thank you very much
 
02:19:51.150 --> 02:19:51.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there questions
 
02:19:51.950 --> 02:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
from the
 
02:19:54.830 --> 02:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
committee yes representa Damon thank you
 
02:19:56.710 --> 02:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you taking my question
 
02:19:59.469 --> 02:19:59.479 align:start position:0%
certainly could you comment about the
 
02:20:01.469 --> 02:20:01.479 align:start position:0%
impact of legislation similar to this in
 
02:20:03.590 --> 02:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
other community in other states rather
 
02:20:06.030 --> 02:20:06.040 align:start position:0%
that have passed this kind of leg
 
02:20:08.389 --> 02:20:08.399 align:start position:0%
legislation how it has economically
 
02:20:10.309 --> 02:20:10.319 align:start position:0%
affected say North
 
02:20:12.870 --> 02:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
Carolina um so I'm assuming you're
 
02:20:14.670 --> 02:20:14.680 align:start position:0%
talking about the bathroom bill in North
 
02:20:17.070 --> 02:20:17.080 align:start position:0%
Carolina there are several States um and
 
02:20:18.710 --> 02:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
it's it's a concern of ours I didn't
 
02:20:20.750 --> 02:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
want to go directly to the money side of
 
02:20:24.270 --> 02:20:24.280 align:start position:0%
things but it definitely impacts um the
 
02:20:26.110 --> 02:20:26.120 align:start position:0%
economy of the state going forward
 
02:20:28.830 --> 02:20:28.840 align:start position:0%
because there are several organizations
 
02:20:31.469 --> 02:20:31.479 align:start position:0%
you can go online and there are hundreds
 
02:20:33.790 --> 02:20:33.800 align:start position:0%
of Executives from National companies
 
02:20:37.150 --> 02:20:37.160 align:start position:0%
that have signed um letters of support
 
02:20:39.110 --> 02:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
saying that they will not they support
 
02:20:39.120 --> 02:20:39.790 align:start position:0%
saying that they will not they support
the

02:20:39.790 --> 02:20:39.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:20:42.309 --> 02:20:42.319 align:start position:0%
lgbtq uh plus community and that they
 
02:20:45.590 --> 02:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
will not hold events in states where
 
02:20:48.870 --> 02:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
there is um there are laws that act
 
02:20:51.389 --> 02:20:51.399 align:start position:0%
against or discriminate against certain
 
02:20:53.469 --> 02:20:53.479 align:start position:0%
members of the community that is an
 
02:20:56.030 --> 02:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
issue that we are very concerned about
 
02:20:58.790 --> 02:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
because of our workforces we live as you
 
02:21:01.630 --> 02:21:01.640 align:start position:0%
know New England is a small region where
 
02:21:04.790 --> 02:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
our our people can easily transfer or go
 
02:21:07.190 --> 02:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
to other states in their job and so to
 
02:21:10.230 --> 02:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
to have a state that has an image that
 
02:21:13.830 --> 02:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
is regressive and and pushes back on
 
02:21:15.910 --> 02:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
certain people within our in in our
 
02:21:18.590 --> 02:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
environment is not healthy for business
 
02:21:21.190 --> 02:21:21.200 align:start position:0%
we want to have diverse work forces and
 
02:21:24.870 --> 02:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
we hope that um by having those divver
 
02:21:26.830 --> 02:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
diverse workforces we can continue to
 
02:21:29.990 --> 02:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
see Innovation that is allowed by that
 
02:21:32.070 --> 02:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
safety that everyone feels both within
 
02:21:33.630 --> 02:21:33.640 align:start position:0%
their communities and within their
 
02:21:35.990 --> 02:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
workforces and we feel it's important
 
02:21:38.389 --> 02:21:38.399 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire maintain the status
 
02:21:40.550 --> 02:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
that was created back in 2018 when
 
02:21:42.790 --> 02:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
governor sununu and the Republican
 
02:21:46.150 --> 02:21:46.160 align:start position:0%
legislature promised to have safy
 
02:21:48.910 --> 02:21:48.920 align:start position:0%
safeguards for everyone in our economy
 
02:21:52.270 --> 02:21:52.280 align:start position:0%
including the trans Community thank you
 
02:21:53.550 --> 02:21:53.560 align:start position:0%

I'd like to follow up just a little bit
 
02:21:59.830 --> 02:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
on the on the last response you just
 
02:22:02.230 --> 02:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
gave I just want to be clear uh are you
 
02:22:05.429 --> 02:22:05.439 align:start position:0%
testifying that there are Financial
 
02:22:08.950 --> 02:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
concerns from either NOS or perhaps
 
02:22:10.790 --> 02:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
sanctions by other states or the federal
 
02:22:13.270 --> 02:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
government that that are a negative
 
02:22:15.790 --> 02:22:15.800 align:start position:0%
economic uh impact should legislation
 
02:22:18.910 --> 02:22:18.920 align:start position:0%
like this pass there has been pass
 
02:22:21.950 --> 02:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
legislation impact in this session where
 
02:22:25.230 --> 02:22:25.240 align:start position:0%
there were um potential Financial
 
02:22:27.870 --> 02:22:27.880 align:start position:0%
impacts but um I'm not specifically
 
02:22:29.429 --> 02:22:29.439 align:start position:0%
speaking to that when I speak about
 
02:22:31.309 --> 02:22:31.319 align:start position:0%
other states what I'm saying is that
 
02:22:33.510 --> 02:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
there are organizations that hold
 
02:22:37.670 --> 02:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
conventions um or hold um uh corporate
 
02:22:39.349 --> 02:22:39.359 align:start position:0%
uh meetings so bring together all of
 
02:22:42.190 --> 02:22:42.200 align:start position:0%
their employees from various locations
 
02:22:44.510 --> 02:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
um that there is an economic impact when
 
02:22:48.550 --> 02:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
a state has laws that um discriminate
 
02:22:49.870 --> 02:22:49.880 align:start position:0%
against certain people in our
 
02:22:49.880 --> 02:22:52.150 align:start position:0%
against certain people in our
environment

02:22:52.150 --> 02:22:52.160 align:start position:0%
environment
 
02:22:53.870 --> 02:22:53.880 align:start position:0%

worker um so I came here today to talk
 
02:24:05.870 --> 02:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
about the big issue um which is bottom
 
02:24:09.510 --> 02:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
line let's not promote
 
02:24:13.429 --> 02:24:13.439 align:start position:0%
deception and untruths to our children
 
02:24:17.269 --> 02:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
children learn what they live if we as a
 
02:24:20.389 --> 02:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
teacher as a social worker as a child
 
02:24:25.550 --> 02:24:25.560 align:start position:0%
protective service worker if we help to
 
02:24:28.910 --> 02:24:28.920 align:start position:0%
deceive parents what do we modeling to
 
02:24:35.070 --> 02:24:35.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:38.710 --> 02:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
secrets a 15-year-old is having a sexual
 
02:24:41.429 --> 02:24:41.439 align:start position:0%
relationship with an 18-year-old and the
 
02:24:43.590 --> 02:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
parent says you're not allowed to see
 
02:24:46.070 --> 02:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
that person so the parent writes a
 
02:24:49.150 --> 02:24:49.160 align:start position:0%
letter to the school and says is this
 
02:24:51.349 --> 02:24:51.359 align:start position:0%
going on well teacher doesn't want to be
 
02:24:51.359 --> 02:24:52.150 align:start position:0%
going on well teacher doesn't want to be
a

02:24:52.150 --> 02:24:52.160 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:24:55.630 --> 02:24:55.640 align:start position:0%
tattletail is that okay because if that
 
02:24:57.990 --> 02:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
15-year-old gets pregnant it's the
 
02:25:01.269 --> 02:25:01.279 align:start position:0%
parents that are going to be financially
 
02:25:03.190 --> 02:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
responsible and it will be that
 
02:25:06.429 --> 02:25:06.439 align:start position:0%
18-year-olds P 18-year-old who will
 
02:25:09.630 --> 02:25:09.640 align:start position:0%
become a sexual offend on potentially
 
02:25:12.429 --> 02:25:12.439 align:start position:0%
become on the sexual offender list for
 
02:25:14.710 --> 02:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
the rest of their life that's the kind
 
02:25:18.950 --> 02:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
of impact not passing this bill will
 
02:25:22.190 --> 02:25:22.200 align:start position:0%
have for the the people of New Hampshire
 
02:25:24.710 --> 02:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
I listened to a lot of people at I
 
02:25:26.550 --> 02:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
didn't even know that the transgender
 
02:25:28.150 --> 02:25:28.160 align:start position:0%
issue was going to come up and I'll be
 
02:25:30.750 --> 02:25:30.760 align:start position:0%
honest with you the bottom line is is as
 
02:25:33.309 --> 02:25:33.319 align:start position:0%
a social worker as someone who studied
 
02:25:37.150 --> 02:25:37.160 align:start position:0%
psychology um unfortunately perpetrators
 
02:25:39.710 --> 02:25:39.720 align:start position:0%
seek out their victims where they are
 
02:25:43.510 --> 02:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
most likely to not get caught and to
 
02:25:43.520 --> 02:25:44.429 align:start position:0%
most likely to not get caught and to
have

02:25:44.429 --> 02:25:44.439 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:25:48.269 --> 02:25:48.279 align:start position:0%
access so when I hear confidentiality
 
02:25:50.429 --> 02:25:50.439 align:start position:0%
I'm almost done when I hear conf
 
02:25:52.910 --> 02:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
confidentiality is an issue between
 
02:25:55.510 --> 02:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
between teacher and student your your
 
02:25:58.870 --> 02:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
time is up that's concerning I would
 
02:26:01.309 --> 02:26:01.319 align:start position:0%
hope that people pay attention to the
 
02:26:03.830 --> 02:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
people that are speaking in opposition
 
02:26:07.269 --> 02:26:07.279 align:start position:0%
to this bill and do your research on
 
02:26:09.230 --> 02:26:09.240 align:start position:0%
what their intent is behind that
 
02:26:11.269 --> 02:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
opposition are there any questions from
 
02:26:13.910 --> 02:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
the committee not see thank you very
 
02:26:32.870 --> 02:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:34.750 --> 02:26:34.760 align:start position:0%
uh good morning M good morning Mr
 
02:26:36.510 --> 02:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
chairman for the record Brian Hawkins
 
02:26:38.110 --> 02:26:38.120 align:start position:0%
representing Nea New
 
02:26:40.990 --> 02:26:41.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um parents and Educators have
 
02:26:42.870 --> 02:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
been working well together for a long
 
02:26:44.630 --> 02:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
time in the state and we should be
 
02:26:47.349 --> 02:26:47.359 align:start position:0%
passing bills to further support this
 
02:26:50.469 --> 02:26:50.479 align:start position:0%
relationship and not fracture it with uh
 
02:26:52.990 --> 02:26:53.000 align:start position:0%
confusing and intimidating legislation
 
02:26:55.590 --> 02:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
such as Senate Bill 341 it was mentioned
 
02:26:57.510 --> 02:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
earlier that the teacher shortage
 
02:26:59.670 --> 02:26:59.680 align:start position:0%
committee report found that quote
 
02:27:01.030 --> 02:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
classroom teachers are feeling and
 
02:27:02.910 --> 02:27:02.920 align:start position:0%
Reporting stress and concerns for a
 
02:27:05.349 --> 02:27:05.359 align:start position:0%
consequence as a result of legislation
 
02:27:08.230 --> 02:27:08.240 align:start position:0%
proposed and pass in our state house um
 
02:27:10.349 --> 02:27:10.359 align:start position:0%
and that is resulting in teachers
 
02:27:12.110 --> 02:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
leaving the profession we feel that this
 
02:27:13.590 --> 02:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
bill would fit right in with that type
 
02:27:16.870 --> 02:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
of legislation it should be asked uh
 
02:27:18.910 --> 02:27:18.920 align:start position:0%
what are people seeking to achieve by
 
02:27:21.349 --> 02:27:21.359 align:start position:0%
passing this legislation that cannot be
 
02:27:23.710 --> 02:27:23.720 align:start position:0%
accomplished today uh as I mentioned
 
02:27:25.269 --> 02:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
Educators welcome the discussion and
 
02:27:27.389 --> 02:27:27.399 align:start position:0%
questions about how their child is doing
 
02:27:29.790 --> 02:27:29.800 align:start position:0%
in their class from parents um if
 
02:27:31.910 --> 02:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
there's an answer to a question given by
 
02:27:34.150 --> 02:27:34.160 align:start position:0%
a teacher that somehow unsatisfactory to
 
02:27:37.550 --> 02:27:37.560 align:start position:0%
a parent of a student um then they have
 
02:27:39.429 --> 02:27:39.439 align:start position:0%
recourse through their principal and
 
02:27:40.950 --> 02:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
through established processes in the
 
02:27:43.670 --> 02:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
school I'm going to skip over to keep uh
 
02:27:46.269 --> 02:27:46.279 align:start position:0%
to my time um couple of key questions I
 
02:27:48.870 --> 02:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
just wanted to mention first who in the
 
02:27:50.630 --> 02:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
in the bill language who is the AR of
 
02:27:53.830 --> 02:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
what is material information uh or
 
02:27:55.150 --> 02:27:55.160 align:start position:0%
whether an inquiry is answered
 
02:27:57.750 --> 02:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
completely or not during the Senate uh
 
02:27:59.910 --> 02:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
hearing even the Department of Education
 
02:28:02.510 --> 02:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
testified that honestly and completely
 
02:28:05.389 --> 02:28:05.399 align:start position:0%
standard was subjective uh and would be
 
02:28:06.870 --> 02:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
difficult to enforce and I urge you to
 
02:28:08.630 --> 02:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
look at the senate committee report uh
 
02:28:12.630 --> 02:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
which outlines that um in that um
 
02:28:15.110 --> 02:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
attorney F advised that the complete and
 
02:28:16.870 --> 02:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
honest standard was unclear in its
 
02:28:19.790 --> 02:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
origin seemed subjective and difficult
 
02:28:21.269 --> 02:28:21.279 align:start position:0%
to force and that's from the senate
 
02:28:24.030 --> 02:28:24.040 align:start position:0%
committee report um the that language
 
02:28:26.150 --> 02:28:26.160 align:start position:0%
has not changed from the way the Senate
 
02:28:28.710 --> 02:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
amended the bill secondly uh completely
 
02:28:30.630 --> 02:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
and honestly to the extent permitted by
 
02:28:33.349 --> 02:28:33.359 align:start position:0%
state or federal law I'll wrap up is
 
02:28:35.510 --> 02:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
also concerning be regarding the
 
02:28:37.830 --> 02:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
position the educator is placed in here
 
02:28:39.870 --> 02:28:39.880 align:start position:0%
so now an educator juggling competing
 
02:28:42.190 --> 02:28:42.200 align:start position:0%
interests determining what is material
 
02:28:43.790 --> 02:28:43.800 align:start position:0%
and then deciding what is a complete
 
02:28:45.950 --> 02:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
answer and whether too much detail
 
02:28:48.190 --> 02:28:48.200 align:start position:0%
violates some state or federal law that
 
02:28:50.469 --> 02:28:50.479 align:start position:0%
they may not be aware of and at a
 
02:28:52.070 --> 02:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
determination whether a complete
 
02:28:55.429 --> 02:28:55.439 align:start position:0%
disclosure might risk their students
 
02:28:55.439 --> 02:28:57.309 align:start position:0%
disclosure might risk their students
safety

02:28:57.309 --> 02:28:57.319 align:start position:0%
safety
 
02:28:59.429 --> 02:28:59.439 align:start position:0%
and do you have that written is that
 
02:29:00.790 --> 02:29:00.800 align:start position:0%
written testim I do have some written
 
02:29:02.590 --> 02:29:02.600 align:start position:0%
testimony that I was referencing yes
 
02:29:03.910 --> 02:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I'm happy to hand that
 
02:29:06.070 --> 02:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
make sure that we get one up here yes
 
02:29:08.110 --> 02:29:08.120 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from the committee
 
02:29:10.349 --> 02:29:10.359 align:start position:0%
yes representa dry thank you thank you
 
02:29:14.070 --> 02:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
for taking my commit uh question um I do
 
02:29:15.870 --> 02:29:15.880 align:start position:0%
have a question about a place where you
 
02:29:19.030 --> 02:29:19.040 align:start position:0%
can't get information if you ask and our
 
02:29:21.870 --> 02:29:21.880 align:start position:0%
school in my district has two policies
 
02:29:24.429 --> 02:29:24.439 align:start position:0%
one is the jbab policy that says gender
 
02:29:27.550 --> 02:29:27.560 align:start position:0%
identity is not revealed unless to to
 
02:29:30.710 --> 02:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
anyone including the parents unless the
 
02:29:32.790 --> 02:29:32.800 align:start position:0%
the student agrees and the other is a
 
02:29:35.790 --> 02:29:35.800 align:start position:0%
form to fill out about gender identity
 
02:29:39.469 --> 02:29:39.479 align:start position:0%
that has lists your pronouns and name
 
02:29:42.750 --> 02:29:42.760 align:start position:0%
but does not require a parent signature
 
02:29:45.750 --> 02:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
just a faculty or staff signature and a
 
02:29:48.830 --> 02:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
and a and a student signature so I'm I'm
 
02:29:50.870 --> 02:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
wondering if that falls in the category
 
02:29:52.269 --> 02:29:52.279 align:start position:0%
of information that could be asked for
 
02:29:53.790 --> 02:29:53.800 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't be
 
02:29:56.469 --> 02:29:56.479 align:start position:0%
given I think those
 
02:30:00.110 --> 02:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
issues fall under different bills that
 
02:30:03.469 --> 02:30:03.479 align:start position:0%
this legislature has rejected actually
 
02:30:07.750 --> 02:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
um and so uh again one of the concerns
 
02:30:09.670 --> 02:30:09.680 align:start position:0%
around this bill is that this is not
 
02:30:11.910 --> 02:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
just addressing uh what is allowable and
 
02:30:14.110 --> 02:30:14.120 align:start position:0%
not allowable under a Schoolboard policy
 
02:30:16.590 --> 02:30:16.600 align:start position:0%
this goes directly to the educator uh
 
02:30:20.630 --> 02:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
and and goes bypasses uh a typical
 
02:30:22.550 --> 02:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
process that a school employee would
 
02:30:24.190 --> 02:30:24.200 align:start position:0%
follow if they're trying to if there's a
 
02:30:26.389 --> 02:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
question they're like I'm not sure about
 
02:30:29.750 --> 02:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
this um that they would follow this this
 
02:30:33.670 --> 02:30:33.680 align:start position:0%
puts the the pressure the impetus solely
 
02:30:35.150 --> 02:30:35.160 align:start position:0%
on the
 
02:30:37.630 --> 02:30:37.640 align:start position:0%
educator yes okay so the person you're
 
02:30:39.150 --> 02:30:39.160 align:start position:0%
asking saying I don't know about you're
 
02:30:41.150 --> 02:30:41.160 align:start position:0%
talking about the teacher would have
 
02:30:43.150 --> 02:30:43.160 align:start position:0%
process thank you thank you further
 
02:30:46.389 --> 02:30:46.399 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee represent
 
02:30:48.550 --> 02:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you Mr Hawkins for being
 
02:30:51.910 --> 02:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
here um I like to go back to a phrase
 
02:30:54.150 --> 02:30:54.160 align:start position:0%
you said is where make sure have
 
02:30:56.030 --> 02:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
accurate you were talking about the
 
02:30:57.590 --> 02:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
Senate report testimony it's already
 
02:31:01.349 --> 02:31:01.359 align:start position:0%
been recorded and and you stated who
 
02:31:03.309 --> 02:31:03.319 align:start position:0%
spoke this phrase and I just trying to
 
02:31:05.790 --> 02:31:05.800 align:start position:0%
get back to that hear quite well and it
 
02:31:08.950 --> 02:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
was that the phraseology of complete and
 
02:31:10.510 --> 02:31:10.520 align:start position:0%
honest is
 
02:31:13.750 --> 02:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
unclear um where did that come from sure
 
02:31:16.790 --> 02:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
um so in the Senate hearing um that came
 
02:31:19.790 --> 02:31:19.800 align:start position:0%
from the Department um in when you look
 
02:31:21.710 --> 02:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
at at the Senate report and and my uhu
 
02:31:23.550 --> 02:31:23.560 align:start position:0%
my written testimony references this as
 
02:31:27.070 --> 02:31:27.080 align:start position:0%
well um the the testimony that day was
 
02:31:28.790 --> 02:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
given by um attorney Fenton at the
 
02:31:29.870 --> 02:31:29.880 align:start position:0%

02:31:44.590 --> 02:31:44.600 align:start position:0%
Kagel I hope I'm saying it right is that
 
02:31:52.030 --> 02:31:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:54.030 --> 02:31:54.040 align:start position:0%
good morning um good morning my name is
 
02:31:56.790 --> 02:31:56.800 align:start position:0%
Lissa Kagel I am a educator a lifelong
 
02:31:59.469 --> 02:31:59.479 align:start position:0%
educator and um thank you for hearing my
 
02:32:03.790 --> 02:32:03.800 align:start position:0%
testimony today I um I didn't prepare
 
02:32:06.230 --> 02:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
anything formal I wanted to mention uh I
 
02:32:09.309 --> 02:32:09.319 align:start position:0%
am I have worked in four states uh as as
 
02:32:10.790 --> 02:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
an educator a speech language
 
02:32:13.230 --> 02:32:13.240 align:start position:0%
pathologist and uh when I came to New
 
02:32:15.269 --> 02:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a couple years back I was told
 
02:32:17.030 --> 02:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
I had to take a suicide prevention
 
02:32:19.670 --> 02:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
course for students I have never had to
 
02:32:21.309 --> 02:32:21.319 align:start position:0%
take that before I know of course we
 
02:32:25.070 --> 02:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
have to do child abuse reporting etc etc
 
02:32:26.790 --> 02:32:26.800 align:start position:0%
um and I learned that New Hampshire has
 
02:32:28.349 --> 02:32:28.359 align:start position:0%
a higher rate of suicide than other
 
02:32:31.389 --> 02:32:31.399 align:start position:0%
states and that was uh alarming to me
 
02:32:33.150 --> 02:32:33.160 align:start position:0%
working with children seeing that that's
 
02:32:36.710 --> 02:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
a real risk um and then I learned that
 
02:32:40.429 --> 02:32:40.439 align:start position:0%
um lgbtq plus children are at an even
 
02:32:43.230 --> 02:32:43.240 align:start position:0%
increased risk of for suicide based on
 
02:32:44.910 --> 02:32:44.920 align:start position:0%
the Discrimination they face on a daily

uh thank you to the committee for
 
02:33:24.389 --> 02:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
hearing my testimony for the record my
 
02:33:26.750 --> 02:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
name is Lyn cier Stanley I am a social
 
02:33:28.550 --> 02:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
worker and I'm the executive director of
 
02:33:30.070 --> 02:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
the National Association of Social
 
02:33:32.990 --> 02:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
Workers New Hampshire chapter and I I
 
02:33:35.910 --> 02:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
live here in conquer uh we are in
 
02:33:39.670 --> 02:33:39.680 align:start position:0%
opposition to se uh Senate Bill
 
02:33:43.550 --> 02:33:43.560 align:start position:0%
341 uh social workers who work in the
 
02:33:46.830 --> 02:33:46.840 align:start position:0%
school are also certified they fall
 
02:33:51.429 --> 02:33:51.439 align:start position:0%
under this category um and our our
 
02:33:55.510 --> 02:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
primary concern is that this if this
 
02:33:58.429 --> 02:33:58.439 align:start position:0%
were to become law it puts a
 
02:34:01.469 --> 02:34:01.479 align:start position:0%
law in the middle of best
 
02:34:06.110 --> 02:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
practice it acts against best practice
 
02:34:09.710 --> 02:34:09.720 align:start position:0%
if a student is in danger
 
02:34:12.469 --> 02:34:12.479 align:start position:0%
confidentiality goes out the
 
02:34:16.469 --> 02:34:16.479 align:start position:0%
window if a
 
02:34:19.469 --> 02:34:19.479 align:start position:0%
student confides in a teacher a social
 
02:34:21.190 --> 02:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
work worker a nurse anyone who's
 
02:34:22.790 --> 02:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
certified within the
 
02:34:27.150 --> 02:34:27.160 align:start position:0%
school and then the parents reach out to
 
02:34:27.160 --> 02:34:29.150 align:start position:0%
school and then the parents reach out to
that

02:34:29.150 --> 02:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:34:32.790 --> 02:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
individual If the child is not ready to
 
02:34:35.070 --> 02:34:35.080 align:start position:0%
talk and it is let's be clear it is
 
02:34:37.070 --> 02:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
developmentally appropriate for
 
02:34:39.590 --> 02:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
adolescents to seek out other trusted
 
02:34:42.590 --> 02:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
adults before or in lie of talking to
 
02:34:45.190 --> 02:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
their own parents it takes out any of
 
02:34:49.150 --> 02:34:49.160 align:start position:0%
that ability for the social worker or
 
02:34:50.150 --> 02:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
the teach
 
02:34:52.870 --> 02:34:52.880 align:start position:0%
to be able to say I think you should
 
02:34:56.269 --> 02:34:56.279 align:start position:0%
talk to your child about this or to work
 
02:34:59.870 --> 02:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
with that that student to get ready to
 
02:35:03.590 --> 02:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
talk to the to their parents I will I'm
 
02:35:06.510 --> 02:35:06.520 align:start position:0%

thank you for hearing
 
02:35:21.880 --> 02:35:24.349 align:start position:0%
thank you for hearing
me

02:35:24.349 --> 02:35:24.359 align:start position:0%
me
 
02:35:26.750 --> 02:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
oops I'm probably the oldest guy here I
 
02:35:28.710 --> 02:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
live in New Hampshire all my life I'm 76
 
02:35:31.030 --> 02:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
years old I was homophobic before my
 
02:35:33.710 --> 02:35:33.720 align:start position:0%
daughter came out to me when I was 44 so
 
02:35:36.150 --> 02:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
she probably told teachers and stuff uh
 
02:35:38.269 --> 02:35:38.279 align:start position:0%
that she was it was not to my knowledge
 
02:35:39.630 --> 02:35:39.640 align:start position:0%
and I'm glad that it was because I
 
02:35:40.830 --> 02:35:40.840 align:start position:0%
probably wasn't ready took me three
 
02:35:43.670 --> 02:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
years of counseling and now I I support
 
02:35:46.950 --> 02:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
lgbtq I go to gay pride parades Etc uh
 
02:35:49.269 --> 02:35:49.279 align:start position:0%
to me outing a person is the worst thing
 
02:35:51.349 --> 02:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
anybody can do with somebody that's
 
02:35:52.790 --> 02:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
that's terrible terrible for them it's
 
02:35:54.590 --> 02:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
psychologically terrible you cannot do
 
02:35:56.349 --> 02:35:56.359 align:start position:0%
that if you really care about children
 
02:35:57.950 --> 02:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
or even adults that don't want to be out
 
02:36:00.070 --> 02:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
it you cannot do that that harms them
 
02:36:01.950 --> 02:36:01.960 align:start position:0%
like nothing else you can do to them so
 
02:36:04.830 --> 02:36:04.840 align:start position:0%
I urge that you vote against this bill
 
02:36:06.469 --> 02:36:06.479 align:start position:0%
uh to me children are trying to figure
 
02:36:08.990 --> 02:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
out who they are and where they belong
 
02:36:11.590 --> 02:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
curiosity of sexual orientation sexual
 
02:36:14.550 --> 02:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
identity gender identity expression the
 
02:36:16.870 --> 02:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
true crisis of belonging place where
 
02:36:20.070 --> 02:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
they can feel and feel safe and belong
 
02:36:22.150 --> 02:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
and I know a lot of people talked about
 
02:36:24.190 --> 02:36:24.200 align:start position:0%
teachers ver versus parents it should be
 
02:36:26.269 --> 02:36:26.279 align:start position:0%
kind of both but I think teachers are
 
02:36:28.230 --> 02:36:28.240 align:start position:0%
certified they have all kinds of kids
 
02:36:30.150 --> 02:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
that they have to deal with from Liberal
 
02:36:33.710 --> 02:36:33.720 align:start position:0%
to conservative from one religion to
 
02:36:35.429 --> 02:36:35.439 align:start position:0%
another religion they have to deal with
 
02:36:37.349 --> 02:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
all of them and they they know how to do
 
02:36:39.469 --> 02:36:39.479 align:start position:0%
it and they I really believe in them as
 
02:36:40.550 --> 02:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
a matter of fact when you think of it
 
02:36:42.030 --> 02:36:42.040 align:start position:0%
Jesus was called teacher I really
 
02:36:44.030 --> 02:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
believe in teachers and I think they
 
02:36:46.030 --> 02:36:46.040 align:start position:0%
mean the best of course there's I can
 
02:36:48.469 --> 02:36:48.479 align:start position:0%
always give you uh incidences of where
 
02:36:50.150 --> 02:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
teachers were bad but I can do the same
 
02:36:52.469 --> 02:36:52.479 align:start position:0%
thing with priests and boy scout leaders
 
02:36:55.110 --> 02:36:55.120 align:start position:0%
etc etc you know to me generally
 
02:36:58.429 --> 02:36:58.439 align:start position:0%
teachers are fine they mean well and uh
 
02:37:00.389 --> 02:37:00.399 align:start position:0%
I I dealt in literally where a kid I had
 
02:37:01.870 --> 02:37:01.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of problems with him I went to see
 
02:37:04.070 --> 02:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
the father when I met the father I knew
 
02:37:05.590 --> 02:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
right away that kid would get beaten if
 
02:37:07.070 --> 02:37:07.080 align:start position:0%
I complained about him so I just said oh
 
02:37:09.710 --> 02:37:09.720 align:start position:0%
he's a good kid so they're not parents
 
02:37:11.269 --> 02:37:11.279 align:start position:0%
are not all perfect teachers are not all
 
02:37:13.190 --> 02:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
perfect but in general they're trained
 
02:37:16.190 --> 02:37:16.200 align:start position:0%
on how to take care of people so uh this
 
02:37:19.469 --> 02:37:19.479 align:start position:0%
is not the age of uh Leave It to Beaver
 
02:37:21.269 --> 02:37:21.279 align:start position:0%
parents and all like that and and also
 
02:37:23.070 --> 02:37:23.080 align:start position:0%
what if parents a divorce is a teacher
 
02:37:25.429 --> 02:37:25.439 align:start position:0%
required to tell every parent mix mixed
 
02:37:27.670 --> 02:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
marriages um to me that's all but you
 
02:37:29.750 --> 02:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
cannot hurt people like this do not do
 
02:37:31.950 --> 02:37:31.960 align:start position:0%
that to people please uh the other thing
 
02:37:34.590 --> 02:37:34.600 align:start position:0%
I want to tell you as I uh I'm a Vietnam
 
02:37:36.309 --> 02:37:36.319 align:start position:0%
veteran I I was attached to the green

02:37:44.670 --> 02:37:44.680 align:start position:0%

02:37:46.710 --> 02:37:46.720 align:start position:0%
your service okay any questions from the
 
02:37:46.720 --> 02:37:50.150 align:start position:0%
your service okay any questions from the
committee

02:37:50.150 --> 02:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:59.190 --> 02:37:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:01.389 --> 02:38:01.399 align:start position:0%
chz good morning honorable members of
 
02:38:03.269 --> 02:38:03.279 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm Remy Jac a high school
 
02:38:05.110 --> 02:38:05.120 align:start position:0%
senior from Newbury here to testify
 
02:38:08.990 --> 02:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
against HB or SB 341 I'm wish to bring
 
02:38:10.150 --> 02:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
attention to the fact that those who
 
02:38:11.990 --> 02:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
would be most affected by this bill
 
02:38:14.110 --> 02:38:14.120 align:start position:0%
children in unsafe home environments who
 
02:38:16.630 --> 02:38:16.640 align:start position:0%
cannot come out at home are unable to be
 
02:38:18.990 --> 02:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
here to testify against this bill
 
02:38:21.230 --> 02:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
ideally all parents would care for their
 
02:38:22.950 --> 02:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
children and support them for who they
 
02:38:26.510 --> 02:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
are but we do not live in a perfect
 
02:38:28.630 --> 02:38:28.640 align:start position:0%
world I've had friends who have been
 
02:38:30.469 --> 02:38:30.479 align:start position:0%
driven to the brink of suicide from
 
02:38:32.710 --> 02:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
verbal abuse from their parents but who
 
02:38:34.190 --> 02:38:34.200 align:start position:0%
have been able to live on because of
 
02:38:36.590 --> 02:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
their ability to live their true selves
 
02:38:40.110 --> 02:38:40.120 align:start position:0%
and connect with those at school parent
 
02:38:43.469 --> 02:38:43.479 align:start position:0%
teachers friends CPS intervention is
 
02:38:45.710 --> 02:38:45.720 align:start position:0%
rarely called in against verbal abuse
 
02:38:47.910 --> 02:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
primarily against physical abuse but for
 
02:38:51.630 --> 02:38:51.640 align:start position:0%
lgbtq youth suicide is the greatest risk
 
02:38:54.030 --> 02:38:54.040 align:start position:0%
and suicide is something primarily
 
02:38:57.230 --> 02:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
driven by emotional and verbal
 
02:38:59.510 --> 02:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
problems they cannot be here today
 
02:39:01.670 --> 02:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
because some of them are not allowed to
 
02:39:03.510 --> 02:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
leave their home and go places without
 
02:39:05.389 --> 02:39:05.399 align:start position:0%
direct permission from their parents so
 
02:39:06.990 --> 02:39:07.000 align:start position:0%
I urge you to protect those who are
 
02:39:10.590 --> 02:39:10.600 align:start position:0%
unable to be here to protect themselves
 
02:39:13.469 --> 02:39:13.479 align:start position:0%

02:39:57.469 --> 02:39:57.479 align:start position:0%
are focused on growth and students
 
02:39:59.950 --> 02:39:59.960 align:start position:0%
should be focused on learning um and we
 
02:40:03.950 --> 02:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
think that uh SB 341 um does not promote
 
02:40:07.309 --> 02:40:07.319 align:start position:0%
that environment um since teachers are
 
02:40:10.030 --> 02:40:10.040 align:start position:0%
mandated reporters this bill does not
 
02:40:13.349 --> 02:40:13.359 align:start position:0%
protect uh a child's safety it allows a
 
02:40:16.590 --> 02:40:16.600 align:start position:0%
vehicle of abuse uh and distrust between
 
02:40:19.510 --> 02:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
teachers and students uh school is often
 
02:40:21.429 --> 02:40:21.439 align:start position:0%
space as we've already heard from for
 
02:40:24.309 --> 02:40:24.319 align:start position:0%
lgbtq students to have an opportunity to
 
02:40:26.950 --> 02:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
live as their authentic selves um if
 
02:40:29.710 --> 02:40:29.720 align:start position:0%
their home does not allow them to do so
 
02:40:31.429 --> 02:40:31.439 align:start position:0%
um and many teachers across New
 
02:40:33.389 --> 02:40:33.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire serve as a safe person to talk
 
02:40:35.830 --> 02:40:35.840 align:start position:0%
to uh and for students to express
 
02:40:38.309 --> 02:40:38.319 align:start position:0%
themselves to uh and parents already
 
02:40:39.790 --> 02:40:39.800 align:start position:0%
have the comfort of knowing that those
 
02:40:42.269 --> 02:40:42.279 align:start position:0%
teachers are required to disclose any
 
02:40:44.990 --> 02:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
dangerous activity any activity which
 
02:40:46.870 --> 02:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
could be harming their children or or
 
02:40:48.790 --> 02:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
allowing their children to harm others
 
02:40:50.230 --> 02:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
uh thanks to mandated reporting but
 
02:40:53.070 --> 02:40:53.080 align:start position:0%
outside of danger uh those students have
 
02:40:54.990 --> 02:40:55.000 align:start position:0%
the freedom of exploring and presenting
 
02:40:57.349 --> 02:40:57.359 align:start position:0%
themselves how they how they want to uh
 
02:40:59.190 --> 02:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
and they also have the freedom to choose
 
02:41:00.269 --> 02:41:00.279 align:start position:0%
uh when they want to talk to their
 
02:41:03.230 --> 02:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
parents about certain subjects um so I
 
02:41:05.349 --> 02:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
could go on but I think I'll keep it
 
02:41:07.670 --> 02:41:07.680 align:start position:0%

the program so it would be successful is
 
02:43:41.230 --> 02:43:41.240 align:start position:0%

boys that are you know they wouldn't say
 
02:43:59.070 --> 02:43:59.080 align:start position:0%
that out loud to me because they knew
 
02:44:02.469 --> 02:44:02.479 align:start position:0%
better I had the whole starting lineup
 
02:44:05.309 --> 02:44:05.319 align:start position:0%
in arnut Cracker the first
 
02:44:08.190 --> 02:44:08.200 align:start position:0%
year because we were able to have open
 
02:44:10.670 --> 02:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
conversations and we were able to break
 
02:44:12.630 --> 02:44:12.640 align:start position:0%
barriers that just have existed in these
 
02:44:14.710 --> 02:44:14.720 align:start position:0%
spaces for much too
 
02:44:14.720 --> 02:44:17.469 align:start position:0%
spaces for much too
long

02:44:17.469 --> 02:44:17.479 align:start position:0%

for a lot of kids I've had thousands of
 
02:44:32.269 --> 02:44:32.279 align:start position:0%
students um in my 15-year career as a
 
02:44:35.070 --> 02:44:35.080 align:start position:0%
teacher I've received letters after
 
02:44:37.070 --> 02:44:37.080 align:start position:0%
they've graduated met up with them to
 
02:44:46.670 --> 02:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:49.070 --> 02:44:49.080 align:start position:0%
today because of the experiences they
 
02:44:51.190 --> 02:44:51.200 align:start position:0%
they had the conversations we were able
 
02:44:53.830 --> 02:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
to have and because they knew though
 
02:44:55.910 --> 02:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
they had yet to come out at that point
 
02:44:59.150 --> 02:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:02.790 --> 02:45:02.800 align:start position:0%

community when my child was in sixth
 
02:45:16.710 --> 02:45:16.720 align:start position:0%
grade I had a parent teacher conference
 
02:45:19.190 --> 02:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
yeah and the the teacher was telling me
 
02:45:23.830 --> 02:45:23.840 align:start position:0%
about how my child was um really into
 
02:45:28.510 --> 02:45:28.520 align:start position:0%
advocacy great student great reader um
 
02:45:31.510 --> 02:45:31.520 align:start position:0%

hearts and uh it took me offg guard I
 
02:45:50.910 --> 02:45:50.920 align:start position:0%
wasn't expecting to hear that I look
 
02:45:53.790 --> 02:45:53.800 align:start position:0%
back on that moment in hindsight um you
 
02:45:56.269 --> 02:45:56.279 align:start position:0%
know I think the teacher thought that I
 
02:45:58.429 --> 02:45:58.439 align:start position:0%
knew because of who I am because of who
 
02:46:01.030 --> 02:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
we are it's just that I didn't and she
 
02:46:03.230 --> 02:46:03.240 align:start position:0%
took the opportunity for my child to
 
02:46:05.190 --> 02:46:05.200 align:start position:0%
share the single most important part of
 
02:46:06.710 --> 02:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
their identity that they were grappling
 
02:46:09.630 --> 02:46:09.640 align:start position:0%
with in that moment from my child and
 
02:46:12.070 --> 02:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
from our family it was a private
 
02:46:14.110 --> 02:46:14.120 align:start position:0%
conversation that my child should have
 
02:46:16.670 --> 02:46:16.680 align:start position:0%
been able to have had on their own time
 
02:46:19.030 --> 02:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
with their own agency with their mother
 
02:46:20.670 --> 02:46:20.680 align:start position:0%

02:46:26.990 --> 02:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
up do you want to conclude or um I just
 
02:46:29.429 --> 02:46:29.439 align:start position:0%

um I appreciate I appreciate your time
 
02:46:33.870 --> 02:46:33.880 align:start position:0%
but I wanted to make sure that that was
 
02:46:35.510 --> 02:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
clear I also want to add one more thing
 
02:46:38.269 --> 02:46:38.279 align:start position:0%

02:46:40.790 --> 02:46:40.800 align:start position:0%

terms of intersection right also uh a
 
02:46:48.269 --> 02:46:48.279 align:start position:0%
Korean as well um when we talk about
 
02:46:59.790 --> 02:46:59.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:06.110 --> 02:47:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:08.630 --> 02:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
waited in the emergency room with my
 
02:47:15.670 --> 02:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:18.150 --> 02:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
bed and I had a conversation with my
 
02:47:21.550 --> 02:47:21.560 align:start position:0%
child before I came here to have this
 
02:47:23.429 --> 02:47:23.439 align:start position:0%
conversation you know growing up in New
 
02:47:26.309 --> 02:47:26.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is hard and when laws like
 
02:47:29.030 --> 02:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
this made by adults like you come out it
 
02:47:31.990 --> 02:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
tells people and it tells kids that who
 
02:47:34.670 --> 02:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
they are doesn't matter it tells them
 
02:47:36.389 --> 02:47:36.399 align:start position:0%
that people don't care about them that
 
02:47:39.870 --> 02:47:39.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:44.150 --> 02:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
matter their mental health is deeply
 
02:47:47.670 --> 02:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
affected and they don't have the
 
02:47:49.870 --> 02:47:49.880 align:start position:0%
capacity and in that
 
02:47:53.389 --> 02:47:53.399 align:start position:0%
moment to be a they just F this child
 
02:47:55.389 --> 02:47:55.399 align:start position:0%
who has this parent didn't feel like
 
02:47:57.870 --> 02:47:57.880 align:start position:0%
they had the capacity to come to me in
 
02:48:00.710 --> 02:48:00.720 align:start position:0%
that moment because it was
 
02:48:04.670 --> 02:48:04.680 align:start position:0%
beyond it was they just would say we I
 
02:48:06.190 --> 02:48:06.200 align:start position:0%
just couldn't handle
 
02:48:08.910 --> 02:48:08.920 align:start position:0%
it mom I know you love
 
02:48:14.429 --> 02:48:14.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:17.070 --> 02:48:17.080 align:start position:0%
alive as a
 
02:48:19.190 --> 02:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
teacher and I think about what that
 
02:48:19.200 --> 02:48:20.389 align:start position:0%
teacher and I think about what that
teacher

02:48:20.389 --> 02:48:20.399 align:start position:0%
teacher
 
02:48:22.910 --> 02:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
did to my
 
02:48:25.870 --> 02:48:25.880 align:start position:0%
child it's already hard enough as it is
 
02:48:27.830 --> 02:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
as a kid to have and to find that
 
02:48:30.349 --> 02:48:30.359 align:start position:0%
identity to take that away from them
 
02:48:33.309 --> 02:48:33.319 align:start position:0%
right to be in environments where people
 
02:48:35.469 --> 02:48:35.479 align:start position:0%
don't accept
 
02:48:39.150 --> 02:48:39.160 align:start position:0%
them it adds up and it looks like what
 
02:48:41.670 --> 02:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
it looked like for our family my child
 
02:48:43.990 --> 02:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
is a young adult now and continues to
 
02:48:46.110 --> 02:48:46.120 align:start position:0%
struggle with mental
 
02:48:49.070 --> 02:48:49.080 align:start position:0%
health there is a consequence there is a
 
02:48:54.469 --> 02:48:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:57.349 --> 02:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
money you go to a hospital you have to
 
02:48:59.389 --> 02:48:59.399 align:start position:0%
bring things every single time there are
 
02:49:01.630 --> 02:49:01.640 align:start position:0%
co-pays every single
 
02:49:04.110 --> 02:49:04.120 align:start position:0%
time my child is since moved out of New
 
02:49:06.030 --> 02:49:06.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because they don't feel like
 
02:49:08.190 --> 02:49:08.200 align:start position:0%
this is a welcoming environment for
 
02:49:10.030 --> 02:49:10.040 align:start position:0%
them I think we're going to have to call
 
02:49:12.630 --> 02:49:12.640 align:start position:0%
it right there okay thank you very very
 
02:49:15.469 --> 02:49:15.479 align:start position:0%
much other questions from the
 
02:49:39.110 --> 02:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:41.710 --> 02:49:41.720 align:start position:0%
house okay good morning chairman lad and
 
02:49:43.190 --> 02:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
members of the committee good to see you
 
02:49:48.070 --> 02:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
again uh I am here to testify on SB 341
 
02:49:49.710 --> 02:49:49.720 align:start position:0%
I am deor house president of the
 
02:49:51.349 --> 02:49:51.359 align:start position:0%
American Federation of teachers New
 
02:49:54.070 --> 02:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm here on behalf of our 3700
 
02:49:55.830 --> 02:49:55.840 align:start position:0%
members across the state we mostly work
 
02:49:59.790 --> 02:49:59.800 align:start position:0%
in K12 uh education we are also parents
 
02:50:01.309 --> 02:50:01.319 align:start position:0%
grandparents and taxpayers in New
 
02:50:04.309 --> 02:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and um I am here to
 
02:50:07.710 --> 02:50:07.720 align:start position:0%
unequivocally oppose s SP
 
02:50:10.389 --> 02:50:10.399 align:start position:0%
341 and we oppose this bill because
 
02:50:12.309 --> 02:50:12.319 align:start position:0%
simply put it is not in the best
 
02:50:13.750 --> 02:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
interest of our
 
02:50:16.110 --> 02:50:16.120 align:start position:0%
students we are always happy to discuss
 
02:50:18.750 --> 02:50:18.760 align:start position:0%
with parents classwork homework uh
 
02:50:21.670 --> 02:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
academics whether a student is behaving
 
02:50:23.309 --> 02:50:23.319 align:start position:0%
following the school rules whether
 
02:50:24.950 --> 02:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
they're kind to other
 
02:50:27.870 --> 02:50:27.880 align:start position:0%
students but uh we oppose this bill
 
02:50:30.269 --> 02:50:30.279 align:start position:0%
because it will create a climate of fear
 
02:50:33.429 --> 02:50:33.439 align:start position:0%
in our schools for educators and for our
 
02:50:36.030 --> 02:50:36.040 align:start position:0%
students that complete and honest
 
02:50:38.550 --> 02:50:38.560 align:start position:0%
standard that in the bill that the um
 
02:50:41.429 --> 02:50:41.439 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsors said was so easy to
 
02:50:43.950 --> 02:50:43.960 align:start position:0%
understand when you start looking into
 
02:50:47.309 --> 02:50:47.319 align:start position:0%
it it really could go very far there's
 
02:50:49.429 --> 02:50:49.439 align:start position:0%
no limit on the question a parent could
 
02:50:52.150 --> 02:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
ask so what does the individual educator
 
02:50:54.830 --> 02:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
have to keep track of there's nothing
 
02:50:56.870 --> 02:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
there that tells you you know you just
 
02:50:57.910 --> 02:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
have to keep track of all their
 
02:51:00.670 --> 02:51:00.680 align:start position:0%
assignments and what you're teaching or
 
02:51:02.870 --> 02:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
um you know whether they're possibly
 
02:51:05.110 --> 02:51:05.120 align:start position:0%
bullying other any other students you
 
02:51:06.190 --> 02:51:06.200 align:start position:0%
have to keep track of everything the
 
02:51:08.910 --> 02:51:08.920 align:start position:0%
student says to you everything do you
 
02:51:10.190 --> 02:51:10.200 align:start position:0%
have to keep track of everything you
 
02:51:11.469 --> 02:51:11.479 align:start position:0%
hear them say to other students as
 
02:51:13.429 --> 02:51:13.439 align:start position:0%
they're passing in the hallway how about
 
02:51:15.469 --> 02:51:15.479 align:start position:0%
everything they're wearing changes in
 
02:51:18.710 --> 02:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
hairstyle um are they suddenly dressing
 
02:51:22.269 --> 02:51:22.279 align:start position:0%
in a fashion that is different you know
 
02:51:23.990 --> 02:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
more feminine more masculine do I have
 
02:51:25.950 --> 02:51:25.960 align:start position:0%
to keep track of that uh By the way when
 
02:51:27.790 --> 02:51:27.800 align:start position:0%
I'm writing all this down because if I
 
02:51:30.590 --> 02:51:30.600 align:start position:0%
don't answer completely and honestly I'm
 
02:51:32.429 --> 02:51:32.439 align:start position:0%
going to have a consequence I might lose
 
02:51:34.550 --> 02:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
my license uh when do I have time to
 
02:51:37.670 --> 02:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
teach reading yeah where's the academics
 
02:51:39.990 --> 02:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
in this you create a climate of fear
 
02:51:41.910 --> 02:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
among the Educators because they are
 
02:51:44.750 --> 02:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
afraid they don't um answer completely
 
02:51:45.990 --> 02:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
and honestly and then you create a
 
02:51:47.469 --> 02:51:47.479 align:start position:0%
climate of fear amongst students I will
 
02:51:49.710 --> 02:51:49.720 align:start position:0%
just finish this last point very quickly
 
02:51:51.110 --> 02:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
um because they know that everything
 
02:51:54.670 --> 02:51:54.680 align:start position:0%
they say and do whether dealing directly
 
02:51:56.950 --> 02:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
with a teacher or with other students at
 
02:51:59.830 --> 02:51:59.840 align:start position:0%
school amongst their peers can and will
 
02:52:01.710 --> 02:52:01.720 align:start position:0%
be reported back to their parents so
 
02:52:03.550 --> 02:52:03.560 align:start position:0%
they have no chance to actually be a
 
02:52:06.910 --> 02:52:06.920 align:start position:0%
child and grow and be independent human
 
02:52:09.269 --> 02:52:09.279 align:start position:0%
beings like they're meant to be so we
 
02:52:11.469 --> 02:52:11.479 align:start position:0%
urge you to itl this bill and I will be
 
02:52:14.389 --> 02:52:14.399 align:start position:0%
sending the um testimony in email to you
 
02:52:17.510 --> 02:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much other
 
02:52:21.269 --> 02:52:21.279 align:start position:0%
questions thank you oh R Dr you had your
 
02:52:22.750 --> 02:52:22.760 align:start position:0%
hand up thank you just thank you for
 
02:52:24.630 --> 02:52:24.640 align:start position:0%
taking the question I I understand
 
02:52:26.389 --> 02:52:26.399 align:start position:0%
there's no limit on number of questions
 
02:52:29.349 --> 02:52:29.359 align:start position:0%
I'm just ask wondering is I don't know
 
02:52:31.229 --> 02:52:31.239 align:start position:0%
or I haven't heard anything a complete
 
02:52:33.830 --> 02:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
and honest answer that would work from
 
02:52:35.510 --> 02:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
the testimony I heard in the Senate bill
 
02:52:37.469 --> 02:52:37.479 align:start position:0%
and testimony I heard this morning it is
 
02:52:40.910 --> 02:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
assumed that if it happens at school the
 
02:52:43.150 --> 02:52:43.160 align:start position:0%
schooled employee must know the answer
 
02:52:45.510 --> 02:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
otherwise you're withholding information
 
02:52:47.389 --> 02:52:47.399 align:start position:0%
and lying and I find that a very
 
02:52:49.150 --> 02:52:49.160 align:start position:0%
offensive assumption but I have heard
 
02:52:51.150 --> 02:52:51.160 align:start position:0%
that several times already today I heard
 
02:52:53.670 --> 02:52:53.680 align:start position:0%
it repeatedly in the sen testimony so I
 
02:52:55.349 --> 02:52:55.359 align:start position:0%
would be very concerned and all my
 
02:52:56.710 --> 02:52:56.720 align:start position:0%
members are concerned that we'll be
 
02:52:58.550 --> 02:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
assumed to be lying if we don't know the
 
02:53:01.269 --> 02:53:01.279 align:start position:0%
answer or don't go find the answer out
 
02:53:02.710 --> 02:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
and and that's a horrible position to
 
02:53:04.309 --> 02:53:04.319 align:start position:0%
put us in because we'd actually rather
 
02:53:06.990 --> 02:53:07.000 align:start position:0%
be teaching our
 
02:53:09.389 --> 02:53:09.399 align:start position:0%
students further questions from the
 
02:53:24.349 --> 02:53:24.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:27.710 --> 02:53:27.720 align:start position:0%
um hi there um I'm in opposition to um
 
02:53:27.720 --> 02:53:28.710 align:start position:0%
um hi there um I'm in opposition to um
Bill

02:53:28.710 --> 02:53:28.720 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
02:53:32.750 --> 02:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
341 um I uh was homeschooled in a
 
02:53:34.790 --> 02:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
Conservative Christian Community um K
 
02:53:36.670 --> 02:53:36.680 align:start position:0%
through2 in New Hampshire um and then
 
02:53:38.870 --> 02:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
went to a private Conservative Christian
 
02:53:41.750 --> 02:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
College so from birth to age 22 I was
 
02:53:44.030 --> 02:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
part of a community um that would inform
 
02:53:45.990 --> 02:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
on you that would report um to your
 
02:53:47.790 --> 02:53:47.800 align:start position:0%
parents to church leadership to
 
02:53:47.800 --> 02:53:49.030 align:start position:0%
parents to church leadership to
educators

02:53:49.030 --> 02:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
educators
 
02:53:53.389 --> 02:53:53.399 align:start position:0%
um if you were outed um as LGBT lgbtq
 
02:53:58.710 --> 02:53:58.720 align:start position:0%
plus um and uh so I I can tell you um
 
02:54:02.229 --> 02:54:02.239 align:start position:0%
that this culture of of reporting um it
 
02:54:05.790 --> 02:54:05.800 align:start position:0%
undermines trust um it creates fear
 
02:54:09.229 --> 02:54:09.239 align:start position:0%
shame um you know like you can't express
 
02:54:11.910 --> 02:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
yourself and and just the amount of of
 
02:54:14.510 --> 02:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
trauma that that does to a young brain
 
02:54:18.510 --> 02:54:18.520 align:start position:0%
um it it's it's huge um I'm now I'm a
 
02:54:19.710 --> 02:54:19.720 align:start position:0%
social worker I'm a mental health
 
02:54:21.950 --> 02:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
professional in a high school with a
 
02:54:24.870 --> 02:54:24.880 align:start position:0%
specialization in lgbtq plus youth um
 
02:54:28.110 --> 02:54:28.120 align:start position:0%
and it's my goal to be the safe adult
 
02:54:32.469 --> 02:54:32.479 align:start position:0%
that I needed to be um as as a queer
 
02:54:35.030 --> 02:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
youth as a mental health professional um
 
02:54:39.030 --> 02:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm concerned um about how as a
 
02:54:40.229 --> 02:54:40.239 align:start position:0%
mental health professional school I'm
 
02:54:42.469 --> 02:54:42.479 align:start position:0%
concerned about how this bill um is
 
02:54:45.429 --> 02:54:45.439 align:start position:0%
going to impact like the confid the
 
02:54:47.750 --> 02:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
confidentiality um you know
 
02:54:49.790 --> 02:54:49.800 align:start position:0%
responsibility ities um that I have as a
 
02:54:52.510 --> 02:54:52.520 align:start position:0%
mental health professional um and and
 
02:54:54.229 --> 02:54:54.239 align:start position:0%
this bill just does not support the
 
02:54:56.070 --> 02:54:56.080 align:start position:0%
science of attachment and caregiver
 
02:54:58.590 --> 02:54:58.600 align:start position:0%
child relationships which which has to
 
02:55:01.349 --> 02:55:01.359 align:start position:0%
be built on trust and autonomy of the
 
02:55:03.349 --> 02:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
child to share in their own time um as
 
02:55:06.469 --> 02:55:06.479 align:start position:0%
we've heard in other testimonies um I'm
 
02:55:09.349 --> 02:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions thank you
 
02:55:12.429 --> 02:55:12.439 align:start position:0%

02:55:30.389 --> 02:55:30.399 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
02:55:32.389 --> 02:55:32.399 align:start position:0%
Chris urel and I'm an attorney with glad
 
02:55:34.870 --> 02:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
I'm New Hampshire licensed um today this
 
02:55:36.309 --> 02:55:36.319 align:start position:0%
committee is looking at yet another bill
 
02:55:38.349 --> 02:55:38.359 align:start position:0%
that seeks to force teachers and other
 
02:55:40.670 --> 02:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
school Personnel into an unprecedented
 
02:55:42.950 --> 02:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
surveillance role in our schools once
 
02:55:44.790 --> 02:55:44.800 align:start position:0%
again I'm here to say that this bill is
 
02:55:47.870 --> 02:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
unworkable invasive and dangerous two
 
02:55:49.309 --> 02:55:49.319 align:start position:0%
courts with binding Authority in New
 
02:55:50.750 --> 02:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are currently considering
 
02:55:52.429 --> 02:55:52.439 align:start position:0%
cases involving people who claim that
 
02:55:54.070 --> 02:55:54.080 align:start position:0%
schools have a constitutional obligation
 
02:55:55.990 --> 02:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
to Monitor and report on how their
 
02:55:58.349 --> 02:55:58.359 align:start position:0%
children identify at school one case out
 
02:55:59.950 --> 02:55:59.960 align:start position:0%
of L Massachusetts is pending in the
 
02:56:01.510 --> 02:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
first circuit the other is the
 
02:56:03.030 --> 02:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
Manchester case uh pending in the New
 
02:56:04.990 --> 02:56:05.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court it is unlikely
 
02:56:06.750 --> 02:56:06.760 align:start position:0%
that either Court will establish a new
 
02:56:08.630 --> 02:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
constitutional obligation to report on
 
02:56:11.190 --> 02:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
how students identify at school while
 
02:56:13.950 --> 02:56:13.960 align:start position:0%
the bill sponsors rais raises the issue
 
02:56:15.710 --> 02:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
of uh the rights of parents this concern
 
02:56:17.710 --> 02:56:17.720 align:start position:0%
is misplaced we must remember that
 
02:56:20.389 --> 02:56:20.399 align:start position:0%
nobody can or should stop a parent from
 
02:56:21.950 --> 02:56:21.960 align:start position:0%
asking important questions from having
 
02:56:23.309 --> 02:56:23.319 align:start position:0%
sensitive conversations and from
 
02:56:24.429 --> 02:56:24.439 align:start position:0%
instilling their values with their
 
02:56:27.110 --> 02:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
children at home teachers and other
 
02:56:29.070 --> 02:56:29.080 align:start position:0%
school Personnel want a strong
 
02:56:30.429 --> 02:56:30.439 align:start position:0%
relationship between students and
 
02:56:32.429 --> 02:56:32.439 align:start position:0%
parents it's in everyone's best interest
 
02:56:34.389 --> 02:56:34.399 align:start position:0%
to encourage open communication and
 
02:56:36.110 --> 02:56:36.120 align:start position:0%
schools can be really powerful allies in
 
02:56:37.830 --> 02:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
providing resources to students and to
 
02:56:39.630 --> 02:56:39.640 align:start position:0%
parents to Foster and support open
 
02:56:41.469 --> 02:56:41.479 align:start position:0%
communication this legislation would
 
02:56:43.229 --> 02:56:43.239 align:start position:0%
actually undermine that crucial role
 
02:56:44.950 --> 02:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
that schools can play play in supporting
 
02:56:47.070 --> 02:56:47.080 align:start position:0%
families courts have told us however
 
02:56:48.950 --> 02:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
that young people do have a qualified
 
02:56:50.349 --> 02:56:50.359 align:start position:0%
right to Pro privacy and how they
 
02:56:52.670 --> 02:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
identify almost 30 years ago two young
 
02:56:54.229 --> 02:56:54.239 align:start position:0%
men in Pennsylvania were found by a
 
02:56:56.830 --> 02:56:56.840 align:start position:0%
police officer parked in a car at night
 
02:56:58.389 --> 02:56:58.399 align:start position:0%
that officer threatened to share
 
02:56:59.710 --> 02:56:59.720 align:start position:0%
information with the family of one of
 
02:57:01.710 --> 02:57:01.720 align:start position:0%
the young men Marcus Wayman and
 
02:57:03.389 --> 02:57:03.399 align:start position:0%
tragically he took his life that night
 
02:57:05.070 --> 02:57:05.080 align:start position:0%
because he was not ready for his family
 
02:57:07.429 --> 02:57:07.439 align:start position:0%
to know that he was gay his parents sued
 
02:57:08.870 --> 02:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
the police department for threatening to
 
02:57:10.870 --> 02:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
disclose and the court of appeals at for
 
02:57:12.630 --> 02:57:12.640 align:start position:0%
the third circuit said that it does
 
02:57:14.110 --> 02:57:14.120 align:start position:0%
violate the constitutional rights of a
 
02:57:15.710 --> 02:57:15.720 align:start position:0%
young person when a government official
 
02:57:17.070 --> 02:57:17.080 align:start position:0%
threatens to disclose personal
 
02:57:18.750 --> 02:57:18.760 align:start position:0%
information to their families when that
 
02:57:21.070 --> 02:57:21.080 align:start position:0%
disclosure could cause harm honest and
 
02:57:23.269 --> 02:57:23.279 align:start position:0%
complete complete is a moving Target and
 
02:57:25.030 --> 02:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
it's up to the whim of any individual to
 
02:57:26.750 --> 02:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
say that information provided by a
 
02:57:28.550 --> 02:57:28.560 align:start position:0%
teacher is incomplete because of any
 
02:57:30.229 --> 02:57:30.239 align:start position:0%
detail that was not remembered or
 
02:57:31.670 --> 02:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
recorded and
 
02:57:31.680 --> 02:57:33.309 align:start position:0%
recorded and
shared

02:57:33.309 --> 02:57:33.319 align:start position:0%
shared
 
02:57:35.630 --> 02:57:35.640 align:start position:0%
um I just want to make one really quick
 
02:57:38.150 --> 02:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
point that there there's no delineation
 
02:57:40.389 --> 02:57:40.399 align:start position:0%
in this bill between direct observation
 
02:57:42.389 --> 02:57:42.399 align:start position:0%
versus indirect speculation even though
 
02:57:44.469 --> 02:57:44.479 align:start position:0%
the sponsor said otherwise uh teachers
 
02:57:46.070 --> 02:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
don't lie to parents if that's a concern
 
02:57:47.590 --> 02:57:47.600 align:start position:0%
shared by legislators in New Hampshire I
 
02:57:48.990 --> 02:57:49.000 align:start position:0%
would invite you to consider legislation
 
02:57:50.710 --> 02:57:50.720 align:start position:0%
that prohibits false representations to
 
02:57:52.710 --> 02:57:52.720 align:start position:0%
parents that's not what this bill does
 
02:57:54.469 --> 02:57:54.479 align:start position:0%
this bill inserts teachers into family
 
02:57:56.190 --> 02:57:56.200 align:start position:0%
Affairs a role that they're not trained
 
02:57:58.309 --> 02:57:58.319 align:start position:0%
or prepared to take on I'm happy to take
 
02:57:59.870 --> 02:57:59.880 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much are there
 
02:58:01.429 --> 02:58:01.439 align:start position:0%

02:58:05.510 --> 02:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
Woodcock good almost good afternoon good
 
02:58:07.510 --> 02:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
morning can you just clarify for me in
 
02:58:11.550 --> 02:58:11.560 align:start position:0%
very simple lay terms um your statement
 
02:58:13.510 --> 02:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
about the qualified right of
 
02:58:15.550 --> 02:58:15.560 align:start position:0%
confidentiality uh qualified right of
 
02:58:18.190 --> 02:58:18.200 align:start position:0%
privacy uh meaning that if uh that Court
 
02:58:20.229 --> 02:58:20.239 align:start position:0%
have said that a student or sorry that a
 
02:58:23.429 --> 02:58:23.439 align:start position:0%
young person um might have a right to
 
02:58:24.870 --> 02:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
not have their information
 
02:58:26.550 --> 02:58:26.560 align:start position:0%
constitutionally protected right under
 
02:58:28.269 --> 02:58:28.279 align:start position:0%
the 14th Amendment to not have personal
 
02:58:29.990 --> 02:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
information about them disclosed to
 
02:58:32.269 --> 02:58:32.279 align:start position:0%
their family members when the government
 
02:58:34.190 --> 02:58:34.200 align:start position:0%
official who has that information has
 
02:58:35.870 --> 02:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
reason to suspect that it might result
 
02:58:39.030 --> 02:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
in harm to that young person thank
 
02:58:43.790 --> 02:58:43.800 align:start position:0%

good afternoon to everybody we are ready
 
03:37:56.750 --> 03:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
to continue our hearing hearings today
 
03:37:58.950 --> 03:37:58.960 align:start position:0%
this is the last hearing of the day uh
 
03:37:58.960 --> 03:38:00.469 align:start position:0%
this is the last hearing of the day uh
SB

03:38:00.469 --> 03:38:00.479 align:start position:0%
SB
 
03:38:03.110 --> 03:38:03.120 align:start position:0%
375 this is Bill relative B to
 
03:38:05.710 --> 03:38:05.720 align:start position:0%
biological sex and student Athletics and
 
03:38:09.110 --> 03:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
I'd like to welcome represent Senator
 
03:38:11.229 --> 03:38:11.239 align:start position:0%
Lang thank you Mr chair thank you
 
03:38:12.790 --> 03:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I'm Senator Tim
 
03:38:15.469 --> 03:38:15.479 align:start position:0%
Lang from the Lakes Region I cover
 
03:38:18.710 --> 03:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
Senate District 2 um I'm here for Senate
 
03:38:20.550 --> 03:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
aard who is unfortunately feeling ill
 
03:38:22.269 --> 03:38:22.279 align:start position:0%
and could not make it to introduce this
 
03:38:25.510 --> 03:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
bill so um this bill is a pretty
 
03:38:27.590 --> 03:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
straightforward bill I I'm just going to
 
03:38:28.950 --> 03:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
make a couple preliminary statements and
 
03:38:30.469 --> 03:38:30.479 align:start position:0%
first there's nowhere in this bill will
 
03:38:33.389 --> 03:38:33.399 align:start position:0%
you you see the word gender this bill is
 
03:38:35.830 --> 03:38:35.840 align:start position:0%
not about gender this bill is about
 
03:38:39.469 --> 03:38:39.479 align:start position:0%
biological sex so what the bill does is
 
03:38:41.269 --> 03:38:41.279 align:start position:0%
basically say that biological females
 
03:38:43.469 --> 03:38:43.479 align:start position:0%
will play on the fem Sports identified
 
03:38:45.229 --> 03:38:45.239 align:start position:0%
as female biological males will play on
 
03:38:47.469 --> 03:38:47.479 align:start position:0%
sport Sports designated as a male and we
 
03:38:49.269 --> 03:38:49.279 align:start position:0%
don't care who plays on coed Sports if
 
03:38:52.150 --> 03:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
you have a sport identified as co-ed um
 
03:38:54.990 --> 03:38:55.000 align:start position:0%
it excludes out a couple things so again
 
03:38:58.429 --> 03:38:58.439 align:start position:0%
the issue around the the science and and
 
03:39:00.910 --> 03:39:00.920 align:start position:0%
puberty um and biological Advantage
 
03:39:03.110 --> 03:39:03.120 align:start position:0%
starts at puberty and so therefore this
 
03:39:05.030 --> 03:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply to K through five classes
 
03:39:06.750 --> 03:39:06.760 align:start position:0%
because they haven't reached puberty yet
 
03:39:08.710 --> 03:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't they don't have a a
 
03:39:10.950 --> 03:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
physiological Advantage um the other
 
03:39:14.590 --> 03:39:14.600 align:start position:0%
thing we took out was uh Co um
 
03:39:16.670 --> 03:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
co-curricular or inter mural in club
 
03:39:18.790 --> 03:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
sports in colleges again these are
 
03:39:20.630 --> 03:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
voluntary these are not uh you don't get
 
03:39:22.150 --> 03:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
scholarships to play on the club sport
 
03:39:23.269 --> 03:39:23.279 align:start position:0%
you don't get scholarships to play on
 
03:39:25.510 --> 03:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
you mural Sports and again part of this
 
03:39:27.030 --> 03:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
bill is about opportunities and the
 
03:39:28.790 --> 03:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
availability for biological females to
 
03:39:30.389 --> 03:39:30.399 align:start position:0%
be able to have opportunities in the in
 
03:39:33.550 --> 03:39:33.560 align:start position:0%
the in the in education so that's what
 
03:39:35.910 --> 03:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
the bill doesn't do but again the bill
 
03:39:37.349 --> 03:39:37.359 align:start position:0%
is pretty straightforward it says
 
03:39:39.670 --> 03:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
biological males will play on biological
 
03:39:42.070 --> 03:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
male Sports biological females will play
 
03:39:44.349 --> 03:39:44.359 align:start position:0%
on female sports the reason is why would
 
03:39:46.269 --> 03:39:46.279 align:start position:0%
we do this what is the what is the
 
03:39:48.750 --> 03:39:48.760 align:start position:0%
causation around this so we've
 
03:39:50.309 --> 03:39:50.319 align:start position:0%
identified basically three things this
 
03:39:53.870 --> 03:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
build seeks to address safety for our
 
03:39:56.150 --> 03:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
biological females fairness for our
 
03:39:58.189 --> 03:39:58.199 align:start position:0%
biological females and opportunity for
 
03:39:59.790 --> 03:39:59.800 align:start position:0%
our biological females so those are the
 
03:40:01.269 --> 03:40:01.279 align:start position:0%
three key points and I'll talk about
 
03:40:03.990 --> 03:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
each point so we talk about safety what
 
03:40:06.630 --> 03:40:06.640 align:start position:0%
safety problem does this does does
 
03:40:09.550 --> 03:40:09.560 align:start position:0%
allowing a trans female or biological
 
03:40:12.150 --> 03:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
male to play in a female sport or a
 
03:40:14.429 --> 03:40:14.439 align:start position:0%
biological female sport the answer is it
 
03:40:17.070 --> 03:40:17.080 align:start position:0%
creates injury right so I don't have to
 
03:40:19.189 --> 03:40:19.199 align:start position:0%
go very far we can just go right down to
 
03:40:21.590 --> 03:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
to Massachusetts where most recently
 
03:40:25.750 --> 03:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
there was a a female a basketball team
 
03:40:27.510 --> 03:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
on the other opposing side was a trans
 
03:40:30.070 --> 03:40:30.080 align:start position:0%
male three female students were injured
 
03:40:32.389 --> 03:40:32.399 align:start position:0%
before finally the coach decided to
 
03:40:34.510 --> 03:40:34.520 align:start position:0%
Forfeit the game rather than continue
 
03:40:36.429 --> 03:40:36.439 align:start position:0%
playing the game um because of a
 
03:40:38.070 --> 03:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
biological male that was playing on the
 
03:40:40.830 --> 03:40:40.840 align:start position:0%
female team for the opposing team um we
 
03:40:44.189 --> 03:40:44.199 align:start position:0%
can go to um 2023 last year in
 
03:40:46.510 --> 03:40:46.520 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts uh we had the incident
 
03:40:48.790 --> 03:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
involving field hockey where again a
 
03:40:50.550 --> 03:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
biological male playing in a in a
 
03:40:53.469 --> 03:40:53.479 align:start position:0%
biological female SP in a female sport
 
03:40:55.830 --> 03:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
um ended up causing injury to a player
 
03:40:58.429 --> 03:40:58.439 align:start position:0%
knocking their teeth out in field hockey
 
03:41:02.110 --> 03:41:02.120 align:start position:0%
um because of the um the strength at
 
03:41:03.830 --> 03:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
which they use the uh I don't know what
 
03:41:07.510 --> 03:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
they call the stick um but a stick um we
 
03:41:11.710 --> 03:41:11.720 align:start position:0%
can go to 2022 in California um
 
03:41:15.750 --> 03:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
volleyball um there was a trans female
 
03:41:17.950 --> 03:41:17.960 align:start position:0%
student playing on a female sports team
 
03:41:20.030 --> 03:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
who spiked the ball so hard into the
 
03:41:23.269 --> 03:41:23.279 align:start position:0%
face of a biological female that she's
 
03:41:24.790 --> 03:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
still hasn't been cleared to return to
 
03:41:27.030 --> 03:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
sports due to neurological and issues
 
03:41:29.950 --> 03:41:29.960 align:start position:0%
with her spine and then
 
03:41:32.790 --> 03:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
2021 um there was another incident in
 
03:41:34.349 --> 03:41:34.359 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts surrounding round
 
03:41:37.670 --> 03:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
basketball so this is the safety Factor
 
03:41:40.750 --> 03:41:40.760 align:start position:0%
right when when a biological female goes
 
03:41:43.110 --> 03:41:43.120 align:start position:0%
to play sports they expect they're going
 
03:41:45.950 --> 03:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
to be on an even playing field and that
 
03:41:48.630 --> 03:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
uh um and that they'll be able to
 
03:41:50.870 --> 03:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
compete at at a relative basis so that
 
03:41:53.309 --> 03:41:53.319 align:start position:0%
steps into the fairness argument so when
 
03:41:55.229 --> 03:41:55.239 align:start position:0%
we talk about fairness why is it unfair
 
03:41:57.670 --> 03:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
why is it unfair to him to have a trans
 
03:42:03.630 --> 03:42:03.640 align:start position:0%
female play in um a female sport so just
 
03:42:07.309 --> 03:42:07.319 align:start position:0%
in uh 929 of 23 the American College of
 
03:42:10.830 --> 03:42:10.840 align:start position:0%
sports medicine says biological sex is
 
03:42:14.630 --> 03:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
the determinant factor in in athletic
 
03:42:16.990 --> 03:42:17.000 align:start position:0%
performance because of the fundamental
 
03:42:19.710 --> 03:42:19.720 align:start position:0%
sex differences in anatomy so that's a
 
03:42:21.550 --> 03:42:21.560 align:start position:0%
fairness argument right
 
03:42:24.750 --> 03:42:24.760 align:start position:0%
biologically post pesent boys have
 
03:42:27.149 --> 03:42:27.159 align:start position:0%
strong have have are stronger have
 
03:42:29.910 --> 03:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
higher muscle density and actually even
 
03:42:34.189 --> 03:42:34.199 align:start position:0%
um in their uh lung capacity or lung uh
 
03:42:35.590 --> 03:42:35.600 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm going to try to I'm going to
 
03:42:37.630 --> 03:42:37.640 align:start position:0%
say this wrong but the oxygen to blood
 
03:42:39.830 --> 03:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
reaction man are different in the way
 
03:42:41.630 --> 03:42:41.640 align:start position:0%
that in the way that oxygen is absorbed
 
03:42:42.750 --> 03:42:42.760 align:start position:0%
that gives them a physiological
 
03:42:44.149 --> 03:42:44.159 align:start position:0%
Advantage so we're talking about
 
03:42:45.910 --> 03:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
physiological advantage
 
03:42:48.429 --> 03:42:48.439 align:start position:0%
that boys have biological boys have when
 
03:42:51.110 --> 03:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
playing sports and is it fair to have
 
03:42:52.910 --> 03:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
our daughters our biological female
 
03:42:55.030 --> 03:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
daughters be subjected to that
 
03:42:58.429 --> 03:42:58.439 align:start position:0%
unfairness and my postulation is no the
 
03:43:00.349 --> 03:43:00.359 align:start position:0%
last one is opportunity again just
 
03:43:03.030 --> 03:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
recently 124 of 23 the University of
 
03:43:05.750 --> 03:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
Washington offered uh one of only 12
 
03:43:08.309 --> 03:43:08.319 align:start position:0%
female scholarships for volleyball to a
 
03:43:11.389 --> 03:43:11.399 align:start position:0%
trans male athlete so taking away the 12
 
03:43:12.990 --> 03:43:13.000 align:start position:0%
female that could have gotten a college
 
03:43:15.670 --> 03:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
scholarship and we all depending on
 
03:43:16.870 --> 03:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
which side of the aisle you'll argue
 
03:43:19.070 --> 03:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
that again access to higher education
 
03:43:21.630 --> 03:43:21.640 align:start position:0%
results in better um performance in the
 
03:43:24.990 --> 03:43:25.000 align:start position:0%
job market right so again here's a
 
03:43:27.309 --> 03:43:27.319 align:start position:0%
biological girl on the girls volleyball
 
03:43:29.349 --> 03:43:29.359 align:start position:0%
team that was denied a scholarship in a
 
03:43:32.990 --> 03:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
D1 team um in favor of a trans female
 
03:43:35.070 --> 03:43:35.080 align:start position:0%
taking away the opportunity we talk a
 
03:43:36.710 --> 03:43:36.720 align:start position:0%
lot about Title 9 and I noticed recently
 
03:43:40.510 --> 03:43:40.520 align:start position:0%
Title 9 was was morphed um into gender
 
03:43:42.630 --> 03:43:42.640 align:start position:0%
equal sex but I'll explain to you that
 
03:43:45.110 --> 03:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
in the medical practice that's not true
 
03:43:47.030 --> 03:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
in medical science gender and sex are
 
03:43:50.750 --> 03:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
two inter two different things um sex is
 
03:43:52.189 --> 03:43:52.199 align:start position:0%
segmented differently because of the
 
03:43:54.229 --> 03:43:54.239 align:start position:0%
physiological advantages that we just
 
03:43:56.149 --> 03:43:56.159 align:start position:0%
talked about and and and there are
 
03:43:57.670 --> 03:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
diseases that are available to men that
 
03:43:59.590 --> 03:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
aren't available to women and there are
 
03:44:00.870 --> 03:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
diseases for women that are not
 
03:44:02.229 --> 03:44:02.239 align:start position:0%
available to men and that's the
 
03:44:05.429 --> 03:44:05.439 align:start position:0%
biological factor and so even in medical
 
03:44:08.510 --> 03:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
science they delineate between gender
 
03:44:10.590 --> 03:44:10.600 align:start position:0%
which is your expression and sex which
 
03:44:13.269 --> 03:44:13.279 align:start position:0%
is your chromosomes so this bill seeks
 
03:44:17.070 --> 03:44:17.080 align:start position:0%
to say that um again B Bas on your
 
03:44:20.269 --> 03:44:20.279 align:start position:0%
um birth certificate at issued at or or
 
03:44:22.349 --> 03:44:22.359 align:start position:0%
near birth um you'll play on the
 
03:44:24.309 --> 03:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
appropriates team based on that so we
 
03:44:27.510 --> 03:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
don't have issues of fairness uh safety
 
03:44:29.630 --> 03:44:29.640 align:start position:0%
or reduction of opportunity for our
 
03:44:32.110 --> 03:44:32.120 align:start position:0%
female uh biological female daughters
 
03:44:33.830 --> 03:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take questions thank you
 
03:44:36.229 --> 03:44:36.239 align:start position:0%
very much Senator uh are there questions
 
03:44:38.149 --> 03:44:38.159 align:start position:0%
from the
 
03:44:40.870 --> 03:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
committee represent are you handing up
 
03:44:47.429 --> 03:44:47.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:49.149 --> 03:44:49.159 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and thank you for
 
03:44:51.309 --> 03:44:51.319 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
03:44:56.469 --> 03:44:56.479 align:start position:0%
question I'm for Fe 11 tall I will never
 
03:44:58.950 --> 03:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
be able to compete with most women on
 
03:45:01.870 --> 03:45:01.880 align:start position:0%
most sports are we going to write a bill
 
03:45:03.750 --> 03:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
that says only people who are above a
 
03:45:05.990 --> 03:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
certain height you're making it on
 
03:45:09.189 --> 03:45:09.199 align:start position:0%
physical attributes that I wouldn't pass
 
03:45:11.469 --> 03:45:11.479 align:start position:0%
in anything except maybe
 
03:45:14.349 --> 03:45:14.359 align:start position:0%
poker so I'm wondering how far are we
 
03:45:16.950 --> 03:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
going to be taking this and and
 
03:45:20.269 --> 03:45:20.279 align:start position:0%
marginalizing groups of people based on
 
03:45:21.990 --> 03:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
physical attributes thank you for your
 
03:45:23.910 --> 03:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
question so again I'm going to go back
 
03:45:25.870 --> 03:45:25.880 align:start position:0%
to Nowhere in this bill is gender in
 
03:45:28.309 --> 03:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
this bill right we're not talking about
 
03:45:31.550 --> 03:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
Expos or going against anybody of gender
 
03:45:33.429 --> 03:45:33.439 align:start position:0%
we're talking about biological sex and
 
03:45:36.110 --> 03:45:36.120 align:start position:0%
why again science about biological sex
 
03:45:37.670 --> 03:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
and how that creates a physiological
 
03:45:41.510 --> 03:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
Advantage so again um I I don't play
 
03:45:43.630 --> 03:45:43.640 align:start position:0%
basketball well I I'm 5 foot eight right
 
03:45:46.269 --> 03:45:46.279 align:start position:0%
it's an acceptance I have right um and I
 
03:45:47.349 --> 03:45:47.359 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that and I don't think I
 
03:45:48.950 --> 03:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
should be given a special benefit
 
03:45:50.189 --> 03:45:50.199 align:start position:0%
because I'm 5 fo8 and I should
 
03:45:51.269 --> 03:45:51.279 align:start position:0%
automatically have a spot on the
 
03:45:53.510 --> 03:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
basketball team right that's not that's
 
03:45:57.030 --> 03:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
not uh something I would expect but
 
03:45:59.389 --> 03:45:59.399 align:start position:0%
again biological female the whole point
 
03:46:01.510 --> 03:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
of the original title 9 signed over 50
 
03:46:04.590 --> 03:46:04.600 align:start position:0%
years ago was to create an equal playing
 
03:46:08.030 --> 03:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
field because women could not find a
 
03:46:10.550 --> 03:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
place on a male sports team because of
 
03:46:12.990 --> 03:46:13.000 align:start position:0%
physiological advantages and so Title
 
03:46:15.630 --> 03:46:15.640 align:start position:0%
Nine which was was was
 
03:46:17.590 --> 03:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
I I recently found out that Vice uh
 
03:46:19.309 --> 03:46:19.319 align:start position:0%
President Nixon was the one that signed
 
03:46:21.469 --> 03:46:21.479 align:start position:0%
that and and I went to I was visiting
 
03:46:23.790 --> 03:46:23.800 align:start position:0%
his Museum when I was down uh out in
 
03:46:28.229 --> 03:46:28.239 align:start position:0%
California and it was heralded as a fund
 
03:46:29.950 --> 03:46:29.960 align:start position:0%
one of the fundamental changes of the
 
03:46:32.389 --> 03:46:32.399 align:start position:0%
women's rights movement at the time it
 
03:46:34.510 --> 03:46:34.520 align:start position:0%
was issued because it created an equal
 
03:46:36.269 --> 03:46:36.279 align:start position:0%
playing field between male athletes and
 
03:46:38.429 --> 03:46:38.439 align:start position:0%
female athletes and allowed for that
 
03:46:41.710 --> 03:46:41.720 align:start position:0%
functionality we've now we've now um and
 
03:46:43.990 --> 03:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
so this bill just seeks to recognize
 
03:46:46.189 --> 03:46:46.199 align:start position:0%
that that FAL inquality that was
 
03:46:50.110 --> 03:46:50.120 align:start position:0%
recognized back in 1973 I think it was
 
03:46:52.510 --> 03:46:52.520 align:start position:0%
this bill just seeks to recognize that
 
03:46:54.510 --> 03:46:54.520 align:start position:0%
and and put it in law follow one
 
03:46:58.070 --> 03:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
question please yes Title Nine which I
 
03:47:01.670 --> 03:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
have read was not about equal it was
 
03:47:04.750 --> 03:47:04.760 align:start position:0%
about equal money for women's sports it
 
03:47:06.710 --> 03:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
didn't care who was on the teams what it
 
03:47:08.950 --> 03:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
cared about was what money was spent for
 
03:47:11.990 --> 03:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
the teams so it had nothing really to do
 
03:47:14.189 --> 03:47:14.199 align:start position:0%
with genders or sex or anything like
 
03:47:16.870 --> 03:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
that delineated but so again it uses the
 
03:47:19.510 --> 03:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
word sex in the bill not gender right in
 
03:47:21.670 --> 03:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
that title 9 language it uses the word
 
03:47:26.070 --> 03:47:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:27.950 --> 03:47:27.960 align:start position:0%
lineation any other questions
 
03:47:27.960 --> 03:47:29.070 align:start position:0%
lineation any other questions
representative

03:47:29.070 --> 03:47:29.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:47:31.229 --> 03:47:31.239 align:start position:0%
beler thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:47:32.630 --> 03:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
senator for being here and presenting
 
03:47:35.229 --> 03:47:35.239 align:start position:0%
this um you've youve told us that the
 
03:47:38.189 --> 03:47:38.199 align:start position:0%
primary motivation behind pursuing this
 
03:47:41.110 --> 03:47:41.120 align:start position:0%
bill is to prevent injury to to female
 
03:47:43.830 --> 03:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
athletes that's something I'm incredibly
 
03:47:46.670 --> 03:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
inclined to agree with but given that
 
03:47:48.950 --> 03:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
I'm a little bit curious as to item six
 
03:47:52.070 --> 03:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
here that says any team sport or
 
03:47:54.389 --> 03:47:54.399 align:start position:0%
athletic event designated for males men
 
03:47:57.429 --> 03:47:57.439 align:start position:0%
or boys shall be open to students of
 
03:47:59.149 --> 03:47:59.159 align:start position:0%
either sex so I'm wondering what the
 
03:48:01.389 --> 03:48:01.399 align:start position:0%
rationale is for allowing girls than to
 
03:48:03.830 --> 03:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
play with boys under those circumstances
 
03:48:05.030 --> 03:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
and if you wouldn't mind also speaking
 
03:48:06.950 --> 03:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
to what's to prevent schools from Simply
 
03:48:08.910 --> 03:48:08.920 align:start position:0%
designating all teams Boys in order to
 
03:48:10.429 --> 03:48:10.439 align:start position:0%
get around
 
03:48:12.630 --> 03:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
this thank you for your question so
 
03:48:15.229 --> 03:48:15.239 align:start position:0%
again the initial reason was for for
 
03:48:17.349 --> 03:48:17.359 align:start position:0%
allowing that is that when a biological
 
03:48:19.469 --> 03:48:19.479 align:start position:0%
female goes to play on the female team
 
03:48:20.469 --> 03:48:20.479 align:start position:0%
they have a certain amount of
 
03:48:22.510 --> 03:48:22.520 align:start position:0%
expectations about safety and fairness
 
03:48:23.790 --> 03:48:23.800 align:start position:0%
and what's going to happen and the
 
03:48:26.229 --> 03:48:26.239 align:start position:0%
opportunities they may have if they
 
03:48:28.510 --> 03:48:28.520 align:start position:0%
choose again so remember the choice to
 
03:48:30.030 --> 03:48:30.040 align:start position:0%
go play on a boys team and we've had
 
03:48:31.229 --> 03:48:31.239 align:start position:0%
that right here in conquer right there
 
03:48:33.750 --> 03:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
was a hockey player back several 20
 
03:48:36.229 --> 03:48:36.239 align:start position:0%
years ago at Muny I think her name was
 
03:48:38.870 --> 03:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
um who chose to play in the boys hockey
 
03:48:40.189 --> 03:48:40.199 align:start position:0%
team and actually went to Olympics on
 
03:48:43.510 --> 03:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
the girls hockey team um in uh for New
 
03:48:46.750 --> 03:48:46.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and so the idea was if a if
 
03:48:49.550 --> 03:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
a girl chooses to step into that they
 
03:48:51.149 --> 03:48:51.159 align:start position:0%
have that right to choose to play I want
 
03:48:52.269 --> 03:48:52.279 align:start position:0%
to play I want to be a kicker on the
 
03:48:53.990 --> 03:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
football team right and they have the
 
03:48:56.710 --> 03:48:56.720 align:start position:0%
right to at least go and try out right
 
03:48:59.189 --> 03:48:59.199 align:start position:0%
but to have a male who has a
 
03:49:01.030 --> 03:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
physiological Advantage come into the
 
03:49:03.750 --> 03:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
female sport creates a a a fundamental
 
03:49:06.469 --> 03:49:06.479 align:start position:0%
unfairness and also raises safety
 
03:49:08.469 --> 03:49:08.479 align:start position:0%
concerns further questions from the
 
03:49:10.950 --> 03:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
represent Miler thank you thank you for
 
03:49:12.790 --> 03:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
03:49:15.510 --> 03:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
question are you familiar have you met
 
03:49:18.950 --> 03:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
with the TR any trans family and
 
03:49:21.429 --> 03:49:21.439 align:start position:0%
reviewed for them the process that the
 
03:49:22.670 --> 03:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
family goes
 
03:49:26.070 --> 03:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
through uh the hormonal changes the
 
03:49:28.710 --> 03:49:28.720 align:start position:0%
psychological issues that the family
 
03:49:32.550 --> 03:49:32.560 align:start position:0%
goes through or that trans
 
03:49:35.830 --> 03:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
female to be able to basically change
 
03:49:39.030 --> 03:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
her own phys physicality and I've done
 
03:49:42.110 --> 03:49:42.120 align:start position:0%
that I've talked with them this is not a
 
03:49:44.910 --> 03:49:44.920 align:start position:0%
um this is not a willy-nilly decision
 
03:49:47.630 --> 03:49:47.640 align:start position:0%
that a family makes as you may know this
 
03:49:50.469 --> 03:49:50.479 align:start position:0%
is a very serious decision it takes time
 
03:49:53.189 --> 03:49:53.199 align:start position:0%
over the years for this transition to
 
03:49:56.550 --> 03:49:56.560 align:start position:0%
take place and yet when that happens my
 
03:49:58.429 --> 03:49:58.439 align:start position:0%
question to you is have first of all
 
03:50:00.590 --> 03:50:00.600 align:start position:0%
have you met with trans families and
 
03:50:04.030 --> 03:50:04.040 align:start position:0%
understand what that process is yes then
 
03:50:06.110 --> 03:50:06.120 align:start position:0%
you also know then at that point in time
 
03:50:07.910 --> 03:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
there is a physical change that does
 
03:50:10.710 --> 03:50:10.720 align:start position:0%
take place in that individual and what
 
03:50:13.349 --> 03:50:13.359 align:start position:0%
you're trying to say here in this bill
 
03:50:15.389 --> 03:50:15.399 align:start position:0%
is that that change
 
03:50:17.590 --> 03:50:17.600 align:start position:0%
is going to be mitigated by this bill
 
03:50:20.550 --> 03:50:20.560 align:start position:0%
and disallow that individual from
 
03:50:24.510 --> 03:50:24.520 align:start position:0%
playing in a sport that they choose
 
03:50:26.790 --> 03:50:26.800 align:start position:0%
to thank if I just ask a clarifying
 
03:50:28.590 --> 03:50:28.600 align:start position:0%
question are you talking about a student
 
03:50:31.149 --> 03:50:31.159 align:start position:0%
a child who takes puberty blockers yes
 
03:50:32.429 --> 03:50:32.439 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you for bringing that
 
03:50:34.710 --> 03:50:34.720 align:start position:0%
point up so again I'm going to go back
 
03:50:36.309 --> 03:50:36.319 align:start position:0%
to science because that's been a lot of
 
03:50:38.349 --> 03:50:38.359 align:start position:0%
my uh reasoning around this bill is
 
03:50:42.510 --> 03:50:42.520 align:start position:0%
science so again on 312 of 24 the
 
03:50:44.110 --> 03:50:44.120 align:start position:0%
National Health Institute of England
 
03:50:45.349 --> 03:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
concluded that there's not enough
 
03:50:46.950 --> 03:50:46.960 align:start position:0%
evidence to support the safety or
 
03:50:48.309 --> 03:50:48.319 align:start position:0%
clinical effectiveness of puberty
 
03:50:51.590 --> 03:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
blockers so they stopped Physicians from
 
03:50:53.870 --> 03:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
prescribing so understand that emerging
 
03:50:56.229 --> 03:50:56.239 align:start position:0%
Medical Science says that this is not
 
03:50:59.030 --> 03:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
irreversible right that giving a child
 
03:51:01.710 --> 03:51:01.720 align:start position:0%
child puberty blockers that has a
 
03:51:04.189 --> 03:51:04.199 align:start position:0%
long-term impact and medical science is
 
03:51:06.630 --> 03:51:06.640 align:start position:0%
as emerging Medical Science recognizes
 
03:51:08.870 --> 03:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
that and is withdrawing that as a
 
03:51:08.880 --> 03:51:10.229 align:start position:0%
that and is withdrawing that as a
treatment

03:51:10.229 --> 03:51:10.239 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
03:51:13.189 --> 03:51:13.199 align:start position:0%
program further questions from the
 
03:51:16.269 --> 03:51:16.279 align:start position:0%
committee Thank you very much represent
 
03:51:16.279 --> 03:51:17.469 align:start position:0%
committee Thank you very much represent
representa

03:51:17.469 --> 03:51:17.479 align:start position:0%
representa
 
03:51:19.630 --> 03:51:19.640 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
03:51:21.149 --> 03:51:21.159 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
03:51:24.070 --> 03:51:24.080 align:start position:0%
question so if the Paramount reason that
 
03:51:27.189 --> 03:51:27.199 align:start position:0%
this bill is proposed is for
 
03:51:32.469 --> 03:51:32.479 align:start position:0%
safety uh I have two questions one why
 
03:51:34.189 --> 03:51:34.199 align:start position:0%
then are you exempting club and
 
03:51:37.950 --> 03:51:37.960 align:start position:0%
intermural sports if those are I'll stay
 
03:51:39.389 --> 03:51:39.399 align:start position:0%
with your terminology for the moment
 
03:51:41.550 --> 03:51:41.560 align:start position:0%
mixed sex teams wouldn't the safety
 
03:51:44.030 --> 03:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
issues be the same thank you for the
 
03:51:46.309 --> 03:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
question you those are voluntary so
 
03:51:48.349 --> 03:51:48.359 align:start position:0%
again if someone's choosing High School
 
03:51:50.550 --> 03:51:50.560 align:start position:0%
sports are voluntary excuse me if I can
 
03:51:53.309 --> 03:51:53.319 align:start position:0%
finish my answer thank you so again club
 
03:51:54.670 --> 03:51:54.680 align:start position:0%
sports and intermural sports are
 
03:51:56.469 --> 03:51:56.479 align:start position:0%
voluntary there's no obligation you
 
03:51:58.070 --> 03:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
don't get a college scholarship for it
 
03:51:59.349 --> 03:51:59.359 align:start position:0%
so you're not taking away an opportunity
 
03:52:02.750 --> 03:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
for anybody and again if um a biological
 
03:52:04.590 --> 03:52:04.600 align:start position:0%
female chooses to step on the field it's
 
03:52:06.349 --> 03:52:06.359 align:start position:0%
the same reason why the representative
 
03:52:08.910 --> 03:52:08.920 align:start position:0%
bel's point I we allowed females to play
 
03:52:10.750 --> 03:52:10.760 align:start position:0%
in male Sports if they choose to step on
 
03:52:11.870 --> 03:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
the field they know what they're getting
 
03:52:14.469 --> 03:52:14.479 align:start position:0%
into when I choose to step when when a b
 
03:52:16.429 --> 03:52:16.439 align:start position:0%
iCal female goes to sign up for female
 
03:52:18.229 --> 03:52:18.239 align:start position:0%
sports they expect there's going to be a
 
03:52:20.269 --> 03:52:20.279 align:start position:0%
fundamental safety um there and there's
 
03:52:22.149 --> 03:52:22.159 align:start position:0%
going to be fundamental fairness there
 
03:52:24.469 --> 03:52:24.479 align:start position:0%
and by allowing a trans female on the
 
03:52:26.269 --> 03:52:26.279 align:start position:0%
team you potentially take away both
 
03:52:28.149 --> 03:52:28.159 align:start position:0%
those things never mind the long-term
 
03:52:29.790 --> 03:52:29.800 align:start position:0%
issue of of
 
03:52:34.149 --> 03:52:34.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity questions yes thank
 
03:52:36.670 --> 03:52:36.680 align:start position:0%
you and so following from that then what
 
03:52:41.309 --> 03:52:41.319 align:start position:0%
would be your response to the reality
 
03:52:44.590 --> 03:52:44.600 align:start position:0%
that the primary variable in someone's
 
03:52:47.149 --> 03:52:47.159 align:start position:0%
strength and capacity in any sport on
 
03:52:49.790 --> 03:52:49.800 align:start position:0%
the field the court wherever is their
 
03:52:51.309 --> 03:52:51.319 align:start position:0%
conditioning and training and their
 
03:52:54.429 --> 03:52:54.439 align:start position:0%
wherewith all to play so how does that
 
03:52:56.349 --> 03:52:56.359 align:start position:0%
factor into this sure thank you for the
 
03:52:58.309 --> 03:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
question again um I go back to the
 
03:52:59.710 --> 03:52:59.720 align:start position:0%
American College of Sportsmen's
 
03:53:02.070 --> 03:53:02.080 align:start position:0%
statement biological sex is the
 
03:53:04.910 --> 03:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
determinant factor of of athletic
 
03:53:06.870 --> 03:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
performance is a I'm sorry biological
 
03:53:09.030 --> 03:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
sex is a determinant of athletic
 
03:53:11.110 --> 03:53:11.120 align:start position:0%
performance because of the fundamental
 
03:53:14.950 --> 03:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
sex differences in anatomy so again the
 
03:53:16.790 --> 03:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
the answer to your question is you have
 
03:53:18.790 --> 03:53:18.800 align:start position:0%
an fundamental unfairness happening when
 
03:53:20.429 --> 03:53:20.439 align:start position:0%
a biological male participates in a
 
03:53:20.439 --> 03:53:22.149 align:start position:0%
a biological male participates in a
female

03:53:22.149 --> 03:53:22.159 align:start position:0%
female
 
03:53:25.750 --> 03:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:29.349 --> 03:53:29.359 align:start position:0%
WX good afternoon one day uh a couple
 
03:53:31.550 --> 03:53:31.560 align:start position:0%
things I want to go back to the
 
03:53:33.469 --> 03:53:33.479 align:start position:0%
estatement you made uh to represent
 
03:53:36.910 --> 03:53:36.920 align:start position:0%
Damon about club sports um similar to
 
03:53:38.030 --> 03:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
other high school sports they are
 
03:53:40.870 --> 03:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
voluntary kids do participate but often
 
03:53:40.880 --> 03:53:41.910 align:start position:0%
voluntary kids do participate but often
club

03:53:41.910 --> 03:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
club
 
03:53:45.590 --> 03:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
sports are not
 
03:53:48.070 --> 03:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
in vity at JB level because they don't
 
03:53:51.149 --> 03:53:51.159 align:start position:0%
have that status yet so it's not
 
03:53:53.550 --> 03:53:53.560 align:start position:0%
necessarily that they can't earn a
 
03:53:55.510 --> 03:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
scholarship the youngsters don't have a
 
03:53:57.790 --> 03:53:57.800 align:start position:0%
chance to earn a scholarship is that
 
03:53:59.910 --> 03:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
most school systems you said you're a
 
03:54:01.269 --> 03:54:01.279 align:start position:0%
school teacher somewhere I didn't catch
 
03:54:03.070 --> 03:54:03.080 align:start position:0%
what you said you thought but most
 
03:54:03.080 --> 03:54:04.070 align:start position:0%
what you said you thought but most
school

03:54:04.070 --> 03:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
school
 
03:54:06.950 --> 03:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
systems um require that schools because
 
03:54:09.309 --> 03:54:09.319 align:start position:0%
of budgetary considerations do start
 
03:54:11.149 --> 03:54:11.159 align:start position:0%
kids with club sports and then Mo JD
 
03:54:13.429 --> 03:54:13.439 align:start position:0%
program V program so if that if that
 
03:54:15.510 --> 03:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
sport is the first time at that school
 
03:54:16.790 --> 03:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
and often though that's the only
 
03:54:18.070 --> 03:54:18.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity for youngsters so it could
 
03:54:19.790 --> 03:54:19.800 align:start position:0%
be very well an opportunity for
 
03:54:21.590 --> 03:54:21.600 align:start position:0%
athletics so it's just it was sort of
 
03:54:23.389 --> 03:54:23.399 align:start position:0%
just want to correct your your frame on
 
03:54:25.790 --> 03:54:25.800 align:start position:0%
that and the representative my is
 
03:54:28.870 --> 03:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
exactly correct on on Title Nine h i was
 
03:54:31.510 --> 03:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
happen to be a benefit a benefactor of
 
03:54:35.110 --> 03:54:35.120 align:start position:0%
Title 9 actually because of the pay um
 
03:54:37.630 --> 03:54:37.640 align:start position:0%
that it does provide equal opportunity
 
03:54:41.229 --> 03:54:41.239 align:start position:0%
for work and pay team scheduling team
 
03:54:43.550 --> 03:54:43.560 align:start position:0%
sports those types of things uh it
 
03:54:45.070 --> 03:54:45.080 align:start position:0%
wasn't looking at when it came through
 
03:54:47.990 --> 03:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
with the participation piece so uh I
 
03:54:50.309 --> 03:54:50.319 align:start position:0%
guess my concern is the club sports are
 
03:54:51.950 --> 03:54:51.960 align:start position:0%
actually feeders to to high school
 
03:54:54.950 --> 03:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
programs my question is um and you said
 
03:54:57.990 --> 03:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
scholarship about how many how many high
 
03:54:59.830 --> 03:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
school scholar how how many kids get
 
03:55:01.550 --> 03:55:01.560 align:start position:0%
division one scholarships to play high
 
03:55:03.229 --> 03:55:03.239 align:start position:0%
school ball oh it's very fractional
 
03:55:05.309 --> 03:55:05.319 align:start position:0%
again it's fractional um of the number
 
03:55:07.070 --> 03:55:07.080 align:start position:0%
of students I'm assuming again that get
 
03:55:09.349 --> 03:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
division W Scholarships in New Hampshire
 
03:55:11.550 --> 03:55:11.560 align:start position:0%
again but even one taken away would be
 
03:55:14.590 --> 03:55:14.600 align:start position:0%
wrong okay and just the and on your I'm
 
03:55:16.189 --> 03:55:16.199 align:start position:0%
confused if I may it's the last question
 
03:55:20.429 --> 03:55:20.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh line 23 through 26
 
03:55:22.670 --> 03:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't understand the need to
 
03:55:25.429 --> 03:55:25.439 align:start position:0%
say that because you're not prohibiting
 
03:55:26.870 --> 03:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh you're prohibiting people from
 
03:55:28.149 --> 03:55:28.159 align:start position:0%
playing you're prohibiting from kids to
 
03:55:29.990 --> 03:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
have opportunity to play but you're
 
03:55:33.429 --> 03:55:33.439 align:start position:0%
saying that that uh I doesn't say they
 
03:55:35.990 --> 03:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
have to go to that bathroom I'm Sor I
 
03:55:38.070 --> 03:55:38.080 align:start position:0%
don't quite understand which I I I I'm
 
03:55:40.149 --> 03:55:40.159 align:start position:0%
you have to tell me the section 29 29
 
03:55:43.229 --> 03:55:43.239 align:start position:0%
line 23 through 27 it talks about
 
03:55:45.510 --> 03:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
facilities instead of a school school do
 
03:55:46.590 --> 03:55:46.600 align:start position:0%
high school or even a college here I
 
03:55:47.429 --> 03:55:47.439 align:start position:0%
don't know why you're trying to tell the
 
03:55:49.189 --> 03:55:49.199 align:start position:0%
NCA what to do but if they're having
 
03:55:51.309 --> 03:55:51.319 align:start position:0%
these facilities then they have to have
 
03:55:53.149 --> 03:55:53.159 align:start position:0%
one for male one for female biological
 
03:55:55.910 --> 03:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
sex do you know of any high school or
 
03:55:57.750 --> 03:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
college or Community College in New
 
03:55:59.750 --> 03:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that doesn't have a male and a
 
03:56:01.750 --> 03:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
female bathroom in the lockal facilities
 
03:56:05.110 --> 03:56:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:07.910 --> 03:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
one so every High School I've ever been
 
03:56:10.710 --> 03:56:10.720 align:start position:0%
in has a both a male and female yeah um
 
03:56:13.309 --> 03:56:13.319 align:start position:0%
correct I mean every every Public Public
 
03:56:15.389 --> 03:56:15.399 align:start position:0%
University or School in New Hampshire
 
03:56:16.590 --> 03:56:16.600 align:start position:0%
has one of those so I don't understand
 
03:56:19.030 --> 03:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
why that does even in there oh thank you
 
03:56:22.269 --> 03:56:22.279 align:start position:0%
so the answer is on the last line of 26
 
03:56:23.870 --> 03:56:23.880 align:start position:0%
that shall provide separate facilities
 
03:56:25.830 --> 03:56:25.840 align:start position:0%
for male and female participants based
 
03:56:28.309 --> 03:56:28.319 align:start position:0%
on biological sex so again if you thank
 
03:56:31.429 --> 03:56:31.439 align:start position:0%
you if I can finish my question um so
 
03:56:34.149 --> 03:56:34.159 align:start position:0%
again the idea being that biological
 
03:56:36.030 --> 03:56:36.040 align:start position:0%
boys will use the biological boys room
 
03:56:37.750 --> 03:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
the biological girls use the biological
 
03:56:39.149 --> 03:56:39.159 align:start position:0%
girls room because they're undressing
 
03:56:40.469 --> 03:56:40.479 align:start position:0%
and getting ready for sport getting
 
03:56:42.990 --> 03:56:43.000 align:start position:0%
ready for a physical activity and so the
 
03:56:45.110 --> 03:56:45.120 align:start position:0%
I that doesn't say that rson Woodcock
 
03:56:47.070 --> 03:56:47.080 align:start position:0%
would you please let him finish before
 
03:56:48.790 --> 03:56:48.800 align:start position:0%
then if you have want to be have another
 
03:56:51.429 --> 03:56:51.439 align:start position:0%
question please get recognized for the
 
03:56:53.189 --> 03:56:53.199 align:start position:0%
question do you have anything else
 
03:56:55.070 --> 03:56:55.080 align:start position:0%
further on that Senator I'm fine thank
 
03:56:57.469 --> 03:56:57.479 align:start position:0%
you I just okay you have thank you sh
 
03:57:00.070 --> 03:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
yes it doesn't say that it doesn't say
 
03:57:01.229 --> 03:57:01.239 align:start position:0%
they have to go to that bathroom it just
 
03:57:02.550 --> 03:57:02.560 align:start position:0%
says every school has to have one which
 
03:57:04.590 --> 03:57:04.600 align:start position:0%
they already have that's all just the
 
03:57:07.550 --> 03:57:07.560 align:start position:0%
point Thank you further further
 
03:57:09.910 --> 03:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
questions says represent Miler yeah I'd
 
03:57:11.429 --> 03:57:11.439 align:start position:0%
like to just thank you I'd like to
 
03:57:14.630 --> 03:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
follow up on uh represent woodcock is it
 
03:57:17.229 --> 03:57:17.239 align:start position:0%
so it's your testimony then you as I
 
03:57:18.670 --> 03:57:18.680 align:start position:0%
heard you right that there are a
 
03:57:21.149 --> 03:57:21.159 align:start position:0%
fractional amount of people who are
 
03:57:23.269 --> 03:57:23.279 align:start position:0%
eligible for scholarships is that
 
03:57:24.670 --> 03:57:24.680 align:start position:0%
correct no I didn't say scholarships the
 
03:57:26.950 --> 03:57:26.960 align:start position:0%
question was D1 which is a very high
 
03:57:29.149 --> 03:57:29.159 align:start position:0%
standard but D2 schools can also we have
 
03:57:30.469 --> 03:57:30.479 align:start position:0%
an increased number of those as a matter
 
03:57:31.950 --> 03:57:31.960 align:start position:0%
of fact I believe son of the ganon's
 
03:57:33.349 --> 03:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
daughter is a recipient of a D2
 
03:57:36.110 --> 03:57:36.120 align:start position:0%
scholarship um for field hockey so there
 
03:57:38.670 --> 03:57:38.680 align:start position:0%
are both when we add division two that
 
03:57:40.590 --> 03:57:40.600 align:start position:0%
number gets significantly bigger but the
 
03:57:42.510 --> 03:57:42.520 align:start position:0%
but the fractionalization of that is
 
03:57:46.110 --> 03:57:46.120 align:start position:0%
then Trump's the volume of trans kids
 
03:57:48.590 --> 03:57:48.600 align:start position:0%
that could participate in sports and
 
03:57:52.910 --> 03:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
learn leadership learn teamwork Etc as
 
03:57:55.990 --> 03:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
they have life skills that are developed
 
03:57:58.229 --> 03:57:58.239 align:start position:0%
so you're saying that's more important
 
03:58:01.309 --> 03:58:01.319 align:start position:0%
than allowing young people more a
 
03:58:03.149 --> 03:58:03.159 align:start position:0%
greater volume of young people to
 
03:58:05.630 --> 03:58:05.640 align:start position:0%
participate in sports rather than just
 
03:58:08.389 --> 03:58:08.399 align:start position:0%
those who might might get a scholarship
 
03:58:10.550 --> 03:58:10.560 align:start position:0%
is that correct thankes so I can answer
 
03:58:12.269 --> 03:58:12.279 align:start position:0%
your question the answer the answer is
 
03:58:13.950 --> 03:58:13.960 align:start position:0%
nothing in this bill stops any student
 
03:58:16.750 --> 03:58:16.760 align:start position:0%
from playing sports nothing in this bill
 
03:58:19.070 --> 03:58:19.080 align:start position:0%
what the bill does is say that the sport
 
03:58:21.110 --> 03:58:21.120 align:start position:0%
has to be fair though right and we have
 
03:58:22.790 --> 03:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
to be safe and so therefore based on
 
03:58:25.149 --> 03:58:25.159 align:start position:0%
biological sex You'll Play in that sport
 
03:58:26.590 --> 03:58:26.600 align:start position:0%
whether it's a biological female or
 
03:58:28.830 --> 03:58:28.840 align:start position:0%
biological male so nothing stops a
 
03:58:30.510 --> 03:58:30.520 align:start position:0%
biological male who identifies as a
 
03:58:32.149 --> 03:58:32.159 align:start position:0%
trans female from playing on the boys
 
03:58:34.590 --> 03:58:34.600 align:start position:0%
team nothing so they have the
 
03:58:36.870 --> 03:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to play okay let me ask you
 
03:58:38.710 --> 03:58:38.720 align:start position:0%
this question if I'm a male and I want
 
03:58:41.189 --> 03:58:41.199 align:start position:0%
to play field hockey can I play field
 
03:58:44.349 --> 03:58:44.359 align:start position:0%
hockey then no why not I mean cu a
 
03:58:46.510 --> 03:58:46.520 align:start position:0%
biological Advantage but let's look at
 
03:58:49.149 --> 03:58:49.159 align:start position:0%
this the field hockey if you if you look
 
03:58:51.550 --> 03:58:51.560 align:start position:0%
at professional field hockey it's a male
 
03:58:54.429 --> 03:58:54.439 align:start position:0%
sport it's not a female sport okay we're
 
03:58:55.630 --> 03:58:55.640 align:start position:0%
getting into the point where it's a
 
03:58:58.389 --> 03:58:58.399 align:start position:0%
debate here I'd like to ask questions
 
03:59:00.950 --> 03:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
come from the committee to the person
 
03:59:05.349 --> 03:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
testifying and the response comes from
 
03:59:07.590 --> 03:59:07.600 align:start position:0%
there representative
 
03:59:09.990 --> 03:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
pel thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:59:12.309 --> 03:59:12.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question so we we're talking a
 
03:59:14.870 --> 03:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
lot about scholarships but what about
 
03:59:17.750 --> 03:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
the um biological females who may not
 
03:59:20.229 --> 03:59:20.239 align:start position:0%
even make the team because a transgender
 
03:59:22.710 --> 03:59:22.720 align:start position:0%
female identifying or transgender
 
03:59:24.590 --> 03:59:24.600 align:start position:0%
identifying as female may take their
 
03:59:27.229 --> 03:59:27.239 align:start position:0%
place on the team well again absolutely
 
03:59:30.149 --> 03:59:30.159 align:start position:0%
so again disadvantage to our biological
 
03:59:32.349 --> 03:59:32.359 align:start position:0%
daughters or biological female daughters
 
03:59:34.670 --> 03:59:34.680 align:start position:0%
who are bumped from a team for a
 
03:59:36.830 --> 03:59:36.840 align:start position:0%
biological male who has a defined
 
03:59:39.110 --> 03:59:39.120 align:start position:0%
medical physiological
 
03:59:41.070 --> 03:59:41.080 align:start position:0%
Advantage I'm not going to allow people
 
03:59:42.550 --> 03:59:42.560 align:start position:0%
to have more than two questions
 
03:59:43.710 --> 03:59:43.720 align:start position:0%
representative spear you've already had
 
03:59:47.429 --> 03:59:47.439 align:start position:0%
more than two questions no uh further
 
03:59:49.670 --> 03:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee thank you
 
03:59:50.910 --> 03:59:50.920 align:start position:0%
very much
 
03:59:55.229 --> 03:59:55.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:57.670 --> 03:59:57.680 align:start position:0%
SEL do you want
 
03:59:57.680 --> 04:00:03.550 align:start position:0%
SEL do you want
to

04:00:03.550 --> 04:00:03.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:08.469 --> 04:00:08.479 align:start position:0%
Mr well he wanted uh was it him yeah
 
04:00:11.229 --> 04:00:11.239 align:start position:0%
it's hold on hold on a second yeah I

well we had one that spoke to me going
 
04:00:23.590 --> 04:00:23.600 align:start position:0%
down the hallway here I didn't see his
 
04:00:38.269 --> 04:00:38.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:42.510 --> 04:00:42.520 align:start position:0%
School all the school system back M
 
04:00:46.229 --> 04:00:46.239 align:start position:0%

members of the committee again my name
 
04:01:33.710 --> 04:01:33.720 align:start position:0%
is Chris urel I am a New Hampshire
 
04:01:35.030 --> 04:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
licensed attorney and I'm here
 
04:01:37.269 --> 04:01:37.279 align:start position:0%
representing glad I believe this is the
 
04:01:39.070 --> 04:01:39.080 align:start position:0%
fifth session in a row in which there is
 
04:01:41.070 --> 04:01:41.080 align:start position:0%
at least one bill attempting to block
 
04:01:43.590 --> 04:01:43.600 align:start position:0%
transgender girls from girl sports teams
 
04:01:45.950 --> 04:01:45.960 align:start position:0%
today to I want to emphasize two very
 
04:01:48.469 --> 04:01:48.479 align:start position:0%
recent developments that should inform
 
04:01:50.830 --> 04:01:50.840 align:start position:0%
how you evaluate this bill the first
 
04:01:52.550 --> 04:01:52.560 align:start position:0%
development is a decision that came down
 
04:01:53.750 --> 04:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
last week from the federal court of
 
04:01:55.110 --> 04:01:55.120 align:start position:0%
appeals for the fourth circuit which
 
04:01:57.110 --> 04:01:57.120 align:start position:0%
governs North and South Carolina
 
04:01:59.110 --> 04:01:59.120 align:start position:0%
Virginia West Virginia Maryland the
 
04:02:01.030 --> 04:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
decision involves a similar Sports bill
 
04:02:03.269 --> 04:02:03.279 align:start position:0%
that became a law in West Virginia at
 
04:02:05.110 --> 04:02:05.120 align:start position:0%
first The District Court ruled in favor
 
04:02:06.510 --> 04:02:06.520 align:start position:0%
of the state of West Virginia and said
 
04:02:09.229 --> 04:02:09.239 align:start position:0%
the sports ban was valid but last Monday
 
04:02:11.389 --> 04:02:11.399 align:start position:0%
the appeals court reversed that decision
 
04:02:13.030 --> 04:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
and said the court was wrong and that
 
04:02:15.510 --> 04:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
the sports ban is invalid this outcome
 
04:02:17.309 --> 04:02:17.319 align:start position:0%
is unsurprising it's consistent with
 
04:02:19.389 --> 04:02:19.399 align:start position:0%
what other courts have already said that
 
04:02:21.469 --> 04:02:21.479 align:start position:0%
categorical bands on transgender girls
 
04:02:23.469 --> 04:02:23.479 align:start position:0%
playing School sports on girl sports
 
04:02:25.389 --> 04:02:25.399 align:start position:0%
teams violates the rights of transgender
 
04:02:27.149 --> 04:02:27.159 align:start position:0%
students they single out transgender
 
04:02:28.990 --> 04:02:29.000 align:start position:0%
students based on sex which is a
 
04:02:30.830 --> 04:02:30.840 align:start position:0%
protected characteristic depriving them
 
04:02:32.670 --> 04:02:32.680 align:start position:0%
of opportunities available to other
 
04:02:35.110 --> 04:02:35.120 align:start position:0%
students this powerful fourth circuit
 
04:02:36.870 --> 04:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
decision is in line with the weight of
 
04:02:38.510 --> 04:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
authority in other courts including the
 
04:02:40.349 --> 04:02:40.359 align:start position:0%
ninth circuit I'm happy to go into more
 
04:02:41.790 --> 04:02:41.800 align:start position:0%
detail later about what the decision
 
04:02:44.550 --> 04:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
said but the bottom line is that s sp37
 
04:02:47.429 --> 04:02:47.439 align:start position:0%
is unlikely to survive a legal challenge
 
04:02:49.110 --> 04:02:49.120 align:start position:0%
I want to share another even more recent
 
04:02:50.510 --> 04:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
development the US Department of
 
04:02:51.990 --> 04:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
Education released new title 9
 
04:02:54.149 --> 04:02:54.159 align:start position:0%
regulations on Friday the most relevant
 
04:02:55.870 --> 04:02:55.880 align:start position:0%
takeaway from the new regulations is
 
04:02:58.030 --> 04:02:58.040 align:start position:0%
that title 9 views discrimination
 
04:03:00.870 --> 04:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
against lgbtq students as impermissible
 
04:03:03.590 --> 04:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
sex discrimination categorically denying
 
04:03:05.309 --> 04:03:05.319 align:start position:0%
transgender girls opportunities to
 
04:03:07.790 --> 04:03:07.800 align:start position:0%
participate in sports fits squarely in
 
04:03:09.550 --> 04:03:09.560 align:start position:0%
the prohibition against discrimination
 
04:03:11.590 --> 04:03:11.600 align:start position:0%
based on sex the department of Ed
 
04:03:13.429 --> 04:03:13.439 align:start position:0%
released proposed guidance on Sports
 
04:03:15.910 --> 04:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
specific speically which the new R say
 
04:03:18.990 --> 04:03:19.000 align:start position:0%
is still forthcoming um and that'll make
 
04:03:20.870 --> 04:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
it even more clear that categorical bans
 
04:03:22.469 --> 04:03:22.479 align:start position:0%
on participation by transgender students
 
04:03:24.710 --> 04:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
violates Title 9 this is very important
 
04:03:27.429 --> 04:03:27.439 align:start position:0%
because as you know the US doe enforces
 
04:03:29.870 --> 04:03:29.880 align:start position:0%
its regulations by controlling funding
 
04:03:31.510 --> 04:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's public schools are asked
 
04:03:33.349 --> 04:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
to do more and more with less and less
 
04:03:35.550 --> 04:03:35.560 align:start position:0%
the legislature must not compel schools
 
04:03:37.389 --> 04:03:37.399 align:start position:0%
to violate Title 9 and risk losing
 
04:03:40.189 --> 04:03:40.199 align:start position:0%
Federal funding leadership cooperation
 
04:03:41.790 --> 04:03:41.800 align:start position:0%
self-disciplined Community these are the
 
04:03:43.429 --> 04:03:43.439 align:start position:0%
critical skills that young people learn
 
04:03:44.990 --> 04:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
from participating in school sports
 
04:03:46.670 --> 04:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
programs that's why these programs are
 
04:03:48.510 --> 04:03:48.520 align:start position:0%
an essential part of a complete public
 
04:03:50.550 --> 04:03:50.560 align:start position:0%
education these opportunities need to be
 
04:03:52.389 --> 04:03:52.399 align:start position:0%
available to every student including
 
04:03:54.229 --> 04:03:54.239 align:start position:0%
transgender students and you must reject
 
04:03:56.790 --> 04:03:56.800 align:start position:0%
this legislation if I had um more time I
 
04:03:58.269 --> 04:03:58.279 align:start position:0%
would um talk about some of the
 
04:04:00.830 --> 04:04:00.840 align:start position:0%
anecdotes that uh that the prime sponsor
 
04:04:02.990 --> 04:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
raised and and um you there was some
 
04:04:04.950 --> 04:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
misinformation and some lack some
 
04:04:07.070 --> 04:04:07.080 align:start position:0%
missing context from those stories but
 
04:04:09.309 --> 04:04:09.319 align:start position:0%
um anyway I uh will'll stop there thank
 
04:04:11.229 --> 04:04:11.239 align:start position:0%
you very much Chris uh are questions
 
04:04:12.349 --> 04:04:12.359 align:start position:0%
from the
 
04:04:15.349 --> 04:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
committee represent Damon thank you Mr
 
04:04:16.870 --> 04:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for being here would you
 
04:04:18.630 --> 04:04:18.640 align:start position:0%
please correct misinformation that was
 
04:04:22.030 --> 04:04:22.040 align:start position:0%
cited by prior speaker um yes for first
 
04:04:25.229 --> 04:04:25.239 align:start position:0%
of all uh the the uh the cast review
 
04:04:26.750 --> 04:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
which was released in the United Kingdom
 
04:04:29.830 --> 04:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
did not um rule that or did not make a
 
04:04:31.349 --> 04:04:31.359 align:start position:0%
determination there's no determination
 
04:04:33.349 --> 04:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
that uh puberty blockers are going to be
 
04:04:36.550 --> 04:04:36.560 align:start position:0%
unavailable uh to to transgender PE um
 
04:04:38.630 --> 04:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
people as a rule in in the United
 
04:04:40.830 --> 04:04:40.840 align:start position:0%
Kingdom in fact the cast review uh
 
04:04:42.149 --> 04:04:42.159 align:start position:0%
talked about how there's a need for more
 
04:04:44.189 --> 04:04:44.199 align:start position:0%
research and data and
 
04:04:47.030 --> 04:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh has has recommended that all uh
 
04:04:48.429 --> 04:04:48.439 align:start position:0%
puberty blocking medications that are
 
04:04:50.510 --> 04:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
prescribed in the United Kingdom be done
 
04:04:52.149 --> 04:04:52.159 align:start position:0%
in the context of a clinical trial so
 
04:04:54.110 --> 04:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
that more information can be collected
 
04:04:56.590 --> 04:04:56.600 align:start position:0%
uh furthermore the NHS which is the
 
04:04:58.349 --> 04:04:58.359 align:start position:0%
national health system in in the United
 
04:05:00.229 --> 04:05:00.239 align:start position:0%
Kingdom totally doesn't really compare
 
04:05:02.070 --> 04:05:02.080 align:start position:0%
to the way we manage Healthcare here in
 
04:05:03.550 --> 04:05:03.560 align:start position:0%
the United States but they have
 
04:05:06.670 --> 04:05:06.680 align:start position:0%
recommended uh dispersing Medical Care
 
04:05:09.469 --> 04:05:09.479 align:start position:0%
um to to primary care provider teams
 
04:05:11.790 --> 04:05:11.800 align:start position:0%
instead of um centralized gender clinics
 
04:05:13.229 --> 04:05:13.239 align:start position:0%
and that is the thrust of what is
 
04:05:14.590 --> 04:05:14.600 align:start position:0%
happening the United Kingdom it's a
 
04:05:16.510 --> 04:05:16.520 align:start position:0%
misrepresentation to say that puberty
 
04:05:19.389 --> 04:05:19.399 align:start position:0%
blockers have been banned um another
 
04:05:21.269 --> 04:05:21.279 align:start position:0%
thing is that the basketball game
 
04:05:22.670 --> 04:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
referenced in which there were three
 
04:05:24.469 --> 04:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
trans three girls who are injured and a
 
04:05:26.710 --> 04:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
team forfeited uh I want to make clear
 
04:05:28.990 --> 04:05:29.000 align:start position:0%
that the uh there was a transgender girl
 
04:05:31.910 --> 04:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
on the opposing team and uh and there
 
04:05:33.269 --> 04:05:33.279 align:start position:0%
were three injuries that happened during
 
04:05:34.950 --> 04:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
the game not all three were related to
 
04:05:37.349 --> 04:05:37.359 align:start position:0%
the transgender student um so so that's
 
04:05:38.990 --> 04:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
one piece of missing context I think is
 
04:05:40.229 --> 04:05:40.239 align:start position:0%
really important another piece of
 
04:05:42.510 --> 04:05:42.520 align:start position:0%
missing context is that the coach had
 
04:05:44.670 --> 04:05:44.680 align:start position:0%
decided beforehand that he was down
 
04:05:46.630 --> 04:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
several players and he needed to Forfeit
 
04:05:47.990 --> 04:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
if there were injuries for his players
 
04:05:49.550 --> 04:05:49.560 align:start position:0%
injuries happen all the time in school
 
04:05:52.469 --> 04:05:52.479 align:start position:0%
sports it's the job of school officials
 
04:05:54.229 --> 04:05:54.239 align:start position:0%
to ensure that sports are as safe as
 
04:05:56.149 --> 04:05:56.159 align:start position:0%
possible for all students but the fact
 
04:05:57.870 --> 04:05:57.880 align:start position:0%
that three students were injured in a
 
04:05:59.910 --> 04:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
basketball game is unsurprising and the
 
04:06:02.070 --> 04:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
coach has gone on record saying that the
 
04:06:04.070 --> 04:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
presence of a transgender student is not
 
04:06:06.950 --> 04:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
why he forfeited the game also no
 
04:06:08.349 --> 04:06:08.359 align:start position:0%
student to my knowledge and I've
 
04:06:10.550 --> 04:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
researched the issue deeply has been has
 
04:06:12.830 --> 04:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
been given a scholarship to participate
 
04:06:14.429 --> 04:06:14.439 align:start position:0%
uh no trans student has been given a
 
04:06:16.149 --> 04:06:16.159 align:start position:0%
scholarship an athletic scholarship to
 
04:06:17.990 --> 04:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
date that does not happen in any college
 
04:06:20.910 --> 04:06:20.920 align:start position:0%
anywhere there's one example that's been
 
04:06:21.990 --> 04:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
you know circulated around the
 
04:06:23.870 --> 04:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
right-wing media of a scholarship that
 
04:06:25.910 --> 04:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
was offered to a student and then either
 
04:06:29.070 --> 04:06:29.080 align:start position:0%
was rescinded or uh was not accepted but
 
04:06:30.910 --> 04:06:30.920 align:start position:0%
regardless never was given to this
 
04:06:33.070 --> 04:06:33.080 align:start position:0%
student and that student is a volleyball
 
04:06:35.590 --> 04:06:35.600 align:start position:0%
player and I can't find any confirmation
 
04:06:36.590 --> 04:06:36.600 align:start position:0%
anywhere that this student is
 
04:06:38.349 --> 04:06:38.359 align:start position:0%
transgender she hasn't said so herel
 
04:06:40.429 --> 04:06:40.439 align:start position:0%
self her family hasn't said so so it's
 
04:06:42.030 --> 04:06:42.040 align:start position:0%
speculation on the part of people in the
 
04:06:43.870 --> 04:06:43.880 align:start position:0%
right-wing media trying to make a point
 
04:06:46.030 --> 04:06:46.040 align:start position:0%
um and and and harm transgender people
 
04:06:49.269 --> 04:06:49.279 align:start position:0%
in the process um I can leave it at that
 
04:06:51.429 --> 04:06:51.439 align:start position:0%
the field hockey player who uh you know
 
04:06:53.670 --> 04:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
hit the hit the ball really hard and and
 
04:06:55.670 --> 04:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
broke um a female player's teeth that
 
04:06:57.590 --> 04:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
was a boy he was not transgender he was
 
04:06:59.149 --> 04:06:59.159 align:start position:0%
on the team because there was no other
 
04:07:01.590 --> 04:07:01.600 align:start position:0%
place for him to play field hockey and
 
04:07:04.189 --> 04:07:04.199 align:start position:0%
um I just I asked the committee to to
 
04:07:07.990 --> 04:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
inquire as to why um if me if boys are
 
04:07:09.990 --> 04:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
so dangerous to girls why aren't boys so
 
04:07:11.269 --> 04:07:11.279 align:start position:0%
dangerous to other boys that they
 
04:07:12.790 --> 04:07:12.800 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be allowed to play sports what
 
04:07:15.189 --> 04:07:15.199 align:start position:0%
is the why why is it okay for a boy to
 
04:07:17.110 --> 04:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
be hit in the face with a field hockey
 
04:07:19.229 --> 04:07:19.239 align:start position:0%
ball and lose his teeth if it's not okay
 
04:07:20.990 --> 04:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
for a girl too I I don't really
 
04:07:22.229 --> 04:07:22.239 align:start position:0%
understand that distinction but that's
 
04:07:23.349 --> 04:07:23.359 align:start position:0%
that's what I wanted to say about those
 
04:07:24.990 --> 04:07:25.000 align:start position:0%
anecdotes thank you very much are there
 
04:07:26.510 --> 04:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
04:07:26.520 --> 04:07:27.550 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
represent

04:07:27.550 --> 04:07:27.560 align:start position:0%
represent
 
04:07:29.790 --> 04:07:29.800 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you chair for taking a
 
04:07:33.510 --> 04:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
question um two are you are you aware of
 
04:07:35.189 --> 04:07:35.199 align:start position:0%
any of the
 
04:07:38.469 --> 04:07:38.479 align:start position:0%
nhi excuse me
 
04:07:40.870 --> 04:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
nhaa regulations that prohibit
 
04:07:42.670 --> 04:07:42.680 align:start position:0%
transgender youngsters from playing High
 
04:07:44.830 --> 04:07:44.840 align:start position:0%
School sport yeah thank you for that
 
04:07:46.149 --> 04:07:46.159 align:start position:0%
question it's a very important question
 
04:07:48.670 --> 04:07:48.680 align:start position:0%
I think so the in 2015 the New Hampshire
 
04:07:50.309 --> 04:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
inter schoolastic Athletic Association
 
04:07:53.070 --> 04:07:53.080 align:start position:0%
revised its eligibility policy um
 
04:07:54.630 --> 04:07:54.640 align:start position:0%
because of a transgender New Hampshire
 
04:07:55.870 --> 04:07:55.880 align:start position:0%
Public School student named Sarah
 
04:07:57.590 --> 04:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
huckman who came forward and advocated
 
04:08:00.030 --> 04:08:00.040 align:start position:0%
for her right to play school sports uh
 
04:08:02.030 --> 04:08:02.040 align:start position:0%
the eligibility requirements prior to
 
04:08:05.030 --> 04:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
2015 required that um transgender
 
04:08:06.750 --> 04:08:06.760 align:start position:0%
students have surgery before they' be
 
04:08:08.590 --> 04:08:08.600 align:start position:0%
eligible to participate in school sports
 
04:08:10.830 --> 04:08:10.840 align:start position:0%
which you know of course is nonsensical
 
04:08:12.510 --> 04:08:12.520 align:start position:0%
uh and should not be a requirement for
 
04:08:14.070 --> 04:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
for for participation
 
04:08:16.790 --> 04:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
so Sarah huckman was able to influence
 
04:08:19.910 --> 04:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
the NHA by by you know lobbying and and
 
04:08:21.670 --> 04:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
and the new policy eligibility
 
04:08:25.030 --> 04:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
requirements uh put uh put put forth
 
04:08:27.510 --> 04:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
what are reasonable guidelines about uh
 
04:08:29.189 --> 04:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
about how and when a transgender student
 
04:08:31.590 --> 04:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
can become eligible to play sports uh
 
04:08:34.670 --> 04:08:34.680 align:start position:0%
nhiaa is comprised of um experts in
 
04:08:36.750 --> 04:08:36.760 align:start position:0%
School athletics programs and and and
 
04:08:38.309 --> 04:08:38.319 align:start position:0%
they ought to be making decisions about
 
04:08:40.910 --> 04:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
eligibility uh before before uh before
 
04:08:43.550 --> 04:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
the legislature should be I believe
 
04:08:46.349 --> 04:08:46.359 align:start position:0%
further questions yes thank you uh are
 
04:08:48.269 --> 04:08:48.279 align:start position:0%
you aware of any
 
04:08:51.990 --> 04:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
NCAA rules that disallow transgender
 
04:08:53.550 --> 04:08:53.560 align:start position:0%
students from participating in sport
 
04:08:56.389 --> 04:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
yeah the NCAA has had a policy in place
 
04:08:58.590 --> 04:08:58.600 align:start position:0%
that's been evolving over time but has
 
04:09:00.750 --> 04:09:00.760 align:start position:0%
been around for over 10 years that
 
04:09:02.469 --> 04:09:02.479 align:start position:0%
ensures that transgender students do
 
04:09:04.109 --> 04:09:04.119 align:start position:0%
have the opportunities to participate
 
04:09:05.950 --> 04:09:05.960 align:start position:0%
and play in school sports and this
 
04:09:08.550 --> 04:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
legislation would override the ncaa's
 
04:09:11.309 --> 04:09:11.319 align:start position:0%
policy NCAA uses evidence-based
 
04:09:12.990 --> 04:09:13.000 align:start position:0%
protocols to determine what hormone
 
04:09:15.630 --> 04:09:15.640 align:start position:0%
level um and what periods of time are
 
04:09:18.070 --> 04:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
necessary to establish a student uh to
 
04:09:20.189 --> 04:09:20.199 align:start position:0%
establish that a college student who and
 
04:09:21.469 --> 04:09:21.479 align:start position:0%
I think we can all understand that
 
04:09:23.030 --> 04:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
college competition is a lot different
 
04:09:24.229 --> 04:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
from high school competition when it
 
04:09:26.309 --> 04:09:26.319 align:start position:0%
comes to school sports but that college
 
04:09:29.229 --> 04:09:29.239 align:start position:0%
uh Athletics uh you know sorry so NCAA
 
04:09:30.269 --> 04:09:30.279 align:start position:0%
wants to ensure that there's
 
04:09:33.149 --> 04:09:33.159 align:start position:0%
evidence-based protocols that prevent uh
 
04:09:36.309 --> 04:09:36.319 align:start position:0%
uh inequitable uh unfairness on on girls
 
04:09:38.550 --> 04:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
teams and so they establish um they
 
04:09:39.790 --> 04:09:39.800 align:start position:0%
establish standards that are
 
04:09:42.670 --> 04:09:42.680 align:start position:0%
evidence-based um related to physical uh
 
04:09:45.030 --> 04:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
attributes incling hormones thank you
 
04:09:47.750 --> 04:09:47.760 align:start position:0%

04:10:09.229 --> 04:10:09.239 align:start position:0%
representative Lauren seelig I represent
 
04:10:11.269 --> 04:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
straford 10 which is the city or the
 
04:10:12.830 --> 04:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
town of Durham which operates like a
 
04:10:12.840 --> 04:10:13.830 align:start position:0%
town of Durham which operates like a
city

04:10:13.830 --> 04:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
city
 
04:10:15.510 --> 04:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
um I have two daughters as I've
 
04:10:17.349 --> 04:10:17.359 align:start position:0%
mentioned previously my girls both
 
04:10:19.229 --> 04:10:19.239 align:start position:0%
played team sports there have been
 
04:10:21.269 --> 04:10:21.279 align:start position:0%
allegations that have trans girls played
 
04:10:22.710 --> 04:10:22.720 align:start position:0%
it will give them an unfair advantage or
 
04:10:24.149 --> 04:10:24.159 align:start position:0%
that trans kids will somehow act
 
04:10:26.590 --> 04:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
inappropriately in a bathroom my elder
 
04:10:27.950 --> 04:10:27.960 align:start position:0%
daughter played peeee soccer with a
 
04:10:30.630 --> 04:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
trans child she also took a soccer ball
 
04:10:32.389 --> 04:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
to the face in a direct hit that ended
 
04:10:34.710 --> 04:10:34.720 align:start position:0%
her desire to play again the person who
 
04:10:36.309 --> 04:10:36.319 align:start position:0%
kicked the ball was not the transgender
 
04:10:38.510 --> 04:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
girl she was too distracted it was a
 
04:10:39.990 --> 04:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
cisgender kiddo who grew up to play
 
04:10:41.469 --> 04:10:41.479 align:start position:0%
Varsity soccer before she left her
 
04:10:44.389 --> 04:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
College both my kid both my girls swam
 
04:10:46.469 --> 04:10:46.479 align:start position:0%
on the swim team they competed and
 
04:10:49.349 --> 04:10:49.359 align:start position:0%
usually lost to CIS girls cisgender
 
04:10:51.109 --> 04:10:51.119 align:start position:0%
girls who were a full foot taller than
 
04:10:52.870 --> 04:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
them we tend to be vertically challenged
 
04:10:55.309 --> 04:10:55.319 align:start position:0%
in my family their advantage was height
 
04:10:57.630 --> 04:10:57.640 align:start position:0%
not gender in the locker room all the
 
04:10:59.590 --> 04:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
girls changed in the toilet stalls if
 
04:11:01.070 --> 04:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
they showered first they did so still in
 
04:11:02.790 --> 04:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
their swimsuits because they all thought
 
04:11:04.670 --> 04:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
being a naked in front of anyone was
 
04:11:07.229 --> 04:11:07.239 align:start position:0%
weird plus it got the chlorine off their
 
04:11:09.309 --> 04:11:09.319 align:start position:0%
swimsuits my older daughter has gotten
 
04:11:10.630 --> 04:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
more than one concussion in her I'm
 
04:11:11.710 --> 04:11:11.720 align:start position:0%
sorry my younger daughter has gotten
 
04:11:12.870 --> 04:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
more than one concussion in her time
 
04:11:15.229 --> 04:11:15.239 align:start position:0%
playing basketball and cheering in one
 
04:11:16.630 --> 04:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
case she and another child both went for
 
04:11:18.030 --> 04:11:18.040 align:start position:0%
the ball at the same time very
 
04:11:19.630 --> 04:11:19.640 align:start position:0%
aggressively my daughter came up with
 
04:11:21.389 --> 04:11:21.399 align:start position:0%
the ball the other girl came up with my
 
04:11:23.910 --> 04:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
daughter's head wasn't so good for her
 
04:11:27.630 --> 04:11:27.640 align:start position:0%
head um in none of these cases was it a
 
04:11:29.670 --> 04:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
trans child who injured them it was just
 
04:11:31.349 --> 04:11:31.359 align:start position:0%
regular girls playing Just Like Girls
 
04:11:34.269 --> 04:11:34.279 align:start position:0%
play sports have inherent dangers that's
 
04:11:36.710 --> 04:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
why parents have to sign releases
 
04:11:38.389 --> 04:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
finally I can tell you that while I have
 
04:11:40.429 --> 04:11:40.439 align:start position:0%
been sexually harassed and assaulted in
 
04:11:44.109 --> 04:11:44.119 align:start position:0%
my life including in a women's bathroom
 
04:11:46.630 --> 04:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
it was never by a trans person but by a
 
04:11:49.750 --> 04:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
heterosexual man asserting his power and
 
04:11:51.950 --> 04:11:51.960 align:start position:0%
a heterosexual man who pretends to be
 
04:11:54.670 --> 04:11:54.680 align:start position:0%
trans to get into a woman's room is not
 
04:11:57.670 --> 04:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
a trans woman he is a jerk and quite
 
04:11:59.950 --> 04:11:59.960 align:start position:0%
possibly a criminal this bill is
 
04:12:02.030 --> 04:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
discriminatory and hurtful and I implore
 
04:12:04.269 --> 04:12:04.279 align:start position:0%
you to oppose it thank you very much are
 
04:12:06.070 --> 04:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
there any questions from the
 
04:12:08.510 --> 04:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much thank you
 
04:12:21.910 --> 04:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:23.830 --> 04:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm represent Timothy Horan also
 
04:12:25.630 --> 04:12:25.640 align:start position:0%
from straford County District 10 which
 
04:12:28.469 --> 04:12:28.479 align:start position:0%
is also the town of Durham in my written
 
04:12:30.109 --> 04:12:30.119 align:start position:0%
testimony which you've all seen twice
 
04:12:31.830 --> 04:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
because I handed out printed copies and
 
04:12:33.269 --> 04:12:33.279 align:start position:0%
put it on the web portal I haven't
 
04:12:35.950 --> 04:12:35.960 align:start position:0%
emailed it to you I mentioned being a
 
04:12:37.550 --> 04:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
longtime season ticket holder for the
 
04:12:40.229 --> 04:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
Women's Basketball team so I guess I
 
04:12:42.389 --> 04:12:42.399 align:start position:0%
qualify they're uh not one of the top
 
04:12:44.910 --> 04:12:44.920 align:start position:0%
programs in the country country so that
 
04:12:46.229 --> 04:12:46.239 align:start position:0%
certainly shows at least some support
 
04:12:48.790 --> 04:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
for for women's sports um best my
 
04:12:50.309 --> 04:12:50.319 align:start position:0%
knowledge there's never been a trans
 
04:12:52.630 --> 04:12:52.640 align:start position:0%
athlete either on our team and and the
 
04:12:54.830 --> 04:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
opponent's team but it is certainly
 
04:12:58.229 --> 04:12:58.239 align:start position:0%
common place for uh common place for for
 
04:12:59.990 --> 04:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
men to be participating either as
 
04:13:02.670 --> 04:13:02.680 align:start position:0%
coaches um some teams including the UNH
 
04:13:04.229 --> 04:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
team sometimes we have practice players
 
04:13:05.830 --> 04:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
who come in and practice in the morning
 
04:13:08.389 --> 04:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
to you know round out the squads so they
 
04:13:11.309 --> 04:13:11.319 align:start position:0%
can do different types of um so um the
 
04:13:12.550 --> 04:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
whole thing with the locker rooms that's
 
04:13:14.510 --> 04:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
an issue they already uh deal with
 
04:13:15.870 --> 04:13:15.880 align:start position:0%
because there there's already male
 
04:13:17.590 --> 04:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
participants in female sports at the
 
04:13:18.710 --> 04:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
Collegiate level in the high school
 
04:13:20.030 --> 04:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
level there's already like female
 
04:13:21.510 --> 04:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
participants in the college sports both
 
04:13:23.229 --> 04:13:23.239 align:start position:0%
as players and also as trainers de
 
04:13:25.790 --> 04:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
casely as coaches
 
04:13:27.830 --> 04:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
um they um I probably should have
 
04:13:29.870 --> 04:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh of the UNH Women's
 
04:13:31.189 --> 04:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
Basketball team I should have mentioned
 
04:13:33.830 --> 04:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
our state champion uh oyer River girls
 
04:13:35.750 --> 04:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
track team which apparently won what was
 
04:13:37.550 --> 04:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
the most important sporting event at
 
04:13:39.030 --> 04:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
least According to some people not just
 
04:13:40.550 --> 04:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
for the participants for some people who
 
04:13:43.550 --> 04:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
weren't participants are very up uh
 
04:13:45.830 --> 04:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
concerned about it um what the division
 
04:13:48.469 --> 04:13:48.479 align:start position:0%
2 indoor girls track Championship which
 
04:13:50.149 --> 04:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
has uh been that subject a lot
 
04:13:51.469 --> 04:13:51.479 align:start position:0%
apparently that's bigger even than the
 
04:13:53.030 --> 04:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
division one Championship or even the
 
04:13:54.910 --> 04:13:54.920 align:start position:0%
Super Bowl which is on the same day and
 
04:13:56.429 --> 04:13:56.439 align:start position:0%
it certainly was for the participants I
 
04:13:58.790 --> 04:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
believe we have a participant off from
 
04:14:00.349 --> 04:14:00.359 align:start position:0%
Oyster River in the room so
 
04:14:02.189 --> 04:14:02.199 align:start position:0%
congratulations to everyone who
 
04:14:05.630 --> 04:14:05.640 align:start position:0%
participated whether they want uh so
 
04:14:08.269 --> 04:14:08.279 align:start position:0%
this band's biological males I'm not
 
04:14:10.870 --> 04:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
sure why being a biological male should
 
04:14:13.109 --> 04:14:13.119 align:start position:0%
Trump what your gender identity is um
 
04:14:14.950 --> 04:14:14.960 align:start position:0%
from participating in you know just
 
04:14:16.790 --> 04:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
about any school or college Bo just
 
04:14:18.189 --> 04:14:18.199 align:start position:0%
actually includes even the private
 
04:14:19.830 --> 04:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
schools who merely happen to have
 
04:14:21.630 --> 04:14:21.640 align:start position:0%
students who to wish the subsidized by
 
04:14:24.269 --> 04:14:24.279 align:start position:0%
the EFA School Voucher Program some of
 
04:14:27.030 --> 04:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
whom are even from from out of state so
 
04:14:29.149 --> 04:14:29.159 align:start position:0%
your two minutes are up okay so I just
 
04:14:31.070 --> 04:14:31.080 align:start position:0%
think this bill is cruel and unnecessary
 
04:14:32.630 --> 04:14:32.640 align:start position:0%
this should be left to the sanctioning
 
04:14:37.510 --> 04:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
bodies and in any case um being a trans
 
04:14:39.910 --> 04:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
but you know being being trans is very
 
04:14:42.710 --> 04:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
very difficult um it's it's one the most
 
04:14:44.229 --> 04:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
difficult things person can do and I
 
04:14:46.149 --> 04:14:46.159 align:start position:0%
don't think anybody is doing it just to
 
04:14:49.109 --> 04:14:49.119 align:start position:0%
unfairly win you know a Track medal or
 
04:14:51.269 --> 04:14:51.279 align:start position:0%
even a scholarship most women's
 
04:14:54.109 --> 04:14:54.119 align:start position:0%
scholarships are only partial most col
 
04:14:55.670 --> 04:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
scholarships any sports especially women
 
04:14:57.550 --> 04:14:57.560 align:start position:0%
sports us only partial scholarship so
 
04:14:59.269 --> 04:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of trouble to go to just for
 
04:15:01.590 --> 04:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
a partial scholarship nobody's doing it
 
04:15:02.870 --> 04:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
just for that and they're participating
 
04:15:06.870 --> 04:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
the sport for the same reason uh CIS CIS
 
04:15:08.750 --> 04:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
mail sis men and CIS women support
 
04:15:10.710 --> 04:15:10.720 align:start position:0%
because they love the sport so I was I
 
04:15:13.550 --> 04:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
would just say itl no I can also I'm
 
04:15:15.229 --> 04:15:15.239 align:start position:0%
spending my time here two minutes up
 
04:15:17.750 --> 04:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
repres the reason this bill the Senate
 
04:15:19.750 --> 04:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
bills were actually like more extensive
 
04:15:21.750 --> 04:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons they they left things
 
04:15:23.389 --> 04:15:23.399 align:start position:0%
out of the Senate bill is because the
 
04:15:25.550 --> 04:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
Senate rejected those things your time
 
04:15:27.750 --> 04:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
is up oh thank you of course yes yes
 
04:15:29.309 --> 04:15:29.319 align:start position:0%
we'll have to unpack in two minutes
 
04:15:30.790 --> 04:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
04:15:33.990 --> 04:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very
 
04:15:50.950 --> 04:15:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:53.429 --> 04:15:53.439 align:start position:0%
hello my name is Lind J house I oppose
 
04:15:55.189 --> 04:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
this bill there is no reason to change
 
04:15:56.750 --> 04:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire inter Scholastic
 
04:15:58.510 --> 04:15:58.520 align:start position:0%
Athletic Association policy that
 
04:16:01.349 --> 04:16:01.359 align:start position:0%
includes transgender athletes I'd like
 
04:16:03.630 --> 04:16:03.640 align:start position:0%
to read excert from testimony provided
 
04:16:05.109 --> 04:16:05.119 align:start position:0%
by a few people who could not be here
 
04:16:07.710 --> 04:16:07.720 align:start position:0%
today but first transgender athletes
 
04:16:09.750 --> 04:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
vary in athletic ability just like
 
04:16:12.429 --> 04:16:12.439 align:start position:0%
non-transgender athletes one high jumper
 
04:16:14.149 --> 04:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
could be tall and have longer legs than
 
04:16:15.750 --> 04:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
another but the other could have perfect
 
04:16:18.030 --> 04:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
form and then do better explains Andrea
 
04:16:20.269 --> 04:16:20.279 align:start position:0%
Yearwood a student track athlete one
 
04:16:21.990 --> 04:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
Sprinter could have parents who spend so
 
04:16:23.630 --> 04:16:23.640 align:start position:0%
much money on personal training for
 
04:16:25.790 --> 04:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
their child which in Cur which in turn
 
04:16:28.109 --> 04:16:28.119 align:start position:0%
could cause that child to run
 
04:16:30.670 --> 04:16:30.680 align:start position:0%
faster in Connecticut where U
 
04:16:32.469 --> 04:16:32.479 align:start position:0%
non-transgender girl runners have tried
 
04:16:34.269 --> 04:16:34.279 align:start position:0%
to block Andrea from participating in
 
04:16:36.469 --> 04:16:36.479 align:start position:0%
the sport she loves the very same girls
 
04:16:38.109 --> 04:16:38.119 align:start position:0%
who have claimed that trans athletes
 
04:16:40.550 --> 04:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
have an quote unquote unfair Advantage
 
04:16:42.910 --> 04:16:42.920 align:start position:0%
have consistently performed as well as
 
04:16:44.870 --> 04:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
or better than their transgender
 
04:16:47.149 --> 04:16:47.159 align:start position:0%
competitors overwhelmingly we do not
 
04:16:48.910 --> 04:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
question girls who are assigned female
 
04:16:51.030 --> 04:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
at Birth although some of them may be
 
04:16:53.189 --> 04:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
significantly taller or vary in hormone
 
04:16:56.630 --> 04:16:56.640 align:start position:0%
levels um or due to other um from other
 
04:16:59.710 --> 04:16:59.720 align:start position:0%
girls for example Runner Caster Sania
 
04:17:01.910 --> 04:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
who is assigned female at Birth despite
 
04:17:05.229 --> 04:17:05.239 align:start position:0%
having XY chromosomes um who is interx
 
04:17:07.429 --> 04:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
but identifies as a woman was still made
 
04:17:09.870 --> 04:17:09.880 align:start position:0%
to undergo sex testing before being
 
04:17:12.149 --> 04:17:12.159 align:start position:0%
cleared to play so if this bill were to
 
04:17:14.469 --> 04:17:14.479 align:start position:0%
pass it would ow for the questioning of
 
04:17:16.670 --> 04:17:16.680 align:start position:0%
gender non-conforming women who were
 
04:17:18.670 --> 04:17:18.680 align:start position:0%
signed female at Birth and identify as
 
04:17:21.109 --> 04:17:21.119 align:start position:0%
women a person's genetic makeup and
 
04:17:22.790 --> 04:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
internal and external reproductive
 
04:17:24.750 --> 04:17:24.760 align:start position:0%
Anatomy are not useful indicators of
 
04:17:26.750 --> 04:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
athletic performance according to Dr
 
04:17:29.469 --> 04:17:29.479 align:start position:0%
Joshua D safer for transwoman athlete
 
04:17:31.750 --> 04:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
who meets NCAA standards there is no
 
04:17:33.510 --> 04:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
inherent reason why her physiological
 
04:17:35.149 --> 04:17:35.159 align:start position:0%
characteristics related to athletic
 
04:17:36.269 --> 04:17:36.279 align:start position:0%
performance should be treated
 
04:17:38.910 --> 04:17:38.920 align:start position:0%
differently from a non-transgender
 
04:17:41.109 --> 04:17:41.119 align:start position:0%
women um those of you who are on this
 
04:17:42.830 --> 04:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
committee have likely heard from Lane
 
04:17:44.790 --> 04:17:44.800 align:start position:0%

04:17:46.389 --> 04:17:46.399 align:start position:0%

and throughout High School no one had a
 
04:17:54.830 --> 04:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
problem with me being transgender I
 
04:17:56.229 --> 04:17:56.239 align:start position:0%
guarantee that no one on the opposing
 
04:17:58.590 --> 04:17:58.600 align:start position:0%
teams even had any idea that I am
 
04:18:00.469 --> 04:18:00.479 align:start position:0%
transgender after I came out I was
 
04:18:02.030 --> 04:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
treated like all the other girls in
 
04:18:03.750 --> 04:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
every part of school in the classroom in
 
04:18:05.910 --> 04:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
the art studio on the theater stage and
 
04:18:08.630 --> 04:18:08.640 align:start position:0%

better than your first
 
04:18:27.550 --> 04:18:27.560 align:start position:0%
card I was going to rush I
 
04:18:31.750 --> 04:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
guess yes um my name is Roger blow I'm a
 
04:18:34.269 --> 04:18:34.279 align:start position:0%
Vietnam Veteran New Hampshire lifelong
 
04:18:37.670 --> 04:18:37.680 align:start position:0%
resident married 53 years to my
 
04:18:40.389 --> 04:18:40.399 align:start position:0%
sweetheart um the thing I want to talk
 
04:18:42.990 --> 04:18:43.000 align:start position:0%
about is this transgender stuff I have a
 
04:18:46.269 --> 04:18:46.279 align:start position:0%
transgender grandson and he's doing very
 
04:18:48.389 --> 04:18:48.399 align:start position:0%
well and I'm going to tell you he went
 
04:18:51.510 --> 04:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
through a lot the trans the transition a
 
04:18:52.910 --> 04:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
lot of family members went down to
 
04:18:54.950 --> 04:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
Boston to professionals and talked about
 
04:18:57.030 --> 04:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
it because we wanted to make sure as a
 
04:19:00.070 --> 04:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
teenager he wasn't just you know being
 
04:19:02.750 --> 04:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
uh difficult or you know trying to re
 
04:19:05.189 --> 04:19:05.199 align:start position:0%
you know reach out to to get his parents
 
04:19:08.030 --> 04:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
upset uh but they determined that he
 
04:19:10.670 --> 04:19:10.680 align:start position:0%
really feels in his in his true self his
 
04:19:12.790 --> 04:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
identity is that he's a boy and so so
 
04:19:15.670 --> 04:19:15.680 align:start position:0%
he's transitioned so he has a beard etc
 
04:19:19.109 --> 04:19:19.119 align:start position:0%
etc and he's doing very well um I asked
 
04:19:23.429 --> 04:19:23.439 align:start position:0%
him uh what I should comment he said I I
 
04:19:24.950 --> 04:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
mean I think the big thing would be
 
04:19:26.630 --> 04:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
talking about how everyone's hormone
 
04:19:28.510 --> 04:19:28.520 align:start position:0%
levels are different and when trans
 
04:19:30.189 --> 04:19:30.199 align:start position:0%
people take hormones that is monitored
 
04:19:31.830 --> 04:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
and kept within a normal range for their
 
04:19:33.910 --> 04:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
age so theoretically there is no
 
04:19:35.349 --> 04:19:35.359 align:start position:0%
difference in skill Advantage between
 
04:19:38.030 --> 04:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
trans and cisgender people I get blood
 
04:19:39.389 --> 04:19:39.399 align:start position:0%
blood work done to make sure my
 
04:19:41.510 --> 04:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
testosterone levels aren't too high or
 
04:19:43.189 --> 04:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
too low which is also something that s
 
04:19:46.189 --> 04:19:46.199 align:start position:0%
gender men can do as well as testing
 
04:19:49.070 --> 04:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
astrogel for women so basically the
 
04:19:52.070 --> 04:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
medical profession people deal with this
 
04:19:54.590 --> 04:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
at the time that he transgendered uh
 
04:19:57.109 --> 04:19:57.119 align:start position:0%
they were he was the 1500 person in this
 
04:19:59.149 --> 04:19:59.159 align:start position:0%
Boston hospital that did that and he's
 
04:20:02.189 --> 04:20:02.199 align:start position:0%
very happy uh before he did that he was
 
04:20:03.710 --> 04:20:03.720 align:start position:0%
not feeling comfortable with himself and
 
04:20:06.149 --> 04:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
he really needed it I really believe by
 
04:20:07.870 --> 04:20:07.880 align:start position:0%
the way I coach Sports a lot my three
 
04:20:09.349 --> 04:20:09.359 align:start position:0%
children five grandchildren all played a
 
04:20:11.870 --> 04:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
lot of sports and uh there's injuries
 
04:20:14.790 --> 04:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
all the time and the injuries that I
 
04:20:17.429 --> 04:20:17.439 align:start position:0%
seen they're all girl and girls it's not
 
04:20:19.670 --> 04:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
you know a transgender person doing it
 
04:20:22.550 --> 04:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
my granddaugh plays rugby pli broke her
 
04:20:24.870 --> 04:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
leg last year my other daughter that
 
04:20:27.070 --> 04:20:27.080 align:start position:0%
plays hockey potential girl on the team
 
04:20:29.269 --> 04:20:29.279 align:start position:0%
broke her ankle it was no transgender
 
04:20:32.429 --> 04:20:32.439 align:start position:0%
person trying to hurt them etc etc so I
 
04:20:34.229 --> 04:20:34.239 align:start position:0%
think what rep representative Milo said
 
04:20:36.149 --> 04:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
is the best thing there are so many
 
04:20:37.950 --> 04:20:37.960 align:start position:0%
transgender people that will benefit
 
04:20:40.070 --> 04:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
from allowing them to play compared to
 
04:20:41.990 --> 04:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
the few people that feel that oh it's
 
04:20:43.630 --> 04:20:43.640 align:start position:0%
unfair to the other girls I think that's
 
04:20:45.510 --> 04:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
at the best point a lot of people
 
04:20:47.590 --> 04:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
benefit your time is up okay thank you
 
04:20:49.790 --> 04:20:49.800 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions from
 
04:20:52.830 --> 04:20:52.840 align:start position:0%

04:21:16.389 --> 04:21:16.399 align:start position:0%
375 when I was seven I went to my first
 
04:21:18.109 --> 04:21:18.119 align:start position:0%
Red Sox game and right then and there I
 
04:21:19.790 --> 04:21:19.800 align:start position:0%

league Red Sox player I informed my mom
 
04:21:23.670 --> 04:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
and dad and the only thing they told me
 
04:21:25.149 --> 04:21:25.159 align:start position:0%
was that I had to practice practice
 
04:21:28.189 --> 04:21:28.199 align:start position:0%
practice so I did things went well for a
 
04:21:29.830 --> 04:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
while I was chosen to be the only girl
 
04:21:31.389 --> 04:21:31.399 align:start position:0%
on the Little League All-Star team and
 
04:21:32.710 --> 04:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
later was the only girl in the local
 
04:21:35.109 --> 04:21:35.119 align:start position:0%
Babe Ruth league then I went to high
 
04:21:37.269 --> 04:21:37.279 align:start position:0%
school what do you mean I have to play
 
04:21:39.149 --> 04:21:39.159 align:start position:0%
softball I asked if I could play
 
04:21:40.830 --> 04:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
freshman boys baseball and to their
 
04:21:42.670 --> 04:21:42.680 align:start position:0%
credit the coach and principal said yes
 
04:21:45.109 --> 04:21:45.119 align:start position:0%
yes so I joined the team but it became
 
04:21:47.109 --> 04:21:47.119 align:start position:0%
disappointingly clear very quickly that
 
04:21:48.670 --> 04:21:48.680 align:start position:0%
I would not be playing in the major
 
04:21:50.790 --> 04:21:50.800 align:start position:0%
leagues the boys seemingly overnight had
 
04:21:53.550 --> 04:21:53.560 align:start position:0%
become much faster stronger and taller I
 
04:21:55.149 --> 04:21:55.159 align:start position:0%
realized I was literally out of my
 
04:21:57.510 --> 04:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
league I made the difficult decision to
 
04:21:59.510 --> 04:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
switch to fast pitch softball we were a
 
04:22:01.269 --> 04:22:01.279 align:start position:0%
good team winning the state championship
 
04:22:03.070 --> 04:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
my junior year and Runners up my senior
 
04:22:05.269 --> 04:22:05.279 align:start position:0%
year despite the fact that we were state
 
04:22:07.229 --> 04:22:07.239 align:start position:0%
champions had any one of those freshman
 
04:22:08.710 --> 04:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
boys decided to play on the varsity
 
04:22:10.950 --> 04:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
girls softball team his ability would
 
04:22:12.750 --> 04:22:12.760 align:start position:0%
have surpassed the best varsity girls
 
04:22:15.590 --> 04:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
player on our team have you noticed that
 
04:22:17.429 --> 04:22:17.439 align:start position:0%
this is mostly a one-way street with
 
04:22:19.670 --> 04:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
individuals born boys seeking to play on
 
04:22:21.830 --> 04:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
a team made up of individuals born as
 
04:22:24.830 --> 04:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
girls these individuals would take an
 
04:22:26.750 --> 04:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity purposely carved out for
 
04:22:28.349 --> 04:22:28.359 align:start position:0%
girls and young women who until
 
04:22:30.389 --> 04:22:30.399 align:start position:0%
relatively recently traditionally had
 
04:22:32.990 --> 04:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
few to no options to play sports to
 
04:22:35.030 --> 04:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
allow individuals born as boys to play
 
04:22:37.109 --> 04:22:37.119 align:start position:0%
girls Sports will necessarily reduce
 
04:22:38.830 --> 04:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
opportunities for women to play and
 
04:22:42.830 --> 04:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
Excel in far in hard fought for Le of
 
04:22:45.309 --> 04:22:45.319 align:start position:0%
their own now I'd like to speak as a mom
 
04:22:47.309 --> 04:22:47.319 align:start position:0%
of female athletes last year my girls
 
04:22:48.630 --> 04:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
were in a volleyball league were an
 
04:22:50.990 --> 04:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
opposing team at a 6'2 in individual
 
04:22:53.269 --> 04:22:53.279 align:start position:0%
born as a male play on the girls team
 
04:22:54.990 --> 04:22:55.000 align:start position:0%
our girls coach was concerned for the
 
04:22:56.630 --> 04:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
safety of her team most of the girls
 
04:22:59.269 --> 04:22:59.279 align:start position:0%
were 55 or under and instructed them to
 
04:23:00.790 --> 04:23:00.800 align:start position:0%
get out of the way and give the other
 
04:23:02.510 --> 04:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
team the point when this individual Was
 
04:23:05.510 --> 04:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
preparing to spike the ball thank God no
 
04:23:07.429 --> 04:23:07.439 align:start position:0%
one was hurt and our school subsequently
 
04:23:09.070 --> 04:23:09.080 align:start position:0%
made the difficult decision to pull out
 
04:23:10.510 --> 04:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
of the league because the school didn't
 
04:23:12.990 --> 04:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
want to put the girls in physical Danger
 
04:23:14.710 --> 04:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
this individual has been since been
 
04:23:16.550 --> 04:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
documented to have hurt opposing female
 
04:23:18.030 --> 04:23:18.040 align:start position:0%
players while playing against them in
 
04:23:20.109 --> 04:23:20.119 align:start position:0%
other sports your time is up okay what
 
04:23:22.590 --> 04:23:22.600 align:start position:0%
sum summing up women fought long and
 
04:23:24.750 --> 04:23:24.760 align:start position:0%
hard to have athletic teams of their own
 
04:23:26.590 --> 04:23:26.600 align:start position:0%
to allow individuals born as boys to
 
04:23:28.269 --> 04:23:28.279 align:start position:0%
take those opportunities from girls and
 
04:23:29.910 --> 04:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
women and to put women back women and
 
04:23:31.429 --> 04:23:31.439 align:start position:0%
girls in physical danger due to their
 
04:23:33.550 --> 04:23:33.560 align:start position:0%
size strength and speed would be turning
 
04:23:35.269 --> 04:23:35.279 align:start position:0%
back the clock to a time when women were
 
04:23:36.990 --> 04:23:37.000 align:start position:0%
sidelined with their only option to
 
04:23:39.349 --> 04:23:39.359 align:start position:0%
cheer on the men I ask you to stand up
 
04:23:40.830 --> 04:23:40.840 align:start position:0%

good afternoon esteemed committee
 
04:24:23.910 --> 04:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
members and thank you for taking your
 
04:24:27.309 --> 04:24:27.319 align:start position:0%
time and attention to discuss s SP 375
 
04:24:29.469 --> 04:24:29.479 align:start position:0%
with us my name is Sarah Terrell I'm a
 
04:24:30.870 --> 04:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
resident of Plymouth New Hampshire in
 
04:24:33.349 --> 04:24:33.359 align:start position:0%
District 5 and I am a parent of a
 
04:24:35.710 --> 04:24:35.720 align:start position:0%
transgender athlete I implore you to
 
04:24:37.630 --> 04:24:37.640 align:start position:0%
consider the profound impact this bill
 
04:24:39.070 --> 04:24:39.080 align:start position:0%
will have on my daughter and countless
 
04:24:41.269 --> 04:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
others in the state I understand the
 
04:24:42.670 --> 04:24:42.680 align:start position:0%
Allure of succumbing to is the
 
04:24:44.389 --> 04:24:44.399 align:start position:0%
sensationalized narrative surrounding
 
04:24:46.590 --> 04:24:46.600 align:start position:0%
transgender athletes however I urge you
 
04:24:48.830 --> 04:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
to rise above the fear-driven rhetoric
 
04:24:50.510 --> 04:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
and instead heed the guidance of medical
 
04:24:52.149 --> 04:24:52.159 align:start position:0%
and mental health experts who advocate
 
04:24:55.070 --> 04:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
for inclusive Sports environments we
 
04:24:57.109 --> 04:24:57.119 align:start position:0%
have a petition to share with you today
 
04:24:58.870 --> 04:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
that is signed by almost 200 women
 
04:25:00.189 --> 04:25:00.199 align:start position:0%
athletes across the state of New
 
04:25:01.590 --> 04:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who have voiced their support
 
04:25:03.590 --> 04:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
for their transgender teammates
 
04:25:04.910 --> 04:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
underscoring the importance of
 
04:25:07.149 --> 04:25:07.159 align:start position:0%
solidarity and inclusion in our athletic
 
04:25:09.070 --> 04:25:09.080 align:start position:0%
communities it's disheartening to
 
04:25:10.790 --> 04:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
witness the disproportionate focus on
 
04:25:12.710 --> 04:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
such a small subset of student athletes
 
04:25:14.710 --> 04:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
in our state for nearly a decade
 
04:25:16.790 --> 04:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
existing rules and policies set by the
 
04:25:19.309 --> 04:25:19.319 align:start position:0%
nhaa that allow transgender girls to
 
04:25:21.590 --> 04:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
play on girls teams have effectively
 
04:25:23.990 --> 04:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
governed transgender participation in
 
04:25:26.269 --> 04:25:26.279 align:start position:0%
sports without incident injuries and
 
04:25:28.469 --> 04:25:28.479 align:start position:0%
unfairness are not rampant on our fields
 
04:25:31.229 --> 04:25:31.239 align:start position:0%
on our tracks or our courts due to
 
04:25:33.790 --> 04:25:33.800 align:start position:0%
transgender athletes if safety is a
 
04:25:35.469 --> 04:25:35.479 align:start position:0%
genuine concern then
 
04:25:37.510 --> 04:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
let's direct our efforts towards
 
04:25:39.229 --> 04:25:39.239 align:start position:0%
meaningful initiatives such as increased
 
04:25:41.710 --> 04:25:41.720 align:start position:0%
funding for athletic trainers on site
 
04:25:44.030 --> 04:25:44.040 align:start position:0%
enhanced coaching and referee training
 
04:25:46.309 --> 04:25:46.319 align:start position:0%
and perhaps even improved Pro concussion
 
04:25:48.389 --> 04:25:48.399 align:start position:0%
protocols discriminating against a
 
04:25:50.269 --> 04:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
marginalized group of student athletes
 
04:25:52.670 --> 04:25:52.680 align:start position:0%
serves no purpose other than to inflict
 
04:25:54.389 --> 04:25:54.399 align:start position:0%
unnecessary harm on girls like my
 
04:25:55.750 --> 04:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
daughter who should be able to
 
04:25:57.550 --> 04:25:57.560 align:start position:0%
participate in every aspect of daily
 
04:25:59.790 --> 04:25:59.800 align:start position:0%
life as who she is including on the
 
04:26:02.630 --> 04:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
soccer field I implore you to prioritize
 
04:26:05.630 --> 04:26:05.640 align:start position:0%
fairness inclusivity and evidence-based
 
04:26:07.229 --> 04:26:07.239 align:start position:0%
decision-making in your deliberations
 
04:26:10.309 --> 04:26:10.319 align:start position:0%
over SB 375 let's work together to
 
04:26:11.870 --> 04:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
ensure the safety and well-being of all
 
04:26:13.670 --> 04:26:13.680 align:start position:0%

I am that I want to share with you I'm
 
04:26:51.229 --> 04:26:51.239 align:start position:0%
transgender I'm here today to express my
 
04:26:54.309 --> 04:26:54.319 align:start position:0%
deep concern regarding SB 375 and S and
 
04:26:56.670 --> 04:26:56.680 align:start position:0%
similar legislative efforts aimed at
 
04:26:58.469 --> 04:26:58.479 align:start position:0%
barring transgender students like me
 
04:27:00.790 --> 04:27:00.800 align:start position:0%
from participating in sports despite
 
04:27:02.309 --> 04:27:02.319 align:start position:0%
just being a regular teenager with a
 
04:27:04.910 --> 04:27:04.920 align:start position:0%
passion for soccer I found myself facing
 
04:27:06.630 --> 04:27:06.640 align:start position:0%
the threat of exclusion simply because
 
04:27:09.229 --> 04:27:09.239 align:start position:0%
of who I am let me be clear I am not a
 
04:27:12.269 --> 04:27:12.279 align:start position:0%
physical threat to peers on the field on
 
04:27:14.070 --> 04:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
the field nor do I seek any unfair
 
04:27:15.790 --> 04:27:15.800 align:start position:0%
Advantage by playing on a girl sports
 
04:27:17.950 --> 04:27:17.960 align:start position:0%
team I play soccer because I love the
 
04:27:19.870 --> 04:27:19.880 align:start position:0%
sport the camaraderie and the
 
04:27:22.389 --> 04:27:22.399 align:start position:0%
opportunity to grow as an athlete even
 
04:27:24.229 --> 04:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
if we don't win a game my coach sh takes
 
04:27:28.149 --> 04:27:28.159 align:start position:0%

04:27:29.790 --> 04:27:29.800 align:start position:0%
the restaurant yeah taking over the
 
04:27:31.030 --> 04:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
restaurant with my team is one of my
 
04:27:32.550 --> 04:27:32.560 align:start position:0%
favorite memories from this past soccer
 
04:27:34.469 --> 04:27:34.479 align:start position:0%
season it is disheartening to see
 
04:27:36.349 --> 04:27:36.359 align:start position:0%
lawmakers pushing for discriminatory me
 
04:27:38.630 --> 04:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
measures without taking any without
 
04:27:40.349 --> 04:27:40.359 align:start position:0%
taking any time to understand the real
 
04:27:42.510 --> 04:27:42.520 align:start position:0%
impact it has on students like me why my
 
04:27:44.269 --> 04:27:44.279 align:start position:0%
safety any less important to that of my
 
04:27:45.830 --> 04:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
peers claims that I should play on the
 
04:27:47.030 --> 04:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
team based on my assigned gender of

soccer team it's not just about the
 
04:27:55.830 --> 04:27:55.840 align:start position:0%

Trumble

04:29:28.910 --> 04:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
Trumble
 
04:29:38.510 --> 04:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:40.910 --> 04:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
be thank you Mr chairman my name is
 
04:29:42.670 --> 04:29:42.680 align:start position:0%
David Trumble and I'm a opposed to this
 
04:29:44.269 --> 04:29:44.279 align:start position:0%
bill for a few reasons first the
 
04:29:46.109 --> 04:29:46.119 align:start position:0%
language in this bill is incredibly
 
04:29:49.070 --> 04:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
disrespectful it refers to transgender
 
04:29:52.229 --> 04:29:52.239 align:start position:0%
women as men if a transgender woman
 
04:29:54.189 --> 04:29:54.199 align:start position:0%
serves in the United States Army they
 
04:29:56.910 --> 04:29:56.920 align:start position:0%
get to serve as the gender they identify
 
04:29:58.510 --> 04:29:58.520 align:start position:0%
with but if that person comes home and
 
04:30:00.910 --> 04:30:00.920 align:start position:0%
goes to UNH and decides to run track
 
04:30:03.630 --> 04:30:03.640 align:start position:0%
they're no longer a Woman by the words
 
04:30:05.830 --> 04:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
of this bill they have now become a man
 
04:30:07.630 --> 04:30:07.640 align:start position:0%
this is incredibly disrespectful
 
04:30:09.510 --> 04:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
language second this bill is
 
04:30:11.590 --> 04:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with all of the major
 
04:30:13.710 --> 04:30:13.720 align:start position:0%
athletic organizations the international
 
04:30:15.630 --> 04:30:15.640 align:start position:0%
Olympic committee's policy is based on
 
04:30:17.469 --> 04:30:17.479 align:start position:0%
safe inclusive and an equitable
 
04:30:19.389 --> 04:30:19.399 align:start position:0%
environment and based on evidence it's
 
04:30:21.229 --> 04:30:21.239 align:start position:0%
the same three criteria that Senator
 
04:30:24.189 --> 04:30:24.199 align:start position:0%
Lang came up with but the ioc does not
 
04:30:26.469 --> 04:30:26.479 align:start position:0%
ban transgender women from competing in
 
04:30:29.030 --> 04:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
female sports they use the same criteria
 
04:30:31.229 --> 04:30:31.239 align:start position:0%
to come to a different conclusion the
 
04:30:34.229 --> 04:30:34.239 align:start position:0%
NCAA does not ban transgender women from
 
04:30:36.309 --> 04:30:36.319 align:start position:0%
competing in fact they have said that if
 
04:30:38.710 --> 04:30:38.720 align:start position:0%
States pass laws like this they won't be
 
04:30:41.309 --> 04:30:41.319 align:start position:0%
able to host NCAA tournaments and then
 
04:30:43.030 --> 04:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
at the local level of New Hampshire you
 
04:30:47.550 --> 04:30:47.560 align:start position:0%
have the nhiaa policy global national
 
04:30:50.070 --> 04:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
and state level all of the international
 
04:30:51.910 --> 04:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
all of the athletic organizations say
 
04:30:55.030 --> 04:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
this proposed bill doesn't match let's
 
04:30:56.189 --> 04:30:56.199 align:start position:0%
look at the
 
04:30:59.149 --> 04:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
evidence the Journal sports medicine did
 
04:31:01.630 --> 04:31:01.640 align:start position:0%
a study and they looked at all of the
 
04:31:03.030 --> 04:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
the literature on this and they
 
04:31:05.070 --> 04:31:05.080 align:start position:0%
concluded there is no direct or
 
04:31:06.469 --> 04:31:06.479 align:start position:0%
consistent research suggesting
 
04:31:08.630 --> 04:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
transgender female athletes have an
 
04:31:10.590 --> 04:31:10.600 align:start position:0%
athletic advantage at any stage of their
 
04:31:12.550 --> 04:31:12.560 align:start position:0%
transition the majority aity of sports
 
04:31:14.910 --> 04:31:14.920 align:start position:0%
policies unfairly exclude trans people
 
04:31:16.870 --> 04:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
from competitive sport the Canadian
 
04:31:18.910 --> 04:31:18.920 align:start position:0%
Center for ethic Sports said there's no
 
04:31:20.550 --> 04:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
firm basis available in evidence to
 
04:31:22.550 --> 04:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
indicate trans women have a consistent
 
04:31:24.109 --> 04:31:24.119 align:start position:0%
and measurable overall performance
 
04:31:26.109 --> 04:31:26.119 align:start position:0%
benefit after 12 months of testosterone
 
04:31:28.109 --> 04:31:28.119 align:start position:0%
supression Senator Lang cited the
 
04:31:30.269 --> 04:31:30.279 align:start position:0%
American collegey of sports medicine but
 
04:31:33.429 --> 04:31:33.439 align:start position:0%
their report said quote does not make
 
04:31:35.229 --> 04:31:35.239 align:start position:0%
any policy recommendations which are
 
04:31:36.990 --> 04:31:37.000 align:start position:0%
outside the scope of his purpose so it's
 
04:31:38.910 --> 04:31:38.920 align:start position:0%
a misstatement to suggest that that
 
04:31:41.109 --> 04:31:41.119 align:start position:0%
study should be used to make policy but
 
04:31:43.030 --> 04:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
you have other that suggest there is no
 
04:31:45.189 --> 04:31:45.199 align:start position:0%
competitive Advantage thank you thank
 
04:31:46.670 --> 04:31:46.680 align:start position:0%

04:32:19.590 --> 04:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
have been an integral part to My
 
04:32:22.630 --> 04:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
belonging playing playing soccer since
 
04:32:24.429 --> 04:32:24.439 align:start position:0%
the age of three when I began my
 
04:32:26.189 --> 04:32:26.199 align:start position:0%
transition in the sixth grade my school
 
04:32:28.349 --> 04:32:28.359 align:start position:0%
welcomed me onto the girls team this act
 
04:32:30.189 --> 04:32:30.199 align:start position:0%
of being able to be a part of the teams
 
04:32:32.070 --> 04:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
I belonged to allowed me to skip through
 
04:32:34.389 --> 04:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
the phase of social ostracization as the
 
04:32:36.710 --> 04:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
other girls accepted me for who I was
 
04:32:38.670 --> 04:32:38.680 align:start position:0%
and welcomed me especially by their
 
04:32:40.630 --> 04:32:40.640 align:start position:0%
locker room rituals like the ones where
 
04:32:42.189 --> 04:32:42.199 align:start position:0%
we go around and give a word of how we
 
04:32:44.790 --> 04:32:44.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to perform that game being part
 
04:32:46.429 --> 04:32:46.439 align:start position:0%
of the team allowed me to be seen as
 
04:32:48.309 --> 04:32:48.319 align:start position:0%
normal or everywhere else I could be
 
04:32:50.830 --> 04:32:50.840 align:start position:0%
perceived as a pariah I didn't join
 
04:32:52.469 --> 04:32:52.479 align:start position:0%
sports with the goal of dominating
 
04:32:54.349 --> 04:32:54.359 align:start position:0%
competition or being better than anyone
 
04:32:55.910 --> 04:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
else no one would go through the
 
04:32:58.030 --> 04:32:58.040 align:start position:0%
bullying and self-hatred of transition
 
04:33:00.269 --> 04:33:00.279 align:start position:0%
purely to win a sport especially women's
 
04:33:02.349 --> 04:33:02.359 align:start position:0%
sports which are underappreciated in our
 
04:33:05.109 --> 04:33:05.119 align:start position:0%
nation I joined because it's something
 
04:33:07.390 --> 04:33:07.400 align:start position:0%
I'm passionate about and enjoy if banned
 
04:33:09.029 --> 04:33:09.039 align:start position:0%
from sports teams and locker rooms
 
04:33:10.551 --> 04:33:10.561 align:start position:0%
joining the mail teams wouldn't even be
 
04:33:12.551 --> 04:33:12.561 align:start position:0%
a choice for me with the and threats I'd
 
04:33:14.629 --> 04:33:14.639 align:start position:0%

04:34:40.199 --> 04:34:43.230 align:start position:0%
are teacher and I writing on the board
sorry

04:34:43.230 --> 04:34:43.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:52.750 --> 04:34:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:54.949 --> 04:34:54.959 align:start position:0%
side I'm from
 
04:34:57.949 --> 04:34:57.959 align:start position:0%
where quote if you consider yourself a
 
04:34:59.869 --> 04:34:59.879 align:start position:0%
girl and you want to play sports you
 
04:35:02.670 --> 04:35:02.680 align:start position:0%
should be able to play that quote comes
 
04:35:05.390 --> 04:35:05.400 align:start position:0%
from winning South Carolina basketball
 
04:35:09.551 --> 04:35:09.561 align:start position:0%
coach Dawn Staley these kids are real
 
04:35:12.070 --> 04:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
every major medical and mental Health
 
04:35:15.070 --> 04:35:15.080 align:start position:0%
Association supports transgender people
 
04:35:17.349 --> 04:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
and acknowledges their truth but it's
 
04:35:19.869 --> 04:35:19.879 align:start position:0%
hard to hear the truth over the D of
 
04:35:23.310 --> 04:35:23.320 align:start position:0%
vicious conspiracy theories if everybody
 
04:35:26.629 --> 04:35:26.639 align:start position:0%
knows that men are men and women are
 
04:35:30.109 --> 04:35:30.119 align:start position:0%
women as I so often hear what box do we
 
04:35:33.070 --> 04:35:33.080 align:start position:0%
check for interex people whose physical
 
04:35:35.670 --> 04:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
characteristics and chromosomes do not
 
04:35:38.670 --> 04:35:38.680 align:start position:0%
fit the binary and who by the way make
 
04:35:41.390 --> 04:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
up as large a group as transgender
 
04:35:43.629 --> 04:35:43.639 align:start position:0%
people people here's another thing that
 
04:35:46.230 --> 04:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
upsets the binary there are studies that
 
04:35:49.709 --> 04:35:49.719 align:start position:0%
indicate that before hormones even
 
04:35:52.470 --> 04:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
transgender female brains have more in
 
04:35:53.789 --> 04:35:53.799 align:start position:0%
common than
 
04:35:56.869 --> 04:35:56.879 align:start position:0%
cisgender with cisgender female brains
 
04:36:00.629 --> 04:36:00.639 align:start position:0%
than with male brains the report fair
 
04:36:03.269 --> 04:36:03.279 align:start position:0%
play details the benefits and as they
 
04:36:06.990 --> 04:36:07.000 align:start position:0%
say transgender youth are already
 
04:36:09.510 --> 04:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
vulnerable Banning them from Sports
 
04:36:12.349 --> 04:36:12.359 align:start position:0%
further legitimizes trans trans phobic
 
04:36:14.590 --> 04:36:14.600 align:start position:0%
attitudes there are dozens of these
 
04:36:17.629 --> 04:36:17.639 align:start position:0%
bills and yet there are so few students
 
04:36:19.670 --> 04:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
one report I read and all these are
 
04:36:22.470 --> 04:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
footnoted in your copy one report I read
 
04:36:25.269 --> 04:36:25.279 align:start position:0%
said that as of a year ago there might
 
04:36:28.109 --> 04:36:28.119 align:start position:0%
be only 100
 
04:36:31.990 --> 04:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
transgender girls playing sports in high
 
04:36:34.310 --> 04:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
schools across this country and yet
 
04:36:37.551 --> 04:36:37.561 align:start position:0%
there's so much outrage why aren't we
 
04:36:42.470 --> 04:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
outraged that the top WNBA pick female
 
04:36:44.949 --> 04:36:44.959 align:start position:0%
is only being offered
 
04:36:48.070 --> 04:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
$76,000 while the top male is being
 
04:36:51.869 --> 04:36:51.879 align:start position:0%
offered 105 million why aren't we
 
04:36:56.070 --> 04:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
outraged by the girls um swim teams and
 
04:36:58.470 --> 04:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
Gymnastic teams that we heard about
 
04:37:00.869 --> 04:37:00.879 align:start position:0%
where the coaches were abusing them
 
04:37:02.510 --> 04:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
those are the things we should be
 
04:37:06.670 --> 04:37:06.680 align:start position:0%
outraged about not about this Sports
 
04:37:09.789 --> 04:37:09.799 align:start position:0%
aren't Fair they aren't we're different
 
04:37:12.310 --> 04:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
sizes different abilities different
 
04:37:15.629 --> 04:37:15.639 align:start position:0%
coaching and for every team of 10 fully
 
04:37:19.109 --> 04:37:19.119 align:start position:0%
cisgender girls there are two three four
 
04:37:21.869 --> 04:37:21.879 align:start position:0%
five six seven cisgender girls that
 
04:37:23.949 --> 04:37:23.959 align:start position:0%
don't make it it has nothing to do with
 
04:37:26.269 --> 04:37:26.279 align:start position:0%
a trans kid on the
 
04:37:28.310 --> 04:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
team I would
 
04:37:33.310 --> 04:37:33.320 align:start position:0%
say that the ultimate in
 
04:37:37.750 --> 04:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
unfairness is othering and erasing this
 
04:37:42.470 --> 04:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
very small group of kids who just want
 
04:37:46.470 --> 04:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
to play and I stand with this coach and
 
04:37:49.709 --> 04:37:49.719 align:start position:0%
she stands with these kids and I am so
 
04:37:56.990 --> 04:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:00.109 --> 04:38:00.119 align:start position:0%
won okay uh any questions from the
 
04:38:00.119 --> 04:38:03.070 align:start position:0%
won okay uh any questions from the
committee

04:38:03.070 --> 04:38:03.080 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:38:08.349 --> 04:38:08.359 align:start position:0%
yes th this bill wants to uh establish
 
04:38:13.070 --> 04:38:13.080 align:start position:0%
um I guess sexual identity at down to
 
04:38:15.869 --> 04:38:15.879 align:start position:0%
the sixth grade it doesn't apply below
 
04:38:18.789 --> 04:38:18.799 align:start position:0%
sixth grade fifth grade or below at
 
04:38:20.789 --> 04:38:20.799 align:start position:0%
sixth grade at least from my memory and
 
04:38:22.830 --> 04:38:22.840 align:start position:0%
I would like to know from your
 
04:38:27.150 --> 04:38:27.160 align:start position:0%
experience uh kids are very undeveloped
 
04:38:28.869 --> 04:38:28.879 align:start position:0%
at that point at sixth grade the thing
 
04:38:30.551 --> 04:38:30.561 align:start position:0%
that they need to learn more than they
 
04:38:32.349 --> 04:38:32.359 align:start position:0%
probably need to learn anything else is
 
04:38:35.629 --> 04:38:35.639 align:start position:0%
social interactions and how to be team
 
04:38:37.949 --> 04:38:37.959 align:start position:0%
members and all that sort of
 
04:38:40.789 --> 04:38:40.799 align:start position:0%
thing this bill seeks to take that away
 
04:38:43.670 --> 04:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
what is your experience as a teacher in
 
04:38:46.750 --> 04:38:46.760 align:start position:0%
noting the ability of sixth graders for
 
04:38:50.709 --> 04:38:50.719 align:start position:0%
instance uh to be outed you know made
 
04:38:53.390 --> 04:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
into other made made into
 
04:38:55.310 --> 04:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know what it called
 
04:38:57.590 --> 04:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
marginalized individuals yeah it's it's
 
04:38:59.670 --> 04:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
terrible I taught Middle School I taught
 
04:39:02.510 --> 04:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
high school and uh what happens to these
 
04:39:05.709 --> 04:39:05.719 align:start position:0%
kids and in my experience um it was more
 
04:39:08.670 --> 04:39:08.680 align:start position:0%
often gay kids that were outed and it is
 
04:39:12.029 --> 04:39:12.039 align:start position:0%
cruel it is awful and need to be
 
04:39:15.990 --> 04:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
teaching kindness and support and
 
04:39:19.349 --> 04:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
inclusivity and not othering little
 
04:39:21.629 --> 04:39:21.639 align:start position:0%
groups um Chris
 
04:39:24.910 --> 04:39:24.920 align:start position:0%
kristopherson has a song that one of the
 
04:39:27.551 --> 04:39:27.561 align:start position:0%
lines is and he talks about all the
 
04:39:30.189 --> 04:39:30.199 align:start position:0%
groups that are against each other and
 
04:39:32.830 --> 04:39:32.840 align:start position:0%
he says cuz everybody's got to have
 
04:39:35.709 --> 04:39:35.719 align:start position:0%
somebody to look down on and that's how
 
04:39:38.628 --> 04:39:38.638 align:start position:0%
I feel when I hear the hate directed
 
04:39:41.390 --> 04:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
against these children it really bothers
 
04:39:43.868 --> 04:39:43.878 align:start position:0%
mothers me any further questions from
 
04:39:46.628 --> 04:39:46.638 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you very much thank
 
04:39:56.070 --> 04:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:00.190 --> 04:40:00.200 align:start position:0%
Bata thank you I'm Laura Bata from
 
04:40:03.708 --> 04:40:03.718 align:start position:0%
Hudson um my interest in this primarily
 
04:40:06.070 --> 04:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
my I guess my insight as a former public
 
04:40:09.350 --> 04:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
school student um is the locker room
 
04:40:11.948 --> 04:40:11.958 align:start position:0%
angle um we are in New New England I
 
04:40:14.708 --> 04:40:14.718 align:start position:0%
want to reference back I believe it was
 
04:40:17.910 --> 04:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh roughly around 2002 plus or minus a
 
04:40:20.670 --> 04:40:20.680 align:start position:0%
little bit I was a high school student
 
04:40:24.270 --> 04:40:24.280 align:start position:0%
and I read in the Hartford current about
 
04:40:29.830 --> 04:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
males seeking these new ID changes and I
 
04:40:31.830 --> 04:40:31.840 align:start position:0%
being an intelligent person reading
 
04:40:34.190 --> 04:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
science fiction reading history I saw oh
 
04:40:37.948 --> 04:40:37.958 align:start position:0%
male ID changes to to an X or to an F
 
04:40:39.150 --> 04:40:39.160 align:start position:0%
Well that that would let them in the
 
04:40:42.910 --> 04:40:42.920 align:start position:0%
locker room and way back then I asked
 
04:40:46.030 --> 04:40:46.040 align:start position:0%
the adults in my life I said what if all
 
04:40:48.670 --> 04:40:48.680 align:start position:0%
this goes through I said I'm not going
 
04:40:51.708 --> 04:40:51.718 align:start position:0%
to school I am not taking my clothes off
 
04:40:54.030 --> 04:40:54.040 align:start position:0%
in front of biological men no matter
 
04:40:57.788 --> 04:40:57.798 align:start position:0%
what their identification says I said if
 
04:40:59.708 --> 04:40:59.718 align:start position:0%
something like this goes through I will
 
04:41:03.430 --> 04:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
refuse school you'll have to homeschool
 
04:41:07.310 --> 04:41:07.320 align:start position:0%
me so today seeing what has happened
 
04:41:09.550 --> 04:41:09.560 align:start position:0%
what would have been called utter
 
04:41:09.560 --> 04:41:11.350 align:start position:0%
what would have been called utter
Madness

04:41:11.350 --> 04:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
Madness
 
04:41:14.350 --> 04:41:14.360 align:start position:0%
not so many years ago I am here to stand
 
04:41:18.030 --> 04:41:18.040 align:start position:0%
up for the girls whatever girls who say
 
04:41:20.310 --> 04:41:20.320 align:start position:0%
gee I want to play sports but I guess I
 
04:41:22.470 --> 04:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
got to put up with so and so in in the
 
04:41:24.030 --> 04:41:24.040 align:start position:0%
locker room and maybe they're looking at
 
04:41:27.430 --> 04:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
me or the girls who say oh I'm scared
 
04:41:29.390 --> 04:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
off about this I'm just not going to
 
04:41:32.270 --> 04:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
play sports how many girls have are are
 
04:41:35.070 --> 04:41:35.080 align:start position:0%
are in that situation overall there has
 
04:41:38.230 --> 04:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
been a chilling effect on Free Speech I
 
04:41:41.990 --> 04:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
do not believe that people feel free to
 
04:41:44.470 --> 04:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
say how they really feel what will their
 
04:41:46.390 --> 04:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
college say what will their future
 
04:41:51.670 --> 04:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
employer say I am asking you to take a
 
04:41:55.990 --> 04:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
sober approach to basic Common Sense
 
04:41:58.270 --> 04:41:58.280 align:start position:0%
girls shouldn't be taking their clothes
 
04:42:01.868 --> 04:42:01.878 align:start position:0%
off in front of biological males for any
 
04:42:03.868 --> 04:42:03.878 align:start position:0%
opportunity thank you thank you very
 
04:42:06.510 --> 04:42:06.520 align:start position:0%
much are there questions from the
 
04:42:12.030 --> 04:42:12.040 align:start position:0%
committee thank you uh Christina can
 
04:42:25.150 --> 04:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:28.470 --> 04:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
scar hi I'm best scare from nashwa um I
 
04:42:30.190 --> 04:42:30.200 align:start position:0%
just wanted to respond to some earlier
 
04:42:34.230 --> 04:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
people testifying um representative cig
 
04:42:36.628 --> 04:42:36.638 align:start position:0%
um said that heterosexual men are not
 
04:42:40.150 --> 04:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
trans women a large percentage of trans
 
04:42:42.390 --> 04:42:42.400 align:start position:0%
women are heter hetosexual and are
 
04:42:44.910 --> 04:42:44.920 align:start position:0%
sexually attracted to women so that's
 
04:42:46.628 --> 04:42:46.638 align:start position:0%
just one more reason why they shouldn't
 
04:42:50.430 --> 04:42:50.440 align:start position:0%
be in our locker rooms it's called
 
04:42:54.390 --> 04:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
autophilia and the NH responding to uh
 
04:42:56.948 --> 04:42:56.958 align:start position:0%
Roger I believe it was the nhiaa does
 
04:42:59.110 --> 04:42:59.120 align:start position:0%
not require any hormones there are no
 
04:43:01.788 --> 04:43:01.798 align:start position:0%
hormone levels to check there's no
 
04:43:04.550 --> 04:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
verification that they're doing anything
 
04:43:05.990 --> 04:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
that the boys are doing anything but
 
04:43:09.150 --> 04:43:09.160 align:start position:0%
putting on a uniform and claiming to be
 
04:43:12.708 --> 04:43:12.718 align:start position:0%
girls and as far as Parker's
 
04:43:15.830 --> 04:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
testimony um Parker is concerned that
 
04:43:18.910 --> 04:43:18.920 align:start position:0%
it's not safe to play for Parker to play
 
04:43:21.430 --> 04:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
on a male team well why is it safe for
 
04:43:25.470 --> 04:43:25.480 align:start position:0%
girls to play with males on their team I

bill but we are living in a surreal
 
04:47:23.750 --> 04:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
world where actual science is being
 
04:47:27.190 --> 04:47:27.200 align:start position:0%
cancelled and social science Rules an
 
04:47:29.430 --> 04:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
example is when a person can make the
 
04:47:32.110 --> 04:47:32.120 align:start position:0%
statement trans girls are girls that
 
04:47:35.350 --> 04:47:35.360 align:start position:0%
goes directly against science actual
 
04:47:38.788 --> 04:47:38.798 align:start position:0%
science you must judge which issue
 
04:47:41.430 --> 04:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
carries more weight people people's
 
04:47:44.310 --> 04:47:44.320 align:start position:0%
feelings about who they are and people
 
04:47:47.868 --> 04:47:47.878 align:start position:0%

04:47:50.230 --> 04:47:50.240 align:start position:0%
goes on in these sporting events and
 
04:47:51.590 --> 04:47:51.600 align:start position:0%

children we are here in strong
 
04:48:43.590 --> 04:48:43.600 align:start position:0%
opposition to Senate Bill 375 because

transgender and non-binary youth deserve
 
04:48:48.150 --> 04:48:48.160 align:start position:0%

themselves and live without the burdens
 
04:49:04.390 --> 04:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
of poor mental health however
 
04:49:07.110 --> 04:49:07.120 align:start position:0%
unfortunately our young people
 
04:49:09.190 --> 04:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
especially those who identify as trans
 
04:49:10.708 --> 04:49:10.718 align:start position:0%
are undergoing severe mental health
 
04:49:12.750 --> 04:49:12.760 align:start position:0%
Health crisis due to feeling
 
04:49:15.948 --> 04:49:15.958 align:start position:0%
discriminated against when young people
 
04:49:18.110 --> 04:49:18.120 align:start position:0%
are Fel uh feel supported in their
 
04:49:20.070 --> 04:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
communities such as through playing
 
04:49:23.270 --> 04:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
sports with a team they can have higher
 
04:49:24.990 --> 04:49:25.000 align:start position:0%
and better mental health outcomes and
 
04:49:27.990 --> 04:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
those that are on par with their
 
04:49:31.830 --> 04:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
peers similarly all students who
 
04:49:34.350 --> 04:49:34.360 align:start position:0%
participate in sports are able to get
 
04:49:36.430 --> 04:49:36.440 align:start position:0%
the social emotional benefits such as
 
04:49:39.430 --> 04:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
building confidence leadership teamwork
 
04:49:42.110 --> 04:49:42.120 align:start position:0%
friendships um the list goes on and on
 
04:49:45.470 --> 04:49:45.480 align:start position:0%
plus exercise increases mental health or
 
04:49:49.110 --> 04:49:49.120 align:start position:0%
uh benefits mental health as such all
 
04:49:51.390 --> 04:49:51.400 align:start position:0%

sports regardless of their gender
 
04:49:56.990 --> 04:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
identity as uh for those reasons new
 
04:49:59.350 --> 04:49:59.360 align:start position:0%

very much uh distinguished members of
 
04:50:25.788 --> 04:50:25.798 align:start position:0%
the House Education committee for
 
04:50:26.708 --> 04:50:26.718 align:start position:0%
hearing my
 
04:50:31.350 --> 04:50:31.360 align:start position:0%
testimony um I'm opposed to Senate Bill
 
04:50:34.910 --> 04:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
375 I'm an athlete um I'm a pretty good
 
04:50:38.190 --> 04:50:38.200 align:start position:0%
athlete I I wore my um New Hampshire
 
04:50:39.708 --> 04:50:39.718 align:start position:0%
three sport athlete I grew up in New
 
04:50:39.718 --> 04:50:41.190 align:start position:0%
three sport athlete I grew up in New
Hampshire

04:50:41.190 --> 04:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:50:45.230 --> 04:50:45.240 align:start position:0%
and I'm frankly insulted by this bill
 
04:50:49.868 --> 04:50:49.878 align:start position:0%
because I'm a woman athlete I've I was
 
04:50:51.390 --> 04:50:51.400 align:start position:0%
fortunate enough to be born with a
 
04:50:54.590 --> 04:50:54.600 align:start position:0%
gender that I identify with in terms of
 
04:50:56.948 --> 04:50:56.958 align:start position:0%
what the doctor said at Birth but I
 
04:50:59.150 --> 04:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
wanted to speak a little bit to safety
 
04:51:01.430 --> 04:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
and to science which are both mentioned
 
04:51:03.910 --> 04:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
here several times I'm also a science
 
04:51:06.350 --> 04:51:06.360 align:start position:0%
teacher and so I look for evidence in
 
04:51:08.548 --> 04:51:08.558 align:start position:0%
making decisions and when it comes to
 
04:51:11.750 --> 04:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
biological sex logically people are all
 
04:51:13.868 --> 04:51:13.878 align:start position:0%
different nature doesn't stick to
 
04:51:16.470 --> 04:51:16.480 align:start position:0%
categories that humans have invented
 
04:51:18.670 --> 04:51:18.680 align:start position:0%
about two in every 100 people are born
 
04:51:21.310 --> 04:51:21.320 align:start position:0%
with interex traits that means that you
 
04:51:22.948 --> 04:51:22.958 align:start position:0%
likely know somebody who was born with
 
04:51:25.070 --> 04:51:25.080 align:start position:0%
an interex trait and a doctor at Birth
 
04:51:28.670 --> 04:51:28.680 align:start position:0%
is has a has to decide like this is what
 
04:51:30.910 --> 04:51:30.920 align:start position:0%
this child will be when all they have is
 
04:51:33.628 --> 04:51:33.638 align:start position:0%
evidence of genitalia which often for
 
04:51:36.510 --> 04:51:36.520 align:start position:0%
about two and or One in every 200 people
 
04:51:39.628 --> 04:51:39.638 align:start position:0%
are not clinically identifiable um and
 
04:51:41.750 --> 04:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
have some kind of VAR
 
04:51:43.670 --> 04:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
so are we saying that like you can't
 
04:51:46.868 --> 04:51:46.878 align:start position:0%
belong or be part of a sports team if
 
04:51:49.110 --> 04:51:49.120 align:start position:0%
you don't fit into these NE categories
 
04:51:52.708 --> 04:51:52.718 align:start position:0%
that we as human beings have invented
 
04:51:55.750 --> 04:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
biologically Nature's not neat it's just
 
04:51:58.470 --> 04:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
not when it comes to safety I think the
 
04:52:01.390 --> 04:52:01.400 align:start position:0%
real safety risk is having somebody who
 
04:52:04.708 --> 04:52:04.718 align:start position:0%
would be who is a woman in a men's
 
04:52:06.708 --> 04:52:06.718 align:start position:0%
locker room if they have if they're not
 
04:52:08.990 --> 04:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
allowed to use the women's locker room
 
04:52:11.350 --> 04:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
that to me feels very unsafe especially
 
04:52:13.670 --> 04:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
for trans women who have been bullied
 
04:52:16.510 --> 04:52:16.520 align:start position:0%
primarily in my experience in school and
 
04:52:20.948 --> 04:52:20.958 align:start position:0%
Athletics by men so like forcing a woman
 
04:52:24.070 --> 04:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
to use a men's locker room because at
 
04:52:25.788 --> 04:52:25.798 align:start position:0%
Birth when the doctor was looking at
 
04:52:28.788 --> 04:52:28.798 align:start position:0%
them they made some determination feels
 
04:52:31.030 --> 04:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
really terrible and the reason I'm
 
04:52:33.750 --> 04:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
insulted as an athlete is because I want
 
04:52:35.788 --> 04:52:35.798 align:start position:0%
the chance to compete against the
 
04:52:38.750 --> 04:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
best I don't want as a woman athlete I
 
04:52:40.708 --> 04:52:40.718 align:start position:0%
don't if I'm cut from the team that's
 
04:52:42.628 --> 04:52:42.638 align:start position:0%
cuz I didn't work hard enough or because
 
04:52:44.868 --> 04:52:44.878 align:start position:0%
some other part of my life like I didn't
 
04:52:48.070 --> 04:52:48.080 align:start position:0%
make the cut and I want that challenge
 
04:52:50.948 --> 04:52:50.958 align:start position:0%
you're I want all women to participate
 
04:52:53.788 --> 04:52:53.798 align:start position:0%
um so yeah I'll take questions if thank
 
04:52:56.150 --> 04:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
you are there questions from the
 
04:52:59.590 --> 04:52:59.600 align:start position:0%

athletes that I'll just pass around um
 
04:53:05.590 --> 04:53:05.600 align:start position:0%
these are other women athletes who would
 
04:53:07.390 --> 04:53:07.400 align:start position:0%
like to the chance to participate
 
04:53:09.150 --> 04:53:09.160 align:start position:0%

I'm wearing my running shoes my time as
 
04:53:47.030 --> 04:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
an athlete is significantly contributed
 
04:53:49.548 --> 04:53:49.558 align:start position:0%
to the adult I am today as a 5-year-old
 
04:53:50.948 --> 04:53:50.958 align:start position:0%
soccer player I learned the joys of
 
04:53:52.230 --> 04:53:52.240 align:start position:0%
teamwork and the importance of
 
04:53:54.470 --> 04:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
dedication as an 18-year-old Runner I
 
04:53:56.910 --> 04:53:56.920 align:start position:0%
learned self-discipline and drive I was
 
04:53:58.110 --> 04:53:58.120 align:start position:0%
recruited and given an athletic
 
04:53:59.470 --> 04:53:59.480 align:start position:0%
scholarship to continue running at
 
04:54:01.470 --> 04:54:01.480 align:start position:0%

freshman year I sustained a career-
 
04:54:05.470 --> 04:54:05.480 align:start position:0%
ending injury while I no longer compete
 
04:54:07.190 --> 04:54:07.200 align:start position:0%

their time in
 
04:54:35.830 --> 04:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
sports as I spoke earlier today this
 
04:54:37.670 --> 04:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
past year my 17-year-old survived an
 
04:54:39.230 --> 04:54:39.240 align:start position:0%
attempted suicide due to their gender
 
04:54:41.788 --> 04:54:41.798 align:start position:0%
dysphoria and severe depression they are
 
04:54:43.390 --> 04:54:43.400 align:start position:0%
currently receiving Essential Medical
 
04:54:44.910 --> 04:54:44.920 align:start position:0%
Care to allow their body to be the more
 
04:54:46.590 --> 04:54:46.600 align:start position:0%
feminine home they feel as their own and
 
04:54:48.030 --> 04:54:48.040 align:start position:0%
while our journey supporting a trans
 
04:54:50.310 --> 04:54:50.320 align:start position:0%
teen has been very difficult at times I
 
04:54:52.750 --> 04:54:52.760 align:start position:0%
can not cannot imagine the added turmoil
 
04:54:54.670 --> 04:54:54.680 align:start position:0%
a band such as this would bring the
 
04:54:56.310 --> 04:54:56.320 align:start position:0%
isolation that trans youth Endor is
 
04:54:58.548 --> 04:54:58.558 align:start position:0%
inconceivable for most separating and
 
04:54:59.990 --> 04:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
excluding a small group of kids from
 
04:55:01.350 --> 04:55:01.360 align:start position:0%
their friends and teammates further
 
04:55:03.708 --> 04:55:03.718 align:start position:0%
exacerbates this isolation supporting
 
04:55:05.310 --> 04:55:05.320 align:start position:0%
and promoting the blatant discrimination
 
04:55:06.948 --> 04:55:06.958 align:start position:0%
of transgender athletes is not the way
 
04:55:08.990 --> 04:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
of the granite state sport should be a
 
04:55:10.510 --> 04:55:10.520 align:start position:0%
place where we Embrace diversity in
 
04:55:12.590 --> 04:55:12.600 align:start position:0%
teamm ship trans girls are girls and
 
04:55:14.030 --> 04:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
they belong playing alongside their
 
04:55:16.708 --> 04:55:16.718 align:start position:0%
fellow non-transgender female athletes
 
04:55:18.670 --> 04:55:18.680 align:start position:0%
the relationships a person experiences
 
04:55:19.910 --> 04:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
through being a part of a sport are
 
04:55:22.110 --> 04:55:22.120 align:start position:0%
life-changing though few athletes reach
 
04:55:23.750 --> 04:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
reach the highest level of competition
 
04:55:25.230 --> 04:55:25.240 align:start position:0%
lessons received through being a part of
 
04:55:27.708 --> 04:55:27.718 align:start position:0%
a sport are immeasurable to remove an
 
04:55:29.190 --> 04:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
athlete from a team that has bonded and
 
04:55:30.948 --> 04:55:30.958 align:start position:0%
created lasting relationships due to
 
04:55:32.868 --> 04:55:32.878 align:start position:0%
their biological sex negating their true
 
04:55:34.628 --> 04:55:34.638 align:start position:0%
identity as a trans youth would have a
 
04:55:36.230 --> 04:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
detrimental effect on all student
 
04:55:38.750 --> 04:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
athletes I have one more sentence to
 
04:55:40.510 --> 04:55:40.520 align:start position:0%
consider a trans girls a female during
 
04:55:41.868 --> 04:55:41.878 align:start position:0%
her school day but exclude her from
 
04:55:43.390 --> 04:55:43.400 align:start position:0%
joining a school sports team is an
 
04:55:46.070 --> 04:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
outright denial of her equal educational
 
04:55:48.470 --> 04:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
opportunities as legislators you need to
 
04:55:50.230 --> 04:55:50.240 align:start position:0%
prevent and stop the repercussions of
 
04:55:53.590 --> 04:55:53.600 align:start position:0%

Chester thank you committee chair thank
 
04:56:10.830 --> 04:56:10.840 align:start position:0%
you committee members my name is Russ
 
04:56:13.910 --> 04:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
anchester Bedford New Hampshire um many
 
04:56:17.830 --> 04:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
years ago I was very supportive of girls
 
04:56:21.350 --> 04:56:21.360 align:start position:0%
can do anything boys can do um I was
 
04:56:23.548 --> 04:56:23.558 align:start position:0%
very involved with the feminist movement
 
04:56:28.590 --> 04:56:28.600 align:start position:0%
equal rights for equal pay etc etc um I
 
04:56:32.868 --> 04:56:32.878 align:start position:0%
grew up in a small town where 4 fo8 I
 
04:56:36.310 --> 04:56:36.320 align:start position:0%
wasn't playing basketball 4 fo8 I
 
04:56:38.788 --> 04:56:38.798 align:start position:0%
probably wasn't going to run anywhere
 
04:56:43.430 --> 04:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
fast these hand F at when I was younger
 
04:56:45.430 --> 04:56:45.440 align:start position:0%
weren't going to handle a
 
04:56:50.350 --> 04:56:50.360 align:start position:0%
softball so I wanted to play football um
 
04:56:52.628 --> 04:56:52.638 align:start position:0%
fortunately we had a pop warner team and
 
04:56:54.470 --> 04:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
I was able to play football because boys
 
04:56:56.590 --> 04:56:56.600 align:start position:0%
and girls can play together there's no
 
04:56:58.990 --> 04:56:59.000 align:start position:0%
locker room issue there's no and Bullies
 
04:57:03.310 --> 04:57:03.320 align:start position:0%
of bullies um it was based on weight and
 
04:57:05.788 --> 04:57:05.798 align:start position:0%
age and all of
 
04:57:08.910 --> 04:57:08.920 align:start position:0%
that because I grew up that way when I
 
04:57:11.070 --> 04:57:11.080 align:start position:0%
went to high school here in New
 
04:57:13.788 --> 04:57:13.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I wanted to play football I
 
04:57:16.430 --> 04:57:16.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to try out for the football team
 
04:57:19.750 --> 04:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
and I was told I could not because I was
 
04:57:24.948 --> 04:57:24.958 align:start position:0%
born female I fought it I won I tried
 
04:57:28.990 --> 04:57:29.000 align:start position:0%
out I made the team well let's take that
 
04:57:32.110 --> 04:57:32.120 align:start position:0%
back I did not make the team first round
 
04:57:34.350 --> 04:57:34.360 align:start position:0%
and then I brought it up that I felt
 
04:57:36.150 --> 04:57:36.160 align:start position:0%
that I was being discriminated against
 
04:57:37.830 --> 04:57:37.840 align:start position:0%
because I was a lot better than a lot of
 
04:57:40.670 --> 04:57:40.680 align:start position:0%
the boys that made the team so they did
 
04:57:42.628 --> 04:57:42.638 align:start position:0%
a blind
 
04:57:46.150 --> 04:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
redo um and I made the
 
04:57:49.030 --> 04:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
team I played freshman
 
04:57:53.070 --> 04:57:53.080 align:start position:0%
year I was pretty good um even my coach
 
04:57:55.868 --> 04:57:55.878 align:start position:0%
had the but my coach said to me I have
 
04:57:58.390 --> 04:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
to pay for all my own equipment cuz we
 
04:58:00.750 --> 04:58:00.760 align:start position:0%
don't have that in the budget for girls
 
04:58:02.548 --> 04:58:02.558 align:start position:0%
girls equipment's different than boys
 
04:58:06.670 --> 04:58:06.680 align:start position:0%
equipment so trans girls on a football
 
04:58:08.548 --> 04:58:08.558 align:start position:0%
team would have to use different
 
04:58:12.150 --> 04:58:12.160 align:start position:0%
equipment if unless they've had
 
04:58:15.350 --> 04:58:15.360 align:start position:0%
alterations um and the bottom line is is
 
04:58:19.110 --> 04:58:19.120 align:start position:0%
that so I knew that I would have that I
 
04:58:21.670 --> 04:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
was on a team with all boys except for
 
04:58:26.548 --> 04:58:26.558 align:start position:0%
me when my coach um when my coach
 
04:58:28.430 --> 04:58:28.440 align:start position:0%
accepted that I was going to be on his
 
04:58:31.430 --> 04:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
team he called a team meeting and he
 
04:58:33.750 --> 04:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
said we only have one locker room
 
04:58:35.628 --> 04:58:35.638 align:start position:0%
available we're not opening the girls
 
04:58:41.030 --> 04:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
room just for you figure it out um and
 
04:58:45.270 --> 04:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
we worked with the guys um on my team
 
04:58:46.948 --> 04:58:46.958 align:start position:0%
and we were able to come to the
 
04:58:50.548 --> 04:58:50.558 align:start position:0%
conclusion that your time is up yes just
 
04:58:52.030 --> 04:58:52.040 align:start position:0%
very quickly we were able to come to the
 
04:58:54.548 --> 04:58:54.558 align:start position:0%
conclusion that that we could all work
 
04:58:56.948 --> 04:58:56.958 align:start position:0%
together and mutually respect one
 
04:59:02.470 --> 04:59:02.480 align:start position:0%
another um this is not an easy task but
 
04:59:05.030 --> 04:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
at the same time by sophomore year I
 
04:59:07.230 --> 04:59:07.240 align:start position:0%
realized that it was not appropriate for
 
04:59:08.750 --> 04:59:08.760 align:start position:0%
me to be playing football at a high
 
04:59:12.070 --> 04:59:12.080 align:start position:0%
school level and I took myself off the
 
04:59:18.750 --> 04:59:18.760 align:start position:0%
team um but I do understand um the folks
 
04:59:21.990 --> 04:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
here back then no one would have known
 
04:59:25.910 --> 04:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:28.510 --> 04:59:28.520 align:start position:0%
girl and that's the most important part
 
04:59:30.910 --> 04:59:30.920 align:start position:0%
of this is that we're discriminating
 
04:59:33.470 --> 04:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
based on what we're telling people we
 
04:59:36.750 --> 04:59:36.760 align:start position:0%
are your time is up yeah thank you are
 
04:59:37.830 --> 04:59:37.840 align:start position:0%
there any
 
04:59:59.910 --> 04:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:03.590 --> 05:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
testerman yeah oh there we go my name is
 
05:00:06.430 --> 05:00:06.440 align:start position:0%
Holloway testerman I'm here in
 
05:00:10.350 --> 05:00:10.360 align:start position:0%
opposition of this bill um and uh the
 
05:00:14.350 --> 05:00:14.360 align:start position:0%
sponsor that uh introduced this bill um
 
05:00:17.670 --> 05:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
seemed to be pretty concerned about um
 
05:00:19.548 --> 05:00:19.558 align:start position:0%
safety and I think I have some pretty
 
05:00:21.910 --> 05:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
similar concerns um and I guess my main
 
05:00:22.910 --> 05:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
question is how are we going to
 
05:00:26.910 --> 05:00:26.920 align:start position:0%
implement this bill because we know that
 
05:00:30.868 --> 05:00:30.878 align:start position:0%
um paperwork identification paperwork um
 
05:00:32.990 --> 05:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
the the gender marked there doesn't
 
05:00:34.990 --> 05:00:35.000 align:start position:0%
always match the sex assigned birth
 
05:00:38.430 --> 05:00:38.440 align:start position:0%
right um we heard from uh someone else
 
05:00:40.868 --> 05:00:40.878 align:start position:0%
who testified that blood test hormone
 
05:00:43.470 --> 05:00:43.480 align:start position:0%
levels aren't always going to tell us
 
05:00:46.750 --> 05:00:46.760 align:start position:0%
what um someone's sex assigned at Birth
 
05:00:50.070 --> 05:00:50.080 align:start position:0%
is um and I I think genetic testing
 
05:00:52.868 --> 05:00:52.878 align:start position:0%
raises some ethical concerns that this
 
05:00:57.548 --> 05:00:57.558 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't isn't really able to cover
 
05:01:00.390 --> 05:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
um so are we going to ask athletes about
 
05:01:03.948 --> 05:01:03.958 align:start position:0%
their periods because um not all girls
 
05:01:07.430 --> 05:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
have regular periods right um are we
 
05:01:09.190 --> 05:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
going to do physical examinations CU
 
05:01:11.030 --> 05:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
that seems really invasive and traumatic
 
05:01:12.990 --> 05:01:13.000 align:start position:0%
I mean all of these things seem super
 
05:01:17.548 --> 05:01:17.558 align:start position:0%
invasive and traumatic but um I guess my
 
05:01:22.390 --> 05:01:22.400 align:start position:0%
concern here is yes this is about uh you
 
05:01:23.910 --> 05:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
know contrary to what the sponsor who
 
05:01:26.070 --> 05:01:26.080 align:start position:0%
introduced this Bill said this is about
 
05:01:31.070 --> 05:01:31.080 align:start position:0%
um not allowing Tren kids in sports um
 
05:01:32.948 --> 05:01:32.958 align:start position:0%
but it seems to me that this bill is
 
05:01:35.990 --> 05:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
really about controlling women's bodies
 
05:01:38.150 --> 05:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
all women's bodies regardless of whether
 
05:01:42.868 --> 05:01:42.878 align:start position:0%
they are trans or cisgender because you
 
05:01:45.750 --> 05:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
cannot tell someone is trans by looking
 
05:01:48.390 --> 05:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
at them um so
 
05:01:50.910 --> 05:01:50.920 align:start position:0%
this this bill is an expedient because
 
05:01:54.070 --> 05:01:54.080 align:start position:0%
there's no way to implement it um it is
 
05:01:57.310 --> 05:01:57.320 align:start position:0%
simply there to cause discrimination and
 
05:02:00.150 --> 05:02:00.160 align:start position:0%
so fear um thank you thank you are there
 
05:02:01.670 --> 05:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
any questions from the
 
05:02:04.510 --> 05:02:04.520 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much uh Kate
 
05:02:04.520 --> 05:02:13.030 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much uh Kate
mccardy

05:02:13.030 --> 05:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:15.510 --> 05:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
hello again my name is Kate mccardy uh
 
05:02:18.910 --> 05:02:18.920 align:start position:0%
I'm here to oppose SB 375 my daughter's
 
05:02:20.910 --> 05:02:20.920 align:start position:0%
best friend plays field hockey uh this
 
05:02:22.430 --> 05:02:22.440 align:start position:0%
past season she got bulldozed by an
 
05:02:23.670 --> 05:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
opposing team member and broke her
 
05:02:25.788 --> 05:02:25.798 align:start position:0%
collar bone ending her season that
 
05:02:27.310 --> 05:02:27.320 align:start position:0%
opposing team member was a cisgender
 
05:02:29.350 --> 05:02:29.360 align:start position:0%
girl my future daughter-in-law was
 
05:02:30.910 --> 05:02:30.920 align:start position:0%
injured badly in her senior year on the
 
05:02:33.030 --> 05:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
field hockey field by another cisgender
 
05:02:35.350 --> 05:02:35.360 align:start position:0%
girl there will always be stories about
 
05:02:37.510 --> 05:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
sports injuries and almost all of them
 
05:02:38.868 --> 05:02:38.878 align:start position:0%
are incurred through contact with
 
05:02:41.590 --> 05:02:41.600 align:start position:0%
another cisgender girl I just have
 
05:02:42.830 --> 05:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
quotes from a couple of entities that
 
05:02:45.350 --> 05:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
are directly involved with the subject
 
05:02:46.990 --> 05:02:47.000 align:start position:0%
the women's sports Foundation supports
 
05:02:48.430 --> 05:02:48.440 align:start position:0%
the right of all athletes including
 
05:02:50.708 --> 05:02:50.718 align:start position:0%
transgender athletes to participate in
 
05:02:52.350 --> 05:02:52.360 align:start position:0%
athletic competition that is fair
 
05:02:54.390 --> 05:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
Equitable and respectful to all
 
05:02:56.110 --> 05:02:56.120 align:start position:0%
transgender refers to people whose
 
05:02:58.190 --> 05:02:58.200 align:start position:0%
gender identity their internal sense of
 
05:03:00.310 --> 05:03:00.320 align:start position:0%
themselves as male or female does not
 
05:03:02.270 --> 05:03:02.280 align:start position:0%
conform to traditional expectations
 
05:03:04.390 --> 05:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
associated with their assigned sex at
 
05:03:06.990 --> 05:03:07.000 align:start position:0%
Birth schools must be prepared to fairly
 
05:03:08.270 --> 05:03:08.280 align:start position:0%
accommodate these students and their
 
05:03:09.788 --> 05:03:09.798 align:start position:0%
families in athletics as well as other
 
05:03:13.470 --> 05:03:13.480 align:start position:0%
school programs the nhiaa has asserted
 
05:03:16.270 --> 05:03:16.280 align:start position:0%
since 2015 that all girls should be
 
05:03:18.070 --> 05:03:18.080 align:start position:0%
allowed to participate in girl Sports
 
05:03:20.430 --> 05:03:20.440 align:start position:0%
including transgender girls when did it
 
05:03:22.150 --> 05:03:22.160 align:start position:0%
become common practice to disregard
 
05:03:23.910 --> 05:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
expert opinions and act on emotion and
 
05:03:26.868 --> 05:03:26.878 align:start position:0%
Prejudice we need to do better and since
 
05:03:28.548 --> 05:03:28.558 align:start position:0%
I have a few more seconds I find it very
 
05:03:29.948 --> 05:03:29.958 align:start position:0%
telling that a certain person here
 
05:03:31.470 --> 05:03:31.480 align:start position:0%
didn't miss jender Parker the way she
 
05:03:33.390 --> 05:03:33.400 align:start position:0%
did in the hallway while shoving a phone
 
05:03:35.070 --> 05:03:35.080 align:start position:0%
camera in her face against her parents
 
05:03:37.948 --> 05:03:37.958 align:start position:0%
wishes thank you are there any questions
 
05:03:40.030 --> 05:03:40.040 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
05:03:46.310 --> 05:03:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:56.430 --> 05:03:56.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:58.990 --> 05:03:59.000 align:start position:0%
gs hi thank you so much for taking the
 
05:04:01.110 --> 05:04:01.120 align:start position:0%
time to hear my testimony again uh for
 
05:04:03.310 --> 05:04:03.320 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Courtney Reid I
 
05:04:06.070 --> 05:04:06.080 align:start position:0%
serve as policy Advocate at the ACLU of
 
05:04:09.310 --> 05:04:09.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh and we oppose this bill
 
05:04:11.510 --> 05:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
um you we' already heard from another
 
05:04:15.150 --> 05:04:15.160 align:start position:0%
civil rights uh attorney that um there
 
05:04:18.510 --> 05:04:18.520 align:start position:0%
are many reasons to vote down this bill
 
05:04:22.788 --> 05:04:22.798 align:start position:0%
um one being that uh in numerous cases
 
05:04:24.948 --> 05:04:24.958 align:start position:0%
uh legislation that categorically bars
 
05:04:26.948 --> 05:04:26.958 align:start position:0%
transgender people from participating in
 
05:04:29.310 --> 05:04:29.320 align:start position:0%
sports that aligns with their gender is
 
05:04:30.510 --> 05:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
not only
 
05:04:32.430 --> 05:04:32.440 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional violating equal
 
05:04:34.548 --> 05:04:34.558 align:start position:0%
protections under the law but also was
 
05:04:37.628 --> 05:04:37.638 align:start position:0%
in violation of Title 9 and that just
 
05:04:39.990 --> 05:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
last week there were several actions or
 
05:04:42.310 --> 05:04:42.320 align:start position:0%
updates to the law to strengthen Title 9
 
05:04:45.030 --> 05:04:45.040 align:start position:0%
protections for transgender individuals
 
05:04:48.470 --> 05:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
that being uh the ruling from the fourth
 
05:04:50.628 --> 05:04:50.638 align:start position:0%
circuit uh opposing a very similar bill
 
05:04:53.628 --> 05:04:53.638 align:start position:0%
on the grounds that exclusion of uh
 
05:04:55.350 --> 05:04:55.360 align:start position:0%
Sports participation is violation of
 
05:04:58.150 --> 05:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
title n uh as well as additional
 
05:05:00.110 --> 05:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
guidelines from the Department of
 
05:05:02.910 --> 05:05:02.920 align:start position:0%
Education um to elaborate that uh on
 
05:05:05.628 --> 05:05:05.638 align:start position:0%
that a little bit more there have also
 
05:05:08.750 --> 05:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
been some cases uh in state courts such
 
05:05:11.110 --> 05:05:11.120 align:start position:0%
as Arizona that have ruled uh
 
05:05:14.230 --> 05:05:14.240 align:start position:0%
categorical prohibition of participation
 
05:05:17.310 --> 05:05:17.320 align:start position:0%
for transgender students violate um
 
05:05:19.548 --> 05:05:19.558 align:start position:0%
state constitutions or in New
 
05:05:22.548 --> 05:05:22.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's instance there's also uh
 
05:05:24.350 --> 05:05:24.360 align:start position:0%
state laws that we passed with
 
05:05:27.830 --> 05:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support only a few years ago
 
05:05:29.788 --> 05:05:29.798 align:start position:0%
uh that offer protections based on
 
05:05:31.990 --> 05:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
gender identity um and that compel
 
05:05:34.948 --> 05:05:34.958 align:start position:0%
schools to create policies to prevent
 
05:05:36.628 --> 05:05:36.638 align:start position:0%
and intervene in Acts of
 
05:05:38.510 --> 05:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
discrimination we've also heard a little
 
05:05:41.548 --> 05:05:41.558 align:start position:0%
bit about how unworkable this bill would
 
05:05:44.868 --> 05:05:44.878 align:start position:0%
be is it up to coaches or teachers to
 
05:05:46.910 --> 05:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
ensure and certify that the birth
 
05:05:48.350 --> 05:05:48.360 align:start position:0%
certificates or the enforcement
 
05:05:50.830 --> 05:05:50.840 align:start position:0%
mechanism behind this bill are true and
 
05:05:53.110 --> 05:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
that they actually don't you know match
 
05:05:56.750 --> 05:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
the uh the gender of a trans student and
 
05:05:58.470 --> 05:05:58.480 align:start position:0%
what liabilities do they face if they
 
05:06:00.590 --> 05:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
make a mistake uh I think there are some
 
05:06:03.628 --> 05:06:03.638 align:start position:0%
serious privacy concerns that uh the ACL
 
05:06:06.030 --> 05:06:06.040 align:start position:0%
you would like to raise and I'm happy to
 
05:06:09.110 --> 05:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
take some questions about the benefits
 
05:06:11.150 --> 05:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
um in Public Health Data that we have
 
05:06:13.830 --> 05:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
around uh what it means to allow
 
05:06:15.510 --> 05:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
transgender students to play sports
 
05:06:17.030 --> 05:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much other questions from
 
05:06:17.040 --> 05:06:18.590 align:start position:0%
thank you very much other questions from
the

05:06:18.590 --> 05:06:18.600 align:start position:0%
the

and they belong in their public schools
 
05:13:36.990 --> 05:13:37.000 align:start position:0%
in order to do that they have to find
 
05:13:38.470 --> 05:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
the place where they belong for some
 
05:13:40.628 --> 05:13:40.638 align:start position:0%

deny that to some of our students
 
05:13:58.990 --> 05:13:59.000 align:start position:0%
because of who they are is just plain
 
05:14:00.548 --> 05:14:00.558 align:start position:0%
wrong that's not what our public schools
 
05:14:02.708 --> 05:14:02.718 align:start position:0%
are about
 
05:14:06.708 --> 05:14:06.718 align:start position:0%
um so you know the uh sponsor of this

05:14:11.788 --> 05:14:11.798 align:start position:0%
Fair and a very simple bill but when you
 
05:14:13.948 --> 05:14:13.958 align:start position:0%
consider this bill you also need to
 
05:14:16.390 --> 05:14:16.400 align:start position:0%
consider the unintended consequences
 
05:14:18.190 --> 05:14:18.200 align:start position:0%
it's not so simple as just looking at a
 
05:14:20.510 --> 05:14:20.520 align:start position:0%
birth certificate and saying you have to
 
05:14:22.150 --> 05:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
live that way for the rest of your life
 
05:14:23.628 --> 05:14:23.638 align:start position:0%
because that is not the truth for some
 
05:14:24.510 --> 05:14:24.520 align:start position:0%
of our
 
05:14:28.470 --> 05:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
students um I will tell you just a few
 
05:14:31.230 --> 05:14:31.240 align:start position:0%
quick points here a policy very similar
 
05:14:33.670 --> 05:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
to this bill was in place in Texas in
 
05:14:38.110 --> 05:14:38.120 align:start position:0%
2017 and because a student had to
 
05:14:41.230 --> 05:14:41.240 align:start position:0%
compete under the gender that was on his
 
05:14:41.240 --> 05:14:42.110 align:start position:0%
compete under the gender that was on his
birth

05:14:42.110 --> 05:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
birth
 
05:14:46.510 --> 05:14:46.520 align:start position:0%
certificate a high school male had to
 
05:14:49.990 --> 05:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
wrestle um in the girls wrestling
 
05:14:51.230 --> 05:14:51.240 align:start position:0%
championship and actually won the state
 
05:14:53.590 --> 05:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
championship in his weight class so if
 
05:14:54.788 --> 05:14:54.798 align:start position:0%
you're talking about trying to keep
 
05:14:57.030 --> 05:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
things fair and saving women's sports
 
05:14:59.788 --> 05:14:59.798 align:start position:0%
keep that in mind um you you may doing
 
05:15:02.030 --> 05:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
something you didn't intend I have two
 
05:15:04.990 --> 05:15:05.000 align:start position:0%
more quick points would violate Title
 
05:15:08.310 --> 05:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
Nine okay because we have to have equal
 
05:15:10.708 --> 05:15:10.718 align:start position:0%
opportunity for boys and for girls if
 
05:15:13.150 --> 05:15:13.160 align:start position:0%
you have a girls field hockey team and
 
05:15:14.548 --> 05:15:14.558 align:start position:0%
you're saying boys can't play on that
 
05:15:16.430 --> 05:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
team you're now violating Title 9 if
 
05:15:18.430 --> 05:15:18.440 align:start position:0%
you're saying they can't even try out if
 
05:15:22.470 --> 05:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
this bill passes and uh beyond that uh
 
05:15:23.830 --> 05:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
even discussing bands like this
 
05:15:26.430 --> 05:15:26.440 align:start position:0%
encourages bigotry and hatred there was
 
05:15:29.390 --> 05:15:29.400 align:start position:0%
an incident out in Utah this winter
 
05:15:32.670 --> 05:15:32.680 align:start position:0%
where uh a parent was insisting that a
 
05:15:36.230 --> 05:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
girl on the junior varsity team was a
 
05:15:40.868 --> 05:15:40.878 align:start position:0%
trans player and got very riled up
 
05:15:43.070 --> 05:15:43.080 align:start position:0%
despite the fact that the coach the girl
 
05:15:44.750 --> 05:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
herself and the parents were insisting
 
05:15:47.628 --> 05:15:47.638 align:start position:0%
no this is a girl playing on a girl's
 
05:15:50.390 --> 05:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
Team every time we have one of these
 
05:15:51.910 --> 05:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
bills and have to come out and have
 
05:15:54.190 --> 05:15:54.200 align:start position:0%
hearings justifying the right of
 
05:15:55.910 --> 05:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
students to be who they are and play
 
05:15:58.628 --> 05:15:58.638 align:start position:0%
sports on the team they belong on it
 
05:16:01.990 --> 05:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
encourages this kind of bigotry um so
 
05:16:03.270 --> 05:16:03.280 align:start position:0%
when you start separating students
 
05:16:04.670 --> 05:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
segregating them based on certain
 
05:16:06.270 --> 05:16:06.280 align:start position:0%
characteristics and saying they cannot
 
05:16:08.750 --> 05:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
participate in activities in our schools
 
05:16:10.628 --> 05:16:10.638 align:start position:0%
and and on our sports
 
05:16:14.190 --> 05:16:14.200 align:start position:0%
teams what we're doing is encouraging
 
05:16:16.150 --> 05:16:16.160 align:start position:0%
discrimination we should not be going
 
05:16:18.190 --> 05:16:18.200 align:start position:0%
back to any form of separate but not
 
05:16:20.948 --> 05:16:20.958 align:start position:0%
equal so we oppose this bill and we urge
 
05:16:23.350 --> 05:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
you to find an exp to legislate and I'll
 
05:16:25.350 --> 05:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
be IM meing my testimony thank you thank
 
05:16:27.070 --> 05:16:27.080 align:start position:0%
you very much are there questions from
 
05:16:30.350 --> 05:16:30.360 align:start position:0%
the committee not see any thank you very
 
05:16:32.708 --> 05:16:32.718 align:start position:0%
much and with that I have no further
 
05:16:34.910 --> 05:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
pink cards on it so I'm going to close
 
05:17:02.350 --> 05:17:02.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:02.360 --> 05:18:07.750 align:start position:0%
 
about

05:18:07.750 --> 05:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:56.990 --> 05:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:58.788 --> 05:18:58.798 align:start position:0%
for all those in the room we are going
 
05:19:01.590 --> 05:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
into caucus right now we will be coming
 
05:19:03.830 --> 05:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
back following caucus to look at the
 
05:19:03.840 --> 05:19:04.708 align:start position:0%
back following caucus to look at the
seven

05:19:04.708 --> 05:19:04.718 align:start position:0%
seven
 
05:19:08.788 --> 05:19:08.798 align:start position:0%
bills um and and exact those bills later
 
05:19:11.070 --> 05:19:11.080 align:start position:0%
on today we may or may not exect them
 
05:19:13.390 --> 05:19:13.400 align:start position:0%
all but we do have at least two bills
 
05:19:15.110 --> 05:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
here which are early bills which have to
 
05:19:17.830 --> 05:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
be out of this committee by midweek
 
05:19:21.628 --> 05:19:21.638 align:start position:0%

05:19:24.190 --> 05:19:24.200 align:start position:0%
second committee so any Bill going to
 
05:19:25.430 --> 05:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
Second committee has to be out of here
 
05:19:25.440 --> 05:19:26.230 align:start position:0%

we like speak to your motion please yes
 
06:51:36.590 --> 06:51:36.600 align:start position:0%
I'll be brief Mr chair um so we're we're
 
06:51:37.910 --> 06:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
going to look at interim study on this
 
06:51:41.590 --> 06:51:41.600 align:start position:0%
bill um because there is some legitimate
 
06:51:43.910 --> 06:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
question as to whether there might be
 
06:51:45.670 --> 06:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
some children who were not adequately
 
06:51:47.750 --> 06:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
able to receive services that that they
 
06:51:50.830 --> 06:51:50.840 align:start position:0%
should be receiving um right now in
 
06:51:53.670 --> 06:51:53.680 align:start position:0%
terms of Early Childhood care but the
 
06:51:53.680 --> 06:51:54.750 align:start position:0%
terms of Early Childhood care but the
bill

06:51:54.750 --> 06:51:54.760 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:51:59.030 --> 06:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
itself um is very broad somewhat
 
06:52:01.750 --> 06:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
nebulous uh and needs to be considerably
 
06:52:03.750 --> 06:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
more narrowly tailored to address this
 
06:52:05.628 --> 06:52:05.638 align:start position:0%
real concern if it is in fact a real
 
06:52:07.190 --> 06:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
problem and that that itself needs a
 
06:52:09.230 --> 06:52:09.240 align:start position:0%
little bit of Investigation as well and
 
06:52:12.468 --> 06:52:12.478 align:start position:0%
because this is a uh a fiscal Bill we
 
06:52:15.468 --> 06:52:15.478 align:start position:0%
need to act on it uh early which means
 
06:52:16.670 --> 06:52:16.680 align:start position:0%
the best we can do right now with it
 
06:52:18.468 --> 06:52:18.478 align:start position:0%
inter study let's try to fix it and
 
06:52:21.628 --> 06:52:21.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:24.830 --> 06:52:24.840 align:start position:0%

06:52:27.708 --> 06:52:27.718 align:start position:0%
representative made a second any
 
06:52:29.708 --> 06:52:29.718 align:start position:0%
discussion or yes I would just say in
 
06:52:30.750 --> 06:52:30.760 align:start position:0%
addition there was there was
 
06:52:32.910 --> 06:52:32.920 align:start position:0%
considerable uh conversation in the
 
06:52:36.350 --> 06:52:36.360 align:start position:0%
caucus around uh the question of there
 
06:52:40.110 --> 06:52:40.120 align:start position:0%
not needing to be a uh a medical
 
06:52:42.030 --> 06:52:42.040 align:start position:0%
diagnosis and we'd really like to drill
 
06:52:43.788 --> 06:52:43.798 align:start position:0%
down on that a little bit and get some
 
06:52:45.868 --> 06:52:45.878 align:start position:0%
greater specificity how uh
 
06:52:47.788 --> 06:52:47.798 align:start position:0%
determinations are going to be made and
 
06:52:50.030 --> 06:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
and by who and on what basis thank you
 
06:52:52.990 --> 06:52:53.000 align:start position:0%

Damon thank you so uh we will be
 
06:53:00.750 --> 06:53:00.760 align:start position:0%
opposing the interm study recommendation
 
06:53:03.190 --> 06:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
we think that the the Child Care
 
06:53:06.430 --> 06:53:06.440 align:start position:0%
community and the organizations who
 
06:53:08.070 --> 06:53:08.080 align:start position:0%
testified on this bill have already done
 
06:53:10.830 --> 06:53:10.840 align:start position:0%
the work that needs to be done early
 
06:53:13.468 --> 06:53:13.478 align:start position:0%
quality child care benefits families and
 
06:53:16.070 --> 06:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
children we should be going forward with
 
06:53:18.708 --> 06:53:18.718 align:start position:0%
this and I won't spend time saying more
 
06:53:20.670 --> 06:53:20.680 align:start position:0%

requiring mandatory reporting by school

districts of school expenses yes I would
 
06:56:09.030 --> 06:56:09.040 align:start position:0%
um a number of the things in here might
 
06:56:11.150 --> 06:56:11.160 align:start position:0%
already be in
 
06:56:14.510 --> 06:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
places um potentially even most if not
 
06:56:16.910 --> 06:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
all of them but they are not easy to
 
06:56:20.948 --> 06:56:20.958 align:start position:0%
find and the public who votes for these
 
06:56:23.270 --> 06:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
things needs to actually know what's
 
06:56:26.270 --> 06:56:26.280 align:start position:0%
going on and so this is part of
 
06:56:29.388 --> 06:56:29.398 align:start position:0%
transparency for the voters to be able
 
06:56:31.868 --> 06:56:31.878 align:start position:0%
to have it in one place where they can
 
06:56:34.910 --> 06:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
find it or three places but in a place
 
06:56:37.070 --> 06:56:37.080 align:start position:0%
where it's easy for them to find instead
 
06:56:38.708 --> 06:56:38.718 align:start position:0%
of having to look through all these
 
06:56:40.510 --> 06:56:40.520 align:start position:0%
different things which they don't even
 
06:56:43.708 --> 06:56:43.718 align:start position:0%
know where they are to try to find and I
 
06:56:45.708 --> 06:56:45.718 align:start position:0%
know some of these I tried to find for a
 
06:56:48.388 --> 06:56:48.398 align:start position:0%
constituent one time and I couldn't find
 
06:56:50.468 --> 06:56:50.478 align:start position:0%
all of them because there was a
 
06:56:52.788 --> 06:56:52.798 align:start position:0%
three-letter code that I didn't know
 
06:56:55.590 --> 06:56:55.600 align:start position:0%
what it was at the time and
 
06:56:58.388 --> 06:56:58.398 align:start position:0%
so I think voters should be able to have
 
06:57:00.030 --> 06:57:00.040 align:start position:0%
easy access to this
 
06:57:02.230 --> 06:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
