00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 align:start position:0%
morning everybody Welcome
 
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 align:start position:0%
to the education oversight
 
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 align:start position:0%
committee and today of course we're
 
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 align:start position:0%
looking at what a wonderful way to start
 
00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 align:start position:0%
with the administrative rules 30 6 and
 
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 align:start position:0%
it's been an
 
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
ongoing an ongoing parade
 
00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
of having meetings and trying to address
 
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
this uh this issue so what I'd like to
 
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 align:start position:0%
do today because we've asked that we
 
00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 align:start position:0%
have the commissioner president to go
 
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
through the
 
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 align:start position:0%
backside and I'd like to start off first
 
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 align:start position:0%
with the backside and and then what
 
00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to do because we also have
 
00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 align:start position:0%
members coming in and sitting from jel
 
00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 align:start position:0%
car just observing today because they
 
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 align:start position:0%
just finished their earlier meeting
 
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 align:start position:0%
today and they're also involved with
 
00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 align:start position:0%
these Ed 306 rules so with that um and
 
00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 align:start position:0%
then what we're going I'm plan on doing
 
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 align:start position:0%
is that we will after we hear the
 
00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
backside then we'll come around if
 
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 align:start position:0%
there's some references back to the
 
00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 align:start position:0%
front side we'll deal with that and um
 
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 align:start position:0%
then following that we this committee's
 
00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:27.879 align:start position:0%
tasked with making some uh
 
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 align:start position:0%
recommendations and if we look at at the
 
00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 align:start position:0%
language which is
 
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 align:start position:0%
in the uh current responsibilities for
 
00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:41.439 align:start position:0%
this committee and these have
 
00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
changed with the addition of
 
00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 align:start position:0%
legislation uh which was 1163 this this
 
00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:50.879 align:start position:0%
year which went into effect September
 
00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
1 uh
 
00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
2024 and it reads review and make
 
00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 align:start position:0%
recommendations relating to academic
 
00:03:58.429 --> 00:03:58.439 align:start position:0%
standards under consideration by the
 
00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education Pro to RSA 193
 
00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:06.159 align:start position:0%
e2a Roman 4C that's in law right now and
 
00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 align:start position:0%
then what was added is and the minimum
 
00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 align:start position:0%
standards Public School approval under
 
00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 align:start position:0%
consideration by the State Board of
 
00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 align:start position:0%
Education pursuant to RSA 193 e2a Roman
 
00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 align:start position:0%
4A so that went into effect um it was
 
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 align:start position:0%
approved July 3 2024 and went in effect
 
00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199 align:start position:0%
on September of this this last month so
 
00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 align:start position:0%
with that I I'd like to go ahead and
 
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 align:start position:0%
invite the department to take us through
 
00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.830 align:start position:0%
invite the department to take us through
this

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 align:start position:0%
process and what we'll try to do is that
 
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
commission chair I I don't know what
 
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 align:start position:0%
that's doing it's the first time I've
 
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
seen that
 
00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:52.039 align:start position:0%
chair they probably got rid of it from
 
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 align:start position:0%
another room and said we'll park it in
 
00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 align:start position:0%
here um if if there's there's questions
 
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 align:start position:0%
from the committee here uh out we we
 
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 align:start position:0%
could stop and discuss something as
 
00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:04.039 align:start position:0%
you're moving rather than waiting till
 
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 align:start position:0%
the end okay of your presentation so
 
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
well and we also and we also have I
 
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 align:start position:0%
asked uh Jennifer for several weeks ago
 
00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:16.639 align:start position:0%
if she would to contact the department
 
00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639 align:start position:0%
which she did to find out which set of
 
00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh which version is the version we're
 
00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:27.479 align:start position:0%
dealing with and I believe we have that
 
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 align:start position:0%
um and what we did is we put a side by
 
00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
side together for both the front and the
 
00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 align:start position:0%
back and on the left hand side you'll
 
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 align:start position:0%
see what we have in education rules
 
00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:41.039 align:start position:0%
right now that are currently in place
 
00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:44.479 align:start position:0%
not what we did you know as far as
 
00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:48.039 align:start position:0%
previous uh uh changes but going right
 
00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:51.639 align:start position:0%
back to when they were approved back on
 
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 align:start position:0%
what was
 
00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
it back in
 
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 align:start position:0%
2015 or so 17 wherever else but we have
 
00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
that available so we'll we'll take the
 
00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
side by side and look at the
 
00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:09.479 align:start position:0%
backside and and uh as you go through
 
00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560 align:start position:0%
this uh commissioner
 
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
edbl then we can have our discussion
 
00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.000 align:start position:0%
that sounds great and so uh thank you
 
00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:18.599 align:start position:0%
for the record Frank adbl Commissioner
 
00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:20.840 align:start position:0%
of Education uh Julie Shay
 
00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:22.360 align:start position:0%
administrative rules coordinator for the
 
00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Education thank you great
 
00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:26.199 align:start position:0%
so let me just give you a little bit of
 
00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:28.599 align:start position:0%
context on the backside um because we've
 
00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
tried to do a great deal of research and
 
00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
figure out how what the evolution of
 
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
these were where they came from how they
 
00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
came about how they fit into our overall
 
00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:43.360 align:start position:0%
system of um how we establish what it is
 
00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:44.800 align:start position:0%
that our children in the state of New
 
00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will be
 
00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:50.199 align:start position:0%
learning um and essentially much of the
 
00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
content that we saw in the backside um
 
00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
from our research comes from really
 
00:06:59.909 --> 00:06:59.919 align:start position:0%
pre-2000 and just to give the committee
 
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
a little bit of history about the
 
00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:04.360 align:start position:0%
evolution of uh what was going on
 
00:07:07.749 --> 00:07:07.759 align:start position:0%
broadly in education pre-2000 in 2001 we
 
00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:10.199 align:start position:0%
got something refer to as the No Child
 
00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:13.240 align:start position:0%
Left Behind Act at that time when that
 
00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:16.479 align:start position:0%
was implemented nationally um there was
 
00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
concern that some states not
 
00:07:22.589 --> 00:07:22.599 align:start position:0%
specifically New Hampshire um were not
 
00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:25.240 align:start position:0%
providing uh accurate information to
 
00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
their families about how their children
 
00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:29.400 align:start position:0%
were doing and what they were learning
 
00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:33.080 align:start position:0%
um um and we not uh establishing
 
00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
rigorous systems with high academic
 
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
standards for the children in their
 
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
learning um and so at the time there
 
00:07:42.469 --> 00:07:42.479 align:start position:0%
were some stories of southern states
 
00:07:45.189 --> 00:07:45.199 align:start position:0%
that uh you know there was a belief that
 
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
the rigor of the education was not what
 
00:07:51.309 --> 00:07:51.319 align:start position:0%
it should be for those children and that
 
00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:54.360 align:start position:0%
they were being disadvantaged so part of
 
00:07:58.589 --> 00:07:58.599 align:start position:0%
the uh impulse of uh nclb or No Child
 
00:08:00.149 --> 00:08:00.159 align:start position:0%
Left Behind
 
00:08:04.749 --> 00:08:04.759 align:start position:0%
was a emphasis and a requirement for uh
 
00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
states to implement high quality
 
00:08:11.629 --> 00:08:11.639 align:start position:0%
academic standards for students so
 
00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:14.560 align:start position:0%
leading up to that you did not have that
 
00:08:17.469 --> 00:08:17.479 align:start position:0%
framework of you know a a framework of
 
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:19.360 align:start position:0%
high quality necessarily academic
 
00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:20.680 align:start position:0%
standards that the kids were supposed to
 
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
be learning you had a variety of
 
00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:25.720 align:start position:0%
different state level um you know
 
00:08:28.749 --> 00:08:28.759 align:start position:0%
Frameworks that were being used much of
 
00:08:30.029 --> 00:08:30.039 align:start position:0%
the content
 
00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:32.919 align:start position:0%
in these content areas in the back half
 
00:08:36.029 --> 00:08:36.039 align:start position:0%
again date from that pre-2000 type of a
 
00:08:40.149 --> 00:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
of a um of a era uh where we had
 
00:08:42.509 --> 00:08:42.519 align:start position:0%
enumerated in these back halfs our
 
00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
content expectations is one way of
 
00:08:46.389 --> 00:08:46.399 align:start position:0%
describing it relative to the various
 
00:08:51.269 --> 00:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
areas um subsequent to that period um
 
00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
the department and the state went
 
00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
through a variety of uh you know very uh
 
00:08:59.430 --> 00:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
comprehensive very rigorous process
 
00:09:02.509 --> 00:09:02.519 align:start position:0%
cesses to develop academic standards um
 
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:05.320 align:start position:0%
and to adopt those academic standards uh
 
00:09:07.389 --> 00:09:07.399 align:start position:0%
the State Board of Education starting
 
00:09:11.069 --> 00:09:11.079 align:start position:0%
back in 2001 um adopted academic
 
00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
standards and so the model that we
 
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:16.360 align:start position:0%
basically have in New Hampshire and
 
00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:18.920 align:start position:0%
really consistent with other folks is or
 
00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:21.800 align:start position:0%
other states is um you know through the
 
00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
306s we're establishing the minimum
 
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:25.360 align:start position:0%
standards for
 
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:28.240 align:start position:0%
education and then in that is really
 
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
dealing with and we've done dealt with
 
00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
this in the front half how do we operate
 
00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
a school is the way that I like to
 
00:09:36.509 --> 00:09:36.519 align:start position:0%
describe it and then in those same rules
 
00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:38.600 align:start position:0%
we're trying to connect those up to
 
00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
these high quality academic standards
 
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
that we have um and so essentially what
 
00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:47.800 align:start position:0%
we've sort of seen is as we as a state
 
00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:49.480 align:start position:0%
as we adopted these high quality
 
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:52.360 align:start position:0%
academic standards we didn't
 
00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:55.000 align:start position:0%
subsequently then remove the content
 
00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
areas in the back um they've for the
 
00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
most part state fairly static there's
 
00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
been a few tweaks here and there um but
 
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
for the most part that content stayed
 
00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
static so in some respects it's almost
 
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
duplicative right because on the one
 
00:10:11.829 --> 00:10:11.839 align:start position:0%
hand you have um you know adopted
 
00:10:13.509 --> 00:10:13.519 align:start position:0%
highquality academic standards and on
 
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
the other hand you kept in place some of
 
00:10:19.829 --> 00:10:19.839 align:start position:0%
the very content that uh you know was
 
00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:22.120 align:start position:0%
which predated the highquality academic
 
00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
standards um and so uh as part of our
 
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
process for kind of review doing this
 
00:10:33.829 --> 00:10:33.839 align:start position:0%
back half um going back uh even all the
 
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
way back to um you know January of last
 
00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:39.560 align:start position:0%
year um and this is a lot of the work
 
00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
that was done uh by Christine Downing
 
00:10:44.629 --> 00:10:44.639 align:start position:0%
with Educators uh she pulled together
 
00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
hundreds of Educators in across content
 
00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
areas and she went through the back half
 
00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
and what the task was what she was uh
 
00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:57.720 align:start position:0%
working towards um by agreement um and
 
00:10:59.910 --> 00:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
I'll read this to you because this is uh
 
00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
you know what was worked out is to take
 
00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:03.839 align:start position:0%
those back half and put them into
 
00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
buckets right like let's figure out
 
00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
what's back there and it might be number
 
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
one that the rule language be
 
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
incorporated into another or new section
 
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:30.949 --> 00:11:30.959 align:start position:0%
ed360 uh the proposed language for
 
00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:33.560 align:start position:0%
incorporation the second bucket or
 
00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
category was that rule language be
 
00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:38.720 align:start position:0%
carried forward for consideration as a
 
00:11:41.509 --> 00:11:41.519 align:start position:0%
modification to existing State academic
 
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
standards and content Frameworks so they
 
00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
might be looking at the back half and
 
00:11:47.389 --> 00:11:47.399 align:start position:0%
they say like oh you know what this
 
00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
Legacy content information that we had
 
00:11:51.629 --> 00:11:51.639 align:start position:0%
from pre-2000 this is still an important
 
00:11:53.949 --> 00:11:53.959 align:start position:0%
thing we don't believe it's adequately
 
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:56.240 align:start position:0%
incorporated into our academic standards
 
00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
and so we we think we should have like
 
00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
this list of hey here's academic we
 
00:12:01.829 --> 00:12:01.839 align:start position:0%
should modify our academic standard to
 
00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:03.880 align:start position:0%
include these important learning
 
00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
objectives for students the third
 
00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:08.920 align:start position:0%
category was that rule language proposed
 
00:12:11.509 --> 00:12:11.519 align:start position:0%
for Content areas not addressed by the
 
00:12:13.389 --> 00:12:13.399 align:start position:0%
current academic standards and framework
 
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:16.160 align:start position:0%
so we had certain uh content areas in
 
00:12:19.069 --> 00:12:19.079 align:start position:0%
the back half that did not have and I'll
 
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
enumerate those for you in a minute that
 
00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:22.760 align:start position:0%
did not have state adopted academic
 
00:12:25.389 --> 00:12:25.399 align:start position:0%
standards so in those cases they were
 
00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
for such content areas uh their task and
 
00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:29.480 align:start position:0%
the thing they were focused on was make
 
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
recommended condensed and concise
 
00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:34.040 align:start position:0%
language to serve as instructional best
 
00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
practices uh to be incorporated into the
 
00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:39.519 align:start position:0%
3D Ed 306 rule proposal right so if I've
 
00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:41.720 align:start position:0%
got an area in the back half that I
 
00:12:43.189 --> 00:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
don't have an academic standard for we
 
00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:44.600 align:start position:0%
still want to establish some type of
 
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:46.360 align:start position:0%
learning expectations relative to the
 
00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:48.440 align:start position:0%
kids and so what would those look like
 
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:50.240 align:start position:0%
it could be the existing language or
 
00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:51.800 align:start position:0%
maybe they wanted to make modifications
 
00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:54.240 align:start position:0%
to it and then the final category is
 
00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:56.360 align:start position:0%
like this is really just not necessary
 
00:12:58.189 --> 00:12:58.199 align:start position:0%
to or it's in it's not the right place
 
00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
for it to be in the Ed 306 draft so
 
00:13:03.389 --> 00:13:03.399 align:start position:0%
those were the bucketed areas that um we
 
00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
had asked them to uh to focus on um and
 
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
then the next thing that I want to focus
 
00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
on with you and I've brought this giant
 
00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
stack of paper um which really is our
 
00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
academic standards our curriculum
 
00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:21.320 align:start position:0%
framework right so we've got our Arts
 
00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
education framework and quite I don't
 
00:13:24.949 --> 00:13:24.959 align:start position:0%
know if any of you have taken a look at
 
00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
these but our Frameworks are actually
 
00:13:30.629 --> 00:13:30.639 align:start position:0%
quite good um they were worked on by you
 
00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
know broad groups of Educators who
 
00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:35.320 align:start position:0%
developed these kinds of things um and
 
00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
and pulled them together uh and and
 
00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
quite frankly I I'm pretty when I dug
 
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
into them and continue to read them in
 
00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:45.680 align:start position:0%
in quite a lot of detail uh PR proud of
 
00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
the work that the Educators did when
 
00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
they pulled these things together
 
00:13:50.269 --> 00:13:50.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that we can't refresh them
 
00:13:52.069 --> 00:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that we can continue to
 
00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
work on them and move them forward but
 
00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
they are not uh you know just like Fly
 
00:13:58.629 --> 00:13:58.639 align:start position:0%
by Night kinds of standards this was in
 
00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:01.160 align:start position:0%
response to No Child Left Behind and I
 
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
think a lot of work was done in terms of
 
00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:05.000 align:start position:0%
bringing this stuff forward um and what
 
00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
I can tell you is that when they did the
 
00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:11.519 align:start position:0%
academic standards they it was clear
 
00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
that they were relying on the back half
 
00:14:16.949 --> 00:14:16.959 align:start position:0%
that old the pre-2000 Legacy information
 
00:14:20.629 --> 00:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
in the uh Ed 306s when they develop the
 
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:24.040 align:start position:0%
standards and sometimes what you find is
 
00:14:26.629 --> 00:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
um you know they just copied straight
 
00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:29.320 align:start position:0%
word for word almost sometimes it's
 
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
different right like so the Ed 306 rule
 
00:14:33.269 --> 00:14:33.279 align:start position:0%
says one thing and the academic
 
00:14:35.069 --> 00:14:35.079 align:start position:0%
standards that were adopted say another
 
00:14:37.389 --> 00:14:37.399 align:start position:0%
thing um and so just there's an
 
00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:38.920 align:start position:0%
importance of trying to make sure that
 
00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:41.320 align:start position:0%
we are driving towards what we want and
 
00:14:43.269 --> 00:14:43.279 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll give you some examples of
 
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
those just so that you have um an
 
00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
interest or or you have an understanding
 
00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:50.240 align:start position:0%
of it so for example if I'm I'm in the
 
00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh the you know my art standards here
 
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:54.240 align:start position:0%
right and it goes through and it has you
 
00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:56.120 align:start position:0%
know specific standards for dance K
 
00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:57.560 align:start position:0%
through 12 curriculum Standard 1
 
00:14:59.389 --> 00:14:59.399 align:start position:0%
curriculum standard 2 through 8 you know
 
00:15:01.509 --> 00:15:01.519 align:start position:0%
music standards curriculum standards 1
 
00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:03.880 align:start position:0%
through 10 theater standards curriculum
 
00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:05.720 align:start position:0%
standards 1 through nine Visual Arts
 
00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:07.000 align:start position:0%
standards curriculum standards one
 
00:15:10.189 --> 00:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
through seven um and then there's in
 
00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:11.800 align:start position:0%
each of these standards we actually also
 
00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
have kind of an introduction it tells of
 
00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:15.320 align:start position:0%
what is our learning objectives how do
 
00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
you know contextualizes these academic
 
00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:19.480 align:start position:0%
standards like what is the role of Arts
 
00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:22.240 align:start position:0%
education in uh in our schools you know
 
00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
how do quality Arts programs contribute
 
00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
to the school environment how do the
 
00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
Arts development workplace and you know
 
00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:30.920 align:start position:0%
devel lifelong skills how do we
 
00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:32.440 align:start position:0%
integrate the Arts into our other
 
00:15:34.389 --> 00:15:34.399 align:start position:0%
instruction what is the purpose of the
 
00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:36.680 align:start position:0%
K12 curriculum framework and for the
 
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
Arts um and so they give it some good
 
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
content before they even get to the
 
00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
standards but I'll give you just an
 
00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:45.880 align:start position:0%
example of kind of a conflict that sort
 
00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
of comes about is if I look at my old
 
00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:53.240 align:start position:0%
back half Arts education Ed 306 rule
 
00:15:59.069 --> 00:15:59.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
under a you know it's like 31 a systemic
 
00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:05.519 align:start position:0%
and sequential instruction in the Arts
 
00:16:07.949 --> 00:16:07.959 align:start position:0%
disciplines of music and visual arts
 
00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
while developing opportunities for dance
 
00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:13.160 align:start position:0%
and theater where students will you know
 
00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
create perform and respond but if I look
 
00:16:18.309 --> 00:16:18.319 align:start position:0%
at my academic standards they don't say
 
00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:21.800 align:start position:0%
that and they don't say it precisely um
 
00:16:23.749 --> 00:16:23.759 align:start position:0%
they basically say that proficiency
 
00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
standards specify the levels of
 
00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:27.160 align:start position:0%
achievement that students are expected
 
00:16:30.069 --> 00:16:30.079 align:start position:0%
to attain at the completion of grades 4
 
00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:32.120 align:start position:0%
8 and 12 right so we haven't done it at
 
00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
each done we did it in bands is how they
 
00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:35.480 align:start position:0%
designed these art standards which I
 
00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
think is a good idea you know and it
 
00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:39.240 align:start position:0%
says all students should experience the
 
00:16:42.749 --> 00:16:42.759 align:start position:0%
four Arts disciplines in K8 they should
 
00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to acquire
 
00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:45.880 align:start position:0%
Knowledge and Skills identified in the
 
00:16:48.269 --> 00:16:48.279 align:start position:0%
KA proficiency standards and then it
 
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
says typically students in grades 9
 
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
through 12 elect to focus on one of the
 
00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
Arts disciplines so right there you can
 
00:16:57.189 --> 00:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
see a conflict between what was in the
 
00:16:59.590 --> 00:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
old or the Legacy Arts stand standards
 
00:17:01.269 --> 00:17:01.279 align:start position:0%
and when that information was brought
 
00:17:03.269 --> 00:17:03.279 align:start position:0%
forward and the team that worked on the
 
00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:07.400 align:start position:0%
Arts education standards they said okay
 
00:17:09.909 --> 00:17:09.919 align:start position:0%
uh you know we are going to you know
 
00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
Focus uh you know on in K8 about across
 
00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:15.160 align:start position:0%
all of these various Arts disciplines
 
00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:16.839 align:start position:0%
but then when we get to high school it's
 
00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:19.360 align:start position:0%
okay if the students you know Target and
 
00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:21.400 align:start position:0%
focus but that's inconsistent
 
00:17:24.189 --> 00:17:24.199 align:start position:0%
necessarily with what was in the 8306
 
00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:28.120 align:start position:0%
rule I mean another example of it is uh
 
00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
you know we talk about in Ed 306 rule
 
00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
the first line talks about creating
 
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
performing and responding with
 
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
understanding and what's interesting
 
00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:38.720 align:start position:0%
when I go to my academic standards it
 
00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:41.960 align:start position:0%
uses those same three ideas but it puts
 
00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:43.480 align:start position:0%
a little context around them and it
 
00:17:46.029 --> 00:17:46.039 align:start position:0%
talks about creating original works of
 
00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
art performing new or existing works of
 
00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
arts and responding to the artworks and
 
00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:53.720 align:start position:0%
performance uh performances of self and
 
00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:55.720 align:start position:0%
others so it gives you a little bit more
 
00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
context about how the Educators might
 
00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:00.520 align:start position:0%
use that um and I could take you through
 
00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:01.880 align:start position:0%
and if you're interested I can take you
 
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
other standards as well but it's this
 
00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:06.280 align:start position:0%
just imagine it's the same kind of you
 
00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:08.200 align:start position:0%
know sometimes they align sometimes they
 
00:18:09.909 --> 00:18:09.919 align:start position:0%
don't align sometimes one some one's
 
00:18:12.669 --> 00:18:12.679 align:start position:0%
more specific um but what I want to make
 
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
sure is that we know that for our
 
00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:19.240 align:start position:0%
students in their art education we want
 
00:18:22.789 --> 00:18:22.799 align:start position:0%
the Educators focused on the academic
 
00:18:24.669 --> 00:18:24.679 align:start position:0%
standards for Arts education right like
 
00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
this is what we want our kids to know
 
00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:29.320 align:start position:0%
we've defined it very clearly um you
 
00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:31.480 align:start position:0%
know in terms of what it is that that
 
00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:34.520 align:start position:0%
students should be able to attain um and
 
00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
what we don't want and I think would be
 
00:18:39.149 --> 00:18:39.159 align:start position:0%
a mistake is if we confuse our education
 
00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:43.240 align:start position:0%
system in the uh ed360 is and we
 
00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:45.480 align:start position:0%
basically put some what I will refer to
 
00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
as kind of pseudo standards in the back
 
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
half of the 306 and but then we also
 
00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:52.720 align:start position:0%
offer this what we don't want is we
 
00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:54.600 align:start position:0%
don't want Educators going to the 306s
 
00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
and thinking if they've met this 30 Ed
 
00:18:59.830 --> 00:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
306 requirement that they are not that
 
00:19:01.789 --> 00:19:01.799 align:start position:0%
they've somehow met their obligation
 
00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
because it it is not as rigorous not as
 
00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
comprehensive not as descriptive as the
 
00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:10.240 align:start position:0%
actual standards themselves so with that
 
00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:12.720 align:start position:0%
in mind this is this kind of outlines
 
00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:17.200 align:start position:0%
our approach for how we uh took on the
 
00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
back half and I will start with Arts
 
00:19:21.149 --> 00:19:21.159 align:start position:0%
education but then I'm going to just
 
00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:23.240 align:start position:0%
lean in on a couple of more things while
 
00:19:25.789 --> 00:19:25.799 align:start position:0%
we while we're talking Arts um when I
 
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
looked at the front side yep there was a
 
00:19:32.669 --> 00:19:32.679 align:start position:0%
section which dealt with uh let see at
 
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
30621 that's the kindergarten through
 
00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
grade 8 school curriculum M then when I
 
00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
weigh down through that I come to a
 
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
section which is dealing with Arts
 
00:19:45.909 --> 00:19:45.919 align:start position:0%
education including music and visual
 
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
arts where we had in the old 306s while
 
00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:53.000 align:start position:0%
developing opportunities in dance and
 
00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:56.120 align:start position:0%
theater so you have the dance and
 
00:20:00.789 --> 00:20:00.799 align:start position:0%
theater out and I believe that folks
 
00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
have used the backside as a place to
 
00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
search for academic standards seeing
 
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
that we had curriculum Frameworks we got
 
00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
rid of them for a while we introduced
 
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
them back this year and said those
 
00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
curriculum Frameworks are aligned with
 
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
academic standards and and based upon
 
00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
those academic standards so you can what
 
00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
I I said I I think people have been
 
00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:28.240 align:start position:0%
confused well this is what we're trying
 
00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:30.200 align:start position:0%
to tangle that that's what I'm concerned
 
00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
about and let me I'm going to continue
 
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
to explain that and let me tell you how
 
00:20:35.149 --> 00:20:35.159 align:start position:0%
I think we've broken through that
 
00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
confusion um if I may so like so hold
 
00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
hold that thought for one second um
 
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
representative so if I go over to the
 
00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:46.720 align:start position:0%
final proposal right so if I take ed30
 
00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:50.320 align:start position:0%
6.27 in the um the final proposal right
 
00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:52.840 align:start position:0%
if you look under Arts education you
 
00:20:55.549 --> 00:20:55.559 align:start position:0%
know under a it basically says the local
 
00:20:57.029 --> 00:20:57.039 align:start position:0%
school board shall ensure a
 
00:20:58.630 --> 00:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
developmentally appropriate Arts
 
00:21:01.029 --> 00:21:01.039 align:start position:0%
education program for each School
 
00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
consistent with local competencies and
 
00:21:06.789 --> 00:21:06.799 align:start position:0%
curriculum pursuant to Ed 30621 to 22
 
00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:08.840 align:start position:0%
okay so there's your reference to the
 
00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
front half where we've enumerated we've
 
00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:13.240 align:start position:0%
said you have to have an Arts education
 
00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
program and then B each school's Arts
 
00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:18.360 align:start position:0%
education program shall have competence
 
00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:20.600 align:start position:0%
in curriculum aligned to the K12
 
00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:23.320 align:start position:0%
curriculum framework Arts that's what
 
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
this academic standards is that was the
 
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
the exact title off of it dated April 21
 
00:21:31.549 --> 00:21:31.559 align:start position:0%
as referenced in appendix 2 so we are
 
00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
incorporating these by reference saying
 
00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
you have to offer an arts program as
 
00:21:38.149 --> 00:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
we've enumerated in the front half and
 
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
that arts program has to meet these
 
00:21:44.269 --> 00:21:44.279 align:start position:0%
academic standards that we got and then
 
00:21:46.149 --> 00:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
finally we have school district shall
 
00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:48.559 align:start position:0%
adhere to the assessment practices of Ed
 
00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
30619 so in the areas where we've got
 
00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
academic standards what we're trying to
 
00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
do with these rules is incorporate by
 
00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
reference all of these academic
 
00:22:00.269 --> 00:22:00.279 align:start position:0%
standards so that you know an educator
 
00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
reading this is they like oh okay so my
 
00:22:04.029 --> 00:22:04.039 align:start position:0%
arts program or a superintendent or
 
00:22:05.789 --> 00:22:05.799 align:start position:0%
curriculum person is going to read this
 
00:22:07.909 --> 00:22:07.919 align:start position:0%
and say like great I'm supposed to offer
 
00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
an Arts education program that looks
 
00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
like this um and so that's what we've
 
00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
tried to simplify these rules to help
 
00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
focus on that um you know that's that
 
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
was kind of the approach that we've
 
00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
taken so Frank commissioner yeah that's
 
00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:27.880 align:start position:0%
Frank is good too Frank's good um the
 
00:22:29.789 --> 00:22:29.799 align:start position:0%
curriculum Frameworks which we've had in
 
00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:33.320 align:start position:0%
the past have served as a guide as it's
 
00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
stated was stated in law and we took
 
00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
that out and now we're saying that the
 
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
curriculum Frameworks are our academic
 
00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
standards so I think that going back and
 
00:22:47.669 --> 00:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
again this has happened way this is go
 
00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:50.600 align:start position:0%
this one's going back to 2001 that the
 
00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
if you look at the history people have
 
00:22:54.909 --> 00:22:54.919 align:start position:0%
used academic standards and curriculum
 
00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
Frameworks synonymously right they have
 
00:23:00.029 --> 00:23:00.039 align:start position:0%
not distinguished so if I look at the
 
00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
K12 curriculum framework for the Arts
 
00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
dated April 2021 it says standard one
 
00:23:08.909 --> 00:23:08.919 align:start position:0%
standard two standard three so we have
 
00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
established in these Frameworks the
 
00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
academic standards that we expect
 
00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:15.400 align:start position:0%
students to meet so for example dance
 
00:23:17.149 --> 00:23:17.159 align:start position:0%
curriculum standard number one identify
 
00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
and demonstrate movement elements and
 
00:23:22.029 --> 00:23:22.039 align:start position:0%
skills of performance dance is the first
 
00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
standard if I and then the thing that's
 
00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:27.400 align:start position:0%
valuable is that you don't just leave it
 
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
at that kind of short sentence in these
 
00:23:32.269 --> 00:23:32.279 align:start position:0%
curriculum Frameworks then if you go
 
00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
over to like I've got an entire page
 
00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
that describes what that means right so
 
00:23:40.669 --> 00:23:40.679 align:start position:0%
Educators have a lot of guidance and it
 
00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:43.000 align:start position:0%
says at so if the first one the
 
00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
curriculum standard says Identify and
 
00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:45.880 align:start position:0%
demonstrate movement and elements of
 
00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:49.360 align:start position:0%
skill in performance dance so that then
 
00:23:51.789 --> 00:23:51.799 align:start position:0%
it says proficiency standards at the end
 
00:23:54.149 --> 00:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
of grade four students will be able to
 
00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
demonstrate axial movements demonstrate
 
00:23:59.110 --> 00:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
the eight basic locate loc motor
 
00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
movements of walk run hop jump skip Le
 
00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
like so we've we've given them a lot
 
00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
more meat about what it is that we have
 
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
an expectation but the idea of
 
00:24:12.029 --> 00:24:12.039 align:start position:0%
Frameworks being only guides doesn't
 
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
seem like like the these things over the
 
00:24:16.549 --> 00:24:16.559 align:start position:0%
years got different titles some got
 
00:24:18.789 --> 00:24:18.799 align:start position:0%
called Frameworks I got my health
 
00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:21.240 align:start position:0%
education curriculum guidelines which
 
00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:23.320 align:start position:0%
then enumerate all of the academic
 
00:24:25.269 --> 00:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
standards for health education and what
 
00:24:27.149 --> 00:24:27.159 align:start position:0%
it is that we expect these kids to know
 
00:24:30.269 --> 00:24:30.279 align:start position:0%
do they all say academic standards they
 
00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
all establish they use different
 
00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
vernacular in the titles but they all
 
00:24:37.389 --> 00:24:37.399 align:start position:0%
establish the standards of what we
 
00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:39.720 align:start position:0%
expect kids to know at the various
 
00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
levels so all of them use the vernacular
 
00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:44.600 align:start position:0%
about standards is that so stated at the
 
00:24:47.389 --> 00:24:47.399 align:start position:0%
front of each one of these I I've looked
 
00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
at them yeah and I got them all here too
 
00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:54.320 align:start position:0%
I get copies yes yeah um so I mean again
 
00:24:56.269 --> 00:24:56.279 align:start position:0%
this one Health is you know health
 
00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
education curriculum guidelines but if
 
00:24:59.710 --> 00:24:59.720 align:start position:0%
you go three p health education
 
00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:01.640 align:start position:0%
standards and assessment right so they
 
00:25:04.269 --> 00:25:04.279 align:start position:0%
all drive towards that I think the idea
 
00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
of the framework is sometimes you have
 
00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
more so for example in this Arts we've
 
00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
got a lot of introduction in here right
 
00:25:13.149 --> 00:25:13.159 align:start position:0%
because it talks about again what is the
 
00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
role of arts and education you know how
 
00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
do quality Arts programs contribute to
 
00:25:20.029 --> 00:25:20.039 align:start position:0%
the environment how do they develop what
 
00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:22.799 align:start position:0%
lifelong uh you know workplace skills
 
00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
you know how do you integrate the art so
 
00:25:26.389 --> 00:25:26.399 align:start position:0%
I think that I don't again I wasn't
 
00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:28.360 align:start position:0%
around in the in the time frame when
 
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
these were developed but the idea of
 
00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
framework was to say like well don't
 
00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
just tell them these like a common core
 
00:25:35.669 --> 00:25:35.679 align:start position:0%
these are all the academic standards as
 
00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:38.120 align:start position:0%
much as put some context about why we're
 
00:25:39.669 --> 00:25:39.679 align:start position:0%
doing this instruction and stuff like
 
00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
that but again it wasn't there so I'm
 
00:25:42.909 --> 00:25:42.919 align:start position:0%
speculating as to what the thought
 
00:25:45.549 --> 00:25:45.559 align:start position:0%
process might be but you can see what
 
00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:49.000 align:start position:0%
we're creating here is a system for the
 
00:25:53.269 --> 00:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
schools for the Educators that very
 
00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
tightly says you got to have the arts
 
00:25:58.350 --> 00:25:58.360 align:start position:0%
program and here's what our expect
 
00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
ations are with respect to that art
 
00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:02.600 align:start position:0%
program and not
 
00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
incorporate uh you know other stuff
 
00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:07.960 align:start position:0%
which may or may not be gerain to what
 
00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:10.120 align:start position:0%
it is we expect or it may send a
 
00:26:12.269 --> 00:26:12.279 align:start position:0%
conflicting message like we know that
 
00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:13.880 align:start position:0%
there are conflicts between what's in
 
00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
the back in the old back half and what's
 
00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
in the curriculum Frameworks and or the
 
00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:19.720 align:start position:0%
curriculum standards however you want to
 
00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:21.480 align:start position:0%
whatever vernacular you want to use and
 
00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
so what we think we're doing with this
 
00:26:26.789 --> 00:26:26.799 align:start position:0%
this this model that we're giving to
 
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
everybody and and quite frankly I don't
 
00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how it would be
 
00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
controversial because we're really just
 
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
clarifying the the the academic
 
00:26:39.389 --> 00:26:39.399 align:start position:0%
standards role in this whole process um
 
00:26:41.389 --> 00:26:41.399 align:start position:0%
and and so if I might then I want to
 
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
talk about a a couple of the areas that
 
00:26:45.909 --> 00:26:45.919 align:start position:0%
didn't have like these are academic
 
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
standards right and I got academic
 
00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:49.480 align:start position:0%
standards for many of my areas but I
 
00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:52.360 align:start position:0%
have some that I don't right as an
 
00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
example I've got a business education
 
00:26:57.789 --> 00:26:57.799 align:start position:0%
program and I don't have I think that
 
00:26:59.070 --> 00:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
actually representative luno might want
 
00:27:00.669 --> 00:27:00.679 align:start position:0%
to asked me a question so just just a
 
00:27:02.909 --> 00:27:02.919 align:start position:0%
quick question thank you very much Mr
 
00:27:06.549 --> 00:27:06.559 align:start position:0%
commissioner yeah um and and I and I I I
 
00:27:08.269 --> 00:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
really appreciate the explanation that
 
00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:10.240 align:start position:0%
you that you've given us this morning
 
00:27:14.029 --> 00:27:14.039 align:start position:0%
because I think it does help um help me
 
00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:17.080 align:start position:0%
understand what um what obviously what
 
00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
uh what the department has been trying
 
00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
to do and
 
00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
also uh I get I guess get a little bit
 
00:27:27.149 --> 00:27:27.159 align:start position:0%
better handle on um on some of the
 
00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
terminology that you're using for
 
00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:31.720 align:start position:0%
example you were just referring to you
 
00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
were just holding up curriculum
 
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
Frameworks right those are the that is
 
00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
that the stack of um things so well I
 
00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:39.240 align:start position:0%
mean some they have different titles
 
00:27:41.029 --> 00:27:41.039 align:start position:0%
they call they're called guidelines but
 
00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
if you look on our website they were all
 
00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:45.640 align:start position:0%
adopted by the State Board of Education
 
00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:50.240 align:start position:0%
as academic standards so so so we we we
 
00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
use these am I right then that we're
 
00:27:56.029 --> 00:27:56.039 align:start position:0%
using these terms um interchangeably
 
00:27:58.509 --> 00:27:58.519 align:start position:0%
curriculum Frameworks academics
 
00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:01.640 align:start position:0%
standards so what I'm using when I refer
 
00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
to these documents I refer to them as
 
00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
academic standards although they have
 
00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
different titles because that's I'm not
 
00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:08.600 align:start position:0%
worried about the title I'm worried
 
00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:10.640 align:start position:0%
about functionally white so functionally
 
00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:12.200 align:start position:0%
that's the way that the State Board of
 
00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:14.440 align:start position:0%
Education has acted on them okay
 
00:28:16.909 --> 00:28:16.919 align:start position:0%
historically no that that helps me a lot
 
00:28:19.269 --> 00:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
and and then just picking on the arts
 
00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
program because it's on the first you
 
00:28:23.789 --> 00:28:23.799 align:start position:0%
know the first part of the sheet um
 
00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:26.480 align:start position:0%
there's a lot that you explained that is
 
00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:29.240 align:start position:0%
in the existing rule
 
00:28:32.909 --> 00:28:32.919 align:start position:0%
30631 that you know sort of gets down
 
00:28:35.509 --> 00:28:35.519 align:start position:0%
analyze and evaluate uh recognize
 
00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
exemplary works all that stuff is
 
00:28:40.549 --> 00:28:40.559 align:start position:0%
essentially at least my understanding of
 
00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
what I think I heard you say is being
 
00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
replaced by in the new rule 27 B this
 
00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:51.720 align:start position:0%
reference to the curriculum framework
 
00:28:54.909 --> 00:28:54.919 align:start position:0%
for the Arts April 2001 edition that's
 
00:28:57.230 --> 00:28:57.240 align:start position:0%
correct okay so all this stuff which
 
00:28:59.909 --> 00:28:59.919 align:start position:0%
used to be in in
 
00:29:04.669 --> 00:29:04.679 align:start position:0%
31 is now is now that so and so and the
 
00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
reason just to reiterate kind of the
 
00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
reason why that the Legacy stuff that
 
00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
you had in the old Ed 306 Arts education
 
00:29:16.549 --> 00:29:16.559 align:start position:0%
was like a for the most part there have
 
00:29:18.149 --> 00:29:18.159 align:start position:0%
been some edits over the years but for
 
00:29:21.029 --> 00:29:21.039 align:start position:0%
the most part was content that was pre
 
00:29:24.269 --> 00:29:24.279 align:start position:0%
uh No Child Left Behind which didn't
 
00:29:27.549 --> 00:29:27.559 align:start position:0%
have the framework of high quality
 
00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:29.480 align:start position:0%
academic standards across these domain
 
00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:31.960 align:start position:0%
areas right so so I'm trying to get get
 
00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
get a sense as to what what uh what
 
00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:37.880 align:start position:0%
we're what we're looking at here so so
 
00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
uh What uh what's what's being proposed
 
00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
here is to
 
00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
replace sort of a page and a half of
 
00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
language from rule 31
 
00:29:52.789 --> 00:29:52.799 align:start position:0%
30631 with with what you just held up
 
00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
there which clearly has a lot more to it
 
00:29:57.310 --> 00:29:57.320 align:start position:0%
than than rule 31 so so let me just
 
00:29:58.669 --> 00:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
clarify because when you say that we're
 
00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:02.120 align:start position:0%
replacing it like this always existed
 
00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
right so it's not replacing that what
 
00:30:07.509 --> 00:30:07.519 align:start position:0%
we're concerned about is that that that
 
00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
old language in the Arts education might
 
00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
be confused by some people to be a
 
00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
faximile of this and it is a what I
 
00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:18.760 align:start position:0%
would refer to as a poor and sometimes
 
00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
inconsistent fa simile of this no no and
 
00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
I and and I I hear what you're saying on
 
00:30:25.909 --> 00:30:25.919 align:start position:0%
that commissioner U but in fact it is
 
00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
replacing it because it's
 
00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:31.960 align:start position:0%
deleting the the the you know everything
 
00:30:35.509 --> 00:30:35.519 align:start position:0%
in 31 that sort of defines that content
 
00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
or that academic standard um from the
 
00:30:40.909 --> 00:30:40.919 align:start position:0%
you know you've used other terms content
 
00:30:44.269 --> 00:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
areas contact expectations it's removing
 
00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
it from that and in the new rule 27 B
 
00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:51.480 align:start position:0%
each School's art education program
 
00:30:54.029 --> 00:30:54.039 align:start position:0%
shall have competencies and curriculums
 
00:30:56.909 --> 00:30:56.919 align:start position:0%
aligned to K12 curriculum framework for
 
00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:00.200 align:start position:0%
the Arts um April 2001 edition as
 
00:31:03.549 --> 00:31:03.559 align:start position:0%
referenced in appendix 2 cor so so so
 
00:31:06.029 --> 00:31:06.039 align:start position:0%
where where that curriculum framework
 
00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:08.840 align:start position:0%
was previously not Tethered to the to
 
00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
the minimum standards for school
 
00:31:13.509 --> 00:31:13.519 align:start position:0%
approval it is now connected to the it
 
00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:15.880 align:start position:0%
is now tethered and and part of the
 
00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
requirements so what I I would clarify
 
00:31:20.909 --> 00:31:20.919 align:start position:0%
that it was always required right so
 
00:31:23.629 --> 00:31:23.639 align:start position:0%
that the school districts under the old
 
00:31:26.389 --> 00:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
306 whether that is that in the front
 
00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:30.440 align:start position:0%
half were required to offer a uh
 
00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:34.120 align:start position:0%
academic program that aligned to the
 
00:31:35.509 --> 00:31:35.519 align:start position:0%
academic standards that have been
 
00:31:37.389 --> 00:31:37.399 align:start position:0%
adopted by the State Board of Education
 
00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
so simply so so nothing it's always been
 
00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:42.760 align:start position:0%
tethered it's not it's not a new
 
00:31:45.549 --> 00:31:45.559 align:start position:0%
tethering it's what it is it's a clearer
 
00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
tethering right because if I were to go
 
00:31:48.669 --> 00:31:48.679 align:start position:0%
through some of the front half we you
 
00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:50.720 align:start position:0%
know even in the old old front half of
 
00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:52.600 align:start position:0%
the 306s as well as the current half you
 
00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
know you're required to uh offer courses
 
00:31:58.990 --> 00:31:59.000 align:start position:0%
that align you're required to develop
 
00:32:00.549 --> 00:32:00.559 align:start position:0%
competencies that align to the state
 
00:32:02.029 --> 00:32:02.039 align:start position:0%
adopted academic standards like we've
 
00:32:04.029 --> 00:32:04.039 align:start position:0%
always said that but the problem is it
 
00:32:06.389 --> 00:32:06.399 align:start position:0%
was opaque and I don't think people were
 
00:32:08.909 --> 00:32:08.919 align:start position:0%
it it allowed people to as easily make
 
00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:11.080 align:start position:0%
the interconnect of what it is we're
 
00:32:13.509 --> 00:32:13.519 align:start position:0%
asking them to do this makes it very
 
00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:15.880 align:start position:0%
clear what our expectations are for what
 
00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:17.080 align:start position:0%
the children should be learning in
 
00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
school and and and and you so you you
 
00:32:23.389 --> 00:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
won't be confused and somehow think that
 
00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:24.760 align:start position:0%
because you looked at the back half
 
00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
you've met this requirement because you
 
00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:28.440 align:start position:0%
didn't look at another section of the
 
00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
rules someplace right so now we've made
 
00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:33.080 align:start position:0%
those connections in the content areas
 
00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:35.240 align:start position:0%
themselves which I think is a clearer
 
00:32:37.909 --> 00:32:37.919 align:start position:0%
way to communicate to our school leaders
 
00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
okay no I I appreciate so making those
 
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
connections in the content areas that's
 
00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:45.200 align:start position:0%
that's why we're referring to the back
 
00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:47.960 align:start position:0%
half as academic standards no we're not
 
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
referring to them as academic standards
 
00:32:52.549 --> 00:32:52.559 align:start position:0%
these are basically the areas of
 
00:32:54.269 --> 00:32:54.279 align:start position:0%
instruction that individuals are
 
00:32:59.110 --> 00:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
required to um you know offer and we're
 
00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
telling them what the criteria is for
 
00:33:02.029 --> 00:33:02.039 align:start position:0%
offering that right so in the front half
 
00:33:04.149 --> 00:33:04.159 align:start position:0%
we enumerate your required offer and our
 
00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
in in 30621 and 30622 we require you to
 
00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:11.000 align:start position:0%
offer an Arts education program and we
 
00:33:13.629 --> 00:33:13.639 align:start position:0%
are saying that that program shall have
 
00:33:16.149 --> 00:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
competencies in curriculum aligned to
 
00:33:19.629 --> 00:33:19.639 align:start position:0%
this document as it as has always been
 
00:33:22.549 --> 00:33:22.559 align:start position:0%
the uh you know the requirement but now
 
00:33:24.149 --> 00:33:24.159 align:start position:0%
it's clear what it is that you're trying
 
00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
to do right
 
00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
so uh represent edible then represent
 
00:33:31.029 --> 00:33:31.039 align:start position:0%
Cordell here uh this year we passed uh
 
00:33:31.039 --> 00:33:32.310 align:start position:0%
Cordell here uh this year we passed uh
HB

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
HB
 
00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:34.600 align:start position:0%
1107 this is a bill dealt with the
 
00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
curriculum Frameworks one in ufx
 
00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:40.120 align:start position:0%
September 10th 2024 so it's not yet on
 
00:33:43.269 --> 00:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
probably online we won't see it but it's
 
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
there and it says curriculum framework
 
00:33:48.389 --> 00:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
means an organized plan of study that
 
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
serves as a guide and reference to what
 
00:33:53.149 --> 00:33:53.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire student should know and be
 
00:33:56.629 --> 00:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
able to do in a learning area and
 
00:33:59.389 --> 00:33:59.399 align:start position:0%
identifies the academic standards
 
00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:02.200 align:start position:0%
aligned with learning area learning area
 
00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
pursuant to RSA 193
 
00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
e2a uh Roman
 
00:34:10.149 --> 00:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
1A so is this
 
00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:12.760 align:start position:0%
clarifying what you're trying you're
 
00:34:16.149 --> 00:34:16.159 align:start position:0%
doing as the department that this new
 
00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
statutory language which was placed put
 
00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
back into law is this doing is it is is
 
00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
it stated properly it says area and
 
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
identifies the ACT academic standards
 
00:34:33.829 --> 00:34:33.839 align:start position:0%
um so can I just answer Julie wants to
 
00:34:34.990 --> 00:34:35.000 align:start position:0%
answer in this but let me just waigh in
 
00:34:37.470 --> 00:34:37.480 align:start position:0%
so as I understood that law I thought
 
00:34:39.629 --> 00:34:39.639 align:start position:0%
that you were pushing out so for example
 
00:34:42.909 --> 00:34:42.919 align:start position:0%
I would say that my current uh you know
 
00:34:44.909 --> 00:34:44.919 align:start position:0%
K12 curriculum Frameworks for the Arts
 
00:34:46.629 --> 00:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
which includes the academic standards as
 
00:34:49.669 --> 00:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
that law requires also does the first
 
00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:52.520 align:start position:0%
half of that definition of pushing out
 
00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
and describing the context for how that
 
00:34:57.109 --> 00:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
would be applied and stuff like that but
 
00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:00.280 align:start position:0%
I will also say that so I have my nextg
 
00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
science standards right and my nextg
 
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
science standards they don't include
 
00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:07.800 align:start position:0%
they don't incorporate as much of that
 
00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
contextual information so these might
 
00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
potentially be
 
00:35:16.069 --> 00:35:16.079 align:start position:0%
more correctly identified as academic
 
00:35:18.349 --> 00:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
standards not in a curriculum framework
 
00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
so then this would be one that would
 
00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
require that c curriculum framework
 
00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:25.320 align:start position:0%
envelope around it um I think that many
 
00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
of and and perhaps even most of my other
 
00:35:30.109 --> 00:35:30.119 align:start position:0%
academic standards do have much of the
 
00:35:32.349 --> 00:35:32.359 align:start position:0%
framework language framework envelope
 
00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
around them already you know as an
 
00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
example like so we we pointed out like
 
00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
my health curriculum has you know a lot
 
00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
of introductory materials about the how
 
00:35:44.109 --> 00:35:44.119 align:start position:0%
the why the context but then it also
 
00:35:46.069 --> 00:35:46.079 align:start position:0%
specifically defines the academic
 
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
standard so as I understood the
 
00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
definition that you wrote you read there
 
00:35:52.829 --> 00:35:52.839 align:start position:0%
um you're basically the framework
 
00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
element of It kind of and again I don't
 
00:35:56.069 --> 00:35:56.079 align:start position:0%
know what they understood back then
 
00:35:58.630 --> 00:35:58.640 align:start position:0%
right but that it wraps an envelope
 
00:36:00.309 --> 00:36:00.319 align:start position:0%
around those academic standards to
 
00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
provide them context and I think that uh
 
00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
most of our currently adopted academic
 
00:36:06.589 --> 00:36:06.599 align:start position:0%
standards would probably meet the
 
00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
definition of framework some should be
 
00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
looked at so when we last identifi at
 
00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
the last framework which would B
 
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
basically the National Science standards
 
00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:17.000 align:start position:0%
I think that's the most recent yeah
 
00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
that's the one I was pointing to that's
 
00:36:21.589 --> 00:36:21.599 align:start position:0%
the one you're just pointing to and so
 
00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
do we have to then rework the science
 
00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:28.720 align:start position:0%
curriculum Frameworks to say that and to
 
00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
incorporate those national standards
 
00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
into that framework do we have a job in
 
00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
front of us to update some of these
 
00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
standards such as the social studies
 
00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
which is done back in 2006 yeah so I
 
00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
mean what I can tell you is that I I
 
00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
would frame it a little bit differently
 
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
I think we have good science academic
 
00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:48.680 align:start position:0%
standards what we would need to do to
 
00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
comply with that law is wrap them in the
 
00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
framework of context for uh the
 
00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
instruction but that you do have
 
00:36:58.270 --> 00:36:58.280 align:start position:0%
standards and again all of these have
 
00:36:59.510 --> 00:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
been adopted by the State Board of
 
00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
Education as academic standards the fact
 
00:37:03.829 --> 00:37:03.839 align:start position:0%
that they you know for example in arts
 
00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
the fact that it also when they adopted
 
00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:08.440 align:start position:0%
it it included the framework wrapping
 
00:37:11.069 --> 00:37:11.079 align:start position:0%
around it didn't you know diminish the
 
00:37:13.589 --> 00:37:13.599 align:start position:0%
fact that it directly Incorporated the
 
00:37:15.349 --> 00:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
academic standard expectations that we
 
00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:18.520 align:start position:0%
have for our children represent cordelli
 
00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
and and then at some point I want to
 
00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:21.240 align:start position:0%
Pivot to because because we haven't
 
00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
touched on all the areas so okay uh
 
00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here both of you um
 
00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:29.240 align:start position:0%
I I think this is helpful for me because
 
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
we faced some of this with legislation
 
00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:35.000 align:start position:0%
this past year we had uh several bills
 
00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:37.960 align:start position:0%
related to health and mental health and
 
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
we were looking at both the rules and
 
00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:44.440 align:start position:0%
then the health education CRI curriculum
 
00:37:47.109 --> 00:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
guidelines from 2003 and saying well
 
00:37:49.150 --> 00:37:49.160 align:start position:0%
which you know which is which you know
 
00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:52.040 align:start position:0%
what what are we going by and we talked
 
00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:53.720 align:start position:0%
about the curriculum guidelines from
 
00:37:57.150 --> 00:37:57.160 align:start position:0%
2003 looked quite comprehensive uh to us
 
00:37:59.829 --> 00:37:59.839 align:start position:0%
and I can see where there was the the
 
00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
framework around the standards um so I I
 
00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:06.640 align:start position:0%
think that this will help uh
 
00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
staff um understand you know what is
 
00:38:14.109 --> 00:38:14.119 align:start position:0%
expected of them and the students and um
 
00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:17.560 align:start position:0%
my only analogy would be with parents
 
00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:20.200 align:start position:0%
and the confusion they have with special
 
00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
education where we have federal law
 
00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:28.200 align:start position:0%
state law and then rules that
 
00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:31.160 align:start position:0%
and go Way Beyond both so you know it's
 
00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:33.720 align:start position:0%
hard for parents to understand what to
 
00:38:35.950 --> 00:38:35.960 align:start position:0%
look at and so I think if you know we
 
00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
can help staff to understand where the
 
00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
direction is and also help parents
 
00:38:45.309 --> 00:38:45.319 align:start position:0%
understand the direction of uh where
 
00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
things should be going uh I think will
 
00:38:50.309 --> 00:38:50.319 align:start position:0%
uh uh definitely improve uh education
 
00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
for the students so I mean I I do think
 
00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
that this is a more it's a clearer way
 
00:38:57.910 --> 00:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
to communicate right right like so
 
00:38:59.710 --> 00:38:59.720 align:start position:0%
essentially we're not changing anything
 
00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
so much as setting up the system so it's
 
00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:04.440 align:start position:0%
understandable and everybody recognizes
 
00:39:06.069 --> 00:39:06.079 align:start position:0%
you know what their obligations how
 
00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:08.200 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to go about doing this
 
00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:10.280 align:start position:0%
um and bear in mind that we have you
 
00:39:12.109 --> 00:39:12.119 align:start position:0%
know from the work that Christine Downey
 
00:39:14.309 --> 00:39:14.319 align:start position:0%
done you know one of our bullets was
 
00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
that is there something in here you know
 
00:39:19.309 --> 00:39:19.319 align:start position:0%
in these old back halfs that we need to
 
00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:21.160 align:start position:0%
bring forward and look at the academic
 
00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:23.480 align:start position:0%
standards I mean I can tell you one of
 
00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
the areas I I I hesitate to bring it up
 
00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
because um
 
00:39:29.589 --> 00:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
like I'm not making a proposal but I
 
00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
mean I think that there was some years
 
00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
there is a degree of agreement among
 
00:39:36.829 --> 00:39:36.839 align:start position:0%
many of our Educators even if I just
 
00:39:38.829 --> 00:39:38.839 align:start position:0%
look at my common core standards have
 
00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:42.040 align:start position:0%
not Incorporated a lot of the science of
 
00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
reading developments that we've seen so
 
00:39:46.990 --> 00:39:47.000 align:start position:0%
um you know is it possible then we need
 
00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
to be revisiting those but the idea of
 
00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
opening up Common Core just sort of
 
00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:51.560 align:start position:0%
scares me
 
00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:54.760 align:start position:0%
so um but I mean but so like so they've
 
00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
identified these things that were saying
 
00:39:57.670 --> 00:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
like yeah we got to keep working we need
 
00:39:58.829 --> 00:39:58.839 align:start position:0%
to continue working forward on our
 
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
standards but now we have a Model A
 
00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
framework sorry for using that
 
00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
vernacular twice here but whereby as a
 
00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:06.760 align:start position:0%
state it's clear what our expectations
 
00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:08.480 align:start position:0%
are how we're going forward what we're
 
00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:10.720 align:start position:0%
working on um but if I may let me just
 
00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:12.680 align:start position:0%
identify because if you recall in the
 
00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:14.200 align:start position:0%
work that Christine was doing and in our
 
00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
work on this there are some of these
 
00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:17.800 align:start position:0%
areas in the back half that we didn't
 
00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
have academic standards for so I just
 
00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
want to walk you through what those are
 
00:40:23.589 --> 00:40:23.599 align:start position:0%
and essentially what we have done uh
 
00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
with respect to those so the first area
 
00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:30.040 align:start position:0%
is business education right so we do not
 
00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
have business education academic
 
00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
standards that have been adopted by the
 
00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education what we have
 
00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
Incorporated are two elements that we
 
00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
think are important um in our CTE world
 
00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
so our Career and Technical education
 
00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:47.960 align:start position:0%
programming there's a lot of business
 
00:40:50.430 --> 00:40:50.440 align:start position:0%
education programs uh those business
 
00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:53.560 align:start position:0%
education programs have adopted
 
00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
competencies um and those the adoption
 
00:40:58.950 --> 00:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
of those competencies follows a process
 
00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
that includes uh you know the
 
00:41:02.790 --> 00:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
stakeholder inut from the CTE programs
 
00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
as well as the industry advisory boards
 
00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
and they have adopted those so uh we
 
00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
have brought those forward to
 
00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:12.680 align:start position:0%
incorporate into the business education
 
00:41:14.069 --> 00:41:14.079 align:start position:0%
program and that's the language that you
 
00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
see in front of you there to try and uh
 
00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:20.240 align:start position:0%
allow that to be incorporated so uh
 
00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
Frank yep when I look at
 
00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
1932a yeah the substance education CR
 
00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
business is not there correct um so are
 
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
the academic standards as later on
 
00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:39.160 align:start position:0%
talked in Roman four of that um H do
 
00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:41.560 align:start position:0%
they are these academic standards for
 
00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:44.720 align:start position:0%
the substant areas of an adequate
 
00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:48.440 align:start position:0%
education or are we now extending Beyond
 
00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
you know for example yeah there's
 
00:41:51.870 --> 00:41:51.880 align:start position:0%
nothing in in the Frameworks about
 
00:41:54.430 --> 00:41:54.440 align:start position:0%
personal finance literacy and that is in
 
00:41:56.349 --> 00:41:56.359 align:start position:0%
our but that is incorporated into the
 
00:41:57.750 --> 00:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
business though I have Incorporated
 
00:41:59.150 --> 00:41:59.160 align:start position:0%
personal financial literacy into this
 
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
but you're renaming economics or what as
 
00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
business because it's it's not there as
 
00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:07.880 align:start position:0%
a part of our adequate education correct
 
00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
I mean and this is a a conversation that
 
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
I don't even if jart wants to address it
 
00:42:14.309 --> 00:42:14.319 align:start position:0%
you know because you'll recall we had
 
00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:15.640 align:start position:0%
this conversation in the front half
 
00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:16.720 align:start position:0%
remember there was the list of
 
00:42:20.349 --> 00:42:20.359 align:start position:0%
instructional areas um that we included
 
00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
and you know because we had it in the
 
00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
past we did carry forward and you know
 
00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:25.720 align:start position:0%
we've gone back and forth of including
 
00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
not including uh you know there was we
 
00:42:29.829 --> 00:42:29.839 align:start position:0%
had family and consumer science and we
 
00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:31.720 align:start position:0%
had business education neither of which
 
00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
were enumerated in 193
 
00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:37.400 align:start position:0%
e2a um you know you'll notice that the
 
00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
family and consumer science is not
 
00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:40.440 align:start position:0%
incorporated into this because there was
 
00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:42.160 align:start position:0%
a belief that that would be embedded in
 
00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:45.200 align:start position:0%
the other areas um business education
 
00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
was there if if uh you know when this
 
00:42:49.069 --> 00:42:49.079 align:start position:0%
thing is in front of jel car if jel car
 
00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
wants us to remove the idea of business
 
00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
education we're happy to do that um you
 
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
know but we want to make sure that we're
 
00:42:59.630 --> 00:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
clear about uh you know so so I don't
 
00:43:01.950 --> 00:43:01.960 align:start position:0%
disagree that there is this what is a
 
00:43:05.349 --> 00:43:05.359 align:start position:0%
parent conflict that exists
 
00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:08.960 align:start position:0%
so yes rep s luno thanks very much Mr
 
00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
chair so um I I want to go back to um to
 
00:43:15.549 --> 00:43:15.559 align:start position:0%
what Arts yeah just just just because
 
00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
it's right at the right at the front and
 
00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
I think it's probably a good example to
 
00:43:23.589 --> 00:43:23.599 align:start position:0%
uh to to drill into okay um because
 
00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about it but um but I
 
00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:29.800 align:start position:0%
took a look at the uh again at the at
 
00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
the front half rules and uh where the
 
00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:36.400 align:start position:0%
existing rules and I'm looking at
 
00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
existing rule
 
00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
26 which is K8 so new proposed Rule 21
 
00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
um rep would would propose to replace it
 
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
but exist existing rule
 
00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
20 do I have it right
 
00:43:56.349 --> 00:43:56.359 align:start position:0%
26 uh well 21 is K kindergarten through
 
00:43:58.750 --> 00:43:58.760 align:start position:0%
8th grade school ccul yeah yeah but the
 
00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
existing rule number is 26 okay yeah and
 
00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:10.589 --> 00:44:10.599 align:start position:0%
30631 which is on the front page of the
 
00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:13.160 align:start position:0%
of the back half with respect to
 
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
relative to an Arts education and um and
 
00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm trying to find out where in
 
00:44:24.109 --> 00:44:24.119 align:start position:0%
the minimum the minimum standards for
 
00:44:24.119 --> 00:44:25.150 align:start position:0%
the minimum the minimum standards for
school

00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:25.160 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:44:29.349 --> 00:44:29.359 align:start position:0%
approval where where either where any of
 
00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
these 306 rules um refer to the uh the
 
00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:36.680 align:start position:0%
Frameworks the academic standards
 
00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
whatever you want
 
00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:40.760 align:start position:0%
to I just I couldn't find it so that's
 
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
okay I'll have I'll find it for you just
 
00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:46.270 align:start position:0%
okay I'll have I'll find it for you just
one

00:44:46.270 --> 00:44:46.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:58.710 --> 00:44:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
very I'm reading on page 21 School
 
00:45:11.349 --> 00:45:11.359 align:start position:0%
District shall adop District based on
 
00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:14.480 align:start position:0%
State academic standards where for all
 
00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:17.640 align:start position:0%
coures of study school districts may use
 
00:45:19.829 --> 00:45:19.839 align:start position:0%
State model competencies to develop
 
00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
distri compes all right so um so this is
 
00:45:31.349 --> 00:45:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:33.829 --> 00:45:33.839 align:start position:0%
right I don't know I I think I'm looking
 
00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:35.640 align:start position:0%
this is I'm I'm looking out a document
 
00:45:39.790 --> 00:45:39.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:44.670 align:start position:0%
 
proposal

00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:44.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:50.280 align:start position:0%
reest not it I don't yeah yeah yeah yeah
 
00:45:52.270 --> 00:45:52.280 align:start position:0%
I I actually I see I there's another one
 
00:45:54.309 --> 00:45:54.319 align:start position:0%
that says um conditional approval
 
00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
request and it's got your your
 
00:46:00.109 --> 00:46:00.119 align:start position:0%
letterhead on the the front so page 21
 
00:46:00.119 --> 00:46:06.470 align:start position:0%
letterhead on the the front so page 21
on

00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:15.829 --> 00:46:15.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:19.000 align:start position:0%
U okay and is that is that in current
 
00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
rule that's in this
 
00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:24.150 align:start position:0%
rule that's in this
proposal

00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
00:46:26.270 --> 00:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
place so what what what I'm really
 
00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:30.280 align:start position:0%
trying to get that is is is you you
 
00:46:33.870 --> 00:46:33.880 align:start position:0%
know we're talking about how the
 
00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
curriculum Frameworks here I think I use
 
00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:40.440 align:start position:0%
the term are going to replace what's
 
00:46:43.150 --> 00:46:43.160 align:start position:0%
what's in rule 31 right now so the Arts
 
00:46:46.109 --> 00:46:46.119 align:start position:0%
framework replac no no no and that's and
 
00:46:48.589 --> 00:46:48.599 align:start position:0%
that's fine um and and and I said well
 
00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
the framework I think I asked whether
 
00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:53.720 align:start position:0%
the framework had been Tethered to the
 
00:46:56.950 --> 00:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
existing rules and you said they are um
 
00:46:58.829 --> 00:46:58.839 align:start position:0%
and so I'm just trying to determine
 
00:47:01.510 --> 00:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
where the where where they are because
 
00:47:03.470 --> 00:47:03.480 align:start position:0%
if they are part of if they are Tethered
 
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
to the existing rules then they then the
 
00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
Frameworks are in fact a requirement for
 
00:47:10.589 --> 00:47:10.599 align:start position:0%
minimum you know minimum requirement for
 
00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:13.640 align:start position:0%
school approval if they're not connected
 
00:47:15.309 --> 00:47:15.319 align:start position:0%
then they're not a requirement and in
 
00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
fact what would be the requirement is
 
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
what's in
 
00:47:21.870 --> 00:47:21.880 align:start position:0%
30631 the part that's being removed and
 
00:47:24.349 --> 00:47:24.359 align:start position:0%
so what I'm what I'm respectfully
 
00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
suggesting is that if what's being
 
00:47:29.710 --> 00:47:29.720 align:start position:0%
removed which talks a lot about what
 
00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
goes into an Arts you know curriculum
 
00:47:35.309 --> 00:47:35.319 align:start position:0%
and maybe and may be confusing given the
 
00:47:38.670 --> 00:47:38.680 align:start position:0%
comprehensive I know and having not seen
 
00:47:40.990 --> 00:47:41.000 align:start position:0%
that I I but you know you can just look
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
at the size of the binder clip you've
 
00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:46.040 align:start position:0%
got there um I I would agree with it but
 
00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
in fact that if if if that wasn't
 
00:47:51.390 --> 00:47:51.400 align:start position:0%
already a requirement and is now
 
00:47:54.190 --> 00:47:54.200 align:start position:0%
becoming a requirement than it is in
 
00:47:56.670 --> 00:47:56.680 align:start position:0%
fact a change to academic requirements
 
00:47:58.870 --> 00:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
the because now we're saying that that
 
00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:00.680 align:start position:0%
one thing that that used to be an
 
00:48:04.270 --> 00:48:04.280 align:start position:0%
academic requirement in 31 is now
 
00:48:07.829 --> 00:48:07.839 align:start position:0%
being connected to something else
 
00:48:09.870 --> 00:48:09.880 align:start position:0%
instead um so the way that I would
 
00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
respond to that and I'm not prepared
 
00:48:13.790 --> 00:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
today to to create that teing to the old
 
00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
rule because I just haven't looked it up
 
00:48:17.109 --> 00:48:17.119 align:start position:0%
and it obviously it's very complicated
 
00:48:20.430 --> 00:48:20.440 align:start position:0%
um I don't think that there's anyone in
 
00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
the education environment today
 
00:48:27.349 --> 00:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
who would not say that this is our
 
00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
expectation for what children should be
 
00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
learning in um you know School my
 
00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:33.480 align:start position:0%
curriculum and instruction folks are
 
00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
very familiar and you're I mean even
 
00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
just take math and science or math and
 
00:48:38.990 --> 00:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
uh and English and my common core
 
00:48:42.109 --> 00:48:42.119 align:start position:0%
standards like everybody um certainly
 
00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
understands like like I would be
 
00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
hesitant it almost sounds like the
 
00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
argument that you're making up right now
 
00:48:49.390 --> 00:48:49.400 align:start position:0%
is that somehow Common Core math and
 
00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
Common Core English are not required in
 
00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
the schools um and I think that that and
 
00:48:57.190 --> 00:48:57.200 align:start position:0%
I'm I'd have to go back and figure out
 
00:48:59.390 --> 00:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
where that Nexus is drawn specifically
 
00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:01.400 align:start position:0%
but I believe that it is probably quite
 
00:49:04.430 --> 00:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
clearly drawn uh some you know in in a
 
00:49:06.190 --> 00:49:06.200 align:start position:0%
variety places maybe not as clearly as
 
00:49:07.230 --> 00:49:07.240 align:start position:0%
it could have which is why we're trying
 
00:49:08.670 --> 00:49:08.680 align:start position:0%
to clarify things here but I don't think
 
00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
anybody's arguing that those things are
 
00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
not what our expectations are for
 
00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
children yeah no I I I I hear what
 
00:49:16.589 --> 00:49:16.599 align:start position:0%
you're saying on that but but I think if
 
00:49:20.349 --> 00:49:20.359 align:start position:0%
if we if we are going to be be you know
 
00:49:23.349 --> 00:49:23.359 align:start position:0%
referring to the the Frameworks the
 
00:49:25.829 --> 00:49:25.839 align:start position:0%
academic standards in the new rules
 
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
we're incorporating them by reference
 
00:49:28.789 --> 00:49:28.799 align:start position:0%
yeah that's what I'm saying yeah that's
 
00:49:30.910 --> 00:49:30.920 align:start position:0%
referring to themp incorporating them by
 
00:49:33.630 --> 00:49:33.640 align:start position:0%
reference then um then we should know
 
00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
what those uh what those new AC what
 
00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
those academic standards that are now
 
00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
being referred um and now being
 
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
incorporated into the rules by reference
 
00:49:45.069 --> 00:49:45.079 align:start position:0%
we should understand what they are we
 
00:49:48.430 --> 00:49:48.440 align:start position:0%
should understand um whether or not um
 
00:49:51.109 --> 00:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
schools are already in compliance with
 
00:49:53.549 --> 00:49:53.559 align:start position:0%
those standards particularly if they're
 
00:49:56.750 --> 00:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
if they're not currently required under
 
00:49:58.630 --> 00:49:58.640 align:start position:0%
rules and we got to we got to sort that
 
00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:00.200 align:start position:0%
out we haven't been able to find that
 
00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
that reference yet so so I so I guess
 
00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
the only thing and Julie wants to jump
 
00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
in I can tell and and I I guess the
 
00:50:08.190 --> 00:50:08.200 align:start position:0%
third point I would want to know too on
 
00:50:11.710 --> 00:50:11.720 align:start position:0%
him is is that uh in fact our our
 
00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
curriculum Frameworks that were
 
00:50:16.309 --> 00:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
developed in 2001 are those still
 
00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
considered by by um by Arts uh teachers
 
00:50:24.510 --> 00:50:24.520 align:start position:0%
to be um to be you know uh relevant and
 
00:50:27.309 --> 00:50:27.319 align:start position:0%
um and up to date I guess I mean I don't
 
00:50:28.710 --> 00:50:28.720 align:start position:0%
have the answers today so these are the
 
00:50:31.710 --> 00:50:31.720 align:start position:0%
academic standards so okay you go ahead
 
00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
Sor um all right so in in this back half
 
00:50:37.549 --> 00:50:37.559 align:start position:0%
if you look at each of the sections um
 
00:50:40.589 --> 00:50:40.599 align:start position:0%
we have tethered each piece back to
 
00:50:43.270 --> 00:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
those sections they're not numbered in
 
00:50:44.309 --> 00:50:44.319 align:start position:0%
the same way as what you were just
 
00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:45.720 align:start position:0%
referring to because these are the new
 
00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
numbers so in a for Arts education
 
00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
you'll see it says 21 22 yeah sorry what
 
00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:54.640 align:start position:0%
yes so um which was formerly 26 and 27
 
00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
exactly so each so you know it's saying
 
00:50:58.390 --> 00:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
the appropriate Arts education program
 
00:50:59.870 --> 00:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
for each School contestant with local
 
00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
competencies and curriculum pursuant to
 
00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
30621 and 30622 which is the K through 8
 
00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
section and then the high school section
 
00:51:11.549 --> 00:51:11.559 align:start position:0%
so um it is kind of tying those um
 
00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
requirements back to those sections in
 
00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
each area rather than but but in in in
 
00:51:20.109 --> 00:51:20.119 align:start position:0%
306 um
 
00:51:24.589 --> 00:51:24.599 align:start position:0%
21 looking at the K8 section uh on page
 
00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
42 of the side by side that we got so
 
00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:30.950 align:start position:0%
42 of the side by side that we got so
I'm

00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:33.870 --> 00:51:33.880 align:start position:0%
not the only the only
 
00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
reference to to Arts education in in K8
 
00:51:43.789 --> 00:51:43.799 align:start position:0%
306 proposed rule number
 
00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
21 is a Arts education including music
 
00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
and visual arts that's all it says so
 
00:51:54.829 --> 00:51:54.839 align:start position:0%
you're looking for a citation 2 30626 or
 
00:51:57.349 --> 00:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
whatever it is to tie those two sections
 
00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
together no I mean I think um 30
 
00:52:07.470 --> 00:52:07.480 align:start position:0%
30627 the new the new Arts refers to
 
00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
30621 but but but the only thing 30621
 
00:52:13.390 --> 00:52:13.400 align:start position:0%
says for Elementary grades 1 through
 
00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
eight where no middle school has been
 
00:52:16.670 --> 00:52:16.680 align:start position:0%
established by vote of the local school
 
00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
board um local Schoolboard shall um you
 
00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:23.200 align:start position:0%
know you compens in the following areas
 
00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
and the only part related to Arts says
 
00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
Arts education including music and
 
00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
visual arts that's all it says that's
 
00:52:31.710 --> 00:52:31.720 align:start position:0%
all 21 says so so but the way that the
 
00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
framework works is then we enumerate
 
00:52:35.710 --> 00:52:35.720 align:start position:0%
what is an Arts education and now when
 
00:52:37.630 --> 00:52:37.640 align:start position:0%
we enumerate what is in arts education
 
00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
this is what an Arts education is right
 
00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
so there's no that's in part in
 
00:52:46.150 --> 00:52:46.160 align:start position:0%
paragraph B correct 27 so when so when
 
00:52:47.710 --> 00:52:47.720 align:start position:0%
you reach that place it says Arts
 
00:52:51.109 --> 00:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
education you're going this is what our
 
00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
expectations are for your art education
 
00:52:55.349 --> 00:52:55.359 align:start position:0%
program right so the qu the question is
 
00:52:57.510 --> 00:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
is that the current because the the
 
00:52:59.789 --> 00:52:59.799 align:start position:0%
current standard for Arts education is
 
00:53:03.270 --> 00:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
the part that was cut out of of of the
 
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
old 3063 I don't I don't know that
 
00:53:06.990 --> 00:53:07.000 align:start position:0%
that's the case well I mean it's
 
00:53:08.349 --> 00:53:08.359 align:start position:0%
different than what you're holding up
 
00:53:10.030 --> 00:53:10.040 align:start position:0%
because this is only a page and a half
 
00:53:12.270 --> 00:53:12.280 align:start position:0%
and that's got a half inch binder clip
 
00:53:15.910 --> 00:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
on it when we so everything that was in
 
00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
that in the current
 
00:53:20.190 --> 00:53:20.200 align:start position:0%
rule a lot of it was duplicative of
 
00:53:22.589 --> 00:53:22.599 align:start position:0%
what's already in those standards and so
 
00:53:25.069 --> 00:53:25.079 align:start position:0%
by incorporating that document by
 
00:53:27.589 --> 00:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
reference that is making that entire
 
00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:30.160 align:start position:0%
document the rule but it's far too long
 
00:53:33.789 --> 00:53:33.799 align:start position:0%
to list no no I'm not I I I I'm fully on
 
00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
board with incorporating by reference I
 
00:53:37.430 --> 00:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
mean my background is engineering
 
00:53:39.150 --> 00:53:39.160 align:start position:0%
everything's Incorporated by reference
 
00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:41.200 align:start position:0%
on that or else you know any spec would
 
00:53:43.630 --> 00:53:43.640 align:start position:0%
be a gazillion pages long so but but
 
00:53:44.950 --> 00:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
representative luno I don't think
 
00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
anybody is under the misconception like
 
00:53:50.670 --> 00:53:50.680 align:start position:0%
you're you're framing the conversation
 
00:53:53.309 --> 00:53:53.319 align:start position:0%
as if that back half was the academic
 
00:53:56.069 --> 00:53:56.079 align:start position:0%
standard and I don't think that that is
 
00:53:58.870 --> 00:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
um our understanding of what that is our
 
00:54:01.349 --> 00:54:01.359 align:start position:0%
understanding is that that is a rule uh
 
00:54:04.829 --> 00:54:04.839 align:start position:0%
that predated for the most part 2000
 
00:54:06.910 --> 00:54:06.920 align:start position:0%
that included something prior to the
 
00:54:08.670 --> 00:54:08.680 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education actually
 
00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
adopting the framework and academic
 
00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
standards and as a result of that this
 
00:54:16.589 --> 00:54:16.599 align:start position:0%
is our academic standard when the State
 
00:54:19.549 --> 00:54:19.559 align:start position:0%
Board of Education adopted you know
 
00:54:22.430 --> 00:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
Common Core math and Comm core English
 
00:54:24.750 --> 00:54:24.760 align:start position:0%
the schools did not then when they were
 
00:54:26.950 --> 00:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
teaching math instruction ref only to
 
00:54:28.789 --> 00:54:28.799 align:start position:0%
the back half they knew that they were
 
00:54:31.230 --> 00:54:31.240 align:start position:0%
developing and implementing curriculum
 
00:54:34.069 --> 00:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
that align to those Common Core academic
 
00:54:36.910 --> 00:54:36.920 align:start position:0%
standards there was no confusion that a
 
00:54:38.069 --> 00:54:38.079 align:start position:0%
school district said like well we're
 
00:54:39.430 --> 00:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
going to ignore those standards and
 
00:54:40.549 --> 00:54:40.559 align:start position:0%
we're only going to do the stuff that's
 
00:54:42.549 --> 00:54:42.559 align:start position:0%
in the back
 
00:54:45.069 --> 00:54:45.079 align:start position:0%
half so I don't think that so your
 
00:54:47.069 --> 00:54:47.079 align:start position:0%
characterization of those of that back
 
00:54:50.589 --> 00:54:50.599 align:start position:0%
half being the academic standards that
 
00:54:54.390 --> 00:54:54.400 align:start position:0%
was uh not the case because the State
 
00:54:56.349 --> 00:54:56.359 align:start position:0%
Board of Education had adopted academic
 
00:54:57.630 --> 00:54:57.640 align:start position:0%
stands across these areas except for the
 
00:54:58.630 --> 00:54:58.640 align:start position:0%
ones that I'm going to take you through
 
00:55:00.069 --> 00:55:00.079 align:start position:0%
that we didn't adopt no no fair fair
 
00:55:01.750 --> 00:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
enough I just don't see any reference in
 
00:55:05.589 --> 00:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
the existing 306 rules any reference to
 
00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
those um academic standards the
 
00:55:09.470 --> 00:55:09.480 align:start position:0%
curriculum framework correct and I'm
 
00:55:12.030 --> 00:55:12.040 align:start position:0%
happy to go back and I'll Define the NEX
 
00:55:14.190 --> 00:55:14.200 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll develop that connection for
 
00:55:16.870 --> 00:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
you and um or and because essentially
 
00:55:19.990 --> 00:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
what I think you're the the uh the frame
 
00:55:21.950 --> 00:55:21.960 align:start position:0%
that you're setting up is that uh for
 
00:55:24.270 --> 00:55:24.280 align:start position:0%
the last 20 years schools have been
 
00:55:26.190 --> 00:55:26.200 align:start position:0%
complying with these academic standards
 
00:55:27.230 --> 00:55:27.240 align:start position:0%
that that have been set as the
 
00:55:30.190 --> 00:55:30.200 align:start position:0%
expectation and that you're I I I'm I'm
 
00:55:31.549 --> 00:55:31.559 align:start position:0%
a little bit concerned about your uh
 
00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
your line of argumentation because
 
00:55:34.349 --> 00:55:34.359 align:start position:0%
you're saying and schools didn't have to
 
00:55:35.589 --> 00:55:35.599 align:start position:0%
comply with any of that stuff for the
 
00:55:37.230 --> 00:55:37.240 align:start position:0%
last 20 years I just I just want to know
 
00:55:39.549 --> 00:55:39.559 align:start position:0%
if they if they had to or not given the
 
00:55:43.309 --> 00:55:43.319 align:start position:0%
minimum standards not I believe not yeah
 
00:55:46.750 --> 00:55:46.760 align:start position:0%
I I I I I think it's good to have to
 
00:55:49.069 --> 00:55:49.079 align:start position:0%
have compliance with rigorous academic
 
00:55:52.630 --> 00:55:52.640 align:start position:0%
standards I'm all in favor of that but
 
00:55:54.750 --> 00:55:54.760 align:start position:0%
but if it wasn't there before then it's
 
00:55:56.870 --> 00:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
a change to academic St standards which
 
00:55:59.750 --> 00:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
I think this so so it wouldn't is about
 
00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:00.950 align:start position:0%
I think this so so it wouldn't is about
and

00:56:00.950 --> 00:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:56:03.789 --> 00:56:03.799 align:start position:0%
and want to see what I just want to
 
00:56:04.990 --> 00:56:05.000 align:start position:0%
clarify something because it's not a
 
00:56:06.670 --> 00:56:06.680 align:start position:0%
change to academic standards we have not
 
00:56:09.029 --> 00:56:09.039 align:start position:0%
changed these academic standards again
 
00:56:10.670 --> 00:56:10.680 align:start position:0%
when you characterize that back half as
 
00:56:12.349 --> 00:56:12.359 align:start position:0%
the academic standards then you may
 
00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
assume that it's a chang to academic
 
00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
standards these are the academic
 
00:56:17.829 --> 00:56:17.839 align:start position:0%
standards we are not changing academic
 
00:56:19.750 --> 00:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
standards and and even to your point
 
00:56:21.630 --> 00:56:21.640 align:start position:0%
like like I'm trying to be constructive
 
00:56:24.670 --> 00:56:24.680 align:start position:0%
in terms of how do we go forward like
 
00:56:26.309 --> 00:56:26.319 align:start position:0%
even like I'm going to go back and I'll
 
00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
try and create this Nexus so you can see
 
00:56:30.789 --> 00:56:30.799 align:start position:0%
how this stuff was working but either
 
00:56:34.349 --> 00:56:34.359 align:start position:0%
way moving forward we've now created a
 
00:56:37.789 --> 00:56:37.799 align:start position:0%
system that has Clarity that is clear in
 
00:56:39.549 --> 00:56:39.559 align:start position:0%
terms of this is how you operate a
 
00:56:41.390 --> 00:56:41.400 align:start position:0%
school these are expectations for kids
 
00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
learning everybody's on the same page
 
00:56:46.309 --> 00:56:46.319 align:start position:0%
we've eliminated the risk associated
 
00:56:49.829 --> 00:56:49.839 align:start position:0%
with uh you know those um somebody
 
00:56:51.390 --> 00:56:51.400 align:start position:0%
incorrectly understanding what the
 
00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
expectation was for the children and I
 
00:56:54.990 --> 00:56:55.000 align:start position:0%
think the way that you're characterizing
 
00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
it is not
 
00:56:59.630 --> 00:56:59.640 align:start position:0%
um I've never experienced uh well I'm
 
00:57:00.910 --> 00:57:00.920 align:start position:0%
just not sure it's a it's a good
 
00:57:02.430 --> 00:57:02.440 align:start position:0%
characterization yeah all I'm all I'm
 
00:57:05.230 --> 00:57:05.240 align:start position:0%
saying is is I want to see the link
 
00:57:08.990 --> 00:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
between the existing 306 rules and what
 
00:57:10.990 --> 00:57:11.000 align:start position:0%
you're what you're referring to as the
 
00:57:13.190 --> 00:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
academic standards I want to understand
 
00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:15.680 align:start position:0%
what that connection is what where that
 
00:57:17.549 --> 00:57:17.559 align:start position:0%
requirement you know exists under
 
00:57:20.750 --> 00:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
current uh 306 rules and U that that
 
00:57:22.670 --> 00:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
would I think help uh help me out a lot
 
00:57:26.349 --> 00:57:26.359 align:start position:0%
okay thank I think there's confusion
 
00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
as a result of what the legislature did
 
00:57:33.589 --> 00:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
going back probably about nine years ago
 
00:57:36.150 --> 00:57:36.160 align:start position:0%
when we dumped the curriculum
 
00:57:38.750 --> 00:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
Frameworks and so then folks were
 
00:57:42.710 --> 00:57:42.720 align:start position:0%
looking and saying what is health and so
 
00:57:45.230 --> 00:57:45.240 align:start position:0%
we went to the 306 Sy and oh it list
 
00:57:46.950 --> 00:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
mental health and emotional this and
 
00:57:49.630 --> 00:57:49.640 align:start position:0%
that in there that I think was the
 
00:57:52.270 --> 00:57:52.280 align:start position:0%
Assumption of where the academic
 
00:57:53.990 --> 00:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
standards were
 
00:57:58.549 --> 00:57:58.559 align:start position:0%
located um and and since then we
 
00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:00.720 align:start position:0%
realized through the legislative action
 
00:58:04.390 --> 00:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
we took this last session that we the
 
00:58:08.510 --> 00:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
curriculum Frameworks are the the the
 
00:58:11.190 --> 00:58:11.200 align:start position:0%
documents which are aligned with the
 
00:58:13.029 --> 00:58:13.039 align:start position:0%
academic standards and contain the
 
00:58:13.039 --> 00:58:14.270 align:start position:0%
academic standards and contain the
academic

00:58:14.270 --> 00:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
academic
 
00:58:17.430 --> 00:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
standards and and so I've asked the
 
00:58:19.910 --> 00:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
question over and over and over again to
 
00:58:21.990 --> 00:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
probably yourself rank as one where are
 
00:58:23.870 --> 00:58:23.880 align:start position:0%
the academic standards what are the
 
00:58:26.910 --> 00:58:26.920 align:start position:0%
academic standards and and you've always
 
00:58:29.470 --> 00:58:29.480 align:start position:0%
responded to me curriculum Frameworks I
 
00:58:31.150 --> 00:58:31.160 align:start position:0%
said we don't have curriculum Frameworks
 
00:58:34.589 --> 00:58:34.599 align:start position:0%
we dump those and so then people because
 
00:58:36.109 --> 00:58:36.119 align:start position:0%
we dumped them saying okay now we're
 
00:58:38.349 --> 00:58:38.359 align:start position:0%
going to go to 306s that's where we're
 
00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:40.160 align:start position:0%
seeing the the the statement that
 
00:58:41.789 --> 00:58:41.799 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli mentioned when we had
 
00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
that confusion this year mental Health's
 
00:58:45.829 --> 00:58:45.839 align:start position:0%
listed there as some of those content
 
00:58:45.839 --> 00:58:47.309 align:start position:0%
listed there as some of those content
areas

00:58:47.309 --> 00:58:47.319 align:start position:0%
areas
 
00:58:50.390 --> 00:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
within you're referencing within Health
 
00:58:53.390 --> 00:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
um so I I think it's partially our fault
 
00:58:55.510 --> 00:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
for what's going on and I think we need
 
00:58:57.190 --> 00:58:57.200 align:start position:0%
to get back to have some clarity as
 
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
exactly what are the academic standards
 
00:59:01.549 --> 00:59:01.559 align:start position:0%
and where they're located I think we've
 
00:59:04.309 --> 00:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
done that um or in the process of trying
 
00:59:07.069 --> 00:59:07.079 align:start position:0%
to get there and that's really what
 
00:59:08.470 --> 00:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do is just create a
 
00:59:10.309 --> 00:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
cohesive system that's understandable
 
00:59:11.750 --> 00:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
and clear for everybody so that you
 
00:59:13.109 --> 00:59:13.119 align:start position:0%
don't have to ask questions like well
 
00:59:14.670 --> 00:59:14.680 align:start position:0%
where are these things tethered right
 
00:59:16.510 --> 00:59:16.520 align:start position:0%
are they tethered are they not tethered
 
00:59:18.029 --> 00:59:18.039 align:start position:0%
are does common core standard just float
 
00:59:19.510 --> 00:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
out and in some ether sphere that we
 
00:59:21.190 --> 00:59:21.200 align:start position:0%
don't have to comply with is kind of
 
00:59:23.670 --> 00:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
your implication and I'm like uh you
 
00:59:25.829 --> 00:59:25.839 align:start position:0%
know this system as we've kind of laid
 
00:59:29.549 --> 00:59:29.559 align:start position:0%
it out is basically just creating a
 
00:59:37.990 --> 00:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
follow you have any else so the I mean
 
00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
I'll just so I'll just hit the other
 
00:59:43.230 --> 00:59:43.240 align:start position:0%
areas so we talked about business Ed uh
 
00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
we talked about so School counseling was
 
00:59:46.910 --> 00:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
one of the areas that was in the back
 
00:59:49.109 --> 00:59:49.119 align:start position:0%
half um that we don't have academic
 
00:59:51.190 --> 00:59:51.200 align:start position:0%
standards for and truthly it's a little
 
00:59:53.950 --> 00:59:53.960 align:start position:0%
bit out of place but um in terms of
 
00:59:55.710 --> 00:59:55.720 align:start position:0%
being there but we just pretty much you
 
00:59:57.230 --> 00:59:57.240 align:start position:0%
know whe than tuning up the language we
 
00:59:59.789 --> 00:59:59.799 align:start position:0%
basically kept that program um you know
 
01:00:01.549 --> 01:00:01.559 align:start position:0%
kept much of that language other than
 
01:00:03.309 --> 01:00:03.319 align:start position:0%
try to just make it more concise and
 
01:00:06.549 --> 01:00:06.559 align:start position:0%
precise um digital literacy was one uh
 
01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
the language that we got into the back
 
01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
half for digital literacy was the
 
01:00:11.470 --> 01:00:11.480 align:start position:0%
language that we had in the front half
 
01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
for graduation requirements with respect
 
01:00:14.950 --> 01:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
to digital literacy so that those are
 
01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
consistent and again aiming for
 
01:00:19.270 --> 01:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
consistency and then the last area was
 
01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
something called Tech engineering and um
 
01:00:24.309 --> 01:00:24.319 align:start position:0%
again there don't have engineering
 
01:00:25.390 --> 01:00:25.400 align:start position:0%
academic standards that have been
 
01:00:27.990 --> 01:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
adopted so so we incorporated into this
 
01:00:30.750 --> 01:00:30.760 align:start position:0%
back half the uh competencies that are
 
01:00:32.349 --> 01:00:32.359 align:start position:0%
used in the Career and Technical
 
01:00:34.990 --> 01:00:35.000 align:start position:0%
education engineering programs and so
 
01:00:36.309 --> 01:00:36.319 align:start position:0%
those are the four areas is there one
 
01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:38.240 align:start position:0%
more okay I just wanted to just point
 
01:00:40.829 --> 01:00:40.839 align:start position:0%
out in case anybody um was looking at it
 
01:00:43.349 --> 01:00:43.359 align:start position:0%
that um the last section Holocaust and
 
01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:45.240 align:start position:0%
genocide curriculum was repealed it is
 
01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
not taken away we added it to social
 
01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
studies uh because it is a section of
 
01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:51.240 align:start position:0%
social studies and it's supposed to be
 
01:00:53.589 --> 01:00:53.599 align:start position:0%
integrated into social studies so again
 
01:00:55.470 --> 01:00:55.480 align:start position:0%
for consistency rather than it being its
 
01:00:56.510 --> 01:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
own section
 
01:00:58.270 --> 01:00:58.280 align:start position:0%
we didn't change any of the language we
 
01:01:01.390 --> 01:01:01.400 align:start position:0%
just moved it over to social
 
01:01:03.710 --> 01:01:03.720 align:start position:0%
studies thank you and and yes we have
 
01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
these 13 areas that you're referencing
 
01:01:07.829 --> 01:01:07.839 align:start position:0%
right here 193
 
01:01:13.789 --> 01:01:13.799 align:start position:0%
e2a and or 11 um 11 areas but then we
 
01:01:18.069 --> 01:01:18.079 align:start position:0%
have 12 and 13 which are not areas of
 
01:01:20.349 --> 01:01:20.359 align:start position:0%
substance criteria for inadequate
 
01:01:23.789 --> 01:01:23.799 align:start position:0%
education computer and digital
 
01:01:27.910 --> 01:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
literacy and logic and rhetoric thinking
 
01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:28.829 align:start position:0%
literacy and logic and rhetoric thinking
and

01:01:28.829 --> 01:01:28.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:01:33.309 --> 01:01:33.319 align:start position:0%
communicating um we expect the intent
 
01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:36.119 align:start position:0%
when that this was done was that those
 
01:01:38.309 --> 01:01:38.319 align:start position:0%
areas would be incorporated and embedded
 
01:01:42.589 --> 01:01:42.599 align:start position:0%
into all those 11 other primary areas of
 
01:01:44.510 --> 01:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
learning which are part of the
 
01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity for an adequate
 
01:01:49.589 --> 01:01:49.599 align:start position:0%
education so when we're starting now to
 
01:01:52.789 --> 01:01:52.799 align:start position:0%
write out academic standards
 
01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
for digital literacy so so we've not
 
01:01:57.910 --> 01:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
created academic standard for digital
 
01:01:59.150 --> 01:01:59.160 align:start position:0%
literacy the department doesn't even
 
01:02:00.510 --> 01:02:00.520 align:start position:0%
have the authority to do that that
 
01:02:02.029 --> 01:02:02.039 align:start position:0%
belongs to the State Board of Education
 
01:02:04.109 --> 01:02:04.119 align:start position:0%
so all that we've provided I mean
 
01:02:06.589 --> 01:02:06.599 align:start position:0%
similar to you know the request that we
 
01:02:08.870 --> 01:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
made going back to January last year
 
01:02:12.670 --> 01:02:12.680 align:start position:0%
right that um you know basically rule
 
01:02:15.190 --> 01:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
language to to look at this back
 
01:02:17.190 --> 01:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
language is there kind of best practi
 
01:02:18.349 --> 01:02:18.359 align:start position:0%
are there things that we need to be
 
01:02:20.230 --> 01:02:20.240 align:start position:0%
focused on so we've not made an attempt
 
01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
to establish uh academic standards in
 
01:02:26.269 --> 01:02:26.279 align:start position:0%
these areas we are basically providing
 
01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
some guidelines because otherwise there'
 
01:02:29.870 --> 01:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
be nothing in there at all and again we
 
01:02:31.349 --> 01:02:31.359 align:start position:0%
didn't have academic standards where we
 
01:02:32.910 --> 01:02:32.920 align:start position:0%
had academic standards I'm incorporating
 
01:02:34.029 --> 01:02:34.039 align:start position:0%
in my reference where we don't have
 
01:02:35.549 --> 01:02:35.559 align:start position:0%
academic standards we've tried to keep
 
01:02:37.750 --> 01:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
that language or use language that's
 
01:02:39.309 --> 01:02:39.319 align:start position:0%
already in existence and is being
 
01:02:41.430 --> 01:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
leveraged by
 
01:02:43.390 --> 01:02:43.400 align:start position:0%
individuals and Career Technical
 
01:02:44.950 --> 01:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
education is in another one of these
 
01:02:49.390 --> 01:02:49.400 align:start position:0%
areas which is not identified here 193e
 
01:02:52.150 --> 01:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
however it is a program of study a
 
01:02:53.950 --> 01:02:53.960 align:start position:0%
coures and program of study that leading
 
01:02:55.910 --> 01:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
to Career Pathways and you'll see there
 
01:02:58.549 --> 01:02:58.559 align:start position:0%
used in the old version there was CTE
 
01:02:59.870 --> 01:02:59.880 align:start position:0%
language in the back half that we've
 
01:03:01.390 --> 01:03:01.400 align:start position:0%
incorporated into the front half because
 
01:03:03.230 --> 01:03:03.240 align:start position:0%
part of this exercise was if there's
 
01:03:05.069 --> 01:03:05.079 align:start position:0%
something in the back half that properly
 
01:03:07.230 --> 01:03:07.240 align:start position:0%
belongs in the front half we've moved it
 
01:03:08.589 --> 01:03:08.599 align:start position:0%
up to the front half because that's
 
01:03:10.750 --> 01:03:10.760 align:start position:0%
where it belongs because that was the
 
01:03:14.470 --> 01:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
content of what we were looking at so Mr
 
01:03:17.870 --> 01:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
chair yes um thank you Mr chair and and
 
01:03:20.910 --> 01:03:20.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner so um you were just talking
 
01:03:23.829 --> 01:03:23.839 align:start position:0%
about the uh the business education
 
01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
program and um and so this is
 
01:03:32.710 --> 01:03:32.720 align:start position:0%
formerly the old the existing rule 30633
 
01:03:34.549 --> 01:03:34.559 align:start position:0%
is being replaced with or being proposed
 
01:03:37.589 --> 01:03:37.599 align:start position:0%
to be replaced with proposed Rule
 
01:03:40.710 --> 01:03:40.720 align:start position:0%
30628 and um and you'd mentioned that in
 
01:03:42.510 --> 01:03:42.520 align:start position:0%
the business education program you do
 
01:03:44.789 --> 01:03:44.799 align:start position:0%
not have an academic standard in that
 
01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
pile there for business education that's
 
01:03:50.710 --> 01:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
correct so um so uh What uh what's being
 
01:03:53.670 --> 01:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
done in in uh in proposed rule
 
01:03:57.829 --> 01:03:57.839 align:start position:0%
30628 is um is
 
01:04:00.430 --> 01:04:00.440 align:start position:0%
replacing you know things like you know
 
01:04:01.710 --> 01:04:01.720 align:start position:0%
accredit and business technology
 
01:04:03.069 --> 01:04:03.079 align:start position:0%
application s accompass business
 
01:04:04.430 --> 01:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
technology and work processing
 
01:04:05.789 --> 01:04:05.799 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet development database
 
01:04:08.549 --> 01:04:08.559 align:start position:0%
management presentations and on and on
 
01:04:12.589 --> 01:04:12.599 align:start position:0%
with um with uh with things like um like
 
01:04:14.230 --> 01:04:14.240 align:start position:0%
uh earning income including
 
01:04:15.670 --> 01:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
understanding career paths and potential
 
01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
compensation for career path stuff like
 
01:04:19.870 --> 01:04:19.880 align:start position:0%
that you're saying those aren't academic
 
01:04:23.029 --> 01:04:23.039 align:start position:0%
standards correct these are not academic
 
01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
standards all right so so while in the
 
01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:28.430 align:start position:0%
standards all right so so while in the
arts

01:04:28.430 --> 01:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
arts
 
01:04:31.710 --> 01:04:31.720 align:start position:0%
program you you eliminated all the stuff
 
01:04:33.470 --> 01:04:33.480 align:start position:0%
that was in there and replaced it with a
 
01:04:35.910 --> 01:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
reference to an academic standard
 
01:04:37.750 --> 01:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
because you don't have an academic
 
01:04:39.630 --> 01:04:39.640 align:start position:0%
standard you couldn't do that in the in
 
01:04:42.269 --> 01:04:42.279 align:start position:0%
the business curriculum um but what you
 
01:04:44.710 --> 01:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
replace it with you're saying is not an
 
01:04:46.750 --> 01:04:46.760 align:start position:0%
academic standard right so I mean the
 
01:04:48.109 --> 01:04:48.119 align:start position:0%
process for academic standards those
 
01:04:49.230 --> 01:04:49.240 align:start position:0%
have to go through the State Board of
 
01:04:50.630 --> 01:04:50.640 align:start position:0%
Education these have not gone through
 
01:04:51.910 --> 01:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
the State Board of Education with
 
01:04:53.829 --> 01:04:53.839 align:start position:0%
respect to yeah not as academic
 
01:04:55.990 --> 01:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
standards so we're not proposing
 
01:04:58.190 --> 01:04:58.200 align:start position:0%
academic standards here because we okay
 
01:04:59.870 --> 01:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
so just to be clear just because you
 
01:05:02.470 --> 01:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
don't call them academic standards then
 
01:05:04.109 --> 01:05:04.119 align:start position:0%
they're not academic standards is that
 
01:05:05.990 --> 01:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
my understanding well there's a process
 
01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
for how something becomes an academic
 
01:05:09.150 --> 01:05:09.160 align:start position:0%
standards and these have not gone
 
01:05:11.029 --> 01:05:11.039 align:start position:0%
through the process of becoming academic
 
01:05:13.230 --> 01:05:13.240 align:start position:0%
standards so uh we don't believe that
 
01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:15.880 align:start position:0%
they are but we also because we didn't
 
01:05:18.470 --> 01:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
have anything to make an incorporation
 
01:05:22.710 --> 01:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
by reference doc reference to right um
 
01:05:24.910 --> 01:05:24.920 align:start position:0%
and we didn't want to just eliminate any
 
01:05:27.029 --> 01:05:27.039 align:start position:0%
guidance for our Educators with respect
 
01:05:28.589 --> 01:05:28.599 align:start position:0%
to business education we didn't want to
 
01:05:30.349 --> 01:05:30.359 align:start position:0%
just like leave them in the alerts like
 
01:05:31.829 --> 01:05:31.839 align:start position:0%
sorry there's not an academic standard
 
01:05:32.829 --> 01:05:32.839 align:start position:0%
for business education we don't want to
 
01:05:34.670 --> 01:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
leave you out on your alert so what we
 
01:05:37.630 --> 01:05:37.640 align:start position:0%
did is we've incorporated into this uh
 
01:05:39.950 --> 01:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
you know other content that we think is
 
01:05:42.309 --> 01:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
germine uh you know for them and and
 
01:05:45.430 --> 01:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
useful for them so sure but but in law
 
01:05:47.390 --> 01:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
it says academic standards means what a
 
01:05:49.390 --> 01:05:49.400 align:start position:0%
student should know and be able to do in
 
01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
a course or at each grade level yeah and
 
01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
so is isn't that what you know spending
 
01:05:56.589 --> 01:05:56.599 align:start position:0%
including budgeting consumer decision
 
01:05:58.630 --> 01:05:58.640 align:start position:0%
making federal and state consumer
 
01:06:01.829 --> 01:06:01.839 align:start position:0%
protection laws uh you know AR aren't
 
01:06:04.670 --> 01:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
these academic standards as at least
 
01:06:07.789 --> 01:06:07.799 align:start position:0%
defined by maybe maybe not as defined by
 
01:06:10.069 --> 01:06:10.079 align:start position:0%
the State Board of Ed but defined by
 
01:06:13.069 --> 01:06:13.079 align:start position:0%
Statute uh no I I would 100% not agree
 
01:06:14.510 --> 01:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
with that I mean in other words we're
 
01:06:17.029 --> 01:06:17.039 align:start position:0%
basically just outlining areas of a
 
01:06:18.829 --> 01:06:18.839 align:start position:0%
business education program for our
 
01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
schools like if you're going to do it
 
01:06:23.510 --> 01:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
but it's not we're not as opposed to the
 
01:06:25.789 --> 01:06:25.799 align:start position:0%
difference is if I go to an academic
 
01:06:29.510 --> 01:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
standard over in my Arts education right
 
01:06:32.109 --> 01:06:32.119 align:start position:0%
and so curriculum standard number two
 
01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
identify choreographic principles in
 
01:06:36.269 --> 01:06:36.279 align:start position:0%
grade four students will be able to
 
01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
create a sequence with a beginning
 
01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:39.839 align:start position:0%
middle and end both with and without a
 
01:06:42.349 --> 01:06:42.359 align:start position:0%
rhythmic accompaniment and identify each
 
01:06:44.190 --> 01:06:44.200 align:start position:0%
part of the sequence improvise create
 
01:06:45.870 --> 01:06:45.880 align:start position:0%
perform movements based on their own
 
01:06:49.230 --> 01:06:49.240 align:start position:0%
ideas and ideas from other sources uh
 
01:06:51.870 --> 01:06:51.880 align:start position:0%
use improvision to discover like in
 
01:06:53.430 --> 01:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
other words like academic St are much
 
01:06:57.269 --> 01:06:57.279 align:start position:0%
more uh specific to what and that was
 
01:06:58.430 --> 01:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
for fourth grade and then I've got them
 
01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
for eighth grade and so on these are not
 
01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
these are uh you know a list of again uh
 
01:07:07.589 --> 01:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
borrowed from our CTE programming of
 
01:07:10.150 --> 01:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
Competency areas for these students in a
 
01:07:12.630 --> 01:07:12.640 align:start position:0%
business program but I don't have
 
01:07:14.150 --> 01:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
academic standards and I know that you
 
01:07:16.069 --> 01:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
keep wanting to tether this somehow to
 
01:07:17.390 --> 01:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
standards I'm not sure we're trying to
 
01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
create a system that is supportive of
 
01:07:22.349 --> 01:07:22.359 align:start position:0%
our schools uh in terms of what they're
 
01:07:24.470 --> 01:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
trying to do no I'm not I'm not saying
 
01:07:25.950 --> 01:07:25.960 align:start position:0%
what uh what I want to to do I'm trying
 
01:07:27.630 --> 01:07:27.640 align:start position:0%
to figure out what you're trying to do
 
01:07:30.390 --> 01:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
here and when it comes to um academic
 
01:07:32.069 --> 01:07:32.079 align:start position:0%
standards if academic standards are
 
01:07:34.470 --> 01:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
being changed because um they were not
 
01:07:36.470 --> 01:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
connected with the minimum standards for
 
01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
school approval in the past but are
 
01:07:40.109 --> 01:07:40.119 align:start position:0%
being proposed to be uh to be
 
01:07:42.109 --> 01:07:42.119 align:start position:0%
incorporated then then I consider that
 
01:07:45.069 --> 01:07:45.079 align:start position:0%
to be a change by requiring uh academic
 
01:07:47.950 --> 01:07:47.960 align:start position:0%
standards to be uh to be part of the um
 
01:07:49.829 --> 01:07:49.839 align:start position:0%
the 306 rules where they have it in the
 
01:07:53.069 --> 01:07:53.079 align:start position:0%
past that's all I'm I'm I'm not taking
 
01:07:55.750 --> 01:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
uh taking a position on the content I'm
 
01:08:05.829 --> 01:08:05.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:08.109 --> 01:08:08.119 align:start position:0%
process okay I'd like to just tag in a
 
01:08:09.430 --> 01:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
little bit on this conversation we're
 
01:08:11.150 --> 01:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
having on the on the the business side
 
01:08:16.149 --> 01:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
of things here uh within that uh area of
 
01:08:20.269 --> 01:08:20.279 align:start position:0%
30628 you have an item down
 
01:08:24.990 --> 01:08:25.000 align:start position:0%
below uh that states it's a c under five
 
01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.030 align:start position:0%
below uh that states it's a c under five
um

01:08:26.030 --> 01:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:28.510 --> 01:08:28.520 align:start position:0%
yeah it's hard to see the read each
 
01:08:30.229 --> 01:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
district shall establish and provide
 
01:08:32.269 --> 01:08:32.279 align:start position:0%
competencies and curriculum for personal
 
01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
finance literacy that includes the
 
01:08:37.309 --> 01:08:37.319 align:start position:0%
following content
 
01:08:40.829 --> 01:08:40.839 align:start position:0%
areas Now personal finance literacy has
 
01:08:44.309 --> 01:08:44.319 align:start position:0%
been recently placed in as a criteria
 
01:08:44.319 --> 01:08:45.789 align:start position:0%
been recently placed in as a criteria
within

01:08:45.789 --> 01:08:45.799 align:start position:0%
within
 
01:08:48.309 --> 01:08:48.319 align:start position:0%
adequacy and it was put forth by the New
 
01:08:50.189 --> 01:08:50.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Bankers Association and large
 
01:08:52.910 --> 01:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
groups and signed in a law um and we
 
01:08:55.149 --> 01:08:55.159 align:start position:0%
also say the personal finance literacy
 
01:08:57.950 --> 01:08:57.960 align:start position:0%
uh skills may be embedded in exi an
 
01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
existing course or grade level program
 
01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.070 align:start position:0%
existing course or grade level program
of

01:09:01.070 --> 01:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
studies so this is being treated it's a
 
01:09:07.950 --> 01:09:07.960 align:start position:0%
it's a a criteria that's a part of
 
01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
adequacy but we're saying you might be
 
01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:13.159 align:start position:0%
able to embed this in rather
 
01:09:15.829 --> 01:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
than I'm I'm trying to see okay where
 
01:09:17.669 --> 01:09:17.679 align:start position:0%
are the standards for personal finance
 
01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
literacy we don't have them developed
 
01:09:21.669 --> 01:09:21.679 align:start position:0%
yet do we we do not we have not adopted
 
01:09:23.149 --> 01:09:23.159 align:start position:0%
personal financial litery so now what
 
01:09:24.669 --> 01:09:24.679 align:start position:0%
you're doing is putting some content
 
01:09:26.630 --> 01:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
areas Within personal finance literacy
 
01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:28.030 align:start position:0%
areas Within personal finance literacy
into

01:09:28.030 --> 01:09:28.040 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:09:30.789 --> 01:09:30.799 align:start position:0%
rule so we're basically putting some
 
01:09:32.829 --> 01:09:32.839 align:start position:0%
areas of of personal financial literacy
 
01:09:34.789 --> 01:09:34.799 align:start position:0%
into Rule and I think the expectation
 
01:09:37.030 --> 01:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
would be that as we adopt a personal
 
01:09:38.789 --> 01:09:38.799 align:start position:0%
financial literacy academic standard
 
01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
that this rule would then be subsided by
 
01:09:42.149 --> 01:09:42.159 align:start position:0%
you know you take this out of here and
 
01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
move it over to there but today I don't
 
01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
have that and I don't want to leave
 
01:09:48.669 --> 01:09:48.679 align:start position:0%
schools with no guidance at all so are
 
01:09:51.030 --> 01:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
rules saying that within rule are they
 
01:09:52.910 --> 01:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
saying that you have to take a course in
 
01:09:55.750 --> 01:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
personal finance Literacy for graduation
 
01:09:58.310 --> 01:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
if you go to when in fact we're saying
 
01:10:01.910 --> 01:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
you don't have to it must be embedded in
 
01:10:04.630 --> 01:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
another course the skills and
 
01:10:07.390 --> 01:10:07.400 align:start position:0%
knowledge so we enumerate if you go back
 
01:10:10.550 --> 01:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
to the front half schools are required
 
01:10:13.470 --> 01:10:13.480 align:start position:0%
if I go to probably 22 I'm going to
 
01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
guess is it what it
 
01:10:18.070 --> 01:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
is or
 
01:10:26.790 --> 01:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:28.510 --> 01:10:28.520 align:start position:0%
yeah if you go to page
 
01:10:32.350 --> 01:10:32.360 align:start position:0%
22 uh it lists the course offerings that
 
01:10:34.070 --> 01:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh school districts are required to have
 
01:10:35.350 --> 01:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
the local Schoolboard shall require a
 
01:10:36.390 --> 01:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
program of studies with learning
 
01:10:37.510 --> 01:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
opportunities offered to high school
 
01:10:39.550 --> 01:10:39.560 align:start position:0%
students in the following areas um and
 
01:10:43.110 --> 01:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:47.470 --> 01:10:47.480 align:start position:0%
literacy it's on page 22 of the uh
 
01:10:49.590 --> 01:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
conditional approval
 
01:10:51.950 --> 01:10:51.960 align:start position:0%
request conditional we have not
 
01:10:53.669 --> 01:10:53.679 align:start position:0%
commented on whether that is integrated
 
01:10:55.030 --> 01:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
or not integrated we're just saying that
 
01:10:57.950 --> 01:10:57.960 align:start position:0%
the students in this rule students are
 
01:10:57.960 --> 01:10:59.110 align:start position:0%
the students in this rule students are
required

01:10:59.110 --> 01:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
required
 
01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
to a program of studies with learning
 
01:11:03.149 --> 01:11:03.159 align:start position:0%
opportunities offered in personal
 
01:11:03.159 --> 01:11:13.910 align:start position:0%
opportunities offered in personal
financial

01:11:13.910 --> 01:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:16.510 --> 01:11:16.520 align:start position:0%
literacy on page on the conditional
 
01:11:19.870 --> 01:11:19.880 align:start position:0%
approval process I'm looking at page 29
 
01:11:25.390 --> 01:11:25.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:26.430 --> 01:11:26.440 align:start position:0%
okay so these are the credit
 
01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:27.960 align:start position:0%
requirements for graduation you're
 
01:11:30.189 --> 01:11:30.199 align:start position:0%
saying now that on personal fin on
 
01:11:32.110 --> 01:11:32.120 align:start position:0%
finance literacy you have to have one
 
01:11:33.790 --> 01:11:33.800 align:start position:0%
one half credit but you have to earn the
 
01:11:34.870 --> 01:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
credit but it doesn't mean that you
 
01:11:36.510 --> 01:11:36.520 align:start position:0%
can't earn that credit in an integrated
 
01:11:38.030 --> 01:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
class or something else like that right
 
01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
so we're notating to do it a dual credit
 
01:11:43.470 --> 01:11:43.480 align:start position:0%
or a concurrent credit other words you
 
01:11:45.229 --> 01:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
might be taking it in the form of an
 
01:11:45.239 --> 01:11:46.510 align:start position:0%
might be taking it in the form of an
economics

01:11:46.510 --> 01:11:46.520 align:start position:0%
economics
 
01:11:48.629 --> 01:11:48.639 align:start position:0%
class and you earn a half a credit
 
01:11:50.470 --> 01:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
economics and a half also going to get a
 
01:11:52.470 --> 01:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
half credit if you take that half credit
 
01:11:53.950 --> 01:11:53.960 align:start position:0%
economics class or you're going to get a
 
01:11:55.990 --> 01:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
half credit for finance literacy at the
 
01:11:57.629 --> 01:11:57.639 align:start position:0%
same time again that would be up to our
 
01:11:59.870 --> 01:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
local school districts to design you
 
01:12:01.990 --> 01:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
know course structures the way that they
 
01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
intend them to be incorporated um so
 
01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
that that's I they could do it as an
 
01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
individual class they could do it as a
 
01:12:11.030 --> 01:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
integrated class and and quite frankly
 
01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
that happens even today and we think
 
01:12:13.950 --> 01:12:13.960 align:start position:0%
that integrated education is a great
 
01:12:16.030 --> 01:12:16.040 align:start position:0%
thing um I have schools that offer
 
01:12:19.390 --> 01:12:19.400 align:start position:0%
social studies and Ela classes together
 
01:12:21.590 --> 01:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
um you know to allow students to
 
01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
integrate some of their subjects as
 
01:12:27.390 --> 01:12:27.400 align:start position:0%
well and so integration is not a I'm a
 
01:12:30.189 --> 01:12:30.199 align:start position:0%
fan of integration so those occurrences
 
01:12:32.910 --> 01:12:32.920 align:start position:0%
approved by the department no those
 
01:12:36.070 --> 01:12:36.080 align:start position:0%
areer instead of this economics class is
 
01:12:38.990 --> 01:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
not going to be giving out total of one
 
01:12:40.950 --> 01:12:40.960 align:start position:0%
credit rather than a half credit well I
 
01:12:42.110 --> 01:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
don't know how many credits they'll give
 
01:12:43.510 --> 01:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
out it would be depend on how they
 
01:12:45.350 --> 01:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
structure that class if they structure a
 
01:12:47.070 --> 01:12:47.080 align:start position:0%
half a credit of economics and a half a
 
01:12:48.629 --> 01:12:48.639 align:start position:0%
credit of personal financial literacy
 
01:12:50.510 --> 01:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
then yes it would be a a one credit
 
01:12:52.669 --> 01:12:52.679 align:start position:0%
class but it really is up to the local
 
01:12:54.350 --> 01:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
school districts and how they want to
 
01:12:57.229 --> 01:12:57.239 align:start position:0%
configure those classes in the way that
 
01:12:58.910 --> 01:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
they think it's best for those students
 
01:13:02.149 --> 01:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:04.390 --> 01:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
education but at the end of the day to
 
01:13:06.990 --> 01:13:07.000 align:start position:0%
your point on page 29 in order to
 
01:13:09.470 --> 01:13:09.480 align:start position:0%
graduate from to receive a diploma from
 
01:13:14.830 --> 01:13:14.840 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire uh um you know School uh
 
01:13:16.229 --> 01:13:16.239 align:start position:0%
you're required to have where's my
 
01:13:18.149 --> 01:13:18.159 align:start position:0%
personal financial you have to pass the
 
01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
financial literacy you have to have
 
01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:20.830 align:start position:0%
financial literacy you have to have
financial

01:13:20.830 --> 01:13:20.840 align:start position:0%
financial
 
01:13:22.950 --> 01:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
literacy but what happens to the school
 
01:13:24.669 --> 01:13:24.679 align:start position:0%
board saying well we embedded that
 
01:13:27.149 --> 01:13:27.159 align:start position:0%
personal Finance literacy and some other
 
01:13:28.750 --> 01:13:28.760 align:start position:0%
subject here which we're allowed to do
 
01:13:31.669 --> 01:13:31.679 align:start position:0%
by Statute yep so they're allowed to
 
01:13:34.189 --> 01:13:34.199 align:start position:0%
embed it I mean if the if the
 
01:13:35.629 --> 01:13:35.639 align:start position:0%
legislature wants to change that law and
 
01:13:36.910 --> 01:13:36.920 align:start position:0%
say that it shouldn't be embedded it has
 
01:13:38.750 --> 01:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
to be a standalone course then I'm sure
 
01:13:41.270 --> 01:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
we will all adapt to that as well that's
 
01:13:43.990 --> 01:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
a financial issue it's a it's a
 
01:13:45.750 --> 01:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
determination from this legislature in
 
01:13:47.070 --> 01:13:47.080 align:start position:0%
terms of whether they want I mean again
 
01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
if the statute today allows it to be
 
01:13:50.470 --> 01:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
integrated it can be integrated I don't
 
01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
know that that's a bad thing uh like I I
 
01:13:54.390 --> 01:13:54.400 align:start position:0%
don't I don't immediately integration I
 
01:13:57.510 --> 01:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
don't I don't see as as negative um and
 
01:13:59.110 --> 01:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
I don't want to imply that because it's
 
01:14:03.270 --> 01:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:06.149 --> 01:14:06.159 align:start position:0%
subpar further questions on the back
 
01:14:06.159 --> 01:14:12.030 align:start position:0%
subpar further questions on the back
half

01:14:12.030 --> 01:14:12.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:15.030 --> 01:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
here okay there are no more questions on
 
01:14:16.830 --> 01:14:16.840 align:start position:0%
the back
 
01:14:19.270 --> 01:14:19.280 align:start position:0%
half there are questions I know we have
 
01:14:21.790 --> 01:14:21.800 align:start position:0%
in the first half okay I I will do my
 
01:14:23.790 --> 01:14:23.800 align:start position:0%
best I was not did not come prepared to
 
01:14:26.149 --> 01:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
address the first
 
01:14:30.430 --> 01:14:30.440 align:start position:0%
now the back half that has been approved
 
01:14:34.189 --> 01:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
by the State Board of Education the back
 
01:14:35.629 --> 01:14:35.639 align:start position:0%
half has been approved by the state and
 
01:14:37.669 --> 01:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
the front half as well and the front
 
01:14:38.510 --> 01:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
half as
 
01:14:42.550 --> 01:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
well and neither of those has
 
01:14:45.669 --> 01:14:45.679 align:start position:0%
been given any kind of a uh
 
01:14:47.390 --> 01:14:47.400 align:start position:0%
consideration or well not they've been
 
01:14:49.310 --> 01:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
given consideration but approval by Jael
 
01:14:50.669 --> 01:14:50.679 align:start position:0%
car so we've had a preliminary hearing
 
01:14:52.149 --> 01:14:52.159 align:start position:0%
at Jael car and we've been asked to come
 
01:14:53.390 --> 01:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
back in
 
01:14:55.470 --> 01:14:55.480 align:start position:0%
November with both of them together they
 
01:14:58.270 --> 01:14:58.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to see them all together
 
01:15:00.189 --> 01:15:00.199 align:start position:0%
okay but we also wanted to have an
 
01:15:02.030 --> 01:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to meet with you all are you
 
01:15:06.110 --> 01:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
willing to Wade through us with us the
 
01:15:08.350 --> 01:15:08.360 align:start position:0%
first part a little bit here I I'll do
 
01:15:10.470 --> 01:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
my best I just um you know I may uh
 
01:15:12.510 --> 01:15:12.520 align:start position:0%
defer if I don't have an answer for you
 
01:15:23.950 --> 01:15:23.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:27.790 align:start position:0%
 
there

01:15:27.790 --> 01:15:27.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:31.790 --> 01:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
M um Mr chair yes yeah just a um maybe
 
01:15:33.430 --> 01:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
maybe an area that we could look at on
 
01:15:35.270 --> 01:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
the back half if if that's what the
 
01:15:37.750 --> 01:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner is more prepared for but um
 
01:15:40.310 --> 01:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
I think we talked about it briefly the
 
01:15:43.110 --> 01:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
CTE well well let's let's that's later
 
01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
on let no no that's let's take some of
 
01:15:47.790 --> 01:15:47.800 align:start position:0%
the definitions here first I I would
 
01:15:50.350 --> 01:15:50.360 align:start position:0%
like to discuss the definition of
 
01:15:54.110 --> 01:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
educator okay and the educator what you
 
01:15:55.629 --> 01:15:55.639 align:start position:0%
have here
 
01:15:58.350 --> 01:15:58.360 align:start position:0%
in uh under
 
01:16:00.790 --> 01:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
definitions I don't have page numbers
 
01:16:03.030 --> 01:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
this is I can address it it's not page
 
01:16:06.550 --> 01:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
to and I I will point out um you know
 
01:16:08.510 --> 01:16:08.520 align:start position:0%
representative that uh when we brought
 
01:16:10.189 --> 01:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
this to jeler was pointed out to us we
 
01:16:12.590 --> 01:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
did not know that there was a statutory
 
01:16:15.470 --> 01:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
definition of educator in 21n because we
 
01:16:16.950 --> 01:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
were searching through the education
 
01:16:21.310 --> 01:16:21.320 align:start position:0%
laws not the 21n laws um so we expect
 
01:16:23.350 --> 01:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
that the definition of educator will be
 
01:16:25.950 --> 01:16:25.960 align:start position:0%
homogenized with the with the statutory
 
01:16:27.310 --> 01:16:27.320 align:start position:0%
definition because I mean I think I
 
01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
shared this with you all before our goal
 
01:16:32.629 --> 01:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
is to uh make sure that this has as
 
01:16:34.550 --> 01:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
tight of compliance with the statutes as
 
01:16:36.870 --> 01:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
possible okay why I'm going
 
01:16:39.350 --> 01:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
there I'm looking at that right now so
 
01:16:41.350 --> 01:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
educator means administrators education
 
01:16:42.950 --> 01:16:42.960 align:start position:0%

01:16:46.470 --> 01:16:46.480 align:start position:0%

01:16:54.910 --> 01:16:54.920 align:start position:0%

01:16:56.830 --> 01:16:56.840 align:start position:0%
state board RSA
 
01:17:02.270 --> 01:17:02.280 align:start position:0%
21n a d defines educator as educator
 
01:17:05.110 --> 01:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
means a teacher or
 
01:17:08.149 --> 01:17:08.159 align:start position:0%
certified prayer
 
01:17:08.159 --> 01:17:09.870 align:start position:0%

01:17:09.870 --> 01:17:09.880 align:start position:0%
professional
 
01:17:13.149 --> 01:17:13.159 align:start position:0%
period and then I'm going on and reading
 
01:17:18.990 --> 01:17:19.000 align:start position:0%
RSA 18914 a Roman 5 States teacher means
 
01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:21.880 align:start position:0%
any professional employee of any school
 
01:17:23.910 --> 01:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
district whose position requires
 
01:17:26.430 --> 01:17:26.440 align:start position:0%
certification as a professional engaged
 
01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:28.669 align:start position:0%
certification as a professional engaged
in

01:17:28.669 --> 01:17:28.679 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:17:32.070 --> 01:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
teaching so and and it goes on says the
 
01:17:34.110 --> 01:17:34.120 align:start position:0%
term teacher shall also include
 
01:17:36.470 --> 01:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
principles assist assistant principles
 
01:17:39.709 --> 01:17:39.719 align:start position:0%
Librarians and guidance
 
01:17:42.189 --> 01:17:42.199 align:start position:0%
counselors so just to come in so I think
 
01:17:43.270 --> 01:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
what you've actually just pointed out is
 
01:17:46.470 --> 01:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
that there are the the legislative uh
 
01:17:48.510 --> 01:17:48.520 align:start position:0%
record is not all that clean and easy to
 
01:17:51.830 --> 01:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
understand um again I do believe that uh
 
01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
you know we you know coming out of our
 
01:17:55.030 --> 01:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
first y car meeting that the term
 
01:17:56.910 --> 01:17:56.920 align:start position:0%
educator will just reflect exactly what
 
01:17:59.750 --> 01:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
is in statute um part of the reason why
 
01:18:01.390 --> 01:18:01.400 align:start position:0%
we had a broader definition is because
 
01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
we use the term broadly um so for
 
01:18:05.030 --> 01:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
example if you were to turn over to
 
01:18:08.830 --> 01:18:08.840 align:start position:0%
ed360 you know policy development is
 
01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
individuals responsible for
 
01:18:12.430 --> 01:18:12.440 align:start position:0%
superintendent services or the sh keep
 
01:18:14.590 --> 01:18:14.600 align:start position:0%
students parents and Educators is what
 
01:18:16.870 --> 01:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
we had originally proposed um because it
 
01:18:18.550 --> 01:18:18.560 align:start position:0%
was a broad definition so now what
 
01:18:20.229 --> 01:18:20.239 align:start position:0%
you'll probably see if we change the
 
01:18:22.270 --> 01:18:22.280 align:start position:0%
definition of Educators that will'll
 
01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
have to change there because we don't
 
01:18:26.070 --> 01:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
want the super intend is to just let the
 
01:18:27.350 --> 01:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
teachers and the pair of professionals
 
01:18:29.430 --> 01:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
know about the uh the policies we want
 
01:18:30.870 --> 01:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
everybody to know about it so it will
 
01:18:33.030 --> 01:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
really be expanded to really school and
 
01:18:35.629 --> 01:18:35.639 align:start position:0%
District Personnel more broadly so again
 
01:18:37.709 --> 01:18:37.719 align:start position:0%
try to be efficient um but if there's a
 
01:18:39.149 --> 01:18:39.159 align:start position:0%
statutary definition of educator we
 
01:18:40.790 --> 01:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
certainly want to use that and use it
 
01:18:42.709 --> 01:18:42.719 align:start position:0%
correctly yeah and there's also
 
01:18:45.149 --> 01:18:45.159 align:start position:0%
reference to educator definition in the
 
01:18:47.950 --> 01:18:47.960 align:start position:0%
code of conduct code of ethics which
 
01:18:51.470 --> 01:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
references a section law I couldn't
 
01:18:55.910 --> 01:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
find any rate um so take this issue of
 
01:18:58.950 --> 01:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
educator versus teacher and all that
 
01:19:01.189 --> 01:19:01.199 align:start position:0%
then I went to the section which is
 
01:19:02.790 --> 01:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
01:19:08.790 --> 01:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
the um ratio in the classroom size Etc
 
01:19:10.390 --> 01:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to find out that section
 
01:19:11.990 --> 01:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
right here
 
01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:16.189 align:start position:0%
right here
now

01:19:16.189 --> 01:19:16.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:16.199 --> 01:19:18.990 align:start position:0%
 
30614

01:19:18.990 --> 01:19:19.000 align:start position:0%
30614
 
01:19:40.709 --> 01:19:40.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:43.510 --> 01:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
yeah 30614 where it says the joint
 
01:19:47.149 --> 01:19:47.159 align:start position:0%
legislative committee wa minute educator
 
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
ratios um when we develop the costing
 
01:19:55.070 --> 01:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
for an adequate education we we didn't
 
01:19:58.390 --> 01:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
use this term student educator ratio we
 
01:20:02.669 --> 01:20:02.679 align:start position:0%
used the term student teacher
 
01:20:02.679 --> 01:20:05.030 align:start position:0%
used the term student teacher
ratio

01:20:05.030 --> 01:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
ratio
 
01:20:08.830 --> 01:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
um and we set up the class sizes you
 
01:20:11.709 --> 01:20:11.719 align:start position:0%
know K through two
 
01:20:14.149 --> 01:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
25:1 and the rule says hopefully we can
 
01:20:16.510 --> 01:20:16.520 align:start position:0%
get that down to 20 to1 and then grades
 
01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:17.669 align:start position:0%
get that down to 20 to1 and then grades
three

01:20:17.669 --> 01:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:20:22.990 --> 01:20:23.000 align:start position:0%
through 12 30 to1 um when when we get
 
01:20:25.149 --> 01:20:25.159 align:start position:0%
the definition there of student student
 
01:20:28.870 --> 01:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
educator ratios vers student teacher
 
01:20:31.750 --> 01:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
ratios which are licensed and
 
01:20:35.390 --> 01:20:35.400 align:start position:0%
certified are we opening this up to more
 
01:20:38.350 --> 01:20:38.360 align:start position:0%
than just the certified teacher yeah so
 
01:20:39.990 --> 01:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
I think that and so this is a question
 
01:20:41.830 --> 01:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
that was raised at jelar as well and I'm
 
01:20:44.189 --> 01:20:44.199 align:start position:0%
happy to kind of address it we think
 
01:20:46.310 --> 01:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
that the framework that we had
 
01:20:49.590 --> 01:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
established already required that but
 
01:20:51.510 --> 01:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
part of the definition update for
 
01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
educator will make sure that it's very
 
01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
clear but if you turn back act to
 
01:20:59.270 --> 01:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
30612 to carry out the educational
 
01:21:01.229 --> 01:21:01.239 align:start position:0%
program The Local School Board shall
 
01:21:03.590 --> 01:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
require that each school provides and
 
01:21:06.669 --> 01:21:06.679 align:start position:0%
under three for the hiring training of
 
01:21:11.070 --> 01:21:11.080 align:start position:0%
Educators as defined now in uh as a uh
 
01:21:14.310 --> 01:21:14.320 align:start position:0%
you know in in 21n of Educators licensed
 
01:21:17.390 --> 01:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
under ed500 to facilitate learning to
 
01:21:19.629 --> 01:21:19.639 align:start position:0%
their credential content area or as
 
01:21:21.510 --> 01:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
assigned by the superintendent and so
 
01:21:22.910 --> 01:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
some have said well because that
 
01:21:25.390 --> 01:21:25.400 align:start position:0%
definition of educator includes a
 
01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
teacher and a paraprofessional our
 
01:21:28.830 --> 01:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
school board's going to be able to put a
 
01:21:30.590 --> 01:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
paraprofessional in charge of the math
 
01:21:32.629 --> 01:21:32.639 align:start position:0%
class but in fact if you read this it
 
01:21:34.229 --> 01:21:34.239 align:start position:0%
says they have to be licensed in the
 
01:21:36.590 --> 01:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
content area so that is not we don't
 
01:21:39.390 --> 01:21:39.400 align:start position:0%
believe that that is permissible under
 
01:21:42.030 --> 01:21:42.040 align:start position:0%
this rule as it is constructed you can't
 
01:21:44.189 --> 01:21:44.199 align:start position:0%
just stick anybody because they're a
 
01:21:46.270 --> 01:21:46.280 align:start position:0%
quote unquote educator other than minor
 
01:21:48.790 --> 01:21:48.800 align:start position:0%
assignments into those roles and so we
 
01:21:52.990 --> 01:21:53.000 align:start position:0%
do think that it is a system uh that is
 
01:21:57.990 --> 01:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
cohesive and osed in the sense of the uh
 
01:22:00.070 --> 01:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
the the concern that has been raised we
 
01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
don't you know again and and we think
 
01:22:03.910 --> 01:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
we've gone even beyond that we didn't
 
01:22:05.189 --> 01:22:05.199 align:start position:0%
think we had to change the definition of
 
01:22:07.149 --> 01:22:07.159 align:start position:0%
educator other than match the statute we
 
01:22:08.669 --> 01:22:08.679 align:start position:0%
think that before it was a cohesive
 
01:22:10.550 --> 01:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
enclosed system but by changing the
 
01:22:12.390 --> 01:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
definition of educator it even makes it
 
01:22:15.110 --> 01:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
more clear that this is a closed and
 
01:22:18.189 --> 01:22:18.199 align:start position:0%
cohesive system that requires as three
 
01:22:20.030 --> 01:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
states that we have Educators that are
 
01:22:22.870 --> 01:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
licensed under ed500 for the learning
 
01:22:25.110 --> 01:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
that takes place in that Ed educational
 
01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
program see in in 21n col 8D which we've
 
01:22:32.030 --> 01:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
referenced already today y it doesn't
 
01:22:33.990 --> 01:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
say just par professional it says
 
01:22:36.189 --> 01:22:36.199 align:start position:0%
certified PA professional certified par
 
01:22:37.350 --> 01:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
profession but they would have to be
 
01:22:38.870 --> 01:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
certified right so it does you could not
 
01:22:40.629 --> 01:22:40.639 align:start position:0%
only could you not put just any par
 
01:22:41.350 --> 01:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
professional would have to be a
 
01:22:44.229 --> 01:22:44.239 align:start position:0%
certified but par professionals are not
 
01:22:47.149 --> 01:22:47.159 align:start position:0%
certified to car to facilitate the
 
01:22:49.590 --> 01:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
learning in a credential content area
 
01:22:51.790 --> 01:22:51.800 align:start position:0%
like what is the remember if you look at
 
01:22:54.790 --> 01:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
30612 A3
 
01:22:58.390 --> 01:22:58.400 align:start position:0%
uh it says that they hold the Educators
 
01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:00.719 align:start position:0%
licensed under ed500 to facilitate
 
01:23:02.950 --> 01:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
learning in their credentialed content
 
01:23:05.189 --> 01:23:05.199 align:start position:0%
area I could not sit here today and tell
 
01:23:08.709 --> 01:23:08.719 align:start position:0%
you what the credentialed content area
 
01:23:11.189 --> 01:23:11.199 align:start position:0%
of a paraprofessional is right like it
 
01:23:13.350 --> 01:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
would not be any of the content areas
 
01:23:15.910 --> 01:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
that we've just reviewed so I I that's
 
01:23:17.910 --> 01:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
why I think that this is again a
 
01:23:21.110 --> 01:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
cohesive and a closed system so looking
 
01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
at the definition of educator that we
 
01:23:26.790 --> 01:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
have proposed in rule here vers and also
 
01:23:30.189 --> 01:23:30.199 align:start position:0%
when we come down this ratio area does
 
01:23:33.390 --> 01:23:33.400 align:start position:0%
there have to be more of a tie in and so
 
01:23:35.870 --> 01:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
is there confusion here now as to when
 
01:23:40.229 --> 01:23:40.239 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the pupil educator
 
01:23:40.239 --> 01:23:42.430 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the pupil educator
ratio

01:23:42.430 --> 01:23:42.440 align:start position:0%
ratio
 
01:23:45.310 --> 01:23:45.320 align:start position:0%
um are we including non-certified people
 
01:23:47.229 --> 01:23:47.239 align:start position:0%
in that ratio we're not because if you
 
01:23:55.110 --> 01:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:57.870 --> 01:23:57.880 align:start position:0%
in that credential content area right
 
01:24:00.430 --> 01:24:00.440 align:start position:0%
you can't just stick anybody in there
 
01:24:02.030 --> 01:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
just because you want to we don't
 
01:24:03.790 --> 01:24:03.800 align:start position:0%
believe that's our understanding of how
 
01:24:05.590 --> 01:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:24:07.669 --> 01:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
developed and I think I'm being very
 
01:24:09.030 --> 01:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
clear about that because I know that
 
01:24:10.430 --> 01:24:10.440 align:start position:0%
there are Skeptics of that but I think
 
01:24:12.990 --> 01:24:13.000 align:start position:0%
that that those words are very specific
 
01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
and very
 
01:24:18.149 --> 01:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
clear it's confusing play I I was I was
 
01:24:20.390 --> 01:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
looking at the code of ethics a code of
 
01:24:23.149 --> 01:24:23.159 align:start position:0%
conduct and defines Educators any
 
01:24:25.070 --> 01:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
professional employee of any school
 
01:24:26.470 --> 01:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
district whose position requires
 
01:24:27.950 --> 01:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
certification by the State Board of
 
01:24:31.750 --> 01:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
Education pursuant to RSA
 
01:24:34.229 --> 01:24:34.239 align:start position:0%
18939 um that speaks to administrator
 
01:24:35.830 --> 01:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
Specialists and
 
01:24:38.470 --> 01:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
teachers and that that's so that's a
 
01:24:39.910 --> 01:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
different Rule and it has a different
 
01:24:42.149 --> 01:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
context the little green book yeah it's
 
01:24:44.350 --> 01:24:44.360 align:start position:0%
educator misconduct and and so I'm not
 
01:24:46.950 --> 01:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
sure so that needs to be updated because
 
01:24:49.109 --> 01:24:49.119 align:start position:0%
we updated the rues yeah U well maybe
 
01:24:52.709 --> 01:24:52.719 align:start position:0%
not so um that definition is used in the
 
01:24:54.990 --> 01:24:55.000 align:start position:0%
cont context of misconduct we would not
 
01:24:58.229 --> 01:24:58.239 align:start position:0%
want to use a 21n definition in that
 
01:25:01.030 --> 01:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
because it's not uncommon for us to have
 
01:25:03.990 --> 01:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
educator misconduct actions against
 
01:25:06.510 --> 01:25:06.520 align:start position:0%
administrators against superintendents
 
01:25:07.870 --> 01:25:07.880 align:start position:0%
or something right and so we want to
 
01:25:09.709 --> 01:25:09.719 align:start position:0%
make sure that they that code of conduct
 
01:25:12.109 --> 01:25:12.119 align:start position:0%
applies to them and not just to teachers
 
01:25:14.709 --> 01:25:14.719 align:start position:0%
and certified par professionals but I
 
01:25:16.430 --> 01:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
mean that's a separate issue that I'm
 
01:25:18.709 --> 01:25:18.719 align:start position:0%
happy to take up separately but that
 
01:25:21.149 --> 01:25:21.159 align:start position:0%
definition is not cond this definition
 
01:25:24.470 --> 01:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
if somebody's not behaving well they
 
01:25:25.950 --> 01:25:25.960 align:start position:0%
lose their ticket they lose their
 
01:25:27.669 --> 01:25:27.679 align:start position:0%
certification well it depends on what
 
01:25:29.830 --> 01:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
happens but that's the outcome you can
 
01:25:33.350 --> 01:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
have in the various categories there but
 
01:25:35.950 --> 01:25:35.960 align:start position:0%
in dealing with this I'm concerned with
 
01:25:38.109 --> 01:25:38.119 align:start position:0%
the pupil teacher
 
01:25:40.030 --> 01:25:40.040 align:start position:0%
ratio we appreciate that we've heard
 
01:25:42.750 --> 01:25:42.760 align:start position:0%
feedback on that we we think that we've
 
01:25:45.390 --> 01:25:45.400 align:start position:0%
we don't believe that it's a problem uh
 
01:25:47.470 --> 01:25:47.480 align:start position:0%
we have updated the definition and made
 
01:25:49.669 --> 01:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
the respective changes to be able to
 
01:25:51.390 --> 01:25:51.400 align:start position:0%
make sure that that's quite clear of
 
01:25:53.990 --> 01:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
what the requirements are uh so when we
 
01:25:58.310 --> 01:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
went the inputs back in 2008 in
 
01:26:01.550 --> 01:26:01.560 align:start position:0%
the commission or the committee for the
 
01:26:03.390 --> 01:26:03.400 align:start position:0%
joint legislative committee for the
 
01:26:06.430 --> 01:26:06.440 align:start position:0%
development of costing of an adequate
 
01:26:09.510 --> 01:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
education we have it very specifically
 
01:26:11.629 --> 01:26:11.639 align:start position:0%
defined in that and that's how we're
 
01:26:14.270 --> 01:26:14.280 align:start position:0%
basing our funding formula right now off
 
01:26:16.669 --> 01:26:16.679 align:start position:0%
that unless it somehow changes from that
 
01:26:22.830 --> 01:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
end the table um that it
 
01:26:28.790 --> 01:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
specifies pupil teacher ratio for class
 
01:26:32.070 --> 01:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
size and so I I don't want to get into a
 
01:26:36.109 --> 01:26:36.119 align:start position:0%
situation here where we're putting in
 
01:26:38.390 --> 01:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
non-licensed people as part of this
 
01:26:42.669 --> 01:26:42.679 align:start position:0%
education ratio and our ratio is really
 
01:26:45.189 --> 01:26:45.199 align:start position:0%
not what we need in order to accomplish
 
01:26:47.229 --> 01:26:47.239 align:start position:0%
the job of a certified staff member in
 
01:26:48.950 --> 01:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
the classroom understand and I'm happy
 
01:26:50.270 --> 01:26:50.280 align:start position:0%
to take this back because as you know
 
01:26:51.550 --> 01:26:51.560 align:start position:0%
that there are several litigations that
 
01:26:53.830 --> 01:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
are taking place with respect to that um
 
01:26:55.510 --> 01:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
I do believe the that the Department of
 
01:26:56.830 --> 01:26:56.840 align:start position:0%
Justice has taken a look at this
 
01:26:58.189 --> 01:26:58.199 align:start position:0%
language but I'm happy to bring that
 
01:27:03.070 --> 01:27:03.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:05.550 --> 01:27:05.560 align:start position:0%
good I'm just scanning through some of
 
01:27:07.109 --> 01:27:07.119 align:start position:0%
my yellow marks and I just I guess I
 
01:27:08.270 --> 01:27:08.280 align:start position:0%
also just want to put on the record
 
01:27:10.470 --> 01:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
clearly that uh well the the legisl did
 
01:27:12.109 --> 01:27:12.119 align:start position:0%
a variety of different analyses with
 
01:27:13.709 --> 01:27:13.719 align:start position:0%
respect to the cost of an adequate
 
01:27:16.870 --> 01:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
education um you know that how that
 
01:27:19.070 --> 01:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
amount is determined as a legislative
 
01:27:20.590 --> 01:27:20.600 align:start position:0%
you know issue not one for the
 
01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:25.629 align:start position:0%
you know issue not one for the
Department

01:27:25.629 --> 01:27:25.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:27.229 --> 01:27:27.239 align:start position:0%
there's another
 
01:27:29.709 --> 01:27:29.719 align:start position:0%
area when we're looking at Career
 
01:27:29.719 --> 01:27:32.070 align:start position:0%
area when we're looking at Career
Technical

01:27:32.070 --> 01:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
Technical
 
01:27:36.470 --> 01:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
education um page is that page 13 Ed
 
01:27:38.590 --> 01:27:38.600 align:start position:0%
30616 and I think I don't have numbers
 
01:27:41.830 --> 01:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
on I'm dealing with I got initially from
 
01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:43.590 align:start position:0%
on I'm dealing with I got initially from
Jen

01:27:43.590 --> 01:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
Jen
 
01:27:46.550 --> 01:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
um let me go back and find another so
 
01:27:49.310 --> 01:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
30616 CTE programs do you know what page
 
01:27:54.950 --> 01:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:58.390 --> 01:27:58.400 align:start position:0%
with page 30 the side by side
 
01:28:06.030 --> 01:28:06.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:09.669 --> 01:28:09.679 align:start position:0%
see this is under policy
 
01:28:11.430 --> 01:28:11.440 align:start position:0%
development that's that would be
 
01:28:13.430 --> 01:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
somewhere else that's over in 306.000 I
 
01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
believe so that's right it's going back
 
01:28:19.070 --> 01:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
to 306.000 4 policy development okay and
 
01:28:24.910 --> 01:28:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:26.390 --> 01:28:26.400 align:start position:0%
got a lot of
 
01:28:29.870 --> 01:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
policies 21 basic learning
 
01:28:31.750 --> 01:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
standards okay
 
01:28:34.149 --> 01:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
include how students can pursue various
 
01:28:35.990 --> 01:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
learning opportunities
 
01:28:38.310 --> 01:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
including um it talks about dual
 
01:28:39.910 --> 01:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
concurrent enrollment and Career
 
01:28:42.990 --> 01:28:43.000 align:start position:0%
Technical education and
 
01:28:46.629 --> 01:28:46.639 align:start position:0%
certification um for some
 
01:28:53.550 --> 01:28:53.560 align:start position:0%
reason I hit I I have RSA 188 e colon 25
 
01:28:55.310 --> 01:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
as yell out there I'm trying to figure
 
01:28:59.790 --> 01:28:59.800 align:start position:0%
out going back see number three go back
 
01:29:06.950 --> 01:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:15.189 --> 01:29:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:17.910 --> 01:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
reference and but the one right below it
 
01:29:19.950 --> 01:29:19.960 align:start position:0%
too it says uh dual and concurrent
 
01:29:24.430 --> 01:29:24.440 align:start position:0%
enrollment in college courses
 
01:29:26.270 --> 01:29:26.280 align:start position:0%
that's also in high
 
01:29:29.030 --> 01:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
school concurrent is high
 
01:29:32.310 --> 01:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
school taught by High School staff yes
 
01:29:33.629 --> 01:29:33.639 align:start position:0%
so we were just referring to the fact
 
01:29:36.149 --> 01:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
that duel and concurrent are when a
 
01:29:38.470 --> 01:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
student is receiving postsecondary
 
01:29:40.590 --> 01:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
Credit in their high schools or they're
 
01:29:42.790 --> 01:29:42.800 align:start position:0%
accessing those post-secondary courses
 
01:29:45.229 --> 01:29:45.239 align:start position:0%
directly so you have both dual as well
 
01:29:47.510 --> 01:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
as the concurrent and and to your point
 
01:29:49.870 --> 01:29:49.880 align:start position:0%
the concurrent is relative to earning
 
01:29:51.390 --> 01:29:51.400 align:start position:0%
those College it's a college it becomes
 
01:29:53.430 --> 01:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
a college course at that point so they
 
01:29:54.990 --> 01:29:55.000 align:start position:0%
earn high school credit as well as
 
01:29:55.000 --> 01:30:00.550 align:start position:0%
earn high school credit as well as
postsecondary

01:30:00.550 --> 01:30:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:02.790 --> 01:30:02.800 align:start position:0%
credit and again this is a section in
 
01:30:04.189 --> 01:30:04.199 align:start position:0%
the section we're just asking that the
 
01:30:05.990 --> 01:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
schools Define a policy for how those
 
01:30:11.430 --> 01:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:19.149 --> 01:30:19.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:21.270 --> 01:30:21.280 align:start position:0%
facilities it says the local school
 
01:30:23.229 --> 01:30:23.239 align:start position:0%
board shall require that the facilities
 
01:30:25.310 --> 01:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
operated by the school district for K
 
01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:27.870 align:start position:0%
operated by the school district for K
through

01:30:27.870 --> 01:30:27.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:33.030 --> 01:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
12 then when I go down and look
 
01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:36.109 align:start position:0%
12 then when I go down and look
at

01:30:36.109 --> 01:30:36.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:40.870 --> 01:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
30610 we talk about prek through
 
01:30:44.390 --> 01:30:44.400 align:start position:0%
12 so in one case we're calling it K12
 
01:30:45.990 --> 01:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
another place we're calling it prek
 
01:30:48.510 --> 01:30:48.520 align:start position:0%
through 12 so I can go check and see
 
01:30:50.229 --> 01:30:50.239 align:start position:0%
what if because we're referencing the Ed
 
01:30:52.310 --> 01:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
320 rules and so we have to determine if
 
01:30:53.950 --> 01:30:53.960 align:start position:0%
the Ed 320 rules would incorporate the
 
01:30:56.709 --> 01:30:56.719 align:start position:0%
PRK or not um but if that's if if it
 
01:31:00.550 --> 01:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
needs to be prek P like pre PK to 12
 
01:31:02.550 --> 01:31:02.560 align:start position:0%
then we can uh you know work on that as
 
01:31:04.229 --> 01:31:04.239 align:start position:0%
well I think that's potenti do you have
 
01:31:05.510 --> 01:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
a question on well I was just going to
 
01:31:08.390 --> 01:31:08.400 align:start position:0%
say in Ed 3610 is what you're referring
 
01:31:09.870 --> 01:31:09.880 align:start position:0%
to food and
 
01:31:12.990 --> 01:31:13.000 align:start position:0%
nutrition with the p prek i I believe
 
01:31:15.790 --> 01:31:15.800 align:start position:0%
that specifically because of referencing
 
01:31:17.430 --> 01:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
nutrition and all that it has to include
 
01:31:20.070 --> 01:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
the preschool and um so that's why
 
01:31:21.870 --> 01:31:21.880 align:start position:0%
that's there in that section because if
 
01:31:23.430 --> 01:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
they do have preschool they have to be
 
01:31:25.030 --> 01:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
included in that for the food and
 
01:31:26.709 --> 01:31:26.719 align:start position:0%
nutrition and some of that's driven by
 
01:31:28.590 --> 01:31:28.600 align:start position:0%
USDA regulations like if they're running
 
01:31:30.270 --> 01:31:30.280 align:start position:0%
a prek opportunity and they have a
 
01:31:31.510 --> 01:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
certain amount of time they're required
 
01:31:34.229 --> 01:31:34.239 align:start position:0%
to offer a meal or a snack time over a
 
01:31:41.669 --> 01:31:41.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:44.390 --> 01:31:44.400 align:start position:0%
time K8
 
01:31:48.990 --> 01:31:49.000 align:start position:0%
30610 is where I went next um it says
 
01:31:50.550 --> 01:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of this rule students
 
01:31:52.310 --> 01:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
under jurisdiction of a school shall
 
01:31:54.229 --> 01:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
include all students enrolled in
 
01:31:56.430 --> 01:31:56.440 align:start position:0%
preschool or kindergarten within a
 
01:31:59.030 --> 01:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
building controlled by the school
 
01:32:01.510 --> 01:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
district what's the definition of
 
01:32:03.229 --> 01:32:03.239 align:start position:0%
controlled um so I think the we're
 
01:32:04.709 --> 01:32:04.719 align:start position:0%
referring there is that we do have some
 
01:32:06.990 --> 01:32:07.000 align:start position:0%
schools who have uh prek programs that
 
01:32:09.510 --> 01:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
are uh you know the build it might be a
 
01:32:11.910 --> 01:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
separate building and it might even be
 
01:32:14.990 --> 01:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
operated under a contract for the school
 
01:32:16.229 --> 01:32:16.239 align:start position:0%
so we want to make sure that we're not
 
01:32:16.239 --> 01:32:18.350 align:start position:0%
so we want to make sure that we're not
excluding

01:32:18.350 --> 01:32:18.360 align:start position:0%
excluding
 
01:32:20.310 --> 01:32:20.320 align:start position:0%
that and we're basically trying to tell
 
01:32:21.270 --> 01:32:21.280 align:start position:0%
them that they still have some
 
01:32:25.750 --> 01:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:28.149 --> 01:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
does the word controlled really say what
 
01:32:30.510 --> 01:32:30.520 align:start position:0%
you just said
 
01:32:34.910 --> 01:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
uh cont okay and again there's a lot of
 
01:32:36.550 --> 01:32:36.560 align:start position:0%
configurations for those programs they
 
01:32:38.910 --> 01:32:38.920 align:start position:0%
don't always look the same so yeah I
 
01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:50.390 align:start position:0%
don't always look the same so yeah I
know

01:32:50.390 --> 01:32:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:53.629 --> 01:32:53.639 align:start position:0%
it and there was one area in Sciences
 
01:32:55.709 --> 01:32:55.719 align:start position:0%
where where we had lab sciences and we
 
01:33:00.790 --> 01:33:00.800 align:start position:0%
had a rule before due to safety that we
 
01:33:03.430 --> 01:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
didn't want any labs having more than 24
 
01:33:06.750 --> 01:33:06.760 align:start position:0%
to one in it and that part was taken out
 
01:33:09.149 --> 01:33:09.159 align:start position:0%
of rule do you know why that was taken
 
01:33:12.870 --> 01:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
out um so that essentially and we looked
 
01:33:14.910 --> 01:33:14.920 align:start position:0%
at that through a CTE lens as well as
 
01:33:17.229 --> 01:33:17.239 align:start position:0%
far as like lab um so there's going to
 
01:33:19.189 --> 01:33:19.199 align:start position:0%
be building standards in terms of the
 
01:33:21.149 --> 01:33:21.159 align:start position:0%
station so rather than specifying the
 
01:33:22.990 --> 01:33:23.000 align:start position:0%
number of students the safety
 
01:33:24.310 --> 01:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
requirements were
 
01:33:26.950 --> 01:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
to only have as many students as there
 
01:33:29.189 --> 01:33:29.199 align:start position:0%
were stations in order of safety so
 
01:33:31.510 --> 01:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
those numbers are still going to be the
 
01:33:33.990 --> 01:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
same based on how those stations were
 
01:33:36.950 --> 01:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
built out um well the old rule had that
 
01:33:37.950 --> 01:33:37.960 align:start position:0%
in it
 
01:33:41.149 --> 01:33:41.159 align:start position:0%
too it it did said you had have the
 
01:33:43.390 --> 01:33:43.400 align:start position:0%
facility available to teach the kids
 
01:33:46.470 --> 01:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
which are in that but they also are
 
01:33:48.950 --> 01:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
saying that the supervision I I'm I'm
 
01:33:50.510 --> 01:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
now this is what I'm interpreting from
 
01:33:53.870 --> 01:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
it that the teacher that has to respon
 
01:33:55.750 --> 01:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
ability for a
 
01:34:01.149 --> 01:34:01.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:04.990 --> 01:34:05.000 align:start position:0%
it I mean this is hold
 
01:34:07.430 --> 01:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
on that was I I can go back and take a
 
01:34:09.030 --> 01:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
look at that I think that that is in the
 
01:34:11.350 --> 01:34:11.360 align:start position:0%
320s now I'd have to ask Amy to that
 
01:34:24.270 --> 01:34:24.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:26.390 --> 01:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
yeah it says right here in no cases
 
01:34:27.629 --> 01:34:27.639 align:start position:0%
shall the number of students in
 
01:34:30.310 --> 01:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
laboratory classes exceed 24 that's in
 
01:34:34.990 --> 01:34:35.000 align:start position:0%
current rule that's not in the change
 
01:34:37.629 --> 01:34:37.639 align:start position:0%
that you have that's in the existing
 
01:34:39.990 --> 01:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
rule that's an existing rule yes yeah so
 
01:34:41.390 --> 01:34:41.400 align:start position:0%
I'd have to go see what we carried over
 
01:34:43.390 --> 01:34:43.400 align:start position:0%
to 320 but I do know that one of the
 
01:34:45.310 --> 01:34:45.320 align:start position:0%
issues as Amy was trying to work towards
 
01:34:47.430 --> 01:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
is that we have some schools that have
 
01:34:49.270 --> 01:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
larger lab spaces and trying to make
 
01:34:51.350 --> 01:34:51.360 align:start position:0%
sure that we accommodate those as well
 
01:34:53.390 --> 01:34:53.400 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure what she's done relative
 
01:35:02.430 --> 01:35:02.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:05.590 --> 01:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
okay okay the last one I had well not I
 
01:35:07.070 --> 01:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
don't know if this the last yellow Mark
 
01:35:11.830 --> 01:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:14.669 --> 01:35:14.679 align:start position:0%
30619 oh
 
01:35:24.990 --> 01:35:25.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:28.830 --> 01:35:28.840 align:start position:0%
it has a c underneath there I don't have
 
01:35:31.390 --> 01:35:31.400 align:start position:0%
the page number I apologize for
 
01:35:35.550 --> 01:35:35.560 align:start position:0%
that it says CTE Cooperative agreements
 
01:35:37.910 --> 01:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
shall require the sending and receiving
 
01:35:39.550 --> 01:35:39.560 align:start position:0%
school districts to coordinate calendars
 
01:35:41.910 --> 01:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
and schedules to maximize students
 
01:35:46.550 --> 01:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
access to CTE program pursuant 2 Ed
 
01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
1304 we now have which we put in the law
 
01:35:52.910 --> 01:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
several years ago and we're nearing the
 
01:35:54.830 --> 01:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
point where they they got to comply with
 
01:35:57.109 --> 01:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
that a regional Career Technical
 
01:35:59.350 --> 01:35:59.360 align:start position:0%
education agreements shall require the
 
01:36:01.070 --> 01:36:01.080 align:start position:0%
sending the receiving school districts
 
01:36:03.790 --> 01:36:03.800 align:start position:0%
to coordinate calendars and schedule to
 
01:36:06.390 --> 01:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
maximize student access to CTE programs
 
01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:08.229 align:start position:0%
maximize student access to CTE programs
pursuant

01:36:08.229 --> 01:36:08.239 align:start position:0%
pursuant
 
01:36:14.310 --> 01:36:14.320 align:start position:0%
to 134.0 2 and in compliance with RSA
 
01:36:19.629 --> 01:36:19.639 align:start position:0%
1881 a Roman 3 should we not put in that
 
01:36:22.510 --> 01:36:22.520 align:start position:0%
we have that in law right now where you
 
01:36:24.270 --> 01:36:24.280 align:start position:0%
can only you we don't want them having
 
01:36:27.390 --> 01:36:27.400 align:start position:0%
more than 10 non-aligned days so so we
 
01:36:28.750 --> 01:36:28.760 align:start position:0%
can do that I I do believe that the
 
01:36:30.590 --> 01:36:30.600 align:start position:0%
statute's referenced in the
 
01:36:33.629 --> 01:36:33.639 align:start position:0%
13042 and does that that does that have
 
01:36:36.270 --> 01:36:36.280 align:start position:0%
this language that we have in statute
 
01:36:38.350 --> 01:36:38.360 align:start position:0%
yes that rule is much more specific and
 
01:36:40.750 --> 01:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
detailed as to the actual Regional CTE
 
01:36:42.109 --> 01:36:42.119 align:start position:0%
agreements we brought those rules
 
01:36:44.790 --> 01:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
forward last year when the law came into
 
01:36:47.149 --> 01:36:47.159 align:start position:0%
effect so that law has been incorporated
 
01:36:48.790 --> 01:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
into those
 
01:36:52.229 --> 01:36:52.239 align:start position:0%
rules like the change that you made yeah
 
01:36:54.189 --> 01:36:54.199 align:start position:0%
and then we're just referencing to Rule
 
01:36:56.990 --> 01:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
and the commissioner can give waivers
 
01:36:58.590 --> 01:36:58.600 align:start position:0%
for about another year and then there's
 
01:36:59.750 --> 01:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
no more
 
01:37:02.950 --> 01:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
waivers and we'll be asking where are we
 
01:37:04.910 --> 01:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
on this how many waivers did I grant no
 
01:37:07.629 --> 01:37:07.639 align:start position:0%
not how many waivers how many are out of
 
01:37:09.950 --> 01:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
compliance because in another year they
 
01:37:11.149 --> 01:37:11.159 align:start position:0%
won't be in
 
01:37:13.990 --> 01:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
compliance well I mean actually I I'm
 
01:37:15.790 --> 01:37:15.800 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping and I know that there's a you
 
01:37:17.910 --> 01:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
know a lot of emphasis placed on the
 
01:37:19.910 --> 01:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
importance of making sure that we are
 
01:37:21.750 --> 01:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
homogenizing calendars and schedule so
 
01:37:24.350 --> 01:37:24.360 align:start position:0%
that students can get access to the
 
01:37:26.430 --> 01:37:26.440 align:start position:0%
programming I mean I think as you know
 
01:37:28.189 --> 01:37:28.199 align:start position:0%
that that's a priority of
 
01:37:30.629 --> 01:37:30.639 align:start position:0%
mine yeah I think it's very much a
 
01:37:34.270 --> 01:37:34.280 align:start position:0%
priority of mine as well um see I'm help
 
01:37:38.830 --> 01:37:38.840 align:start position:0%
write that law um so that's all I have
 
01:37:42.310 --> 01:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
repr luno thank you Mr chair on the
 
01:37:45.870 --> 01:37:45.880 align:start position:0%
subject of CTE do um do all the CTE
 
01:37:47.669 --> 01:37:47.679 align:start position:0%
programs that are offered throughout the
 
01:37:52.390 --> 01:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
state today um have a third- party um uh
 
01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:55.430 align:start position:0%
state today um have a third- party um uh
assessment

01:37:55.430 --> 01:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:57.790 --> 01:37:57.800 align:start position:0%
um so it depends on the area so when you
 
01:37:58.790 --> 01:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
say I'm not sure I know what you're
 
01:38:00.669 --> 01:38:00.679 align:start position:0%
talking about yeah so talking about for
 
01:38:02.510 --> 01:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
certificates well because it's really
 
01:38:04.430 --> 01:38:04.440 align:start position:0%
based on program not the whole I'm
 
01:38:06.629 --> 01:38:06.639 align:start position:0%
actually I'm actually talking about
 
01:38:09.350 --> 01:38:09.360 align:start position:0%
30616 and the proposed rules yeah and
 
01:38:13.709 --> 01:38:13.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:16.950 --> 01:38:16.960 align:start position:0%
G4 so G is an approved CT program shall
 
01:38:20.510 --> 01:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
be one that colon and four is implements
 
01:38:22.510 --> 01:38:22.520 align:start position:0%
thirdparty assessments as recognized and
 
01:38:25.189 --> 01:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
designated by the department yeah so I
 
01:38:27.030 --> 01:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer of every because I
 
01:38:28.430 --> 01:38:28.440 align:start position:0%
know that there are many assessments and
 
01:38:30.229 --> 01:38:30.239 align:start position:0%
they're generally tied to the industry
 
01:38:31.669 --> 01:38:31.679 align:start position:0%
recognized credentials at the students
 
01:38:33.510 --> 01:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
earning but I couldn't sit here to today
 
01:38:35.669 --> 01:38:35.679 align:start position:0%
and tell you that so they are
 
01:38:37.750 --> 01:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
implementing thirdparty assessments
 
01:38:39.910 --> 01:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely whether every single program
 
01:38:41.070 --> 01:38:41.080 align:start position:0%
has an assessment or not I don't know
 
01:38:42.790 --> 01:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
the answer okay because that's a change
 
01:38:45.709 --> 01:38:45.719 align:start position:0%
and and one of the other um changes as
 
01:38:50.669 --> 01:38:50.679 align:start position:0%
well is in the in the back half of the
 
01:38:53.709 --> 01:38:53.719 align:start position:0%
rules in um
 
01:38:53.719 --> 01:38:57.030 align:start position:0%
rules in um
get

01:38:57.030 --> 01:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:02.790 --> 01:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:06.709 --> 01:39:06.719 align:start position:0%
uh in current rule
 
01:39:11.350 --> 01:39:11.360 align:start position:0%
30634 which has been um which is being
 
01:39:13.270 --> 01:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
repealed right because we've moved much
 
01:39:15.189 --> 01:39:15.199 align:start position:0%
of that content to the front side right
 
01:39:16.189 --> 01:39:16.199 align:start position:0%
there something that we didn't move
 
01:39:18.149 --> 01:39:18.159 align:start position:0%
forward that you're concern well just
 
01:39:19.830 --> 01:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
one one area that sort of jumps out at
 
01:39:24.629 --> 01:39:24.639 align:start position:0%
me is the um is the list of um of about
 
01:39:31.390 --> 01:39:31.400 align:start position:0%
I don't know 16 17 different areas um uh
 
01:39:33.470 --> 01:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
nationally recognized Career Cluster
 
01:39:36.229 --> 01:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
areas that I think our CTE programs
 
01:39:38.070 --> 01:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
focus on right now and and I agree you
 
01:39:39.629 --> 01:39:39.639 align:start position:0%
know these can change over time and
 
01:39:42.390 --> 01:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
maybe we're being too prescriptive
 
01:39:46.229 --> 01:39:46.239 align:start position:0%
having them in rules but um but you know
 
01:39:49.629 --> 01:39:49.639 align:start position:0%
these These are areas that I think uh
 
01:39:49.639 --> 01:39:50.830 align:start position:0%
these These are areas that I think uh
are

01:39:50.830 --> 01:39:50.840 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:39:53.950 --> 01:39:53.960 align:start position:0%
are of you know you know
 
01:39:56.270 --> 01:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
likely to have you know
 
01:39:59.709 --> 01:39:59.719 align:start position:0%
interest in the legislature because they
 
01:40:02.030 --> 01:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
um you know there are areas that that
 
01:40:05.709 --> 01:40:05.719 align:start position:0%
provide um skills for a student coming
 
01:40:07.030 --> 01:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
you know while they're in high school
 
01:40:08.790 --> 01:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
while they come out of high school where
 
01:40:11.550 --> 01:40:11.560 align:start position:0%
they can uh enter certain certain fields
 
01:40:14.430 --> 01:40:14.440 align:start position:0%
and provide useful you know valuable you
 
01:40:16.310 --> 01:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
know skills having come out of the CTE
 
01:40:19.030 --> 01:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
program so so um I'm just wondering why
 
01:40:21.830 --> 01:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
those were were eliminated so I mean to
 
01:40:23.910 --> 01:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
your point I mean so we do Center all of
 
01:40:26.270 --> 01:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
the programming around the uh the
 
01:40:28.310 --> 01:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
industry cluster areas we've got you
 
01:40:30.109 --> 01:40:30.119 align:start position:0%
know our industry advisory boards who
 
01:40:32.550 --> 01:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
are weighing in on those um but to your
 
01:40:36.270 --> 01:40:36.280 align:start position:0%
point uh it's somewhat of a dynamic um
 
01:40:38.070 --> 01:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
you know list in the sense that things
 
01:40:40.910 --> 01:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
change and so uh it's you know we think
 
01:40:42.510 --> 01:40:42.520 align:start position:0%
we can work very closely with the CTE
 
01:40:44.270 --> 01:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
centers to make sure that we're offering
 
01:40:47.709 --> 01:40:47.719 align:start position:0%
and approving relevant programs for the
 
01:40:50.350 --> 01:40:50.360 align:start position:0%
students to be able to access um I can
 
01:40:52.910 --> 01:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
tell you that we had seen in the past
 
01:40:56.109 --> 01:40:56.119 align:start position:0%
some of our programs become stale um I'm
 
01:40:58.270 --> 01:40:58.280 align:start position:0%
happy to you know an example of that you
 
01:41:00.189 --> 01:41:00.199 align:start position:0%
know many of the programs going back you
 
01:41:01.870 --> 01:41:01.880 align:start position:0%
know a number of years I think we pretty
 
01:41:03.750 --> 01:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
much have moved Beyond this at this
 
01:41:06.070 --> 01:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
point in time offered what we're often
 
01:41:07.750 --> 01:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
referred to as marketing programs to
 
01:41:09.830 --> 01:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
students um but when you looked at the
 
01:41:11.189 --> 01:41:11.199 align:start position:0%
marketing program it was really more of
 
01:41:13.750 --> 01:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
a retail program and they were uh you
 
01:41:15.589 --> 01:41:15.599 align:start position:0%
know operating a display case and
 
01:41:17.470 --> 01:41:17.480 align:start position:0%
arranging you know School sweatshirts
 
01:41:19.589 --> 01:41:19.599 align:start position:0%
and stuff like that and so we encourage
 
01:41:21.229 --> 01:41:21.239 align:start position:0%
the schools to move forward and
 
01:41:23.669 --> 01:41:23.679 align:start position:0%
marketing to be much more of a you know
 
01:41:26.270 --> 01:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
Amazon type of a of a program like this
 
01:41:28.229 --> 01:41:28.239 align:start position:0%
says to be digital and how do you access
 
01:41:30.350 --> 01:41:30.360 align:start position:0%
millions of people and stuff like that
 
01:41:32.669 --> 01:41:32.679 align:start position:0%
uh another example is we had a number of
 
01:41:35.229 --> 01:41:35.239 align:start position:0%
uh Horticultural programs or we had some
 
01:41:37.550 --> 01:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
Horticultural programs where um and I
 
01:41:38.910 --> 01:41:38.920 align:start position:0%
love it you know students were working
 
01:41:41.030 --> 01:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
on you know growing orchids and doing
 
01:41:42.750 --> 01:41:42.760 align:start position:0%
Orchid arrangements and stuff like that
 
01:41:44.629 --> 01:41:44.639 align:start position:0%
you know good skill fun to have not
 
01:41:46.790 --> 01:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
going to be your high- wage job but
 
01:41:49.229 --> 01:41:49.239 align:start position:0%
plant science is the emergence out of
 
01:41:51.229 --> 01:41:51.239 align:start position:0%
that and we see a lot of investment here
 
01:41:52.629 --> 01:41:52.639 align:start position:0%
in the state and in across New England
 
01:41:54.950 --> 01:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
in terms of PL science so um really I
 
01:41:57.310 --> 01:41:57.320 align:start position:0%
think that the logic is probably uh just
 
01:41:59.990 --> 01:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we can continue to
 
01:42:01.390 --> 01:42:01.400 align:start position:0%
have a system that's responsive to the
 
01:42:03.229 --> 01:42:03.239 align:start position:0%
needs of our Industries yeah I think
 
01:42:04.750 --> 01:42:04.760 align:start position:0%
that's I think it's fair enough I with
 
01:42:06.310 --> 01:42:06.320 align:start position:0%
respect to PL science I think you know
 
01:42:08.030 --> 01:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
that's probably covered in some of the
 
01:42:10.470 --> 01:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
um some of the uh cluster areas that
 
01:42:12.430 --> 01:42:12.440 align:start position:0%
you've that are in existing rules too
 
01:42:14.070 --> 01:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
because you've got agriculture is
 
01:42:17.830 --> 01:42:17.840 align:start position:0%
certainly uh one of those areas um but
 
01:42:20.229 --> 01:42:20.239 align:start position:0%
um but you know thanks I think that that
 
01:42:21.790 --> 01:42:21.800 align:start position:0%
answers the
 
01:42:24.109 --> 01:42:24.119 align:start position:0%
question are there any other questions
 
01:42:27.790 --> 01:42:27.800 align:start position:0%
from the committee regarding the the
 
01:42:31.790 --> 01:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:35.229 --> 01:42:35.239 align:start position:0%
side looks like we've asked our our
 
01:42:37.870 --> 01:42:37.880 align:start position:0%
questions thank you well thank you very

responsibility of making some
 
01:43:04.950 --> 01:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:10.030 align:start position:0%

make
 
01:43:19.149 --> 01:43:19.159 align:start position:0%
recommendations uh uh to academic
 
01:43:21.510 --> 01:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
standards under consideration by the
 
01:43:23.830 --> 01:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
state board and minimum standard Public
 
01:43:25.550 --> 01:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
School approval under consideration by
 
01:43:28.030 --> 01:43:28.040 align:start position:0%
the State Board of Education pursuant to
 
01:43:30.390 --> 01:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
the state board has approved these right
 
01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:32.870 align:start position:0%
the state board has approved these right
now

01:43:32.870 --> 01:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:43:35.990 --> 01:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
so uh attorney moral can you help us out
 
01:43:38.870 --> 01:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
with this do we we we
 
01:43:41.669 --> 01:43:41.679 align:start position:0%
can't are we in a position right now
 
01:43:44.430 --> 01:43:44.440 align:start position:0%
where we make our recommendations
 
01:43:45.910 --> 01:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
according to what we're supposed to be
 
01:43:48.669 --> 01:43:48.679 align:start position:0%
doing here to the State Board they've
 
01:43:51.390 --> 01:43:51.400 align:start position:0%
approved so do our recommendations go
 
01:43:53.390 --> 01:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
forth to jard
 
01:43:56.950 --> 01:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
um I'm afraid I can't answer that uh for
 
01:43:59.189 --> 01:43:59.199 align:start position:0%
the record Mike Michael moral uh
 
01:44:01.790 --> 01:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
director of administrative rules within
 
01:44:05.510 --> 01:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
OS uh the statute doesn't seem to say
 
01:44:08.790 --> 01:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
who the recommendation is made to uh it
 
01:44:10.790 --> 01:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
seems like it would be beneficial if it
 
01:44:13.669 --> 01:44:13.679 align:start position:0%
went both to the department and to jail
 
01:44:17.790 --> 01:44:17.800 align:start position:0%
car okay chairman if I'm I mean we're
 
01:44:19.390 --> 01:44:19.400 align:start position:0%
happy to take any recommendations
 
01:44:20.950 --> 01:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
whether the front half or the back half
 
01:44:23.229 --> 01:44:23.239 align:start position:0%
as both of these evolve and that any
 
01:44:24.470 --> 01:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
point in time we can bring those back to
 
01:44:25.629 --> 01:44:25.639 align:start position:0%
the State Board of Education for
 
01:44:28.830 --> 01:44:28.840 align:start position:0%
reconsideration so so we're interested
 
01:44:31.470 --> 01:44:31.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:34.790 --> 01:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
feedback so uh
 
01:44:37.430 --> 01:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner you've approved these have
 
01:44:42.109 --> 01:44:42.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:45.070 --> 01:44:45.080 align:start position:0%
approved board but if something happens
 
01:44:47.830 --> 01:44:47.840 align:start position:0%
at Jael car we got bring it back then
 
01:44:49.270 --> 01:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
you're going to go through
 
01:44:52.510 --> 01:44:52.520 align:start position:0%
yeah okay I could I could go over that
 
01:44:54.229 --> 01:44:54.239 align:start position:0%
process a a little bit Yeah would you
 
01:44:56.589 --> 01:44:56.599 align:start position:0%
please uh last month Department brought
 
01:44:59.470 --> 01:44:59.480 align:start position:0%
forward the Jael car the first half what
 
01:45:02.109 --> 01:45:02.119 align:start position:0%
they brought was their final proposal my
 
01:45:03.990 --> 01:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
staff had commented on the final
 
01:45:07.109 --> 01:45:07.119 align:start position:0%
proposal and based on those comments and
 
01:45:09.790 --> 01:45:09.800 align:start position:0%
probably public testimony the department
 
01:45:11.950 --> 01:45:11.960 align:start position:0%
said okay we want to address some of
 
01:45:14.589 --> 01:45:14.599 align:start position:0%
those issues so they put forth a
 
01:45:17.550 --> 01:45:17.560 align:start position:0%
conditional approval request uh which is
 
01:45:19.629 --> 01:45:19.639 align:start position:0%
what jel car looked at and took
 
01:45:24.149 --> 01:45:24.159 align:start position:0%
testimony on um but Jael car decided at
 
01:45:25.669 --> 01:45:25.679 align:start position:0%
last month's meeting that they really
 
01:45:28.589 --> 01:45:28.599 align:start position:0%
needed both halves taken up at the same
 
01:45:30.950 --> 01:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
time uh because they were so
 
01:45:33.229 --> 01:45:33.239 align:start position:0%
interchangeable and each side affected
 
01:45:37.390 --> 01:45:37.400 align:start position:0%
the other um next month jokar will be
 
01:45:40.790 --> 01:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
taking up both with the uh second half
 
01:45:44.229 --> 01:45:44.239 align:start position:0%
it will be the final proposal um we have
 
01:45:46.589 --> 01:45:46.599 align:start position:0%
not my office has not yet received that
 
01:45:49.550 --> 01:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
and reviewed it once we do we'll send
 
01:45:52.070 --> 01:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
that to the department and they may put
 
01:46:01.550 --> 01:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:03.709 --> 01:46:03.719 align:start position:0%
that and just to be clear we were
 
01:46:05.750 --> 01:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
waiting we were waiting until we heard
 
01:46:07.149 --> 01:46:07.159 align:start position:0%
back from you all before we submitted
 
01:46:10.430 --> 01:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
the final for them to take a look at we
 
01:46:13.510 --> 01:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
went okay so that lets us know where we
 
01:46:16.270 --> 01:46:16.280 align:start position:0%
are right now in the process the process
 
01:46:17.669 --> 01:46:17.679 align:start position:0%
and that's not the final end of the
 
01:46:19.830 --> 01:46:19.840 align:start position:0%
process I mean if the conditional
 
01:46:21.589 --> 01:46:21.599 align:start position:0%
approval still didn't take care of
 
01:46:23.830 --> 01:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
everything and were further things that
 
01:46:25.790 --> 01:46:25.800 align:start position:0%
department wanted to correct then they
 
01:46:28.589 --> 01:46:28.599 align:start position:0%
could do an amended conditional approval
 
01:46:30.870 --> 01:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh Jael car can approve the final
 
01:46:33.550 --> 01:46:33.560 align:start position:0%
proposals and conditional approvals or
 
01:46:36.470 --> 01:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
they can do a preliminary objection if
 
01:46:39.149 --> 01:46:39.159 align:start position:0%
they do a preliminary objection then the
 
01:46:41.109 --> 01:46:41.119 align:start position:0%
department has a deadline to come back
 
01:46:44.430 --> 01:46:44.440 align:start position:0%
with a new text um to the degree that
 
01:46:46.870 --> 01:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
they do not make changes which they're
 
01:46:49.270 --> 01:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
not required to do they will lay those
 
01:46:52.629 --> 01:46:52.639 align:start position:0%
out in a letter explaining why they feel
 
01:46:55.149 --> 01:46:55.159 align:start position:0%
that the that issue is not one they
 
01:46:57.550 --> 01:46:57.560 align:start position:0%
should uh
 
01:46:59.310 --> 01:46:59.320 align:start position:0%
change thank
 
01:47:03.270 --> 01:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
you further information needed from the
 
01:47:05.510 --> 01:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very
 
01:47:10.390 --> 01:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:13.589 --> 01:47:13.599 align:start position:0%
retiring after next month's
 
01:47:21.589 --> 01:47:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:23.790 --> 01:47:23.800 align:start position:0%
wow I I think you got to talk to your
 
01:47:23.800 --> 01:47:25.350 align:start position:0%
wow I I think you got to talk to your
wife

first okay
 
01:47:31.229 --> 01:47:31.239 align:start position:0%
um I I think what we need to do is the
 
01:47:33.189 --> 01:47:33.199 align:start position:0%
committee needs a little opportunity we
 
01:47:34.589 --> 01:47:34.599 align:start position:0%
we want to talk about some because if
 
01:47:36.629 --> 01:47:36.639 align:start position:0%
we're going to make some recommendations
 
01:47:39.189 --> 01:47:39.199 align:start position:0%
for your consideration at the department
 
01:47:41.709 --> 01:47:41.719 align:start position:0%
we got got to do that quickly here we
 
01:47:44.990 --> 01:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
also have a date set for next
 
01:47:47.950 --> 01:47:47.960 align:start position:0%
Monday um if we need
 
01:47:53.669 --> 01:47:53.679 align:start position:0%

01:47:55.510 --> 01:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
so I I'm putting out to committee
 
01:47:58.950 --> 01:47:58.960 align:start position:0%

01:48:01.830 --> 01:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
here and try to Wade through and try to
 
01:48:04.070 --> 01:48:04.080 align:start position:0%

up or down now or do you want to have
 
01:48:09.589 --> 01:48:09.599 align:start position:0%
sort of work session and then come back
 
01:48:12.470 --> 01:48:12.480 align:start position:0%

01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:15.109 align:start position:0%
and make a decision uh perhaps on Monday
the

01:48:15.109 --> 01:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:48:18.430 --> 01:48:18.440 align:start position:0%
21st well M Mr chair thanks um for
 
01:48:20.109 --> 01:48:20.119 align:start position:0%
putting that out there I'd still like to
 
01:48:21.550 --> 01:48:21.560 align:start position:0%
hear back from the commissioner with
 
01:48:23.030 --> 01:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
respect to the connection between the
 
01:48:25.950 --> 01:48:25.960 align:start position:0%
current rules and the um uh curriculum
 
01:48:28.149 --> 01:48:28.159 align:start position:0%
Frameworks or academic standards as
 
01:48:30.430 --> 01:48:30.440 align:start position:0%
they've been referred to because the
 
01:48:32.589 --> 01:48:32.599 align:start position:0%
clearly the proposed rules have that
 
01:48:34.390 --> 01:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
connection in place the Incorporated
 
01:48:37.109 --> 01:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
reference but I just would you know want
 
01:48:38.470 --> 01:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
to understand where that is in the
 
01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:39.870 align:start position:0%
to understand where that is in the
current

01:48:39.870 --> 01:48:39.880 align:start position:0%
current
 
01:48:42.109 --> 01:48:42.119 align:start position:0%
rules I think the Commissioners agreed
 
01:48:45.270 --> 01:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:47.750 --> 01:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
that any comments from the committee on
 
01:48:49.589 --> 01:48:49.599 align:start position:0%
that yes represent in in the current
 
01:48:51.470 --> 01:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
rules I'm not sure where the reference
 
01:48:55.790 --> 01:48:55.800 align:start position:0%
is to the Frameworks not not in the 36s
 
01:48:58.550 --> 01:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
I don't see that for instance math in
 
01:49:01.229 --> 01:49:01.239 align:start position:0%
36s the current 36s I don't see any
 
01:49:03.270 --> 01:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
reference to that I'm I'm not either
 
01:49:05.229 --> 01:49:05.239 align:start position:0%
right but but I think also if you look
 
01:49:10.229 --> 01:49:10.239 align:start position:0%
at the um uh definition of rules and in
 
01:49:14.790 --> 01:49:14.800 align:start position:0%
21 uh and N um it talks about rules
 
01:49:17.229 --> 01:49:17.239 align:start position:0%
relative to the minimum standard so I
 
01:49:19.510 --> 01:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
don't think that it lays out a direct
 
01:49:22.950 --> 01:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
connection that the rules are in any way
 
01:49:30.510 --> 01:49:30.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:32.629 --> 01:49:32.639 align:start position:0%
themselves well I think we have said
 
01:49:34.470 --> 01:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
through statutory language last year
 
01:49:39.830 --> 01:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
that the rules are not the academic
 
01:49:44.149 --> 01:49:44.159 align:start position:0%
standards right but but if a if a major
 
01:49:46.669 --> 01:49:46.679 align:start position:0%
part of these changes is now
 
01:49:48.910 --> 01:49:48.920 align:start position:0%
incorporating the academic standards
 
01:49:51.390 --> 01:49:51.400 align:start position:0%
through reference where those had not
 
01:49:53.750 --> 01:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
been Incorporated through reference in
 
01:49:56.070 --> 01:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
the past then then that's a pretty
 
01:49:58.990 --> 01:49:59.000 align:start position:0%
substantial change um you know because
 
01:50:01.470 --> 01:50:01.480 align:start position:0%
that's the difference
 
01:50:03.950 --> 01:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
between making it a requirement for
 
01:50:07.990 --> 01:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
school approval and um and not having it
 
01:50:13.550 --> 01:50:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:17.350 --> 01:50:17.360 align:start position:0%
approval the meeting on monday1 o' the
 
01:50:19.109 --> 01:50:19.119 align:start position:0%
meeting on
 
01:50:26.229 --> 01:50:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:28.550 --> 01:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
morning have some things on Monday is
 
01:50:30.709 --> 01:50:30.719 align:start position:0%
that scheduled well yes that's in the
 
01:50:32.350 --> 01:50:32.360 align:start position:0%
calendar and then you have a one o'clock
 
01:50:35.189 --> 01:50:35.199 align:start position:0%
EFA meeting yes yeah 9:30
 
01:50:37.310 --> 01:50:37.320 align:start position:0%
yeah we
 
01:50:42.550 --> 01:50:42.560 align:start position:0%
do yes that's but yeah I would just say
 
01:50:46.790 --> 01:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
that um the current math uh rule does
 
01:50:50.229 --> 01:50:50.239 align:start position:0%
not refer to common core standards but I
 
01:50:54.629 --> 01:50:54.639 align:start position:0%
think it's um pretty well understood
 
01:50:57.470 --> 01:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
that the Common Core math standards are
 
01:50:59.229 --> 01:50:59.239 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:51:01.589 --> 01:51:01.599 align:start position:0%
standards even though that it doesn't
 
01:51:10.830 --> 01:51:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:13.189 --> 01:51:13.199 align:start position:0%
program one of the
 
01:51:16.510 --> 01:51:16.520 align:start position:0%
points last yel car meeting had to
 
01:51:19.510 --> 01:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
do one of the points that was discussed
 
01:51:21.310 --> 01:51:21.320 align:start position:0%
at the last jail car meeting was the
 
01:51:23.390 --> 01:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
class I
 
01:51:26.069 --> 01:51:26.079 align:start position:0%
some people had a very
 
01:51:28.709 --> 01:51:28.719 align:start position:0%
you they felt the class size was just
 
01:51:31.990 --> 01:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
too big and I have heard since then
 
01:51:34.790 --> 01:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
people mistakenly saying that there's
 
01:51:37.629 --> 01:51:37.639 align:start position:0%
absolutely no control over the class
 
01:51:40.629 --> 01:51:40.639 align:start position:0%
size they can go up to 50 kits and this
 
01:51:42.430 --> 01:51:42.440 align:start position:0%
is what's being touted so I think that
 
01:51:44.390 --> 01:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
has to be dealt
 
01:51:49.550 --> 01:51:49.560 align:start position:0%
with then the class sizes this it as
 
01:51:52.750 --> 01:51:52.760 align:start position:0%
25 or less
 
01:51:54.550 --> 01:51:54.560 align:start position:0%
and nobody's paying attention to that
 
01:51:57.750 --> 01:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
for for K through
 
01:52:00.790 --> 01:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
2 it's
 
01:52:06.550 --> 01:52:06.560 align:start position:0%
25 or less and recommend 20 yes and for
 
01:52:09.950 --> 01:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
three through 12 it's
 
01:52:13.910 --> 01:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
30 and recommended 25 or try to hold it
 
01:52:13.920 --> 01:52:14.629 align:start position:0%
30 and recommended 25 or try to hold it
to

01:52:14.629 --> 01:52:14.639 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:52:17.790 --> 01:52:17.800 align:start position:0%
25 um there was an attempt last year
 
01:52:20.030 --> 01:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
when we were dealing with the budget
 
01:52:22.589 --> 01:52:22.599 align:start position:0%
side of things and we were looking at
 
01:52:24.470 --> 01:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
the inputs to the
 
01:52:27.790 --> 01:52:27.800 align:start position:0%
formula to try and set it up so it would
 
01:52:31.470 --> 01:52:31.480 align:start position:0%
be K through grade three with that
 
01:52:34.669 --> 01:52:34.679 align:start position:0%
lesser ratio of
 
01:52:37.709 --> 01:52:37.719 align:start position:0%
25 seeing the middle schools start at
 
01:52:41.790 --> 01:52:41.800 align:start position:0%
grade four and go forward um the grade
 
01:52:43.830 --> 01:52:43.840 align:start position:0%
schools basically go through grade some
 
01:52:46.510 --> 01:52:46.520 align:start position:0%
go through grade six yes but the statory
 
01:52:49.629 --> 01:52:49.639 align:start position:0%
language also says you know four through
 
01:52:53.109 --> 01:52:53.119 align:start position:0%
eight can be a middle school so we we
 
01:52:56.550 --> 01:52:56.560 align:start position:0%
looked at that um and it didn't
 
01:52:58.990 --> 01:52:59.000 align:start position:0%
fly but I think that's something that's
 
01:53:00.310 --> 01:53:00.320 align:start position:0%
got to be done and I don't know if it
 
01:53:02.030 --> 01:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
should be done through this rul making
 
01:53:03.510 --> 01:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
process or if it should be done
 
01:53:05.629 --> 01:53:05.639 align:start position:0%
statutorily when we're talking about
 
01:53:08.189 --> 01:53:08.199 align:start position:0%
finances and inputs vers
 
01:53:10.390 --> 01:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
outcomes and I'm sure that discussion is
 
01:53:14.830 --> 01:53:14.840 align:start position:0%
coming up again this year it
 
01:53:17.430 --> 01:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
will so
 
01:53:20.990 --> 01:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
um but I agree with you you know the the
 
01:53:22.990 --> 01:53:23.000 align:start position:0%
the actual what what is the act ual
 
01:53:26.149 --> 01:53:26.159 align:start position:0%
enroll and ratio is at right around 12
 
01:53:30.430 --> 01:53:30.440 align:start position:0%
to1 in the elementary schools 12.7
 
01:53:34.950 --> 01:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
12.7 May a little yeah
 
01:53:40.069 --> 01:53:40.079 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so do you want to try to take
 
01:53:42.310 --> 01:53:42.320 align:start position:0%
a break and finish this out today or do
 
01:53:45.470 --> 01:53:45.480 align:start position:0%
you want to come back on Monday I have
 
01:53:48.870 --> 01:53:48.880 align:start position:0%
an appointment at 1 so you okay we'll
 
01:53:50.790 --> 01:53:50.800 align:start position:0%
have to come back
 
01:53:54.189 --> 01:53:54.199 align:start position:0%
yeah we'll come back yeah yeah 9:30
 
01:53:57.069 --> 01:53:57.079 align:start position:0%
Monday morning okay and the purpose of
 
01:53:59.870 --> 01:53:59.880 align:start position:0%
that would be then to come up with our
 
01:54:02.430 --> 01:54:02.440 align:start position:0%
as we're required
 
01:54:05.910 --> 01:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
the recommendations related to these
 
01:54:07.629 --> 01:54:07.639 align:start position:0%
academic or minimum standards of public
 
01:54:10.870 --> 01:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
school approval and both and those
 
01:54:12.830 --> 01:54:12.840 align:start position:0%
recommendations could include
 
01:54:15.390 --> 01:54:15.400 align:start position:0%
changes to what we've been presed today
 
01:54:16.390 --> 01:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm
 
01:54:18.470 --> 01:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
sure we can

recom yeah yeah okay
 
01:54:25.270 --> 01:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
so that's what we'll do then we'll come
 
01:54:28.990 --> 01:54:29.000 align:start position:0%
back and take that up on
 
01:54:31.270 --> 01:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
Monday is there anything else for the
 
01:54:31.280 --> 01:54:33.189 align:start position:0%
