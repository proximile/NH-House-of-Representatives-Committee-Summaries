that's just a fancy way of saying try to
 
00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
take over the world the point of this
 
00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:31.880 align:start position:0%
bill is to make it very difficult for
 
00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:33.720 align:start position:0%
anti-American sabots within government
 
00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:35.080 align:start position:0%
to violate their Oaths and duties and
 
00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:36.520 align:start position:0%
try to enforce the will of international
 
00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:38.200 align:start position:0%

number
 
00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:54.440 align:start position:0%
6838 and if you look at line 12 that's
 
00:17:56.669 --> 00:17:56.679 align:start position:0%
where the changes in the amendment
 
00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:00.799 align:start position:0%
are 6838 okay yep let me take a look at
 
00:18:03.789 --> 00:18:03.799 align:start position:0%
that I'm sorry you said it's on line 12
 
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:30.240 align:start position:0%

what begins
 
00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:46.600 align:start position:0%
on line eight of the amendment is meant
 
00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:50.440 align:start position:0%
to correspond with what begins on line
 
00:18:54.149 --> 00:18:54.159 align:start position:0%
20 of the uh of the original bill and I
 
00:18:55.549 --> 00:18:55.559 align:start position:0%

00:18:59.029 --> 00:18:59.039 align:start position:0%
sense correct all right so hang on just

00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:11.880 align:start position:0%

00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:25.440 align:start position:0%

just asking you to pass the binder down
 
00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:29.320 align:start position:0%
right so
 
00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
um representative gr I wondered could
 
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
you just tell us what the language
 
00:20:35.909 --> 00:20:35.919 align:start position:0%
change is specifically so on line 24 of
 
00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
the original bill it says who create and
 
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
enforce policies which rely on the
 
00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:41.080 align:start position:0%
claims of the World Health Organization
 
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
the amendment changes that who enforces
 
00:20:44.549 --> 00:20:44.559 align:start position:0%
policies mandates orders requirements
 
00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:46.640 align:start position:0%
edicts or directives of the World Health
 
00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:48.799 align:start position:0%
Organization and uh the intent of the
 
00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:50.559 align:start position:0%
bill was never to create any sort of
 
00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:52.200 align:start position:0%
thought crime and that's why I thought
 
00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
it was important to make this small
 
00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:55.230 align:start position:0%
it was important to make this small
change

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:55.240 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:04.549 --> 00:21:04.559 align:start position:0%
okay all right and Roman and am I
 
00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
correct that Roman numeral 2 of your
 
00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
amendment that begins on line 14 of the
 
00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
amendment that that doesn't change from
 
00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
what's on line 26 of the original bill
 
00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:18.440 align:start position:0%
is that correct it it's not supposed to
 
00:21:20.909 --> 00:21:20.919 align:start position:0%
and it it doesn't appear to no okay no I
 
00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
just that's what I thought but I just
 
00:21:25.149 --> 00:21:25.159 align:start position:0%
want to make sure all right um all right
 
00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
great uh uh thank you people have
 
00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:32.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:34.520 align:start position:0%
witness representative foran um just to
 
00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:36.200 align:start position:0%
summarize so the amendment on the one
 
00:21:37.549 --> 00:21:37.559 align:start position:0%
hand it takes out the creates so you
 
00:21:39.029 --> 00:21:39.039 align:start position:0%
don't have thought crimes the other hand
 
00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:41.480 align:start position:0%
I guess it also you apparently felt
 
00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:43.240 align:start position:0%
there was a Omission because the
 
00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:45.400 align:start position:0%
original Bill only covered policies and
 
00:21:47.029 --> 00:21:47.039 align:start position:0%
this also covers mandates orders
 
00:21:48.909 --> 00:21:48.919 align:start position:0%
requirements edicts and directives is
 
00:21:48.919 --> 00:21:56.789 align:start position:0%
requirements edicts and directives is
that

00:21:56.789 --> 00:21:56.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:59.549 --> 00:21:59.559 align:start position:0%
correct so if you look at the first page
 
00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
of the bill says no rule regulation fee
 
00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:03.880 align:start position:0%
tax policy or
 
00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
mandate line three no rule regulation
 
00:22:09.269 --> 00:22:09.279 align:start position:0%
fee tax policy or Mandate of any kind of

Nations and World economic Forum shall
 
00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
be enforced so yeah um it if it would be
 
00:22:17.029 --> 00:22:17.039 align:start position:0%
better with the same exact language that
 
00:22:19.789 --> 00:22:19.799 align:start position:0%
would be amenable to me in case
 
00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:21.640 align:start position:0%
somebody's trying to create enforce
 
00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:23.320 align:start position:0%
something that's not necessarily a
 
00:22:27.029 --> 00:22:27.039 align:start position:0%
policy but is still a mandate uh order
 
00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
requirement edct or directive I get it

variety of diverse sources of
 
00:24:19.789 --> 00:24:19.799 align:start position:0%
information to optimally provide care
 
00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:22.840 align:start position:0%
for my the diverse patient populations
 
00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:25.000 align:start position:0%
of which there are many residing in our
 
00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
beautiful state we are incredibly
 
00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:30.200 align:start position:0%
fortunate to have the cultural and so
 
00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:32.440 align:start position:0%
social diversity in New Hampshire that
 
00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:35.240 align:start position:0%
makes us stronger and more capable if
 
00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
than if we were all the same the
 
00:24:39.549 --> 00:24:39.559 align:start position:0%
profession of nursing has an honored
 
00:24:41.669 --> 00:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
place as the most trusted profession for
 
00:24:44.549 --> 00:24:44.559 align:start position:0%
the 23rd year in a row according to
 
00:24:47.789 --> 00:24:47.799 align:start position:0%
respective Gall Gallup pole trust is
 
00:24:49.549 --> 00:24:49.559 align:start position:0%
something that is severely lacking in
 
00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:52.360 align:start position:0%
our society and I'm here to assure you
 
00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:54.520 align:start position:0%
that when you seek care for an illness
 
00:24:57.269 --> 00:24:57.279 align:start position:0%
or other health care concerns your nurse
 
00:25:00.149 --> 00:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
will be there for you walking alongside
 
00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:02.600 align:start position:0%
you making sure you are safe and well
 
00:25:05.389 --> 00:25:05.399 align:start position:0%
cared for you will be able to trust that
 
00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:07.880 align:start position:0%
nurse here or she must be knowledgeable
 
00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
and equipped with the highest quality
 
00:25:12.269 --> 00:25:12.279 align:start position:0%
information from respected
 
00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
resources I fear HB 584 will place
 
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
nurses in a dire position in the future
 
00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:21.440 align:start position:0%
as they work to care for patients in new
 
00:25:25.669 --> 00:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
Hamp in New Hampshire HB 584 is a piece
 
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
of legislation that will limit
 
00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:30.360 align:start position:0%
information from sources that inform my
 
00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:33.640 align:start position:0%
practice and optimize the care I provide
 
00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:35.640 align:start position:0%
as well as the care provided by my
 
00:25:38.149 --> 00:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
nursing colleagues as a professional
 
00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
nurse who reviews the literature daily I
 
00:25:43.029 --> 00:25:43.039 align:start position:0%
can recognize its strengths and
 
00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
limitations and with this Clarity I am
 
00:25:48.669 --> 00:25:48.679 align:start position:0%
able to support patients choices to
 
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
achieve their goals for health is
 
00:25:54.549 --> 00:25:54.559 align:start position:0%
crucial to have access to organizations
 
00:25:56.789 --> 00:25:56.799 align:start position:0%
whose mission is to improve the lives of
 
00:25:58.750 --> 00:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
people around the globe
 
00:26:01.669 --> 00:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
I am imploring you to vote itl on this
 
00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
bill a responsible citizen does not
 
00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:07.960 align:start position:0%
avoid information a responsible citizen
 
00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:10.840 align:start position:0%
learns from information our state has
 
00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:13.000 align:start position:0%
always been able to think and act
 
00:26:15.029 --> 00:26:15.039 align:start position:0%
independent of the current political
 
00:26:17.669 --> 00:26:17.679 align:start position:0%
Winds of the day I hope you will stand

please thank you Mr chair members of the

NH um thank you for the opportunity to
 
00:27:31.149 --> 00:27:31.159 align:start position:0%
speak today in support of HB 584 which I
 
00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
have come to refer to as the
 
00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
anti-globalist ACT this bill is a
 
00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
crucial step in protecting the
 
00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:38.840 align:start position:0%
sovereignty of New Hampshire and the
 
00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:40.760 align:start position:0%
ability of our state to make decisions
 
00:27:43.149 --> 00:27:43.159 align:start position:0%
free from external mandates that could
 
00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
come from an organization like the World
 
00:27:47.029 --> 00:27:47.039 align:start position:0%
Health Organization the United Nations
 
00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
or the world economic Forum the essence
 
00:27:51.909 --> 00:27:51.919 align:start position:0%
of this bill is simple it prohibits the
 
00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
state and its political subdivisions
 
00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
from enforcing any mandate from these
 
00:27:57.549 --> 00:27:57.559 align:start position:0%
entities when a version of this bill was
 
00:27:58.909 --> 00:27:58.919 align:start position:0%
introduced last last year there was some
 
00:28:00.789 --> 00:28:00.799 align:start position:0%
concern about it being overly broad or
 
00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
restrictive but I want to clarify that
 
00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
we are not trying to restrict the
 
00:28:06.149 --> 00:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
ability of the state to reference
 
00:28:07.509 --> 00:28:07.519 align:start position:0%
research or guidance from these
 
00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
organizations when making informed
 
00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:11.320 align:start position:0%
decisions what we are doing is ensuring
 
00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire is not forced into
 
00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
adopting mandates that could come from
 
00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:16.600 align:start position:0%
organizations that are not accountable
 
00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:19.000 align:start position:0%
to our citizens it's important to note
 
00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:20.200 align:start position:0%
that the scope of the bill has been
 
00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
expanded from last year to include not
 
00:28:25.149 --> 00:28:25.159 align:start position:0%
just the wh but also the UN the wef
 
00:28:26.789 --> 00:28:26.799 align:start position:0%
ensuring broader protections for our
 
00:28:29.149 --> 00:28:29.159 align:start position:0%
States independence the most pressing
 
00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
example of potential mandates from
 
00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
International influences in recent years
 
00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
has been the who's proposed amendments
 
00:28:37.149 --> 00:28:37.159 align:start position:0%
to the pandemic treaty while the threat
 
00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:38.840 align:start position:0%
of those amendments may seem distant we
 
00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:40.200 align:start position:0%
cannot ignore the fact that there could
 
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
be potential reversals in federal policy
 
00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:45.200 align:start position:0%
after the next election the actions of
 
00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:46.600 align:start position:0%
President Trump in withdrawing from the
 
00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
who were a step in the right direction
 
00:28:51.389 --> 00:28:51.399 align:start position:0%
and I fully support that move however we
 
00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
must ensure that these protections are
 
00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
permanent that is why HB 584 is so
 
00:28:58.509 --> 00:28:58.519 align:start position:0%
important it provides long long-term
 
00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
safeguards against potential overreach
 
00:29:02.509 --> 00:29:02.519 align:start position:0%
and ensures that New Hampshire's future
 
00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:04.360 align:start position:0%
will not be dictated by the political
 
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
whims of national or Global
 
00:29:08.669 --> 00:29:08.679 align:start position:0%
organizations the beauty of Federalism
 
00:29:10.269 --> 00:29:10.279 align:start position:0%
is that states have the power to make
 
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
decisions for themselves we should not
 
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
have to rely on nor be subject to the
 
00:29:16.549 --> 00:29:16.559 align:start position:0%
shifting political currence of national
 
00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:19.360 align:start position:0%

00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:24.360 align:start position:0%
rights this bill is not just a
 
00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
reactionary measure it is proactive and
 
00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
it ensures that we as a state will not
 
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
be forced to follow mandates we do not
 
00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
agree with I urge you to support HB 584
 
00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:35.000 align:start position:0%

00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:36.440 align:start position:0%

00:29:52.669 --> 00:29:52.679 align:start position:0%
could you for example just tell us uh
 
00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:56.000 align:start position:0%

00:29:59.070 --> 00:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
mandates from the United Nations
 
00:30:02.509 --> 00:30:02.519 align:start position:0%
uh that uh the state of New Hampshire
 
00:30:05.549 --> 00:30:05.559 align:start position:0%
has imposed on its citizens just numbers
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
for the last five years thank you none
 
00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:11.960 align:start position:0%

it's not uh reactive thank you other
 
00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:18.200 align:start position:0%

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
good morning um I took a look online and
 
00:30:37.509 --> 00:30:37.519 align:start position:0%
saw what was coming up for legislation
 
00:30:40.269 --> 00:30:40.279 align:start position:0%
today and made a kind of last minute
 
00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
decision to stop by uh after I read what
 
00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
was going on here I'm sorry you know can
 
00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:46.200 align:start position:0%
you could I just get a little closer to
 
00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
the mic sorry about that thank you um
 
00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
after seeing what was uh happening
 
00:30:52.549 --> 00:30:52.559 align:start position:0%
legislatively today I thought it'd come
 
00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
down uh after reading this bill I just
 
00:30:56.830 --> 00:30:56.840 align:start position:0%
have a couple of questions uh I know you
 
00:30:58.149 --> 00:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
guys can't answer it so I guess they
 
00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:00.320 align:start position:0%
going to be rhetorical uh first actually
 
00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:02.240 align:start position:0%
I'd like to thank the first person that
 
00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:05.240 align:start position:0%
spoke that was a really well written uh
 
00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:08.360 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill uh which my
 
00:31:09.789 --> 00:31:09.799 align:start position:0%
first question is what's the actual
 
00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
point of this bill uh to me it actually
 
00:31:14.549 --> 00:31:14.559 align:start position:0%
it sounds like a bunch of freest State
 
00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh I got to have my sovereignty uh
 
00:31:19.029 --> 00:31:19.039 align:start position:0%
nonsense that's going to that's actually
 
00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
going to do nothing as we just
 
00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
discovered from uh the representative's
 
00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:26.240 align:start position:0%
last question number two um how about
 
00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
doing some bills that actually address
 
00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:32.120 align:start position:0%
problems that we as our citizens have uh
 
00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:34.440 align:start position:0%
not things that have never happened uh
 
00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
we have housing problems property
 
00:31:40.629 --> 00:31:40.639 align:start position:0%
taxes um equal education for poor kids
 
00:31:43.669 --> 00:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
in in their in school systems that that
 
00:31:45.509 --> 00:31:45.519 align:start position:0%
aren't getting the
 
00:31:48.669 --> 00:31:48.679 align:start position:0%
funding to uh to educate them as they as
 
00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
they should be um third uh oh thank God
 
00:31:57.470 --> 00:31:57.480 align:start position:0%
we had the that Amendment change because
 
00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:58.509 align:start position:0%
we had the that Amendment change because
uh

00:31:58.509 --> 00:31:58.519 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
I'm sure everybody thought they would
 
00:32:03.269 --> 00:32:03.279 align:start position:0%
we're here to create thought crime
 
00:32:03.279 --> 00:32:05.190 align:start position:0%
we're here to create thought crime
laws

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:05.200 align:start position:0%
laws
 
00:32:09.909 --> 00:32:09.919 align:start position:0%
really um and last um performa of
 
00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
legislation like this just hides the
 
00:32:14.029 --> 00:32:14.039 align:start position:0%
failure in addressing actual problems of
 
00:32:15.909 --> 00:32:15.919 align:start position:0%

00:32:18.029 --> 00:32:18.039 align:start position:0%

your comments to the committee okay uh
 
00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:28.480 align:start position:0%
this bill appears to been written by a
 
00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:30.360 align:start position:0%
conspiracy theorist who wishes to be a
 
00:32:33.389 --> 00:32:33.399 align:start position:0%
lawyer um do better right that's
 
00:32:34.909 --> 00:32:34.919 align:start position:0%

00:32:59.190 --> 00:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
short testimony for a person who likes
 
00:33:02.909 --> 00:33:02.919 align:start position:0%
to talk it's um learning to speak in
 
00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
three minutes is really good um previous
 
00:33:08.669 --> 00:33:08.679 align:start position:0%
versions of this bill were Loosely
 
00:33:11.389 --> 00:33:11.399 align:start position:0%
written and I know one of the Reps that
 
00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
I used to sit next to I heard him
 
00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
criticize it and say we should get all
 
00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
the information that we can because that
 
00:33:20.509 --> 00:33:20.519 align:start position:0%
bill was written so that some people
 
00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
misinterpreted it to mean that you
 
00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
couldn't access information from
 
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
International organizations
 
00:33:31.389 --> 00:33:31.399 align:start position:0%
this bill does not does not prohibit any
 
00:33:34.629 --> 00:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
kind of free exchange of information
 
00:33:38.629 --> 00:33:38.639 align:start position:0%
what it tries to do is prevent adopting
 
00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
things from outside that we came across
 
00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:42.950 align:start position:0%
things from outside that we came across
as

00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:33:44.830 --> 00:33:44.840 align:start position:0%
mandates excuse
 
00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
me uh I'm not sure in the in with our
 
00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:52.760 align:start position:0%
experience with covid if the all the
 
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
dictates that were passed around the
 
00:33:57.430 --> 00:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
world that unfortunately were copied
 
00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:58.669 align:start position:0%
world that unfortunately were copied
here

00:33:58.669 --> 00:33:58.679 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:34:01.149 --> 00:34:01.159 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if it was on a written
 
00:34:05.909 --> 00:34:05.919 align:start position:0%
mandate or just um uh convincing people
 
00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
through the media but the result was as
 
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
if we were being mandated we had school
 
00:34:14.829 --> 00:34:14.839 align:start position:0%
closures business closures mandated
 
00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:17.560 align:start position:0%
masks mandated vaccines if you wanted to
 
00:34:21.109 --> 00:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
keep your job in many many places so
 
00:34:24.669 --> 00:34:24.679 align:start position:0%
this is a preemptive statement that we
 
00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:27.839 align:start position:0%
should make up our own minds about what
 
00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
our policy should be and not ever let a
 
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
an outside International
 
00:34:38.629 --> 00:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
Organization mandate what we should do
 
00:34:41.589 --> 00:34:41.599 align:start position:0%
and certainly it sounded like uh some of
 
00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
the organizations did try to do that so
 
00:34:47.470 --> 00:34:47.480 align:start position:0%
this is a protection for future for
 
00:34:49.950 --> 00:34:49.960 align:start position:0%
future needs the next time we have to
 
00:34:52.149 --> 00:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
deal with something that the world is
 
00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
concerned about and thinks they have the
 
00:34:57.430 --> 00:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
solution we need to be able to think of
 
00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:00.520 align:start position:0%
what really is our best our best and
 
00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:02.920 align:start position:0%
safest course all right thank you
 
00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:04.480 align:start position:0%

00:36:51.109 --> 00:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
change um uh so our concern is really
 
00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:52.440 align:start position:0%
whether this would have a chilling
 
00:36:54.910 --> 00:36:54.920 align:start position:0%
effect on any action at the local level
 
00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:56.640 align:start position:0%
um to address issues that impact that
 
00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
Community even when would be supported
 
00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:00.520 align:start position:0%
by a majority of residents and local
 
00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
leaders um so I um I'll end my testimony
 
00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much and um hopefully
 
00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:09.280 align:start position:0%
if you do have any questions I might be
 
00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
able to answer great thank you very much
 
00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
are there questions for this
 
00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:16.040 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
ma'am thank you uh next I'm going to
 
00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman committee members Aubrey
 
00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:33.560 align:start position:0%
Friedman I live in Bridgewater I speak
 
00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
in support of this bill so as was
 
00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned we don't have control over the
 
00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh Federal you know what goes on with
 
00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
the elections administrations come and
 
00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
go members of congress come and go and
 
00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:50.200 align:start position:0%
we should be concerned with the future
 
00:37:52.589 --> 00:37:52.599 align:start position:0%
because maybe things might be okay for a
 
00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
while but politics change these three
 
00:37:58.150 --> 00:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
organizations are all rad
 
00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
and we should not they should not have
 
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction here in New Hampshire
 
00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
especially when it comes to like
 
00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:07.000 align:start position:0%
mandates okay the world hor excuse me
 
00:38:10.589 --> 00:38:10.599 align:start position:0%
World Health Organization so they didn't
 
00:38:13.069 --> 00:38:13.079 align:start position:0%
do a great job during the pandemic and
 
00:38:15.589 --> 00:38:15.599 align:start position:0%
they've been working on this uh pandemic
 
00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:20.680 align:start position:0%
response uh uh treaty or excuse me uh uh
 
00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:22.200 align:start position:0%
agreement to try to get all the
 
00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:24.200 align:start position:0%
countries to sign on they've been trying
 
00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
for the last couple of years they have
 
00:38:29.349 --> 00:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
not been very successful a lot of uh
 
00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:32.200 align:start position:0%
countries did not want to sign on to it
 
00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
um they've tried to change it a little
 
00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:36.440 align:start position:0%
bit in the last year to make it more
 
00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:39.720 align:start position:0%
easy to swallow for countries to sign on
 
00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:42.040 align:start position:0%
and uh but they're they've not really
 
00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
changed at all I went to some of the the
 
00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:48.440 align:start position:0%
earlier one uh zero draft and I've got
 
00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:50.680 align:start position:0%
it as part of my backup I'll pass out
 
00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:54.440 align:start position:0%
afterwards and you look at article 17 it
 
00:38:57.630 --> 00:38:57.640 align:start position:0%
talks about pandemic literacy
 
00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
implementation of public awareness
 
00:39:03.069 --> 00:39:03.079 align:start position:0%
programs this is propaganda this is and
 
00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:05.720 align:start position:0%
that's that is their thing if you do not
 
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
sign on to what how they think the
 
00:39:12.349 --> 00:39:12.359 align:start position:0%
response should be to any uh pandemic or
 
00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
big uh outbreak that happens you're in
 
00:39:18.430 --> 00:39:18.440 align:start position:0%
trouble I mean it's one just like it was
 
00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic the conspiracy
 
00:39:21.829 --> 00:39:21.839 align:start position:0%
theories and all that if you didn't
 
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
agree with them article 18 talks about
 
00:39:29.589 --> 00:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
uh National and Community levels this
 
00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
one Health Plan again they have one idea
 
00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
for the whole globe and if you don't
 
00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:38.720 align:start position:0%
sign on to it you're you know this is
 
00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:40.640 align:start position:0%
you'd be actually in violation if you
 
00:39:43.790 --> 00:39:43.800 align:start position:0%
signed on and unfortunately do not they
 
00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:45.960 align:start position:0%
do not consider the health of everyone
 
00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
because maybe you read about the $250
 
00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
that wh paid out to the Congo Vic
 
00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
victims of sexual abuse so evidently
 
00:39:58.910 --> 00:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
they consider the of everyone except the
 
00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:01.240 align:start position:0%
people that their employees interact
 
00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
with uh sexual abuse and that was in the
 
00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
Congo during the Abola outbreak okay the
 
00:40:09.829 --> 00:40:09.839 align:start position:0%
UN they have not been all that
 
00:40:12.109 --> 00:40:12.119 align:start position:0%
successful in the purpose of preventing
 
00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
Wars obviously but they've been pushing
 
00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
the Small Arms treaties for years uh the
 
00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
last one was in 2021 sir you seem to be
 
00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:23.200 align:start position:0%
getting a little bit off the subject
 
00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
here of what this bill is about oh okay
 
00:40:29.109 --> 00:40:29.119 align:start position:0%
um well I just wanted to mention each of
 
00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:32.440 align:start position:0%
the three uh I talked about the who I'll
 
00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
just make a brief then okay the don't
 
00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
like the UN I I think we got it okay
 
00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:40.280 align:start position:0%
okay and the Small Arms treaties okay
 
00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:43.000 align:start position:0%
and then the world economic Forum uh
 
00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
everybody knows about the great reset
 
00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
they scrubed that from the their website
 
00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:50.720 align:start position:0%
and but you cannot ignore uh you know
 
00:40:53.790 --> 00:40:53.800 align:start position:0%
it's still out on the internet CL schab
 
00:40:57.349 --> 00:40:57.359 align:start position:0%
his statement uh from 2020 the pandemic
 
00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:01.240 align:start position:0%
represents a rare but narrow window of
 
00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:04.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to reflect reimagine and
 
00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
reset our world so people were dying and
 
00:41:10.309 --> 00:41:10.319 align:start position:0%
this guy is talking about opportunities
 
00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
so this organization has not changed um
 
00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:16.200 align:start position:0%
they're collectivists and they are
 
00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
Elites so I think New Hampshire needs to
 
00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
protect ourselves and our sovereignty
 
00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
those those organizations are not having
 
00:41:27.349 --> 00:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
be able to reach into
 
00:41:30.829 --> 00:41:30.839 align:start position:0%
how we deal with uh health or anything
 
00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
and that's why I support the bill all
 
00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
right thank you questions for this way
 
00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:36.200 align:start position:0%
representative Oregon um yeah so the
 
00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
world economic forum is if is know it's
 
00:41:41.589 --> 00:41:41.599 align:start position:0%
a private foundation and um I guess you
 
00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
have doubts about it is there a question
 
00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
yes would you support are there any
 
00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:49.480 align:start position:0%
other uh foundations that we should add
 
00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
to the list like maybe per perhaps Elon
 
00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:54.200 align:start position:0%
Musk musk Foundation or anything I think
 
00:41:56.670 --> 00:41:56.680 align:start position:0%
that's I I think that's out of we can
 
00:41:58.750 --> 00:41:58.760 align:start position:0%
stick with no no I think that question
 
00:41:59.829 --> 00:41:59.839 align:start position:0%
was out of order we don't need a
 
00:42:01.630 --> 00:42:01.640 align:start position:0%
response is there any other any any
 
00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:04.040 align:start position:0%
other questions all right thank seeing
 
00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:06.200 align:start position:0%
none thank you very much sir thank you
 
00:42:08.349 --> 00:42:08.359 align:start position:0%
all right is there anyone else who
 
00:42:09.829 --> 00:42:09.839 align:start position:0%
wishes to I don't have any other pin
 
00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
cards anyone else who wishes to be heard
 
00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
on HB 584
 
00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:17.000 align:start position:0%
FN seeing none I'm going to close the
 
00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:20.720 align:start position:0%
hearing on HB 584 FN and we're a little
 
00:42:23.790 --> 00:42:23.800 align:start position:0%
early so we can't open the hearing on
 
00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:28.040 align:start position:0%
580 um so um you know what just uh just
 
00:42:31.069 --> 00:42:31.079 align:start position:0%
to give everybody a kind of a a a
 
00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:35.000 align:start position:0%
preview of what I'm what I'm thinking um
 
00:42:37.950 --> 00:42:37.960 align:start position:0%
here here's what here's what I would uh
 
00:42:39.549 --> 00:42:39.559 align:start position:0%
oh okay I'm sorry so here's what I'm
 
00:42:41.230 --> 00:42:41.240 align:start position:0%
thinking I would like to do assuming
 
00:42:44.109 --> 00:42:44.119 align:start position:0%
that you know things kind of work out um
 
00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
we'll have the hearing at starting at
 
00:42:48.829 --> 00:42:48.839 align:start position:0%
10:15 on the next bill then at 11
 
00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
o'clock we'll start our executive
 
00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
session what I would like to try to do
 
00:42:57.950 --> 00:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
um is is to get through what it seems
 
00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
like based upon my discussions with my
 
00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
caucus and now also my discussion with
 
00:43:03.870 --> 00:43:03.880 align:start position:0%
the ranking member things that there may
 
00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
not be a lot of dispute on try to get
 
00:43:09.309 --> 00:43:09.319 align:start position:0%
through that as quickly as we can um if
 
00:43:12.829 --> 00:43:12.839 align:start position:0%
that takes us to say and we'll go until
 
00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
say 12 o'clock maybe we'll be able to
 
00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:16.640 align:start position:0%
get through a lot of other stuff then I
 
00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:18.640 align:start position:0%
would propose that we take a brief
 
00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:21.880 align:start position:0%
recess at noon so that uh uh people can
 
00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:25.480 align:start position:0%
have their lunch and that so um if
 
00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:27.800 align:start position:0%
anybody wants to caucus on the two bills
 
00:43:29.109 --> 00:43:29.119 align:start position:0%
that we're hearing this morning before
 
00:43:30.549 --> 00:43:30.559 align:start position:0%
we exec them they'll have an opportunity
 
00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
to do that over lunch then we'll resume
 
00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:36.200 align:start position:0%
about 12:30 and and finish up and I'm
 
00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:36.910 align:start position:0%
about 12:30 and and finish up and I'm
what

00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:36.920 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
I'm really hoping we can do because I
 
00:43:41.309 --> 00:43:41.319 align:start position:0%
suspect a number of people on both sides
 
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
of the aisle here would like to get to
 
00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
the budget hearing at 2 o'clock I
 
00:43:47.790 --> 00:43:47.800 align:start position:0%
certainly would so I'm hoping that
 
00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:49.640 align:start position:0%
that'll be a way that we can get all get
 
00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
through all of this and still be done by
 
00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
2 o'clock so those of us who want to go
 
00:43:54.910 --> 00:43:54.920 align:start position:0%
to the budget hearing can do that okay
 
00:43:56.549 --> 00:43:56.559 align:start position:0%
that's kind of where I'm thinking so
 
00:43:58.190 --> 00:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
let's take we'll take about 3 minutes
 
00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:56.030 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:56.040 --> 00:45:25.950 align:start position:0%

domestic violence and sexual violence
 
00:47:28.870 --> 00:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
representative burough I'm going to call
 
00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:42.270 --> 00:47:42.280 align:start position:0%
sponsor thank you Mr chair and members
 
00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
of the committee um for the record um uh
 
00:47:46.750 --> 00:47:46.760 align:start position:0%
representative Anita burrow from
 
00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
Bartlett um actually Glenn which is part
 
00:47:51.349 --> 00:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
of Bartlett and I am here today to
 
00:47:55.549 --> 00:47:55.559 align:start position:0%
testify on HB 580 um this is a bill that
 
00:47:58.630 --> 00:47:58.640 align:start position:0%
seeks to prevent retaliatory defamation
 
00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:00.520 align:start position:0%
for individuals who are reporting
 
00:48:03.309 --> 00:48:03.319 align:start position:0%
misconduct sexual assault sexual abuse
 
00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
sexual harassment or domestic violence
 
00:48:08.190 --> 00:48:08.200 align:start position:0%
and I think the two key parts of this
 
00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:11.000 align:start position:0%
bill are that it ensures that
 
00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:13.400 align:start position:0%
individuals who speak out about their
 
00:48:17.309 --> 00:48:17.319 align:start position:0%
sexual assault and sexual H harassment
 
00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
are not silenced by the possibility of a
 
00:48:22.309 --> 00:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
defamation lawsuit as long as their
 
00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
statements are made in good faith and
 
00:48:27.190 --> 00:48:27.200 align:start position:0%
without malice I think that's key and
 
00:48:28.910 --> 00:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
the second thing that this does which I
 
00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
think is really important um um which
 
00:48:34.309 --> 00:48:34.319 align:start position:0%
the ACLU pointed out to me to help help
 
00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
with this said that this also s
 
00:48:39.069 --> 00:48:39.079 align:start position:0%
safeguards the right for someone to
 
00:48:41.790 --> 00:48:41.800 align:start position:0%
defend their name and it allows those
 
00:48:44.829 --> 00:48:44.839 align:start position:0%
accused of sexual assault or sexual
 
00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:47.240 align:start position:0%
harassment to publicly Proclaim their
 
00:48:49.309 --> 00:48:49.319 align:start position:0%
innocence without fear of meritless
 
00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
defamation claims provided that their
 
00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
statements are made in good faith and
 
00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:54.390 align:start position:0%
statements are made in good faith and
without

00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
without
 
00:48:57.750 --> 00:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
malice so how did this bill come to us
 
00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:01.400 align:start position:0%
um quick story um I um our group of
 
00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:04.240 align:start position:0%
sponsors was contacted by uh a survivor
 
00:49:07.829 --> 00:49:07.839 align:start position:0%
of sexual assault she is somebody who um
 
00:49:10.789 --> 00:49:10.799 align:start position:0%
was asked to go for a drink with a long
 
00:49:12.910 --> 00:49:12.920 align:start position:0%
long-term colleague of hers both of them
 
00:49:15.549 --> 00:49:15.559 align:start position:0%
were attorneys the next thing she knew
 
00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
she woke up in a hospital with a coma in
 
00:49:20.789 --> 00:49:20.799 align:start position:0%
a coma she had been sexually assaulted
 
00:49:22.309 --> 00:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
um and she she didn't come out of the
 
00:49:25.549 --> 00:49:25.559 align:start position:0%
coma for several days and what she said
 
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
was her immediate reaction was that she
 
00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
wanted to she wanted to go to court
 
00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:31.640 align:start position:0%
against this individual who she had
 
00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
known for 10 years and a colleague of
 
00:49:35.430 --> 00:49:35.440 align:start position:0%
hers who was also attorney said you
 
00:49:37.390 --> 00:49:37.400 align:start position:0%
don't want to do this it's going to blow
 
00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
up this person is high-profile you
 
00:49:41.349 --> 00:49:41.359 align:start position:0%
should just keep your mouth shut which
 
00:49:43.789 --> 00:49:43.799 align:start position:0%
is what she did and then she found out
 
00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:45.720 align:start position:0%
that another person had had the exact
 
00:49:48.430 --> 00:49:48.440 align:start position:0%
same experience and she was
 
00:49:50.990 --> 00:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
mortified um and and angry at herself
 
00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
that she had not gone forward uh with
 
00:49:56.990 --> 00:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
pressing the charges so she made it her
 
00:49:59.950 --> 00:49:59.960 align:start position:0%
to try to pass laws um that would help
 
00:50:03.430 --> 00:50:03.440 align:start position:0%
protect people from from um being scared
 
00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
away from Anti-Defamation
 
00:50:08.589 --> 00:50:08.599 align:start position:0%
lawsuits um now I'm sure people in this
 
00:50:10.069 --> 00:50:10.079 align:start position:0%
committee know what retaliatory
 
00:50:12.190 --> 00:50:12.200 align:start position:0%
defamation is but for the record it
 
00:50:13.950 --> 00:50:13.960 align:start position:0%
refers to when somebody files a
 
00:50:15.870 --> 00:50:15.880 align:start position:0%
defamation lawsuit against another
 
00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:18.160 align:start position:0%
person specifically as a means of
 
00:50:20.309 --> 00:50:20.319 align:start position:0%
punishment for that person using the
 
00:50:22.910 --> 00:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
defamation claim as a tool to silence or
 
00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
intimidate them it's considered a form
 
00:50:27.309 --> 00:50:27.319 align:start position:0%
of retaliation
 
00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
when false statements are used to harm
 
00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
the other person's reputation in
 
00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:33.400 align:start position:0%
response to their action and as you know
 
00:50:35.950 --> 00:50:35.960 align:start position:0%
these are these are anti-sap laws and
 
00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
that's a legal mechanism that allows um
 
00:50:40.750 --> 00:50:40.760 align:start position:0%
that allows a defendant to intimidate or
 
00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
silence criticism through is often what
 
00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
is often expensive litigation and again
 
00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that you folks follow the news
 
00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:50.720 align:start position:0%
there's been some very high profile
 
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
cases involving uh defamation lawsuits
 
00:50:56.510 --> 00:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
there was Johnny Depp versus Amber herd
 
00:50:59.710 --> 00:50:59.720 align:start position:0%
um and very recently there are two very
 
00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
prominent real estate brokers uh from
 
00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
Miami and New York the Alexander Twins
 
00:51:07.589 --> 00:51:07.599 align:start position:0%
and and a brother of theirs um who the
 
00:51:10.270 --> 00:51:10.280 align:start position:0%
the lawsuits against them piling up and
 
00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
they uh attempted defamatory lawsuits uh
 
00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
particularly against the first person
 
00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:17.880 align:start position:0%
who made notion of their activities they
 
00:51:19.549 --> 00:51:19.559 align:start position:0%
made went to Great Lanes to track them
 
00:51:24.030 --> 00:51:24.040 align:start position:0%
down and to um um to uh try to
 
00:51:28.430 --> 00:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
intimidate them through legal action
 
00:51:30.270 --> 00:51:30.280 align:start position:0%
and now the law makes actually makes it
 
00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
easier for a private figure than a
 
00:51:35.109 --> 00:51:35.119 align:start position:0%
public figure to sue someone for
 
00:51:37.470 --> 00:51:37.480 align:start position:0%
defamation that's because when public
 
00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
figures are in the news they can often
 
00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
tell their account of the story and
 
00:51:46.589 --> 00:51:46.599 align:start position:0%
whereas somebody in in a somebody in a a
 
00:51:48.309 --> 00:51:48.319 align:start position:0%
um who's not a public fever doesn't have
 
00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
that options and as I mentioned there
 
00:51:52.829 --> 00:51:52.839 align:start position:0%
are many compelling stories of victims
 
00:51:55.069 --> 00:51:55.079 align:start position:0%
who did not report an assault who who
 
00:51:57.829 --> 00:51:57.839 align:start position:0%
declined to move forward with action for
 
00:52:01.150 --> 00:52:01.160 align:start position:0%
fear of retaliatory action now the um
 
00:52:03.710 --> 00:52:03.720 align:start position:0%
salent may be somebody who's who's uh
 
00:52:05.789 --> 00:52:05.799 align:start position:0%
high-profile in the community it could
 
00:52:09.349 --> 00:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
be somebody's boss um so the power the
 
00:52:11.589 --> 00:52:11.599 align:start position:0%
power play there is um there's a
 
00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
differential in power there and they
 
00:52:17.069 --> 00:52:17.079 align:start position:0%
people know how much it's going to cost
 
00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
to have a lawsuit and uh could be three
 
00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
figures four figures five people five
 
00:52:24.549 --> 00:52:24.559 align:start position:0%
figures and a lot of these women don't
 
00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
have I shouldn't say women it's men and
 
00:52:27.950 --> 00:52:27.960 align:start position:0%
women um know that they're not going to
 
00:52:31.309 --> 00:52:31.319 align:start position:0%
be able to afford that so um as I said
 
00:52:34.390 --> 00:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
um this this uh Bill provides two
 
00:52:36.430 --> 00:52:36.440 align:start position:0%
essential protections it protects
 
00:52:38.349 --> 00:52:38.359 align:start position:0%
Survivors by ensuring that those who
 
00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
speak out are not silenced by frivolous
 
00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
defamation law students again as I said
 
00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
previous if their statements are made in
 
00:52:47.589 --> 00:52:47.599 align:start position:0%
good faith and without malice it also
 
00:52:50.309 --> 00:52:50.319 align:start position:0%
safeguards the right to defense one name
 
00:52:56.549 --> 00:52:56.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
as long as it is done without malice so
 
00:53:04.309 --> 00:53:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:07.069 --> 00:53:07.079 align:start position:0%
else so that that basically is it it in
 
00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
a nutshell um I gave I passed out um I
 
00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
don't know if I think most of you got it
 
00:53:12.990 --> 00:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
I passed out statistics from the
 
00:53:15.630 --> 00:53:15.640 align:start position:0%
national women's um organization about
 
00:53:17.109 --> 00:53:17.119 align:start position:0%
the prevalence of these um
 
00:53:19.549 --> 00:53:19.559 align:start position:0%
Anti-Defamation lawsuits they're in
 
00:53:21.549 --> 00:53:21.559 align:start position:0%
growing a number it's hard to have
 
00:53:24.030 --> 00:53:24.040 align:start position:0%
statistics here in in New Hampshire but
 
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:26.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of them n of them initially came
 
00:53:28.470 --> 00:53:28.480 align:start position:0%
from uh college campuses but the
 
00:53:30.789 --> 00:53:30.799 align:start position:0%
national statistics show that that that
 
00:53:33.470 --> 00:53:33.480 align:start position:0%
that is widening to other types of cases
 
00:53:35.589 --> 00:53:35.599 align:start position:0%
and so I I think it's important that
 
00:53:38.349 --> 00:53:38.359 align:start position:0%
victims H are able to come forward
 
00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
without concern about um they're they're
 
00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
dealing with a sexual assault they don't
 
00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
need to deal with a frivolous um
 
00:53:47.150 --> 00:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
Anti-Defamation case on top of that so I
 
00:53:48.990 --> 00:53:49.000 align:start position:0%
will end my testimony here all right
 
00:53:51.150 --> 00:53:51.160 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness
 
00:53:55.390 --> 00:53:55.400 align:start position:0%
representative bur thank you Mr chair uh
 
00:53:57.270 --> 00:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bur
 
00:53:59.710 --> 00:53:59.720 align:start position:0%
uh for those who didn't uh get a chance
 
00:54:03.430 --> 00:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
to necessarily see the email uh that you
 
00:54:05.789 --> 00:54:05.799 align:start position:0%
sent around with the statistics could
 
00:54:10.910 --> 00:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
you give the committee a flavor of
 
00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
both how big a problem this is and how
 
00:54:18.510 --> 00:54:18.520 align:start position:0%
many states have sought to address this
 
00:54:21.349 --> 00:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
problem through similar legislation sure
 
00:54:23.349 --> 00:54:23.359 align:start position:0%
I'll just pick out some key key points
 
00:54:28.109 --> 00:54:28.119 align:start position:0%
here um as I said before um7 7 75% of
 
00:54:30.829 --> 00:54:30.839 align:start position:0%
defa defamation lawsuits were F filed by
 
00:54:33.309 --> 00:54:33.319 align:start position:0%
male college students and faculty who
 
00:54:34.910 --> 00:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
had been been reported for sexual
 
00:54:37.230 --> 00:54:37.240 align:start position:0%
harassment or assault and since then
 
00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
these suits have been coming in Faster
 
00:54:43.630 --> 00:54:43.640 align:start position:0%
it's broadened um defamation in S I know
 
00:54:45.069 --> 00:54:45.079 align:start position:0%
these are some of these are old figures
 
00:54:47.789 --> 00:54:47.799 align:start position:0%
but um as of 2017 they saw that the
 
00:54:51.069 --> 00:54:51.079 align:start position:0%
defamation uh lawsuits had re risen from
 
00:54:55.470 --> 00:54:55.480 align:start position:0%
5% of of um case loads over the the last
 
00:54:57.320 --> 00:54:57.330 align:start position:0%
few years of that
 
00:54:57.330 --> 00:54:58.510 align:start position:0%
few years of that
[Music]

00:54:58.510 --> 00:54:58.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:55:01.630 --> 00:55:01.640 align:start position:0%
um a 2020 report found that being sued
 
00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
for defamation is the third most common
 
00:55:06.549 --> 00:55:06.559 align:start position:0%
form of retaliation reported by sexual
 
00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
survivors in the workplace and again you
 
00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:12.310 align:start position:0%
often have that unequal balance of power
 
00:55:12.310 --> 00:55:14.270 align:start position:0%
often have that unequal balance of power
[Music]

00:55:14.270 --> 00:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
um 2018 the United the uh un special uh
 
00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
report called the act of threatening
 
00:55:23.349 --> 00:55:23.359 align:start position:0%
survivors with legal pro pro proceedings
 
00:55:26.910 --> 00:55:26.920 align:start position:0%
a form of uh gender bias I don't want to
 
00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:35.109 --> 00:55:35.119 align:start position:0%
uh you know I think some of this uh some
 
00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
of this kind of um expanded with the me
 
00:55:40.430 --> 00:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
too movement um and uh New
 
00:55:42.589 --> 00:55:42.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the one interesting thing that
 
00:55:45.230 --> 00:55:45.240 align:start position:0%
I found is that New Hampshire is a among
 
00:55:47.309 --> 00:55:47.319 align:start position:0%
a minority of states that doesn't have
 
00:55:49.710 --> 00:55:49.720 align:start position:0%
any kind of anti-sap law so I think
 
00:55:52.270 --> 00:55:52.280 align:start position:0%
that's that's an interesting statistic
 
00:55:54.829 --> 00:55:54.839 align:start position:0%
um so anyway you can go forth and read
 
00:55:56.950 --> 00:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
about some of the other states but I I
 
00:55:58.630 --> 00:55:58.640 align:start position:0%
think the I've said it a couple of times
 
00:56:00.549 --> 00:56:00.559 align:start position:0%
I think the two keys here are that we're
 
00:56:02.549 --> 00:56:02.559 align:start position:0%
not only protecting the rights of
 
00:56:04.109 --> 00:56:04.119 align:start position:0%
victims we're protecting the rights of
 
00:56:07.069 --> 00:56:07.079 align:start position:0%
those who are falsely accused to to file
 
00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
a lawsuit we're not trying to prevent
 
00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
that okay all right other questions for
 
00:56:13.630 --> 00:56:13.640 align:start position:0%
this witness see that so I guess I have
 
00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
a question and um the the problem that I
 
00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
have with all of what you're saying is
 
00:56:27.670 --> 00:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
you're can you can you sort of tell us
 
00:56:30.109 --> 00:56:30.119 align:start position:0%
where you say that you know
 
00:56:35.470 --> 00:56:35.480 align:start position:0%
75% of the lawsuits are are uh file were
 
00:56:39.829 --> 00:56:39.839 align:start position:0%
defamation lawsuits were filed U by uh
 
00:56:42.349 --> 00:56:42.359 align:start position:0%
people accused of sexual assault against
 
00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
their accusers I guess my question
 
00:56:49.950 --> 00:56:49.960 align:start position:0%
is unless a tribunal of some kind has
 
00:56:53.109 --> 00:56:53.119 align:start position:0%
decided that a somebody committed a
 
00:56:56.750 --> 00:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
sexual assault and therefore B that the
 
00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
person is a victim how do we know
 
00:57:03.109 --> 00:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
whether those whether you know when
 
00:57:05.109 --> 00:57:05.119 align:start position:0%
somebody has made a claim of sexual
 
00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
assault that it's true and how do we
 
00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
know that it's not true I mean that's
 
00:57:14.069 --> 00:57:14.079 align:start position:0%
that's the problem I have this seems to
 
00:57:17.750 --> 00:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
this seems to shift the
 
00:57:21.470 --> 00:57:21.480 align:start position:0%
balance against the person making um
 
00:57:23.430 --> 00:57:23.440 align:start position:0%
against the person that's
 
00:57:27.109 --> 00:57:27.119 align:start position:0%
accused um where there really doesn't
 
00:57:30.349 --> 00:57:30.359 align:start position:0%
seem to be any we don't know whether
 
00:57:33.789 --> 00:57:33.799 align:start position:0%
that claim is true or not so how do we
 
00:57:35.190 --> 00:57:35.200 align:start position:0%
that's the thing I have the most problem
 
00:57:37.349 --> 00:57:37.359 align:start position:0%
with not not being an attorney I guess I
 
00:57:40.109 --> 00:57:40.119 align:start position:0%
would answer that by saying that perhaps
 
00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
in cases where there's a preponderance
 
00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:45.440 align:start position:0%
of evidence including um DNA and um
 
00:57:47.150 --> 00:57:47.160 align:start position:0%
maybe eyewitnesses and that kind of
 
00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
thing there would be definitive evidence
 
00:57:53.069 --> 00:57:53.079 align:start position:0%
that that um that something happened we
 
00:57:56.670 --> 00:57:56.680 align:start position:0%
don't know exactly what um and that uh a
 
00:58:00.510 --> 00:58:00.520 align:start position:0%
defamation a defamation lawsuit um is
 
00:58:02.950 --> 00:58:02.960 align:start position:0%
not Merit is not not merited right but
 
00:58:04.549 --> 00:58:04.559 align:start position:0%
but that's but this bill doesn't say
 
00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
anything about having that kind of
 
00:58:07.950 --> 00:58:07.960 align:start position:0%
evidence right this this just says that
 
00:58:11.190 --> 00:58:11.200 align:start position:0%
you've made the accusation so I I I'm
 
00:58:12.510 --> 00:58:12.520 align:start position:0%
I'm just Cur and I understand you're not
 
00:58:14.349 --> 00:58:14.359 align:start position:0%
a lawyer and I don't mean to put you on
 
00:58:17.630 --> 00:58:17.640 align:start position:0%
but for example are were you aware that
 
00:58:20.789 --> 00:58:20.799 align:start position:0%
for example if somebody is accused of
 
00:58:23.950 --> 00:58:23.960 align:start position:0%
sexual assault and is actually
 
00:58:26.789 --> 00:58:26.799 align:start position:0%
convicted that person would
 
00:58:29.390 --> 00:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
could not bring a lawsuit for defamation
 
00:58:31.390 --> 00:58:31.400 align:start position:0%
because it would be summarily dismissed
 
00:58:35.630 --> 00:58:35.640 align:start position:0%
on collateral stoppable grounds so it's
 
00:58:38.150 --> 00:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
I mean and and you know one one very
 
00:58:41.190 --> 00:58:41.200 align:start position:0%
prominent public example of that is uh
 
00:58:44.190 --> 00:58:44.200 align:start position:0%
the the lawsuit uh for sexual assault
 
00:58:45.670 --> 00:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
brought brought again brought against
 
00:58:48.589 --> 00:58:48.599 align:start position:0%
the president who was found liable and
 
00:58:50.710 --> 00:58:50.720 align:start position:0%
he then tried to bring a lawsuit for
 
00:58:52.750 --> 00:58:52.760 align:start position:0%
defamation against the victim and that
 
00:58:55.670 --> 00:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
was thrown out on on either a motion to
 
00:58:57.390 --> 00:58:57.400 align:start position:0%
dismiss or summary judgment because he
 
00:58:59.789 --> 00:58:59.799 align:start position:0%
had already been found liable
 
00:59:05.950 --> 00:59:05.960 align:start position:0%
so I my concern is that this seems to
 
00:59:09.870 --> 00:59:09.880 align:start position:0%
me to say it it it it's sort of along
 
00:59:13.029 --> 00:59:13.039 align:start position:0%
the lines of well if I claim to be a v a
 
00:59:15.470 --> 00:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
victim even though I don't have to
 
00:59:18.430 --> 00:59:18.440 align:start position:0%
actually prove it anywhere I get this
 
00:59:21.630 --> 00:59:21.640 align:start position:0%
protection and that is a real concern to
 
00:59:24.270 --> 00:59:24.280 align:start position:0%
me okay can I let me ask you this cuz
 
00:59:26.470 --> 00:59:26.480 align:start position:0%
your your background if we tweaked
 
00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
language in terms of putting in
 
00:59:29.390 --> 00:59:29.400 align:start position:0%
something about preponderance of
 
00:59:31.870 --> 00:59:31.880 align:start position:0%
evidence would that would that be make a
 
00:59:34.670 --> 00:59:34.680 align:start position:0%
difference well the I mean I the problem
 
00:59:37.510 --> 00:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
with that is the the way that you would
 
00:59:39.029 --> 00:59:39.039 align:start position:0%
determine whether there was a
 
00:59:41.029 --> 00:59:41.039 align:start position:0%
preponderance of the evidence is through
 
00:59:44.349 --> 00:59:44.359 align:start position:0%
a legal proceeding in other words that's
 
00:59:47.230 --> 00:59:47.240 align:start position:0%
what that's the whole purpose of of
 
00:59:50.069 --> 00:59:50.079 align:start position:0%
either you know if if you if you claim
 
00:59:51.870 --> 00:59:51.880 align:start position:0%
that you're a victim of sexual
 
00:59:54.990 --> 00:59:55.000 align:start position:0%
assault you can bring either a criminal
 
00:59:56.390 --> 00:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
you can you can go to the police and
 
00:59:57.950 --> 00:59:57.960 align:start position:0%
asked for a criminal prosecution to be
 
01:00:00.069 --> 01:00:00.079 align:start position:0%
brought or you can bring your own civil
 
01:00:01.950 --> 01:00:01.960 align:start position:0%
lawsuit against the person you claim
 
01:00:05.349 --> 01:00:05.359 align:start position:0%
assaulted you and the the process in
 
01:00:07.829 --> 01:00:07.839 align:start position:0%
which it would be determined whether
 
01:00:09.309 --> 01:00:09.319 align:start position:0%
there was a preponderance of the
 
01:00:12.510 --> 01:00:12.520 align:start position:0%
evidence is that proceeding so it you
 
01:00:15.309 --> 01:00:15.319 align:start position:0%
know it's it's hard for me to understand
 
01:00:18.270 --> 01:00:18.280 align:start position:0%
how one would ever establish a
 
01:00:20.510 --> 01:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
preponderance of evidence unless you
 
01:00:23.390 --> 01:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
actually went to court so I guess that
 
01:00:25.029 --> 01:00:25.039 align:start position:0%
goes back to how do we solve this
 
01:00:27.910 --> 01:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
problem of people being scared to come
 
01:00:30.789 --> 01:00:30.799 align:start position:0%
forward and tell their stories and
 
01:00:33.150 --> 01:00:33.160 align:start position:0%
eventually prosecute somebody may maybe
 
01:00:35.230 --> 01:00:35.240 align:start position:0%
be able to prosecute someone if they're
 
01:00:37.270 --> 01:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
being scared off by these six figure
 
01:00:40.029 --> 01:00:40.039 align:start position:0%
lawsuits is there do you see any way
 
01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:42.440 align:start position:0%
that we could protect their a person's
 
01:00:44.470 --> 01:00:44.480 align:start position:0%
right to come forward and do the suit
 
01:00:46.789 --> 01:00:46.799 align:start position:0%
and at the same time making sure that
 
01:00:49.069 --> 01:00:49.079 align:start position:0%
these victims have a voice and that
 
01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:51.240 align:start position:0%
they're not silenc by this kind of
 
01:00:53.630 --> 01:00:53.640 align:start position:0%
intimidation which is very
 
01:00:57.190 --> 01:00:57.200 align:start position:0%
powerful it's it I agree that it's a
 
01:01:00.829 --> 01:01:00.839 align:start position:0%
it's a it's an important issue I'm just
 
01:01:02.270 --> 01:01:02.280 align:start position:0%
not sure that
 
01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
this you know is is the personally that
 
01:01:06.789 --> 01:01:06.799 align:start position:0%
this is the answer I can only speak for
 
01:01:09.990 --> 01:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
myself representative Manos thank you Mr
 
01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.710 align:start position:0%
myself representative Manos thank you Mr
chair

01:01:11.710 --> 01:01:11.720 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:01:15.069 --> 01:01:15.079 align:start position:0%
um um I think what's
 
01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
envisioned I think what's envisioned by
 
01:01:21.069 --> 01:01:21.079 align:start position:0%
this is that the victim comes forward
 
01:01:24.309 --> 01:01:24.319 align:start position:0%
files a civil suit against the
 
01:01:27.069 --> 01:01:27.079 align:start position:0%
perpetrator and the per perpetrator and
 
01:01:30.750 --> 01:01:30.760 align:start position:0%
while that civil suit is pending the
 
01:01:33.470 --> 01:01:33.480 align:start position:0%
perpetrator or the alleged perpetrator
 
01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
then files a defamation suit or
 
01:01:39.670 --> 01:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
threatens to file a defamation suit and
 
01:01:41.870 --> 01:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
so what happens is that the victim is
 
01:01:45.670 --> 01:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
then very reluctant to initially pursue
 
01:01:48.750 --> 01:01:48.760 align:start position:0%
the civil suit in which as you point out
 
01:01:51.630 --> 01:01:51.640 align:start position:0%
a judgment would be made by a jury as to
 
01:01:54.549 --> 01:01:54.559 align:start position:0%
whether there's uh a preponderance of
 
01:01:56.510 --> 01:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
the evidence to support
 
01:01:58.950 --> 01:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
to support the victim's claim and I
 
01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
think this is this is an
 
01:02:05.230 --> 01:02:05.240 align:start position:0%
intervention to solve that problem where
 
01:02:10.829 --> 01:02:10.839 align:start position:0%
the threat of litigation uh excuse me um
 
01:02:12.990 --> 01:02:13.000 align:start position:0%
discourages the victim from even
 
01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
initially filing the civil suit yeah
 
01:02:18.390 --> 01:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
yeah well I mean I hear what you're
 
01:02:20.829 --> 01:02:20.839 align:start position:0%
saying but it doesn't it it said a
 
01:02:23.589 --> 01:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
victim or other person reporting an
 
01:02:25.230 --> 01:02:25.240 align:start position:0%
alleged perpetrator's misconduct
 
01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
reporting what does that mean that
 
01:02:28.230 --> 01:02:28.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily mean starting a suit
 
01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
maybe it means report you know reporting
 
01:02:32.230 --> 01:02:32.240 align:start position:0%
to the news media somebody has sexually
 
01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:34.720 align:start position:0%
assaulted me and and the thing I have
 
01:02:37.269 --> 01:02:37.279 align:start position:0%
the real the most significant problem
 
01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
with shall be presumed to have acted in
 
01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.510 align:start position:0%
with shall be presumed to have acted in
good

01:02:41.510 --> 01:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
good
 
01:02:47.069 --> 01:02:47.079 align:start position:0%
faith wow I mean um that that does seem
 
01:02:50.950 --> 01:02:50.960 align:start position:0%
to me to be I I don't get me wrong I'm I
 
01:02:54.190 --> 01:02:54.200 align:start position:0%
think that there's a lot of of of people
 
01:02:56.710 --> 01:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
who are victims who are acting a good F
 
01:02:59.109 --> 01:02:59.119 align:start position:0%
I don't doubt that for a minute
 
01:03:02.750 --> 01:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
but presumed I mean that's isn't that's
 
01:03:04.269 --> 01:03:04.279 align:start position:0%
that's why we generally put the burden
 
01:03:06.430 --> 01:03:06.440 align:start position:0%
of proof on somebody that's making an
 
01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
allegation I'm I'm very troubled by by
 
01:03:11.710 --> 01:03:11.720 align:start position:0%
that can I respond to that I mean and
 
01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
this is a question for you if a VI like
 
01:03:16.750 --> 01:03:16.760 align:start position:0%
this woman who who helped initiate this
 
01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
bill is lying in a coma she's done
 
01:03:22.829 --> 01:03:22.839 align:start position:0%
there's been a rape test done and it's
 
01:03:25.349 --> 01:03:25.359 align:start position:0%
clear that she's been sexually assaulted
 
01:03:28.029 --> 01:03:28.039 align:start position:0%
is that not enough to show that it's not
 
01:03:29.950 --> 01:03:29.960 align:start position:0%
a frivolous
 
01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
claim and they can they can tie the the
 
01:03:35.470 --> 01:03:35.480 align:start position:0%
DNA even before trial to to the uh
 
01:03:38.190 --> 01:03:38.200 align:start position:0%
person bringing forth the defamation
 
01:03:41.230 --> 01:03:41.240 align:start position:0%
case well you know I I guess I I I mean
 
01:03:42.870 --> 01:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
which I don't know the end but it would
 
01:03:45.510 --> 01:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
seem to me I might need more information
 
01:03:48.269 --> 01:03:48.279 align:start position:0%
than I mean for example
 
01:03:51.950 --> 01:03:51.960 align:start position:0%
um I suppose one possibility might be
 
01:03:54.910 --> 01:03:54.920 align:start position:0%
that the that you know the and again I
 
01:03:56.390 --> 01:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
don't know all the facts I mean for
 
01:03:58.109 --> 01:03:58.119 align:start position:0%
example if the if the person who was
 
01:04:00.589 --> 01:04:00.599 align:start position:0%
accused said sure we had sex it was
 
01:04:04.190 --> 01:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
consensual sex and we got very drunk
 
01:04:06.870 --> 01:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
afterwards or whatever and she she fell
 
01:04:08.589 --> 01:04:08.599 align:start position:0%
and HT and hit her head I I don't know
 
01:04:10.670 --> 01:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
what all the facts would be but I I mean
 
01:04:12.510 --> 01:04:12.520 align:start position:0%
I guess what I'm saying is could there
 
01:04:14.950 --> 01:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
be circumstances in which that what what
 
01:04:16.470 --> 01:04:16.480 align:start position:0%
happened to the victim would be very
 
01:04:18.750 --> 01:04:18.760 align:start position:0%
compelling of course I completely agree
 
01:04:21.349 --> 01:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
yeah but all I'm saying is this doesn't
 
01:04:23.829 --> 01:04:23.839 align:start position:0%
seem to require any of that it just
 
01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
requires that you report
 
01:04:28.990 --> 01:04:29.000 align:start position:0%
and to say that anybody report that
 
01:04:32.430 --> 01:04:32.440 align:start position:0%
reports is presumed that I'm troubled by
 
01:04:34.309 --> 01:04:34.319 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
01:04:38.630 --> 01:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
Burch if I understand the language
 
01:04:41.069 --> 01:04:41.079 align:start position:0%
correctly uh this is a rebuttable
 
01:04:43.470 --> 01:04:43.480 align:start position:0%
presumption this is a presumption that
 
01:04:46.109 --> 01:04:46.119 align:start position:0%
you start with but is
 
01:04:49.390 --> 01:04:49.400 align:start position:0%
rebuttable so if you want to go into
 
01:04:52.630 --> 01:04:52.640 align:start position:0%
court um there is a presumption that
 
01:04:55.230 --> 01:04:55.240 align:start position:0%
when you make a report that you've been
 
01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:56.230 align:start position:0%
when you make a report that you've been
sex

01:04:56.230 --> 01:04:56.240 align:start position:0%
sex
 
01:04:59.109 --> 01:04:59.119 align:start position:0%
assaulted there's a presumption that
 
01:05:02.589 --> 01:05:02.599 align:start position:0%
you're acting in good faith now the
 
01:05:05.950 --> 01:05:05.960 align:start position:0%
other side the can certainly present
 
01:05:08.309 --> 01:05:08.319 align:start position:0%
evidence to show you're not acting in
 
01:05:11.829 --> 01:05:11.839 align:start position:0%
good faith and the tri or fact would
 
01:05:15.309 --> 01:05:15.319 align:start position:0%
then make a decision the there's no need
 
01:05:19.309 --> 01:05:19.319 align:start position:0%
as I see it to prove the actual fact of
 
01:05:23.029 --> 01:05:23.039 align:start position:0%
whether a sexual assault took place the
 
01:05:25.870 --> 01:05:25.880 align:start position:0%
problem is the inhibition
 
01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
of in most cases women but not
 
01:05:33.990 --> 01:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily uh a person who uh wishes to
 
01:05:37.349 --> 01:05:37.359 align:start position:0%
report that they have been sexually
 
01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
assaulted that doesn't mean proof of it
 
01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
they wish to report it and they are
 
01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
inhibited from doing so by the threat or
 
01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:48.789 align:start position:0%
inhibited from doing so by the threat or
the

01:05:48.789 --> 01:05:48.799 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:05:52.710 --> 01:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
actuality of being sued by somebody for
 
01:05:55.309 --> 01:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
six figures or whatever the number is so
 
01:05:58.390 --> 01:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
the is issue of proving the actual
 
01:06:01.589 --> 01:06:01.599 align:start position:0%
sexual assault took place is as I see it
 
01:06:04.029 --> 01:06:04.039 align:start position:0%
a red herring it's got nothing to do
 
01:06:06.589 --> 01:06:06.599 align:start position:0%
with the harm that this bill seeks to
 
01:06:11.029 --> 01:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
prevent which is the speaking out either
 
01:06:14.349 --> 01:06:14.359 align:start position:0%
through a lawsuit or in a newspaper or
 
01:06:18.589 --> 01:06:18.599 align:start position:0%
whatever to say it without fear if
 
01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
you're doing it in good faith which can
 
01:06:22.870 --> 01:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
be shown otherwise if the facts are
 
01:06:27.789 --> 01:06:27.799 align:start position:0%
otherwise that um uh I was
 
01:06:30.829 --> 01:06:30.839 align:start position:0%
raped and without a fear of getting
 
01:06:33.109 --> 01:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
improperly sued and that's what this
 
01:06:37.069 --> 01:06:37.079 align:start position:0%
bill is about okay well I just sorry
 
01:06:39.029 --> 01:06:39.039 align:start position:0%
representative Perez thank you thanks
 
01:06:40.269 --> 01:06:40.279 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
01:06:43.549 --> 01:06:43.559 align:start position:0%
question it it's it's twofold number one
 
01:06:48.349 --> 01:06:48.359 align:start position:0%
I wonder why why just these two cases I
 
01:06:50.349 --> 01:06:50.359 align:start position:0%
mean there are a lot of things that are
 
01:06:51.630 --> 01:06:51.640 align:start position:0%
can you I can't I'm having trouble
 
01:06:54.789 --> 01:06:54.799 align:start position:0%
hearing I'm sorry I'm sorry my first
 
01:06:57.230 --> 01:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
question when I read this was why in
 
01:07:00.230 --> 01:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
just these two instances are we talking
 
01:07:02.789 --> 01:07:02.799 align:start position:0%
about this there are a lot of things
 
01:07:06.990 --> 01:07:07.000 align:start position:0%
that go on that unfortunately people do
 
01:07:10.549 --> 01:07:10.559 align:start position:0%
that um you could feel that they're you
 
01:07:14.150 --> 01:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
know ruining right okay and then my
 
01:07:17.349 --> 01:07:17.359 align:start position:0%
other thing is I get
 
01:07:19.870 --> 01:07:19.880 align:start position:0%
concerned about you said so many of them
 
01:07:23.269 --> 01:07:23.279 align:start position:0%
were at college campuses I get concerned
 
01:07:26.190 --> 01:07:26.200 align:start position:0%
about things because I I'm concerned
 
01:07:29.069 --> 01:07:29.079 align:start position:0%
about Johnny and I break up and I'm
 
01:07:31.190 --> 01:07:31.200 align:start position:0%
really upset I'm devastated cuz he's
 
01:07:34.789 --> 01:07:34.799 align:start position:0%
going out with Susie now and I say
 
01:07:36.510 --> 01:07:36.520 align:start position:0%
Johnny raped
 
01:07:40.190 --> 01:07:40.200 align:start position:0%
me I get concerned about that right um
 
01:07:41.950 --> 01:07:41.960 align:start position:0%
and I probably wouldn't have been as
 
01:07:44.589 --> 01:07:44.599 align:start position:0%
concerned if you hadn't explained that
 
01:07:46.829 --> 01:07:46.839 align:start position:0%
so many of the cases are I mean people
 
01:07:49.549 --> 01:07:49.559 align:start position:0%
do nasty things to other people and if
 
01:07:51.789 --> 01:07:51.799 align:start position:0%
you have no
 
01:07:56.029 --> 01:07:56.039 align:start position:0%
proof that that would actually happen if
 
01:07:59.029 --> 01:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
I was Johnny I'd be filing a case
 
01:08:01.589 --> 01:08:01.599 align:start position:0%
against me too so anyway I just in
 
01:08:03.269 --> 01:08:03.279 align:start position:0%
response to the last part of what you
 
01:08:06.990 --> 01:08:07.000 align:start position:0%
said again if somebody ends up in a coma
 
01:08:08.309 --> 01:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
and they're all beaten up that's a
 
01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
different situation than than the
 
01:08:13.349 --> 01:08:13.359 align:start position:0%
scenario that you described
 
01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
there well it says yes okay I get that
 
01:08:18.229 --> 01:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
and the first thing you were talking
 
01:08:21.309 --> 01:08:21.319 align:start position:0%
about is why isn't this broader um
 
01:08:23.149 --> 01:08:23.159 align:start position:0%
because New Hampshire doesn't have any
 
01:08:26.070 --> 01:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
anti- slap slap slap
 
01:08:28.590 --> 01:08:28.600 align:start position:0%
we felt that it was a it was a that we
 
01:08:31.349 --> 01:08:31.359 align:start position:0%
should start with this and that we
 
01:08:33.110 --> 01:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
should look I agree we should be looking
 
01:08:35.669 --> 01:08:35.679 align:start position:0%
at broader anti-s slap issues going
 
01:08:39.229 --> 01:08:39.239 align:start position:0%
going forward um again uh somebody that
 
01:08:40.590 --> 01:08:40.600 align:start position:0%
I was working on with this bill was
 
01:08:43.550 --> 01:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
concerned about um whistleblowers in
 
01:08:45.229 --> 01:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
terms of land waste and that kind of
 
01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:47.199 align:start position:0%
thing so absolutely I think that that
 
01:08:48.829 --> 01:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
this is an important issue that doesn't
 
01:08:51.990 --> 01:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
just um belong relative to this right
 
01:08:54.510 --> 01:08:54.520 align:start position:0%
other questions for this witness seeing
 
01:08:56.349 --> 01:08:56.359 align:start position:0%
none thank you very much thank you next
 
01:09:06.390 --> 01:09:06.400 align:start position:0%

um as you've heard this morning it's an
 
01:09:39.110 --> 01:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
important legislation that seeks to
 
01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
protect victims of domestic violence and
 
01:09:42.950 --> 01:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
sexual assault against defamation
 
01:09:46.590 --> 01:09:46.600 align:start position:0%
lawsuits passing 580 uh sends a critical
 
01:09:48.789 --> 01:09:48.799 align:start position:0%
message to survivors across the state
 
01:09:50.590 --> 01:09:50.600 align:start position:0%
that the legislature is committed to
 
01:09:52.910 --> 01:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
prioritizing their safety and protecting
 
01:09:54.830 --> 01:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
their right to speak out without fear of
 
01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:56.350 align:start position:0%
their right to speak out without fear of
retaliation

01:09:56.350 --> 01:09:56.360 align:start position:0%
retaliation
 
01:09:58.270 --> 01:09:58.280 align:start position:0%
this bill is a significant step towards
 
01:10:00.390 --> 01:10:00.400 align:start position:0%
discouraging abusers from filing
 
01:10:03.030 --> 01:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
retaliatory litigation making it safer
 
01:10:04.950 --> 01:10:04.960 align:start position:0%
for victims to come forward and share
 
01:10:07.750 --> 01:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
their experiences survivors of Domestic
 
01:10:10.270 --> 01:10:10.280 align:start position:0%
and Sexual Violence face many barriers
 
01:10:12.790 --> 01:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
when it comes to reporting their abuse
 
01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
we frequently hear from victims across
 
01:10:16.590 --> 01:10:16.600 align:start position:0%
the state about the various tactics that
 
01:10:18.110 --> 01:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
abusers use to undermine their
 
01:10:20.030 --> 01:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
credibility and intimidate them into
 
01:10:22.110 --> 01:10:22.120 align:start position:0%
silence whether it's contacting their
 
01:10:24.630 --> 01:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
employers filing baseless motions in
 
01:10:27.189 --> 01:10:27.199 align:start position:0%
custody or divorce proceedings damaging
 
01:10:29.990 --> 01:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
their credit or threatening harm to the
 
01:10:32.229 --> 01:10:32.239 align:start position:0%
victim or their children these tactics
 
01:10:35.510 --> 01:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
are designed to isolate shame discredit
 
01:10:37.350 --> 01:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
the victim and often trapping them in
 
01:10:39.430 --> 01:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
the abusive relationship and making it
 
01:10:42.350 --> 01:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
harder for them to seek help or escape
 
01:10:44.470 --> 01:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
on average it takes seven times for a
 
01:10:45.990 --> 01:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
victim of domestic violence to leave
 
01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.750 align:start position:0%
victim of domestic violence to leave
their

01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:10:51.030 --> 01:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
relationship the ability abusers to file
 
01:10:53.070 --> 01:10:53.080 align:start position:0%
um retaliatory lawsuits against victims
 
01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:54.760 align:start position:0%
only serves to continue the cycle of
 
01:10:57.310 --> 01:10:57.320 align:start position:0%
abuse further discredit the Survivor and
 
01:10:59.350 --> 01:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
prevent them from accessing Justice and
 
01:11:01.310 --> 01:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
I think that's an important thing when
 
01:11:04.510 --> 01:11:04.520 align:start position:0%
we talk look at this it's not only um
 
01:11:07.630 --> 01:11:07.640 align:start position:0%
this bill was carefully designed to not
 
01:11:09.870 --> 01:11:09.880 align:start position:0%
only strike the balance that someone has
 
01:11:13.510 --> 01:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
to provide uh particular facts not a
 
01:11:15.910 --> 01:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
general claim um that they have been
 
01:11:19.510 --> 01:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
abused um but that it ensures um the
 
01:11:21.990 --> 01:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
right to free speech for victims just as
 
01:11:24.229 --> 01:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
uh defendants have the right to free
 
01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
speech HB 580 not only protects victims
 
01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
but also serves the broader public
 
01:11:31.590 --> 01:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
interest by ensuring that survivors can
 
01:11:34.310 --> 01:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
speak out with fear of further harm and
 
01:11:36.870 --> 01:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
I think it is a public safety bill um
 
01:11:39.550 --> 01:11:39.560 align:start position:0%
because when victims are silenced um
 
01:11:42.110 --> 01:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
perpetrators are per permitted to allow
 
01:11:45.430 --> 01:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
to harm others um so by silencing
 
01:11:47.910 --> 01:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
victims we're also allowing perpetrators
 
01:11:51.149 --> 01:11:51.159 align:start position:0%
to continue to perpetuate harm um
 
01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
retaliatory defamation lawsuits create a
 
01:11:55.990 --> 01:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
chilling effect Sil silencing the victim
 
01:11:57.790 --> 01:11:57.800 align:start position:0%
in a particular case but potentially
 
01:11:59.510 --> 01:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
discouraging other victims from coming
 
01:12:01.590 --> 01:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
forward as well this bill is an
 
01:12:03.229 --> 01:12:03.239 align:start position:0%
important safety measure that can help
 
01:12:05.270 --> 01:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
hold offenders accountable and protect
 
01:12:07.950 --> 01:12:07.960 align:start position:0%
the general public as you've seen in the
 
01:12:09.669 --> 01:12:09.679 align:start position:0%
in your committee um it can be very
 
01:12:11.629 --> 01:12:11.639 align:start position:0%
scary for victims to share their stories
 
01:12:12.910 --> 01:12:12.920 align:start position:0%
and speak about the abuse they've
 
01:12:15.830 --> 01:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
entered especially in a public forum
 
01:12:18.669 --> 01:12:18.679 align:start position:0%
would you want um a constituent who is a
 
01:12:21.629 --> 01:12:21.639 align:start position:0%
victim of abuse to come forward speak
 
01:12:24.149 --> 01:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
their story and then have their abuser
 
01:12:26.189 --> 01:12:26.199 align:start position:0%
file a lawsuit against them for sharing
 
01:12:28.430 --> 01:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
their truth I think that's really the
 
01:12:30.990 --> 01:12:31.000 align:start position:0%
root of this discussion do we want
 
01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
someone who is at a work environment who
 
01:12:37.310 --> 01:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
reports that a colleague or their
 
01:12:39.830 --> 01:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
supervisor sexually assaulted them and
 
01:12:42.790 --> 01:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
then they now have to face a retaliatory
 
01:12:46.510 --> 01:12:46.520 align:start position:0%
lawsuit for trying to get their Justice
 
01:12:48.189 --> 01:12:48.199 align:start position:0%
I think that's really the root of what
 
01:12:51.030 --> 01:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
this is trying to address um the freedom
 
01:12:52.990 --> 01:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
to share what has happened to them is a
 
01:12:54.750 --> 01:12:54.760 align:start position:0%
critical part of their ability to seek
 
01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:56.030 align:start position:0%
critical part of their ability to seek
Justice

01:12:56.030 --> 01:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
Justice
 
01:12:59.030 --> 01:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
um and so HB 580 helps ensure that a
 
01:13:00.590 --> 01:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
victim's right to free speech is not
 
01:13:02.550 --> 01:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
infringed which is important to
 
01:13:04.350 --> 01:13:04.360 align:start position:0%
effectively addressing these issues in
 
01:13:07.669 --> 01:13:07.679 align:start position:0%
our state I would just say that we have
 
01:13:11.510 --> 01:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
um a a concern with um line 15 um
 
01:13:14.350 --> 01:13:14.360 align:start position:0%
paragraph B due to the nature and degree
 
01:13:16.070 --> 01:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
of Domestic and Sexual Violence it is
 
01:13:18.149 --> 01:13:18.159 align:start position:0%
not uncommon for victims to recant or
 
01:13:19.669 --> 01:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
withdraw their statements after they
 
01:13:21.990 --> 01:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
report abuse whether it is out of fear
 
01:13:24.270 --> 01:13:24.280 align:start position:0%
or of further harm or being pressured by
 
01:13:26.790 --> 01:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
the abuser or their family for or other
 
01:13:29.390 --> 01:13:29.400 align:start position:0%
reasons um recanting abuse does not mean
 
01:13:31.470 --> 01:13:31.480 align:start position:0%
that it did not occur um so sub
 
01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
paragraph B in some ways undermines the
 
01:13:35.870 --> 01:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
intent of the legislation and reinforces
 
01:13:37.950 --> 01:13:37.960 align:start position:0%
the dangerous notion that victims are
 
01:13:39.669 --> 01:13:39.679 align:start position:0%
not credible witnesses to their own
 
01:13:41.870 --> 01:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
experiences and should not be believed
 
01:13:44.270 --> 01:13:44.280 align:start position:0%
so I know there was a lot of debate um
 
01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
you know about the merits of this bill
 
01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
and balancing Justice uh between victims
 
01:13:51.550 --> 01:13:51.560 align:start position:0%
and those that they've accused but I
 
01:13:53.750 --> 01:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
really think this is a common sense Bill
 
01:13:56.390 --> 01:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
to ensure that we are allowing people to
 
01:13:58.270 --> 01:13:58.280 align:start position:0%
come forward and we're protecting our
 
01:14:00.870 --> 01:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
communities by allowing them to do so um
 
01:14:02.830 --> 01:14:02.840 align:start position:0%
so thank you so much and I'd be happy to
 
01:14:04.270 --> 01:14:04.280 align:start position:0%
take any questions questions for this
 
01:14:07.310 --> 01:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
witness yes representative
 
01:14:11.350 --> 01:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
Smith um thank you very much for for
 
01:14:13.550 --> 01:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
coming today and
 
01:14:16.470 --> 01:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
sharing with us your your knowledge
 
01:14:17.629 --> 01:14:17.639 align:start position:0%
about this
 
01:14:17.639 --> 01:14:19.229 align:start position:0%
about this
situation

01:14:19.229 --> 01:14:19.239 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:14:22.030 --> 01:14:22.040 align:start position:0%
um we
 
01:14:26.990 --> 01:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
know that anyone is free to go public to
 
01:14:30.229 --> 01:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
make their uh statements and the
 
01:14:32.310 --> 01:14:32.320 align:start position:0%
question here is will there be
 
01:14:35.910 --> 01:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
retaliation how do we stop the
 
01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:39.750 align:start position:0%
retaliation how do we stop the
retaliation

01:14:39.750 --> 01:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:41.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:14:41.950 --> 01:14:41.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:44.030 --> 01:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
how can
 
01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:46.510 align:start position:0%
how can
we

01:14:46.510 --> 01:14:46.520 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:49.189 align:start position:0%
we
ensure

01:14:49.189 --> 01:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
ensure
 
01:14:59.229 --> 01:14:59.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:04.470 --> 01:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
is legitimate in the accusation and not
 
01:15:06.310 --> 01:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
using the
 
01:15:09.750 --> 01:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
accusation for other
 
01:15:12.270 --> 01:15:12.280 align:start position:0%
purposes I think I'm following your
 
01:15:15.830 --> 01:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
question I'm sorry if it was too obscure
 
01:15:18.149 --> 01:15:18.159 align:start position:0%
I apologize no it's okay I just don't
 
01:15:21.590 --> 01:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
want to go in the wrong direction so are
 
01:15:23.550 --> 01:15:23.560 align:start position:0%
you can you I'm sorry could you give an
 
01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:25.990 align:start position:0%
you can you I'm sorry could you give an
example

01:15:25.990 --> 01:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:15:28.750 --> 01:15:28.760 align:start position:0%
I think people who have behaved in an in
 
01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:29.870 align:start position:0%
I think people who have behaved in an in
an

01:15:29.870 --> 01:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
an
 
01:15:32.590 --> 01:15:32.600 align:start position:0%
un acceptable way should be held
 
01:15:35.470 --> 01:15:35.480 align:start position:0%
accountable I have no problem with that
 
01:15:37.790 --> 01:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
the problem that I have is have they
 
01:15:41.070 --> 01:15:41.080 align:start position:0%
indeed behaved in an unacceptable way
 
01:15:43.629 --> 01:15:43.639 align:start position:0%
and is it possible that the
 
01:15:48.149 --> 01:15:48.159 align:start position:0%
accuser is doing something that is not
 
01:15:50.750 --> 01:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
quite honorable and that is exactly what
 
01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
we would not want right the uh the other
 
01:15:58.189 --> 01:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
party to do so I think and I would like
 
01:15:59.709 --> 01:15:59.719 align:start position:0%
to just preface that I'm not a legal
 
01:16:02.110 --> 01:16:02.120 align:start position:0%
expert so I just came in to speak um
 
01:16:04.390 --> 01:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
from the experiences we've seen um in
 
01:16:06.910 --> 01:16:06.920 align:start position:0%
working with survivors across the state
 
01:16:10.070 --> 01:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
um but I think you know the it's a legal
 
01:16:12.070 --> 01:16:12.080 align:start position:0%
proceeding that this would take place in
 
01:16:15.310 --> 01:16:15.320 align:start position:0%
and it's pleading particular facts and
 
01:16:17.390 --> 01:16:17.400 align:start position:0%
not a general claim so it's not someone
 
01:16:19.550 --> 01:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
just saying that person abuse me but
 
01:16:21.990 --> 01:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
they have to provide particular facts
 
01:16:24.470 --> 01:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
and so I don't want to jump into the
 
01:16:26.709 --> 01:16:26.719 align:start position:0%
actual what that looks like because I'm
 
01:16:29.629 --> 01:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
not a legal expert um but I do think
 
01:16:32.229 --> 01:16:32.239 align:start position:0%
that there's a that this would be set up
 
01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
in a way to really strike that balance
 
01:16:37.910 --> 01:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
um and I think again we're talking about
 
01:16:40.510 --> 01:16:40.520 align:start position:0%
situations where someone could be um
 
01:16:43.149 --> 01:16:43.159 align:start position:0%
sharing their story in a public forum
 
01:16:45.590 --> 01:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
and then the retaliation lawsuit comes
 
01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
forward and they have to provide those
 
01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
particular facts to demonstrate that um
 
01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
they are indeed a victim so there is a
 
01:16:55.790 --> 01:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
balance there
 
01:16:58.430 --> 01:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
thank you so just to follow I'm going to
 
01:17:00.149 --> 01:17:00.159 align:start position:0%
but just to follow I thank
 
01:17:01.669 --> 01:17:01.679 align:start position:0%
representative Smith because I think she
 
01:17:03.430 --> 01:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
she sort of crystallized one issue for
 
01:17:07.870 --> 01:17:07.880 align:start position:0%
me so if I'm understanding under this
 
01:17:11.669 --> 01:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
bill if I claim to be a victim of sexual
 
01:17:15.550 --> 01:17:15.560 align:start position:0%
assault and I bring a civil action
 
01:17:17.669 --> 01:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
against the person that I alleg sexually
 
01:17:17.679 --> 01:17:18.790 align:start position:0%
against the person that I alleg sexually
assaulted

01:17:18.790 --> 01:17:18.800 align:start position:0%
assaulted
 
01:17:22.149 --> 01:17:22.159 align:start position:0%
me that civil action will proceed as a
 
01:17:25.149 --> 01:17:25.159 align:start position:0%
normal civil action which means that my
 
01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
burden of proof against the person that
 
01:17:30.350 --> 01:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
I allege committed the assault is a
 
01:17:33.030 --> 01:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
preponderance of the evidence but if
 
01:17:36.629 --> 01:17:36.639 align:start position:0%
that person claims that I'm I'm the one
 
01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
that's that's uh not being truthful and
 
01:17:42.390 --> 01:17:42.400 align:start position:0%
that I that I made up I made up a story
 
01:17:44.430 --> 01:17:44.440 align:start position:0%
against that person and that person
 
01:17:46.270 --> 01:17:46.280 align:start position:0%
wants to bring a counter claim against
 
01:17:48.990 --> 01:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
me that person's burden of proof would
 
01:17:51.629 --> 01:17:51.639 align:start position:0%
be clear and convincing evidence how is
 
01:17:56.270 --> 01:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
that fair that that that the fuser gets
 
01:18:00.189 --> 01:18:00.199 align:start position:0%
to bring a case based on you know a t
 
01:18:03.229 --> 01:18:03.239 align:start position:0%
just tipping the scales but if I want to
 
01:18:05.550 --> 01:18:05.560 align:start position:0%
defend by bringing a counter claim I got
 
01:18:08.270 --> 01:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
to establish it much more by a much
 
01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
stronger burden to proof how I don't
 
01:18:12.629 --> 01:18:12.639 align:start position:0%
understand how that's fair um I would
 
01:18:15.870 --> 01:18:15.880 align:start position:0%
love to just uh consult with some legal
 
01:18:17.669 --> 01:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
experts on that to provide a more
 
01:18:19.350 --> 01:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
thorough response but I think that's a
 
01:18:21.350 --> 01:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
great question and I think the matter of
 
01:18:23.270 --> 01:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
fairness is something that we all try to
 
01:18:25.709 --> 01:18:25.719 align:start position:0%
uphold in matters of Justice
 
01:18:28.430 --> 01:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
um so I I definitely hear what you're
 
01:18:31.110 --> 01:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
saying and I wish I had um the right
 
01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
answer um but I do think
 
01:18:37.149 --> 01:18:37.159 align:start position:0%
that I think that this is an at least
 
01:18:38.790 --> 01:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
bringing up a really important
 
01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
conversation um that there is um a
 
01:18:43.510 --> 01:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
challenge that survivors face and that
 
01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
there are um victims in New Hampshire
 
01:18:47.790 --> 01:18:47.800 align:start position:0%
that are being silenced right now out of
 
01:18:50.629 --> 01:18:50.639 align:start position:0%
that threat or fear of intimidation so I
 
01:18:52.430 --> 01:18:52.440 align:start position:0%
would just ask the legislature to please
 
01:18:54.510 --> 01:18:54.520 align:start position:0%
just consider um that something should
 
01:18:57.950 --> 01:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
be done on this issue representative bur
 
01:19:00.390 --> 01:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I before I ask my
 
01:19:03.229 --> 01:19:03.239 align:start position:0%
question I would note that this bill
 
01:19:05.870 --> 01:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
does not deal with counter claims this
 
01:19:10.470 --> 01:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
bill deals with a filing of a defamation
 
01:19:13.990 --> 01:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
lawsuit uh and this bill deals with the
 
01:19:16.510 --> 01:19:16.520 align:start position:0%
kind of Gateway concept of whether that
 
01:19:20.669 --> 01:19:20.679 align:start position:0%
lawsuit should go forward or not uh my
 
01:19:23.149 --> 01:19:23.159 align:start position:0%
question has to do with that sentence
 
01:19:27.030 --> 01:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
you that section you pointed out about
 
01:19:28.510 --> 01:19:28.520 align:start position:0%
um a
 
01:19:31.910 --> 01:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
recantation and understanding there's
 
01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
the recantations happen and they're
 
01:19:35.030 --> 01:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
either valid
 
01:19:37.990 --> 01:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
recantations or they're not and they're
 
01:19:42.350 --> 01:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
recanted and unre caned and all that um
 
01:19:48.629 --> 01:19:48.639 align:start position:0%
given that this is just as I said a
 
01:19:51.750 --> 01:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
doorway as to whether a defamation suit
 
01:19:53.430 --> 01:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
can go
 
01:19:56.709 --> 01:19:56.719 align:start position:0%
through is is there really a problem in
 
01:20:01.390 --> 01:20:01.400 align:start position:0%
saying that merely the fact that there's
 
01:20:02.950 --> 01:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
been a
 
01:20:07.189 --> 01:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
recantation is enough in
 
01:20:09.470 --> 01:20:09.480 align:start position:0%
itself regardless of whether later
 
01:20:11.790 --> 01:20:11.800 align:start position:0%
litigation shows it's a real recantation
 
01:20:15.910 --> 01:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
or not doesn't it really make sense to
 
01:20:18.709 --> 01:20:18.719 align:start position:0%
say well if there is a recantation we
 
01:20:20.910 --> 01:20:20.920 align:start position:0%
should let this lawsuit go through the
 
01:20:23.470 --> 01:20:23.480 align:start position:0%
doorway and let the facts develop as
 
01:20:26.390 --> 01:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
they are so with that view is there
 
01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
really that much harm in that particular
 
01:20:32.189 --> 01:20:32.199 align:start position:0%
section I think that's a great question
 
01:20:35.149 --> 01:20:35.159 align:start position:0%
and I think from our position we just
 
01:20:37.910 --> 01:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
caution um the committee just to
 
01:20:42.270 --> 01:20:42.280 align:start position:0%
recognize that often and um there's
 
01:20:44.750 --> 01:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
often pressure to recant in these cases
 
01:20:46.590 --> 01:20:46.600 align:start position:0%
so I think just given the nature of
 
01:20:48.030 --> 01:20:48.040 align:start position:0%
Domestic and Sexual Violence we just
 
01:20:50.750 --> 01:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to flag that paragraph that it
 
01:20:53.110 --> 01:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
could counter sort of the intent of the
 
01:20:56.110 --> 01:20:56.120 align:start position:0%
bill but I think um it's a valid point
 
01:20:58.229 --> 01:20:58.239 align:start position:0%
and um I we just wanted to raise that
 
01:21:01.350 --> 01:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
from like a again a victim perspective
 
01:21:03.189 --> 01:21:03.199 align:start position:0%
right other questions for this witness
 
01:21:05.350 --> 01:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
yes representative Manos thank you Mr
 
01:21:10.030 --> 01:21:10.040 align:start position:0%
chair I just wanted to um to I don't see
 
01:21:12.590 --> 01:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
where there's a higher standard of proof
 
01:21:16.229 --> 01:21:16.239 align:start position:0%
in the text of the bill and I certainly
 
01:21:20.550 --> 01:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
don't see where it refers to um clear
 
01:21:24.110 --> 01:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
and convincing evidence well I I look at
 
01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:25.470 align:start position:0%
and convincing evidence well I I look at
line

01:21:25.470 --> 01:21:25.480 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:21:27.950 --> 01:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
you might want to look at line eight um
 
01:21:29.629 --> 01:21:29.639 align:start position:0%
unless it is shown by clear and
 
01:21:32.550 --> 01:21:32.560 align:start position:0%
convincing evidence that's yeah that's
 
01:21:34.870 --> 01:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
in the amendment sorry I'm not speaking
 
01:21:36.189 --> 01:21:36.199 align:start position:0%
to the amendment I'm speaking to the
 
01:21:38.990 --> 01:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
underlying bill I haven't seen the
 
01:21:44.189 --> 01:21:44.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:46.189 --> 01:21:46.199 align:start position:0%
testimony all right other questions for
 
01:21:49.310 --> 01:21:49.320 align:start position:0%
this witness representa T yeah just
 
01:21:52.510 --> 01:21:52.520 align:start position:0%
listening to this um it seems like the
 
01:21:54.590 --> 01:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
goal and I'm not sure it's in the bill
 
01:21:58.709 --> 01:21:58.719 align:start position:0%
is to tie the initial uh lawsuit which
 
01:22:02.910 --> 01:22:02.920 align:start position:0%
may or may not be part of um a criminal
 
01:22:06.350 --> 01:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
case to the what would be the
 
01:22:09.310 --> 01:22:09.320 align:start position:0%
retaliatory lawsuit you know not just
 
01:22:10.950 --> 01:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
the threat of it but maybe the act the
 
01:22:13.149 --> 01:22:13.159 align:start position:0%
fact of it such
 
01:22:16.550 --> 01:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
that what we're really saying is if the
 
01:22:18.910 --> 01:22:18.920 align:start position:0%
if the initial accusation is borne out
 
01:22:19.990 --> 01:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
then that
 
01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.070 align:start position:0%
then that
person

01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:22:24.590 --> 01:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
would not should not have to bear the C
 
01:22:27.550 --> 01:22:27.560 align:start position:0%
cost of the retaliation and I I I'm
 
01:22:30.229 --> 01:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
wondering was that a consider is that in
 
01:22:32.189 --> 01:22:32.199 align:start position:0%
some way read into this or was that a
 
01:22:35.189 --> 01:22:35.199 align:start position:0%
consideration to basically allow a
 
01:22:38.110 --> 01:22:38.120 align:start position:0%
contingent a contingency on a on a on a
 
01:22:40.350 --> 01:22:40.360 align:start position:0%
lawsuit like that such that if the
 
01:22:42.830 --> 01:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
original you know accusation is borne
 
01:22:45.070 --> 01:22:45.080 align:start position:0%
out then that person would be
 
01:22:47.790 --> 01:22:47.800 align:start position:0%
responsible for the for the costs of of
 
01:22:49.790 --> 01:22:49.800 align:start position:0%
their their
 
01:22:52.950 --> 01:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
lawsuit um yeah so I think if I'm
 
01:22:55.070 --> 01:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
following your your line of question so
 
01:22:58.790 --> 01:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
I the underlying bill um paragraph 4 um
 
01:23:00.270 --> 01:23:00.280 align:start position:0%
says a victim who prevails in a
 
01:23:02.189 --> 01:23:02.199 align:start position:0%
retaliatory defamation case at any point
 
01:23:03.870 --> 01:23:03.880 align:start position:0%
in the proceeding shall be awarded court
 
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
costs and reasonable attorney fees so I
 
01:23:08.070 --> 01:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
I do think that is an like if I'm
 
01:23:09.750 --> 01:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
understanding what you asking correctly
 
01:23:12.030 --> 01:23:12.040 align:start position:0%
I do think that is an important piece of
 
01:23:14.110 --> 01:23:14.120 align:start position:0%
just again what the imbalance that
 
01:23:16.149 --> 01:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
currently exists in a lot of Domestic
 
01:23:18.750 --> 01:23:18.760 align:start position:0%
and Sexual Assault cases where a lot of
 
01:23:21.030 --> 01:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
frivolous lawsuits are brought up or
 
01:23:22.830 --> 01:23:22.840 align:start position:0%
continued motions and things like that
 
01:23:25.149 --> 01:23:25.159 align:start position:0%
where victims spend 10 10 T of thousands
 
01:23:27.629 --> 01:23:27.639 align:start position:0%
of dollars in court proceedings just
 
01:23:29.709 --> 01:23:29.719 align:start position:0%
because um the abuser keeps filing
 
01:23:32.510 --> 01:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
motions so I do think that again within
 
01:23:34.510 --> 01:23:34.520 align:start position:0%
the larger context of what we're seeing
 
01:23:36.709 --> 01:23:36.719 align:start position:0%
in the state this is just adding another
 
01:23:39.110 --> 01:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
checkin balance to what is often a
 
01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
continuation of abuse can I can I ask
 
01:23:44.390 --> 01:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
one quick follow up on that of course so
 
01:23:47.110 --> 01:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
just on that on that idea and this was
 
01:23:48.709 --> 01:23:48.719 align:start position:0%
something I was confused with in reading
 
01:23:50.830 --> 01:23:50.840 align:start position:0%
this and maybe I'm mistaking which suit
 
01:23:52.709 --> 01:23:52.719 align:start position:0%
we're talking about in the in the last
 
01:23:55.310 --> 01:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
paragraph versus above but the up above
 
01:23:57.510 --> 01:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
on line six it says shall not file the
 
01:24:00.510 --> 01:24:00.520 align:start position:0%
defamation lawsuit and then at the end
 
01:24:03.990 --> 01:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
um we talk about um someone who prevails
 
01:24:07.430 --> 01:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
in a retaliatory defamation case so are
 
01:24:09.750 --> 01:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
those the same like one of them's
 
01:24:11.390 --> 01:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
preventing it from happening the other
 
01:24:14.950 --> 01:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
one basically assumes some sort of uh
 
01:24:18.590 --> 01:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
prevailing uh result of it am I am I am
 
01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
I mixing those up I think be and this is
 
01:24:24.430 --> 01:24:24.440 align:start position:0%
me again not being a legal expert so I'm
 
01:24:26.270 --> 01:24:26.280 align:start position:0%
going to try my best so I think because
 
01:24:28.350 --> 01:24:28.360 align:start position:0%
they will bring forward the case you
 
01:24:30.070 --> 01:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
have to them the victim would then have
 
01:24:31.830 --> 01:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
to provide particular facts to
 
01:24:33.910 --> 01:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that they indeed are a
 
01:24:35.830 --> 01:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
victim so there would be costs
 
01:24:38.550 --> 01:24:38.560 align:start position:0%
associated with having to go through the
 
01:24:40.590 --> 01:24:40.600 align:start position:0%
process I
 
01:24:43.629 --> 01:24:43.639 align:start position:0%
think other questions for this witness
 
01:24:44.910 --> 01:24:44.920 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
01:24:46.790 --> 01:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
you very much next I'm going to call on
 
01:24:48.310 --> 01:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
uh former representative Betty gay
 
01:24:48.320 --> 01:25:00.109 align:start position:0%
uh former representative Betty gay
please

01:25:00.109 --> 01:25:00.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:02.830 --> 01:25:02.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my testimony I
 
01:25:04.669 --> 01:25:04.679 align:start position:0%
realize that everybody is concerned
 
01:25:08.390 --> 01:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
about people being falsely confu con I
 
01:25:11.950 --> 01:25:11.960 align:start position:0%
just forgot the word falsely accused and
 
01:25:17.910 --> 01:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
suffering uh terribly to their uh public
 
01:25:21.070 --> 01:25:21.080 align:start position:0%
knowledge however in reality we have far
 
01:25:23.830 --> 01:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
more victims of sexual abuse who then
 
01:25:25.870 --> 01:25:25.880 align:start position:0%
are Mar marked who are scared to death
 
01:25:28.950 --> 01:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
to say that they've been raped because
 
01:25:31.830 --> 01:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
the ordinary response for the culture is
 
01:25:33.990 --> 01:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
to say what did you
 
01:25:37.950 --> 01:25:37.960 align:start position:0%
do so we already have in our culture the
 
01:25:40.990 --> 01:25:41.000 align:start position:0%
reluctance to report sexual
 
01:25:43.510 --> 01:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
abuse so it takes a lot of gumption and
 
01:25:46.189 --> 01:25:46.199 align:start position:0%
that's why as uh as our previous
 
01:25:48.470 --> 01:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
testimony said usually
 
01:25:52.790 --> 01:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
people uh go back to their abuser seven
 
01:25:56.189 --> 01:25:56.199 align:start position:0%
times because they're so many ties so
 
01:25:59.910 --> 01:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
many reasons why not to risk your entire
 
01:26:03.229 --> 01:26:03.239 align:start position:0%
life and everybody's opinion of you
 
01:26:06.430 --> 01:26:06.440 align:start position:0%
there are two really important facts one
 
01:26:10.910 --> 01:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
is settling one court case will solve
 
01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:11.910 align:start position:0%
is settling one court case will solve
both

01:26:11.910 --> 01:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
both
 
01:26:15.709 --> 01:26:15.719 align:start position:0%
cases if you accuse someone of sexual a
 
01:26:18.750 --> 01:26:18.760 align:start position:0%
sexual assault and you're
 
01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
found it's founded it's a agreed that
 
01:26:24.629 --> 01:26:24.639 align:start position:0%
that really happened obviously the
 
01:26:28.189 --> 01:26:28.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:30.870 --> 01:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
happen so you save a lot of
 
01:26:34.910 --> 01:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
time forensic can tell whether a person
 
01:26:38.310 --> 01:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
engaged in consensual sex or was
 
01:26:41.950 --> 01:26:41.960 align:start position:0%
raped it's no longer ex considered it's
 
01:26:49.229 --> 01:26:49.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:52.870 --> 01:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
not I think I think it's really really
 
01:26:56.470 --> 01:26:56.480 align:start position:0%
important to acknowledge that being
 
01:26:59.790 --> 01:26:59.800 align:start position:0%
threatened with a suit of many figures
 
01:27:03.910 --> 01:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
of many big numbers is enough to deter
 
01:27:07.270 --> 01:27:07.280 align:start position:0%
lots of people for lots of lots of
 
01:27:12.189 --> 01:27:12.199 align:start position:0%
things that is a genuine genuine threat
 
01:27:15.310 --> 01:27:15.320 align:start position:0%
and in our culture it's hard enough for
 
01:27:20.270 --> 01:27:20.280 align:start position:0%
victims of ab of sexual assault to prove
 
01:27:22.310 --> 01:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
that they are or to convince other
 
01:27:24.350 --> 01:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
people that they were not willing
 
01:27:26.870 --> 01:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
participants so you start out with
 
01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
something that's
 
01:27:34.750 --> 01:27:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:38.070 --> 01:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
law but I think I think this bill is
 
01:27:41.189 --> 01:27:41.199 align:start position:0%
very very important to pass because it
 
01:27:45.109 --> 01:27:45.119 align:start position:0%
gives if if the person who um I wish my
 
01:27:48.030 --> 01:27:48.040 align:start position:0%
words were better but if the victim
 
01:27:52.430 --> 01:27:52.440 align:start position:0%
accuses someone and does follow through
 
01:27:55.390 --> 01:27:55.400 align:start position:0%
in court and
 
01:27:58.629 --> 01:27:58.639 align:start position:0%
wins great great the the person's not
 
01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
going to not going to file against can
 
01:28:03.870 --> 01:28:03.880 align:start position:0%
they could file against them they still
 
01:28:08.070 --> 01:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
have that that uh uh that
 
01:28:11.109 --> 01:28:11.119 align:start position:0%
opportunity but we're we're if we don't
 
01:28:13.310 --> 01:28:13.320 align:start position:0%
pass this we're ignoring a really
 
01:28:16.189 --> 01:28:16.199 align:start position:0%
serious threat that victims of sexual
 
01:28:19.669 --> 01:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
abuse suffer from and I think it's time
 
01:28:21.310 --> 01:28:21.320 align:start position:0%
that we level the
 
01:28:23.390 --> 01:28:23.400 align:start position:0%
field thank you questions for this
 
01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:24.629 align:start position:0%
field thank you questions for this
Witness

01:28:24.629 --> 01:28:24.639 align:start position:0%
Witness
 
01:28:26.430 --> 01:28:26.440 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much next I'm
 
01:28:35.189 --> 01:28:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:37.870 --> 01:28:37.880 align:start position:0%
please good morning Representatives um
 
01:28:41.390 --> 01:28:41.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for um taking my testimony for
 
01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Marissa Chase I
 
01:28:44.510 --> 01:28:44.520 align:start position:0%
represent the New Hampshire Association
 
01:28:46.590 --> 01:28:46.600 align:start position:0%
for justice which is um the Civil
 
01:28:48.950 --> 01:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's bar of um attorneys in the
 
01:28:54.149 --> 01:28:54.159 align:start position:0%
state um I come here with um
 
01:28:56.669 --> 01:28:56.679 align:start position:0%
total respect for the sponsors and the
 
01:28:57.990 --> 01:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
intention behind this piece of
 
01:29:01.709 --> 01:29:01.719 align:start position:0%
legislation just some practical concerns
 
01:29:05.590 --> 01:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
um with the definitions I think RSA 507
 
01:29:08.189 --> 01:29:08.199 align:start position:0%
is maybe perhaps and I guess I should
 
01:29:10.390 --> 01:29:10.400 align:start position:0%
also preface with I don't think this is
 
01:29:12.350 --> 01:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
totally unworkable I don't think every
 
01:29:15.070 --> 01:29:15.080 align:start position:0%
single anti slap piece of legislation is
 
01:29:17.109 --> 01:29:17.119 align:start position:0%
unworkable I think there are some ways
 
01:29:18.590 --> 01:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
to do it that might comport better with
 
01:29:20.510 --> 01:29:20.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law I don't think this
 
01:29:24.430 --> 01:29:24.440 align:start position:0%
bill quite fits that yet um I think RSA
 
01:29:27.870 --> 01:29:27.880 align:start position:0%
507 is perhaps a weird statute to put it
 
01:29:30.510 --> 01:29:30.520 align:start position:0%
I think some of the definitions and I
 
01:29:32.189 --> 01:29:32.199 align:start position:0%
think Mr chair you brought up a lot of
 
01:29:34.669 --> 01:29:34.679 align:start position:0%
the concerns that and a lot of the kind
 
01:29:36.189 --> 01:29:36.199 align:start position:0%
of thinking through rational arguments
 
01:29:37.830 --> 01:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
that my members did when we discussed
 
01:29:41.510 --> 01:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
this bill um you know this bill doesn't
 
01:29:43.390 --> 01:29:43.400 align:start position:0%
necessarily Define what a victim of
 
01:29:45.830 --> 01:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
sexual assault is while a lot of times
 
01:29:49.109 --> 01:29:49.119 align:start position:0%
colloquially we know inherently What
 
01:29:51.470 --> 01:29:51.480 align:start position:0%
legislation is aiming to get at legal
 
01:29:53.310 --> 01:29:53.320 align:start position:0%
terms can be quite different as you all
 
01:29:57.229 --> 01:29:57.239 align:start position:0%
know from your work on this committee um
 
01:30:00.189 --> 01:30:00.199 align:start position:0%
also what is the victim publicly stated
 
01:30:02.350 --> 01:30:02.360 align:start position:0%
means I don't know if anybody's watched
 
01:30:04.030 --> 01:30:04.040 align:start position:0%
the office but I'm reminded of when
 
01:30:05.790 --> 01:30:05.800 align:start position:0%
Michael Scott declares
 
01:30:10.790 --> 01:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy um and I also wanted to add
 
01:30:12.510 --> 01:30:12.520 align:start position:0%
that um our courts in New Hampshire have
 
01:30:14.669 --> 01:30:14.679 align:start position:0%
found punitive damages at the end and
 
01:30:15.870 --> 01:30:15.880 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm reading from the bill is
 
01:30:18.390 --> 01:30:18.400 align:start position:0%
introduced not any Amendment um a victim
 
01:30:20.470 --> 01:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
who pre who prevails at any point in the
 
01:30:21.790 --> 01:30:21.800 align:start position:0%
proceeding shall be awarded cost
 
01:30:23.109 --> 01:30:23.119 align:start position:0%
freeable attorneys fees shall be
 
01:30:25.470 --> 01:30:25.480 align:start position:0%
eligible to receive punitive damages we
 
01:30:27.070 --> 01:30:27.080 align:start position:0%
don't really have punitive damages in
 
01:30:28.550 --> 01:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we have enhanced
 
01:30:32.229 --> 01:30:32.239 align:start position:0%
compensatory damages punitive damages um
 
01:30:36.430 --> 01:30:36.440 align:start position:0%
are kind of I should say frowned upon um
 
01:30:38.790 --> 01:30:38.800 align:start position:0%
the other thing I would
 
01:30:43.870 --> 01:30:43.880 align:start position:0%
note is escaping me at the
 
01:30:47.229 --> 01:30:47.239 align:start position:0%
moment um I apologize I just completely
 
01:30:48.950 --> 01:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
lost my train of thought but if there is
 
01:30:52.270 --> 01:30:52.280 align:start position:0%
a will on this committee to work on this
 
01:30:54.070 --> 01:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
legislation and try to come to
 
01:30:55.950 --> 01:30:55.960 align:start position:0%
compromise um my members would be more
 
01:30:57.390 --> 01:30:57.400 align:start position:0%
than happy to participate with other
 
01:30:59.270 --> 01:30:59.280 align:start position:0%
stakeholders all right questions for
 
01:31:03.950 --> 01:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
this witness yes yes represent bur uh
 
01:31:06.709 --> 01:31:06.719 align:start position:0%
you suggested that the uh oh thank you
 
01:31:08.910 --> 01:31:08.920 align:start position:0%
for taking my question and it's good to
 
01:31:11.510 --> 01:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
see you good to see you representative
 
01:31:13.950 --> 01:31:13.960 align:start position:0%
uh you suggested that the definitional
 
01:31:19.070 --> 01:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
part of victim or whatever is isn't
 
01:31:22.030 --> 01:31:22.040 align:start position:0%
defined uh and I'm not sure if you're
 
01:31:25.310 --> 01:31:25.320 align:start position:0%
familiar with the amendment no okay so
 
01:31:27.470 --> 01:31:27.480 align:start position:0%
the amendment says a victim or other
 
01:31:29.910 --> 01:31:29.920 align:start position:0%
person reporting an alleged perpetrator
 
01:31:32.709 --> 01:31:32.719 align:start position:0%
sexual misconduct sexual abuse sexual
 
01:31:36.030 --> 01:31:36.040 align:start position:0%
whatever thank you so I'm looking here
 
01:31:39.270 --> 01:31:39.280 align:start position:0%
now that you have it at at line six and
 
01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:44.270 align:start position:0%
now that you have it at at line six and
seven

01:31:44.270 --> 01:31:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:49.229 --> 01:31:49.239 align:start position:0%
and so I also think I'm looking at um
 
01:31:50.390 --> 01:31:50.400 align:start position:0%
well I guess I have a concern with line
 
01:31:51.629 --> 01:31:51.639 align:start position:0%
eight but I'll stick to your question
 
01:31:54.430 --> 01:31:54.440 align:start position:0%
line six and seven uh victim other
 
01:31:57.109 --> 01:31:57.119 align:start position:0%
person under 17 so I think victim is
 
01:32:00.390 --> 01:32:00.400 align:start position:0%
defined in 173b probably makes sense but
 
01:32:03.229 --> 01:32:03.239 align:start position:0%
again I think that creating rebuttable
 
01:32:05.510 --> 01:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
presumption I mean has a criminal case
 
01:32:08.629 --> 01:32:08.639 align:start position:0%
happened or not when is this civil
 
01:32:10.870 --> 01:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
action being commenced in conjunction
 
01:32:12.750 --> 01:32:12.760 align:start position:0%
with the civil case and I remembered my
 
01:32:15.070 --> 01:32:15.080 align:start position:0%
train of thought if I may to piggyback
 
01:32:18.189 --> 01:32:18.199 align:start position:0%
off this discussion uh in New Hampshire
 
01:32:19.629 --> 01:32:19.639 align:start position:0%
we are such a small state with a
 
01:32:21.790 --> 01:32:21.800 align:start position:0%
collegial bar and we're a cheap state
 
01:32:24.550 --> 01:32:24.560 align:start position:0%
right we're Frugal juries are the same
 
01:32:27.390 --> 01:32:27.400 align:start position:0%
and frivolous lawsuits just
 
01:32:31.030 --> 01:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
don't often get filed in New Hampshire
 
01:32:33.669 --> 01:32:33.679 align:start position:0%
we are not some state that welcomes
 
01:32:36.030 --> 01:32:36.040 align:start position:0%
outof State multi-district litigation we
 
01:32:38.750 --> 01:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
are a small collegial bar where lawyers
 
01:32:42.550 --> 01:32:42.560 align:start position:0%
reputations depend on their work and
 
01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:43.510 align:start position:0%
reputations depend on their work and
vice

01:32:43.510 --> 01:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
vice
 
01:32:46.390 --> 01:32:46.400 align:start position:0%
versa and lawyers take these cases on
 
01:32:49.229 --> 01:32:49.239 align:start position:0%
contingency fee basis that means that a
 
01:32:51.550 --> 01:32:51.560 align:start position:0%
lawyer who would take this case would
 
01:32:54.750 --> 01:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
not get paid unless and in until they
 
01:32:56.590 --> 01:32:56.600 align:start position:0%
Prevail and get a recovery on behalf of
 
01:32:59.149 --> 01:32:59.159 align:start position:0%
their client that in itself is a huge
 
01:33:01.109 --> 01:33:01.119 align:start position:0%
deterrent to bringing any claims that
 
01:33:04.109 --> 01:33:04.119 align:start position:0%
are not meritorious in this state and I
 
01:33:05.350 --> 01:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
just wanted
 
01:33:07.990 --> 01:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
to make that point but I think the
 
01:33:10.310 --> 01:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
definition of victim of 173b in the
 
01:33:12.590 --> 01:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
amendment makes sense clear and
 
01:33:15.470 --> 01:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
convincing evidence I in civil cases
 
01:33:18.030 --> 01:33:18.040 align:start position:0%
that's just not a standard that we
 
01:33:21.550 --> 01:33:21.560 align:start position:0%
typically see um civil cases um are
 
01:33:23.350 --> 01:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
typically by preponderance of the
 
01:33:24.950 --> 01:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
evidence clear and convincing is when
 
01:33:26.390 --> 01:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
you're taking someone's Liberties away
 
01:33:28.750 --> 01:33:28.760 align:start position:0%
it's a much higher evidentiary standard
 
01:33:30.870 --> 01:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
so I always get wary when we see clear
 
01:33:32.669 --> 01:33:32.679 align:start position:0%
and convincing in civil context all
 
01:33:35.229 --> 01:33:35.239 align:start position:0%
right other questions for this witness
 
01:33:37.189 --> 01:33:37.199 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
01:33:39.350 --> 01:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
you all right is there anyone else here
 
01:33:42.270 --> 01:33:42.280 align:start position:0%
who wishes to uh be heard on House Bill
 
01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:44.350 align:start position:0%
who wishes to uh be heard on House Bill
580

01:33:44.350 --> 01:33:44.360 align:start position:0%
580
 
01:33:46.950 --> 01:33:46.960 align:start position:0%
FN seeing none I'm going to close the
 
01:33:52.709 --> 01:33:52.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:28.030 --> 01:34:28.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:30.350 --> 01:34:30.360 align:start position:0%
you have two minutes I have some copies
 
01:34:31.990 --> 01:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
of amendments we can pick
 
01:34:36.109 --> 01:34:36.119 align:start position:0%
up oh um yeah you know
 
01:34:36.119 --> 01:34:37.669 align:start position:0%
up oh um yeah you know
um

01:34:37.669 --> 01:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:43.629 --> 01:34:43.639 align:start position:0%
722 72 722 okay um hang on one second
 
01:34:45.830 --> 01:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
722 where where is
 
01:34:49.669 --> 01:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
722 I do it later oh okay um yeah yeah
 
01:34:51.390 --> 01:34:51.400 align:start position:0%
yeah you know we're going to we're going
 
01:34:54.070 --> 01:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
to we're going to just find it EXA now I
 
01:34:55.590 --> 01:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
think we'll be but then we'll take a
 
01:34:55.600 --> 01:35:08.910 align:start position:0%
think we'll be but then we'll take a
break

01:35:08.910 --> 01:35:08.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:11.550 --> 01:35:11.560 align:start position:0%
um oh I'm s oh I'm s you know I'm sorry
 
01:35:13.149 --> 01:35:13.159 align:start position:0%
I didn't you know you reminded me and I
 
01:35:17.189 --> 01:35:17.199 align:start position:0%
didn't do it I'm sorry so
 
01:35:21.709 --> 01:35:21.719 align:start position:0%
um uh based based upon a just a very
 
01:35:23.830 --> 01:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
brief discussion I had with the ranking
 
01:35:26.990 --> 01:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
member let me ask and I I really I guess
 
01:35:29.430 --> 01:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
I I don't since neither neither of us I
 
01:35:30.990 --> 01:35:31.000 align:start position:0%
think have had a chance to talk to our
 
01:35:33.189 --> 01:35:33.199 align:start position:0%
respective caucuses about this so I'm
 
01:35:35.830 --> 01:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
sort of you know shooting from the hip a
 
01:35:37.430 --> 01:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
little bit maybe maybe both of us are
 
01:35:40.470 --> 01:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
but she raised the issue um which I
 
01:35:43.070 --> 01:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
think is worthy of at least a discussion
 
01:35:45.310 --> 01:35:45.320 align:start position:0%
with regard to the last bill we the bill
 
01:35:48.430 --> 01:35:48.440 align:start position:0%
we just heard 580
 
01:35:51.109 --> 01:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
um I believe that there would be
 
01:35:54.189 --> 01:35:54.199 align:start position:0%
significant dispute among
 
01:35:55.870 --> 01:35:55.880 align:start position:0%
and maybe it would be on a partisan
 
01:35:57.350 --> 01:35:57.360 align:start position:0%
basis maybe not I'm not sure but there
 
01:35:59.030 --> 01:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
would be significant dispute about what
 
01:36:02.510 --> 01:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
should happen to that Bill I'm wondering
 
01:36:06.310 --> 01:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
if everyone could live with retain the
 
01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
bill um and what I'm thinking there is
 
01:36:14.109 --> 01:36:14.119 align:start position:0%
this uh you know for example just I'm
 
01:36:15.870 --> 01:36:15.880 align:start position:0%
and I'm completely Thinking Out Loud
 
01:36:18.149 --> 01:36:18.159 align:start position:0%
here I this might be satisfactory to
 
01:36:20.709 --> 01:36:20.719 align:start position:0%
some people or not would for example
 
01:36:20.719 --> 01:36:21.910 align:start position:0%
some people or not would for example
would

01:36:21.910 --> 01:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:36:24.629 --> 01:36:24.639 align:start position:0%
a potential
 
01:36:26.990 --> 01:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
way that could bring everybody together
 
01:36:30.950 --> 01:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
on this bill would be if over the summer
 
01:36:33.229 --> 01:36:33.239 align:start position:0%
for example we worked on some language
 
01:36:35.709 --> 01:36:35.719 align:start position:0%
that said something
 
01:36:38.629 --> 01:36:38.639 align:start position:0%
like um
 
01:36:42.590 --> 01:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
if a person that is accused
 
01:36:45.950 --> 01:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
of sexual assault or sexual abuse of
 
01:36:49.189 --> 01:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
some kind is
 
01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
adjudicated to have engaged in that
 
01:36:55.629 --> 01:36:55.639 align:start position:0%
abuse then if it's a criminal case as
 
01:36:59.189 --> 01:36:59.199 align:start position:0%
part of the criminal case the court is
 
01:37:00.910 --> 01:37:00.920 align:start position:0%
required to
 
01:37:05.990 --> 01:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
award compensation to the victim for any
 
01:37:08.350 --> 01:37:08.360 align:start position:0%
expenses he or she might have incurred
 
01:37:11.790 --> 01:37:11.800 align:start position:0%
in defending against the lawsuit or the
 
01:37:13.510 --> 01:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
same if it was a civil case in other
 
01:37:18.750 --> 01:37:18.760 align:start position:0%
words a requirement that um if you if if
 
01:37:21.790 --> 01:37:21.800 align:start position:0%
you are actually guilty of some kind of
 
01:37:24.310 --> 01:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
assault and you have have have attempted
 
01:37:27.870 --> 01:37:27.880 align:start position:0%
to use a a civil lawsuit against the
 
01:37:31.109 --> 01:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
accuser um you're going to you're going
 
01:37:32.709 --> 01:37:32.719 align:start position:0%
to have to pay the
 
01:37:32.719 --> 01:37:34.430 align:start position:0%
to have to pay the
piper

01:37:34.430 --> 01:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
piper
 
01:37:38.510 --> 01:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
um in the if if in if in fact you're
 
01:37:42.189 --> 01:37:42.199 align:start position:0%
found to have engaged in abuse um so I I
 
01:37:44.270 --> 01:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
I raised that issue as a possibility of
 
01:37:45.870 --> 01:37:45.880 align:start position:0%
something we might think about and that
 
01:37:47.629 --> 01:37:47.639 align:start position:0%
would that be a reason to retain this
 
01:37:51.350 --> 01:37:51.360 align:start position:0%
bill Mr chair could I Mr let me hear
 
01:37:52.830 --> 01:37:52.840 align:start position:0%
from representative Smith first and then
 
01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
representative B
 
01:37:57.470 --> 01:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
um I I know we're not on the subject of
 
01:37:59.430 --> 01:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
this bill it hasn't been called for the
 
01:38:01.910 --> 01:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
executive session so we're not ready at
 
01:38:06.229 --> 01:38:06.239 align:start position:0%
all to discuss it um my only comment to
 
01:38:10.109 --> 01:38:10.119 align:start position:0%
you was preliminary to you getting to it
 
01:38:13.950 --> 01:38:13.960 align:start position:0%
in in the calendar and that there seem
 
01:38:17.390 --> 01:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
to be strong
 
01:38:21.669 --> 01:38:21.679 align:start position:0%
um uh both questions and affirmations on
 
01:38:26.830 --> 01:38:26.840 align:start position:0%
each side and because we try to work as
 
01:38:29.629 --> 01:38:29.639 align:start position:0%
collegially as we can in this committee
 
01:38:33.070 --> 01:38:33.080 align:start position:0%
it might be appropriate on this bill not
 
01:38:35.669 --> 01:38:35.679 align:start position:0%
to discuss what we could come up with
 
01:38:37.950 --> 01:38:37.960 align:start position:0%
but to discuss that we ought to think
 
01:38:40.030 --> 01:38:40.040 align:start position:0%
about what we could come up with and
 
01:38:42.070 --> 01:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
therefore it would make sense to retain
 
01:38:45.430 --> 01:38:45.440 align:start position:0%
it have a subcommittee perhaps work on
 
01:38:48.709 --> 01:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
it see what they come up with see if we
 
01:38:54.270 --> 01:38:54.280 align:start position:0%
can get either to a yes or a no that is
 
01:38:56.750 --> 01:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
clear to all of us and that was my own
 
01:38:58.990 --> 01:38:59.000 align:start position:0%
my reason for my comment not that I see
 
01:38:59.000 --> 01:38:59.910 align:start position:0%
my reason for my comment not that I see
a

01:38:59.910 --> 01:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:39:02.589 --> 01:39:02.599 align:start position:0%
suggestion right now you're much more
 
01:39:04.629 --> 01:39:04.639 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable than I am you see
 
01:39:10.550 --> 01:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
suggestions now but um rather than go
 
01:39:13.109 --> 01:39:13.119 align:start position:0%
into what I think would be a highly
 
01:39:16.350 --> 01:39:16.360 align:start position:0%
contentious discussion at this point
 
01:39:19.149 --> 01:39:19.159 align:start position:0%
that I don't think anybody wants it was
 
01:39:21.149 --> 01:39:21.159 align:start position:0%
just when you got to it in the
 
01:39:24.870 --> 01:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
agenda to consider
 
01:39:28.189 --> 01:39:28.199 align:start position:0%
retaining as the answer to get us
 
01:39:29.669 --> 01:39:29.679 align:start position:0%
through to the end all right
 
01:39:31.189 --> 01:39:31.199 align:start position:0%
representative bur you had something you
 
01:39:34.830 --> 01:39:34.840 align:start position:0%
want say I I would strongly argue
 
01:39:37.229 --> 01:39:37.239 align:start position:0%
against that I mean we've
 
01:39:40.030 --> 01:39:40.040 align:start position:0%
heard I have some doubts frankly that
 
01:39:43.470 --> 01:39:43.480 align:start position:0%
those who who philosophically oppose
 
01:39:45.709 --> 01:39:45.719 align:start position:0%
slap litigation or anti-s slap
 
01:39:48.990 --> 01:39:49.000 align:start position:0%
litigation are going to come up with a
 
01:39:52.990 --> 01:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
solution that is slap litigation so I'm
 
01:39:56.030 --> 01:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
not sure what a retention would do as to
 
01:39:56.040 --> 01:39:57.189 align:start position:0%
not sure what a retention would do as to
the

01:39:57.189 --> 01:39:57.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:40:00.910 --> 01:40:00.920 align:start position:0%
suggestion that if a criminal case
 
01:40:04.270 --> 01:40:04.280 align:start position:0%
proceeds to prove the allegation then
 
01:40:06.870 --> 01:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
the defamation suit suit wouldn't happen
 
01:40:09.589 --> 01:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
we already have that and the idea if a
 
01:40:12.830 --> 01:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
civil suit shows that the sexual assault
 
01:40:15.149 --> 01:40:15.159 align:start position:0%
happened that we would switch to a loser
 
01:40:17.950 --> 01:40:17.960 align:start position:0%
pay system which is not what we have in
 
01:40:20.390 --> 01:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I doubt would ever
 
01:40:23.950 --> 01:40:23.960 align:start position:0%
pass uh as that concept I I just think
 
01:40:29.470 --> 01:40:29.480 align:start position:0%
that uh that absent asense from those
 
01:40:32.470 --> 01:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
who clearly oppose to slap litigation
 
01:40:33.990 --> 01:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
that they're willing to
 
01:40:36.750 --> 01:40:36.760 align:start position:0%
consider um slap
 
01:40:40.510 --> 01:40:40.520 align:start position:0%
litigation uh uh prohibition that
 
01:40:42.470 --> 01:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
there's not much point in having a
 
01:40:46.830 --> 01:40:46.840 align:start position:0%
retaining it right discuss get the
 
01:40:50.149 --> 01:40:50.159 align:start position:0%
bill not in ex well I no I thought I did
 
01:40:53.350 --> 01:40:53.360 align:start position:0%
open the did I not open but not to this
 
01:40:56.510 --> 01:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
well you just opened it generally and so
 
01:40:59.109 --> 01:40:59.119 align:start position:0%
unless you you were taking this bill out
 
01:41:01.270 --> 01:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
order and I would hope you wouldn't
 
01:41:03.910 --> 01:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
since neither CAU has had a chance to
 
01:41:06.950 --> 01:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
discuss this after the hearing I would
 
01:41:10.149 --> 01:41:10.159 align:start position:0%
hope you would just move on now to the
 
01:41:13.870 --> 01:41:13.880 align:start position:0%
order of bills that well okay I I guess
 
01:41:16.629 --> 01:41:16.639 align:start position:0%
I thought that we if it sounds like what
 
01:41:17.910 --> 01:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
you're saying representative Smith and
 
01:41:19.510 --> 01:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
if that if it is the case I have no
 
01:41:20.870 --> 01:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
problem with this that you would like a
 
01:41:22.709 --> 01:41:22.719 align:start position:0%
chance to talk with your caucus about
 
01:41:25.510 --> 01:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
this and that's fine with me so I will I
 
01:41:27.470 --> 01:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
will uh put this off until probably
 
01:41:29.550 --> 01:41:29.560 align:start position:0%
after lunch I guess what I would like
 
01:41:31.550 --> 01:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
can I where's the representative of
 
01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:34.229 align:start position:0%
can I where's the representative of
Alexander

01:41:34.229 --> 01:41:34.239 align:start position:0%
Alexander
 
01:41:34.239 --> 01:41:42.950 align:start position:0%
Alexander
see

01:41:42.950 --> 01:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:46.750 --> 01:41:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:48.950 --> 01:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
sorry yeah but the time for that is not
 
01:41:48.960 --> 01:41:53.589 align:start position:0%
sorry yeah but the time for that is not
now

01:41:53.589 --> 01:41:53.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:56.149 --> 01:41:56.159 align:start position:0%
somewhere all right hang hang on hang on
 
01:41:56.159 --> 01:41:58.790 align:start position:0%
somewhere all right hang hang on hang on
let

01:41:58.790 --> 01:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:02.390 --> 01:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
me oh okay
 
01:42:08.950 --> 01:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:11.910 --> 01:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
about yeah ready to go now oh yeah all
 
01:42:13.910 --> 01:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
right so
 
01:42:17.709 --> 01:42:17.719 align:start position:0%
um I so if I hadn't done so before I'm
 
01:42:19.550 --> 01:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
going to formally open the executive
 
01:42:24.470 --> 01:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
session now and I am going to take um
 
01:42:27.870 --> 01:42:27.880 align:start position:0%
uh I'm going to take up out of order
 
01:42:31.350 --> 01:42:31.360 align:start position:0%
House Bill 633 FN relative to housing
 
01:42:33.270 --> 01:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
Investment Trust because I see at least
 
01:42:36.629 --> 01:42:36.639 align:start position:0%
one or two of the uh of the the sponsor
 
01:42:38.510 --> 01:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
and someone who else else is who's very
 
01:42:40.950 --> 01:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
interested in this bill here and in
 
01:42:43.030 --> 01:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
deference to not having them have to
 
01:42:45.750 --> 01:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
wait around um I think it makes sense to
 
01:42:47.709 --> 01:42:47.719 align:start position:0%
take that up first
 
01:42:52.550 --> 01:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
so um with regard to uh HB 633 the chair
 
01:42:54.350 --> 01:42:54.360 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative
 
01:42:57.990 --> 01:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
Alexander uh uh to speak I believe he
 
01:43:01.229 --> 01:43:01.239 align:start position:0%
has a motion thank you Mr chairman I
 
01:43:05.229 --> 01:43:05.239 align:start position:0%
move um HB 633 ought to pass and I offer
 
01:43:07.790 --> 01:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
Amendment um 2025
 
01:43:10.229 --> 01:43:10.239 align:start position:0%
860h right is there a
 
01:43:12.790 --> 01:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
second I'll second the moot I'll second
 
01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:13.550 align:start position:0%
second I'll second the moot I'll second
the

01:43:13.550 --> 01:43:13.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:43:16.229 --> 01:43:16.239 align:start position:0%
motion um and representative Alexander
 
01:43:17.870 --> 01:43:17.880 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your motion
 
01:43:21.109 --> 01:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chair thank you I I saw that
 
01:43:22.669 --> 01:43:22.679 align:start position:0%
there's significant value in something
 
01:43:24.270 --> 01:43:24.280 align:start position:0%
like this and I'd like to study it
 
01:43:26.790 --> 01:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
further um I also think there were a lot
 
01:43:28.310 --> 01:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
of questions raised during the public
 
01:43:30.629 --> 01:43:30.639 align:start position:0%
hearing um that could be answered
 
01:43:32.149 --> 01:43:32.159 align:start position:0%
through a true legislative study
 
01:43:34.030 --> 01:43:34.040 align:start position:0%
committee this amendment would replace
 
01:43:35.270 --> 01:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
the bill with a legislative study
 
01:43:37.270 --> 01:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
committee it would consist of um three
 
01:43:39.550 --> 01:43:39.560 align:start position:0%
representatives and one Senator um the
 
01:43:41.149 --> 01:43:41.159 align:start position:0%
reason why I want to do a legislative
 
01:43:42.990 --> 01:43:43.000 align:start position:0%
sub uh study committee instead of a
 
01:43:44.910 --> 01:43:44.920 align:start position:0%
retain is because I want to get buyin
 
01:43:47.589 --> 01:43:47.599 align:start position:0%
from the Senate um or the other body um
 
01:43:50.790 --> 01:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
to see uh to hopefully get to a point
 
01:43:53.189 --> 01:43:53.199 align:start position:0%
where we can have a a clean consensus
 
01:43:55.030 --> 01:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
moving into next year so that's what
 
01:43:56.990 --> 01:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
this amendment does and I'm hoping that
 
01:43:59.910 --> 01:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
I can offer up a great version of this
 
01:44:02.310 --> 01:44:02.320 align:start position:0%
bill that the committee will support and
 
01:44:04.750 --> 01:44:04.760 align:start position:0%
it will fly through the state house next
 
01:44:08.589 --> 01:44:08.599 align:start position:0%
year so I ask for your support um all
 
01:44:12.669 --> 01:44:12.679 align:start position:0%
right anybody uh wish to be heard on uh
 
01:44:15.510 --> 01:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander's Amendment um
 
01:44:18.589 --> 01:44:18.599 align:start position:0%
yes sure rep um the way the bill is
 
01:44:20.910 --> 01:44:20.920 align:start position:0%
drafted is kind of strange too I didn't
 
01:44:25.390 --> 01:44:25.400 align:start position:0%
well I C the fact I didn't 100% follow
 
01:44:27.270 --> 01:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
the concept but maybe that's just me but
 
01:44:29.629 --> 01:44:29.639 align:start position:0%
also like it just defined those trusts
 
01:44:32.149 --> 01:44:32.159 align:start position:0%
and then it there was didn't make any
 
01:44:34.030 --> 01:44:34.040 align:start position:0%
other changes anywhere in the law books
 
01:44:37.750 --> 01:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
I wasn't wasn't sure like uh what effect
 
01:44:39.390 --> 01:44:39.400 align:start position:0%
just are defining these things here if
 
01:44:41.510 --> 01:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
you don't have any other law that says
 
01:44:43.830 --> 01:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
how they how they operate so that's um
 
01:44:45.070 --> 01:44:45.080 align:start position:0%
definitely an issue that a study
 
01:44:46.589 --> 01:44:46.599 align:start position:0%
commission would probably want to
 
01:44:48.310 --> 01:44:48.320 align:start position:0%
committee would want to look like look
 
01:44:49.550 --> 01:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
like in advantage of having a study
 
01:44:52.270 --> 01:44:52.280 align:start position:0%
committee I guess over retaining it is
 
01:44:53.950 --> 01:44:53.960 align:start position:0%
then you can bring in people from uh
 
01:44:56.870 --> 01:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
from other you could there's three reps
 
01:44:58.629 --> 01:44:58.639 align:start position:0%
and one Senator so you can bring it well
 
01:45:00.310 --> 01:45:00.320 align:start position:0%
you can bring in a senator obviously but
 
01:45:01.709 --> 01:45:01.719 align:start position:0%
also you could bring in reps from
 
01:45:04.950 --> 01:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
outside this committee with with uh such
 
01:45:06.510 --> 01:45:06.520 align:start position:0%
as from the housing committee so I guess
 
01:45:08.310 --> 01:45:08.320 align:start position:0%
that's the advantage of having the study
 
01:45:10.669 --> 01:45:10.679 align:start position:0%
committee instead of just retaining it
 
01:45:12.070 --> 01:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
all right anyone else wish to be heard
 
01:45:14.830 --> 01:45:14.840 align:start position:0%
representative Smith my only comment is
 
01:45:18.189 --> 01:45:18.199 align:start position:0%
I um applaud representative Alexander's
 
01:45:19.990 --> 01:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
optimism that he can get a senator to
 
01:45:22.430 --> 01:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
show up thank you other uh
 
01:45:24.709 --> 01:45:24.719 align:start position:0%
representative p no yes thank you Mr
 
01:45:27.070 --> 01:45:27.080 align:start position:0%
chairman um aside from the fact that I
 
01:45:29.270 --> 01:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
wish representative this had gone to
 
01:45:31.669 --> 01:45:31.679 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander's committee on
 
01:45:33.510 --> 01:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
housing so we didn't have to vote on a
 
01:45:37.470 --> 01:45:37.480 align:start position:0%
study committee here um I randomly ran
 
01:45:40.910 --> 01:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
into a diff another State Rep last week
 
01:45:42.390 --> 01:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
while I was subbing on another committee
 
01:45:45.870 --> 01:45:45.880 align:start position:0%
and he suggested a similar idea so I
 
01:45:48.229 --> 01:45:48.239 align:start position:0%
think there is an appetite that I wasn't
 
01:45:49.709 --> 01:45:49.719 align:start position:0%
expecting and I forwarded this
 
01:45:52.550 --> 01:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
information onto him and I know he for
 
01:45:54.910 --> 01:45:54.920 align:start position:0%
one would like more opportunity to look
 
01:45:57.750 --> 01:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
into this topic anyone else wish to be
 
01:45:59.629 --> 01:45:59.639 align:start position:0%
heard so I guess I would say I I should
 
01:46:01.470 --> 01:46:01.480 align:start position:0%
note um I had the
 
01:46:03.870 --> 01:46:03.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity U to meet with
 
01:46:07.109 --> 01:46:07.119 align:start position:0%
representative Daniels and Mr Delano Who
 
01:46:09.310 --> 01:46:09.320 align:start position:0%
U it was it was a pleasure to meet with
 
01:46:11.669 --> 01:46:11.679 align:start position:0%
them on Saturday of this week to talk
 
01:46:13.310 --> 01:46:13.320 align:start position:0%
about this bill and I from my
 
01:46:17.310 --> 01:46:17.320 align:start position:0%
discussions with them um I I I tend to
 
01:46:19.629 --> 01:46:19.639 align:start position:0%
think that this you know this has great
 
01:46:22.109 --> 01:46:22.119 align:start position:0%
perspective great potential at least it
 
01:46:24.629 --> 01:46:24.639 align:start position:0%
seems to me to have great potential as
 
01:46:26.350 --> 01:46:26.360 align:start position:0%
something that you know the legislature
 
01:46:29.830 --> 01:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
would would want to uh move forward with
 
01:46:31.550 --> 01:46:31.560 align:start position:0%
um but as representative Alexander
 
01:46:33.070 --> 01:46:33.080 align:start position:0%
points out there are a number of things
 
01:46:34.510 --> 01:46:34.520 align:start position:0%
that I think we need to have more
 
01:46:36.669 --> 01:46:36.679 align:start position:0%
information on I mean just as an example
 
01:46:40.430 --> 01:46:40.440 align:start position:0%
two things that come to mind to me is um
 
01:46:43.990 --> 01:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
despite um uh Mr
 
01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:45.510 align:start position:0%
despite um uh Mr
Delano's

01:46:45.510 --> 01:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
Delano's
 
01:46:48.830 --> 01:46:48.840 align:start position:0%
efforts uh to explain it to me I'm not
 
01:46:51.390 --> 01:46:51.400 align:start position:0%
clear that I completely understand what
 
01:46:55.229 --> 01:46:55.239 align:start position:0%
the interest of some somebody who became
 
01:46:59.350 --> 01:46:59.360 align:start position:0%
who bought one of a house or a unit uh
 
01:47:01.550 --> 01:47:01.560 align:start position:0%
under the under one of these trusts
 
01:47:04.030 --> 01:47:04.040 align:start position:0%
apparently would be referred to as a
 
01:47:06.229 --> 01:47:06.239 align:start position:0%
householder um and I'm not quite sure
 
01:47:08.669 --> 01:47:08.679 align:start position:0%
how that how the how a householder's
 
01:47:12.470 --> 01:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
interest would compare with the owner of
 
01:47:14.270 --> 01:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
a fee simple or the owner of an interest
 
01:47:16.510 --> 01:47:16.520 align:start position:0%
in a condominium that kind of thing and
 
01:47:18.229 --> 01:47:18.239 align:start position:0%
the other thing is I apparently there
 
01:47:20.830 --> 01:47:20.840 align:start position:0%
are there is some this would have some
 
01:47:23.430 --> 01:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
tax implications on
 
01:47:26.790 --> 01:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
uh the uh the u local municipalities
 
01:47:28.750 --> 01:47:28.760 align:start position:0%
which I think would you know is a is a
 
01:47:30.870 --> 01:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
matter that we would want to get more
 
01:47:33.790 --> 01:47:33.800 align:start position:0%
information on so I think that the idea
 
01:47:36.229 --> 01:47:36.239 align:start position:0%
of Representative Alexander's uh study
 
01:47:38.629 --> 01:47:38.639 align:start position:0%
committee despite the fact that he's
 
01:47:40.350 --> 01:47:40.360 align:start position:0%
going to have to hear from the speaker
 
01:47:43.510 --> 01:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
about his displeasure over St study
 
01:47:45.430 --> 01:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
committees if ever there was one that
 
01:47:47.629 --> 01:47:47.639 align:start position:0%
was worth it this seems to me it it it
 
01:47:51.629 --> 01:47:51.639 align:start position:0%
is um and so I support U this this
 
01:47:53.709 --> 01:47:53.719 align:start position:0%
amendment um and I'm going to I'm going
 
01:47:56.270 --> 01:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
to uh vote for it and then vote for the
 
01:47:59.189 --> 01:47:59.199 align:start position:0%
the bill as amended representative
 
01:48:02.990 --> 01:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
bur thank you Mr chair uh I want to
 
01:48:05.350 --> 01:48:05.360 align:start position:0%
explain why I will vote against this
 
01:48:08.669 --> 01:48:08.679 align:start position:0%
amendment um I'm
 
01:48:13.030 --> 01:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
concerned that uh about the tax aspects
 
01:48:15.270 --> 01:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
of this I'm concerned about the
 
01:48:18.910 --> 01:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
potentiality of Sheltering money um that
 
01:48:21.629 --> 01:48:21.639 align:start position:0%
would normally go into the state uh
 
01:48:24.830 --> 01:48:24.840 align:start position:0%
coffers and
 
01:48:28.270 --> 01:48:28.280 align:start position:0%
I have my own doubts whether the
 
01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:29.550 align:start position:0%
I have my own doubts whether the
fundamental

01:48:29.550 --> 01:48:29.560 align:start position:0%
fundamental
 
01:48:32.910 --> 01:48:32.920 align:start position:0%
structure of what this bill attempts to
 
01:48:35.709 --> 01:48:35.719 align:start position:0%
do uh would be changed by a study
 
01:48:39.270 --> 01:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
committee rather than uh tinkering with
 
01:48:42.390 --> 01:48:42.400 align:start position:0%
it so I I don't support a study
 
01:48:44.470 --> 01:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
committee all right anyone else wish to
 
01:48:44.480 --> 01:48:45.229 align:start position:0%

sorry I'm turning uh going to turn to
 
01:53:46.870 --> 01:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
exact uh House Bill 620 FN relative to
 
01:53:48.870 --> 01:53:48.880 align:start position:0%
the exercise of the freedom of religion
 
01:53:50.470 --> 01:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
and the chair recognizes representative
 
01:53:52.790 --> 01:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
petal for a motion thank you than you Mr
 
01:53:54.870 --> 01:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
chair I move ought to pass on House Bill
 
01:53:57.109 --> 01:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
620 all right and I'm going to second
 
01:53:59.709 --> 01:53:59.719 align:start position:0%
that motion uh representative pel do you
 
01:54:02.470 --> 01:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
wish to speak to your motion yes I think
 
01:54:05.069 --> 01:54:05.079 align:start position:0%
this is an important um piece of
 
01:54:08.550 --> 01:54:08.560 align:start position:0%
legislation for our state it is um
 
01:54:10.709 --> 01:54:10.719 align:start position:0%
freedom of religion is recognized um
 
01:54:13.750 --> 01:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
through the courts but this would um
 
01:54:17.390 --> 01:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
recognize it through statute and would
 
01:54:19.910 --> 01:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
would require compelling interest test
 
01:54:23.430 --> 01:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
um which means that a substantial burden
 
01:54:26.589 --> 01:54:26.599 align:start position:0%
um would have to be proven so it's not
 
01:54:27.950 --> 01:54:27.960 align:start position:0%
just like you're
 
01:54:31.149 --> 01:54:31.159 align:start position:0%
randomly um practicing your religion it
 
01:54:32.669 --> 01:54:32.679 align:start position:0%
would have to be a compelling interest
 
01:54:35.189 --> 01:54:35.199 align:start position:0%
that does the government have an um very
 
01:54:37.750 --> 01:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
good reason to interfere with your um
 
01:54:39.750 --> 01:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
Freedom right to practice religion and
 
01:54:41.629 --> 01:54:41.639 align:start position:0%
the least restrictive means is there an
 
01:54:43.550 --> 01:54:43.560 align:start position:0%
alternative method to serve the public
 
01:54:46.390 --> 01:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
interest um I think this has been
 
01:54:50.350 --> 01:54:50.360 align:start position:0%
enacted in multiple States and with the
 
01:54:52.430 --> 01:54:52.440 align:start position:0%
increasing number of attacks on
 
01:54:55.149 --> 01:54:55.159 align:start position:0%
religious freedom it's it's necessary to
 
01:54:58.510 --> 01:54:58.520 align:start position:0%
um Implement in New
 
01:55:00.990 --> 01:55:01.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire anyone else wish to be heard
 
01:55:05.189 --> 01:55:05.199 align:start position:0%
on um House Bill 620 FN uh
 
01:55:07.669 --> 01:55:07.679 align:start position:0%
representative Burch um I'm an
 
01:55:10.750 --> 01:55:10.760 align:start position:0%
opposition to this uh proposed
 
01:55:13.510 --> 01:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
legislation microphone oh mic sorry
 
01:55:16.030 --> 01:55:16.040 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm in opposition to this proposed
 
01:55:20.270 --> 01:55:20.280 align:start position:0%
legislation it's not necessary we have a
 
01:55:23.790 --> 01:55:23.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Supreme Court decision on
 
01:55:27.229 --> 01:55:27.239 align:start position:0%
this very matter it has set out the law
 
01:55:28.990 --> 01:55:29.000 align:start position:0%
it's not particularly different than
 
01:55:32.550 --> 01:55:32.560 align:start position:0%
this legislation since the New Hampshire
 
01:55:35.229 --> 01:55:35.239 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court is ultimately the
 
01:55:38.709 --> 01:55:38.719 align:start position:0%
controlling voice on uh the
 
01:55:42.910 --> 01:55:42.920 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of such bills that um
 
01:55:44.950 --> 01:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
there's no need to do it that State
 
01:55:47.430 --> 01:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
versus Mack now it's been
 
01:55:50.510 --> 01:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
suggested that if the state supreme
 
01:55:52.950 --> 01:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
court changed its
 
01:55:56.390 --> 01:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
mind then we would have a state statute
 
01:55:59.390 --> 01:55:59.400 align:start position:0%
but that's kind of a loser because if we
 
01:56:02.830 --> 01:56:02.840 align:start position:0%
had a state statute that didn't pass the
 
01:56:05.910 --> 01:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Supreme Court definition
 
01:56:08.189 --> 01:56:08.199 align:start position:0%
of or decisions about
 
01:56:10.030 --> 01:56:10.040 align:start position:0%
constitutionality the fact that we have
 
01:56:13.790 --> 01:56:13.800 align:start position:0%
a statute would be uh overturned by the
 
01:56:19.709 --> 01:56:19.719 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court so basically I don't
 
01:56:21.990 --> 01:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
support passing legislation where
 
01:56:25.069 --> 01:56:25.079 align:start position:0%
there's no demonstrated need for it uh
 
01:56:28.229 --> 01:56:28.239 align:start position:0%
it just creates potential conflicts
 
01:56:30.910 --> 01:56:30.920 align:start position:0%
between bodies that are supposed to work
 
01:56:34.310 --> 01:56:34.320 align:start position:0%
cooperatively we did have testimony also
 
01:56:36.750 --> 01:56:36.760 align:start position:0%
that there's no definition here of
 
01:56:41.750 --> 01:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
religion and religious beliefs and uh
 
01:56:45.750 --> 01:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
the the spectrum of what's religious
 
01:56:49.750 --> 01:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
beliefs and not can go uh pretty far a
 
01:56:52.270 --> 01:56:52.280 align:start position:0%
field and whether we as a leg
 
01:56:55.830 --> 01:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
legislature can be involved in defining
 
01:56:58.030 --> 01:56:58.040 align:start position:0%
someone else's religious belief or
 
01:56:58.040 --> 01:56:59.629 align:start position:0%
someone else's religious belief or
religion

01:56:59.629 --> 01:56:59.639 align:start position:0%
religion
 
01:57:02.669 --> 01:57:02.679 align:start position:0%
is I'm not just thinking about the
 
01:57:07.310 --> 01:57:07.320 align:start position:0%
Church of Satan uh but maybe a step too
 
01:57:10.189 --> 01:57:10.199 align:start position:0%
far in what we need to do given we
 
01:57:12.189 --> 01:57:12.199 align:start position:0%
already have a ruling from the New
 
01:57:14.109 --> 01:57:14.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court thank you right
 
01:57:15.109 --> 01:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to be heard
 
01:57:15.119 --> 01:57:16.709 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to be heard
representative

01:57:16.709 --> 01:57:16.719 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:57:20.350 --> 01:57:20.360 align:start position:0%
couta I Echo much of what rep Burch said
 
01:57:21.830 --> 01:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
and I also just wanted to add that there
 
01:57:26.149 --> 01:57:26.159 align:start position:0%
was the concern about zoning related to
 
01:57:27.589 --> 01:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
religious use
 
01:57:31.510 --> 01:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
purposes in relation to this bill and
 
01:57:33.069 --> 01:57:33.079 align:start position:0%
for that reason I just can't support
 
01:57:34.550 --> 01:57:34.560 align:start position:0%
this bill although I do absolutely
 
01:57:36.229 --> 01:57:36.239 align:start position:0%
support the freedom of religion thank
 
01:57:38.830 --> 01:57:38.840 align:start position:0%
you all right anyone uh yes
 
01:57:42.149 --> 01:57:42.159 align:start position:0%
representative H um yes I I don't agree
 
01:57:44.390 --> 01:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
with the premise that uh religious
 
01:57:47.069 --> 01:57:47.079 align:start position:0%
freedom is under attack or at least any
 
01:57:49.189 --> 01:57:49.199 align:start position:0%
more so than any other freedoms are
 
01:57:52.629 --> 01:57:52.639 align:start position:0%
under attack which U so I'm not sure why
 
01:57:55.950 --> 01:57:55.960 align:start position:0%
an activity deserves more protection or
 
01:57:57.350 --> 01:57:57.360 align:start position:0%
less protection just because it calls
 
01:57:59.629 --> 01:57:59.639 align:start position:0%
itself a religion as opposed to whether
 
01:58:01.950 --> 01:58:01.960 align:start position:0%
it calls itself uh something else so I
 
01:58:04.870 --> 01:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
think um so I think this bill is uh I
 
01:58:07.750 --> 01:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
think as a I think this bill uh is if if
 
01:58:09.550 --> 01:58:09.560 align:start position:0%
it does anything useful at all is
 
01:58:10.910 --> 01:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
probably use at all is probably
 
01:58:14.189 --> 01:58:14.199 align:start position:0%
counterproductive and in any case uh I
 
01:58:15.950 --> 01:58:15.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't say there was no definition of
 
01:58:17.189 --> 01:58:17.199 align:start position:0%
religion in the bill but it was sort of
 
01:58:19.109 --> 01:58:19.119 align:start position:0%
a circular definition but it does refer
 
01:58:21.950 --> 01:58:21.960 align:start position:0%
to back to several U several provisions
 
01:58:23.629 --> 01:58:23.639 align:start position:0%
of of these federal and state
 
01:58:26.589 --> 01:58:26.599 align:start position:0%
constitutions I'm not sure this this
 
01:58:27.990 --> 01:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't add anything to what's already
 
01:58:29.629 --> 01:58:29.639 align:start position:0%
in the Constitution it just creates more
 
01:58:31.589 --> 01:58:31.599 align:start position:0%
TR trouble than it solves and of course
 
01:58:35.069 --> 01:58:35.079 align:start position:0%
it's it's unfair to institutions and
 
01:58:37.069 --> 01:58:37.079 align:start position:0%
organizations activities that don't
 
01:58:38.790 --> 01:58:38.800 align:start position:0%
describe themselves as religious as
 
01:58:40.709 --> 01:58:40.719 align:start position:0%
opposed to those which do describe
 
01:58:43.550 --> 01:58:43.560 align:start position:0%
themselves as religious so I'm I'm not
 
01:58:46.069 --> 01:58:46.079 align:start position:0%
voting for this bill thanks all right
 
01:58:48.709 --> 01:58:48.719 align:start position:0%
other anyone else wish to be heard so I
 
01:58:50.910 --> 01:58:50.920 align:start position:0%
guess I would just what I would say is I
 
01:58:53.790 --> 01:58:53.800 align:start position:0%
tend to support this I think that it is
 
01:58:56.390 --> 01:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
uh important and I think it's um it's
 
01:58:57.870 --> 01:58:57.880 align:start position:0%
it's worthwhile to just look at a little
 
01:59:01.470 --> 01:59:01.480 align:start position:0%
bit of history of this the the whole
 
01:59:03.750 --> 01:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
idea of religious freedom restoration
 
01:59:08.510 --> 01:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
acts um started after a 1996 1990 I
 
01:59:11.709 --> 01:59:11.719 align:start position:0%
believe decision by the US Supreme Court
 
01:59:14.189 --> 01:59:14.199 align:start position:0%
that basically said that a any law as if
 
01:59:16.790 --> 01:59:16.800 align:start position:0%
a law was of General applicability the
 
01:59:20.510 --> 01:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
fact that it might have might have a um
 
01:59:22.669 --> 01:59:22.679 align:start position:0%
uh a particular
 
01:59:24.629 --> 01:59:24.639 align:start position:0%
detrimental impact on religion was not
 
01:59:26.350 --> 01:59:26.360 align:start position:0%
enough to to
 
01:59:29.470 --> 01:59:29.480 align:start position:0%
uh uh to say that the law interfered
 
01:59:32.709 --> 01:59:32.719 align:start position:0%
with uh freedom of religion that my
 
01:59:35.069 --> 01:59:35.079 align:start position:0%
recollection is that decision by the
 
01:59:39.990 --> 01:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court was was uh greeted with
 
01:59:44.149 --> 01:59:44.159 align:start position:0%
bipartisan uh condemnation and it was a
 
01:59:46.950 --> 01:59:46.960 align:start position:0%
bipart the Congress of the United States
 
01:59:49.069 --> 01:59:49.079 align:start position:0%
passed the religious freedom restoration
 
01:59:52.830 --> 01:59:52.840 align:start position:0%
act on a by bipartisan vote
 
01:59:55.470 --> 01:59:55.480 align:start position:0%
the need for a state equivalent to that
 
01:59:58.069 --> 01:59:58.079 align:start position:0%
arose because there was a another later
 
02:00:01.470 --> 02:00:01.480 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court case Flores versus
 
02:00:06.109 --> 02:00:06.119 align:start position:0%
somebody uh in involving I think a in uh
 
02:00:08.550 --> 02:00:08.560 align:start position:0%
in Texas uh in which the Supreme Court
 
02:00:12.189 --> 02:00:12.199 align:start position:0%
said that while Congress
 
02:00:15.990 --> 02:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
could Grant greater protections to
 
02:00:18.750 --> 02:00:18.760 align:start position:0%
Religious Freedom in federal matters it
 
02:00:20.910 --> 02:00:20.920 align:start position:0%
didn't have the authority to do that at
 
02:00:22.589 --> 02:00:22.599 align:start position:0%
the state level that would be a
 
02:00:26.350 --> 02:00:26.360 align:start position:0%
violation of the um the 14th Amendment
 
02:00:28.870 --> 02:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
or in order the supremacy clause and so
 
02:00:31.229 --> 02:00:31.239 align:start position:0%
that's why we have this um it seems to
 
02:00:35.430 --> 02:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
me to be pretty important I don't see um
 
02:00:37.790 --> 02:00:37.800 align:start position:0%
the you know the concern on the with the
 
02:00:40.750 --> 02:00:40.760 align:start position:0%
zoning issues if the if a state if a
 
02:00:44.669 --> 02:00:44.679 align:start position:0%
state or a municipality has some uh uh
 
02:00:48.189 --> 02:00:48.199 align:start position:0%
compelling interest for why um a church
 
02:00:50.990 --> 02:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
or or some some religious activity
 
02:00:53.229 --> 02:00:53.239 align:start position:0%
shouldn't shouldn't be happening in a
 
02:00:56.149 --> 02:00:56.159 align:start position:0%
particular place or whatever they they
 
02:00:59.069 --> 02:00:59.079 align:start position:0%
they that will prevail but it does say
 
02:01:01.470 --> 02:01:01.480 align:start position:0%
that it it's got to be something that's
 
02:01:03.229 --> 02:01:03.239 align:start position:0%
that's pretty important in order for the
 
02:01:05.350 --> 02:01:05.360 align:start position:0%
state to interfere with religious
 
02:01:08.229 --> 02:01:08.239 align:start position:0%
activity so I think I think the bill uh
 
02:01:10.830 --> 02:01:10.840 align:start position:0%
makes sense and I intend to support it
 
02:01:14.550 --> 02:01:14.560 align:start position:0%
other anyone else uh wish to be heard
 
02:01:16.709 --> 02:01:16.719 align:start position:0%

02:05:46.069 --> 02:05:46.079 align:start position:0%
641 um relative to establishing a
 
02:05:48.350 --> 02:05:48.360 align:start position:0%
private right of action for civil rights
 
02:05:51.750 --> 02:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
violations and uh the chair uh recogn
 
02:05:54.790 --> 02:05:54.800 align:start position:0%
izes um representative Alexander for a
 
02:05:56.669 --> 02:05:56.679 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr chairman I move in
 
02:05:58.589 --> 02:05:58.599 align:start position:0%
expedient to
 
02:06:01.870 --> 02:06:01.880 align:start position:0%
legislate I right representative Perez
 
02:06:03.549 --> 02:06:03.559 align:start position:0%
you have a second I second all right so
 
02:06:05.189 --> 02:06:05.199 align:start position:0%
it's moved by representative Alexander
 
02:06:07.270 --> 02:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative Perez
 
02:06:08.549 --> 02:06:08.559 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander do you wish to
 
02:06:10.709 --> 02:06:10.719 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion yes very briefly I
 
02:06:13.189 --> 02:06:13.199 align:start position:0%
think um the testimony from the Attorney
 
02:06:14.549 --> 02:06:14.559 align:start position:0%
General's office was very enlightening
 
02:06:16.830 --> 02:06:16.840 align:start position:0%
on this um they indicated there are only
 
02:06:20.270 --> 02:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
about 215 complaints last year um 50 to
 
02:06:22.790 --> 02:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
55 of them Rose to certain standard that
 
02:06:24.910 --> 02:06:24.920 align:start position:0%
it need to get investigated and I made a
 
02:06:27.910 --> 02:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
point to ask um if the AG feels like
 
02:06:29.030 --> 02:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
they have sufficient staff to
 
02:06:31.830 --> 02:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
investigate these claims and um address
 
02:06:34.069 --> 02:06:34.079 align:start position:0%
them and they indicated that they do um
 
02:06:35.310 --> 02:06:35.320 align:start position:0%
so I just don't think this bill is
 
02:06:39.149 --> 02:06:39.159 align:start position:0%
needed at this time um so I would
 
02:06:43.229 --> 02:06:43.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:46.669 --> 02:06:46.679 align:start position:0%
itl right anyone else wish to be heard
 
02:06:48.790 --> 02:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
representative Rambo I just wanted to
 
02:06:50.390 --> 02:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
mention I I don't know that anybody's
 
02:06:52.109 --> 02:06:52.119 align:start position:0%
gotten a chance
 
02:06:54.109 --> 02:06:54.119 align:start position:0%
to see this but it appears that there oh
 
02:06:55.270 --> 02:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
is that what's just gotten handed out
 
02:06:57.270 --> 02:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
the amendment that just came out we just
 
02:07:00.149 --> 02:07:00.159 align:start position:0%
got notice of an potential Amendment uh
 
02:07:02.149 --> 02:07:02.159 align:start position:0%
from the AG's office so I I just didn't
 
02:07:04.069 --> 02:07:04.079 align:start position:0%
know if there was further discussion on
 
02:07:05.669 --> 02:07:05.679 align:start position:0%
that particularly this was just this is
 
02:07:06.669 --> 02:07:06.679 align:start position:0%
not in addition to what you're just
 
02:07:09.510 --> 02:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
talking about sorry I just I just saw an
 
02:07:10.950 --> 02:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
email come in recently and I wasn't sure
 
02:07:11.830 --> 02:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
if we had missed something on an
 
02:07:14.189 --> 02:07:14.199 align:start position:0%
amendment just wanted to clarify yes uh
 
02:07:16.669 --> 02:07:16.679 align:start position:0%
representative gthr had um emailed the
 
02:07:19.910 --> 02:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee just 10 minutes ago
 
02:07:21.270 --> 02:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
um saying that there is a potential
 
02:07:23.790 --> 02:07:23.800 align:start position:0%
amend amendment I told her if my motion
 
02:07:26.549 --> 02:07:26.559 align:start position:0%
of itl fails uh we can entertain the
 
02:07:29.750 --> 02:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
emotion uh the motion but actual or
 
02:07:31.669 --> 02:07:31.679 align:start position:0%
threat I mean I I still with the
 
02:07:33.990 --> 02:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
amendment would move it I just wanted to
 
02:07:35.870 --> 02:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
get it out there thanks could we just
 
02:07:39.109 --> 02:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
clarify because I have an amendment in
 
02:07:41.830 --> 02:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
hand the number is
 
02:07:44.069 --> 02:07:44.079 align:start position:0%
0406 is that the number we're talking
 
02:07:45.629 --> 02:07:45.639 align:start position:0%
about there no there's another one that
 
02:07:47.470 --> 02:07:47.480 align:start position:0%
just came in our inbox it's not a formal
 
02:07:49.910 --> 02:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment it's I believe it's just text
 
02:07:52.390 --> 02:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
of an amendment it's not a drafted one
 
02:07:55.189 --> 02:07:55.199 align:start position:0%
um representative gar had said it to us
 
02:07:58.350 --> 02:07:58.360 align:start position:0%
via email so and so I you know I should
 
02:07:58.360 --> 02:08:00.069 align:start position:0%
via email so and so I you know I should
say

02:08:00.069 --> 02:08:00.079 align:start position:0%
say
 
02:08:03.109 --> 02:08:03.119 align:start position:0%
um can I I I I didn't see that because I
 
02:08:04.629 --> 02:08:04.639 align:start position:0%
had you know I haven't checked my email
 
02:08:07.629 --> 02:08:07.639 align:start position:0%
since left but but am am I correct
 
02:08:09.030 --> 02:08:09.040 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander that the
 
02:08:10.950 --> 02:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
substance of that would be to allow the
 
02:08:12.709 --> 02:08:12.719 align:start position:0%
Attorney General to
 
02:08:15.589 --> 02:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
intervene uh in in
 
02:08:19.549 --> 02:08:19.559 align:start position:0%
cases I think that's the amendment
 
02:08:22.589 --> 02:08:22.599 align:start position:0%
0406 that we all have and should be
 
02:08:25.270 --> 02:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
moved that has the right to intervene I
 
02:08:27.669 --> 02:08:27.679 align:start position:0%
don't know what the one I haven't seen
 
02:08:30.830 --> 02:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
yet says there's new language that would
 
02:08:33.830 --> 02:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
add uh a sentence saying if the court or
 
02:08:35.589 --> 02:08:35.599 align:start position:0%
jury finds that the actual or threatened
 
02:08:38.109 --> 02:08:38.119 align:start position:0%
use of force violence property damage or
 
02:08:40.189 --> 02:08:40.199 align:start position:0%
trespass was a willful or knowing
 
02:08:41.790 --> 02:08:41.800 align:start position:0%
violation of this
 
02:08:44.030 --> 02:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
chapter okay okay that's the additional
 
02:08:46.149 --> 02:08:46.159 align:start position:0%
sentence I think representative garth's
 
02:08:48.669 --> 02:08:48.679 align:start position:0%
not nodding at me Mr chair so yeah uh
 
02:08:52.430 --> 02:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
representative bur uh I know I know it's
 
02:08:56.229 --> 02:08:56.239 align:start position:0%
proper not often done at at executive
 
02:08:59.830 --> 02:08:59.840 align:start position:0%
sessions uh to ask somebody who's not on
 
02:09:01.950 --> 02:09:01.960 align:start position:0%
the committee perhaps to speak and I see
 
02:09:05.229 --> 02:09:05.239 align:start position:0%
the representative here is here and
 
02:09:08.310 --> 02:09:08.320 align:start position:0%
maybe the representative can explain the
 
02:09:11.229 --> 02:09:11.239 align:start position:0%
bill for those the Amendments if it's if
 
02:09:13.870 --> 02:09:13.880 align:start position:0%
we're discussing the amendment well I
 
02:09:16.669 --> 02:09:16.679 align:start position:0%
she's here um
 
02:09:21.709 --> 02:09:21.719 align:start position:0%
I I guess what I would say is um
 
02:09:23.270 --> 02:09:23.280 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
02:09:23.280 --> 02:09:26.109 align:start position:0%
I mean
we

02:09:26.109 --> 02:09:26.119 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:09:28.950 --> 02:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
it we don't have a drafted Amendment
 
02:09:31.950 --> 02:09:31.960 align:start position:0%
this bill was was noted for executive
 
02:09:37.069 --> 02:09:37.079 align:start position:0%
session uh in a in proper form um
 
02:09:39.669 --> 02:09:39.679 align:start position:0%
representative G I guess I yes I'll if
 
02:09:41.910 --> 02:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
you want to speak very briefly to what
 
02:09:43.790 --> 02:09:43.800 align:start position:0%
the amendment does I think that really
 
02:09:48.189 --> 02:09:48.199 align:start position:0%
is the the only thing um and I'm that's
 
02:09:49.870 --> 02:09:49.880 align:start position:0%
not to say that we're necessarily going
 
02:09:51.109 --> 02:09:51.119 align:start position:0%
to take up the amendment but I think
 
02:09:52.350 --> 02:09:52.360 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate to hear what you have
 
02:09:53.669 --> 02:09:53.679 align:start position:0%
to say
 
02:09:57.030 --> 02:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
about uh thank you Mr chair and
 
02:09:58.990 --> 02:09:59.000 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee my name is Linda
 
02:10:02.549 --> 02:10:02.559 align:start position:0%
Harriet gath right I'm out of uh NASA um
 
02:10:06.149 --> 02:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
w nine so I just received unfortunately
 
02:10:08.470 --> 02:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
I just realized that it was sent to me
 
02:10:10.790 --> 02:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
at 9 something this morning but I was
 
02:10:12.350 --> 02:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
back here on my computer for the first
 
02:10:15.109 --> 02:10:15.119 align:start position:0%
time today and saw it that um it was
 
02:10:18.390 --> 02:10:18.400 align:start position:0%
sent to me by the ag office by Sean um
 
02:10:20.910 --> 02:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
and so I wanted the opportunity to get
 
02:10:22.510 --> 02:10:22.520 align:start position:0%
the amendment mment and that's what made
 
02:10:25.549 --> 02:10:25.559 align:start position:0%
me send you guys what the statement that
 
02:10:27.589 --> 02:10:27.599 align:start position:0%
he made this was something that was in
 
02:10:30.830 --> 02:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
the hearing um section two I think of
 
02:10:33.830 --> 02:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
the bill that he wanted to make a change
 
02:10:35.709 --> 02:10:35.719 align:start position:0%
it's not the one that he made he made
 
02:10:38.069 --> 02:10:38.079 align:start position:0%
the change on the original that you have
 
02:10:41.310 --> 02:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
there that allow them to have access but
 
02:10:43.109 --> 02:10:43.119 align:start position:0%
this is totally different and I think
 
02:10:45.830 --> 02:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
this is something that representative
 
02:10:47.350 --> 02:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
bir had brought up and had the
 
02:10:49.310 --> 02:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
conversation so all right so is this
 
02:10:51.069 --> 02:10:51.079 align:start position:0%
something that deals with the language
 
02:10:53.709 --> 02:10:53.719 align:start position:0%
of about a settlement yes okay this is
 
02:10:55.270 --> 02:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
in section
 
02:10:57.830 --> 02:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
two okay I'm just getting to see it
 
02:10:59.750 --> 02:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
myself actually
 
02:11:11.830 --> 02:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:15.109 --> 02:11:15.119 align:start position:0%
sure I literally just saw this one I
 
02:11:18.109 --> 02:11:18.119 align:start position:0%
sent it to you all okay so I haven't
 
02:11:20.229 --> 02:11:20.239 align:start position:0%
sent it but I can send it over to them
 
02:11:23.790 --> 02:11:23.800 align:start position:0%
and if you would hold off toat today I
 
02:11:23.800 --> 02:11:24.629 align:start position:0%
and if you would hold off toat today I
mean

02:11:24.629 --> 02:11:24.639 align:start position:0%
mean
 
02:11:27.870 --> 02:11:27.880 align:start position:0%
it's well any anybody else have any any
 
02:11:29.510 --> 02:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
questions for the yes representative
 
02:11:30.589 --> 02:11:30.599 align:start position:0%
yeah Mr chairman I just want to make
 
02:11:32.669 --> 02:11:32.679 align:start position:0%
sure I'm understanding correctly I I see
 
02:11:35.109 --> 02:11:35.119 align:start position:0%
the email but I don't see any attachment
 
02:11:37.589 --> 02:11:37.599 align:start position:0%
from OS is it just the language in line
 
02:11:40.390 --> 02:11:40.400 align:start position:0%
that's not been written up by
 
02:11:42.950 --> 02:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
s yes this is the language that was sent
 
02:11:45.629 --> 02:11:45.639 align:start position:0%
to me to send to OS okay so that there
 
02:11:47.549 --> 02:11:47.559 align:start position:0%
isn't actually an amendment from NOS
 
02:11:50.790 --> 02:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
though right am I right so all right
 
02:11:54.270 --> 02:11:54.280 align:start position:0%
representative forgan like um Sean Lock
 
02:11:56.669 --> 02:11:56.679 align:start position:0%
who's an Assistant Attorney General he
 
02:11:58.669 --> 02:11:58.679 align:start position:0%
he sent us the proposed language I guess
 
02:12:00.430 --> 02:12:00.440 align:start position:0%
Senate to her and then another
 
02:12:01.950 --> 02:12:01.960 align:start position:0%
individual and the text of the email
 
02:12:04.709 --> 02:12:04.719 align:start position:0%
rather then as a file attachment but
 
02:12:07.870 --> 02:12:07.880 align:start position:0%
right OS probably could all right but
 
02:12:09.870 --> 02:12:09.880 align:start position:0%
there's enough there for OLS probably to
 
02:12:11.030 --> 02:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much
 
02:12:14.189 --> 02:12:14.199 align:start position:0%
representative go appreciate it
 
02:12:16.669 --> 02:12:16.679 align:start position:0%
so it sounds like I'm sorry
 
02:12:16.679 --> 02:12:18.069 align:start position:0%
so it sounds like I'm sorry
representative

02:12:18.069 --> 02:12:18.079 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:12:20.229 --> 02:12:20.239 align:start position:0%
Smith oh no I I guess what I was going
 
02:12:24.189 --> 02:12:24.199 align:start position:0%
to say is it sounds like the language
 
02:12:27.629 --> 02:12:27.639 align:start position:0%
that if I'm understanding correctly from
 
02:12:30.830 --> 02:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
um what represented Manion showed me uh
 
02:12:33.510 --> 02:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
it it doesn't sound like this language
 
02:12:37.830 --> 02:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
really would have any effect at least in
 
02:12:39.589 --> 02:12:39.599 align:start position:0%
my view and I think in Al representative
 
02:12:41.189 --> 02:12:41.199 align:start position:0%
Alexander's view I suspect in the view
 
02:12:44.149 --> 02:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
of at least my caucus on whether on how
 
02:12:47.790 --> 02:12:47.800 align:start position:0%
we would vote on this bill so um in
 
02:12:51.390 --> 02:12:51.400 align:start position:0%
light of that um I'm I'm not inclined to
 
02:12:53.069 --> 02:12:53.079 align:start position:0%
uh to go further with the amendment
 
02:12:53.079 --> 02:12:54.310 align:start position:0%
uh to go further with the amendment
representative

02:12:54.310 --> 02:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:12:59.310 --> 02:12:59.320 align:start position:0%
Smith um Mr chair um I might have Mish
 
02:13:02.910 --> 02:13:02.920 align:start position:0%
heard my longtime dear
 
02:13:07.510 --> 02:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
colleague from um gtown about when he
 
02:13:10.669 --> 02:13:10.679 align:start position:0%
talked about the numbers of people I
 
02:13:13.589 --> 02:13:13.599 align:start position:0%
wondered if he could tell me what number
 
02:13:17.109 --> 02:13:17.119 align:start position:0%
of people denied their civil rights
 
02:13:18.830 --> 02:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
would be
 
02:13:22.390 --> 02:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
acceptable before the state should step
 
02:13:24.830 --> 02:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
in I think he said something like 24
 
02:13:27.390 --> 02:13:27.400 align:start position:0%
that's obviously below his standard
 
02:13:29.510 --> 02:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
could he tell me what the standard would
 
02:13:33.149 --> 02:13:33.159 align:start position:0%
be there is currently nobody's thank you
 
02:13:34.830 --> 02:13:34.840 align:start position:0%
for the question to my dear friend from
 
02:13:38.189 --> 02:13:38.199 align:start position:0%
Durham um there is currently nobody
 
02:13:40.430 --> 02:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
being denied civil rights violation
 
02:13:41.950 --> 02:13:41.960 align:start position:0%
that's not being adequately already
 
02:13:43.990 --> 02:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
invested by the AG's office this bill is
 
02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:44.750 align:start position:0%
invested by the AG's office this bill is
not

02:13:44.750 --> 02:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:13:47.790 --> 02:13:47.800 align:start position:0%
needed right all right anyone else wish
 
02:13:49.950 --> 02:13:49.960 align:start position:0%
to be heard on this so I guess I should
 
02:13:52.709 --> 02:13:52.719 align:start position:0%
say um because I had a I had a a
 
02:13:54.470 --> 02:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
discussion with representative goth last
 
02:13:58.750 --> 02:13:58.760 align:start position:0%
evening um I listened to the entire
 
02:14:01.470 --> 02:14:01.480 align:start position:0%
hearing on this bill and what I was
 
02:14:04.830 --> 02:14:04.840 align:start position:0%
taking away with um were a couple of
 
02:14:07.669 --> 02:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
things first of all I think it's really
 
02:14:11.310 --> 02:14:11.320 align:start position:0%
important to understand that it is not
 
02:14:14.510 --> 02:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
true that at the present time there is
 
02:14:18.390 --> 02:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
no basis for an individual to bring a
 
02:14:22.629 --> 02:14:22.639 align:start position:0%
claim um who has had their civil rights
 
02:14:26.669 --> 02:14:26.679 align:start position:0%
violated um in in the manners that are
 
02:14:29.830 --> 02:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
described in RSA
 
02:14:33.069 --> 02:14:33.079 align:start position:0%
354b I I as I looked at the
 
02:14:35.950 --> 02:14:35.960 align:start position:0%
statute and you know based on the common
 
02:14:40.030 --> 02:14:40.040 align:start position:0%
law it would be it would be a rare case
 
02:14:42.629 --> 02:14:42.639 align:start position:0%
in which something that would violate
 
02:14:42.639 --> 02:14:44.870 align:start position:0%
in which something that would violate
RSA

02:14:44.870 --> 02:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
02:14:48.669 --> 02:14:48.679 align:start position:0%
354b um would not also very likely
 
02:14:51.549 --> 02:14:51.559 align:start position:0%
amount to a common law tort
 
02:14:54.229 --> 02:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
of assault or battery or false
 
02:14:57.629 --> 02:14:57.639 align:start position:0%
imprisonment or or defamation or
 
02:15:00.430 --> 02:15:00.440 align:start position:0%
invasion of privacy or some other common
 
02:15:03.030 --> 02:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
law tour could there theoretically be
 
02:15:06.629 --> 02:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
some I suppose it's possible would the
 
02:15:08.950 --> 02:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
remedies I mean one of the things that I
 
02:15:10.950 --> 02:15:10.960 align:start position:0%
I remember hearing from the from the
 
02:15:13.950 --> 02:15:13.960 align:start position:0%
testimony at the hearing was a concern
 
02:15:16.910 --> 02:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
that well a court
 
02:15:19.990 --> 02:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
um uh it's only under the statute that a
 
02:15:21.790 --> 02:15:21.800 align:start position:0%
court could could Grant injunctive
 
02:15:23.790 --> 02:15:23.800 align:start position:0%
relief I that's not my understanding of
 
02:15:25.950 --> 02:15:25.960 align:start position:0%
the law if there's if somebody brings a
 
02:15:29.510 --> 02:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
common law lawsuit and alleges that
 
02:15:31.270 --> 02:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
somebody assaulted me and there's a
 
02:15:32.790 --> 02:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
threat that they're going to continue to
 
02:15:34.870 --> 02:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
assault me in the future or harass me or
 
02:15:37.350 --> 02:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
do whatever you can get an injunction in
 
02:15:39.870 --> 02:15:39.880 align:start position:0%
that circumstance also uh under the
 
02:15:42.870 --> 02:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
common law I think courts are fully uh
 
02:15:44.910 --> 02:15:44.920 align:start position:0%
uh capable of granting that kind of
 
02:15:48.189 --> 02:15:48.199 align:start position:0%
relief um so I think that that really
 
02:15:49.910 --> 02:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
builds upon what representative
 
02:15:51.470 --> 02:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
Alexander had said
 
02:15:54.629 --> 02:15:54.639 align:start position:0%
that this legislation is just not
 
02:15:58.390 --> 02:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
necessary um and I um and and again the
 
02:15:59.589 --> 02:15:59.599 align:start position:0%
other thing that I think was very
 
02:16:02.149 --> 02:16:02.159 align:start position:0%
important that rep that uh Mr Lock
 
02:16:05.229 --> 02:16:05.239 align:start position:0%
indicated in his testimony was that this
 
02:16:07.510 --> 02:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
is not it's not this is not at all a
 
02:16:09.910 --> 02:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
situation where the AG's office is
 
02:16:14.149 --> 02:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed with cases that um that are
 
02:16:16.870 --> 02:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
are brought to their attention and they
 
02:16:18.910 --> 02:16:18.920 align:start position:0%
can't bring or seek relief for all the
 
02:16:21.390 --> 02:16:21.400 align:start position:0%
cases that that exist that he said that
 
02:16:24.310 --> 02:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
their their office is fully able to
 
02:16:25.629 --> 02:16:25.639 align:start position:0%
handle the cases that are brought to
 
02:16:27.669 --> 02:16:27.679 align:start position:0%
them so that again reinforces
 
02:16:30.069 --> 02:16:30.079 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander's position uh
 
02:16:31.990 --> 02:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
for those reasons I intend to support
 
02:16:35.150 --> 02:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
the itl motion anyone else wish to be
 
02:16:36.309 --> 02:16:36.319 align:start position:0%
heard on
 
02:16:39.070 --> 02:16:39.080 align:start position:0%
this all right seeing none I would ask
 
02:16:42.190 --> 02:16:42.200 align:start position:0%
the uh clerk uh to call the role the
 
02:16:47.549 --> 02:16:47.559 align:start position:0%

02:18:18.950 --> 02:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
it's 10 to8 I'm very sorry I thought she
 
02:18:21.150 --> 02:18:21.160 align:start position:0%
voted all right so representative
 
02:18:23.190 --> 02:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
Alexander will write the majority report
 
02:18:28.990 --> 02:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:31.469 --> 02:18:31.479 align:start position:0%
minority did somebody else yeah
 
02:18:35.230 --> 02:18:35.240 align:start position:0%
somebody all right rbo minority okay I
 
02:18:37.190 --> 02:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
have a question of the chair if the
 
02:18:40.230 --> 02:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
since there was a we did have that email
 
02:18:42.190 --> 02:18:42.200 align:start position:0%
chain with the proposed amendment in it
 
02:18:44.110 --> 02:18:44.120 align:start position:0%
so would that have to be a floor
 
02:18:46.230 --> 02:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
Amendment if somebody wanted to move
 
02:18:47.589 --> 02:18:47.599 align:start position:0%
forward with it or could it be a
 
02:18:51.429 --> 02:18:51.439 align:start position:0%
minority Amendment um I
 
02:18:54.790 --> 02:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
hasn't drafted it wasn't I suppose yeah
 
02:18:55.830 --> 02:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
I think it would have to be a floor
 
02:18:58.990 --> 02:18:59.000 align:start position:0%
minute if the itl motion fails uh then
 
02:19:00.629 --> 02:19:00.639 align:start position:0%
there would be an opportunity for
 
02:19:02.309 --> 02:19:02.319 align:start position:0%
another motion yeah because what he had
 
02:19:04.429 --> 02:19:04.439 align:start position:0%
looked like it could very easily be be
 
02:19:08.270 --> 02:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:11.429 --> 02:19:11.439 align:start position:0%
drafted would be the majority right the
 
02:19:14.549 --> 02:19:14.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:18.070 --> 02:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
beot floor with a floor Amendment
 
02:19:36.870 --> 02:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:40.790 --> 02:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
we have to um have a floor Amendment
 
02:19:43.429 --> 02:19:43.439 align:start position:0%
drafted and she can get the information
 
02:19:48.990 --> 02:19:49.000 align:start position:0%
obviously right from either the Attorney
 
02:20:01.349 --> 02:20:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:04.590 --> 02:20:04.600 align:start position:0%
um no no no no no no you're right you're
 
02:20:08.870 --> 02:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:08.880 --> 02:20:12.230 align:start position:0%
 
that's

02:20:12.230 --> 02:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:17.389 --> 02:20:17.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:24.429 --> 02:20:24.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:24.439 --> 02:20:34.550 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:20:34.550 --> 02:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:38.429 --> 02:20:38.439 align:start position:0%
um I have samp none of these things
 
02:20:41.230 --> 02:20:41.240 align:start position:0%
are all right all right next I'm going
 
02:20:45.270 --> 02:20:45.280 align:start position:0%

FN and uh the chair recognizes uh
 
02:20:52.469 --> 02:20:52.479 align:start position:0%

hand those around
 
02:21:31.190 --> 02:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:35.030 --> 02:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
all right so let me uh so um hang on let
 
02:21:39.270 --> 02:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:45.590 --> 02:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
um so uh representative uh Alexander uh
 
02:21:48.230 --> 02:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
moves uh his Amendment and I'm uh for
 
02:21:50.670 --> 02:21:50.680 align:start position:0%
the record I will second that um
 
02:21:51.990 --> 02:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander do you wish to
 
02:21:54.790 --> 02:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
speak to your uh on the amendment yes so
 
02:21:56.429 --> 02:21:56.439 align:start position:0%
um it should be no surprise to the
 
02:21:58.150 --> 02:21:58.160 align:start position:0%
committee that this is a great bill and
 
02:22:00.110 --> 02:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
I think you should vote for it um there
 
02:22:02.230 --> 02:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
were a couple things raised during the
 
02:22:04.389 --> 02:22:04.399 align:start position:0%
public hearing um so this amendment
 
02:22:08.510 --> 02:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
makes two changes first it um
 
02:22:11.510 --> 02:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
addresses um it does the address of
 
02:22:13.270 --> 02:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
library card Library membership status
 
02:22:15.870 --> 02:22:15.880 align:start position:0%
keeps that but it removes on line 16 it
 
02:22:18.190 --> 02:22:18.200 align:start position:0%
used to be any member of the public
 
02:22:19.910 --> 02:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
library or Library staff it removes
 
02:22:21.870 --> 02:22:21.880 align:start position:0%
member of the public public um so it's
 
02:22:24.270 --> 02:22:24.280 align:start position:0%
just library or Library staff and then
 
02:22:26.510 --> 02:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
it doubles the Civil penalty from 500 to
 
02:22:30.950 --> 02:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
1,000 um but it doesn't it changes the
 
02:22:33.030 --> 02:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
the term restitution payment to civil
 
02:22:35.030 --> 02:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
penalty uh which was a suggestion during
 
02:22:35.910 --> 02:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
the public
 
02:22:38.870 --> 02:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
hearing all right all right anyone else
 
02:22:42.469 --> 02:22:42.479 align:start position:0%
wish to be heard on uh the amendment to
 
02:22:42.479 --> 02:22:45.309 align:start position:0%
wish to be heard on uh the amendment to
uh

02:22:45.309 --> 02:22:45.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:48.710 --> 02:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
666 oh yes yes ma'am uh thank you Mr
 
02:22:50.110 --> 02:22:50.120 align:start position:0%
chairman I was actually here for the
 
02:22:54.389 --> 02:22:54.399 align:start position:0%
hearing of this this bill and um I'm
 
02:22:57.630 --> 02:22:57.640 align:start position:0%
also a member of nlta I have no problem
 
02:22:59.190 --> 02:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
with library cards and Library
 
02:23:04.070 --> 02:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
membership status being um private and
 
02:23:07.190 --> 02:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
and not open to the public and I believe
 
02:23:10.270 --> 02:23:10.280 align:start position:0%
this committee already passed a bill
 
02:23:13.670 --> 02:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
that did just that I do have
 
02:23:17.349 --> 02:23:17.359 align:start position:0%
reservations with the um the damages
 
02:23:18.910 --> 02:23:18.920 align:start position:0%
that are being
 
02:23:21.389 --> 02:23:21.399 align:start position:0%
assessed I I thought even the original
 
02:23:26.190 --> 02:23:26.200 align:start position:0%
bill of 500 with a um apology that's
 
02:23:28.550 --> 02:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
notorized in public and so forth I just
 
02:23:30.950 --> 02:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
feel that like the damages are Way
 
02:23:36.750 --> 02:23:36.760 align:start position:0%
Beyond what um the crime so to speak is
 
02:23:39.750 --> 02:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
um you know these sometimes in small
 
02:23:43.150 --> 02:23:43.160 align:start position:0%
libraries Library staff people only
 
02:23:47.150 --> 02:23:47.160 align:start position:0%
work very minimum hours during the day
 
02:23:49.510 --> 02:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
and um something might have happened
 
02:23:52.110 --> 02:23:52.120 align:start position:0%
that they are not not even sure about so
 
02:23:56.429 --> 02:23:56.439 align:start position:0%
I just I just don't like um what is
 
02:23:59.790 --> 02:23:59.800 align:start position:0%
being asked of these people who might
 
02:24:01.990 --> 02:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
have made a mistake that they didn't
 
02:24:04.510 --> 02:24:04.520 align:start position:0%
even know that they were making um it
 
02:24:06.670 --> 02:24:06.680 align:start position:0%
seems kind of on the order of public
 
02:24:08.790 --> 02:24:08.800 align:start position:0%
flogging to
 
02:24:12.429 --> 02:24:12.439 align:start position:0%
me anyone else wish yes representative
 
02:24:15.790 --> 02:24:15.800 align:start position:0%
Perez I support this 100% I do not
 
02:24:19.790 --> 02:24:19.800 align:start position:0%
believe that not knowing what the law is
 
02:24:22.630 --> 02:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
is an excuse for not following the law
 
02:24:25.150 --> 02:24:25.160 align:start position:0%
if I get stopped for speeding can I say
 
02:24:27.710 --> 02:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
I didn't know that the speed limit was
 
02:24:31.269 --> 02:24:31.279 align:start position:0%
60 and I was doing 80
 
02:24:34.269 --> 02:24:34.279 align:start position:0%
so I support it right representative
 
02:24:37.990 --> 02:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
organ um well in the speeding is usually
 
02:24:41.429 --> 02:24:41.439 align:start position:0%
less than a $500 or, fine so just as I
 
02:24:44.030 --> 02:24:44.040 align:start position:0%
just want to underline what that that
 
02:24:46.230 --> 02:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
what Harvey said that this bill moves in
 
02:24:48.030 --> 02:24:48.040 align:start position:0%
the wrong direction in that regard that
 
02:24:50.990 --> 02:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
it's uh um um
 
02:24:53.830 --> 02:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
that it's a uh you know $500 was already
 
02:24:55.990 --> 02:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
an excessive penalty so A th000 is twice
 
02:24:57.950 --> 02:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
as excessive and also the whole rigma
 
02:24:59.990 --> 02:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
role about notor being forced to
 
02:25:01.870 --> 02:25:01.880 align:start position:0%
apologize and notarizing your apology
 
02:25:05.070 --> 02:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
and sending it certified mail um that's
 
02:25:05.910 --> 02:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
which actually though is an
 
02:25:07.790 --> 02:25:07.800 align:start position:0%
inconvenience for the person who also
 
02:25:09.830 --> 02:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
receives the apology since uh you get
 
02:25:11.590 --> 02:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
this scary looking slip of paper that
 
02:25:13.110 --> 02:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
your mail carrier drops you have to go
 
02:25:16.950 --> 02:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
to the Post Office Etc so that's um so I
 
02:25:18.269 --> 02:25:18.279 align:start position:0%
just I just think the whole thing is
 
02:25:20.070 --> 02:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
excessive and the amendment moves in the
 
02:25:22.670 --> 02:25:22.680 align:start position:0%
wrong Direction and um of course I also
 
02:25:24.870 --> 02:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
not really didn't quite understand what
 
02:25:27.870 --> 02:25:27.880 align:start position:0%
the basic uh rationale for the bill was
 
02:25:30.150 --> 02:25:30.160 align:start position:0%
either but so for all those reasons I
 
02:25:31.469 --> 02:25:31.479 align:start position:0%
vote against amendment which makes a
 
02:25:33.389 --> 02:25:33.399 align:start position:0%
bill that I didn't think was good and
 
02:25:35.429 --> 02:25:35.439 align:start position:0%
makes it slightly worse so thank all
 
02:25:36.550 --> 02:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
right anyone else wish be a
 
02:25:39.429 --> 02:25:39.439 align:start position:0%
representative CH yeah just just adding
 
02:25:41.870 --> 02:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
on to the sort of excessive nature I
 
02:25:43.349 --> 02:25:43.359 align:start position:0%
think of this bill I just wanted to
 
02:25:45.710 --> 02:25:45.720 align:start position:0%
clarify this is my reading of it uh
 
02:25:49.590 --> 02:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
since the um the penalty is payable from
 
02:25:52.309 --> 02:25:52.319 align:start position:0%
The Violator to the agreed individual
 
02:25:54.990 --> 02:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
whose information was released it seems
 
02:25:59.429 --> 02:25:59.439 align:start position:0%
like the the um if if if a library staff
 
02:26:01.670 --> 02:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
person not even the librarian any
 
02:26:04.070 --> 02:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
individual uh on staff if they were to
 
02:26:05.950 --> 02:26:05.960 align:start position:0%
say accidentally mail out a list that
 
02:26:09.990 --> 02:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
had some Librarians um uh had some some
 
02:26:12.150 --> 02:26:12.160 align:start position:0%
list of people who had library cards
 
02:26:14.269 --> 02:26:14.279 align:start position:0%
they would be paying up to $1,000 per
 
02:26:16.670 --> 02:26:16.680 align:start position:0%
individual who's so this could run into
 
02:26:18.710 --> 02:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
the hundreds of thousands of dollars for
 
02:26:20.750 --> 02:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
an individual not the library but an
 
02:26:23.389 --> 02:26:23.399 align:start position:0%
individual that seems excessive for what
 
02:26:24.550 --> 02:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
we're talking
 
02:26:26.910 --> 02:26:26.920 align:start position:0%
about representative bur then
 
02:26:29.309 --> 02:26:29.319 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander yeah following
 
02:26:34.830 --> 02:26:34.840 align:start position:0%
up that um I I join in those that feel
 
02:26:37.790 --> 02:26:37.800 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the bill and the first
 
02:26:42.190 --> 02:26:42.200 align:start position:0%
section is is fine but there troubling
 
02:26:46.429 --> 02:26:46.439 align:start position:0%
aspects on the uh the penalty end one of
 
02:26:49.990 --> 02:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
which is it's one thing for the state to
 
02:26:54.429 --> 02:26:54.439 align:start position:0%
find find people uh for violating a
 
02:26:57.190 --> 02:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
statute and then having that money go
 
02:26:59.750 --> 02:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
into you know the general fund or
 
02:27:04.269 --> 02:27:04.279 align:start position:0%
wherever it goes what this bill attempts
 
02:27:08.550 --> 02:27:08.560 align:start position:0%
to do is use
 
02:27:08.560 --> 02:27:10.150 align:start position:0%
to do is use
legislation

02:27:10.150 --> 02:27:10.160 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
02:27:13.910 --> 02:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
to um accomplish what a civil suit would
 
02:27:18.030 --> 02:27:18.040 align:start position:0%
do and it would replace if if my library
 
02:27:22.389 --> 02:27:22.399 align:start position:0%
card was uh or library card status and I
 
02:27:26.150 --> 02:27:26.160 align:start position:0%
do have a library card that was very old
 
02:27:30.630 --> 02:27:30.640 align:start position:0%
um if my status is disclosed and I feel
 
02:27:34.630 --> 02:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
like suing or speaking to the person I
 
02:27:37.110 --> 02:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
can and I can sue for damages or
 
02:27:39.030 --> 02:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
whatever and those damages could could
 
02:27:42.150 --> 02:27:42.160 align:start position:0%
be shown uh reputational or
 
02:27:45.269 --> 02:27:45.279 align:start position:0%
otherwise uh that's fine to have the
 
02:27:49.190 --> 02:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
state do it for me um and turn the money
 
02:27:50.750 --> 02:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
over to a private
 
02:27:54.309 --> 02:27:54.319 align:start position:0%
individual uh is is heading I think in
 
02:27:57.349 --> 02:27:57.359 align:start position:0%
in the wrong direction I'm also of
 
02:28:00.150 --> 02:28:00.160 align:start position:0%
course and my Town's a small town we
 
02:28:02.750 --> 02:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
have a very small Library we have I
 
02:28:02.760 --> 02:28:04.269 align:start position:0%
have a very small Library we have I
think

02:28:04.269 --> 02:28:04.279 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:28:07.030 --> 02:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
one.5 people that are involved in it
 
02:28:09.750 --> 02:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
they do the best they can uh they don't
 
02:28:13.429 --> 02:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
get involved in politics at all uh at
 
02:28:17.670 --> 02:28:17.680 align:start position:0%
least in their official capacity and as
 
02:28:21.269 --> 02:28:21.279 align:start position:0%
representative tur suggests this is an
 
02:28:24.590 --> 02:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
open-ended policy if a list goes out or
 
02:28:28.269 --> 02:28:28.279 align:start position:0%
or or legislation that could amount to T
 
02:28:30.910 --> 02:28:30.920 align:start position:0%
of thousands or hundreds of thousands of
 
02:28:34.269 --> 02:28:34.279 align:start position:0%
dollars for this uh individual who if
 
02:28:36.750 --> 02:28:36.760 align:start position:0%
they were acting in their
 
02:28:41.150 --> 02:28:41.160 align:start position:0%
capacity as a town employee should more
 
02:28:47.630 --> 02:28:47.640 align:start position:0%
properly be a uh a a tariff or penalty
 
02:28:51.590 --> 02:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
that the town pays but this bill makes
 
02:28:56.230 --> 02:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
it um uh on the back of the individual
 
02:28:59.790 --> 02:28:59.800 align:start position:0%
uh staff member or librarian and frankly
 
02:29:01.950 --> 02:29:01.960 align:start position:0%
in small towns I don't know about gof
 
02:29:04.830 --> 02:29:04.840 align:start position:0%
town because it's a large town uh but in
 
02:29:07.349 --> 02:29:07.359 align:start position:0%
small towns it's hard enough to get
 
02:29:10.790 --> 02:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
volunteers to work at places like
 
02:29:13.030 --> 02:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
libraries or work for a very small
 
02:29:15.790 --> 02:29:15.800 align:start position:0%
amount of money or volunteer for boards
 
02:29:18.830 --> 02:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
or this that and the other but to say if
 
02:29:20.590 --> 02:29:20.600 align:start position:0%
you make a mistake while you're doing
 
02:29:20.600 --> 02:29:22.230 align:start position:0%
you make a mistake while you're doing
your

02:29:22.230 --> 02:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
your
 
02:29:25.750 --> 02:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
job and you made a mistake uh and it's
 
02:29:28.950 --> 02:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
going to cost you personally Untold
 
02:29:31.710 --> 02:29:31.720 align:start position:0%
amount of money um that's going to make
 
02:29:34.630 --> 02:29:34.640 align:start position:0%
it really hard to get people to work at
 
02:29:37.429 --> 02:29:37.439 align:start position:0%
libraries thank you right representative
 
02:29:39.950 --> 02:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
Alexander yeah very briefly thank you Mr
 
02:29:41.910 --> 02:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
chair representative Burch paints such a
 
02:29:43.950 --> 02:29:43.960 align:start position:0%
great picture of what a small town
 
02:29:47.269 --> 02:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
library should look like um he you know
 
02:29:49.630 --> 02:29:49.640 align:start position:0%
pictures he portrays his small town
 
02:29:51.550 --> 02:29:51.560 align:start position:0%
library as one that doesn't make
 
02:29:54.630 --> 02:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
political statements and doesn't um
 
02:29:56.590 --> 02:29:56.600 align:start position:0%
isn't an activist library and I don't
 
02:29:58.389 --> 02:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
think necessarily all libraries are like
 
02:30:01.429 --> 02:30:01.439 align:start position:0%
that and so I while I appreciate that
 
02:30:03.429 --> 02:30:03.439 align:start position:0%
his library is like that there are
 
02:30:05.590 --> 02:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
others in the state that they're not so
 
02:30:07.750 --> 02:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
this bill is a simple bill that makes it
 
02:30:10.790 --> 02:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
so that public libraries do not violate
 
02:30:12.670 --> 02:30:12.680 align:start position:0%
somebody's privacy and if they do it's
 
02:30:16.230 --> 02:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
a$1 thousand, fine I don't understand um
 
02:30:18.870 --> 02:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
why it why it's as contentious as it is
 
02:30:20.469 --> 02:30:20.479 align:start position:0%
I think protecting people's privacy is
 
02:30:21.590 --> 02:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
02:30:25.070 --> 02:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
uh duties of our committee all right all
 
02:30:28.550 --> 02:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
right representative Smith uh thank you
 
02:30:31.550 --> 02:30:31.560 align:start position:0%
very much um I certainly agree that
 
02:30:34.110 --> 02:30:34.120 align:start position:0%
protecting privacy is one of the
 
02:30:36.510 --> 02:30:36.520 align:start position:0%
important roles of this committee and we
 
02:30:38.389 --> 02:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
have several bills that we'll be voting
 
02:30:43.030 --> 02:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
on today um that work to PR uh protect
 
02:30:46.349 --> 02:30:46.359 align:start position:0%
privacy I'm not sure that this bill is
 
02:30:49.790 --> 02:30:49.800 align:start position:0%
one to fall in that category we all know
 
02:30:52.230 --> 02:30:52.240 align:start position:0%
and sometimes are amused by our
 
02:30:54.550 --> 02:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
colleagues who come in there who in here
 
02:30:57.710 --> 02:30:57.720 align:start position:0%
and have been upset by a decision that
 
02:31:00.429 --> 02:31:00.439 align:start position:0%
was made in their local town I think of
 
02:31:02.950 --> 02:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
one of our Representatives who came in
 
02:31:04.710 --> 02:31:04.720 align:start position:0%
last year because he wanted to hold a
 
02:31:08.710 --> 02:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
meeting and a particular facility said
 
02:31:12.070 --> 02:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
no they wouldn't permit that meeting and
 
02:31:16.309 --> 02:31:16.319 align:start position:0%
so he wanted us to um to have a bill my
 
02:31:19.110 --> 02:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
feeling on that bill was what ought to
 
02:31:21.110 --> 02:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
happen is he ought to figure out how to
 
02:31:23.230 --> 02:31:23.240 align:start position:0%
talk with the people in his town to get
 
02:31:23.240 --> 02:31:24.110 align:start position:0%
talk with the people in his town to get
an

02:31:24.110 --> 02:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
an
 
02:31:27.110 --> 02:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
accommodation this bill is one of a
 
02:31:30.349 --> 02:31:30.359 align:start position:0%
series that we have that we have had
 
02:31:32.670 --> 02:31:32.680 align:start position:0%
before us and that we have treated
 
02:31:35.070 --> 02:31:35.080 align:start position:0%
respectfully that came out of a
 
02:31:38.190 --> 02:31:38.200 align:start position:0%
particular situation in a particular
 
02:31:42.190 --> 02:31:42.200 align:start position:0%
town in which a Court ruled that in fact
 
02:31:44.710 --> 02:31:44.720 align:start position:0%
the library had not done anything wrong
 
02:31:47.830 --> 02:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
had not done anything political um but
 
02:31:50.990 --> 02:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
still there is a lot of anger that town
 
02:31:52.550 --> 02:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
had an election
 
02:31:56.910 --> 02:31:56.920 align:start position:0%
yesterday and to vote for people to um
 
02:32:00.190 --> 02:32:00.200 align:start position:0%
be library trusties and as I understand
 
02:32:02.630 --> 02:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
it the winners in that election were
 
02:32:05.750 --> 02:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
people who thought that they had respect
 
02:32:07.590 --> 02:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
for the library and the way the library
 
02:32:11.150 --> 02:32:11.160 align:start position:0%
was functioning and didn't need anything
 
02:32:15.670 --> 02:32:15.680 align:start position:0%
else um I don't think we should use the
 
02:32:21.389 --> 02:32:21.399 align:start position:0%
power and the um integrity of the J
 
02:32:26.230 --> 02:32:26.240 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee to try to um appease
 
02:32:29.790 --> 02:32:29.800 align:start position:0%
the anger of one or another whether it's
 
02:32:32.710 --> 02:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
a person in on our committee who we
 
02:32:34.429 --> 02:32:34.439 align:start position:0%
respect and love or whether it's a
 
02:32:36.070 --> 02:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
person who's not in our committee in
 
02:32:39.670 --> 02:32:39.680 align:start position:0%
respect to love this is over the toop
 
02:32:44.070 --> 02:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
the fine is unbelievably inappropriate
 
02:32:49.510 --> 02:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
the public um uh the public apology is
 
02:32:52.910 --> 02:32:52.920 align:start position:0%
to totally irrelevant unless things have
 
02:32:55.550 --> 02:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
come to the stage where we're going to
 
02:33:00.590 --> 02:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
build um something in front of town hall
 
02:33:02.870 --> 02:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
um build stocks in front of town hall
 
02:33:06.030 --> 02:33:06.040 align:start position:0%
where we can periodically put people we
 
02:33:08.309 --> 02:33:08.319 align:start position:0%
don't approve of in the stocks and I
 
02:33:10.349 --> 02:33:10.359 align:start position:0%
don't think we're there yet I don't
 
02:33:12.469 --> 02:33:12.479 align:start position:0%
think we should pass the Bill no matter
 
02:33:15.389 --> 02:33:15.399 align:start position:0%
how much we like this moners all right
 
02:33:17.110 --> 02:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
representative Horan if you have
 
02:33:19.910 --> 02:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
something new I'm sorry R Manos were you
 
02:33:22.309 --> 02:33:22.319 align:start position:0%
yes just in the oh hold on oh just
 
02:33:24.630 --> 02:33:24.640 align:start position:0%
instance of full disclosure I realize I
 
02:33:26.630 --> 02:33:26.640 align:start position:0%
actually have three library cards I'm
 
02:33:27.950 --> 02:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
caring around with them one of them is
 
02:33:29.830 --> 02:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
from a library located in another stat
 
02:33:32.030 --> 02:33:32.040 align:start position:0%
it's not in a jurisdiction but I do have
 
02:33:33.990 --> 02:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
not one I have cards from the Durham
 
02:33:36.429 --> 02:33:36.439 align:start position:0%
public library and the UNH libraries and
 
02:33:38.389 --> 02:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
by the way I think anybody in state so I
 
02:33:40.309 --> 02:33:40.319 align:start position:0%
just want to say I'm not so I have
 
02:33:42.790 --> 02:33:42.800 align:start position:0%
nothing to hide on this issue about okay
 
02:33:45.190 --> 02:33:45.200 align:start position:0%
I do have I do confess to having library
 
02:33:47.790 --> 02:33:47.800 align:start position:0%
cards all right representative Manos I
 
02:33:49.510 --> 02:33:49.520 align:start position:0%
just wanted to add to the discussion
 
02:33:52.150 --> 02:33:52.160 align:start position:0%
that there's um if there's a factual
 
02:33:54.830 --> 02:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
dispute about whether there was explicit
 
02:33:58.630 --> 02:33:58.640 align:start position:0%
consent um there's no due process in
 
02:34:01.429 --> 02:34:01.439 align:start position:0%
this uh in this bill there's no
 
02:34:03.429 --> 02:34:03.439 align:start position:0%
adjudication there's no process for
 
02:34:07.510 --> 02:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
determining what the facts are and um I
 
02:34:09.830 --> 02:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
oppose it for those reasons in addition
 
02:34:12.950 --> 02:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
to the others all right any uh any other
 
02:34:14.870 --> 02:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
comments so I guess I would what I would
 
02:34:17.190 --> 02:34:17.200 align:start position:0%
say is I think I'm I intend to support
 
02:34:20.670 --> 02:34:20.680 align:start position:0%
the amendment I you know I
 
02:34:23.269 --> 02:34:23.279 align:start position:0%
I do I swallow a little hard about the
 
02:34:25.429 --> 02:34:25.439 align:start position:0%
amount of the fine and the apology me
 
02:34:29.230 --> 02:34:29.240 align:start position:0%
yeah but I I defer to what to the the
 
02:34:31.590 --> 02:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
view of my colleagues in my caucus on
 
02:34:34.830 --> 02:34:34.840 align:start position:0%
this and so I intend to support it um
 
02:34:37.349 --> 02:34:37.359 align:start position:0%
all right so I guess the first thing is
 
02:34:40.830 --> 02:34:40.840 align:start position:0%
a vote on the amendment I will do a roll
 
02:34:42.510 --> 02:34:42.520 align:start position:0%
call vote on the amendment if anybody
 
02:34:45.349 --> 02:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
wants it anybody I would like a roll
 
02:34:46.950 --> 02:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
call vote all right so we'll have a roll
 
02:34:50.630 --> 02:34:50.640 align:start position:0%
call vote on Amendment
 
02:34:50.640 --> 02:34:52.269 align:start position:0%

all right uh next I'm going to uh take
 
02:37:58.309 --> 02:37:58.319 align:start position:0%
this a little bit out of order um but I
 
02:37:58.319 --> 02:38:00.030 align:start position:0%
this a little bit out of order um but I
think

02:38:00.030 --> 02:38:00.040 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:38:00.040 --> 02:38:01.790 align:start position:0%
think
um

02:38:01.790 --> 02:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:06.150 --> 02:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
um it's appropriate I'm going to turn to
 
02:38:08.950 --> 02:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
hcr1 and I'm going to recognize myself
 
02:38:11.309 --> 02:38:11.319 align:start position:0%
and I move to
 
02:38:16.510 --> 02:38:16.520 align:start position:0%
retain um HCR 11 is there second second
 
02:38:18.590 --> 02:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
all right so it's been moved by um
 
02:38:21.030 --> 02:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
representative Lyn seconded by um
 
02:38:24.389 --> 02:38:24.399 align:start position:0%
representative Manos and I
 
02:38:29.150 --> 02:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
um I apologize uh and I would uh I just
 
02:38:32.630 --> 02:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
speak very briefly um to this uh
 
02:38:32.640 --> 02:38:36.389 align:start position:0%
speak very briefly um to this uh
resolution

02:38:36.389 --> 02:38:36.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:39.670 --> 02:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
um I I have to say I'm just going to say
 
02:38:42.870 --> 02:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
candidly I
 
02:38:45.830 --> 02:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
um there's a great deal in that
 
02:38:49.790 --> 02:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
resolution that I am very sympathetic to
 
02:38:52.510 --> 02:38:52.520 align:start position:0%
um in terms of separation of powers
 
02:38:57.190 --> 02:38:57.200 align:start position:0%
issues um I think this is not an
 
02:39:01.830 --> 02:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate time um for us to be issuing
 
02:39:04.790 --> 02:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
a resolution like this where there is a
 
02:39:07.349 --> 02:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
matter that the resolution deals with
 
02:39:12.950 --> 02:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
that is um that is pending before um
 
02:39:14.630 --> 02:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
another branch of government the the
 
02:39:17.389 --> 02:39:17.399 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court so I think that the most
 
02:39:20.710 --> 02:39:20.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate thing to do is for us to
 
02:39:25.670 --> 02:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
retain this um for perhaps another
 
02:39:27.670 --> 02:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
occasion when it might uh make more
 
02:39:29.950 --> 02:39:29.960 align:start position:0%
sense and that's all I'll say about that
 
02:39:32.870 --> 02:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to be heard on hcr1 yes
 
02:39:34.710 --> 02:39:34.720 align:start position:0%
representative Manos thank you Mr chair
 
02:39:37.190 --> 02:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
I just want to clarify your intention
 
02:39:40.389 --> 02:39:40.399 align:start position:0%
you want to retain it but not work on it
 
02:39:44.269 --> 02:39:44.279 align:start position:0%
you just want to hold it for future
 
02:39:47.110 --> 02:39:47.120 align:start position:0%
consideration well I you know perhaps
 
02:39:51.309 --> 02:39:51.319 align:start position:0%
work on it I mean I you know if I if uh
 
02:39:53.590 --> 02:39:53.600 align:start position:0%
you know have I sort of gone through
 
02:39:55.630 --> 02:39:55.640 align:start position:0%
line by line and scrubbed every line to
 
02:39:57.389 --> 02:39:57.399 align:start position:0%
see if I might change no I haven't done
 
02:40:00.309 --> 02:40:00.319 align:start position:0%
that so to the extent that that could
 
02:40:03.030 --> 02:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
there be some changes yes but but in but
 
02:40:05.710 --> 02:40:05.720 align:start position:0%
I I you know I think you are also
 
02:40:08.309 --> 02:40:08.319 align:start position:0%
correct that I think that timing is is
 
02:40:10.550 --> 02:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh is very important and I think this is
 
02:40:12.870 --> 02:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
not the appropriate time representative
 
02:40:17.790 --> 02:40:17.800 align:start position:0%
Smith um yes I I agree with you Mr
 
02:40:19.710 --> 02:40:19.720 align:start position:0%
chairman that this is not the
 
02:40:24.349 --> 02:40:24.359 align:start position:0%
appropriate time for um this particular
 
02:40:28.950 --> 02:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
uh HCR um I actually believe that there
 
02:40:33.510 --> 02:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
is no time that is appropriate for this
 
02:40:36.349 --> 02:40:36.359 align:start position:0%
and I believe that I have been elected
 
02:40:37.910 --> 02:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
by my
 
02:40:41.910 --> 02:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
constituents not by my caucus not by
 
02:40:45.389 --> 02:40:45.399 align:start position:0%
party leadership but my constituents to
 
02:40:47.950 --> 02:40:47.960 align:start position:0%
to carry out my
 
02:40:50.150 --> 02:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
responsibilities which
 
02:40:53.750 --> 02:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
include a respect for the constitution
 
02:40:56.230 --> 02:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
of this state and a respect for the
 
02:40:59.469 --> 02:40:59.479 align:start position:0%
importance of separation of powers so
 
02:41:02.870 --> 02:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
that if I had an opportunity to vote on
 
02:41:05.269 --> 02:41:05.279 align:start position:0%
the merits of this bill I would be
 
02:41:10.030 --> 02:41:10.040 align:start position:0%
voting no and or in the vernacular itl
 
02:41:14.830 --> 02:41:14.840 align:start position:0%
and I will therefore also be voting no
 
02:41:17.070 --> 02:41:17.080 align:start position:0%
on um
 
02:41:20.110 --> 02:41:20.120 align:start position:0%
retain uh clearly not because I then
 
02:41:22.150 --> 02:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
want to have an A to pass motion thank
 
02:41:23.750 --> 02:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
you right anyone else wish to be heard
 
02:41:27.070 --> 02:41:27.080 align:start position:0%
representative Horan um two two other
 
02:41:30.030 --> 02:41:30.040 align:start position:0%
well two practical considerations are is
 
02:41:32.710 --> 02:41:32.720 align:start position:0%
first of all uh the rules of the other
 
02:41:34.790 --> 02:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
body they need a two-thirds vote even to
 
02:41:38.070 --> 02:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
consider an HCR so it's not even if this
 
02:41:39.910 --> 02:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
even if we send it over there there's I
 
02:41:41.269 --> 02:41:41.279 align:start position:0%
suppose we shouldn't speculate about
 
02:41:42.910 --> 02:41:42.920 align:start position:0%
what some body would do but you know
 
02:41:45.110 --> 02:41:45.120 align:start position:0%
there's more likely than not to not even
 
02:41:48.070 --> 02:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
take this up but also we're going to one
 
02:41:50.910 --> 02:41:50.920 align:start position:0%
way or another either pass a budget or a
 
02:41:53.389 --> 02:41:53.399 align:start position:0%
continuing resolution before a retained
 
02:41:56.469 --> 02:41:56.479 align:start position:0%
Bill hearing could be held and um that
 
02:42:00.790 --> 02:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
will uh presumably uh I guess once again
 
02:42:02.389 --> 02:42:02.399 align:start position:0%
maybe I shouldn't speculate even about
 
02:42:03.790 --> 02:42:03.800 align:start position:0%
this body do but I think there's a very
 
02:42:05.710 --> 02:42:05.720 align:start position:0%
high probability that it'll be similar
 
02:42:07.070 --> 02:42:07.080 align:start position:0%
to past budgets so there'll be
 
02:42:09.349 --> 02:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
controversy over it there'll be more uh
 
02:42:11.510 --> 02:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
more court cases but it's probably not
 
02:42:14.070 --> 02:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
going to settle the it's probably not
 
02:42:16.110 --> 02:42:16.120 align:start position:0%
going to settle the objections of the
 
02:42:17.630 --> 02:42:17.640 align:start position:0%
various Court decisions that have been
 
02:42:19.389 --> 02:42:19.399 align:start position:0%
made over the years even though those
 
02:42:21.230 --> 02:42:21.240 align:start position:0%
Curt decisions are based not just on the
 
02:42:22.830 --> 02:42:22.840 align:start position:0%
state constitution but also on the
 
02:42:25.190 --> 02:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
statute which I guess was passed 32
 
02:42:26.830 --> 02:42:26.840 align:start position:0%
years ago and there's been we're in our
 
02:42:30.150 --> 02:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
16th or 17th budget cycle since that
 
02:42:32.990 --> 02:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
series of lawsuits started but any but
 
02:42:36.190 --> 02:42:36.200 align:start position:0%
as a pract just as a practical matter uh
 
02:42:37.670 --> 02:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
um we're probably going to pass a budget
 
02:42:40.550 --> 02:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
which probably will not satisfy uh
 
02:42:42.510 --> 02:42:42.520 align:start position:0%
satisfy those who brought the lawsuits
 
02:42:44.429 --> 02:42:44.439 align:start position:0%
that were objecting to so all right
 
02:42:45.429 --> 02:42:45.439 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to be heard
 
02:42:47.990 --> 02:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
representative McFarland well I
 
02:42:49.790 --> 02:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
certainly concur with you Mr chairman
 
02:42:52.030 --> 02:42:52.040 align:start position:0%
that the timing of this is is not ripe
 
02:42:53.910 --> 02:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh at the moment I I also feel i' would
 
02:42:55.510 --> 02:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
be doing my constituents a significant
 
02:42:57.830 --> 02:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
disservice if I didn't work to amarate
 
02:42:59.750 --> 02:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
the language so I'm supporting
 
02:43:01.950 --> 02:43:01.960 align:start position:0%
retain representative
 
02:43:06.030 --> 02:43:06.040 align:start position:0%
Burch thank you Mr chair
 
02:43:09.070 --> 02:43:09.080 align:start position:0%
um I will vote against retaining because
 
02:43:11.710 --> 02:43:11.720 align:start position:0%
I don't personally believe as suggested
 
02:43:14.110 --> 02:43:14.120 align:start position:0%
by representative Smith that there will
 
02:43:19.190 --> 02:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
ever be a time to pass a uh bill that is
 
02:43:22.710 --> 02:43:22.720 align:start position:0%
is so disrespectful of another branch of
 
02:43:25.670 --> 02:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
government that this is that in the very
 
02:43:29.349 --> 02:43:29.359 align:start position:0%
first paragraph quoting the uh
 
02:43:31.190 --> 02:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
constitution of the State of New
 
02:43:34.030 --> 02:43:34.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the bill doesn't even fully
 
02:43:39.309 --> 02:43:39.319 align:start position:0%
quote article 37 of part one uh in full
 
02:43:43.269 --> 02:43:43.279 align:start position:0%
but leaves out the section that says as
 
02:43:45.550 --> 02:43:45.560 align:start position:0%
consistent with that chain of connection
 
02:43:47.710 --> 02:43:47.720 align:start position:0%
that binds the whole fabric of the
 
02:43:51.510 --> 02:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
constitution in one indisoluble Bond of
 
02:43:56.950 --> 02:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
unity and family Amity so um I will vote
 
02:43:59.790 --> 02:43:59.800 align:start position:0%
against the motion to retain and should
 
02:44:02.190 --> 02:44:02.200 align:start position:0%
that motion be defeated vote against the
 
02:44:05.630 --> 02:44:05.640 align:start position:0%
bill all right anyone else wish to uh
 
02:44:07.230 --> 02:44:07.240 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to be heard
 
02:44:10.349 --> 02:44:10.359 align:start position:0%
representative Manos thank you Mr chair
 
02:44:13.630 --> 02:44:13.640 align:start position:0%
I I believe strongly very strongly in
 
02:44:15.990 --> 02:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
the separation of powers and I think
 
02:44:19.150 --> 02:44:19.160 align:start position:0%
it's completely inappropriate for the
 
02:44:23.150 --> 02:44:23.160 align:start position:0%
legislature to be dictating to the um
 
02:44:25.990 --> 02:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
judicial branch what the outcome of
 
02:44:30.230 --> 02:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
cases or uh the providing guidance on
 
02:44:32.990 --> 02:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
cases I think it's totally inappropriate
 
02:44:35.590 --> 02:44:35.600 align:start position:0%
but in addition to that I would point
 
02:44:37.389 --> 02:44:37.399 align:start position:0%
out that this is a house concurrent
 
02:44:40.070 --> 02:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
resolution it has even if it were passed
 
02:44:43.950 --> 02:44:43.960 align:start position:0%
it has no force of Law And for those two
 
02:44:46.510 --> 02:44:46.520 align:start position:0%
reasons I will vote against retaining
 
02:44:48.269 --> 02:44:48.279 align:start position:0%
and against the underlying Bill all
 
02:44:50.349 --> 02:44:50.359 align:start position:0%
right anyone else wish to be heard all
 
02:44:52.349 --> 02:44:52.359 align:start position:0%
right seeing none I would ask the clerk
 
02:44:57.389 --> 02:44:57.399 align:start position:0%
to call the role the motion is to retain
 
02:44:59.870 --> 02:44:59.880 align:start position:0%

um thank you Mr chair for giving me the
 
02:46:45.510 --> 02:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
honor of moving
 
02:46:49.429 --> 02:46:49.439 align:start position:0%
itl on hr11
 
02:46:52.790 --> 02:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
all right um I will uh so representative
 
02:46:56.190 --> 02:46:56.200 align:start position:0%
Smith moves I will second that motion um
 
02:46:57.630 --> 02:46:57.640 align:start position:0%
and representative Smith do you wish to
 
02:47:05.590 --> 02:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:08.309 --> 02:47:08.319 align:start position:0%
motion I'm I'm hesitating because
 
02:47:12.030 --> 02:47:12.040 align:start position:0%
clearly uh my mood today has gotten a
 
02:47:12.040 --> 02:47:13.309 align:start position:0%
clearly uh my mood today has gotten a
little

02:47:13.309 --> 02:47:13.319 align:start position:0%
little
 
02:47:13.319 --> 02:47:15.150 align:start position:0%
little
more

02:47:15.150 --> 02:47:15.160 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:47:19.550 --> 02:47:19.560 align:start position:0%
um insistent than is usually the case I
 
02:47:22.790 --> 02:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
find that the bill having been
 
02:47:25.150 --> 02:47:25.160 align:start position:0%
introduced is
 
02:47:25.160 --> 02:47:26.910 align:start position:0%
introduced is
even

02:47:26.910 --> 02:47:26.920 align:start position:0%
even
 
02:47:29.790 --> 02:47:29.800 align:start position:0%
um offensive to the
 
02:47:34.590 --> 02:47:34.600 align:start position:0%
principles of uh the government of the
 
02:47:38.670 --> 02:47:38.680 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire and
 
02:47:45.630 --> 02:47:45.640 align:start position:0%
um to to threaten to impeach a
 
02:47:49.190 --> 02:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
judge not for having his hand in the ti
 
02:47:52.510 --> 02:47:52.520 align:start position:0%
not for inappropriate personal Behavior
 
02:47:55.190 --> 02:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
not for anything else but because
 
02:47:57.230 --> 02:47:57.240 align:start position:0%
someone doesn't like the
 
02:48:00.830 --> 02:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
decision to me is even worse than
 
02:48:04.750 --> 02:48:04.760 align:start position:0%
wanting to penalize an employee or a
 
02:48:08.389 --> 02:48:08.399 align:start position:0%
volunteer in a library because a mistake
 
02:48:13.830 --> 02:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:17.150 --> 02:48:17.160 align:start position:0%
highest insult that I think we could be
 
02:48:19.269 --> 02:48:19.279 align:start position:0%
part of and I do not want to part of
 
02:48:21.830 --> 02:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
that insult anyone else wish to be heard
 
02:48:25.389 --> 02:48:25.399 align:start position:0%
on this so I guess I I guess I would um
 
02:48:29.830 --> 02:48:29.840 align:start position:0%
really Echo um representative Smith's uh
 
02:48:34.230 --> 02:48:34.240 align:start position:0%
position you can agree or disagree with
 
02:48:36.110 --> 02:48:36.120 align:start position:0%
judge Roth's decision and I have to say
 
02:48:38.990 --> 02:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
candidly I have significant issues with
 
02:48:41.349 --> 02:48:41.359 align:start position:0%
the decision but the
 
02:48:45.230 --> 02:48:45.240 align:start position:0%
idea that um we are going to impeach a
 
02:48:48.230 --> 02:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
judge for his decision is I think I
 
02:48:50.429 --> 02:48:50.439 align:start position:0%
think it would be unprecedented I'm not
 
02:48:52.469 --> 02:48:52.479 align:start position:0%
aware of anywhere maybe there is you
 
02:48:57.230 --> 02:48:57.240 align:start position:0%
know somewhere in uh you know Alabama in
 
02:48:59.150 --> 02:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
the 1870s or something they did
 
02:49:00.950 --> 02:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
something like this but I can't imagine
 
02:49:05.309 --> 02:49:05.319 align:start position:0%
it it is um it's
 
02:49:08.150 --> 02:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
just candidly seems to me it's beyond
 
02:49:11.830 --> 02:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
the pale um I have to say I you know all
 
02:49:14.269 --> 02:49:14.279 align:start position:0%
cand I know judge rof he is a good
 
02:49:16.630 --> 02:49:16.640 align:start position:0%
person he's a smart person he's a good
 
02:49:19.790 --> 02:49:19.800 align:start position:0%
judge and whether he got this one right
 
02:49:24.550 --> 02:49:24.560 align:start position:0%
or not provides absolutely no basis for
 
02:49:27.269 --> 02:49:27.279 align:start position:0%
impeaching him um and so for those
 
02:49:29.910 --> 02:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
reasons I intend to support the ITF
 
02:49:32.750 --> 02:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
representative P pno thank you Mr chair
 
02:49:35.429 --> 02:49:35.439 align:start position:0%
I agree with what you're saying however
 
02:49:37.910 --> 02:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
I just want to clarify that um this
 
02:49:40.070 --> 02:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
resolution is instructing the House of
 
02:49:42.830 --> 02:49:42.840 align:start position:0%
Representatives to investigate whether
 
02:49:45.750 --> 02:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
grounds exist for impeachment not the
 
02:49:49.190 --> 02:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
actual impeachment no I I you know I I
 
02:49:51.110 --> 02:49:51.120 align:start position:0%
agree with that I do agree but I think
 
02:49:53.150 --> 02:49:53.160 align:start position:0%
it's clear from the L there's no
 
02:49:55.990 --> 02:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
suggestion of anything else that judge
 
02:49:59.309 --> 02:49:59.319 align:start position:0%
Rua did accept issue this decision so um
 
02:50:01.990 --> 02:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
it would be you know what will if if we
 
02:50:03.750 --> 02:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
were to actually have an investigation
 
02:50:06.710 --> 02:50:06.720 align:start position:0%
what would it be I mean about whether he
 
02:50:09.030 --> 02:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
issued the decision so I I I do agree
 
02:50:10.190 --> 02:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
with you completely representative
 
02:50:13.150 --> 02:50:13.160 align:start position:0%
pental but that's the way the the the
 
02:50:16.510 --> 02:50:16.520 align:start position:0%
resolution is worded but that cand I
 
02:50:17.990 --> 02:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
mean it just seems to me that's a smoke
 
02:50:21.670 --> 02:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
screen because the only the only um
 
02:50:23.990 --> 02:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
basis for for launching the
 
02:50:28.030 --> 02:50:28.040 align:start position:0%
investigation is his decision so um any
 
02:50:29.790 --> 02:50:29.800 align:start position:0%
anybody else wish to be
 
02:50:33.309 --> 02:50:33.319 align:start position:0%
heard all right so the motion uh before
 
02:50:38.190 --> 02:50:38.200 align:start position:0%

you wish to speak to your motion
 
02:53:20.750 --> 02:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
briefly uh
 
02:53:23.990 --> 02:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
so what this amendment does is it fixes
 
02:53:27.750 --> 02:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
currently in the foreign Pharmacy
 
02:53:31.110 --> 02:53:31.120 align:start position:0%
graduate statute it lists the world
 
02:53:32.830 --> 02:53:32.840 align:start position:0%
directory of schools by the pharmacy
 
02:53:34.630 --> 02:53:34.640 align:start position:0%
published in the world Health published
 
02:53:36.150 --> 02:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
by the World Health
 
02:53:39.070 --> 02:53:39.080 align:start position:0%
Organization in the bill um it had
 
02:53:41.790 --> 02:53:41.800 align:start position:0%
changed for it had given an alternative
 
02:53:45.229 --> 02:53:45.239 align:start position:0%
list for The Physician forign Medical
 
02:53:46.990 --> 02:53:47.000 align:start position:0%
School graduate licensing but an
 
02:53:48.790 --> 02:53:48.800 align:start position:0%
equivalent doesn't exist for the world
 
02:53:51.309 --> 02:53:51.319 align:start position:0%
directory of Pharmacy schools published
 
02:53:52.950 --> 02:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
by The Who so I think it's really
 
02:53:54.710 --> 02:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
important that we ensure that this bill
 
02:53:58.469 --> 02:53:58.479 align:start position:0%
won't interfere with the licensing of
 
02:54:01.389 --> 02:54:01.399 align:start position:0%
our pharmacists who are
 
02:54:04.349 --> 02:54:04.359 align:start position:0%
foreign um pharmacy school graduates and
 
02:54:10.229 --> 02:54:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:12.110 --> 02:54:12.120 align:start position:0%
that all
 
02:54:14.269 --> 02:54:14.279 align:start position:0%
right all right anyone else wish to be
 
02:54:17.790 --> 02:54:17.800 align:start position:0%
heard yes representative uh Smith um I'm
 
02:54:19.469 --> 02:54:19.479 align:start position:0%
a little surp surprised that you that
 
02:54:22.309 --> 02:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
this was called because um we just heard
 
02:54:23.950 --> 02:54:23.960 align:start position:0%
it this morning and we haven't had a
 
02:54:26.870 --> 02:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
chance to discuss it among ourselves but
 
02:54:28.790 --> 02:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
um I
 
02:54:32.229 --> 02:54:32.239 align:start position:0%
um whether I support the amendment or
 
02:54:34.630 --> 02:54:34.640 align:start position:0%
not I think it's irrelevant because I
 
02:54:39.349 --> 02:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
would strongly oppose the bill um and
 
02:54:40.710 --> 02:54:40.720 align:start position:0%
would have liked to have had the
 
02:54:43.229 --> 02:54:43.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity to discuss it among
 
02:54:46.030 --> 02:54:46.040 align:start position:0%
ourselves right anyone else wish yes
 
02:54:48.830 --> 02:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
representative H um well this amendment
 
02:54:50.870 --> 02:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
first it doesn't incorporate the changes
 
02:54:53.150 --> 02:54:53.160 align:start position:0%
that the prime sponsor recommended which
 
02:54:56.870 --> 02:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh I mean I'm not particularly not
 
02:54:58.229 --> 02:54:58.239 align:start position:0%
particularly don't particular strong
 
02:55:00.510 --> 02:55:00.520 align:start position:0%
opinion one way or another about whether
 
02:55:03.190 --> 02:55:03.200 align:start position:0%
that particular change was good it also
 
02:55:04.630 --> 02:55:04.640 align:start position:0%
um although this would eventually be
 
02:55:07.550 --> 02:55:07.560 align:start position:0%
caught by the clerk during the enrolled
 
02:55:10.429 --> 02:55:10.439 align:start position:0%
Bill process it has a there's a typo um
 
02:55:13.389 --> 02:55:13.399 align:start position:0%
there's it's I it's the possessive form
 
02:55:17.150 --> 02:55:17.160 align:start position:0%
of the uh pronoun it it's or it's um
 
02:55:19.190 --> 02:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
anyway it should say I it s and it says
 
02:55:22.950 --> 02:55:22.960 align:start position:0%
it apostrophe s so it apostrophe s means
 
02:55:24.830 --> 02:55:24.840 align:start position:0%
it is and so like what they meant was
 
02:55:27.229 --> 02:55:27.239 align:start position:0%
it's the possessive form of of it so
 
02:55:30.469 --> 02:55:30.479 align:start position:0%
that's um those are two things that are
 
02:55:32.670 --> 02:55:32.680 align:start position:0%
missing from from uh from from this
 
02:55:32.680 --> 02:55:33.870 align:start position:0%
missing from from uh from from this
amendment

02:55:33.870 --> 02:55:33.880 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:55:36.590 --> 02:55:36.600 align:start position:0%
so which any else I'm sorry
 
02:55:38.710 --> 02:55:38.720 align:start position:0%
representative CH yeah I just want to
 
02:55:42.070 --> 02:55:42.080 align:start position:0%
point out I mean a bill about uh groups
 
02:55:43.950 --> 02:55:43.960 align:start position:0%
that have no jurisdiction within the
 
02:55:45.950 --> 02:55:45.960 align:start position:0%
state clarifying that they have no
 
02:55:47.950 --> 02:55:47.960 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction within the state there's
 
02:55:50.870 --> 02:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
any number of of things that could fall
 
02:55:52.910 --> 02:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
into similar categories and I feel like
 
02:55:54.750 --> 02:55:54.760 align:start position:0%
opening the door to legislation like
 
02:55:57.710 --> 02:55:57.720 align:start position:0%
this is uh wildly
 
02:56:00.349 --> 02:56:00.359 align:start position:0%

Amendment so this amendment merely
 
02:58:40.429 --> 02:58:40.439 align:start position:0%
changes the part of regarding creating
 
02:58:45.469 --> 02:58:45.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:48.750 --> 02:58:48.760 align:start position:0%
policies that are from the World Health
 
02:58:57.190 --> 02:58:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:01.790 --> 02:59:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:04.070 --> 02:59:04.080 align:start position:0%

02:59:10.070 --> 02:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
06
 
02:59:13.150 --> 02:59:13.160 align:start position:0%
83h yes represent Manos thank you I'm
 
02:59:14.349 --> 02:59:14.359 align:start position:0%
I'm just not
 
02:59:17.550 --> 02:59:17.560 align:start position:0%
clear perhaps uh representative kab
 
02:59:20.349 --> 02:59:20.359 align:start position:0%
could um explain a little further what
 
02:59:22.190 --> 02:59:22.200 align:start position:0%
this amendment does I'm not I'm not
 
02:59:28.910 --> 02:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:32.790 --> 02:59:32.800 align:start position:0%
accomplishes thank you um so what this
 
02:59:34.870 --> 02:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
amendment does is if you look on line
 
02:59:37.389 --> 02:59:37.399 align:start position:0%
number 12 of the amendment in the
 
02:59:40.710 --> 02:59:40.720 align:start position:0%
original Bill what it said was create
 
02:59:43.590 --> 02:59:43.600 align:start position:0%
and enforce and now it's just says who
 
02:59:46.750 --> 02:59:46.760 align:start position:0%
enforces instead of just instead of
 
02:59:48.790 --> 02:59:48.800 align:start position:0%
including also create so it's just
 
02:59:55.950 --> 02:59:55.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:58.389 --> 02:59:58.399 align:start position:0%
enforces yes representative Oregon well
 
03:00:01.070 --> 03:00:01.080 align:start position:0%
it actually does a uh second thing so
 
03:00:03.750 --> 03:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
the first R bills in only said enforces
 
03:00:07.030 --> 03:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
policies but this also adds uh mandates
 
03:00:09.110 --> 03:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
orders requirements tives or directives
 
03:00:10.670 --> 03:00:10.680 align:start position:0%
of those organizations I guess
 
03:00:13.150 --> 03:00:13.160 align:start position:0%
presumably if they if they were to issue
 
03:00:15.269 --> 03:00:15.279 align:start position:0%
a mandate order requirement edct or
 
03:00:17.790 --> 03:00:17.800 align:start position:0%
directive which was not however a change
 
03:00:20.990 --> 03:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
of policy uh that would now be covered
 
03:00:22.670 --> 03:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
by the bill as amended which they would
 
03:00:24.790 --> 03:00:24.800 align:start position:0%
have been ex excluded from the original
 
03:00:26.670 --> 03:00:26.680 align:start position:0%
bill so that it does do a second thing
 
03:00:28.830 --> 03:00:28.840 align:start position:0%
so all right anyone else wish to be
 
03:00:53.670 --> 03:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:55.190 --> 03:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
12 all right
 
03:00:58.830 --> 03:00:58.840 align:start position:0%
12 um and those opposed please raise
 
03:00:58.840 --> 03:01:02.870 align:start position:0%
12 um and those opposed please raise
your

03:01:02.870 --> 03:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:07.870 --> 03:01:07.880 align:start position:0%
hand six 12 to six passes all
 
03:01:12.070 --> 03:01:12.080 align:start position:0%
right all right so I I as I've looked
 
03:01:14.670 --> 03:01:14.680 align:start position:0%
over the two amendments we've discussed
 
03:01:19.910 --> 03:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
that is 0683 and 096 66h they do not
 
03:01:22.190 --> 03:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
appear to me to in any way conflict so I
 
03:01:23.550 --> 03:01:23.560 align:start position:0%
think that there's not a problem with
 
03:01:25.349 --> 03:01:25.359 align:start position:0%
that and what I would do if if the bill
 
03:01:28.349 --> 03:01:28.359 align:start position:0%
passes I would ask uh um our assistant
 
03:01:31.469 --> 03:01:31.479 align:start position:0%
to ask the uh OS to prepare a
 
03:01:33.229 --> 03:01:33.239 align:start position:0%
Consolidated house uh committee
 
03:01:35.389 --> 03:01:35.399 align:start position:0%
amendment that will reflect that so I
 
03:01:37.670 --> 03:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
think we're now on to the main Bill uh
 
03:01:40.790 --> 03:01:40.800 align:start position:0%
House Bill four 584 as amended by both
 
03:01:43.190 --> 03:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
of those amendments um and
 
03:01:44.910 --> 03:01:44.920 align:start position:0%
representative kutab do you move or to
 
03:01:47.030 --> 03:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
pass as amended with the two of them I
 
03:01:48.950 --> 03:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
will or I'm sorry representative man yes
 
03:01:51.750 --> 03:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
I move off to pass as amended on House
 
03:01:59.910 --> 03:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:04.590 --> 03:02:04.600 align:start position:0%
um all right uh anyone wish to be heard
 
03:02:09.309 --> 03:02:09.319 align:start position:0%
any further on the yes representative uh
 
03:02:15.429 --> 03:02:15.439 align:start position:0%
bur so what we have here is
 
03:02:19.150 --> 03:02:19.160 align:start position:0%
legislation based on
 
03:02:21.229 --> 03:02:21.239 align:start position:0%
something that
 
03:02:25.670 --> 03:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
suggests that first suggests that these
 
03:02:25.680 --> 03:02:27.349 align:start position:0%
suggests that first suggests that these
particular

03:02:27.349 --> 03:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
particular
 
03:02:29.309 --> 03:02:29.319 align:start position:0%
organizations have
 
03:02:34.710 --> 03:02:34.720 align:start position:0%
ever issued an enforcable mandate on the
 
03:02:38.269 --> 03:02:38.279 align:start position:0%
people citizens of the Granite State to
 
03:02:41.269 --> 03:02:41.279 align:start position:0%
my knowledge that has never happened in
 
03:02:42.870 --> 03:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
the history of these
 
03:02:46.349 --> 03:02:46.359 align:start position:0%
organizations or the history of New
 
03:02:48.349 --> 03:02:48.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we
 
03:02:50.510 --> 03:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
have no knowledge
 
03:02:53.269 --> 03:02:53.279 align:start position:0%
whatsoever that any of these
 
03:02:57.150 --> 03:02:57.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:01.790 --> 03:03:01.800 align:start position:0%
will issue some kind of mandate on the
 
03:03:06.790 --> 03:03:06.800 align:start position:0%
good folks of our state nor would such a
 
03:03:10.110 --> 03:03:10.120 align:start position:0%
mandate if dreamed up by any of these
 
03:03:14.070 --> 03:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
organizations have any effect of force
 
03:03:19.309 --> 03:03:19.319 align:start position:0%
or law in our state so it would not be
 
03:03:23.590 --> 03:03:23.600 align:start position:0%
worth the paper it's written on if some
 
03:03:27.469 --> 03:03:27.479 align:start position:0%
bureaucrat somewhere in Zurich or uh
 
03:03:29.469 --> 03:03:29.479 align:start position:0%
upper east side of New York I think
 
03:03:33.110 --> 03:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
that's where the UN is um decided to
 
03:03:38.309 --> 03:03:38.319 align:start position:0%
write some sheet of paper so because
 
03:03:38.319 --> 03:03:40.630 align:start position:0%
write some sheet of paper so because
this

03:03:40.630 --> 03:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:03:45.550 --> 03:03:45.560 align:start position:0%
bill literally does not change any past
 
03:03:49.469 --> 03:03:49.479 align:start position:0%
practice will not change any any future
 
03:03:52.630 --> 03:03:52.640 align:start position:0%
practice um I see no reason that we
 
03:03:57.630 --> 03:03:57.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:00.870 --> 03:04:00.880 align:start position:0%

03:52:08.070 --> 03:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
all right so I'm going to uh reconvene
 
03:52:10.349 --> 03:52:10.359 align:start position:0%
the executive session uh of the
 
03:52:13.590 --> 03:52:13.600 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee um and I'm going to
 
03:52:17.149 --> 03:52:17.159 align:start position:0%
uh as the next bill take up to exec uh
 
03:52:18.630 --> 03:52:18.640 align:start position:0%
is HB
 
03:52:22.030 --> 03:52:22.040 align:start position:0%
580 FN and the chair recognizes
 
03:52:29.149 --> 03:52:29.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:35.030 --> 03:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
motion Mr chair on 580 I recommend
 
03:52:38.590 --> 03:52:38.600 align:start position:0%
retain is there a second for that all
 
03:52:41.990 --> 03:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
right hang on so it's
 
03:52:44.830 --> 03:52:44.840 align:start position:0%
moved by representative Smith seconded
 
03:52:59.710 --> 03:52:59.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:01.790 --> 03:53:01.800 align:start position:0%
Romo all right uh representative Smith
 
03:53:04.670 --> 03:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
do you wish to speak to your
 
03:53:06.790 --> 03:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
motion I think the issues that are
 
03:53:09.469 --> 03:53:09.479 align:start position:0%
raised in this bill are very
 
03:53:12.229 --> 03:53:12.239 align:start position:0%
serious I think that
 
03:53:17.189 --> 03:53:17.199 align:start position:0%
the structure of the Bill does
 
03:53:17.199 --> 03:53:20.030 align:start position:0%
the structure of the Bill does
not

03:53:20.030 --> 03:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:53:22.630 --> 03:53:22.640 align:start position:0%
completely address those
 
03:53:25.670 --> 03:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
issues um and I believe that if the
 
03:53:27.429 --> 03:53:27.439 align:start position:0%
committee takes
 
03:53:27.439 --> 03:53:28.950 align:start position:0%
committee takes
seriously

03:53:28.950 --> 03:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
seriously
 
03:53:32.790 --> 03:53:32.800 align:start position:0%
um it's its role and we'll spend some
 
03:53:35.030 --> 03:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
time trying
 
03:53:39.269 --> 03:53:39.279 align:start position:0%
to improve the bill we could end up with
 
03:53:43.189 --> 03:53:43.199 align:start position:0%
a product that meets
 
03:53:45.710 --> 03:53:45.720 align:start position:0%
majority a agreement all right anyone
 
03:53:48.149 --> 03:53:48.159 align:start position:0%
else wish to be heard on uh the motion
 
03:53:49.910 --> 03:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
to retain on House Bill
 
03:53:53.590 --> 03:53:53.600 align:start position:0%
580 right so I could say I basically I'm
 
03:53:55.429 --> 03:53:55.439 align:start position:0%
I'm in I'm in agreement with
 
03:53:58.550 --> 03:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
representative Smith I you know I have I
 
03:54:00.309 --> 03:54:00.319 align:start position:0%
had I have at least one idea as I
 
03:54:01.870 --> 03:54:01.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier about a possible
 
03:54:04.950 --> 03:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
resolution that may or may not s be you
 
03:54:07.790 --> 03:54:07.800 align:start position:0%
know something that would draw majority
 
03:54:09.510 --> 03:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
support from everybody on the committee
 
03:54:12.389 --> 03:54:12.399 align:start position:0%
but um it's something I mean that's that
 
03:54:13.870 --> 03:54:13.880 align:start position:0%
demonstrates to me that it's least it's
 
03:54:16.870 --> 03:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
at least worth uh uh thinking about so
 
03:54:19.389 --> 03:54:19.399 align:start position:0%
I'm I would support the uh motion to
 
03:54:22.149 --> 03:54:22.159 align:start position:0%

chairman Lynn this
 
03:56:18.670 --> 03:56:18.680 align:start position:0%
Amendment while while we heard a lot
 
03:56:22.429 --> 03:56:22.439 align:start position:0%
of testimony about how kind of archaic
 
03:56:25.790 --> 03:56:25.800 align:start position:0%
this this statute is um and that we're
 
03:56:27.469 --> 03:56:27.479 align:start position:0%
not jailing
 
03:56:31.309 --> 03:56:31.319 align:start position:0%
people I I think most of us can agree we
 
03:56:33.189 --> 03:56:33.199 align:start position:0%
should remove that part out if we're not
 
03:56:34.710 --> 03:56:34.720 align:start position:0%
we're not doing it we wouldn't want it
 
03:56:36.670 --> 03:56:36.680 align:start position:0%
to actually happen and so that whole
 
03:56:38.389 --> 03:56:38.399 align:start position:0%
chunk of the bill has all been removed
 
03:56:40.750 --> 03:56:40.760 align:start position:0%
we're no longer jailing people however
 
03:56:43.550 --> 03:56:43.560 align:start position:0%
this has been a useful tool particularly
 
03:56:46.590 --> 03:56:46.600 align:start position:0%
in smaller towns when when a relative is
 
03:56:49.830 --> 03:56:49.840 align:start position:0%
capable of providing this means so
 
03:56:53.070 --> 03:56:53.080 align:start position:0%
that the neighbors aren't aren't having
 
03:56:54.710 --> 03:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
to pick up the tab for something that
 
03:56:56.910 --> 03:56:56.920 align:start position:0%
the family could pay for but this is
 
03:57:00.710 --> 03:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
also making sure that Aid to the person
 
03:57:02.590 --> 03:57:02.600 align:start position:0%
who's otherwise eligible for assistance
 
03:57:05.550 --> 03:57:05.560 align:start position:0%
under this chapter shall not be withheld
 
03:57:07.710 --> 03:57:07.720 align:start position:0%
due to the failure of a legally liable
 
03:57:09.670 --> 03:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
relative to either respond or provide
 
03:57:10.950 --> 03:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
the aid and I think that is really
 
03:57:12.149 --> 03:57:12.159 align:start position:0%
important we don't want to have people
 
03:57:13.630 --> 03:57:13.640 align:start position:0%
that need the aid but can't get in touch
 
03:57:15.990 --> 03:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
with a a relative not being able to get
 
03:57:18.550 --> 03:57:18.560 align:start position:0%
the aid however at the same time we want
 
03:57:21.269 --> 03:57:21.279 align:start position:0%
to make sure if somebody is is able to
 
03:57:22.910 --> 03:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
provide it
 
03:57:26.710 --> 03:57:26.720 align:start position:0%
that they are providing it so for that
 
03:57:29.189 --> 03:57:29.199 align:start position:0%
reason I think it's important to amend
 
03:57:32.110 --> 03:57:32.120 align:start position:0%
the bill with this amendment thank you
 
03:57:34.030 --> 03:57:34.040 align:start position:0%
all right anyone else wish to be heard
 
03:57:36.389 --> 03:57:36.399 align:start position:0%
on uh we're talking actually now about
 
03:57:39.429 --> 03:57:39.439 align:start position:0%
the amendment 2025
 
03:57:42.389 --> 03:57:42.399 align:start position:0%
0927 to House Bill 132 anyone else wish
 
03:57:44.630 --> 03:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
to be heard yes oh yes representative
 
03:57:48.630 --> 03:57:48.640 align:start position:0%
bur uh so I'd like to ask uh if I may a
 
03:57:50.750 --> 03:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
clarification just to make sure I
 
03:57:51.670 --> 03:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
understand the
 
03:57:56.790 --> 03:57:56.800 align:start position:0%
amendment um the idea of this bill as
 
03:58:03.189 --> 03:58:03.199 align:start position:0%
amended uh would be that the town or
 
03:58:08.269 --> 03:58:08.279 align:start position:0%
city would still provide the aid but
 
03:58:11.510 --> 03:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
that they could then sue any of the
 
03:58:15.590 --> 03:58:15.600 align:start position:0%
named relatives for the money uh go
 
03:58:18.910 --> 03:58:18.920 align:start position:0%
through their finances subpoena their
 
03:58:22.349 --> 03:58:22.359 align:start position:0%
financial records and tax forms and do
 
03:58:25.309 --> 03:58:25.319 align:start position:0%
all the rest to see if they could have
 
03:58:27.670 --> 03:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
sufficient means to pay is that the idea
 
03:58:29.910 --> 03:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
03:58:32.990 --> 03:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment thank you for the question so
 
03:58:35.309 --> 03:58:35.319 align:start position:0%
currently they are able to do all of
 
03:58:36.950 --> 03:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
that but they're not really doing all of
 
03:58:39.309 --> 03:58:39.319 align:start position:0%
that and if they find that you are able
 
03:58:41.030 --> 03:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
and you're just not doing it they can
 
03:58:43.630 --> 03:58:43.640 align:start position:0%
jail you right now for at least 60 days
 
03:58:45.349 --> 03:58:45.359 align:start position:0%
but up to 90 days and so this is
 
03:58:47.950 --> 03:58:47.960 align:start position:0%
removing that jail piece out so I think
 
03:58:50.030 --> 03:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
it is important to remove that piece out
 
03:58:53.349 --> 03:58:53.359 align:start position:0%
um I do think they they the welfare
 
03:58:54.510 --> 03:58:54.520 align:start position:0%
officer made it pretty clear that
 
03:58:55.990 --> 03:58:56.000 align:start position:0%
they're not going through the process of
 
03:58:58.030 --> 03:58:58.040 align:start position:0%
doing all of this leg work but if
 
03:59:00.590 --> 03:59:00.600 align:start position:0%
somebody does come in and says yeah I'm
 
03:59:02.070 --> 03:59:02.080 align:start position:0%
able to help that family member out
 
03:59:03.469 --> 03:59:03.479 align:start position:0%
they're having that family member help
 
03:59:04.750 --> 03:59:04.760 align:start position:0%
out but they're not they're not
 
03:59:07.309 --> 03:59:07.319 align:start position:0%
subpoenaing people so I just I it's not
 
03:59:09.269 --> 03:59:09.279 align:start position:0%
happening now I don't see
 
03:59:11.590 --> 03:59:11.600 align:start position:0%
it I don't necessarily see it happening
 
03:59:13.670 --> 03:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
in the future um but I do think that
 
03:59:17.189 --> 03:59:17.199 align:start position:0%
it's important that currently they're
 
03:59:19.030 --> 03:59:19.040 align:start position:0%
able to work together to try and get the
 
03:59:21.070 --> 03:59:21.080 align:start position:0%
relatives to help out if they're able to
 
03:59:22.750 --> 03:59:22.760 align:start position:0%
if we repealed this all together then
 
03:59:25.189 --> 03:59:25.199 align:start position:0%
there would be nothing at all you know
 
03:59:26.550 --> 03:59:26.560 align:start position:0%
there would be no reason that a relative
 
03:59:29.510 --> 03:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
would even try it or or necessarily want
 
03:59:31.030 --> 03:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
to help if they don't have to because
 
03:59:33.269 --> 03:59:33.279 align:start position:0%
why pay money that you don't have to pay
 
03:59:36.389 --> 03:59:36.399 align:start position:0%
right no anyone else wish I mean you'd
 
03:59:38.630 --> 03:59:38.640 align:start position:0%
hope somebody doesn't think that way but
 
03:59:41.590 --> 03:59:41.600 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to be heard uh on this
 
03:59:43.670 --> 03:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
yes representative Bon I know you've
 
03:59:46.950 --> 03:59:46.960 align:start position:0%
probably already dealt with this but I I
 
03:59:48.670 --> 03:59:48.680 align:start position:0%
was uncomfortable with the word poor
 
03:59:50.710 --> 03:59:50.720 align:start position:0%
just for that reason but you've had more
 
03:59:53.110 --> 03:59:53.120 align:start position:0%
experience than I have
 
03:59:55.630 --> 03:59:55.640 align:start position:0%
so it just says that on the bill and
 
03:59:57.189 --> 03:59:57.199 align:start position:0%
I've noticed it last time and it kind of
 
03:59:59.189 --> 03:59:59.199 align:start position:0%
bothered me a little bit but the I don't
 
04:00:02.110 --> 04:00:02.120 align:start position:0%
know about the word
 
04:00:04.670 --> 04:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
poor but you know if everybody's happy
 
04:00:06.149 --> 04:00:06.159 align:start position:0%
with it
 
04:00:09.469 --> 04:00:09.479 align:start position:0%
then may I so that's that's existing in
 
04:00:11.590 --> 04:00:11.600 align:start position:0%
the current statute I didn't change that
 
04:00:15.389 --> 04:00:15.399 align:start position:0%
piece in there um
 
04:00:19.429 --> 04:00:19.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:23.910 --> 04:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
to um to say you know in poverty you
 
04:00:27.070 --> 04:00:27.080 align:start position:0%
know poverty I think but I I you know
 
04:00:29.269 --> 04:00:29.279 align:start position:0%
it's already in there this
 
04:00:32.590 --> 04:00:32.600 align:start position:0%
statute was I you know pretty old it
 
04:00:34.990 --> 04:00:35.000 align:start position:0%
came up in the 1900s when it was first
 
04:00:36.910 --> 04:00:36.920 align:start position:0%
kind of put in so I think you know that
 
04:00:38.429 --> 04:00:38.439 align:start position:0%
was just a term that was used at that
 
04:00:41.309 --> 04:00:41.319 align:start position:0%
time and I didn't go through uh changing
 
04:00:44.269 --> 04:00:44.279 align:start position:0%
that language right other question
 
04:00:46.990 --> 04:00:47.000 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to be heard so I I
 
04:00:48.710 --> 04:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
guess um you know what I what I would
 
04:00:50.590 --> 04:00:50.600 align:start position:0%
say is I think first of all I think that
 
04:00:53.349 --> 04:00:53.359 align:start position:0%
representative kab's amendment makes
 
04:00:57.389 --> 04:00:57.399 align:start position:0%
makes this law much better um than the
 
04:01:01.870 --> 04:01:01.880 align:start position:0%
original version and my my sense and I
 
04:01:03.229 --> 04:01:03.239 align:start position:0%
don't know whether representative Burch
 
04:01:05.229 --> 04:01:05.239 align:start position:0%
would agree with me on this or not I
 
04:01:07.590 --> 04:01:07.600 align:start position:0%
think and I I think this maybe goes to
 
04:01:08.750 --> 04:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
what a little bit about your the
 
04:01:11.590 --> 04:01:11.600 align:start position:0%
question you're asking I think
 
04:01:14.110 --> 04:01:14.120 align:start position:0%
that there could be in some
 
04:01:16.309 --> 04:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
circumstances a real question as to the
 
04:01:20.910 --> 04:01:20.920 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of this if the if for
 
04:01:24.149 --> 04:01:24.159 align:start position:0%
example the state uh or town were trying
 
04:01:28.309 --> 04:01:28.319 align:start position:0%
to hold someone responsible
 
04:01:32.630 --> 04:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
for uh providing uh support or something
 
04:01:36.189 --> 04:01:36.199 align:start position:0%
for you know an adult child who didn't
 
04:01:39.309 --> 04:01:39.319 align:start position:0%
live in the home and it was was uh was
 
04:01:41.030 --> 04:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
on their own and maybe seriously
 
04:01:43.590 --> 04:01:43.600 align:start position:0%
estrange from the parents or whatever I
 
04:01:45.229 --> 04:01:45.239 align:start position:0%
don't know about that I whether that
 
04:01:46.910 --> 04:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
would be whether there be some
 
04:01:50.070 --> 04:01:50.080 align:start position:0%
constitutional issue with that or not
 
04:01:54.070 --> 04:01:54.080 align:start position:0%
but I think the other side of that
 
04:01:57.630 --> 04:01:57.640 align:start position:0%
argument is that if that if such a
 
04:01:59.910 --> 04:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
person is not held liable then the
 
04:02:03.950 --> 04:02:03.960 align:start position:0%
burden falls on the on the entire town
 
04:02:06.990 --> 04:02:07.000 align:start position:0%
and that's a legitimate interest too I
 
04:02:09.870 --> 04:02:09.880 align:start position:0%
guess what I guess what I would say is
 
04:02:12.070 --> 04:02:12.080 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that this this statute
 
04:02:13.990 --> 04:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
has been on the books for a long time it
 
04:02:15.830 --> 04:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't appear from the evidence we
 
04:02:18.630 --> 04:02:18.640 align:start position:0%
heard that it's being abused towns are
 
04:02:21.349 --> 04:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
handling it you know are exercising
 
04:02:23.269 --> 04:02:23.279 align:start position:0%
their discretion appropriately it seems
 
04:02:26.790 --> 04:02:26.800 align:start position:0%
to me this by taking out the language of
 
04:02:29.469 --> 04:02:29.479 align:start position:0%
jail that seems it to me it softens it
 
04:02:33.070 --> 04:02:33.080 align:start position:0%
even further and so what I would say
 
04:02:36.870 --> 04:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
is excuse me I would support this and my
 
04:02:39.070 --> 04:02:39.080 align:start position:0%
sense would be if there are some
 
04:02:41.189 --> 04:02:41.199 align:start position:0%
circumstances in which you know it would
 
04:02:43.469 --> 04:02:43.479 align:start position:0%
be really unfair to the point of being
 
04:02:45.870 --> 04:02:45.880 align:start position:0%
uncon constitutional for for a town to
 
04:02:48.870 --> 04:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
try to collect from somebody then that
 
04:02:50.389 --> 04:02:50.399 align:start position:0%
is something that's a time for that to
 
04:02:52.229 --> 04:02:52.239 align:start position:0%
be challenged and the court would would
 
04:02:55.550 --> 04:02:55.560 align:start position:0%
rule that way but but I don't think that
 
04:02:58.149 --> 04:02:58.159 align:start position:0%
that's a reason not to have this Statute
 
04:03:00.189 --> 04:03:00.199 align:start position:0%
in in this amended form on the books
 
04:03:01.830 --> 04:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
because I think it does serve some
 
04:03:03.990 --> 04:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
useful purpose so I intend to support
 
04:03:06.910 --> 04:03:06.920 align:start position:0%
the amendment and and vote for it any
 
04:03:06.920 --> 04:03:08.950 align:start position:0%
the amendment and and vote for it any
representative

04:03:08.950 --> 04:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:03:11.870 --> 04:03:11.880 align:start position:0%
trip having been a town counselor and
 
04:03:17.229 --> 04:03:17.239 align:start position:0%
having had to deal with this you know I
 
04:03:19.990 --> 04:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh I am probably going to vote no
 
04:03:23.910 --> 04:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
because uh you know it appears that this
 
04:03:25.870 --> 04:03:25.880 align:start position:0%
would make the towns and cities liable
 
04:03:27.510 --> 04:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
for all the homeless people that are in
 
04:03:32.309 --> 04:03:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:34.990 --> 04:03:35.000 align:start position:0%
uh that's already in a statute that's
 
04:03:37.269 --> 04:03:37.279 align:start position:0%
already in statute that part isn't that
 
04:03:38.830 --> 04:03:38.840 align:start position:0%
part isn't changing the part that's
 
04:03:40.550 --> 04:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
changing about it is just the part
 
04:03:44.229 --> 04:03:44.239 align:start position:0%
that's saying that um
 
04:03:45.750 --> 04:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
they already have to provide it but it's
 
04:03:48.910 --> 04:03:48.920 align:start position:0%
saying that if you if the if they can't
 
04:03:53.149 --> 04:03:53.159 align:start position:0%
get a hold of the the relative or if the
 
04:03:55.030 --> 04:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
relative refuses to provide it that they
 
04:03:56.910 --> 04:03:56.920 align:start position:0%
do still have to that the town does
 
04:03:58.429 --> 04:03:58.439 align:start position:0%
still have to provide it right now if
 
04:04:00.510 --> 04:04:00.520 align:start position:0%
you can't get a hold of the relative
 
04:04:02.990 --> 04:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
technically the town could just refuse
 
04:04:06.149 --> 04:04:06.159 align:start position:0%
to provide the aid and that has
 
04:04:08.750 --> 04:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
become problematic in some towns because
 
04:04:10.389 --> 04:04:10.399 align:start position:0%
some relatives just don't respond
 
04:04:12.590 --> 04:04:12.600 align:start position:0%
although the majority of the towns are
 
04:04:14.870 --> 04:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
just giving the a anyhow but that that
 
04:04:16.510 --> 04:04:16.520 align:start position:0%
liability already exists in the current
 
04:04:18.870 --> 04:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
statute with pretty pretty similar
 
04:04:22.149 --> 04:04:22.159 align:start position:0%
language to this well I agree with you
 
04:04:24.950 --> 04:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
on that the the issue that I have is
 
04:04:28.469 --> 04:04:28.479 align:start position:0%
that uh this simply
 
04:04:31.830 --> 04:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
clarifies that uh the towns are are
 
04:04:34.189 --> 04:04:34.199 align:start position:0%
responsible for the homeless people that
 
04:04:37.309 --> 04:04:37.319 align:start position:0%
reside in it and it'll probably be
 
04:04:40.149 --> 04:04:40.159 align:start position:0%
a people be taking
 
04:04:44.149 --> 04:04:44.159 align:start position:0%
much more advantage of this thank you
 
04:04:46.229 --> 04:04:46.239 align:start position:0%
right any any other anyone else want to
 
04:04:48.710 --> 04:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
be heard all right so we're we're we're

favor of amendment 2025 927 0927 H2
 
04:05:20.670 --> 04:05:20.680 align:start position:0%

17 all right and and representative trip
 
04:05:29.790 --> 04:05:29.800 align:start position:0%

04:05:41.990 --> 04:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
correct yes and is that seconded
 
04:05:43.269 --> 04:05:43.279 align:start position:0%

can I bring up one
 
04:05:54.269 --> 04:05:54.279 align:start position:0%
thing yes representative kutab and then

representative bur so I just um to get
 
04:05:59.309 --> 04:05:59.319 align:start position:0%
back to what rep rep trip was mentioning
 
04:06:01.309 --> 04:06:01.319 align:start position:0%
what it currently says in the statute is
 
04:06:03.510 --> 04:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
if a poor person has no relation of
 
04:06:05.590 --> 04:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
sufficient ability the town or city in
 
04:06:08.110 --> 04:06:08.120 align:start position:0%
which he resides shall be reliable for
 
04:06:10.469 --> 04:06:10.479 align:start position:0%
his support so it's already in current
 
04:06:12.550 --> 04:06:12.560 align:start position:0%
statute that they are that the town is
 
04:06:14.670 --> 04:06:14.680 align:start position:0%
liable representative
 
04:06:17.910 --> 04:06:17.920 align:start position:0%

um to follow up what the representative
 
04:06:40.149 --> 04:06:40.159 align:start position:0%
just said it seems to me the obligation
 
04:06:43.630 --> 04:06:43.640 align:start position:0%
on the town first would have to be to
 
04:06:48.710 --> 04:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
find out if any relative could pay and
 
04:06:52.750 --> 04:06:52.760 align:start position:0%
then pay I if there is no such relative
 
04:06:56.070 --> 04:06:56.080 align:start position:0%
so as I understand this bill now if
 
04:07:00.110 --> 04:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
there's a any poor person uh within the
 
04:07:03.110 --> 04:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
town the state the town would then have
 
04:07:04.590 --> 04:07:04.600 align:start position:0%
to start an
 
04:07:07.910 --> 04:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
investigation before paying any support
 
04:07:08.990 --> 04:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
to that
 
04:07:11.670 --> 04:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
person would have to go then investigate
 
04:07:13.750 --> 04:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
the father mother stepfather father
 
04:07:16.309 --> 04:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
stepmother son daughter husband or wife
 
04:07:21.030 --> 04:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
to determine and only if they can't then
 
04:07:24.469 --> 04:07:24.479 align:start position:0%
the if then there's no relation of
 
04:07:28.189 --> 04:07:28.199 align:start position:0%
sufficient ability then the town or city
 
04:07:31.469 --> 04:07:31.479 align:start position:0%
and this is lines 21 and 22 shall be
 
04:07:34.429 --> 04:07:34.439 align:start position:0%
liable for their support so the order
 
04:07:36.870 --> 04:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
that it's done seems to be set out in
 
04:07:39.429 --> 04:07:39.439 align:start position:0%
the statute that first you find out if
 
04:07:42.389 --> 04:07:42.399 align:start position:0%
somebody else can do it and only then
 
04:07:45.389 --> 04:07:45.399 align:start position:0%
will the state have or the town have an
 
04:07:48.349 --> 04:07:48.359 align:start position:0%
obligation to step forward I don't like
 
04:07:51.510 --> 04:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
that idea if I'm correct in it and the
 
04:07:54.469 --> 04:07:54.479 align:start position:0%
second part is again I live in a small
 
04:07:58.189 --> 04:07:58.199 align:start position:0%
town pretty much everybody knows
 
04:08:01.389 --> 04:08:01.399 align:start position:0%
everybody and what we have here is a
 
04:08:05.630 --> 04:08:05.640 align:start position:0%
situation of unbridled
 
04:08:11.149 --> 04:08:11.159 align:start position:0%
discretion on the town or the uh the the
 
04:08:12.950 --> 04:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
the overseer the poor or whatever it's
 
04:08:15.229 --> 04:08:15.239 align:start position:0%
called in any particular town and I
 
04:08:19.269 --> 04:08:19.279 align:start position:0%
think our town still calls it that um
 
04:08:23.149 --> 04:08:23.159 align:start position:0%
that that overseer the poor uh has no
 
04:08:26.429 --> 04:08:26.439 align:start position:0%
boundaries on discretion so he or she is
 
04:08:29.070 --> 04:08:29.080 align:start position:0%
sitting in their office and somebody
 
04:08:32.269 --> 04:08:32.279 align:start position:0%
comes in and the overseer of the poor
 
04:08:35.229 --> 04:08:35.239 align:start position:0%
says oh I know that family you know I'm
 
04:08:37.950 --> 04:08:37.960 align:start position:0%
not going to bother collecting or I know
 
04:08:40.229 --> 04:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
that family I'm going to go investigate
 
04:08:43.269 --> 04:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
them more thoroughly and check into
 
04:08:44.670 --> 04:08:44.680 align:start position:0%
their their finances of all the
 
04:08:48.389 --> 04:08:48.399 align:start position:0%
relatives so it's unbridled discretion
 
04:08:51.309 --> 04:08:51.319 align:start position:0%
on behalf of this town
 
04:08:55.149 --> 04:08:55.159 align:start position:0%
official uh as to who might be subject
 
04:08:58.149 --> 04:08:58.159 align:start position:0%
to this Recruitment and who not I don't
 
04:08:58.159 --> 04:08:59.189 align:start position:0%
to this Recruitment and who not I don't
think

04:08:59.189 --> 04:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
think
 
04:09:01.030 --> 04:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
that's there's
 
04:09:07.469 --> 04:09:07.479 align:start position:0%
no no process here to assure that it's
 
04:09:11.189 --> 04:09:11.199 align:start position:0%
being done fairly and uh equitably
 
04:09:13.510 --> 04:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
especially in the small towns in
 
04:09:16.189 --> 04:09:16.199 align:start position:0%
Manchester or nashille or conquer that
 
04:09:18.269 --> 04:09:18.279 align:start position:0%
may not be a problem where people are
 
04:09:21.269 --> 04:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
more Anonymous but in small towns and I
 
04:09:23.510 --> 04:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
represent three of them it's a it's a
 
04:09:27.670 --> 04:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
different issue thank you representative
 
04:09:30.149 --> 04:09:30.159 align:start position:0%
couta thank you and thank you for their
 
04:09:33.109 --> 04:09:33.119 align:start position:0%
question so um right now what's
 
04:09:35.189 --> 04:09:35.199 align:start position:0%
currently on the books is that they have
 
04:09:36.670 --> 04:09:36.680 align:start position:0%
to do what you you mentioned with
 
04:09:38.550 --> 04:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
finding out if they're able and it
 
04:09:40.750 --> 04:09:40.760 align:start position:0%
should they find out if they're able
 
04:09:43.630 --> 04:09:43.640 align:start position:0%
then if they refuse to do it the be
 
04:09:45.070 --> 04:09:45.080 align:start position:0%
ordered by the county commissioner
 
04:09:47.950 --> 04:09:47.960 align:start position:0%
selectman or overseer public welfare and
 
04:09:49.030 --> 04:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
if they don't do it then they'll be
 
04:09:51.149 --> 04:09:51.159 align:start position:0%
summons to appear before court and if
 
04:09:54.070 --> 04:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
after a hearing it's found that the
 
04:09:57.710 --> 04:09:57.720 align:start position:0%
alleged person is in need of assistance
 
04:10:00.149 --> 04:10:00.159 align:start position:0%
and that the relative is able to render
 
04:10:02.510 --> 04:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
it then the court will enter a decree
 
04:10:05.389 --> 04:10:05.399 align:start position:0%
accordingly to demand that the person
 
04:10:06.790 --> 04:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
provide this and if they don't then
 
04:10:08.950 --> 04:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
they'll be jailed so I think what's
 
04:10:13.630 --> 04:10:13.640 align:start position:0%
currently on the books is a lot more
 
04:10:16.510 --> 04:10:16.520 align:start position:0%
um but this so this what this is saying
 
04:10:18.510 --> 04:10:18.520 align:start position:0%
is that if the if the person doesn't
 
04:10:20.590 --> 04:10:20.600 align:start position:0%
answer or refuses to say if they can
 
04:10:22.469 --> 04:10:22.479 align:start position:0%
provide it or not the the town is still
 
04:10:24.429 --> 04:10:24.439 align:start position:0%
going to provide it if we don't have
 
04:10:26.309 --> 04:10:26.319 align:start position:0%
this at all then the town is not you
 
04:10:26.319 --> 04:10:28.349 align:start position:0%
this at all then the town is not you
know

04:10:28.349 --> 04:10:28.359 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:10:30.710 --> 04:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
not perhaps not going to provide any Aid
 
04:10:30.720 --> 04:10:32.469 align:start position:0%
not perhaps not going to provide any Aid
to

04:10:32.469 --> 04:10:32.479 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:10:35.309 --> 04:10:35.319 align:start position:0%
anybody all right anyone else um wish to
 
04:10:35.319 --> 04:10:36.109 align:start position:0%
anybody all right anyone else um wish to
be

04:10:36.109 --> 04:10:36.119 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:10:39.309 --> 04:10:39.319 align:start position:0%
heard yes representative ber if you
 
04:10:42.429 --> 04:10:42.439 align:start position:0%
don't mind I'd like to ask a sort of a
 
04:10:45.590 --> 04:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
general question after we pass bills
 
04:10:48.429 --> 04:10:48.439 align:start position:0%
like that do we ever get data or do we
 
04:10:50.269 --> 04:10:50.279 align:start position:0%
only get data if we review the bill
 
04:10:52.910 --> 04:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
again or you know from the outside folks
 
04:10:54.550 --> 04:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
like how's this going you know that kind
 
04:10:54.560 --> 04:10:56.469 align:start position:0%
like how's this going you know that kind
of

04:10:56.469 --> 04:10:56.479 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:10:59.309 --> 04:10:59.319 align:start position:0%
I well it sort of depends and I guess
 
04:11:01.229 --> 04:11:01.239 align:start position:0%
you know we did get I think we got some
 
04:11:03.750 --> 04:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
information at the hearing um anyone
 
04:11:05.550 --> 04:11:05.560 align:start position:0%
else wish to representative trip so I
 
04:11:08.630 --> 04:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
guess that's a no I have a question of
 
04:11:11.630 --> 04:11:11.640 align:start position:0%
Representative katab we know it's a uh
 
04:11:13.469 --> 04:11:13.479 align:start position:0%
was there a reason that you removed the
 
04:11:14.830 --> 04:11:14.840 align:start position:0%
County Commissioners from the people
 
04:11:21.510 --> 04:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:24.830 --> 04:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
responsible yes so I did talk to the uh
 
04:11:26.429 --> 04:11:26.439 align:start position:0%
several of the County Commissioners and
 
04:11:28.389 --> 04:11:28.399 align:start position:0%
none of them had ever done this before
 
04:11:30.710 --> 04:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
it was all going through
 
04:11:33.710 --> 04:11:33.720 align:start position:0%
the welfare administrator they were they
 
04:11:35.149 --> 04:11:35.159 align:start position:0%
were never doing anything like this the
 
04:11:38.630 --> 04:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
ones that I that I spoke with thank you
 
04:11:41.750 --> 04:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
right representative Horgan another
 
04:11:44.429 --> 04:11:44.439 align:start position:0%
related question um
 
04:11:47.590 --> 04:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
what about the what if the this is
 
04:11:49.189 --> 04:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
probably a fairly rare thing but what
 
04:11:51.870 --> 04:11:51.880 align:start position:0%
about the case where the uh person lives
 
04:11:53.309 --> 04:11:53.319 align:start position:0%
in a
 
04:11:55.349 --> 04:11:55.359 align:start position:0%
unincorporated unincorporated place in
 
04:11:57.030 --> 04:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
which case then the County Commissioners
 
04:11:59.189 --> 04:11:59.199 align:start position:0%
basically serve as the uh select board
 
04:12:01.229 --> 04:12:01.239 align:start position:0%
for that portion of the county that's
 
04:12:04.469 --> 04:12:04.479 align:start position:0%
not part of an incorporated town so of
 
04:12:04.479 --> 04:12:05.349 align:start position:0%
not part of an incorporated town so of
which

04:12:05.349 --> 04:12:05.359 align:start position:0%
which
 
04:12:08.349 --> 04:12:08.359 align:start position:0%
there's one town in Carol County and
 
04:12:10.670 --> 04:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
several which has some population then
 
04:12:12.710 --> 04:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
there's one Township in Carol County and
 
04:12:15.830 --> 04:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
then there's in Coos County one that's
 
04:12:19.269 --> 04:12:19.279 align:start position:0%
uninhabited in Grafton too
 
04:12:23.030 --> 04:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
but I I believe overall we have one
 
04:12:25.030 --> 04:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
welfare administrator for the state who
 
04:12:28.309 --> 04:12:28.319 align:start position:0%
came here to testify before us and so he
 
04:12:30.309 --> 04:12:30.319 align:start position:0%
assists the cities and towns with this
 
04:12:32.950 --> 04:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
type of a thing so I think they would
 
04:12:34.670 --> 04:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
even if they're an unincorporated place
 
04:12:36.790 --> 04:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
they would still be able to use that
 
04:12:39.309 --> 04:12:39.319 align:start position:0%
paid um administrator from the state
 
04:12:42.630 --> 04:12:42.640 align:start position:0%
okay sure yep sounds all right any any
 
04:12:44.990 --> 04:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
further uh comment so I I the only
 
04:12:47.229 --> 04:12:47.239 align:start position:0%
comment I would make in response to
 
04:12:50.870 --> 04:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
representative Burch um
 
04:12:54.229 --> 04:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
is you know I I mean you you know your
 
04:12:55.830 --> 04:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
your scenario about like they're going
 
04:12:55.840 --> 04:12:56.630 align:start position:0%
your scenario about like they're going
to

04:12:56.630 --> 04:12:56.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:12:58.590 --> 04:12:58.600 align:start position:0%
investigate somebody that might be
 
04:13:00.870 --> 04:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
potentially liable
 
04:13:03.550 --> 04:13:03.560 align:start position:0%
and and you know do Discovery and all
 
04:13:07.469 --> 04:13:07.479 align:start position:0%
that I mean I it seems to me that there
 
04:13:09.590 --> 04:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
was no evidence to suggest that that
 
04:13:13.710 --> 04:13:13.720 align:start position:0%
kind of thing had happened um with with
 
04:13:16.309 --> 04:13:16.319 align:start position:0%
the existing law which is more much
 
04:13:18.149 --> 04:13:18.159 align:start position:0%
considerably more honorous carrying the
 
04:13:20.830 --> 04:13:20.840 align:start position:0%
potential of jail uh than the proposed
 
04:13:20.840 --> 04:13:22.229 align:start position:0%
potential of jail uh than the proposed
amendment

04:13:22.229 --> 04:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:13:24.750 --> 04:13:24.760 align:start position:0%
so you know theoretically could that
 
04:13:26.510 --> 04:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
happen I suppose it's possible but it
 
04:13:30.229 --> 04:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
seems to me that it it's no more likely
 
04:13:32.590 --> 04:13:32.600 align:start position:0%
to happen with with this amendment than
 
04:13:34.389 --> 04:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
it is under existing law and it seems
 
04:13:37.870 --> 04:13:37.880 align:start position:0%
like it doesn't happen so I I think that
 
04:13:40.189 --> 04:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm sort of satisfied with
 
04:13:43.149 --> 04:13:43.159 align:start position:0%
that representative Burch uh
 
04:13:45.510 --> 04:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
respectfully it'll never happen if we
 
04:13:48.710 --> 04:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
defeat the otpa in vote itl then we
 
04:13:50.070 --> 04:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
don't have to worry about whether it'll
 
04:13:52.389 --> 04:13:52.399 align:start position:0%
happen or not because it won't thank you

to uh House Bill 188 and I'm going to
 
04:16:41.109 --> 04:16:41.119 align:start position:0%
recognize myself and I move uh to pass
 
04:16:44.550 --> 04:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
House Bill uh 88 is there a second I
 
04:16:46.950 --> 04:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
second that seconded moved by myself
 
04:16:49.189 --> 04:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative Alexander and
 
04:16:51.309 --> 04:16:51.319 align:start position:0%
so what I what I'm I'm going to this is
 
04:16:52.429 --> 04:16:52.439 align:start position:0%
a little
 
04:16:55.109 --> 04:16:55.119 align:start position:0%
bit maybe a little bit unusual but I'm
 
04:16:56.750 --> 04:16:56.760 align:start position:0%
not I know you have an amendment
 
04:16:59.830 --> 04:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
representative Manos I'm I'm not
 
04:17:02.870 --> 04:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
inclined to take up that Amendment but I
 
04:17:05.389 --> 04:17:05.399 align:start position:0%
but I do want to give you an opportunity
 
04:17:07.870 --> 04:17:07.880 align:start position:0%
to just tell as I understand it the
 
04:17:10.630 --> 04:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
amendment changes the Superior Court to
 
04:17:13.469 --> 04:17:13.479 align:start position:0%
the Circuit Court so
 
04:17:16.070 --> 04:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
I in the interest of sort of having a
 
04:17:18.910 --> 04:17:18.920 align:start position:0%
discussion let tell us why you think
 
04:17:21.189 --> 04:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
that well Mr Mr chair to be fair you
 
04:17:22.469 --> 04:17:22.479 align:start position:0%
have to entertain an amendment if it's
 
04:17:25.030 --> 04:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
not to pass motion she can move her
 
04:17:28.189 --> 04:17:28.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:31.189 --> 04:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
wants yes I do want she she can call for
 
04:17:33.070 --> 04:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
a vote on the amendment I see I see what
 
04:17:36.309 --> 04:17:36.319 align:start position:0%
you're saying okay okay all right so all
 
04:17:38.349 --> 04:17:38.359 align:start position:0%
right so I guess then we'll I'll I'll
 
04:17:40.550 --> 04:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
recognize you then do you you move you
 
04:17:40.560 --> 04:17:41.670 align:start position:0%
recognize you then do you you move you
move

04:17:41.670 --> 04:17:41.680 align:start position:0%
move
 
04:17:47.149 --> 04:17:47.159 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh uh o 0921 h 0921 all right
 
04:17:49.429 --> 04:17:49.439 align:start position:0%
um very briefly Mr chair thank you first

04:17:57.269 --> 04:17:57.279 align:start position:0%
mve by uh representative Manos seconded
 
04:17:59.189 --> 04:17:59.199 align:start position:0%
by representative
 
04:17:59.199 --> 04:18:00.990 align:start position:0%
by representative
Perez

04:18:00.990 --> 04:18:01.000 align:start position:0%
Perez
 
04:18:03.990 --> 04:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh go ahead representative Manos thank
 
04:18:07.670 --> 04:18:07.680 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair very briefly um my
 
04:18:10.630 --> 04:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
Amendment does um
 
04:18:14.510 --> 04:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
align the the misdemeanor offense here
 
04:18:17.670 --> 04:18:17.680 align:start position:0%
both criminal and uh the criminal
 
04:18:20.109 --> 04:18:20.119 align:start position:0%
offense of misdemeanor with it being in
 
04:18:22.990 --> 04:18:23.000 align:start position:0%
the Circuit Court um so that's what it
 
04:18:25.389 --> 04:18:25.399 align:start position:0%
does it also takes out all the
 
04:18:28.149 --> 04:18:28.159 align:start position:0%
references to committees subcommittees
 
04:18:28.159 --> 04:18:29.109 align:start position:0%
references to committees subcommittees
joint

04:18:29.109 --> 04:18:29.119 align:start position:0%
joint
 
04:18:33.510 --> 04:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
committies um I'm not sure that OS
 
04:18:36.469 --> 04:18:36.479 align:start position:0%
drafted this in a way that um we can
 
04:18:40.030 --> 04:18:40.040 align:start position:0%
easily see that but it does do that
 
04:18:43.229 --> 04:18:43.239 align:start position:0%
um and so those are the two
 
04:18:45.070 --> 04:18:45.080 align:start position:0%
uh changes that it makes to the
 
04:18:45.080 --> 04:18:50.630 align:start position:0%
uh changes that it makes to the
underlying

04:18:50.630 --> 04:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:52.550 --> 04:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
Bill I've got
 
04:18:54.990 --> 04:18:55.000 align:start position:0%
one can I speak to that as
 
04:18:57.870 --> 04:18:57.880 align:start position:0%
well uh so you want you're speaking to
 
04:19:00.429 --> 04:19:00.439 align:start position:0%
representative Manos amend yes yes go
 
04:19:00.439 --> 04:19:01.590 align:start position:0%
representative Manos amend yes yes go
ahead

04:19:01.590 --> 04:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
04:19:06.109 --> 04:19:06.119 align:start position:0%
please uh so um I just circulated around
 
04:19:07.710 --> 04:19:07.720 align:start position:0%
another amendment which is not what
 
04:19:09.670 --> 04:19:09.680 align:start position:0%
we're talking about at the moment um
 
04:19:11.109 --> 04:19:11.119 align:start position:0%
these were supposed to be two separate
 
04:19:13.229 --> 04:19:13.239 align:start position:0%
amendments but um
 
04:19:15.109 --> 04:19:15.119 align:start position:0%
representative Manos Incorporated mine
 
04:19:17.710 --> 04:19:17.720 align:start position:0%
into hers um so I just kind of wanted to
 
04:19:20.269 --> 04:19:20.279 align:start position:0%
make it clear that um there are two
 
04:19:22.070 --> 04:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
separate Concepts on the table one of
 
04:19:24.070 --> 04:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
them related to The Courts one of them
 
04:19:27.670 --> 04:19:27.680 align:start position:0%
related to some extraneous language that
 
04:19:31.309 --> 04:19:31.319 align:start position:0%
was included about other entities um
 
04:19:33.189 --> 04:19:33.199 align:start position:0%
that I I believe from from your
 
04:19:35.189 --> 04:19:35.199 align:start position:0%
testimony Mr chair might have been
 
04:19:38.030 --> 04:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
Incorporated from federal language but
 
04:19:40.429 --> 04:19:40.439 align:start position:0%
that those entities do not have the
 
04:19:43.590 --> 04:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
ability to make um um or to issue
 
04:19:46.189 --> 04:19:46.199 align:start position:0%
subpoenas so I I just take I took those
 
04:19:48.830 --> 04:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
pieces out to clear up the language so
 
04:19:52.030 --> 04:19:52.040 align:start position:0%
if you favor um representative Manos is
 
04:19:54.149 --> 04:19:54.159 align:start position:0%
I I did I did check and it looks like
 
04:19:57.790 --> 04:19:57.800 align:start position:0%
it's her her amendment is the same as
 
04:20:00.630 --> 04:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
what would be there um plus the the
 
04:20:03.149 --> 04:20:03.159 align:start position:0%
change in the courts and if if that does
 
04:20:05.790 --> 04:20:05.800 align:start position:0%
not go then I might speak to my
 
04:20:08.149 --> 04:20:08.159 align:start position:0%
men all right anyone else wish to be
 
04:20:10.189 --> 04:20:10.199 align:start position:0%
heard all right so I guess what I would
 
04:20:12.189 --> 04:20:12.199 align:start position:0%
I I guess what I say is I have two
 
04:20:13.830 --> 04:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
things on that
 
04:20:17.269 --> 04:20:17.279 align:start position:0%
first with regard to which
 
04:20:19.710 --> 04:20:19.720 align:start position:0%
court I as I think I mentioned at the
 
04:20:22.790 --> 04:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
hearing I deliberately chose the
 
04:20:24.670 --> 04:20:24.680 align:start position:0%
superior court
 
04:20:28.830 --> 04:20:28.840 align:start position:0%
because it's a constitutional Court um
 
04:20:33.269 --> 04:20:33.279 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that this this would be
 
04:20:35.910 --> 04:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
the kind of proceeding that ought to go
 
04:20:38.269 --> 04:20:38.279 align:start position:0%
to the superior court if you're going to
 
04:20:40.590 --> 04:20:40.600 align:start position:0%
you know if you're you're if the
 
04:20:43.109 --> 04:20:43.119 align:start position:0%
legislature asking the the judicial
 
04:20:46.670 --> 04:20:46.680 align:start position:0%
branch to find somebody in contempt send
 
04:20:48.830 --> 04:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
them potentially find them guilty of a
 
04:20:53.389 --> 04:20:53.399 align:start position:0%
crime or send them to uh uh send them
 
04:20:56.189 --> 04:20:56.199 align:start position:0%
potentially to jail until they comply it
 
04:20:59.910 --> 04:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
seems to me that this um is the kind of
 
04:21:02.950 --> 04:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
thing um that ought to go to the
 
04:21:05.109 --> 04:21:05.119 align:start position:0%
Constitutional trial court not the
 
04:21:08.149 --> 04:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court U more importantly to the
 
04:21:11.349 --> 04:21:11.359 align:start position:0%
extent that this calls for um the
 
04:21:13.710 --> 04:21:13.720 align:start position:0%
issuance of an injunction
 
04:21:16.229 --> 04:21:16.239 align:start position:0%
uh to compel somebody to comply on pain
 
04:21:19.389 --> 04:21:19.399 align:start position:0%
of being held in contempt uh generally
 
04:21:23.030 --> 04:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
the superior the the uh Circuit Court
 
04:21:24.990 --> 04:21:25.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't have Equity jurisdiction to
 
04:21:27.990 --> 04:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
issue injunctions now it true that in
 
04:21:30.830 --> 04:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
marital cases and something like that
 
04:21:33.269 --> 04:21:33.279 align:start position:0%
they do issue injunctions so it's you
 
04:21:35.790 --> 04:21:35.800 align:start position:0%
know it's not it's not an absolute hard
 
04:21:40.590 --> 04:21:40.600 align:start position:0%
and fast rule but it seems to me that um
 
04:21:43.630 --> 04:21:43.640 align:start position:0%
allowing this to go to the circuit Court
 
04:21:45.630 --> 04:21:45.640 align:start position:0%
um the other thing would be and
 
04:21:47.469 --> 04:21:47.479 align:start position:0%
especially if it's a criminal case
 
04:21:49.630 --> 04:21:49.640 align:start position:0%
there's a it's a misdemeanor that the
 
04:21:51.469 --> 04:21:51.479 align:start position:0%
state could charge it as a Class A
 
04:21:53.229 --> 04:21:53.239 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor which would mean there would
 
04:21:55.149 --> 04:21:55.159 align:start position:0%
be a right to a jury trial the Circuit
 
04:21:57.990 --> 04:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
Court doesn't do jury trials so for all
 
04:22:01.149 --> 04:22:01.159 align:start position:0%
of those reasons I think the having this
 
04:22:04.070 --> 04:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
proceeding in the in the superior court
 
04:22:06.550 --> 04:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
is the is the right thing to do with
 
04:22:08.149 --> 04:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
regard to the
 
04:22:08.159 --> 04:22:09.990 align:start position:0%
regard to the
language

04:22:09.990 --> 04:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
language
 
04:22:13.389 --> 04:22:13.399 align:start position:0%
about the you know joint committees and
 
04:22:15.790 --> 04:22:15.800 align:start position:0%
things like that I think that it's
 
04:22:19.070 --> 04:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
important to keep that language in there
 
04:22:19.080 --> 04:22:20.590 align:start position:0%
important to keep that language in there
because

04:22:20.590 --> 04:22:20.600 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:22:20.600 --> 04:22:22.429 align:start position:0%
because
um

04:22:22.429 --> 04:22:22.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:25.309 --> 04:22:25.319 align:start position:0%
the the way it's worded in the original
 
04:22:29.429 --> 04:22:29.439 align:start position:0%
bill um I I think the important language
 
04:22:33.109 --> 04:22:33.119 align:start position:0%
there is comply with a subpoena duly
 
04:22:39.189 --> 04:22:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:41.910 --> 04:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
that whatever the entity whether it's a
 
04:22:43.990 --> 04:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
house committee or a senate committee or
 
04:22:46.790 --> 04:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
a joint committee um and those are the
 
04:22:48.429 --> 04:22:48.439 align:start position:0%
three I think that are covered by the
 
04:22:50.590 --> 04:22:50.600 align:start position:0%
language of the original Bill those
 
04:22:52.550 --> 04:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
committees would have to have the author
 
04:22:55.910 --> 04:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
have been granted by rule the authority
 
04:22:58.750 --> 04:22:58.760 align:start position:0%
to issue subpoenas so I don't think I
 
04:23:00.349 --> 04:23:00.359 align:start position:0%
don't think that that language is
 
04:23:03.269 --> 04:23:03.279 align:start position:0%
extraneous I I did take it from the uh
 
04:23:07.990 --> 04:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
from the federal uh from the federal uh
 
04:23:09.830 --> 04:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
statute but I think that that could
 
04:23:12.950 --> 04:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
easily apply I mean the seems to me
 
04:23:14.710 --> 04:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
the house and the Senate by rule could
 
04:23:17.070 --> 04:23:17.080 align:start position:0%
authorize a joint committee to conduct
 
04:23:18.630 --> 04:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
an investigation and give that joint
 
04:23:21.389 --> 04:23:21.399 align:start position:0%
committee subpoena power so
 
04:23:21.399 --> 04:23:22.670 align:start position:0%
committee subpoena power so
representative

04:23:22.670 --> 04:23:22.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:23:25.429 --> 04:23:25.439 align:start position:0%
tur yeah just just on that part and just
 
04:23:29.389 --> 04:23:29.399 align:start position:0%
to explain a a little bit further um I
 
04:23:30.950 --> 04:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
did look at the rules of both the house
 
04:23:32.590 --> 04:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
and the Senate they're separate rule
 
04:23:35.070 --> 04:23:35.080 align:start position:0%
sets there's no Provisions in either one
 
04:23:39.469 --> 04:23:39.479 align:start position:0%
of them for referring to the other body
 
04:23:45.830 --> 04:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
um and uh the the power to issue it is
 
04:23:48.229 --> 04:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
not granted to the Committees it's only
 
04:23:51.349 --> 04:23:51.359 align:start position:0%
granted to the uh leader of either of
 
04:23:54.269 --> 04:23:54.279 align:start position:0%
those bodies and so I feel like leaving
 
04:23:57.670 --> 04:23:57.680 align:start position:0%
that language in there suggests although
 
04:23:59.030 --> 04:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
obviously there'd be no way to
 
04:24:02.109 --> 04:24:02.119 align:start position:0%
operationalize that language it seems to
 
04:24:05.229 --> 04:24:05.239 align:start position:0%
suggest that there is the authority and
 
04:24:07.030 --> 04:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
I believe that's what started this whole
 
04:24:09.229 --> 04:24:09.239 align:start position:0%
question to begin with last year was was
 
04:24:11.229 --> 04:24:11.239 align:start position:0%
a committee sort of asserting the
 
04:24:13.750 --> 04:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
ability to to issue a subpoena that they
 
04:24:17.510 --> 04:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
were not authorized to do so you know I
 
04:24:19.830 --> 04:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
I I hope you don't again be it through
 
04:24:21.710 --> 04:24:21.720 align:start position:0%
this amendment or maybe through through
 
04:24:25.710 --> 04:24:25.720 align:start position:0%
my second amendment if not uh agree that
 
04:24:28.070 --> 04:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
that taking it out would be cleaner than
 
04:24:30.149 --> 04:24:30.159 align:start position:0%
leaving it in because whatever house
 
04:24:32.670 --> 04:24:32.680 align:start position:0%
rules and they can change as long as we
 
04:24:36.189 --> 04:24:36.199 align:start position:0%
say duly authorized we're incorporating
 
04:24:39.630 --> 04:24:39.640 align:start position:0%
both bodies rules without having to
 
04:24:41.349 --> 04:24:41.359 align:start position:0%
potentially run into conflicts in the
 
04:24:43.550 --> 04:24:43.560 align:start position:0%
future true
 
04:24:46.670 --> 04:24:46.680 align:start position:0%
all right uh representative Manos yeahor
 
04:24:48.990 --> 04:24:49.000 align:start position:0%
representative Mana
 
04:24:51.870 --> 04:24:51.880 align:start position:0%
not so my understanding or this is my
 
04:24:54.309 --> 04:24:54.319 align:start position:0%
interpretation of that the subpoena is
 
04:24:57.550 --> 04:24:57.560 align:start position:0%
being issued and served by either house
 
04:25:00.990 --> 04:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
like the rules say the purpose of it is
 
04:25:03.590 --> 04:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
under an inquiry before either the whole
 
04:25:05.870 --> 04:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
house or any joint committee established
 
04:25:07.830 --> 04:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
by a joint or concurrent resolution of
 
04:25:10.550 --> 04:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
the two houses it just covers the areas
 
04:25:12.630 --> 04:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
of where the subpoena is where the
 
04:25:14.630 --> 04:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
inquiry is coming from a committee or a
 
04:25:17.109 --> 04:25:17.119 align:start position:0%
joint committee it doesn't change the
 
04:25:19.070 --> 04:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
fact that the subpoena is coming from
 
04:25:20.830 --> 04:25:20.840 align:start position:0%
the house the speaker of the house like
 
04:25:24.229 --> 04:25:24.239 align:start position:0%
the rules say so I I I see it as just
 
04:25:25.630 --> 04:25:25.640 align:start position:0%
the opposite of what you're saying this
 
04:25:27.910 --> 04:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
is just telling you where the inquiry is
 
04:25:31.269 --> 04:25:31.279 align:start position:0%
coming from and the only person that can
 
04:25:34.189 --> 04:25:34.199 align:start position:0%
issue it and serve it is the house of
 
04:25:37.149 --> 04:25:37.159 align:start position:0%
the general court either house being the
 
04:25:38.710 --> 04:25:38.720 align:start position:0%
speaker or the or the
 
04:25:41.030 --> 04:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
president all I'll say is it you know
 
04:25:42.990 --> 04:25:43.000 align:start position:0%
the rules change with each with each
 
04:25:45.149 --> 04:25:45.159 align:start position:0%
house session so I think it's it's
 
04:25:47.070 --> 04:25:47.080 align:start position:0%
cleaner not to have it but understand
 
04:25:49.389 --> 04:25:49.399 align:start position:0%
what you're saying yeah see I guess I
 
04:25:51.510 --> 04:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
what I think my concern is I think it's
 
04:25:53.269 --> 04:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
actually cleaner to leave it to have it
 
04:25:56.070 --> 04:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
in there because it covers then all
 
04:25:58.750 --> 04:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
situations I mean if you I would I would
 
04:26:00.870 --> 04:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
not want to
 
04:26:03.429 --> 04:26:03.439 align:start position:0%
have potentially a situation suppose
 
04:26:05.710 --> 04:26:05.720 align:start position:0%
that the house and the Senate decided in
 
04:26:07.710 --> 04:26:07.720 align:start position:0%
some year that they were going to
 
04:26:11.229 --> 04:26:11.239 align:start position:0%
authorize a joint um investigation to be
 
04:26:16.950 --> 04:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
conducted by by the two bodies um and um
 
04:26:19.269 --> 04:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
they were going to um they were going to
 
04:26:22.309 --> 04:26:22.319 align:start position:0%
authorize that body that that joint
 
04:26:24.229 --> 04:26:24.239 align:start position:0%
committee to to have the power of
 
04:26:26.790 --> 04:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
issuing subpoenas I would not I think
 
04:26:28.429 --> 04:26:28.439 align:start position:0%
under the language of the bill as I
 
04:26:31.469 --> 04:26:31.479 align:start position:0%
drafted it that would that would then be
 
04:26:34.950 --> 04:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
a duly authorized issued subpoena but
 
04:26:38.030 --> 04:26:38.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that it would be under I
 
04:26:40.189 --> 04:26:40.199 align:start position:0%
mean at least an argument could be made
 
04:26:43.630 --> 04:26:43.640 align:start position:0%
well um maybe that's not one that's
 
04:26:45.309 --> 04:26:45.319 align:start position:0%
that's authorized under your language
 
04:26:47.189 --> 04:26:47.199 align:start position:0%
that's that's my only concern so that's
 
04:26:48.630 --> 04:26:48.640 align:start position:0%
why I think the language the broader
 
04:26:51.229 --> 04:26:51.239 align:start position:0%
language um and as I said I with regard
 
04:26:52.910 --> 04:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
to the Circuit or Superior Court I think
 
04:26:56.469 --> 04:26:56.479 align:start position:0%
I've already stated my reasons so I I
 
04:26:59.349 --> 04:26:59.359 align:start position:0%
guess representative tur
 
04:27:01.229 --> 04:27:01.239 align:start position:0%
should does
 
04:27:03.630 --> 04:27:03.640 align:start position:0%
your does representative
 
04:27:07.309 --> 04:27:07.319 align:start position:0%
Manos uh Amendment Encompass the things
 
04:27:09.870 --> 04:27:09.880 align:start position:0%
that I mean is it does it Encompass your
 
04:27:11.510 --> 04:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment do we have to vote separately
 
04:27:13.109 --> 04:27:13.119 align:start position:0%
on both of them or just just
 
04:27:16.469 --> 04:27:16.479 align:start position:0%
representative Manos well if if if if
 
04:27:19.469 --> 04:27:19.479 align:start position:0%
you don't support representative Manos
 
04:27:21.990 --> 04:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
is amendment then I would wonder if you
 
04:27:23.830 --> 04:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
would consider mine without the change
 
04:27:26.309 --> 04:27:26.319 align:start position:0%
in the court system but okay um
 
04:27:29.030 --> 04:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
otherwise I did a quick read and um and
 
04:27:30.750 --> 04:27:30.760 align:start position:0%
I did send you a mark send everyone a
 
04:27:33.389 --> 04:27:33.399 align:start position:0%
mark up by email showing what I took out
 
04:27:36.670 --> 04:27:36.680 align:start position:0%
but um I I believe represent Manos is uh
 
04:27:38.750 --> 04:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment incorporates mine as well all
 
04:27:40.750 --> 04:27:40.760 align:start position:0%
right well so let's then let's see where
 
04:27:42.910 --> 04:27:42.920 align:start position:0%
let's see where we go on the Manos
 
04:27:45.469 --> 04:27:45.479 align:start position:0%
Amendment and then if that if that fails
 
04:27:50.750 --> 04:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
I'll turn to yours um so I I uh just to
 
04:27:52.630 --> 04:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
sum up I plan to vote against the Manos
 
04:27:54.189 --> 04:27:54.199 align:start position:0%
Amendment for the reasons I've I've just
 
04:27:55.670 --> 04:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
stated anyone else have anything they
 
04:27:59.309 --> 04:27:59.319 align:start position:0%

04:34:51.670 --> 04:34:51.680 align:start position:0%
pass is there a second representative
 
04:34:54.670 --> 04:34:54.680 align:start position:0%

04:34:58.310 --> 04:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
second um hang
 
04:34:58.320 --> 04:35:01.150 align:start position:0%

04:35:01.160 --> 04:35:03.750 align:start position:0%
on
um

04:35:03.750 --> 04:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:09.189 --> 04:35:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:26.310 --> 04:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:31.670 --> 04:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
um so I I uh basically it what this bill
 
04:35:35.070 --> 04:35:35.080 align:start position:0%
provides is that um class action uh if
 
04:35:38.510 --> 04:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
there's if there's money that's not
 
04:35:42.789 --> 04:35:42.799 align:start position:0%
um to be distributed to class members um
 
04:35:46.629 --> 04:35:46.639 align:start position:0%
then it then it sheets to uh the state
 
04:35:49.590 --> 04:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
and that the doctrine of s prey shall
 
04:35:54.949 --> 04:35:54.959 align:start position:0%
not apply to allow uh courts
 
04:35:58.150 --> 04:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
to allow monies that are not distributed
 
04:36:00.789 --> 04:36:00.799 align:start position:0%
to class members to
 
04:36:04.310 --> 04:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
be diverted and I know that might some
 
04:36:05.869 --> 04:36:05.879 align:start position:0%
people might say maybe diverted is the
 
04:36:09.310 --> 04:36:09.320 align:start position:0%
wrong word but change to another purpose
 
04:36:12.230 --> 04:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
um I think that um
 
04:36:15.949 --> 04:36:15.959 align:start position:0%
um makes sense the bill also would would
 
04:36:20.109 --> 04:36:20.119 align:start position:0%
provide that um attorney fees Awards in
 
04:36:21.590 --> 04:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
in uh consent
 
04:36:24.789 --> 04:36:24.799 align:start position:0%
decrees um are limited to that as
 
04:36:28.470 --> 04:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
provided in The lafy Matrix and if the
 
04:36:32.429 --> 04:36:32.439 align:start position:0%
bill was was limited to saying that I
 
04:36:34.029 --> 04:36:34.039 align:start position:0%
would have some problems with it but it
 
04:36:35.830 --> 04:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
says unless otherwise unless the court
 
04:36:37.230 --> 04:36:37.240 align:start position:0%
otherwise determined so the court would
 
04:36:40.230 --> 04:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
have discretion to to you know find that
 
04:36:42.869 --> 04:36:42.879 align:start position:0%
some other method of awarding attorney's
 
04:36:44.750 --> 04:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
fees was appropriate and I think as long
 
04:36:46.750 --> 04:36:46.760 align:start position:0%
as the court has that discretion I don't
 
04:36:48.750 --> 04:36:48.760 align:start position:0%
have any problem with that so for those
 
04:36:51.789 --> 04:36:51.799 align:start position:0%
reasons I uh I would support the bill I
 
04:36:54.869 --> 04:36:54.879 align:start position:0%
intend to vote um in favor anyone else
 
04:36:57.470 --> 04:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
wish to be heard on uh
 
04:37:01.709 --> 04:37:01.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:03.949 --> 04:37:03.959 align:start position:0%
bur thank you Mr
 
04:37:03.959 --> 04:37:05.510 align:start position:0%
bur thank you Mr
chair

04:37:05.510 --> 04:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:37:09.429 --> 04:37:09.439 align:start position:0%
what troubles me about this bill
 
04:37:12.470 --> 04:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
is I get that mail from time to time
 
04:37:15.390 --> 04:37:15.400 align:start position:0%
that there's a class action filed and
 
04:37:18.230 --> 04:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
please return the proper forms and you
 
04:37:20.789 --> 04:37:20.799 align:start position:0%
might get your $4 and 23 cents out of
 
04:37:23.470 --> 04:37:23.480 align:start position:0%
the class action I'm sure most of us
 
04:37:28.629 --> 04:37:28.639 align:start position:0%
have gotten those these tend to be
 
04:37:31.070 --> 04:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
Nationwide uh
 
04:37:31.080 --> 04:37:32.750 align:start position:0%
Nationwide uh
multi-jurisdictional

04:37:32.750 --> 04:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
multi-jurisdictional
 
04:37:36.109 --> 04:37:36.119 align:start position:0%
lawsuits um often large corporations
 
04:37:37.670 --> 04:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
have done something wrong and they need
 
04:37:40.150 --> 04:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
to refund some or they're being sued
 
04:37:44.470 --> 04:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
they might have to refund some money um
 
04:37:47.869 --> 04:37:47.879 align:start position:0%
it makes little sense to
 
04:37:53.910 --> 04:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
me for New Hampshire to create its
 
04:37:53.920 --> 04:37:57.830 align:start position:0%
me for New Hampshire to create its
own

04:37:57.830 --> 04:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:02.390 --> 04:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
system for distribution of money and the
 
04:38:06.390 --> 04:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
like which may be in conflict with
 
04:38:09.910 --> 04:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
what's happening in maybe 49 or or
 
04:38:12.470 --> 04:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
however many states are being fected by
 
04:38:15.629 --> 04:38:15.639 align:start position:0%
this class action suit so all of a
 
04:38:15.639 --> 04:38:17.150 align:start position:0%
this class action suit so all of a
sudden

04:38:17.150 --> 04:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
sudden
 
04:38:20.709 --> 04:38:20.719 align:start position:0%
um whoever is disgorging this money
 
04:38:23.349 --> 04:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
whether it's the court somewhere in
 
04:38:27.070 --> 04:38:27.080 align:start position:0%
Omaha or somewhere else uh wherever
 
04:38:29.029 --> 04:38:29.039 align:start position:0%
they're dis gorging it is going to have
 
04:38:32.629 --> 04:38:32.639 align:start position:0%
to pay attention to HB
 
04:38:32.639 --> 04:38:34.709 align:start position:0%
to pay attention to HB
687

04:38:34.709 --> 04:38:34.719 align:start position:0%
687
 
04:38:34.719 --> 04:38:36.629 align:start position:0%
687
separately

04:38:36.629 --> 04:38:36.639 align:start position:0%
separately
 
04:38:39.429 --> 04:38:39.439 align:start position:0%
um and and the like and I know it's just
 
04:38:42.551 --> 04:38:42.561 align:start position:0%
talking about money that it's otherwise
 
04:38:42.561 --> 04:38:43.590 align:start position:0%
talking about money that it's otherwise
not

04:38:43.590 --> 04:38:43.600 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:38:46.269 --> 04:38:46.279 align:start position:0%
distributed but this might work well to
 
04:38:50.990 --> 04:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
me in um in class action that's solely
 
04:38:54.109 --> 04:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but I don't see maybe I've
 
04:38:58.670 --> 04:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
just missed it that um this applies to
 
04:39:01.551 --> 04:39:01.561 align:start position:0%
all class actions that affect the
 
04:39:04.189 --> 04:39:04.199 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire and I just
 
04:39:07.349 --> 04:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
don't see it's it's uh it's
 
04:39:09.629 --> 04:39:09.639 align:start position:0%
workable right anyone else wish to be
 
04:39:09.639 --> 04:39:11.750 align:start position:0%
workable right anyone else wish to be
heard

04:39:11.750 --> 04:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
heard
 
04:39:14.869 --> 04:39:14.879 align:start position:0%
so I guess I think my my response to
 
04:39:17.510 --> 04:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
that representative ber it seems to me
 
04:39:21.709 --> 04:39:21.719 align:start position:0%
that it would it would only apply to
 
04:39:23.830 --> 04:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
class actions that New Hampshire has
 
04:39:25.230 --> 04:39:25.240 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over and I would it would
 
04:39:27.390 --> 04:39:27.400 align:start position:0%
seem to me that if there was a if there
 
04:39:29.470 --> 04:39:29.480 align:start position:0%
was a nationwide class action let's say
 
04:39:31.949 --> 04:39:31.959 align:start position:0%
it was in federal court or in the court
 
04:39:34.029 --> 04:39:34.039 align:start position:0%
of some other state I would assume that
 
04:39:37.948 --> 04:39:37.958 align:start position:0%
the that the uh how proceeds should be
 
04:39:40.910 --> 04:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
distributed would be determined by the
 
04:39:42.868 --> 04:39:42.878 align:start position:0%
court that state or the federal court
 
04:39:44.150 --> 04:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire wouldn't have any
 
04:39:44.160 --> 04:39:47.430 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire wouldn't have any
jurisdiction

04:39:47.430 --> 04:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:49.990 --> 04:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
so that that's the way I would interpr
 
04:39:51.830 --> 04:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
it would be nice if it said
 
04:39:53.788 --> 04:39:53.798 align:start position:0%
it well
 
04:39:56.670 --> 04:39:56.680 align:start position:0%
I I I I don't think it I'm not I'm not
 
04:39:58.510 --> 04:39:58.520 align:start position:0%
sure that if it does that by not saying
 
04:40:00.390 --> 04:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
it that would give New Hampshire some
 
04:40:01.948 --> 04:40:01.958 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction where it wouldn't otherwise
 
04:40:04.830 --> 04:40:04.840 align:start position:0%
have jurisdiction so anyone yes
 
04:40:07.390 --> 04:40:07.400 align:start position:0%
representative H it gives no definition
 
04:40:09.788 --> 04:40:09.798 align:start position:0%
of what the lafy Matrix is and I never
 
04:40:11.990 --> 04:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
heard of it until this bill came along
 
04:40:14.430 --> 04:40:14.440 align:start position:0%
but it's apparently there are several
 
04:40:15.788 --> 04:40:15.798 align:start position:0%
different versions of it and there's
 
04:40:19.590 --> 04:40:19.600 align:start position:0%
other matrices used in other uh in other
 
04:40:21.830 --> 04:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions apparently only originated
 
04:40:24.510 --> 04:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
in the Washington in the baltim
 
04:40:26.830 --> 04:40:26.840 align:start position:0%
Washington DC Baltimore metro area so
 
04:40:28.750 --> 04:40:28.760 align:start position:0%
that's uh that seems like a pretty
 
04:40:30.550 --> 04:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
glaring weakness with the builder relies
 
04:40:32.788 --> 04:40:32.798 align:start position:0%
on something that um it doesn't say
 
04:40:35.350 --> 04:40:35.360 align:start position:0%
exactly what it is
 
04:40:39.230 --> 04:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
so yeah uh yes representative Burch if I
 
04:40:41.430 --> 04:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
could just go a little further on that
 
04:40:43.390 --> 04:40:43.400 align:start position:0%
uh yes The Laffy Matrix has been
 
04:40:46.510 --> 04:40:46.520 align:start position:0%
rejected by numerous numerous numerous
 
04:40:49.390 --> 04:40:49.400 align:start position:0%
courts and there's even a laughly matrix
 
04:40:51.868 --> 04:40:51.878 align:start position:0%
to which has also been rejected by
 
04:40:53.910 --> 04:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
numerous federal courts though I think
 
04:40:56.510 --> 04:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
the Baltimore Washington jurisdiction
 
04:40:59.708 --> 04:40:59.718 align:start position:0%
around there is one that still does it
 
04:41:03.550 --> 04:41:03.560 align:start position:0%
why we would be promoting or suggesting
 
04:41:05.910 --> 04:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
or having that as the option of first
 
04:41:08.708 --> 04:41:08.718 align:start position:0%
course I don't know given how rejected
 
04:41:11.830 --> 04:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
it's been
 
04:41:13.990 --> 04:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
so I I guess my my only response to that
 
04:41:16.788 --> 04:41:16.798 align:start position:0%
would be if if as I said before if if
 
04:41:19.350 --> 04:41:19.360 align:start position:0%
the if there wasn't the unless say
 
04:41:21.150 --> 04:41:21.160 align:start position:0%
language in there I might be concerned
 
04:41:23.510 --> 04:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
about that but since the uh New
 
04:41:25.070 --> 04:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire courts I think are fully
 
04:41:28.110 --> 04:41:28.120 align:start position:0%
capable of determining whether you know
 
04:41:29.788 --> 04:41:29.798 align:start position:0%
it makes sense in a particular case or
 
04:41:32.190 --> 04:41:32.200 align:start position:0%
not I assume they would do
 
04:41:35.590 --> 04:41:35.600 align:start position:0%
that so anyway any anybody have anything
 
04:41:41.750 --> 04:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
further they want to say on um HB 687
 
04:41:46.550 --> 04:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing none um I the motion is uh o
 
04:41:49.708 --> 04:41:49.718 align:start position:0%
OTP on 687 and I'd ask the clerk to

04:44:20.030 --> 04:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
the amendment which um I know you have
 
04:44:24.070 --> 04:44:24.080 align:start position:0%
in front of you uh I have provided one
 
04:44:28.110 --> 04:44:28.120 align:start position:0%
page that is a sample disclaimer in 24o
 
04:44:30.868 --> 04:44:30.878 align:start position:0%
font which I'll come back to um and then
 
04:44:34.310 --> 04:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
I've provided you with the amendment uh
 
04:44:37.470 --> 04:44:37.480 align:start position:0%
this addresses I I believe the vast
 
04:44:40.390 --> 04:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
majority of the concerns that had been
 
04:44:40.400 --> 04:44:41.868 align:start position:0%
majority of the concerns that had been
expressed

04:44:41.868 --> 04:44:41.878 align:start position:0%
expressed
 
04:44:44.788 --> 04:44:44.798 align:start position:0%
uh relative to the the the prime
 
04:44:49.990 --> 04:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
sponsor's original language um and so I
 
04:44:53.030 --> 04:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
what I would talk about is is really
 
04:44:56.070 --> 04:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
just let's focus on the amended bill um
 
04:44:58.070 --> 04:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire students deserve
 
04:44:59.990 --> 04:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
transparency when making one of the
 
04:45:01.910 --> 04:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
biggest financial decisions of their
 
04:45:05.510 --> 04:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
lives investing in a college degree is
 
04:45:08.190 --> 04:45:08.200 align:start position:0%
something that comes with significant
 
04:45:09.550 --> 04:45:09.560 align:start position:0%
costs and
 
04:45:11.948 --> 04:45:11.958 align:start position:0%
risks uh and
 
04:45:14.110 --> 04:45:14.120 align:start position:0%
indeed opportunity costs that that are
 
04:45:16.590 --> 04:45:16.600 align:start position:0%
lost versus uh what else they could be
 
04:45:19.750 --> 04:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
getting up to and so when we examine the
 
04:45:22.270 --> 04:45:22.280 align:start position:0%
circumstances we see that prospective
 
04:45:25.590 --> 04:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
students um are
 
04:45:28.070 --> 04:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
often unaware
 
04:45:32.550 --> 04:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
or uh regretful about the true costs and
 
04:45:34.788 --> 04:45:34.798 align:start position:0%
and those financial risks of higher
 
04:45:37.750 --> 04:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
education and so what we need to do is
 
04:45:40.310 --> 04:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
we need to make sure that we're giving
 
04:45:41.990 --> 04:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
them the cont text that we're giving
 
04:45:44.190 --> 04:45:44.200 align:start position:0%
them enough
 
04:45:46.390 --> 04:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
information that they can make a free
 
04:45:47.990 --> 04:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
market decision as to whether they want
 
04:45:51.670 --> 04:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
to enter into uh that degree program um
 
04:45:54.390 --> 04:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
and and make sure that they understand
 
04:45:54.400 --> 04:45:55.310 align:start position:0%
and and make sure that they understand
uh

04:45:55.310 --> 04:45:55.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:45:57.990 --> 04:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
what they're putting themselves down for
 
04:46:01.070 --> 04:46:01.080 align:start position:0%
and so the the uh the amended
 
04:46:03.750 --> 04:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
bill um it
 
04:46:08.470 --> 04:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
requires either that the educational
 
04:46:11.550 --> 04:46:11.560 align:start position:0%
institution provides certain disclosure
 
04:46:11.560 --> 04:46:13.070 align:start position:0%
institution provides certain disclosure
es

04:46:13.070 --> 04:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
es
 
04:46:15.708 --> 04:46:15.718 align:start position:0%
or that if the educational institution
 
04:46:17.390 --> 04:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
does not wish to do
 
04:46:20.350 --> 04:46:20.360 align:start position:0%
that that they get the prospective
 
04:46:23.030 --> 04:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
student upon matriculation to sign off
 
04:46:23.948 --> 04:46:23.958 align:start position:0%
on a
 
04:46:28.708 --> 04:46:28.718 align:start position:0%
disclaimer that's it right if if I am a
 
04:46:30.830 --> 04:46:30.840 align:start position:0%
company wanting to engage in the
 
04:46:33.190 --> 04:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
business of higher education and I say
 
04:46:34.430 --> 04:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
well I don't believe I should be
 
04:46:36.948 --> 04:46:36.958 align:start position:0%
regulated this heavily then you just
 
04:46:38.390 --> 04:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
need to get the student along with
 
04:46:41.628 --> 04:46:41.638 align:start position:0%
signing the other 37 pie of paper when
 
04:46:43.948 --> 04:46:43.958 align:start position:0%
they sign up to sign that piece of paper
 
04:46:48.030 --> 04:46:48.040 align:start position:0%
as well but if you do want to offer your
 
04:46:48.040 --> 04:46:49.070 align:start position:0%
as well but if you do want to offer your
prospective

04:46:49.070 --> 04:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
prospective
 
04:46:51.548 --> 04:46:51.558 align:start position:0%
students some strong information that
 
04:46:53.788 --> 04:46:53.798 align:start position:0%
may be helpful to them in the
 
04:46:56.510 --> 04:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
marketplace this bill lays out a number
 
04:46:59.030 --> 04:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
of of items that we would like to see in
 
04:47:02.390 --> 04:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
there and in particular what it does is
 
04:47:04.350 --> 04:47:04.360 align:start position:0%
it helps them
 
04:47:07.390 --> 04:47:07.400 align:start position:0%
understand how much they are likely to
 
04:47:09.230 --> 04:47:09.240 align:start position:0%
make whether they're likely to graduate
 
04:47:11.548 --> 04:47:11.558 align:start position:0%
whether they're likely to be
 
04:47:13.948 --> 04:47:13.958 align:start position:0%
successful uh and gives them the
 
04:47:16.230 --> 04:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity to contemplate options and
 
04:47:18.990 --> 04:47:19.000 align:start position:0%
it also identifies to them something
 
04:47:20.708 --> 04:47:20.718 align:start position:0%
that I've come across plenty of students
 
04:47:23.190 --> 04:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
that still to this day don't understand
 
04:47:25.830 --> 04:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
and that is that with the changes in
 
04:47:29.350 --> 04:47:29.360 align:start position:0%
federal law uh that we have seen uh a
 
04:47:31.750 --> 04:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
lot of these student loans are not
 
04:47:34.910 --> 04:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
dischargeable in bankruptcy so either
 
04:47:37.270 --> 04:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
way whether the educational institution
 
04:47:38.830 --> 04:47:38.840 align:start position:0%
chooses to provide the information or
 
04:47:41.150 --> 04:47:41.160 align:start position:0%
whether they don't uh that fact Act is
 
04:47:43.670 --> 04:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
going to become abundantly clear to the
 
04:47:46.110 --> 04:47:46.120 align:start position:0%
the student who's signing up um so I
 
04:47:48.230 --> 04:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
think beyond that I would be happy to
 
04:47:50.470 --> 04:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
answer any questions but I I just
 
04:47:53.030 --> 04:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
encourage you to move or to pass all
 
04:47:55.350 --> 04:47:55.360 align:start position:0%
right qu representative Smith and then
 
04:47:57.110 --> 04:47:57.120 align:start position:0%
representative Horton thank you I do
 
04:47:59.470 --> 04:47:59.480 align:start position:0%
have a few questions until the chair
 
04:48:04.590 --> 04:48:04.600 align:start position:0%
stops me um I notice um representative
 
04:48:07.548 --> 04:48:07.558 align:start position:0%
um that all this refers to the students
 
04:48:10.910 --> 04:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
does any of it refer to the people who
 
04:48:14.670 --> 04:48:14.680 align:start position:0%
in fact are signing the checks which is
 
04:48:14.680 --> 04:48:15.670 align:start position:0%
in fact are signing the checks which is
most

04:48:15.670 --> 04:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
most
 
04:48:18.510 --> 04:48:18.520 align:start position:0%
likely uh the
 
04:48:21.868 --> 04:48:21.878 align:start position:0%
parents so first off the answer is it
 
04:48:25.270 --> 04:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
does refer to the students right the the
 
04:48:27.750 --> 04:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
purpose of this bill is less about
 
04:48:31.548 --> 04:48:31.558 align:start position:0%
presenting a cause of action um for
 
04:48:33.948 --> 04:48:33.958 align:start position:0%
whether it's students or whomever uh
 
04:48:37.470 --> 04:48:37.480 align:start position:0%
than Travis's original bill was um this
 
04:48:42.030 --> 04:48:42.040 align:start position:0%
bill is now uh about transparency and
 
04:48:45.590 --> 04:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
disclosure so at one level you could say
 
04:48:48.510 --> 04:48:48.520 align:start position:0%
that that that aspect of it is is less
 
04:48:51.548 --> 04:48:51.558 align:start position:0%
material um but I would also say that uh
 
04:48:55.350 --> 04:48:55.360 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day uh entering into a
 
04:48:57.910 --> 04:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
degree program is a decision that should
 
04:49:00.548 --> 04:49:00.558 align:start position:0%
be made on an informed basis by the
 
04:49:02.350 --> 04:49:02.360 align:start position:0%
student themselves and they should not
 
04:49:05.868 --> 04:49:05.878 align:start position:0%
be being pushed into it uh by anyone
 
04:49:07.990 --> 04:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
including um their parents or the
 
04:49:09.590 --> 04:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
guardians or whoever may be paying their
 
04:49:11.990 --> 04:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
bills and I think when you look at the
 
04:49:13.548 --> 04:49:13.558 align:start position:0%
the entrepreneurship that we want to
 
04:49:16.030 --> 04:49:16.040 align:start position:0%
encourage in this country what you see a
 
04:49:17.948 --> 04:49:17.958 align:start position:0%
lot of times with college graduates is
 
04:49:21.788 --> 04:49:21.798 align:start position:0%
you see uh grads who are having on a
 
04:49:24.548 --> 04:49:24.558 align:start position:0%
regular you know recurring monthly basis
 
04:49:27.390 --> 04:49:27.400 align:start position:0%
to pay a certain nut to pay off their
 
04:49:30.948 --> 04:49:30.958 align:start position:0%
loans and are not able to uh just stop
 
04:49:33.150 --> 04:49:33.160 align:start position:0%
doing that so that they can contemplate
 
04:49:35.390 --> 04:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
starting up a small business or doing
 
04:49:37.628 --> 04:49:37.638 align:start position:0%
something else entrepreneurial um so I
 
04:49:39.190 --> 04:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
think to your question representative
 
04:49:41.190 --> 04:49:41.200 align:start position:0%
Smith I would suggest that the most
 
04:49:43.750 --> 04:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
important person in that decision is the
 
04:49:46.868 --> 04:49:46.878 align:start position:0%
student themselves could I follow up yes
 
04:49:49.390 --> 04:49:49.400 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that I said that
 
04:49:52.430 --> 04:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
didn't recognize that but when you're
 
04:49:56.230 --> 04:49:56.240 align:start position:0%
talking about financial matters the
 
04:50:00.350 --> 04:50:00.360 align:start position:0%
writing of the check I believe is rather
 
04:50:03.750 --> 04:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
important and the implications of that I
 
04:50:06.270 --> 04:50:06.280 align:start position:0%
I'm curious that you don't seem to think
 
04:50:11.510 --> 04:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
that that the check writers should have
 
04:50:13.510 --> 04:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
that information that it should only be
 
04:50:16.110 --> 04:50:16.120 align:start position:0%
the student oh I see okay so so two
 
04:50:18.350 --> 04:50:18.360 align:start position:0%
quick responses to that because I think
 
04:50:20.190 --> 04:50:20.200 align:start position:0%
it breaks down in two parts right one is
 
04:50:22.030 --> 04:50:22.040 align:start position:0%
as far as the information goes they
 
04:50:24.390 --> 04:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
would have that if if the educational
 
04:50:26.750 --> 04:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
institution chooses to comply with the
 
04:50:28.910 --> 04:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
disclosure requirements in here then
 
04:50:30.990 --> 04:50:31.000 align:start position:0%
that includes publishing it on a website
 
04:50:33.110 --> 04:50:33.120 align:start position:0%
for for anyone to see not just for the
 
04:50:34.670 --> 04:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
prospective students so that's the first
 
04:50:36.230 --> 04:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
part of the answer I think the second
 
04:50:37.868 --> 04:50:37.878 align:start position:0%
part of the answer is that to the extent
 
04:50:40.788 --> 04:50:40.798 align:start position:0%
that there's a desire to go after them
 
04:50:45.390 --> 04:50:45.400 align:start position:0%
um in court uh the the fact that the
 
04:50:47.830 --> 04:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
parents for example may have paid for
 
04:50:50.590 --> 04:50:50.600 align:start position:0%
the degree they are paying for that on
 
04:50:52.628 --> 04:50:52.638 align:start position:0%
behalf of the student for the benefit of
 
04:50:54.830 --> 04:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
the student and it's still the student
 
04:50:57.150 --> 04:50:57.160 align:start position:0%
who is harmed if they are going through
 
04:51:00.510 --> 04:51:00.520 align:start position:0%
a degree program that does not actually
 
04:51:02.868 --> 04:51:02.878 align:start position:0%
uh deliver on the Promises they could I
 
04:51:05.430 --> 04:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
ask one more and then I'll in the field
 
04:51:07.708 --> 04:51:07.718 align:start position:0%
for at least a while
 
04:51:11.510 --> 04:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
um uh of the let's just think about the
 
04:51:13.990 --> 04:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
people who are the students who are in
 
04:51:14.000 --> 04:51:15.430 align:start position:0%
people who are the students who are in
college

04:51:15.430 --> 04:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
college
 
04:51:21.350 --> 04:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
today and have uh decided on a major a
 
04:51:24.350 --> 04:51:24.360 align:start position:0%
focus of their college education
 
04:51:28.470 --> 04:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
today and are pursuing that at the cost
 
04:51:30.070 --> 04:51:30.080 align:start position:0%
that they
 
04:51:33.470 --> 04:51:33.480 align:start position:0%
incur of those students who are in
 
04:51:36.350 --> 04:51:36.360 align:start position:0%
college today and have chosen what they
 
04:51:36.360 --> 04:51:37.548 align:start position:0%
college today and have chosen what they
want

04:51:37.548 --> 04:51:37.558 align:start position:0%
want
 
04:51:41.750 --> 04:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
to uh specialize in
 
04:51:46.070 --> 04:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
how many of those students in five years
 
04:51:50.070 --> 04:51:50.080 align:start position:0%
will find that those
 
04:51:53.628 --> 04:51:53.638 align:start position:0%
particular folky the plural of focus in
 
04:51:58.750 --> 04:51:58.760 align:start position:0%
this case um uh are still relevant or
 
04:52:01.470 --> 04:52:01.480 align:start position:0%
that that particular
 
04:52:05.590 --> 04:52:05.600 align:start position:0%
Focus has gone the way of the Platypus
 
04:52:08.070 --> 04:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
and now they're doing something
 
04:52:10.788 --> 04:52:10.798 align:start position:0%
else so I don't have quantitative
 
04:52:12.510 --> 04:52:12.520 align:start position:0%
statistics on that in front of me but I
 
04:52:15.110 --> 04:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
would say to you anecdotally that first
 
04:52:19.948 --> 04:52:19.958 align:start position:0%
of all um the what we see in the
 
04:52:22.708 --> 04:52:22.718 align:start position:0%
marketplace is
 
04:52:26.948 --> 04:52:26.958 align:start position:0%
typically that yes people may end up
 
04:52:29.670 --> 04:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
pursuing a course of employment which is
 
04:52:35.070 --> 04:52:35.080 align:start position:0%
not 100% align to their their chosen
 
04:52:38.628 --> 04:52:38.638 align:start position:0%
major however I think we can more
 
04:52:41.070 --> 04:52:41.080 align:start position:0%
commonly see patterns
 
04:52:44.390 --> 04:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
in uh who is successful in the
 
04:52:47.590 --> 04:52:47.600 align:start position:0%
marketplace in in the workplace uh and
 
04:52:51.390 --> 04:52:51.400 align:start position:0%
what their major is and so uh you know I
 
04:52:54.070 --> 04:52:54.080 align:start position:0%
I think we can certainly anticipate that
 
04:52:55.670 --> 04:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
there are going to be different outcomes
 
04:52:59.390 --> 04:52:59.400 align:start position:0%
for a a similar quality student pursuing
 
04:53:02.110 --> 04:53:02.120 align:start position:0%
an underboard basket weaving degree than
 
04:53:05.910 --> 04:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
pursuing uh let's say uh a a law degree
 
04:53:07.430 --> 04:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
or a medicine
 
04:53:10.788 --> 04:53:10.798 align:start position:0%
degree could I just ask one more and
 
04:53:15.390 --> 04:53:15.400 align:start position:0%
that is is the sole purpose of higher
 
04:53:18.628 --> 04:53:18.638 align:start position:0%
education vocational training or are
 
04:53:22.110 --> 04:53:22.120 align:start position:0%
there any other benefits great question
 
04:53:23.390 --> 04:53:23.400 align:start position:0%
I mean the answer is really easy
 
04:53:26.510 --> 04:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely not but if you are somebody
 
04:53:29.548 --> 04:53:29.558 align:start position:0%
who is contemplating higher education
 
04:53:33.150 --> 04:53:33.160 align:start position:0%
for other purposes than to provide for
 
04:53:35.750 --> 04:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
yourself you are perfectly at Liberty to
 
04:53:38.230 --> 04:53:38.240 align:start position:0%
then either look at the disclosed
 
04:53:40.070 --> 04:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
information and ignore it or sign the
 
04:53:41.788 --> 04:53:41.798 align:start position:0%
disclos claer and you in a happy
 
04:53:44.510 --> 04:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
position and and I I wish those students
 
04:53:46.470 --> 04:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
well I do however think that there are
 
04:53:49.390 --> 04:53:49.400 align:start position:0%
too many students today who are not in
 
04:53:51.788 --> 04:53:51.798 align:start position:0%
that fortunate position to be able to
 
04:53:55.868 --> 04:53:55.878 align:start position:0%
study um purely for for uh other reasons
 
04:53:58.948 --> 04:53:58.958 align:start position:0%
than than employment uh who are
 
04:54:02.070 --> 04:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
occasioned to enter into degree programs
 
04:54:03.990 --> 04:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
for which they are not best suited or
 
04:54:06.030 --> 04:54:06.040 align:start position:0%
which are not best suited to give them
 
04:54:07.990 --> 04:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
the skills for their later
 
04:54:11.350 --> 04:54:11.360 align:start position:0%
life thank you other representative for
 
04:54:13.548 --> 04:54:13.558 align:start position:0%
um well we heard the clich say about
 
04:54:15.350 --> 04:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
basket weaving and actually some basket
 
04:54:17.030 --> 04:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
Weavers make good money but there aren't
 
04:54:18.990 --> 04:54:19.000 align:start position:0%
many openings at the top of the basket
 
04:54:21.990 --> 04:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
weaving industry but um yes that's why I
 
04:54:24.070 --> 04:54:24.080 align:start position:0%
refer to median earnings yes and of
 
04:54:26.910 --> 04:54:26.920 align:start position:0%
course then you get the uh
 
04:54:30.750 --> 04:54:30.760 align:start position:0%
um um and then but then they uh well you
 
04:54:32.788 --> 04:54:32.798 align:start position:0%
we got a letter from the uh director of
 
04:54:34.510 --> 04:54:34.520 align:start position:0%
government relations for University CST
 
04:54:36.470 --> 04:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and most you I'm
 
04:54:38.110 --> 04:54:38.120 align:start position:0%
probably the only one who printed it up
 
04:54:39.990 --> 04:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
and was then able to find my copy of it
 
04:54:41.230 --> 04:54:41.240 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
04:54:43.670 --> 04:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
where first of all they um don't have
 
04:54:45.590 --> 04:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
the earnings data for all of their
 
04:54:46.830 --> 04:54:46.840 align:start position:0%
graduates they would have to get it from
 
04:54:52.390 --> 04:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
the IRS although um UNH and most most
 
04:54:54.548 --> 04:54:54.558 align:start position:0%
universities colleges do make an effort
 
04:54:56.110 --> 04:54:56.120 align:start position:0%
to keep track of their students so I'll
 
04:55:00.390 --> 04:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
get to that later that they um do but so
 
04:55:02.070 --> 04:55:02.080 align:start position:0%
the first and uh so then they're going
 
04:55:05.470 --> 04:55:05.480 align:start position:0%
to say there is a program called the F
 
04:55:08.270 --> 04:55:08.280 align:start position:0%
Financial value transparency and gainful
 
04:55:12.350 --> 04:55:12.360 align:start position:0%
employment Reg fge e and that's been
 
04:55:14.628 --> 04:55:14.638 align:start position:0%
apparently uh in the works for several
 
04:55:16.350 --> 04:55:16.360 align:start position:0%
years and uh
 
04:55:18.830 --> 04:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that program is run by the
 
04:55:21.070 --> 04:55:21.080 align:start position:0%
IRS and not sure what's happening to all
 
04:55:22.910 --> 04:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
the IRS agents but I think a lot of them
 
04:55:25.628 --> 04:55:25.638 align:start position:0%
have been slashed with the chainsaw and
 
04:55:26.990 --> 04:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education which
 
04:55:28.910 --> 04:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
theoretically has been dismantled so
 
04:55:30.670 --> 04:55:30.680 align:start position:0%
you've got at least a non-exist an
 
04:55:31.910 --> 04:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
agency that supposed at least
 
04:55:34.628 --> 04:55:34.638 align:start position:0%
ostensively is non-existent U running
 
04:55:36.868 --> 04:55:36.878 align:start position:0%
this program that we're relying on and
 
04:55:40.430 --> 04:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
um so that's that's one problem uh this
 
04:55:43.190 --> 04:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
data this data the only data source we
 
04:55:44.590 --> 04:55:44.600 align:start position:0%
had to work of is one we can't really
 
04:55:48.150 --> 04:55:48.160 align:start position:0%
rely on existing in the future but um so
 
04:55:50.510 --> 04:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
that's a one problem with it we're also
 
04:55:51.830 --> 04:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
we're trying to punish the educational
 
04:55:54.230 --> 04:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
institutions for decisions you know
 
04:55:57.910 --> 04:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
individual decisions made by uh made by
 
04:55:59.350 --> 04:55:59.360 align:start position:0%
by the students and some of those work
 
04:56:00.708 --> 04:56:00.718 align:start position:0%
out better than others you know some
 
04:56:02.390 --> 04:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
people make good money out of basket
 
04:56:03.708 --> 04:56:03.718 align:start position:0%
weaving some people go on the law
 
04:56:05.670 --> 04:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
medicine and don't do so well it's has
 
04:56:07.230 --> 04:56:07.240 align:start position:0%
to do a lot with the individuals more
 
04:56:10.430 --> 04:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
than the choice of degree
 
04:56:12.270 --> 04:56:12.280 align:start position:0%
but then on the other hand we're talking
 
04:56:13.030 --> 04:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
about the
 
04:56:16.110 --> 04:56:16.120 align:start position:0%
marketplace uh colleges universities the
 
04:56:20.470 --> 04:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
major ones like UNH or uh the one I um
 
04:56:22.350 --> 04:56:22.360 align:start position:0%
the ones I went to they make a lot of
 
04:56:23.910 --> 04:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
effort to try to keep track of the
 
04:56:25.628 --> 04:56:25.638 align:start position:0%
graduates to like you know encourage
 
04:56:28.230 --> 04:56:28.240 align:start position:0%
them to network encourage them to earn
 
04:56:30.190 --> 04:56:30.200 align:start position:0%
more money and uh encourage them to be
 
04:56:31.788 --> 04:56:31.798 align:start position:0%
as generous as possible in the future
 
04:56:34.510 --> 04:56:34.520 align:start position:0%
after they get their degree um with
 
04:56:36.990 --> 04:56:37.000 align:start position:0%
their their earnings they these
 
04:56:39.470 --> 04:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
institutions do I I believe have a
 
04:56:41.708 --> 04:56:41.718 align:start position:0%
vested interest in um you know trying to
 
04:56:43.868 --> 04:56:43.878 align:start position:0%
maximize the earnings potential of their
 
04:56:45.628 --> 04:56:45.638 align:start position:0%
graduates even after they graduate so
 
04:56:47.150 --> 04:56:47.160 align:start position:0%
it's not just they take the tuitions and
 
04:56:50.110 --> 04:56:50.120 align:start position:0%
fees and then ignore them for the next
 
04:56:51.750 --> 04:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
you know years of the life because most
 
04:56:53.590 --> 04:56:53.600 align:start position:0%
people graduate when they're about 22 so
 
04:56:55.390 --> 04:56:55.400 align:start position:0%
they have about you know they've got
 
04:56:57.390 --> 04:56:57.400 align:start position:0%
like many decades of life ahead of them
 
04:57:00.430 --> 04:57:00.440 align:start position:0%
so I would probably uh I probably say we
 
04:57:01.708 --> 04:57:01.718 align:start position:0%
can probably actually rely on the
 
04:57:05.910 --> 04:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
marketplace uh to uh for them to prepare
 
04:57:07.510 --> 04:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
people for life and as I said it's hard
 
04:57:09.708 --> 04:57:09.718 align:start position:0%
to tell uh which degrees work out well
 
04:57:12.230 --> 04:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
as I said some people some people if
 
04:57:13.590 --> 04:57:13.600 align:start position:0%
you're very good at basket weaving you
 
04:57:14.990 --> 04:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
can actually make good money out of
 
04:57:16.708 --> 04:57:16.718 align:start position:0%
basket weaving it's probably harder than
 
04:57:18.310 --> 04:57:18.320 align:start position:0%
law or medicine and plenty of people go
 
04:57:19.670 --> 04:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
in the law medicine or whatever and they
 
04:57:21.788 --> 04:57:21.798 align:start position:0%
fail at it so all right great
 
04:57:21.798 --> 04:57:23.070 align:start position:0%
fail at it so all right great
representative

04:57:23.070 --> 04:57:23.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:57:26.548 --> 04:57:26.558 align:start position:0%
tur yeah thank you Mr chair so you know
 
04:57:29.030 --> 04:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
I look at this amendment and I I I know
 
04:57:30.670 --> 04:57:30.680 align:start position:0%
I don't get to probably raise questions
 
04:57:32.750 --> 04:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
of whether it's totally Germaine or not
 
04:57:35.628 --> 04:57:35.638 align:start position:0%
but um you know this feels very
 
04:57:37.750 --> 04:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
different than the bill that I read the
 
04:57:37.760 --> 04:57:38.948 align:start position:0%
different than the bill that I read the
original

04:57:38.948 --> 04:57:38.958 align:start position:0%
original
 
04:57:40.830 --> 04:57:40.840 align:start position:0%
Bill uh
 
04:57:42.910 --> 04:57:42.920 align:start position:0%
didn't allow you to make a free market
 
04:57:45.110 --> 04:57:45.120 align:start position:0%
decision about the value of Education it
 
04:57:47.470 --> 04:57:47.480 align:start position:0%
more or less told you what a good value
 
04:57:49.628 --> 04:57:49.638 align:start position:0%
was or wasn't and sort of made you sign
 
04:57:51.990 --> 04:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
waivers this seems
 
04:57:55.070 --> 04:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
to implement a whole completely
 
04:57:59.788 --> 04:57:59.798 align:start position:0%
different scheme around how um
 
04:58:02.070 --> 04:58:02.080 align:start position:0%
information would be compiled how it
 
04:58:04.990 --> 04:58:05.000 align:start position:0%
would be shared what it would contain
 
04:58:07.628 --> 04:58:07.638 align:start position:0%
sort of using you know retrospective
 
04:58:10.910 --> 04:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
data to to make Prospect effective
 
04:58:14.070 --> 04:58:14.080 align:start position:0%
judgments and I guess I would say I I
 
04:58:16.190 --> 04:58:16.200 align:start position:0%
find it kind of surprising that this is
 
04:58:17.590 --> 04:58:17.600 align:start position:0%
kind of just an amendment to the
 
04:58:19.230 --> 04:58:19.240 align:start position:0%
original bill this could have a whole
 
04:58:22.270 --> 04:58:22.280 align:start position:0%
hearing all by itself in my mind I can
 
04:58:23.788 --> 04:58:23.798 align:start position:0%
think of a whole bunch of questions that
 
04:58:26.750 --> 04:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
I would have would have asked here so I
 
04:58:29.830 --> 04:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
I don't know whether or
 
04:58:32.430 --> 04:58:32.440 align:start position:0%
not something other than passing this
 
04:58:35.590 --> 04:58:35.600 align:start position:0%
would be possible but it seems like this
 
04:58:37.910 --> 04:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
needs a lot more consideration than sort
 
04:58:41.190 --> 04:58:41.200 align:start position:0%
of an amendment that we all just at
 
04:58:41.200 --> 04:58:42.230 align:start position:0%
of an amendment that we all just at
right

04:58:42.230 --> 04:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:58:45.350 --> 04:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
representative uh bur
 
04:58:47.390 --> 04:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
sorry I would just start off as a
 
04:58:50.110 --> 04:58:50.120 align:start position:0%
preliminary matter in in response to
 
04:58:51.788 --> 04:58:51.798 align:start position:0%
what representative tur said and it's
 
04:58:54.270 --> 04:58:54.280 align:start position:0%
not directed against the representative
 
04:58:58.948 --> 04:58:58.958 align:start position:0%
filed this I have a general polic
 
04:59:02.390 --> 04:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
problem with filing complete rewrites of
 
04:59:07.230 --> 04:59:07.240 align:start position:0%
bills uh at the executive uh at the uh
 
04:59:11.070 --> 04:59:11.080 align:start position:0%
exec session and not having any input by
 
04:59:13.510 --> 04:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
the public no fiscal note which this
 
04:59:16.270 --> 04:59:16.280 align:start position:0%
thing clearly would require a major
 
04:59:20.110 --> 04:59:20.120 align:start position:0%
fiscal note because the impact on the uh
 
04:59:22.590 --> 04:59:22.600 align:start position:0%
uh schools universities and colleges in
 
04:59:26.110 --> 04:59:26.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire would be massive and then
 
04:59:29.750 --> 04:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
we have nobody with specific expertise
 
04:59:32.788 --> 04:59:32.798 align:start position:0%
to ask the particular questions of so
 
04:59:34.590 --> 04:59:34.600 align:start position:0%
that's a general objection not just
 
04:59:37.070 --> 04:59:37.080 align:start position:0%
specific to this bill all right uh but I
 
04:59:39.750 --> 04:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
want to ask a question or two about on
 
04:59:43.030 --> 04:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
page three the return of inv on
 
04:59:45.868 --> 04:59:45.878 align:start position:0%
investment section that the institution
 
04:59:50.510 --> 04:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
shall be required to estimate the median
 
04:59:55.150 --> 04:59:55.160 align:start position:0%
salary outcomes of some college student
 
04:59:58.990 --> 04:59:59.000 align:start position:0%
who comes in not knowing what he or she
 
05:00:01.788 --> 05:00:01.798 align:start position:0%
wants to do perhaps doesn't even know
 
05:00:04.590 --> 05:00:04.600 align:start position:0%
what their major will be and yet the
 
05:00:07.708 --> 05:00:07.718 align:start position:0%
school will be responsible for in
 
05:00:10.548 --> 05:00:10.558 align:start position:0%
writing estimating the median salary
 
05:00:14.590 --> 05:00:14.600 align:start position:0%
over time and then further the school
 
05:00:19.070 --> 05:00:19.080 align:start position:0%
would be required to uh indicate by
 
05:00:21.990 --> 05:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
example the characteristics of students
 
05:00:25.350 --> 05:00:25.360 align:start position:0%
who should be expected to earn more or
 
05:00:29.670 --> 05:00:29.680 align:start position:0%
earn less more or less uh and I think of
 
05:00:31.990 --> 05:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
um when I went to law school and the
 
05:00:34.788 --> 05:00:34.798 align:start position:0%
particular law school that I went to uh
 
05:00:38.150 --> 05:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
graduated a number of graduates uh to
 
05:00:41.110 --> 05:00:41.120 align:start position:0%
very high-end law firms and graduated
 
05:00:43.990 --> 05:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
probably an equal number to teaching
 
05:00:49.030 --> 05:00:49.040 align:start position:0%
profession and um I don't know how a
 
05:00:51.390 --> 05:00:51.400 align:start position:0%
school law school or otherwise I'm just
 
05:00:54.628 --> 05:00:54.638 align:start position:0%
using that as an example um would be
 
05:00:57.190 --> 05:00:57.200 align:start position:0%
able to
 
05:01:01.628 --> 05:01:01.638 align:start position:0%
predict for who would be more successful
 
05:01:05.230 --> 05:01:05.240 align:start position:0%
at the beginning in earning this amount
 
05:01:07.948 --> 05:01:07.958 align:start position:0%
of money versus earning that amount of
 
05:01:11.628 --> 05:01:11.638 align:start position:0%
money and then provide
 
05:01:15.948 --> 05:01:15.958 align:start position:0%
objective guidance to which kind of
 
05:01:18.670 --> 05:01:18.680 align:start position:0%
student will do better in teaching and
 
05:01:20.628 --> 05:01:20.638 align:start position:0%
which will do better in a high-end law
 
05:01:23.548 --> 05:01:23.558 align:start position:0%
firm and I just think this is a trap for
 
05:01:27.230 --> 05:01:27.240 align:start position:0%
universities and colleges and an open
 
05:01:30.548 --> 05:01:30.558 align:start position:0%
invitation for lawsuit after lawsuit
 
05:01:32.390 --> 05:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
from individuals have nothing better to
 
05:01:35.948 --> 05:01:35.958 align:start position:0%
do than try their luck at getting 50% of
 
05:01:40.750 --> 05:01:40.760 align:start position:0%
their uh educational money back at un
 
05:01:43.910 --> 05:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
at open-ended cost to the taxpayers so
 
05:01:47.150 --> 05:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
do you have a thought about
 
05:01:49.868 --> 05:01:49.878 align:start position:0%
that representative McFarland thank you
 
05:01:51.628 --> 05:01:51.638 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh to representative
 
05:01:54.030 --> 05:01:54.040 align:start position:0%
Horgan's points and I do have the same
 
05:01:55.590 --> 05:01:55.600 align:start position:0%
copy of the University system of New
 
05:01:57.150 --> 05:01:57.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's comments on the original
 
05:02:00.230 --> 05:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
Bill uh in front of me I I would say
 
05:02:05.070 --> 05:02:05.080 align:start position:0%
first of all that the fge uh act then
 
05:02:07.548 --> 05:02:07.558 align:start position:0%
and the work that the IRS is doing and
 
05:02:10.150 --> 05:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
that the US Department of Education is
 
05:02:13.070 --> 05:02:13.080 align:start position:0%
doing um does go some way in this
 
05:02:15.030 --> 05:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
direction and you bring up a very good
 
05:02:18.150 --> 05:02:18.160 align:start position:0%
point that if we have an expectation
 
05:02:19.510 --> 05:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
that some of those
 
05:02:23.830 --> 05:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
institutions uh may be reduced in size
 
05:02:26.548 --> 05:02:26.558 align:start position:0%
and scope um then it's all the more
 
05:02:29.390 --> 05:02:29.400 align:start position:0%
reason why we should be wishing to pass
 
05:02:33.030 --> 05:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
this bill um and the the other point
 
05:02:36.590 --> 05:02:36.600 align:start position:0%
that I would make um I I won't go back
 
05:02:38.788 --> 05:02:38.798 align:start position:0%
into the the conversation about what
 
05:02:40.350 --> 05:02:40.360 align:start position:0%
types of degree
 
05:02:42.830 --> 05:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
um but I will say that to the the point
 
05:02:45.788 --> 05:02:45.798 align:start position:0%
that you raised around the availability
 
05:02:49.430 --> 05:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
of uh some of this data um that is
 
05:02:53.910 --> 05:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
called for uh I've actually included a
 
05:02:55.830 --> 05:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
clause that
 
05:02:59.270 --> 05:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
provides where data is unavailable um
 
05:03:03.868 --> 05:03:03.878 align:start position:0%
that that does not uh stop them from
 
05:03:06.788 --> 05:03:06.798 align:start position:0%
fulfilling the the terms of of the the
 
05:03:09.350 --> 05:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
required data here as long as they uh
 
05:03:12.390 --> 05:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
disclose that fact um to representative
 
05:03:14.230 --> 05:03:14.240 align:start position:0%
Toro's point about whether it's Jermaine
 
05:03:17.750 --> 05:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
or not I will say that I was at pains to
 
05:03:20.430 --> 05:03:20.440 align:start position:0%
ensure that it is Jermain precisely by
 
05:03:24.030 --> 05:03:24.040 align:start position:0%
uh sticking only to the uh the precise
 
05:03:26.230 --> 05:03:26.240 align:start position:0%
structure and topics of the original
 
05:03:28.628 --> 05:03:28.638 align:start position:0%
bill um and I defer to the chairman as
 
05:03:31.510 --> 05:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
to whether we need to get into a debate
 
05:03:35.030 --> 05:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
on that um and finally uh I would answer
 
05:03:38.788 --> 05:03:38.798 align:start position:0%
representative Burch by observing that
 
05:03:40.990 --> 05:03:41.000 align:start position:0%
um while we can have a prolonged debate
 
05:03:43.150 --> 05:03:43.160 align:start position:0%
over the points you bring up at the end
 
05:03:46.190 --> 05:03:46.200 align:start position:0%
of the day uh there is no incumbency on
 
05:03:49.270 --> 05:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
these educational institutions to spend
 
05:03:52.830 --> 05:03:52.840 align:start position:0%
any money at all on this um they can
 
05:03:55.270 --> 05:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
simply choose to have the the
 
05:03:57.548 --> 05:03:57.558 align:start position:0%
matriculating students sign off on the
 
05:03:59.910 --> 05:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
disclosure statement uh on on the
 
05:04:02.548 --> 05:04:02.558 align:start position:0%
disclaimer statement um on the other
 
05:04:05.750 --> 05:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
hand uh some of those institutions May
 
05:04:08.590 --> 05:04:08.600 align:start position:0%
view this as an excellent competitive
 
05:04:10.750 --> 05:04:10.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity uh to put their best foot
 
05:04:13.430 --> 05:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
forward and provide information and you
 
05:04:16.110 --> 05:04:16.120 align:start position:0%
ask about return on investment and I say
 
05:04:19.430 --> 05:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
to you that um the the information that
 
05:04:23.110 --> 05:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
is asked for there is not to look into a
 
05:04:25.990 --> 05:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
crystal ball it is to look at hard facts
 
05:04:28.628 --> 05:04:28.638 align:start position:0%
and statistics and provide indication as
 
05:04:32.110 --> 05:04:32.120 align:start position:0%
to median outcomes and typical details
 
05:04:35.190 --> 05:04:35.200 align:start position:0%
um so if they feel that they can do that
 
05:04:37.548 --> 05:04:37.558 align:start position:0%
great and if they don't they can just
 
05:04:40.190 --> 05:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
have them sign off on a piece of paper
 
05:04:43.430 --> 05:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
all right um anyone
 
05:04:48.990 --> 05:04:49.000 align:start position:0%
else wh yes uh thank you Mr chair um so
 
05:04:51.190 --> 05:04:51.200 align:start position:0%
um I have a couple questions surrounding
 
05:04:55.350 --> 05:04:55.360 align:start position:0%
this uh return on investment as well um
 
05:04:58.510 --> 05:04:58.520 align:start position:0%
it just seems unclear to me how um any
 
05:05:00.430 --> 05:05:00.440 align:start position:0%
kind of educational institution is going
 
05:05:04.110 --> 05:05:04.120 align:start position:0%
to be able to um give a clear picture of
 
05:05:05.910 --> 05:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
return on investment when there's so
 
05:05:07.708 --> 05:05:07.718 align:start position:0%
many outstanding questions that they
 
05:05:11.230 --> 05:05:11.240 align:start position:0%
don't know for instance um I I went to
 
05:05:13.830 --> 05:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
school in Pennsylvania but here I am in
 
05:05:17.788 --> 05:05:17.798 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so you know where I live
 
05:05:21.948 --> 05:05:21.958 align:start position:0%
then affects how much money I am uh
 
05:05:25.430 --> 05:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
going to be paid um I was a teacher um
 
05:05:27.350 --> 05:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
it it also doesn't take into
 
05:05:29.670 --> 05:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
consideration whether you're working in
 
05:05:31.548 --> 05:05:31.558 align:start position:0%
Private Industry or public industry
 
05:05:33.990 --> 05:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
one's usually paid more than the other
 
05:05:37.470 --> 05:05:37.480 align:start position:0%
and um as as far as the disclaimer goes
 
05:05:39.830 --> 05:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
if that's the answer to everything will
 
05:05:42.390 --> 05:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
then just sign the disclaimer then I'm
 
05:05:45.230 --> 05:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
curious as to why we need the bill um
 
05:05:47.750 --> 05:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
not to mention that it's four pages long
 
05:05:52.430 --> 05:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
and I don't read that quickly legal e so
 
05:05:54.190 --> 05:05:54.200 align:start position:0%
all right any other anyone else wish
 
05:05:56.150 --> 05:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
should be heard representative pno I
 
05:05:57.470 --> 05:05:57.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I would just like
 
05:06:01.190 --> 05:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
to make a quick point that on on line 27
 
05:06:03.070 --> 05:06:03.080 align:start position:0%
on page on the first page of the
 
05:06:06.990 --> 05:06:07.000 align:start position:0%
amendment and on line 16 on the first
 
05:06:09.110 --> 05:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
page of the underlying Bill any
 
05:06:11.708 --> 05:06:11.718 align:start position:0%
education institution seems to imply
 
05:06:14.270 --> 05:06:14.280 align:start position:0%
public or private institutions and I
 
05:06:15.990 --> 05:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
don't believe we have any jurisdiction
 
05:06:18.430 --> 05:06:18.440 align:start position:0%
or authority over private institutions
 
05:06:20.670 --> 05:06:20.680 align:start position:0%
of Higher Learning so to begin with we
 
05:06:23.070 --> 05:06:23.080 align:start position:0%
would have to amend
 
05:06:26.150 --> 05:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
that all right um anyone else wish to be
 
05:06:28.390 --> 05:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
heard so I guess I just the only comment
 
05:06:30.350 --> 05:06:30.360 align:start position:0%
I would make is I I'm representing mcfar
 
05:06:34.030 --> 05:06:34.040 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm very sympathetic to what you're
 
05:06:38.990 --> 05:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
trying to get at I really am but um I I
 
05:06:42.270 --> 05:06:42.280 align:start position:0%
guess I I you know
 
05:06:45.548 --> 05:06:45.558 align:start position:0%
I from my general philosophical
 
05:06:49.670 --> 05:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
perspective I I do I do still think that
 
05:06:52.310 --> 05:06:52.320 align:start position:0%
the do you know the doctrine of cavat
 
05:06:55.708 --> 05:06:55.718 align:start position:0%
emper uh means something and I'm really
 
05:06:59.270 --> 05:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:02.110 --> 05:07:02.120 align:start position:0%
is to at least to some extent it's
 
05:07:04.150 --> 05:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
there's there's a certain Nanny State
 
05:07:08.470 --> 05:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
feel to this that I just don't um I I
 
05:07:11.470 --> 05:07:11.480 align:start position:0%
can't go along with so um although I'm I
 
05:07:12.548 --> 05:07:12.558 align:start position:0%
understand what you're trying to get at
 
05:07:14.750 --> 05:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
I'm sympathetic to some of the things
 
05:07:19.510 --> 05:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
that what uh sort of outrageous charges
 
05:07:21.670 --> 05:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
that some schools are making I'm I I
 
05:07:23.670 --> 05:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
cannot for those reasons I cannot
 
05:07:25.510 --> 05:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
support the amendment anyone else wish
 
05:07:28.670 --> 05:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
to be heard on the amendment all right
 
05:07:32.510 --> 05:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
so um anybody I would propose to have a
 
05:07:35.470 --> 05:07:35.480 align:start position:0%
raise of hand it's on the amendment um
 
05:07:38.590 --> 05:07:38.600 align:start position:0%
unless anybody objects to that all right
 
05:07:39.990 --> 05:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
I've seeing no OB
 
05:07:44.590 --> 05:07:44.600 align:start position:0%
so I say all those in favor of uh uh
 
05:07:47.150 --> 05:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
representative McFarland's Amendment
 
05:07:51.030 --> 05:07:51.040 align:start position:0%
which is number 20250
 
05:07:55.868 --> 05:07:55.878 align:start position:0%

um the uh
 
05:14:37.270 --> 05:14:37.280 align:start position:0%

that also related to 195 because I want
 
05:15:36.070 --> 05:15:36.080 align:start position:0%
to make sure no that's 522 okay all
 
05:15:39.150 --> 05:15:39.160 align:start position:0%

05:15:44.628 --> 05:15:44.638 align:start position:0%
o is the amendment to um House Bill 195
 
05:15:46.910 --> 05:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
um and it makes uh it
 
05:15:50.310 --> 05:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
makes um a few changes in the in
 
05:15:54.070 --> 05:15:54.080 align:start position:0%
language that were um discussed uh at
 
05:15:56.548 --> 05:15:56.558 align:start position:0%
the hearing and and some discussions
 
05:15:58.708 --> 05:15:58.718 align:start position:0%
after the hearing
 
05:16:04.670 --> 05:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
um uh for example I um it adds on on
 
05:16:04.680 --> 05:16:05.830 align:start position:0%
um uh for example I um it adds on on
page

05:16:05.830 --> 05:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
page
 
05:16:09.670 --> 05:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
one of the amendment on line 28
 
05:16:12.788 --> 05:16:12.798 align:start position:0%
it adds the language unless specifically
 
05:16:15.868 --> 05:16:15.878 align:start position:0%
authorized by law um I believe that that
 
05:16:18.708 --> 05:16:18.718 align:start position:0%
were one of the people that um either
 
05:16:20.590 --> 05:16:20.600 align:start position:0%
testified at the hearing or spoke with
 
05:16:22.230 --> 05:16:22.240 align:start position:0%
us or me afterwards said that that
 
05:16:25.910 --> 05:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
language was was important to um for
 
05:16:27.390 --> 05:16:27.400 align:start position:0%
their interest to make sure that if
 
05:16:29.110 --> 05:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
there were other was another
 
05:16:30.910 --> 05:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
authorization uh another law that
 
05:16:34.070 --> 05:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
authorized something would be all right
 
05:16:37.150 --> 05:16:37.160 align:start position:0%
um uh the let
 
05:16:42.150 --> 05:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
me um on page two on line 8 there is a
 
05:16:45.750 --> 05:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
new subdivision e added as another sort
 
05:16:47.430 --> 05:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
of exception and that was again
 
05:16:49.708 --> 05:16:49.718 align:start position:0%
suggested by former representative Kirk
 
05:16:51.910 --> 05:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
I think a very good suggestion it said
 
05:16:54.470 --> 05:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
look it basically he basically said look
 
05:16:56.868 --> 05:16:56.878 align:start position:0%
there may be sometimes when when a
 
05:16:58.628 --> 05:16:58.638 align:start position:0%
third-party provider of information or
 
05:17:00.708 --> 05:17:00.718 align:start position:0%
Services needs to make some disclosure
 
05:17:03.150 --> 05:17:03.160 align:start position:0%
to another entity I guess for example
 
05:17:04.990 --> 05:17:05.000 align:start position:0%
might be a credit card company or
 
05:17:06.548 --> 05:17:06.558 align:start position:0%
something in order to provide the
 
05:17:09.150 --> 05:17:09.160 align:start position:0%
service that the person has asked for
 
05:17:15.708 --> 05:17:15.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:21.070 --> 05:17:21.080 align:start position:0%
uh see let me see if there's any the
 
05:17:24.548 --> 05:17:24.558 align:start position:0%
um the oh the the language I'm I'm going
 
05:17:28.150 --> 05:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
to turn then to page three and you'll
 
05:17:33.750 --> 05:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
see that there is
 
05:17:39.030 --> 05:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
um I changed the language um in both
 
05:17:41.110 --> 05:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral
 
05:17:46.070 --> 05:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
2 uh and I'll specifically refer you to
 
05:17:51.150 --> 05:17:51.160 align:start position:0%
lines U 8 through 11 the Lang the Lang
 
05:17:52.510 --> 05:17:52.520 align:start position:0%
you'll see that the language now reads
 
05:17:54.470 --> 05:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
provided however that no such notice
 
05:17:57.070 --> 05:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
shall be given if the government entity
 
05:17:59.030 --> 05:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
seeking the information requests that
 
05:18:01.270 --> 05:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
such notice not be provided and
 
05:18:04.230 --> 05:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
demonstrates good cause for making such
 
05:18:06.470 --> 05:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
request um or a court has issued an
 
05:18:09.590 --> 05:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
order that such notice not be given uh
 
05:18:12.948 --> 05:18:12.958 align:start position:0%
and I think that's um it just seems that
 
05:18:16.270 --> 05:18:16.280 align:start position:0%
that that that language made more sense
 
05:18:20.628 --> 05:18:20.638 align:start position:0%
um uh that that even if a the way it was
 
05:18:23.390 --> 05:18:23.400 align:start position:0%
worded before arguably could be read
 
05:18:25.590 --> 05:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
that unless there was a statute or
 
05:18:29.590 --> 05:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
something like that that allowed the uh
 
05:18:32.788 --> 05:18:32.798 align:start position:0%
the another statute that would mean that
 
05:18:35.070 --> 05:18:35.080 align:start position:0%
allowed um the government
 
05:18:35.080 --> 05:18:37.030 align:start position:0%
allowed um the government
agency

05:18:37.030 --> 05:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
agency
 
05:18:40.910 --> 05:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
uh to to to require that a respondent
 
05:18:44.110 --> 05:18:44.120 align:start position:0%
not disclose disclose information then
 
05:18:45.868 --> 05:18:45.878 align:start position:0%
they couldn't do it it seems to me that
 
05:18:48.510 --> 05:18:48.520 align:start position:0%
this it makes more sense to say that
 
05:18:50.030 --> 05:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
they have to demonstrate good cause and
 
05:18:51.510 --> 05:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
if they can't demonstrate good cause
 
05:18:54.548 --> 05:18:54.558 align:start position:0%
then they then the the the provider will
 
05:18:57.230 --> 05:18:57.240 align:start position:0%
uh will notify whoever is the subject of
 
05:19:00.230 --> 05:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
the subpoena and the same thing applies
 
05:19:04.910 --> 05:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
in in uh line uh in Roman numeral 3 at
 
05:19:04.920 --> 05:19:07.590 align:start position:0%
in in uh line uh in Roman numeral 3 at
lines

05:19:07.590 --> 05:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
lines
 
05:19:12.750 --> 05:19:12.760 align:start position:0%
16-9 uh um the uh let see if there's any
 
05:19:17.990 --> 05:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:21.070 --> 05:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
um uh no I think that's I think that's
 
05:19:23.830 --> 05:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
really it I and I I guess I would say I
 
05:19:25.948 --> 05:19:25.958 align:start position:0%
don't I mean I think the changes that
 
05:19:27.390 --> 05:19:27.400 align:start position:0%
were made are I don't want to
 
05:19:28.670 --> 05:19:28.680 align:start position:0%
characterize them as not being
 
05:19:30.548 --> 05:19:30.558 align:start position:0%
substantive I think they are to to the
 
05:19:33.070 --> 05:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
extent I've sort of mentioned it but in
 
05:19:35.590 --> 05:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
terms of you know do any of them make a
 
05:19:38.230 --> 05:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
major change to the bill I don't think
 
05:19:41.750 --> 05:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
they do and I think the bill still makes
 
05:19:44.110 --> 05:19:44.120 align:start position:0%
um great sense for the same reason it
 
05:19:48.390 --> 05:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
made sense last year uh oh I'm sorry one
 
05:19:51.548 --> 05:19:51.558 align:start position:0%
most important thing I was um in
 
05:19:55.150 --> 05:19:55.160 align:start position:0%
paragraph in uh on page one lines 8 and
 
05:19:58.470 --> 05:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
10 8 through 10 the definition of
 
05:20:01.670 --> 05:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
available to the public is
 
05:20:05.830 --> 05:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
changed to um to read available to the
 
05:20:07.788 --> 05:20:07.798 align:start position:0%
public which means means personal
 
05:20:09.510 --> 05:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
information about an individual which is
 
05:20:11.670 --> 05:20:11.680 align:start position:0%
widely known or readily accessible to
 
05:20:13.788 --> 05:20:13.798 align:start position:0%
the public and in which an individual
 
05:20:15.510 --> 05:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
could not have a reasonable expectation
 
05:20:19.628 --> 05:20:19.638 align:start position:0%
of privacy that I think that if you read
 
05:20:23.190 --> 05:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
the language of the original bill it
 
05:20:31.350 --> 05:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:36.990 --> 05:20:37.000 align:start position:0%
um Much More Much vager and didn't um
 
05:20:40.750 --> 05:20:40.760 align:start position:0%
uh didn't sort of capture what I think
 
05:20:43.948 --> 05:20:43.958 align:start position:0%
the case law and I think constitutional
 
05:20:46.230 --> 05:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
Provisions would say is what an
 
05:20:48.750 --> 05:20:48.760 align:start position:0%
expectation of privacy is so I think
 
05:20:52.830 --> 05:20:52.840 align:start position:0%
that uh makes subsection one
 
05:20:57.310 --> 05:20:57.320 align:start position:0%
uh much just much better so for those
 
05:21:00.230 --> 05:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
reasons I um I think this bill makes
 
05:21:04.430 --> 05:21:04.440 align:start position:0%
sense as um as we said last year it adds
 
05:21:08.708 --> 05:21:08.718 align:start position:0%
to the to 255 by Pro providing a greater
 
05:21:11.948 --> 05:21:11.958 align:start position:0%
level of protection in particular it has
 
05:21:14.190 --> 05:21:14.200 align:start position:0%
the opt-in provision that says if you
 
05:21:16.670 --> 05:21:16.680 align:start position:0%
are one of the covered third party
 
05:21:19.190 --> 05:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
providers of information and services
 
05:21:22.910 --> 05:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
and you want to get a consumer like us
 
05:21:27.270 --> 05:21:27.280 align:start position:0%
to consent it has to be in a a specific
 
05:21:29.510 --> 05:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
thing that uh a specific request it
 
05:21:31.750 --> 05:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
can't be you know along with a bunch of
 
05:21:34.670 --> 05:21:34.680 align:start position:0%
other stuff and you have to be you have
 
05:21:38.190 --> 05:21:38.200 align:start position:0%
to specifically make a an affirmative uh
 
05:21:40.590 --> 05:21:40.600 align:start position:0%
Act of consent uh so it can be done
 
05:21:43.070 --> 05:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
online but it has to be you know
 
05:21:45.230 --> 05:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
separate are you consenting to this
 
05:21:47.110 --> 05:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
disclosure and you have to affirmatively
 
05:21:50.310 --> 05:21:50.320 align:start position:0%
say yes I think it makes a lot of sense
 
05:21:52.948 --> 05:21:52.958 align:start position:0%
um and I hope you'll support it anyone
 
05:21:54.628 --> 05:21:54.638 align:start position:0%
else wish to be
 
05:21:57.390 --> 05:21:57.400 align:start position:0%
heard yes representative McFarland thank
 
05:21:59.830 --> 05:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um so I I very much
 
05:22:01.628 --> 05:22:01.638 align:start position:0%
appreciate some of the work that's been
 
05:22:03.590 --> 05:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
done in this amendment I mean including
 
05:22:06.030 --> 05:22:06.040 align:start position:0%
the the item on page one that you were
 
05:22:07.750 --> 05:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
alluding to that I think is responsive
 
05:22:09.070 --> 05:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
to some of a
 
05:22:13.150 --> 05:22:13.160 align:start position:0%
conversations um I I want to be in a
 
05:22:16.390 --> 05:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
position to vote for the amended bill
 
05:22:18.708 --> 05:22:18.718 align:start position:0%
and I unfortunately still have
 
05:22:20.548 --> 05:22:20.558 align:start position:0%
significant concerns over the amendment
 
05:22:23.628 --> 05:22:23.638 align:start position:0%
as written and and maybe I am missing
 
05:22:26.750 --> 05:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
some facts here so I'll just throw out a
 
05:22:29.830 --> 05:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
couple of of comments on the amendment
 
05:22:33.628 --> 05:22:33.638 align:start position:0%
the first is with regard to page two um
 
05:22:37.150 --> 05:22:37.160 align:start position:0%
line two it uses the word
 
05:22:39.070 --> 05:22:39.080 align:start position:0%
necessary and
 
05:22:42.070 --> 05:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
I would suggest that it ought to say
 
05:22:44.548 --> 05:22:44.558 align:start position:0%
something more like appropriate because
 
05:22:46.868 --> 05:22:46.878 align:start position:0%
there are going to be circumstances
 
05:22:51.868 --> 05:22:51.878 align:start position:0%
where um the the third party provider is
 
05:22:58.510 --> 05:22:58.520 align:start position:0%
um desirous of of uh using um other
 
05:23:00.868 --> 05:23:00.878 align:start position:0%
service providers and and vendors and
 
05:23:00.878 --> 05:23:01.708 align:start position:0%
service providers and and vendors and
and

05:23:01.708 --> 05:23:01.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:23:04.590 --> 05:23:04.600 align:start position:0%
subcontractors uh but an argument can be
 
05:23:06.868 --> 05:23:06.878 align:start position:0%
made very cleanly that it is not
 
05:23:08.948 --> 05:23:08.958 align:start position:0%
necessary and I think that brings me to
 
05:23:11.910 --> 05:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
the next point which is that in general
 
05:23:15.708 --> 05:23:15.718 align:start position:0%
um I don't see in here any language that
 
05:23:18.110 --> 05:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
permits the third party provider of
 
05:23:19.270 --> 05:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
information and
 
05:23:23.470 --> 05:23:23.480 align:start position:0%
services uh to routinely use these other
 
05:23:24.948 --> 05:23:24.958 align:start position:0%
vendors and subcontractors and I know
 
05:23:28.948 --> 05:23:28.958 align:start position:0%
you made reference to the um paragraph e
 
05:23:31.350 --> 05:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
the information is disclosed in order to
 
05:23:33.150 --> 05:23:33.160 align:start position:0%
provide the services and and I think
 
05:23:37.670 --> 05:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
that one arguably would Encompass some
 
05:23:37.680 --> 05:23:39.270 align:start position:0%
that one arguably would Encompass some
subcontractors

05:23:39.270 --> 05:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
subcontractors
 
05:23:42.910 --> 05:23:42.920 align:start position:0%
uh but only to the narrow extent that
 
05:23:46.510 --> 05:23:46.520 align:start position:0%
that is um aligned with and necessary to
 
05:23:48.990 --> 05:23:49.000 align:start position:0%
provide the service and is not something
 
05:23:52.430 --> 05:23:52.440 align:start position:0%
that is ancillary to um the the
 
05:23:53.750 --> 05:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
provision of the service but but
 
05:23:55.670 --> 05:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
nevertheless part of the routine
 
05:23:58.830 --> 05:23:58.840 align:start position:0%
operations of the the third party and so
 
05:24:00.350 --> 05:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
um if I'm missing something there I
 
05:24:02.390 --> 05:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
would be grateful to hear about it I
 
05:24:04.590 --> 05:24:04.600 align:start position:0%
think the next thing I would bring up is
 
05:24:09.470 --> 05:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
that in line again page two line 24
 
05:24:12.270 --> 05:24:12.280 align:start position:0%
425 um the ability
 
05:24:16.150 --> 05:24:16.160 align:start position:0%
to uh provide information to those
 
05:24:16.160 --> 05:24:17.510 align:start position:0%
to uh provide information to those
government

05:24:17.510 --> 05:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
government
 
05:24:20.590 --> 05:24:20.600 align:start position:0%
entities is conditioned on the
 
05:24:23.110 --> 05:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
government entities requesting them but
 
05:24:26.470 --> 05:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
it's not clear uh how the third party
 
05:24:29.868 --> 05:24:29.878 align:start position:0%
could voluntarily seek to provide
 
05:24:32.110 --> 05:24:32.120 align:start position:0%
information uh which again is something
 
05:24:35.990 --> 05:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
that I think is a a matter of routine uh
 
05:24:38.750 --> 05:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
operations especially for the the same
 
05:24:41.390 --> 05:24:41.400 align:start position:0%
kind of reasons as are laid out on on
 
05:24:44.948 --> 05:24:44.958 align:start position:0%
lines 1 to three without rising to
 
05:24:47.708 --> 05:24:47.718 align:start position:0%
actually reporting a crime or having any
 
05:24:50.750 --> 05:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
any reason such as that to uh to to to
 
05:24:53.910 --> 05:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
come back to them so um if I'm missing
 
05:24:55.948 --> 05:24:55.958 align:start position:0%
some language in here Mr chairman I
 
05:24:58.628 --> 05:24:58.638 align:start position:0%
would be happy to hear about it so I I
 
05:25:02.070 --> 05:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
guess what I would respond I I I I I
 
05:25:04.990 --> 05:25:05.000 align:start position:0%
don't think that my inclination from
 
05:25:06.390 --> 05:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
what you said is I don't think you are
 
05:25:08.548 --> 05:25:08.558 align:start position:0%
missing anything but I think that that
 
05:25:10.110 --> 05:25:10.120 align:start position:0%
other words you you know just to give
 
05:25:13.390 --> 05:25:13.400 align:start position:0%
you you gave the example of um well
 
05:25:16.310 --> 05:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
subsection e on page two allows the
 
05:25:18.510 --> 05:25:18.520 align:start position:0%
information to be disclosed in order to
 
05:25:22.390 --> 05:25:22.400 align:start position:0%
uh to another uh in order to provide the
 
05:25:23.708 --> 05:25:23.718 align:start position:0%
service that the individual has
 
05:25:27.190 --> 05:25:27.200 align:start position:0%
requested and you suggested well what if
 
05:25:30.948 --> 05:25:30.958 align:start position:0%
the business's routine is to disclose
 
05:25:34.548 --> 05:25:34.558 align:start position:0%
information to another another business
 
05:25:36.830 --> 05:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
not necessarily to provide the service
 
05:25:39.310 --> 05:25:39.320 align:start position:0%
but just because it's kind of anelar and
 
05:25:40.948 --> 05:25:40.958 align:start position:0%
we've always done that and I and I guess
 
05:25:43.470 --> 05:25:43.480 align:start position:0%
my response to that would be I think I
 
05:25:46.390 --> 05:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
me you know that that is one of the
 
05:25:48.350 --> 05:25:48.360 align:start position:0%
things that this is designed to stop it
 
05:25:51.270 --> 05:25:51.280 align:start position:0%
I think it if you read the
 
05:25:53.628 --> 05:25:53.638 align:start position:0%
exceptions I think they're designed to
 
05:25:56.590 --> 05:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
say look a business should be able to do
 
05:25:57.788 --> 05:25:57.798 align:start position:0%
all of the
 
05:26:00.750 --> 05:26:00.760 align:start position:0%
things and and use the personal
 
05:26:03.150 --> 05:26:03.160 align:start position:0%
information of somebody for all of the
 
05:26:04.868 --> 05:26:04.878 align:start position:0%
reasons that I think all of us would say
 
05:26:07.548 --> 05:26:07.558 align:start position:0%
is legitimate to provide you know if the
 
05:26:09.110 --> 05:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
if the credit card company needs to have
 
05:26:10.868 --> 05:26:10.878 align:start position:0%
my personal information so that when I
 
05:26:13.190 --> 05:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
buy something from Amazon they can I can
 
05:26:15.670 --> 05:26:15.680 align:start position:0%
they can allow me to pay for it sure
 
05:26:18.628 --> 05:26:18.638 align:start position:0%
Amazon should be able to do that um but
 
05:26:21.750 --> 05:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
if it's if it's not for that purpose if
 
05:26:25.590 --> 05:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
it really is you know they they don't
 
05:26:27.350 --> 05:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
have to do that they but they do it
 
05:26:30.110 --> 05:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
because for some other other reason
 
05:26:31.990 --> 05:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
that's really not reasonably necessary
 
05:26:33.868 --> 05:26:33.878 align:start position:0%
to their business then that that is what
 
05:26:35.708 --> 05:26:35.718 align:start position:0%
this is designed to stop it's designed
 
05:26:38.628 --> 05:26:38.638 align:start position:0%
to say look businesses if you you've got
 
05:26:41.230 --> 05:26:41.240 align:start position:0%
this kind of personal information fine
 
05:26:43.948 --> 05:26:43.958 align:start position:0%
it's why it's fine to use it for things
 
05:26:47.390 --> 05:26:47.400 align:start position:0%
that are related to uh your business or
 
05:26:52.270 --> 05:26:52.280 align:start position:0%
for other reasons when um um you're uh
 
05:26:54.110 --> 05:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
you know there's a legitimate reason but
 
05:26:58.110 --> 05:26:58.120 align:start position:0%
not for just you can't be sort of sloppy
 
05:27:00.548 --> 05:27:00.558 align:start position:0%
with uh with it and I think that's you
 
05:27:02.390 --> 05:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
know that's kind of what this bill was
 
05:27:04.910 --> 05:27:04.920 align:start position:0%
all designed to prevent yeah and and I
 
05:27:07.310 --> 05:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
think you know as a privacy Advocate I I
 
05:27:09.990 --> 05:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
certainly um amendable to that sentiment
 
05:27:12.350 --> 05:27:12.360 align:start position:0%
in general in fact you know and I didn't
 
05:27:14.070 --> 05:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
make a comment about it but your comment
 
05:27:16.670 --> 05:27:16.680 align:start position:0%
on page three about the the language in
 
05:27:20.868 --> 05:27:20.878 align:start position:0%
8910 I mean I um frankly I I I think
 
05:27:23.788 --> 05:27:23.798 align:start position:0%
that we should be asking these companies
 
05:27:28.628 --> 05:27:28.638 align:start position:0%
only to uh not disclose uh when they're
 
05:27:31.150 --> 05:27:31.160 align:start position:0%
receiving you know a request uh that's
 
05:27:33.750 --> 05:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
targeted an individuals information when
 
05:27:37.350 --> 05:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
there is um you know a a court uh uh
 
05:27:39.670 --> 05:27:39.680 align:start position:0%
order and and a requirement to keep it
 
05:27:42.590 --> 05:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
confidential I'm I'm troubled by the the
 
05:27:45.070 --> 05:27:45.080 align:start position:0%
the the option A on on line 9 on page
 
05:27:47.350 --> 05:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
three but but back to the point on page
 
05:27:51.190 --> 05:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
two I think what I'm saying is not about
 
05:27:53.868 --> 05:27:53.878 align:start position:0%
frivolous types of act on the side or
 
05:27:56.510 --> 05:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
acts that are maybe related to you know
 
05:27:58.590 --> 05:27:58.600 align:start position:0%
marketing or something else that we're
 
05:28:02.548 --> 05:28:02.558 align:start position:0%
trying to stop um but but I mean I I I
 
05:28:06.110 --> 05:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
guess um without thinking through every
 
05:28:09.350 --> 05:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
possible circumstance if if the word
 
05:28:11.628 --> 05:28:11.638 align:start position:0%
necessary in in line two was said
 
05:28:15.590 --> 05:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh I I probably could uh um
 
05:28:19.230 --> 05:28:19.240 align:start position:0%
you know get past that well let mean
 
05:28:21.070 --> 05:28:21.080 align:start position:0%
does it help you at all that it says has
 
05:28:23.830 --> 05:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
reason to believe that it's necessary in
 
05:28:26.868 --> 05:28:26.878 align:start position:0%
other words it's not I think the test I
 
05:28:29.708 --> 05:28:29.718 align:start position:0%
I I assume the test under that would be
 
05:28:32.788 --> 05:28:32.798 align:start position:0%
did the did the third party provider act
 
05:28:35.510 --> 05:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
reasonably and thinking it was necessary
 
05:28:38.350 --> 05:28:38.360 align:start position:0%
you know as opposed to sort of
 
05:28:41.510 --> 05:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely was necessary I I would think
 
05:28:43.708 --> 05:28:43.718 align:start position:0%
that you know that that does set a
 
05:28:47.868 --> 05:28:47.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:52.030 --> 05:28:52.040 align:start position:0%
reasonableness other other comments yes
 
05:28:54.390 --> 05:28:54.400 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative bur and again this
 
05:28:57.470 --> 05:28:57.480 align:start position:0%
is more question of
 
05:29:01.350 --> 05:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
clarification uh which arises a bit from
 
05:29:03.708 --> 05:29:03.718 align:start position:0%
what the representative raised the
 
05:29:06.990 --> 05:29:07.000 align:start position:0%
question of turning over information to
 
05:29:10.750 --> 05:29:10.760 align:start position:0%
the government which uh
 
05:29:14.670 --> 05:29:14.680 align:start position:0%
under whatever section that is that he
 
05:29:16.230 --> 05:29:16.240 align:start position:0%
was by
 
05:29:19.948 --> 05:29:19.958 align:start position:0%
request so let's move to which I think
 
05:29:23.430 --> 05:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
is fairly limited I mean if I come AC if
 
05:29:24.910 --> 05:29:24.920 align:start position:0%
I'm a business and I come across
 
05:29:26.110 --> 05:29:26.120 align:start position:0%
something that I think the government
 
05:29:28.868 --> 05:29:28.878 align:start position:0%
should know right I I hopefully won't
 
05:29:30.990 --> 05:29:31.000 align:start position:0%
have to wait for request from no no
 
05:29:32.990 --> 05:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
that's what that's what B on the top of
 
05:29:39.190 --> 05:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
page two is to uh um be be does not on
 
05:29:41.230 --> 05:29:41.240 align:start position:0%
the top of page two is designed to cover
 
05:29:42.948 --> 05:29:42.958 align:start position:0%
the situation where there is no request
 
05:29:45.070 --> 05:29:45.080 align:start position:0%
from the government where the business
 
05:29:47.030 --> 05:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
is acting on its own initiative because
 
05:29:50.708 --> 05:29:50.718 align:start position:0%
it has reason to believe that there's uh
 
05:29:51.948 --> 05:29:51.958 align:start position:0%
you know that there's something wrong
 
05:29:54.230 --> 05:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
going on uh right criminal fraud
 
05:29:57.590 --> 05:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
activity identity theft Etc so using
 
05:30:00.030 --> 05:30:00.040 align:start position:0%
that provision and going over to the
 
05:30:02.990 --> 05:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
next page when a third party provider
 
05:30:05.190 --> 05:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
discloses that information presumably
 
05:30:08.788 --> 05:30:08.798 align:start position:0%
under B I'm wondering how
 
05:30:13.030 --> 05:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
the two time factors uh interplay one on
 
05:30:16.948 --> 05:30:16.958 align:start position:0%
line 15 that says the provider shall
 
05:30:19.470 --> 05:30:19.480 align:start position:0%
promptly uh provide that notice to the
 
05:30:22.190 --> 05:30:22.200 align:start position:0%
individual so hold on to the word
 
05:30:26.190 --> 05:30:26.200 align:start position:0%
promptly unless the government
 
05:30:29.070 --> 05:30:29.080 align:start position:0%
demands that it not be turned over more
 
05:30:33.548 --> 05:30:33.558 align:start position:0%
or less so what is a provider supposed
 
05:30:37.350 --> 05:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
to do when he turns it over and the
 
05:30:39.788 --> 05:30:39.798 align:start position:0%
government person says well that's
 
05:30:41.990 --> 05:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
that's interesting and important uh
 
05:30:44.270 --> 05:30:44.280 align:start position:0%
we'll get back to you so does the
 
05:30:47.230 --> 05:30:47.240 align:start position:0%
provider then ignore the promptly and
 
05:30:49.190 --> 05:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
wait for the government
 
05:30:53.430 --> 05:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
to respond in a day a week or a month or
 
05:30:57.708 --> 05:30:57.718 align:start position:0%
does the provider do promptly and I
 
05:30:59.750 --> 05:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
don't know how can you suggest how those
 
05:31:03.670 --> 05:31:03.680 align:start position:0%
two are reconciled I'm I'm I'm I'm not
 
05:31:06.070 --> 05:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
quite sure I'm following so does the
 
05:31:08.948 --> 05:31:08.958 align:start position:0%
provide the providers turn over the
 
05:31:11.990 --> 05:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
stuff which comes first promptly
 
05:31:13.910 --> 05:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
disclosing it or waiting for the
 
05:31:16.510 --> 05:31:16.520 align:start position:0%
government to to demand that you
 
05:31:22.590 --> 05:31:22.600 align:start position:0%
don't I I think promptly I think B on
 
05:31:26.430 --> 05:31:26.440 align:start position:0%
page two is not is is designed let me
 
05:31:27.788 --> 05:31:27.798 align:start position:0%
hang on one second let me just make sure
 
05:31:32.310 --> 05:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
I've read this correctly one two one
 
05:31:35.150 --> 05:31:35.160 align:start position:0%
yeah I get the B I'm on talking about
 
05:31:38.708 --> 05:31:38.718 align:start position:0%
page three yeah line 15 versus
 
05:31:40.910 --> 05:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
15 okay
 
05:31:40.920 --> 05:31:43.190 align:start position:0%
15 okay
so

05:31:43.190 --> 05:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:31:47.230 --> 05:31:47.240 align:start position:0%
pursuant two1 C
 
05:31:49.990 --> 05:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
disclosure proly have disclosure which
 
05:31:52.470 --> 05:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
Master does not has made disclosure to
 
05:31:56.390 --> 05:31:56.400 align:start position:0%
the individual does the person answer to
 
05:31:56.400 --> 05:31:58.310 align:start position:0%
the individual does the person answer to
first

05:31:58.310 --> 05:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
first
 
05:32:00.910 --> 05:32:00.920 align:start position:0%
uh well no I I mean if the if the
 
05:32:04.910 --> 05:32:04.920 align:start position:0%
provider of information is is providing
 
05:32:07.310 --> 05:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
the information not in response to a
 
05:32:07.320 --> 05:32:08.470 align:start position:0%
the information not in response to a
request

05:32:08.470 --> 05:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
request
 
05:32:13.750 --> 05:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
right but in response to um
 
05:32:16.708 --> 05:32:16.718 align:start position:0%
a you know its own its own suspicion
 
05:32:18.030 --> 05:32:18.040 align:start position:0%
that something's
 
05:32:21.310 --> 05:32:21.320 align:start position:0%
wrong um
 
05:32:23.470 --> 05:32:23.480 align:start position:0%
the the
 
05:32:25.948 --> 05:32:25.958 align:start position:0%
provider the provider would then I I
 
05:32:27.788 --> 05:32:27.798 align:start position:0%
think that the provider would promptly
 
05:32:30.110 --> 05:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
notify the like the credit card holder
 
05:32:32.430 --> 05:32:32.440 align:start position:0%
or whoever it was it's the person I mean
 
05:32:35.030 --> 05:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
it's the person who who has the Privacy
 
05:32:37.628 --> 05:32:37.638 align:start position:0%
interest so disclosing it to that person
 
05:32:40.230 --> 05:32:40.240 align:start position:0%
I don't but suppose it's it's a computer
 
05:32:43.670 --> 05:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
a computer image of a child a bad image
 
05:32:46.590 --> 05:32:46.600 align:start position:0%
of a child on a computer and they notify
 
05:32:49.990 --> 05:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
the government uh properly that there's
 
05:32:53.070 --> 05:32:53.080 align:start position:0%
something wrong here um the government
 
05:32:55.990 --> 05:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
May well
 
05:32:59.470 --> 05:32:59.480 align:start position:0%
want the uh the company holding the
 
05:33:02.670 --> 05:33:02.680 align:start position:0%
computer not to turn over that
 
05:33:04.590 --> 05:33:04.600 align:start position:0%
information hey we to told this to the
 
05:33:06.750 --> 05:33:06.760 align:start position:0%
government right but they're under an
 
05:33:11.510 --> 05:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
obligation to promptly tell the uh the
 
05:33:14.150 --> 05:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
imager what we turned over so which goes
 
05:33:16.230 --> 05:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
first sure so no but I mean wouldn't I I
 
05:33:17.990 --> 05:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
think the the reasonable way to read
 
05:33:21.230 --> 05:33:21.240 align:start position:0%
that would would be would it not if if
 
05:33:24.470 --> 05:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
the company discovers the child image
 
05:33:27.788 --> 05:33:27.798 align:start position:0%
and turns it over to the government
 
05:33:30.990 --> 05:33:31.000 align:start position:0%
right right wouldn't I I mean I would
 
05:33:33.670 --> 05:33:33.680 align:start position:0%
presume that under that that the person
 
05:33:35.110 --> 05:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
turning it over would say to the
 
05:33:36.990 --> 05:33:37.000 align:start position:0%
government we're going to dis we're
 
05:33:40.150 --> 05:33:40.160 align:start position:0%
going to disclose this to you know
 
05:33:42.910 --> 05:33:42.920 align:start position:0%
whoever uh we have to disclose it to
 
05:33:44.990 --> 05:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
under the statute unless there's a re
 
05:33:46.390 --> 05:33:46.400 align:start position:0%
unless you tell us there's a reason not
 
05:33:50.270 --> 05:33:50.280 align:start position:0%
to do that and presumably the the the
 
05:33:51.628 --> 05:33:51.638 align:start position:0%
mean I suppose if they say if the
 
05:33:53.390 --> 05:33:53.400 align:start position:0%
government get an immediate answer if
 
05:33:56.190 --> 05:33:56.200 align:start position:0%
the government said no I mean that they
 
05:33:57.788 --> 05:33:57.798 align:start position:0%
don't get an immediate answer they turn
 
05:33:57.798 --> 05:33:59.030 align:start position:0%
don't get an immediate answer they turn
it

05:33:59.030 --> 05:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:34:01.430 --> 05:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
over I mean I guess I I suppose that's
 
05:34:02.470 --> 05:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
right if they've asked and the
 
05:34:04.310 --> 05:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
government can't give them an immediate
 
05:34:06.310 --> 05:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
answer yeah I think they probably do
 
05:34:10.788 --> 05:34:10.798 align:start position:0%
yeah I I wonder I don't know um if the
 
05:34:12.990 --> 05:34:13.000 align:start position:0%
law school that you went to and the law
 
05:34:15.708 --> 05:34:15.718 align:start position:0%
school that um my colleague
 
05:34:19.270 --> 05:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
representative Burch went to um use the
 
05:34:22.990 --> 05:34:23.000 align:start position:0%
same uh technique for teaching
 
05:34:26.830 --> 05:34:26.840 align:start position:0%
law um but whether it is the Socratic
 
05:34:31.670 --> 05:34:31.680 align:start position:0%
method but my question is is this
 
05:34:34.150 --> 05:34:34.160 align:start position:0%
conversation which is fascinating for
 
05:34:39.150 --> 05:34:39.160 align:start position:0%
all of us thank you going to to make any
 
05:34:43.750 --> 05:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
difference in how anyone votes on this
 
05:34:48.030 --> 05:34:48.040 align:start position:0%
bill and have we perhaps exhausted the
 
05:34:50.510 --> 05:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
pleasure of an intellectual
 
05:34:53.750 --> 05:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
exchange um and we could move on and
 
05:34:56.390 --> 05:34:56.400 align:start position:0%
it's not that I'm going to say we pass
 
05:34:58.948 --> 05:34:58.958 align:start position:0%
this bill it passes the house and we
 
05:35:00.868 --> 05:35:00.878 align:start position:0%
rely on the Senate to fix it because I
 
05:35:03.590 --> 05:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
don't ever rely on the Senate to fix it
 
05:35:07.670 --> 05:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
but I also just wonder if we could move
 
05:35:09.750 --> 05:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
Mo the conversation forward now you you
 
05:35:12.070 --> 05:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
are very kind and I think I I suspect
 
05:35:14.788 --> 05:35:14.798 align:start position:0%
that representative bur and myself have
 
05:35:17.270 --> 05:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
have have kind of gotten into the law
 
05:35:18.948 --> 05:35:18.958 align:start position:0%
school debate I suppose which everybody
 
05:35:21.470 --> 05:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
wants to fall asleep for so I would I
 
05:35:23.548 --> 05:35:23.558 align:start position:0%
have no further comments does anybody
 
05:35:26.708 --> 05:35:26.718 align:start position:0%
else have any comments on uh
 
05:35:26.718 --> 05:35:28.230 align:start position:0%
else have any comments on uh
amendment

05:35:28.230 --> 05:35:28.240 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:35:32.868 --> 05:35:32.878 align:start position:0%
0890 to House Bill 195 if not um I would
 
05:35:35.150 --> 05:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
ask uh can we do this by a show of hands
 
05:35:36.948 --> 05:35:36.958 align:start position:0%
on the amendment or does anybody want a
 
05:35:39.230 --> 05:35:39.240 align:start position:0%

05:35:42.310 --> 05:35:42.320 align:start position:0%

05:36:02.270 --> 05:36:02.280 align:start position:0%

um as the same as last year 195 does not
 
05:41:24.510 --> 05:41:24.520 align:start position:0%
contain a private right of action um
 
05:41:27.190 --> 05:41:27.200 align:start position:0%
it's limited to the the Attorney General
 
05:41:31.990 --> 05:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
enforcing it 522 is directed
 
05:41:35.548 --> 05:41:35.558 align:start position:0%
against the government governmental
 
05:41:38.948 --> 05:41:38.958 align:start position:0%
entities um that
 
05:41:41.510 --> 05:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
receive in private information from
 
05:41:43.430 --> 05:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
third party providers of information and
 
05:41:49.070 --> 05:41:49.080 align:start position:0%
services and it is it U says what th
 
05:41:51.670 --> 05:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
what the th what governmental entities
 
05:41:53.670 --> 05:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
can then do with the
 
05:41:56.270 --> 05:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
information um that they get from
 
05:41:58.230 --> 05:41:58.240 align:start position:0%
thirdparty providers of information and
 
05:42:02.350 --> 05:42:02.360 align:start position:0%
services and this bill is the way it is
 
05:42:05.548 --> 05:42:05.558 align:start position:0%
drafted the the there are two main
 
05:42:08.788 --> 05:42:08.798 align:start position:0%
operative SE uh sections section two
 
05:42:10.468 --> 05:42:10.478 align:start position:0%
which be Roman numeral 2 which begins on
 
05:42:14.510 --> 05:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
line 28 States the the the general broad
 
05:42:16.430 --> 05:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
proposition unless specifically
 
05:42:17.910 --> 05:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
authorized by Statute no government
 
05:42:22.430 --> 05:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
entity shall acquire collect retain or
 
05:42:24.590 --> 05:42:24.600 align:start position:0%
use any personal information of an
 
05:42:26.030 --> 05:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
individual residing in New Hampshire
 
05:42:29.708 --> 05:42:29.718 align:start position:0%
from any third party provider
 
05:42:32.230 --> 05:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
um so you might say if you read that
 
05:42:35.030 --> 05:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
well boy that they third uh government
 
05:42:36.788 --> 05:42:36.798 align:start position:0%
entities can't do very much at if
 
05:42:36.798 --> 05:42:37.628 align:start position:0%
entities can't do very much at if
anything

05:42:37.628 --> 05:42:37.638 align:start position:0%
anything
 
05:42:42.070 --> 05:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
with uh private information but three
 
05:42:45.708 --> 05:42:45.718 align:start position:0%
then sets out what they can do with
 
05:42:45.718 --> 05:42:46.670 align:start position:0%
then sets out what they can do with
private

05:42:46.670 --> 05:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
private
 
05:42:48.868 --> 05:42:48.878 align:start position:0%
information which with information
 
05:42:50.430 --> 05:42:50.440 align:start position:0%
obtained from third party providers and
 
05:42:53.510 --> 05:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
if you read through Roman numeral 3
 
05:42:55.590 --> 05:42:55.600 align:start position:0%
sections a through
 
05:42:59.990 --> 05:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
G it basically says that governmental
 
05:43:03.468 --> 05:43:03.478 align:start position:0%
entities can do can use private
 
05:43:05.788 --> 05:43:05.798 align:start position:0%
information rained from third party
 
05:43:08.948 --> 05:43:08.958 align:start position:0%
providers for or any legitimate purpose
 
05:43:11.670 --> 05:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm that's that's I'm summing
 
05:43:14.030 --> 05:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
that up but if you read through it
 
05:43:17.548 --> 05:43:17.558 align:start position:0%
that's what it says so that it's a
 
05:43:20.590 --> 05:43:20.600 align:start position:0%
very the exceptions are very very Broad
 
05:43:23.830 --> 05:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
and I you know as as I think we may have
 
05:43:28.150 --> 05:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
discussed I don't anti unless government
 
05:43:30.468 --> 05:43:30.478 align:start position:0%
now is keeping
 
05:43:33.750 --> 05:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
information uh for some that they that
 
05:43:36.230 --> 05:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
they don't need to have or or using for
 
05:43:38.868 --> 05:43:38.878 align:start position:0%
some nefarious purpose which I believe
 
05:43:40.628 --> 05:43:40.638 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire is not the case at
 
05:43:42.590 --> 05:43:42.600 align:start position:0%
least I hope that's not the case in most
 
05:43:45.510 --> 05:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
cases um the operations of government
 
05:43:48.150 --> 05:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
should not change at all uh if this bill
 
05:43:51.110 --> 05:43:51.120 align:start position:0%
passes um but what the bill but this
 
05:43:54.948 --> 05:43:54.958 align:start position:0%
bill unlike 195 this does contain an
 
05:43:56.708 --> 05:43:56.718 align:start position:0%
opportunity for a private right of
 
05:43:59.948 --> 05:43:59.958 align:start position:0%
action against the government um or
 
05:44:04.070 --> 05:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
government agents um and would allow um
 
05:44:05.430 --> 05:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
first of all it would may it makes a
 
05:44:07.708 --> 05:44:07.718 align:start position:0%
knowing violation a misdemeanor
 
05:44:10.750 --> 05:44:10.760 align:start position:0%
and secondly um it allows for private
 
05:44:12.788 --> 05:44:12.798 align:start position:0%
right of action to recover either the
 
05:44:14.670 --> 05:44:14.680 align:start position:0%
greater of actual damages or
 
05:44:18.990 --> 05:44:19.000 align:start position:0%
$1,000 for each violation so again I
 
05:44:23.230 --> 05:44:23.240 align:start position:0%
think I think this makes sense
 
05:44:26.110 --> 05:44:26.120 align:start position:0%
um I don't think it will make a ma any
 
05:44:28.310 --> 05:44:28.320 align:start position:0%
kind of major change in existing law and
 
05:44:31.628 --> 05:44:31.638 align:start position:0%
to the extent that you know it it stops
 
05:44:34.070 --> 05:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
some government entity
 
05:44:36.548 --> 05:44:36.558 align:start position:0%
from collecting information that it has
 
05:44:39.350 --> 05:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
no real reason to collect or disclosing
 
05:44:41.430 --> 05:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
it uh when it has no real reason to
 
05:44:43.270 --> 05:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
disclose it then I think that's a good
 
05:44:47.390 --> 05:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
thing um so I would move the amendment
 
05:44:50.230 --> 05:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
anyone else uh wish to be heard
 
05:44:55.788 --> 05:44:55.798 align:start position:0%
on seeing n oh I'm sorry yes oh oh okay
 
05:44:57.750 --> 05:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
all right so is everybody is everybody
 
05:44:59.990 --> 05:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
all right with a show of hands vote on
 
05:45:02.468 --> 05:45:02.478 align:start position:0%
the amendment yes so i' say all those in
 
05:45:05.150 --> 05:45:05.160 align:start position:0%
favor of amendment 09 29h please raise
 
05:45:14.390 --> 05:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:17.070 --> 05:45:17.080 align:start position:0%
17 all right appears that that uh the
 
05:45:18.670 --> 05:45:18.680 align:start position:0%
motion passes
 
05:45:18.680 --> 05:45:20.390 align:start position:0%
