lure and certification Which is far too
 
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 align:start position:0%
many syllables
 
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 align:start position:0%

director of operations Heather Kelly who
 
00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:09.079 align:start position:0%

you may have that I cannot answer um so
 
00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
thank you so much uh for having us this

morning I will uh try to lead off
 
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.270 align:start position:0%
morning I will uh try to lead off
briefly

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
briefly
 
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
um the oplc um the principal mission is
 
00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:29.759 align:start position:0%
to safeguard public health safety and
 
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 align:start position:0%
and Welfare and the public Trust of
 
00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:33.639 align:start position:0%
citizens of the State of New Hampshire
 
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 align:start position:0%
so we have in the presentation you will
 
00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 align:start position:0%
see um starting on slide three we
 
00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
oversee the administration of over 50
 
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 align:start position:0%
occupational licensing boards councils
 
00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
and commissions um seven of those are
 
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
advisory boards as opposed to
 
00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 align:start position:0%
Independent Regulatory boards uh other
 
00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 align:start position:0%
than the actual the size the number of
 
00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 align:start position:0%
members they function very similarly um
 
00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 align:start position:0%
in a role so an Advisory Board is
 
00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
advising the executive director on
 
00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 align:start position:0%
ProMag gating rules and other
 
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 align:start position:0%
regulations related to the profession um
 
00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 align:start position:0%
the regulatory board does much the same
 
00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
um it's a little bit more formal and
 
00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:12.199 align:start position:0%
historically there's a larger number of
 
00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
members um we have a number here over
 
00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
200,000 occupational licenses we use
 
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 align:start position:0%
nice round numbers because it's easy
 
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
we're pretty soon going to have to
 
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 align:start position:0%
adjust that up I believe uh because I
 
00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 align:start position:0%
think we're right now closer to 240,000
 
00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
licenses in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
by my back of the napkin ma that's uh
 
00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 align:start position:0%
about 20% of the state holds an
 
00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:34.990 align:start position:0%
about 20% of the state holds an
occupational

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 align:start position:0%
occupational
 
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
license um in addition to assisting
 
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 align:start position:0%
boards um we have the function of
 
00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 align:start position:0%
Licensing individuals who wish to
 
00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 align:start position:0%
practice in New Hampshire and ensuring
 
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
compliance with those laws through
 
00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 align:start position:0%
investigations and inspections we
 
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 align:start position:0%
average about 100 complaints a month and
 
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
we conduct about 2,000 inspections
 
00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
annually um just for a sense of that the
 
00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:57.880 align:start position:0%
formal inspections that are done by
 
00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
staff members you'll hear mentioned a
 
00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
little a little bit later we have U
 
00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 align:start position:0%
mechanical inspectors so Plumbing gas
 
00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:06.639 align:start position:0%
Fitters um oil heat installers
 
00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
electrical inspectors Pharmacy
 
00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
inspectors we and uh cosmetology
 
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
inspectors so that's um there
 
00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 align:start position:0%
significant changes there but that is um
 
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
embedded staff who are out in the
 
00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:24.039 align:start position:0%
community in doing inspections in shops
 
00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:27.400 align:start position:0%
on job sites and and such um our budget
 
00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:30.039 align:start position:0%
here you will see on slide four for
 
00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:34.199 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2026 is uh 15.1 million and
 
00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:38.479 align:start position:0%
then 27 15.7 million uh again round
 
00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:41.919 align:start position:0%
numbers um that is well within the
 
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
Target that we were given by the
 
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
governor's office um it includes a
 
00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:47.199 align:start position:0%
request to move eight temporary
 
00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:48.919 align:start position:0%
positions to permanent in the area of
 
00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:51.199 align:start position:0%
operations hearings and
 
00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
investigations um in the last budget
 
00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
there were six temporary positions that
 
00:06:58.830 --> 00:06:58.840 align:start position:0%
were converted to full-time um on the
 
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
next slide I'll talk a little bit about
 
00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
kind of the some of the history of the
 
00:07:05.869 --> 00:07:05.879 align:start position:0%
structure of the office and why uh the
 
00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:08.639 align:start position:0%
continuing to add positions there um
 
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
worth noting that we have defunded all
 
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:12.360 align:start position:0%
of the mechanical and electrical
 
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
inspectors from in to meet the
 
00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:16.479 align:start position:0%
efficiency budget but it's it's below
 
00:07:18.749 --> 00:07:18.759 align:start position:0%
well below the Target and the goal is
 
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
actually to bring those back as
 
00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
unclassified positions which happened um
 
00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
with the pharmacy inspector so we're
 
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
trying to compete with Market rates so
 
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
uh the the idea is is to try to move all
 
00:07:32.909 --> 00:07:32.919 align:start position:0%
of these inspectors to that unclassified
 
00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
position um to allow for that salary um
 
00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
and flexibility so again we started it
 
00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:41.240 align:start position:0%
with Pharmacy or it happened a few a few
 
00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
years ago and the goal would be to move
 
00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
the mechanical and electrical to the
 
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:48.360 align:start position:0%
same space um I've heard in other pieces
 
00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:50.680 align:start position:0%
that would talk about how um an hb2
 
00:07:52.149 --> 00:07:52.159 align:start position:0%
request would not have any money
 
00:07:54.149 --> 00:07:54.159 align:start position:0%
attached to it this coming budget
 
00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:56.440 align:start position:0%
session or that may be the plan uh this
 
00:07:58.350 --> 00:07:58.360 align:start position:0%
would be an hb2 request but it would not
 
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
requ require any funding because oplc is
 
00:08:03.469 --> 00:08:03.479 align:start position:0%
a self-funded agency so there would not
 
00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:05.000 align:start position:0%
be any dollars attached to that would
 
00:08:07.869 --> 00:08:07.879 align:start position:0%
just be the language to create those
 
00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:11.240 align:start position:0%
positions so on Slide Five you will see
 
00:08:13.749 --> 00:08:13.759 align:start position:0%
just a little bit of a timeline um the
 
00:08:16.189 --> 00:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
oplc as an agency has not yet existed
 
00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:19.240 align:start position:0%
for 10 years so it is a fairly new
 
00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:22.120 align:start position:0%
office agency within the government um
 
00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:24.680 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire uh in fiscal
 
00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:27.080 align:start position:0%
year 2019 oplc became a self-funded
 
00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:28.840 align:start position:0%
agency so it no longer receives any
 
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
general funds to support
 
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
operations um in 2020 then the executive
 
00:08:34.829 --> 00:08:34.839 align:start position:0%
director was granted authority to
 
00:08:36.469 --> 00:08:36.479 align:start position:0%
promate rules for all boards that
 
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:38.120 align:start position:0%
participate in the professional health
 
00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:41.919 align:start position:0%
program that is this um a dedicated fund
 
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:45.240 align:start position:0%
that we administer um specifically to
 
00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:48.040 align:start position:0%
support professionals who need help
 
00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
around mental health uh substance use
 
00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
abuse um there's a portion of that fee
 
00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
that goes to certain professions that um
 
00:08:59.910 --> 00:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
we manage and contract for that service
 
00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:02.680 align:start position:0%
in 2021 there was an establishment of
 
00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:04.959 align:start position:0%
the enforcement Division and then also
 
00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:08.200 align:start position:0%
notably covid-19 emergency licenses were
 
00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
issued um that plays into the budget
 
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
because there was just a significant
 
00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:14.240 align:start position:0%
volume increase in the number of
 
00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:17.320 align:start position:0%
licenses um in 2022 the statutory fee
 
00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:19.160 align:start position:0%
Authority for boards was eliminated so
 
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:21.880 align:start position:0%
that is solely at the um the authority
 
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
of the executive director um whereas
 
00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
previously each individual board was
 
00:09:28.509 --> 00:09:28.519 align:start position:0%
setting the fees for their licenses and
 
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
then in 202
 
00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:33.160 align:start position:0%
three there was um HB
 
00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:36.680 align:start position:0%
594 which is also known as reciprocity
 
00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:38.200 align:start position:0%
which where the outof state applicants
 
00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:40.120 align:start position:0%
are licensed in another state if they're
 
00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:42.040 align:start position:0%
substantially similar can be licensed in
 
00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:44.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire also that year with the
 
00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:59.710 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire also that year with the
dedicated

00:09:59.710 --> 00:09:59.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
and that decision was made because it is
 
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
99 maybe even 100% of our our revenue
 
00:10:08.509 --> 00:10:08.519 align:start position:0%
and uh the the office was starting with
 
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:12.040 align:start position:0%
with zero in the um in the budget
 
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:13.480 align:start position:0%
basically at the start of the fiscal
 
00:10:15.389 --> 00:10:15.399 align:start position:0%
year so this is just a more efficient um
 
00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
more effective way to run the office um
 
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:20.680 align:start position:0%
we have a a balance right now that is
 
00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:23.480 align:start position:0%
largely the result of low Staffing and
 
00:10:25.949 --> 00:10:25.959 align:start position:0%
high number of licenses in the those
 
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
pandemic years where there were a number
 
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
of emergency licenses coming in
 
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
so the fund is large uh larger than
 
00:10:36.509 --> 00:10:36.519 align:start position:0%
we've ever had before which was Zero um
 
00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
but there's some some money there that I
 
00:10:41.629 --> 00:10:41.639 align:start position:0%
think could possibly tempt someone to
 
00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
create a a lapsing fund again but we
 
00:10:45.389 --> 00:10:45.399 align:start position:0%
would respectfully request that we
 
00:10:47.829 --> 00:10:47.839 align:start position:0%
consider um continue to use that for
 
00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:51.720 align:start position:0%
operational purposes um again as we're
 
00:10:53.389 --> 00:10:53.399 align:start position:0%
completely self-funded we were planning
 
00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
to um we have a fee package that is um
 
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
nearly ready to propose because again
 
00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:02.920 align:start position:0%
this the budget is set by you all um but
 
00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
the the fees are just in administrative
 
00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
rules that we were preparing and so we
 
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
are looking at setting those fees
 
00:11:11.829 --> 00:11:11.839 align:start position:0%
accordingly uh my predecessor began that
 
00:11:13.389 --> 00:11:13.399 align:start position:0%
conversation with each individual the
 
00:11:16.069 --> 00:11:16.079 align:start position:0%
consultation excuse me with the boards
 
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
and we are moving forward in um in that
 
00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:21.200 align:start position:0%
way with a proposal to hopefully have
 
00:11:22.949 --> 00:11:22.959 align:start position:0%
the the revenue side through fees to
 
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
match the budget that that um will be
 
00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:27.160 align:start position:0%
passed in June for the next two fiscal
 
00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.430 align:start position:0%
passed in June for the next two fiscal
years

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
um I will leave the other slides in
 
00:11:34.949 --> 00:11:34.959 align:start position:0%
terms of our um structure and the
 
00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
organizational structure for your
 
00:11:39.509 --> 00:11:39.519 align:start position:0%
reading I guess the the biggest thing is
 
00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:41.160 align:start position:0%
I because I'd like to leave time for
 
00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:44.350 align:start position:0%
I because I'd like to leave time for
questions

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:44.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
um I guess I will just highlight the
 
00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
personnel and benefits cost ends up
 
00:11:50.949 --> 00:11:50.959 align:start position:0%
being about 73% of our budget so similar
 
00:11:53.829 --> 00:11:53.839 align:start position:0%
to many agencies we're we're an agency
 
00:11:57.829 --> 00:11:57.839 align:start position:0%
of people and hoping to um continue to
 
00:12:00.389 --> 00:12:00.399 align:start position:0%
meet the needs of New Hampshire
 
00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:04.360 align:start position:0%
well um the office again like I said is
 
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:06.920 align:start position:0%
new so there are new positions coming in
 
00:12:10.389 --> 00:12:10.399 align:start position:0%
as the legislative um mandates change we
 
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
are we are adjusting accordingly uh but
 
00:12:14.949 --> 00:12:14.959 align:start position:0%
it's it is very fluid and staffing needs
 
00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
within each division has have changed
 
00:12:18.829 --> 00:12:18.839 align:start position:0%
over the last nine years and I
 
00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
anticipate um some more fluidity moving
 
00:12:22.629 --> 00:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
forward as we figure out where to
 
00:12:25.509 --> 00:12:25.519 align:start position:0%
allocate resources um effectively in
 
00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
terms of Licensing and enforcement so
 
00:12:31.189 --> 00:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
I'm with that I'm happy to take any
 
00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
questions thank you uh you mentioned you
 
00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
had a fund balance or how much is that
 
00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:39.160 align:start position:0%
currently it's roughly four and a half
 
00:12:41.509 --> 00:12:41.519 align:start position:0%
four and a half
 
00:12:44.509 --> 00:12:44.519 align:start position:0%
million we have not added to that in the
 
00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:45.880 align:start position:0%
last fiscal year I'm just looking at
 
00:12:48.269 --> 00:12:48.279 align:start position:0%
Heather again she speaks fluent Finance
 
00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:49.720 align:start position:0%
um I believe that is a balance that has
 
00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:51.800 align:start position:0%
mostly rolled over we have not added to
 
00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:53.560 align:start position:0%
correct that those funds have rolled
 
00:12:56.629 --> 00:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
over two years ago the agency operated
 
00:12:58.389 --> 00:12:58.399 align:start position:0%
at almost a loss last year and is
 
00:12:59.949 --> 00:12:59.959 align:start position:0%
currently operating
 
00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
at a loss this
 
00:13:04.509 --> 00:13:04.519 align:start position:0%
year okay when when did you grow the
 
00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
fund balance to be 4.5 million how long
 
00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:08.600 align:start position:0%
have you had that that it's been rolling
 
00:13:11.949 --> 00:13:11.959 align:start position:0%
over uh last fiscal year 22 when it
 
00:13:14.389 --> 00:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
rolled over
 
00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
okay I think you could talk a little bit
 
00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
how you derive your income I know it's
 
00:13:20.269 --> 00:13:20.279 align:start position:0%
it's obviously through fees but how
 
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
would how would the rates
 
00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:24.680 align:start position:0%
set so we have a cost allocation plan
 
00:13:27.189 --> 00:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
method that we use first we evaluate to
 
00:13:30.069 --> 00:13:30.079 align:start position:0%
make sure that we are under the 12 25%
 
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
so that we are not collecting a tax then
 
00:13:35.069 --> 00:13:35.079 align:start position:0%
based off of those fees and our budget
 
00:13:37.829 --> 00:13:37.839 align:start position:0%
we divide the operating costs of the
 
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
agency by the licensing count of the
 
00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
board um any direct costs for like
 
00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
mechanical or Pharmacy we allocate that
 
00:13:49.269 --> 00:13:49.279 align:start position:0%
directly to Pharmacy and do not divide
 
00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:51.160 align:start position:0%
that cost amongst the boards and from
 
00:13:52.749 --> 00:13:52.759 align:start position:0%
there we come up with a figure for the
 
00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
board and then set the fees
 
00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
accordingly have you done any sort of
 
00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
studies to uh see how our licensing fees
 
00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:03.240 align:start position:0%
compare with our neighboring states we
 
00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:05.800 align:start position:0%
have started that process this year uh
 
00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:08.360 align:start position:0%
in response to our fee increases that we
 
00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:09.320 align:start position:0%
will be
 
00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:11.800 align:start position:0%
proposing we have some data but it's not
 
00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.030 align:start position:0%
proposing we have some data but it's not
complete

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
complete
 
00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:16.120 align:start position:0%
yet okay great I think I saw in here
 
00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:17.320 align:start position:0%
where you had
 
00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:19.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned sorry I'm sorry I was just
 
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
going to say for the record uh the
 
00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
proposal the fee proposal that is coming
 
00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:25.000 align:start position:0%
out of the office shall be filed with
 
00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
the joint legislative committee on
 
00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:29.480 align:start position:0%
administrative rules will include
 
00:14:31.629 --> 00:14:31.639 align:start position:0%
include some fee increases but will also
 
00:14:33.749 --> 00:14:33.759 align:start position:0%
include some fee decreases based on that
 
00:14:36.189 --> 00:14:36.199 align:start position:0%
calculation to make sure it's um
 
00:14:36.199 --> 00:14:37.550 align:start position:0%
calculation to make sure it's um
allocated

00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
allocated
 
00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:39.720 align:start position:0%
appropriately okay I'm sorry to
 
00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:41.160 align:start position:0%
interrupt but I wanted to make sure it's
 
00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
not it's not just fee increases across
 
00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:44.720 align:start position:0%
the board I was interrupting you no no
 
00:14:45.629 --> 00:14:45.639 align:start position:0%
need to
 
00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
apologize um I I believe you mentioned
 
00:14:49.829 --> 00:14:49.839 align:start position:0%
in here there somewhere there there are
 
00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:52.120 align:start position:0%
positions created by the legislature
 
00:14:54.269 --> 00:14:54.279 align:start position:0%
that you have not funded yet uh
 
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
including a chief of staff and I believe
 
00:14:58.629 --> 00:14:58.639 align:start position:0%
a council position and maybe one or two
 
00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
more MH uh what What's the timing of
 
00:15:03.629 --> 00:15:03.639 align:start position:0%
that way to in order to uh meet the
 
00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:05.000 align:start position:0%
legislative mandate to fund those
 
00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
positions so the yes if on uh page 12 if
 
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:09.720 align:start position:0%
you'd like to look there we've not
 
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
funded the chief of staff Chief general
 
00:15:14.509 --> 00:15:14.519 align:start position:0%
counsel um or chief legal counsel and
 
00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
then a board Council position that would
 
00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:19.240 align:start position:0%
be within the um we currently have three
 
00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:22.120 align:start position:0%
attorneys that represent the 57 boards
 
00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:25.240 align:start position:0%
so that um with the
 
00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:27.839 align:start position:0%
addition of the review of board
 
00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:30.920 align:start position:0%
materials passed in sen Bill 369 there
 
00:15:33.389 --> 00:15:33.399 align:start position:0%
was a creation of an additional uh
 
00:15:35.269 --> 00:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
attorney position to do the review of
 
00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:38.360 align:start position:0%
those materials to make the um
 
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
information publicly available uh before
 
00:15:43.629 --> 00:15:43.639 align:start position:0%
the board meeting not just a review
 
00:15:45.389 --> 00:15:45.399 align:start position:0%
after of meeting materials for to be
 
00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:48.920 align:start position:0%
responsive to a 91a request um we as
 
00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:52.040 align:start position:0%
those are vacant uh and we were looking
 
00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:54.240 align:start position:0%
at making position adjustments and we're
 
00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:56.600 align:start position:0%
looking at our Revenue right now and
 
00:15:59.069 --> 00:15:59.079 align:start position:0%
basically just it's a a decision of when
 
00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
to fund them uh based on when the
 
00:16:03.749 --> 00:16:03.759 align:start position:0%
revenue is there the chief of staff and
 
00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:05.800 align:start position:0%
the chief legal council positions are
 
00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
both unclassified appointed positions
 
00:16:10.629 --> 00:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
and the goal would be to start working
 
00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:13.000 align:start position:0%
with um the department of or division of
 
00:16:15.069 --> 00:16:15.079 align:start position:0%
personnel um to establish those
 
00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:16.600 align:start position:0%
positions and work forward and then when
 
00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:19.480 align:start position:0%
the funding does come in um to to be
 
00:16:22.269 --> 00:16:22.279 align:start position:0%
able to to post those interview and and
 
00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
fill them so at this point our um the
 
00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:29.560 align:start position:0%
with the current fee structure and the
 
00:16:31.189 --> 00:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
current number of
 
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
lenses the revenue is about $8 million
 
00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:36.440 align:start position:0%
short of what we are all what we have
 
00:16:40.749 --> 00:16:40.759 align:start position:0%
been allowed to budget so that the
 
00:16:42.949 --> 00:16:42.959 align:start position:0%
revenue does need to increase so it did
 
00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:46.720 align:start position:0%
not feel prudent to fund new or to hire
 
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
and start paying for new vacant
 
00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
positions where the office has already
 
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:56.829 --> 00:16:56.839 align:start position:0%
them representative Wilder thank
 
00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
you when you have a board for a given
 
00:17:03.389 --> 00:17:03.399 align:start position:0%
license um do those members receive a
 
00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:05.640 align:start position:0%
stipend or travel
 
00:17:08.429 --> 00:17:08.439 align:start position:0%
pay they do I I'll look for Heather for
 
00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
the specifics it's small yes uh each
 
00:17:13.029 --> 00:17:13.039 align:start position:0%
board member will receive if they elect
 
00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
they can opt out a per DM for their
 
00:17:16.949 --> 00:17:16.959 align:start position:0%
travel time to the board meeting and
 
00:17:18.309 --> 00:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
then they also receive mileage
 
00:17:20.669 --> 00:17:20.679 align:start position:0%
reimbursement if they request so does
 
00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:24.520 align:start position:0%
that depend on like the uh the pay that
 
00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
would be given in that license versus
 
00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:29.480 align:start position:0%
some licenses would would produce more
 
00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:33.160 align:start position:0%
Revenue some less uh it it varies based
 
00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:35.640 align:start position:0%
on the board we can get that data if you
 
00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
would like oh yeah and is it there a
 
00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
consistent number of members on each
 
00:17:45.909 --> 00:17:45.919 align:start position:0%
board it's five most have five some of
 
00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
our larger boards nursing has nine no 11
 
00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:51.320 align:start position:0%
now Excuse me yes so there are some
 
00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
larger boards is not a consistent number
 
00:17:56.909 --> 00:17:56.919 align:start position:0%
I think uh because of I don't I don't
 
00:17:59.070 --> 00:17:59.080 align:start position:0%
want to use the word ad hoc but there
 
00:18:01.789 --> 00:18:01.799 align:start position:0%
are there there have been lots of moving
 
00:18:03.789 --> 00:18:03.799 align:start position:0%
pieces and I think as things kind of get
 
00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
tacked on the boards had existed in so
 
00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
many different places throughout state
 
00:18:09.029 --> 00:18:09.039 align:start position:0%
government that there's not a lot of
 
00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:11.080 align:start position:0%
consistency even within Healthcare
 
00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
there's a wide discrepancy of number of
 
00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
members um in addition to the other
 
00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
professions so it is a little bit all
 
00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
over the place and do you have meeting
 
00:18:23.549 --> 00:18:23.559 align:start position:0%
places for these boards we do have three
 
00:18:26.029 --> 00:18:26.039 align:start position:0%
public boardrooms where they can come
 
00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:28.240 align:start position:0%
and generally we will we don't have the
 
00:18:29.909 --> 00:18:29.919 align:start position:0%
staff to support more than three board
 
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
meetings at a time um so that is what we
 
00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
have in our current space yeah thank you
 
00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:36.789 align:start position:0%
have in our current space yeah thank you
thank

00:18:36.789 --> 00:18:36.799 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
you commissioner I have to at least
 
00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
apologize for being late and uh not
 
00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:43.240 align:start position:0%
being here for your presentation I'm
 
00:18:44.789 --> 00:18:44.799 align:start position:0%
sorry about that yes you really missed a
 
00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
good one yes did did you say um you have
 
00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:51.750 align:start position:0%
good one yes did did you say um you have
$8

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
million your budget $8 million more than
 
00:18:57.669 --> 00:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
you raise that that's it's a projected
 
00:18:59.950 --> 00:18:59.960 align:start position:0%
number but I guess if we based on the
 
00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:01.480 align:start position:0%
budget targets that we were given for
 
00:19:03.789 --> 00:19:03.799 align:start position:0%
the banum and then we do the math with
 
00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:05.720 align:start position:0%
current lienes and current fee structure
 
00:19:08.149 --> 00:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
it ends up being about $24 million over
 
00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
the banum and we have been the
 
00:19:14.669 --> 00:19:14.679 align:start position:0%
authorized the target was just over
 
00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
32 so there is a
 
00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
gap oh over the bium okay over the bium
 
00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:22.510 align:start position:0%
gap oh over the bium okay over the bium
mhm

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:22.520 align:start position:0%
mhm
 
00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:26.200 align:start position:0%
um okay so it it sort of moots my next
 
00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:28.360 align:start position:0%
question which was which is but I'm
 
00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
going to ask it
 
00:19:34.029 --> 00:19:34.039 align:start position:0%
anyway um in the past oplc was budgeted
 
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
differently right that that um at the
 
00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:40.280 align:start position:0%
end of the year the the excess Revenue
 
00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:42.280 align:start position:0%
um would would lapse to the general fund
 
00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
in in the same manner as the if people
 
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
watched um Labor's uh presentation
 
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
yesterday where I think they lapsed like
 
00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:52.760 align:start position:0%
2.8 million
 
00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
um I was going to ask about going back
 
00:19:59.750 --> 00:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
to that model um although what you're
 
00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
telling me is that
 
00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
you're you're 4 million a year in
 
00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
deficit not a couple million a year
 
00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:09.720 align:start position:0%
ahead you used to always be ahead what
 
00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
this is a dumb question but what changed
 
00:20:14.669 --> 00:20:14.679 align:start position:0%
and maybe maybe you don't know I don't
 
00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:16.280 align:start position:0%
I'll give you my best my best
 
00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:17.400 align:start position:0%
understanding of the history as you know
 
00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:19.240 align:start position:0%
this is U only about my 10th week in the
 
00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:21.400 align:start position:0%
office but um it's my it's my
 
00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
understanding that the legislative
 
00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
mandates for the office and the
 
00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:28.120 align:start position:0%
responsibilities that have shifted to
 
00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
the office rather than to the individual
 
00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
volunteer licensing boards has increased
 
00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
over the last number of years so uh for
 
00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
example the um you can go back in our
 
00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
slides and I apologize for this let me
 
00:20:42.029 --> 00:20:42.039 align:start position:0%
just find
 
00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:45.240 align:start position:0%
it um the enforcement division was
 
00:20:48.149 --> 00:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
created in fiscal year 2021 so before
 
00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:51.640 align:start position:0%
that there um that was not an in-house
 
00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
uh operation there was a there was some
 
00:20:56.549 --> 00:20:56.559 align:start position:0%
support within the oplc and within the
 
00:20:58.110 --> 00:20:58.120 align:start position:0%
board structure but then there was the
 
00:20:59.789 --> 00:20:59.799 align:start position:0%
administra Apu the administrative
 
00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
prosecutions unit in doj so there's been
 
00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of shifts Additionally the office
 
00:21:08.029 --> 00:21:08.039 align:start position:0%
now is responsible for licensing um
 
00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:09.400 align:start position:0%
again the professional boards provide
 
00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
their expertise around the rules and the
 
00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:15.080 align:start position:0%
requirements for those licenses but then
 
00:21:17.269 --> 00:21:17.279 align:start position:0%
the office the staff are doing the
 
00:21:18.669 --> 00:21:18.679 align:start position:0%
actual credentialing they're receiving
 
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
the applications reviewing and issuing
 
00:21:23.149 --> 00:21:23.159 align:start position:0%
them in addition to that we also now
 
00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:26.600 align:start position:0%
have um administrative law judges um
 
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
that do those administrative proceedings
 
00:21:31.669 --> 00:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
and I and I think there's um so there
 
00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:33.400 align:start position:0%
are staff doing things that volunteers
 
00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
used to do uh they're doing it
 
00:21:37.269 --> 00:21:37.279 align:start position:0%
effectively and and I think we're
 
00:21:38.789 --> 00:21:38.799 align:start position:0%
growing in efficiencies we have some
 
00:21:40.269 --> 00:21:40.279 align:start position:0%
technology projects that we're working
 
00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
on there but uh staff costs more than
 
00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
volunteers and which seems really simple
 
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
but I think that's a part of it I think
 
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
the other piece is there was some
 
00:21:51.149 --> 00:21:51.159 align:start position:0%
consolidation that happened in the hope
 
00:21:53.269 --> 00:21:53.279 align:start position:0%
that we would um reach some efficiencies
 
00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:55.240 align:start position:0%
and maybe lower costs for the
 
00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
administrative of the the administration
 
00:21:58.789 --> 00:21:58.799 align:start position:0%
of these licensing functions across St
 
00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
government I think what we have found is
 
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
that it's it's possible that there were
 
00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:08.200 align:start position:0%
mandates um that we now upon review
 
00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
there's more work than may have been
 
00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
being done and I I'm trying to say that
 
00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
graciously to just say uh we we may have
 
00:22:17.909 --> 00:22:17.919 align:start position:0%
found a lot more work to do than was
 
00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:20.600 align:start position:0%
being done before the consolidation um
 
00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:22.200 align:start position:0%
now that it's centralized in and being
 
00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
reviewed in that way so I think there's
 
00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
there's more work to be done than was
 
00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
being done we have received additional
 
00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:32.200 align:start position:0%
mandates that require staff instead of
 
00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
volunteers will the will the new
 
00:22:37.669 --> 00:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
computer program at all
 
00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
create I'm going to say efficiencies
 
00:22:43.029 --> 00:22:43.039 align:start position:0%
which is one of those th those I'm
 
00:22:45.269 --> 00:22:45.279 align:start position:0%
mindful of Neil Kirk once saying in a
 
00:22:47.149 --> 00:22:47.159 align:start position:0%
budget hearing I don't think the word
 
00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
means the same thing to you as it means
 
00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
to me and so I think efficiency is one
 
00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:52.120 align:start position:0%
of those words but
 
00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
um uh uh staff um savings so to speak
 
00:22:57.630 --> 00:22:57.640 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying you're going to lay
 
00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
somebody off I'm saying and that that
 
00:23:03.669 --> 00:23:03.679 align:start position:0%
work question right you're you're if you
 
00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
do everything you're required to do in
 
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
statute it it turns out to be more work
 
00:23:08.669 --> 00:23:08.679 align:start position:0%
than may have been being done before
 
00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
because they were doing less than was
 
00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
required in statute we we do hope so I I
 
00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
think we we have 35 really dedicated
 
00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:18.440 align:start position:0%
individuals who um a call center is a
 
00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
bit pejorative but their their role they
 
00:23:22.669 --> 00:23:22.679 align:start position:0%
answer the phone they answer emails and
 
00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:25.000 align:start position:0%
they credential and license individuals
 
00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:27.640 align:start position:0%
all day every day they're very dedicated
 
00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:29.480 align:start position:0%
um they do very good work we're turning
 
00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:32.840 align:start position:0%
around licenses now um 7 to 10 business
 
00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:36.360 align:start position:0%
days um with on a on average there are
 
00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:37.880 align:start position:0%
number of factors that can limit that
 
00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
but a complete application of a person
 
00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
who meets all their requirements is is
 
00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
coming in and out the door um we do have
 
00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
some applications that are still many
 
00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
initial applications that are still on
 
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
paper because of uh technological
 
00:23:53.789 --> 00:23:53.799 align:start position:0%
limitations uh the goal would be to move
 
00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:56.840 align:start position:0%
all initial licenses and renewals to
 
00:23:59.870 --> 00:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
that um to a digit digal platform that's
 
00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:01.640 align:start position:0%
more user friendly and easier on the
 
00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:03.640 align:start position:0%
back end for us to administer I do
 
00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:06.440 align:start position:0%
anticipate that when it's clearer and it
 
00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:08.600 align:start position:0%
works better fewer people will need to
 
00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:11.000 align:start position:0%
call uh because the system will be more
 
00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
efficient so we again we have staffed up
 
00:24:16.029 --> 00:24:16.039 align:start position:0%
a large number right now to meet the
 
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
need and um we're we're addressing in
 
00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:19.960 align:start position:0%
our Licensing Division I think it's on
 
00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
average we're about 97 to 98% of calls
 
00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:25.000 align:start position:0%
are handled which is a dramatic
 
00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
improvement over the last year so
 
00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:28.200 align:start position:0%
they're they're getting the work done
 
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
and and hopefully a new system will help
 
00:24:32.789 --> 00:24:32.799 align:start position:0%
to alleviate the need for so many staff
 
00:24:35.549 --> 00:24:35.559 align:start position:0%
on the phones I would say I hear I hear
 
00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
positive things about uh I don't have a
 
00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
license for anything um but uh looks up
 
00:24:42.909 --> 00:24:42.919 align:start position:0%
to drive I have a driver's license just
 
00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
for the record um I uh but um I hear
 
00:24:47.269 --> 00:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
very positive things about your customer
 
00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
service I saw a news report recently um
 
00:24:52.029 --> 00:24:52.039 align:start position:0%
and I don't know the details of it the
 
00:24:54.909 --> 00:24:54.919 align:start position:0%
governor Pennsylvania whose name I don't
 
00:24:58.510 --> 00:24:58.520 align:start position:0%
recallo I think that's right um I was
 
00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
going to say Josh something but that
 
00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:02.600 align:start position:0%
could be wrong that's right yeah Josh um
 
00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:04.520 align:start position:0%
I think they have an initiative where if
 
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
you apply for a license and you don't
 
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
get it and and they don't get back to
 
00:25:12.789 --> 00:25:12.799 align:start position:0%
you within I'm going to say 30 days but
 
00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
look it up because I'm don't don't
 
00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
believe me on it you don't have to pay
 
00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:17.909 align:start position:0%
believe me on it you don't have to pay
for

00:25:17.909 --> 00:25:17.919 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
it and it's sped up time um you think
 
00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
we're probably in better shape than that
 
00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:27.080 align:start position:0%
I I think they they probably did it
 
00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:28.360 align:start position:0%
because they things were're really
 
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
problematic but I I think we are in
 
00:25:32.149 --> 00:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
better shape than that I me again there
 
00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
are a number of factors that so every
 
00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
board is a little bit different but I
 
00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
would say again if we have a complete
 
00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
application it is not taking us 30 days
 
00:25:40.029 --> 00:25:40.039 align:start position:0%
to get it out the door some of them
 
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
could be within 48
 
00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
Hours yeah oh that's actually quite
 
00:25:45.789 --> 00:25:45.799 align:start position:0%
impressive very nice okay all right I'll
 
00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
shut up now represent
 
00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
W so about a third of your employees are
 
00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:52.269 align:start position:0%
W so about a third of your employees are
in

00:25:52.269 --> 00:25:52.279 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:25:55.149 --> 00:25:55.159 align:start position:0%
enforcement so how much do you generate
 
00:25:55.159 --> 00:25:56.950 align:start position:0%
enforcement so how much do you generate
in

00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:25:59.110 --> 00:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
fines I'm I'm want to look together for
 
00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
that I think we probably are going to
 
00:26:02.669 --> 00:26:02.679 align:start position:0%
have to get back to you on that number
 
00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
we we're going to have to get back to
 
00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
you on that number but we remember with
 
00:26:08.029 --> 00:26:08.039 align:start position:0%
labor that's a a fairly large portion of
 
00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:10.520 align:start position:0%
the the funds they generate and it would
 
00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:12.440 align:start position:0%
seem like if you have a third of the
 
00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:15.240 align:start position:0%
people in enforcement the the fines
 
00:26:17.669 --> 00:26:17.679 align:start position:0%
don't have to be very much to to bring
 
00:26:20.149 --> 00:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
in a fairly good portion if you've got
 
00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
that many people and that
 
00:26:25.029 --> 00:26:25.039 align:start position:0%
many things that failure to comply would
 
00:26:28.669 --> 00:26:28.679 align:start position:0%
seem like a possibility of in inreasing
 
00:26:30.029 --> 00:26:30.039 align:start position:0%
those fines would that have to go
 
00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:32.600 align:start position:0%
through uh rules I
 
00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:35.960 align:start position:0%
guess it would and I and I would say are
 
00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement actions they do include
 
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
fines but uh it is often the case that
 
00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
there will be an agreement not to
 
00:26:46.029 --> 00:26:46.039 align:start position:0%
practice or a revocation of a license
 
00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:47.640 align:start position:0%
and so the the fine is not the only
 
00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:49.720 align:start position:0%
penalty and in in fact it we don't find
 
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
it's the most effective penalty and so I
 
00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
I think our fines would be less
 
00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
extensive than you might imagine because
 
00:26:58.269 --> 00:26:58.279 align:start position:0%
again this is It's individual people in
 
00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
their livelihood so there's there's
 
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
um there's a number of factors to
 
00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
consider there thank you
 
00:27:11.149 --> 00:27:11.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:13.000 align:start position:0%
testimony like to call up now the
 
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
department of military Affairs and
 
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:32.269 --> 00:27:32.279 align:start position:0%
good morning and
 
00:27:34.389 --> 00:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
welcome good morning committee members
 
00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:36.360 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for having us here today uh
 
00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
for the record I'm David mtis the
 
00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner for the Department of
 
00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
military Affairs and veteran services
 
00:27:43.029 --> 00:27:43.039 align:start position:0%
the ad general for the New Hampshire
 
00:27:44.549 --> 00:27:44.559 align:start position:0%
National Guard and with me here today is
 
00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:46.760 align:start position:0%
Judy Chen our administrator in the
 
00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
bottom line up front our current
 
00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
operating budget submission is prudent
 
00:27:52.669 --> 00:27:52.679 align:start position:0%
reasonable it meets the governor's
 
00:27:54.389 --> 00:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
efficiency Target budget that requires a
 
00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
4% budget reduction for State fiscals
 
00:27:58.909 --> 00:27:58.919 align:start position:0%
year 26 and 27
 
00:28:00.909 --> 00:28:00.919 align:start position:0%
we have not requested any new
 
00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
positions however it comes with risk
 
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
before we talk about the risk associated
 
00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
with the efficiency budget I'd first
 
00:28:09.029 --> 00:28:09.039 align:start position:0%
like to offer to you which I think other
 
00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:11.480 align:start position:0%
agencies will as well is this 4% budget
 
00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
reduction is really 25 to 30% budget
 
00:28:15.509 --> 00:28:15.519 align:start position:0%
reduction when you really take into
 
00:28:18.509 --> 00:28:18.519 align:start position:0%
account the salary increases 10% in FY
 
00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:21.320 align:start position:0%
State fiscal year 24 and 2% in state
 
00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:24.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 25 also compound that with
 
00:28:26.269 --> 00:28:26.279 align:start position:0%
additional 30% health insurance
 
00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
increases for this bium this budget
 
00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:31.240 align:start position:0%
reduction is really 25 to 30% of our
 
00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:33.480 align:start position:0%
operating budget when you look at our
 
00:28:34.789 --> 00:28:34.799 align:start position:0%
operating budget you'll see that the
 
00:28:36.669 --> 00:28:36.679 align:start position:0%
state operating budget is only 20% of
 
00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:38.360 align:start position:0%
our overall operating budget where we
 
00:28:40.669 --> 00:28:40.679 align:start position:0%
bring in approximately $34 million of uh
 
00:28:40.679 --> 00:28:41.950 align:start position:0%
bring in approximately $34 million of uh
federal

00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:41.960 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
funds so what is the military Affairs
 
00:28:45.909 --> 00:28:45.919 align:start position:0%
and veteran services military Affairs
 
00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
and veteran services was incorporated in
 
00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:49.960 align:start position:0%
2019 through a governor executive order
 
00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
codified into law that changed the Adent

General's Department which primarily was
 
00:28:58.230 --> 00:28:58.240 align:start position:0%
uh uh given the U responsibilities of um
 
00:28:59.389 --> 00:28:59.399 align:start position:0%
supporting the New Hampshire National
 
00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
Guard with an additional veteran
 
00:29:03.909 --> 00:29:03.919 align:start position:0%

military Affairs the military Affairs

00:29:40.669 --> 00:29:40.679 align:start position:0%
Veteran Cemetery we currently are
 
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
responsible for the state Veteran
 
00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
Cemetery division of community-based
 
00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
military Outreach and the division of
 
00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
veteran services that veteran service
 
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
portfolio is just under 30 uh State uh
 
00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
employees when you compound the
 
00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
legislative mandates that involve our
 
00:29:59.350 --> 00:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
legislative uh our veteran service
 
00:30:02.509 --> 00:30:02.519 align:start position:0%
portfolio you realize since 2019 we have
 
00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
received zero support in the back end we
 
00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
have not requested any new positions
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
will we assume our risk in this current
 
00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:11.000 align:start position:0%
budget is both accounting and
 
00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
procurement the last two years we have
 
00:30:14.509 --> 00:30:14.519 align:start position:0%
turned in federal dollars because we
 
00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:16.200 align:start position:0%
couldn't execute those contracts for
 
00:30:18.909 --> 00:30:18.919 align:start position:0%
either services or construction and
 
00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
exasperated that with additional Federal
 
00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:22.600 align:start position:0%
funding that we use our Congressional
 
00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
Delegation for Congressional directed
 
00:30:26.789 --> 00:30:26.799 align:start position:0%
spending projects uh we have a difficult
 
00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:28.600 align:start position:0%
time in the back end supporting the
 
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
accounting and procurement of these
 
00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:30.789 align:start position:0%
accounting and procurement of these
Federal

00:30:30.789 --> 00:30:30.799 align:start position:0%
Federal
 
00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:32.600 align:start position:0%
resources subject to your questions
 
00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:34.480 align:start position:0%
that's all I
 
00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
have thank you uh question about your
 
00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:39.320 align:start position:0%
federal funding uh how much of the
 
00:30:42.389 --> 00:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
federal funding is secured meaning is
 
00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
there a discretionary component to it if
 
00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
if Washington or uh uh Congress decided
 
00:30:52.549 --> 00:30:52.559 align:start position:0%
that there were things they didn't like
 
00:30:55.509 --> 00:30:55.519 align:start position:0%
the way we were were being done in New
 
00:30:57.029 --> 00:30:57.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is it their discretion that
 
00:30:59.350 --> 00:30:59.360 align:start position:0%
they could cut back on the federal
 
00:31:03.389 --> 00:31:03.399 align:start position:0%
funds yes but generally I'm going to
 
00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
going to contradict myself
 
00:31:09.909 --> 00:31:09.919 align:start position:0%
um generally know that we're giving
 
00:31:11.509 --> 00:31:11.519 align:start position:0%
almost two operating budgets on the
 
00:31:13.549 --> 00:31:13.559 align:start position:0%
federal side one is approximately $200
 
00:31:15.149 --> 00:31:15.159 align:start position:0%
million which you don't see which is the
 
00:31:17.389 --> 00:31:17.399 align:start position:0%
pay allowances travel and training for
 
00:31:18.909 --> 00:31:18.919 align:start position:0%
our soldiers and Airmen and the National
 
00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
Guard the other piece is the operating
 
00:31:23.549 --> 00:31:23.559 align:start position:0%
budget that you will see the $34 million
 
00:31:25.669 --> 00:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
which comes in the utility upkeep the
 
00:31:28.629 --> 00:31:28.639 align:start position:0%
maintenance and the and the services
 
00:31:30.789 --> 00:31:30.799 align:start position:0%
um there's a legislative proposal out
 
00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:32.840 align:start position:0%
there that is titled defend the guard I
 
00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
would offer to you that it's a
 
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
catchphrase which is really defunds the
 
00:31:39.389 --> 00:31:39.399 align:start position:0%
guard if that legislation comes into um
 
00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
um fruition we will be in Jeopardy of
 
00:31:46.149 --> 00:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
much I I have just a a couple things and
 
00:31:52.509 --> 00:31:52.519 align:start position:0%
first of all I it's great to see you uh
 
00:31:56.509 --> 00:31:56.519 align:start position:0%
both of you um and uh uh I'm this first
 
00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
budget in a long time without warrant
 
00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
and and so we already miss him and he's
 
00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
been going a week um um I want I want to
 
00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
say something just for the benefit of
 
00:32:08.549 --> 00:32:08.559 align:start position:0%
some of the people
 
00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:11.080 align:start position:0%
listening um because it's it's the
 
00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:13.960 align:start position:0%
notion of a 4% cut being a 25% cut and
 
00:32:16.149 --> 00:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
all that and I and I think it I think
 
00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
it's useful for the because there's a
 
00:32:19.789 --> 00:32:19.799 align:start position:0%
public audience as well just to
 
00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
understand like 4% of what and 25% of
 
00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
what and all that and so there're you
 
00:32:25.389 --> 00:32:25.399 align:start position:0%
know with with budget numbers there are
 
00:32:26.789 --> 00:32:26.799 align:start position:0%
18 different ways to look at any
 
00:32:30.029 --> 00:32:30.039 align:start position:0%
numberers you know and um and I would I
 
00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
would say that the the rough 4% Target
 
00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
you have is 4% of a of a post pay raise
 
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:40.200 align:start position:0%
inflated number for 25 so it's not what
 
00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:43.000 align:start position:0%
was actually budgeted in 25 but it did
 
00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
include the 10% and the 2% and the and
 
00:32:49.669 --> 00:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
the uh and the pay race and all of that
 
00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:52.600 align:start position:0%
so it so it is actually post that so for
 
00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
example you spent 5.5 million in general
 
00:32:58.149 --> 00:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
funds in fiscal 24 and you're post post
 
00:33:02.269 --> 00:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
cut budget in 26 proposed efficiency is
 
00:33:06.909 --> 00:33:06.919 align:start position:0%
actually 30% higher than that at 7.3 so
 
00:33:08.789 --> 00:33:08.799 align:start position:0%
I think there's a way to describe a 4%
 
00:33:10.789 --> 00:33:10.799 align:start position:0%
cut as a 30% increase and there's a way
 
00:33:14.029 --> 00:33:14.039 align:start position:0%
to describe it as a 20% decrease and um
 
00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
so there a lot of different ways to look
 
00:33:17.789 --> 00:33:17.799 align:start position:0%
at it and so anybody out there agencies
 
00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:19.360 align:start position:0%
preparing their budgets for example will
 
00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
know that there are different ways to
 
00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
look at it too um and I would note I
 
00:33:24.669 --> 00:33:24.679 align:start position:0%
would just want to note that for for
 
00:33:28.909 --> 00:33:28.919 align:start position:0%
anyone listening that's out there but um
 
00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
if you had to cut more which isn't where
 
00:33:33.629 --> 00:33:33.639 align:start position:0%
I was supposed to go with this is it but
 
00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:35.440 align:start position:0%
um if we if we reach the point in the
 
00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
budget where we look at the numbers as
 
00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:38.840 align:start position:0%
they're coming in and say you know
 
00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
between this tax going away and that tax
 
00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
going away we have a little bit less
 
00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:44.120 align:start position:0%
have you thought internally about I'm
 
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
not asking you to share it today have
 
00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:47.720 align:start position:0%
you thought internally of where the next
 
00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:50.120 align:start position:0%
few hundred grand would come from uh yes
 
00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:53.000 align:start position:0%
we have okay I just I'd say that for
 
00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:55.480 align:start position:0%
most agencies to sort of prep them for
 
00:33:58.269 --> 00:33:58.279 align:start position:0%
the worst and hope for the best so um
 
00:34:01.269 --> 00:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:11.869 --> 00:34:11.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
testimony like to call up now the
 
00:34:40.990 --> 00:34:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
good morning my apologies good morning
 
00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
my name is DJ beton Court I have the
 
00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:46.280 align:start position:0%
pleasure of serving as the commissioner
 
00:34:47.430 --> 00:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire insurance
 
00:34:50.069 --> 00:34:50.079 align:start position:0%
department I am joined by my assistant
 
00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner Jason Dexter we are pleased
 
00:34:55.829 --> 00:34:55.839 align:start position:0%
to discuss the Department's proposed
 
00:34:59.310 --> 00:34:59.320 align:start position:0%
budget um as with All State agencies we
 
00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
complied with the governor's Target I
 
00:35:03.589 --> 00:35:03.599 align:start position:0%
will be candid with you and
 
00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
representative Wier probably won't find
 
00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:07.960 align:start position:0%
this all that surprising I given our
 
00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
history together I found it to be a very
 
00:35:13.349 --> 00:35:13.359 align:start position:0%
worthwhile exercise it really forced the
 
00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:16.160 align:start position:0%
department to assess uh the positions
 
00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:18.200 align:start position:0%
that we needed and ultimately you will
 
00:35:20.829 --> 00:35:20.839 align:start position:0%
see reflected here that we unfunded
 
00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
three full-time positions and unfunded a
 
00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
part-time position we also reassessed
 
00:35:31.069 --> 00:35:31.079 align:start position:0%
our need and Reliance on consultants and
 
00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:33.560 align:start position:0%
contractors as well as really digging
 
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
into what the department needed for
 
00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
adequate training dollars for our
 
00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
employees and so as a result of all that
 
00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
we were able to identify a number of
 
00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:46.760 align:start position:0%
efficiencies uh unfortunately for you
 
00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
like a lot of the other agencies you
 
00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:50.920 align:start position:0%
will hear from and have heard from
 
00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:52.200 align:start position:0%
you're not going to see any of that
 
00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
money uh we are a self-funded agency our
 
00:35:57.870 --> 00:35:57.880 align:start position:0%
department is funded via an assessment
 
00:35:59.950 --> 00:35:59.960 align:start position:0%
to the insurance carriers doing business
 
00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that assessment is
 
00:36:05.309 --> 00:36:05.319 align:start position:0%
based off of the percentage of the
 
00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
business that they write here in the
 
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
state um that said we've also been
 
00:36:12.829 --> 00:36:12.839 align:start position:0%
looking very carefully at some
 
00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:16.040 align:start position:0%
regulatory reform uh you will also see
 
00:36:20.069 --> 00:36:20.079 align:start position:0%
reflected here that um we have taken the
 
00:36:22.829 --> 00:36:22.839 align:start position:0%
governor's encouragement over the last
 
00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:25.240 align:start position:0%
many years to get very serious about
 
00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
succession planning in my department in
 
00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
particular I think needed to take that
 
00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
seriously we had heard from uh three
 
00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:34.640 align:start position:0%
Insurance Commissioners over the years
 
00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:36.520 align:start position:0%
about the fact that the department was
 
00:36:39.589 --> 00:36:39.599 align:start position:0%
getting older we had a lot of our core
 
00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
team members who were were approaching
 
00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:43.710 align:start position:0%
team members who were were approaching
retirement

00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:43.720 align:start position:0%
retirement
 
00:36:47.589 --> 00:36:47.599 align:start position:0%
age the warning signs were going on we
 
00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
actually took it seriously and put a
 
00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
plan in place to deal with that and so
 
00:36:55.390 --> 00:36:55.400 align:start position:0%
um the result of that is is that we have
 
00:36:57.670 --> 00:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
filled some positions that we have not
 
00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
as a department filled before so I've
 
00:37:02.109 --> 00:37:02.119 align:start position:0%
put together as you'll see reflected in
 
00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:06.640 align:start position:0%
the form e a proposal to be able to
 
00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
obviously pay those folks but not have
 
00:37:12.349 --> 00:37:12.359 align:start position:0%
the assessment need to go up and to try
 
00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:15.160 align:start position:0%
to offset some of the assessment for the
 
00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:17.640 align:start position:0%
industry while also ensuring as I've
 
00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:19.480 align:start position:0%
said appropriate succession planning and
 
00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
filling uh some key
 
00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:25.640 align:start position:0%
positions um I guess I'll pause here and
 
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
you all can take this where you'd like
 
00:37:30.309 --> 00:37:30.319 align:start position:0%
but I think those are the core uh pieces
 
00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
that um I wanted to highlight for
 
00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
you thank you uh you mentioned that you
 
00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:39.560 align:start position:0%
you derive fees as a percentage of the
 
00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:40.760 align:start position:0%
the business that the insurance
 
00:37:43.589 --> 00:37:43.599 align:start position:0%
companies write in the State uh New
 
00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as we know has has one of the
 
00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
lowest tax burdens in the country and
 
00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:48.680 align:start position:0%
certainly the lowest tax burden in New
 
00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
England uh but I'm going to ask you a
 
00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
similar question when I asked oplc and
 
00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:55.000 align:start position:0%
have have you looked at where your fees
 
00:37:56.510 --> 00:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
are as a percentage of the business they
 
00:37:58.069 --> 00:37:58.079 align:start position:0%
write compared to some of the other
 
00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:00.760 align:start position:0%
states in New England and and whether
 
00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
are we higher lower or or where are we I
 
00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
don't know if you've done that study but
 
00:38:06.589 --> 00:38:06.599 align:start position:0%
if you have I would like to so in terms
 
00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:09.800 align:start position:0%
of the insurance premium tax I will say
 
00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:12.200 align:start position:0%
that we're probably right where we need
 
00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
to be I can't imagine that we're
 
00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
dramatically higher than any other state
 
00:38:18.829 --> 00:38:18.839 align:start position:0%
doing business in terms of the
 
00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
assessment I mean it really is a
 
00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:22.720 align:start position:0%
calculation of what's the Department's
 
00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
budget divided by as I've said the
 
00:38:28.589 --> 00:38:28.599 align:start position:0%
calculation of how much business those
 
00:38:31.069 --> 00:38:31.079 align:start position:0%
uh companies are doing in the state and
 
00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
that's what we take in it's pretty
 
00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
straightforward I'll just turn to I
 
00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
guess Amy is that a fair is that a fair
 
00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
description the person much smarter than
 
00:38:42.109 --> 00:38:42.119 align:start position:0%
I says that was an all right description
 
00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:45.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:48.880 align:start position:0%
that um yeah I don't remember the year
 
00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
we we started lowering the premium tax
 
00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:54.640 align:start position:0%
and what is it 12 years ago somewhere in
 
00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
that ballpark I want to say somewhere in
 
00:38:59.470 --> 00:38:59.480 align:start position:0%
the range of 13 14 or 15 something like
 
00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
that um I part of the part of the hope
 
00:39:05.870 --> 00:39:05.880 align:start position:0%
for that was the the that a bunch of
 
00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
um uh insurance companies might might
 
00:39:12.349 --> 00:39:12.359 align:start position:0%
what's the term domicile here mhm um has
 
00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
there been any success in that every
 
00:39:16.069 --> 00:39:16.079 align:start position:0%
time I go through Hartford and look at
 
00:39:18.829 --> 00:39:18.839 align:start position:0%
Etna's giant complex I think about that
 
00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
this well Connecticut is kind of the
 
00:39:22.990 --> 00:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
capital of insurance
 
00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:25.400 align:start position:0%
and we'll do our best to compete with
 
00:39:27.829 --> 00:39:27.839 align:start position:0%
them but that's fairly well established
 
00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:31.160 align:start position:0%
um in terms uh I I can tell you that in
 
00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:33.200 align:start position:0%
my time with the Department we have had
 
00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:36.200 align:start position:0%
at least two companies domesticate here
 
00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and by that I mean
 
00:39:41.069 --> 00:39:41.079 align:start position:0%
actually created the company and decided
 
00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:44.200 align:start position:0%
to domesticate here in terms of the
 
00:39:46.349 --> 00:39:46.359 align:start position:0%
number of companies who have decided to
 
00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:48.920 align:start position:0%
redomicile I know there have been some I
 
00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
don't know the precise
 
00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
number fair to say fair to say some but
 
00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:56.720 align:start position:0%
not overly dramatic that is correct okay
 
00:39:58.550 --> 00:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
you know but what I would say though is
 
00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:01.240 align:start position:0%
it's not I I I appreciate the fact that
 
00:40:03.349 --> 00:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
at the time the goal was to attract
 
00:40:05.589 --> 00:40:05.599 align:start position:0%
companies to domesticate here what I
 
00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:08.200 align:start position:0%
would say though as well is it was a
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
good decision though they probably
 
00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:11.720 align:start position:0%
didn't realize the reason why it was a
 
00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
good decision at the time because we're
 
00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
currently in a hard Insurance market and
 
00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:18.440 align:start position:0%
I can get into all of that but the
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
bottom line is companies are seeing
 
00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:23.800 align:start position:0%
massive losses they are re-evaluating
 
00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
their risk they are getting out of
 
00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
writing certain lines of business
 
00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
they're managing their risk in a tighter
 
00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:33.560 align:start position:0%
way and I think that we've been able to
 
00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:35.960 align:start position:0%
keep an extremely healthy Market here in
 
00:40:38.309 --> 00:40:38.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire by having a favorable
 
00:40:41.109 --> 00:40:41.119 align:start position:0%
climate both in terms of the tax burden
 
00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
and in terms of a common sense
 
00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:47.160 align:start position:0%
regulatory burden so we are in much much
 
00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:49.160 align:start position:0%
better shape than the rest of the
 
00:40:51.309 --> 00:40:51.319 align:start position:0%
country uh and I think again it's
 
00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
because of the steps that the state and
 
00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
the department has taken over many many
 
00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:57.390 align:start position:0%
the department has taken over many many
years

00:40:57.390 --> 00:40:57.400 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:40:59.829 --> 00:40:59.839 align:start position:0%
that's great thank you for that um
 
00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:01.960 align:start position:0%
you're the the insurance taxes are one
 
00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:05.480 align:start position:0%
of the largest uh larger I should say um
 
00:41:07.349 --> 00:41:07.359 align:start position:0%
sources of revenue for the general fund
 
00:41:10.109 --> 00:41:10.119 align:start position:0%
lately especially with the coming demise
 
00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:12.920 align:start position:0%
of the one of our best performing taxes
 
00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:17.000 align:start position:0%
is going away um the uh you kind of blew
 
00:41:19.109 --> 00:41:19.119 align:start position:0%
the numbers out of the water last year
 
00:41:22.030 --> 00:41:22.040 align:start position:0%
on your estimates which is great um and
 
00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
are looking like maybe will again this
 
00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
year um do we anticipate sort of
 
00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:29.240 align:start position:0%
continuing growth I know the premium tax
 
00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
is the is the driver of that and and I
 
00:41:34.349 --> 00:41:34.359 align:start position:0%
know none of my insurance premiums went
 
00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:36.760 align:start position:0%
down but do do you see sort of healthy
 
00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:40.200 align:start position:0%
continued growth in in
 
00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:42.760 align:start position:0%
taxes a lot of other agencies are
 
00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:44.720 align:start position:0%
counting on you that's all I'm
 
00:41:47.069 --> 00:41:47.079 align:start position:0%
saying we will shoulder the burden
 
00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh it's hard to say and I
 
00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:51.400 align:start position:0%
know that when commissioner nicolopoulos
 
00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:54.200 align:start position:0%
put the revenue estimates forward he had
 
00:41:55.950 --> 00:41:55.960 align:start position:0%
a philosophy of being cautious and
 
00:41:58.670 --> 00:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
conservative and I share absolutely that
 
00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
philosophy but what we were also trying
 
00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
to understand is how does this hard
 
00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:06.520 align:start position:0%
Market impact the revenues that come in
 
00:42:08.910 --> 00:42:08.920 align:start position:0%
via the IP because typically what
 
00:42:12.069 --> 00:42:12.079 align:start position:0%
happens is when premiums go up I mean
 
00:42:14.589 --> 00:42:14.599 align:start position:0%
this is the hard markets a basic Supply
 
00:42:17.950 --> 00:42:17.960 align:start position:0%
demand Dynamic the need for particular
 
00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
kinds of coverage is at the same or at a
 
00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
an increased demand but access to it is
 
00:42:25.829 --> 00:42:25.839 align:start position:0%
more restricted and so therefore the
 
00:42:28.589 --> 00:42:28.599 align:start position:0%
premiums go up when that happens what
 
00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
you see is people will make adjustments
 
00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
in their own budgets and so rather than
 
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
ensuring say the the summer car or the
 
00:42:41.589 --> 00:42:41.599 align:start position:0%
antique car they'll not Ure that uh ra
 
00:42:43.349 --> 00:42:43.359 align:start position:0%
you know they may start to assess all
 
00:42:45.309 --> 00:42:45.319 align:start position:0%
right am I at the age now where I can
 
00:42:48.069 --> 00:42:48.079 align:start position:0%
let my life insurance policy lapse
 
00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
because I don't need it anymore and so
 
00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
when that begins to take place obviously
 
00:42:56.549 --> 00:42:56.559 align:start position:0%
the revenue begins to decrease this has
 
00:42:59.150 --> 00:42:59.160 align:start position:0%
been a very very tricky hard Market
 
00:43:00.549 --> 00:43:00.559 align:start position:0%
again I could talk about this all
 
00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
morning I'll bore you to death I won't
 
00:43:05.349 --> 00:43:05.359 align:start position:0%
do that but we're really trying very
 
00:43:07.630 --> 00:43:07.640 align:start position:0%
aggressively to understand when this
 
00:43:09.829 --> 00:43:09.839 align:start position:0%
Market is going to soften given the
 
00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:12.640 align:start position:0%
Dynamics that are making uh making up
 
00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:14.720 align:start position:0%
the current market and it's it's a
 
00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:16.720 align:start position:0%
little bit of a difficult analysis at
 
00:43:18.750 --> 00:43:18.760 align:start position:0%
the moment I know that uh Insurance
 
00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:21.160 align:start position:0%
Regulators across the country are trying
 
00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
to uh figure this thing out so My
 
00:43:26.030 --> 00:43:26.040 align:start position:0%
Philosophy is we're going to be uh
 
00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:28.520 align:start position:0%
realistic and I would note and you
 
00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:30.040 align:start position:0%
probably noted as well that we did
 
00:43:33.349 --> 00:43:33.359 align:start position:0%
revise our revenues uh based off of what
 
00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:36.040 align:start position:0%
we were seeing we need to maintain our
 
00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
credibility of course but we're going to
 
00:43:41.069 --> 00:43:41.079 align:start position:0%
also be appropriately conservative and
 
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
cautious as well and if the market does
 
00:43:46.349 --> 00:43:46.359 align:start position:0%
begin to soften then phenomenal we'll
 
00:43:47.950 --> 00:43:47.960 align:start position:0%
come back to you and we'll revise those
 
00:43:51.309 --> 00:43:51.319 align:start position:0%
numbers upward and it's good I for the
 
00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
for the IP which is something like 85%
 
00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:54.270 align:start position:0%
for the IP which is something like 85%
of

00:43:54.270 --> 00:43:54.280 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:43:58.790 --> 00:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
your your gifts to the general fund
 
00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
um how much of it is is various line
 
00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:03.800 align:start position:0%
like how much of it is Health versus PNC
 
00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:05.680 align:start position:0%
or whatever well that's a very good
 
00:44:08.309 --> 00:44:08.319 align:start position:0%
question Amy and ballpark I don't mean
 
00:44:10.510 --> 00:44:10.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to hold you to this yeah I
 
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
maybe half is the health and then the
 
00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
other half is all the other lines
 
00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:17.109 align:start position:0%
other half is all the other lines
combined

00:44:17.109 --> 00:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
combined
 
00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:20.200 align:start position:0%
okay thanks that's very helpful oh one
 
00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:21.069 align:start position:0%
okay thanks that's very helpful oh one
last

00:44:21.069 --> 00:44:21.079 align:start position:0%
last
 
00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
thing uh
 
00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
$393,000 of federal funds La uh last
 
00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:27.870 align:start position:0%
$393,000 of federal funds La uh last
year

00:44:27.870 --> 00:44:27.880 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:44:29.829 --> 00:44:29.839 align:start position:0%
what was that those I believe were
 
00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
grants grants that we received for
 
00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
various um is that arpa
 
00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
no no I just I it's it jumped out at me
 
00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:42.760 align:start position:0%
when I was looking at your your chart
 
00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
I'm like hey I didn't know they got
 
00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:46.520 align:start position:0%
federal funds we had a good year
 
00:44:48.670 --> 00:44:48.680 align:start position:0%
attracting some some grants particularly
 
00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
in our life and health division okay and
 
00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:52.960 align:start position:0%
then for succession planning my last
 
00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
point is this is that why Jason's
 
00:44:57.990 --> 00:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
sitting next to you
 
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:00.640 align:start position:0%
and Keith he's here
 
00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:02.720 align:start position:0%
too representative
 
00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
wer thank you good to see you good to
 
00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
see you my friend and uh in the past
 
00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
we've had some meetings about complaints
 
00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:13.960 align:start position:0%
from car repair places have those
 
00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
lessened any have you been able to find
 
00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:19.480 align:start position:0%
a way to to satisfy more of
 
00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
them oh if I had that Talent uh to my
 
00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
knowledge it has certainly quieted down
 
00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
I will say that we do have a couple of
 
00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
what we would uh label frequent flyers
 
00:45:34.309 --> 00:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
yes uh but we are uh certainly working
 
00:45:36.309 --> 00:45:36.319 align:start position:0%
with them continue what I think has been
 
00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
a very constructive dialogue and we'll
 
00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
continue to triage those issues as they
 
00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
come up glad to hear that I look down
 
00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:46.760 align:start position:0%
here and see that your fine uh Revenue
 
00:45:50.470 --> 00:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
in in 2024 was was much higher than what
 
00:45:53.349 --> 00:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
you project going forward was that a
 
00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
special time was that some big uh
 
00:45:59.190 --> 00:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
Federal suit or something that that
 
00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:01.960 align:start position:0%
brought that no we had a couple of high
 
00:46:04.349 --> 00:46:04.359 align:start position:0%
dollar settlements with some companies
 
00:46:07.790 --> 00:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
who needed to get back on track let us
 
00:46:13.069 --> 00:46:13.079 align:start position:0%
say and I think that we have also taken
 
00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
an approach a pragmatic approach to say
 
00:46:17.710 --> 00:46:17.720 align:start position:0%
all right under the statute you know
 
00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:20.200 align:start position:0%
this company really ought to be fined a
 
00:46:22.750 --> 00:46:22.760 align:start position:0%
million dollars but the reality of it is
 
00:46:25.589 --> 00:46:25.599 align:start position:0%
we don't have the ability to chase after
 
00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:27.400 align:start position:0%
the company should they dis dispute that
 
00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:28.440 align:start position:0%
that would have to go over to the
 
00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:30.520 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office and they have
 
00:46:33.270 --> 00:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
a very very full plate so rather what we
 
00:46:36.430 --> 00:46:36.440 align:start position:0%
try to do is to negotiate the fine down
 
00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:38.240 align:start position:0%
to a level that we know we're going to
 
00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
be able to collect that payment and what
 
00:46:42.030 --> 00:46:42.040 align:start position:0%
we'll do instead is put forward a more
 
00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
thorough and comprehensive corrective
 
00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
action plan for that company to fix
 
00:46:48.510 --> 00:46:48.520 align:start position:0%
those problems or the problems that were
 
00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:51.200 align:start position:0%
identified in the investigation so that
 
00:46:53.390 --> 00:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
was likely an anomaly that you can't
 
00:46:56.990 --> 00:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
anticipate happening on a regular basis
 
00:46:59.309 --> 00:46:59.319 align:start position:0%
no we always like to think that our
 
00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:02.240 align:start position:0%
companies and our producers will behave
 
00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:05.200 align:start position:0%
themselves um I have yet to see a year
 
00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
where everybody's been perfect but to
 
00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:09.640 align:start position:0%
your point representative it's hard to
 
00:47:11.549 --> 00:47:11.559 align:start position:0%
say it's hard to say what we're going to
 
00:47:13.309 --> 00:47:13.319 align:start position:0%
uncover What complaints will come in
 
00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
that generate an investigation and then
 
00:47:17.829 --> 00:47:17.839 align:start position:0%
ultimately what turns up as a result of
 
00:47:20.190 --> 00:47:20.200 align:start position:0%
that well I haven't heard any complaints
 
00:47:22.549 --> 00:47:22.559 align:start position:0%
lately so I'm congratulations thank you
 
00:47:22.559 --> 00:47:24.270 align:start position:0%
lately so I'm congratulations thank you
we're

00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:24.280 align:start position:0%

your testimony thank you
 
00:47:49.790 --> 00:47:49.800 align:start position:0%

budget request um and also happy to say
 
00:48:09.630 --> 00:48:09.640 align:start position:0%
our agency request meets the governor's
 
00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
budget targets um the department of
 
00:48:14.470 --> 00:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
energy has a big portfolio of roles uh
 
00:48:16.750 --> 00:48:16.760 align:start position:0%
which include regulatory advocacy before
 
00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:19.720 align:start position:0%
the Pu uh utility and pipeline safety
 
00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:22.640 align:start position:0%
functions uh consumer services uh a
 
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
number of assistant and other programs
 
00:48:27.589 --> 00:48:27.599 align:start position:0%
and also policy work administratively
 
00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
attached to the department are the
 
00:48:31.109 --> 00:48:31.119 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission and the
 
00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
office of the consumer Advocate uh our
 
00:48:35.790 --> 00:48:35.800 align:start position:0%
funding streams are a mix of federal
 
00:48:38.270 --> 00:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
funds utility assessment uh and other
 
00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
funds with a very minimal uh general
 
00:48:42.790 --> 00:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
fund request of
 
00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
$2500 and uh we send that $2,500 to the
 
00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
Connecticut River Valley Flood Control
 
00:48:50.109 --> 00:48:50.119 align:start position:0%
Commission and that's something that's
 
00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
been in our budget it was at the office
 
00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
of energy and planning which became the
 
00:48:55.710 --> 00:48:55.720 align:start position:0%
office of strategic initiatives and when
 
00:48:57.549 --> 00:48:57.559 align:start position:0%
the department was created
 
00:49:01.829 --> 00:49:01.839 align:start position:0%
went with us so we still have that um
 
00:49:04.030 --> 00:49:04.040 align:start position:0%
additionally it's it's worth noting that
 
00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
70% of the Department's budgeted
 
00:49:08.990 --> 00:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
Appropriations are passed through grants
 
00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:11.480 align:start position:0%
um perhaps the most notable example is
 
00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
our fuel assistance program which is
 
00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
funded uh by the lowincome Home energy
 
00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:18.760 align:start position:0%
assistance program or Li Heap uh and is
 
00:49:20.510 --> 00:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
administered in conjunction with the
 
00:49:23.109 --> 00:49:23.119 align:start position:0%
state's Community Action agencies uh the
 
00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
fuel assistance program program as I'm
 
00:49:27.349 --> 00:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
sure most of you know uh
 
00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
purchases uh heating fuels for lowincome
 
00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:33.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh households uh the first
 
00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
page of the overview that we provided
 
00:49:37.470 --> 00:49:37.480 align:start position:0%
shows the regular Federal programs that
 
00:49:40.549 --> 00:49:40.559 align:start position:0%
we administer and then the next page
 
00:49:42.670 --> 00:49:42.680 align:start position:0%
discusses activities related to the
 
00:49:44.990 --> 00:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
Department's General utility
 
00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
assessment um I do want to note that we
 
00:49:49.470 --> 00:49:49.480 align:start position:0%
are actually doing well and feeling good
 
00:49:52.910 --> 00:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
about our vacancy rate um uh the last
 
00:49:55.109 --> 00:49:55.119 align:start position:0%
budget we're in a very uh different uh
 
00:49:57.390 --> 00:49:57.400 align:start position:0%
position uh the state employ raise was a
 
00:50:00.510 --> 00:50:00.520 align:start position:0%
big help in bringing positions um more
 
00:50:03.789 --> 00:50:03.799 align:start position:0%
in line with the market and has helped
 
00:50:06.190 --> 00:50:06.200 align:start position:0%
with retention and recruitment U we have
 
00:50:08.430 --> 00:50:08.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of positions that take a
 
00:50:09.789 --> 00:50:09.799 align:start position:0%
considerable amount of time to train
 
00:50:12.150 --> 00:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
someone and uh to get them up to speed
 
00:50:14.030 --> 00:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
and to maximize productivity so it's
 
00:50:16.030 --> 00:50:16.040 align:start position:0%
really important that we can keep them
 
00:50:18.510 --> 00:50:18.520 align:start position:0%
around uh our prioritized needs are
 
00:50:21.589 --> 00:50:21.599 align:start position:0%
primarily two new position requests uh
 
00:50:23.069 --> 00:50:23.079 align:start position:0%
one is for a new auditor for our
 
00:50:25.349 --> 00:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement division we currently have
 
00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:28.680 align:start position:0%
five auditors uh in a long time excuse
 
00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
me um uh and that number has been able
 
00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
to maintain a busy and perhaps a bit uh
 
00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:39.240 align:start position:0%
strained workload um and but and and our
 
00:50:41.109 --> 00:50:41.119 align:start position:0%
needs have grown I'll say that our needs
 
00:50:43.309 --> 00:50:43.319 align:start position:0%
have grown um you know these positions
 
00:50:46.069 --> 00:50:46.079 align:start position:0%
our audit team uh they have a a high
 
00:50:49.549 --> 00:50:49.559 align:start position:0%
return on investment um they scrutinize
 
00:50:52.069 --> 00:50:52.079 align:start position:0%
the utility records and filings um and
 
00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
they've been very successful in finding
 
00:50:57.750 --> 00:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
savings um two notable examp examples uh
 
00:50:59.910 --> 00:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
would be of their work would be storm
 
00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
costs over the last couple of years
 
00:51:03.829 --> 00:51:03.839 align:start position:0%
we've had several major storms and those
 
00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:05.640 align:start position:0%
costs are very high and our audit team
 
00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
reviews those um those costs and of
 
00:51:11.789 --> 00:51:11.799 align:start position:0%
course the uh Department makes a
 
00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:14.720 align:start position:0%
recommendation uh to the commission uh
 
00:51:16.309 --> 00:51:16.319 align:start position:0%
in those proceedings and and they
 
00:51:17.789 --> 00:51:17.799 align:start position:0%
determine if they were prudently
 
00:51:19.309 --> 00:51:19.319 align:start position:0%
incurred but that's the important work
 
00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
our Auditors do uh another good recent
 
00:51:23.789 --> 00:51:23.799 align:start position:0%
example of their work would be uh
 
00:51:27.870 --> 00:51:27.880 align:start position:0%
recently we filed a motion uh to dismiss
 
00:51:31.030 --> 00:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh Liberty rate case and um you know
 
00:51:33.549 --> 00:51:33.559 align:start position:0%
that was based on the findings of and
 
00:51:35.789 --> 00:51:35.799 align:start position:0%
work of that team so very important work
 
00:51:39.069 --> 00:51:39.079 align:start position:0%
that they do um our second request is
 
00:51:41.589 --> 00:51:41.599 align:start position:0%
for an additional utility analyst which
 
00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
would be utilized uh utilizing federal
 
00:51:46.510 --> 00:51:46.520 align:start position:0%
funds uh in the state energy program uh
 
00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
this position is relatively flexible uh
 
00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
to support policy work of the agency and
 
00:51:53.950 --> 00:51:53.960 align:start position:0%
would be used for uh for projects like
 
00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
the next update of our 10-year State
 
00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
energy strategy
 
00:51:59.230 --> 00:51:59.240 align:start position:0%
um and uh also the variety of
 
00:52:01.589 --> 00:52:01.599 align:start position:0%
Investigations and proceedings um which
 
00:52:03.270 --> 00:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
we have been assigned by the
 
00:52:05.349 --> 00:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
legislature the state energy program
 
00:52:07.630 --> 00:52:07.640 align:start position:0%
gives the agency flexibility whether to
 
00:52:10.470 --> 00:52:10.480 align:start position:0%
support staff or programming Most states
 
00:52:13.309 --> 00:52:13.319 align:start position:0%
use this funding primarily or entirely I
 
00:52:15.870 --> 00:52:15.880 align:start position:0%
should say on staff um we've taken an
 
00:52:17.630 --> 00:52:17.640 align:start position:0%
approach to fund some beneficial
 
00:52:20.030 --> 00:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
programs like Energy Efficiency projects
 
00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:22.240 align:start position:0%
through the state energy manager at the
 
00:52:25.230 --> 00:52:25.240 align:start position:0%
department of administrative Services um
 
00:52:27.829 --> 00:52:27.839 align:start position:0%
as well as a school Energy Efficiency
 
00:52:29.549 --> 00:52:29.559 align:start position:0%
development program to help support
 
00:52:31.589 --> 00:52:31.599 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency in small
 
00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:35.400 align:start position:0%
schools um and however we are shifting a
 
00:52:37.589 --> 00:52:37.599 align:start position:0%
lot of that programming to sep funds
 
00:52:40.630 --> 00:52:40.640 align:start position:0%
received through the iig um want to make
 
00:52:43.069 --> 00:52:43.079 align:start position:0%
that that clear um so with that happy to
 
00:52:45.390 --> 00:52:45.400 align:start position:0%
take any
 
00:52:49.630 --> 00:52:49.640 align:start position:0%
questions thank you um the Department of
 
00:52:51.390 --> 00:52:51.400 align:start position:0%
Revenue with with their Auditors they
 
00:52:54.109 --> 00:52:54.119 align:start position:0%
they say I think with some historical
 
00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
validity that they actually generate
 
00:52:58.829 --> 00:52:58.839 align:start position:0%
revenue from the state uh whereas your
 
00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
aors may not do that do they pay for
 
00:53:04.630 --> 00:53:04.640 align:start position:0%
themselves and what they save rate
 
00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
payers I would say they do um I mean
 
00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
there can be you know millions of
 
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
dollars in savings to Ray paays as a
 
00:53:15.390 --> 00:53:15.400 align:start position:0%
result of their work um and that can and
 
00:53:17.270 --> 00:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
and the two examples I gave are really
 
00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
good ones storm costs um and rate cases
 
00:53:26.990 --> 00:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
I I would just say that if it were up to
 
00:53:33.349 --> 00:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
me you should budget more for the uh
 
00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
transfer to the state Energy Office of
 
00:53:36.789 --> 00:53:36.799 align:start position:0%
the Department of administrative
 
00:53:39.069 --> 00:53:39.079 align:start position:0%
services but that's just one man's
 
00:53:41.309 --> 00:53:41.319 align:start position:0%
opinion it seems like a really good and
 
00:53:44.270 --> 00:53:44.280 align:start position:0%
very efficient program um we could
 
00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
review the memorandum of agreement we
 
00:53:49.309 --> 00:53:49.319 align:start position:0%
have with you just saying um or
 
00:53:51.630 --> 00:53:51.640 align:start position:0%
something like that um given that we
 
00:53:55.549 --> 00:53:55.559 align:start position:0%
gave you Lenny that seems only fair um
 
00:53:57.109 --> 00:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
that that's fair
 
00:53:59.470 --> 00:53:59.480 align:start position:0%
um I have a I have a question about um
 
00:54:01.270 --> 00:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
and this is the dumbest little thing
 
00:54:04.750 --> 00:54:04.760 align:start position:0%
that I'm obsessed with but um
 
00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:08.190 align:start position:0%
that I'm obsessed with but um
Connecticut

00:54:08.190 --> 00:54:08.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:10.750 --> 00:54:10.760 align:start position:0%
floodwater what's your piece of
 
00:54:13.190 --> 00:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
that we don't
 
00:54:15.589 --> 00:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
um I we don't have a piece of it let's
 
00:54:17.870 --> 00:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
put it that way um it's it's just it's a
 
00:54:20.510 --> 00:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
pass through from us and um it goes to
 
00:54:22.789 --> 00:54:22.799 align:start position:0%
support the operations of that
 
00:54:25.309 --> 00:54:25.319 align:start position:0%
commission um and it's it's been on the
 
00:54:27.950 --> 00:54:27.960 align:start position:0%
books for decades I've looked to Lenny
 
00:54:31.390 --> 00:54:31.400 align:start position:0%
on this um a very long time um we don't
 
00:54:34.670 --> 00:54:34.680 align:start position:0%
have any direct workings with them um we
 
00:54:37.549 --> 00:54:37.559 align:start position:0%
we send a check and this isn't related
 
00:54:40.190 --> 00:54:40.200 align:start position:0%
to the property tax uh payments that we
 
00:54:41.630 --> 00:54:41.640 align:start position:0%
make to the people whose land we took
 
00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:42.880 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
dams I don't know I would have to look
 
00:54:47.630 --> 00:54:47.640 align:start position:0%
into that okay where's it
 
00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
budgeted do you know roughly right now
 
00:54:52.109 --> 00:54:52.119 align:start position:0%
we have it budgeted in our
 
00:54:54.829 --> 00:54:54.839 align:start position:0%
administrative um division okay I mean
 
00:54:57.549 --> 00:54:57.559 align:start position:0%
it was in OSI which basically had you
 
00:54:59.870 --> 00:54:59.880 align:start position:0%
know a couple accounting units it's one
 
00:55:01.390 --> 00:55:01.400 align:start position:0%
of I believe it's one of those programs
 
00:55:03.309 --> 00:55:03.319 align:start position:0%
where we don't know where to put it so
 
00:55:05.150 --> 00:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
it goes in the governor's office so OSI
 
00:55:07.390 --> 00:55:07.400 align:start position:0%
here you take it and then it's just
 
00:55:08.910 --> 00:55:08.920 align:start position:0%
never gotten rid of it since we came I'm
 
00:55:09.950 --> 00:55:09.960 align:start position:0%
okay with that because normally those
 
00:55:11.789 --> 00:55:11.799 align:start position:0%
come to me and so I'm very happy about
 
00:55:15.710 --> 00:55:15.720 align:start position:0%
that um okay I just and it's not a thing
 
00:55:17.069 --> 00:55:17.079 align:start position:0%
I'm looking to do anything with it's
 
00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
just one of those uh trivia pieces they
 
00:55:23.349 --> 00:55:23.359 align:start position:0%
government I would like to we'll talk
 
00:55:26.470 --> 00:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:28.240 align:start position:0%

Commission joined also by uh by Mr audio
 
00:55:57.470 --> 00:55:57.480 align:start position:0%
the um public Utilities Commission is
 
00:55:59.630 --> 00:55:59.640 align:start position:0%
tasked with overseeing safe adequate and
 
00:56:02.109 --> 00:56:02.119 align:start position:0%
reliable service adjusting reasonable
 
00:56:04.150 --> 00:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
rates for our state's electric gas and
 
00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:05.510 align:start position:0%
rates for our state's electric gas and
water

00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
water
 
00:56:07.710 --> 00:56:07.720 align:start position:0%
utilities the commission's role is the
 
00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:10.160 align:start position:0%
Arbiter of the interests of um of

customer unregulated
 
00:56:14.109 --> 00:56:14.119 align:start position:0%
utilities the commission regulates over
 
00:56:16.910 --> 00:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
$2 billion in annual revenue and over8
 
00:56:19.870 --> 00:56:19.880 align:start position:0%

00:56:27.710 --> 00:56:27.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire citizens and businesses
 
00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
and in times of high prices an area of

residents and businesses of the state
 
00:56:36.589 --> 00:56:36.599 align:start position:0%
which the commission Works to amarate
 
00:56:39.109 --> 00:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
through its oversight work the site
 
00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee has responsibility
 
00:56:43.710 --> 00:56:43.720 align:start position:0%
for the sighting of energy facilities
 
00:56:46.150 --> 00:56:46.160 align:start position:0%
the committee was reformed by the
 
00:56:49.029 --> 00:56:49.039 align:start position:0%
legislature earlier this year from nine
 
00:56:51.670 --> 00:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
to five members moving enforcement to
 
00:56:53.950 --> 00:56:53.960 align:start position:0%
the Department of energy and combining
 
00:56:58.470 --> 00:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
the SEC and pu so that resources are
 
00:57:00.789 --> 00:57:00.799 align:start position:0%
fungible and uh just briefly on the
 
00:57:04.510 --> 00:57:04.520 align:start position:0%
budget uh for the fiscal year uh 2026 uh
 
00:57:09.549 --> 00:57:09.559 align:start position:0%
Target of 3.75 million um our agency
 
00:57:12.630 --> 00:57:12.640 align:start position:0%
request at the moment is favorable to
 
00:57:14.510 --> 00:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
the tune of about
 
00:57:18.630 --> 00:57:18.640 align:start position:0%
$126,000 for fiscal year 27 the target
 
00:57:21.910 --> 00:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
was 3.83 Million we're favorable about
 
00:57:25.549 --> 00:57:25.559 align:start position:0%
$81,000 at the moment we have 16
 
00:57:27.829 --> 00:57:27.839 align:start position:0%
positions at the uh fill positions at
 
00:57:31.309 --> 00:57:31.319 align:start position:0%
the Pu uh an authorized Target of 17 so
 
00:57:33.990 --> 00:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
that's a vacancy of of one and that's a
 
00:57:35.829 --> 00:57:35.839 align:start position:0%
senior advisor position that's vacant
 
00:57:38.109 --> 00:57:38.119 align:start position:0%
today so I'll just pause there and take
 
00:57:38.119 --> 00:57:40.910 align:start position:0%
today so I'll just pause there and take
any

00:57:40.910 --> 00:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:44.549 --> 00:57:44.559 align:start position:0%
questions question M you're in the
 
00:57:47.309 --> 00:57:47.319 align:start position:0%
Walker building yes sir do you know
 
00:57:48.990 --> 00:57:49.000 align:start position:0%
roughly when you moved to the Walker
 
00:57:51.910 --> 00:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
building um our our space was
 
00:57:55.750 --> 00:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
established with the split of the Pu and
 
00:57:58.069 --> 00:57:58.079 align:start position:0%
our current space uh commissioner Arling
 
00:57:59.349 --> 00:57:59.359 align:start position:0%
house I I have a feeling you're going to
 
00:58:01.549 --> 00:58:01.559 align:start position:0%
a different place but our current space
 
00:58:03.990 --> 00:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
was established in uh in 2021 with the
 
00:58:06.230 --> 00:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
split of the puc and doe no just do you
 
00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
know who's in charge of the move when
 
00:58:09.390 --> 00:58:09.400 align:start position:0%
you moved to the Walker building from
 
00:58:12.789 --> 00:58:12.799 align:start position:0%
the heights I actually don't do you know
 
00:58:15.510 --> 00:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
it's Michelle thank
 
00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
you that's all I want to say that's
 
00:58:19.309 --> 00:58:19.319 align:start position:0%
another piece of trivia of state
 
00:58:20.990 --> 00:58:21.000 align:start position:0%
government that I'm interested I did not
 
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:23.910 align:start position:0%
government that I'm interested I did not
know

00:58:23.910 --> 00:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:25.910 --> 00:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
that any no more questions thank you
 
00:58:29.910 --> 00:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:32.029 --> 00:58:32.039 align:start position:0%
you I'd like to now invite up the
 
00:58:37.549 --> 00:58:37.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
Advocate good morning uh good morning
 
00:58:42.589 --> 00:58:42.599 align:start position:0%
everybody I am attorney Donald C for the
 
00:58:45.910 --> 00:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
record and since February of 2016 I've
 
00:58:47.990 --> 00:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
had the honor of serving as the consumer
 
00:58:50.270 --> 00:58:50.280 align:start position:0%
Advocate I happen to know the answer to
 
00:58:52.029 --> 00:58:52.039 align:start position:0%
the question that commissioner Arling
 
00:58:54.109 --> 00:58:54.119 align:start position:0%
house just asked uh because I was
 
00:58:56.069 --> 00:58:56.079 align:start position:0%
working at the Pu at the time we might
 
00:58:58.910 --> 00:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
migrated over from uh Old Turnpike Road
 
00:59:03.470 --> 00:59:03.480 align:start position:0%
to the fabulous Walker building in 2004
 
00:59:05.349 --> 00:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
and it was a glorious day when we got to
 
00:59:09.549 --> 00:59:09.559 align:start position:0%
do that and yes Ms Caro did play a very
 
00:59:12.069 --> 00:59:12.079 align:start position:0%
very important role in that project and
 
00:59:14.309 --> 00:59:14.319 align:start position:0%
we are grateful to this day I'm serious
 
00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:16.200 align:start position:0%
it's an excellent building and we're
 
00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
very pleased to be there um the office
 
00:59:20.870 --> 00:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
of the consumer Advocate has existed in
 
00:59:24.029 --> 00:59:24.039 align:start position:0%
some form since uh even before that back
 
00:59:26.950 --> 00:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
into the late 1970s we are a small
 
00:59:30.430 --> 00:59:30.440 align:start position:0%
Scrappy state agency currently of uh six
 
00:59:34.589 --> 00:59:34.599 align:start position:0%
full-time employees we are uh currently
 
00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:36.720 align:start position:0%
at no vacancies for the first time in
 
00:59:38.510 --> 00:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
many years we're very fortunate about
 
00:59:41.029 --> 00:59:41.039 align:start position:0%
that I agree with the uh previous folks
 
00:59:43.349 --> 00:59:43.359 align:start position:0%
who have uh well I agree with the idea
 
00:59:46.549 --> 00:59:46.559 align:start position:0%
that the basis for that is the uh
 
00:59:48.430 --> 00:59:48.440 align:start position:0%
increases in state salaries that have
 
00:59:50.950 --> 00:59:50.960 align:start position:0%
helped us attract a really really
 
00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
excellent team uh we have been able to
 
00:59:57.829 --> 00:59:57.839 align:start position:0%
meet the efficiency budget targets with
 
01:00:00.549 --> 01:00:00.559 align:start position:0%
uh relative ease and so our request
 
01:00:02.589 --> 01:00:02.599 align:start position:0%
Falls within those targets our
 
01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs are mainly only
 
01:00:06.510 --> 01:00:06.520 align:start position:0%
arising out of the fact that
 
01:00:08.670 --> 01:00:08.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner Arling housee is uh raising
 
01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:11.200 align:start position:0%
our rent for the small space we occupy
 
01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:13.119 align:start position:0%
in the Walker building sure he has an
 
01:00:15.710 --> 01:00:15.720 align:start position:0%
excellent reason for doing that uh I
 
01:00:17.109 --> 01:00:17.119 align:start position:0%
haven't investigated it so I can't
 
01:00:20.470 --> 01:00:20.480 align:start position:0%
really comment on it uh we in the
 
01:00:22.990 --> 01:00:23.000 align:start position:0%
current bium increase the size of our
 
01:00:25.190 --> 01:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
office from five to six people and we
 
01:00:27.670 --> 01:00:27.680 align:start position:0%
did that because were able to bring on a
 
01:00:30.789 --> 01:00:30.799 align:start position:0%
director of regional and federal Affairs
 
01:00:32.910 --> 01:00:32.920 align:start position:0%
so much of the action these days in
 
01:00:36.270 --> 01:00:36.280 align:start position:0%
electricity regulation has to do with uh
 
01:00:38.270 --> 01:00:38.280 align:start position:0%
the regional grid operator ISO New
 
01:00:41.029 --> 01:00:41.039 align:start position:0%
England and its uh Infamous stakeholder
 
01:00:43.829 --> 01:00:43.839 align:start position:0%
advisory body so it is very important
 
01:00:46.349 --> 01:00:46.359 align:start position:0%
for us to be a visible and muscular
 
01:00:49.029 --> 01:00:49.039 align:start position:0%
Presence at the regional level and that
 
01:00:51.190 --> 01:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
is what we are now able to do thanks to
 
01:00:54.309 --> 01:00:54.319 align:start position:0%
the change the increase in our size from
 
01:00:58.029 --> 01:00:58.039 align:start position:0%
five to six people uh our job here on
 
01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
the home front is to represent the
 
01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
interests of residential utility
 
01:01:03.390 --> 01:01:03.400 align:start position:0%
customers at the Public Utilities
 
01:01:05.430 --> 01:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
Commission we like to think we make the
 
01:01:08.309 --> 01:01:08.319 align:start position:0%
pu's job easier by doing that how do we
 
01:01:10.829 --> 01:01:10.839 align:start position:0%
do that well the puc's job is to serve
 
01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
as the Arbiter between utility
 
01:01:15.109 --> 01:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
shareholders and utility customers the
 
01:01:16.990 --> 01:01:17.000 align:start position:0%
shareholders it won't surprise you to
 
01:01:19.789 --> 01:01:19.799 align:start position:0%
know are extremely well represented at
 
01:01:22.309 --> 01:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
the Pu and so we put a little weight on
 
01:01:24.069 --> 01:01:24.079 align:start position:0%
the other side of the scale and thereby
 
01:01:27.589 --> 01:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
make it easier for the Pu to discharge
 
01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
its Arbiter role uh I think that's all I
 
01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:33.599 align:start position:0%
have to say happy to answer all of your
 
01:01:36.589 --> 01:01:36.599 align:start position:0%
questions thank you uh you mentioned you
 
01:01:38.430 --> 01:01:38.440 align:start position:0%
have six employees up from five but it's
 
01:01:42.069 --> 01:01:42.079 align:start position:0%
it's six employees um how how is that
 
01:01:43.829 --> 01:01:43.839 align:start position:0%
number derived is is six the magic
 
01:01:45.910 --> 01:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
number or is that just because of budget
 
01:01:47.950 --> 01:01:47.960 align:start position:0%
constraints in in the past that that's
 
01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
the money we've given you and so that's
 
01:01:52.349 --> 01:01:52.359 align:start position:0%
what you have to work with uh in your
 
01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:53.720 align:start position:0%
budget I mean I'm going trying to find
 
01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
is what's the appropriate number in your
 
01:01:58.549 --> 01:01:58.559 align:start position:0%
opinion on how many employees you need
 
01:02:01.230 --> 01:02:01.240 align:start position:0%
to successfully complete your mission
 
01:02:02.589 --> 01:02:02.599 align:start position:0%
that's a really difficult question to
 
01:02:06.589 --> 01:02:06.599 align:start position:0%
answer because as you just suggested the
 
01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
the reason we're an agency of six is
 
01:02:11.950 --> 01:02:11.960 align:start position:0%
really just that is the historical
 
01:02:15.470 --> 01:02:15.480 align:start position:0%
evolution of the amount of positions
 
01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
that the governor and the general court
 
01:02:19.269 --> 01:02:19.279 align:start position:0%
have been willing to authorize my
 
01:02:22.589 --> 01:02:22.599 align:start position:0%
counterpart in Maine uh now his job is
 
01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:24.880 align:start position:0%
slightly broader than mine because his
 
01:02:26.549 --> 01:02:26.559 align:start position:0%
agency is tasked with representing the
 
01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
interests of all customers not just
 
01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
residential customers and he has roughly
 
01:02:33.230 --> 01:02:33.240 align:start position:0%
three times the budget that I do and
 
01:02:36.150 --> 01:02:36.160 align:start position:0%
about twice the number of people so if
 
01:02:37.950 --> 01:02:37.960 align:start position:0%
if I had to answer theoretically like
 
01:02:40.309 --> 01:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
what's the right size of an agency like
 
01:02:42.710 --> 01:02:42.720 align:start position:0%
mine for a state of our size I mean
 
01:02:43.829 --> 01:02:43.839 align:start position:0%
obviously we're a lot smaller
 
01:02:45.670 --> 01:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
geographically than Maine but we're
 
01:02:47.150 --> 01:02:47.160 align:start position:0%
about the same number of people and I
 
01:02:49.309 --> 01:02:49.319 align:start position:0%
would say that the main public Advocate
 
01:02:52.190 --> 01:02:52.200 align:start position:0%
is probably more right-sized than we are
 
01:02:55.069 --> 01:02:55.079 align:start position:0%
there is always more work than either my
 
01:02:58.109 --> 01:02:58.119 align:start position:0%
counterpart in m can do or I can do and
 
01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:00.640 align:start position:0%
so if you were to quadruple the size of
 
01:03:03.230 --> 01:03:03.240 align:start position:0%
the OCA we would find things to do with
 
01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
that size at six people we are able to
 
01:03:09.390 --> 01:03:09.400 align:start position:0%
uh be a muscular Presence at the
 
01:03:12.750 --> 01:03:12.760 align:start position:0%
regional and federal levels and appear
 
01:03:15.990 --> 01:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
in almost all of the major pu
 
01:03:18.309 --> 01:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
proceedings so we are able to operate
 
01:03:19.829 --> 01:03:19.839 align:start position:0%
effectively at the size that you have
 
01:03:21.349 --> 01:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
authorized us to
 
01:03:23.150 --> 01:03:23.160 align:start position:0%
be thank
 
01:03:26.510 --> 01:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
you are are you paid by rate payers
 
01:03:28.670 --> 01:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
yes ultimately we're we're not General
 
01:03:30.789 --> 01:03:30.799 align:start position:0%
funded we don't even have any obscure
 
01:03:32.150 --> 01:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
Connecticut commissions that we're
 
01:03:37.109 --> 01:03:37.119 align:start position:0%
funding we could work on that uh we um
 
01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
uh we're funded via the utility
 
01:03:40.349 --> 01:03:40.359 align:start position:0%
assessment mechanism that also funds the
 
01:03:43.190 --> 01:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
Pu and the department of energy but in
 
01:03:45.069 --> 01:03:45.079 align:start position:0%
theory I should be happy about that
 
01:03:46.829 --> 01:03:46.839 align:start position:0%
because you're making my electric bill
 
01:03:49.269 --> 01:03:49.279 align:start position:0%
go down not only your electric bill but
 
01:03:51.510 --> 01:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
also your natural gas bill your water
 
01:03:55.990 --> 01:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
bill and uh yes that that D tells into
 
01:03:58.549 --> 01:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
my second question which is what what
 
01:04:02.029 --> 01:04:02.039 align:start position:0%
percentage of your activity is electric
 
01:04:04.950 --> 01:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
versus the other things so to speak I
 
01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
would sayy that's an excellent question
 
01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
I would say about 60% of what we do is
 
01:04:13.630 --> 01:04:13.640 align:start position:0%
related to electricity maybe
 
01:04:19.430 --> 01:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
65% I would say about 20 to 25 maybe 30%
 
01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
of what we do is related to the natural
 
01:04:22.829 --> 01:04:22.839 align:start position:0%
gas industry and the rest would have to
 
01:04:25.870 --> 01:04:25.880 align:start position:0%
do with uh water utilities
 
01:04:28.910 --> 01:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
our our electric rates um and I'm
 
01:04:31.829 --> 01:04:31.839 align:start position:0%
jumping all over a bit here um you know
 
01:04:34.670 --> 01:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
one of our competitive uh difficulties
 
01:04:37.870 --> 01:04:37.880 align:start position:0%
isn't so much taxes but electric rates
 
01:04:40.750 --> 01:04:40.760 align:start position:0%
which you know if you if you build stuff
 
01:04:42.470 --> 01:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
you worry about electricity you know we
 
01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
don't have hydro so we're not like
 
01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:46.559 align:start position:0%
Washington State and you know the
 
01:04:48.990 --> 01:04:49.000 align:start position:0%
Northeast is pretty high are we getting
 
01:04:51.589 --> 01:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
better in terms of Vis A our neighbors
 
01:04:55.710 --> 01:04:55.720 align:start position:0%
or worse I think we're getting better uh
 
01:04:57.390 --> 01:04:57.400 align:start position:0%
we are the only state that doesn't have
 
01:05:00.789 --> 01:05:00.799 align:start position:0%
a mandatory decarbonization goal and
 
01:05:03.069 --> 01:05:03.079 align:start position:0%
that has freed the state up from the
 
01:05:06.549 --> 01:05:06.559 align:start position:0%
need to pursue and or subsidize uh
 
01:05:08.910 --> 01:05:08.920 align:start position:0%
resources that aren't competitive with
 
01:05:10.829 --> 01:05:10.839 align:start position:0%
uh resources that aren't considered
 
01:05:13.549 --> 01:05:13.559 align:start position:0%
renewable we do have hydro resources we
 
01:05:15.630 --> 01:05:15.640 align:start position:0%
import power from Canada which is
 
01:05:18.589 --> 01:05:18.599 align:start position:0%
largely generated uh via Hydro One thing
 
01:05:20.349 --> 01:05:20.359 align:start position:0%
I didn't mention is that we're entering
 
01:05:22.190 --> 01:05:22.200 align:start position:0%
a new era of electricity in New
 
01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:24.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and it is the era of the
 
01:05:27.750 --> 01:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
community power agregation programs so
 
01:05:31.109 --> 01:05:31.119 align:start position:0%
there is a joint action or joint Powers
 
01:05:33.470 --> 01:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
Authority Coalition of many many
 
01:05:35.349 --> 01:05:35.359 align:start position:0%
municipalities and all called the
 
01:05:37.230 --> 01:05:37.240 align:start position:0%
community power Coalition of New
 
01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:40.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it is on its way to becoming
 
01:05:42.670 --> 01:05:42.680 align:start position:0%
the largest load serving entity in the
 
01:05:45.470 --> 01:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
state and keeping an eye on them is an
 
01:05:47.670 --> 01:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
important new imperative for me and my
 
01:05:50.309 --> 01:05:50.319 align:start position:0%
staff and if the if say the department
 
01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
of energy starts to investigate
 
01:05:53.789 --> 01:05:53.799 align:start position:0%
something like micro grids is that
 
01:05:55.510 --> 01:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
something that you tend to be involved
 
01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:56.990 align:start position:0%
something that you tend to be involved
with

01:05:56.990 --> 01:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:06:00.789 --> 01:06:00.799 align:start position:0%
uh yes or like in the beginning or later
 
01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
uh the beginning the middle and the end
 
01:06:05.710 --> 01:06:05.720 align:start position:0%
okay uh and as the department becomes
 
01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
more of a regulator and opens
 
01:06:09.589 --> 01:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
investigations and conducts its own
 
01:06:11.630 --> 01:06:11.640 align:start position:0%
proceedings that also is something we
 
01:06:16.230 --> 01:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:18.269 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:06:18.269 --> 01:06:18.279 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:06:20.470 --> 01:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
representative are you involved in any
 
01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:22.640 align:start position:0%
way with um backup
 
01:06:25.750 --> 01:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
systems um we keep hearing there threat
 
01:06:29.190 --> 01:06:29.200 align:start position:0%
on the electric grid do you keep track
 
01:06:32.829 --> 01:06:32.839 align:start position:0%
of of any of that efforts I I think it
 
01:06:34.430 --> 01:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
depends a little bit on what you mean by
 
01:06:37.829 --> 01:06:37.839 align:start position:0%
backup systems if you're worried about
 
01:06:40.750 --> 01:06:40.760 align:start position:0%
cyber security which is a pressing
 
01:06:43.150 --> 01:06:43.160 align:start position:0%
concern for the electricity grid I I
 
01:06:46.150 --> 01:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
think the answer is that we are not at
 
01:06:49.230 --> 01:06:49.240 align:start position:0%
least not below the level of making sure
 
01:06:50.950 --> 01:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
that the right people are thinking about
 
01:06:54.190 --> 01:06:54.200 align:start position:0%
that cyber security is very technical
 
01:06:57.150 --> 01:06:57.160 align:start position:0%
and uh it falls into this weird category
 
01:06:59.109 --> 01:06:59.119 align:start position:0%
of stuff I actually don't want to know
 
01:07:00.990 --> 01:07:01.000 align:start position:0%
about because there's no way I can
 
01:07:05.029 --> 01:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
develop the expertise to uh question or
 
01:07:06.789 --> 01:07:06.799 align:start position:0%
scrutinize the Judgment of the Cyber
 
01:07:09.029 --> 01:07:09.039 align:start position:0%
Security Experts who protect the grid
 
01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
and the more people who know about that
 
01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
stuff the more security risk there is so
 
01:07:15.789 --> 01:07:15.799 align:start position:0%
we try to actually stay out of that
 
01:07:17.870 --> 01:07:17.880 align:start position:0%
Beyond assuring ourselves that the right
 
01:07:19.510 --> 01:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
people are keeping an eye on that and I
 
01:07:22.430 --> 01:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
I I do think they are and we as a result
 
01:07:24.910 --> 01:07:24.920 align:start position:0%
have not suffered any cyber security
 
01:07:27.589 --> 01:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
breaches or failures in the electricity
 
01:07:29.710 --> 01:07:29.720 align:start position:0%
grid during my years as consumer
 
01:07:32.069 --> 01:07:32.079 align:start position:0%
Advocate uh do we worry about
 
01:07:34.549 --> 01:07:34.559 align:start position:0%
reliability and resilience yes that's a
 
01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
big deal especially at the regional
 
01:07:37.829 --> 01:07:37.839 align:start position:0%
level because we spend a lot of
 
01:07:39.349 --> 01:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
resources making sure that the bulk
 
01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
power transmission system the regional
 
01:07:46.190 --> 01:07:46.200 align:start position:0%
electricity grid is uh impervious to
 
01:07:48.269 --> 01:07:48.279 align:start position:0%
things that challenge it principally the
 
01:07:51.069 --> 01:07:51.079 align:start position:0%
thing that we worry about is an extended
 
01:07:54.589 --> 01:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
cold spell in the winter when
 
01:07:57.069 --> 01:07:57.079 align:start position:0%
electricity generators are competing for
 
01:07:59.990 --> 01:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
fuel with uh people and businesses who
 
01:08:02.710 --> 01:08:02.720 align:start position:0%
use natural gas for
 
01:08:06.230 --> 01:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
heat uh kind of off the subject I know
 
01:08:08.990 --> 01:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
another Don creit how do you spell your
 
01:08:12.150 --> 01:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
last name I spell my last name k r
 
01:08:16.149 --> 01:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:18.309 --> 01:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
you that was the easiest question I've
 
01:08:20.550 --> 01:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
gotten so far
 
01:08:22.709 --> 01:08:22.719 align:start position:0%
today okay see you know other questions
 
01:08:24.829 --> 01:08:24.839 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
01:08:27.070 --> 01:08:27.080 align:start position:0%
yeah see we've now completed our
 
01:08:31.390 --> 01:08:31.400 align:start position:0%
our uh 8:30 slate of of testimony so we
 
01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:54.440 align:start position:0%

01:34:22.470 --> 01:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
their square
 
01:34:25.950 --> 01:34:25.960 align:start position:0%
miles and our core functions and my
 
01:34:28.109 --> 01:34:28.119 align:start position:0%
contact information I never want to
 
01:34:29.950 --> 01:34:29.960 align:start position:0%
assume that everybody just knows who the
 
01:34:31.950 --> 01:34:31.960 align:start position:0%
executive council is or what they do so
 
01:34:33.350 --> 01:34:33.360 align:start position:0%
I figured a little bit of information
 
01:34:37.030 --> 01:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
might be helpful um in my budget booklet
 
01:34:40.030 --> 01:34:40.040 align:start position:0%
this morning you'll see that we did meet
 
01:34:43.950 --> 01:34:43.960 align:start position:0%
the 20 fiscal year 2627 efficiency
 
01:34:48.229 --> 01:34:48.239 align:start position:0%
Target um and that we are um we have a
 
01:34:52.310 --> 01:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
PRI prioritized needs request in for our
 
01:34:54.350 --> 01:34:54.360 align:start position:0%
part-time position in the
 
01:34:59.350 --> 01:34:59.360 align:start position:0%
office um the office is a staff of 1.5
 
01:35:01.750 --> 01:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
it's myself as a full-time uh employee
 
01:35:04.270 --> 01:35:04.280 align:start position:0%
and then I have a part-time staff member
 
01:35:06.790 --> 01:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
and then the executive counselors um
 
01:35:09.030 --> 01:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
having the part-time staffer has been a
 
01:35:12.030 --> 01:35:12.040 align:start position:0%
lifesaver for our office um for office
 
01:35:13.910 --> 01:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
coverage and
 
01:35:16.590 --> 01:35:16.600 align:start position:0%
other um just being able to provide the
 
01:35:18.550 --> 01:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
assistance needed to keep the office
 
01:35:20.270 --> 01:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
running well and to assist the
 
01:35:23.149 --> 01:35:23.159 align:start position:0%
counselors as they need um but I'm happy
 
01:35:25.350 --> 01:35:25.360 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions should anybody
 
01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:27.189 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions should anybody
have

01:35:27.189 --> 01:35:27.199 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:35:31.430 --> 01:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
any thank you uh how many meetings do
 
01:35:32.990 --> 01:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
you have a year I mean I know they're
 
01:35:35.189 --> 01:35:35.199 align:start position:0%
every other week but sometimes you skip
 
01:35:36.990 --> 01:35:37.000 align:start position:0%
a week roughly how many meetings do you
 
01:35:40.590 --> 01:35:40.600 align:start position:0%
have so it's anywhere between 22 to 24
 
01:35:43.510 --> 01:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
um meetings per year um schedules set by
 
01:35:45.910 --> 01:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
governor and counselors and uh approved
 
01:35:48.830 --> 01:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
in six-month increments thank you who
 
01:35:50.590 --> 01:35:50.600 align:start position:0%
actually pays for those meetings and and
 
01:35:52.550 --> 01:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
when I mean with with pay I mean the
 
01:35:55.629 --> 01:35:55.639 align:start position:0%
entire thing from from the breakfast is
 
01:35:57.149 --> 01:35:57.159 align:start position:0%
uh that they have the breakfast meeting
 
01:35:58.669 --> 01:35:58.679 align:start position:0%
and then the main meeting I know you
 
01:36:02.950 --> 01:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
have uh uh you know audio teams and doit
 
01:36:05.109 --> 01:36:05.119 align:start position:0%
teams and things like that but uh if you
 
01:36:06.830 --> 01:36:06.840 align:start position:0%
could just go through how those costs
 
01:36:11.629 --> 01:36:11.639 align:start position:0%
are allocated sure so um the the
 
01:36:13.830 --> 01:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
meetings as they're scheduled each
 
01:36:16.109 --> 01:36:16.119 align:start position:0%
executive counselor um and it usually
 
01:36:18.149 --> 01:36:18.159 align:start position:0%
goes in order by Council and including
 
01:36:20.750 --> 01:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
the governor at the end they get to pick
 
01:36:23.750 --> 01:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
a state agency or office to host us for
 
01:36:25.709 --> 01:36:25.719 align:start position:0%
a breakfast meeting and it is an
 
01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the state agency or
 
01:36:29.950 --> 01:36:29.960 align:start position:0%
office to kind of update governor and
 
01:36:32.189 --> 01:36:32.199 align:start position:0%
counsel um on things that they're doing
 
01:36:33.590 --> 01:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
or if they're running into issues with
 
01:36:37.629 --> 01:36:37.639 align:start position:0%
things stuff of that nature the cost of
 
01:36:40.189 --> 01:36:40.199 align:start position:0%
um hosting the governor and Council for
 
01:36:43.310 --> 01:36:43.320 align:start position:0%
breakfast falls on the agency currently
 
01:36:46.149 --> 01:36:46.159 align:start position:0%
so whatever agency is tapped has to pay
 
01:36:50.990 --> 01:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
the cost of breakfast um that usually
 
01:36:52.950 --> 01:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
when they're being when the agencies are
 
01:36:56.310 --> 01:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
being told how many people to plan for
 
01:36:58.350 --> 01:36:58.360 align:start position:0%
um the number is usually between 20 and
 
01:37:00.950 --> 01:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
30 25 and 30 that we ask them to plan
 
01:37:02.790 --> 01:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
for because it's not the responsibility
 
01:37:06.390 --> 01:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
of the agency to You Know cover
 
01:37:09.189 --> 01:37:09.199 align:start position:0%
everything it's their responsibility to
 
01:37:12.550 --> 01:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
um provide breakfast for the governor
 
01:37:14.550 --> 01:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
counselors and the state agency staff
 
01:37:16.870 --> 01:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
that have to be there um but that falls
 
01:37:19.750 --> 01:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
on the agency um the regular meetings
 
01:37:21.950 --> 01:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
which begin at 10:00 a.m. um at the
 
01:37:24.790 --> 01:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
state house or sometimes off um offsite
 
01:37:26.270 --> 01:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
during the summer months and we take the
 
01:37:30.709 --> 01:37:30.719 align:start position:0%
show on the road um the cost of um so
 
01:37:33.390 --> 01:37:33.400 align:start position:0%
usually there's a reading or prayer um
 
01:37:34.990 --> 01:37:35.000 align:start position:0%
the people that come in are chosen by
 
01:37:37.430 --> 01:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
the governor or counselor that's hosting
 
01:37:40.750 --> 01:37:40.760 align:start position:0%
there's no cost associated with that um
 
01:37:43.109 --> 01:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
there is always some sort or not always
 
01:37:44.470 --> 01:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
but there's usually some sort of
 
01:37:46.629 --> 01:37:46.639 align:start position:0%
entertainment like a local school will
 
01:37:49.669 --> 01:37:49.679 align:start position:0%
come bring the school kids to sing or
 
01:37:52.030 --> 01:37:52.040 align:start position:0%
maybe local performers Come and sing or
 
01:37:54.229 --> 01:37:54.239 align:start position:0%
play instruments
 
01:37:57.950 --> 01:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
there it has been my understanding and
 
01:37:59.910 --> 01:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
it has been past practice
 
01:38:03.350 --> 01:38:03.360 align:start position:0%
that there is not a cost associated with
 
01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:04.310 align:start position:0%
that there is not a cost associated with
that

01:38:04.310 --> 01:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:38:09.950 --> 01:38:09.960 align:start position:0%
however um if we were to reach out to um
 
01:38:12.350 --> 01:38:12.360 align:start position:0%
a state agency or to ask for help like
 
01:38:15.229 --> 01:38:15.239 align:start position:0%
dncr or the arts program and there were
 
01:38:18.149 --> 01:38:18.159 align:start position:0%
a cost associated with that I have never
 
01:38:20.910 --> 01:38:20.920 align:start position:0%
paid that cost from our budget and to my
 
01:38:23.270 --> 01:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
knowledge the governor's office has not
 
01:38:25.709 --> 01:38:25.719 align:start position:0%
there could have an agency could have
 
01:38:28.310 --> 01:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
incurred that cost on their own but I
 
01:38:32.990 --> 01:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:36.470 --> 01:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
you Hi how are you I'm well how are you
 
01:38:38.189 --> 01:38:38.199 align:start position:0%
um I just I wanted to point out a couple
 
01:38:40.669 --> 01:38:40.679 align:start position:0%
things for the record for people who are
 
01:38:43.470 --> 01:38:43.480 align:start position:0%
uh listening and watching at home um the
 
01:38:43.480 --> 01:38:44.550 align:start position:0%
uh listening and watching at home um the
the

01:38:44.550 --> 01:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:38:46.830 --> 01:38:46.840 align:start position:0%
council well there there a couple things
 
01:38:51.669 --> 01:38:51.679 align:start position:0%
one I presume the the in your budget the
 
01:38:55.510 --> 01:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
class the class 11 is you or maybe the
 
01:38:58.430 --> 01:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
class 12 is you the class 11 is the five
 
01:39:03.430 --> 01:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
counselors and the class 12 is um your
 
01:39:06.669 --> 01:39:06.679 align:start position:0%
wonderful part-time assistant um so the
 
01:39:11.990 --> 01:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
class 16 is the um part-time
 
01:39:13.910 --> 01:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
assistant and then the counselors are
 
01:39:17.229 --> 01:39:17.239 align:start position:0%
paid out of 11 or 12 yes okay yes
 
01:39:19.990 --> 01:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
they're paid out of um
 
01:39:25.070 --> 01:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
11 um and uh uh for years the each of
 
01:39:26.790 --> 01:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
the counselors has a has a stipend
 
01:39:28.270 --> 01:39:28.280 align:start position:0%
that's meant to cover their
 
01:39:30.189 --> 01:39:30.199 align:start position:0%
expenses and I think it was two years
 
01:39:31.830 --> 01:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
ago that it used to be district one
 
01:39:33.430 --> 01:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
always got more because it's such a
 
01:39:35.709 --> 01:39:35.719 align:start position:0%
giant district and redistricting mid
 
01:39:38.990 --> 01:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
District Two also weirdly large district
 
01:39:41.270 --> 01:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
and so now one and two get more three
 
01:39:43.350 --> 01:39:43.360 align:start position:0%
four and five get less right that is
 
01:39:45.430 --> 01:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
correct and
 
01:39:49.270 --> 01:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
um when you present to the house do you
 
01:39:51.750 --> 01:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
present to the house yes and do any of
 
01:39:55.830 --> 01:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:59.669 --> 01:39:59.679 align:start position:0%
no which is unusual I just will note for
 
01:40:01.830 --> 01:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
a couple of the house members that there
 
01:40:03.990 --> 01:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
are always some counselors who who find
 
01:40:06.430 --> 01:40:06.440 align:start position:0%
the budget process mysterious and don't
 
01:40:07.830 --> 01:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
realize that they're allowed to advocate
 
01:40:10.870 --> 01:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
for themselves so if you want to Curry
 
01:40:12.550 --> 01:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
favor with them there's a
 
01:40:14.669 --> 01:40:14.679 align:start position:0%
possibility thank you nice to see you
 
01:40:17.390 --> 01:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:19.669 --> 01:40:19.679 align:start position:0%
you seeing no further questions thank
 
01:40:27.510 --> 01:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:29.510 --> 01:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
like to invite up now the developmental
 
01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:39.430 align:start position:0%
like to invite up now the developmental
disabilities

01:40:39.430 --> 01:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:42.030 --> 01:40:42.040 align:start position:0%
Council good
 
01:41:04.070 --> 01:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:06.470 --> 01:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
and we're good thank you so for the
 
01:41:09.109 --> 01:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
record my name is isidora Rodriguez
 
01:41:11.510 --> 01:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
legendre I serve as the executive
 
01:41:14.229 --> 01:41:14.239 align:start position:0%
director at the New Hampshire Council on
 
01:41:19.149 --> 01:41:19.159 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities we are a 100%
 
01:41:22.709 --> 01:41:22.719 align:start position:0%
federally funded state agency so our
 
01:41:26.390 --> 01:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
Target was zero and we met
 
01:41:32.149 --> 01:41:32.159 align:start position:0%
it um that's a fun joke I have um so I
 
01:41:35.669 --> 01:41:35.679 align:start position:0%
my information that I have provided this
 
01:41:38.790 --> 01:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
morning is really associated with kind
 
01:41:42.950 --> 01:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
of who we are and what we do um our
 
01:41:45.189 --> 01:41:45.199 align:start position:0%
Council as I said is federally funded
 
01:41:47.950 --> 01:41:47.960 align:start position:0%
we're established through a federal law
 
01:41:51.669 --> 01:41:51.679 align:start position:0%
known as the DD act um our charge within
 
01:41:54.669 --> 01:41:54.679 align:start position:0%
that law is to identify the most
 
01:41:58.470 --> 01:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
pressing needs of the um community of
 
01:42:00.709 --> 01:42:00.719 align:start position:0%
people in New Hampshire experiencing
 
01:42:02.470 --> 01:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
intellectual and developmental
 
01:42:05.350 --> 01:42:05.360 align:start position:0%
disabilities it's very specific which
 
01:42:08.189 --> 01:42:08.199 align:start position:0%
makes us um different than for example
 
01:42:10.070 --> 01:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
the governor's Commission on disability
 
01:42:12.229 --> 01:42:12.239 align:start position:0%
which focuses on the Ada and
 
01:42:14.669 --> 01:42:14.679 align:start position:0%
accessibility for all people with
 
01:42:18.750 --> 01:42:18.760 align:start position:0%
disabilities um uh our funding is
 
01:42:23.790 --> 01:42:23.800 align:start position:0%
established by Congress so um our budget
 
01:42:29.750 --> 01:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
that we get is a grant um and we have a
 
01:42:32.709 --> 01:42:32.719 align:start position:0%
what's called a 2year project period
 
01:42:35.070 --> 01:42:35.080 align:start position:0%
when we get those funds so typically we
 
01:42:38.830 --> 01:42:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:43.390 --> 01:42:43.400 align:start position:0%
226,000 a year um and then we have two
 
01:42:45.950 --> 01:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
years to obligate those funds and a
 
01:42:48.910 --> 01:42:48.920 align:start position:0%
third year to liquidate those funds
 
01:42:51.669 --> 01:42:51.679 align:start position:0%
which allows us to carry forward funding
 
01:42:53.669 --> 01:42:53.679 align:start position:0%
which is why our budget
 
01:42:56.589 --> 01:42:56.599 align:start position:0%
um is higher than
 
01:42:59.790 --> 01:42:59.800 align:start position:0%
$526,000 which is hopefully our
 
01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
anticipated Grant award for this year as
 
01:43:06.390 --> 01:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
well it hasn't really changed much in
 
01:43:11.550 --> 01:43:11.560 align:start position:0%
many years um so I like to say we do a
 
01:43:14.270 --> 01:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
lot with the little funding that we do
 
01:43:18.870 --> 01:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
have um mostly we need to partner with
 
01:43:20.510 --> 01:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
other groups and
 
01:43:25.709 --> 01:43:25.719 align:start position:0%
organizations that help us um support uh
 
01:43:28.950 --> 01:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
creative initiatives um for true
 
01:43:31.350 --> 01:43:31.360 align:start position:0%
authentic Community inclusion for people
 
01:43:33.510 --> 01:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
with intellectual and developmental
 
01:43:36.430 --> 01:43:36.440 align:start position:0%
disabilities all around New Hampshire
 
01:43:40.709 --> 01:43:40.719 align:start position:0%
and so um although a lot of our
 
01:43:44.589 --> 01:43:44.599 align:start position:0%
funding is used for our three full-time
 
01:43:48.550 --> 01:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
staff that's what we have um according
 
01:43:52.750 --> 01:43:52.760 align:start position:0%
to the DD act 70% of our budget must go
 
01:43:55.990 --> 01:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
to projects initiatives and programming
 
01:43:58.310 --> 01:43:58.320 align:start position:0%
that creates an impact in the lived
 
01:44:00.229 --> 01:44:00.239 align:start position:0%
experience of people with intellectual
 
01:44:01.910 --> 01:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
disabilities and developmental
 
01:44:04.109 --> 01:44:04.119 align:start position:0%
disabilities in New Hampshire and so a
 
01:44:06.790 --> 01:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
lot of our staff we roll up our sleeves
 
01:44:09.870 --> 01:44:09.880 align:start position:0%
and we're out there doing projects where
 
01:44:12.709 --> 01:44:12.719 align:start position:0%
in the community supporting initiatives
 
01:44:15.510 --> 01:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
and um putting on trainings we do a fair
 
01:44:17.790 --> 01:44:17.800 align:start position:0%
amount of technical assistance on things
 
01:44:21.310 --> 01:44:21.320 align:start position:0%
like plain language and accessibility I
 
01:44:23.470 --> 01:44:23.480 align:start position:0%
like to boast that we were the first
 
01:44:27.109 --> 01:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
state agency to push doit to have an
 
01:44:30.070 --> 01:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
accessibility icon on our website for
 
01:44:34.070 --> 01:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
people with uh different um access needs
 
01:44:36.550 --> 01:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
and functional needs for accessing
 
01:44:40.109 --> 01:44:40.119 align:start position:0%
information um so we are very kind of
 
01:44:43.870 --> 01:44:43.880 align:start position:0%
community-based and um a lot of our uh
 
01:44:46.830 --> 01:44:46.840 align:start position:0%
staff time is spent supporting Community
 
01:44:49.390 --> 01:44:49.400 align:start position:0%
initiatives and projects the other way
 
01:44:53.070 --> 01:44:53.080 align:start position:0%
we support our mission and our goals is
 
01:44:55.070 --> 01:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
through a small grants program so we
 
01:44:57.350 --> 01:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
have several small grants available to
 
01:44:59.550 --> 01:44:59.560 align:start position:0%
community members who experience
 
01:45:01.470 --> 01:45:01.480 align:start position:0%
intellectual and developmental
 
01:45:05.870 --> 01:45:05.880 align:start position:0%
disabilities um to agencies or groups
 
01:45:09.550 --> 01:45:09.560 align:start position:0%
that want to put on accessible community
 
01:45:13.229 --> 01:45:13.239 align:start position:0%
events or um training initiatives to
 
01:45:16.270 --> 01:45:16.280 align:start position:0%
help build capacity and access in New
 
01:45:17.910 --> 01:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for people with lived
 
01:45:19.270 --> 01:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
experience of intellectual and
 
01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:20.550 align:start position:0%
experience of intellectual and
developmental

01:45:20.550 --> 01:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
developmental
 
01:45:23.709 --> 01:45:23.719 align:start position:0%
disabilities um and so we depend on our
 
01:45:25.669 --> 01:45:25.679 align:start position:0%
Partnerships and we partner with a
 
01:45:28.390 --> 01:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
number of different state agencies by
 
01:45:31.270 --> 01:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
law at least 60% of our Council
 
01:45:33.589 --> 01:45:33.599 align:start position:0%
membership and we actually have more
 
01:45:35.990 --> 01:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
because a lot of our agency seats are
 
01:45:37.870 --> 01:45:37.880 align:start position:0%
also family members with lived
 
01:45:39.750 --> 01:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
experience of intellectual and
 
01:45:42.149 --> 01:45:42.159 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities must be
 
01:45:44.629 --> 01:45:44.639 align:start position:0%
people from the community and parents
 
01:45:46.709 --> 01:45:46.719 align:start position:0%
and guardians of individuals from the
 
01:45:49.470 --> 01:45:49.480 align:start position:0%
community so that our work is led by the
 
01:45:51.990 --> 01:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
people most impacted by the initiatives
 
01:45:53.830 --> 01:45:53.840 align:start position:0%
that we support
 
01:45:57.990 --> 01:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
um our budget I will go into our budget
 
01:45:59.950 --> 01:45:59.960 align:start position:0%
so we develop a fiveyear plan we have a
 
01:46:03.790 --> 01:46:03.800 align:start position:0%
state plan um we have a fun infographic
 
01:46:06.830 --> 01:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
on one of the handouts uh that it's
 
01:46:09.270 --> 01:46:09.280 align:start position:0%
related to our Five-Year Plan we do a
 
01:46:13.750 --> 01:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
lot of like I said um advocacy capacity
 
01:46:16.149 --> 01:46:16.159 align:start position:0%
building and participate in systems
 
01:46:19.030 --> 01:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
change activities we are on a lot of
 
01:46:21.229 --> 01:46:21.239 align:start position:0%
other commissions councils and groups
 
01:46:23.350 --> 01:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
and organizations to really bring the
 
01:46:26.350 --> 01:46:26.360 align:start position:0%
voice of people with disabilities to the
 
01:46:29.510 --> 01:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
work that's being done in New Hampshire
 
01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:30.990 align:start position:0%
work that's being done in New Hampshire
um

01:46:30.990 --> 01:46:31.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:34.510 --> 01:46:34.520 align:start position:0%
and our budget is pretty
 
01:46:37.669 --> 01:46:37.679 align:start position:0%
straightforward um the only prioritized
 
01:46:40.550 --> 01:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
needs that we had were numbers that were
 
01:46:43.790 --> 01:46:43.800 align:start position:0%
given to us by doit I think it's
 
01:46:49.629 --> 01:46:49.639 align:start position:0%
$16 in one year and $9 in the next um
 
01:46:53.589 --> 01:46:53.599 align:start position:0%
and we are hopeful that we will continue
 
01:46:56.470 --> 01:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
to be level funded that's the that's the
 
01:46:57.510 --> 01:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
best case
 
01:47:02.669 --> 01:47:02.679 align:start position:0%
scenario um at this point I think um and
 
01:47:04.950 --> 01:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions
 
01:47:07.669 --> 01:47:07.679 align:start position:0%
specifically about the budget but really
 
01:47:10.350 --> 01:47:10.360 align:start position:0%
like we are a program right and and our
 
01:47:13.990 --> 01:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
people are on the ground really uh
 
01:47:16.149 --> 01:47:16.159 align:start position:0%
creating opportunities supporting
 
01:47:18.709 --> 01:47:18.719 align:start position:0%
initiatives and removing barriers for
 
01:47:22.950 --> 01:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
people to access their community
 
01:47:25.629 --> 01:47:25.639 align:start position:0%
thank you um question that I'm not sure
 
01:47:26.750 --> 01:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
you're going to be able to answer but I
 
01:47:28.629 --> 01:47:28.639 align:start position:0%
just want to get you thinking about it
 
01:47:30.350 --> 01:47:30.360 align:start position:0%
you you you you said best case scenario
 
01:47:31.910 --> 01:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
is level funding you obviously you're
 
01:47:34.470 --> 01:47:34.480 align:start position:0%
federally funded yes uh the
 
01:47:37.310 --> 01:47:37.320 align:start position:0%
incoming ad Administration has made it
 
01:47:39.310 --> 01:47:39.320 align:start position:0%
very clear that they're starting this
 
01:47:40.790 --> 01:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
office of government efficiency looking
 
01:47:44.430 --> 01:47:44.440 align:start position:0%
to cut upwards of and if you listen to
 
01:47:46.310 --> 01:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
the the heads of the commission up to
 
01:47:48.870 --> 01:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
two trillion doll from the federal from
 
01:47:52.950 --> 01:47:52.960 align:start position:0%
the federal budget uh how secure is your
 
01:47:55.830 --> 01:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
funding for the next I know you
 
01:47:57.229 --> 01:47:57.239 align:start position:0%
obviously can't say anything beyond the
 
01:48:00.270 --> 01:48:00.280 align:start position:0%
the future banians but for this bium is
 
01:48:02.030 --> 01:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
is this something that's baked in and
 
01:48:03.910 --> 01:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
we're worried about future or or this
 
01:48:05.910 --> 01:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
bium you're concerned about as well it's
 
01:48:07.870 --> 01:48:07.880 align:start position:0%
not so the only thank you for the
 
01:48:10.030 --> 01:48:10.040 align:start position:0%
question so the only thing for sure is
 
01:48:11.830 --> 01:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
that we're funded through the continuing
 
01:48:13.589 --> 01:48:13.599 align:start position:0%
resolution so we have received our
 
01:48:22.910 --> 01:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:25.229 --> 01:48:25.239 align:start position:0%
again the amount of money that we get is
 
01:48:28.030 --> 01:48:28.040 align:start position:0%
determined by Congress from one year to
 
01:48:31.470 --> 01:48:31.480 align:start position:0%
the next we do have a lot of disability
 
01:48:34.030 --> 01:48:34.040 align:start position:0%
affects everybody right you don't it
 
01:48:36.990 --> 01:48:37.000 align:start position:0%
it's not B political party thankfully so
 
01:48:39.510 --> 01:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of allies in Congress that
 
01:48:42.950 --> 01:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
get it that understand that this is uh
 
01:48:48.430 --> 01:48:48.440 align:start position:0%
this These funds are impactful and um
 
01:48:50.629 --> 01:48:50.639 align:start position:0%
really change people's lives and allow
 
01:48:53.629 --> 01:48:53.639 align:start position:0%
for inclusion so
 
01:48:57.070 --> 01:48:57.080 align:start position:0%
Although our hope is that um we will
 
01:49:01.669 --> 01:49:01.679 align:start position:0%
continue to be level funded um I the
 
01:49:05.310 --> 01:49:05.320 align:start position:0%
last time that um this president was in
 
01:49:10.070 --> 01:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
office there was an attempt to defund um
 
01:49:13.149 --> 01:49:13.159 align:start position:0%
DD councils or significantly reduce the
 
01:49:17.189 --> 01:49:17.199 align:start position:0%
funding which which is alarming to us so
 
01:49:21.430 --> 01:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
um you know we're going to continue to
 
01:49:23.470 --> 01:49:23.480 align:start position:0%
do the best we can with with the
 
01:49:27.510 --> 01:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
whatever we've got um but uh it is a
 
01:49:30.669 --> 01:49:30.679 align:start position:0%
little in unsure and we are a little
 
01:49:35.270 --> 01:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:38.510 --> 01:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
bring um hi thank you for everything you
 
01:49:41.430 --> 01:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
do um I keep moving it closer I can't
 
01:49:44.950 --> 01:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
help myself um how long have you been
 
01:49:47.669 --> 01:49:47.679 align:start position:0%
with the council so I have been there
 
01:49:50.510 --> 01:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
over eight and a half years now okay oh
 
01:49:52.390 --> 01:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
so then when we first met you were new
 
01:49:54.310 --> 01:49:54.320 align:start position:0%
yes oh I didn't realize that I thought
 
01:49:57.669 --> 01:49:57.679 align:start position:0%
you were a veteran um uh which is uh
 
01:49:59.270 --> 01:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
telling I I would just say in the
 
01:50:01.830 --> 01:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
interest of um offering security where
 
01:50:04.270 --> 01:50:04.280 align:start position:0%
there's none actually available um
 
01:50:06.109 --> 01:50:06.119 align:start position:0%
you're right about multiple parties so
 
01:50:09.390 --> 01:50:09.400 align:start position:0%
the the outgoing Governor um came into
 
01:50:11.430 --> 01:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
office with a with a mission to
 
01:50:13.709 --> 01:50:13.719 align:start position:0%
streamline and cut government and pass
 
01:50:16.030 --> 01:50:16.040 align:start position:0%
the largest funding of of DD programs in
 
01:50:18.550 --> 01:50:18.560 align:start position:0%
the history of the state and so there is
 
01:50:20.310 --> 01:50:20.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of cross party support for things
 
01:50:22.910 --> 01:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
for things like that am I also right
 
01:50:26.270 --> 01:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
that um by federal statute or law you
 
01:50:28.830 --> 01:50:28.840 align:start position:0%
cannot be part of another agency you're
 
01:50:31.470 --> 01:50:31.480 align:start position:0%
required to be independent so that that
 
01:50:36.470 --> 01:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
is a great question um with the
 
01:50:39.510 --> 01:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
reauthorization of the DD act in
 
01:50:42.709 --> 01:50:42.719 align:start position:0%
2000 what that said was that we cannot
 
01:50:45.430 --> 01:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
be part of
 
01:50:49.550 --> 01:50:49.560 align:start position:0%
DHHS because that would be like our
 
01:50:53.189 --> 01:50:53.199 align:start position:0%
advocacy includes challenging
 
01:50:56.310 --> 01:50:56.320 align:start position:0%
supports and services that are either
 
01:50:59.030 --> 01:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
inequitable or that create access needs
 
01:51:01.709 --> 01:51:01.719 align:start position:0%
for people with disabilities our members
 
01:51:06.189 --> 01:51:06.199 align:start position:0%
advocate for continued funding of DD
 
01:51:11.950 --> 01:51:11.960 align:start position:0%
Services um and so it it is not allowed
 
01:51:14.069 --> 01:51:14.079 align:start position:0%
for us to be part of a
 
01:51:17.030 --> 01:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
DHHS however some councils do have
 
01:51:20.149 --> 01:51:20.159 align:start position:0%
what's called a designated state agency
 
01:51:22.750 --> 01:51:22.760 align:start position:0%
which is simply a pass through of the
 
01:51:28.270 --> 01:51:28.280 align:start position:0%
funding so that would be um some agency
 
01:51:30.030 --> 01:51:30.040 align:start position:0%
that can offer some level of
 
01:51:32.109 --> 01:51:32.119 align:start position:0%
administrative support so be more like
 
01:51:34.069 --> 01:51:34.079 align:start position:0%
administratively attached not that that
 
01:51:35.950 --> 01:51:35.960 align:start position:0%
would be okay but part of another agency
 
01:51:40.430 --> 01:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:43.270 --> 01:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
m seeing no further questions thank you
 
01:51:49.950 --> 01:51:49.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:52.270 --> 01:51:52.280 align:start position:0%

you know what we do in our budget book
 
01:53:00.669 --> 01:53:00.679 align:start position:0%
handout provides a little more detail of
 
01:53:02.069 --> 01:53:02.079 align:start position:0%
the different
 
01:53:04.790 --> 01:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
organizational um codes and what they do
 
01:53:06.510 --> 01:53:06.520 align:start position:0%
and and some of the accomplishments
 
01:53:09.350 --> 01:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
there but um I wanted to try to simplify
 
01:53:12.149 --> 01:53:12.159 align:start position:0%
uh simplify it and condense it into our
 
01:53:14.109 --> 01:53:14.119 align:start position:0%
um agency budget presentation which you
 
01:53:16.109 --> 01:53:16.119 align:start position:0%
should have a copy of the of the handout
 
01:53:18.950 --> 01:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
for so that's what um I will follow
 
01:53:21.189 --> 01:53:21.199 align:start position:0%
along with and on page two of that
 
01:53:21.199 --> 01:53:22.950 align:start position:0%
along with and on page two of that
presentation

01:53:22.950 --> 01:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
01:53:26.069 --> 01:53:26.079 align:start position:0%
um it it discusses our purpose and and
 
01:53:28.709 --> 01:53:28.719 align:start position:0%
Mission and at dot we work very hard
 
01:53:30.709 --> 01:53:30.719 align:start position:0%
every day to provide transportation
 
01:53:32.830 --> 01:53:32.840 align:start position:0%
excellence and enhancing the quality of
 
01:53:34.830 --> 01:53:34.840 align:start position:0%
life in New Hampshire our purpose is to
 
01:53:37.830 --> 01:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
provide quality Transportation projects
 
01:53:41.669 --> 01:53:41.679 align:start position:0%
and services for all users in a safe
 
01:53:45.430 --> 01:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
efficient and timely timely manner on
 
01:53:47.870 --> 01:53:47.880 align:start position:0%
slide three uh we give an overview of
 
01:53:50.870 --> 01:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
the department organizational structure
 
01:53:53.550 --> 01:53:53.560 align:start position:0%
um generally I wanted to walk through
 
01:53:55.589 --> 01:53:55.599 align:start position:0%
this presentation to let you know who we
 
01:53:58.310 --> 01:53:58.320 align:start position:0%
are what we do and what we've done to
 
01:54:01.030 --> 01:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
meet the budget targets um the
 
01:54:03.510 --> 01:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
department is made up of five major
 
01:54:06.030 --> 01:54:06.040 align:start position:0%
divisions and the budget presentation
 
01:54:07.750 --> 01:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
and structure of this presentation is
 
01:54:10.470 --> 01:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
going to kind of follow those um it's
 
01:54:11.709 --> 01:54:11.719 align:start position:0%
going to be structured around the
 
01:54:15.030 --> 01:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
individual uh divisions so um on that
 
01:54:18.950 --> 01:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
org chart um I uh I'm I'm here as the
 
01:54:20.270 --> 01:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner assistant commissioner
 
01:54:22.430 --> 01:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner and then underneath
 
01:54:24.550 --> 01:54:24.560 align:start position:0%
the directors of the five five divisions
 
01:54:27.109 --> 01:54:27.119 align:start position:0%
project development operations Finance
 
01:54:29.830 --> 01:54:29.840 align:start position:0%
Aeronautics Rail and Transit policy and
 
01:54:31.990 --> 01:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
administration and on the outside of
 
01:54:34.229 --> 01:54:34.239 align:start position:0%
that are are our safety section and
 
01:54:36.390 --> 01:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
asset management performance who report
 
01:54:39.669 --> 01:54:39.679 align:start position:0%
directly to the uh commissioner office
 
01:54:43.709 --> 01:54:43.719 align:start position:0%
and currently uh do is comprised of uh
 
01:54:46.910 --> 01:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
approximately six uh uh
 
01:54:50.109 --> 01:54:50.119 align:start position:0%
1650 um permanent full-time
 
01:54:53.229 --> 01:54:53.239 align:start position:0%
positions on page
 
01:54:56.870 --> 01:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
um four is a funding summary of the
 
01:54:58.589 --> 01:54:58.599 align:start position:0%
overall Department budget and some of
 
01:55:01.030 --> 01:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
the challenges that that that we have in
 
01:55:03.189 --> 01:55:03.199 align:start position:0%
explaining the budget is the complexity
 
01:55:05.629 --> 01:55:05.639 align:start position:0%
of our of our funding so we're funded
 
01:55:09.950 --> 01:55:09.960 align:start position:0%
from four um uh funding sources
 
01:55:12.550 --> 01:55:12.560 align:start position:0%
primarily uh Turnpike funds Highway
 
01:55:16.270 --> 01:55:16.280 align:start position:0%
funds General funds and uh federal funds
 
01:55:18.350 --> 01:55:18.360 align:start position:0%
um other funds are also mixed in there
 
01:55:21.229 --> 01:55:21.239 align:start position:0%
which um includes betterment and
 
01:55:25.310 --> 01:55:25.320 align:start position:0%
typically um restricted uh Highway fund
 
01:55:28.149 --> 01:55:28.159 align:start position:0%
Revenue that that's categorized as other
 
01:55:31.589 --> 01:55:31.599 align:start position:0%
funds but um the percentages of the
 
01:55:34.390 --> 01:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
budget and there and uh each different
 
01:55:37.350 --> 01:55:37.360 align:start position:0%
division each different program uses um
 
01:55:39.510 --> 01:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
different types of funding ma uh funding
 
01:55:42.510 --> 01:55:42.520 align:start position:0%
allocations but bottom line if you look
 
01:55:44.229 --> 01:55:44.239 align:start position:0%
we've really tried to hold the line on
 
01:55:46.589 --> 01:55:46.599 align:start position:0%
on our budget if you look at the overall
 
01:55:49.229 --> 01:55:49.239 align:start position:0%
Department budget uh for
 
01:55:49.239 --> 01:55:51.229 align:start position:0%
Department budget uh for
2026

01:55:51.229 --> 01:55:51.239 align:start position:0%
2026
 
01:55:55.069 --> 01:55:55.079 align:start position:0%
796.3151 milon it's it's uh virtually
 
01:55:57.870 --> 01:55:57.880 align:start position:0%
the same as the current 2025 adjusted
 
01:56:01.189 --> 01:56:01.199 align:start position:0%
authorized as far as the total budget on
 
01:56:04.069 --> 01:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
page five is a little bit more um
 
01:56:06.390 --> 01:56:06.400 align:start position:0%
granularity of of the agency budget and
 
01:56:08.270 --> 01:56:08.280 align:start position:0%
we usually try to present and talk about
 
01:56:12.430 --> 01:56:12.440 align:start position:0%
our budget in two major uh components um
 
01:56:14.870 --> 01:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
on the left of those pie charts and blue
 
01:56:16.629 --> 01:56:16.639 align:start position:0%
is the municipal Aid and
 
01:56:19.189 --> 01:56:19.199 align:start position:0%
construction um component of our budget
 
01:56:20.629 --> 01:56:20.639 align:start position:0%
a lot of that is the pass through
 
01:56:22.990 --> 01:56:23.000 align:start position:0%
federal dollars that go to
 
01:56:25.990 --> 01:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
um the uh federal aid programs our
 
01:56:28.430 --> 01:56:28.440 align:start position:0%
Highway program our bridge program and
 
01:56:30.310 --> 01:56:30.320 align:start position:0%
the priorities and constraints for those
 
01:56:33.470 --> 01:56:33.480 align:start position:0%
programs are largely discussed um as
 
01:56:36.109 --> 01:56:36.119 align:start position:0%
part of the 10-year plan process which
 
01:56:38.950 --> 01:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
goes which which um takes place on an
 
01:56:42.069 --> 01:56:42.079 align:start position:0%
off budget year but the funding is
 
01:56:44.669 --> 01:56:44.679 align:start position:0%
obviously reflected in our budget the
 
01:56:46.510 --> 01:56:46.520 align:start position:0%
right side of those pie charts which is
 
01:56:49.510 --> 01:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
the operating um budget is really
 
01:56:52.310 --> 01:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
represents the op you know the um what
 
01:56:54.550 --> 01:56:54.560 align:start position:0%
it is to operate and maintain the
 
01:56:56.109 --> 01:56:56.119 align:start position:0%
operation system and is really kind of
 
01:56:58.750 --> 01:56:58.760 align:start position:0%
the focus tends to be the focus of our
 
01:57:00.229 --> 01:57:00.239 align:start position:0%
of our budget presentation and our
 
01:57:02.510 --> 01:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
budget discussions at this time of year
 
01:57:04.430 --> 01:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
the breakdowns of that are shown at the
 
01:57:06.270 --> 01:57:06.280 align:start position:0%
bottom in that
 
01:57:10.350 --> 01:57:10.360 align:start position:0%
chart on page six is um uh a couple of
 
01:57:12.870 --> 01:57:12.880 align:start position:0%
charts that just highlight uh a couple
 
01:57:14.830 --> 01:57:14.840 align:start position:0%
of the issues one of the big issues the
 
01:57:16.950 --> 01:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
challenge that we continue to have is is
 
01:57:20.109 --> 01:57:20.119 align:start position:0%
Workforce Staffing uh and a continued
 
01:57:23.350 --> 01:57:23.360 align:start position:0%
elevated vacancy rate the bottom chart
 
01:57:27.430 --> 01:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
um shows um budgeted filled positions
 
01:57:30.629 --> 01:57:30.639 align:start position:0%
versus uh versus um um budgeted
 
01:57:33.189 --> 01:57:33.199 align:start position:0%
positions versus filled positions and
 
01:57:35.030 --> 01:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
for the last several years we've been
 
01:57:39.709 --> 01:57:39.719 align:start position:0%
running uh on average a 203 to 25%
 
01:57:43.950 --> 01:57:43.960 align:start position:0%
overall agency uh vacancy rate um some
 
01:57:46.589 --> 01:57:46.599 align:start position:0%
some bureaus some areas uh higher than
 
01:57:49.629 --> 01:57:49.639 align:start position:0%
others um but it is a A continuing
 
01:57:52.830 --> 01:57:52.840 align:start position:0%
Challenge on the top chart uh represents
 
01:57:55.950 --> 01:57:55.960 align:start position:0%
a historical look at budgeted budgeted
 
01:57:58.830 --> 01:57:58.840 align:start position:0%
positions um and overlaid with that is
 
01:58:01.430 --> 01:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
vehicle miles traveled which which
 
01:58:04.350 --> 01:58:04.360 align:start position:0%
indicates you know kind of a use of the
 
01:58:06.350 --> 01:58:06.360 align:start position:0%
overall transportation system and what I
 
01:58:09.270 --> 01:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
like about this chart is it it does show
 
01:58:12.550 --> 01:58:12.560 align:start position:0%
that historically um we have cut um to
 
01:58:16.790 --> 01:58:16.800 align:start position:0%
be as efficient as possible and we um
 
01:58:19.470 --> 01:58:19.480 align:start position:0%
continue to serve increasing utilization
 
01:58:21.830 --> 01:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
of the transportation system with with
 
01:58:24.990 --> 01:58:25.000 align:start position:0%
few your people and um I think it
 
01:58:26.790 --> 01:58:26.800 align:start position:0%
highlights an efficient organization and
 
01:58:28.950 --> 01:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
we continue to do more with
 
01:58:28.960 --> 01:58:30.709 align:start position:0%
we continue to do more with
less

01:58:30.709 --> 01:58:30.719 align:start position:0%
less
 
01:58:33.390 --> 01:58:33.400 align:start position:0%
um and as I start into the presentation
 
01:58:34.990 --> 01:58:35.000 align:start position:0%
I I I'm going to kind of go through
 
01:58:37.310 --> 01:58:37.320 align:start position:0%
quick in the interest of of time but
 
01:58:40.030 --> 01:58:40.040 align:start position:0%
please um uh we can need take questions
 
01:58:41.350 --> 01:58:41.360 align:start position:0%
at the end but don't hesitate to
 
01:58:42.990 --> 01:58:43.000 align:start position:0%
interrupt me if there are questions as
 
01:58:45.589 --> 01:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
as as we go if there's something not not
 
01:58:51.390 --> 01:58:51.400 align:start position:0%
clear um but on page um on slide um
 
01:58:51.400 --> 01:58:52.709 align:start position:0%
clear um but on page um on slide um

seven
 
01:58:54.990 --> 01:58:55.000 align:start position:0%
represents uh the budget targets that we
 
01:58:56.790 --> 01:58:56.800 align:start position:0%
were given so the department had three
 
01:58:58.750 --> 01:58:58.760 align:start position:0%
budget targets to meet our general fund
 
01:59:01.149 --> 01:59:01.159 align:start position:0%
budget Target was uh 1 Point
 
01:59:03.149 --> 01:59:03.159 align:start position:0%
approximately $1.8
 
01:59:06.069 --> 01:59:06.079 align:start position:0%
million um it's approximately a 10%
 
01:59:08.550 --> 01:59:08.560 align:start position:0%
decrease from our FY 25 adjusted
 
01:59:10.669 --> 01:59:10.679 align:start position:0%
authorized the turnpike fund and the
 
01:59:14.470 --> 01:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
highway fund budget targets were um were
 
01:59:16.790 --> 01:59:16.800 align:start position:0%
were were level funded targets with flat
 
01:59:19.189 --> 01:59:19.199 align:start position:0%
budget targets and we'll talk through
 
01:59:22.270 --> 01:59:22.280 align:start position:0%
this presentation on how we um met the
 
01:59:24.589 --> 01:59:24.599 align:start position:0%
targets for each of the organizational
 
01:59:26.990 --> 01:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
divisions um in the interest of
 
01:59:29.470 --> 01:59:29.480 align:start position:0%
Simplicity we've kind of rolled up uh a
 
01:59:34.550 --> 01:59:34.560 align:start position:0%
number of the uh budget um divisions uh
 
01:59:37.709 --> 01:59:37.719 align:start position:0%
in the in in and organizational units
 
01:59:39.990 --> 01:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
under the general organizational titles
 
01:59:42.910 --> 01:59:42.920 align:start position:0%
and that bottom chart represents um kind
 
01:59:46.270 --> 01:59:46.280 align:start position:0%
of a a crosswalk of how we've
 
01:59:49.669 --> 01:59:49.679 align:start position:0%
um rolled up some of those um budget
 
01:59:52.229 --> 01:59:52.239 align:start position:0%
things but generally I wanted to kind of
 
01:59:53.709 --> 01:59:53.719 align:start position:0%
walk through the divisions and how the
 
01:59:56.069 --> 01:59:56.079 align:start position:0%
budget targets were met um give some of
 
01:59:57.709 --> 01:59:57.719 align:start position:0%
the implications of the budget but I
 
01:59:59.229 --> 01:59:59.239 align:start position:0%
also wanted to highlight some of the
 
02:00:00.990 --> 02:00:01.000 align:start position:0%
accomplishments because even though we
 
02:00:04.229 --> 02:00:04.239 align:start position:0%
do have Workforce challenges um I do
 
02:00:07.310 --> 02:00:07.320 align:start position:0%
think we are um accomplishing a lot of a
 
02:00:09.189 --> 02:00:09.199 align:start position:0%
lot of good
 
02:00:14.229 --> 02:00:14.239 align:start position:0%
things so on on page eight is a um is a
 
02:00:16.229 --> 02:00:16.239 align:start position:0%
summary of the division of the
 
02:00:19.510 --> 02:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
Aeronautics Rail and Transit and this is
 
02:00:22.550 --> 02:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
a small Division and this is the only
 
02:00:24.910 --> 02:00:24.920 align:start position:0%
General funded position in uh General
 
02:00:27.510 --> 02:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
funded division in the department and
 
02:00:30.950 --> 02:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
this represents that $1.8 million um
 
02:00:33.310 --> 02:00:33.320 align:start position:0%
general fund uh budget Target that we
 
02:00:35.030 --> 02:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
were given that supports this division
 
02:00:37.189 --> 02:00:37.199 align:start position:0%
it's about 20 positions in the
 
02:00:40.189 --> 02:00:40.199 align:start position:0%
division um and uh we met the budget
 
02:00:44.550 --> 02:00:44.560 align:start position:0%
targets by a couple of things um we
 
02:00:49.669 --> 02:00:49.679 align:start position:0%
um uh we shifted one one of two um uas
 
02:00:52.030 --> 02:00:52.040 align:start position:0%
positions uh to be a highway funed
 
02:00:55.629 --> 02:00:55.639 align:start position:0%
position um primarily that that position
 
02:00:58.229 --> 02:00:58.239 align:start position:0%
serves um the highway program and we
 
02:01:01.709 --> 02:01:01.719 align:start position:0%
felt it was uh appropriate and um but
 
02:01:03.550 --> 02:01:03.560 align:start position:0%
that position will now be restricted to
 
02:01:08.310 --> 02:01:08.320 align:start position:0%
only Highway funded needs um per per the
 
02:01:11.550 --> 02:01:11.560 align:start position:0%
highway fund um restrictions one of the
 
02:01:13.669 --> 02:01:13.679 align:start position:0%
other components of this uh of this
 
02:01:17.109 --> 02:01:17.119 align:start position:0%
division Last by enum the legislature
 
02:01:21.390 --> 02:01:21.400 align:start position:0%
funded an increased State match for uh
 
02:01:21.400 --> 02:01:22.470 align:start position:0%
funded an increased State match for uh
Transit

02:01:22.470 --> 02:01:22.480 align:start position:0%
Transit
 
02:01:25.589 --> 02:01:25.599 align:start position:0%
services and um with the budget targets
 
02:01:28.510 --> 02:01:28.520 align:start position:0%
we were given we were unable to you know
 
02:01:31.950 --> 02:01:31.960 align:start position:0%
continue that operating match it uh
 
02:01:36.750 --> 02:01:36.760 align:start position:0%
equals about $1.7 million per year um
 
02:01:39.149 --> 02:01:39.159 align:start position:0%
pass by inum there was a lot of advocacy
 
02:01:44.669 --> 02:01:44.679 align:start position:0%
from the transit industry for for um um
 
02:01:46.750 --> 02:01:46.760 align:start position:0%
increased State support for transit
 
02:01:48.669 --> 02:01:48.679 align:start position:0%
services but with the budget targets we
 
02:01:51.990 --> 02:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
had uh this is one of the budget impli
 
02:01:54.669 --> 02:01:54.679 align:start position:0%
ations that we aren't able to fund that
 
02:01:58.149 --> 02:01:58.159 align:start position:0%
um in this bium um and it impedes public
 
02:02:00.390 --> 02:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
transit agencies ability to match
 
02:02:02.069 --> 02:02:02.079 align:start position:0%
federal funds and and potentially
 
02:02:02.079 --> 02:02:03.069 align:start position:0%
federal funds and and potentially
deliver

02:02:03.069 --> 02:02:03.079 align:start position:0%
deliver
 
02:02:06.030 --> 02:02:06.040 align:start position:0%
services so one of the factors to
 
02:02:09.830 --> 02:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
consider in this um in this division
 
02:02:11.790 --> 02:02:11.800 align:start position:0%
even though it's a small number it it
 
02:02:13.669 --> 02:02:13.679 align:start position:0%
administers pass through a lot of
 
02:02:15.709 --> 02:02:15.719 align:start position:0%
federal funds so the FAA the the
 
02:02:17.669 --> 02:02:17.679 align:start position:0%
Aeronautics funding and the transit
 
02:02:21.030 --> 02:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
funding that that runs that passes
 
02:02:22.709 --> 02:02:22.719 align:start position:0%
through this division
 
02:02:26.629 --> 02:02:26.639 align:start position:0%
um and administered by by by the by the
 
02:02:29.870 --> 02:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
staff um so the escalating indirect
 
02:02:33.310 --> 02:02:33.320 align:start position:0%
costs of a small of a small Bureau um
 
02:02:34.910 --> 02:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
you know they have to be absorbed and
 
02:02:37.550 --> 02:02:37.560 align:start position:0%
can compete with other other services
 
02:02:39.470 --> 02:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
within the general funds make it
 
02:02:41.629 --> 02:02:41.639 align:start position:0%
difficult to
 
02:02:45.910 --> 02:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
um um address and and meet those needs
 
02:02:48.350 --> 02:02:48.360 align:start position:0%
um the other area within this division
 
02:02:51.510 --> 02:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
um we know that um there is a lot of
 
02:02:56.510 --> 02:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
demand and for um increased um
 
02:03:00.629 --> 02:03:00.639 align:start position:0%
recreational use of our un un unused uh
 
02:03:03.030 --> 02:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
railroad corridors that the that the
 
02:03:06.550 --> 02:03:06.560 align:start position:0%
that this division is responsible for um
 
02:03:09.149 --> 02:03:09.159 align:start position:0%
and we really uh are not in a position
 
02:03:11.669 --> 02:03:11.679 align:start position:0%
to uh respond to significant effects
 
02:03:13.310 --> 02:03:13.320 align:start position:0%
we've had a lot of storm damage and
 
02:03:16.229 --> 02:03:16.239 align:start position:0%
stuff and there's a lot of demand for um
 
02:03:19.189 --> 02:03:19.199 align:start position:0%
you know use of of rail Trails um that
 
02:03:22.030 --> 02:03:22.040 align:start position:0%
that we continue to have trouble um
 
02:03:24.910 --> 02:03:24.920 align:start position:0%
meeting but with that said uh you know
 
02:03:26.229 --> 02:03:26.239 align:start position:0%
some of the accomplishments in this
 
02:03:28.709 --> 02:03:28.719 align:start position:0%
Bureau over the last bium there was a
 
02:03:30.550 --> 02:03:30.560 align:start position:0%
substantial increase in federal relief
 
02:03:33.589 --> 02:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
funding for for airports and Transit and
 
02:03:35.669 --> 02:03:35.679 align:start position:0%
uh with the same number of people these
 
02:03:38.629 --> 02:03:38.639 align:start position:0%
the the folks stepped up and had um um
 
02:03:38.639 --> 02:03:39.660 align:start position:0%
the the folks stepped up and had um um
administered

02:03:39.660 --> 02:03:39.670 align:start position:0%
administered
 
02:03:39.670 --> 02:03:41.109 align:start position:0%
administered
[Music]

02:03:41.109 --> 02:03:41.119 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:03:44.470 --> 02:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
um uh the additional uh relief uh the
 
02:03:46.350 --> 02:03:46.360 align:start position:0%
additional funding and grants that came
 
02:03:50.030 --> 02:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
through here um we are also um actively
 
02:03:53.709 --> 02:03:53.719 align:start position:0%
implementing the unmanned aerial systems
 
02:03:56.109 --> 02:03:56.119 align:start position:0%
uh those are drones that's the uh uas
 
02:03:58.189 --> 02:03:58.199 align:start position:0%
implementation and looking to integrate
 
02:04:00.229 --> 02:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
with other
 
02:04:03.350 --> 02:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
agencies so that uh when you looked at
 
02:04:05.589 --> 02:04:05.599 align:start position:0%
the slide the slide before of the budget
 
02:04:09.069 --> 02:04:09.079 align:start position:0%
summary this $1.8 million is a very uh
 
02:04:10.750 --> 02:04:10.760 align:start position:0%
small drawer on the general fund
 
02:04:12.830 --> 02:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
comparatively and this is the only
 
02:04:15.390 --> 02:04:15.400 align:start position:0%
division that draws on the general fund
 
02:04:17.950 --> 02:04:17.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:21.270 --> 02:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
dot the next slide slide nine uh just
 
02:04:24.270 --> 02:04:24.280 align:start position:0%
summarizing izes uh the uh division of
 
02:04:27.549 --> 02:04:27.559 align:start position:0%
finance um on the right there summarizes
 
02:04:29.189 --> 02:04:29.199 align:start position:0%
the uh Finance Bureau and their roles
 
02:04:29.199 --> 02:04:29.990 align:start position:0%
the uh Finance Bureau and their roles
and

02:04:29.990 --> 02:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:04:31.990 --> 02:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
responsibilities uh as far as accounting
 
02:04:37.229 --> 02:04:37.239 align:start position:0%
operations payroll audit and um uh Etc
 
02:04:39.629 --> 02:04:39.639 align:start position:0%
uh to meet budget targets here one of
 
02:04:41.790 --> 02:04:41.800 align:start position:0%
the things we did was reduce um
 
02:04:44.870 --> 02:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
positions we uh reduced two full-time
 
02:04:47.549 --> 02:04:47.559 align:start position:0%
positions one permanent one
 
02:04:51.709 --> 02:04:51.719 align:start position:0%
temporary um and we've also had to um
 
02:04:53.950 --> 02:04:53.960 align:start position:0%
look closely at print shop equipment
 
02:04:57.310 --> 02:04:57.320 align:start position:0%
purchases and and and reduce that and uh
 
02:04:59.669 --> 02:04:59.679 align:start position:0%
we're looking in the FY 27 budget at
 
02:05:02.430 --> 02:05:02.440 align:start position:0%
deeper Cuts in overtime temporary help
 
02:05:04.069 --> 02:05:04.079 align:start position:0%
and equipment and supplies in order to
 
02:05:06.910 --> 02:05:06.920 align:start position:0%
meet the budget targets um one of the
 
02:05:09.510 --> 02:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
factors in this division is a been a
 
02:05:12.030 --> 02:05:12.040 align:start position:0%
high turnover a significant loss of
 
02:05:14.910 --> 02:05:14.920 align:start position:0%
historic knowledge um so some of the
 
02:05:16.950 --> 02:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
challenges are with that lack of
 
02:05:19.830 --> 02:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
experience trying to trying to keep up
 
02:05:22.149 --> 02:05:22.159 align:start position:0%
with um with everything um
 
02:05:25.750 --> 02:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
um so and it creates upward pressures on
 
02:05:27.510 --> 02:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
on overtime and other things to meet the
 
02:05:29.069 --> 02:05:29.079 align:start position:0%
budget deadlines or the financial
 
02:05:31.470 --> 02:05:31.480 align:start position:0%
reporting deadlines that come along with
 
02:05:34.669 --> 02:05:34.679 align:start position:0%
it but with that said um you know there
 
02:05:36.669 --> 02:05:36.679 align:start position:0%
are uh a number of accomplishments in
 
02:05:42.790 --> 02:05:42.800 align:start position:0%
the division um large amount of um uh uh
 
02:05:45.149 --> 02:05:45.159 align:start position:0%
payroll and payments and and uh things
 
02:05:47.950 --> 02:05:47.960 align:start position:0%
that have been processed over the year
 
02:05:50.950 --> 02:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
um the administration and programming of
 
02:05:53.310 --> 02:05:53.320 align:start position:0%
over 900 Federal projects as well as
 
02:05:55.510 --> 02:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
clean clean audit opinions on both the
 
02:05:57.950 --> 02:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
tumpike system and the federal audits
 
02:06:00.589 --> 02:06:00.599 align:start position:0%
that we deal with so and you can see by
 
02:06:02.310 --> 02:06:02.320 align:start position:0%
the by the funding charts there that
 
02:06:04.270 --> 02:06:04.280 align:start position:0%
essentially you know we've tried to hold
 
02:06:07.709 --> 02:06:07.719 align:start position:0%
level um from fy2 adjusted authorized
 
02:06:09.750 --> 02:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
through the budget all those funding
 
02:06:12.430 --> 02:06:12.440 align:start position:0%
levels and uh again most of the
 
02:06:17.069 --> 02:06:17.079 align:start position:0%
operations uh costs here are um are part
 
02:06:18.629 --> 02:06:18.639 align:start position:0%
of the highway
 
02:06:22.030 --> 02:06:22.040 align:start position:0%
fund on slide 10
 
02:06:26.109 --> 02:06:26.119 align:start position:0%
represents um the division of uh policy
 
02:06:26.119 --> 02:06:27.069 align:start position:0%
represents um the division of uh policy
and

02:06:27.069 --> 02:06:27.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:06:28.990 --> 02:06:29.000 align:start position:0%
administration and their roles and
 
02:06:30.709 --> 02:06:30.719 align:start position:0%
responsibilities are highlighted there
 
02:06:33.629 --> 02:06:33.639 align:start position:0%
on the right um this this division
 
02:06:36.430 --> 02:06:36.440 align:start position:0%
comprises um a federal compliance office
 
02:06:39.350 --> 02:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
Human Resources uh as well as public
 
02:06:42.790 --> 02:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
information and the um executive office
 
02:06:46.350 --> 02:06:46.360 align:start position:0%
as as well so um budget targets were met
 
02:06:48.270 --> 02:06:48.280 align:start position:0%
through uh eliminating temporary
 
02:06:50.669 --> 02:06:50.679 align:start position:0%
full-time position as well as reducing
 
02:06:52.790 --> 02:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
budgeted overtime time and temporary
 
02:06:55.830 --> 02:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
help um one of the budget implications
 
02:06:58.390 --> 02:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
and you see with the um permanent
 
02:07:00.790 --> 02:07:00.800 align:start position:0%
position count in the bottom right hand
 
02:07:03.470 --> 02:07:03.480 align:start position:0%
corner has been some realignment of
 
02:07:05.510 --> 02:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
personnel and you'll see some reductions
 
02:07:07.350 --> 02:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
in other divisions one of the things we
 
02:07:11.629 --> 02:07:11.639 align:start position:0%
did was put a emphasis on on safety and
 
02:07:14.510 --> 02:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
made the safety uh section a direct
 
02:07:16.990 --> 02:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
report to the commission's office to the
 
02:07:19.790 --> 02:07:19.800 align:start position:0%
chief engineer um and have a cross
 
02:07:23.030 --> 02:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
divisional focus on all things safety so
 
02:07:26.950 --> 02:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
realigning the safety section does um
 
02:07:29.189 --> 02:07:29.199 align:start position:0%
within this budget reflect in the in the
 
02:07:31.109 --> 02:07:31.119 align:start position:0%
positions and some of the funding but
 
02:07:33.270 --> 02:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
it's offset by reductions where those
 
02:07:36.830 --> 02:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
positions were moved from for net um
 
02:07:36.840 --> 02:07:38.149 align:start position:0%
positions were moved from for net um
zero

02:07:38.149 --> 02:07:38.159 align:start position:0%
zero
 
02:07:38.159 --> 02:07:40.790 align:start position:0%
zero
increase

02:07:40.790 --> 02:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
increase
 
02:07:44.390 --> 02:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
um and uh you know some of the factors
 
02:07:44.400 --> 02:07:45.430 align:start position:0%
um and uh you know some of the factors
again

02:07:45.430 --> 02:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
again
 
02:07:49.109 --> 02:07:49.119 align:start position:0%
we you know where HR is under this
 
02:07:51.030 --> 02:07:51.040 align:start position:0%
division they continue to deal with
 
02:07:53.310 --> 02:07:53.320 align:start position:0%
recruit and retention and and and trying
 
02:07:56.990 --> 02:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
to address our overall vacancy agency a
 
02:08:00.830 --> 02:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate of upwards of 24%
 
02:08:05.390 --> 02:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
um and um you know we have really
 
02:08:06.790 --> 02:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
focused on that some of our
 
02:08:09.510 --> 02:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
accomplishments in this division have
 
02:08:11.430 --> 02:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
been focused on implementing a CDL
 
02:08:14.189 --> 02:08:14.199 align:start position:0%
training program to help our uh Highway
 
02:08:17.030 --> 02:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
maintainers and help um retain some of
 
02:08:19.709 --> 02:08:19.719 align:start position:0%
those positions uh implementing an
 
02:08:22.030 --> 02:08:22.040 align:start position:0%
enhanced training program leveraging
 
02:08:24.430 --> 02:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
federal funds and working with major
 
02:08:26.430 --> 02:08:26.440 align:start position:0%
stakeholders within within the
 
02:08:30.350 --> 02:08:30.360 align:start position:0%
department to um design a robust uh
 
02:08:34.870 --> 02:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:38.510 --> 02:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
program the uh following slide slide 11
 
02:08:42.069 --> 02:08:42.079 align:start position:0%
describes uh the uh division of project
 
02:08:45.030 --> 02:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
development that division uh comprises
 
02:08:47.229 --> 02:08:47.239 align:start position:0%
all of the design bureaus and all of the
 
02:08:49.750 --> 02:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
bureaus that support administering the
 
02:08:51.910 --> 02:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
Federal Aid highway program in our
 
02:08:56.470 --> 02:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
Capital program um it's about 385 total
 
02:08:59.510 --> 02:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
positions currently um that offset and
 
02:09:01.750 --> 02:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
permanent positions in the lower right
 
02:09:03.589 --> 02:09:03.599 align:start position:0%
um represents again that's where the
 
02:09:06.990 --> 02:09:07.000 align:start position:0%
safety sections positions came from that
 
02:09:09.430 --> 02:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
were um at least within within the
 
02:09:11.430 --> 02:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
budget and the reporting structure were
 
02:09:15.229 --> 02:09:15.239 align:start position:0%
shifted to report to the um um uh
 
02:09:15.239 --> 02:09:17.189 align:start position:0%
shifted to report to the um um uh
executive

02:09:17.189 --> 02:09:17.199 align:start position:0%
executive
 
02:09:19.910 --> 02:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
office some of the implications with
 
02:09:21.990 --> 02:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
trying to uh meet the budget the targets
 
02:09:24.669 --> 02:09:24.679 align:start position:0%
here were um an overall reduction of
 
02:09:26.790 --> 02:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
about 12 positions three permanent
 
02:09:29.750 --> 02:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
full-time and nine temporary full-time
 
02:09:33.830 --> 02:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
positions uh the federal aid um program
 
02:09:37.549 --> 02:09:37.559 align:start position:0%
funding levels have been held uh to
 
02:09:39.750 --> 02:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
currently anticipated levels and again I
 
02:09:41.189 --> 02:09:41.199 align:start position:0%
just reiterate that a lot of those
 
02:09:43.830 --> 02:09:43.840 align:start position:0%
funding levels and priorities and
 
02:09:47.310 --> 02:09:47.320 align:start position:0%
constraints are addressed and um
 
02:09:49.350 --> 02:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
considered more fully through the 10year
 
02:09:51.069 --> 02:09:51.079 align:start position:0%
plan development process and the off
 
02:09:51.079 --> 02:09:51.950 align:start position:0%
plan development process and the off
budg

02:09:51.950 --> 02:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
budg
 
02:09:54.990 --> 02:09:55.000 align:start position:0%
years um and I've mentioned the safety
 
02:09:58.870 --> 02:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
section but um a couple of the budget
 
02:10:02.870 --> 02:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
implications with with uh with this
 
02:10:06.669 --> 02:10:06.679 align:start position:0%
division um is you know we have relied
 
02:10:10.229 --> 02:10:10.239 align:start position:0%
more and more on Direct funding of uh
 
02:10:12.470 --> 02:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
Federal reimbursements and and
 
02:10:15.910 --> 02:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
leveraging as much Federal program um
 
02:10:17.870 --> 02:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
funding as we can to support the
 
02:10:21.350 --> 02:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
operational costs it does come at a
 
02:10:25.069 --> 02:10:25.079 align:start position:0%
reduction of um funds that we are able
 
02:10:28.069 --> 02:10:28.079 align:start position:0%
to put toward construction projects but
 
02:10:31.270 --> 02:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
um we are um looking in both direct
 
02:10:34.510 --> 02:10:34.520 align:start position:0%
funding bureaus um that that that
 
02:10:36.669 --> 02:10:36.679 align:start position:0%
participate in in and support those
 
02:10:39.709 --> 02:10:39.719 align:start position:0%
Federal programs as well as maximizing
 
02:10:41.830 --> 02:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
our indirect costs and billing to the
 
02:10:45.629 --> 02:10:45.639 align:start position:0%
federal program um to help um bolster
 
02:10:48.270 --> 02:10:48.280 align:start position:0%
and support and meet budget targets um
 
02:10:49.629 --> 02:10:49.639 align:start position:0%
but it does come at the expense of
 
02:10:52.870 --> 02:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
having less Federal that goes towards um
 
02:10:52.880 --> 02:10:53.950 align:start position:0%
having less Federal that goes towards um
needed

02:10:53.950 --> 02:10:53.960 align:start position:0%
needed
 
02:10:57.669 --> 02:10:57.679 align:start position:0%
projects and um partly because of that
 
02:11:00.510 --> 02:11:00.520 align:start position:0%
and partly because of the um the vacancy
 
02:11:02.430 --> 02:11:02.440 align:start position:0%
rates and the difficulties hiring
 
02:11:05.390 --> 02:11:05.400 align:start position:0%
particularly Engineers we do have a very
 
02:11:08.310 --> 02:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
heavy Reliance on consultant support to
 
02:11:11.149 --> 02:11:11.159 align:start position:0%
deliver the program and
 
02:11:14.470 --> 02:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
um and and in the long run I believe
 
02:11:18.189 --> 02:11:18.199 align:start position:0%
that that that does um you know probably
 
02:11:20.430 --> 02:11:20.440 align:start position:0%
present higher costs than if we could do
 
02:11:23.069 --> 02:11:23.079 align:start position:0%
it internally but
 
02:11:25.910 --> 02:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
um um we do rely very heavily on
 
02:11:28.510 --> 02:11:28.520 align:start position:0%
consultant engineering costs to deliver
 
02:11:31.549 --> 02:11:31.559 align:start position:0%
the program the uh the last budget
 
02:11:33.310 --> 02:11:33.320 align:start position:0%
implication there I wanted to highlight
 
02:11:38.109 --> 02:11:38.119 align:start position:0%
there was uh SB 367 that was in 2014 a
 
02:11:42.990 --> 02:11:43.000 align:start position:0%
4.2 Cent um um increase in the gas tax
 
02:11:46.310 --> 02:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
that was dedicated to um completing the
 
02:11:49.470 --> 02:11:49.480 align:start position:0%
i93 project for the last nine years
 
02:11:51.589 --> 02:11:51.599 align:start position:0%
we've enjoyed the revenue from that to
 
02:11:54.350 --> 02:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
put towards Highway and Bridge projects
 
02:11:55.910 --> 02:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
um based on the structure of the
 
02:11:59.709 --> 02:11:59.719 align:start position:0%
financing that went in there in FY 26 uh
 
02:12:02.470 --> 02:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
that Revenue um get shifted to pay the
 
02:12:05.390 --> 02:12:05.400 align:start position:0%
full Debt Service on the uh tifia loan
 
02:12:07.709 --> 02:12:07.719 align:start position:0%
that we took out to complete the i93
 
02:12:11.510 --> 02:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
project so in this budget while the S SP
 
02:12:14.830 --> 02:12:14.840 align:start position:0%
367 funding Remains the Same the revenue
 
02:12:17.830 --> 02:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
Remains the Same it is now shifted from
 
02:12:19.990 --> 02:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
um Highway and Bridge work to paying
 
02:12:23.270 --> 02:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
Debt Service so it is a um again as we
 
02:12:25.310 --> 02:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
get into the 10year plan in the next
 
02:12:30.669 --> 02:12:30.679 align:start position:0%
cycle it is a uh whole in um active work
 
02:12:32.750 --> 02:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
that we will have to look to to fill
 
02:12:34.750 --> 02:12:34.760 align:start position:0%
likely with with federal funds at the
 
02:12:36.149 --> 02:12:36.159 align:start position:0%
expense of something
 
02:12:40.950 --> 02:12:40.960 align:start position:0%
else um so that's a very uh high level
 
02:12:44.109 --> 02:12:44.119 align:start position:0%
uh summary of project development um but
 
02:12:45.470 --> 02:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
the funding for the construction
 
02:12:47.189 --> 02:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
programs again are reflected in the
 
02:12:52.069 --> 02:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
10-year plan we continue to um R very
 
02:12:54.470 --> 02:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
heavily on the federal funds we put very
 
02:12:57.310 --> 02:12:57.320 align:start position:0%
little State funding toward um toward
 
02:13:00.069 --> 02:13:00.079 align:start position:0%
the construction program um we rely
 
02:13:02.709 --> 02:13:02.719 align:start position:0%
exclusively on Turnpike toll credits to
 
02:13:06.030 --> 02:13:06.040 align:start position:0%
match the federal dollars um we have
 
02:13:08.910 --> 02:13:08.920 align:start position:0%
been uh fortunate enough to be able to
 
02:13:10.629 --> 02:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
meet those match requirements but it
 
02:13:14.830 --> 02:13:14.840 align:start position:0%
does come at the expense of of uh less
 
02:13:17.709 --> 02:13:17.719 align:start position:0%
um less funding that goes towards actual
 
02:13:20.589 --> 02:13:20.599 align:start position:0%
projects um and again the significant
 
02:13:22.830 --> 02:13:22.840 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate but despite those
 
02:13:24.310 --> 02:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
challenges like I said I do like to
 
02:13:25.990 --> 02:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
emphasize that we are getting a lot of
 
02:13:29.790 --> 02:13:29.800 align:start position:0%
good things done uh last year uh this
 
02:13:32.310 --> 02:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
the You know despite the challenges um
 
02:13:34.669 --> 02:13:34.679 align:start position:0%
we advertised a construction program of
 
02:13:38.950 --> 02:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
over $350 million of uh contract value
 
02:13:41.069 --> 02:13:41.079 align:start position:0%
um and that includes obligating and
 
02:13:44.470 --> 02:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
utilizing um you know $33 million of
 
02:13:46.549 --> 02:13:46.559 align:start position:0%
additional federal funds that that that
 
02:13:49.709 --> 02:13:49.719 align:start position:0%
came um you know at the last minute in
 
02:13:51.430 --> 02:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
the federal fiscal year through process
 
02:13:54.510 --> 02:13:54.520 align:start position:0%
called redistribution so we do continue
 
02:13:57.390 --> 02:13:57.400 align:start position:0%
to leverage um every F Federal dollar we
 
02:14:02.430 --> 02:14:02.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:06.629 --> 02:14:06.639 align:start position:0%
use I'm trying to be cognizant of of of
 
02:14:08.470 --> 02:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
of time and and moving through this
 
02:14:11.470 --> 02:14:11.480 align:start position:0%
fairly quickly um even though we are
 
02:14:15.149 --> 02:14:15.159 align:start position:0%
into operational cost uh the last the
 
02:14:17.669 --> 02:14:17.679 align:start position:0%
vision um that I'll get to is our
 
02:14:19.870 --> 02:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
Operations Division which is the biggest
 
02:14:22.830 --> 02:14:22.840 align:start position:0%
division um uh within the department
 
02:14:24.830 --> 02:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
relies very heavily on the highway fund
 
02:14:27.350 --> 02:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
so on page 12 I just wanted to give a
 
02:14:30.310 --> 02:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
few facts and overview about the highway
 
02:14:33.589 --> 02:14:33.599 align:start position:0%
fund which is the primary source of of
 
02:14:37.910 --> 02:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
um Department operating um cost revenue
 
02:14:39.870 --> 02:14:39.880 align:start position:0%
revenue to the highway fund comes from
 
02:14:42.510 --> 02:14:42.520 align:start position:0%
the gas tax the road toll and also
 
02:14:44.390 --> 02:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
registration fees and it's collected by
 
02:14:46.030 --> 02:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
the department of safety so a lot of
 
02:14:48.390 --> 02:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
times we get asked about the highway
 
02:14:50.390 --> 02:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
fund and the health of the highway fund
 
02:14:54.430 --> 02:14:54.440 align:start position:0%
but um um you know we are we the do only
 
02:14:56.589 --> 02:14:56.599 align:start position:0%
has a a part of it the highway fund is
 
02:14:59.310 --> 02:14:59.320 align:start position:0%
not the do and the do is not the highway
 
02:15:01.750 --> 02:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
fund as I pointed out we leverage um
 
02:15:05.589 --> 02:15:05.599 align:start position:0%
several other uh uh funding uh sources
 
02:15:09.189 --> 02:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
in our overall budget um and the revenue
 
02:15:10.910 --> 02:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
from the highway fund is appropriated to
 
02:15:14.430 --> 02:15:14.440 align:start position:0%
various agencies um primarily Department
 
02:15:16.589 --> 02:15:16.599 align:start position:0%
of Transportation and safety but there
 
02:15:21.669 --> 02:15:21.679 align:start position:0%
are other um um um agencies that that do
 
02:15:23.510 --> 02:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
have incremental draws on the highway
 
02:15:27.310 --> 02:15:27.320 align:start position:0%
Fund in 2024 the the percentages uh are
 
02:15:31.109 --> 02:15:31.119 align:start position:0%
there do Drew about 57% from the highway
 
02:15:34.390 --> 02:15:34.400 align:start position:0%
fund other agencies again primarily
 
02:15:37.549 --> 02:15:37.559 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety was about 30% and
 
02:15:40.310 --> 02:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
uh about 133% uh from the block grant
 
02:15:44.109 --> 02:15:44.119 align:start position:0%
Aid uh and and uh uh you know went to
 
02:15:45.870 --> 02:15:45.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities so that's a very
 
02:15:48.830 --> 02:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
highlevel summary of the uh distribution
 
02:15:52.310 --> 02:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
of the highway fund um but again I'd
 
02:15:54.310 --> 02:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
emphasize that Highway funds are the
 
02:15:57.189 --> 02:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
Dot's primary source of funding for
 
02:16:00.030 --> 02:16:00.040 align:start position:0%
operations um Revenue into the highway
 
02:16:02.229 --> 02:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
fund has been generally flat that's
 
02:16:05.229 --> 02:16:05.239 align:start position:0%
reflected in our budget targets and it's
 
02:16:08.069 --> 02:16:08.079 align:start position:0%
incrementally um we we project it to be
 
02:16:10.470 --> 02:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
inter incrementally declining over the
 
02:16:13.629 --> 02:16:13.639 align:start position:0%
long term and um I think the highway
 
02:16:16.390 --> 02:16:16.400 align:start position:0%
fund also you know has a long history of
 
02:16:19.910 --> 02:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
of one-time fixes to um address the
 
02:16:21.270 --> 02:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
structural deficit with within the
 
02:16:24.229 --> 02:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
highway fund onetime fixes or general
 
02:16:28.229 --> 02:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
fund infusions have uh been common place
 
02:16:30.149 --> 02:16:30.159 align:start position:0%
in the past in order to shore up the
 
02:16:31.990 --> 02:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
highway fund and and meet and meet
 
02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:33.750 align:start position:0%
highway fund and and meet and meet
budget

02:16:33.750 --> 02:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:16:36.230 --> 02:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
requirements um
 
02:16:39.389 --> 02:16:39.399 align:start position:0%
within and this last this next slide
 
02:16:41.429 --> 02:16:41.439 align:start position:0%
slide 13 is a little bit of a departure
 
02:16:43.070 --> 02:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
from the high from the highway fund but
 
02:16:45.309 --> 02:16:45.319 align:start position:0%
it represents uh a little bit of an
 
02:16:47.070 --> 02:16:47.080 align:start position:0%
overview of the turnpike fund the
 
02:16:51.950 --> 02:16:51.960 align:start position:0%
turnpike Bureau um is uh within the
 
02:16:54.750 --> 02:16:54.760 align:start position:0%
department uh and and under the division
 
02:16:57.429 --> 02:16:57.439 align:start position:0%
of operations but the the turnpike
 
02:16:59.190 --> 02:16:59.200 align:start position:0%
system and the Turnpike fund is an
 
02:17:02.150 --> 02:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
Enterprise System uh supported directly
 
02:17:04.429 --> 02:17:04.439 align:start position:0%
by the tolls that that are collected on
 
02:17:08.270 --> 02:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
that um so it's a little bit of a unique
 
02:17:12.349 --> 02:17:12.359 align:start position:0%
uh uh piece of the department the three
 
02:17:15.230 --> 02:17:15.240 align:start position:0%
turnpikes are reflected there that that
 
02:17:18.309 --> 02:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
system represents about 89 miles 172
 
02:17:21.030 --> 02:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
Bridges seven toll plazas and it's an
 
02:17:23.509 --> 02:17:23.519 align:start position:0%
enter an Enterprise fund so that all
 
02:17:25.950 --> 02:17:25.960 align:start position:0%
Turnpike Revenue um you know must be
 
02:17:28.870 --> 02:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
used on the on the turnpike system and
 
02:17:31.790 --> 02:17:31.800 align:start position:0%
the Turnpike system is um really the
 
02:17:33.950 --> 02:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
waterfall is set up to pay Turnpike
 
02:17:35.750 --> 02:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
Revenue first pays for The Debt Service
 
02:17:38.230 --> 02:17:38.240 align:start position:0%
on any bonds that are outstanding pay
 
02:17:40.669 --> 02:17:40.679 align:start position:0%
the operation and maintenance um we're
 
02:17:43.070 --> 02:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
required to uh fund uh Rehabilitation
 
02:17:44.589 --> 02:17:44.599 align:start position:0%
and restoration work to keep the
 
02:17:47.389 --> 02:17:47.399 align:start position:0%
turnpike system in good working order
 
02:17:49.750 --> 02:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
and and and after all of those other
 
02:17:51.910 --> 02:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
needs are addressed any any additional
 
02:17:54.589 --> 02:17:54.599 align:start position:0%
goes toward um any Capital
 
02:17:58.870 --> 02:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
Improvements um the overall um quick
 
02:18:01.190 --> 02:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
summary of Turnpike revenue is is listed
 
02:18:05.629 --> 02:18:05.639 align:start position:0%
there for FY 24 um projected budgeting
 
02:18:08.030 --> 02:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
uh Turnpike revenue is is uh uh
 
02:18:09.509 --> 02:18:09.519 align:start position:0%
generally flat
 
02:18:12.709 --> 02:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
targets um and we did take reductions
 
02:18:16.030 --> 02:18:16.040 align:start position:0%
through through through covid
 
02:18:19.070 --> 02:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
um so operationally we continue to make
 
02:18:20.389 --> 02:18:20.399 align:start position:0%
progress on the turnike system the
 
02:18:23.030 --> 02:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
biggest impact with the turn bike system
 
02:18:26.589 --> 02:18:26.599 align:start position:0%
is with the capital program that as um
 
02:18:31.190 --> 02:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
revenues are are not increasing as as
 
02:18:34.190 --> 02:18:34.200 align:start position:0%
quickly as as costs are increasing and
 
02:18:38.469 --> 02:18:38.479 align:start position:0%
with level um budgeting targets
 
02:18:42.110 --> 02:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
um um you know we find capital capital
 
02:18:45.230 --> 02:18:45.240 align:start position:0%
projects tend to be at at risk so um
 
02:18:47.469 --> 02:18:47.479 align:start position:0%
revenue is generally flat costs are
 
02:18:49.389 --> 02:18:49.399 align:start position:0%
going up and as a result capital
 
02:18:51.629 --> 02:18:51.639 align:start position:0%
projects um you know keep getting
 
02:18:53.750 --> 02:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
getting shifted probably more of a
 
02:18:58.110 --> 02:18:58.120 align:start position:0%
discussion at the at the 10-year plan um
 
02:19:02.270 --> 02:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
uh next year but um it it is a um it is
 
02:19:05.910 --> 02:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
an issue within the turnpike
 
02:19:08.150 --> 02:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
program so that's a very quick overview
 
02:19:10.509 --> 02:19:10.519 align:start position:0%
of the turnike system the last division
 
02:19:13.150 --> 02:19:13.160 align:start position:0%
is is the Department's largest uh
 
02:19:15.950 --> 02:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
division it's the division of operations
 
02:19:19.549 --> 02:19:19.559 align:start position:0%
uh there they that division comprises uh
 
02:19:23.950 --> 02:19:23.960 align:start position:0%
currently um um approximately uh
 
02:19:28.469 --> 02:19:28.479 align:start position:0%
1155 positions uh uh distributed
 
02:19:30.270 --> 02:19:30.280 align:start position:0%
Statewide to take care of all the bridge
 
02:19:31.790 --> 02:19:31.800 align:start position:0%
maintenance all the Highway Maintenance
 
02:19:34.190 --> 02:19:34.200 align:start position:0%
all of the all of the winter maintenance
 
02:19:37.549 --> 02:19:37.559 align:start position:0%
that that goes on and um as well as the
 
02:19:40.629 --> 02:19:40.639 align:start position:0%
Operational Support bureaus so to meet
 
02:19:43.270 --> 02:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
budget targets within this division uh
 
02:19:45.589 --> 02:19:45.599 align:start position:0%
we ended up um looking at a reduction of
 
02:19:47.950 --> 02:19:47.960 align:start position:0%
about five positions three permanent
 
02:19:51.230 --> 02:19:51.240 align:start position:0%
positions two full-time positions
 
02:19:55.469 --> 02:19:55.479 align:start position:0%
and um just some of the indications that
 
02:19:55.479 --> 02:19:57.110 align:start position:0%
and um just some of the indications that
uh

02:19:57.110 --> 02:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:20:00.630 --> 02:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
we uh believe we are underfunding winter
 
02:20:02.710 --> 02:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
maintenance that is intentional that has
 
02:20:04.870 --> 02:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
been the approach in the past number of
 
02:20:08.309 --> 02:20:08.319 align:start position:0%
years to um our our goal would be
 
02:20:12.110 --> 02:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
typically to budget to a a a three-year
 
02:20:15.630 --> 02:20:15.640 align:start position:0%
average um but historically we have to
 
02:20:18.429 --> 02:20:18.439 align:start position:0%
meet budget implications have have uh
 
02:20:20.990 --> 02:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
budgeted optimistically for winter and
 
02:20:25.110 --> 02:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
if um actual costs go up we've gone back
 
02:20:28.429 --> 02:20:28.439 align:start position:0%
um for um to the fiscal committee for
 
02:20:33.230 --> 02:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
for discret uh transfers but um we
 
02:20:34.990 --> 02:20:35.000 align:start position:0%
believe we're we're underfunding winter
 
02:20:37.070 --> 02:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
maintenance in this budget by about $1
 
02:20:39.110 --> 02:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
million we'll have to see depending on
 
02:20:41.950 --> 02:20:41.960 align:start position:0%
the severity of the winter if that um if
 
02:20:41.960 --> 02:20:43.190 align:start position:0%
the severity of the winter if that um if
that

02:20:43.190 --> 02:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:20:43.200 --> 02:20:44.830 align:start position:0%
that
um

02:20:44.830 --> 02:20:44.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:47.309 --> 02:20:47.319 align:start position:0%
transpires uh we have all we're also
 
02:20:49.230 --> 02:20:49.240 align:start position:0%
underfunding underfunding what we
 
02:20:51.190 --> 02:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
believe would be needed for
 
02:20:54.230 --> 02:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
Fleet replacements for um for vehicle
 
02:20:56.349 --> 02:20:56.359 align:start position:0%
Replacements typically we would Budget
 
02:21:00.230 --> 02:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
on a 10 to 12 year replacement cycle um
 
02:21:04.030 --> 02:21:04.040 align:start position:0%
of the overall um of the overall Fleet
 
02:21:05.790 --> 02:21:05.800 align:start position:0%
um we've made a lot of progress over the
 
02:21:08.750 --> 02:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
last several years in in in uh
 
02:21:09.990 --> 02:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
addressing some of the Deferred
 
02:21:11.990 --> 02:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
maintenance in the fleet but to meet
 
02:21:14.389 --> 02:21:14.399 align:start position:0%
these budget targets uh again we we
 
02:21:16.910 --> 02:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
would have to underfund or or cut or not
 
02:21:21.550 --> 02:21:21.560 align:start position:0%
fund um Fleet replacement at the um
 
02:21:24.389 --> 02:21:24.399 align:start position:0%
at the recommended uh replacement cycle
 
02:21:24.399 --> 02:21:25.150 align:start position:0%
at the recommended uh replacement cycle
or

02:21:25.150 --> 02:21:25.160 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:21:28.670 --> 02:21:28.680 align:start position:0%
interval um so some of the budget
 
02:21:31.270 --> 02:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
implications last year instead of
 
02:21:35.150 --> 02:21:35.160 align:start position:0%
leasing um loader and back hose um
 
02:21:37.190 --> 02:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
through the governor and Council we were
 
02:21:40.910 --> 02:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
um requested or or required to purchase
 
02:21:44.070 --> 02:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
them instead of um leasing them so we
 
02:21:46.309 --> 02:21:46.319 align:start position:0%
see some shifting of cost between lease
 
02:21:48.710 --> 02:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
lease lines and and equipment purchase
 
02:21:51.830 --> 02:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
lines um and we also have a growing
 
02:21:55.190 --> 02:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
backlog in The Salted well program
 
02:21:57.910 --> 02:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
salted well program um has been level
 
02:22:00.710 --> 02:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
funded for a number of years but again
 
02:22:03.309 --> 02:22:03.319 align:start position:0%
um costs of replacing people's Wells
 
02:22:06.790 --> 02:22:06.800 align:start position:0%
that are uh um impacted by Road salts
 
02:22:09.830 --> 02:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
have have gone gone up so we can do
 
02:22:12.750 --> 02:22:12.760 align:start position:0%
fewer every every year and uh we do have
 
02:22:16.710 --> 02:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
a a growing backlog but um we have level
 
02:22:19.750 --> 02:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
funded that program again in this budget
 
02:22:22.309 --> 02:22:22.319 align:start position:0%
um is issues with the fleet as I said as
 
02:22:27.469 --> 02:22:27.479 align:start position:0%
as uh if we do not fully fund the um on
 
02:22:29.790 --> 02:22:29.800 align:start position:0%
the recommended replacement cycle we end
 
02:22:31.790 --> 02:22:31.800 align:start position:0%
up with uh increased maintenance costs
 
02:22:33.550 --> 02:22:33.560 align:start position:0%
and and an and an older Fleet and
 
02:22:35.349 --> 02:22:35.359 align:start position:0%
deferred maintenance that that
 
02:22:38.150 --> 02:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
potentially costs fund uh cost more in
 
02:22:41.469 --> 02:22:41.479 align:start position:0%
the long run um and one of the factors
 
02:22:43.750 --> 02:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
that we continue to have on the on the
 
02:22:46.710 --> 02:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
Highway Maintenance side is uh again
 
02:22:49.910 --> 02:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
continuing ongoing vacancies um winter
 
02:22:54.190 --> 02:22:54.200 align:start position:0%
maintenance we have had a uh program to
 
02:22:56.990 --> 02:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
um incentivize people to volunteer and
 
02:22:59.750 --> 02:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
do winter maintenance but uh a lot of it
 
02:23:01.429 --> 02:23:01.439 align:start position:0%
is Shifting people that would be doing
 
02:23:05.990 --> 02:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
other things so um we are prioritizing
 
02:23:07.630 --> 02:23:07.640 align:start position:0%
you know winter maintenance and and
 
02:23:09.309 --> 02:23:09.319 align:start position:0%
health and safety but it comes at the
 
02:23:12.349 --> 02:23:12.359 align:start position:0%
expense of some other other
 
02:23:15.230 --> 02:23:15.240 align:start position:0%
activities um
 
02:23:18.349 --> 02:23:18.359 align:start position:0%
but with that said uh and despite those
 
02:23:20.990 --> 02:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
challenges we still are getting a lot of
 
02:23:22.990 --> 02:23:23.000 align:start position:0%
of good things done in the Operations
 
02:23:26.429 --> 02:23:26.439 align:start position:0%
Division um um we have in the past um
 
02:23:28.269 --> 02:23:28.279 align:start position:0%
year looked at developing and
 
02:23:30.429 --> 02:23:30.439 align:start position:0%
implementing an electronic permitting
 
02:23:32.750 --> 02:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
system that's fully deployed and being
 
02:23:34.349 --> 02:23:34.359 align:start position:0%
utilized now so hopefully we'll have
 
02:23:37.110 --> 02:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
better service and better tracking of of
 
02:23:41.150 --> 02:23:41.160 align:start position:0%
status of of permits and things um and
 
02:23:44.510 --> 02:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
over the last bium uh especially in the
 
02:23:47.830 --> 02:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
last year uh the number of uh emergency
 
02:23:50.469 --> 02:23:50.479 align:start position:0%
events that operations folks have have
 
02:23:52.349 --> 02:23:52.359 align:start position:0%
responded to putting roads back together
 
02:23:55.269 --> 02:23:55.279 align:start position:0%
in the Sea Coast with storms last winter
 
02:23:57.630 --> 02:23:57.640 align:start position:0%
and uh wash UPS wash outs especially
 
02:24:00.469 --> 02:24:00.479 align:start position:0%
this North uh this uh this summer up
 
02:24:03.469 --> 02:24:03.479 align:start position:0%
north um we looked at emergency repairs
 
02:24:07.389 --> 02:24:07.399 align:start position:0%
to around you know 70 70 79 locations
 
02:24:11.710 --> 02:24:11.720 align:start position:0%
over three declared storm events
 
02:24:14.510 --> 02:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
um and again if you look at the budget
 
02:24:19.269 --> 02:24:19.279 align:start position:0%
lines uh holding the line to a um very
 
02:24:22.389 --> 02:24:22.399 align:start position:0%
level funded Lev funded um
 
02:24:26.110 --> 02:24:26.120 align:start position:0%
budget so that's a a very brief overview
 
02:24:29.389 --> 02:24:29.399 align:start position:0%
my concluding slide just a summarize
 
02:24:31.750 --> 02:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
we've uh in order to meet budget targets
 
02:24:33.830 --> 02:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
we've looked at uh eliminating seven
 
02:24:36.389 --> 02:24:36.399 align:start position:0%
permanent positions nine temporary
 
02:24:40.550 --> 02:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
full-time positions um our priorities
 
02:24:42.230 --> 02:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
continue to be safety and core
 
02:24:43.950 --> 02:24:43.960 align:start position:0%
responsibilities preservation and
 
02:24:46.870 --> 02:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
maintenance first and foremost um we've
 
02:24:49.389 --> 02:24:49.399 align:start position:0%
met budget targets but in many cases I
 
02:24:51.349 --> 02:24:51.359 align:start position:0%
don't know if we are budgeting for what
 
02:24:56.269 --> 02:24:56.279 align:start position:0%
we um truly need um you know we find
 
02:24:59.150 --> 02:24:59.160 align:start position:0%
deferring some of the maintenance um
 
02:25:01.590 --> 02:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
could lead to increasing costs in in the
 
02:25:04.630 --> 02:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
future and uh potentially service levels
 
02:25:07.550 --> 02:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
being being impacted uh we continue to
 
02:25:09.389 --> 02:25:09.399 align:start position:0%
have Workforce challenges and high
 
02:25:11.550 --> 02:25:11.560 align:start position:0%
vacancy rates and it can be a
 
02:25:13.630 --> 02:25:13.640 align:start position:0%
double-edged sword some of those vacancy
 
02:25:16.269 --> 02:25:16.279 align:start position:0%
rates have have allowed us to meet uh
 
02:25:20.309 --> 02:25:20.319 align:start position:0%
projected lapses and given us some um
 
02:25:22.469 --> 02:25:22.479 align:start position:0%
you know flexibility in terms of meeting
 
02:25:25.910 --> 02:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
budget needs but uh it also somewhat
 
02:25:28.830 --> 02:25:28.840 align:start position:0%
masks some of the cost increases because
 
02:25:30.870 --> 02:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
they've been buffered by lack of
 
02:25:32.550 --> 02:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
resources to do the work we aren't
 
02:25:34.030 --> 02:25:34.040 align:start position:0%
getting as much work done because we
 
02:25:35.510 --> 02:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
don't have as many people to get the
 
02:25:37.590 --> 02:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
work done that we would like to do that
 
02:25:40.710 --> 02:25:40.720 align:start position:0%
we really should be getting done and uh
 
02:25:42.870 --> 02:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
I would just lastly summarize that we
 
02:25:45.070 --> 02:25:45.080 align:start position:0%
are successful because we have an
 
02:25:47.389 --> 02:25:47.399 align:start position:0%
exceptionally dedicated and committed
 
02:25:50.309 --> 02:25:50.319 align:start position:0%
Workforce um Everybody across it
 
02:25:51.830 --> 02:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
Department takes great pride in the
 
02:25:54.110 --> 02:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
stewardship of the transportation system
 
02:25:56.950 --> 02:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
that we're responsible for and I think
 
02:25:59.990 --> 02:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
in summary we are getting done what we
 
02:26:02.950 --> 02:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
have to do but um maybe not getting done
 
02:26:04.670 --> 02:26:04.680 align:start position:0%
all that we should be
 
02:26:09.070 --> 02:26:09.080 align:start position:0%
doing um and with that I'll take any any
 
02:26:12.269 --> 02:26:12.279 align:start position:0%
um any thoughts or questions
 
02:26:15.230 --> 02:26:15.240 align:start position:0%
or good thank you things you have uh
 
02:26:18.269 --> 02:26:18.279 align:start position:0%
clearly you you do significantly more uh
 
02:26:20.630 --> 02:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
than I'm about to talk about but I I
 
02:26:22.710 --> 02:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
think your department is is judged
 
02:26:24.830 --> 02:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
publicly at least on how many potholes
 
02:26:26.990 --> 02:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
you fill in the summer and how much
 
02:26:29.349 --> 02:26:29.359 align:start position:0%
plowing you do in the winter and I know
 
02:26:30.750 --> 02:26:30.760 align:start position:0%
that hasn't been easy in fact you
 
02:26:32.269 --> 02:26:32.279 align:start position:0%
touched on it in the supplemental pay
 
02:26:35.349 --> 02:26:35.359 align:start position:0%
for for some of the the plow drivers uh
 
02:26:37.550 --> 02:26:37.560 align:start position:0%
and I think the the reason for that is
 
02:26:39.750 --> 02:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
there was a there's been a demand in a
 
02:26:43.110 --> 02:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
scarcity of CDL licenses and that are
 
02:26:46.710 --> 02:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
available to you uh I I know when that
 
02:26:48.349 --> 02:26:48.359 align:start position:0%
program was put into place the thought
 
02:26:49.670 --> 02:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
was it was going to be temporary because
 
02:26:51.429 --> 02:26:51.439 align:start position:0%
it was during Co and things would return
 
02:26:53.190 --> 02:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
to normal but they really my
 
02:26:55.469 --> 02:26:55.479 align:start position:0%
understanding is haven't uh is this the
 
02:26:57.070 --> 02:26:57.080 align:start position:0%
new Norm now where these supplemental
 
02:26:59.349 --> 02:26:59.359 align:start position:0%
payments are going to be into perpetuity
 
02:27:01.870 --> 02:27:01.880 align:start position:0%
or do you see and I'm really asking you
 
02:27:04.429 --> 02:27:04.439 align:start position:0%
to forecast a little bit but that the
 
02:27:06.870 --> 02:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
CDL problem easing up at some time in
 
02:27:09.429 --> 02:27:09.439 align:start position:0%
the not too distant
 
02:27:14.269 --> 02:27:14.279 align:start position:0%
future I I I I it I don't I don't know I
 
02:27:16.910 --> 02:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
do think it tends to be more of the um
 
02:27:20.190 --> 02:27:20.200 align:start position:0%
more of the new normal um I my question
 
02:27:21.870 --> 02:27:21.880 align:start position:0%
and we've had this introspective
 
02:27:23.710 --> 02:27:23.720 align:start position:0%
question ourselves is so this is the
 
02:27:28.429 --> 02:27:28.439 align:start position:0%
third year that we're we're on um um the
 
02:27:31.750 --> 02:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
volunteer track in the um retention
 
02:27:34.349 --> 02:27:34.359 align:start position:0%
incentive bonus to get people to um
 
02:27:36.750 --> 02:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
volunteer to fill out some of those
 
02:27:39.469 --> 02:27:39.479 align:start position:0%
vacancies um my question our internal
 
02:27:41.670 --> 02:27:41.680 align:start position:0%
question is that's sustainable over the
 
02:27:41.680 --> 02:27:42.550 align:start position:0%
question is that's sustainable over the
long

02:27:42.550 --> 02:27:42.560 align:start position:0%
long
 
02:27:45.630 --> 02:27:45.640 align:start position:0%
run um I will note since you brought up
 
02:27:48.389 --> 02:27:48.399 align:start position:0%
we we had thought about and and you know
 
02:27:50.630 --> 02:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
whether we would you know budget in the
 
02:27:52.710 --> 02:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
spanian permanently that's part of the
 
02:27:54.830 --> 02:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
winter maintenance underfunded we didn't
 
02:27:58.429 --> 02:27:58.439 align:start position:0%
we haven't budgeted the um incentive
 
02:28:00.550 --> 02:28:00.560 align:start position:0%
retention bonus um we'll have to take it
 
02:28:03.150 --> 02:28:03.160 align:start position:0%
on a year-by-year basis and and look at
 
02:28:07.110 --> 02:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
it CDL shortage is uh and CDL driver
 
02:28:09.630 --> 02:28:09.640 align:start position:0%
shortage is is one of the issues I think
 
02:28:11.269 --> 02:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
one of the other issues that that we
 
02:28:15.429 --> 02:28:15.439 align:start position:0%
find is is um competitiveness and in in
 
02:28:17.469 --> 02:28:17.479 align:start position:0%
in wages from what we pay compared to
 
02:28:20.510 --> 02:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
what municipalities and others are are
 
02:28:25.309 --> 02:28:25.319 align:start position:0%
ability to pay so it's it's CDL um
 
02:28:27.030 --> 02:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
shortages and we're we're trying to
 
02:28:30.990 --> 02:28:31.000 align:start position:0%
address that through our own um um CDL
 
02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:32.190 align:start position:0%
address that through our own um um CDL
training

02:28:32.190 --> 02:28:32.200 align:start position:0%
training
 
02:28:35.110 --> 02:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
program but I think it it's also uh
 
02:28:36.950 --> 02:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
competitive wages that contribute to it
 
02:28:36.960 --> 02:28:38.030 align:start position:0%
competitive wages that contribute to it
as

02:28:38.030 --> 02:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:28:41.269 --> 02:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
well and the positions you're UNF
 
02:28:42.750 --> 02:28:42.760 align:start position:0%
funding they're currently unfilled
 
02:28:46.110 --> 02:28:46.120 align:start position:0%
positions correct okay thank you
 
02:28:50.349 --> 02:28:50.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:53.309 --> 02:28:53.319 align:start position:0%
uh years ago when I was attached to FEMA
 
02:28:56.110 --> 02:28:56.120 align:start position:0%
in the military I remember going to a
 
02:28:58.590 --> 02:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
conference where it was stated that if
 
02:29:02.990 --> 02:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
you had three kind of low snow years in
 
02:29:06.190 --> 02:29:06.200 align:start position:0%
a row that the contractors that we rely
 
02:29:08.429 --> 02:29:08.439 align:start position:0%
on to fill in for
 
02:29:11.070 --> 02:29:11.080 align:start position:0%
plowing when they were replacing their
 
02:29:14.110 --> 02:29:14.120 align:start position:0%
trucks on a three or four year basis
 
02:29:16.670 --> 02:29:16.680 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't after three years of no
 
02:29:19.150 --> 02:29:19.160 align:start position:0%
very little snow wouldn't put the extra
 
02:29:22.510 --> 02:29:22.520 align:start position:0%
frame on H to mount the plow and they
 
02:29:24.710 --> 02:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you know so we almost have to
 
02:29:27.590 --> 02:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
pray for snow every third or fourth
 
02:29:30.429 --> 02:29:30.439 align:start position:0%
winter so that they'll be hired
 
02:29:32.190 --> 02:29:32.200 align:start position:0%
otherwise they're going to say no I
 
02:29:33.870 --> 02:29:33.880 align:start position:0%
didn't hav haven't made any money the
 
02:29:35.710 --> 02:29:35.720 align:start position:0%
last three years and it cost me money to
 
02:29:37.910 --> 02:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
put on this extra thing in in gasoline
 
02:29:41.630 --> 02:29:41.640 align:start position:0%
and and an installation cost so I have
 
02:29:43.510 --> 02:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
fear that we may be looking for some of
 
02:29:45.950 --> 02:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
that in the future that you know that if
 
02:29:48.389 --> 02:29:48.399 align:start position:0%
three or four years go by with not much
 
02:29:52.670 --> 02:29:52.680 align:start position:0%
plowing that we we have a a reduction in
 
02:29:54.870 --> 02:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
the number of contractors willing to put
 
02:29:58.950 --> 02:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
on a plow yeah we do have we we do have
 
02:30:01.349 --> 02:30:01.359 align:start position:0%
challenges not not because of lack of
 
02:30:03.230 --> 02:30:03.240 align:start position:0%
plowing or lack of snow in the last few
 
02:30:05.790 --> 02:30:05.800 align:start position:0%
Winters uh you know part of the industry
 
02:30:08.429 --> 02:30:08.439 align:start position:0%
is uh you know hired plows are harder
 
02:30:10.349 --> 02:30:10.359 align:start position:0%
and harder to harder to find a lot of
 
02:30:14.389 --> 02:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
the long-term family run um companies
 
02:30:17.309 --> 02:30:17.319 align:start position:0%
that we have t tended to work with over
 
02:30:20.230 --> 02:30:20.240 align:start position:0%
time they're um um you know the their
 
02:30:22.030 --> 02:30:22.040 align:start position:0%
kids and stuff aren't aren't taking over
 
02:30:23.990 --> 02:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
the country it's some of them are raging
 
02:30:26.870 --> 02:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
out um a lot of the construction
 
02:30:28.469 --> 02:30:28.479 align:start position:0%
companies that we did deal with they
 
02:30:31.750 --> 02:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
don't want to plow and and you know have
 
02:30:33.990 --> 02:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
have the wear and tear on their
 
02:30:36.230 --> 02:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
equipment that that that winter plowing
 
02:30:39.190 --> 02:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
and stuff see so it is it is a challenge
 
02:30:41.710 --> 02:30:41.720 align:start position:0%
uh we have had some rate increases in
 
02:30:44.269 --> 02:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
the last bium I I do have a note there
 
02:30:46.349 --> 02:30:46.359 align:start position:0%
was a note in the on that slide on
 
02:30:48.750 --> 02:30:48.760 align:start position:0%
operations that we may have to look at
 
02:30:51.710 --> 02:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
to we we may have to look at another
 
02:30:54.150 --> 02:30:54.160 align:start position:0%
rate increase for the hired plows to you
 
02:30:56.670 --> 02:30:56.680 align:start position:0%
know continue to um entice them to come
 
02:30:57.710 --> 02:30:57.720 align:start position:0%
work for
 
02:31:00.790 --> 02:31:00.800 align:start position:0%
us but I do want to congratulate you on
 
02:31:02.670 --> 02:31:02.680 align:start position:0%
how good our roads look compared with
 
02:31:05.309 --> 02:31:05.319 align:start position:0%
other states I might drive in and lately
 
02:31:07.990 --> 02:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
in my area the the striping has all been
 
02:31:10.750 --> 02:31:10.760 align:start position:0%
done looks good so thank you very much
 
02:31:12.910 --> 02:31:12.920 align:start position:0%
you've uh managed to adapt very well to
 
02:31:17.910 --> 02:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:23.429 --> 02:31:23.439 align:start position:0%
you hey hi how are you good um have a
 
02:31:25.750 --> 02:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
couple things one can you talk a little
 
02:31:28.389 --> 02:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
bit about the impact of eliminating the
 
02:31:31.110 --> 02:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
state match for transit services and
 
02:31:32.790 --> 02:31:32.800 align:start position:0%
which transit services we're talking
 
02:31:34.670 --> 02:31:34.680 align:start position:0%
about it's it's not like conquered coach
 
02:31:37.429 --> 02:31:37.439 align:start position:0%
but it's the is it the
 
02:31:39.550 --> 02:31:39.560 align:start position:0%
regional who are we eliminating in the
 
02:31:42.429 --> 02:31:42.439 align:start position:0%
match for uh it's a it's a lot of the uh
 
02:31:44.269 --> 02:31:44.279 align:start position:0%
and Andre I don't know if you want to
 
02:31:46.510 --> 02:31:46.520 align:start position:0%
come up and help it's a lot of the um
 
02:31:50.550 --> 02:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
small Municipal um transit services like
 
02:31:54.389 --> 02:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
Coast like um uh conquered Area Transit
 
02:31:56.230 --> 02:31:56.240 align:start position:0%
um like Advanced Transit up in uh the
 
02:32:00.950 --> 02:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
levanon area um U Manchester Transit um
 
02:32:05.590 --> 02:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
Nash Transit that that provide those um
 
02:32:08.790 --> 02:32:08.800 align:start position:0%
transit services typically uh federal
 
02:32:12.790 --> 02:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
federal funds match 50% of the operating
 
02:32:16.870 --> 02:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
cost um and the agencies make up the
 
02:32:20.110 --> 02:32:20.120 align:start position:0%
other half we have traditionally funded
 
02:32:24.950 --> 02:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
a very small amount of of that match um
 
02:32:27.550 --> 02:32:27.560 align:start position:0%
FTA funds have increased they increased
 
02:32:30.590 --> 02:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
through um through some of the emergency
 
02:32:31.950 --> 02:32:31.960 align:start position:0%
relief funds but also through the
 
02:32:36.349 --> 02:32:36.359 align:start position:0%
transportation Bill uh part of the um
 
02:32:40.790 --> 02:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
justification or or backup uh that
 
02:32:43.070 --> 02:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
um uh warranted or looked at the
 
02:32:45.309 --> 02:32:45.319 align:start position:0%
increase State match was
 
02:32:48.429 --> 02:32:48.439 align:start position:0%
to um offset or to keep Pace with the
 
02:32:53.510 --> 02:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
increasing um FTA federal funds but yeah
 
02:32:56.469 --> 02:32:56.479 align:start position:0%
the the only thing I'd add uh is that we
 
02:32:59.630 --> 02:32:59.640 align:start position:0%
we do address it in the letter um that
 
02:33:02.830 --> 02:33:02.840 align:start position:0%
that prefaces this book is that uh
 
02:33:05.590 --> 02:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
unfortunately you know Aviation Rail and
 
02:33:08.110 --> 02:33:08.120 align:start position:0%
Transit all those
 
02:33:10.510 --> 02:33:10.520 align:start position:0%
bureaus they suffer from from what we
 
02:33:12.950 --> 02:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
call in here the tyranny of small budget
 
02:33:15.950 --> 02:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
numbers which is they are so lean
 
02:33:20.230 --> 02:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
there's no fat in those bureaus um and
 
02:33:24.070 --> 02:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
positions are all one deep um that
 
02:33:28.710 --> 02:33:28.720 align:start position:0%
any any cut across the board for General
 
02:33:31.510 --> 02:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
funds to those bureaus necessarily will
 
02:33:34.070 --> 02:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
either result in the elimination of a
 
02:33:36.389 --> 02:33:36.399 align:start position:0%
position that runs a
 
02:33:38.870 --> 02:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
program or
 
02:33:42.750 --> 02:33:42.760 align:start position:0%
the really uh big reduction in a
 
02:33:45.110 --> 02:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
program that is run by one of those
 
02:33:48.910 --> 02:33:48.920 align:start position:0%
positions so it it's a zero sum question
 
02:33:51.070 --> 02:33:51.080 align:start position:0%
when it comes to that now
 
02:33:54.190 --> 02:33:54.200 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the only place we had to
 
02:33:58.710 --> 02:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
give in in uh Transit was that state
 
02:34:01.550 --> 02:34:01.560 align:start position:0%
match um we don't want to uh it's
 
02:34:04.950 --> 02:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
certainly not a a an optimal situation
 
02:34:08.429 --> 02:34:08.439 align:start position:0%
and it is very likely to result in in
 
02:34:11.510 --> 02:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
rather extreme uh reductions in Services
 
02:34:14.990 --> 02:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
by those Transit providers if this would
 
02:34:16.710 --> 02:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
continue through the budget process and
 
02:34:19.550 --> 02:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
be approved it is a non-optimal solution
 
02:34:20.870 --> 02:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
but but it's the only way we can meet
 
02:34:23.830 --> 02:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
our targets I I like the phrase tyranny
 
02:34:26.790 --> 02:34:26.800 align:start position:0%
of small budget numbers I think that for
 
02:34:29.469 --> 02:34:29.479 align:start position:0%
people who are aware of the difficulty
 
02:34:31.670 --> 02:34:31.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes with across the board cuts um
 
02:34:33.190 --> 02:34:33.200 align:start position:0%
it's it's a great expression that helps
 
02:34:35.150 --> 02:34:35.160 align:start position:0%
explain that um so a couple other things
 
02:34:36.830 --> 02:34:36.840 align:start position:0%
I want to I'm going to ignore CDL for
 
02:34:39.349 --> 02:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
the time being um so we passed the
 
02:34:42.750 --> 02:34:42.760 align:start position:0%
highway fund law in something like
 
02:34:45.790 --> 02:34:45.800 align:start position:0%
2008 but don't hold me to that where
 
02:34:47.990 --> 02:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
something like 70% of the highway fund
 
02:34:50.590 --> 02:34:50.600 align:start position:0%
is required to go to Dot did that has
 
02:34:52.870 --> 02:34:52.880 align:start position:0%
that law changed or is that
 
02:34:56.830 --> 02:34:56.840 align:start position:0%
still is that still in effect and is
 
02:34:59.910 --> 02:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
year 57 and the 13 to municipalities how
 
02:35:00.950 --> 02:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
you get to
 
02:35:03.190 --> 02:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
70 or do you know if that loss is still
 
02:35:03.200 --> 02:35:04.349 align:start position:0%
70 or do you know if that loss is still
in

02:35:04.349 --> 02:35:04.359 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:35:07.590 --> 02:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
effect yes that's likely to be the case
 
02:35:10.429 --> 02:35:10.439 align:start position:0%
the the dollars that go directly to do
 
02:35:14.349 --> 02:35:14.359 align:start position:0%
57% municipalities through do would be
 
02:35:17.950 --> 02:35:17.960 align:start position:0%
13% and to to hit that that 70% law they
 
02:35:20.309 --> 02:35:20.319 align:start position:0%
count both of those as
 
02:35:22.670 --> 02:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
Transportation that's my understanding
 
02:35:25.309 --> 02:35:25.319 align:start position:0%
okay good thank you that's very helpful
 
02:35:28.630 --> 02:35:28.640 align:start position:0%
to me um the Tiffy alone funding shift
 
02:35:31.190 --> 02:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
yes I mean you know I think we've all
 
02:35:33.110 --> 02:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
seen this coming
 
02:35:35.910 --> 02:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
for every two-year gimmick for 20 years
 
02:35:37.710 --> 02:35:37.720 align:start position:0%
comes to an end um and this is the one
 
02:35:39.429 --> 02:35:39.439 align:start position:0%
coming to an end what's the rough value
 
02:35:39.439 --> 02:35:40.150 align:start position:0%
coming to an end what's the rough value
of

02:35:40.150 --> 02:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:35:42.870 --> 02:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
that all to the construction program
 
02:35:45.309 --> 02:35:45.319 align:start position:0%
yeah rough value it's about $20 million
 
02:35:49.670 --> 02:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
of um that's the whole 20 what 23 is the
 
02:35:52.070 --> 02:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
the payment every year 23 is the payment
 
02:35:54.630 --> 02:35:54.640 align:start position:0%
to to date we've been paying about one
 
02:35:58.790 --> 02:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
to two% of of uh interest of interest
 
02:36:00.790 --> 02:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
but now it's full Debt Service so
 
02:36:03.150 --> 02:36:03.160 align:start position:0%
roughly it's $20 million that had in the
 
02:36:05.910 --> 02:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
last nine years been going to uh roads
 
02:36:07.870 --> 02:36:07.880 align:start position:0%
and bridges that will now be going to
 
02:36:10.269 --> 02:36:10.279 align:start position:0%
Debt Service and is that is that
 
02:36:12.469 --> 02:36:12.479 align:start position:0%
literally I mean one for one like last
 
02:36:15.429 --> 02:36:15.439 align:start position:0%
year was two and this year it's 23 to
 
02:36:18.269 --> 02:36:18.279 align:start position:0%
Deb service okay yes yeah I mean I
 
02:36:20.230 --> 02:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
remember when when they did it was like
 
02:36:22.590 --> 02:36:22.600 align:start position:0%
the it's like when we bought the bridge
 
02:36:24.309 --> 02:36:24.319 align:start position:0%
right for 100 million and they were
 
02:36:25.389 --> 02:36:25.399 align:start position:0%
going to do 10 million a year and they
 
02:36:29.110 --> 02:36:29.120 align:start position:0%
did it all in two years yeah um yes I
 
02:36:31.230 --> 02:36:31.240 align:start position:0%
got a great that's one of those one time
 
02:36:34.110 --> 02:36:34.120 align:start position:0%
or or yeah one time things to balance
 
02:36:36.150 --> 02:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
the highway fund yeah can I just say I
 
02:36:38.750 --> 02:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
got a great column out of that and
 
02:36:40.070 --> 02:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
George Campbell stopped talking to me
 
02:36:41.710 --> 02:36:41.720 align:start position:0%
for the rest of my life which was which
 
02:36:45.469 --> 02:36:45.479 align:start position:0%
was okay too um Turnpike toll credits
 
02:36:48.150 --> 02:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
yes um there's always been discussion
 
02:36:49.950 --> 02:36:49.960 align:start position:0%
about whether that whether that's legit
 
02:36:53.750 --> 02:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
or not and isn't there always some worry
 
02:36:55.710 --> 02:36:55.720 align:start position:0%
that the feds at some point are going to
 
02:36:58.590 --> 02:36:58.600 align:start position:0%
not allow us to use toll credits as our
 
02:37:02.150 --> 02:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
match one of the I think that's in
 
02:37:03.910 --> 02:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
that's instilled in federal law I think
 
02:37:06.309 --> 02:37:06.319 align:start position:0%
the challenge we have is there is a
 
02:37:08.910 --> 02:37:08.920 align:start position:0%
maintenance of of effort requirement
 
02:37:10.790 --> 02:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
that that the investment in the turnpike
 
02:37:12.910 --> 02:37:12.920 align:start position:0%
system has to keep growing in order to
 
02:37:17.309 --> 02:37:17.319 align:start position:0%
claim that credit and uh as I implied
 
02:37:19.630 --> 02:37:19.640 align:start position:0%
with with some of the stresses an
 
02:37:21.910 --> 02:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
increase of costs and level Revenue our
 
02:37:24.429 --> 02:37:24.439 align:start position:0%
our Capital program on the turnpike
 
02:37:28.469 --> 02:37:28.479 align:start position:0%
system um is probably in Jeopardy which
 
02:37:32.230 --> 02:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
means projecting ahead um we may not
 
02:37:35.150 --> 02:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
have um toll credit to to
 
02:37:37.710 --> 02:37:37.720 align:start position:0%
claim but right right right now
 
02:37:39.790 --> 02:37:39.800 align:start position:0%
currently and in this bium there is
 
02:37:42.269 --> 02:37:42.279 align:start position:0%
enough of a Turnpike toll credit balance
 
02:37:45.190 --> 02:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
to match the federal program but
 
02:37:48.349 --> 02:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
longterm if if we don't have a sustained
 
02:37:49.990 --> 02:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
continued investment
 
02:37:51.910 --> 02:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
in the in the turnpike
 
02:37:54.309 --> 02:37:54.319 align:start position:0%
system that's the Benchmark that's the
 
02:37:56.469 --> 02:37:56.479 align:start position:0%
criteria for able
 
02:37:59.870 --> 02:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
to in order for claiming that credit so
 
02:38:01.389 --> 02:38:01.399 align:start position:0%
if we don't have a sustained investment
 
02:38:03.710 --> 02:38:03.720 align:start position:0%
in the turnpike system we may not be
 
02:38:07.110 --> 02:38:07.120 align:start position:0%
able to claim credit down the road so if
 
02:38:09.349 --> 02:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
the spend goes down we literally have
 
02:38:13.070 --> 02:38:13.080 align:start position:0%
fewer credits yes or none or none it it
 
02:38:16.190 --> 02:38:16.200 align:start position:0%
the the formula is as the commissioner
 
02:38:18.870 --> 02:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
said increasing so it has there's a
 
02:38:21.190 --> 02:38:21.200 align:start position:0%
threeyear average Rule and your current
 
02:38:22.910 --> 02:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
year has to beat that in order to be
 
02:38:25.990 --> 02:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
able to take any of the credits so to
 
02:38:28.510 --> 02:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
give you some stats for last year um we
 
02:38:31.230 --> 02:38:31.240 align:start position:0%
used $58 million of Turnpike toll
 
02:38:34.990 --> 02:38:35.000 align:start position:0%
credits in 24 we earned 68 million of
 
02:38:37.429 --> 02:38:37.439 align:start position:0%
which 45 was in the construction program
 
02:38:39.230 --> 02:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
and 23 was in the renewal and
 
02:38:41.990 --> 02:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
replacement program our balance
 
02:38:45.830 --> 02:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
currently is 196 million of toll credits
 
02:38:51.070 --> 02:38:51.080 align:start position:0%
so we have about 3 years okay
 
02:38:55.790 --> 02:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
um that's good news um sort of sort of
 
02:38:58.750 --> 02:38:58.760 align:start position:0%
um I want there's there's always some
 
02:39:01.910 --> 02:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
thought about um you know the turnpike
 
02:39:03.550 --> 02:39:03.560 align:start position:0%
system tends to
 
02:39:07.110 --> 02:39:07.120 align:start position:0%
be in better the turnpike funding tends
 
02:39:08.590 --> 02:39:08.600 align:start position:0%
to be in better shape than the highway
 
02:39:11.630 --> 02:39:11.640 align:start position:0%
funding so to speak um and there's
 
02:39:14.269 --> 02:39:14.279 align:start position:0%
always some question people have about
 
02:39:15.630 --> 02:39:15.640 align:start position:0%
why don't we just merge it into one big
 
02:39:18.469 --> 02:39:18.479 align:start position:0%
giant pool of cash and let me see if I
 
02:39:21.870 --> 02:39:21.880 align:start position:0%
let me see if I say this right um
 
02:39:24.590 --> 02:39:24.600 align:start position:0%
turnpikes are an island and they have to
 
02:39:28.030 --> 02:39:28.040 align:start position:0%
be an island because the money we
 
02:39:30.590 --> 02:39:30.600 align:start position:0%
borrow is not borrowed against General
 
02:39:32.750 --> 02:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
obligation but is dedicated by Turnpike
 
02:39:35.349 --> 02:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
Revenue so unless we started borrowing
 
02:39:37.550 --> 02:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
the money differently Turnpike must
 
02:39:40.630 --> 02:39:40.640 align:start position:0%
always be its own separate shoe box is
 
02:39:44.750 --> 02:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
that fair yes that's fair right okay so
 
02:39:46.389 --> 02:39:46.399 align:start position:0%
just in case anyone listening is
 
02:39:47.790 --> 02:39:47.800 align:start position:0%
thinking why don't we just dump that
 
02:39:50.990 --> 02:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
into that um your revenues in turn PS
 
02:39:53.790 --> 02:39:53.800 align:start position:0%
when you know 24 is pretty good and 25
 
02:39:56.670 --> 02:39:56.680 align:start position:0%
is is there's a dip I'm looking at the
 
02:39:57.990 --> 02:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
slide on
 
02:40:03.030 --> 02:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
page 13 I bet eyes um is that because 25
 
02:40:06.110 --> 02:40:06.120 align:start position:0%
is as budgeted and 24 is actual yes do
 
02:40:10.110 --> 02:40:10.120 align:start position:0%
we expect turnpik Revenue to be ballpark
 
02:40:11.510 --> 02:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
what it was in
 
02:40:17.110 --> 02:40:17.120 align:start position:0%
24 is yeah okay and then you don't
 
02:40:19.950 --> 02:40:19.960 align:start position:0%
really expect it to go down much in 26
 
02:40:23.830 --> 02:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
27 do you from from where we are today
 
02:40:26.110 --> 02:40:26.120 align:start position:0%
not unless there's a
 
02:40:31.190 --> 02:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
um another pandemic something so right
 
02:40:33.110 --> 02:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
don't uh but I will say you know one of
 
02:40:35.750 --> 02:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
the things that that doesn't uh that one
 
02:40:36.990 --> 02:40:37.000 align:start position:0%
one of the factors that we've been
 
02:40:39.469 --> 02:40:39.479 align:start position:0%
dealing with is that that dip from from
 
02:40:41.590 --> 02:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
covid so you know a lot of our capital
 
02:40:44.590 --> 02:40:44.600 align:start position:0%
and a lot of our um Turnpike fund was
 
02:40:47.910 --> 02:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
based on on on higher projections so
 
02:40:50.990 --> 02:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
while the re Vue has generally rebounded
 
02:40:54.269 --> 02:40:54.279 align:start position:0%
to match around 2019 levels compared to
 
02:40:56.950 --> 02:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
what we were projecting it it's a it's
 
02:40:58.429 --> 02:40:58.439 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a it's kind of a decrease
 
02:41:00.670 --> 02:41:00.680 align:start position:0%
compared to what the uh prior
 
02:41:02.389 --> 02:41:02.399 align:start position:0%
projections were so there's been a
 
02:41:05.429 --> 02:41:05.439 align:start position:0%
resetting which has
 
02:41:09.910 --> 02:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
um you know which has you know altered
 
02:41:12.070 --> 02:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
the overall Financial
 
02:41:14.950 --> 02:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
Outlook okay um I'm not going to ask you
 
02:41:16.550 --> 02:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
about vehicle replacement because I feel
 
02:41:18.630 --> 02:41:18.640 align:start position:0%
like um you get enough of that from the
 
02:41:18.640 --> 02:41:20.590 align:start position:0%
like um you get enough of that from the
council

02:41:20.590 --> 02:41:20.600 align:start position:0%
council
 
02:41:22.910 --> 02:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
um unless unless you really want to talk
 
02:41:26.230 --> 02:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
about you're probably good um but uh
 
02:41:30.150 --> 02:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
winter maintenance um first of all um I
 
02:41:32.990 --> 02:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
signed paperwork to let somebody do
 
02:41:34.790 --> 02:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
winter maintenance for you today so
 
02:41:36.990 --> 02:41:37.000 align:start position:0%
thank doing my part Dan Brennan if you
 
02:41:41.309 --> 02:41:41.319 align:start position:0%
know Dan um and so um it's one guy but
 
02:41:44.750 --> 02:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
still yeah every little bit right um so
 
02:41:46.950 --> 02:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
we underbut and this is one of those
 
02:41:48.710 --> 02:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
things where we oh doing again I'm too
 
02:41:52.469 --> 02:41:52.479 align:start position:0%
close right sorry um we under budget
 
02:41:54.950 --> 02:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
every year on the presumption that we'll
 
02:41:57.590 --> 02:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
just go to fiscal and the money comes
 
02:42:01.870 --> 02:42:01.880 align:start position:0%
out of what high highway Surplus correct
 
02:42:03.910 --> 02:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
and I don't think anyone's done a
 
02:42:07.030 --> 02:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
preliminary Surplus statement but what
 
02:42:09.870 --> 02:42:09.880 align:start position:0%
if there isn't any money in Highway
 
02:42:11.910 --> 02:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
Surplus then fiscal kind of can't give
 
02:42:13.790 --> 02:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
it to you right that's
 
02:42:16.030 --> 02:42:16.040 align:start position:0%
correct okay one of the other areas I
 
02:42:18.630 --> 02:42:18.640 align:start position:0%
will say I mean with the vacancy rate
 
02:42:20.630 --> 02:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
even even though it's indirectly you
 
02:42:23.150 --> 02:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
know we don't have control over over
 
02:42:25.190 --> 02:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
class 10 and class 60 the Personnel
 
02:42:27.710 --> 02:42:27.720 align:start position:0%
costs those savings those lapses those
 
02:42:30.830 --> 02:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
increased lapses do tend to flow into
 
02:42:33.670 --> 02:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
the highway fund so particularly with
 
02:42:35.910 --> 02:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
the with the with the um winter
 
02:42:39.110 --> 02:42:39.120 align:start position:0%
maintenance um retention incentive bonus
 
02:42:41.309 --> 02:42:41.319 align:start position:0%
um much of that in the past bium the
 
02:42:43.790 --> 02:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
last two times we've kind of managed
 
02:42:47.269 --> 02:42:47.279 align:start position:0%
that um through through the
 
02:42:50.190 --> 02:42:50.200 align:start position:0%
laps so you're you're saying an average
 
02:42:51.950 --> 02:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
winner is about $40
 
02:42:54.630 --> 02:42:54.640 align:start position:0%
million you're underfunding it by 11 am
 
02:42:56.550 --> 02:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
I is it overs simplistic to say so
 
02:42:58.950 --> 02:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
you're funding 30 and if it's an average
 
02:43:01.670 --> 02:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
winner you need 40 what's the range but
 
02:43:07.230 --> 02:43:07.240 align:start position:0%
that you or is it between week
 
02:43:09.110 --> 02:43:09.120 align:start position:0%
winter heavy
 
02:43:11.630 --> 02:43:11.640 align:start position:0%
winter do you know I don't Dave do you
 
02:43:13.630 --> 02:43:13.640 align:start position:0%
know off hand like ballpark I'm not
 
02:43:15.030 --> 02:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
asking for we could check I I would
 
02:43:16.750 --> 02:43:16.760 align:start position:0%
think ballpark I know we've had years as
 
02:43:19.269 --> 02:43:19.279 align:start position:0%
high as 50 plus million dollars in a
 
02:43:21.750 --> 02:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
probably a lean a lean year is in the
 
02:43:25.349 --> 02:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
order of 33 or $34 million I do have
 
02:43:28.670 --> 02:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
some numbers here um older numbers
 
02:43:32.630 --> 02:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
showed in the high 20s almost 30 um and
 
02:43:36.670 --> 02:43:36.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:39.950 --> 02:43:39.960 align:start position:0%
45 so so it could be like down six up
 
02:43:42.710 --> 02:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
six but not 10 or 12 right and we're
 
02:43:44.110 --> 02:43:44.120 align:start position:0%
talking about you know this doesn't
 
02:43:46.349 --> 02:43:46.359 align:start position:0%
account for significant cost increases
 
02:43:48.870 --> 02:43:48.880 align:start position:0%
in that time frame too so and I would
 
02:43:51.590 --> 02:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
say that 11 like I said I we we haven't
 
02:43:57.510 --> 02:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
budgeted the um the um incentive um
 
02:44:00.389 --> 02:44:00.399 align:start position:0%
retention bonus that that that does that
 
02:44:03.550 --> 02:44:03.560 align:start position:0%
I've added that into that shortfall
 
02:44:05.349 --> 02:44:05.359 align:start position:0%
anticipating that next year or the
 
02:44:07.630 --> 02:44:07.640 align:start position:0%
preing years that we would still want to
 
02:44:10.110 --> 02:44:10.120 align:start position:0%
do that to entice volunteers to to plow
 
02:44:11.590 --> 02:44:11.600 align:start position:0%
for the winter and to make up those
 
02:44:13.790 --> 02:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
deficits and deciding whe whether
 
02:44:16.830 --> 02:44:16.840 align:start position:0%
Winter's average is not the same way the
 
02:44:18.309 --> 02:44:18.319 align:start position:0%
ski are is deci side right it's not
 
02:44:20.030 --> 02:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
about snowfall it's about
 
02:44:22.469 --> 02:44:22.479 align:start position:0%
events is that fair like you got a plow
 
02:44:25.590 --> 02:44:25.600 align:start position:0%
whether that's 2 in or eight right right
 
02:44:28.150 --> 02:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
so sort of number of plow
 
02:44:30.790 --> 02:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
days average isn't necessarily projected
 
02:44:33.349 --> 02:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
we base it on on pass cost so we look at
 
02:44:36.230 --> 02:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
the last three years of actual cost you
 
02:44:40.030 --> 02:44:40.040 align:start position:0%
know and and and um average those last
 
02:44:43.389 --> 02:44:43.399 align:start position:0%
three years to project ahead yeah I
 
02:44:44.670 --> 02:44:44.680 align:start position:0%
don't think anyone wants you predicting
 
02:44:44.680 --> 02:44:46.070 align:start position:0%
don't think anyone wants you predicting
the

02:44:46.070 --> 02:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:44:48.550 --> 02:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
weather um thank you for indulging me
 
02:44:50.110 --> 02:44:50.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:44:51.269 --> 02:44:51.279 align:start position:0%
how much did you spend last year on
 
02:44:51.279 --> 02:44:52.670 align:start position:0%
how much did you spend last year on
winter

02:44:52.670 --> 02:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
winter
 
02:44:54.510 --> 02:44:54.520 align:start position:0%
maintenance you have that right in front
 
02:44:54.520 --> 02:44:57.190 align:start position:0%
maintenance you have that right in front
of

02:44:57.190 --> 02:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:02.950 --> 02:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
you it looks like close to 40 39 39.7
 
02:45:05.110 --> 02:45:05.120 align:start position:0%
okay what you described last year as
 
02:45:07.349 --> 02:45:07.359 align:start position:0%
average below
 
02:45:09.990 --> 02:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
average I'd say it was
 
02:45:12.230 --> 02:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
average thank you it was weak during the
 
02:45:14.349 --> 02:45:14.359 align:start position:0%
middle of the during the during during
 
02:45:16.469 --> 02:45:16.479 align:start position:0%
the middle of the season but uh I know
 
02:45:18.389 --> 02:45:18.399 align:start position:0%
there were a number of storms at the end
 
02:45:20.590 --> 02:45:20.600 align:start position:0%
of the season and and in March and stuff
 
02:45:22.910 --> 02:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
so it kind of balanced out to an average
 
02:45:27.190 --> 02:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
over the year yeah okay and one point
 
02:45:29.230 --> 02:45:29.240 align:start position:0%
now we we look at it here in conquer and
 
02:45:30.790 --> 02:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
stuff there's there's an awful lot of
 
02:45:34.469 --> 02:45:34.479 align:start position:0%
the state north of uh north of north of
 
02:45:37.429 --> 02:45:37.439 align:start position:0%
the notch that um winter starts a lot
 
02:45:40.309 --> 02:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
earlier and and drags on longer and even
 
02:45:42.710 --> 02:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
though there are uh less density in
 
02:45:45.429 --> 02:45:45.439 align:start position:0%
terms of people there uh is there are a
 
02:45:48.030 --> 02:45:48.040 align:start position:0%
lot more road miles to to maintain up
 
02:45:50.389 --> 02:45:50.399 align:start position:0%
there so so while representative wer is
 
02:45:52.590 --> 02:45:52.600 align:start position:0%
praying for snow because of the plow
 
02:45:54.830 --> 02:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
issue you're going to be on the other
 
02:45:57.510 --> 02:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
side praying against him yeah I'm not
 
02:46:00.870 --> 02:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
praying for snow just pointing out that
 
02:46:03.150 --> 02:46:03.160 align:start position:0%
you know but I I can remember some years
 
02:46:05.349 --> 02:46:05.359 align:start position:0%
we've had a pretty good Surplus because
 
02:46:08.349 --> 02:46:08.359 align:start position:0%
of very little snow and uh it it left us
 
02:46:11.550 --> 02:46:11.560 align:start position:0%
more money for Paving so there's always
 
02:46:14.469 --> 02:46:14.479 align:start position:0%
that to look forward to correct and I
 
02:46:17.670 --> 02:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
think I'm not praying for snow I don't
 
02:46:20.030 --> 02:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
do well in snow
 
02:46:22.750 --> 02:46:22.760 align:start position:0%
I I might add we pray for snow we don't
 
02:46:26.190 --> 02:46:26.200 align:start position:0%
pray for ice and and freezing rain and
 
02:46:29.790 --> 02:46:29.800 align:start position:0%
we pray for snow from 7 to 3:30 there
 
02:46:33.150 --> 02:46:33.160 align:start position:0%
not not for commuters but for because we
 
02:46:35.710 --> 02:46:35.720 align:start position:0%
do that with class 10 and not with with
 
02:46:38.389 --> 02:46:38.399 align:start position:0%
overtime ideally if we had the overtime
 
02:46:40.590 --> 02:46:40.600 align:start position:0%
we'd pray for snow every night and we'd
 
02:46:42.230 --> 02:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
plow it off for you in the morning and
 
02:46:44.830 --> 02:46:44.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't hold you up a
 
02:46:47.389 --> 02:46:47.399 align:start position:0%
bit see no other questions I think
 
02:46:49.309 --> 02:46:49.319 align:start position:0%
councelor gasis will we uh disappointed
 
02:46:52.590 --> 02:46:52.600 align:start position:0%
not one question about 4 a
 
02:46:54.349 --> 02:46:54.359 align:start position:0%
but thank you very much for your
 
02:47:06.630 --> 02:47:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:09.630 --> 02:47:09.640 align:start position:0%
it okay uh Department of information and
 
02:47:37.309 --> 02:47:37.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:41.550 --> 02:47:41.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:44.590 --> 02:47:44.600 align:start position:0%
everyone make sure everybody gets a copy
 
02:47:47.469 --> 02:47:47.479 align:start position:0%
um my name is Dennis goule I am the
 
02:47:48.910 --> 02:47:48.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner for the Department of
 
02:47:50.910 --> 02:47:50.920 align:start position:0%
information technology and with me today
 
02:47:54.469 --> 02:47:54.479 align:start position:0%
is Rose Curry uh Director of Finance for
 
02:47:56.750 --> 02:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
doit and and the person that keeps me
 
02:47:59.510 --> 02:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
honest on budget stuff um you'll be
 
02:48:01.150 --> 02:48:01.160 align:start position:0%
happy to know I'm not going to take you
 
02:48:02.790 --> 02:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
through all of this detail but it's
 
02:48:05.030 --> 02:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
there for you to absorb on your own time
 
02:48:08.710 --> 02:48:08.720 align:start position:0%
if you wish um on the first page I'll
 
02:48:12.230 --> 02:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
just highlight that um you know doit for
 
02:48:14.030 --> 02:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
the state and Hampshire is a centralized
 
02:48:17.389 --> 02:48:17.399 align:start position:0%
organization and it has been for um two
 
02:48:20.469 --> 02:48:20.479 align:start position:0%
decades now um which is unusual if you
 
02:48:22.910 --> 02:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
look around the country a lot of States
 
02:48:25.230 --> 02:48:25.240 align:start position:0%
uh I get calls uh fairly regularly from
 
02:48:27.870 --> 02:48:27.880 align:start position:0%
other states asking about centralization
 
02:48:29.469 --> 02:48:29.479 align:start position:0%
how it works how you do it things like
 
02:48:32.309 --> 02:48:32.319 align:start position:0%
that so so we are a bit unique in that
 
02:48:34.429 --> 02:48:34.439 align:start position:0%
respect and and I think that's a good
 
02:48:38.910 --> 02:48:38.920 align:start position:0%
thing uh going on to page two um just a
 
02:48:41.990 --> 02:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
quick uh summary of us our strategic
 
02:48:43.910 --> 02:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
plan as it exist today we're actually
 
02:48:46.790 --> 02:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
working on the next iteration of that as
 
02:48:48.830 --> 02:48:48.840 align:start position:0%
we speak and and a couple of the changes
 
02:48:50.269 --> 02:48:50.279 align:start position:0%
that we're going to make and that that
 
02:48:52.830 --> 02:48:52.840 align:start position:0%
full strategic plan is available online
 
02:48:54.950 --> 02:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
at the department of our website so if
 
02:48:57.030 --> 02:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
you Google New Hampshire Department of
 
02:48:58.710 --> 02:48:58.720 align:start position:0%
Information Technology you'll be able to
 
02:49:01.389 --> 02:49:01.399 align:start position:0%
see our full strategic plan as well as
 
02:49:03.349 --> 02:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
all of the uh uh things that we're doing
 
02:49:06.150 --> 02:49:06.160 align:start position:0%
with cyber security Etc uh a couple of
 
02:49:07.950 --> 02:49:07.960 align:start position:0%
changes we're working on for for the
 
02:49:11.110 --> 02:49:11.120 align:start position:0%
Strategic plan is one is to instead of
 
02:49:12.870 --> 02:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
having cyber security as a pillar we're
 
02:49:15.429 --> 02:49:15.439 align:start position:0%
going to weave it and privacy into
 
02:49:17.269 --> 02:49:17.279 align:start position:0%
everything we do from a strategic
 
02:49:18.950 --> 02:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
perspective the other thing we're going
 
02:49:21.750 --> 02:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
to do is uh in our strategic objectives
 
02:49:24.590 --> 02:49:24.600 align:start position:0%
for the next couple of years will be to
 
02:49:27.349 --> 02:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
um better integrate our strategic and
 
02:49:27.359 --> 02:49:28.550 align:start position:0%
um better integrate our strategic and
operational

02:49:28.550 --> 02:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
operational
 
02:49:32.150 --> 02:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
initiatives for uh agency uh into the
 
02:49:33.750 --> 02:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
agency business initiatives in other
 
02:49:35.389 --> 02:49:35.399 align:start position:0%
words continue the evolution of that
 
02:49:37.349 --> 02:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
process that I've been doing for almost
 
02:49:39.750 --> 02:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
10 years in New Hampshire so
 
02:49:44.389 --> 02:49:44.399 align:start position:0%
far um moving on to page three um I'm
 
02:49:45.790 --> 02:49:45.800 align:start position:0%
not going to take you through any of
 
02:49:48.269 --> 02:49:48.279 align:start position:0%
this detail other than to highlight um
 
02:49:50.229 --> 02:49:50.239 align:start position:0%
in the first sentence at the top of the
 
02:49:52.790 --> 02:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
page the word dynamic is there and you
 
02:49:55.110 --> 02:49:55.120 align:start position:0%
know I've been doing it for decades now
 
02:49:58.429 --> 02:49:58.439 align:start position:0%
and one thing that uh continues is the
 
02:50:00.550 --> 02:50:00.560 align:start position:0%
the pace of change in technology
 
02:50:03.349 --> 02:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
continues to accelerate and um
 
02:50:05.150 --> 02:50:05.160 align:start position:0%
particularly now with the artificial
 
02:50:07.030 --> 02:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
intelligence the the pace of
 
02:50:09.590 --> 02:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
acceleration is the the highest I've
 
02:50:12.269 --> 02:50:12.279 align:start position:0%
ever seen in my career it it's part of
 
02:50:13.870 --> 02:50:13.880 align:start position:0%
what makes my job fun but it also
 
02:50:15.750 --> 02:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
creates a lot of challenge for us and
 
02:50:18.910 --> 02:50:18.920 align:start position:0%
and uh and I'm sure uh you know for the
 
02:50:20.269 --> 02:50:20.279 align:start position:0%
agencies as
 
02:50:25.110 --> 02:50:25.120 align:start position:0%
well moving on to page four um cyber
 
02:50:27.630 --> 02:50:27.640 align:start position:0%
security um I i' be remiss if I didn't
 
02:50:29.269 --> 02:50:29.279 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about cyber again I'm
 
02:50:30.910 --> 02:50:30.920 align:start position:0%
not going to take you through all the
 
02:50:34.309 --> 02:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
the details but the theme is um and if
 
02:50:37.429 --> 02:50:37.439 align:start position:0%
anybody has has you know is old enough
 
02:50:39.429 --> 02:50:39.439 align:start position:0%
to remember the Mad
 
02:50:43.910 --> 02:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
Magazine um spy versus spy um so you
 
02:50:46.190 --> 02:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
know I get better at cyber security and
 
02:50:47.990 --> 02:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
the bad guys get better than me and then
 
02:50:50.190 --> 02:50:50.200 align:start position:0%
I have to keep adjusting so uh that
 
02:50:51.870 --> 02:50:51.880 align:start position:0%
really is what we're doing and we're
 
02:50:54.990 --> 02:50:55.000 align:start position:0%
doing it almost on a daily basis uh one
 
02:50:56.750 --> 02:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
of the things that we've made big
 
02:50:59.309 --> 02:50:59.319 align:start position:0%
advances in is you know we connect um
 
02:51:02.830 --> 02:51:02.840 align:start position:0%
it's you know to protect the state um
 
02:51:04.630 --> 02:51:04.640 align:start position:0%
it's not just the executive branch I
 
02:51:06.469 --> 02:51:06.479 align:start position:0%
have to look at we collaborate closely
 
02:51:08.269 --> 02:51:08.279 align:start position:0%
with the other branches of government
 
02:51:10.750 --> 02:51:10.760 align:start position:0%
and our constitutional offices as well
 
02:51:12.950 --> 02:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
as we're advancing our our cyber
 
02:51:15.190 --> 02:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
collaboration with cities towns and K
 
02:51:18.910 --> 02:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
through 12s and County governments um
 
02:51:21.190 --> 02:51:21.200 align:start position:0%
they matter as well both in terms of you
 
02:51:24.349 --> 02:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
know protecting the the the folks that
 
02:51:27.070 --> 02:51:27.080 align:start position:0%
we represent and that we serve U but
 
02:51:28.710 --> 02:51:28.720 align:start position:0%
also protecting the state because we do
 
02:51:30.510 --> 02:51:30.520 align:start position:0%
connect to these cities and towns and
 
02:51:32.950 --> 02:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
schools and and so there is risk to the
 
02:51:35.750 --> 02:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
state if a cyber incident happens there
 
02:51:38.990 --> 02:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
so we're spending more effort um that's
 
02:51:41.990 --> 02:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
largely funded by uh Grant monies both
 
02:51:43.790 --> 02:51:43.800 align:start position:0%
through the homeland security as well as
 
02:51:45.870 --> 02:51:45.880 align:start position:0%
the state and local cyber grant program
 
02:51:49.349 --> 02:51:49.359 align:start position:0%
so onetime monies that could end
 
02:51:51.510 --> 02:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
um but right now we're trying to make
 
02:51:53.990 --> 02:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
the best of it with those monies that we
 
02:51:58.830 --> 02:51:58.840 align:start position:0%
have uh moving on to page five
 
02:52:02.190 --> 02:52:02.200 align:start position:0%
um budget
 
02:52:05.590 --> 02:52:05.600 align:start position:0%
Trends um we we work closely uh this
 
02:52:08.190 --> 02:52:08.200 align:start position:0%
this budget does not happen in a vacuum
 
02:52:10.030 --> 02:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
uh particularly the the direct part of
 
02:52:12.830 --> 02:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
the budget which I'll cover uh what that
 
02:52:16.070 --> 02:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
means in a minute but um we do spend a
 
02:52:17.349 --> 02:52:17.359 align:start position:0%
great deal of time working with the
 
02:52:19.790 --> 02:52:19.800 align:start position:0%
agencies on on priorities and the way we
 
02:52:23.190 --> 02:52:23.200 align:start position:0%
do it is um there in statute there's a
 
02:52:26.550 --> 02:52:26.560 align:start position:0%
requirement that agencies do a Agency
 
02:52:28.710 --> 02:52:28.720 align:start position:0%
information technology plan so we'll
 
02:52:31.950 --> 02:52:31.960 align:start position:0%
work with them to develop their uh uh
 
02:52:35.590 --> 02:52:35.600 align:start position:0%
agency level it strategic plans and what
 
02:52:37.910 --> 02:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
we hope and expect is that their budget
 
02:52:39.990 --> 02:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
request and their budget priorities
 
02:52:42.150 --> 02:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
would map to their strategic initiatives
 
02:52:43.429 --> 02:52:43.439 align:start position:0%
at the agency
 
02:52:47.510 --> 02:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
level um the budget Trends are there for
 
02:52:51.150 --> 02:52:51.160 align:start position:0%
you to read um I'll I'll highlight a
 
02:52:52.550 --> 02:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
couple that are particularly annoying to
 
02:52:56.349 --> 02:52:56.359 align:start position:0%
me but um but I'll say not a single one
 
02:52:59.550 --> 02:52:59.560 align:start position:0%
of them Trends cost downwards for it
 
02:53:02.670 --> 02:53:02.680 align:start position:0%
stuff uh you know the our our friends
 
02:53:05.030 --> 02:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
are in the vendor Community have learned
 
02:53:08.710 --> 02:53:08.720 align:start position:0%
that um that shorter equipment life
 
02:53:11.870 --> 02:53:11.880 align:start position:0%
cycles are a good thing uh for them
 
02:53:14.110 --> 02:53:14.120 align:start position:0%
because it we're required to be
 
02:53:16.429 --> 02:53:16.439 align:start position:0%
compliant you know many of our funding
 
02:53:18.830 --> 02:53:18.840 align:start position:0%
streams and and also our the fact that
 
02:53:21.510 --> 02:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
we accept payment cards in in many parts
 
02:53:25.110 --> 02:53:25.120 align:start position:0%
of the state require us to keep our
 
02:53:27.990 --> 02:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
hardware and software in compliance if
 
02:53:30.670 --> 02:53:30.680 align:start position:0%
if compliance life cycles shorten then
 
02:53:33.670 --> 02:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
you know it it helps as a revenue driver
 
02:53:35.790 --> 02:53:35.800 align:start position:0%
to these technology companies so we
 
02:53:37.389 --> 02:53:37.399 align:start position:0%
don't appreciate it but it's a reality
 
02:53:39.630 --> 02:53:39.640 align:start position:0%
of life that we're dealing with now and
 
02:53:42.590 --> 02:53:42.600 align:start position:0%
um the other thing is is that shift from
 
02:53:46.030 --> 02:53:46.040 align:start position:0%
sub from you know the traditional um
 
02:53:47.910 --> 02:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
Capital expenditures to acquire
 
02:53:49.710 --> 02:53:49.720 align:start position:0%
technology and then paying maintenance
 
02:53:53.389 --> 02:53:53.399 align:start position:0%
to a subscription uh model which is also
 
02:53:56.550 --> 02:53:56.560 align:start position:0%
um has cost pressures associated with
 
02:54:00.830 --> 02:54:00.840 align:start position:0%
it now finally some numbers on page six
 
02:54:05.590 --> 02:54:05.600 align:start position:0%
um so uh we we took the traditional
 
02:54:07.830 --> 02:54:07.840 align:start position:0%
approach uh worked with um budget
 
02:54:11.790 --> 02:54:11.800 align:start position:0%
director uh Jerry on this and and um so
 
02:54:14.150 --> 02:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
you have your agency Direct in the Top
 
02:54:16.309 --> 02:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
Line there which is uh 32 accounting
 
02:54:18.990 --> 02:54:19.000 align:start position:0%
units that's really things that are
 
02:54:21.790 --> 02:54:21.800 align:start position:0%
specific to that agency and from a
 
02:54:23.550 --> 02:54:23.560 align:start position:0%
Target perspective the way we look at
 
02:54:24.670 --> 02:54:24.680 align:start position:0%
that is the
 
02:54:27.389 --> 02:54:27.399 align:start position:0%
agency is required to make their targets
 
02:54:31.229 --> 02:54:31.239 align:start position:0%
overall um but we don't make unilateral
 
02:54:33.030 --> 02:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
agency business priority decisions
 
02:54:35.429 --> 02:54:35.439 align:start position:0%
inside those accounting units so so for
 
02:54:37.830 --> 02:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
example you see that there's uh you'll
 
02:54:39.550 --> 02:54:39.560 align:start position:0%
see later that a you know some of the
 
02:54:41.950 --> 02:54:41.960 align:start position:0%
agencies actually increased their budget
 
02:54:44.269 --> 02:54:44.279 align:start position:0%
lines there um we're assuming that they
 
02:54:47.110 --> 02:54:47.120 align:start position:0%
decreased in other places inside their
 
02:54:50.030 --> 02:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
own budgets so they could achieve their
 
02:54:50.040 --> 02:54:51.150 align:start position:0%
own budgets so they could achieve their
uh

02:54:51.150 --> 02:54:51.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:54:56.030 --> 02:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
targets um also for the most part there
 
02:55:02.269 --> 02:55:02.279 align:start position:0%
um uh all but um DHHS uh didn't have any
 
02:55:04.349 --> 02:55:04.359 align:start position:0%
AP additional prioritized needs so
 
02:55:07.630 --> 02:55:07.640 align:start position:0%
that's 6.2 million you see in in 26 and
 
02:55:12.830 --> 02:55:12.840 align:start position:0%
seven uh in the 6.1 almost two in 27
 
02:55:16.070 --> 02:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
those were that's all DHHS uh additional
 
02:55:18.469 --> 02:55:18.479 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs
 
02:55:21.150 --> 02:55:21.160 align:start position:0%
um so what we did strive to do is reach
 
02:55:23.150 --> 02:55:23.160 align:start position:0%
our targets for the other accounting
 
02:55:25.469 --> 02:55:25.479 align:start position:0%
units you see there Central IT services
 
02:55:27.830 --> 02:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
it salaries and benefits and Statewide
 
02:55:30.990 --> 02:55:31.000 align:start position:0%
Telecom and I'll go through um how we
 
02:55:34.070 --> 02:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
did that um how we approached that at a
 
02:55:37.349 --> 02:55:37.359 align:start position:0%
high level uh for the Central Services
 
02:55:39.269 --> 02:55:39.279 align:start position:0%
that's a tough one so you see that we we
 
02:55:42.070 --> 02:55:42.080 align:start position:0%
did achieve a reduction there uh that's
 
02:55:45.150 --> 02:55:45.160 align:start position:0%
stuff that we're running today so so the
 
02:55:47.150 --> 02:55:47.160 align:start position:0%
way we got there got to the the number
 
02:55:49.670 --> 02:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
we're at there it was to to remove
 
02:55:53.870 --> 02:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
anything new and really really um look
 
02:55:55.150 --> 02:55:55.160 align:start position:0%
carefully at what we're currently
 
02:55:56.510 --> 02:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
running and see if there's stuff that we
 
02:55:58.190 --> 02:55:58.200 align:start position:0%
could actually stop doing there was very
 
02:56:00.070 --> 02:56:00.080 align:start position:0%
little that that the state wasn't
 
02:56:02.309 --> 02:56:02.319 align:start position:0%
already depending on so that's where
 
02:56:04.070 --> 02:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
that was kind of the general approach we
 
02:56:07.389 --> 02:56:07.399 align:start position:0%
took there for salaries and benefits we
 
02:56:10.670 --> 02:56:10.680 align:start position:0%
um we simply unfunded all of the open
 
02:56:13.790 --> 02:56:13.800 align:start position:0%
positions that we had to to get to that
 
02:56:17.030 --> 02:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
reduction and then the Statewide Telecom
 
02:56:19.950 --> 02:56:19.960 align:start position:0%
uh what we did is we we reduce the the
 
02:56:22.190 --> 02:56:22.200 align:start position:0%
the spend on uh budgeted spend on
 
02:56:25.030 --> 02:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
projects that we're going to be doing um
 
02:56:28.070 --> 02:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
to and we got really close to the to the
 
02:56:30.030 --> 02:56:30.040 align:start position:0%
Target and we Al you'll see at the in in
 
02:56:32.229 --> 02:56:32.239 align:start position:0%
a later slide where we are with those
 
02:56:35.349 --> 02:56:35.359 align:start position:0%
three accounting units with respect to
 
02:56:39.950 --> 02:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
Target um moving on to
 
02:56:39.960 --> 02:56:41.990 align:start position:0%
Target um moving on to
page

02:56:41.990 --> 02:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
page
 
02:56:42.000 --> 02:56:43.790 align:start position:0%
page
seven

02:56:43.790 --> 02:56:43.800 align:start position:0%
seven
 
02:56:48.510 --> 02:56:48.520 align:start position:0%
um um this is more detail on um at the
 
02:56:51.070 --> 02:56:51.080 align:start position:0%
top of the slide more detail on uh the
 
02:56:54.510 --> 02:56:54.520 align:start position:0%
ins and outs of of how we uh approached
 
02:56:57.910 --> 02:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
the uh how the budget planning and what
 
02:56:59.830 --> 02:56:59.840 align:start position:0%
the impacts were so you can see agency
 
02:57:04.190 --> 02:57:04.200 align:start position:0%
direct big increase um in the first year
 
02:57:07.150 --> 02:57:07.160 align:start position:0%
26 and then an incre another increase
 
02:57:09.710 --> 02:57:09.720 align:start position:0%
from 20 year-over-year to
 
02:57:14.550 --> 02:57:14.560 align:start position:0%
27 um the other thing to to note um is
 
02:57:16.830 --> 02:57:16.840 align:start position:0%
that the although there was a for
 
02:57:18.710 --> 02:57:18.720 align:start position:0%
salaries and benefits we
 
02:57:23.830 --> 02:57:23.840 align:start position:0%
we um were able to achieve a uh a
 
02:57:27.150 --> 02:57:27.160 align:start position:0%
decrease in the first year of the banum
 
02:57:29.670 --> 02:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
the structural things step increases
 
02:57:32.030 --> 02:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
things like that pretty much eliminates
 
02:57:33.750 --> 02:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
that that reduction for the second year
 
02:57:34.830 --> 02:57:34.840 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:57:39.070 --> 02:57:39.080 align:start position:0%
bium and you can see over under Target
 
02:57:41.070 --> 02:57:41.080 align:start position:0%
for at the bottom that in that graph so
 
02:57:43.550 --> 02:57:43.560 align:start position:0%
we're just a little bit over what our
 
02:57:47.429 --> 02:57:47.439 align:start position:0%
Target of of 4% was for this uh budget
 
02:57:47.439 --> 02:57:50.590 align:start position:0%
Target of of 4% was for this uh budget
proposal

02:57:50.590 --> 02:57:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:54.150 --> 02:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
moving on to page eight this kind of uh
 
02:57:56.830 --> 02:57:56.840 align:start position:0%
this is we like to do this the rest of
 
02:57:58.630 --> 02:57:58.640 align:start position:0%
this presentation by the by the way is
 
02:58:00.710 --> 02:58:00.720 align:start position:0%
analysis so I'll just highlight points
 
02:58:01.870 --> 02:58:01.880 align:start position:0%
but I'm not going to go through the
 
02:58:06.110 --> 02:58:06.120 align:start position:0%
detail this analysis is the entire um
 
02:58:09.910 --> 02:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
doit budget um done by class line so you
 
02:58:11.550 --> 02:58:11.560 align:start position:0%
can kind of see what the impacts are and
 
02:58:15.349 --> 02:58:15.359 align:start position:0%
as usual um the the main impacts are um
 
02:58:17.469 --> 02:58:17.479 align:start position:0%
you know Hardware software Professional
 
02:58:19.469 --> 02:58:19.479 align:start position:0%
Services and salaries and benefits
 
02:58:20.590 --> 02:58:20.600 align:start position:0%
that's where the you know the big
 
02:58:24.630 --> 02:58:24.640 align:start position:0%
hitters always are and um and again the
 
02:58:27.510 --> 02:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
hardware and software increases and and
 
02:58:28.990 --> 02:58:29.000 align:start position:0%
Professional Service increases were
 
02:58:31.750 --> 02:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
driven more by the agency direct budgets
 
02:58:34.110 --> 02:58:34.120 align:start position:0%
than the shared centralized budgets
 
02:58:37.349 --> 02:58:37.359 align:start position:0%
because of the the decisions made inside
 
02:58:40.150 --> 02:58:40.160 align:start position:0%
uh the direct budgets by agencies and
 
02:58:41.389 --> 02:58:41.399 align:start position:0%
we'll again you'll be able to see some
 
02:58:44.229 --> 02:58:44.239 align:start position:0%
of that detail later in the
 
02:58:48.670 --> 02:58:48.680 align:start position:0%
presentation uh moving on to page nine
 
02:58:51.030 --> 02:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
um again that's our summary for agency
 
02:58:54.229 --> 02:58:54.239 align:start position:0%
direct U there underneath that table you
 
02:58:55.710 --> 02:58:55.720 align:start position:0%
can see the kinds of things that are
 
02:58:58.830 --> 02:58:58.840 align:start position:0%
being purchased inside there again
 
02:59:01.309 --> 02:59:01.319 align:start position:0%
agency direct we look at as it's
 
02:59:03.309 --> 02:59:03.319 align:start position:0%
specific to that agency it isn't
 
02:59:05.670 --> 02:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
generally something that's shared across
 
02:59:08.070 --> 02:59:08.080 align:start position:0%
agencies that that is normally in the in
 
02:59:09.469 --> 02:59:09.479 align:start position:0%
our shared
 
02:59:13.950 --> 02:59:13.960 align:start position:0%
budget um and at the bottom of the page
 
02:59:15.990 --> 02:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh you see the additional prioritized
 
02:59:18.269 --> 02:59:18.279 align:start position:0%
needs in in previous bium we'd have a
 
02:59:20.510 --> 02:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
long list of these from various agencies
 
02:59:24.269 --> 02:59:24.279 align:start position:0%
uh this this time it's just a list from
 
02:59:27.670 --> 02:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
DHHS and um the and I will note that
 
02:59:29.790 --> 02:59:29.800 align:start position:0%
they've since this was published they've
 
02:59:32.190 --> 02:59:32.200 align:start position:0%
asked us to remove the first item there
 
02:59:34.790 --> 02:59:34.800 align:start position:0%
the exadata maintenance so that item
 
02:59:36.790 --> 02:59:36.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to ask to be removed so that
 
02:59:41.349 --> 02:59:41.359 align:start position:0%
takes a six around six almost 7,26 and
 
02:59:44.950 --> 02:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
68 in 27 out of the picture there for a
 
02:59:46.790 --> 02:59:46.800 align:start position:0%
additional prioritized needs for for
 
02:59:46.800 --> 02:59:49.429 align:start position:0%
additional prioritized needs for for
DHHS

02:59:49.429 --> 02:59:49.439 align:start position:0%
DHHS
 
02:59:52.790 --> 02:59:52.800 align:start position:0%
um moving on to page
 
02:59:56.790 --> 02:59:56.800 align:start position:0%
10 um we this is an analysis we we find
 
02:59:58.670 --> 02:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
valuable for ourselves I'm not I'm not
 
03:00:01.349 --> 03:00:01.359 align:start position:0%
certain if it is for you but over 90% of
 
03:00:04.269 --> 03:00:04.279 align:start position:0%
our budget uh is accounted for by a
 
03:00:05.910 --> 03:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
pretty small number of agencies and you
 
03:00:08.950 --> 03:00:08.960 align:start position:0%
can see that um even you know if you
 
03:00:10.590 --> 03:00:10.600 align:start position:0%
could break it down even further we're
 
03:00:14.190 --> 03:00:14.200 align:start position:0%
looking at um you know over 70% of the
 
03:00:17.150 --> 03:00:17.160 align:start position:0%
top two agencies so so interesting
 
03:00:19.510 --> 03:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
analysis there see how quickly it tails
 
03:00:23.550 --> 03:00:23.560 align:start position:0%
off from you know the 55% that HHS
 
03:00:25.750 --> 03:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
represents to the you know to the
 
03:00:27.950 --> 03:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
corrections at the bottom
 
03:00:31.990 --> 03:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
so I find that you know I was surprised
 
03:00:33.469 --> 03:00:33.479 align:start position:0%
the first time Rose gave me that
 
03:00:35.389 --> 03:00:35.399 align:start position:0%
analysis I was like wow I didn't realize
 
03:00:37.510 --> 03:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
that how you know how quickly that fell
 
03:00:41.710 --> 03:00:41.720 align:start position:0%
off like that um moving on to Central IT
 
03:00:43.750 --> 03:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
services again it's just that's a
 
03:00:45.349 --> 03:00:45.359 align:start position:0%
breakout so I'm not going to go over it
 
03:00:48.510 --> 03:00:48.520 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a repeat of what we saw
 
03:00:53.550 --> 03:00:53.560 align:start position:0%
um up above um but on the top of page 11
 
03:00:55.670 --> 03:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
this does get there's a pretty
 
03:00:59.269 --> 03:00:59.279 align:start position:0%
exhaustive list of what sits in there
 
03:01:01.070 --> 03:01:01.080 align:start position:0%
and so a lot of what we're doing there
 
03:01:04.309 --> 03:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
is unfancy stuff that the state needs to
 
03:01:06.790 --> 03:01:06.800 align:start position:0%
run like you know keeping PCS running
 
03:01:09.429 --> 03:01:09.439 align:start position:0%
running our help you know having uh help
 
03:01:12.309 --> 03:01:12.319 align:start position:0%
desk software um Network infrastructure
 
03:01:15.429 --> 03:01:15.439 align:start position:0%
all of that stuff so u i call that
 
03:01:17.349 --> 03:01:17.359 align:start position:0%
hygiene because you don't get any credit
 
03:01:19.990 --> 03:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
for doing it but if you don't do it for
 
03:01:21.750 --> 03:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
example if the Network's down then
 
03:01:25.030 --> 03:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:29.510 --> 03:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
so um and you can see that those um
 
03:01:31.590 --> 03:01:31.600 align:start position:0%
Central IT services at the bottom Broken
 
03:01:36.469 --> 03:01:36.479 align:start position:0%
Out by uh by class again and you can
 
03:01:40.269 --> 03:01:40.279 align:start position:0%
kind of see where some of the uh some of
 
03:01:42.630 --> 03:01:42.640 align:start position:0%
the um reduction amounts were were
 
03:01:44.309 --> 03:01:44.319 align:start position:0%
achieved particularly on the on the
 
03:01:44.319 --> 03:01:45.550 align:start position:0%
achieved particularly on the on the
hardware

03:01:45.550 --> 03:01:45.560 align:start position:0%
hardware
 
03:01:48.670 --> 03:01:48.680 align:start position:0%
side um
 
03:01:53.670 --> 03:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:57.670 --> 03:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
side page 12 is a continuation of
 
03:02:01.750 --> 03:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
that um in the middle of page 12 the
 
03:02:04.190 --> 03:02:04.200 align:start position:0%
additional prioritized needs are really
 
03:02:06.670 --> 03:02:06.680 align:start position:0%
um the rent and and Charlie could
 
03:02:08.229 --> 03:02:08.239 align:start position:0%
probably explain that better than us but
 
03:02:09.830 --> 03:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
basically what we did Is We I think we
 
03:02:14.309 --> 03:02:14.319 align:start position:0%
took rent at a at our current rate um in
 
03:02:16.670 --> 03:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
in our uh efficiency budget and then the
 
03:02:18.830 --> 03:02:18.840 align:start position:0%
the increases were put in additional
 
03:02:21.349 --> 03:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs so it's relatively
 
03:02:23.349 --> 03:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
small amount but that's why that's
 
03:02:27.110 --> 03:02:27.120 align:start position:0%
there um salaries and benefits down
 
03:02:31.110 --> 03:02:31.120 align:start position:0%
below um can see that um you know we
 
03:02:33.630 --> 03:02:33.640 align:start position:0%
achieved a reduction in the first
 
03:02:37.630 --> 03:02:37.640 align:start position:0%
year uh which was pretty much um
 
03:02:39.950 --> 03:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
eliminated in the second year by
 
03:02:43.190 --> 03:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
structural um things that step increases
 
03:02:47.830 --> 03:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
Etc um the the narrative below that and
 
03:02:50.870 --> 03:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
on the next page page 13 is really the
 
03:02:52.830 --> 03:02:52.840 align:start position:0%
the uh different
 
03:02:55.870 --> 03:02:55.880 align:start position:0%
organizations and suborganizations and
 
03:02:58.190 --> 03:02:58.200 align:start position:0%
what they do inside the department of
 
03:03:01.349 --> 03:03:01.359 align:start position:0%
Information Technology and on page 13 as
 
03:03:05.110 --> 03:03:05.120 align:start position:0%
well there's an org chart with um
 
03:03:09.469 --> 03:03:09.479 align:start position:0%
counts um just to be specific um there
 
03:03:12.229 --> 03:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
are in this proposal there are 37
 
03:03:12.239 --> 03:03:13.630 align:start position:0%
are in this proposal there are 37
unfunded

03:03:13.630 --> 03:03:13.640 align:start position:0%
unfunded
 
03:03:16.950 --> 03:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
positions um in doit and I believe in
 
03:03:18.990 --> 03:03:19.000 align:start position:0%
the current by there were 10 so it
 
03:03:22.309 --> 03:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
really is a net of 27 additional
 
03:03:25.110 --> 03:03:25.120 align:start position:0%
positions unfunded um
 
03:03:28.030 --> 03:03:28.040 align:start position:0%
for to that that represent these numbers
 
03:03:31.910 --> 03:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:37.990 --> 03:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
them again um the uh page 14 is detail
 
03:03:40.469 --> 03:03:40.479 align:start position:0%
associated with
 
03:03:43.309 --> 03:03:43.319 align:start position:0%
that and the bottom of page 14 is the
 
03:03:45.990 --> 03:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
Telecom numbers and and you can see some
 
03:03:48.710 --> 03:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
reductions uh achieved there in in the
 
03:03:55.030 --> 03:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:58.229 --> 03:03:58.239 align:start position:0%
appropriation and then finally on page
 
03:04:03.790 --> 03:04:03.800 align:start position:0%
15 the um breakdown by class line of the
 
03:04:06.590 --> 03:04:06.600 align:start position:0%
Telecom and
 
03:04:10.950 --> 03:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
um U just on the back of page 16 uh just
 
03:04:13.110 --> 03:04:13.120 align:start position:0%
a note that will be requesting the
 
03:04:15.950 --> 03:04:15.960 align:start position:0%
removal of that exad dat maintenance for
 
03:04:19.590 --> 03:04:19.600 align:start position:0%
DHHS is additional priority Iz needs and
 
03:04:21.830 --> 03:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
that concludes my formal testimony and
 
03:04:24.309 --> 03:04:24.319 align:start position:0%
I'm open to
 
03:04:27.389 --> 03:04:27.399 align:start position:0%
questions thank you commissioner uh my
 
03:04:28.910 --> 03:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
my question is I wonder if you could
 
03:04:30.550 --> 03:04:30.560 align:start position:0%
explain a little bit how the
 
03:04:33.990 --> 03:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
direct um budgets are or directs costs
 
03:04:37.790 --> 03:04:37.800 align:start position:0%
are are are are derived uh I know
 
03:04:39.630 --> 03:04:39.640 align:start position:0%
they're specific to the agency but are
 
03:04:41.309 --> 03:04:41.319 align:start position:0%
they all at the request of the agency or
 
03:04:43.750 --> 03:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
there some departments where you say
 
03:04:45.510 --> 03:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
whether you know it or not you need this
 
03:04:48.110 --> 03:04:48.120 align:start position:0%
par your department needs this program
 
03:04:49.790 --> 03:04:49.800 align:start position:0%
and so we're going to assign it to you
 
03:04:52.469 --> 03:04:52.479 align:start position:0%
well so I'll I'll take a step back from
 
03:04:55.309 --> 03:04:55.319 align:start position:0%
from and then answer that question so if
 
03:04:58.670 --> 03:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
you look at the agency class 27 um
 
03:05:01.670 --> 03:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
budgets it's it's made up of multiple
 
03:05:03.990 --> 03:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
Parts um there's the shared service
 
03:05:06.030 --> 03:05:06.040 align:start position:0%
stuff that's what we drive so that
 
03:05:08.429 --> 03:05:08.439 align:start position:0%
shared Service uh centralized services
 
03:05:10.870 --> 03:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
that you see there as well as any of the
 
03:05:12.630 --> 03:05:12.640 align:start position:0%
staff who are in the centralized service
 
03:05:15.150 --> 03:05:15.160 align:start position:0%
those get allocated to the agency and
 
03:05:16.670 --> 03:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
they don't really have a lot to say
 
03:05:18.150 --> 03:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
about that the target
 
03:05:20.229 --> 03:05:20.239 align:start position:0%
and what the um the legislature
 
03:05:22.710 --> 03:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
appropriates drives what's that part of
 
03:05:25.110 --> 03:05:25.120 align:start position:0%
their class 27 number and then there's
 
03:05:27.190 --> 03:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
the other part of the class 27 number
 
03:05:29.670 --> 03:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
which is is very discretionary for the
 
03:05:32.590 --> 03:05:32.600 align:start position:0%
agency so the agency may say we may I'll
 
03:05:36.110 --> 03:05:36.120 align:start position:0%
give you really simple ex uh example we
 
03:05:40.269 --> 03:05:40.279 align:start position:0%
may say hey um we recommend you replace
 
03:05:42.830 --> 03:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
this many PCs this year because we see
 
03:05:45.190 --> 03:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
based on our inventory that you're you
 
03:05:47.750 --> 03:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
know you're um end of lifing a bunch of
 
03:05:50.510 --> 03:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
them they may and and we'll give them
 
03:05:52.590 --> 03:05:52.600 align:start position:0%
that number and and they may say you
 
03:05:55.590 --> 03:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
know what I'm going to since I don't
 
03:05:57.190 --> 03:05:57.200 align:start position:0%
have feel like I have enough money and I
 
03:06:00.670 --> 03:06:00.680 align:start position:0%
I want may want to buy fewer PCS so
 
03:06:02.150 --> 03:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
that's kind of how the process goes
 
03:06:04.830 --> 03:06:04.840 align:start position:0%
we'll say you have this many aging out
 
03:06:07.750 --> 03:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
we recommend you replace this many the
 
03:06:09.150 --> 03:06:09.160 align:start position:0%
agency may come back to us and it's
 
03:06:10.710 --> 03:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
usually agency Finance people right
 
03:06:13.110 --> 03:06:13.120 align:start position:0%
they're analyzing what we're doing and
 
03:06:14.269 --> 03:06:14.279 align:start position:0%
they're saying all right no we don't
 
03:06:16.309 --> 03:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
want to do that we'll do less than that
 
03:06:18.389 --> 03:06:18.399 align:start position:0%
or they might say you know what
 
03:06:20.830 --> 03:06:20.840 align:start position:0%
um for productivity reasons we want to
 
03:06:23.190 --> 03:06:23.200 align:start position:0%
get like banking did this some years ago
 
03:06:25.349 --> 03:06:25.359 align:start position:0%
we want to actually get more we we're
 
03:06:27.429 --> 03:06:27.439 align:start position:0%
going to spend more on PCS we're going
 
03:06:30.110 --> 03:06:30.120 align:start position:0%
to get laptops so that our field people
 
03:06:34.389 --> 03:06:34.399 align:start position:0%
are more um effective so that that's a a
 
03:06:37.229 --> 03:06:37.239 align:start position:0%
microcosm of how that gets developed now
 
03:06:39.389 --> 03:06:39.399 align:start position:0%
uh in HHS since they have um you know
 
03:06:41.790 --> 03:06:41.800 align:start position:0%
some pretty large and expensive
 
03:06:43.830 --> 03:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
applications that's that's the high end
 
03:06:46.349 --> 03:06:46.359 align:start position:0%
of that like if you look at um what's in
 
03:06:49.030 --> 03:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
class 27 for H HS you'll see some pretty
 
03:06:51.030 --> 03:06:51.040 align:start position:0%
large applications you'll see their
 
03:06:53.590 --> 03:06:53.600 align:start position:0%
electronic business intelligence uh
 
03:06:55.750 --> 03:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
implementation which is um you know has
 
03:06:58.110 --> 03:06:58.120 align:start position:0%
all that you know information that
 
03:07:02.070 --> 03:07:02.080 align:start position:0%
that's used and shared um there so um
 
03:07:05.269 --> 03:07:05.279 align:start position:0%
does that adequately answer the question
 
03:07:07.590 --> 03:07:07.600 align:start position:0%
yes it does um I was wondering speaking
 
03:07:10.710 --> 03:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
of of HHS one of their larger it
 
03:07:12.349 --> 03:07:12.359 align:start position:0%
expenses is their their Medicaid
 
03:07:14.750 --> 03:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
management information system mmis is
 
03:07:18.150 --> 03:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
that in here or is that in there the lot
 
03:07:20.870 --> 03:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
hardly any of that's in in there that
 
03:07:23.269 --> 03:07:23.279 align:start position:0%
sits in in a different accounting unit
 
03:07:27.030 --> 03:07:27.040 align:start position:0%
inside the HHS budget thank you there's
 
03:07:30.510 --> 03:07:30.520 align:start position:0%
is Staffing that supports it in in there
 
03:07:33.469 --> 03:07:33.479 align:start position:0%
I have I think seven people that work
 
03:07:35.790 --> 03:07:35.800 align:start position:0%
only on Medicaid in
 
03:07:37.750 --> 03:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
doit and that's part of their direct
 
03:07:40.990 --> 03:07:41.000 align:start position:0%
cost yes thank you it's it's part of
 
03:07:44.070 --> 03:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
their let me clarify so I don't confuse
 
03:07:46.389 --> 03:07:46.399 align:start position:0%
people I have one accounting unit for
 
03:07:48.150 --> 03:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
salaries and benefits
 
03:07:51.349 --> 03:07:51.359 align:start position:0%
um and that some of the roughly half of
 
03:07:53.510 --> 03:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
those people are shared like me and and
 
03:07:55.830 --> 03:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
my costs get allocated out across the
 
03:07:58.750 --> 03:07:58.760 align:start position:0%
agencies and roughly the other half are
 
03:08:00.469 --> 03:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
direct and their salaries and benefits
 
03:08:02.950 --> 03:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
get build directly to the agency so in
 
03:08:04.990 --> 03:08:05.000 align:start position:0%
that case that seven people I mentioned
 
03:08:09.790 --> 03:08:09.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:09.800 --> 03:08:11.710 align:start position:0%
 
HHS

03:08:11.710 --> 03:08:11.720 align:start position:0%
HHS
 
03:08:13.429 --> 03:08:13.439 align:start position:0%
representative thank
 
03:08:16.910 --> 03:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
you um I appreciate all the improvements
 
03:08:18.389 --> 03:08:18.399 align:start position:0%
you've made in and our functioning of
 
03:08:21.190 --> 03:08:21.200 align:start position:0%
our state government through Information
 
03:08:23.990 --> 03:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
Technology one of the things I I would
 
03:08:25.910 --> 03:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
like to see further when they come in
 
03:08:28.110 --> 03:08:28.120 align:start position:0%
with a project and say this is what we'd
 
03:08:31.830 --> 03:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
like to add this new function is if we
 
03:08:35.710 --> 03:08:35.720 align:start position:0%
come back with where will it save not
 
03:08:39.950 --> 03:08:39.960 align:start position:0%
just perhaps a person but also their
 
03:08:42.750 --> 03:08:42.760 align:start position:0%
computer their desk their chair I mean
 
03:08:44.429 --> 03:08:44.439 align:start position:0%
those things ought to be added in this
 
03:08:46.950 --> 03:08:46.960 align:start position:0%
space that we rent those things ought to
 
03:08:49.510 --> 03:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
be added in into where will this
 
03:08:53.269 --> 03:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
save and I I'd like to see some estimate
 
03:08:55.389 --> 03:08:55.399 align:start position:0%
of that kind of thing which I don't
 
03:08:57.070 --> 03:08:57.080 align:start position:0%
think we've done in the past we've just
 
03:09:00.150 --> 03:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
said it should save but what I'd really
 
03:09:02.389 --> 03:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
like to see and I amazed they haven't
 
03:09:04.429 --> 03:09:04.439 align:start position:0%
come up with anything yet all this cyber
 
03:09:07.070 --> 03:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
security and it it's almost a full-time
 
03:09:10.750 --> 03:09:10.760 align:start position:0%
job just try to track all these attacks
 
03:09:12.229 --> 03:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
what I'd love to see is somebody would
 
03:09:15.830 --> 03:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
come up with a counter cyber and if they
 
03:09:18.429 --> 03:09:18.439 align:start position:0%
do a Cyber attack on us we can do damage
 
03:09:21.269 --> 03:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
back to them I wish somebody would would
 
03:09:22.950 --> 03:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
invent that therefore there'd be a lot
 
03:09:25.190 --> 03:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
of fewer cyber well actually I think if
 
03:09:27.510 --> 03:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
you had top secret clearance I don't I
 
03:09:29.309 --> 03:09:29.319 align:start position:0%
only have secret clearance for this job
 
03:09:31.550 --> 03:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
because they don't they but if you had
 
03:09:33.630 --> 03:09:33.640 align:start position:0%
top secret clearance I think you'd see
 
03:09:36.670 --> 03:09:36.680 align:start position:0%
that we actually do do that at the the
 
03:09:39.389 --> 03:09:39.399 align:start position:0%
federal level but uh the states don't do
 
03:09:42.269 --> 03:09:42.279 align:start position:0%
that and um you know I I feel the same
 
03:09:44.070 --> 03:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
way it aggravates me that we're spending
 
03:09:47.150 --> 03:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
all this time and effort and you know
 
03:09:49.309 --> 03:09:49.319 align:start position:0%
there isn't it doesn't feel like there's
 
03:09:51.870 --> 03:09:51.880 align:start position:0%
enough of a deterrent yeah going going
 
03:09:55.750 --> 03:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
to your first point sir um today mostly
 
03:09:57.710 --> 03:09:57.720 align:start position:0%
what we're doing is not putting in new
 
03:10:01.710 --> 03:10:01.720 align:start position:0%
systems we're replacing old ones so that
 
03:10:03.550 --> 03:10:03.560 align:start position:0%
that efficiency that you talk about
 
03:10:05.790 --> 03:10:05.800 align:start position:0%
where you say Hey you know I automated a
 
03:10:08.830 --> 03:10:08.840 align:start position:0%
task um and now you know I should have
 
03:10:11.389 --> 03:10:11.399 align:start position:0%
savings we're generally not seeing that
 
03:10:13.990 --> 03:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
we're seeing uh the effort of like I'll
 
03:10:16.229 --> 03:10:16.239 align:start position:0%
I'll you know my my friend Charlie up
 
03:10:19.309 --> 03:10:19.319 align:start position:0%
there he and I get are together going to
 
03:10:22.469 --> 03:10:22.479 align:start position:0%
an upgraded version of the um system
 
03:10:23.830 --> 03:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
that you know New Hampshire 1 that we
 
03:10:26.389 --> 03:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
run all our finances on and so we're not
 
03:10:28.070 --> 03:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
actually getting any new things from
 
03:10:29.630 --> 03:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
that what we're doing is keeping it in
 
03:10:32.150 --> 03:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
compliance and and and keeping it so we
 
03:10:33.790 --> 03:10:33.800 align:start position:0%
can run the same things we've always
 
03:10:37.710 --> 03:10:37.720 align:start position:0%
been running and and um so that so but I
 
03:10:39.990 --> 03:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
agree with you that um there um there
 
03:10:41.830 --> 03:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
are some you know in the case where we
 
03:10:43.550 --> 03:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
might be automating something that
 
03:10:46.389 --> 03:10:46.399 align:start position:0%
hadn't previously been automated that
 
03:10:47.790 --> 03:10:47.800 align:start position:0%
that should be something that's looked
 
03:10:50.990 --> 03:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
at is in fact I know that um Department
 
03:10:53.670 --> 03:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
of Revenue did that as part of their
 
03:10:56.710 --> 03:10:56.720 align:start position:0%
um their um rims their rims
 
03:10:59.190 --> 03:10:59.200 align:start position:0%
implementation which wasn't a new
 
03:11:01.269 --> 03:11:01.279 align:start position:0%
implementation per se but the features
 
03:11:04.030 --> 03:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
that they got with their new system did
 
03:11:07.670 --> 03:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
um create um some efficiencies for them
 
03:11:09.389 --> 03:11:09.399 align:start position:0%
thank you good luck on finding the
 
03:11:12.790 --> 03:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
counter system thank
 
03:11:16.750 --> 03:11:16.760 align:start position:0%
you I share representative Wilder's um
 
03:11:19.309 --> 03:11:19.319 align:start position:0%
interest in attacking people who put
 
03:11:22.469 --> 03:11:22.479 align:start position:0%
viruses on my computer um I have a
 
03:11:24.110 --> 03:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
brother who works for the NSA I'm going
 
03:11:26.190 --> 03:11:26.200 align:start position:0%
to call him and tell him about it and
 
03:11:27.389 --> 03:11:27.399 align:start position:0%
he'll threaten to tell me what he does
 
03:11:30.030 --> 03:11:30.040 align:start position:0%
so he has to kill me
 
03:11:32.910 --> 03:11:32.920 align:start position:0%
um so uh he keeps wanting to tell me
 
03:11:34.590 --> 03:11:34.600 align:start position:0%
because he has to kill me it's just not
 
03:11:37.710 --> 03:11:37.720 align:start position:0%
fair um I have a couple of
 
03:11:40.110 --> 03:11:40.120 align:start position:0%
questions your agency direct seven
 
03:11:40.120 --> 03:11:41.110 align:start position:0%
questions your agency direct seven
agencies

03:11:41.110 --> 03:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
03:11:44.309 --> 03:11:44.319 align:start position:0%
92% do you do you have similar data for
 
03:11:45.950 --> 03:11:45.960 align:start position:0%
the other
 
03:11:48.070 --> 03:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
categories I me mentioned it's not like
 
03:11:50.469 --> 03:11:50.479 align:start position:0%
that for the shared costs and all
 
03:11:53.229 --> 03:11:53.239 align:start position:0%
that I not with you I don't understand
 
03:11:56.110 --> 03:11:56.120 align:start position:0%
the question I'm sorry you have a chart
 
03:12:01.190 --> 03:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
where you say for agency direct mhm 92%
 
03:12:03.790 --> 03:12:03.800 align:start position:0%
of the costs are these seven agencies
 
03:12:06.469 --> 03:12:06.479 align:start position:0%
what about non- agency
 
03:12:09.510 --> 03:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
direct oh for Oh you mean for the shared
 
03:12:12.389 --> 03:12:12.399 align:start position:0%
stuff yeah I wondered if you had that
 
03:12:13.550 --> 03:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
I'd just be
 
03:12:17.429 --> 03:12:17.439 align:start position:0%
curious oh you oh I see I see yeah no
 
03:12:19.229 --> 03:12:19.239 align:start position:0%
but we'll produce that we can produce
 
03:12:21.190 --> 03:12:21.200 align:start position:0%
that for you yeah no rush it's just it's
 
03:12:24.389 --> 03:12:24.399 align:start position:0%
more more curiosity and no yeah no it
 
03:12:27.389 --> 03:12:27.399 align:start position:0%
probably goes about the same way because
 
03:12:30.510 --> 03:12:30.520 align:start position:0%
the um the way most of the allocations
 
03:12:32.550 --> 03:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
are we have a whole bunch of allocation
 
03:12:36.150 --> 03:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
methods but the most commonly used one
 
03:12:39.510 --> 03:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
is by device count which relates to
 
03:12:43.510 --> 03:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
people so it's probably pretty
 
03:12:46.150 --> 03:12:46.160 align:start position:0%
similar um my understanding from
 
03:12:47.870 --> 03:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
something you said earlier
 
03:12:51.469 --> 03:12:51.479 align:start position:0%
is that you're allocated everywhere so
 
03:12:53.910 --> 03:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
I'm paying your salary so next time we
 
03:12:56.229 --> 03:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
have a argument I can say you work for
 
03:12:59.590 --> 03:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
me indeed okay thank you I I'll look
 
03:13:03.229 --> 03:13:03.239 align:start position:0%
forward to that um agency software
 
03:13:05.870 --> 03:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
requests um every agency budget
 
03:13:07.750 --> 03:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
everybody wants to buy a new piece of a
 
03:13:10.269 --> 03:13:10.279 align:start position:0%
case management piece of software Fleet
 
03:13:12.550 --> 03:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
Management piece of software tree
 
03:13:15.110 --> 03:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
management software potato management
 
03:13:15.120 --> 03:13:17.429 align:start position:0%
management software potato management
software

03:13:17.429 --> 03:13:17.439 align:start position:0%
software
 
03:13:20.110 --> 03:13:20.120 align:start position:0%
you have to approve all those
 
03:13:22.910 --> 03:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
technically yes do they always
 
03:13:26.710 --> 03:13:26.720 align:start position:0%
ask well um it's pretty good I'd have to
 
03:13:28.750 --> 03:13:28.760 align:start position:0%
say we're pretty good I have a pretty
 
03:13:31.269 --> 03:13:31.279 align:start position:0%
mature process I see those things coming
 
03:13:34.349 --> 03:13:34.359 align:start position:0%
across my desk every day just
 
03:13:38.030 --> 03:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
about and um and and now I'm at the
 
03:13:39.429 --> 03:13:39.439 align:start position:0%
point where I actually know what they
 
03:13:41.309 --> 03:13:41.319 align:start position:0%
are when they you know I remember in
 
03:13:43.269 --> 03:13:43.279 align:start position:0%
2015 when I joined I had to go out and
 
03:13:44.750 --> 03:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
research because I didn't know what was
 
03:13:48.710 --> 03:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
going on and and now I kind of do so and
 
03:13:52.950 --> 03:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
if I as things go along I will you know
 
03:13:55.150 --> 03:13:55.160 align:start position:0%
if if something's almost a done deal and
 
03:13:57.150 --> 03:13:57.160 align:start position:0%
it comes across my desk and and I'm
 
03:13:59.790 --> 03:13:59.800 align:start position:0%
inclined to say no that's a terrible
 
03:14:01.349 --> 03:14:01.359 align:start position:0%
time for me to say no because all the
 
03:14:03.070 --> 03:14:03.080 align:start position:0%
work's already been done so what I try
 
03:14:04.950 --> 03:14:04.960 align:start position:0%
to do is get in front of that and say
 
03:14:08.910 --> 03:14:08.920 align:start position:0%
gee if this goes the way keeps going the
 
03:14:11.389 --> 03:14:11.399 align:start position:0%
way it's going to going I'm probably
 
03:14:12.429 --> 03:14:12.439 align:start position:0%
going to say
 
03:14:14.870 --> 03:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
no uh because something's wrong whether
 
03:14:16.630 --> 03:14:16.640 align:start position:0%
it's the technology direction or the
 
03:14:17.590 --> 03:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
fact that I
 
03:14:19.950 --> 03:14:19.960 align:start position:0%
don't think that the project will
 
03:14:21.389 --> 03:14:21.399 align:start position:0%
succeed or whatever you know there's a
 
03:14:23.309 --> 03:14:23.319 align:start position:0%
bunch of reasons why I might say no or
 
03:14:25.150 --> 03:14:25.160 align:start position:0%
or I don't feel like it's adequately
 
03:14:27.750 --> 03:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
protecting citizen data from a cyber or
 
03:14:31.229 --> 03:14:31.239 align:start position:0%
privacy perspective um so we have pulled
 
03:14:33.870 --> 03:14:33.880 align:start position:0%
procurements before uh not very often
 
03:14:35.469 --> 03:14:35.479 align:start position:0%
but again that to me that's a bad
 
03:14:37.309 --> 03:14:37.319 align:start position:0%
example it's an example of me getting in
 
03:14:39.309 --> 03:14:39.319 align:start position:0%
late on my
 
03:14:43.229 --> 03:14:43.239 align:start position:0%
opinion but uh but I'd like but you made
 
03:14:45.309 --> 03:14:45.319 align:start position:0%
me think about Enterprise stuff so I'll
 
03:14:47.550 --> 03:14:47.560 align:start position:0%
share an you piece of information there
 
03:14:49.670 --> 03:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
is you know one of the things that we're
 
03:14:52.750 --> 03:14:52.760 align:start position:0%
doing a lot of is trying not to buy you
 
03:14:54.990 --> 03:14:55.000 align:start position:0%
if we have a case management standard
 
03:14:56.269 --> 03:14:56.279 align:start position:0%
case management
 
03:14:59.670 --> 03:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
software let's not buy case this case
 
03:15:01.349 --> 03:15:01.359 align:start position:0%
management here and this case management
 
03:15:02.830 --> 03:15:02.840 align:start position:0%
here and this case management there and
 
03:15:05.349 --> 03:15:05.359 align:start position:0%
the big you know the big violator
 
03:15:07.469 --> 03:15:07.479 align:start position:0%
historical violator for that obviously
 
03:15:09.110 --> 03:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
was HHS they had multiple Case
 
03:15:11.070 --> 03:15:11.080 align:start position:0%
Management Systems they've they've
 
03:15:12.990 --> 03:15:13.000 align:start position:0%
really um up their game and they're
 
03:15:14.550 --> 03:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
working on you know a standardized
 
03:15:17.150 --> 03:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
approach using Salesforce for for that
 
03:15:19.550 --> 03:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
type of stuff now and it's and there's U
 
03:15:21.229 --> 03:15:21.239 align:start position:0%
there's quite a lot of discipline there
 
03:15:24.030 --> 03:15:24.040 align:start position:0%
and and I and and when I see a case
 
03:15:25.870 --> 03:15:25.880 align:start position:0%
management initiative coming down the
 
03:15:28.269 --> 03:15:28.279 align:start position:0%
road and there's a procurement one of
 
03:15:31.070 --> 03:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
the things I'll do is and what I'm
 
03:15:34.349 --> 03:15:34.359 align:start position:0%
considering influencing it uh is I apply
 
03:15:36.150 --> 03:15:36.160 align:start position:0%
what I call the principle of valid
 
03:15:39.030 --> 03:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
uniqueness so all all humans want to be
 
03:15:41.070 --> 03:15:41.080 align:start position:0%
unique right and so they're like well I
 
03:15:43.349 --> 03:15:43.359 align:start position:0%
need to get this because I'm me you know
 
03:15:45.630 --> 03:15:45.640 align:start position:0%
or we as an agency are unique and that
 
03:15:48.229 --> 03:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
actually may be true but also may not be
 
03:15:49.990 --> 03:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
true and it just may be human nature
 
03:15:53.030 --> 03:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
driving that so I try to get involved in
 
03:15:54.550 --> 03:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
that way and so most of the time we're
 
03:15:57.389 --> 03:15:57.399 align:start position:0%
going to push people towards whatever we
 
03:16:00.670 --> 03:16:00.680 align:start position:0%
think is a standard approach but
 
03:16:03.950 --> 03:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes we will see that there's say
 
03:16:05.950 --> 03:16:05.960 align:start position:0%
uh uh agriculture is a great example
 
03:16:08.990 --> 03:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
there was they did a procurement for
 
03:16:12.389 --> 03:16:12.399 align:start position:0%
what is essentially a case management
 
03:16:15.550 --> 03:16:15.560 align:start position:0%
system for dogs cats and ferrets and um
 
03:16:17.469 --> 03:16:17.479 align:start position:0%
like uh and
 
03:16:19.269 --> 03:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
there was a niche player out there who
 
03:16:22.750 --> 03:16:22.760 align:start position:0%
could come in at a at a good price very
 
03:16:24.469 --> 03:16:24.479 align:start position:0%
fast time to value that was going to do
 
03:16:26.590 --> 03:16:26.600 align:start position:0%
a better job than our standard so so
 
03:16:28.550 --> 03:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
that's what we picked and and it was
 
03:16:30.710 --> 03:16:30.720 align:start position:0%
very successful so that's a great
 
03:16:32.269 --> 03:16:32.279 align:start position:0%
example of the principle of valid
 
03:16:34.309 --> 03:16:34.319 align:start position:0%
uniqueness actually being applied in a
 
03:16:36.349 --> 03:16:36.359 align:start position:0%
way that would go away from the
 
03:16:38.630 --> 03:16:38.640 align:start position:0%
standard so that vendor sitting in the
 
03:16:41.670 --> 03:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
cat bird seat um the
 
03:16:43.910 --> 03:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
um what I let me tell you what I worry
 
03:16:45.950 --> 03:16:45.960 align:start position:0%
about is you know HHS is a really big
 
03:16:48.510 --> 03:16:48.520 align:start position:0%
organization can impose sort of a lot of
 
03:16:50.670 --> 03:16:50.680 align:start position:0%
discipline on itself because they have
 
03:16:53.269 --> 03:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
one of everything they got somebody who
 
03:16:54.710 --> 03:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
does this and they got somebody who does
 
03:16:57.349 --> 03:16:57.359 align:start position:0%
that and you usually have six of them
 
03:17:00.349 --> 03:17:00.359 align:start position:0%
and the let's say you rank ordered
 
03:17:02.070 --> 03:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
agencies by number of employees as you
 
03:17:03.510 --> 03:17:03.520 align:start position:0%
get further and further and further down
 
03:17:05.469 --> 03:17:05.479 align:start position:0%
the food chain they'll have fewer and
 
03:17:08.189 --> 03:17:08.199 align:start position:0%
fewer dedicated let's just say it leads
 
03:17:10.389 --> 03:17:10.399 align:start position:0%
right um they either have a shared it
 
03:17:14.870 --> 03:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
lead or sort of a shared it lead I worry
 
03:17:17.229 --> 03:17:17.239 align:start position:0%
about you know we have some something
 
03:17:20.389 --> 03:17:20.399 align:start position:0%
like 24 agencies that have at least 40
 
03:17:24.030 --> 03:17:24.040 align:start position:0%
45 employees or more and we have another
 
03:17:30.309 --> 03:17:30.319 align:start position:0%
25 or so that have 1 2 4 6 nine I mean
 
03:17:31.750 --> 03:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
the number of agencies that have single
 
03:17:33.630 --> 03:17:33.640 align:start position:0%
digigit employees is
 
03:17:33.640 --> 03:17:35.269 align:start position:0%
digigit employees is
remarkable

03:17:35.269 --> 03:17:35.279 align:start position:0%
remarkable
 
03:17:37.870 --> 03:17:37.880 align:start position:0%
and I don't they're not likely to be
 
03:17:39.790 --> 03:17:39.800 align:start position:0%
talking to somebody about it and and
 
03:17:42.189 --> 03:17:42.199 align:start position:0%
they they feel a need and they I'm not
 
03:17:43.229 --> 03:17:43.239 align:start position:0%
saying they don't have a need but they
 
03:17:45.229 --> 03:17:45.239 align:start position:0%
feel a need very strongly but they're
 
03:17:47.070 --> 03:17:47.080 align:start position:0%
not talking to quote unquote their it Le
 
03:17:48.590 --> 03:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
about it cuz probably in some cases they
 
03:17:52.189 --> 03:17:52.199 align:start position:0%
don't realize they have an IT lead are
 
03:17:55.870 --> 03:17:55.880 align:start position:0%
are you able to influence them to the
 
03:17:58.189 --> 03:17:58.199 align:start position:0%
same extent that you can influence the
 
03:18:00.150 --> 03:18:00.160 align:start position:0%
department of
 
03:18:05.910 --> 03:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
safety mostly yes um and
 
03:18:09.229 --> 03:18:09.239 align:start position:0%
the there's a lot of places where in the
 
03:18:11.110 --> 03:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
state where there's a single person who
 
03:18:12.910 --> 03:18:12.920 align:start position:0%
knows everything and if they ever retire
 
03:18:14.830 --> 03:18:14.840 align:start position:0%
we're in trouble and and when you talk
 
03:18:17.030 --> 03:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
about the small agencies that's
 
03:18:18.790 --> 03:18:18.800 align:start position:0%
absolutely the case for for my
 
03:18:21.110 --> 03:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
department I have one person who does 20
 
03:18:23.269 --> 03:18:23.279 align:start position:0%
agencies and she's been around a long
 
03:18:24.429 --> 03:18:24.439 align:start position:0%
time and knows everything that's going
 
03:18:29.030 --> 03:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
on um amazingly so and um when she
 
03:18:30.550 --> 03:18:30.560 align:start position:0%
retires we're going to be in trouble but
 
03:18:33.030 --> 03:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
right now um you know I'm I'm able to
 
03:18:34.750 --> 03:18:34.760 align:start position:0%
lean on her and she's able to keep me
 
03:18:36.429 --> 03:18:36.439 align:start position:0%
updated on what's going on and if
 
03:18:38.349 --> 03:18:38.359 align:start position:0%
there's something going bump in the
 
03:18:40.030 --> 03:18:40.040 align:start position:0%
night like they're going to acquire
 
03:18:41.750 --> 03:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
technology or they're
 
03:18:44.990 --> 03:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
looking um in large part these small
 
03:18:47.150 --> 03:18:47.160 align:start position:0%
agencies don't have the money to do
 
03:18:50.309 --> 03:18:50.319 align:start position:0%
anything so um there isn't a lot going
 
03:18:53.870 --> 03:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
on but when there is I feel like I I I
 
03:18:55.550 --> 03:18:55.560 align:start position:0%
know what's going on and it does come
 
03:18:57.990 --> 03:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
across my desk and the other thing
 
03:19:01.229 --> 03:19:01.239 align:start position:0%
another Factor that's interesting is
 
03:19:02.590 --> 03:19:02.600 align:start position:0%
that you know sometimes there's an
 
03:19:05.710 --> 03:19:05.720 align:start position:0%
impetus to hey I can do it more
 
03:19:10.349 --> 03:19:10.359 align:start position:0%
inexpensively if I do it this other way
 
03:19:13.309 --> 03:19:13.319 align:start position:0%
except this other way doesn't you know
 
03:19:15.710 --> 03:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
like I'll just I won't use a specific
 
03:19:17.910 --> 03:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
example but I'll use use an example of
 
03:19:21.070 --> 03:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
of a generic example of a a small agency
 
03:19:24.189 --> 03:19:24.199 align:start position:0%
who has highly regulated and sensitive
 
03:19:27.189 --> 03:19:27.199 align:start position:0%
data that feels they can do it less
 
03:19:28.990 --> 03:19:29.000 align:start position:0%
expensive by having a server under a
 
03:19:30.710 --> 03:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
desk in their
 
03:19:33.950 --> 03:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
office um which we of course wouldn't
 
03:19:36.590 --> 03:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
allow and and so when you when you
 
03:19:38.630 --> 03:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
compareed doing it appropriately from a
 
03:19:40.670 --> 03:19:40.680 align:start position:0%
security and a privacy and a protection
 
03:19:44.030 --> 03:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
you know compliant protection of data
 
03:19:47.469 --> 03:19:47.479 align:start position:0%
perspective what might if came out to
 
03:19:50.070 --> 03:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
cost exactly the same as what we were
 
03:19:53.150 --> 03:19:53.160 align:start position:0%
going to charge them to do that work so
 
03:19:55.150 --> 03:19:55.160 align:start position:0%
so that's one of the things that happens
 
03:19:56.910 --> 03:19:56.920 align:start position:0%
is it you know in a smaller environment
 
03:19:58.429 --> 03:19:58.439 align:start position:0%
you may say hey this is too expensive
 
03:20:00.590 --> 03:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
and I want to do it a different way but
 
03:20:02.710 --> 03:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
when you're looking at our
 
03:20:06.189 --> 03:20:06.199 align:start position:0%
responsibility for protecting data and
 
03:20:09.189 --> 03:20:09.199 align:start position:0%
systems at layers on some cost for that
 
03:20:11.269 --> 03:20:11.279 align:start position:0%
whether you were going out into a cloud
 
03:20:12.870 --> 03:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
environment or you're putting it in our
 
03:20:15.269 --> 03:20:15.279 align:start position:0%
data center that's a compliant Data
 
03:20:18.309 --> 03:20:18.319 align:start position:0%
Center and so our data center over at 27
 
03:20:21.750 --> 03:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
Hazen is compliant for all of the for
 
03:20:23.830 --> 03:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
for payment card industry as well as the
 
03:20:26.950 --> 03:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
federal compliant standards like um you
 
03:20:29.229 --> 03:20:29.239 align:start position:0%
know like sieges for criminal justice
 
03:20:32.630 --> 03:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
and IRS publication 1075 for Revenue
 
03:20:32.640 --> 03:20:33.469 align:start position:0%
and IRS publication 1075 for Revenue
couple

03:20:33.469 --> 03:20:33.479 align:start position:0%
couple
 
03:20:35.550 --> 03:20:35.560 align:start position:0%
examples but even little things like
 
03:20:37.110 --> 03:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
people can buy I'm going to make
 
03:20:38.630 --> 03:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
something up let's say just say
 
03:20:41.030 --> 03:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
doorbells and put them on a building
 
03:20:44.710 --> 03:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
they happen to sit in and without any
 
03:20:45.750 --> 03:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
thinking about whether or not it
 
03:20:47.349 --> 03:20:47.359 align:start position:0%
connects to the state system system but
 
03:20:48.910 --> 03:20:48.920 align:start position:0%
yeah well that but in theory they should
 
03:20:53.469 --> 03:20:53.479 align:start position:0%
tell you well you know that that has
 
03:20:55.910 --> 03:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
happened you know that has happened and
 
03:20:57.269 --> 03:20:57.279 align:start position:0%
you know it's an interesting
 
03:20:59.870 --> 03:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
conversation when you say oh I want
 
03:21:02.389 --> 03:21:02.399 align:start position:0%
something that's physically unprotected
 
03:21:04.229 --> 03:21:04.239 align:start position:0%
to be on the state Network and that's a
 
03:21:04.239 --> 03:21:05.750 align:start position:0%
to be on the state Network and that's a
hard

03:21:05.750 --> 03:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
hard
 
03:21:08.309 --> 03:21:08.319 align:start position:0%
no but everything's on the network now
 
03:21:11.309 --> 03:21:11.319 align:start position:0%
when you buy like uh folks who are used
 
03:21:13.429 --> 03:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
to doing cameras right security cameras
 
03:21:15.510 --> 03:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
they used to be on coax they go they
 
03:21:18.269 --> 03:21:18.279 align:start position:0%
were totally not a risk to the state
 
03:21:20.590 --> 03:21:20.600 align:start position:0%
Network at all and so we didn't worry
 
03:21:22.870 --> 03:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
about it and now we worry about it big
 
03:21:25.830 --> 03:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
time because the you know a camera a
 
03:21:29.630 --> 03:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
solar panel on the on the roof of a
 
03:21:32.750 --> 03:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
building uh HVAC systems they're all
 
03:21:34.070 --> 03:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
connected to the
 
03:21:36.510 --> 03:21:36.520 align:start position:0%
network I think there's a plot in
 
03:21:37.990 --> 03:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
Battlestar Galactica where that
 
03:21:43.389 --> 03:21:43.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:45.710 --> 03:21:45.720 align:start position:0%
right all right thank you all see no
 
03:21:46.910 --> 03:21:46.920 align:start position:0%
other questions thank you very much your
 
03:21:49.110 --> 03:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
testimony Take Care thank
 
03:21:51.229 --> 03:21:51.239 align:start position:0%
you hey as I mentioned earlier the
 
03:21:52.830 --> 03:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
treasury Department has been rescheduled
 
03:21:56.469 --> 03:21:56.479 align:start position:0%
to 100 p.m. today so I'd like to invite
 
03:21:58.630 --> 03:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
up next uh elip the land and Community
 
03:22:09.469 --> 03:22:09.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:12.510 --> 03:22:12.520 align:start position:0%
program good morning good morning I'm
 
03:22:14.469 --> 03:22:14.479 align:start position:0%
always happy to come and speak with you
 
03:22:17.030 --> 03:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
as a I call myself a pallet cleanser
 
03:22:19.269 --> 03:22:19.279 align:start position:0%
because elip does not use any general
 
03:22:21.790 --> 03:22:21.800 align:start position:0%
funds so my name is Paula Belmore I am
 
03:22:24.590 --> 03:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
the executive director of elip and as
 
03:22:26.710 --> 03:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
you know since 2009 El Chip's grants
 
03:22:29.550 --> 03:22:29.560 align:start position:0%
have been generated by a $25 search
 
03:22:31.150 --> 03:22:31.160 align:start position:0%
charge which is assessed by our County
 
03:22:33.269 --> 03:22:33.279 align:start position:0%
Registries of Deeds on certain documents
 
03:22:34.309 --> 03:22:34.319 align:start position:0%
when they are
 
03:22:36.990 --> 03:22:37.000 align:start position:0%
recorded I am very proud to report that
 
03:22:41.309 --> 03:22:41.319 align:start position:0%
over its 24 years El Chip's 62 million
 
03:22:45.030 --> 03:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
investment has um helped 204 of New
 
03:22:48.269 --> 03:22:48.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's 2 35 communities and has
 
03:22:51.349 --> 03:22:51.359 align:start position:0%
been matched by $332 million in funds
 
03:22:54.150 --> 03:22:54.160 align:start position:0%
from other sources each Dollar lchip
 
03:22:56.229 --> 03:22:56.239 align:start position:0%
invests in a community supports local
 
03:22:58.790 --> 03:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
jobs enhances the local tax base
 
03:23:02.110 --> 03:23:02.120 align:start position:0%
produces um tourism and Recreation jobs
 
03:23:04.110 --> 03:23:04.120 align:start position:0%
and overall enhances the New Hampshire
 
03:23:05.790 --> 03:23:05.800 align:start position:0%
experience for people who live here and
 
03:23:10.150 --> 03:23:10.160 align:start position:0%
people who visit here however I am um
 
03:23:11.990 --> 03:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
disappointed to report that despite
 
03:23:14.389 --> 03:23:14.399 align:start position:0%
these impressive Returns the El chip SE
 
03:23:15.990 --> 03:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
charge has never been increased since it
 
03:23:18.349 --> 03:23:18.359 align:start position:0%
was first adopted in
 
03:23:21.590 --> 03:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
2009 as a result in its first four years
 
03:23:23.429 --> 03:23:23.439 align:start position:0%
the elip search charge generated on
 
03:23:26.030 --> 03:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
average $ million a year for grant
 
03:23:28.870 --> 03:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
funding in the last four years that
 
03:23:32.670 --> 03:23:32.680 align:start position:0%
amount increased only 10% or 400,000
 
03:23:34.910 --> 03:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
despite the real estate frenzy that
 
03:23:37.469 --> 03:23:37.479 align:start position:0%
resulted from covid so as you can
 
03:23:40.510 --> 03:23:40.520 align:start position:0%
imagine a 10% increase in funding is
 
03:23:42.510 --> 03:23:42.520 align:start position:0%
well below the increases that we've seen
 
03:23:45.189 --> 03:23:45.199 align:start position:0%
in real estate increases in construction
 
03:23:47.349 --> 03:23:47.359 align:start position:0%
costs the things that were funding
 
03:23:49.189 --> 03:23:49.199 align:start position:0%
what all of this means is that El Chip's
 
03:23:51.309 --> 03:23:51.319 align:start position:0%
dollar is just not going as far as it
 
03:23:54.910 --> 03:23:54.920 align:start position:0%
used to um as a result 44% of the
 
03:23:56.830 --> 03:23:56.840 align:start position:0%
requests we received in the last 10
 
03:23:59.550 --> 03:23:59.560 align:start position:0%
years went unfunded and those requests
 
03:24:01.309 --> 03:24:01.319 align:start position:0%
are only a small sliver of the actual
 
03:24:04.070 --> 03:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
need because the recipients know that
 
03:24:05.790 --> 03:24:05.800 align:start position:0%
there's not enough money and so they are
 
03:24:07.710 --> 03:24:07.720 align:start position:0%
being very selective about the requests
 
03:24:10.830 --> 03:24:10.840 align:start position:0%
they're making so by any measure a 10%
 
03:24:14.070 --> 03:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
increase in funds over 15 years is well
 
03:24:17.870 --> 03:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
below what we need but those shortfalls
 
03:24:19.630 --> 03:24:19.640 align:start position:0%
we are still working diligently to make
 
03:24:21.670 --> 03:24:21.680 align:start position:0%
sure every single surcharge dollar
 
03:24:24.670 --> 03:24:24.680 align:start position:0%
generated is sent out to the communities
 
03:24:27.590 --> 03:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
in the form of Grants 96% of the money
 
03:24:30.670 --> 03:24:30.680 align:start position:0%
that has been um generated by lchip has
 
03:24:32.349 --> 03:24:32.359 align:start position:0%
gone straight back out either in the
 
03:24:34.229 --> 03:24:34.239 align:start position:0%
form of Grants or has been invested in
 
03:24:36.670 --> 03:24:36.680 align:start position:0%
our community conservation endowment
 
03:24:38.349 --> 03:24:38.359 align:start position:0%
which supports long-term protection of
 
03:24:38.359 --> 03:24:39.510 align:start position:0%
which supports long-term protection of
our

03:24:39.510 --> 03:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
our
 
03:24:41.750 --> 03:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
properties excuse me I have a bit of a
 
03:24:44.590 --> 03:24:44.600 align:start position:0%
cold in fiscal year 22 we were proud to
 
03:24:46.950 --> 03:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
be the first as is an interest tie into
 
03:24:49.229 --> 03:24:49.239 align:start position:0%
your conversation um the first of the
 
03:24:51.790 --> 03:24:51.800 align:start position:0%
state's conservation Grant programs that
 
03:24:54.070 --> 03:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
move to an online Grant application and
 
03:24:56.189 --> 03:24:56.199 align:start position:0%
management system we don't work with
 
03:24:58.750 --> 03:24:58.760 align:start position:0%
doit because we're not a state agency
 
03:25:01.070 --> 03:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
but we did work closely with other
 
03:25:03.469 --> 03:25:03.479 align:start position:0%
agencies um for example Parks was
 
03:25:06.110 --> 03:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
working um through lwcf on similar
 
03:25:08.070 --> 03:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
programs we did consult with them and
 
03:25:12.269 --> 03:25:12.279 align:start position:0%
use their guidance um and uh that that
 
03:25:14.150 --> 03:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
program has brought great efficiencies
 
03:25:16.590 --> 03:25:16.600 align:start position:0%
we didn't free up a desk but we did free
 
03:25:19.670 --> 03:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
up a lot of file cabinet space um in
 
03:25:22.269 --> 03:25:22.279 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23 we prioritized getting
 
03:25:25.150 --> 03:25:25.160 align:start position:0%
our grant money out more quickly into
 
03:25:28.229 --> 03:25:28.239 align:start position:0%
the communities and um in order to get
 
03:25:29.950 --> 03:25:29.960 align:start position:0%
those jobs going and of course we were
 
03:25:31.910 --> 03:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
coming off of covid there had been a lot
 
03:25:33.830 --> 03:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
of pent-up demand you know for
 
03:25:36.150 --> 03:25:36.160 align:start position:0%
construction so that was certainly a
 
03:25:38.790 --> 03:25:38.800 align:start position:0%
priority and in fiscal year 24 we looked
 
03:25:40.830 --> 03:25:40.840 align:start position:0%
at what else was slowing down getting
 
03:25:42.229 --> 03:25:42.239 align:start position:0%
the money out of our bank accounts and
 
03:25:44.070 --> 03:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
out into the communities and we
 
03:25:46.910 --> 03:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
front-loaded applicant um train in
 
03:25:50.070 --> 03:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
technical support and education as a
 
03:25:52.670 --> 03:25:52.680 align:start position:0%
result the average time between when we
 
03:25:54.189 --> 03:25:54.199 align:start position:0%
actually make a grant award and when
 
03:25:56.429 --> 03:25:56.439 align:start position:0%
that first check was put out in the mail
 
03:26:00.309 --> 03:26:00.319 align:start position:0%
dropped from in 2021 13 months to just
 
03:26:02.950 --> 03:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
over 6 months for our 2023 grantees so
 
03:26:04.990 --> 03:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
it's significant
 
03:26:07.309 --> 03:26:07.319 align:start position:0%
change looking ahead over the next four
 
03:26:09.229 --> 03:26:09.239 align:start position:0%
to six years we are expecting to see a
 
03:26:11.070 --> 03:26:11.080 align:start position:0%
pretty dramatic uptick and demands on
 
03:26:13.229 --> 03:26:13.239 align:start position:0%
our program related to long-term
 
03:26:15.710 --> 03:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
stewardship and so we're working very
 
03:26:17.830 --> 03:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
closely with our grant recipients to
 
03:26:19.309 --> 03:26:19.319 align:start position:0%
ensure that they are responsibly
 
03:26:22.030 --> 03:26:22.040 align:start position:0%
stewarding the close to 400 properties
 
03:26:24.349 --> 03:26:24.359 align:start position:0%
across the state that are now under our
 
03:26:27.110 --> 03:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
oversight we are also very hopeful that
 
03:26:29.590 --> 03:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
a more stable interest rate environment
 
03:26:32.269 --> 03:26:32.279 align:start position:0%
or perhaps um a public that is becoming
 
03:26:33.990 --> 03:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
more comfortable with current interest
 
03:26:36.309 --> 03:26:36.319 align:start position:0%
rates will release some of the pent up
 
03:26:38.150 --> 03:26:38.160 align:start position:0%
real estate demand from the past few
 
03:26:40.349 --> 03:26:40.359 align:start position:0%
years and um result in a funding surge
 
03:26:40.359 --> 03:26:41.030 align:start position:0%
years and um result in a funding surge
for

03:26:41.030 --> 03:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:26:44.030 --> 03:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
elip in summary I'm very proud to
 
03:26:46.389 --> 03:26:46.399 align:start position:0%
continue leading this program a program
 
03:26:47.910 --> 03:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
that does not rely on general fund
 
03:26:49.870 --> 03:26:49.880 align:start position:0%
dollars but is nonetheless very
 
03:26:51.590 --> 03:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
committed to the efficient and
 
03:26:54.550 --> 03:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
responsible investment of the Public's
 
03:26:57.030 --> 03:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
monies thank you and I'm happy to answer
 
03:26:57.040 --> 03:26:58.150 align:start position:0%
monies thank you and I'm happy to answer
any

03:26:58.150 --> 03:26:58.160 align:start position:0%
any
 
03:27:00.670 --> 03:27:00.680 align:start position:0%
questions thank you I I think you may
 
03:27:03.030 --> 03:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
have touched in this but in the chart
 
03:27:04.790 --> 03:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
you have and the funds requested it was
 
03:27:06.030 --> 03:27:06.040 align:start position:0%
it was
 
03:27:10.189 --> 03:27:10.199 align:start position:0%
Rising uh steadily uh from 2017 uh
 
03:27:12.510 --> 03:27:12.520 align:start position:0%
through the pandemic to 2021 then it's
 
03:27:14.990 --> 03:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
fallen off since then right uh just a
 
03:27:16.630 --> 03:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
little you mentioned that may they
 
03:27:17.870 --> 03:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
believe that there's not funding
 
03:27:19.189 --> 03:27:19.199 align:start position:0%
available so they don't request is there
 
03:27:21.389 --> 03:27:21.399 align:start position:0%
any other thing behind that drop off in
 
03:27:22.670 --> 03:27:22.680 align:start position:0%
in the funds request so there's a few
 
03:27:25.870 --> 03:27:25.880 align:start position:0%
things that definitely um impact that
 
03:27:27.870 --> 03:27:27.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely they are withholding or
 
03:27:29.269 --> 03:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
holding back on their request we've
 
03:27:31.030 --> 03:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
gotten much better at forecasting how
 
03:27:32.630 --> 03:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
much money we'll have available so we
 
03:27:35.389 --> 03:27:35.399 align:start position:0%
are sending out to applicants you know
 
03:27:36.790 --> 03:27:36.800 align:start position:0%
this is how much we expect so for
 
03:27:39.150 --> 03:27:39.160 align:start position:0%
example I think it was in April that we
 
03:27:41.550 --> 03:27:41.560 align:start position:0%
started predicting we'd have 3.3 million
 
03:27:43.150 --> 03:27:43.160 align:start position:0%
available this year and we're going to
 
03:27:47.070 --> 03:27:47.080 align:start position:0%
come in right at 3.3 million so that has
 
03:27:49.469 --> 03:27:49.479 align:start position:0%
um has dropped some of that uh but
 
03:27:51.830 --> 03:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
there's also a real capacity issue
 
03:27:53.750 --> 03:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
capacity amongst historic districts and
 
03:27:56.510 --> 03:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
commissions to do the work a significant
 
03:27:58.950 --> 03:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
problem with trades crafts people who
 
03:28:01.150 --> 03:28:01.160 align:start position:0%
can do historic preservation so the
 
03:28:04.990 --> 03:28:05.000 align:start position:0%
projects start kind of backing up and um
 
03:28:07.630 --> 03:28:07.640 align:start position:0%
that that's a real slowdown for us and
 
03:28:09.670 --> 03:28:09.680 align:start position:0%
then a capacity in the conservation
 
03:28:11.309 --> 03:28:11.319 align:start position:0%
community in terms of being able to
 
03:28:14.070 --> 03:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
raise the match that's required and and
 
03:28:19.110 --> 03:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:22.030 --> 03:28:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:24.830 --> 03:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
ahead I was just going to remark when we
 
03:28:26.870 --> 03:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
established this program all these 20
 
03:28:30.550 --> 03:28:30.560 align:start position:0%
plus years ago we had envisioned that
 
03:28:32.469 --> 03:28:32.479 align:start position:0%
well the first few years will be getting
 
03:28:34.590 --> 03:28:34.600 align:start position:0%
the best places and after that it's
 
03:28:36.070 --> 03:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
going to be trailing off to the ones
 
03:28:39.030 --> 03:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
that were rejected in the past 20 years
 
03:28:41.510 --> 03:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
so they really aren't worthy as much as
 
03:28:45.550 --> 03:28:45.560 align:start position:0%
the first tranch of five or 10 years so
 
03:28:47.309 --> 03:28:47.319 align:start position:0%
some of that is is
 
03:28:49.910 --> 03:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
still prevalent in many of the minds of
 
03:28:52.870 --> 03:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
the of the legislature that we've got
 
03:28:54.790 --> 03:28:54.800 align:start position:0%
we've done the best projects what's left
 
03:28:57.429 --> 03:28:57.439 align:start position:0%
that's really great so anyway that's a
 
03:28:59.950 --> 03:28:59.960 align:start position:0%
comment thank certainly I think it's an
 
03:29:01.630 --> 03:29:01.640 align:start position:0%
interesting perspective although I will
 
03:29:04.110 --> 03:29:04.120 align:start position:0%
say this I think we are much better at
 
03:29:06.750 --> 03:29:06.760 align:start position:0%
recognizing what's important our our
 
03:29:09.030 --> 03:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
mission is more focused so if you look
 
03:29:10.550 --> 03:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
at the second page of your handout
 
03:29:12.870 --> 03:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
you'll see we we really are looking at
 
03:29:15.389 --> 03:29:15.399 align:start position:0%
for example how can we help get
 
03:29:17.870 --> 03:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
buildings like the Colonial Theater back
 
03:29:19.950 --> 03:29:19.960 align:start position:0%
up and running producing revenues in
 
03:29:22.349 --> 03:29:22.359 align:start position:0%
their communities producing jobs and
 
03:29:24.510 --> 03:29:24.520 align:start position:0%
more maybe more importantly becoming
 
03:29:26.630 --> 03:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
part of everyday life that's a priority
 
03:29:29.030 --> 03:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
now so those that type of thinking has
 
03:29:31.389 --> 03:29:31.399 align:start position:0%
changed although I will give you if I
 
03:29:33.750 --> 03:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
ran the numbers I'm betting that the
 
03:29:35.790 --> 03:29:35.800 align:start position:0%
average number of Acres we conserve each
 
03:29:37.990 --> 03:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
year is probably
 
03:29:40.790 --> 03:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
down perhaps in part due the Connecticut
 
03:29:43.150 --> 03:29:43.160 align:start position:0%
Lakes Headwaters project which was early
 
03:29:47.670 --> 03:29:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:50.870 --> 03:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
I just have a couple questions hi
 
03:29:54.910 --> 03:29:54.920 align:start position:0%
um how were you funded before 2009 um
 
03:29:57.429 --> 03:29:57.439 align:start position:0%
general fund Appropriations and then not
 
03:30:00.429 --> 03:30:00.439 align:start position:0%
funded and um the the initial need was
 
03:30:02.349 --> 03:30:02.359 align:start position:0%
estimated at at least 12 million a year
 
03:30:04.229 --> 03:30:04.239 align:start position:0%
but I think they started the general
 
03:30:07.189 --> 03:30:07.199 align:start position:0%
fund appropriation was around three 3.5
 
03:30:08.830 --> 03:30:08.840 align:start position:0%
and went
 
03:30:12.670 --> 03:30:12.680 align:start position:0%
up okay I just I was curious about that
 
03:30:16.189 --> 03:30:16.199 align:start position:0%
um land um you don't inspect land that's
 
03:30:18.429 --> 03:30:18.439 align:start position:0%
all Steve Walker or do you overlap at
 
03:30:23.309 --> 03:30:23.319 align:start position:0%
all we we um we don't overlap so a few
 
03:30:25.990 --> 03:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
of the projects that Steve watches over
 
03:30:27.750 --> 03:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
may have received elip funding but we do
 
03:30:29.870 --> 03:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
our own inspections and then work with
 
03:30:32.269 --> 03:30:32.279 align:start position:0%
our own applicants so I forget what his
 
03:30:35.710 --> 03:30:35.720 align:start position:0%
number is 150ish properties very few of
 
03:30:37.990 --> 03:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
those overlap with ours those would be
 
03:30:40.269 --> 03:30:40.279 align:start position:0%
the fishing game Properties or dncr
 
03:30:44.389 --> 03:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
properties and and the old elip right
 
03:30:46.030 --> 03:30:46.040 align:start position:0%
right which of course weren't funded by
 
03:30:48.309 --> 03:30:48.319 align:start position:0%
El chip because no he makes that point
 
03:30:50.510 --> 03:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
to me all the time and L chip aren't the
 
03:30:53.389 --> 03:30:53.399 align:start position:0%
same thing yeah and I said to him once I
 
03:30:54.870 --> 03:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
said I'm the only guy you'll ever talk
 
03:30:56.790 --> 03:30:56.800 align:start position:0%
to who knows that he's he's waiting for
 
03:30:58.309 --> 03:30:58.319 align:start position:0%
a call for me he wants to explain his
 
03:31:02.389 --> 03:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
endowment to me so um you go ahead and
 
03:31:06.269 --> 03:31:06.279 align:start position:0%
do that I uh I'll be okay
 
03:31:09.349 --> 03:31:09.359 align:start position:0%
um you do inspection and I'm I'm sort of
 
03:31:11.550 --> 03:31:11.560 align:start position:0%
getting at this you do inspections who
 
03:31:16.189 --> 03:31:16.199 align:start position:0%
who holds the easement there's a mix
 
03:31:18.790 --> 03:31:18.800 align:start position:0%
predominantly held by if if it's we're
 
03:31:20.630 --> 03:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
talking about conservation land held by
 
03:31:22.950 --> 03:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
land trust where so they are the primary
 
03:31:25.670 --> 03:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement entity elip has a backup on
 
03:31:27.150 --> 03:31:27.160 align:start position:0%
behalf of the state of right of
 
03:31:30.469 --> 03:31:30.479 align:start position:0%
enforcement for historic properties elip
 
03:31:33.349 --> 03:31:33.359 align:start position:0%
if we ended up trying to centralized is
 
03:31:35.269 --> 03:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
the wrong word um find efficiencies
 
03:31:38.030 --> 03:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
where the people who inspect you know
 
03:31:40.349 --> 03:31:40.359 align:start position:0%
because the dncr and fishing game and
 
03:31:42.150 --> 03:31:42.160 align:start position:0%
like there inspections happening you are
 
03:31:45.429 --> 03:31:45.439 align:start position:0%
talking my language I there's there's a
 
03:31:48.469 --> 03:31:48.479 align:start position:0%
real need for coordinating that that
 
03:31:52.630 --> 03:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
oversight and stewardship also um the
 
03:31:54.790 --> 03:31:54.800 align:start position:0%
way we handle things from
 
03:31:57.189 --> 03:31:57.199 align:start position:0%
doj where all of these entities who are
 
03:31:59.469 --> 03:31:59.479 align:start position:0%
doing very similar work are have
 
03:32:01.950 --> 03:32:01.960 align:start position:0%
different attorneys and we all know that
 
03:32:05.550 --> 03:32:05.560 align:start position:0%
the law is yeah and that's hard for the
 
03:32:07.389 --> 03:32:07.399 align:start position:0%
applicants it's hard for the land owners
 
03:32:09.429 --> 03:32:09.439 align:start position:0%
it's hard for the agencies and
 
03:32:11.630 --> 03:32:11.640 align:start position:0%
authorities like me and there I have I'd
 
03:32:13.469 --> 03:32:13.479 align:start position:0%
love to talk to you about that well I
 
03:32:15.269 --> 03:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
just think a lot of people should talk
 
03:32:17.389 --> 03:32:17.399 align:start position:0%
to each other and and we should there a
 
03:32:18.550 --> 03:32:18.560 align:start position:0%
bunch of little things in state
 
03:32:20.710 --> 03:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
government that because they're little
 
03:32:22.750 --> 03:32:22.760 align:start position:0%
nobody cares about right and they're
 
03:32:24.510 --> 03:32:24.520 align:start position:0%
like oh what would we say like 50 Grand
 
03:32:26.389 --> 03:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
who cares and you're like well 50 Grand
 
03:32:29.229 --> 03:32:29.239 align:start position:0%
is 50 Grand yeah um it's an Insight of
 
03:32:31.349 --> 03:32:31.359 align:start position:0%
mine 50 Grand is 50 Grand you can write
 
03:32:36.269 --> 03:32:36.279 align:start position:0%
that down um the uh the last thing I
 
03:32:42.990 --> 03:32:43.000 align:start position:0%
swear um bosan so online last night I
 
03:32:45.110 --> 03:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
noticed that bosin is selling their
 
03:32:47.790 --> 03:32:47.800 align:start position:0%
Library have you seen this I have not
 
03:32:49.990 --> 03:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
seen that so the old historic library
 
03:32:52.349 --> 03:32:52.359 align:start position:0%
that they they and so there's somebody
 
03:32:53.910 --> 03:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
online going hey you want to live in a
 
03:32:56.349 --> 03:32:56.359 align:start position:0%
library and it's gorgeous right and it's
 
03:32:59.110 --> 03:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
like 300 Grand or something I I have a
 
03:33:01.349 --> 03:33:01.359 align:start position:0%
house and I can't afford two so I'm good
 
03:33:01.359 --> 03:33:02.910 align:start position:0%
house and I can't afford two so I'm good
but

03:33:02.910 --> 03:33:02.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:33:05.630 --> 03:33:05.640 align:start position:0%
um I'll tell you a story in Hein they
 
03:33:07.469 --> 03:33:07.479 align:start position:0%
have these two cute little buildings
 
03:33:09.870 --> 03:33:09.880 align:start position:0%
that sit side by side one of them was a
 
03:33:12.229 --> 03:33:12.239 align:start position:0%
grange another a chapel now one is a
 
03:33:14.389 --> 03:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
library and they are working to turn the
 
03:33:15.990 --> 03:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
other into Community Center and they
 
03:33:17.630 --> 03:33:17.640 align:start position:0%
went out to the town and said Do you
 
03:33:19.910 --> 03:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
want to build a new library so you have
 
03:33:22.630 --> 03:33:22.640 align:start position:0%
more space we like no we love our little
 
03:33:25.590 --> 03:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
library and so we're uh potentially F we
 
03:33:27.070 --> 03:33:27.080 align:start position:0%
make our funding decisions Monday
 
03:33:29.150 --> 03:33:29.160 align:start position:0%
potentially helping them do that but
 
03:33:30.590 --> 03:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
libraries are interesting a lot of them
 
03:33:32.710 --> 03:33:32.720 align:start position:0%
were donated and have to stay libraries
 
03:33:34.469 --> 03:33:34.479 align:start position:0%
and so this is a this is that kind of
 
03:33:36.030 --> 03:33:36.040 align:start position:0%
thing where it hasn't been a library for
 
03:33:37.870 --> 03:33:37.880 align:start position:0%
quite some time and the town has
 
03:33:40.830 --> 03:33:40.840 align:start position:0%
struggled to to keep up with owning it
 
03:33:42.389 --> 03:33:42.399 align:start position:0%
and uh and there'll be covenants
 
03:33:43.510 --> 03:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
attached to it and you have to accept
 
03:33:45.189 --> 03:33:45.199 align:start position:0%
them but it's you know it's a beautiful
 
03:33:45.199 --> 03:33:46.469 align:start position:0%
them but it's you know it's a beautiful
building

03:33:46.469 --> 03:33:46.479 align:start position:0%
building
 
03:33:48.389 --> 03:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
some probably I was going to say
 
03:33:50.710 --> 03:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
Georgian qualities but maybe not exactly
 
03:33:53.349 --> 03:33:53.359 align:start position:0%
and um I just looked at it and I thought
 
03:33:54.790 --> 03:33:54.800 align:start position:0%
you know maybe somebody's going to buy
 
03:33:56.950 --> 03:33:56.960 align:start position:0%
it maybe not but I would hate for it to
 
03:33:58.429 --> 03:33:58.439 align:start position:0%
fall apart and I thought somebody should
 
03:34:00.670 --> 03:34:00.680 align:start position:0%
go in that who's like a you know it's
 
03:34:02.030 --> 03:34:02.040 align:start position:0%
not big enough for a state agency
 
03:34:04.309 --> 03:34:04.319 align:start position:0%
because it's it's a little old library
 
03:34:07.590 --> 03:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
but right how big your staff I think um
 
03:34:08.990 --> 03:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
I think it's in New Boston they're
 
03:34:10.710 --> 03:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
talking about repurposing a building
 
03:34:12.429 --> 03:34:12.439 align:start position:0%
where they don't have room to go to full
 
03:34:15.150 --> 03:34:15.160 align:start position:0%
full day kindergarten so they're oh it's
 
03:34:17.349 --> 03:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
a fire station and they're going to move
 
03:34:19.229 --> 03:34:19.239 align:start position:0%
to the new five like we could turn that
 
03:34:21.910 --> 03:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
into a preschool or you know sometimes
 
03:34:23.670 --> 03:34:23.680 align:start position:0%
there's some overflow needs in a town
 
03:34:25.429 --> 03:34:25.439 align:start position:0%
for something else parks and wreck a
 
03:34:27.349 --> 03:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
great one to move into a standalone
 
03:34:29.229 --> 03:34:29.239 align:start position:0%
building so I'm just saying if you
 
03:34:30.950 --> 03:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
currently rent space you might goog go
 
03:34:30.960 --> 03:34:31.950 align:start position:0%
currently rent space you might goog go

next page and fourth P um page four has
 
04:37:13.109 --> 04:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
the uh the organization chart of the
 
04:37:16.070 --> 04:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
treasury we have 22 positions approved
 
04:37:18.910 --> 04:37:18.920 align:start position:0%
positions five and classified and 17 uh
 
04:37:21.269 --> 04:37:21.279 align:start position:0%
classified we currently have two
 
04:37:23.869 --> 04:37:23.879 align:start position:0%
vacancies on page five I'll just start
 
04:37:26.470 --> 04:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
with the uh overview of the of the
 
04:37:29.470 --> 04:37:29.480 align:start position:0%
actual budget so so um we were able to
 
04:37:32.590 --> 04:37:32.600 align:start position:0%
meet the governor's Target um the uh the
 
04:37:34.910 --> 04:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
only difference between our department
 
04:37:36.429 --> 04:37:36.439 align:start position:0%
and probably other agency says that we
 
04:37:38.709 --> 04:37:38.719 align:start position:0%
had to separate that service uh the
 
04:37:40.310 --> 04:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
state has made a commitment to pay that
 
04:37:42.070 --> 04:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
service so we had to
 
04:37:45.670 --> 04:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
um request that that was um not part of
 
04:37:47.949 --> 04:37:47.959 align:start position:0%
um the reduction that was requested so
 
04:37:50.150 --> 04:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
for the rest of our our budget we were
 
04:37:52.670 --> 04:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
able to meet uh the Target that was um
 
04:37:54.109 --> 04:37:54.119 align:start position:0%
requested by the
 
04:37:58.830 --> 04:37:58.840 align:start position:0%
governor so um again on page five is uh
 
04:38:00.590 --> 04:38:00.600 align:start position:0%
just uh briefly highlighting a few
 
04:38:02.429 --> 04:38:02.439 align:start position:0%
points of the treasure operations in
 
04:38:06.269 --> 04:38:06.279 align:start position:0%
that um in the budget book is page
 
04:38:09.470 --> 04:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
10 and um the only um the only
 
04:38:11.590 --> 04:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
difference uh with this budget is is
 
04:38:13.709 --> 04:38:13.719 align:start position:0%
doing is is is proposing is we are
 
04:38:15.349 --> 04:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
moving three positions from other
 
04:38:18.390 --> 04:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
divisions to the treasury operations uh
 
04:38:21.029 --> 04:38:21.039 align:start position:0%
Division and that's because of the anti
 
04:38:23.150 --> 04:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
um some of um changes that we're
 
04:38:27.070 --> 04:38:27.080 align:start position:0%
anticipating with um the upgrade of the
 
04:38:29.269 --> 04:38:29.279 align:start position:0%
financial system so we are again
 
04:38:30.949 --> 04:38:30.959 align:start position:0%
anticipating those changes and we we
 
04:38:32.949 --> 04:38:32.959 align:start position:0%
would like to make those changes um in
 
04:38:37.269 --> 04:38:37.279 align:start position:0%
this budget we also um respect
 
04:38:40.230 --> 04:38:40.240 align:start position:0%
respectfully requested a uh one position
 
04:38:41.750 --> 04:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
um and this is because we're we're going
 
04:38:44.510 --> 04:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
to um we have plans to incorporate about
 
04:38:47.230 --> 04:38:47.240 align:start position:0%
40 um trust and custodial accounts that
 
04:38:49.670 --> 04:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
are currently handled off books um those
 
04:38:52.189 --> 04:38:52.199 align:start position:0%
will be part of the um
 
04:38:55.709 --> 04:38:55.719 align:start position:0%
implementation um of the of of the again
 
04:38:57.869 --> 04:38:57.879 align:start position:0%
the the upgrade of the financial system
 
04:39:00.109 --> 04:39:00.119 align:start position:0%
we have uh plans to inter incorporate
 
04:39:01.789 --> 04:39:01.799 align:start position:0%
all those all those accounts in the
 
04:39:05.230 --> 04:39:05.240 align:start position:0%
accounting system um so there um again
 
04:39:07.990 --> 04:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
four about 40 accounts that are going to
 
04:39:10.750 --> 04:39:10.760 align:start position:0%
uh be um added to the system and those
 
04:39:12.990 --> 04:39:13.000 align:start position:0%
are about approximately 1,000
 
04:39:16.910 --> 04:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
transactions um annually the um again
 
04:39:20.709 --> 04:39:20.719 align:start position:0%
the request of this position was um was
 
04:39:23.629 --> 04:39:23.639 align:start position:0%
uh considering the the the targeting uh
 
04:39:26.070 --> 04:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
requested by the
 
04:39:29.189 --> 04:39:29.199 align:start position:0%
governor on page uh on page six of the
 
04:39:32.869 --> 04:39:32.879 align:start position:0%
handout um just briefly um I'm discuss
 
04:39:36.189 --> 04:39:36.199 align:start position:0%
um um mentioning the distribution um to
 
04:39:38.110 --> 04:39:38.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh we included in our
 
04:39:39.708 --> 04:39:39.718 align:start position:0%
budget and that's on page 13 of the
 
04:39:43.230 --> 04:39:43.240 align:start position:0%
budget book uh we included uh in our PRI
 
04:39:46.110 --> 04:39:46.120 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs um the state revenue
 
04:39:49.390 --> 04:39:49.400 align:start position:0%
sharing um to municipalities this still
 
04:39:53.628 --> 04:39:53.638 align:start position:0%
in law is RS say 31- a and that's that's
 
04:39:55.430 --> 04:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
the reason we includeed in our budget
 
04:39:57.750 --> 04:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
with the last bayum this this this
 
04:40:00.470 --> 04:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
portion of um of the law has been
 
04:40:02.868 --> 04:40:02.878 align:start position:0%
suspended uh in House Bill too but we
 
04:40:05.550 --> 04:40:05.560 align:start position:0%
include it in our budget uh we used the
 
04:40:07.708 --> 04:40:07.718 align:start position:0%
budget for meon Room St distribution
 
04:40:09.430 --> 04:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
that's still in in our in our county
 
04:40:12.310 --> 04:40:12.320 align:start position:0%
unit and our in our in our department
 
04:40:13.948 --> 04:40:13.958 align:start position:0%
but it's no longer budgeted but I just
 
04:40:17.470 --> 04:40:17.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:20.390 --> 04:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
briefly um moving on to page seven
 
04:40:23.788 --> 04:40:23.798 align:start position:0%
that's um of the description of the
 
04:40:25.470 --> 04:40:25.480 align:start position:0%
office of investment and debt management
 
04:40:30.830 --> 04:40:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:34.430 --> 04:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
book um this um this is is relates to
 
04:40:37.510 --> 04:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
the administration of this office um
 
04:40:40.590 --> 04:40:40.600 align:start position:0%
again due to um the just one more
 
04:40:42.470 --> 04:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
highlight is two positions currently
 
04:40:44.230 --> 04:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
approving cash receipts those are being
 
04:40:46.628 --> 04:40:46.638 align:start position:0%
moved to the reconciliation unit under
 
04:40:49.150 --> 04:40:49.160 align:start position:0%
the treasury Operations Division and
 
04:40:51.470 --> 04:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
that again is is the plan is to start in
 
04:40:51.480 --> 04:40:52.910 align:start position:0%
that again is is the plan is to start in
fisure

04:40:52.910 --> 04:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
fisure
 
04:40:56.190 --> 04:40:56.200 align:start position:0%
26 uh this um this part of the budget
 
04:40:58.550 --> 04:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
also includes our debt service um and
 
04:41:03.510 --> 04:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:06.470 --> 04:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
book so we have uh and the treasure we
 
04:41:08.310 --> 04:41:08.320 align:start position:0%
house all the debt service that is paid
 
04:41:13.350 --> 04:41:13.360 align:start position:0%
with General funds and um we include um
 
04:41:16.310 --> 04:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh again all of De Service uh for the
 
04:41:18.990 --> 04:41:19.000 align:start position:0%
state and also the Deb service for the
 
04:41:20.910 --> 04:41:20.920 align:start position:0%
University C Hampshire they're both paid
 
04:41:24.470 --> 04:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
with General funds um in general ofended
 
04:41:25.590 --> 04:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
debt is
 
04:41:28.230 --> 04:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
declining uh the way we structure our
 
04:41:30.948 --> 04:41:30.958 align:start position:0%
debt is we pay approximately 60% of the
 
04:41:32.750 --> 04:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
principal during the first 10 years and
 
04:41:35.868 --> 04:41:35.878 align:start position:0%
the rest the other the other 40% uh
 
04:41:38.230 --> 04:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
during the last 10 years and with that
 
04:41:40.070 --> 04:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
allows us to have a decline in Deb
 
04:41:43.430 --> 04:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
service however um during this time we
 
04:41:45.670 --> 04:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
had to uh incorporate an additional
 
04:41:47.788 --> 04:41:47.798 align:start position:0%
Capital appropriation that was approved
 
04:41:50.070 --> 04:41:50.080 align:start position:0%
by the legislature this this this past
 
04:41:53.708 --> 04:41:53.718 align:start position:0%
session uh in in that um that was an
 
04:41:55.030 --> 04:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
additional 40 million in capital
 
04:41:57.910 --> 04:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
Appropriations so um The Debt Service
 
04:42:01.110 --> 04:42:01.120 align:start position:0%
beginning in Fisk year 27 um begins to
 
04:42:03.350 --> 04:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
increase um due to that additional
 
04:42:05.550 --> 04:42:05.560 align:start position:0%
appropriation so this Debt Service
 
04:42:08.230 --> 04:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
includes again existant debt um that we
 
04:42:10.628 --> 04:42:10.638 align:start position:0%
have and also it assumes that we will be
 
04:42:14.390 --> 04:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
ising a roim 60% um not 60% approximate
 
04:42:18.110 --> 04:42:18.120 align:start position:0%
60 million in bonds each
 
04:42:21.590 --> 04:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
year uh regarding the um university
 
04:42:23.788 --> 04:42:23.798 align:start position:0%
system we are making the assumption that
 
04:42:25.910 --> 04:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
we will issue approximately 10 million
 
04:42:28.470 --> 04:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
each year um this is just these are just
 
04:42:30.590 --> 04:42:30.600 align:start position:0%
conservative uh conservative uh
 
04:42:33.150 --> 04:42:33.160 align:start position:0%
projections of course we're not sure how
 
04:42:34.830 --> 04:42:34.840 align:start position:0%
how much will get approved in the
 
04:42:36.470 --> 04:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
capital budget but we typically build
 
04:42:38.708 --> 04:42:38.718 align:start position:0%
those estimates in our projections of
 
04:42:43.230 --> 04:42:43.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:50.070 --> 04:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
and then um is on page 27 um page 20 n
 
04:42:52.830 --> 04:42:52.840 align:start position:0%
actually page 29 we have the de service
 
04:42:54.788 --> 04:42:54.798 align:start position:0%
of school Bill and a that's just being
 
04:42:57.430 --> 04:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
paid off we have approximately five
 
04:43:00.750 --> 04:43:00.760 align:start position:0%
years left um for that Bond and we're
 
04:43:04.708 --> 04:43:04.718 align:start position:0%
just um budgeting for the existing Debt
 
04:43:09.030 --> 04:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
Service on page 30 we have um The Debt
 
04:43:11.628 --> 04:43:11.638 align:start position:0%
Service for the color um
 
04:43:14.310 --> 04:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
community college system um they also
 
04:43:16.990 --> 04:43:17.000 align:start position:0%
have um we're also just paying existing
 
04:43:18.390 --> 04:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
debt there's no assumptions that we will
 
04:43:20.230 --> 04:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
issue new debt they have an issue new
 
04:43:22.110 --> 04:43:22.120 align:start position:0%
Deb in several years as a reason we're
 
04:43:25.390 --> 04:43:25.400 align:start position:0%
not uh projecting we assuming that uh we
 
04:43:28.190 --> 04:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
we will have um additional issues for
 
04:43:30.030 --> 04:43:30.040 align:start position:0%
for the for the system however if that
 
04:43:36.510 --> 04:43:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:39.150 --> 04:43:39.160 align:start position:0%
estimates so that covered that service
 
04:43:43.470 --> 04:43:43.480 align:start position:0%
and um I'll move on move now to um page
 
04:43:47.390 --> 04:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
eight and that um just briefly discusses
 
04:43:50.350 --> 04:43:50.360 align:start position:0%
the abandon property program um this
 
04:43:53.190 --> 04:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
this this is on page 48 of your of the
 
04:43:53.200 --> 04:43:54.788 align:start position:0%
this this is on page 48 of your of the
budget

04:43:54.788 --> 04:43:54.798 align:start position:0%
budget
 
04:43:58.350 --> 04:43:58.360 align:start position:0%
book and um this is this is just the
 
04:44:00.270 --> 04:44:00.280 align:start position:0%
budget of the operating cost of the
 
04:44:03.110 --> 04:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
division um that was um there were no
 
04:44:06.270 --> 04:44:06.280 align:start position:0%
significant changes from prior years uh
 
04:44:08.990 --> 04:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
we just um we were to meet the request
 
04:44:11.430 --> 04:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
of the governor to maintain uh the
 
04:44:15.350 --> 04:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
budget at the same level of as fisc year
 
04:44:20.550 --> 04:44:20.560 align:start position:0%
25 on page uh 57 of the budget
 
04:44:25.270 --> 04:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
book well we um we have the the budget
 
04:44:27.430 --> 04:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
of the college servant advisory
 
04:44:29.430 --> 04:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
commission there are two pieces that are
 
04:44:33.470 --> 04:44:33.480 align:start position:0%
part of that um of that commission one
 
04:44:36.070 --> 04:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
is uh it relates to the New Hampshire
 
04:44:37.708 --> 04:44:37.718 align:start position:0%
excellence and higher education trust
 
04:44:39.990 --> 04:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
fund a portion of that fund flows
 
04:44:41.910 --> 04:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
through our budget
 
04:44:44.708 --> 04:44:44.718 align:start position:0%
um we have the expenses the expenditures
 
04:44:48.150 --> 04:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
of the the administerial costs of of the
 
04:44:50.150 --> 04:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
commission and running the college SS
 
04:44:52.868 --> 04:44:52.878 align:start position:0%
program and also the three scholarship
 
04:44:55.708 --> 04:44:55.718 align:start position:0%
two scholarship programs um that are
 
04:45:00.510 --> 04:45:00.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:04.628 --> 04:45:04.638 align:start position:0%
fund the other program under that um the
 
04:45:06.350 --> 04:45:06.360 align:start position:0%
oversight of the commission and again we
 
04:45:08.868 --> 04:45:08.878 align:start position:0%
have the overs sign of the treasury um I
 
04:45:13.510 --> 04:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
am the trustee of of the color s uh plan
 
04:45:15.910 --> 04:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
and because of that we we maintain that
 
04:45:18.310 --> 04:45:18.320 align:start position:0%
administ we do some Administration on
 
04:45:20.390 --> 04:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
behalf of the commission so we the other
 
04:45:21.990 --> 04:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
program is the governor scholarship fund
 
04:45:25.550 --> 04:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
and that's on page 58 of the budget
 
04:45:28.070 --> 04:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
book um that program has been
 
04:45:31.110 --> 04:45:31.120 align:start position:0%
historically funded with General funds
 
04:45:32.788 --> 04:45:32.798 align:start position:0%
um that was the only program we had to
 
04:45:34.510 --> 04:45:34.520 align:start position:0%
adjust in order to meet the governor's
 
04:45:36.708 --> 04:45:36.718 align:start position:0%
budget we we in the past we have
 
04:45:38.788 --> 04:45:38.798 align:start position:0%
received about 3 million in funding to
 
04:45:41.670 --> 04:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
maintain that program this time uh we
 
04:45:44.190 --> 04:45:44.200 align:start position:0%
are requesting 2.7 million to to
 
04:45:48.390 --> 04:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:50.590 --> 04:45:50.600 align:start position:0%
program and the last page on the hand
 
04:45:53.670 --> 04:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
out is uh page nine and and that uh
 
04:45:57.230 --> 04:45:57.240 align:start position:0%
covers um we have the budget of the Ben
 
04:46:00.670 --> 04:46:00.680 align:start position:0%
Thompson trust fund we have to um
 
04:46:02.830 --> 04:46:02.840 align:start position:0%
distribute quarterly payments to the
 
04:46:05.910 --> 04:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
beneficiary uh which is uh the univers
 
04:46:07.230 --> 04:46:07.240 align:start position:0%
uh University of New Hampshire as a
 
04:46:09.670 --> 04:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
beneficiary of this trust and we
 
04:46:13.628 --> 04:46:13.638 align:start position:0%
distribute uh Cor payments to them we um
 
04:46:16.310 --> 04:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
as part of this budget we are requesting
 
04:46:18.270 --> 04:46:18.280 align:start position:0%
um we've been having conversation the
 
04:46:20.270 --> 04:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
treasury has having conversations with
 
04:46:22.590 --> 04:46:22.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice and the university
 
04:46:27.310 --> 04:46:27.320 align:start position:0%
system to be able to um uh potentially
 
04:46:29.548 --> 04:46:29.558 align:start position:0%
move those funds and that trust to be
 
04:46:32.430 --> 04:46:32.440 align:start position:0%
under the oversight of the UNH
 
04:46:35.910 --> 04:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
Foundation um so uh in order to to
 
04:46:38.350 --> 04:46:38.360 align:start position:0%
proceed with that process um we will
 
04:46:40.910 --> 04:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
have to uh repeal some of the laws the
 
04:46:42.708 --> 04:46:42.718 align:start position:0%
law that requires a treasury to have
 
04:46:46.628 --> 04:46:46.638 align:start position:0%
that trust and so we are um um
 
04:46:48.270 --> 04:46:48.280 align:start position:0%
requesting that we include that in house
 
04:46:52.150 --> 04:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
bill to to repeal the laws that
 
04:46:55.230 --> 04:46:55.240 align:start position:0%
um currently related to the uh Ben thums
 
04:46:58.110 --> 04:46:58.120 align:start position:0%
and Trust uh Fund in in in order to
 
04:46:59.830 --> 04:46:59.840 align:start position:0%
continue our discussions and in the
 
04:47:02.150 --> 04:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
process with Department of Justice to to
 
04:47:04.590 --> 04:47:04.600 align:start position:0%
request and to to move that request a
 
04:47:07.590 --> 04:47:07.600 align:start position:0%
petition of um deviation uh that the
 
04:47:09.830 --> 04:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
courts will have to approve and if that
 
04:47:11.628 --> 04:47:11.638 align:start position:0%
happens um then
 
04:47:14.110 --> 04:47:14.120 align:start position:0%
um the court will decide how the fund is
 
04:47:16.708 --> 04:47:16.718 align:start position:0%
going to be um managed but the plan will
 
04:47:19.750 --> 04:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
be that the university uh um the UNH
 
04:47:21.270 --> 04:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
foundation will manage that fund so
 
04:47:22.670 --> 04:47:22.680 align:start position:0%
that's part of our discussion as part of
 
04:47:24.670 --> 04:47:24.680 align:start position:0%
our proposal uh and that's what we're
 
04:47:27.030 --> 04:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
asking uh in house
 
04:47:29.708 --> 04:47:29.718 align:start position:0%
too um and on page nine I'm also
 
04:47:32.350 --> 04:47:32.360 align:start position:0%
mentioning um the elip and the Community
 
04:47:34.910 --> 04:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
Development uh block uh gr those are
 
04:47:36.910 --> 04:47:36.920 align:start position:0%
just uh includ in our budget to
 
04:47:39.190 --> 04:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
facilitate the Appropriations but I
 
04:47:41.430 --> 04:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
believe um the agencies
 
04:47:44.948 --> 04:47:44.958 align:start position:0%
those um um those agencies were able to
 
04:47:46.390 --> 04:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
discuss their portion of the budget
 
04:47:47.590 --> 04:47:47.600 align:start position:0%
earlier this
 
04:47:50.270 --> 04:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
morning and those are just essentially
 
04:47:51.750 --> 04:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
um we are just housing their
 
04:47:53.590 --> 04:47:53.600 align:start position:0%
appropriation in our
 
04:47:57.350 --> 04:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
budget um also the last piece couple of
 
04:48:00.470 --> 04:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
requests that we are um suggesting house
 
04:48:03.510 --> 04:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
bill to was the to um there two laws
 
04:48:06.868 --> 04:48:06.878 align:start position:0%
that we're um requesting to to amend one
 
04:48:10.110 --> 04:48:10.120 align:start position:0%
is that that we allow um is removing the
 
04:48:12.150 --> 04:48:12.160 align:start position:0%
Restriction of having two assistant
 
04:48:15.030 --> 04:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
treasurers um and that will allow me to
 
04:48:18.628 --> 04:48:18.638 align:start position:0%
um uh reclassify uh a position that is a
 
04:48:21.590 --> 04:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
classify that uh we would like to have
 
04:48:24.350 --> 04:48:24.360 align:start position:0%
that as an classified position and the
 
04:48:26.788 --> 04:48:26.798 align:start position:0%
other amendment is to abide the law that
 
04:48:28.470 --> 04:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
will that that will assist state
 
04:48:30.788 --> 04:48:30.798 align:start position:0%
agencies in meeting The Debt Service
 
04:48:32.990 --> 04:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
obligation and to to allow those funds
 
04:48:35.708 --> 04:48:35.718 align:start position:0%
to lapse in the second year of the vium
 
04:48:37.628 --> 04:48:37.638 align:start position:0%
and not in the first year that's just to
 
04:48:40.910 --> 04:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
facilitate um the the management of
 
04:48:43.190 --> 04:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
service by state agencies treasure
 
04:48:45.270 --> 04:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
usually has that in their foot in in the
 
04:48:47.750 --> 04:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
budget footnote uh but agencies will
 
04:48:50.430 --> 04:48:50.440 align:start position:0%
also benefit from that um the ability to
 
04:48:52.830 --> 04:48:52.840 align:start position:0%
to lapse the funds in the in the second
 
04:48:55.350 --> 04:48:55.360 align:start position:0%
year of the banum and that concludes my
 
04:48:58.868 --> 04:48:58.878 align:start position:0%
presentation I U be happy to answer any
 
04:49:02.230 --> 04:49:02.240 align:start position:0%
questions okay thank you uh just a a
 
04:49:03.910 --> 04:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
real quick question here the you
 
04:49:05.708 --> 04:49:05.718 align:start position:0%
mentioned that the debt service is
 
04:49:07.868 --> 04:49:07.878 align:start position:0%
expected to increase in the next bium
 
04:49:09.830 --> 04:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
and you mentioned the Men's prison
 
04:49:11.270 --> 04:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
that's from the 40 Mill million doll
 
04:49:12.590 --> 04:49:12.600 align:start position:0%
that was approved by the legislature for
 
04:49:15.430 --> 04:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
that and it doesn't include anything the
 
04:49:17.750 --> 04:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
other hundreds of millions that's going
 
04:49:19.310 --> 04:49:19.320 align:start position:0%
to come because it hasn't obviously been
 
04:49:21.510 --> 04:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
authorized yet that is correct we did
 
04:49:23.670 --> 04:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
not assume any additional debt only the
 
04:49:26.310 --> 04:49:26.320 align:start position:0%
40 million um that was already
 
04:49:30.470 --> 04:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:33.230 --> 04:49:33.240 align:start position:0%
you so you have about a 10% increase
 
04:49:36.548 --> 04:49:36.558 align:start position:0%
over the from 2004 to 2007 in the in the
 
04:49:40.310 --> 04:49:40.320 align:start position:0%
general funded Debt Service um Line Is
 
04:49:44.750 --> 04:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
It that's not entirely from the prison
 
04:49:47.548 --> 04:49:47.558 align:start position:0%
right we are we borrowing more or
 
04:49:50.190 --> 04:49:50.200 align:start position:0%
interest rates going up we're not it is
 
04:49:51.628 --> 04:49:51.638 align:start position:0%
really it's really the addition
 
04:49:53.590 --> 04:49:53.600 align:start position:0%
additional debt is has to do with that
 
04:49:55.868 --> 04:49:55.878 align:start position:0%
additional 40 million it really is just
 
04:49:57.750 --> 04:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
it's all that other than that it will
 
04:49:59.270 --> 04:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
just we will again we've been assuming
 
04:50:01.590 --> 04:50:01.600 align:start position:0%
that we will issue 60 million each year
 
04:50:02.910 --> 04:50:02.920 align:start position:0%
and again because of the structure that
 
04:50:05.110 --> 04:50:05.120 align:start position:0%
we have with our debt it typically
 
04:50:09.070 --> 04:50:09.080 align:start position:0%
declines um so I again that's primarily
 
04:50:10.910 --> 04:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
the reason for the increase and then it
 
04:50:13.190 --> 04:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
will continue to increase after that
 
04:50:16.230 --> 04:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
okay cool um two other questions
 
04:50:19.590 --> 04:50:19.600 align:start position:0%
interest and um abandoned property
 
04:50:21.670 --> 04:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
they're Revenue questions so we used to
 
04:50:22.910 --> 04:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
get two or three million a year in
 
04:50:24.948 --> 04:50:24.958 align:start position:0%
interest payments and we're get we got
 
04:50:28.150 --> 04:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
94 million last year um thank you
 
04:50:30.788 --> 04:50:30.798 align:start position:0%
because without that we might not have
 
04:50:33.110 --> 04:50:33.120 align:start position:0%
made budget um well that and something
 
04:50:36.270 --> 04:50:36.280 align:start position:0%
else um it's going to start declining
 
04:50:38.190 --> 04:50:38.200 align:start position:0%
your your projections in in the budget
 
04:50:40.470 --> 04:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
document or for decline in the 40 to 50
 
04:50:43.030 --> 04:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
r range how confident are you in that
 
04:50:44.590 --> 04:50:44.600 align:start position:0%
number and and I know it's cuz we have
 
04:50:48.110 --> 04:50:48.120 align:start position:0%
all this giant arpa thing hanging over
 
04:50:49.390 --> 04:50:49.400 align:start position:0%
our heads and we're starting to spend it
 
04:50:53.230 --> 04:50:53.240 align:start position:0%
like it's going out of style um is that
 
04:50:55.910 --> 04:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
number a fairly realistic number are you
 
04:50:57.270 --> 04:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
conservative are
 
04:51:01.788 --> 04:51:01.798 align:start position:0%
you guessing uh uh so that I think that
 
04:51:04.270 --> 04:51:04.280 align:start position:0%
number was uh it was because of the time
 
04:51:07.110 --> 04:51:07.120 align:start position:0%
when I was that you know I was um asked
 
04:51:08.590 --> 04:51:08.600 align:start position:0%
to produce that
 
04:51:11.150 --> 04:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
number the market is changing constantly
 
04:51:13.230 --> 04:51:13.240 align:start position:0%
so in my confident I think what I can
 
04:51:15.390 --> 04:51:15.400 align:start position:0%
say is I should probably update that
 
04:51:18.270 --> 04:51:18.280 align:start position:0%
number like frequently just because the
 
04:51:20.190 --> 04:51:20.200 align:start position:0%
market has changed significantly whether
 
04:51:21.910 --> 04:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
it was uh you know the expectation that
 
04:51:23.948 --> 04:51:23.958 align:start position:0%
the rate cuts are going to happen in you
 
04:51:25.670 --> 04:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
know more quickly now it doesn't appear
 
04:51:27.708 --> 04:51:27.718 align:start position:0%
that's going to be the case so all of
 
04:51:30.788 --> 04:51:30.798 align:start position:0%
those changes um you know I weren't
 
04:51:34.628 --> 04:51:34.638 align:start position:0%
incorporated then now I have to um again
 
04:51:36.548 --> 04:51:36.558 align:start position:0%
my expectations I'll be updating those
 
04:51:38.948 --> 04:51:38.958 align:start position:0%
those estimates regularly especially
 
04:51:41.628 --> 04:51:41.638 align:start position:0%
every time the the the for meets to
 
04:51:43.708 --> 04:51:43.718 align:start position:0%
understand again what that's H what is
 
04:51:45.190 --> 04:51:45.200 align:start position:0%
happening and also how the market is
 
04:51:47.230 --> 04:51:47.240 align:start position:0%
reacting to things so I'll be able to
 
04:51:48.868 --> 04:51:48.878 align:start position:0%
update that all the way until the end of
 
04:51:50.750 --> 04:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
the budget process do you think uh you
 
04:51:52.590 --> 04:51:52.600 align:start position:0%
might have a update as soon as say the
 
04:51:55.190 --> 04:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
end of the month I'm thinking when in
 
04:51:56.510 --> 04:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
December I should be able to meet
 
04:51:58.230 --> 04:51:58.240 align:start position:0%
there's really no additional projections
 
04:52:00.670 --> 04:52:00.680 align:start position:0%
that the F Reserve produced this time so
 
04:52:02.190 --> 04:52:02.200 align:start position:0%
um right now the market is up and down
 
04:52:04.150 --> 04:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
so I think um mid December I should have
 
04:52:06.150 --> 04:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
better numbers when again when the when
 
04:52:07.750 --> 04:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
there's the next meeting how much of
 
04:52:09.350 --> 04:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
that that is based on interest rate and
 
04:52:11.070 --> 04:52:11.080 align:start position:0%
how much is based on the the spending
 
04:52:13.510 --> 04:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
down the of all the money Taylor gave
 
04:52:15.788 --> 04:52:15.798 align:start position:0%
us it really has
 
04:52:21.990 --> 04:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
not um so so so both um both um arpa is
 
04:52:24.510 --> 04:52:24.520 align:start position:0%
the spending is slow unless that changes
 
04:52:26.990 --> 04:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
significantly over the next few months
 
04:52:29.030 --> 04:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
then then then then I will have to
 
04:52:31.708 --> 04:52:31.718 align:start position:0%
consider that but but right now what's
 
04:52:34.110 --> 04:52:34.120 align:start position:0%
this the the cash balance is decreasing
 
04:52:35.590 --> 04:52:35.600 align:start position:0%
because of the additional spending that
 
04:52:38.350 --> 04:52:38.360 align:start position:0%
was approved in the last bium um so the
 
04:52:40.190 --> 04:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
spending rate has increased there's no
 
04:52:40.200 --> 04:52:41.190 align:start position:0%
spending rate has increased there's no
doubt

04:52:41.190 --> 04:52:41.200 align:start position:0%
doubt
 
04:52:43.670 --> 04:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
um so again we're monitoring all that
 
04:52:45.430 --> 04:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
and and trying to really estimate what's
 
04:52:47.510 --> 04:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
happening but also seeing the spending
 
04:52:50.430 --> 04:52:50.440 align:start position:0%
rate um again the change there's a
 
04:52:52.750 --> 04:52:52.760 align:start position:0%
change for sure and then your your
 
04:52:56.270 --> 04:52:56.280 align:start position:0%
cheats um the abandoned property numbers
 
04:52:59.948 --> 04:52:59.958 align:start position:0%
are um projected for 25 at 22 million up
 
04:53:04.030 --> 04:53:04.040 align:start position:0%
to 23 up to 26 um yet in 24 we were only
 
04:53:08.270 --> 04:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
at like well let's call it 20 are we you
 
04:53:11.430 --> 04:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
are expecting them to go up or we level
 
04:53:14.310 --> 04:53:14.320 align:start position:0%
off it is possible goes up I mean those
 
04:53:16.670 --> 04:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
numbers are again is is what we know
 
04:53:20.270 --> 04:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
today we use a a 10e average to estimate
 
04:53:22.310 --> 04:53:22.320 align:start position:0%
that and the you know I was mentioned
 
04:53:25.470 --> 04:53:25.480 align:start position:0%
the the we know how much we have um
 
04:53:26.910 --> 04:53:26.920 align:start position:0%
received in property but we don't know
 
04:53:29.750 --> 04:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
as a portion that we liquidate uh at the
 
04:53:32.390 --> 04:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
end of the three years that depends on
 
04:53:34.310 --> 04:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
the the performance of the the Capital
 
04:53:35.750 --> 04:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
Market so that's the piece that is
 
04:53:39.470 --> 04:53:39.480 align:start position:0%
always available um and that has been an
 
04:53:41.110 --> 04:53:41.120 align:start position:0%
average of about
 
04:53:44.110 --> 04:53:44.120 align:start position:0%
four million over the last few years so
 
04:53:46.510 --> 04:53:46.520 align:start position:0%
again if that changes drastically then
 
04:53:48.190 --> 04:53:48.200 align:start position:0%
then obviously I will update those
 
04:53:50.750 --> 04:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
numbers too but uh but again I think
 
04:53:53.310 --> 04:53:53.320 align:start position:0%
those are those are pretty good numbers
 
04:53:56.150 --> 04:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
I will think so yes okay good thank you
 
04:53:56.160 --> 04:53:57.310 align:start position:0%
I will think so yes okay good thank you
very

04:53:57.310 --> 04:53:57.320 align:start position:0%
very
 
04:54:00.110 --> 04:54:00.120 align:start position:0%
much you're welcome thank you very much
 
04:54:02.310 --> 04:54:02.320 align:start position:0%
for your testimony thank
 
04:54:05.230 --> 04:54:05.240 align:start position:0%
you like to call up now the uh
 
04:54:06.708 --> 04:54:06.718 align:start position:0%
Department of Business and economic
 
04:54:25.510 --> 04:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:36.670 --> 04:54:36.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:38.990 --> 04:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
afternoon so I think I'll just give a
 
04:54:41.310 --> 04:54:41.320 align:start position:0%
quick overview and or maybe of some of
 
04:54:43.670 --> 04:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
the um issues that we deal with at ba
 
04:54:45.948 --> 04:54:45.958 align:start position:0%
and then get into some
 
04:54:49.110 --> 04:54:49.120 align:start position:0%
numbers um I often refer to this is
 
04:54:51.628 --> 04:54:51.638 align:start position:0%
talking about ba without acronyms so we
 
04:54:53.628 --> 04:54:53.638 align:start position:0%
are full of acronyms in our department
 
04:54:55.868 --> 04:54:55.878 align:start position:0%
but um in order to get you know a little
 
04:54:58.310 --> 04:54:58.320 align:start position:0%
bit more English speaking out um I went
 
04:55:01.070 --> 04:55:01.080 align:start position:0%
through a couple of the key areas that
 
04:55:02.670 --> 04:55:02.680 align:start position:0%
the funding that we have requested will
 
04:55:06.110 --> 04:55:06.120 align:start position:0%
be funding over the coming by Anum uh we
 
04:55:08.548 --> 04:55:08.558 align:start position:0%
do obviously a lot of work with local
 
04:55:11.150 --> 04:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
businesses around the state uh both in
 
04:55:13.868 --> 04:55:13.878 align:start position:0%
terms of technical support uh expansion
 
04:55:15.628 --> 04:55:15.638 align:start position:0%
support I'm looking for opportunities
 
04:55:18.110 --> 04:55:18.120 align:start position:0%
for recruitment uh for new businesses to
 
04:55:19.750 --> 04:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
come into New Hampshire that really sort
 
04:55:21.670 --> 04:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
of forms the basis of our Economic
 
04:55:24.750 --> 04:55:24.760 align:start position:0%
Development activity um obviously we do
 
04:55:27.788 --> 04:55:27.798 align:start position:0%
a good deal of marketing and promotion
 
04:55:29.628 --> 04:55:29.638 align:start position:0%
that's the largest item within our
 
04:55:32.910 --> 04:55:32.920 align:start position:0%
budget each year um it represents a
 
04:55:35.590 --> 04:55:35.600 align:start position:0%
percentage of the meals and rentals tax
 
04:55:37.750 --> 04:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
revenue that we then turn around and put
 
04:55:41.470 --> 04:55:41.480 align:start position:0%
into a very specific and strategic
 
04:55:44.350 --> 04:55:44.360 align:start position:0%
marketing strategy over a 2-year period
 
04:55:46.708 --> 04:55:46.718 align:start position:0%
uh to drive tourism to the state and
 
04:55:48.510 --> 04:55:48.520 align:start position:0%
ideally increase the amount of Revenue
 
04:55:50.510 --> 04:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
that we see under meals and Rental
 
04:55:53.990 --> 04:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
tax um we're also working on a couple of
 
04:55:56.548 --> 04:55:56.558 align:start position:0%
items that are as I know we talking
 
04:55:58.190 --> 04:55:58.200 align:start position:0%
exclusively about arpa today but there
 
04:56:00.110 --> 04:56:00.120 align:start position:0%
are three programs that we have that are
 
04:56:02.910 --> 04:56:02.920 align:start position:0%
relevant to the mission that are um are
 
04:56:05.230 --> 04:56:05.240 align:start position:0%
being pursued under the arpa funding one
 
04:56:08.110 --> 04:56:08.120 align:start position:0%
is the New Hampshire business Gateway uh
 
04:56:10.390 --> 04:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
project which is an online digital
 
04:56:12.590 --> 04:56:12.600 align:start position:0%
platform that will really change the way
 
04:56:14.628 --> 04:56:14.638 align:start position:0%
businesses interface with the state
 
04:56:16.310 --> 04:56:16.320 align:start position:0%
giving them an opportunity to work with
 
04:56:19.948 --> 04:56:19.958 align:start position:0%
all our agencies at one in one location
 
04:56:22.150 --> 04:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
um we're actually rolling out an early
 
04:56:24.030 --> 04:56:24.040 align:start position:0%
version of that probably early next
 
04:56:27.070 --> 04:56:27.080 align:start position:0%
month uh we expect that project uh at
 
04:56:28.788 --> 04:56:28.798 align:start position:0%
least the component of the structure of
 
04:56:30.830 --> 04:56:30.840 align:start position:0%
the new platform to be done by July of
 
04:56:33.830 --> 04:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
next year um and I think and I and I
 
04:56:35.750 --> 04:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned that because that does g to
 
04:56:37.990 --> 04:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
that is going to have an impact on us
 
04:56:39.470 --> 04:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
and our interaction with business
 
04:56:41.788 --> 04:56:41.798 align:start position:0%
community but I think it also provides
 
04:56:43.750 --> 04:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
an opportunity for efficiency gains in
 
04:56:46.150 --> 04:56:46.160 align:start position:0%
other departments as we see uh the
 
04:56:48.670 --> 04:56:48.680 align:start position:0%
ability to kind of keep enforcement up
 
04:56:51.788 --> 04:56:51.798 align:start position:0%
the ability to uh make processing more
 
04:56:54.470 --> 04:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
efficient and and and using existing
 
04:56:56.548 --> 04:56:56.558 align:start position:0%
systems that they already have but to
 
04:57:00.150 --> 04:57:00.160 align:start position:0%
make the whole uh interface a much more
 
04:57:02.708 --> 04:57:02.718 align:start position:0%
uh pleasant experience for our business
 
04:57:04.948 --> 04:57:04.958 align:start position:0%
Community but also uh I do believe
 
04:57:06.948 --> 04:57:06.958 align:start position:0%
there'll be some benefit to the state
 
04:57:10.868 --> 04:57:10.878 align:start position:0%
over the long period um also the housing
 
04:57:12.150 --> 04:57:12.160 align:start position:0%
program that I know all of you are
 
04:57:14.830 --> 04:57:14.840 align:start position:0%
familiar with the invest NH program um
 
04:57:17.110 --> 04:57:17.120 align:start position:0%
we are more pretty much wrapping up the
 
04:57:20.350 --> 04:57:20.360 align:start position:0%
Federal funded component of that program
 
04:57:23.788 --> 04:57:23.798 align:start position:0%
um between this month and next month um
 
04:57:27.350 --> 04:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
and uh uh those were I think those are
 
04:57:29.708 --> 04:57:29.718 align:start position:0%
the main arpa programs we have
 
04:57:32.708 --> 04:57:32.718 align:start position:0%
operational um we do International Trade
 
04:57:34.868 --> 04:57:34.878 align:start position:0%
uh we have a whole team that's again
 
04:57:37.708 --> 04:57:37.718 align:start position:0%
federally funded through the SBA uh that
 
04:57:40.548 --> 04:57:40.558 align:start position:0%
works um literally on a daily basis
 
04:57:42.788 --> 04:57:42.798 align:start position:0%
trying to find new markets and we've
 
04:57:44.590 --> 04:57:44.600 align:start position:0%
seen those numbers and the trade numbers
 
04:57:47.150 --> 04:57:47.160 align:start position:0%
in state go up each year over the last
 
04:57:49.910 --> 04:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
six years I'm sorry the other big
 
04:57:51.990 --> 04:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
program we have is the Broadband
 
04:57:54.788 --> 04:57:54.798 align:start position:0%
expansion that's a that is partially an
 
04:57:56.948 --> 04:57:56.958 align:start position:0%
arpa funded program but it's also funded
 
04:57:59.430 --> 04:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
under the infrastructure legislation
 
04:58:01.350 --> 04:58:01.360 align:start position:0%
that the Congress passed a number of
 
04:58:04.470 --> 04:58:04.480 align:start position:0%
years ago um that's a significant number
 
04:58:07.430 --> 04:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
we've uh We've pretty much spent down
 
04:58:09.628 --> 04:58:09.638 align:start position:0%
the original arpa component of that
 
04:58:11.948 --> 04:58:11.958 align:start position:0%
which was about $122
 
04:58:15.390 --> 04:58:15.400 align:start position:0%
million um there is an additional pot of
 
04:58:17.070 --> 04:58:17.080 align:start position:0%
funding that will come through what's
 
04:58:18.350 --> 04:58:18.360 align:start position:0%
called The Bead
 
04:58:21.788 --> 04:58:21.798 align:start position:0%
program um over the next year or so that
 
04:58:23.948 --> 04:58:23.958 align:start position:0%
has a much longer time Horizon than arpa
 
04:58:26.910 --> 04:58:26.920 align:start position:0%
but also aimed at completing the uh
 
04:58:29.270 --> 04:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
fiber installations across the state
 
04:58:31.590 --> 04:58:31.600 align:start position:0%
bringing high-speed internet uh to many
 
04:58:33.190 --> 04:58:33.200 align:start position:0%
rural areas that are not currently
 
04:58:35.708 --> 04:58:35.718 align:start position:0%
getting those speeds or any speed at
 
04:58:39.510 --> 04:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
all um two other things worth noting um
 
04:58:41.868 --> 04:58:41.878 align:start position:0%
we have uh the former office of planning
 
04:58:43.548 --> 04:58:43.558 align:start position:0%
and development that had been at the
 
04:58:45.548 --> 04:58:45.558 align:start position:0%
office of strategic initiatives that was
 
04:58:47.310 --> 04:58:47.320 align:start position:0%
previously called the office of energy
 
04:58:49.150 --> 04:58:49.160 align:start position:0%
and planning and before that the office
 
04:58:51.590 --> 04:58:51.600 align:start position:0%
of strategic or no office of State
 
04:58:54.750 --> 04:58:54.760 align:start position:0%
planning um when we uh when a
 
04:58:56.350 --> 04:58:56.360 align:start position:0%
legislature set up a department of
 
04:58:58.230 --> 04:58:58.240 align:start position:0%
energy all of the energy related
 
04:59:00.708 --> 04:59:00.718 align:start position:0%
programming went to uh to them obviously
 
04:59:03.470 --> 04:59:03.480 align:start position:0%
but the office of State planning came to
 
04:59:06.590 --> 04:59:06.600 align:start position:0%
Bea um that has been a process of
 
04:59:08.708 --> 04:59:08.718 align:start position:0%
integrating that activity and their
 
04:59:10.270 --> 04:59:10.280 align:start position:0%
interaction with municipalities and
 
04:59:11.910 --> 04:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
communities very heavily into our work
 
04:59:14.830 --> 04:59:14.840 align:start position:0%
in Economic Development and promotion um
 
04:59:16.628 --> 04:59:16.638 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that you'll see in
 
04:59:19.270 --> 04:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
our request uh this year is more of a
 
04:59:21.628 --> 04:59:21.638 align:start position:0%
technical request to just establish a
 
04:59:25.230 --> 04:59:25.240 align:start position:0%
third division within ba where we put uh
 
04:59:27.628 --> 04:59:27.638 align:start position:0%
both that planning operation but uh
 
04:59:29.990 --> 04:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
added the the broadband and the housing
 
04:59:33.270 --> 04:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
component under the new division of
 
04:59:35.948 --> 04:59:35.958 align:start position:0%
planning and Community
 
04:59:39.548 --> 04:59:39.558 align:start position:0%
Development and lastly um we do have a
 
04:59:42.350 --> 04:59:42.360 align:start position:0%
team that that works under anou in
 
04:59:45.390 --> 04:59:45.400 align:start position:0%
managing uh 12 welcome centers and rest
 
04:59:47.708 --> 04:59:47.718 align:start position:0%
areas around the state uh for the
 
04:59:48.990 --> 04:59:49.000 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
04:59:51.670 --> 04:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
Transportation uh we have that team is
 
04:59:54.310 --> 04:59:54.320 align:start position:0%
responsible for Staffing those centers
 
04:59:57.430 --> 04:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
for maintaining those centers and for um
 
05:00:00.150 --> 05:00:00.160 align:start position:0%
you know making them as uh getting them
 
05:00:04.510 --> 05:00:04.520 align:start position:0%
to a point where we can um have a a very
 
05:00:10.110 --> 05:00:10.120 align:start position:0%
uh a much more um um open um process for
 
05:00:12.430 --> 05:00:12.440 align:start position:0%
those centers right now since Co it's
 
05:00:14.230 --> 05:00:14.240 align:start position:0%
been very difficult to retain staff in
 
05:00:16.190 --> 05:00:16.200 align:start position:0%
those centers and I think our team is
 
05:00:18.548 --> 05:00:18.558 align:start position:0%
doing a good job at trying to um keep
 
05:00:21.830 --> 05:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
them operational at least with staff uh
 
05:00:23.670 --> 05:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
over the last two years and you'll see
 
05:00:26.590 --> 05:00:26.600 align:start position:0%
that um among our prioritize needs were
 
05:00:29.350 --> 05:00:29.360 align:start position:0%
two uh positions I believe three
 
05:00:31.708 --> 05:00:31.718 align:start position:0%
positions within that Bureau of visitor
 
05:00:34.590 --> 05:00:34.600 align:start position:0%
Services um which we can certainly
 
05:00:38.470 --> 05:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
talk uh I mentioned the uh as far as
 
05:00:40.628 --> 05:00:40.638 align:start position:0%
highlights go I I won't necessarily walk
 
05:00:42.270 --> 05:00:42.280 align:start position:0%
through the entire handout that we have
 
05:00:47.110 --> 05:00:47.120 align:start position:0%
here um but the uh the dpcd new division
 
05:00:50.708 --> 05:00:50.718 align:start position:0%
um we are now also managing two state
 
05:00:53.788 --> 05:00:53.798 align:start position:0%
funded programs under the housing uh
 
05:00:56.948 --> 05:00:56.958 align:start position:0%
activity with dpcd uh moving to the
 
05:00:59.670 --> 05:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
housing Champions program and a state
 
05:01:02.708 --> 05:01:02.718 align:start position:0%
funded invest NH program those two right
 
05:01:05.708 --> 05:01:05.718 align:start position:0%
now currently uh total about $15
 
05:01:08.868 --> 05:01:08.878 align:start position:0%
million um we are just wrapping up the
 
05:01:10.990 --> 05:01:11.000 align:start position:0%
first application around under housing
 
05:01:15.230 --> 05:01:15.240 align:start position:0%
Champions this but tomorrow and um we'll
 
05:01:17.868 --> 05:01:17.878 align:start position:0%
be launching this other state funded
 
05:01:20.510 --> 05:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
invest NH program which is aimed at um
 
05:01:23.750 --> 05:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
Municipal uh Municipal uh grants and
 
05:01:27.310 --> 05:01:27.320 align:start position:0%
Loans um sometime in the next few weeks
 
05:01:31.310 --> 05:01:31.320 align:start position:0%
so we're going to see a slow shift from
 
05:01:34.910 --> 05:01:34.920 align:start position:0%
the federally funded arpa uh invest NH
 
05:01:39.150 --> 05:01:39.160 align:start position:0%
component to these State programs um and
 
05:01:41.190 --> 05:01:41.200 align:start position:0%
uh I think we've mentioned how we want
 
05:01:42.590 --> 05:01:42.600 align:start position:0%
to get there in the
 
05:01:45.990 --> 05:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
budget uh I'll reiterate uh on the
 
05:01:48.548 --> 05:01:48.558 align:start position:0%
tourism side you there's a lot of work
 
05:01:52.628 --> 05:01:52.638 align:start position:0%
that goes into uh into that activity um
 
05:01:55.430 --> 05:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
both within our own staff but also with
 
05:01:57.868 --> 05:01:57.878 align:start position:0%
our creative agencies our advertising
 
05:02:00.230 --> 05:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
agencies that we work with uh these are
 
05:02:04.110 --> 05:02:04.120 align:start position:0%
all done in very databased um strategic
 
05:02:06.510 --> 05:02:06.520 align:start position:0%
initiatives uh with our team to
 
05:02:07.990 --> 05:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
determine where the markets are that
 
05:02:10.510 --> 05:02:10.520 align:start position:0%
we're seeing the biggest growth uh where
 
05:02:14.230 --> 05:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
we want to try to grow those markets and
 
05:02:17.150 --> 05:02:17.160 align:start position:0%
um how that is translating on the ground
 
05:02:19.910 --> 05:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire with our industry
 
05:02:22.910 --> 05:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
but also uring the re Revenue income
 
05:02:25.990 --> 05:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
under meals and rentals I I I would add
 
05:02:27.948 --> 05:02:27.958 align:start position:0%
another International component there is
 
05:02:31.110 --> 05:02:31.120 align:start position:0%
that we have been seeing um or until
 
05:02:33.548 --> 05:02:33.558 align:start position:0%
this year and the and the U exchange
 
05:02:35.990 --> 05:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
rate an increase since covid in
 
05:02:37.910 --> 05:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
international tourism space and so we
 
05:02:40.390 --> 05:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
have had some focus on that over the
 
05:02:43.868 --> 05:02:43.878 align:start position:0%
last uh over the last 18 months and we
 
05:02:46.270 --> 05:02:46.280 align:start position:0%
do feel like that has had some benefit
 
05:02:48.430 --> 05:02:48.440 align:start position:0%
to the industry particularly in the fall
 
05:02:51.750 --> 05:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
season and um I can get into that but
 
05:02:54.510 --> 05:02:54.520 align:start position:0%
those are the main areas that I just
 
05:02:56.430 --> 05:02:56.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to talk about I expect there's
 
05:02:58.788 --> 05:02:58.798 align:start position:0%
some questions and Kathy frederickson's
 
05:03:01.310 --> 05:03:01.320 align:start position:0%
here with me from our business office to
 
05:03:02.788 --> 05:03:02.798 align:start position:0%
try to get through any questions you
 
05:03:05.310 --> 05:03:05.320 align:start position:0%
might have for us right thank you
 
05:03:07.510 --> 05:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh quick question on on the
 
05:03:09.830 --> 05:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
business community in in a tracking
 
05:03:11.628 --> 05:03:11.638 align:start position:0%
businesses to New Hampshire what are the
 
05:03:14.510 --> 05:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
major obstacles you find in in
 
05:03:15.830 --> 05:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
attracting new businesses to New
 
05:03:17.350 --> 05:03:17.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is is it is it taxes
 
05:03:19.390 --> 05:03:19.400 align:start position:0%
regulation Workforce
 
05:03:23.430 --> 05:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
housing um or um any any sort of
 
05:03:26.070 --> 05:03:26.080 align:start position:0%
combination of those it kind of depends
 
05:03:27.990 --> 05:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
on the business itself and what kind of
 
05:03:30.590 --> 05:03:30.600 align:start position:0%
business it's in but I mean generically
 
05:03:33.150 --> 05:03:33.160 align:start position:0%
speaking um I think businesses that are
 
05:03:35.868 --> 05:03:35.878 align:start position:0%
looking to come here are looking at uh
 
05:03:38.190 --> 05:03:38.200 align:start position:0%
the workforce that's available um and
 
05:03:40.548 --> 05:03:40.558 align:start position:0%
how that's going how how competitive
 
05:03:42.390 --> 05:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
they feel that they can be an attracting
 
05:03:44.670 --> 05:03:44.680 align:start position:0%
Workforce and directly tied to that is
 
05:03:46.990 --> 05:03:47.000 align:start position:0%
the housing piece so whether or not if
 
05:03:48.750 --> 05:03:48.760 align:start position:0%
they're bringing people a lot of times
 
05:03:50.470 --> 05:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
we might be recruiting a company to move
 
05:03:53.430 --> 05:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
from one place to another um if that's
 
05:03:54.948 --> 05:03:54.958 align:start position:0%
the case and they're bringing let's say
 
05:03:57.470 --> 05:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
a 100 employees they need to be able to
 
05:03:58.750 --> 05:03:58.760 align:start position:0%
know that there's going to be somewhere
 
05:04:00.350 --> 05:04:00.360 align:start position:0%
for those employees to live if they're
 
05:04:02.750 --> 05:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
bringing that many with them so uh I
 
05:04:04.470 --> 05:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
would say those are the two main issues
 
05:04:07.350 --> 05:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
that we really hear about the most um I
 
05:04:09.390 --> 05:04:09.400 align:start position:0%
think the dedication that we have put
 
05:04:10.910 --> 05:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
into into the housing issue over the
 
05:04:13.470 --> 05:04:13.480 align:start position:0%
last couple of years has really created
 
05:04:16.150 --> 05:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
much more attention and uh an
 
05:04:18.788 --> 05:04:18.798 align:start position:0%
affirmation if you will from the state
 
05:04:21.830 --> 05:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
on um how much they are willing to play
 
05:04:24.310 --> 05:04:24.320 align:start position:0%
in that in that space on behalf of the
 
05:04:24.320 --> 05:04:25.510 align:start position:0%
in that in that space on behalf of the
business

05:04:25.510 --> 05:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
business
 
05:04:27.390 --> 05:04:27.400 align:start position:0%
Community thank you and coming up with a
 
05:04:31.708 --> 05:04:31.718 align:start position:0%
metric to um ascertain how tourism going
 
05:04:33.750 --> 05:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
is going is is meals and rentals a
 
05:04:36.750 --> 05:04:36.760 align:start position:0%
pretty good metric for that yes but I
 
05:04:39.190 --> 05:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
would say that you know as much as I
 
05:04:39.200 --> 05:04:40.510 align:start position:0%
would say that you know as much as I
would

05:04:40.510 --> 05:04:40.520 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:04:43.310 --> 05:04:43.320 align:start position:0%
I do harp on it in this forum I don't
 
05:04:45.110 --> 05:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
think that we
 
05:04:48.350 --> 05:04:48.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily um would lead with the goal
 
05:04:51.350 --> 05:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
of our tourism promotion is to increase
 
05:04:54.590 --> 05:04:54.600 align:start position:0%
tax revenue it is definitely a benefit
 
05:04:56.190 --> 05:04:56.200 align:start position:0%
but really what we're trying to do is
 
05:04:58.350 --> 05:04:58.360 align:start position:0%
promote an industry and the jobs that
 
05:05:00.190 --> 05:05:00.200 align:start position:0%
come from that the tourism industry
 
05:05:02.230 --> 05:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
Remains the second largest employer in
 
05:05:05.590 --> 05:05:05.600 align:start position:0%
the state and it as you have seen over
 
05:05:08.150 --> 05:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
the last couple years since Co has been
 
05:05:12.030 --> 05:05:12.040 align:start position:0%
in a in a someone volatile State um
 
05:05:13.750 --> 05:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
we've felt that the marketing that we're
 
05:05:16.390 --> 05:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
able to do really supports that industry
 
05:05:18.430 --> 05:05:18.440 align:start position:0%
and gives them the opportunity to focus
 
05:05:20.670 --> 05:05:20.680 align:start position:0%
on uh what they need to be focused on
 
05:05:23.110 --> 05:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
which is creating a good experience for
 
05:05:25.110 --> 05:05:25.120 align:start position:0%
visitors that come to New Hampshire not
 
05:05:26.548 --> 05:05:26.558 align:start position:0%
just because we want them to come back
 
05:05:28.190 --> 05:05:28.200 align:start position:0%
but increasingly we want them to come
 
05:05:30.590 --> 05:05:30.600 align:start position:0%
back and to live here and to open a
 
05:05:33.230 --> 05:05:33.240 align:start position:0%
business or to take a job in one of our
 
05:05:34.910 --> 05:05:34.920 align:start position:0%
uh in one of our own businesses here in
 
05:05:37.030 --> 05:05:37.040 align:start position:0%
the state and we have seen some progress
 
05:05:40.030 --> 05:05:40.040 align:start position:0%
under those under those banners
 
05:05:41.430 --> 05:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
thank you my my two favorite categories
 
05:05:43.350 --> 05:05:43.360 align:start position:0%
in in the revenue report are are the
 
05:05:45.190 --> 05:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
other category in meals and rentals so
 
05:05:46.750 --> 05:05:46.760 align:start position:0%
you've been doing a fantastic job on
 
05:05:48.868 --> 05:05:48.878 align:start position:0%
both of those so on the on sorry the
 
05:05:51.510 --> 05:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
meals and rentals so thank you very much
 
05:05:52.708 --> 05:05:52.718 align:start position:0%
any other
 
05:05:56.030 --> 05:05:56.040 align:start position:0%
questions commissioner I have a couple
 
05:05:58.510 --> 05:05:58.520 align:start position:0%
um hi
 
05:06:03.350 --> 05:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
hi um Economic Development contracted
 
05:06:05.830 --> 05:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
expenditures go from about 7 million in
 
05:06:10.948 --> 05:06:10.958 align:start position:0%
24 to about 113 in 25 carried to
 
05:06:14.110 --> 05:06:14.120 align:start position:0%
26 um look at page 48 of the budget book
 
05:06:16.350 --> 05:06:16.360 align:start position:0%
if you want
 
05:06:21.390 --> 05:06:21.400 align:start position:0%
48 and I it's a big number that jumps
 
05:06:23.990 --> 05:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
out tell me again where you're looking
 
05:06:27.548 --> 05:06:27.558 align:start position:0%
Charlie H again which one are you
 
05:06:28.830 --> 05:06:28.840 align:start position:0%
contracted expenditures toward the
 
05:06:32.990 --> 05:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:36.548 --> 05:06:36.558 align:start position:0%
yes do we know what that is you know
 
05:06:38.070 --> 05:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
what that is off top of yet I mean it's
 
05:06:40.750 --> 05:06:40.760 align:start position:0%
not the travel and tourism contract
 
05:06:46.750 --> 05:06:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:51.868 --> 05:06:51.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:54.030 --> 05:06:54.040 align:start position:0%
thecr I'm gonna have to get back to you
 
05:06:56.110 --> 05:06:56.120 align:start position:0%
on that commissioner I unless is an
 
05:06:59.030 --> 05:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
increase in the office and Workforce
 
05:07:01.310 --> 05:07:01.320 align:start position:0%
Development in terms of what the income
 
05:07:04.430 --> 05:07:04.440 align:start position:0%
from federal yes in and additional
 
05:07:08.510 --> 05:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
programs in oo so I guess what we're
 
05:07:10.948 --> 05:07:10.958 align:start position:0%
seeing is that there was an increase in
 
05:07:13.350 --> 05:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
our funding from Department of Labor for
 
05:07:15.030 --> 05:07:15.040 align:start position:0%
the office of Workforce opportunity is
 
05:07:17.390 --> 05:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
that what you're saying that explains
 
05:07:22.430 --> 05:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
the increase oh oh wo okay oh wo oh whoo
 
05:07:25.030 --> 05:07:25.040 align:start position:0%
do you like saying that I
 
05:07:27.390 --> 05:07:27.400 align:start position:0%
don't okay so it's all federal pretty
 
05:07:29.510 --> 05:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
much okay thank you that's actually very
 
05:07:32.670 --> 05:07:32.680 align:start position:0%
helpful um the other question is when
 
05:07:34.390 --> 05:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
when the agency was
 
05:07:40.070 --> 05:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
created eight years ago just about um
 
05:07:41.910 --> 05:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
the the vision was sort of One-Stop
 
05:07:43.948 --> 05:07:43.958 align:start position:0%
shopping for businesses right that there
 
05:07:45.270 --> 05:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
aren't multiple places in the state
 
05:07:48.708 --> 05:07:48.718 align:start position:0%
government you have to go um I feel like
 
05:07:51.590 --> 05:07:51.600 align:start position:0%
we're probably not at one stop have you
 
05:07:54.990 --> 05:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
thought at all about places
 
05:07:57.510 --> 05:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
that ought to be folded
 
05:07:59.910 --> 05:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
in that aren't I mean I know there's a
 
05:08:02.470 --> 05:08:02.480 align:start position:0%
council partner agencies and there's
 
05:08:05.390 --> 05:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
that I would say that we the way that we
 
05:08:08.350 --> 05:08:08.360 align:start position:0%
handle that is um yes the Council of
 
05:08:10.310 --> 05:08:10.320 align:start position:0%
partner agencies is one tool that we
 
05:08:13.750 --> 05:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
have but for example today going on
 
05:08:16.590 --> 05:08:16.600 align:start position:0%
right now is a forum that we put on each
 
05:08:19.070 --> 05:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
year with all of the various Partners
 
05:08:21.350 --> 05:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
across the space of economic development
 
05:08:23.190 --> 05:08:23.200 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire so Regional development
 
05:08:26.590 --> 05:08:26.600 align:start position:0%
corporations planning commissions um uh
 
05:08:29.670 --> 05:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
individual municipal offices academic
 
05:08:31.628 --> 05:08:31.638 align:start position:0%
institutions there's a lot of
 
05:08:33.910 --> 05:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
organizations that engage in Economic
 
05:08:35.948 --> 05:08:35.958 align:start position:0%
Development I don't think that it
 
05:08:37.628 --> 05:08:37.638 align:start position:0%
necessarily would serve the state to try
 
05:08:39.750 --> 05:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
to pull all of that into one house as a
 
05:08:42.430 --> 05:08:42.440 align:start position:0%
formal entity but this department
 
05:08:44.548 --> 05:08:44.558 align:start position:0%
whether it's me or whoever else runs it
 
05:08:47.070 --> 05:08:47.080 align:start position:0%
going into the future it's extremely
 
05:08:49.350 --> 05:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
important that those relationships and
 
05:08:51.948 --> 05:08:51.958 align:start position:0%
those collaborations have to exist and
 
05:08:53.670 --> 05:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
in fact it's demanded I mean when the
 
05:08:55.390 --> 05:08:55.400 align:start position:0%
size of the budget here this is you look
 
05:08:56.750 --> 05:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
at Economic Development agencies in
 
05:08:58.110 --> 05:08:58.120 align:start position:0%
other states and they're just like these
 
05:09:00.350 --> 05:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
big bahouth that tell everybody you know
 
05:09:01.510 --> 05:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to do this we're going to do
 
05:09:02.990 --> 05:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
that this is our plan this is how we're
 
05:09:04.750 --> 05:09:04.760 align:start position:0%
going to accomplish this in New
 
05:09:06.788 --> 05:09:06.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we do it in a much different
 
05:09:08.628 --> 05:09:08.638 align:start position:0%
way where we have to work together to
 
05:09:10.190 --> 05:09:10.200 align:start position:0%
accomplish the same goals and we end up
 
05:09:12.628 --> 05:09:12.638 align:start position:0%
with very innovative solutions as a
 
05:09:14.750 --> 05:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
result so I wouldn't necessarily change
 
05:09:17.868 --> 05:09:17.878 align:start position:0%
that I would also say that uh the
 
05:09:20.030 --> 05:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
digital platform that I mentioned is the
 
05:09:22.510 --> 05:09:22.520 align:start position:0%
realization I think in a sort of virtual
 
05:09:25.150 --> 05:09:25.160 align:start position:0%
way of that one stop that we've always
 
05:09:28.628 --> 05:09:28.638 align:start position:0%
had in mind as we uh sort of establish
 
05:09:31.868 --> 05:09:31.878 align:start position:0%
baa and once that's in in place I think
 
05:09:33.590 --> 05:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
we'll really be able to demonstrate the
 
05:09:35.670 --> 05:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
benefit of that and as I mentioned the
 
05:09:38.990 --> 05:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
benefit is not exclusively to the to the
 
05:09:40.390 --> 05:09:40.400 align:start position:0%
uh business businesses themselves the
 
05:09:42.190 --> 05:09:42.200 align:start position:0%
benefit will be to the state and to the
 
05:09:44.070 --> 05:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
state agencies that participate on the
 
05:09:47.590 --> 05:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
platform what about um um I see it
 
05:09:49.270 --> 05:09:49.280 align:start position:0%
happens because of where I sit I see
 
05:09:50.628 --> 05:09:50.638 align:start position:0%
lots of people wandering into my
 
05:09:52.510 --> 05:09:52.520 align:start position:0%
building every day and they're all
 
05:09:54.590 --> 05:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
looking to register an LLC or register a
 
05:09:56.230 --> 05:09:56.240 align:start position:0%
corporation they go to the Secretary of
 
05:09:57.910 --> 05:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
State yeah
 
05:10:00.990 --> 05:10:01.000 align:start position:0%
and is there decent integration there
 
05:10:03.750 --> 05:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
and does your new platform help I know
 
05:10:05.190 --> 05:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
they do a lot of stuff online now they
 
05:10:06.510 --> 05:10:06.520 align:start position:0%
have they have a set of windows but they
 
05:10:08.628 --> 05:10:08.638 align:start position:0%
still do a lot of stuff online yeah is
 
05:10:10.788 --> 05:10:10.798 align:start position:0%
that are those things fully integrated
 
05:10:13.030 --> 05:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
or will they be that was a critical
 
05:10:15.030 --> 05:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
component of being able to move forward
 
05:10:16.830 --> 05:10:16.840 align:start position:0%
with the whole concept really I mean
 
05:10:18.548 --> 05:10:18.558 align:start position:0%
because until you can get the
 
05:10:21.310 --> 05:10:21.320 align:start position:0%
organization that is has the
 
05:10:24.070 --> 05:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility of uh establishing
 
05:10:27.430 --> 05:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
businesses formally in the state um a
 
05:10:29.430 --> 05:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
platform like this would be generally
 
05:10:32.628 --> 05:10:32.638 align:start position:0%
useless so uh and that has been I think
 
05:10:34.910 --> 05:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
part of the struggle in the past uh but
 
05:10:36.390 --> 05:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
we've worked very closely with secretary
 
05:10:37.830 --> 05:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
scanland and and they are full
 
05:10:39.990 --> 05:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
participants in this initiative
 
05:10:43.030 --> 05:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
oh good okay uh are there gopher I'm
 
05:10:44.110 --> 05:10:44.120 align:start position:0%
asking you because you're not because
 
05:10:46.350 --> 05:10:46.360 align:start position:0%
you're Bea but because you're the Gopher
 
05:10:46.360 --> 05:10:47.910 align:start position:0%
you're Bea but because you're the Gopher
guy

05:10:47.910 --> 05:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
guy
 
05:10:50.830 --> 05:10:50.840 align:start position:0%
um are there gopher plans in the budget
 
05:10:53.070 --> 05:10:53.080 align:start position:0%
I know we don't have a separate gopher
 
05:10:56.350 --> 05:10:56.360 align:start position:0%
presentation um I think that um we're
 
05:10:58.548 --> 05:10:58.558 align:start position:0%
going to need to address a couple of
 
05:11:00.868 --> 05:11:00.878 align:start position:0%
things as it relates to gopher in the
 
05:11:05.230 --> 05:11:05.240 align:start position:0%
budget um most of them are in terms of
 
05:11:09.070 --> 05:11:09.080 align:start position:0%
the uh the end game for that entity
 
05:11:12.350 --> 05:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
right so that is established by a
 
05:11:14.868 --> 05:11:14.878 align:start position:0%
executive order U that Governor suu
 
05:11:16.070 --> 05:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
established and then when we had the
 
05:11:20.270 --> 05:11:20.280 align:start position:0%
arpa funds that he amended um we are as
 
05:11:23.990 --> 05:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
many of you know shifting from an entity
 
05:11:26.788 --> 05:11:26.798 align:start position:0%
that really focuses on the front side of
 
05:11:28.470 --> 05:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
uh those programs and getting those
 
05:11:30.910 --> 05:11:30.920 align:start position:0%
dollars out the door and in the proper
 
05:11:33.270 --> 05:11:33.280 align:start position:0%
way and accounted for and you know all
 
05:11:35.350 --> 05:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing and it is going to
 
05:11:37.868 --> 05:11:37.878 align:start position:0%
shift more towards an entity that is
 
05:11:40.510 --> 05:11:40.520 align:start position:0%
responsible for working with agencies
 
05:11:43.030 --> 05:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
and awardees on completing those
 
05:11:44.948 --> 05:11:44.958 align:start position:0%
projects within the time frames that are
 
05:11:48.190 --> 05:11:48.200 align:start position:0%
required but also uh of working with us
 
05:11:49.948 --> 05:11:49.958 align:start position:0%
Treasury and the compliance and the
 
05:11:53.350 --> 05:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
auditing and the um accounting end of
 
05:11:56.230 --> 05:11:56.240 align:start position:0%
the the back end of the business so I
 
05:11:58.070 --> 05:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
think that that needs to probably be
 
05:12:00.548 --> 05:12:00.558 align:start position:0%
addressed in the budget as to how the
 
05:12:04.350 --> 05:12:04.360 align:start position:0%
state wants to um morph those functions
 
05:12:07.628 --> 05:12:07.638 align:start position:0%
probably into existing
 
05:12:11.430 --> 05:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
agencies and you me posted if it affects
 
05:12:17.430 --> 05:12:17.440 align:start position:0%

our commitment to New Hampshire's
 
05:14:03.070 --> 05:14:03.080 align:start position:0%
natural and cultural heritage but also
 
05:14:04.948 --> 05:14:04.958 align:start position:0%
our dedication to efficiency and
 
05:14:06.910 --> 05:14:06.920 align:start position:0%
collaboration across the
 
05:14:10.110 --> 05:14:10.120 align:start position:0%
state dncr is a unique agency with a
 
05:14:12.110 --> 05:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
broad mission one that serves the people
 
05:14:14.548 --> 05:14:14.558 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire in countless ways we're
 
05:14:16.030 --> 05:14:16.040 align:start position:0%
the agency responsible for New
 
05:14:17.868 --> 05:14:17.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's iconic state parks our
 
05:14:20.270 --> 05:14:20.280 align:start position:0%
forest and lands historical resources
 
05:14:24.430 --> 05:14:24.440 align:start position:0%
State library and even the Arts our goal
 
05:14:26.390 --> 05:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
across all these areas is to protect
 
05:14:28.548 --> 05:14:28.558 align:start position:0%
preserve and to promote what makes New
 
05:14:30.948 --> 05:14:30.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire special from keeping our state
 
05:14:32.670 --> 05:14:32.680 align:start position:0%
beautiful to supporting a high quality
 
05:14:34.470 --> 05:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
of life for our residents and attracting

visitors from all over the globe our
 
05:14:39.990 --> 05:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
work touches every corner of this state
 
05:14:42.270 --> 05:14:42.280 align:start position:0%
today I'm here to discuss a budget that
 
05:14:44.750 --> 05:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
includes a 4% decrease in our general
 
05:14:47.470 --> 05:14:47.480 align:start position:0%
fund allocation this reduction is
 
05:14:49.628 --> 05:14:49.638 align:start position:0%
significant but through careful planning
 
05:14:51.230 --> 05:14:51.240 align:start position:0%
and a commitment to getting the most out
 
05:14:53.310 --> 05:14:53.320 align:start position:0%
of every dollar we are confident that we
 
05:14:55.430 --> 05:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
can maintain the high standards expected
 
05:14:56.548 --> 05:14:56.558 align:start position:0%
of the
 
05:14:59.590 --> 05:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
dncr although we are a large agency only
 
05:15:01.788 --> 05:15:01.798 align:start position:0%
177% of our funding comes from the
 
05:15:04.270 --> 05:15:04.280 align:start position:0%
general fund which is approximately $1
 
05:15:07.070 --> 05:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
million each year for the next two
 
05:15:09.470 --> 05:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal years
 
05:15:12.470 --> 05:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
the challenge we face and one we Embrace
 
05:15:14.470 --> 05:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
is how to make every dollar of this
 
05:15:17.590 --> 05:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
funding work as hard as possible for New
 
05:15:20.270 --> 05:15:20.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the dncr is responsible for
 
05:15:21.750 --> 05:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
managing more than
 
05:15:25.510 --> 05:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
220,000 Acres of public land 870
 
05:15:27.470 --> 05:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
buildings and an array of critical
 
05:15:29.990 --> 05:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructure our team of nearly 1,000
 
05:15:32.070 --> 05:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
employees maintains everything from fire
 
05:15:34.830 --> 05:15:34.840 align:start position:0%
to towers and dams to septic systems and
 
05:15:36.230 --> 05:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
hundreds of miles of roads and
 
05:15:38.548 --> 05:15:38.558 align:start position:0%
snowmobile trails which are vital to New
 
05:15:40.830 --> 05:15:40.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's outdoor recreation
 
05:15:43.788 --> 05:15:43.798 align:start position:0%
economy this is a substantial portfolio
 
05:15:45.310 --> 05:15:45.320 align:start position:0%
and I am proud to say that our team
 
05:15:47.390 --> 05:15:47.400 align:start position:0%
meets these responsibilities with
 
05:15:51.390 --> 05:15:51.400 align:start position:0%
resourcefulness commitment and
 
05:15:54.350 --> 05:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
efficiency one area where dncr shines is
 
05:15:57.030 --> 05:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
our Revenue generation New Hampshire
 
05:15:58.868 --> 05:15:58.878 align:start position:0%
state parks for instance has become one
 
05:16:00.750 --> 05:16:00.760 align:start position:0%
of the most efficient Park systems in
 
05:16:03.230 --> 05:16:03.240 align:start position:0%
the country through Innovation and a
 
05:16:05.390 --> 05:16:05.400 align:start position:0%
commitment to self-sufficiency we fully
 
05:16:07.868 --> 05:16:07.878 align:start position:0%
fund park operations from the fees that
 
05:16:11.110 --> 05:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
we collect we also then reinvest this
 
05:16:12.868 --> 05:16:12.878 align:start position:0%
Revenue in other initiatives that
 
05:16:15.070 --> 05:16:15.080 align:start position:0%
benefit the state from Federal grant
 
05:16:16.868 --> 05:16:16.878 align:start position:0%
Administration like Land and Water
 
05:16:19.270 --> 05:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
Conservation fund and other admin and
 
05:16:21.230 --> 05:16:21.240 align:start position:0%
business functions to the preservation
 
05:16:23.910 --> 05:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
of unique Scenic scientific historical
 
05:16:26.190 --> 05:16:26.200 align:start position:0%
recreational recreational and natural
 
05:16:28.628 --> 05:16:28.638 align:start position:0%
areas throughout the state this model
 
05:16:31.070 --> 05:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
not only saves taxpayer dollars but also
 
05:16:32.948 --> 05:16:32.958 align:start position:0%
enables us to maintain and expand
 
05:16:35.910 --> 05:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
Services despite limited State
 
05:16:38.270 --> 05:16:38.280 align:start position:0%
funding our division of forest and lands
 
05:16:40.948 --> 05:16:40.958 align:start position:0%
is another example of resourcefulness
 
05:16:43.030 --> 05:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
Timber harvesting and Nursery sales
 
05:16:45.190 --> 05:16:45.200 align:start position:0%
generate vital Revenue that fund many of
 
05:16:48.990 --> 05:16:49.000 align:start position:0%
our staff public programs and services
 
05:16:51.270 --> 05:16:51.280 align:start position:0%
demand for seedlings remains robust
 
05:16:53.390 --> 05:16:53.400 align:start position:0%
despite recent weather challenges which
 
05:16:55.830 --> 05:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
is why we invested arpa money into a new
 
05:16:58.390 --> 05:16:58.400 align:start position:0%
irrigation system and a large cooler to
 
05:17:01.230 --> 05:17:01.240 align:start position:0%
ensure future Revenue
 
05:17:03.670 --> 05:17:03.680 align:start position:0%
stability efficiency is the theme of
 
05:17:06.070 --> 05:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
this budget to meet the demands of
 
05:17:07.830 --> 05:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
increased outdoor recreation and a
 
05:17:09.708 --> 05:17:09.718 align:start position:0%
growing interest in our state's natural
 
05:17:11.948 --> 05:17:11.958 align:start position:0%
resources we are constantly looking for
 
05:17:14.230 --> 05:17:14.240 align:start position:0%
ways to improve our operations and
 
05:17:16.868 --> 05:17:16.878 align:start position:0%
collaborate within our own Agency for
 
05:17:18.830 --> 05:17:18.840 align:start position:0%
instance we invested in a Statewide
 
05:17:21.110 --> 05:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
Trail mapping tool with arpa with arpa
 
05:17:23.510 --> 05:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
funds providing valuable public facing
 
05:17:25.990 --> 05:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
information and enabling better tracking
 
05:17:28.910 --> 05:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
of resources this tool supports informed
 
05:17:30.628 --> 05:17:30.638 align:start position:0%
decision- making in one of the state's
 
05:17:34.750 --> 05:17:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:36.948 --> 05:17:36.958 align:start position:0%
recreation collaboration with other
 
05:17:39.150 --> 05:17:39.160 align:start position:0%
agencies has also been key to our our
 
05:17:41.590 --> 05:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
approach our recent partnership with the
 
05:17:43.430 --> 05:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice to establish an
 
05:17:45.670 --> 05:17:45.680 align:start position:0%
in-house legal council role is one
 
05:17:48.590 --> 05:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
example this collaboration improves our
 
05:17:51.150 --> 05:17:51.160 align:start position:0%
efficiency and strengthens cross agency
 
05:17:53.310 --> 05:17:53.320 align:start position:0%
cooperation setting a foundation for
 
05:17:55.190 --> 05:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
exploring similar efficiencies with

exploring similar efficiencies with
other

05:17:56.110 --> 05:17:56.120 align:start position:0%
other
 
05:17:58.350 --> 05:17:58.360 align:start position:0%
departments we believe this approach can
 
05:17:59.708 --> 05:17:59.718 align:start position:0%
serve as a model for further
 
05:18:02.430 --> 05:18:02.440 align:start position:0%
consolidating Services across the state
 
05:18:04.830 --> 05:18:04.840 align:start position:0%
where do state agencies overlap with
 
05:18:07.110 --> 05:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
specific constituencies like snowmobile
 
05:18:10.750 --> 05:18:10.760 align:start position:0%
clubs Developers and even art
 
05:18:13.310 --> 05:18:13.320 align:start position:0%
organizations at the dncr we make the
 
05:18:15.350 --> 05:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
most of what we receive from the general
 
05:18:18.708 --> 05:18:18.718 align:start position:0%
fund by leveraging $4 million of the 11
 
05:18:20.788 --> 05:18:20.798 align:start position:0%
million we are seeking we will generate
 
05:18:22.830 --> 05:18:22.840 align:start position:0%
Federal match dollars necessary to
 
05:18:25.628 --> 05:18:25.638 align:start position:0%
maintain our budget's impact in the
 
05:18:27.788 --> 05:18:27.798 align:start position:0%
cultural resources divisions we
 
05:18:30.310 --> 05:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
strategically use the 4.2 million
 
05:18:32.390 --> 05:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
allocated from the general fund to
 
05:18:35.430 --> 05:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
maximize Federal uh maximize our federal
 
05:18:38.948 --> 05:18:38.958 align:start position:0%
matches with we have up to 80% or 3.3
 
05:18:42.150 --> 05:18:42.160 align:start position:0%
million going towards these matches this
 
05:18:43.548 --> 05:18:43.558 align:start position:0%
helps us provide more grant

state to further accommodate budget
 
05:19:36.750 --> 05:19:36.760 align:start position:0%

of historic sites back Under the

Recreation rather than being supported
 
05:19:46.310 --> 05:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
by the general fund this shift allows us
 
05:19:48.510 --> 05:19:48.520 align:start position:0%
to support Historic Site management

plans and for your support of dnc's
 
05:20:15.548 --> 05:20:15.558 align:start position:0%
mission I look forward to answering any
 
05:20:16.990 --> 05:20:17.000 align:start position:0%
questions you may have about our
 
05:20:20.030 --> 05:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
approach for maximizing efficiency and
 
05:20:22.628 --> 05:20:22.638 align:start position:0%
collaboration in the Service of New
 
05:20:24.548 --> 05:20:24.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you very much and I
 
05:20:27.830 --> 05:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
greatly appreciate you uh the the sales
 
05:20:29.628 --> 05:20:29.638 align:start position:0%
pitch for for your for your goods what
 
05:20:31.788 --> 05:20:31.798 align:start position:0%
was the name of that site again nhst
 
05:20:35.190 --> 05:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
parks.org okay we're appreciate the
 
05:20:37.230 --> 05:20:37.240 align:start position:0%
revenue and know I actually have ordered
 
05:20:38.628 --> 05:20:38.638 align:start position:0%
from that site so it's it's it's a
 
05:20:40.788 --> 05:20:40.798 align:start position:0%
wonderful Service uh quick question on
 
05:20:42.590 --> 05:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
on Canon Mountain uh the operation of
 
05:20:44.030 --> 05:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
Canon Mountain has run into some
 
05:20:45.750 --> 05:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
financial difficulties over the last few
 
05:20:48.190 --> 05:20:48.200 align:start position:0%
years one of the main reasons I think is
 
05:20:50.270 --> 05:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
because obviously with with the more
 
05:20:51.910 --> 05:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
mild Winters we've had over the last few
 
05:20:53.430 --> 05:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
years you've had to make snow that's
 
05:20:56.390 --> 05:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
extremely expensive as you know and with
 
05:20:58.190 --> 05:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
the forecast for this winter being
 
05:21:02.590 --> 05:21:02.600 align:start position:0%
another mild one uh how confident are
 
05:21:03.590 --> 05:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
you that you're going to be able to
 
05:21:05.350 --> 05:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
reverse those financial trends at Canon
 
05:21:07.510 --> 05:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
and get get back on the more positive
 
05:21:09.788 --> 05:21:09.798 align:start position:0%
track a speak I'll take the first crack
 
05:21:12.150 --> 05:21:12.160 align:start position:0%
at it and then I invite Chris Marino and
 
05:21:14.470 --> 05:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
uh Brian Wilson who's um the head of our
 
05:21:17.948 --> 05:21:17.958 align:start position:0%
Parks division uh so we just hired a new
 
05:21:20.548 --> 05:21:20.558 align:start position:0%
general manager Jace worth um just
 
05:21:22.788 --> 05:21:22.798 align:start position:0%
started he arrived here on the last day
 
05:21:26.190 --> 05:21:26.200 align:start position:0%
of the ski season um in April and has
 
05:21:27.948 --> 05:21:27.958 align:start position:0%
spent the summer managing francon and
 
05:21:31.230 --> 05:21:31.240 align:start position:0%
notate park he comes to us from Colorado
 
05:21:33.750 --> 05:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
um and has experienced running um
 
05:21:36.830 --> 05:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
similar size ski mountains um he has
 
05:21:39.070 --> 05:21:39.080 align:start position:0%
provided you know big because of the
 
05:21:40.750 --> 05:21:40.760 align:start position:0%
timing that he started before the start
 
05:21:42.868 --> 05:21:42.878 align:start position:0%
of ski season he has he has really
 
05:21:46.350 --> 05:21:46.360 align:start position:0%
provided a lot of analysis um and you
 
05:21:48.510 --> 05:21:48.520 align:start position:0%
know the old the old saying of well
 
05:21:50.670 --> 05:21:50.680 align:start position:0%
that's we've always done it this way you
 
05:21:53.470 --> 05:21:53.480 align:start position:0%
know that that doesn't work anymore um
 
05:21:55.548 --> 05:21:55.558 align:start position:0%
and so I'm excited for this injection of
 
05:21:57.788 --> 05:21:57.798 align:start position:0%
New Perspective and new energy you
 
05:21:59.948 --> 05:21:59.958 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh snowmaking yeah snowmaking
 
05:22:02.708 --> 05:22:02.718 align:start position:0%
is expensive um we were in a contract
 
05:22:06.030 --> 05:22:06.040 align:start position:0%
for energy that was really high um we've
 
05:22:07.788 --> 05:22:07.798 align:start position:0%
maneuvered out of that thanks to I think
 
05:22:11.510 --> 05:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
our partners at Das um and and so that's
 
05:22:14.590 --> 05:22:14.600 align:start position:0%
one way that we're um ensuring uh some
 
05:22:17.150 --> 05:22:17.160 align:start position:0%
savings uh but I'm going to let uh Chris
 
05:22:19.110 --> 05:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
and Brian piggy back off of
 
05:22:21.430 --> 05:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
that uh excuse me good afternoon I'm
 
05:22:22.628 --> 05:22:22.638 align:start position:0%
Brian Wilson the director of the
 
05:22:24.708 --> 05:22:24.718 align:start position:0%
division of Parks and Recreation and
 
05:22:27.628 --> 05:22:27.638 align:start position:0%
great great great question um all all
 
05:22:29.230 --> 05:22:29.240 align:start position:0%
the whole ski industry is in New
 
05:22:30.628 --> 05:22:30.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the Northeast is going to
 
05:22:33.150 --> 05:22:33.160 align:start position:0%
be uh you know continually challenged
 
05:22:35.510 --> 05:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
with uh with what Mother Nature gives us
 
05:22:37.910 --> 05:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
and doesn't give us uh a couple key
 
05:22:40.590 --> 05:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
areas that Canon specifically is focused
 
05:22:43.670 --> 05:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
in on is um continuing to Monitor and
 
05:22:46.510 --> 05:22:46.520 align:start position:0%
enhance our snow making systems and
 
05:22:48.830 --> 05:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
Technologies to make sure that that is
 
05:22:52.150 --> 05:22:52.160 align:start position:0%
uh a refined well-oiled machine that uh
 
05:22:56.910 --> 05:22:56.920 align:start position:0%
is is maintained and up toate um and um
 
05:22:58.590 --> 05:22:58.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of that infrastructure Improvement
 
05:23:01.590 --> 05:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
comes through uh the unique uh systems
 
05:23:03.628 --> 05:23:03.638 align:start position:0%
that the state's created with uh
 
05:23:06.110 --> 05:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
revenues and proceeds from Mount sunap
 
05:23:07.788 --> 05:23:07.798 align:start position:0%
uh the least and those funds help
 
05:23:10.430 --> 05:23:10.440 align:start position:0%
support the uh Capital infrastructure at
 
05:23:12.150 --> 05:23:12.160 align:start position:0%
Canon Mountain so we're being very
 
05:23:14.548 --> 05:23:14.558 align:start position:0%
strategic in the prioritization of our
 
05:23:16.670 --> 05:23:16.680 align:start position:0%
capital projects uh over the last few
 
05:23:20.030 --> 05:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
months we just got uh uh an approval for
 
05:23:21.708 --> 05:23:21.718 align:start position:0%
uh some advancement in our snowmaking
 
05:23:24.470 --> 05:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
system as well too for our main line uh
 
05:23:26.708 --> 05:23:26.718 align:start position:0%
to make sure that that works another big
 
05:23:30.590 --> 05:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
area is in um um using the best
 
05:23:33.750 --> 05:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
available data in science uh for this uh
 
05:23:36.230 --> 05:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
as as well too so for instance um we've
 
05:23:38.470 --> 05:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
installed uh with a partnership with the
 
05:23:40.990 --> 05:23:41.000 align:start position:0%
the Mount Washington weather Observatory
 
05:23:43.230 --> 05:23:43.240 align:start position:0%
additional weather systems uh across the
 
05:23:46.030 --> 05:23:46.040 align:start position:0%
mountain that are um that we are dialed
 
05:23:49.788 --> 05:23:49.798 align:start position:0%
in at different uh um different areas
 
05:23:52.230 --> 05:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
across uh francon Notch and across Canon
 
05:23:56.230 --> 05:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
Mountain uh to um really precisely
 
05:23:59.030 --> 05:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
measure uh what is called a wet bulb um
 
05:24:01.230 --> 05:24:01.240 align:start position:0%
which is the the right formula between
 
05:24:04.708 --> 05:24:04.718 align:start position:0%
the uh air temperature and um uh
 
05:24:06.548 --> 05:24:06.558 align:start position:0%
moisture in the air to for for the best
 
05:24:08.708 --> 05:24:08.718 align:start position:0%
snow making so we're we're looking at
 
05:24:10.868 --> 05:24:10.878 align:start position:0%
that to help better strategize our daily
 
05:24:12.948 --> 05:24:12.958 align:start position:0%
planning around where we're making snow
 
05:24:14.788 --> 05:24:14.798 align:start position:0%
so as the commissioner said some of the
 
05:24:16.470 --> 05:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
old ways of like well it's going to be
 
05:24:17.948 --> 05:24:17.958 align:start position:0%
colder at the top of the mountain than
 
05:24:19.470 --> 05:24:19.480 align:start position:0%
it is at the bottom of the mountain that
 
05:24:21.590 --> 05:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
is not always the case um and we're
 
05:24:24.150 --> 05:24:24.160 align:start position:0%
using this uh data uh for instance right
 
05:24:26.270 --> 05:24:26.280 align:start position:0%
now today it's actually cooler at the
 
05:24:27.470 --> 05:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
bottom of the mountain than it is at the
 
05:24:29.150 --> 05:24:29.160 align:start position:0%
top of the mountain we're blowing snow
 
05:24:32.390 --> 05:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh everywhere that we can um and also
 
05:24:34.910 --> 05:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
we're taking a look at how we go through
 
05:24:36.430 --> 05:24:36.440 align:start position:0%
you know the end of the season as well
 
05:24:38.788 --> 05:24:38.798 align:start position:0%
too and and uh the end of last season we
 
05:24:42.030 --> 05:24:42.040 align:start position:0%
made a a a decision to uh cut this what
 
05:24:44.310 --> 05:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
we had projected about a week or two
 
05:24:46.350 --> 05:24:46.360 align:start position:0%
shorter than uh the rest of the season
 
05:24:47.910 --> 05:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
because we we felt we were hitting that
 
05:24:50.590 --> 05:24:50.600 align:start position:0%
point of kind of diminishing returns uh
 
05:24:52.750 --> 05:24:52.760 align:start position:0%
as it relates to our visitation and our
 
05:24:55.510 --> 05:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
output of resources and then lastly the
 
05:24:59.030 --> 05:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
utility cost is really the big big deal
 
05:25:01.110 --> 05:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
um so that we were able to bring that
 
05:25:03.590 --> 05:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
cost back down to in line with our kind
 
05:25:06.390 --> 05:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
of 10-year trend of spending for utility
 
05:25:08.948 --> 05:25:08.958 align:start position:0%
consumption the last couple years
 
05:25:10.990 --> 05:25:11.000 align:start position:0%
the uh that contract was just
 
05:25:13.030 --> 05:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
astronomically higher than it had been
 
05:25:15.150 --> 05:25:15.160 align:start position:0%
which has really set us back but we feel
 
05:25:16.990 --> 05:25:17.000 align:start position:0%
now that we're back in line with that
 
05:25:18.708 --> 05:25:18.718 align:start position:0%
we're we're well on our way to hopefully
 
05:25:20.990 --> 05:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
having a a good successful season but
 
05:25:22.430 --> 05:25:22.440 align:start position:0%
those challenges are going to always
 
05:25:27.470 --> 05:25:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:32.830 --> 05:25:32.840 align:start position:0%
so I have a couple of questions hello hi
 
05:25:38.350 --> 05:25:38.360 align:start position:0%
um uh before we leave Canon um
 
05:25:40.350 --> 05:25:40.360 align:start position:0%
the the the parks fund pays for itself
 
05:25:42.350 --> 05:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
obviously not every Park pays for itself
 
05:25:45.310 --> 05:25:45.320 align:start position:0%
right the The Gardener Wayside has no
 
05:25:48.750 --> 05:25:48.760 align:start position:0%
Revenue no yes not not yet it's lovely
 
05:25:53.070 --> 05:25:53.080 align:start position:0%
though um but um where where are your
 
05:25:55.990 --> 05:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
what are your biggest net money
 
05:26:00.670 --> 05:26:00.680 align:start position:0%
makers uh The Flume uh is is uh and and
 
05:26:03.310 --> 05:26:03.320 align:start position:0%
our kind of other ancillary site sites
 
05:26:04.868 --> 05:26:04.878 align:start position:0%
at frankone not so frankone not state
 
05:26:06.070 --> 05:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
park is our biggest Money Maker if you
 
05:26:09.270 --> 05:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
combine the revenue from the ski operat
 
05:26:11.430 --> 05:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
and all of the other three other three
 
05:26:13.310 --> 05:26:13.320 align:start position:0%
season amenities whether it's the
 
05:26:16.910 --> 05:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
campgrounds and The Flume um and uh the
 
05:26:20.070 --> 05:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
Echo Lake Beach uh K Franconia Notch is
 
05:26:21.990 --> 05:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
is by far the flagship in terms of
 
05:26:23.670 --> 05:26:23.680 align:start position:0%
Revenue generation for the park and it's
 
05:26:25.310 --> 05:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
important to note that all of those
 
05:26:27.070 --> 05:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
things really tie together for four
 
05:26:29.628 --> 05:26:29.638 align:start position:0%
seasons of recreational opportunity um
 
05:26:30.910 --> 05:26:30.920 align:start position:0%
the winter Recreation and everything
 
05:26:33.270 --> 05:26:33.280 align:start position:0%
else second to that would be the C Coast
 
05:26:34.708 --> 05:26:34.718 align:start position:0%
uh and Hampton Beach and our in our
 
05:26:37.670 --> 05:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
parking meter program uh generates now
 
05:26:41.628 --> 05:26:41.638 align:start position:0%
over $3 million uh a year um some of our
 
05:26:43.708 --> 05:26:43.718 align:start position:0%
other bigger Parks like Puckaway White
 
05:26:45.868 --> 05:26:45.878 align:start position:0%
Lake um you know that have a combination
 
05:26:48.868 --> 05:26:48.878 align:start position:0%
of day use and camping um our weekend
 
05:26:53.270 --> 05:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
occupancy rate is uh um 86% uh um across
 
05:26:56.590 --> 05:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
the whole season mostly every weekend in
 
05:26:58.270 --> 05:26:58.280 align:start position:0%
uh over the from Memorial Day through
 
05:27:01.350 --> 05:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
Labor Day we were above 95% occupancy at
 
05:27:02.990 --> 05:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
our Campground so we're continuing to
 
05:27:06.030 --> 05:27:06.040 align:start position:0%
see uh increases in visitation um both
 
05:27:08.910 --> 05:27:08.920 align:start position:0%
in our dayuse and our in our campgrounds
 
05:27:13.190 --> 05:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
is is Canon itself a net Money
 
05:27:16.230 --> 05:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
Maker um generally the the ski account
 
05:27:18.510 --> 05:27:18.520 align:start position:0%
that we managed within the park fund um
 
05:27:20.150 --> 05:27:20.160 align:start position:0%
it it fluctuates so they they've had
 
05:27:22.548 --> 05:27:22.558 align:start position:0%
good years they've had some not not so
 
05:27:24.510 --> 05:27:24.520 align:start position:0%
good years and they've had some you know
 
05:27:26.230 --> 05:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
some some balanced years there's also
 
05:27:28.030 --> 05:27:28.040 align:start position:0%
been over history years where they were
 
05:27:30.548 --> 05:27:30.558 align:start position:0%
good where they helped support the parks
 
05:27:31.948 --> 05:27:31.958 align:start position:0%
that didn't have a good year and and
 
05:27:34.868 --> 05:27:34.878 align:start position:0%
vice versa so that's part of the um the
 
05:27:36.750 --> 05:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
magic of the park fund is a little bit
 
05:27:39.230 --> 05:27:39.240 align:start position:0%
is that we have the ability to move
 
05:27:41.470 --> 05:27:41.480 align:start position:0%
those resources around based on whatever
 
05:27:43.470 --> 05:27:43.480 align:start position:0%
you know whatever it may be going on and
 
05:27:46.430 --> 05:27:46.440 align:start position:0%
how much is sun and PE kicking in um
 
05:27:48.430 --> 05:27:48.440 align:start position:0%
that that has been growing as well too
 
05:27:50.030 --> 05:27:50.040 align:start position:0%
um I think now they're yeah it's over
 
05:27:52.910 --> 05:27:52.920 align:start position:0%
$700,000 a year that that they're um
 
05:27:55.190 --> 05:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
contributing to to not operationally
 
05:27:56.788 --> 05:27:56.798 align:start position:0%
funded so that that just is going
 
05:27:58.070 --> 05:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
towards capital
 
05:28:00.788 --> 05:28:00.798 align:start position:0%
investment um and the capital investment
 
05:28:02.990 --> 05:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
I mean I I organization like that needs
 
05:28:05.310 --> 05:28:05.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of capital I'm sure um it's not
 
05:28:07.350 --> 05:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
really creating efficiencies it's sort
 
05:28:08.990 --> 05:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
of probably keeping up mostly with
 
05:28:11.670 --> 05:28:11.680 align:start position:0%
deferred maintenance kind of issues uh
 
05:28:14.708 --> 05:28:14.718 align:start position:0%
that that Capital you're referring to uh
 
05:28:18.030 --> 05:28:18.040 align:start position:0%
yes yeah with with yeah at5 to $700,000
 
05:28:19.948 --> 05:28:19.958 align:start position:0%
a clip that's that's more the Deferred
 
05:28:21.590 --> 05:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
maintenance but nonetheless very very
 
05:28:24.470 --> 05:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
important and crit critical elements yes
 
05:28:25.910 --> 05:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
I wanted to ask about the Bureau of
 
05:28:28.310 --> 05:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
historic sites moving
 
05:28:31.510 --> 05:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
from I have a vague interest in historic
 
05:28:35.470 --> 05:28:35.480 align:start position:0%
sites um maybe more than vague um but I
 
05:28:37.628 --> 05:28:37.638 align:start position:0%
I I wonder if you could provide some
 
05:28:40.708 --> 05:28:40.718 align:start position:0%
degree of assurance that um you're not
 
05:28:42.110 --> 05:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
taking it from a place where it might
 
05:28:44.510 --> 05:28:44.520 align:start position:0%
receive a lot of focus and putting it
 
05:28:45.910 --> 05:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
into a place where it might not receive
 
05:28:47.430 --> 05:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
as much focus and there might be
 
05:28:47.440 --> 05:29:01.910 align:start position:0%
as much focus and there might be
Financial

05:29:01.910 --> 05:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:08.150 --> 05:29:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:10.788 --> 05:29:10.798 align:start position:0%
because if you know if a bathroom at
 
05:29:12.670 --> 05:29:12.680 align:start position:0%
Puckaway blows out we're going to make
 
05:29:14.910 --> 05:29:14.920 align:start position:0%
that a priority if it's all under one
 
05:29:19.190 --> 05:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
umbrella that said um during the covid
 
05:29:21.548 --> 05:29:21.558 align:start position:0%
times when we had to cut back on the
 
05:29:23.868 --> 05:29:23.878 align:start position:0%
budget we did what we're proposing and
 
05:29:27.470 --> 05:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
it worked it worked well um we have um
 
05:29:30.750 --> 05:29:30.760 align:start position:0%
we have only um expanded our investment
 
05:29:33.150 --> 05:29:33.160 align:start position:0%
into these historic sites thankful for
 
05:29:35.390 --> 05:29:35.400 align:start position:0%
the arpa allocations that we're able to
 
05:29:37.350 --> 05:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
to do that but that has really jump
 
05:29:39.990 --> 05:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
started a a lot of progress in that
 
05:29:44.150 --> 05:29:44.160 align:start position:0%
Bureau um and and I'm confident um and
 
05:29:46.190 --> 05:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
I'll let Brian speak as well I'm
 
05:29:49.590 --> 05:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
confident that this shift um should not
 
05:29:52.990 --> 05:29:53.000 align:start position:0%
be permanent um it should it should the
 
05:29:54.510 --> 05:29:54.520 align:start position:0%
intention should be to return it to the
 
05:29:56.868 --> 05:29:56.878 align:start position:0%
general fund as it was designed but for
 
05:29:59.470 --> 05:29:59.480 align:start position:0%
now so we don't skip a beat and we don't
 
05:30:01.990 --> 05:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
backtrack it's in a safe place under
 
05:30:05.548 --> 05:30:05.558 align:start position:0%
parks and how many historic sites do we
 
05:30:10.430 --> 05:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
have ballpark oh boy um I think there's
 
05:30:14.548 --> 05:30:14.558 align:start position:0%
U 15 16 sites yeah okay but sites are
 
05:30:16.110 --> 05:30:16.120 align:start position:0%
getting older every day Charlie so we
 
05:30:17.510 --> 05:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
could be adding more that's why they're
 
05:30:20.590 --> 05:30:20.600 align:start position:0%
historic yes I think just on that too I
 
05:30:22.030 --> 05:30:22.040 align:start position:0%
just want to point to uh you know the
 
05:30:23.708 --> 05:30:23.718 align:start position:0%
commissioner's remarks on efficiency as
 
05:30:26.750 --> 05:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
well too so um what we what we find in
 
05:30:29.070 --> 05:30:29.080 align:start position:0%
in in in the Bureau of historic sit
 
05:30:30.510 --> 05:30:30.520 align:start position:0%
specifically is we've been doing a lot
 
05:30:32.910 --> 05:30:32.920 align:start position:0%
of analysis of looking at our visitation
 
05:30:34.708 --> 05:30:34.718 align:start position:0%
and when folks are coming so for for
 
05:30:36.590 --> 05:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
instance we've been able to kind of
 
05:30:39.470 --> 05:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
control our costs and in some cases
 
05:30:42.270 --> 05:30:42.280 align:start position:0%
minimize Staffing in in areas by going
 
05:30:45.430 --> 05:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
from a 7-Day a week open for business to
 
05:30:48.590 --> 05:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
uh 3 to five days a week but um um
 
05:30:49.990 --> 05:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
impressing we've actually seen
 
05:30:52.708 --> 05:30:52.718 align:start position:0%
visitation numbers increase even though
 
05:30:54.948 --> 05:30:54.958 align:start position:0%
we've we' we' reduced our hours through
 
05:30:56.670 --> 05:30:56.680 align:start position:0%
through other components so we're still
 
05:30:58.750 --> 05:30:58.760 align:start position:0%
seeing great visitation we're seeing
 
05:31:00.868 --> 05:31:00.878 align:start position:0%
more visitation than we had before but
 
05:31:02.190 --> 05:31:02.200 align:start position:0%
we're also making sure that we have some
 
05:31:04.470 --> 05:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
controlled mechanisms to that and and
 
05:31:07.270 --> 05:31:07.280 align:start position:0%
and the funding for the historic Bureau
 
05:31:08.788 --> 05:31:08.798 align:start position:0%
isn't isn't really being touched it's
 
05:31:10.868 --> 05:31:10.878 align:start position:0%
just the revenue to offset it is got to
 
05:31:13.310 --> 05:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
is going to be coming from from the you
 
05:31:16.030 --> 05:31:16.040 align:start position:0%
know the Pua ways and and and The Flume
 
05:31:18.628 --> 05:31:18.638 align:start position:0%
uh places and things like that and last
 
05:31:20.430 --> 05:31:20.440 align:start position:0%
but not least could you have Chris hold
 
05:31:22.430 --> 05:31:22.440 align:start position:0%
up your ornaments and then describe what
 
05:31:24.430 --> 05:31:24.440 align:start position:0%
the ones you have are I want to give him
 
05:31:26.470 --> 05:31:26.480 align:start position:0%

something to
do

05:31:28.708 --> 05:31:28.718 align:start position:0%

of law enforcement um Colonel Kevin
 
05:33:18.110 --> 05:33:18.120 align:start position:0%
Jordan these people were instrumental in
 
05:33:19.910 --> 05:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
working with our former director in
 
05:33:22.788 --> 05:33:22.798 align:start position:0%
developing our budget so rather than go
 
05:33:24.990 --> 05:33:25.000 align:start position:0%
line by line through our budget I'd like
 
05:33:27.150 --> 05:33:27.160 align:start position:0%
to just do a general introduction and
 
05:33:28.948 --> 05:33:28.958 align:start position:0%
then uh if you have questions I'll turn
 
05:33:30.310 --> 05:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
it over to Kathy she'll have a few
 
05:33:32.150 --> 05:33:32.160 align:start position:0%
things to add but if you have questions
 
05:33:34.350 --> 05:33:34.360 align:start position:0%
we could certainly uh have them answer
 
05:33:36.350 --> 05:33:36.360 align:start position:0%
anything that you may uh want to have
 
05:33:38.350 --> 05:33:38.360 align:start position:0%
more information on
 
05:33:41.990 --> 05:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh again only nine days in but um our
 
05:33:45.150 --> 05:33:45.160 align:start position:0%
agency is mandated to be the Guardians
 
05:33:47.070 --> 05:33:47.080 align:start position:0%
of the state fish and wildlife and
 
05:33:49.990 --> 05:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
Marine Resources our mission is to
 
05:33:52.390 --> 05:33:52.400 align:start position:0%
conserve manage and protect these
 
05:33:55.628 --> 05:33:55.638 align:start position:0%
resources their habitats and inform and
 
05:33:57.390 --> 05:33:57.400 align:start position:0%
provide educational opportunities about
 
05:34:00.548 --> 05:34:00.558 align:start position:0%
these resources to the public lastly we
 
05:34:02.548 --> 05:34:02.558 align:start position:0%
are mandated to provide residents and
 
05:34:04.230 --> 05:34:04.240 align:start position:0%
visitors to New Hampshire with
 
05:34:06.070 --> 05:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
opportunities to use and appreciate the
 
05:34:07.430 --> 05:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
diverse resources we have in New
 
05:34:07.440 --> 05:34:08.948 align:start position:0%
diverse resources we have in New

Hampshire
 
05:34:10.350 --> 05:34:10.360 align:start position:0%
these natural
 
05:34:13.548 --> 05:34:13.558 align:start position:0%
resources enrich our lives support New
 
05:34:15.510 --> 05:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's economy and well-being of
 
05:34:15.520 --> 05:34:16.350 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's economy and well-being of
its

05:34:16.350 --> 05:34:16.360 align:start position:0%
its
 
05:34:19.070 --> 05:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
citizens as I'm sure you're aware we're
 
05:34:20.830 --> 05:34:20.840 align:start position:0%
facing new challenges and increasing
 
05:34:22.868 --> 05:34:22.878 align:start position:0%
pressure on our Fish Wildlife and Marine
 
05:34:25.270 --> 05:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
Resources uh Across the Nation but
 
05:34:26.628 --> 05:34:26.638 align:start position:0%
particularly here in New Hampshire we
 
05:34:28.110 --> 05:34:28.120 align:start position:0%
have disease issues we have climate
 
05:34:31.868 --> 05:34:31.878 align:start position:0%
change uh declining species populations
 
05:34:34.270 --> 05:34:34.280 align:start position:0%
habitat changes which include land air
 
05:34:36.628 --> 05:34:36.638 align:start position:0%
and water those are among the the
 
05:34:39.788 --> 05:34:39.798 align:start position:0%
factors that must monitored studied and
 
05:34:42.190 --> 05:34:42.200 align:start position:0%
managed to ensure sustainability of our
 
05:34:44.390 --> 05:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
Fish Wildlife and Marine Resources for
 
05:34:47.230 --> 05:34:47.240 align:start position:0%
their existence for all to enjoy and for
 
05:34:49.350 --> 05:34:49.360 align:start position:0%
the enrichment of New Hampshire's
 
05:34:52.590 --> 05:34:52.600 align:start position:0%
economy our core functions are primarily
 
05:34:55.230 --> 05:34:55.240 align:start position:0%
funded by hunting and fishing license
 
05:34:57.350 --> 05:34:57.360 align:start position:0%
though we serve a variety of
 
05:34:59.510 --> 05:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
constituents uh we have built a strong
 
05:35:01.548 --> 05:35:01.558 align:start position:0%
relationship well we built many strong
 
05:35:03.350 --> 05:35:03.360 align:start position:0%
relationships with partnering agencies
 
05:35:06.390 --> 05:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
and stakeholders uh this was Illustrated
 
05:35:08.548 --> 05:35:08.558 align:start position:0%
actually recently in the completed final
 
05:35:10.750 --> 05:35:10.760 align:start position:0%
report of the committee to study the
 
05:35:13.190 --> 05:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
fish and game Department's funding and
 
05:35:15.150 --> 05:35:15.160 align:start position:0%
partnership through those Partnerships
 
05:35:16.510 --> 05:35:16.520 align:start position:0%
we've been able to leverage some of the
 
05:35:19.390 --> 05:35:19.400 align:start position:0%
increasing demands but certainly not all
 
05:35:21.190 --> 05:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
uh on average
 
05:35:24.350 --> 05:35:24.360 align:start position:0%
70% um of the dedicated revenue for fish
 
05:35:26.310 --> 05:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
and wildlife agencies in Northeastern
 
05:35:28.628 --> 05:35:28.638 align:start position:0%
United States uh is generated through
 
05:35:31.150 --> 05:35:31.160 align:start position:0%
license sales and federal grants the
 
05:35:33.270 --> 05:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
remaining 30% is typically through
 
05:35:36.750 --> 05:35:36.760 align:start position:0%
general fund or uh special sources such
 
05:35:39.948 --> 05:35:39.958 align:start position:0%
as um permit fees or specialty stamps or
 
05:35:42.150 --> 05:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
lotteries depending on the the
 
05:35:44.868 --> 05:35:44.878 align:start position:0%
state my understanding is we operate on
 
05:35:48.270 --> 05:35:48.280 align:start position:0%
about a 3.5% of our budget is general
 
05:35:51.590 --> 05:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
fund uh fortunately for us in New
 
05:35:53.110 --> 05:35:53.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at least the public interest
 
05:35:54.670 --> 05:35:54.680 align:start position:0%
and desire for fish and wildlife and
 
05:35:57.708 --> 05:35:57.718 align:start position:0%
Marine Resources continues to grow
 
05:36:00.990 --> 05:36:01.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately though uh the need and the
 
05:36:02.868 --> 05:36:02.878 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and the cost of doing
 
05:36:04.868 --> 05:36:04.878 align:start position:0%
business and the diversity of services
 
05:36:08.030 --> 05:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
necessary to continue uh what we what we
 
05:36:10.470 --> 05:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
do it continues to
 
05:36:12.830 --> 05:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
increase as New Hampshire's population
 
05:36:14.948 --> 05:36:14.958 align:start position:0%
increases so does the pressure on our
 
05:36:17.750 --> 05:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
natural resources we have very skilled
 
05:36:20.310 --> 05:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
and dedicated staff uh engaged in our
 
05:36:23.230 --> 05:36:23.240 align:start position:0%
mission um they give everything they can
 
05:36:26.190 --> 05:36:26.200 align:start position:0%
to uh manage the resources that they're
 
05:36:28.628 --> 05:36:28.638 align:start position:0%
uh assigned to and to run this agency
 
05:36:30.628 --> 05:36:30.638 align:start position:0%
efficiently I've been very impressed
 
05:36:32.150 --> 05:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
just in the nine days that I've been
 
05:36:34.350 --> 05:36:34.360 align:start position:0%
here these staff continue to think
 
05:36:36.190 --> 05:36:36.200 align:start position:0%
outside of the box and be creative for
 
05:36:38.190 --> 05:36:38.200 align:start position:0%
ways to improve our efficiency
 
05:36:40.070 --> 05:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
to build collaborative
 
05:36:42.150 --> 05:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
relationships and to utilize other
 
05:36:44.750 --> 05:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
funding sources to support this
 
05:36:47.750 --> 05:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
Mission some of the information uh about
 
05:36:50.110 --> 05:36:50.120 align:start position:0%
our funding obviously was touched on in
 
05:36:51.750 --> 05:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
that final report of the committee to
 
05:36:53.030 --> 05:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
study the fish and game department
 
05:36:54.990 --> 05:36:55.000 align:start position:0%
funding Partnerships which was released
 
05:36:58.030 --> 05:36:58.040 align:start position:0%
on November 1st as a new
 
05:37:00.510 --> 05:37:00.520 align:start position:0%
director uh I am surprised about how
 
05:37:02.390 --> 05:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
much they can we can achieve or they
 
05:37:05.310 --> 05:37:05.320 align:start position:0%
have achieved prior to my arrival um I
 
05:37:06.990 --> 05:37:07.000 align:start position:0%
will continue to support our need to
 
05:37:09.390 --> 05:37:09.400 align:start position:0%
examine all alternatives to support our
 
05:37:13.628 --> 05:37:13.638 align:start position:0%
agency however I am realistic that we
 
05:37:16.270 --> 05:37:16.280 align:start position:0%
are already operating on a on a very
 
05:37:19.350 --> 05:37:19.360 align:start position:0%
skeleton budget uh we've met the 4%
 
05:37:21.390 --> 05:37:21.400 align:start position:0%
decrease but I'm not sure that we're
 
05:37:24.590 --> 05:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
likely to uh fill the entire Gap without
 
05:37:28.350 --> 05:37:28.360 align:start position:0%
legislative support um if there are
 
05:37:30.750 --> 05:37:30.760 align:start position:0%
Financial cuts to our funding uh we will
 
05:37:33.750 --> 05:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
need to likely cut services and as a new
 
05:37:36.310 --> 05:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
director for an agency that's mandated
 
05:37:38.548 --> 05:37:38.558 align:start position:0%
to serve the public and our natural
 
05:37:41.150 --> 05:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
resources um reducing Services is very
 
05:37:44.270 --> 05:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
concerning to me and uh will result in
 
05:37:46.150 --> 05:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
collateral and direct negative impacts
 
05:37:48.750 --> 05:37:48.760 align:start position:0%
on our natural resources our public and
 
05:37:51.390 --> 05:37:51.400 align:start position:0%
our economy I really don't want to see
 
05:37:53.390 --> 05:37:53.400 align:start position:0%
that happening so I'm hoping we'll have
 
05:37:55.708 --> 05:37:55.718 align:start position:0%
your support um I do want to take a
 
05:37:57.470 --> 05:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
moment and thank you for the support
 
05:37:59.230 --> 05:37:59.240 align:start position:0%
that has been provided to this agency up
 
05:38:01.910 --> 05:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
to this point honestly it's it's that
 
05:38:04.030 --> 05:38:04.040 align:start position:0%
work and that support that Drew me to
 
05:38:06.788 --> 05:38:06.798 align:start position:0%
come to New Hampshire um so I'd like to
 
05:38:08.868 --> 05:38:08.878 align:start position:0%
thank you for that and um look forward
 
05:38:11.110 --> 05:38:11.120 align:start position:0%
to working with you all as I transition
 
05:38:13.868 --> 05:38:13.878 align:start position:0%
into this role and we begin facing these
 
05:38:16.150 --> 05:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
challenges together at this point I'd
 
05:38:18.270 --> 05:38:18.280 align:start position:0%
like to maybe turn it over to our
 
05:38:21.708 --> 05:38:21.718 align:start position:0%
division chief of business um
 
05:38:25.430 --> 05:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
Kathy good afternoon Kathy leonti and
 
05:38:28.470 --> 05:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
this is my 11th banal budget for the New
 
05:38:30.750 --> 05:38:30.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fishing game
 
05:38:33.750 --> 05:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
department just a few bullet points we
 
05:38:37.430 --> 05:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
have 192 full-time employees at this
 
05:38:40.430 --> 05:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
this time we have five unfunded and they
 
05:38:44.070 --> 05:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
remain unfunded in the new banal budget
 
05:38:46.350 --> 05:38:46.360 align:start position:0%
we did meet the governor's targets for
 
05:38:48.990 --> 05:38:49.000 align:start position:0%
the use of fishing game funds however in
 
05:38:51.230 --> 05:38:51.240 align:start position:0%
order to do that and maintain all
 
05:38:54.190 --> 05:38:54.200 align:start position:0%
programs and services we used up the
 
05:38:56.430 --> 05:38:56.440 align:start position:0%
entire balance in the fishing game fund
 
05:38:58.948 --> 05:38:58.958 align:start position:0%
at the end of the bium leaving only
 
05:39:03.190 --> 05:39:03.200 align:start position:0%
approximately $100,000 in there we did
 
05:39:07.628 --> 05:39:07.638 align:start position:0%
hand out a onepage snapshot going back
 
05:39:11.990 --> 05:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
to 2011 of unrestricted revenue and
 
05:39:13.910 --> 05:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
unrestricted fishing game fund
 
05:39:17.350 --> 05:39:17.360 align:start position:0%
expenditures in the variance in that and
 
05:39:20.830 --> 05:39:20.840 align:start position:0%
for the last three years 25 through 27
 
05:39:22.430 --> 05:39:22.440 align:start position:0%
which is the current fiscal year we're
 
05:39:24.830 --> 05:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
in and the banial budget we're entering
 
05:39:28.750 --> 05:39:28.760 align:start position:0%
into you can see the very large gap
 
05:39:30.948 --> 05:39:30.958 align:start position:0%
between revenue coming in and
 
05:39:33.390 --> 05:39:33.400 align:start position:0%
expenditures going
 
05:39:37.548 --> 05:39:37.558 align:start position:0%
out and with that if the colonel has has
 
05:39:39.750 --> 05:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
anything to say or we can open that up
 
05:39:39.760 --> 05:39:42.548 align:start position:0%
anything to say or we can open that up
for

05:39:42.548 --> 05:39:42.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:45.230 --> 05:39:45.240 align:start position:0%
questions okay thank you very much uh as
 
05:39:46.468 --> 05:39:46.478 align:start position:0%
as you may have noticed we've had a few
 
05:39:48.750 --> 05:39:48.760 align:start position:0%
people join our our panel I'd like to
 
05:39:51.150 --> 05:39:51.160 align:start position:0%
welcome governor elect aot and Sheriff
 
05:39:54.628 --> 05:39:54.638 align:start position:0%

a row that that governor elect aots has
 
05:40:00.468 --> 05:40:00.478 align:start position:0%
uh attended these hearings I'm not sure
 
05:40:02.350 --> 05:40:02.360 align:start position:0%
if that's a record but uh it's it's
 
05:40:02.360 --> 05:40:03.628 align:start position:0%
if that's a record but uh it's it's

05:40:08.830 --> 05:40:08.840 align:start position:0%
actually on on on fees that you charge
 
05:40:10.190 --> 05:40:10.200 align:start position:0%
for for hunting and fishing and I've
 
05:40:12.270 --> 05:40:12.280 align:start position:0%
been involved with with on the ARA side
 
05:40:13.788 --> 05:40:13.798 align:start position:0%
in in in funding the
 
05:40:15.868 --> 05:40:15.878 align:start position:0%
hatcheries uh that are doing and I and I
 
05:40:18.350 --> 05:40:18.360 align:start position:0%
know that stocking fish everywhere
 
05:40:20.390 --> 05:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
especially in New Hampshire is extremely
 
05:40:23.030 --> 05:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
expensive are we charging
 
05:40:25.708 --> 05:40:25.718 align:start position:0%
enough uh as far as sort fishing you
 
05:40:27.590 --> 05:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
know the fishing licenses and hunting
 
05:40:30.070 --> 05:40:30.080 align:start position:0%
fees to or hunting licenses to to
 
05:40:32.310 --> 05:40:32.320 align:start position:0%
compensate for that and number two I'm
 
05:40:34.548 --> 05:40:34.558 align:start position:0%
not sure if you if you know but how do
 
05:40:36.270 --> 05:40:36.280 align:start position:0%
our fees compare to our neighboring
 
05:40:36.280 --> 05:40:41.430 align:start position:0%
our fees compare to our neighboring
states

05:40:41.430 --> 05:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:45.030 --> 05:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
so I will answer briefly um in the
 
05:40:47.030 --> 05:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
discussions I've had with our chief of
 
05:40:49.150 --> 05:40:49.160 align:start position:0%
Inland Fisheries uh we probably are not
 
05:40:52.830 --> 05:40:52.840 align:start position:0%
charging enough however we are looking
 
05:40:55.590 --> 05:40:55.600 align:start position:0%
for other ways to fund that um
 
05:40:58.628 --> 05:40:58.638 align:start position:0%
comparative to other states I'm not
 
05:41:00.510 --> 05:41:00.520 align:start position:0%
quite familiar with all the New England
 
05:41:03.070 --> 05:41:03.080 align:start position:0%
states however I do know across the
 
05:41:05.150 --> 05:41:05.160 align:start position:0%
country we are lower on some of our
 
05:41:07.910 --> 05:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
hunting and fishing fees um than most
 
05:41:10.788 --> 05:41:10.798 align:start position:0%
States however again the hunting and
 
05:41:12.750 --> 05:41:12.760 align:start position:0%
fishing tradition here is a little
 
05:41:14.750 --> 05:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
different than it's than it is in other
 
05:41:17.990 --> 05:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
states and um we do draw quite a few
 
05:41:20.628 --> 05:41:20.638 align:start position:0%
folks in from outside the neighboring
 
05:41:22.948 --> 05:41:22.958 align:start position:0%
states come in so I think that helps
 
05:41:26.270 --> 05:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
offset some of our issues as well and I
 
05:41:27.788 --> 05:41:27.798 align:start position:0%
don't know if Kathy or the colonel would
 
05:41:30.390 --> 05:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
like to add to that I can add a little
 
05:41:32.270 --> 05:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
bit to that we have been doing some
 
05:41:34.150 --> 05:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
analysis with our surrounding New
 
05:41:36.910 --> 05:41:36.920 align:start position:0%
England states and we are at number one
 
05:41:39.750 --> 05:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
or or two with the price that we charge
 
05:41:42.310 --> 05:41:42.320 align:start position:0%
for our licenses compared to new other
 
05:41:44.390 --> 05:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
surrounding New England
 
05:41:47.310 --> 05:41:47.320 align:start position:0%
states okay meaning one being that's
 
05:41:52.190 --> 05:41:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:56.468 --> 05:41:56.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:00.430 --> 05:42:00.440 align:start position:0%
you hi welcome um I'm going to ask you
 
05:42:02.868 --> 05:42:02.878 align:start position:0%
about something on page 83 of your I'm
 
05:42:06.030 --> 05:42:06.040 align:start position:0%
kidding um can you explain the bare
 
05:42:11.230 --> 05:42:11.240 align:start position:0%
damage relief progr to me and uh no I
 
05:42:17.190 --> 05:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:21.510 --> 05:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
hm in a nice way right okay thank you I
 
05:42:22.628 --> 05:42:22.638 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure I'll be mean to
 
05:42:25.468 --> 05:42:25.478 align:start position:0%
you in Market Basket next time I see you
 
05:42:29.750 --> 05:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
um the uh I mean a couple things Kathy
 
05:42:31.430 --> 05:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
in particular the sheet you pass out has
 
05:42:34.350 --> 05:42:34.360 align:start position:0%
a has a projected Revenue drop and I I
 
05:42:35.788 --> 05:42:35.798 align:start position:0%
presume that's mostly cuz that's what
 
05:42:39.430 --> 05:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
it's budgeted at in in 25 not because
 
05:42:43.948 --> 05:42:43.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:47.948 --> 05:42:47.958 align:start position:0%
down my apologies this is strictly
 
05:42:50.948 --> 05:42:50.958 align:start position:0%
budget figures from 25 to
 
05:42:53.910 --> 05:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
27 do you think there's a chance will
 
05:42:56.750 --> 05:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
will be similar in 25 to 24 I'm not
 
05:43:00.910 --> 05:43:00.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:04.468 --> 05:43:04.478 align:start position:0%
but as far as expenditures I mean no in
 
05:43:04.478 --> 05:43:06.110 align:start position:0%
but as far as expenditures I mean no in
uh

05:43:06.110 --> 05:43:06.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:43:08.788 --> 05:43:08.798 align:start position:0%
revenues revenues are looking very
 
05:43:12.468 --> 05:43:12.478 align:start position:0%
similar in 25 as they were to 24 a
 
05:43:15.190 --> 05:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
slight decline but nothing I am overly
 
05:43:16.670 --> 05:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
concerned about at this do we have
 
05:43:19.070 --> 05:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
long-term trends on on fishing or
 
05:43:23.910 --> 05:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
hunting that are uh I mean I I feel like
 
05:43:25.270 --> 05:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
there aren't quite as many people who
 
05:43:28.390 --> 05:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
hunt as there used to be um that is a
 
05:43:30.868 --> 05:43:30.878 align:start position:0%
very true statement if you look at the
 
05:43:34.628 --> 05:43:34.638 align:start position:0%
revenues in fiscal year 20 and 21 that
 
05:43:38.868 --> 05:43:38.878 align:start position:0%
was absolutely 100% due to covid more
 
05:43:41.990 --> 05:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
people went out and enjoyed the outdoors
 
05:43:46.548 --> 05:43:46.558 align:start position:0%
our revenues from fishing sales peaked
 
05:43:48.310 --> 05:43:48.320 align:start position:0%
very very high and now they're on the
 
05:43:53.270 --> 05:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
downward Trend again but they have not
 
05:43:57.070 --> 05:43:57.080 align:start position:0%
in any way bottomed out do you have a um
 
05:43:59.110 --> 05:43:59.120 align:start position:0%
and and you mentioned that that uh the
 
05:44:01.070 --> 05:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
budget is constructed basically spending
 
05:44:04.670 --> 05:44:04.680 align:start position:0%
the entire Surplus um do you have a and
 
05:44:06.310 --> 05:44:06.320 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have to be today but can you
 
05:44:08.628 --> 05:44:08.638 align:start position:0%
at some point Prov for for the
 
05:44:10.708 --> 05:44:10.718 align:start position:0%
Governor's budget team a a sort of draft
 
05:44:12.150 --> 05:44:12.160 align:start position:0%
Surplus statement of kind of where you
 
05:44:14.430 --> 05:44:14.440 align:start position:0%
think things are I have one right here
 
05:44:16.510 --> 05:44:16.520 align:start position:0%
today I did not make copies of it but I
 
05:44:19.390 --> 05:44:19.400 align:start position:0%
do have a surplus statement yes perfect
 
05:44:25.510 --> 05:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:27.750 --> 05:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
yep thank you very much see any other
 
05:44:29.110 --> 05:44:29.120 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testim if I
 
05:44:30.788 --> 05:44:30.798 align:start position:0%
may one more thing I just wanted to add
 
05:44:34.150 --> 05:44:34.160 align:start position:0%
back to the fees issue um again as I
 
05:44:35.910 --> 05:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier in the introduction a
 
05:44:38.468 --> 05:44:38.478 align:start position:0%
lot of the North eastern states are
 
05:44:41.190 --> 05:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
funded through general fund lotteries
 
05:44:43.670 --> 05:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
and permit fees which we don't really
 
05:44:46.230 --> 05:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
partake a significant amount of any of
 
05:44:48.468 --> 05:44:48.478 align:start position:0%
those here in New Hampshire and that
 
05:44:50.590 --> 05:44:50.600 align:start position:0%
makes a difference in the price of their
 
05:44:53.270 --> 05:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
licenses as well so just keep that in
 
05:44:55.708 --> 05:44:55.718 align:start position:0%
mind as far as an additional factor that
 
05:44:57.430 --> 05:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
affects that thank you very much thank
 
05:45:01.070 --> 05:45:01.080 align:start position:0%
you very much have a good day thank you
 
05:45:01.080 --> 05:45:03.230 align:start position:0%
you very much have a good day thank you
thank

05:45:03.230 --> 05:45:03.240 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:45:05.230 --> 05:45:05.240 align:start position:0%
you I'd like to invite up now the
 
05:45:39.750 --> 05:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:42.830 --> 05:45:42.840 align:start position:0%
afternoon you ready for us we are ready
 
05:45:44.948 --> 05:45:44.958 align:start position:0%
all right good afternoon uh welcome
 
05:45:47.788 --> 05:45:47.798 align:start position:0%
governor elect um for the record I'm Bob
 
05:45:48.590 --> 05:45:48.600 align:start position:0%
Scott with the Department of
 
05:45:50.230 --> 05:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services I have with me
 
05:45:52.430 --> 05:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
our chief operating officer Susan car
 
05:45:54.628 --> 05:45:54.638 align:start position:0%
Carlson uh what I'd like to do today as
 
05:45:56.310 --> 05:45:56.320 align:start position:0%
you see in your handout is kind of walk
 
05:45:58.670 --> 05:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
you through uh some of the highlights of
 
05:46:00.990 --> 05:46:01.000 align:start position:0%
the department very briefly some of the
 
05:46:04.548 --> 05:46:04.558 align:start position:0%
stressors on the work we do uh and of
 
05:46:07.230 --> 05:46:07.240 align:start position:0%
course kind of parse and slice and dice
 
05:46:09.750 --> 05:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh the budget to to help uh people
 
05:46:13.350 --> 05:46:13.360 align:start position:0%
digest what we have have before them uh
 
05:46:15.590 --> 05:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
the the dicing and of the the data I'm G
 
05:46:17.510 --> 05:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
to hand off to sue Carlson and then at
 
05:46:19.430 --> 05:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
the end I'll I'll pick up again and talk
 
05:46:22.510 --> 05:46:22.520 align:start position:0%
about uh kind of wrap up in some of our
 
05:46:25.150 --> 05:46:25.160 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs uh so you all
 
05:46:28.190 --> 05:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
understand that also so if if I could
 
05:46:30.310 --> 05:46:30.320 align:start position:0%
we'll go to slide slide number two which
 
05:46:33.430 --> 05:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
is just our organizational chart um we
 
05:46:35.670 --> 05:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
have as you see for full-time permanent
 
05:46:37.628 --> 05:46:37.638 align:start position:0%
staff uh
 
05:46:41.230 --> 05:46:41.240 align:start position:0%
493 uh positions divided under four
 
05:46:46.150 --> 05:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
divisions uh we we uh have a wide range
 
05:46:47.948 --> 05:46:47.958 align:start position:0%
of functions which I'll go into some of
 
05:46:50.670 --> 05:46:50.680 align:start position:0%
our core functions in later slides uh
 
05:46:53.628 --> 05:46:53.638 align:start position:0%
but we have uh our Waste Management
 
05:46:55.830 --> 05:46:55.840 align:start position:0%
division as as uh the name kind of
 
05:46:58.468 --> 05:46:58.478 align:start position:0%
implies uh we deal with uh hazardous
 
05:47:00.628 --> 05:47:00.638 align:start position:0%
waste uh Solid Waste contamination
 
05:47:03.670 --> 05:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
issues brownfields Redevelopment uh
 
05:47:05.548 --> 05:47:05.558 align:start position:0%
super fund management of super fund
 
05:47:07.868 --> 05:47:07.878 align:start position:0%
sites our water division which is our
 
05:47:11.270 --> 05:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
largest division uh we deal with uh
 
05:47:14.548 --> 05:47:14.558 align:start position:0%
things ranging from dams to Wetlands
 
05:47:18.990 --> 05:47:19.000 align:start position:0%
permitting to uh Wastewater uh projects
 
05:47:22.270 --> 05:47:22.280 align:start position:0%
drinking water uh and uh we also have
 
05:47:23.948 --> 05:47:23.958 align:start position:0%
we're unique in the country if I
 
05:47:25.788 --> 05:47:25.798 align:start position:0%
understand it correctly uh we have the
 
05:47:28.548 --> 05:47:28.558 align:start position:0%
wabaki River Basin project so it's a 10
 
05:47:31.910 --> 05:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
10 Community uh fed Wastewater Treatment
 
05:47:34.590 --> 05:47:34.600 align:start position:0%
Facility in Franklin New Hampshire uh so
 
05:47:37.270 --> 05:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
we're in a kind of a c certainly unique
 
05:47:38.830 --> 05:47:38.840 align:start position:0%
but an awkward position where we
 
05:47:40.510 --> 05:47:40.520 align:start position:0%
regulate wastewater treatment plants but
 
05:47:42.270 --> 05:47:42.280 align:start position:0%
we also operate a wastewater treatment
 
05:47:45.590 --> 05:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
plant so um so we we're I guess that's
 
05:47:47.230 --> 05:47:47.240 align:start position:0%
in a hempshire way we're doing some
 
05:47:49.390 --> 05:47:49.400 align:start position:0%
something a little bit different uh our
 
05:47:51.510 --> 05:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
air our air division air Resources
 
05:47:54.910 --> 05:47:54.920 align:start position:0%

Stack Industries uh air toxics uh
 
05:48:00.310 --> 05:48:00.320 align:start position:0%
something that may not be obvious
 
05:48:02.670 --> 05:48:02.680 align:start position:0%
embedded in that division is our our
 
05:48:05.310 --> 05:48:05.320 align:start position:0%
environmental health group and they help
 
05:48:07.910 --> 05:48:07.920 align:start position:0%

05:48:15.510 --> 05:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
dogs within the in the agency we have
 
05:48:18.670 --> 05:48:18.680 align:start position:0%
the state uh Geological Survey and our
 
05:48:21.910 --> 05:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
state geologist is hous at Dees uh we
 
05:48:25.110 --> 05:48:25.120 align:start position:0%
have uh a Pools and Spa program uh that
 
05:48:28.230 --> 05:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
we run also we have uh a shelf shellfish
 
05:48:29.910 --> 05:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
program on the Sea Coast where we help
 
05:48:31.708 --> 05:48:31.718 align:start position:0%
that budding industry too we work very
 
05:48:34.110 --> 05:48:34.120 align:start position:0%
closely with fish and game so that
 
05:48:36.150 --> 05:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
that's kind of a a broad overview of
 
05:48:38.750 --> 05:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
what we do with agency uh I'll skip
 
05:48:40.590 --> 05:48:40.600 align:start position:0%
quickly through the number three our
 
05:48:42.750 --> 05:48:42.760 align:start position:0%
mission statement but basically our job
 
05:48:44.150 --> 05:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
is to protect and restore the
 
05:48:45.830 --> 05:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
environment and public health and we
 
05:48:48.030 --> 05:48:48.040 align:start position:0%
take that seriously some of the core
 
05:48:49.670 --> 05:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
functions on slide
 
05:48:54.110 --> 05:48:54.120 align:start position:0%
four uh are in in what takes a a lot of
 
05:48:57.430 --> 05:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
our day is uh water supply but also
 
05:49:00.628 --> 05:49:00.638 align:start position:0%
water contamination issues uh you'll
 
05:49:02.350 --> 05:49:02.360 align:start position:0%
you'll hear the four-letter word past
 
05:49:03.830 --> 05:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
that's Tak up a lot of our time but
 
05:49:06.788 --> 05:49:06.798 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of other uh uh
 
05:49:08.070 --> 05:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
contaminants in the in the in the
 
05:49:09.990 --> 05:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
drinking water that we we pay a lot of
 
05:49:13.150 --> 05:49:13.160 align:start position:0%
attention to of late in the past the
 
05:49:17.150 --> 05:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
past bium between uh issues with water
 
05:49:20.110 --> 05:49:20.120 align:start position:0%
contamination but also uh Federal monies
 
05:49:22.190 --> 05:49:22.200 align:start position:0%
whether it's through arpa uh the
 
05:49:26.350 --> 05:49:26.360 align:start position:0%
infrastructure Bill uh the there's a lot
 
05:49:29.150 --> 05:49:29.160 align:start position:0%
of lot of surge money if you will that
 
05:49:31.548 --> 05:49:31.558 align:start position:0%
has come through the agency to go back
 
05:49:32.468 --> 05:49:32.478 align:start position:0%
to the
 
05:49:35.510 --> 05:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
communities uh to to address uh both
 
05:49:38.430 --> 05:49:38.440 align:start position:0%
drinking water and and Wastewater issues
 
05:49:40.830 --> 05:49:40.840 align:start position:0%
so that's been really the the largest
 
05:49:42.468 --> 05:49:42.478 align:start position:0%
between that and contamination which are
 
05:49:45.150 --> 05:49:45.160 align:start position:0%
tied together uh that's been our largest
 
05:49:47.628 --> 05:49:47.638 align:start position:0%
focused uh certainly since I've been
 
05:49:49.948 --> 05:49:49.958 align:start position:0%
commissioner for uh starting in
 
05:49:55.230 --> 05:49:55.240 align:start position:0%
2017 um so I'll I'll keep going to slide
 
05:49:57.270 --> 05:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
five uh we
 
05:49:59.468 --> 05:49:59.478 align:start position:0%
have as I mentioned some of the things
 
05:50:02.788 --> 05:50:02.798 align:start position:0%
that keep us up and keep us busy uh are
 
05:50:05.628 --> 05:50:05.638 align:start position:0%
that infrastructure part so so uh we
 
05:50:06.948 --> 05:50:06.958 align:start position:0%
have the drinking water ground want a
 
05:50:09.868 --> 05:50:09.878 align:start position:0%
trust fund uh which resides in the agent
 
05:50:12.510 --> 05:50:12.520 align:start position:0%
is administered by the agency uh we have
 
05:50:14.350 --> 05:50:14.360 align:start position:0%
the tip the more standard State
 
05:50:17.430 --> 05:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
revolving loan funds for uh programs for
 
05:50:19.190 --> 05:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
drinking water Wastewater again those
 
05:50:21.628 --> 05:50:21.638 align:start position:0%
have been augmented with the
 
05:50:24.468 --> 05:50:24.478 align:start position:0%
infrastructure funds uh we have arpa
 
05:50:27.190 --> 05:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
money uh the state's been very generous
 
05:50:29.390 --> 05:50:29.400 align:start position:0%
uh with with arpa money I think overall
 
05:50:32.150 --> 05:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
we we've now had what over 225 million I
 
05:50:34.948 --> 05:50:34.958 align:start position:0%
think uh roughly in arpa money that has
 
05:50:37.390 --> 05:50:37.400 align:start position:0%
gone to Water and Wastewater projects s
 
05:50:39.190 --> 05:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
and of course again we have had a very
 
05:50:42.150 --> 05:50:42.160 align:start position:0%
large surge uh we have about two more
 
05:50:44.350 --> 05:50:44.360 align:start position:0%
years left of it there's a 5year surge
 
05:50:47.230 --> 05:50:47.240 align:start position:0%
from the infrastructure uh funding uh
 
05:50:48.868 --> 05:50:48.878 align:start position:0%
which amounted to basically about a half
 
05:50:50.868 --> 05:50:50.878 align:start position:0%
a billion dollars uh that it's gone to
 
05:50:53.150 --> 05:50:53.160 align:start position:0%
our going to our communities uh that
 
05:50:55.030 --> 05:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
we're still in the middle of of working
 
05:50:57.990 --> 05:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
that uh a side note is all those extra
 
05:51:00.430 --> 05:51:00.440 align:start position:0%
funds the projects that we
 
05:51:03.230 --> 05:51:03.240 align:start position:0%
fund we just don't write a check and it
 
05:51:07.110 --> 05:51:07.120 align:start position:0%
goes to the community we basically it's
 
05:51:08.468 --> 05:51:08.478 align:start position:0%
kind of the opposite we award the
 
05:51:12.230 --> 05:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
community as they do the work we verify
 
05:51:14.310 --> 05:51:14.320 align:start position:0%
that the work met the criteria and then
 
05:51:17.670 --> 05:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
we issue funds as the work proceeds so
 
05:51:19.150 --> 05:51:19.160 align:start position:0%
we basically have oversight on the
 
05:51:22.230 --> 05:51:22.240 align:start position:0%
engineering of the projects and the the
 
05:51:24.390 --> 05:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
Cradle the grave as far as getting the
 
05:51:26.350 --> 05:51:26.360 align:start position:0%
project making sure it gets actually
 
05:51:28.390 --> 05:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
completed so what that means is there's
 
05:51:31.590 --> 05:51:31.600 align:start position:0%
a there's a large tail for staff with
 
05:51:32.948 --> 05:51:32.958 align:start position:0%
the great news is all this
 
05:51:34.510 --> 05:51:34.520 align:start position:0%
infrastructure money is greatly helping
 
05:51:37.030 --> 05:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
the communities but it also means
 
05:51:40.150 --> 05:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
A A Tale of a a large large time amount
 
05:51:42.990 --> 05:51:43.000 align:start position:0%
of work Associated so so to give you an
 
05:51:46.830 --> 05:51:46.840 align:start position:0%
idea uh what happens within the agency
 
05:51:49.350 --> 05:51:49.360 align:start position:0%
annually we have over we take over
 
05:51:52.830 --> 05:51:52.840 align:start position:0%
21,000 permit actions and conduct over
 
05:51:56.030 --> 05:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
16,000 inspections of various sorts we
 
05:51:58.310 --> 05:51:58.320 align:start position:0%
administer 93 types of different permits
 
05:52:01.750 --> 05:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
or approvals we Implement over 35 state
 
05:52:05.788 --> 05:52:05.798 align:start position:0%
laws we manage over 115 federal grants
 
05:52:09.468 --> 05:52:09.478 align:start position:0%
and over 4 40 dedicated fund programs um
 
05:52:12.310 --> 05:52:12.320 align:start position:0%
I'll also note note that one of the
 
05:52:14.628 --> 05:52:14.638 align:start position:0%
stressors it's a good news bad news
 
05:52:16.830 --> 05:52:16.840 align:start position:0%
story so we have a I think a more
 
05:52:19.990 --> 05:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
engaged public which is a good thing uh
 
05:52:21.788 --> 05:52:21.798 align:start position:0%
but it's also a little bit of a curse so
 
05:52:24.190 --> 05:52:24.200 align:start position:0%
what that means is uh probably this is
 
05:52:26.788 --> 05:52:26.798 align:start position:0%
part of the informational age is with
 
05:52:29.590 --> 05:52:29.600 align:start position:0%
increased public involvement we see a
 
05:52:32.150 --> 05:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
large increase now of just general
 
05:52:33.510 --> 05:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
inquiries from the public that we
 
05:52:37.708 --> 05:52:37.718 align:start position:0%
respond to uh 91a information requests
 
05:52:42.030 --> 05:52:42.040 align:start position:0%
are up uh appeals are up comments to our
 
05:52:44.468 --> 05:52:44.478 align:start position:0%
permits and our rules are up all this
 
05:52:46.750 --> 05:52:46.760 align:start position:0%
drives extra staff work you you know we
 
05:52:48.670 --> 05:52:48.680 align:start position:0%
we take pride in the word service
 
05:52:51.270 --> 05:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
services in our in our name and that's
 
05:52:53.708 --> 05:52:53.718 align:start position:0%
part of being being a service service to
 
05:52:57.030 --> 05:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
the public so so I guess it's a it's a
 
05:52:58.310 --> 05:52:58.320 align:start position:0%
blessing that we have an increased
 
05:52:59.750 --> 05:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
public awareness but it's also a little
 
05:53:02.350 --> 05:53:02.360 align:start position:0%
bit of a curse uh probably the ne the
 
05:53:04.070 --> 05:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
most important slide of our whole slide
 
05:53:07.350 --> 05:53:07.360 align:start position:0%
deck is number six and this this is uh
 
05:53:09.670 --> 05:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
highlights to our our budget so our
 
05:53:12.628 --> 05:53:12.638 align:start position:0%
efficiency budget for 26 uh fiscal year
 
05:53:15.628 --> 05:53:15.638 align:start position:0%
26 is $340 million
 
05:53:19.270 --> 05:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
approximately uh we for obvious reasons
 
05:53:21.030 --> 05:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
we we were asked to meet certain goals
 
05:53:23.868 --> 05:53:23.878 align:start position:0%
we we've met those goals for 26
 
05:53:28.030 --> 05:53:28.040 align:start position:0%
27 uh the 26 efficiency budget has a 12%
 
05:53:31.510 --> 05:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
decrease from the 25 budget uh primarily
 
05:53:32.868 --> 05:53:32.878 align:start position:0%
in loans and
 
05:53:35.350 --> 05:53:35.360 align:start position:0%
reimbursements uh the 27 efficiency
 
05:53:38.750 --> 05:53:38.760 align:start position:0%
budget decreased an additional 4% or $14
 
05:53:42.628 --> 05:53:42.638 align:start position:0%
million uh included in this request uh
 
05:53:45.230 --> 05:53:45.240 align:start position:0%
We've we are adding
 
05:53:48.750 --> 05:53:48.760 align:start position:0%
six permanent staff positions uh five in
 
05:53:50.670 --> 05:53:50.680 align:start position:0%
the efficiency budget so I know that may
 
05:53:52.910 --> 05:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
raise some eyebrows uh and I'd like to
 
05:53:56.628 --> 05:53:56.638 align:start position:0%
talk to that also so and then at the end
 
05:53:59.030 --> 05:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
and after I I hand off to Susan Carlson
 
05:54:01.270 --> 05:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
to kind of go through the different uh
 
05:54:02.868 --> 05:54:02.878 align:start position:0%
slicing and dicing as I mentioned of the
 
05:54:05.270 --> 05:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
budget uh I'd like to also come back to
 
05:54:06.868 --> 05:54:06.878 align:start position:0%
our prioritized needs
 
05:54:10.430 --> 05:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
uh and talk about a settlement on Pas
 
05:54:12.510 --> 05:54:12.520 align:start position:0%
which is really uh the biggest part part
 
05:54:14.230 --> 05:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
of that uh which which come back
 
05:54:16.070 --> 05:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
hopefully come back to our communities
 
05:54:17.830 --> 05:54:17.840 align:start position:0%
so I mentioned the positions in the
 
05:54:22.190 --> 05:54:22.200 align:start position:0%
efficiency budget uh the first position
 
05:54:25.628 --> 05:54:25.638 align:start position:0%
uh we me go back a little bit uh for you
 
05:54:27.350 --> 05:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
there's been a recent study commission
 
05:54:31.310 --> 05:54:31.320 align:start position:0%
at the legislature we own and operate as
 
05:54:37.110 --> 05:54:37.120 align:start position:0%
a state 276 dams uh the current cycle of
 
05:54:39.868 --> 05:54:39.878 align:start position:0%
rehab re rehabilitating those dams is on
 
05:54:41.190 --> 05:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
a 100-year
 
05:54:44.708 --> 05:54:44.718 align:start position:0%
cycle as you may imagine uh some dams
 
05:54:46.750 --> 05:54:46.760 align:start position:0%
are fairly simple some some are more
 
05:54:49.788 --> 05:54:49.798 align:start position:0%
more uh complex if you will some are
 
05:54:52.628 --> 05:54:52.638 align:start position:0%
high-hazard and actually pose a damage
 
05:54:56.510 --> 05:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
uh danger to uh human human health and
 
05:54:59.310 --> 05:54:59.320 align:start position:0%
Public Safety basically or property
 
05:55:02.070 --> 05:55:02.080 align:start position:0%
damage and some are very low risk but
 
05:55:05.150 --> 05:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
within that obviously we feel 100 years
 
05:55:07.030 --> 05:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
is not properly the the right right
 
05:55:09.708 --> 05:55:09.718 align:start position:0%
cycle and we're trying to reduce that uh
 
05:55:12.548 --> 05:55:12.558 align:start position:0%
as part of that we we we have a dam
 
05:55:15.510 --> 05:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
Bureau where we do several things
 
05:55:17.430 --> 05:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
related to those those State dams but
 
05:55:19.548 --> 05:55:19.558 align:start position:0%
also privately owned dams we have a dam
 
05:55:22.548 --> 05:55:22.558 align:start position:0%
safety uh program uh we actually have
 
05:55:24.708 --> 05:55:24.718 align:start position:0%
our own construction crew and we also
 
05:55:28.590 --> 05:55:28.600 align:start position:0%
manage outside contracts so for one of
 
05:55:31.230 --> 05:55:31.240 align:start position:0%
our prioritized needs I'm sorry in our
 
05:55:32.708 --> 05:55:32.718 align:start position:0%
efficiency budget one of the new
 
05:55:36.310 --> 05:55:36.320 align:start position:0%
requests is for an engineer to work uh
 
05:55:38.150 --> 05:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
emergency action plans for the for the
 
05:55:41.110 --> 05:55:41.120 align:start position:0%
state owned dams for a vast majority of
 
05:55:43.548 --> 05:55:43.558 align:start position:0%
those have not been updated since
 
05:55:47.510 --> 05:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
1996 uh we really need to to augment our
 
05:55:49.670 --> 05:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
our current engineering staff to get a
 
05:55:52.510 --> 05:55:52.520 align:start position:0%
handle on those and make sure not only
 
05:55:54.910 --> 05:55:54.920 align:start position:0%
the the emergency action plans are done
 
05:55:58.670 --> 05:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
but to to manage Rehabilitation of as we
 
05:56:01.390 --> 05:56:01.400 align:start position:0%
we increase the hopefully the frequency
 
05:56:03.910 --> 05:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
of being able to get at the damn work um
 
05:56:05.990 --> 05:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
I say that right now most of all at work
 
05:56:07.390 --> 05:56:07.400 align:start position:0%
for the most part other than an
 
05:56:10.948 --> 05:56:10.958 align:start position:0%
injection of arpa money uh 30 million of
 
05:56:13.270 --> 05:56:13.280 align:start position:0%
arpa money went into this kind of damn
 
05:56:14.948 --> 05:56:14.958 align:start position:0%
work other than that it's been all
 
05:56:16.270 --> 05:56:16.280 align:start position:0%
capital budget
 
05:56:19.510 --> 05:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
money uh as I mentioned in uh just just
 
05:56:22.430 --> 05:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
FYI so there was a study commission uh
 
05:56:24.868 --> 05:56:24.878 align:start position:0%
that that reported out on the
 
05:56:28.150 --> 05:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
legislative study commission uh on how
 
05:56:30.830 --> 05:56:30.840 align:start position:0%
do we fix this issue and they are
 
05:56:33.590 --> 05:56:33.600 align:start position:0%
looking at some kind of legislation for
 
05:56:35.990 --> 05:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
some kind of uh maintenance fees that
 
05:56:38.110 --> 05:56:38.120 align:start position:0%
type of thing for those who are on the
 
05:56:41.070 --> 05:56:41.080 align:start position:0%
water bodies that the dam support uh
 
05:56:45.150 --> 05:56:45.160 align:start position:0%
another area of where we've asked for
 
05:56:49.628 --> 05:56:49.638 align:start position:0%
within the um the the budget uh for new
 
05:56:52.910 --> 05:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
position is for our Solid Waste program
 
05:56:54.670 --> 05:56:54.680 align:start position:0%
uh this is by the way one of the areas
 
05:56:56.350 --> 05:56:56.360 align:start position:0%
where we we're certainly seeing Inc
 
05:56:58.590 --> 05:56:58.600 align:start position:0%
increases uh in public
 
05:57:02.390 --> 05:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
interest uh right now in our review of
 
05:57:06.350 --> 05:57:06.360 align:start position:0%
waste facility plans and and and permits
 
05:57:09.270 --> 05:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
uh we're seeing on average of uh like 65
 
05:57:12.468 --> 05:57:12.478 align:start position:0%
applications for a year uh and we're
 
05:57:15.270 --> 05:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
we're seeing a need to because of the
 
05:57:16.670 --> 05:57:16.680 align:start position:0%
increase in public involvement the
 
05:57:18.350 --> 05:57:18.360 align:start position:0%
increase in
 
05:57:21.030 --> 05:57:21.040 align:start position:0%
complexity uh with these we're seeing a
 
05:57:24.548 --> 05:57:24.558 align:start position:0%
need to to add an engineer there uh
 
05:57:24.558 --> 05:57:26.110 align:start position:0%
need to to add an engineer there uh
similarly

05:57:26.110 --> 05:57:26.120 align:start position:0%
similarly
 
05:57:29.868 --> 05:57:29.878 align:start position:0%
um our alteration of terrain uh program
 
05:57:32.708 --> 05:57:32.718 align:start position:0%
so this is uh water runoff issues for
 
05:57:35.430 --> 05:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
developments that type of thing uh right
 
05:57:37.628 --> 05:57:37.638 align:start position:0%
now we're very fortunate within that
 
05:57:40.948 --> 05:57:40.958 align:start position:0%
program uh we have four full-time
 
05:57:42.468 --> 05:57:42.478 align:start position:0%
Professional Engineers and we need
 
05:57:44.350 --> 05:57:44.360 align:start position:0%
Professional Engineers because we're
 
05:57:46.990 --> 05:57:47.000 align:start position:0%
reviewing other Engineers work so these
 
05:57:49.150 --> 05:57:49.160 align:start position:0%
other Engineers apply their stamp you
 
05:57:51.350 --> 05:57:51.360 align:start position:0%
need a professional engineer to review a
 
05:57:54.150 --> 05:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
Professional Engineers work we are
 
05:57:55.948 --> 05:57:55.958 align:start position:0%
really living off of we have four
 
05:57:58.270 --> 05:57:58.280 align:start position:0%
full-time Professional Engineers we've
 
05:57:59.910 --> 05:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
had three
 
05:58:02.468 --> 05:58:02.478 align:start position:0%
retirements in in the past year and a
 
05:58:05.350 --> 05:58:05.360 align:start position:0%
half uh we've been very fortunate we've
 
05:58:06.628 --> 05:58:06.638 align:start position:0%
been able to harden them back is
 
05:58:08.948 --> 05:58:08.958 align:start position:0%
part-time employees so it's a wonderful
 
05:58:11.468 --> 05:58:11.478 align:start position:0%
value for the state and that we don't we
 
05:58:13.708 --> 05:58:13.718 align:start position:0%
get somebody who's fully trained very
 
05:58:16.070 --> 05:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
good at their jobs and we're not paying
 
05:58:17.948 --> 05:58:17.958 align:start position:0%
them benefits we're just paying them a
 
05:58:21.070 --> 05:58:21.080 align:start position:0%
part-time rate I don't you know same so
 
05:58:23.548 --> 05:58:23.558 align:start position:0%
we feel that's a a good deal but but to
 
05:58:27.030 --> 05:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
be blunt the program is surviving off of
 
05:58:29.350 --> 05:58:29.360 align:start position:0%
them being willing to do that at some
 
05:58:30.788 --> 05:58:30.798 align:start position:0%
point they're going to retire in the
 
05:58:33.868 --> 05:58:33.878 align:start position:0%
near term for for real for sure without
 
05:58:36.230 --> 05:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
coming back part-time so what we're
 
05:58:39.030 --> 05:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
interested in is creating an entry level
 
05:58:40.590 --> 05:58:40.600 align:start position:0%
position we've had hard time hard time
 
05:58:42.430 --> 05:58:42.440 align:start position:0%
getting Engineers what we're interested
 
05:58:44.150 --> 05:58:44.160 align:start position:0%
in is creating an entry-level position
 
05:58:46.910 --> 05:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
where they can understudy get their PE
 
05:58:48.750 --> 05:58:48.760 align:start position:0%
and kind of grow into that position
 
05:58:50.430 --> 05:58:50.440 align:start position:0%
while we still have these these others
 
05:58:51.868 --> 05:58:51.878 align:start position:0%
so we think that's a very good bang for
 
05:58:55.750 --> 05:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
the buck for for the agency in the State
 
05:58:57.990 --> 05:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh moving try to move a little bit more
 
05:59:01.270 --> 05:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
quickly for for you also for dams uh all
 
05:59:03.910 --> 05:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
the dam work requires permitting in
 
05:59:07.628 --> 05:59:07.638 align:start position:0%
different levels uh and also need an
 
05:59:10.590 --> 05:59:10.600 align:start position:0%
environmental scientist uh to to make
 
05:59:12.468 --> 05:59:12.478 align:start position:0%
sure that we're we're working through
 
05:59:14.150 --> 05:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
that and we're able to facilitate the
 
05:59:16.590 --> 05:59:16.600 align:start position:0%
STW workk I've been talking about and
 
05:59:16.600 --> 05:59:17.670 align:start position:0%
STW workk I've been talking about and
then

05:59:17.670 --> 05:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
then
 
05:59:21.230 --> 05:59:21.240 align:start position:0%
finally uh we've put a lot of e effort
 
05:59:23.350 --> 05:59:23.360 align:start position:0%
uh we've been able to get arpa money
 
05:59:25.990 --> 05:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
capital budget money uh
 
05:59:29.510 --> 05:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
for our environmental permitting uh
 
05:59:31.670 --> 05:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
online environmental permitting so that
 
05:59:34.110 --> 05:59:34.120 align:start position:0%
that's yielded great results for
 
05:59:38.150 --> 05:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
efficiencies for our clients our public
 
05:59:40.670 --> 05:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
uh access are the Consultants that work
 
05:59:44.910 --> 05:59:44.920 align:start position:0%
in this field uh and the again good news
 
05:59:47.430 --> 05:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
bad news the more we do online the more
 
05:59:49.350 --> 05:59:49.360 align:start position:0%
we make available the more demand for
 
05:59:52.150 --> 05:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
that is and what we found is we we've
 
05:59:54.708 --> 05:59:54.718 align:start position:0%
fed a again we've fed been able to get
 
05:59:56.948 --> 05:59:56.958 align:start position:0%
some good arpa money as well as capital
 
06:00:00.548 --> 06:00:00.558 align:start position:0%
budget money uh but we need somebody to
 
06:00:03.070 --> 06:00:03.080 align:start position:0%
ongoing to manage that process as we
 
06:00:07.670 --> 06:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
work to move from paper to electronic
 
06:00:09.510 --> 06:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
and we need need somebody to help manage
 
06:00:11.628 --> 06:00:11.638 align:start position:0%
that to make sure that that proceeds
 
06:00:14.628 --> 06:00:14.638 align:start position:0%
well so uh what I'm going to do now is
 
06:00:16.670 --> 06:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
hand over to our chief operating uh
 
06:00:19.150 --> 06:00:19.160 align:start position:0%
officer Susan Carlson and as I mentioned
 
06:00:21.590 --> 06:00:21.600 align:start position:0%
she's she's those who know her know
 
06:00:23.468 --> 06:00:23.478 align:start position:0%
she's very good at the budget issues and
 
06:00:25.190 --> 06:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
and we're trying to present in the
 
06:00:28.468 --> 06:00:28.478 align:start position:0%
coming slides uh looking at different
 
06:00:30.150 --> 06:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
ways for the budget to help answer any
 
06:00:33.708 --> 06:00:33.718 align:start position:0%
questions uh in advance for you so good
 
06:00:35.270 --> 06:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
afternoon for the record my name is
 
06:00:37.310 --> 06:00:37.320 align:start position:0%
Susan Carlson and I serve as chief
 
06:00:41.350 --> 06:00:41.360 align:start position:0%
operations officer for Dees on page um
 
06:00:43.628 --> 06:00:43.638 align:start position:0%
seven what we have done is I've given
 
06:00:45.270 --> 06:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
you a pie chart that shows you the
 
06:00:48.270 --> 06:00:48.280 align:start position:0%
sources of funds um for this department
 
06:00:50.788 --> 06:00:50.798 align:start position:0%
I've used FY fiscal year
 
06:00:55.110 --> 06:00:55.120 align:start position:0%
26 um as a benchmark so you can
 
06:00:57.468 --> 06:00:57.478 align:start position:0%
understand how we do this um from the
 
06:01:00.310 --> 06:01:00.320 align:start position:0%
start I want to point out that 92% of
 
06:01:02.030 --> 06:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
the funding for this department comes
 
06:01:05.350 --> 06:01:05.360 align:start position:0%
from outside sources only 8% of our
 
06:01:07.468 --> 06:01:07.478 align:start position:0%
budget is is funded with General
 
06:01:11.868 --> 06:01:11.878 align:start position:0%
funds fees in total account for 48% of
 
06:01:14.430 --> 06:01:14.440 align:start position:0%
our total operating budget federal funds
 
06:01:17.708 --> 06:01:17.718 align:start position:0%
are now at 44% of our operating budget
 
06:01:19.510 --> 06:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
the remain are is General
 
06:01:23.350 --> 06:01:23.360 align:start position:0%
funds um the two biggest programs for
 
06:01:25.628 --> 06:01:25.638 align:start position:0%
funding we have is one is our state
 
06:01:27.670 --> 06:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
revolving loan programs for drinking
 
06:01:30.910 --> 06:01:30.920 align:start position:0%
water and waste water those two programs
 
06:01:33.430 --> 06:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
both with the federal component and the
 
06:01:36.430 --> 06:01:36.440 align:start position:0%
repayment funds account excuse me
 
06:01:39.670 --> 06:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
account for 43% of our total operating
 
06:01:42.270 --> 06:01:42.280 align:start position:0%
budget um the drinking water groundwater
 
06:01:45.510 --> 06:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
trust fund which came out of our Exon
 
06:01:49.310 --> 06:01:49.320 align:start position:0%
lawsuit accounts for 9% all other fee
 
06:01:52.110 --> 06:01:52.120 align:start position:0%
sources account for an additional 23% of
 
06:01:54.910 --> 06:01:54.920 align:start position:0%
our funding those types of fee sources
 
06:01:58.670 --> 06:01:58.680 align:start position:0%
include oil funds hazardous waste funds
 
06:02:03.150 --> 06:02:03.160 align:start position:0%
air permits Dam fees Wetland fees
 
06:02:06.430 --> 06:02:06.440 align:start position:0%
subsurface fees Shoreland fees those
 
06:02:09.750 --> 06:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
types of arguments excuse me um on the
 
06:02:13.110 --> 06:02:13.120 align:start position:0%
next slide um I've broken out in a pie
 
06:02:15.670 --> 06:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
chart the uses of those funds and I will
 
06:02:17.788 --> 06:02:17.798 align:start position:0%
go into explanation of those in more
 
06:02:20.150 --> 06:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
detail in the following slide
 
06:02:23.868 --> 06:02:23.878 align:start position:0%
essentially 68% of our operating budget
 
06:02:26.350 --> 06:02:26.360 align:start position:0%
goes out in pass through funds either in
 
06:02:30.468 --> 06:02:30.478 align:start position:0%
Grants reimbursements loans and
 
06:02:34.430 --> 06:02:34.440 align:start position:0%
contracts only 32% of our budget is for
 
06:02:34.440 --> 06:02:36.670 align:start position:0%
contracts only 32% of our budget is for
operating

06:02:36.670 --> 06:02:36.680 align:start position:0%
operating
 
06:02:38.788 --> 06:02:38.798 align:start position:0%
now the grants are a combination of
 
06:02:41.150 --> 06:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
numerous programs and cut across all
 
06:02:44.070 --> 06:02:44.080 align:start position:0%
three funding sources including such
 
06:02:46.150 --> 06:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
programs as state a grant program which
 
06:02:49.150 --> 06:02:49.160 align:start position:0%
is General funded Lake restoration which
 
06:02:51.990 --> 06:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
is Mill foil eradication which is a fee
 
06:02:54.948 --> 06:02:54.958 align:start position:0%
account the groundwater drink excuse me
 
06:02:57.270 --> 06:02:57.280 align:start position:0%
the drinking water groundwater trust
 
06:02:59.868 --> 06:02:59.878 align:start position:0%
goes out in Grants pasas also goes out
 
06:03:03.030 --> 06:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
in Grants also included our
 
06:03:06.230 --> 06:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
reimbursements reimbursements relate to
 
06:03:08.468 --> 06:03:08.478 align:start position:0%
several programs including the oil fund
 
06:03:11.230 --> 06:03:11.240 align:start position:0%
program they do reimbursements
 
06:03:14.708 --> 06:03:14.718 align:start position:0%
mtbe is um a big um reimbursement
 
06:03:18.350 --> 06:03:18.360 align:start position:0%
program and also the past program does
 
06:03:21.750 --> 06:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
reimbursement um contracts contracts
 
06:03:24.628 --> 06:03:24.638 align:start position:0%
caught across all of our programs
 
06:03:26.868 --> 06:03:26.878 align:start position:0%
include um and some of our major
 
06:03:29.230 --> 06:03:29.240 align:start position:0%
contracts include our circular program
 
06:03:31.468 --> 06:03:31.478 align:start position:0%
which is our super fund
 
06:03:35.070 --> 06:03:35.080 align:start position:0%
program um the drinking water srf bill
 
06:03:37.430 --> 06:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
funding which is new for the budget this
 
06:03:38.750 --> 06:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
for 26
 
06:03:43.590 --> 06:03:43.600 align:start position:0%
27 um and our wind emerging contaminant
 
06:03:46.230 --> 06:03:46.240 align:start position:0%
program um operating expenses are just
 
06:03:48.150 --> 06:03:48.160 align:start position:0%
what you think they are their current
 
06:03:50.350 --> 06:03:50.360 align:start position:0%
expenses their
 
06:03:52.670 --> 06:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
telecommunications um their normal
 
06:03:55.750 --> 06:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
equipment that kind of bills um Andro
 
06:03:58.750 --> 06:03:58.760 align:start position:0%
agency transfers which are only 3% of
 
06:04:01.270 --> 06:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
our operating budget include what we pay
 
06:04:03.390 --> 06:04:03.400 align:start position:0%
for building rent
 
06:04:09.430 --> 06:04:09.440 align:start position:0%
Charlie um I know Bargain Basement rate
 
06:04:14.990 --> 06:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
um doj support doit support um and and
 
06:04:17.708 --> 06:04:17.718 align:start position:0%
small amounts like EAP which is the
 
06:04:19.830 --> 06:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
employee assistance program for
 
06:04:23.910 --> 06:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
HHS salary benefits cover not only our
 
06:04:27.190 --> 06:04:27.200 align:start position:0%
493 full-time positions they also
 
06:04:31.150 --> 06:04:31.160 align:start position:0%
include 52 full-time temporary positions
 
06:04:34.230 --> 06:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
and numerous part-time staff as also
 
06:04:36.548 --> 06:04:36.558 align:start position:0%
related additional friend
 
06:04:38.750 --> 06:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
cost and health
 
06:04:42.070 --> 06:04:42.080 align:start position:0%
benefits as I've said before 68% of our
 
06:04:44.070 --> 06:04:44.080 align:start position:0%
operating budget is passed back out
 
06:04:47.150 --> 06:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
through to cities and towns in the form
 
06:04:47.160 --> 06:04:48.670 align:start position:0%
through to cities and towns in the form
various

06:04:48.670 --> 06:04:48.680 align:start position:0%
various
 
06:04:52.110 --> 06:04:52.120 align:start position:0%
forms on the next slide I've given you a
 
06:04:55.030 --> 06:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
budget analysis by cost category what
 
06:04:58.468 --> 06:04:58.478 align:start position:0%
I've done is compare the FY 25 budget to
 
06:05:00.868 --> 06:05:00.878 align:start position:0%
the 26 and then to the
 
06:05:04.150 --> 06:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
27 as you can see our overall budget
 
06:05:08.110 --> 06:05:08.120 align:start position:0%
went from 380 7 million down to $340
 
06:05:12.548 --> 06:05:12.558 align:start position:0%
million a decrease of 47 million 27 went
 
06:05:15.628 --> 06:05:15.638 align:start position:0%
down another $25 million excuse me down
 
06:05:19.468 --> 06:05:19.478 align:start position:0%
to $325 million another $14 million
 
06:05:22.590 --> 06:05:22.600 align:start position:0%
reduction you can see the single biggest
 
06:05:26.910 --> 06:05:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:30.628 --> 06:05:30.638 align:start position:0%
loans what we had in
 
06:05:34.590 --> 06:05:34.600 align:start position:0%
fy2 with the Advent of the bill money we
 
06:05:37.190 --> 06:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
had a great deal of supplemental Federal
 
06:05:40.830 --> 06:05:40.840 align:start position:0%
Loan money come in the door um for this
 
06:05:43.110 --> 06:05:43.120 align:start position:0%
department what I have what this
 
06:05:44.948 --> 06:05:44.958 align:start position:0%
department has done is we looked at that
 
06:05:48.548 --> 06:05:48.558 align:start position:0%
for FY 26 and 27 and we brought that
 
06:05:52.548 --> 06:05:52.558 align:start position:0%
bill number um loan amounts down from
 
06:05:55.310 --> 06:05:55.320 align:start position:0%
$79 million to $40
 
06:05:58.110 --> 06:05:58.120 align:start position:0%
million so we've basically brought our
 
06:06:01.110 --> 06:06:01.120 align:start position:0%
loan balances down we're seeing because
 
06:06:03.548 --> 06:06:03.558 align:start position:0%
of the arpa money we're seeing less
 
06:06:07.350 --> 06:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
request for those Direct loans right
 
06:06:11.628 --> 06:06:11.638 align:start position:0%
now we also have reduced the groundwater
 
06:06:14.590 --> 06:06:14.600 align:start position:0%
um Trust Loans from $20 million to $15
 
06:06:17.030 --> 06:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
million as we've been seeing a decrease
 
06:06:21.110 --> 06:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
in that um and the P Loan Fund is
 
06:06:24.590 --> 06:06:24.600 align:start position:0%
nearing our maximum available balance so
 
06:06:27.270 --> 06:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
we reduce that from 8 million to
 
06:06:30.468 --> 06:06:30.478 align:start position:0%
6,26 and we reduce that number to zero
 
06:06:32.788 --> 06:06:32.798 align:start position:0%
in FY
 
06:06:37.030 --> 06:06:37.040 align:start position:0%
27 um the grants we grants out of 38
 
06:06:39.390 --> 06:06:39.400 align:start position:0%
different programs in this
 
06:06:42.270 --> 06:06:42.280 align:start position:0%
department while the net changes from 25
 
06:06:45.628 --> 06:06:45.638 align:start position:0%
to 26 look small it actually refects
 
06:06:48.110 --> 06:06:48.120 align:start position:0%
four major offsetting
 
06:06:51.590 --> 06:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
changes the drinking water srf bill
 
06:06:54.670 --> 06:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
funding plus the Wastewater s
 
06:06:58.468 --> 06:06:58.478 align:start position:0%
grants um increased by $1
 
06:07:02.270 --> 06:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
million I should point out that um when
 
06:07:04.548 --> 06:07:04.558 align:start position:0%
I get to the next slide you will see a
 
06:07:06.350 --> 06:07:06.360 align:start position:0%
major increase in and general funds for
 
06:07:09.110 --> 06:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
this department and I will explain that
 
06:07:11.468 --> 06:07:11.478 align:start position:0%
to you in detail as what that is going
 
06:07:14.830 --> 06:07:14.840 align:start position:0%
on now those increases in the Wastewater
 
06:07:17.788 --> 06:07:17.798 align:start position:0%
bill money were offset by decreases in
 
06:07:20.468 --> 06:07:20.478 align:start position:0%
the drinking water groundw trust by 3
 
06:07:23.830 --> 06:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
million by reducing the wind contamin
 
06:07:25.910 --> 06:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
merging contaminant grant program by
 
06:07:25.920 --> 06:07:27.590 align:start position:0%
merging contaminant grant program by
$4.9

06:07:27.590 --> 06:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
$4.9
 
06:07:31.350 --> 06:07:31.360 align:start position:0%
million as well as the arm fund which is
 
06:07:33.830 --> 06:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
um going down by
 
06:07:37.708 --> 06:07:37.718 align:start position:0%
1.2 the decrease es in 27 reflect
 
06:07:40.868 --> 06:07:40.878 align:start position:0%
another $1.5 million reduction in the
 
06:07:43.430 --> 06:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
Wastewater side grants and another 2
 
06:07:47.390 --> 06:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
million in the groundwater trust fund on
 
06:07:47.400 --> 06:07:49.070 align:start position:0%
million in the groundwater trust fund on
the

06:07:49.070 --> 06:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:07:50.910 --> 06:07:50.920 align:start position:0%
reimbursements if you look at
 
06:07:52.548 --> 06:07:52.558 align:start position:0%
reimbursements you will notice
 
06:07:55.350 --> 06:07:55.360 align:start position:0%
reimbursements are down that is because
 
06:07:58.230 --> 06:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
the mtbe program that we received
 
06:08:02.270 --> 06:08:02.280 align:start position:0%
settlement fund for um is ending so the
 
06:08:05.070 --> 06:08:05.080 align:start position:0%
funding for reimbursements went from 9.5
 
06:08:05.080 --> 06:08:05.948 align:start position:0%
funding for reimbursements went from 9.5
million

06:08:05.948 --> 06:08:05.958 align:start position:0%
million
 
06:08:10.750 --> 06:08:10.760 align:start position:0%
in 25 did 2.5 million 26 and did
 
06:08:10.760 --> 06:08:13.230 align:start position:0%
in 25 did 2.5 million 26 and did
$500,000

06:08:13.230 --> 06:08:13.240 align:start position:0%
$500,000
 
06:08:17.110 --> 06:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
27 contracts increased by a small amount
 
06:08:21.350 --> 06:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
in in 26 we have 77 different programs
 
06:08:23.948 --> 06:08:23.958 align:start position:0%
with contract funds in there that vary
 
06:08:27.868 --> 06:08:27.878 align:start position:0%
funding from year to year for FY 26 the
 
06:08:31.468 --> 06:08:31.478 align:start position:0%
cira federal program in saw an increase
 
06:08:35.628 --> 06:08:35.638 align:start position:0%
in contracts for $5 million going from1
 
06:08:39.110 --> 06:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
to $21 million for a large anticipated
 
06:08:41.510 --> 06:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
increase in Federal Circle
 
06:08:44.788 --> 06:08:44.798 align:start position:0%
funding we front loaded these contracts
 
06:08:46.150 --> 06:08:46.160 align:start position:0%
in FY
 
06:08:49.030 --> 06:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
26 so in order to get the remediation
 
06:08:52.110 --> 06:08:52.120 align:start position:0%
work done on these super fund sites um
 
06:08:56.788 --> 06:08:56.798 align:start position:0%
and reduce the FY 27 budget back to $16
 
06:08:59.750 --> 06:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
million salary and benefits overall
 
06:09:03.270 --> 06:09:03.280 align:start position:0%
operating cost overall um where within
 
06:09:05.150 --> 06:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
what we consider normal parameters was
 
06:09:08.750 --> 06:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:11.830 --> 06:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
3% if you go to the next
 
06:09:15.788 --> 06:09:15.798 align:start position:0%
slide I did the same analysis by funding
 
06:09:15.798 --> 06:09:17.390 align:start position:0%
slide I did the same analysis by funding
source

06:09:17.390 --> 06:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
source
 
06:09:20.628 --> 06:09:20.638 align:start position:0%
fy2 shows a general fund appropriation
 
06:09:27.190 --> 06:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
of 18.5 million FY 26 shows a 29.4 s
 
06:09:30.030 --> 06:09:30.040 align:start position:0%

General
 
06:09:34.510 --> 06:09:34.520 align:start position:0%
funds what's driving this increase
 
06:09:35.948 --> 06:09:35.958 align:start position:0%
essentially what is driving this
 
06:09:38.230 --> 06:09:38.240 align:start position:0%
increase is the Wastewater state aid
 
06:09:44.390 --> 06:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
grant program we received funding in FY
 
06:09:49.990 --> 06:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
203 to cover the FY 24 and the fy2
 
06:09:52.468 --> 06:09:52.478 align:start position:0%
funding for this
 
06:09:55.350 --> 06:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
program James was kind enough to let us
 
06:09:57.430 --> 06:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
put this funding back in the operating
 
06:09:58.750 --> 06:09:58.760 align:start position:0%
budget for
 
06:10:02.468 --> 06:10:02.478 align:start position:0%
2627 for the last four fiscal years the
 
06:10:06.390 --> 06:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
SAG program has been funded out of hb2
 
06:10:08.190 --> 06:10:08.200 align:start position:0%
and not out of the operating budget
 
06:10:10.390 --> 06:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
prior to that this program was always in
 
06:10:11.628 --> 06:10:11.638 align:start position:0%
the operating
 
06:10:15.190 --> 06:10:15.200 align:start position:0%
budget so while it looks a bit deceiving
 
06:10:17.990 --> 06:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
we are actually not essentially
 
06:10:19.750 --> 06:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
increasing our general fund
 
06:10:22.150 --> 06:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
Appropriations or use of General funds
 
06:10:25.070 --> 06:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
from 25 to
 
06:10:28.868 --> 06:10:28.878 align:start position:0%
26 um the changes in the other funding
 
06:10:32.510 --> 06:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
sources like the federal funds srf um
 
06:10:34.788 --> 06:10:34.798 align:start position:0%
mirror our changes in expenditures
 
06:10:36.788 --> 06:10:36.798 align:start position:0%
obviously if we drop our federal loan
 
06:10:39.628 --> 06:10:39.638 align:start position:0%
programs the federal srf funds drop by
 
06:10:42.350 --> 06:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
the same amount of money as we've noted
 
06:10:44.150 --> 06:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
the drinking water ground weather trust
 
06:10:46.670 --> 06:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
fund um we are nearing the end of our
 
06:10:49.230 --> 06:10:49.240 align:start position:0%
current funding balance for that so that
 
06:10:50.510 --> 06:10:50.520 align:start position:0%
is showing
 
06:10:54.230 --> 06:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
decreases and we are also um adjusting
 
06:10:57.590 --> 06:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
all our other funds downwards um for
 
06:11:00.948 --> 06:11:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:03.670 --> 06:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
programs now I'm going to turn it back
 
06:11:06.590 --> 06:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
over to the commissioner so may maybe we
 
06:11:08.150 --> 06:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
for interest of time we'll just skip
 
06:11:11.190 --> 06:11:11.200 align:start position:0%
slide slide 11 and go right to slide 12
 
06:11:15.190 --> 06:11:15.200 align:start position:0%
I mentioned prioritize needs uh I'll the
 
06:11:16.750 --> 06:11:16.760 align:start position:0%
first one I'll mentioned I I'm well
 
06:11:18.590 --> 06:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
aware there's likely a need to do
 
06:11:21.708 --> 06:11:21.718 align:start position:0%
further Cuts uh not the other way around
 
06:11:23.548 --> 06:11:23.558 align:start position:0%
but should there be uh additional
 
06:11:27.310 --> 06:11:27.320 align:start position:0%
funding available uh we have a position
 
06:11:31.270 --> 06:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
request uh and I'll I'll start with
 
06:11:34.510 --> 06:11:34.520 align:start position:0%
uh we we've had great success uh
 
06:11:36.670 --> 06:11:36.680 align:start position:0%
embedding uh attorneys in some of our
 
06:11:39.868 --> 06:11:39.878 align:start position:0%
larger programs and in one case our land
 
06:11:41.910 --> 06:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
manage management resource program so
 
06:11:43.670 --> 06:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
that that includes Wetlands alteration
 
06:11:45.948 --> 06:11:45.958 align:start position:0%
train Shoreland and septic and what
 
06:11:48.948 --> 06:11:48.958 align:start position:0%
that's done is allowed us to as we look
 
06:11:51.430 --> 06:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
at uh you know under Governor sonuna
 
06:11:52.948 --> 06:11:52.958 align:start position:0%
we've been spending a lot of time trying
 
06:11:54.430 --> 06:11:54.440 align:start position:0%
to look at ways to streamline our
 
06:11:57.750 --> 06:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
permitting processes uh usually what you
 
06:11:59.030 --> 06:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
really need to do is start with what the
 
06:12:01.150 --> 06:12:01.160 align:start position:0%
LW says and then work backwards so we
 
06:12:03.910 --> 06:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
have a lot of historical rules that have
 
06:12:07.230 --> 06:12:07.240 align:start position:0%
kind of morphed over time frame and
 
06:12:09.110 --> 06:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
we've had a lot of success having an
 
06:12:11.788 --> 06:12:11.798 align:start position:0%
embedded uh attorney in the program work
 
06:12:14.150 --> 06:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
with the staff on starting with what is
 
06:12:15.910 --> 06:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
what is the law says what is what's the
 
06:12:18.150 --> 06:12:18.160 align:start position:0%
got to do here and then trying to cut
 
06:12:20.948 --> 06:12:20.958 align:start position:0%
call out things from there uh as I
 
06:12:23.750 --> 06:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
mention also uh we have a lot more
 
06:12:26.468 --> 06:12:26.478 align:start position:0%
public involvement which means uh a a
 
06:12:29.510 --> 06:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
lot more review of things like 91a
 
06:12:32.070 --> 06:12:32.080 align:start position:0%
requests uh and inquiries and appeals
 
06:12:34.070 --> 06:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
are happening more so that's all driving
 
06:12:36.230 --> 06:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
more legal work so we've had good
 
06:12:38.310 --> 06:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
success in our Water Division or our
 
06:12:40.468 --> 06:12:40.478 align:start position:0%
land resource management Bureau doing
 
06:12:43.230 --> 06:12:43.240 align:start position:0%
that what I'd like to do should we be
 
06:12:46.430 --> 06:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
able to have that kind of uh funding
 
06:12:48.670 --> 06:12:48.680 align:start position:0%
available is to do the same thing for
 
06:12:50.830 --> 06:12:50.840 align:start position:0%
our Waste Management division so that's
 
06:12:53.750 --> 06:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
the the the first item the the largest
 
06:12:56.548 --> 06:12:56.558 align:start position:0%
issue you see for prioritized needs has
 
06:13:00.070 --> 06:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
to do with um the lawsuit uh the
 
06:13:02.670 --> 06:13:02.680 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office has with the
 
06:13:05.390 --> 06:13:05.400 align:start position:0%
with 3m and Dupont for drink Drinking
 
06:13:08.430 --> 06:13:08.440 align:start position:0%
Water Systems related to past
 
06:13:13.590 --> 06:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
contamination so that lawsuit uh is is
 
06:13:16.430 --> 06:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
in settlement uh the settlements uh the
 
06:13:19.948 --> 06:13:19.958 align:start position:0%
money's not have been have not been uh
 
06:13:23.230 --> 06:13:23.240 align:start position:0%
uh sent out yet to the States but the
 
06:13:24.670 --> 06:13:24.680 align:start position:0%
formula has been
 
06:13:27.110 --> 06:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
established uh by which we will be
 
06:13:29.510 --> 06:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
receiving money uh the Attorney
 
06:13:31.910 --> 06:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
General's office and our staff at Dees
 
06:13:34.510 --> 06:13:34.520 align:start position:0%
have spent a lot lot of time uh
 
06:13:36.070 --> 06:13:36.080 align:start position:0%
ultimately representing the Water
 
06:13:39.868 --> 06:13:39.878 align:start position:0%
Systems in our in our state uh we will
 
06:13:42.190 --> 06:13:42.200 align:start position:0%
I'll say two things on that briefly uh
 
06:13:45.430 --> 06:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
we'll beginning not nearly as much as
 
06:13:47.190 --> 06:13:47.200 align:start position:0%
the state deserves for the for the money
 
06:13:49.548 --> 06:13:49.558 align:start position:0%
and the Water Systems have been impacted
 
06:13:51.190 --> 06:13:51.200 align:start position:0%
but proportional to other states I
 
06:13:52.910 --> 06:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
believe we're getting a lot more
 
06:13:56.030 --> 06:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
actually um so that settlement monies we
 
06:13:59.230 --> 06:13:59.240 align:start position:0%
think will start to flow in the New Year
 
06:14:01.788 --> 06:14:01.798 align:start position:0%
we're not exactly sure when uh we
 
06:14:04.628 --> 06:14:04.638 align:start position:0%
believe it will be at least $55 million
 
06:14:06.510 --> 06:14:06.520 align:start position:0%
that will funnel through the drinking
 
06:14:08.110 --> 06:14:08.120 align:start position:0%
water ground water trust fund we've
 
06:14:09.468 --> 06:14:09.478 align:start position:0%
already gone to the trust fund and they
 
06:14:12.910 --> 06:14:12.920 align:start position:0%
are going to then have the agency
 
06:14:15.868 --> 06:14:15.878 align:start position:0%
Dees proportionally for those impacted
 
06:14:15.878 --> 06:14:16.910 align:start position:0%
Dees proportionally for those impacted
Water

06:14:16.910 --> 06:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
Water
 
06:14:19.430 --> 06:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
Systems will be able to be reimbursed
 
06:14:21.948 --> 06:14:21.958 align:start position:0%
proportionally out of that fund so we
 
06:14:25.708 --> 06:14:25.718 align:start position:0%
expect that we we we are very sure we'll
 
06:14:28.430 --> 06:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
be getting that type of money in the New
 
06:14:30.110 --> 06:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
Year we're asking to put that in
 
06:14:30.120 --> 06:14:31.270 align:start position:0%
Year we're asking to put that in
prioritized

06:14:31.270 --> 06:14:31.280 align:start position:0%
prioritized
 
06:14:34.510 --> 06:14:34.520 align:start position:0%
needs uh that's our largest and then
 
06:14:36.110 --> 06:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
then uh
 
06:14:38.390 --> 06:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
I assume mentioned the Charlie I think
 
06:14:40.788 --> 06:14:40.798 align:start position:0%
uh we do have prioritized needs passrs
 
06:14:43.230 --> 06:14:43.240 align:start position:0%
from other agencies we our main office
 
06:14:46.708 --> 06:14:46.718 align:start position:0%
at Hazen Drive is is uh you know admin
 
06:14:48.510 --> 06:14:48.520 align:start position:0%
Services doeses the maintenance and and
 
06:14:51.190 --> 06:14:51.200 align:start position:0%
all the work on that building so our
 
06:14:54.830 --> 06:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
portion of that payment is there uh we
 
06:14:58.030 --> 06:14:58.040 align:start position:0%
also doit is in the same building they
 
06:14:59.788 --> 06:14:59.798 align:start position:0%
have the same type of thing their pass
 
06:15:02.110 --> 06:15:02.120 align:start position:0%
through subsequently to us is included
 
06:15:04.110 --> 06:15:04.120 align:start position:0%
in this as well as the Department of
 
06:15:06.670 --> 06:15:06.680 align:start position:0%
Justice uh they have a new new new digs
 
06:15:09.350 --> 06:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
which is great for them uh but all that
 
06:15:11.868 --> 06:15:11.878 align:start position:0%
comes M maintaining buildings cost money
 
06:15:14.190 --> 06:15:14.200 align:start position:0%
and and so that portion for the
 
06:15:16.468 --> 06:15:16.478 align:start position:0%
environmental Bureau that we support uh
 
06:15:19.670 --> 06:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
that prioritized need is here also so so
 
06:15:21.750 --> 06:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
with that uh hopefully we didn't take
 
06:15:23.150 --> 06:15:23.160 align:start position:0%
too much time I didn't pay attention to
 
06:15:25.190 --> 06:15:25.200 align:start position:0%
the clock but we certainly obviously can
 
06:15:27.230 --> 06:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
answer any
 
06:15:31.030 --> 06:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
questions thank you um New Hampshire
 
06:15:34.230 --> 06:15:34.240 align:start position:0%
clearly has a p fast problem and while
 
06:15:36.110 --> 06:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
we've devoted a significant amount of
 
06:15:38.110 --> 06:15:38.120 align:start position:0%
money to it one of the things I've been
 
06:15:40.310 --> 06:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
trying to I think probably failed to
 
06:15:42.670 --> 06:15:42.680 align:start position:0%
completely understand is is the scope of
 
06:15:45.350 --> 06:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
that problem so I'll ask my question
 
06:15:47.468 --> 06:15:47.478 align:start position:0%
this way if I could write you a you have
 
06:15:49.830 --> 06:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
a blank check and write you an amount
 
06:15:51.310 --> 06:15:51.320 align:start position:0%
how much money would I have to write for
 
06:15:53.190 --> 06:15:53.200 align:start position:0%
you to say New Hampshire no longer has a
 
06:15:53.200 --> 06:15:55.670 align:start position:0%
you to say New Hampshire no longer has a
past

06:15:55.670 --> 06:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
past
 
06:15:58.110 --> 06:15:58.120 align:start position:0%
problem a lot of pieces to that I I
 
06:15:59.350 --> 06:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
would say if you're willing to write a
 
06:16:01.310 --> 06:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
billion dollar check perhaps but it
 
06:16:03.070 --> 06:16:03.080 align:start position:0%
depends on what you mean by a problem I
 
06:16:07.788 --> 06:16:07.798 align:start position:0%
guess but p is UB quitous in in the
 
06:16:10.270 --> 06:16:10.280 align:start position:0%
world but certainly in the State uh the
 
06:16:12.390 --> 06:16:12.400 align:start position:0%
southern part of New Hampshire uh is is
 
06:16:12.400 --> 06:16:13.430 align:start position:0%
southern part of New Hampshire uh is is
greatly

06:16:13.430 --> 06:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
greatly
 
06:16:16.590 --> 06:16:16.600 align:start position:0%
impacted uh so we've been focusing on
 
06:16:20.110 --> 06:16:20.120 align:start position:0%
people's drinking water uh as a primary
 
06:16:21.910 --> 06:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
issue the settlement agreement we were
 
06:16:24.670 --> 06:16:24.680 align:start position:0%
talking about with the 3M focuses on
 
06:16:27.628 --> 06:16:27.638 align:start position:0%
Public Water Systems uh there we are
 
06:16:29.270 --> 06:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
also spending a lot of time on people's
 
06:16:32.150 --> 06:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
private Wells so we run a rebate program
 
06:16:36.310 --> 06:16:36.320 align:start position:0%
Etc so it's a very large problem per se
 
06:16:39.390 --> 06:16:39.400 align:start position:0%
uh but but again I I want to remind
 
06:16:41.548 --> 06:16:41.558 align:start position:0%
everybody p is not the only contaminant
 
06:16:44.390 --> 06:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
that we deal with
 
06:16:48.548 --> 06:16:48.558 align:start position:0%
so Senator gr um as I understand it
 
06:16:50.430 --> 06:16:50.440 align:start position:0%
there's a whole lot of
 
06:16:53.830 --> 06:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
plal chemicals out there some have been
 
06:16:58.910 --> 06:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
identified as problems and to go to his
 
06:17:01.868 --> 06:17:01.878 align:start position:0%
question is that some of those others
 
06:17:03.910 --> 06:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
may be identified as problems in the
 
06:17:06.830 --> 06:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
future and that's why it
 
06:17:09.670 --> 06:17:09.680 align:start position:0%
is a mountain you can't climb right now
 
06:17:11.830 --> 06:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
you you can't get an
 
06:17:15.110 --> 06:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
estimate I agree that there's over
 
06:17:17.468 --> 06:17:17.478 align:start position:0%
4,000 of these type of
 
06:17:21.190 --> 06:17:21.200 align:start position:0%
compounds we only regulate uh gosh I
 
06:17:24.190 --> 06:17:24.200 align:start position:0%
forget four of them and I think epa's
 
06:17:25.230 --> 06:17:25.240 align:start position:0%
suggesting they're only going to
 
06:17:28.510 --> 06:17:28.520 align:start position:0%
regulate six of them and the reason for
 
06:17:30.270 --> 06:17:30.280 align:start position:0%
that certainly I can speak for our state
 
06:17:32.750 --> 06:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
standards is because this is developing
 
06:17:35.948 --> 06:17:35.958 align:start position:0%
science as we go so there is not data on
 
06:17:38.548 --> 06:17:38.558 align:start position:0%
all those other uh compounds so which is
 
06:17:40.468 --> 06:17:40.478 align:start position:0%
very frustrating for the public you know
 
06:17:48.750 --> 06:17:48.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:52.708 --> 06:17:52.718 align:start position:0%
reality I um I restarted my heart after
 
06:17:54.270 --> 06:17:54.280 align:start position:0%
I heard James say if I could write you a
 
06:17:56.910 --> 06:17:56.920 align:start position:0%
blank check hoping to God he doesn't say
 
06:18:01.468 --> 06:18:01.478 align:start position:0%
that again when HHS is here um or anyone
 
06:18:05.468 --> 06:18:05.478 align:start position:0%
else um I'm teasing um
 
06:18:08.670 --> 06:18:08.680 align:start position:0%
92% of your budget is non-general funds
 
06:18:12.590 --> 06:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
which is great for you um compared to
 
06:18:15.548 --> 06:18:15.558 align:start position:0%
those of us who are the other way around
 
06:18:18.150 --> 06:18:18.160 align:start position:0%
um it means that you have lots and lots
 
06:18:19.390 --> 06:18:19.400 align:start position:0%
of different
 
06:18:22.070 --> 06:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
funds and lots and lots of funds which
 
06:18:25.190 --> 06:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
have balances and uh it's I'm thinking
 
06:18:27.830 --> 06:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
in the back of my head of uh
 
06:18:29.788 --> 06:18:29.798 align:start position:0%
periodically an agency will have a
 
06:18:31.788 --> 06:18:31.798 align:start position:0%
program that's funded by a
 
06:18:35.150 --> 06:18:35.160 align:start position:0%
fund and um the fund has a Surplus
 
06:18:37.628 --> 06:18:37.638 align:start position:0%
that's slowly diminishing and two or 3
 
06:18:41.230 --> 06:18:41.240 align:start position:0%
years later we get a frantic phone call
 
06:18:43.990 --> 06:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
from that agency saying yeah when we set
 
06:18:47.468 --> 06:18:47.478 align:start position:0%
this up in 2007 we had lot of money for
 
06:18:49.548 --> 06:18:49.558 align:start position:0%
this and that doesn't raise any money
 
06:18:51.910 --> 06:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
anymore and I wonder if you have a have
 
06:18:53.750 --> 06:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
some kind of report internally about
 
06:18:54.868 --> 06:18:54.878 align:start position:0%
like what are your B what are your fund
 
06:18:56.948 --> 06:18:56.958 align:start position:0%
balances for your for like how many
 
06:18:59.708 --> 06:18:59.718 align:start position:0%
different funds do you have like 40 or
 
06:19:03.350 --> 06:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
50 um we have over 40 different um
 
06:19:05.310 --> 06:19:05.320 align:start position:0%
dedicated fee accounts
 
06:19:07.868 --> 06:19:07.878 align:start position:0%
and actually we report out to you every
 
06:19:10.350 --> 06:19:10.360 align:start position:0%
year and as of June 30th what the fund
 
06:19:13.430 --> 06:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
balances are in our dedicated fund
 
06:19:17.110 --> 06:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
report um obviously we have two
 
06:19:19.868 --> 06:19:19.878 align:start position:0%
funds um the srf drinking water and
 
06:19:21.910 --> 06:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
waste water that make up the majority of
 
06:19:24.628 --> 06:19:24.638 align:start position:0%
our dedicated fund balances they are our
 
06:19:29.788 --> 06:19:29.798 align:start position:0%
big ones um after that um it ranges from
 
06:19:32.150 --> 06:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
a few million dollars all the way down
 
06:19:35.430 --> 06:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
to tons of thousands of dollars we try
 
06:19:38.590 --> 06:19:38.600 align:start position:0%
to manage every one of those funds so
 
06:19:40.548 --> 06:19:40.558 align:start position:0%
that we do not have to come running to
 
06:19:43.150 --> 06:19:43.160 align:start position:0%
Evan Services saying we're out of
 
06:19:46.270 --> 06:19:46.280 align:start position:0%
money and I um and and I appreciate that
 
06:19:48.468 --> 06:19:48.478 align:start position:0%
and I actually been reviewing a copy of
 
06:19:53.030 --> 06:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
the dedicated funds report last week um
 
06:19:55.868 --> 06:19:55.878 align:start position:0%
are there any of those funds and because
 
06:19:58.150 --> 06:19:58.160 align:start position:0%
I didn't review it that carefully
 
06:20:00.030 --> 06:20:00.040 align:start position:0%
because it's not quite as long as the
 
06:20:03.350 --> 06:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
budget but close um are there anywh you
 
06:20:05.468 --> 06:20:05.478 align:start position:0%
see a diminishing balance where where
 
06:20:06.548 --> 06:20:06.558 align:start position:0%
the because some of them support
 
06:20:08.430 --> 06:20:08.440 align:start position:0%
operations right yes some of them are
 
06:20:10.190 --> 06:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
more like loan funds where you loan less
 
06:20:11.390 --> 06:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
money next year if you don't have enough
 
06:20:13.270 --> 06:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
money and all of that but some of them
 
06:20:15.708 --> 06:20:15.718 align:start position:0%
support operations the majority of the
 
06:20:18.270 --> 06:20:18.280 align:start position:0%
number of our funds support operations
 
06:20:19.910 --> 06:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
and and do you see any of them where
 
06:20:22.230 --> 06:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
where sort of the annual the annual in
 
06:20:24.390 --> 06:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
and the annual out are are starting to
 
06:20:24.400 --> 06:20:26.150 align:start position:0%
and the annual out are are starting to
get

06:20:26.150 --> 06:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
get
 
06:20:29.430 --> 06:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
sketchy not sketchy but I'm taking in
 
06:20:33.110 --> 06:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
180 Grand this year and we spent 204 yes
 
06:20:37.150 --> 06:20:37.160 align:start position:0%
we do have some that we need to revisit
 
06:20:40.868 --> 06:20:40.878 align:start position:0%
um essentially either the the revenue
 
06:20:42.310 --> 06:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
side or the expenditure side of the
 
06:20:44.548 --> 06:20:44.558 align:start position:0%
house we're always constantly watching
 
06:20:47.548 --> 06:20:47.558 align:start position:0%
those um balances to make sure that we
 
06:20:50.150 --> 06:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
stay within our funding sources and most
 
06:20:53.310 --> 06:20:53.320 align:start position:0%
of your fee increases are done through
 
06:20:54.468 --> 06:20:54.478 align:start position:0%
through the budget or do you have
 
06:20:57.070 --> 06:20:57.080 align:start position:0%
Authority or legislation it would
 
06:21:00.150 --> 06:21:00.160 align:start position:0%
require us going for legislation for fee
 
06:21:02.310 --> 06:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
increases you don't have any fees that
 
06:21:04.670 --> 06:21:04.680 align:start position:0%
you directly just control you can raise
 
06:21:07.830 --> 06:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
if you have cause we have very
 
06:21:10.670 --> 06:21:10.680 align:start position:0%
few okay good thank you very
 
06:21:13.548 --> 06:21:13.558 align:start position:0%
much oh and you're not going to have to
 
06:21:16.670 --> 06:21:16.680 align:start position:0%
fund the prioritized need for das CU
 
06:21:19.070 --> 06:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
pretty sure we're getting less not
 
06:21:21.670 --> 06:21:21.680 align:start position:0%
more um yeah and that's one of the
 
06:21:24.270 --> 06:21:24.280 align:start position:0%
reasons we put um those pass through
 
06:21:26.390 --> 06:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs in a single accounting
 
06:21:28.910 --> 06:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
unit so that when a final decision is
 
06:21:32.310 --> 06:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
made we can adjust our budget for any
 
06:21:37.750 --> 06:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:41.110 --> 06:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
represent W thank you as I recall we
 
06:21:43.948 --> 06:21:43.958 align:start position:0%
used to call these State resolving State
 
06:21:47.030 --> 06:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
revolving loan funds and they were
 
06:21:49.468 --> 06:21:49.478 align:start position:0%
supposed to re the the towns and cities
 
06:21:51.390 --> 06:21:51.400 align:start position:0%
and water systems were supposed to repay
 
06:21:53.070 --> 06:21:53.080 align:start position:0%
them we
 
06:21:56.070 --> 06:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
forgave a major portion of that loan how
 
06:21:59.948 --> 06:21:59.958 align:start position:0%
much do we forgive on the loan
 
06:22:04.948 --> 06:22:04.958 align:start position:0%
payments um in the srf program um we
 
06:22:09.070 --> 06:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
have um required principal forgiveness
 
06:22:11.468 --> 06:22:11.478 align:start position:0%
on um dollar amounts on the various
 
06:22:14.708 --> 06:22:14.718 align:start position:0%
Federal programs so for instance on the
 
06:22:19.150 --> 06:22:19.160 align:start position:0%
drinking water um Federal program EPA
 
06:22:22.590 --> 06:22:22.600 align:start position:0%
will tell us that for your FY 24 program
 
06:22:23.708 --> 06:22:23.718 align:start position:0%
you have to
 
06:22:26.990 --> 06:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
forgive $4.5 million in principal
 
06:22:28.910 --> 06:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
forgiveness for that Federal program for
 
06:22:32.110 --> 06:22:32.120 align:start position:0%
that Grant year um so it varies by the
 
06:22:34.510 --> 06:22:34.520 align:start position:0%
federal year and how much we are being
 
06:22:35.948 --> 06:22:35.958 align:start position:0%
told that we have to
 
06:22:39.548 --> 06:22:39.558 align:start position:0%
forgive but we try not my personal
 
06:22:41.390 --> 06:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
opinion is I try not to forgive any
 
06:22:44.868 --> 06:22:44.878 align:start position:0%
loans but we do forgive portions alone
 
06:22:47.150 --> 06:22:47.160 align:start position:0%
and um it's tiered under our
 
06:22:49.070 --> 06:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
administrative rules the most
 
06:22:53.030 --> 06:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged programs get the highest
 
06:22:56.468 --> 06:22:56.478 align:start position:0%
um um principle forgiveness so we don't
 
06:22:58.468 --> 06:22:58.478 align:start position:0%
have any way to say we're not going to
 
06:23:01.110 --> 06:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
forgive as much and have them pay
 
06:23:03.750 --> 06:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
more again it's controll it's controlled
 
06:23:07.868 --> 06:23:07.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:33.430 --> 06:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:07.350 --> 06:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:09.110 --> 06:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
we got most of the budget I would like
 
06:24:11.390 --> 06:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
to invite Health and Human Health and
 
06:24:21.670 --> 06:24:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:24.150 --> 06:24:24.160 align:start position:0%
presentation I'd like to welcome
 
06:24:32.670 --> 06:24:32.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:36.468 --> 06:24:36.478 align:start position:0%
hearing good afternoon good afternoon
 
06:24:39.510 --> 06:24:39.520 align:start position:0%

elect aot and committee thank you for
 
06:24:45.430 --> 06:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to present our $3.5
 
06:24:48.590 --> 06:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
billion budget in 45 minutes uh will be
 
06:24:51.548 --> 06:24:51.558 align:start position:0%
a challenge um I have uh Nathan white
 
06:24:54.350 --> 06:24:54.360 align:start position:0%
here today with me as a CFO um and we're
 
06:24:55.910 --> 06:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
going to walk you through the slide deck
 
06:24:57.628 --> 06:24:57.638 align:start position:0%
I think that that you have in front of
 
06:25:00.628 --> 06:25:00.638 align:start position:0%
you um I did have to ask myself if there
 
06:25:03.190 --> 06:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
was a strategy that we were last was it
 
06:25:06.070 --> 06:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
that you saved the best for last last or
 
06:25:08.830 --> 06:25:08.840 align:start position:0%
um just the biggest for last um so we'll
 
06:25:10.270 --> 06:25:10.280 align:start position:0%
do our best here I know that you've all
 
06:25:12.070 --> 06:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
been here for three long days and that
 
06:25:14.150 --> 06:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
we're the last of the bunch here to go
 
06:25:18.390 --> 06:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
so we'll get started um on the agenda
 
06:25:20.990 --> 06:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
how we've sort of decided to parse out
 
06:25:23.070 --> 06:25:23.080 align:start position:0%
for you presentation of our budget is
 
06:25:26.070 --> 06:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
really on the agenda slide of doing an
 
06:25:28.270 --> 06:25:28.280 align:start position:0%
overview of the department talking a
 
06:25:30.230 --> 06:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
little bit about our road map which is
 
06:25:32.670 --> 06:25:32.680 align:start position:0%
our strategic priorities for
 
06:25:34.948 --> 06:25:34.958 align:start position:0%
2425 a little bit about the department
 
06:25:37.150 --> 06:25:37.160 align:start position:0%
overview some staffing and then we'll
 
06:25:39.628 --> 06:25:39.638 align:start position:0%
get into the budgets uh by
 
06:25:43.310 --> 06:25:43.320 align:start position:0%
agency so moving on to slide three in
 
06:25:45.750 --> 06:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
terms of uh our vision mission and
 
06:25:47.468 --> 06:25:47.478 align:start position:0%
values basically who we are as a
 
06:25:49.948 --> 06:25:49.958 align:start position:0%
department our vision is is pretty
 
06:25:52.150 --> 06:25:52.160 align:start position:0%
simple Optimal Health and well-being for
 
06:25:54.468 --> 06:25:54.478 align:start position:0%
all and we have our mission statement as
 
06:25:56.788 --> 06:25:56.798 align:start position:0%
well as our values and our values are
 
06:25:58.270 --> 06:25:58.280 align:start position:0%
operating principles that we as a
 
06:26:01.270 --> 06:26:01.280 align:start position:0%
Workforce in the department um focus on
 
06:26:03.590 --> 06:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
is prevention people focused integrity
 
06:26:07.030 --> 06:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
and community oriented oriented excuse
 
06:26:10.390 --> 06:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
me on slide four really what is the
 
06:26:11.830 --> 06:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the department
 
06:26:13.510 --> 06:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
everyone says the department is so big
 
06:26:16.430 --> 06:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
what do you do um at its I Tred to to
 
06:26:19.270 --> 06:26:19.280 align:start position:0%
cons to keep it concise we deliver
 
06:26:21.830 --> 06:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
services to clients um which is a big
 
06:26:23.708 --> 06:26:23.718 align:start position:0%
part of our work so we do that through
 
06:26:25.750 --> 06:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
some of our case management systems and
 
06:26:28.830 --> 06:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
we do that internally but we also
 
06:26:31.670 --> 06:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
through our partners and uh providers in
 
06:26:33.830 --> 06:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
the community a big bulk of the work
 
06:26:35.708 --> 06:26:35.718 align:start position:0%
that we do do is Contracting that work
 
06:26:37.830 --> 06:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
out and having our providers carry that
 
06:26:40.628 --> 06:26:40.638 align:start position:0%
work out for us we also do Direct Care
 
06:26:42.628 --> 06:26:42.638 align:start position:0%
Services through New Hampshire hospital
 
06:26:44.788 --> 06:26:44.798 align:start position:0%
Glen Cliff home Hamstead hospital and
 
06:26:46.270 --> 06:26:46.280 align:start position:0%
the Youth Development Center so those
 
06:26:48.990 --> 06:26:49.000 align:start position:0%
are our 247 facilities where actual
 
06:26:51.948 --> 06:26:51.958 align:start position:0%
Direct Care is being delivered uh we
 
06:26:53.868 --> 06:26:53.878 align:start position:0%
also responsible for protection so when
 
06:26:55.510 --> 06:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
we think about child protection and
 
06:26:57.990 --> 06:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
adult protection uh we think about food
 
06:27:00.948 --> 06:27:00.958 align:start position:0%
service protection uh disease prevention
 
06:27:03.590 --> 06:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
surveillance housing supports uh for
 
06:27:06.628 --> 06:27:06.638 align:start position:0%
looking at those becoming or who may at
 
06:27:09.670 --> 06:27:09.680 align:start position:0%
risk of becoming um homeless um as well
 
06:27:11.750 --> 06:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
as regulatory oversight so we have
 
06:27:13.910 --> 06:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
health facilities which is a lot of our
 
06:27:15.788 --> 06:27:15.798 align:start position:0%
nursing facilities we have child care
 
06:27:17.990 --> 06:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
facilities food service and food
 
06:27:20.190 --> 06:27:20.200 align:start position:0%
protection and then also Public Health
 
06:27:22.868 --> 06:27:22.878 align:start position:0%
disease prevention so that's sort of in
 
06:27:25.390 --> 06:27:25.400 align:start position:0%
a nutshell in terms of the functions of
 
06:27:27.948 --> 06:27:27.958 align:start position:0%
the department if you flip to the next
 
06:27:30.990 --> 06:27:31.000 align:start position:0%
slide on Slide Five I wanted to talk
 
06:27:32.590 --> 06:27:32.600 align:start position:0%
with you a little bit about our road map
 
06:27:34.788 --> 06:27:34.798 align:start position:0%
and why this is important when I became
 
06:27:36.948 --> 06:27:36.958 align:start position:0%
interim commissioner in
 
06:27:39.788 --> 06:27:39.798 align:start position:0%
22 uh we I didn't know how long I was
 
06:27:41.430 --> 06:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
going to last at that point so I said
 
06:27:43.910 --> 06:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
let's do a road map for a year uh what
 
06:27:45.948 --> 06:27:45.958 align:start position:0%
goals can we set what can we achieve and
 
06:27:48.230 --> 06:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
set a direction we were successful with
 
06:27:50.468 --> 06:27:50.478 align:start position:0%
that road map so in going into a budget
 
06:27:53.310 --> 06:27:53.320 align:start position:0%
year uh looking at again redetermining
 
06:27:55.750 --> 06:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
what those priorities were lifting some
 
06:27:57.390 --> 06:27:57.400 align:start position:0%
of the work that had not yet been
 
06:27:59.750 --> 06:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
completed in that prior road map working
 
06:28:01.468 --> 06:28:01.478 align:start position:0%
with our stakeholders and our partners
 
06:28:03.430 --> 06:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
and putting that into our road map for
 
06:28:06.590 --> 06:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
24 25 um it's
 
06:28:09.628 --> 06:28:09.638 align:start position:0%
really laying out you know what is our
 
06:28:11.628 --> 06:28:11.638 align:start position:0%
desired outcome what is our charge what
 
06:28:13.390 --> 06:28:13.400 align:start position:0%
is our mission what are our requirements
 
06:28:15.390 --> 06:28:15.400 align:start position:0%
what do the law requir us to do how are
 
06:28:16.708 --> 06:28:16.718 align:start position:0%
we going to do that when and when are we
 
06:28:18.430 --> 06:28:18.440 align:start position:0%
going to do that and how much money we
 
06:28:20.270 --> 06:28:20.280 align:start position:0%
need to do that um which is what we're
 
06:28:22.670 --> 06:28:22.680 align:start position:0%
here to talk a little bit about today
 
06:28:25.230 --> 06:28:25.240 align:start position:0%
there's three major components to it and
 
06:28:27.468 --> 06:28:27.478 align:start position:0%
I have it down here in the three Circles
 
06:28:29.788 --> 06:28:29.798 align:start position:0%
of culture community and service so
 
06:28:31.350 --> 06:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
culture is really about investing in
 
06:28:32.990 --> 06:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
people and culture if I don't have a
 
06:28:34.590 --> 06:28:34.600 align:start position:0%
Workforce at the department
 
06:28:36.590 --> 06:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
can car can carry forth the charge that
 
06:28:38.110 --> 06:28:38.120 align:start position:0%
I I can't be effect we can't be
 
06:28:40.468 --> 06:28:40.478 align:start position:0%
effective as a department so that isn't
 
06:28:42.468 --> 06:28:42.478 align:start position:0%
just Recruitment and Retention you know
 
06:28:44.190 --> 06:28:44.200 align:start position:0%
it's Workforce Development making sure
 
06:28:45.670 --> 06:28:45.680 align:start position:0%
that we have the right people in the
 
06:28:47.868 --> 06:28:47.878 align:start position:0%
right jobs specialized positions
 
06:28:51.030 --> 06:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
carrying out some pretty um intense uh
 
06:28:53.190 --> 06:28:53.200 align:start position:0%
tasks that we have to do because we have
 
06:28:55.350 --> 06:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
the gamut all the way from um
 
06:28:57.310 --> 06:28:57.320 align:start position:0%
administrative work down to direct care
 
06:29:00.468 --> 06:29:00.478 align:start position:0%
and working in hospitals and and um Glen
 
06:29:02.830 --> 06:29:02.840 align:start position:0%
Cliff as well uh Community promote
 
06:29:04.548 --> 06:29:04.558 align:start position:0%
thriving communities that's commitment
 
06:29:06.910 --> 06:29:06.920 align:start position:0%
number two that's the bulk of where our
 
06:29:09.190 --> 06:29:09.200 align:start position:0%
policy and program lies so you'll find
 
06:29:10.910 --> 06:29:10.920 align:start position:0%
things in there like Behavioral Health
 
06:29:13.708 --> 06:29:13.718 align:start position:0%
children system of care um our healthy
 
06:29:16.510 --> 06:29:16.520 align:start position:0%
system of care for aging uh maternal
 
06:29:19.230 --> 06:29:19.240 align:start position:0%
Health uh developmental disability uh
 
06:29:20.990 --> 06:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
strengthening and some of you may have
 
06:29:23.350 --> 06:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
heard about Mission zero which is uh our
 
06:29:25.628 --> 06:29:25.638 align:start position:0%
concerted effort to end Ed boarding all
 
06:29:27.310 --> 06:29:27.320 align:start position:0%
of that lies in there and becomes part
 
06:29:29.788 --> 06:29:29.798 align:start position:0%
of our Focus uh moving forward I just
 
06:29:31.788 --> 06:29:31.798 align:start position:0%
want to point out as well that it's it
 
06:29:34.628 --> 06:29:34.638 align:start position:0%
says road map 2425
 
06:29:35.990 --> 06:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
but really some of these goals are
 
06:29:37.628 --> 06:29:37.638 align:start position:0%
short-term some of them are midterm and
 
06:29:39.030 --> 06:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
some of them are longer term so we will
 
06:29:41.830 --> 06:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
lift some of them in subsequent years um
 
06:29:44.510 --> 06:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
the last bubble there is imp improving
 
06:29:47.030 --> 06:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
customer service so we have internal
 
06:29:48.948 --> 06:29:48.958 align:start position:0%
customers and we have external customers
 
06:29:52.030 --> 06:29:52.040 align:start position:0%
at the department we have a significant
 
06:29:54.430 --> 06:29:54.440 align:start position:0%
Reliance on our provider Community to do
 
06:29:56.390 --> 06:29:56.400 align:start position:0%
business with us so if it's hard to do
 
06:29:57.868 --> 06:29:57.878 align:start position:0%
business with the state we're not going
 
06:29:59.788 --> 06:29:59.798 align:start position:0%
to be successful at that so part of our
 
06:30:01.350 --> 06:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
commitment and pledge here is to try to
 
06:30:04.628 --> 06:30:04.638 align:start position:0%
make it easier um to uh get contracts
 
06:30:07.030 --> 06:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
provide the service get quality outcomes
 
06:30:09.430 --> 06:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
and quality measurements um as well as
 
06:30:11.548 --> 06:30:11.558 align:start position:0%
those that we serve so it's not just the
 
06:30:13.070 --> 06:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
partners and the providers it's the
 
06:30:16.670 --> 06:30:16.680 align:start position:0%
clients um and we have a a whole uh
 
06:30:18.868 --> 06:30:18.878 align:start position:0%
section on just basically being able to
 
06:30:20.628 --> 06:30:20.638 align:start position:0%
make it easier if you're receiving
 
06:30:22.510 --> 06:30:22.520 align:start position:0%
services from the Department who to call
 
06:30:25.750 --> 06:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
when to call how to call um it's it's
 
06:30:27.430 --> 06:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
difficult in a large organization and we
 
06:30:28.830 --> 06:30:28.840 align:start position:0%
want to make that easy for folks that
 
06:30:31.750 --> 06:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
are trying to get help um so this has
 
06:30:34.350 --> 06:30:34.360 align:start position:0%
this has become um a big part of our
 
06:30:36.110 --> 06:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
budget development as I was talking with
 
06:30:38.310 --> 06:30:38.320 align:start position:0%
some folks earlier in terms of tying
 
06:30:39.750 --> 06:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
some of what we're doing here to our
 
06:30:41.590 --> 06:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
budget priorities which you'll
 
06:30:44.548 --> 06:30:44.558 align:start position:0%
see uh flipping to the next page is
 
06:30:46.310 --> 06:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
really I'm just going to warn you this
 
06:30:49.468 --> 06:30:49.478 align:start position:0%
is not an org chart uh by any means it's
 
06:30:51.468 --> 06:30:51.478 align:start position:0%
it's really meant to show the breadth
 
06:30:53.628 --> 06:30:53.638 align:start position:0%
and the depth of the department and its
 
06:30:55.628 --> 06:30:55.638 align:start position:0%
entirety and sort of an easy way to
 
06:30:58.708 --> 06:30:58.718 align:start position:0%
digest HHS so if you're really look at
 
06:31:01.548 --> 06:31:01.558 align:start position:0%
the blue columns are sort of the the the
 
06:31:04.110 --> 06:31:04.120 align:start position:0%
main streams of population health Human
 
06:31:05.628 --> 06:31:05.638 align:start position:0%
Services and Behavioral Health and then
 
06:31:08.350 --> 06:31:08.360 align:start position:0%
our operations we have seven major
 
06:31:10.948 --> 06:31:10.958 align:start position:0%
divisions within the department um so
 
06:31:12.388 --> 06:31:12.398 align:start position:0%
you can see that we have the division of
 
06:31:14.910 --> 06:31:14.920 align:start position:0%
public health Medicaid children youth
 
06:31:17.388 --> 06:31:17.398 align:start position:0%
and families economic stability
 
06:31:19.548 --> 06:31:19.558 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health long-term supports and
 
06:31:22.030 --> 06:31:22.040 align:start position:0%
services and the division of finance
 
06:31:24.270 --> 06:31:24.280 align:start position:0%
that blue on the far right is really our
 
06:31:25.910 --> 06:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
operation support everything that
 
06:31:28.590 --> 06:31:28.600 align:start position:0%
supports the the two columns on the left
 
06:31:31.310 --> 06:31:31.320 align:start position:0%
so we obviously have an infrastructure
 
06:31:33.388 --> 06:31:33.398 align:start position:0%
uh with it and with HR and with
 
06:31:33.398 --> 06:31:34.388 align:start position:0%
uh with it and with HR and with
facilities

06:31:34.388 --> 06:31:34.398 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
06:31:36.110 --> 06:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
but we also have program quality
 
06:31:38.150 --> 06:31:38.160 align:start position:0%
Integrity which is monitoring all of
 
06:31:39.708 --> 06:31:39.718 align:start position:0%
those providers and making sure that
 
06:31:40.868 --> 06:31:40.878 align:start position:0%
they're delivering what they're supposed
 
06:31:42.030 --> 06:31:42.040 align:start position:0%
to be delivering and that we're getting
 
06:31:44.350 --> 06:31:44.360 align:start position:0%
the return on the investment um and we
 
06:31:46.350 --> 06:31:46.360 align:start position:0%
also have the employee assistance Pro
 
06:31:48.548 --> 06:31:48.558 align:start position:0%
program is housed within HHS some people
 
06:31:50.030 --> 06:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
may not know that serves all of the
 
06:31:53.388 --> 06:31:53.398 align:start position:0%
state agencies but um we we house that
 
06:31:56.910 --> 06:31:56.920 align:start position:0%
program host it um within the
 
06:32:00.270 --> 06:32:00.280 align:start position:0%
department and then the last box is not
 
06:32:01.830 --> 06:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
not the least but the last box is the
 
06:32:06.030 --> 06:32:06.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:07.990 --> 06:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
so flipping to the next slide I just a
 
06:32:10.430 --> 06:32:10.440 align:start position:0%
little bit of context in terms of where
 
06:32:12.150 --> 06:32:12.160 align:start position:0%
do we sit where does the Department of
 
06:32:13.948 --> 06:32:13.958 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services budgets sit
 
06:32:16.990 --> 06:32:17.000 align:start position:0%
within the bigger picture uh as many of
 
06:32:19.468 --> 06:32:19.478 align:start position:0%
you know it's uh more than half of the
 
06:32:22.830 --> 06:32:22.840 align:start position:0%
state budget um and we represent about a
 
06:32:24.868 --> 06:32:24.878 align:start position:0%
fourth of all state employees so I don't
 
06:32:26.628 --> 06:32:26.638 align:start position:0%
know Charlie what the latest is on the
 
06:32:28.990 --> 06:32:29.000 align:start position:0%
total of thousands of employees that we
 
06:32:31.070 --> 06:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
have uh but we're about about a quarter
 
06:32:33.628 --> 06:32:33.638 align:start position:0%
of that um and then our staffing cost
 
06:32:35.230 --> 06:32:35.240 align:start position:0%
just just to put this in perspective a
 
06:32:37.430 --> 06:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
little bit our staffing is really about
 
06:32:39.788 --> 06:32:39.798 align:start position:0%
11% of our budget so when we look at
 
06:32:42.270 --> 06:32:42.280 align:start position:0%
things like trying to save money through
 
06:32:44.430 --> 06:32:44.440 align:start position:0%
Staffing and personnel there isn't a lot
 
06:32:47.030 --> 06:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
of return on that um because it's only
 
06:32:49.910 --> 06:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
11% of our budget and I actually it's a
 
06:32:51.788 --> 06:32:51.798 align:start position:0%
good segue to the next slid really
 
06:32:54.070 --> 06:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
talking about Staffing so I've been with
 
06:32:56.270 --> 06:32:56.280 align:start position:0%
the Department about 27 years and I've
 
06:32:58.708 --> 06:32:58.718 align:start position:0%
been in different roles um when I first
 
06:33:00.708 --> 06:33:00.718 align:start position:0%
started I believe we had over
 
06:33:03.590 --> 06:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
3,400 positions and so you'll see here
 
06:33:05.430 --> 06:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
that we're at
 
06:33:09.310 --> 06:33:09.320 align:start position:0%
3248 but really I I I I actually only
 
06:33:11.990 --> 06:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
have about 2,800 filled I have a
 
06:33:15.628 --> 06:33:15.638 align:start position:0%
legislative cap of 3,000 um so I can't
 
06:33:18.150 --> 06:33:18.160 align:start position:0%
go above that um but what I want to
 
06:33:20.270 --> 06:33:20.280 align:start position:0%
point out is back in 2020 we had hiring
 
06:33:22.868 --> 06:33:22.878 align:start position:0%
frees with covid so we didn't fill a lot
 
06:33:25.548 --> 06:33:25.558 align:start position:0%
of positions that spilled over into back
 
06:33:29.430 --> 06:33:29.440 align:start position:0%
of the budget cuts for 22 and 23 where
 
06:33:32.788 --> 06:33:32.798 align:start position:0%
we gave 22.4 million back in Personnel
 
06:33:34.750 --> 06:33:34.760 align:start position:0%
costs so we weren't filling all of those
 
06:33:37.548 --> 06:33:37.558 align:start position:0%
positions and then back in uh December
 
06:33:37.558 --> 06:33:38.310 align:start position:0%
positions and then back in uh December
of

06:33:38.310 --> 06:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:33:41.708 --> 06:33:41.718 align:start position:0%
22 uh our vacancy rate was at
 
06:33:44.190 --> 06:33:44.200 align:start position:0%
22% so that that's a hit for the
 
06:33:45.788 --> 06:33:45.798 align:start position:0%
Department that's significant it's hard
 
06:33:48.750 --> 06:33:48.760 align:start position:0%
for us to get the work done and and have
 
06:33:50.590 --> 06:33:50.600 align:start position:0%
folks satisfied that are receiving
 
06:33:52.708 --> 06:33:52.718 align:start position:0%
services with us when we're down part of
 
06:33:54.468 --> 06:33:54.478 align:start position:0%
the pledge in the road map at that time
 
06:33:56.468 --> 06:33:56.478 align:start position:0%
was to get that vacancy rate down and
 
06:33:57.868 --> 06:33:57.878 align:start position:0%
today it's at
 
06:34:01.510 --> 06:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
14.9% so that's that's actually a great
 
06:34:04.590 --> 06:34:04.600 align:start position:0%
gain but the difference in 24 we did
 
06:34:06.750 --> 06:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
give back uh money but we were not
 
06:34:08.670 --> 06:34:08.680 align:start position:0%
restricted to keep it within Personnel
 
06:34:10.468 --> 06:34:10.478 align:start position:0%
lines so that really helped us a lot to
 
06:34:12.430 --> 06:34:12.440 align:start position:0%
be able to meet the back of the budget
 
06:34:14.948 --> 06:34:14.958 align:start position:0%
cut at that point of 23.6 million
 
06:34:17.150 --> 06:34:17.160 align:start position:0%
without having to cut into Personnel so
 
06:34:19.990 --> 06:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
it's made a difference so I I I say that
 
06:34:21.468 --> 06:34:21.478 align:start position:0%
because I don't I don't think there's a
 
06:34:24.430 --> 06:34:24.440 align:start position:0%
lot of fluff there and when we look at
 
06:34:26.910 --> 06:34:26.920 align:start position:0%
um our Direct Care Facilities cutting
 
06:34:29.190 --> 06:34:29.200 align:start position:0%
positions in those facilities means less
 
06:34:31.150 --> 06:34:31.160 align:start position:0%
Revenue because we have less beds filled
 
06:34:34.190 --> 06:34:34.200 align:start position:0%
so it's really it's really a delicate B
 
06:34:37.750 --> 06:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
um and balance of of meeting all of that
 
06:34:41.070 --> 06:34:41.080 align:start position:0%
so I think with that I'm going to turn
 
06:34:43.910 --> 06:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
it over to uh Chief Financial Officer
 
06:34:45.750 --> 06:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
Nathan white to talk about the details
 
06:34:47.910 --> 06:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
of some of the numbers thank you
 
06:34:50.230 --> 06:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner good afternoon governor
 
06:34:52.430 --> 06:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
elect aot members of the committee my
 
06:34:53.910 --> 06:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
name is naan white Chief Financial
 
06:34:56.110 --> 06:34:56.120 align:start position:0%
Officer and before we dig into the
 
06:34:57.830 --> 06:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
numbers uh one thing that I just want to
 
06:35:00.230 --> 06:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
acknowledge about the dhh budg budget is
 
06:35:02.548 --> 06:35:02.558 align:start position:0%
its complexity is it is large but it is
 
06:35:04.868 --> 06:35:04.878 align:start position:0%
explainable and there's a graph in front
 
06:35:07.190 --> 06:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
of you and you'll see three three
 
06:35:10.030 --> 06:35:10.040 align:start position:0%
bubbles there the budget cost allocation
 
06:35:12.468 --> 06:35:12.478 align:start position:0%
and the actual and so when we prepare
 
06:35:14.070 --> 06:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
our budget we prepared this budget back
 
06:35:16.830 --> 06:35:16.840 align:start position:0%
in August we make certain assumptions
 
06:35:18.750 --> 06:35:18.760 align:start position:0%
about the number of clients that we will
 
06:35:20.990 --> 06:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
serve and the and the costs resulting
 
06:35:24.230 --> 06:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
there from we also have the advantage um
 
06:35:26.070 --> 06:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
we have a a public assistance cost
 
06:35:28.628 --> 06:35:28.638 align:start position:0%
allocation system and we have over a 100
 
06:35:31.628 --> 06:35:31.638 align:start position:0%
Federal funding sources and we use that
 
06:35:34.110 --> 06:35:34.120 align:start position:0%
system to try to leverage Federal funds
 
06:35:36.548 --> 06:35:36.558 align:start position:0%
as much as possible and we recently
 
06:35:39.270 --> 06:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
implemented a uh a budget system to
 
06:35:40.990 --> 06:35:41.000 align:start position:0%
allow us to better identify federal
 
06:35:43.110 --> 06:35:43.120 align:start position:0%
funds and so some of some of the members
 
06:35:45.070 --> 06:35:45.080 align:start position:0%
on the committee probably remember in
 
06:35:47.750 --> 06:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
years past we've uh lapsed sign
 
06:35:49.468 --> 06:35:49.478 align:start position:0%
significant amounts of federal funds
 
06:35:52.350 --> 06:35:52.360 align:start position:0%
that we were unable to suspend to spend
 
06:35:54.430 --> 06:35:54.440 align:start position:0%
uh that did not happen this past year
 
06:35:56.310 --> 06:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
partly as a result of our ability to
 
06:35:59.468 --> 06:35:59.478 align:start position:0%
better identify track and budget for um
 
06:36:01.230 --> 06:36:01.240 align:start position:0%
the federal revenue and we've we've
 
06:36:02.948 --> 06:36:02.958 align:start position:0%
prepared this budget in accordance with
 
06:36:05.590 --> 06:36:05.600 align:start position:0%
that and to try to maximize the federal
 
06:36:07.590 --> 06:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
dollars that we have available and and
 
06:36:10.590 --> 06:36:10.600 align:start position:0%
decrease the general fund needs um I
 
06:36:14.270 --> 06:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
think it we also have a number of other
 
06:36:16.510 --> 06:36:16.520 align:start position:0%
Revenue sources which is a little unique
 
06:36:18.350 --> 06:36:18.360 align:start position:0%
to the department as the commissioner
 
06:36:20.468 --> 06:36:20.478 align:start position:0%
indicated we have a number of 247
 
06:36:23.230 --> 06:36:23.240 align:start position:0%
facilities where we generate Medicaid
 
06:36:24.990 --> 06:36:25.000 align:start position:0%
and third party insurance at New
 
06:36:27.868 --> 06:36:27.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital and uh Hamstead
 
06:36:29.310 --> 06:36:29.320 align:start position:0%
hospital and residential treatment
 
06:36:31.670 --> 06:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
facility and we make assumptions in our
 
06:36:34.590 --> 06:36:34.600 align:start position:0%
budget for those as uh you know as well
 
06:36:36.430 --> 06:36:36.440 align:start position:0%
is in the Medicaid Program which is an
 
06:36:39.388 --> 06:36:39.398 align:start position:0%
Actuarial based estimate and the reason
 
06:36:41.110 --> 06:36:41.120 align:start position:0%
that I that I want to point this out is
 
06:36:43.948 --> 06:36:43.958 align:start position:0%
because I I I want to uh just commit to
 
06:36:46.150 --> 06:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
working with the house the Senate the
 
06:36:48.150 --> 06:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
governor and everyone here as far as
 
06:36:50.150 --> 06:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
revising those numbers as we move
 
06:36:52.230 --> 06:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
through this process because we set we
 
06:36:54.948 --> 06:36:54.958 align:start position:0%
set our projections back in August and
 
06:36:56.430 --> 06:36:56.440 align:start position:0%
things will change throughout the year
 
06:36:57.948 --> 06:36:57.958 align:start position:0%
and I just kind of want to recognize the
 
06:37:00.110 --> 06:37:00.120 align:start position:0%
complexity of that uh and make a
 
06:37:02.830 --> 06:37:02.840 align:start position:0%
commitment to everyone in the room uh as
 
06:37:04.708 --> 06:37:04.718 align:start position:0%
far as our our commitment to work with
 
06:37:06.510 --> 06:37:06.520 align:start position:0%
anyone everyone on
 
06:37:09.310 --> 06:37:09.320 align:start position:0%
that moving on to the next slide on
 
06:37:11.910 --> 06:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
slide 10 so this is a very high level
 
06:37:14.548 --> 06:37:14.558 align:start position:0%
budget overview and the way that we're
 
06:37:15.910 --> 06:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
going to be going through this today is
 
06:37:17.230 --> 06:37:17.240 align:start position:0%
we're be going we're going to be going
 
06:37:19.070 --> 06:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
through the budget at the agency level
 
06:37:20.868 --> 06:37:20.878 align:start position:0%
just given the brevity of time that we
 
06:37:24.230 --> 06:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
have available um and below the below
 
06:37:26.030 --> 06:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
each agency you'll have an activity as
 
06:37:29.310 --> 06:37:29.320 align:start position:0%
well as accounts and we have uh hundreds
 
06:37:30.948 --> 06:37:30.958 align:start position:0%
of accounts and we certainly don't have
 
06:37:32.350 --> 06:37:32.360 align:start position:0%
all the time in the world today to go
 
06:37:34.788 --> 06:37:34.798 align:start position:0%
over that but if you if you draw your
 
06:37:38.190 --> 06:37:38.200 align:start position:0%
attention uh to the top box there on
 
06:37:41.670 --> 06:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
page 10 um the efficiency Target budget
 
06:37:45.070 --> 06:37:45.080 align:start position:0%
in state fiscal year 26 and 27 uh those
 
06:37:46.948 --> 06:37:46.958 align:start position:0%
were the targets that were provided to
 
06:37:49.868 --> 06:37:49.878 align:start position:0%
us uh from the governor's office um
 
06:37:51.868 --> 06:37:51.878 align:start position:0%
which we have achieved here we've also
 
06:37:53.310 --> 06:37:53.320 align:start position:0%
submitted which I'll be touching
 
06:37:57.830 --> 06:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
touching on about1 171 and $234 million
 
06:38:00.230 --> 06:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
of prioritized needs requests some of
 
06:38:02.548 --> 06:38:02.558 align:start position:0%
those requests are coming as a result of
 
06:38:04.150 --> 06:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
some federal changes some of those are
 
06:38:07.310 --> 06:38:07.320 align:start position:0%
resulting from uh legislatively directed
 
06:38:09.310 --> 06:38:09.320 align:start position:0%
rate studies as well just to put a
 
06:38:12.910 --> 06:38:12.920 align:start position:0%
little bit of context on those requests
 
06:38:14.868 --> 06:38:14.878 align:start position:0%
the total number of positions in the
 
06:38:17.670 --> 06:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
chart below there uh has remained flat
 
06:38:19.190 --> 06:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
you will see that there's a shift in
 
06:38:21.628 --> 06:38:21.638 align:start position:0%
unclassified to classified that's the
 
06:38:23.788 --> 06:38:23.798 align:start position:0%
result of some of the hb2 provisions
 
06:38:26.110 --> 06:38:26.120 align:start position:0%
from this past session where DCF
 
06:38:28.270 --> 06:38:28.280 align:start position:0%
attorneys and several Medicaid positions
 
06:38:31.030 --> 06:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
were converted from classified to
 
06:38:33.430 --> 06:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
unclassified positions based on
 
06:38:35.150 --> 06:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
directives from the division or direct
 
06:38:36.628 --> 06:38:36.638 align:start position:0%
or conversations with the division of
 
06:38:38.548 --> 06:38:38.558 align:start position:0%
Personnel in the Attorney General's
 
06:38:41.150 --> 06:38:41.160 align:start position:0%
office so rather than talking about the
 
06:38:43.548 --> 06:38:43.558 align:start position:0%
summary I'd like to move to slide 11 to
 
06:38:45.628 --> 06:38:45.638 align:start position:0%
start to dig into some of the details so
 
06:38:47.510 --> 06:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
agency 42 which is the division for
 
06:38:50.590 --> 06:38:50.600 align:start position:0%
children youth and families is the first
 
06:38:54.030 --> 06:38:54.040 align:start position:0%
area um to talk about here and just to
 
06:38:57.310 --> 06:38:57.320 align:start position:0%
just to orient uh everyone here relative
 
06:38:59.788 --> 06:38:59.798 align:start position:0%
to what we're looking at the second row
 
06:39:01.788 --> 06:39:01.798 align:start position:0%
you'll see General General funds as a
 
06:39:04.230 --> 06:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
percentage of the budget General funds
 
06:39:05.990 --> 06:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
obviously being the most critical uh
 
06:39:08.190 --> 06:39:08.200 align:start position:0%
here we we put that in there just to
 
06:39:09.590 --> 06:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
give everybody more of a visual
 
06:39:10.948 --> 06:39:10.958 align:start position:0%
perspective on what we're dealing with
 
06:39:12.910 --> 06:39:12.920 align:start position:0%
and what we're talking about and as I
 
06:39:15.468 --> 06:39:15.478 align:start position:0%
was referencing um in the opening slide
 
06:39:17.948 --> 06:39:17.958 align:start position:0%
of my section of the presentation many
 
06:39:20.548 --> 06:39:20.558 align:start position:0%
of our positions uh are funded by
 
06:39:23.510 --> 06:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
multiple funding sources some are 100%
 
06:39:25.548 --> 06:39:25.558 align:start position:0%
General funds and dcyf is an area where
 
06:39:28.070 --> 06:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
we do have more generally funded
 
06:39:30.430 --> 06:39:30.440 align:start position:0%
positions in other areas that you'll see
 
06:39:31.910 --> 06:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
such as the office of the commissioner
 
06:39:33.350 --> 06:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
we have positions that are funded
 
06:39:35.350 --> 06:39:35.360 align:start position:0%
through over a 100 different funding
 
06:39:37.788 --> 06:39:37.798 align:start position:0%
sources and so it's just important to
 
06:39:39.468 --> 06:39:39.478 align:start position:0%
remember as we move forward with this
 
06:39:42.830 --> 06:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
process that um sometimes it's it's not
 
06:39:45.590 --> 06:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
a one: one it's sometimes a more of a
 
06:39:48.030 --> 06:39:48.040 align:start position:0%
1/3 to 2/3 ratio depending on the
 
06:39:49.910 --> 06:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
position and the contract or expense
 
06:39:51.990 --> 06:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
that we're looking at so in the general
 
06:39:55.070 --> 06:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
fund row there you will see an increase
 
06:39:57.430 --> 06:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
and this the the increase here is the
 
06:39:59.910 --> 06:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
result of a couple of different
 
06:40:03.548 --> 06:40:03.558 align:start position:0%
things number one the syc
 
06:40:06.190 --> 06:40:06.200 align:start position:0%
spend in state fiscal year 24 and the
 
06:40:08.590 --> 06:40:08.600 align:start position:0%
current trends exceeded the existing
 
06:40:10.270 --> 06:40:10.280 align:start position:0%
budget and through the department-wide
 
06:40:12.270 --> 06:40:12.280 align:start position:0%
transfers we we do about three a year
 
06:40:14.910 --> 06:40:14.920 align:start position:0%
through the fiscal committee process um
 
06:40:16.510 --> 06:40:16.520 align:start position:0%
we did have to move several million
 
06:40:20.030 --> 06:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
dollars over to syc to cover costs to
 
06:40:22.868 --> 06:40:22.878 align:start position:0%
provide um the the services at that
 
06:40:26.350 --> 06:40:26.360 align:start position:0%
facility um accounting unit 2958 uh
 
06:40:29.230 --> 06:40:29.240 align:start position:0%
relative to to child protection for uh
 
06:40:32.030 --> 06:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
children in the care of the state um we
 
06:40:34.270 --> 06:40:34.280 align:start position:0%
have also experienc increased cost
 
06:40:36.350 --> 06:40:36.360 align:start position:0%
relative to the services uh and
 
06:40:38.190 --> 06:40:38.200 align:start position:0%
treatment needed for those children
 
06:40:40.270 --> 06:40:40.280 align:start position:0%
which is sort of another significant
 
06:40:44.510 --> 06:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
increase driver within that class
 
06:40:48.708 --> 06:40:48.718 align:start position:0%
line we we did submit uh related to that
 
06:40:51.388 --> 06:40:51.398 align:start position:0%
we did submit several prioritized needs
 
06:40:53.190 --> 06:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
um two of which are related to the
 
06:40:55.590 --> 06:40:55.600 align:start position:0%
system of care and some of the ongoing
 
06:40:57.990 --> 06:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
upgrades um and modifications to the
 
06:41:00.750 --> 06:41:00.760 align:start position:0%
existing system of care we we will
 
06:41:03.708 --> 06:41:03.718 align:start position:0%
experience a loss of Medicaid funds for
 
06:41:05.868 --> 06:41:05.878 align:start position:0%
children that are in residential
 
06:41:08.868 --> 06:41:08.878 align:start position:0%
facility uh centers of about more than
 
06:41:11.270 --> 06:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
16 beds come beginning in the state
 
06:41:13.628 --> 06:41:13.638 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 27 right now we're
 
06:41:16.230 --> 06:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
projecting that to be about 188 about an
 
06:41:19.628 --> 06:41:19.638 align:start position:0%
$18 million impact um we've also
 
06:41:23.070 --> 06:41:23.080 align:start position:0%
included a request uh for rate increases
 
06:41:25.070 --> 06:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
for the residential treatment providers
 
06:41:27.468 --> 06:41:27.478 align:start position:0%
as well of about approximately 9.1
 
06:41:31.110 --> 06:41:31.120 align:start position:0%
million um total funds and and that's
 
06:41:34.628 --> 06:41:34.638 align:start position:0%
about 66% General funds remainder being
 
06:41:36.868 --> 06:41:36.878 align:start position:0%
um federal
 
06:41:39.670 --> 06:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
dollars there were a number of pieces of
 
06:41:41.510 --> 06:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
legislation that came out of the state
 
06:41:44.230 --> 06:41:44.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 24 legislative session and
 
06:41:45.948 --> 06:41:45.958 align:start position:0%
we have included prioritized needs
 
06:41:48.230 --> 06:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
request here you will not see the
 
06:41:51.590 --> 06:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs um the positions
 
06:41:53.948 --> 06:41:53.958 align:start position:0%
included in this document here so it
 
06:41:57.270 --> 06:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
reflects the agency budget request and
 
06:41:59.910 --> 06:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
part of that is is the fact that the
 
06:42:02.150 --> 06:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
legislation passed and we did not have
 
06:42:03.910 --> 06:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
time to establish those positions so
 
06:42:07.070 --> 06:42:07.080 align:start position:0%
those do not show up here but s SP 463
 
06:42:10.110 --> 06:42:10.120 align:start position:0%
relative to court appointed uh Council
 
06:42:13.190 --> 06:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
um that that established 14 uh child
 
06:42:15.388 --> 06:42:15.398 align:start position:0%
protective Ser service worker positions
 
06:42:16.270 --> 06:42:16.280 align:start position:0%
s SP
 
06:42:18.830 --> 06:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
417 uh relative to Child Protection
 
06:42:20.510 --> 06:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
expanded the requirements and
 
06:42:23.310 --> 06:42:23.320 align:start position:0%
established an additional uh 12
 
06:42:26.350 --> 06:42:26.360 align:start position:0%
positions as well and then uh HP
 
06:42:29.350 --> 06:42:29.360 align:start position:0%
1598 uh special education expansion that
 
06:42:31.110 --> 06:42:31.120 align:start position:0%
expanded the age of special education
 
06:42:34.628 --> 06:42:34.638 align:start position:0%
from 21 to 22 uh the legislation had
 
06:42:36.230 --> 06:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
appropriated funds from the from the
 
06:42:37.788 --> 06:42:37.798 align:start position:0%
education trust fund account in the
 
06:42:40.230 --> 06:42:40.240 align:start position:0%
amount of $3 million we've continued
 
06:42:42.910 --> 06:42:42.920 align:start position:0%
that that practice here in our agency
 
06:42:44.830 --> 06:42:44.840 align:start position:0%
budget submission uh just to remain
 
06:42:47.788 --> 06:42:47.798 align:start position:0%
consistent with the original leg
 
06:42:51.868 --> 06:42:51.878 align:start position:0%
legislation moving on to page 12 this is
 
06:42:54.548 --> 06:42:54.558 align:start position:0%
agency 45 this is the division of
 
06:42:56.910 --> 06:42:56.920 align:start position:0%
economic stability um the division of
 
06:42:59.190 --> 06:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
economic stability provides a number of
 
06:43:02.750 --> 06:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
of key critical Services uh Child Care
 
06:43:05.830 --> 06:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
is included um within agency
 
06:43:10.628 --> 06:43:10.638 align:start position:0%
45 as well as um our eligibility uh team
 
06:43:12.628 --> 06:43:12.638 align:start position:0%
and our our family support
 
06:43:12.638 --> 06:43:14.430 align:start position:0%
and our our family support
Specialists

06:43:14.430 --> 06:43:14.440 align:start position:0%
Specialists
 
06:43:18.468 --> 06:43:18.478 align:start position:0%
and excuse me you will see that that
 
06:43:20.430 --> 06:43:20.440 align:start position:0%
overall the general funds compared to
 
06:43:23.350 --> 06:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
the adjusted authorized of 2025 are
 
06:43:26.190 --> 06:43:26.200 align:start position:0%
going down and part of that is due to
 
06:43:28.468 --> 06:43:28.478 align:start position:0%
cash assistance we we have been seeing a
 
06:43:30.548 --> 06:43:30.558 align:start position:0%
slow downward Trend in the amount of
 
06:43:34.110 --> 06:43:34.120 align:start position:0%
cash assistance um and as a result uh
 
06:43:35.910 --> 06:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
you you're you're seeing that reflected
 
06:43:39.230 --> 06:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
in the budget there related to
 
06:43:41.388 --> 06:43:41.398 align:start position:0%
eligibility uh we do have a number of
 
06:43:44.430 --> 06:43:44.440 align:start position:0%
requests to try to continue to enhance
 
06:43:46.230 --> 06:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
the operational efficiencies of the
 
06:43:48.910 --> 06:43:48.920 align:start position:0%
department and improve customer service
 
06:43:51.150 --> 06:43:51.160 align:start position:0%
and this is really important because it
 
06:43:54.708 --> 06:43:54.718 align:start position:0%
impacts anybody seeking uh to to qualify
 
06:43:57.150 --> 06:43:57.160 align:start position:0%
for Medicaid it impacts our nursing
 
06:43:59.990 --> 06:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
facilities and our other providers where
 
06:44:02.150 --> 06:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
when we have pending Medicaid claims and
 
06:44:04.548 --> 06:44:04.558 align:start position:0%
so we have a request to modernize
 
06:44:07.190 --> 06:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
eligibility Services as well as uh some
 
06:44:09.270 --> 06:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
improvements to multilanguage
 
06:44:11.990 --> 06:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
support the first prioritize need there
 
06:44:14.110 --> 06:44:14.120 align:start position:0%
at the top um during this past
 
06:44:17.388 --> 06:44:17.398 align:start position:0%
legislative session the budget included
 
06:44:19.830 --> 06:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
approximately a million dollar um to
 
06:44:22.628 --> 06:44:22.638 align:start position:0%
cover costs for an income eligibility
 
06:44:24.628 --> 06:44:24.638 align:start position:0%
system that the federal government is
 
06:44:26.868 --> 06:44:26.878 align:start position:0%
retiring and so those costs are now now
 
06:44:29.670 --> 06:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
need to be borne by the state uh and so
 
06:44:31.310 --> 06:44:31.320 align:start position:0%
we've we've submitted a request to
 
06:44:33.350 --> 06:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
continue that we've also submitted a
 
06:44:35.670 --> 06:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
request to continue the summer EBT that
 
06:44:39.150 --> 06:44:39.160 align:start position:0%
was approv that was acted into law via S
 
06:44:39.160 --> 06:44:39.990 align:start position:0%
was approv that was acted into law via S
SP

06:44:39.990 --> 06:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
SP
 
06:44:42.750 --> 06:44:42.760 align:start position:0%
499 and then uh consistent with the
 
06:44:46.030 --> 06:44:46.040 align:start position:0%
current banial um bium funding for the
 
06:44:47.830 --> 06:44:47.840 align:start position:0%
childcare Workforce fund we have
 
06:44:50.548 --> 06:44:50.558 align:start position:0%
included a total request of $15 million
 
06:44:53.388 --> 06:44:53.398 align:start position:0%
General funds uh for that purpose and
 
06:44:56.070 --> 06:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
that that's the same funding level uh
 
06:44:57.948 --> 06:44:57.958 align:start position:0%
consistent with the current
 
06:45:00.868 --> 06:45:00.878 align:start position:0%
bium the division of Medicaid services
 
06:45:04.388 --> 06:45:04.398 align:start position:0%
is on page 47 this is is agency
 
06:45:08.590 --> 06:45:08.600 align:start position:0%
47 um this this area is approximately
 
06:45:10.788 --> 06:45:10.798 align:start position:0%
it's a little over onethird of the
 
06:45:13.910 --> 06:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
entire budget um within the Medicaid
 
06:45:17.190 --> 06:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
Program uh we are able to leverage uh
 
06:45:20.628 --> 06:45:20.638 align:start position:0%
federal funds often referred to as as
 
06:45:24.510 --> 06:45:24.520 align:start position:0%
fmap um and and typically the the
 
06:45:27.070 --> 06:45:27.080 align:start position:0%
minimum amount is 50% however for chip
 
06:45:29.190 --> 06:45:29.200 align:start position:0%
and some other uh clients were able to
 
06:45:33.788 --> 06:45:33.798 align:start position:0%
leverage 65% or or other amounts
 
06:45:36.468 --> 06:45:36.478 align:start position:0%
um you will see a decrease in the
 
06:45:40.310 --> 06:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
general funds in this line and we we
 
06:45:42.310 --> 06:45:42.320 align:start position:0%
budgeted Medicaid based on the
 
06:45:43.910 --> 06:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
assumption that enrollment would
 
06:45:46.150 --> 06:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
continue around
 
06:45:49.990 --> 06:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
182,000 so uh many of you remember the
 
06:45:53.030 --> 06:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
um unwind process that we went through
 
06:45:54.868 --> 06:45:54.878 align:start position:0%
over the past couple of years that has
 
06:45:57.190 --> 06:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
been pretty much complete and over the
 
06:45:58.590 --> 06:45:58.600 align:start position:0%
uh ensuing months we've seen a
 
06:46:01.910 --> 06:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
relatively steady enrollment around
 
06:46:04.990 --> 06:46:05.000 align:start position:0%
182,000 which is what we base this on
 
06:46:06.750 --> 06:46:06.760 align:start position:0%
now you will see an increase in the
 
06:46:08.548 --> 06:46:08.558 align:start position:0%
other funds and the reason that you're
 
06:46:10.990 --> 06:46:11.000 align:start position:0%
seeing that is that that's uh as a
 
06:46:12.548 --> 06:46:12.558 align:start position:0%
result of the existing law and the
 
06:46:14.270 --> 06:46:14.280 align:start position:0%
directives that the department has been
 
06:46:19.070 --> 06:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
given relative to the U met dish um
 
06:46:21.548 --> 06:46:21.558 align:start position:0%
situation previously the distribution
 
06:46:24.670 --> 06:46:24.680 align:start position:0%
was approximately 91% we set this budget
 
06:46:27.070 --> 06:46:27.080 align:start position:0%
at 80% based on the existing law and the
 
06:46:29.670 --> 06:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
directives that we have uh received so
 
06:46:32.270 --> 06:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
far so that that is what you are seeing
 
06:46:34.590 --> 06:46:34.600 align:start position:0%
reflected within the Medicaid
 
06:46:38.110 --> 06:46:38.120 align:start position:0%
Budget on page 14 uh moving on to the
 
06:46:39.708 --> 06:46:39.718 align:start position:0%
vision of long-term supports and
 
06:46:42.708 --> 06:46:42.718 align:start position:0%
services this is agcy 48 I just want to
 
06:46:44.350 --> 06:46:44.360 align:start position:0%
make a note that uh the vision of
 
06:46:46.628 --> 06:46:46.638 align:start position:0%
long-term supports and services shows up
 
06:46:50.388 --> 06:46:50.398 align:start position:0%
in both agency 48 uh as well as agency
 
06:46:53.628 --> 06:46:53.638 align:start position:0%
92 in a few slides what you're looking
 
06:46:56.350 --> 06:46:56.360 align:start position:0%
at here um the services that are
 
06:46:58.590 --> 06:46:58.600 align:start position:0%
primarily provided that are provided out
 
06:47:00.830 --> 06:47:00.840 align:start position:0%
of this agency are the choices for
 
06:47:04.150 --> 06:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
Independence waiver program as well as
 
06:47:06.310 --> 06:47:06.320 align:start position:0%
the the nursing facility Medicaid
 
06:47:09.230 --> 06:47:09.240 align:start position:0%
payments those are those are two big um
 
06:47:12.430 --> 06:47:12.440 align:start position:0%
drivers here um both both of which come
 
06:47:15.110 --> 06:47:15.120 align:start position:0%
out of accounting unit 2152 which is
 
06:47:17.548 --> 06:47:17.558 align:start position:0%
certainly one of our larger accounting
 
06:47:20.388 --> 06:47:20.398 align:start position:0%
units um relative to the nursing
 
06:47:22.468 --> 06:47:22.478 align:start position:0%
facility payments the the department has
 
06:47:25.868 --> 06:47:25.878 align:start position:0%
experienced a significant increase in uh
 
06:47:27.628 --> 06:47:27.638 align:start position:0%
costs resulting from a number of
 
06:47:29.190 --> 06:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
different factors and we've had we
 
06:47:32.388 --> 06:47:32.398 align:start position:0%
transferred about $14.5 Million last
 
06:47:34.830 --> 06:47:34.840 align:start position:0%
year with fiscal committee approval uh
 
06:47:37.548 --> 06:47:37.558 align:start position:0%
we do have an item on the November on
 
06:47:39.548 --> 06:47:39.558 align:start position:0%
tomorrow's agenda to transfer an
 
06:47:41.310 --> 06:47:41.320 align:start position:0%
additional 10 million we anticipate
 
06:47:43.030 --> 06:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
additional millions of dollars being
 
06:47:45.750 --> 06:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
transferred for that purpose uh over the
 
06:47:48.788 --> 06:47:48.798 align:start position:0%
coming months and uh what you see here
 
06:47:50.468 --> 06:47:50.478 align:start position:0%
reflected in the Department's budget is
 
06:47:52.430 --> 06:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
just a recognition of those costs that
 
06:47:54.510 --> 06:47:54.520 align:start position:0%
have been pushed um that that the state
 
06:47:56.788 --> 06:47:56.798 align:start position:0%
is now picking up and we're having to
 
06:47:58.590 --> 06:47:58.600 align:start position:0%
transfer funds from other programs in
 
06:48:01.628 --> 06:48:01.638 align:start position:0%
order to continue those costs um we also
 
06:48:03.628 --> 06:48:03.638 align:start position:0%
do have an increase in the General funds
 
06:48:05.708 --> 06:48:05.718 align:start position:0%
there but we did assume approximately
 
06:48:08.548 --> 06:48:08.558 align:start position:0%
about a 7% utilization increase in
 
06:48:11.788 --> 06:48:11.798 align:start position:0%
nursing facility uh Medicaid payments
 
06:48:13.750 --> 06:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
and some of the challenges that we have
 
06:48:15.548 --> 06:48:15.558 align:start position:0%
experienced over this bium are the
 
06:48:18.230 --> 06:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
changes in ownership uh of the nursing
 
06:48:19.948 --> 06:48:19.958 align:start position:0%
facilities which have caused some
 
06:48:22.430 --> 06:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
instability as well as some back billing
 
06:48:24.750 --> 06:48:24.760 align:start position:0%
also resulting from that instability in
 
06:48:27.310 --> 06:48:27.320 align:start position:0%
the amount of I believe it was about $13
 
06:48:29.670 --> 06:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
million in the prior year and we are
 
06:48:31.948 --> 06:48:31.958 align:start position:0%
currently trending uh at a similar
 
06:48:34.510 --> 06:48:34.520 align:start position:0%
projection for this year if not
 
06:48:38.510 --> 06:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
higher um there was a required rate
 
06:48:40.510 --> 06:48:40.520 align:start position:0%
study and we've included a prioritized
 
06:48:42.948 --> 06:48:42.958 align:start position:0%
need here for that for choices for
 
06:48:45.310 --> 06:48:45.320 align:start position:0%
Independence and um that that's
 
06:48:48.788 --> 06:48:48.798 align:start position:0%
estimating about 8.5 and $8.6 million
 
06:48:51.830 --> 06:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
85% General funds uh for each year of
 
06:48:53.750 --> 06:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
the bium based off that legislative
 
06:48:56.948 --> 06:48:56.958 align:start position:0%
directed rat study um we have also
 
06:48:59.190 --> 06:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
included a request for congregate
 
06:49:01.110 --> 06:49:01.120 align:start position:0%
housing uh which was included in the
 
06:49:04.990 --> 06:49:05.000 align:start position:0%
current hb2 to continue that program as
 
06:49:08.788 --> 06:49:08.798 align:start position:0%
well on page 15 we move to the division
 
06:49:11.030 --> 06:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
of Public Health Services I think what's
 
06:49:12.310 --> 06:49:12.320 align:start position:0%
really important to understand about
 
06:49:13.948 --> 06:49:13.958 align:start position:0%
division of Public Health Services is
 
06:49:17.548 --> 06:49:17.558 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of little grants um that
 
06:49:19.350 --> 06:49:19.360 align:start position:0%
public health not little by any means
 
06:49:21.948 --> 06:49:21.958 align:start position:0%
but many grants that Public Health
 
06:49:24.230 --> 06:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
Services manages and so as a result of
 
06:49:26.110 --> 06:49:26.120 align:start position:0%
that you see a significantly lower
 
06:49:28.788 --> 06:49:28.798 align:start position:0%
amount of General funds the the $3
 
06:49:30.468 --> 06:49:30.478 align:start position:0%
million increase that you're actually
 
06:49:32.868 --> 06:49:32.878 align:start position:0%
seeing in the general funds there is is
 
06:49:34.990 --> 06:49:35.000 align:start position:0%
partly the result of us moving a $3
 
06:49:37.548 --> 06:49:37.558 align:start position:0%
million um Family Resource Center
 
06:49:40.270 --> 06:49:40.280 align:start position:0%
contract from DCF into the division of
 
06:49:42.868 --> 06:49:42.878 align:start position:0%
Public Health Services um which which
 
06:49:45.990 --> 06:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
explains uh a significant portion of of
 
06:49:49.030 --> 06:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
that increase that you do see there um
 
06:49:50.868 --> 06:49:50.878 align:start position:0%
the warehouse lease prioritized need we
 
06:49:52.708 --> 06:49:52.718 align:start position:0%
are in the process of consolidating the
 
06:49:54.990 --> 06:49:55.000 align:start position:0%
warehouse um which and we did not have
 
06:49:57.230 --> 06:49:57.240 align:start position:0%
this information uh fully vetted and
 
06:49:58.628 --> 06:49:58.638 align:start position:0%
available at the time that we submitted
 
06:50:00.310 --> 06:50:00.320 align:start position:0%
our agency budget and prepared it back
 
06:50:03.150 --> 06:50:03.160 align:start position:0%
in August but we do expect that to be
 
06:50:05.510 --> 06:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh at least at least about half of that
 
06:50:09.070 --> 06:50:09.080 align:start position:0%
amount um Bas based on the current work
 
06:50:11.750 --> 06:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
that that we are performing um you'll
 
06:50:13.270 --> 06:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
also see there are a variety of other
 
06:50:15.230 --> 06:50:15.240 align:start position:0%
funds here within the division of Public
 
06:50:17.070 --> 06:50:17.080 align:start position:0%
Health we have pharmaceutical rebates
 
06:50:18.350 --> 06:50:18.360 align:start position:0%
newborn screening
 
06:50:22.590 --> 06:50:22.600 align:start position:0%
radiological uh fees and vaccine insur
 
06:50:25.670 --> 06:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
income as well that that's reflected
 
06:50:29.388 --> 06:50:29.398 align:start position:0%
there moving on to slide 16 uh this is
 
06:50:31.830 --> 06:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
agency 91 this is the Glen Cliff home
 
06:50:33.750 --> 06:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
Glen Cliffe uh is located in the
 
06:50:35.510 --> 06:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
northern part of the state and provides
 
06:50:36.948 --> 06:50:36.958 align:start position:0%
geriatric and
 
06:50:40.510 --> 06:50:40.520 align:start position:0%
psychiatric um in inpatient
 
06:50:44.150 --> 06:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
Services um the a majority of Glen
 
06:50:46.230 --> 06:50:46.240 align:start position:0%
Cliff's budget is primarily Personnel
 
06:50:48.948 --> 06:50:48.958 align:start position:0%
it's about $18 million of personnel out
 
06:50:50.750 --> 06:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
of $21
 
06:50:53.270 --> 06:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
million um there are no prioritized
 
06:50:57.628 --> 06:50:57.638 align:start position:0%
needs requests here uh for this
 
06:51:00.070 --> 06:51:00.080 align:start position:0%
budget the division for Behavioral
 
06:51:04.910 --> 06:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
Health Agency 92 on page 17 um you will
 
06:51:08.868 --> 06:51:08.878 align:start position:0%
see it's it's approximately 50 55%
 
06:51:11.590 --> 06:51:11.600 align:start position:0%
General funds in both years of the
 
06:51:14.868 --> 06:51:14.878 align:start position:0%
efficiency budget um we have we have
 
06:51:16.548 --> 06:51:16.558 align:start position:0%
included a number of prioritized needs
 
06:51:19.388 --> 06:51:19.398 align:start position:0%
requests here as well the first of which
 
06:51:21.868 --> 06:51:21.878 align:start position:0%
is $5 million of General funds each year
 
06:51:24.388 --> 06:51:24.398 align:start position:0%
for the Community Mental Health Centers
 
06:51:26.788 --> 06:51:26.798 align:start position:0%
um to address some of the uh
 
06:51:28.868 --> 06:51:28.878 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care costs that they that
 
06:51:33.750 --> 06:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
they um continue to incur for the UN and
 
06:51:35.750 --> 06:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
underinsured uh We've also included a
 
06:51:37.670 --> 06:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs request for shelter
 
06:51:41.270 --> 06:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
care rates so SB um excuse me I can't
 
06:51:44.270 --> 06:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
remember the exact number uh chapter 290
 
06:51:46.830 --> 06:51:46.840 align:start position:0%
from the current banum uh appropriated
 
06:51:50.670 --> 06:51:50.680 align:start position:0%
$2.5 million uh for shelter care rates
 
06:51:53.110 --> 06:51:53.120 align:start position:0%
this if this were approved in each year
 
06:51:55.468 --> 06:51:55.478 align:start position:0%
it would continue uh that enhancement
 
06:51:57.350 --> 06:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
that the legislature approved this past
 
06:51:59.910 --> 06:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
session we've also included uh request
 
06:52:03.030 --> 06:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
for $500,000 for a 14 bed use shelter
 
06:52:04.270 --> 06:52:04.280 align:start position:0%
program in
 
06:52:06.868 --> 06:52:06.878 align:start position:0%
Manchester um and as well we've also
 
06:52:10.548 --> 06:52:10.558 align:start position:0%
included a uh a request for an increase
 
06:52:13.670 --> 06:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
to Guardianship Services um for those
 
06:52:15.350 --> 06:52:15.360 align:start position:0%
rates as
 
06:52:18.750 --> 06:52:18.760 align:start position:0%
well on page 18 uh this is the the
 
06:52:21.030 --> 06:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
vision for longterm long-term supports
 
06:52:22.670 --> 06:52:22.680 align:start position:0%
and Services I apologize I misspoke
 
06:52:26.910 --> 06:52:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:29.948 --> 06:52:29.958 align:start position:0%
93 within this accounting unit um or
 
06:52:31.548 --> 06:52:31.558 align:start position:0%
excuse me within this agency you have
 
06:52:33.468 --> 06:52:33.478 align:start position:0%
some of our larg accounting units
 
06:52:36.548 --> 06:52:36.558 align:start position:0%
relative to the to the DD services that
 
06:52:40.750 --> 06:52:40.760 align:start position:0%
we provide um accounting unit 7100 is a
 
06:52:43.708 --> 06:52:43.718 align:start position:0%
significant accounting unit um which
 
06:52:45.708 --> 06:52:45.718 align:start position:0%
accounts for a bulk of the cost that you
 
06:52:50.110 --> 06:52:50.120 align:start position:0%
do see within this area we prepared our
 
06:52:52.388 --> 06:52:52.398 align:start position:0%
budget to continue services to the
 
06:52:55.230 --> 06:52:55.240 align:start position:0%
individuals that uh within the DD
 
06:52:56.868 --> 06:52:56.878 align:start position:0%
Community the acquired brain disorder
 
06:52:59.990 --> 06:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
and inhome supports for children uh to
 
06:53:02.750 --> 06:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
continue those services today we've also
 
06:53:04.430 --> 06:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs
 
06:53:09.628 --> 06:53:09.638 align:start position:0%
requests um for DD ABD and IHS to uh
 
06:53:11.670 --> 06:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
project what the increased need would be
 
06:53:13.750 --> 06:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
for new individuals that would come into
 
06:53:17.150 --> 06:53:17.160 align:start position:0%
the system um and that's the current
 
06:53:19.030 --> 06:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
those were the current projections as of
 
06:53:20.750 --> 06:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
August again this is another area where
 
06:53:22.030 --> 06:53:22.040 align:start position:0%
we'd want to continue to work with
 
06:53:24.350 --> 06:53:24.360 align:start position:0%
everyone to refine those as needed to
 
06:53:28.468 --> 06:53:28.478 align:start position:0%
avoid uh a wa a waiting uh
 
06:53:32.230 --> 06:53:32.240 align:start position:0%
list and it is um it is a 50% match here
 
06:53:35.150 --> 06:53:35.160 align:start position:0%
it's 50% federal funds and 50% General
 
06:53:38.150 --> 06:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
funds the first prioritized need uh at
 
06:53:42.230 --> 06:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
the top of the uh lower table there uh
 
06:53:45.270 --> 06:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
there was a legislatively required rate
 
06:53:48.708 --> 06:53:48.718 align:start position:0%
study and the amount included here it's
 
06:53:51.350 --> 06:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
50/50 it would be 17.2 in state fiscal
 
06:53:55.230 --> 06:53:55.240 align:start position:0%
year 26 and $47 million in state fiscal
 
06:53:58.548 --> 06:53:58.558 align:start position:0%
year 27 and again it's
 
06:54:01.750 --> 06:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
5050 um if that were approved um
 
06:54:04.030 --> 06:54:04.040 align:start position:0%
relatedly there was legislation passed
 
06:54:06.310 --> 06:54:06.320 align:start position:0%
this past session that appropriated
 
06:54:09.910 --> 06:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
$500,000 for recreational activities um
 
06:54:13.070 --> 06:54:13.080 align:start position:0%
for individuals uh in the DD Community
 
06:54:15.350 --> 06:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
um we included a prioritized need here
 
06:54:18.750 --> 06:54:18.760 align:start position:0%
to continue that funding at at the same
 
06:54:22.590 --> 06:54:22.600 align:start position:0%
level the next slide uh on page 19 this
 
06:54:25.990 --> 06:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
is New Hampshire hospital agency 94 um
 
06:54:27.628 --> 06:54:27.638 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital provides uh
 
06:54:30.910 --> 06:54:30.920 align:start position:0%
Psychiatric Services for individuals um
 
06:54:33.030 --> 06:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
in Mental Health crisis
 
06:54:34.590 --> 06:54:34.600 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire hospital as I mentioned
 
06:54:36.548 --> 06:54:36.558 align:start position:0%
earlier uh it has a combination of
 
06:54:38.830 --> 06:54:38.840 align:start position:0%
general and other funds the other funds
 
06:54:41.868 --> 06:54:41.878 align:start position:0%
are uh billable services that the that
 
06:54:43.670 --> 06:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
the department receives we make certain
 
06:54:45.910 --> 06:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
assumptions based on historical uh
 
06:54:48.350 --> 06:54:48.360 align:start position:0%
census data and the revenue that we've
 
06:54:52.030 --> 06:54:52.040 align:start position:0%
been able to generate um when we
 
06:54:55.590 --> 06:54:55.600 align:start position:0%
prepared our budget here what is unique
 
06:54:58.110 --> 06:54:58.120 align:start position:0%
about this particular year or this
 
06:55:01.310 --> 06:55:01.320 align:start position:0%
particular bium is uh as many of you
 
06:55:03.788 --> 06:55:03.798 align:start position:0%
know we have been constructing and it is
 
06:55:06.310 --> 06:55:06.320 align:start position:0%
currently undergoing construction uh the
 
06:55:08.750 --> 06:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
addition of a high security unit uh
 
06:55:10.868 --> 06:55:10.878 align:start position:0%
typically historically we've referred to
 
06:55:13.230 --> 06:55:13.240 align:start position:0%
this as the forensic unit that is being
 
06:55:16.150 --> 06:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
built um as part of New Hampshire
 
06:55:19.788 --> 06:55:19.798 align:start position:0%
hospital and we prepare this budget with
 
06:55:22.590 --> 06:55:22.600 align:start position:0%
anticipating and planning for an opening
 
06:55:24.910 --> 06:55:24.920 align:start position:0%
date in the spring of State fiscal year
 
06:55:27.430 --> 06:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
27 so the amounts that you see in the
 
06:55:29.868 --> 06:55:29.878 align:start position:0%
prioritized need column second column
 
06:55:32.948 --> 06:55:32.958 align:start position:0%
from the right it's approximately 10 .4
 
06:55:35.270 --> 06:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
and approximately 120 positions there's
 
06:55:38.468 --> 06:55:38.478 align:start position:0%
one unclassified position included there
 
06:55:40.590 --> 06:55:40.600 align:start position:0%
um based on that opening date and that
 
06:55:43.190 --> 06:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
would allow us to hire staff in advance
 
06:55:46.430 --> 06:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
and train on uh train staff on the new
 
06:55:48.350 --> 06:55:48.360 align:start position:0%
policies and procedures relative to the
 
06:55:51.030 --> 06:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
high security
 
06:55:54.670 --> 06:55:54.680 align:start position:0%
unit okay moving on to slide 20 this is
 
06:55:57.270 --> 06:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
the office of the commissioner ageny 95
 
06:55:59.230 --> 06:55:59.240 align:start position:0%
as the commissioner was indicating
 
06:56:01.430 --> 06:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
earlier the office of the commissioner
 
06:56:03.310 --> 06:56:03.320 align:start position:0%
uh really encompass
 
06:56:06.910 --> 06:56:06.920 align:start position:0%
uh are legal are legal and Regulatory
 
06:56:10.910 --> 06:56:10.920 align:start position:0%

06:56:12.310 --> 06:56:12.320 align:start position:0%
our human
 
06:56:14.590 --> 06:56:14.600 align:start position:0%
resources uh as as well as some other
 
06:56:17.350 --> 06:56:17.360 align:start position:0%
supporting functions of the
 
06:56:22.150 --> 06:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:22.160 --> 06:56:24.230 align:start position:0%
 
Services

06:56:24.230 --> 06:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
Services
 
06:56:27.830 --> 06:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
um the there is there there is some
 
06:56:29.548 --> 06:56:29.558 align:start position:0%
there is some increase in the general
 
06:56:31.350 --> 06:56:31.360 align:start position:0%
fund needs here some of this is
 
06:56:34.110 --> 06:56:34.120 align:start position:0%
resulting from my and a lot of this is
 
06:56:36.510 --> 06:56:36.520 align:start position:0%
resulting uh from the N from the 10 and
 
06:56:39.110 --> 06:56:39.120 align:start position:0%
2% increase as well as the increase in
 
06:56:42.750 --> 06:56:42.760 align:start position:0%
benefits uh that the state has
 
06:56:45.110 --> 06:56:45.120 align:start position:0%
experienced many of these positions are
 
06:56:47.230 --> 06:56:47.240 align:start position:0%
funded from a multitude of funding
 
06:56:49.708 --> 06:56:49.718 align:start position:0%
sources because they are Central because
 
06:56:51.350 --> 06:56:51.360 align:start position:0%
they are Central to the department and
 
06:56:53.548 --> 06:56:53.558 align:start position:0%
support all of our divisions we're often
 
06:56:56.230 --> 06:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
able to take advantage of you know TF
 
06:56:59.750 --> 06:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
title 4E or whatever particular area um
 
06:57:01.190 --> 06:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
these these individuals and these
 
06:57:03.830 --> 06:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
positions uh may be working on there you
 
06:57:05.350 --> 06:57:05.360 align:start position:0%
will see an increase from the state
 
06:57:08.310 --> 06:57:08.320 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 25 to State fiscal year 26
 
06:57:10.948 --> 06:57:10.958 align:start position:0%
in the total FTE authorized position
 
06:57:14.190 --> 06:57:14.200 align:start position:0%
count two of those positions are the
 
06:57:16.590 --> 06:57:16.600 align:start position:0%
result of the hp2 language that was
 
06:57:19.190 --> 06:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
converting positions it it converted to
 
06:57:21.788 --> 06:57:21.798 align:start position:0%
full-time temporary positions uh that
 
06:57:23.670 --> 06:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
would otherwise not show up here and
 
06:57:25.590 --> 06:57:25.600 align:start position:0%
then there was an additional movement of
 
06:57:28.670 --> 06:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
one classified position into the office
 
06:57:29.628 --> 06:57:29.638 align:start position:0%
of the
 
06:57:32.830 --> 06:57:32.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner there are uh several
 
06:57:34.468 --> 06:57:34.478 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs requests in this area
 
06:57:37.548 --> 06:57:37.558 align:start position:0%
the first is SB resulting from s SP 463
 
06:57:39.948 --> 06:57:39.958 align:start position:0%
that established five new attorney
 
06:57:42.670 --> 06:57:42.680 align:start position:0%
positions uh we are requesting that we
 
06:57:44.628 --> 06:57:44.638 align:start position:0%
receive funding to continue
 
06:57:47.310 --> 06:57:47.320 align:start position:0%
those the second is continued support
 
06:57:49.868 --> 06:57:49.878 align:start position:0%
for some of our key it operational
 
06:57:51.388 --> 06:57:51.398 align:start position:0%
systems this include things like
 
06:57:55.868 --> 06:57:55.878 align:start position:0%
DocuSign that have improved um both the
 
06:57:57.948 --> 06:57:57.958 align:start position:0%
the internal processing as well as
 
06:58:00.708 --> 06:58:00.718 align:start position:0%
external processing and um speed and
 
06:58:02.388 --> 06:58:02.398 align:start position:0%
efficiency as well as a number of of
 
06:58:05.070 --> 06:58:05.080 align:start position:0%
other systems and then finally a
 
06:58:08.150 --> 06:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
replacement for the existing laptops and
 
06:58:11.590 --> 06:58:11.600 align:start position:0%
accessories is also included there the
 
06:58:13.868 --> 06:58:13.878 align:start position:0%
final slide is agency 48 this is
 
06:58:15.750 --> 06:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
Hamstead Hospital Residential Treatment
 
06:58:19.388 --> 06:58:19.398 align:start position:0%
Facility as many of you um recall back
 
06:58:22.468 --> 06:58:22.478 align:start position:0%
in June of 22 uh the department and
 
06:58:24.830 --> 06:58:24.840 align:start position:0%
state acquired Hamstead hospital and
 
06:58:27.030 --> 06:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
residential treatment facility when we
 
06:58:28.990 --> 06:58:29.000 align:start position:0%
prepared our budget for the current bium
 
06:58:31.510 --> 06:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
we did not have uh a significant amount
 
06:58:34.230 --> 06:58:34.240 align:start position:0%
of data to work from to make those
 
06:58:37.070 --> 06:58:37.080 align:start position:0%
projections what we have experienced
 
06:58:39.430 --> 06:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
ended up being different than what our
 
06:58:41.070 --> 06:58:41.080 align:start position:0%
initial projections were and we've had
 
06:58:43.628 --> 06:58:43.638 align:start position:0%
to use other funds to supplant or not to
 
06:58:46.708 --> 06:58:46.718 align:start position:0%
supplant to support the facility um for
 
06:58:49.388 --> 06:58:49.398 align:start position:0%
the prior for the prior year and we will
 
06:58:52.270 --> 06:58:52.280 align:start position:0%
need to do so for this year as well
 
06:58:54.110 --> 06:58:54.120 align:start position:0%
based on the census numbers similar to
 
06:58:56.070 --> 06:58:56.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital Hamstead
 
06:58:58.750 --> 06:58:58.760 align:start position:0%
generates revenue from third party
 
06:59:02.548 --> 06:59:02.558 align:start position:0%
paays and
 
06:59:04.350 --> 06:59:04.360 align:start position:0%
that that accounts for the significant
 
06:59:06.230 --> 06:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
increase that you do see there in the
 
06:59:08.270 --> 06:59:08.280 align:start position:0%
general funds and this this is this
 
06:59:09.750 --> 06:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
assumes that there's a
 
06:59:15.388 --> 06:59:15.398 align:start position:0%
35 um a 35 um individual census however
 
06:59:17.910 --> 06:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
we did recently enter into a new
 
06:59:21.270 --> 06:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
contract with a new provider in July and
 
06:59:24.190 --> 06:59:24.200 align:start position:0%
we are um we will continue to monitor
 
06:59:26.670 --> 06:59:26.680 align:start position:0%
what we expect the census to be so far
 
06:59:28.628 --> 06:59:28.638 align:start position:0%
things are looking good and we're hoping
 
06:59:31.150 --> 06:59:31.160 align:start position:0%
to generate more Revenue to offset that
 
06:59:32.670 --> 06:59:32.680 align:start position:0%
need and this is just another one of
 
06:59:34.190 --> 06:59:34.200 align:start position:0%
those areas where I just want to
 
06:59:36.270 --> 06:59:36.280 align:start position:0%
continue to work with everybody here as
 
06:59:38.830 --> 06:59:38.840 align:start position:0%
we move forward uh through the budget
 
06:59:41.910 --> 06:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
process um there is uh there are two
 
06:59:43.270 --> 06:59:43.280 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs requests that I just
 
06:59:45.350 --> 06:59:45.360 align:start position:0%
want to call attention to the first
 
06:59:48.350 --> 06:59:48.360 align:start position:0%
being a payment to the town of Hamstead
 
06:59:50.270 --> 06:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
uh we have made a payment to the town of
 
06:59:53.750 --> 06:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
Hamstead for the um past several State
 
06:59:57.510 --> 06:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal years as a result of the loss of
 
07:00:00.628 --> 07:00:00.638 align:start position:0%
property tax revenue that the town has
 
07:00:03.708 --> 07:00:03.718 align:start position:0%
experienced um we have also submitted a
 
07:00:05.830 --> 07:00:05.840 align:start position:0%
request for funding for a kitchen
 
07:00:10.110 --> 07:00:10.120 align:start position:0%
upgrade the YDC the future YDC is being
 
07:00:12.788 --> 07:00:12.798 align:start position:0%
built adjacent on the same property at
 
07:00:15.230 --> 07:00:15.240 align:start position:0%
Hamstead and this would be upgrades to
 
07:00:17.310 --> 07:00:17.320 align:start position:0%
that kitchen to allowed for shared
 
07:00:19.830 --> 07:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
services out of one facility rather than
 
07:00:22.708 --> 07:00:22.718 align:start position:0%
duplicate uh kitchens in both facilities
 
07:00:26.510 --> 07:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
that are uh adjacent to each other so
 
07:00:29.990 --> 07:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
with that um I will pause there for
 
07:00:30.000 --> 07:00:33.670 align:start position:0%
with that um I will pause there for
questions

07:00:33.670 --> 07:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:33.680 --> 07:00:35.230 align:start position:0%
 
thank

07:00:35.230 --> 07:00:35.240 align:start position:0%
thank
 
07:00:38.510 --> 07:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
you HHS has a significant number of of
 
07:00:41.230 --> 07:00:41.240 align:start position:0%
contracts that I'm guessing are worth
 
07:00:43.708 --> 07:00:43.718 align:start position:0%
hundreds of millions of dollars over a
 
07:00:46.350 --> 07:00:46.360 align:start position:0%
banum how do you know what sort of
 
07:00:48.708 --> 07:00:48.718 align:start position:0%
return you're getting on those contracts
 
07:00:50.590 --> 07:00:50.600 align:start position:0%
uh what what metrics do you use to
 
07:00:52.270 --> 07:00:52.280 align:start position:0%
measure them I mean do you do after
 
07:00:54.388 --> 07:00:54.398 align:start position:0%
action reports like here's what we spent
 
07:00:55.590 --> 07:00:55.600 align:start position:0%
here's what we were looking for here's
 
07:00:57.628 --> 07:00:57.638 align:start position:0%
what we got and is there anything you
 
07:00:59.628 --> 07:00:59.638 align:start position:0%
can share on those contracts with with
 
07:01:01.310 --> 07:01:01.320 align:start position:0%
the governor's office and the transition
 
07:01:01.320 --> 07:01:04.750 align:start position:0%
the governor's office and the transition
team

07:01:04.750 --> 07:01:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:06.548 --> 07:01:06.558 align:start position:0%
so I would draw your attention back to
 
07:01:09.150 --> 07:01:09.160 align:start position:0%
that slide uh in the operations section
 
07:01:11.190 --> 07:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
I have a whole division of quality
 
07:01:12.910 --> 07:01:12.920 align:start position:0%
improvement integrity and part of their
 
07:01:15.070 --> 07:01:15.080 align:start position:0%
job is we look especially at the
 
07:01:18.270 --> 07:01:18.280 align:start position:0%
high-risk contracts as well so want to
 
07:01:19.910 --> 07:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
make sure that they can sustain but
 
07:01:21.708 --> 07:01:21.718 align:start position:0%
always on the return on investment and
 
07:01:23.628 --> 07:01:23.638 align:start position:0%
the quality of care that we're getting
 
07:01:25.708 --> 07:01:25.718 align:start position:0%
so we do that uh through we have
 
07:01:27.350 --> 07:01:27.360 align:start position:0%
contract management we have contract
 
07:01:29.110 --> 07:01:29.120 align:start position:0%
monitoring are we getting what we paid
 
07:01:30.628 --> 07:01:30.638 align:start position:0%
for are we getting that outcome that we
 
07:01:33.788 --> 07:01:33.798 align:start position:0%
set out to get um so there's a lot of um
 
07:01:37.628 --> 07:01:37.638 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of uh eyes on the total uh
 
07:01:39.310 --> 07:01:39.320 align:start position:0%
number of contracts that are going
 
07:01:41.310 --> 07:01:41.320 align:start position:0%
forward so from inception that the time
 
07:01:43.430 --> 07:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
that they're created through the time
 
07:01:45.670 --> 07:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
that they're going and then through the
 
07:01:47.310 --> 07:01:47.320 align:start position:0%
time that they're up for Renewal or for
 
07:01:49.030 --> 07:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
an amendment to do it again we go back
 
07:01:51.628 --> 07:01:51.638 align:start position:0%
to that data so though that particular
 
07:01:53.548 --> 07:01:53.558 align:start position:0%
progam uh division works with the
 
07:01:55.708 --> 07:01:55.718 align:start position:0%
program areas to look at different
 
07:01:57.750 --> 07:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
reports different measurements so we
 
07:02:00.788 --> 07:02:00.798 align:start position:0%
have over a thousand contracts I mean I
 
07:02:02.628 --> 07:02:02.638 align:start position:0%
I could inundate the governor's office
 
07:02:04.750 --> 07:02:04.760 align:start position:0%
with that um if you wanted or we could
 
07:02:06.270 --> 07:02:06.280 align:start position:0%
parse that out if you wanted to look at
 
07:02:07.708 --> 07:02:07.718 align:start position:0%
the biggest contracts like you look at
 
07:02:09.868 --> 07:02:09.878 align:start position:0%
our MCO contracts obviously our biggest
 
07:02:11.548 --> 07:02:11.558 align:start position:0%
contracts we have a lot of quality
 
07:02:13.948 --> 07:02:13.958 align:start position:0%
control on that as well yeah I think
 
07:02:15.190 --> 07:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
that would be something we're interested
 
07:02:16.910 --> 07:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
in and I I would start with the biggest
 
07:02:18.830 --> 07:02:18.840 align:start position:0%
contracts then we can move down until we
 
07:02:22.110 --> 07:02:22.120 align:start position:0%
give up yeah so okay my my next question
 
07:02:24.990 --> 07:02:25.000 align:start position:0%
um I I saw an additional prioritized
 
07:02:26.388 --> 07:02:26.398 align:start position:0%
need for the Community Mental Health
 
07:02:30.310 --> 07:02:30.320 align:start position:0%
Centers and I know we uh allocated some
 
07:02:32.990 --> 07:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
arpa money for those and and it was my
 
07:02:34.948 --> 07:02:34.958 align:start position:0%
understanding that the idea that was it
 
07:02:38.548 --> 07:02:38.558 align:start position:0%
was a a bridge financing uh after the
 
07:02:39.830 --> 07:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
state of emergency ended and the
 
07:02:43.868 --> 07:02:43.878 align:start position:0%
Medicaid roles were were purged that the
 
07:02:45.388 --> 07:02:45.398 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Centers among
 
07:02:47.350 --> 07:02:47.360 align:start position:0%
others having a difficult time because a
 
07:02:49.150 --> 07:02:49.160 align:start position:0%
lot of people who were getting Medicaid
 
07:02:51.070 --> 07:02:51.080 align:start position:0%
no longer were but they still had to
 
07:02:53.190 --> 07:02:53.200 align:start position:0%
treat them but my understanding was it
 
07:02:54.788 --> 07:02:54.798 align:start position:0%
was just that bridge loan and they would
 
07:02:57.110 --> 07:02:57.120 align:start position:0%
not be coming back for additional money
 
07:02:59.590 --> 07:02:59.600 align:start position:0%
is that no longer the case they're we're
 
07:03:01.030 --> 07:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
coming back I I think the issue of
 
07:03:03.750 --> 07:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care remains so that that
 
07:03:06.388 --> 07:03:06.398 align:start position:0%
was a one time to fill that Gap but when
 
07:03:09.310 --> 07:03:09.320 align:start position:0%
we look at um their mandate and their
 
07:03:11.430 --> 07:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
requirement is to serve all so they
 
07:03:13.910 --> 07:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
can't necessarily turn anybody away so
 
07:03:15.430 --> 07:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
when we look at the numbers of
 
07:03:18.350 --> 07:03:18.360 align:start position:0%
utilization it's still pretty high so we
 
07:03:20.788 --> 07:03:20.798 align:start position:0%
based our prioritized need on what we
 
07:03:22.230 --> 07:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
had given them it's not even going to
 
07:03:25.310 --> 07:03:25.320 align:start position:0%
come close to what their actual need is
 
07:03:28.788 --> 07:03:28.798 align:start position:0%
but we base it off of what we had given
 
07:03:37.788 --> 07:03:37.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:42.310 --> 07:03:42.320 align:start position:0%
yes you may uh thank you um so good
 
07:03:47.350 --> 07:03:47.360 align:start position:0%
seeing you both on on uh page 11 I I is
 
07:03:47.360 --> 07:03:48.230 align:start position:0%
seeing you both on on uh page 11 I I is
the

07:03:48.230 --> 07:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:03:53.430 --> 07:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
YDC uh included somehow on page 11 uh
 
07:03:57.350 --> 07:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
and and if it is um I I I think I've
 
07:03:59.350 --> 07:03:59.360 align:start position:0%
seen some preliminary numbers that
 
07:04:02.468 --> 07:04:02.478 align:start position:0%
suggest that going from about 13 million
 
07:04:05.270 --> 07:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
a year historically at the sununu Youth
 
07:04:07.670 --> 07:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
Development Center that you you all are
 
07:04:09.510 --> 07:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
projecting a $19
 
07:04:13.030 --> 07:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
million uh requirement and and part of
 
07:04:15.110 --> 07:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
our thinking when we built the new
 
07:04:16.910 --> 07:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
facility was we were going to reduce
 
07:04:20.030 --> 07:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
operating costs not double them or
 
07:04:22.590 --> 07:04:22.600 align:start position:0%
increase them by 50% could could you
 
07:04:25.270 --> 07:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
talk about that a little
 
07:04:28.190 --> 07:04:28.200 align:start position:0%
sure on page 11 um within the division
 
07:04:31.070 --> 07:04:31.080 align:start position:0%
of children youth and families um s
 
07:04:33.548 --> 07:04:33.558 align:start position:0%
youth service Center is included in that
 
07:04:33.558 --> 07:04:34.628 align:start position:0%
youth service Center is included in that
total

07:04:34.628 --> 07:04:34.638 align:start position:0%
total
 
07:04:37.510 --> 07:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
agency uh 42 that you're looking at
 
07:04:40.990 --> 07:04:41.000 align:start position:0%
there um the and and you are correct in
 
07:04:43.350 --> 07:04:43.360 align:start position:0%
the the numbers that you were providing
 
07:04:47.070 --> 07:04:47.080 align:start position:0%
the reason there's there's kind of a
 
07:04:49.788 --> 07:04:49.798 align:start position:0%
couple of reasons for why you're seeing
 
07:04:49.798 --> 07:04:50.910 align:start position:0%
couple of reasons for why you're seeing
that

07:04:50.910 --> 07:04:50.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:04:53.830 --> 07:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
increase as many of you recall there was
 
07:04:57.310 --> 07:04:57.320 align:start position:0%
legislation previously to close uh
 
07:05:01.310 --> 07:05:01.320 align:start position:0%
syc that legislation included uh an
 
07:05:01.320 --> 07:05:02.230 align:start position:0%
syc that legislation included uh an
assum

07:05:02.230 --> 07:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
assum
 
07:05:05.468 --> 07:05:05.478 align:start position:0%
budget that that provided for the
 
07:05:08.270 --> 07:05:08.280 align:start position:0%
closure for this current bium and
 
07:05:10.468 --> 07:05:10.478 align:start position:0%
through the last budget process uh we
 
07:05:13.190 --> 07:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
did not um based on our initial request
 
07:05:16.270 --> 07:05:16.280 align:start position:0%
we did not receive sufficient funding to
 
07:05:19.150 --> 07:05:19.160 align:start position:0%
cover the operating costs so as a result
 
07:05:21.070 --> 07:05:21.080 align:start position:0%
of that you've seen at fiscal committee
 
07:05:22.910 --> 07:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
a couple of Department wide transfer
 
07:05:25.270 --> 07:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
where we've had to move money over
 
07:05:26.750 --> 07:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
initially it was to cover a lot of the
 
07:05:29.190 --> 07:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
overtime costs CU we we lost I think
 
07:05:32.468 --> 07:05:32.478 align:start position:0%
we're 33 or more perent vacant for our
 
07:05:34.750 --> 07:05:34.760 align:start position:0%
youth counselors at the facility so we
 
07:05:36.230 --> 07:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
went through a period of
 
07:05:38.708 --> 07:05:38.718 align:start position:0%
stabilization um currently we are moving
 
07:05:40.708 --> 07:05:40.718 align:start position:0%
towards hiring more and more youth
 
07:05:43.468 --> 07:05:43.478 align:start position:0%
counselors at the facility and providing
 
07:05:46.230 --> 07:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
better um care and services to stabilize
 
07:05:48.830 --> 07:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
that now for the next state fiscal year
 
07:05:52.270 --> 07:05:52.280 align:start position:0%
26 and 27 it would be in the second year
 
07:05:54.590 --> 07:05:54.600 align:start position:0%
that we'd be moving in towards that
 
07:05:57.110 --> 07:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
transition there is a team a project
 
07:05:59.350 --> 07:05:59.360 align:start position:0%
team that uh of probably well over a
 
07:06:01.070 --> 07:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
dozen people that have been working on
 
07:06:04.030 --> 07:06:04.040 align:start position:0%
those trans ition numbers uh to kind of
 
07:06:06.110 --> 07:06:06.120 align:start position:0%
to to determine and understand what the
 
07:06:08.990 --> 07:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
new facility operations would will look
 
07:06:11.230 --> 07:06:11.240 align:start position:0%
like um when we submitted our budget
 
07:06:13.590 --> 07:06:13.600 align:start position:0%
back in August all of those details had
 
07:06:15.948 --> 07:06:15.958 align:start position:0%
not yet been sorted out so we wanted to
 
07:06:17.548 --> 07:06:17.558 align:start position:0%
make sure that we take a conservative
 
07:06:20.430 --> 07:06:20.440 align:start position:0%
approach initially until we make until
 
07:06:22.590 --> 07:06:22.600 align:start position:0%
we're able to make a deter an accurate
 
07:06:25.350 --> 07:06:25.360 align:start position:0%
and reliable determination on what those
 
07:06:27.788 --> 07:06:27.798 align:start position:0%
new needs would be so I'll pause there
 
07:06:35.910 --> 07:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:38.510 --> 07:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
okay so in a thank you for that in in a
 
07:06:42.670 --> 07:06:42.680 align:start position:0%
similar vein um on page 19 dealing with
 
07:06:45.430 --> 07:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
the uh secure forensic hospital and the
 
07:06:47.708 --> 07:06:47.718 align:start position:0%
Staffing that's required in the uh
 
07:06:50.510 --> 07:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
second year you've got that listed as a
 
07:06:54.310 --> 07:06:54.320 align:start position:0%
prioritized need and and that's probably
 
07:06:57.070 --> 07:06:57.080 align:start position:0%
some budgetary guideline that you had to
 
07:06:59.430 --> 07:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
follow to to to carry it as a
 
07:07:03.230 --> 07:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
prioritized need but but but shouldn't
 
07:07:06.150 --> 07:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we be viewing that as as a
 
07:07:09.750 --> 07:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
required amount of spend because if we
 
07:07:11.868 --> 07:07:11.878 align:start position:0%
build this new facility we will have to
 
07:07:14.468 --> 07:07:14.478 align:start position:0%
staff it and train it and and so having
 
07:07:17.190 --> 07:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
it dangle as a prioritized need doesn't
 
07:07:20.510 --> 07:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
really represent it accurately does
 
07:07:23.910 --> 07:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
it so the way that we prepared this
 
07:07:25.868 --> 07:07:25.878 align:start position:0%
budget uh was based on our
 
07:07:28.590 --> 07:07:28.600 align:start position:0%
interpretation of RSA 94 which provides
 
07:07:30.590 --> 07:07:30.600 align:start position:0%
for the efficiency expenditure requests
 
07:07:33.388 --> 07:07:33.398 align:start position:0%
which is the cost to continue to provide
 
07:07:36.270 --> 07:07:36.280 align:start position:0%
services uh as they are today and then
 
07:07:37.990 --> 07:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
the prioritized needs and additional
 
07:07:39.750 --> 07:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
problematic needs I believe this house
 
07:07:42.190 --> 07:07:42.200 align:start position:0%
defined in statute is things above and
 
07:07:44.468 --> 07:07:44.478 align:start position:0%
beyond that so that that's why we
 
07:07:47.468 --> 07:07:47.478 align:start position:0%
prepare it the way um we did based on
 
07:07:49.830 --> 07:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
our our interpretation of of the law and
 
07:07:49.840 --> 07:07:53.548 align:start position:0%
our our interpretation of of the law and
the

07:07:53.548 --> 07:07:53.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:53.558 --> 07:07:55.830 align:start position:0%
 
guidelines

07:07:55.830 --> 07:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
07:07:58.110 --> 07:07:58.120 align:start position:0%
May um
 
07:08:00.788 --> 07:08:00.798 align:start position:0%
hi um thanks for being at the end um
 
07:08:05.150 --> 07:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
you're like to boo um in a nice way um
 
07:08:08.190 --> 07:08:08.200 align:start position:0%
DD weight list um am I right in assuming
 
07:08:10.548 --> 07:08:10.558 align:start position:0%
there's no DD weight list right now or
 
07:08:12.868 --> 07:08:12.878 align:start position:0%
essentially none did you say Ed weight
 
07:08:15.230 --> 07:08:15.240 align:start position:0%
list I'm sorry DD developmental disab DD
 
07:08:16.750 --> 07:08:16.760 align:start position:0%
weight list those are two different
 
07:08:19.110 --> 07:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
things yes there's no weight list um and
 
07:08:21.910 --> 07:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
with your with your current in the
 
07:08:23.548 --> 07:08:23.558 align:start position:0%
efficiency budget if we just said the
 
07:08:26.628 --> 07:08:26.638 align:start position:0%
efficiency budget hey go ahead um not
 
07:08:29.150 --> 07:08:29.160 align:start position:0%
enough to fund there would be a weight
 
07:08:33.468 --> 07:08:33.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:35.430 --> 07:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
I'm looking behind you actually I'm
 
07:08:37.110 --> 07:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
watching her nod her head and bounce it
 
07:08:48.948 --> 07:08:48.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:51.110 --> 07:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
forth I know you I know you probably
 
07:08:53.708 --> 07:08:53.718 align:start position:0%
can't say exactly but yeah um this is
 
07:08:56.628 --> 07:08:56.638 align:start position:0%
Chris sanella associate commissioner um
 
07:08:58.510 --> 07:08:58.520 align:start position:0%
I I would say
 
07:09:01.990 --> 07:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
approximately 2 to 500 adult
 
07:09:04.030 --> 07:09:04.040 align:start position:0%
I don't have that number but I can get
 
07:09:05.948 --> 07:09:05.958 align:start position:0%
that number for you that's how many
 
07:09:08.388 --> 07:09:08.398 align:start position:0%
would end up on a wait list what are we
 
07:09:10.150 --> 07:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
how many are we serving today ballpark
 
07:09:14.510 --> 07:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
there's about um 4,000 people ballpark
 
07:09:18.788 --> 07:09:18.798 align:start position:0%
on the waiver on the DD waiver and so
 
07:09:21.030 --> 07:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
and and
 
07:09:23.230 --> 07:09:23.240 align:start position:0%
go RSA
 
07:09:28.628 --> 07:09:28.638 align:start position:0%
171a requires the department um to put
 
07:09:31.948 --> 07:09:31.958 align:start position:0%
in our budget the cost to fully support
 
07:09:34.190 --> 07:09:34.200 align:start position:0%
the DD weight list and then there's a
 
07:09:35.868 --> 07:09:35.878 align:start position:0%
clause in there that says and then the
 
07:09:40.468 --> 07:09:40.478 align:start position:0%
legislature shall fund that it's 171 a18
 
07:09:40.478 --> 07:09:41.788 align:start position:0%
legislature shall fund that it's 171 a18
I

07:09:41.788 --> 07:09:41.798 align:start position:0%
I
 
07:09:45.708 --> 07:09:45.718 align:start position:0%
believe um I can get you those exact no
 
07:09:49.590 --> 07:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
I'm aware of the law yeah so um okay I
 
07:09:52.030 --> 07:09:52.040 align:start position:0%
just in in our head I wanted to so the
 
07:09:53.830 --> 07:09:53.840 align:start position:0%
funding that's in efficiency is
 
07:09:55.910 --> 07:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
essentially funding for the people who
 
07:09:58.830 --> 07:09:58.840 align:start position:0%
are currently on the list roughly 4,000
 
07:10:02.150 --> 07:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
is that is that population
 
07:10:04.350 --> 07:10:04.360 align:start position:0%
that that needs the
 
07:10:06.590 --> 07:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
service um is the growth fairly
 
07:10:09.468 --> 07:10:09.478 align:start position:0%
consistent is it is it is it what's it
 
07:10:11.230 --> 07:10:11.240 align:start position:0%
doing it's not exponentially growing is
 
07:10:13.310 --> 07:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
it slowing down bit no it doesn't slow
 
07:10:16.110 --> 07:10:16.120 align:start position:0%
down it consistently grows as um
 
07:10:18.150 --> 07:10:18.160 align:start position:0%
children age out of the system and
 
07:10:20.868 --> 07:10:20.878 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities do live longer
 
07:10:23.750 --> 07:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
um there also is and Nathan maybe you
 
07:10:26.070 --> 07:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
can talk about this we look at the DD
 
07:10:29.030 --> 07:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
numbers really closely cuz when we get
 
07:10:32.788 --> 07:10:32.798 align:start position:0%
to about um April may we do have the
 
07:10:35.788 --> 07:10:35.798 align:start position:0%
ability to carry forward dollars um to
 
07:10:37.310 --> 07:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
help with that but we don't know what
 
07:10:41.310 --> 07:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
that carry forward will be today um and
 
07:10:43.030 --> 07:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
we won't know that until later in the
 
07:10:45.670 --> 07:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
budget process and on once somebody once
 
07:10:47.388 --> 07:10:47.398 align:start position:0%
somebody starts receiving Services it's
 
07:10:50.708 --> 07:10:50.718 align:start position:0%
rarely PR rated right when you yes what
 
07:10:54.590 --> 07:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
how we figure the budget for the new
 
07:10:57.070 --> 07:10:57.080 align:start position:0%
Services is we PR rate it based on when
 
07:11:00.708 --> 07:11:00.718 align:start position:0%
they either turn 22 or when it's
 
07:11:02.868 --> 07:11:02.878 align:start position:0%
anticipated that they will need
 
07:11:05.070 --> 07:11:05.080 align:start position:0%
Services okay great um thank you thank
 
07:11:07.070 --> 07:11:07.080 align:start position:0%
you for indulging me I appreciate that
 
07:11:09.468 --> 07:11:09.478 align:start position:0%
um I want to ask two questions one one
 
07:11:12.110 --> 07:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
is about laps and one is broader
 
07:11:15.388 --> 07:11:15.398 align:start position:0%
philosophically um your laps is uh you
 
07:11:16.788 --> 07:11:16.798 align:start position:0%
know the last couple years and the the
 
07:11:18.868 --> 07:11:18.878 align:start position:0%
way we budgeted we budget astronomical
 
07:11:21.750 --> 07:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
numbers for lapses um because we've been
 
07:11:24.750 --> 07:11:24.760 align:start position:0%
like during Co they were crazy high and
 
07:11:26.070 --> 07:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
and they're coming back down to earth
 
07:11:27.910 --> 07:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
like in the most recent budget and yours
 
07:11:30.070 --> 07:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
in particular which is obviously the
 
07:11:32.150 --> 07:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
biggest part of the lap
 
07:11:35.468 --> 07:11:35.478 align:start position:0%
um fair to say that that certainly with
 
07:11:37.070 --> 07:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
with this budget if it were to go
 
07:11:40.788 --> 07:11:40.798 align:start position:0%
forward but generally you're closer to
 
07:11:43.070 --> 07:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
not much of a lapse than than you were
 
07:11:46.510 --> 07:11:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:50.388 --> 07:11:50.398 align:start position:0%
23 sure so there's a couple I I I I
 
07:11:51.910 --> 07:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
think just almost backing up from a
 
07:11:55.190 --> 07:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
historical perspective so you know 10 12
 
07:11:59.030 --> 07:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
years ago um you you you probably saw
 
07:12:01.270 --> 07:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
larger lapses from the department and
 
07:12:03.670 --> 07:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
have been a number of legislative
 
07:12:06.750 --> 07:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
changes within our budget over the years
 
07:12:09.510 --> 07:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh when it comes to the accounting unit
 
07:12:13.350 --> 07:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
2152 for the nursing facility payments
 
07:12:15.510 --> 07:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
you know there used to be a decent
 
07:12:16.708 --> 07:12:16.718 align:start position:0%
amount of money that could have lapsed
 
07:12:18.310 --> 07:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
out of there but now there is a class
 
07:12:20.230 --> 07:12:20.240 align:start position:0%
note that requires those funds to be
 
07:12:22.590 --> 07:12:22.600 align:start position:0%
paid out within the DD accounts that we
 
07:12:24.910 --> 07:12:24.920 align:start position:0%
were just talking about 7100 being the
 
07:12:27.468 --> 07:12:27.478 align:start position:0%
largest uh now RSA
 
07:12:30.070 --> 07:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
171a carries those funds forward so
 
07:12:33.070 --> 07:12:33.080 align:start position:0%
those funds would no longer laps uh in
 
07:12:35.190 --> 07:12:35.200 align:start position:0%
addition to the federal um the federal
 
07:12:38.310 --> 07:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
revenue projections that uh that we have
 
07:12:40.150 --> 07:12:40.160 align:start position:0%
been doing based on the new system that
 
07:12:42.708 --> 07:12:42.718 align:start position:0%
we've implemented we're Cur we're
 
07:12:46.430 --> 07:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
curtailing the the lapsing of federal
 
07:12:48.070 --> 07:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
revenue that we earn but we just didn't
 
07:12:49.468 --> 07:12:49.478 align:start position:0%
apply because now we have the better
 
07:12:51.948 --> 07:12:51.958 align:start position:0%
ability to identify earn it and apply it
 
07:12:54.030 --> 07:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
to better utilize General funds but you
 
07:12:57.070 --> 07:12:57.080 align:start position:0%
are correct this past year uh we you
 
07:13:01.388 --> 07:13:01.398 align:start position:0%
know net lapsed about $13.5 million
 
07:13:03.708 --> 07:13:03.718 align:start position:0%
um which which is very different from
 
07:13:05.270 --> 07:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
the historical
 
07:13:07.990 --> 07:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
experience and and in the first year I
 
07:13:09.468 --> 07:13:09.478 align:start position:0%
think I'm right about this in the first
 
07:13:11.510 --> 07:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
year some enormous percentage of your
 
07:13:15.190 --> 07:13:15.200 align:start position:0%
budget can't lapse right is it like half
 
07:13:17.830 --> 07:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
um I don't think it's half the Medicaid
 
07:13:21.468 --> 07:13:21.478 align:start position:0%
budget had a u has Provisions within it
 
07:13:23.230 --> 07:13:23.240 align:start position:0%
to carry forward those dollars New
 
07:13:26.070 --> 07:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital and Hamstead have
 
07:13:28.150 --> 07:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
some footnotes to allow certain
 
07:13:31.750 --> 07:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
operational class lines to carry forward
 
07:13:35.708 --> 07:13:35.718 align:start position:0%
uh but but I it's certainly um for most
 
07:13:38.468 --> 07:13:38.478 align:start position:0%
areas DD as well right and and and DD as
 
07:13:40.990 --> 07:13:41.000 align:start position:0%
well but DD never lapses that continues
 
07:13:43.548 --> 07:13:43.558 align:start position:0%
from bium to bium as a result of that
 
07:13:46.548 --> 07:13:46.558 align:start position:0%
statute um thank you for that the the
 
07:13:48.628 --> 07:13:48.638 align:start position:0%
just something that as we develop a
 
07:13:51.670 --> 07:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
budget and if somebody like puts in a
 
07:13:54.990 --> 07:13:55.000 align:start position:0%
plug for HHS laps and gobs of money
 
07:13:57.708 --> 07:13:57.718 align:start position:0%
we're all in trouble
 
07:14:02.510 --> 07:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
um it a broader context issue um as the
 
07:14:03.430 --> 07:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner pointed out at the
 
07:14:06.070 --> 07:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
beginning of this you more than half the
 
07:14:09.190 --> 07:14:09.200 align:start position:0%
budget and we spent something like a
 
07:14:12.468 --> 07:14:12.478 align:start position:0%
thous minutes talking about the other
 
07:14:13.590 --> 07:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
half of the budget and we're going to
 
07:14:15.510 --> 07:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
spend 45 talking about this half of the
 
07:14:18.548 --> 07:14:18.558 align:start position:0%
budget 17 hours versus less than an hour
 
07:14:22.190 --> 07:14:22.200 align:start position:0%
or something like that and it it's worth
 
07:14:24.910 --> 07:14:24.920 align:start position:0%
noting that you know I asked an agency
 
07:14:26.590 --> 07:14:26.600 align:start position:0%
yesterday or maybe it was Tuesday I
 
07:14:29.270 --> 07:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
don't know anymore about a $100,000
 
07:14:31.830 --> 07:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
increase in a class line on a page of
 
07:14:33.510 --> 07:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
their budget
 
07:14:36.230 --> 07:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
and the odds of me doing that to you are
 
07:14:39.708 --> 07:14:39.718 align:start position:0%
zero right and it's and it it's hard and
 
07:14:41.310 --> 07:14:41.320 align:start position:0%
it's hard for Budget writers and you
 
07:14:42.750 --> 07:14:42.760 align:start position:0%
know the legislature is going to have an
 
07:14:44.990 --> 07:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
entire division that's going to spend
 
07:14:46.468 --> 07:14:46.478 align:start position:0%
weeks going through your budget line by
 
07:14:48.990 --> 07:14:49.000 align:start position:0%
line and the poor governor elect has to
 
07:14:51.190 --> 07:14:51.200 align:start position:0%
have a budget where the numbers stop
 
07:14:53.230 --> 07:14:53.240 align:start position:0%
moving by like 10 days after she sworn
 
07:14:56.990 --> 07:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
in um and and I say this this isn't news
 
07:14:59.070 --> 07:14:59.080 align:start position:0%
to anybody right but um I remember so
 
07:15:00.990 --> 07:15:01.000 align:start position:0%
eight years ago I was in a similar POS
 
07:15:03.110 --> 07:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
position where there were different
 
07:15:06.230 --> 07:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
governors in the two phases um and you
 
07:15:08.030 --> 07:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
know we came in and it was a nightmare
 
07:15:09.510 --> 07:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
and I remember sitting down and and you
 
07:15:11.030 --> 07:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
know very sitting down with very nice
 
07:15:14.670 --> 07:15:14.680 align:start position:0%
people to try to explain and give me a
 
07:15:18.110 --> 07:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
multi- hundred page binder to simplify
 
07:15:20.788 --> 07:15:20.798 align:start position:0%
the HHS budget so the simplification
 
07:15:25.350 --> 07:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
document was 150 Pages um I think this
 
07:15:27.510 --> 07:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
is just me saying this to you that for
 
07:15:27.520 --> 07:15:28.590 align:start position:0%
is just me saying this to you that for
decision

07:15:28.590 --> 07:15:28.600 align:start position:0%
decision
 
07:15:31.468 --> 07:15:31.478 align:start position:0%
makers how you sort that out is going to
 
07:15:33.830 --> 07:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
be I mean we sat there I remember the
 
07:15:35.628 --> 07:15:35.638 align:start position:0%
the governor-elect at that time doesn't
 
07:15:38.190 --> 07:15:38.200 align:start position:0%
matter what his name was and I met with
 
07:15:39.990 --> 07:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
with I think Jeff Myers was commissioner
 
07:15:42.750 --> 07:15:42.760 align:start position:0%
and the and the CFO at the time and it
 
07:15:45.830 --> 07:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
was overwhelming and my my giant
 
07:15:47.350 --> 07:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
takeaway from the meeting was wow the
 
07:15:49.590 --> 07:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner has a bathroom um because
 
07:15:51.510 --> 07:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
you try to focus on the things you can
 
07:15:54.948 --> 07:15:54.958 align:start position:0%
understand and um and we ended up having
 
07:15:56.468 --> 07:15:56.478 align:start position:0%
multiple meetings and and at one point
 
07:15:58.270 --> 07:15:58.280 align:start position:0%
you know so Sher Rockburn was the CFO
 
07:16:00.110 --> 07:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
people know that who's now my assistant
 
07:16:02.670 --> 07:16:02.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner and and I said this to her
 
07:16:04.190 --> 07:16:04.200 align:start position:0%
at some point I said we have to make
 
07:16:06.070 --> 07:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
decisions and I don't know how the hell
 
07:16:08.868 --> 07:16:08.878 align:start position:0%
to make them he has some vague sense of
 
07:16:10.670 --> 07:16:10.680 align:start position:0%
what he wants not vague sense he has a
 
07:16:12.830 --> 07:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
sense of what he wants to do but it's I
 
07:16:14.548 --> 07:16:14.558 align:start position:0%
can't talk to you about class 45 and
 
07:16:17.708 --> 07:16:17.718 align:start position:0%
class 62 and all of that and she you
 
07:16:19.510 --> 07:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
know in Sherry's Sherry's way and she
 
07:16:20.868 --> 07:16:20.878 align:start position:0%
couldn't be here today but in Sherry's
 
07:16:23.948 --> 07:16:23.958 align:start position:0%
way she waves her arms wildly and talks
 
07:16:26.590 --> 07:16:26.600 align:start position:0%
really fast and then produces a document
 
07:16:29.110 --> 07:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
with arrows and boxes and things going
 
07:16:30.948 --> 07:16:30.958 align:start position:0%
all over the place and it was a decision
 
07:16:33.788 --> 07:16:33.798 align:start position:0%
making document and it it it's it's
 
07:16:35.750 --> 07:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
similar to this but it was more like all
 
07:16:37.910 --> 07:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
right here's the 14 decisions you have
 
07:16:41.910 --> 07:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
to make and getting us there and
 
07:16:44.910 --> 07:16:44.920 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that year we were cutting
 
07:16:46.990 --> 07:16:47.000 align:start position:0%
we were cutting hhs's numbers and it was
 
07:16:48.990 --> 07:16:49.000 align:start position:0%
really hard to do um particularly
 
07:16:50.510 --> 07:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
because there were some things the
 
07:16:52.708 --> 07:16:52.718 align:start position:0%
governor governor wanted to do a
 
07:16:55.110 --> 07:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
significant DD increase for example
 
07:16:57.670 --> 07:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
quite large one and we were simplifying
 
07:16:59.468 --> 07:16:59.478 align:start position:0%
other things and and this is just me
 
07:17:01.868 --> 07:17:01.878 align:start position:0%
saying to you
 
07:17:04.868 --> 07:17:04.878 align:start position:0%
45 minutes for half the budget and a th
 
07:17:08.230 --> 07:17:08.240 align:start position:0%
for the other half um a lot of people
 
07:17:11.350 --> 07:17:11.360 align:start position:0%
who were on the transition team and and
 
07:17:13.388 --> 07:17:13.398 align:start position:0%
probably their boss are going to need a
 
07:17:17.708 --> 07:17:17.718 align:start position:0%
lot of help from you in in helping
 
07:17:20.230 --> 07:17:20.240 align:start position:0%
translate budgets into English and all
 
07:17:24.388 --> 07:17:24.398 align:start position:0%
that thanks may I respond please I meant
 
07:17:26.830 --> 07:17:26.840 align:start position:0%
it in a nice way no I and I appreciate
 
07:17:28.750 --> 07:17:28.760 align:start position:0%
that I think it is a challenge and I I
 
07:17:30.590 --> 07:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
tried to Ice Break in the beginning
 
07:17:32.190 --> 07:17:32.200 align:start position:0%
about about that about how hard it was
 
07:17:35.150 --> 07:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
to present our budget in 45 minutes um I
 
07:17:36.788 --> 07:17:36.798 align:start position:0%
you know we are an agency that serves
 
07:17:38.628 --> 07:17:38.638 align:start position:0%
our most vulnerable in the state that's
 
07:17:40.670 --> 07:17:40.680 align:start position:0%
the challenge we're a service agency
 
07:17:42.868 --> 07:17:42.878 align:start position:0%
we're not making you know product or
 
07:17:45.110 --> 07:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
widgets and we can't shut down wings um
 
07:17:47.388 --> 07:17:47.398 align:start position:0%
there's consequences to to budget cuts
 
07:17:49.548 --> 07:17:49.558 align:start position:0%
and we take that extremely seriously so
 
07:17:51.310 --> 07:17:51.320 align:start position:0%
we want to work with the the governor
 
07:17:53.948 --> 07:17:53.958 align:start position:0%
elect team uh and and others to make
 
07:17:56.190 --> 07:17:56.200 align:start position:0%
sure that we make the right choices and
 
07:17:57.910 --> 07:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
the responsible choices and that we're
 
07:18:00.388 --> 07:18:00.398 align:start position:0%
not causing causing any harm and that
 
07:18:01.388 --> 07:18:01.398 align:start position:0%
the um
 
07:18:02.910 --> 07:18:02.920 align:start position:0%
the things that might seem obvious the
 
07:18:04.628 --> 07:18:04.638 align:start position:0%
reason I bring up Personnel is because
 
07:18:06.110 --> 07:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
the juice isn't worth the squeeze on
 
07:18:08.750 --> 07:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
that one um as I would say um you know
 
07:18:10.628 --> 07:18:10.638 align:start position:0%
there are probably other ways that we
 
07:18:12.230 --> 07:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
could look to do some cost savings
 
07:18:15.230 --> 07:18:15.240 align:start position:0%
without causing harm but I I it it's
 
07:18:17.030 --> 07:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
going to be challenging and it we've
 
07:18:18.388 --> 07:18:18.398 align:start position:0%
been saying that we've been talking with
 
07:18:20.830 --> 07:18:20.840 align:start position:0%
our partners we recognize that we're in
 
07:18:23.628 --> 07:18:23.638 align:start position:0%
different times it's not the co time so
 
07:18:24.788 --> 07:18:24.798 align:start position:0%
I just want to acknowledge that and the
 
07:18:26.430 --> 07:18:26.440 align:start position:0%
bathroom was an inside droke for those
 
07:18:29.190 --> 07:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
of you that didn't
 
07:18:32.110 --> 07:18:32.120 align:start position:0%
know I think ter and it's not you it's
 
07:18:34.350 --> 07:18:34.360 align:start position:0%
Terry Morton built a bathroom off the
 
07:18:39.868 --> 07:18:39.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:46.750 --> 07:18:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:50.190 --> 07:18:50.200 align:start position:0%
