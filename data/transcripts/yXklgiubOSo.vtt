information for the committee but i will
 
00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
pass all this information out when
 
00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
everybody's here we have two
 
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
hearings that we're looking at this
 
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
morning prior to getting in the exact
 
00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.749 align:start position:0%
morning prior to getting in the exact
sessions

00:08:11.749 --> 00:08:11.759 align:start position:0%
sessions
 
00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
the first bill which we're addressing is
 
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
1229 establishing a committee to study
 
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
school meal programs in new hampshire's
 
00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:19.280 align:start position:0%
public schools and non-sectarian schools
 
00:08:20.869 --> 00:08:20.879 align:start position:0%
that accept public
 
00:08:23.029 --> 00:08:23.039 align:start position:0%
funds and i'd like to
 
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
recognize representative horgan the
 
00:08:36.389 --> 00:08:36.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:37.919 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chairman thank
 
00:08:39.509 --> 00:08:39.519 align:start position:0%
you very much to the
 
00:08:42.389 --> 00:08:42.399 align:start position:0%
to the to the committee um h
 
00:08:43.829 --> 00:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
i'm representing timothy horrigan from
 
00:08:45.509 --> 00:08:45.519 align:start position:0%
the towns of
 
00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:47.360 align:start position:0%
roughness stratfor county district six
 
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
which is the towns of durham and madbury
 
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
so it's two-thirds of the oyster river
 
00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
cooperative school district
 
00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
and so i'm here to introduce hb 1229
 
00:08:59.030 --> 00:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
establishing a committee to study school
 
00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
meal programs in new hampshire public
 
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
schools and non-sectarian schools that
 
00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
actually went and uh so this bill is
 
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
exactly the same aside from the
 
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
expiration and effective dates as hb 203
 
00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:16.160 align:start position:0%
which came before the house committee
 
00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
last year and that in turn hb 203 in
 
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
terms exactly the same as hb 1681 is
 
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
amended by the house education committee
 
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:26.240 align:start position:0%
sent to house finance so it's had a
 
00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
it should have
 
00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
in 2020 the you know it passed through
 
00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
the committee probably didn't even
 
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
probably didn't even need to be in house
 
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
finance but in all the confusion that
 
00:09:43.829 --> 00:09:43.839 align:start position:0%
was back in february march 2020 so those
 
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
of you here remember that it was like a
 
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
rather chaotic time and uh
 
00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
it's never even made through the floor
 
00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
of the house and frankly last year you
 
00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
you itled it and normally would have
 
00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:56.240 align:start position:0%
been unable to bring it back this year
 
00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
however thanks to moore
 
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
cove which created uh chaos um
 
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
the full house some as you all remember
 
00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
never voted on hb 203 and many other
 
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
bills so we never actually voted on
 
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
any of the itl bills except for a few
 
00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
that were either especially
 
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
controversial or where uh
 
00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
where the uh where there was some hope
 
00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:18.959 align:start position:0%
of overturning the itl and i would have
 
00:10:18.959 --> 00:10:20.870 align:start position:0%
of overturning the itl and i would have
uh

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:22.720 align:start position:0%
and of course i'm asking you to change
 
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
your mind this year since you turned the
 
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
bill down uh last year but
 
00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
i think uh this version of the bill
 
00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
should in due course be passed it's just
 
00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:33.200 align:start position:0%
a uh just a study committee
 
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
so if you pass this it'll meet this
 
00:10:36.389 --> 00:10:36.399 align:start position:0%
summer and fall several times and
 
00:10:38.069 --> 00:10:38.079 align:start position:0%
discuss uh
 
00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:40.240 align:start position:0%
discuss uh the funding and maybe what
 
00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
other issues the committee wants to
 
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
discuss about school meal programs
 
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
there's a lot
 
00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:47.519 align:start position:0%
probably a lot to be discussed um one
 
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
thing that's happened since the covet
 
00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
pandemic is uh
 
00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
is um
 
00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
is that uh when we have remote learning
 
00:10:57.509 --> 00:10:57.519 align:start position:0%
i think most schools send school lunches
 
00:10:59.670 --> 00:10:59.680 align:start position:0%
around to every house because there's uh
 
00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
it was probably easier to do that
 
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
administratively there was funding
 
00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
available to do that and also uh
 
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:08.720 align:start position:0%
that eliminated uh confidentiality
 
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
concerns and um
 
00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
many probably like a mirror there's like
 
00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:16.160 align:start position:0%
many other issues the committee could
 
00:11:18.069 --> 00:11:18.079 align:start position:0%
discuss i think it'd be a good exercise
 
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:11:21.509 --> 00:11:21.519 align:start position:0%
obviously you're not going to study
 
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
all aspects of this issue but i think
 
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
it's worth enough time to do some good
 
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
work so um even though
 
00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
even though the majority turned it down
 
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
last time my since i was able to bring
 
00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
it back again i decided to
 
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
take a few minutes and bring it back for
 
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
you again give you another chance to uh
 
00:11:41.829 --> 00:11:41.839 align:start position:0%
to think about i hope this time you'll
 
00:11:44.069 --> 00:11:44.079 align:start position:0%
see fit to pass it and um so i have the
 
00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
uh then later this year the committee
 
00:11:47.829 --> 00:11:47.839 align:start position:0%
could meet it would be
 
00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:49.519 align:start position:0%
three members of the house and one
 
00:11:51.509 --> 00:11:51.519 align:start position:0%
senator so it would not be a cumbersome
 
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
group it's just uh just four people so i
 
00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.470 align:start position:0%
group it's just uh just four people so i
uh

00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:11:57.829 --> 00:11:57.839 align:start position:0%
so that's uh
 
00:11:59.670 --> 00:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
that's so that's my bill i'll be happy
 
00:12:01.509 --> 00:12:01.519 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions should you have
 
00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
them thank you very much representative
 
00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
horrigan are there any questions from
 
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:12.629 --> 00:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
and it's not even a legal question
 
00:12:12.639 --> 00:12:13.590 align:start position:0%
and it's not even a legal question
um

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
so i love this bill you know we are the
 
00:12:17.509 --> 00:12:17.519 align:start position:0%
richest country in the world and my
 
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
belief is no child should ever be
 
00:12:21.509 --> 00:12:21.519 align:start position:0%
sitting in school hungry yeah so i'm
 
00:12:23.269 --> 00:12:23.279 align:start position:0%
wondering if you when you put this
 
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
together if you have any data
 
00:12:28.629 --> 00:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
on how many kids are sitting there
 
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
hungry because they haven't had
 
00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
breakfast or how many kids are sitting
 
00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
there hungry because they haven't had
 
00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:34.470 align:start position:0%
there hungry because they haven't had
lunch

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
lunch
 
00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering if you have data in
 
00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
the background that inspired this bill
 
00:12:40.069 --> 00:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
um well i guess i don't the exact number
 
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
here but i know i know it's very
 
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
significant so and anybody who's worked
 
00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:44.069 align:start position:0%
significant so and anybody who's worked
in

00:12:44.069 --> 00:12:44.079 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:12:45.829 --> 00:12:45.839 align:start position:0%
the education profession will tell you
 
00:12:48.069 --> 00:12:48.079 align:start position:0%
the same thing so i remember
 
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
we had a
 
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
lot of you probably remember
 
00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:52.720 align:start position:0%
representative sue ford who's on this
 
00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:54.240 align:start position:0%
committee for many years she's a former
 
00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
school principal and now she's talking
 
00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
how she used to make sure every kid was
 
00:12:59.030 --> 00:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
fed even that meant like feeding them
 
00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
out of her own pocket so it's uh
 
00:13:02.389 --> 00:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
i know it's
 
00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
offhand i'd say it's about 25 to
 
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
percent but um i
 
00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
yes i
 
00:13:08.949 --> 00:13:08.959 align:start position:0%
that's probably one reason we need the
 
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
committee in order to nail down the
 
00:13:13.269 --> 00:13:13.279 align:start position:0%
exact number but yes so follow up
 
00:13:13.279 --> 00:13:14.150 align:start position:0%
exact number but yes so follow up
yes

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:16.240 align:start position:0%
so i heard an interesting story or read
 
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
i think i heard it on the radio i get so
 
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
much news sometimes i'm not sure where
 
00:13:20.389 --> 00:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
it comes from
 
00:13:20.399 --> 00:13:21.269 align:start position:0%
it comes from
about

00:13:21.269 --> 00:13:21.279 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
a family that had chosen to go remote
 
00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
because of cobit and they had asthma in
 
00:13:28.389 --> 00:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
the house and they did not have
 
00:13:30.069 --> 00:13:30.079 align:start position:0%
appropriate covert protocols in the
 
00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
school so they kept their kids home and
 
00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
it turns out that by going remote and
 
00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
using a velox kind of thing on a remote
 
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
you lose your qualification for free and
 
00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
reduced school lunch and i didn't
 
00:13:41.829 --> 00:13:41.839 align:start position:0%
obviously that would be something this
 
00:13:43.829 --> 00:13:43.839 align:start position:0%
committee can can study i didn't know if
 
00:13:45.189 --> 00:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
you had come across those kinds of
 
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
stories as well no that's a um
 
00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:50.720 align:start position:0%
well that's i had not come across that
 
00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
story but that's certainly uh i was like
 
00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.389 align:start position:0%
story but that's certainly uh i was like
frankly

00:13:54.389 --> 00:13:54.399 align:start position:0%
frankly
 
00:13:54.399 --> 00:13:55.430 align:start position:0%
frankly
shocked

00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
shocked
 
00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know the details of course but
 
00:13:58.629 --> 00:13:58.639 align:start position:0%
frankly that's some i'm pretty sure i'd
 
00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
be shocked by the details if i uh if i
 
00:14:03.509 --> 00:14:03.519 align:start position:0%
heard them themselves like that's uh
 
00:14:04.949 --> 00:14:04.959 align:start position:0%
that's certainly uh something that the
 
00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
community could look into also one
 
00:14:09.509 --> 00:14:09.519 align:start position:0%
specific thing which was a problem even
 
00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:11.519 align:start position:0%
before the pandemic even more so now is
 
00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:13.279 align:start position:0%
that there's a large
 
00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
number of families who are eligible for
 
00:14:17.269 --> 00:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
the reduced-price meals but for whatever
 
00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
reason because they don't think they
 
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
deserve it or they think the application
 
00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
process is too
 
00:14:24.629 --> 00:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
cumbersome or whatever choose not to
 
00:14:26.629 --> 00:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
apply even though they could
 
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:28.160 align:start position:0%
they could get it and that's like not
 
00:14:29.509 --> 00:14:29.519 align:start position:0%
good for either the school district or
 
00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
the family because the school district
 
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:32.710 align:start position:0%
the family because the school district
uh

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:32.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:14:34.389 --> 00:14:34.399 align:start position:0%
gets less aid
 
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
gets less aid when um their reduced
 
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:38.240 align:start position:0%
price or free meal
 
00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:40.160 align:start position:0%
eligible students aren't are being under
 
00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
counted and then of course the families
 
00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:42.829 align:start position:0%
counted and then of course the families
are

00:14:42.829 --> 00:14:42.839 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:14:45.189 --> 00:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
paying more for their lunch than they
 
00:14:47.189 --> 00:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
should be and i actually frankly i think
 
00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
in the perfect world every family every
 
00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:50.720 align:start position:0%
kid in school should probably get the
 
00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
free lunch as part of their you know
 
00:14:54.629 --> 00:14:54.639 align:start position:0%
that should be an integral part of their
 
00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
school day and they shouldn't have to
 
00:14:59.350 --> 00:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
pay extra for it but that's uh
 
00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
i mean i may be a dreamer or that may be
 
00:15:03.829 --> 00:15:03.839 align:start position:0%
realistic um
 
00:15:05.829 --> 00:15:05.839 align:start position:0%
it certainly uh they did manage to do it
 
00:15:07.269 --> 00:15:07.279 align:start position:0%
at least in my school district and many
 
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
others uh you know
 
00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
now two years ago seems like about 20
 
00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.230 align:start position:0%
now two years ago seems like about 20
but

00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:15:14.069 --> 00:15:14.079 align:start position:0%
two years ago in 2020 when they had to
 
00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
shut down the schools rather abruptly
 
00:15:19.269 --> 00:15:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:21.519 align:start position:0%
further questions represent woodcock
 
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman good morning
 
00:15:25.189 --> 00:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
representative uh just a couple quick
 
00:15:27.509 --> 00:15:27.519 align:start position:0%
ones and a short story but
 
00:15:29.749 --> 00:15:29.759 align:start position:0%
uh as i look at this bill and and the
 
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
the multiple bills you brought in on
 
00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
food and hunger nutrition for youngsters
 
00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
uh this past session uh is every every
 
00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
bill has a goal somewhere yes um so in
 
00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
the focus of this committee are you
 
00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:44.240 align:start position:0%
looking for us to if it passes to look
 
00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:46.720 align:start position:0%
more at the nutritional piece or more at
 
00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:48.959 align:start position:0%
the participation piece
 
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
well well both and i think also in
 
00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
addition to the nutrition probably kids
 
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
should be taught more about
 
00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
more about food than they are so that's
 
00:15:59.910 --> 00:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
just you know just from the
 
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh there should be more it should be
 
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
more emphasis in the health curriculum
 
00:16:04.389 --> 00:16:04.399 align:start position:0%
on your food and they probably should
 
00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
know more about how food is raised and
 
00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
how it's prepared that um
 
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
so i remember there seems to be less of
 
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
that in uh in
 
00:16:13.509 --> 00:16:13.519 align:start position:0%
schools today than it was when i was a
 
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
kid and even then we you know we didn't
 
00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:16.629 align:start position:0%
kid and even then we you know we didn't
really

00:16:16.629 --> 00:16:16.639 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
learn as much as we should have about it
 
00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.230 align:start position:0%
learn as much as we should have about it
but

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:20.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
further question yes well mini story
 
00:16:24.389 --> 00:16:24.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
just to follow up in your your
 
00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
participation rate piece as as a former
 
00:16:29.509 --> 00:16:29.519 align:start position:0%
high school
 
00:16:31.749 --> 00:16:31.759 align:start position:0%
uh person to supervise the cafeteria as
 
00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
my favorite part of the day um i often
 
00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:36.959 align:start position:0%
saw that the high schoolers who had
 
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
siblings in the younger levels in
 
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
elementary middle school did not
 
00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.389 align:start position:0%
elementary middle school did not
participate

00:16:42.389 --> 00:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
participate
 
00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
uh because it wasn't cool and they
 
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
didn't in their in their family yeah so
 
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
it it as a media you're proposing for
 
00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
the committee wouldn't it be nice if the
 
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
family qualifies
 
00:16:55.189 --> 00:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
it's covered for all the siblings uh
 
00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
because the high school kids really
 
00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
don't uh if they're the same family
 
00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
because of that that
 
00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
stereotype and no matter no matter what
 
00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:04.720 align:start position:0%
you try to do with the the cars and the
 
00:17:06.549 --> 00:17:06.559 align:start position:0%
anonymity is still there but i
 
00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:07.839 align:start position:0%
appreciate you bringing this forward for
 
00:17:09.189 --> 00:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
this review thank you thank you thank
 
00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:10.880 align:start position:0%

00:17:24.789 --> 00:17:24.799 align:start position:0%
will be the or the fourth time will be
 
00:17:26.789 --> 00:17:26.799 align:start position:0%
the charm for this thanks are there any
 
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
other pink cards for this uh bill

nazi thank you very much i will close
 
00:17:37.909 --> 00:17:37.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
for me 12 45
 
00:17:59.190 --> 00:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:00.799 align:start position:0%
aaron is checking on
 
00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
well the uh we're in this break here and
 
00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:48.160 align:start position:0%
we start the next bill up 9 45 some
 
00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
announcements can be given here
 
00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.029 align:start position:0%
announcements can be given here
um

00:18:51.029 --> 00:18:51.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
one i do have these uh sheets available
 
00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
for everybody in the community to be
 
00:18:58.950 --> 00:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
tracking the various bills which we have
 
00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
it's an abbreviated form which will help
 
00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.310 align:start position:0%
it's an abbreviated form which will help
us

00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
obviously you don't see the action
 
00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
taking place on any of this because that
 
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
won't occur until it's in the docket
 
00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:10.559 align:start position:0%
nothing's in the dock yet so we'll hand
 
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
these out
 
00:19:13.909 --> 00:19:13.919 align:start position:0%
i'll pass them around for
 
00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:16.160 align:start position:0%
either way for members on the committee
 
00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
to have so you can also be tracking
 
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
these bills
 
00:19:21.669 --> 00:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
and looking at
 
00:19:24.549 --> 00:19:24.559 align:start position:0%
the days which we are looking for our
 
00:19:24.559 --> 00:19:25.750 align:start position:0%
the days which we are looking for our
break

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
break
 
00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
i am
 
00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:28.720 align:start position:0%
looking at let me first give you the
 
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
days that we're going to have to do
 
00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:34.950 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
next week
 
00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
we will be meeting here
 
00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:40.720 align:start position:0%
on the
 
00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:42.070 align:start position:0%
on the
15th

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
15th
 
00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
that's a tuesday
 
00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:46.400 align:start position:0%

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
calendar it's for those bills which came
 
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
from the fourth
 
00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
and we're moved to the fifth that was
 
00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
the snow day
 
00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
so it's the same order same you know
 
00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
time frames for all the bills on the
 
00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:00.390 align:start position:0%
time frames for all the bills on the
15th

00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
15th
 
00:20:03.909 --> 00:20:03.919 align:start position:0%
the 16th is a half day in manchester
 
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh so we're for full session so
 
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
obviously we're not meeting here
 
00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
and the same on the 17th which is also a
 
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
session day in manchester that all that
 
00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
information is in the in the blue
 
00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.870 align:start position:0%
information is in the in the blue
calendar

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
to be scheduled and that's it's going to
 
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
come out in the calendar
 
00:20:30.789 --> 00:20:30.799 align:start position:0%
uh we will be meeting on the 22nd
 
00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
the 23rd
 
00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
and the 24th to exec bills
 
00:20:38.789 --> 00:20:38.799 align:start position:0%
so that's tuesday wednesday and thursday
 
00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:40.799 align:start position:0%
uh you'll notice in the calendar there's
 
00:20:43.029 --> 00:20:43.039 align:start position:0%
only going to be one bill listed to exec
 
00:20:45.029 --> 00:20:45.039 align:start position:0%
but below it will say other bills you
 
00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
know can be exact we don't want to have
 
00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
to start listing
 
00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
every bill in the world
 
00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.350 align:start position:0%
every bill in the world
um

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:55.909 --> 00:20:55.919 align:start position:0%
and and if you if you for example list a
 
00:20:59.190 --> 00:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
bill for being heard on the 24th
 
00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
but you have a whole available on the
 
00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
22nd or 23rd you can't exact that bill
 
00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
because it's already been identified
 
00:21:06.149 --> 00:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
later on
 
00:21:06.159 --> 00:21:07.270 align:start position:0%
later on
so

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:21:08.789 --> 00:21:08.799 align:start position:0%
i think the best way to do it is i'll
 
00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
just list one bill for the 22nd the 23rd
 
00:21:14.789 --> 00:21:14.799 align:start position:0%
and the 24th and we'll work together as
 
00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
we have been and trying to identify
 
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
which ones we're looking at in
 
00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
coming up just like we've done this week
 
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
and the previous week
 
00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
we do have
 
00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
two bills which we have to have hearings
 
00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:29.590 align:start position:0%
two bills which we have to have hearings
on

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:21:31.669 --> 00:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
those were the bills which were the mass
 
00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
bills which were removed from the dock
 
00:21:36.149 --> 00:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
because we couldn't find the general
 
00:21:38.149 --> 00:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
we couldn't go down the finance room
 
00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
that was taken and and our our hall was
 
00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
also being used at that day
 
00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
by another committee
 
00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
so i'm looking potentially for doing
 
00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
those bills on the morning of the 25th
 
00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
that's the friday and having it done and
 
00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
then we won't be doing any executing
 
00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
other than those those three bills and
 
00:21:59.909 --> 00:21:59.919 align:start position:0%
and there is another bill which there's
 
00:22:02.789 --> 00:22:02.799 align:start position:0%
an amendment coming forward on
 
00:22:06.149 --> 00:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
11 41. the three bills which the two
 
00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
bills which we had scheduled which we
 
00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
had to
 
00:22:11.669 --> 00:22:11.679 align:start position:0%
put off because of snow
 
00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
or because of the crowdedness i mean 11
 
00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
31 and 1371
 
00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
there is an amendment coming up for 11
 
00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
41. i i feel that's not really
 
00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
it's changing that bill around too much
 
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
so we need to have a hearing on it
 
00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
and and uh that will be held also on
 
00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
that same day so we will be doing in the
 
00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.510 align:start position:0%
 
25th

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
25th
 
00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
and then and we won't be doing any
 
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
executing on anything else other than
 
00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:51.909 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:22:51.909 --> 00:22:51.919 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
those three those three bills on the
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
first two three days dimension on the
 
00:22:59.270 --> 00:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
tuesday wednesday thursday it will be
 
00:23:01.669 --> 00:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
exacting as i've mentioned
 
00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
then looking at
 
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
we'll work together we'll we'll continue
 
00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
working like we're working
 
00:23:12.149 --> 00:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
then going on into the next week the
 
00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
week of the 28th that's the week that
 
00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:16.720 align:start position:0%
i'm not scheduling anything it'll be a
 
00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:22.789 --> 00:23:22.799 align:start position:0%
i have uh
 
00:23:24.549 --> 00:23:24.559 align:start position:0%
uh trustee meetings with the university
 
00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
system all day and the third and the
 
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
fourth so i wouldn't be here for those
 
00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:28.470 align:start position:0%
fourth so i wouldn't be here for those
anyways

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:28.480 align:start position:0%
anyways
 
00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:29.270 align:start position:0%
anyways
um

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
but so the 28th if you have to make book
 
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
a reservation or something i know it's
 
00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:35.200 align:start position:0%
late to be booking now but that's you
 
00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
know we've been trying to do the best we
 
00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
can and figure out
 
00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
uh what holes we might have
 
00:23:45.669 --> 00:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
then uh going on forward
 
00:23:48.789 --> 00:23:48.799 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to have available
 
00:23:48.799 --> 00:23:49.669 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to have available
the

00:23:49.669 --> 00:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
seventh eighth ninth and the half day on
 
00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
the 10th for exacting quite possibly
 
00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:56.549 align:start position:0%
the 10th for exacting quite possibly
um

00:23:56.549 --> 00:23:56.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:56.559 --> 00:23:58.070 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
if we take that break it means we're
 
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
going to have approximately seven and a
 
00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
half days to execute the bills which we
 
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
have left and that's probably about uh
 
00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:08.240 align:start position:0%
three-quarters of the bills that we have
 
00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
left after today it may be less than
 
00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:11.269 align:start position:0%
left after today it may be less than
that

00:24:11.269 --> 00:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:24:15.029 --> 00:24:15.039 align:start position:0%
so we may not need it but
 
00:24:17.269 --> 00:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
we have those days available to to
 
00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
really capture everything yes
 
00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
how many bills do we have left to here
 
00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
we have the uh bills which were doing on
 
00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
the 15th which were the carryover from
 
00:24:31.269 --> 00:24:31.279 align:start position:0%
the fourth right then we had those three
 
00:24:31.279 --> 00:24:33.430 align:start position:0%
the fourth right then we had those three
bills

00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
um that i just alluded to
 
00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
11 31 1371 and 11 41. that's it that's
 
00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
it we're done
 
00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
we've heard here
 
00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
thank you you know other than what we're
 
00:24:47.029 --> 00:24:47.039 align:start position:0%
doing today
 
00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
you know we have another one coming up
 
00:24:50.549 --> 00:24:50.559 align:start position:0%
here at 12 22 which we haven't heard yet
 
00:24:50.559 --> 00:24:51.430 align:start position:0%
here at 12 22 which we haven't heard yet
either

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
and that's an early bill
 
00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:54.149 align:start position:0%
and that's an early bill
so

00:24:54.149 --> 00:24:54.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
so we could quite possibly be you know
 
00:24:58.230 --> 00:24:58.240 align:start position:0%
we will probably be executing that bill
 
00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
along with everything else today
 
00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
um we could even do it right after
 
00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
depending upon how fast we get through
 
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:12.400 align:start position:0%
yeah there there's um
 
00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
yes yes that's correct
 
00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
so that's that's where we are on
 
00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
on uh our scheduling our calendar i just
 
00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
want everybody to realize that the 28th
 
00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:41.669 --> 00:25:41.679 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
so we have now a break of about 20
 
00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:45.200 align:start position:0%
minutes here
 
00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
which we will take as a break
 
00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:48.950 align:start position:0%
which we will take as a break
and

00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:51.269 --> 00:25:51.279 align:start position:0%
be ready to go at uh
 
00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
did everybody get a copy of the flow
 
00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.590 align:start position:0%
did everybody get a copy of the flow
chart

00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
i have circulated to you the statement
 
00:47:25.829 --> 00:47:25.839 align:start position:0%
that i submitted to ols
 
00:47:27.589 --> 00:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
and for this bill
 
00:47:30.549 --> 00:47:30.559 align:start position:0%
and it speaks much more clearly to the
 
00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill than the bill finally
 
00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
emerged from the machinery
 
00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
as a legal
 
00:47:39.109 --> 00:47:39.119 align:start position:0%
sort of bill
 
00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
and uh i would ask you to to read that
 
00:47:45.109 --> 00:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
so i i'm not going to repeat it all to
 
00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
you except to say that
 
00:47:50.069 --> 00:47:50.079 align:start position:0%
the intent of this bill is to protect
 
00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
the academic integrity
 
00:47:55.829 --> 00:47:55.839 align:start position:0%
of the process of education
 
00:47:58.950 --> 00:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
as well as to protect the student
 
00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
from being abused by people whose
 
00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:03.430 align:start position:0%
from being abused by people whose
self-interests

00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
self-interests
 
00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:04.829 align:start position:0%
self-interests
are

00:48:04.829 --> 00:48:04.839 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
somehow thought better
 
00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
than the students welfare
 
00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
i have experienced this in several
 
00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:13.750 align:start position:0%
i have experienced this in several
states

00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
i have not experienced it in new
 
00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:17.589 align:start position:0%
i have not experienced it in new
hampshire

00:48:17.589 --> 00:48:17.599 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
and some people think well if it hasn't
 
00:48:21.109 --> 00:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
happened here
 
00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
why what do you want a bill
 
00:48:26.549 --> 00:48:26.559 align:start position:0%
to prevent it from happening here
 
00:48:29.109 --> 00:48:29.119 align:start position:0%
in one word
 
00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
i had a classmate in college who could
 
00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
completed every cl course the student
 
00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:38.640 align:start position:0%
university had at the 100 level
 
00:48:40.549 --> 00:48:40.559 align:start position:0%
and then he got in his red corvette and
 
00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
that's not why we have universities
 
00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
we're not a training ground for
 
00:48:52.069 --> 00:48:52.079 align:start position:0%
professional sports
 
00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
this is to educate people for a fruitful
 
00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:56.630 align:start position:0%
this is to educate people for a fruitful
life

00:48:56.630 --> 00:48:56.640 align:start position:0%
life
 
00:48:59.109 --> 00:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
and anybody who interferes with that
 
00:49:01.109 --> 00:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
might as well be breaking one of their
 
00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
arms or something else in an academic or
 
00:49:06.309 --> 00:49:06.319 align:start position:0%
intellectual sense because they're
 
00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
denying them the education
 
00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
which will provide their livelihood
 
00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
throughout their life
 
00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
it's like theft
 
00:49:19.349 --> 00:49:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:21.349 --> 00:49:21.359 align:start position:0%
i was in the office one day when one of
 
00:49:23.589 --> 00:49:23.599 align:start position:0%
my office mates was talking to an
 
00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
assistant coach
 
00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:27.200 align:start position:0%
and all of a sudden there was an uproar
 
00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
and she picked up her book bag
 
00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
and began beating the man about the head
 
00:49:34.069 --> 00:49:34.079 align:start position:0%
and shoulders and chased him out of the
 
00:49:36.549 --> 00:49:36.559 align:start position:0%
building using language i never heard
 
00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:41.190 align:start position:0%
 
why

00:49:41.190 --> 00:49:41.200 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
he had she he had asked her to change
 
00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
the grade of a student athlete
 
00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
so that he would remain eligible to play
 
00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:50.470 align:start position:0%
so that he would remain eligible to play
sports

00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
sports
 
00:49:52.950 --> 00:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
apparently not aware that her own
 
00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:54.069 align:start position:0%
apparently not aware that her own
husband

00:49:54.069 --> 00:49:54.079 align:start position:0%
husband
 
00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:56.240 align:start position:0%
worked at a local roadhouse as a
 
00:49:59.030 --> 00:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
bartender because he had never completed
 
00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
his degree
 
00:50:04.790 --> 00:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:07.349 --> 00:50:07.359 align:start position:0%
it's that kind of travesty that should
 
00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
not occur
 
00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
and yet someone who i don't know for
 
00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
whatever personal reasons maybe just an
 
00:50:16.950 --> 00:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
art and booster of the home team
 
00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
to put it most polite face on it
 
00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
will say to a student
 
00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
oh maybe we can work out a summer job
 
00:50:26.549 --> 00:50:26.559 align:start position:0%
for you or something but you need to
 
00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
concentrate on football
 
00:50:32.069 --> 00:50:32.079 align:start position:0%
i was told recently in new hampshire by
 
00:50:34.870 --> 00:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
a man who had played ball out of state
 
00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
gone on to a pro career and then
 
00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
terminated it
 
00:50:41.589 --> 00:50:41.599 align:start position:0%
that the coach at st norbert said
 
00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
i know the
 
00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
orientation people tell you you're here
 
00:50:47.109 --> 00:50:47.119 align:start position:0%
to work on your uh when you're on campus
 
00:50:49.349 --> 00:50:49.359 align:start position:0%
you should focus on academics but i'm
 
00:50:51.030 --> 00:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
here to tell you when you're on campus
 
00:50:55.270 --> 00:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:57.430 --> 00:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
do we want people saying that to our
 
00:50:59.430 --> 00:50:59.440 align:start position:0%
students in new hampshire
 
00:51:03.109 --> 00:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
i mean football is fun and all that but
 
00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
it's not why we send our kids to college
 
00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
and that's why this bill is here
 
00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:11.680 align:start position:0%
it's a preventive field
 
00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
i don't know anyone who's done it i
 
00:51:15.190 --> 00:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
can't point and say this person did that
 
00:51:16.870 --> 00:51:16.880 align:start position:0%
no i can't
 
00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
but i can't point you i know i had to
 
00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
fire an athletic director and and
 
00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:22.960 align:start position:0%
of coach
 
00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
for taking a letter that i had to sign
 
00:51:28.069 --> 00:51:28.079 align:start position:0%
offering admission to football players
 
00:51:31.349 --> 00:51:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:33.430 --> 00:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
and they wrote across the top of the
 
00:51:35.430 --> 00:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
letter after they got it back with my
 
00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:37.589 align:start position:0%
letter after they got it back with my
signature

00:51:37.589 --> 00:51:37.599 align:start position:0%
signature
 
00:51:39.589 --> 00:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
don't worry about this housing business
 
00:51:43.349 --> 00:51:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:45.109 --> 00:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
and that was not part of our agreement
 
00:51:47.589 --> 00:51:47.599 align:start position:0%
we were not that kind of a team
 
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
they were plainly lying to the students
 
00:51:52.549 --> 00:51:52.559 align:start position:0%
and the rumor had it and they could
 
00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
never prove it but they were telling the
 
00:51:56.710 --> 00:51:56.720 align:start position:0%
students in the middle of a minnesota
 
00:51:56.720 --> 00:51:58.230 align:start position:0%
students in the middle of a minnesota
winter

00:51:58.230 --> 00:51:58.240 align:start position:0%
winter
 
00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
oh really
 
00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
is that what you want to be in the
 
00:52:10.309 --> 00:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:12.069 --> 00:52:12.079 align:start position:0%
i don't think so
 
00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
questions thank you are there questions
 
00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
for our representative yes
 
00:52:24.790 --> 00:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative four you
 
00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
have the penalty for this to be a felony
 
00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
which is a pretty high bar felonies are
 
00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
usually reserved for
 
00:52:37.589 --> 00:52:37.599 align:start position:0%
extreme violent crimes murder
 
00:52:39.510 --> 00:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
you know even assault those kinds of
 
00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:40.309 align:start position:0%
you know even assault those kinds of
things

00:52:40.309 --> 00:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
and what made you decide to go for a
 
00:52:45.349 --> 00:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
felony it's also by i might add
 
00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
something that really is a kind of a
 
00:52:49.109 --> 00:52:49.119 align:start position:0%
heavy duty lift for the prosecutors in
 
00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:52.640 align:start position:0%
the courts so there's a significant cost
 
00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
to this and any case that may be brought
 
00:52:58.069 --> 00:52:58.079 align:start position:0%
again i'm wondering why a felony
 
00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
my legal background is limited i have
 
00:53:03.829 --> 00:53:03.839 align:start position:0%
represented clients in felony courses in
 
00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
the military court system
 
00:53:09.670 --> 00:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
and i won even with a signed confession
 
00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:10.630 align:start position:0%
and i won even with a signed confession
so

00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:10.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:53:13.109 --> 00:53:13.119 align:start position:0%
i know how serious that is
 
00:53:15.430 --> 00:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
it's exactly the seriousness of it that
 
00:53:18.069 --> 00:53:18.079 align:start position:0%
i want to convey how important it is it
 
00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:20.720 align:start position:0%
perhaps is overstated there was some
 
00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
back and forth about should it be a
 
00:53:25.510 --> 00:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
felony or not and i said i just think it
 
00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
ought to be something that makes people
 
00:53:28.870 --> 00:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
say oh i'm not going to do that if i'm
 
00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
going to have to pay 50 fine well well
 
00:53:32.870 --> 00:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
maybe i'll do that
 
00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
and i that was that was the intent it
 
00:53:38.309 --> 00:53:38.319 align:start position:0%
may be overstated and it certainly
 
00:53:39.589 --> 00:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
would welcome a
 
00:53:41.829 --> 00:53:41.839 align:start position:0%
an amendment if that would
 
00:53:41.839 --> 00:53:42.630 align:start position:0%
an amendment if that would
yes

00:53:42.630 --> 00:53:42.640 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:53:44.950 --> 00:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
are you aware that a class a misdemeanor
 
00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:47.200 align:start position:0%
has a year imprisonment associate or can
 
00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
have a year imprisonment associated with
 
00:53:51.589 --> 00:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
it so no i'm not so even a cl even a
 
00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:53.200 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor could potentially put
 
00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
somebody in jail for this i'm wondering
 
00:53:56.309 --> 00:53:56.319 align:start position:0%
if you would find that to be enough
 
00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
about oh yes oh yes i i i stand
 
00:54:02.549 --> 00:54:02.559 align:start position:0%
ready to and welcoming for
 
00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:04.720 align:start position:0%
all meaningful kinds of adjustments like
 
00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:05.589 align:start position:0%
all meaningful kinds of adjustments like
that

00:54:05.589 --> 00:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:54:06.549 --> 00:54:06.559 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:54:10.150 --> 00:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
question um in our code of conduct
 
00:54:16.790 --> 00:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
book that
 
00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
was developed here in new hampshire
 
00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:22.790 align:start position:0%
was developed here in new hampshire
in

00:54:22.790 --> 00:54:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:26.230 --> 00:54:26.240 align:start position:0%
principle 3 on page 14
 
00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
and principle 3 is
 
00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility to the school community
 
00:54:32.950 --> 00:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
it says in fulfilling the
 
00:54:35.109 --> 00:54:35.119 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to the school community
 
00:54:36.870 --> 00:54:36.880 align:start position:0%
a credential holder
 
00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
shall communicate responsibly
 
00:54:40.950 --> 00:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
among members of the school community
 
00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
while maintaining appropriate
 
00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:44.240 align:start position:0%
professional boundaries
 
00:54:46.630 --> 00:54:46.640 align:start position:0%
and part four that is
 
00:54:49.990 --> 00:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
intentional uh prohibited
 
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:50.950 align:start position:0%
intentional uh prohibited
uh

00:54:50.950 --> 00:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
let's see unprofessional conduct shall
 
00:54:56.230 --> 00:54:56.240 align:start position:0%
include but not be limited to in section
 
00:54:58.470 --> 00:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
four is intentionally altering or
 
00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
misrepresenting student assessments
 
00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
assessment results or official school
 
00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:04.710 align:start position:0%
assessment results or official school
records

00:55:04.710 --> 00:55:04.720 align:start position:0%
records
 
00:55:07.589 --> 00:55:07.599 align:start position:0%
and this code of conduct can result in a
 
00:55:09.829 --> 00:55:09.839 align:start position:0%
teacher losing their credentials
 
00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
um i don't know if you're aware or not
 
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:13.750 align:start position:0%
um i don't know if you're aware or not
but

00:55:13.750 --> 00:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:55:16.069 --> 00:55:16.079 align:start position:0%
at least in the public schools and i'm
 
00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
not speaking at college because that's
 
00:55:19.829 --> 00:55:19.839 align:start position:0%
kind of your purview but in the public
 
00:55:19.839 --> 00:55:21.430 align:start position:0%
kind of your purview but in the public
schools

00:55:21.430 --> 00:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
grading is pretty much a local issue
 
00:55:25.190 --> 00:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
grades and
 
00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:26.309 align:start position:0%
grades and
and

00:55:26.309 --> 00:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:55:28.390 --> 00:55:28.400 align:start position:0%
the competencies are made at the local
 
00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:29.190 align:start position:0%
the competencies are made at the local
level

00:55:29.190 --> 00:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:55:31.589 --> 00:55:31.599 align:start position:0%
uh teachers are the people who are
 
00:55:33.910 --> 00:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
responsible for
 
00:55:35.829 --> 00:55:35.839 align:start position:0%
giving an appropriate grade to the
 
00:55:37.349 --> 00:55:37.359 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh
 
00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
you know testing results or their their
 
00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
participation or whatever
 
00:55:43.349 --> 00:55:43.359 align:start position:0%
and i understand
 
00:55:45.670 --> 00:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
i underst i totally understand
 
00:55:48.069 --> 00:55:48.079 align:start position:0%
the frustration and the
 
00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
perhaps anger
 
00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
at athletes that um or coaches i i'd say
 
00:55:55.349 --> 00:55:55.359 align:start position:0%
more coaches that try to get favor for
 
00:55:57.829 --> 00:55:57.839 align:start position:0%
their their athletes
 
00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
what i've seen and i guess this is a
 
00:56:02.470 --> 00:56:02.480 align:start position:0%
would you believe what i've seen more is
 
00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
that coaches will go to teachers where a
 
00:56:06.870 --> 00:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
student is not doing well and ask what
 
00:56:08.789 --> 00:56:08.799 align:start position:0%
can they do to help this student get a
 
00:56:11.030 --> 00:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
better grade
 
00:56:13.510 --> 00:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
and it used to be that the nhiaa the new
 
00:56:15.190 --> 00:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire interscholastic athletic
 
00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:16.549 align:start position:0%
hampshire interscholastic athletic
association

00:56:16.549 --> 00:56:16.559 align:start position:0%
association
 
00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
had a standard that students had to be
 
00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:19.670 align:start position:0%
had a standard that students had to be
passing

00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
passing
 
00:56:21.670 --> 00:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
a certain number of courses in order to
 
00:56:24.630 --> 00:56:24.640 align:start position:0%
participate on class on sports teams and
 
00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:26.240 align:start position:0%
that's been waived a little bit for
 
00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:27.990 align:start position:0%
that's been waived a little bit for
homeschoolers

00:56:27.990 --> 00:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers
 
00:56:29.270 --> 00:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
because they don't
 
00:56:32.309 --> 00:56:32.319 align:start position:0%
have like four classes to to do it but
 
00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm thinking
 
00:56:35.589 --> 00:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
uh again i was going to ask you the same
 
00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
question that uh representative walsh
 
00:56:39.430 --> 00:56:39.440 align:start position:0%
asked you that don't you think that
 
00:56:40.789 --> 00:56:40.799 align:start position:0%
felony is like
 
00:56:42.710 --> 00:56:42.720 align:start position:0%
just not even a
 
00:56:44.789 --> 00:56:44.799 align:start position:0%
hammer instead of a flyswatter it's like
 
00:56:48.309 --> 00:56:48.319 align:start position:0%
a sledgehammer um i think it's really
 
00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
uh something that maybe
 
00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
maybe you can reconsider and i think
 
00:56:54.549 --> 00:56:54.559 align:start position:0%
you've already answered that but i'll
 
00:56:56.549 --> 00:56:56.559 align:start position:0%
ask it again without that i was not
 
00:56:59.109 --> 00:56:59.119 align:start position:0%
aware of that handbook but i would ask
 
00:57:00.789 --> 00:57:00.799 align:start position:0%
you um
 
00:57:03.270 --> 00:57:03.280 align:start position:0%
what's the real penalty and if if it
 
00:57:05.430 --> 00:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't convey with the idea that if you
 
00:57:07.670 --> 00:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
do this you will be fired
 
00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
you know that's sort of the the thing
 
00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
that i'm going to say that the teacher
 
00:57:13.349 --> 00:57:13.359 align:start position:0%
has some protection
 
00:57:15.030 --> 00:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
and going and saying this person
 
00:57:16.789 --> 00:57:16.799 align:start position:0%
approached me and asked me to change the
 
00:57:19.030 --> 00:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
game because what does the teacher have
 
00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:19.829 align:start position:0%
game because what does the teacher have
if

00:57:19.829 --> 00:57:19.839 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
some major benefactor or whatever sidles
 
00:57:24.710 --> 00:57:24.720 align:start position:0%
up to them and said boy it would really
 
00:57:27.829 --> 00:57:27.839 align:start position:0%
help if he had a passing grade and
 
00:57:30.309 --> 00:57:30.319 align:start position:0%
what does the teacher do
 
00:57:32.549 --> 00:57:32.559 align:start position:0%
i mean they're caught in a bind
 
00:57:35.109 --> 00:57:35.119 align:start position:0%
and and maybe this is a person who can
 
00:57:37.109 --> 00:57:37.119 align:start position:0%
affect the university in some
 
00:57:38.630 --> 00:57:38.640 align:start position:0%
significant way
 
00:57:40.710 --> 00:57:40.720 align:start position:0%
and so that's what i'm trying to do is
 
00:57:42.870 --> 00:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
protect teachers and students to keep
 
00:57:46.549 --> 00:57:46.559 align:start position:0%
that decision entirely to them in k-12
 
00:57:47.750 --> 00:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
of course you have to involve the
 
00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:49.109 align:start position:0%
of course you have to involve the
parents

00:57:49.109 --> 00:57:49.119 align:start position:0%
parents
 
00:57:51.349 --> 00:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
thank you but that that's where i'm
 
00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:53.680 align:start position:0%
coming from amendments that make this
 
00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
better and acknowledge that no problem
 
00:57:57.589 --> 00:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
at all
 
00:57:58.710 --> 00:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
i welcome
 
00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:00.950 align:start position:0%
i welcome
woodcock

woodcock
 
00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:02.720 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
00:58:04.069 --> 00:58:04.079 align:start position:0%
ford thank you so much for taking my
 
00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
question i
 
00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
um i was had the opportunity to briefly
 
00:58:10.230 --> 00:58:10.240 align:start position:0%
read the uh the missives that you passed
 
00:58:13.270 --> 00:58:13.280 align:start position:0%
out before the meeting and i i wonder if
 
00:58:15.670 --> 00:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
you have it in front of you
 
00:58:17.589 --> 00:58:17.599 align:start position:0%
i like you in front of you the
 
00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
document you passed out
 
00:58:23.030 --> 00:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
i know you have one okay if i may i'd
 
00:58:24.630 --> 00:58:24.640 align:start position:0%
like you to turn to the last paragraph
 
00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
of the last second page
 
00:58:29.030 --> 00:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
i have i have no question about your
 
00:58:30.870 --> 00:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
intent to maintain
 
00:58:33.670 --> 00:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
athletic integrity uh at the high school
 
00:58:35.670 --> 00:58:35.680 align:start position:0%
and the college level
 
00:58:39.109 --> 00:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
my concern is particularly a concern is
 
00:58:39.119 --> 00:58:39.910 align:start position:0%
my concern is particularly a concern is
the

00:58:39.910 --> 00:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:40.960 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:58:44.549 --> 00:58:44.559 align:start position:0%
realistic uh applicability uh in high
 
00:58:46.870 --> 00:58:46.880 align:start position:0%
school in particular in new hampshire
 
00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:47.750 align:start position:0%
school in particular in new hampshire
uh

00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:58:49.910 --> 00:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
where we have you're talking about the
 
00:58:51.109 --> 00:58:51.119 align:start position:0%
last sentence talked about allowing
 
00:58:52.950 --> 00:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
coaches to be the primary instructors on
 
00:58:56.390 --> 00:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:58.470 --> 00:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
for years and years and years we've
 
00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
asked for schools to create teacher
 
00:59:03.270 --> 00:59:03.280 align:start position:0%
coaches teacher coaches teacher coaches
 
00:59:04.950 --> 00:59:04.960 align:start position:0%
so they can look for the well-being of
 
00:59:07.430 --> 00:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
youngsters oversee them uh make sure
 
00:59:08.870 --> 00:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
that they're in school give them all
 
00:59:10.950 --> 00:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
those types of motivations not to negate
 
00:59:13.589 --> 00:59:13.599 align:start position:0%
their grades but to do that uh
 
00:59:15.030 --> 00:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
and then we've lost part of that over
 
00:59:16.470 --> 00:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
the years because there's no stipends
 
00:59:18.069 --> 00:59:18.079 align:start position:0%
there's too much work yeah yeah and now
 
00:59:19.589 --> 00:59:19.599 align:start position:0%
we never know what we get
 
00:59:19.599 --> 00:59:20.710 align:start position:0%
we never know what we get
but

00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:20.720 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:59:22.309 --> 00:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
every once in a while we get a great one
 
00:59:24.069 --> 00:59:24.079 align:start position:0%
a teacher coach and i'm thinking
 
00:59:25.829 --> 00:59:25.839 align:start position:0%
particularly in the school where i come
 
00:59:27.589 --> 00:59:27.599 align:start position:0%
from where i used to work
 
00:59:29.750 --> 00:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
we have one of our
 
00:59:33.109 --> 00:59:33.119 align:start position:0%
best mathematics teachers superb
 
00:59:34.870 --> 00:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
teaches all our high level mathematic
 
00:59:36.150 --> 00:59:36.160 align:start position:0%
classes the probability of statistics
 
00:59:38.789 --> 00:59:38.799 align:start position:0%
the trigger the big stuff safety classes
 
00:59:40.630 --> 00:59:40.640 align:start position:0%
he happens to be one of our athletic
 
00:59:43.270 --> 00:59:43.280 align:start position:0%
coaches and he's been there a long time
 
00:59:44.549 --> 00:59:44.559 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:59:46.549 --> 00:59:46.559 align:start position:0%
by this this
 
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:48.720 align:start position:0%
last sentence saying that if you can't
 
00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
be a you shouldn't have him as a primary
 
00:59:51.910 --> 00:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
instructor throughout the athletes
 
00:59:54.390 --> 00:59:54.400 align:start position:0%
program of studies our options are we
 
00:59:57.109 --> 00:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
take a superb human being a coach
 
00:59:59.109 --> 00:59:59.119 align:start position:0%
and stop that or we take a youngster
 
01:00:00.789 --> 01:00:00.799 align:start position:0%
who's trying to get advanced mathematics
 
01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:02.640 align:start position:0%
and the school is limited and stop that
 
01:00:06.309 --> 01:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
i mean i find this as a as as um
 
01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
a problem
 
01:00:10.069 --> 01:00:10.079 align:start position:0%
in terms of of this proposed bill and
 
01:00:11.589 --> 01:00:11.599 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
that that part particularly concerns me
 
01:00:20.549 --> 01:00:20.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:22.789 --> 01:00:22.799 align:start position:0%
that's an interesting situation to be in
 
01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:24.640 align:start position:0%
and i commend the school for its good
 
01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:26.870 align:start position:0%
and i commend the school for its good
fortune

01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
fortune
 
01:00:28.630 --> 01:00:28.640 align:start position:0%
i've not experienced that i've
 
01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
experienced like in my own high school
 
01:00:33.910 --> 01:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
uh where i went to our second largest
 
01:00:35.829 --> 01:00:35.839 align:start position:0%
high school in louisiana
 
01:00:35.839 --> 01:00:36.789 align:start position:0%
high school in louisiana
and

01:00:36.789 --> 01:00:36.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:00:40.789 --> 01:00:40.799 align:start position:0%
one coach taught all athletes
 
01:00:40.799 --> 01:00:42.789 align:start position:0%
one coach taught all athletes
mathematics

01:00:42.789 --> 01:00:42.799 align:start position:0%
mathematics
 
01:00:44.470 --> 01:00:44.480 align:start position:0%
now there's something
 
01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:47.200 align:start position:0%
statistically impossible about that
 
01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:49.030 align:start position:0%
statistically impossible about that
equation

01:00:49.030 --> 01:00:49.040 align:start position:0%
equation
 
01:00:51.030 --> 01:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
and the only reason it was
 
01:00:52.789 --> 01:00:52.799 align:start position:0%
i'm sure
 
01:00:54.470 --> 01:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
it wasn't said
 
01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:55.670 align:start position:0%
it wasn't said
but

01:00:55.670 --> 01:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:00:57.190 --> 01:00:57.200 align:start position:0%
they went to somebody who was
 
01:00:59.750 --> 01:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
sympathetic with the athletics
 
01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
ability to stay or athlete's ability to
 
01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:04.640 align:start position:0%
stay eligible and had him teach the
 
01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
courts it's in his self-interest
 
01:01:09.270 --> 01:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
that they passed and that's an
 
01:01:11.349 --> 01:01:11.359 align:start position:0%
impossible teach situation to put a
 
01:01:13.589 --> 01:01:13.599 align:start position:0%
teacher in
 
01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
follow up chairman laughing mate yes
 
01:01:15.599 --> 01:01:16.470 align:start position:0%
follow up chairman laughing mate yes
okay

01:01:16.470 --> 01:01:16.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:17.430 align:start position:0%
okay
um

01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
and let me give you another for instance
 
01:01:20.549 --> 01:01:20.559 align:start position:0%
in in our teacher coaching scenario and
 
01:01:22.069 --> 01:01:22.079 align:start position:0%
i understand and
 
01:01:23.349 --> 01:01:23.359 align:start position:0%
i think there's a significant difference
 
01:01:23.359 --> 01:01:24.230 align:start position:0%
i think there's a significant difference
between

01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:01:27.030 --> 01:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
the uh collegiate level and the high
 
01:01:29.109 --> 01:01:29.119 align:start position:0%
school level in terms of eligibility and
 
01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
and and that that type of influence
 
01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
clearly there aren't any benefactors
 
01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
that uh you know growth and high uh
 
01:01:36.789 --> 01:01:36.799 align:start position:0%
spending thousands of dollars so a
 
01:01:38.549 --> 01:01:38.559 align:start position:0%
youngster could play a ball on one of
 
01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
those things but i just i'm looking here
 
01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:41.109 align:start position:0%
those things but i just i'm looking here
at

01:01:41.109 --> 01:01:41.119 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:01:43.829 --> 01:01:43.839 align:start position:0%
a teacher coach in the school made you
 
01:01:45.430 --> 01:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
as uh representative tan i was talking
 
01:01:47.190 --> 01:01:47.200 align:start position:0%
about and i know when i was uh doing
 
01:01:49.349 --> 01:01:49.359 align:start position:0%
that as a teacher coach
 
01:01:51.430 --> 01:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
i would have my student athletes take a
 
01:01:53.589 --> 01:01:53.599 align:start position:0%
wander a weekly or two weekly report for
 
01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
each class the teachers sign up how
 
01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
they're doing or they're there
 
01:01:57.990 --> 01:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
not at the chance for the teacher to say
 
01:01:59.829 --> 01:01:59.839 align:start position:0%
oh these guys are playing ball or this
 
01:02:01.349 --> 01:02:01.359 align:start position:0%
but rather to make sure that this young
 
01:02:03.349 --> 01:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
stuff it continues to continue to
 
01:02:05.270 --> 01:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
participate academically and not
 
01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
fluffing off kind of things now i would
 
01:02:08.789 --> 01:02:08.799 align:start position:0%
i would
 
01:02:11.910 --> 01:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
think that under this particular bill uh
 
01:02:14.309 --> 01:02:14.319 align:start position:0%
and as the intent that you had here some
 
01:02:16.950 --> 01:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
could assume then that i was putting
 
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
pressure on that teacher by letting them
 
01:02:20.309 --> 01:02:20.319 align:start position:0%
know that i'm having this youngster walk
 
01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
and ask you to sign the sheet that
 
01:02:23.270 --> 01:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
they're passing i mean that could be is
 
01:02:25.510 --> 01:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
that possible
 
01:02:26.710 --> 01:02:26.720 align:start position:0%
a reasonable
 
01:02:28.950 --> 01:02:28.960 align:start position:0%
not reasonable it's possible
 
01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:30.309 align:start position:0%
not reasonable it's possible
uh

01:02:30.309 --> 01:02:30.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:02:31.990 --> 01:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
as a principle
 
01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
i would think you know you had plenty of
 
01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:36.240 align:start position:0%
cover in that sense against an
 
01:02:38.549 --> 01:02:38.559 align:start position:0%
accusation of that simply because you
 
01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:41.200 align:start position:0%
organize a system to support the student
 
01:02:44.069 --> 01:02:44.079 align:start position:0%
and make academic success that's that's
 
01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:45.280 align:start position:0%
the kind of
 
01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
reaction and structural uh consideration
 
01:02:51.589 --> 01:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
i would like given to this issue is
 
01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
first the impetus is is the athlete
 
01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:56.230 align:start position:0%
first the impetus is is the athlete
perceive

01:02:56.230 --> 01:02:56.240 align:start position:0%
perceive
 
01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
proceeding reasonably toward graduation
 
01:03:02.309 --> 01:03:02.319 align:start position:0%
and it is the intent first that the
 
01:03:04.390 --> 01:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
student graduate and then that they play
 
01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:06.880 align:start position:0%
sports behind
 
01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you chairman i
 
01:03:09.270 --> 01:03:09.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you very much
 
01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
01:03:13.349 --> 01:03:13.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
01:03:13.359 --> 01:03:14.630 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
representative

01:03:14.630 --> 01:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:15.750 align:start position:0%
representative
um

01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:18.870 --> 01:03:18.880 align:start position:0%
this does this bill is written to affect
 
01:03:22.390 --> 01:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
elementary and secondary as well
 
01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering if in this scenario
 
01:03:29.270 --> 01:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
what the ramifications might be
 
01:03:32.069 --> 01:03:32.079 align:start position:0%
of a parent coming into a teacher
 
01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
and asking the teacher to change the
 
01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:35.589 align:start position:0%
and asking the teacher to change the
grade

01:03:35.589 --> 01:03:35.599 align:start position:0%
grade
 
01:03:39.190 --> 01:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason for their child
 
01:03:42.309 --> 01:03:42.319 align:start position:0%
would the teacher need to report the
 
01:03:45.109 --> 01:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
parent to the police
 
01:03:47.029 --> 01:03:47.039 align:start position:0%
um in order for the
 
01:03:49.270 --> 01:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
how would that work if the parent did it
 
01:03:52.150 --> 01:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
would the parent face a felony charge
 
01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
my how i i just oh i'm sorry that's okay
 
01:03:56.829 --> 01:03:56.839 align:start position:0%
i thought you had
 
01:03:59.190 --> 01:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
finished my apology
 
01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:00.230 align:start position:0%
finished my apology
uh

01:04:00.230 --> 01:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:04:02.230 --> 01:04:02.240 align:start position:0%
my simple answer is no
 
01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
because the parent has an interest but
 
01:04:06.630 --> 01:04:06.640 align:start position:0%
when the parents ask the teacher to
 
01:04:08.950 --> 01:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
change the grade
 
01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
the teacher's response should be
 
01:04:14.470 --> 01:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
that's an improper request to make
 
01:04:17.109 --> 01:04:17.119 align:start position:0%
i will do everything i can to help your
 
01:04:19.589 --> 01:04:19.599 align:start position:0%
student i'll work with a tutor or i'll
 
01:04:21.990 --> 01:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
give him extra assignments or whatever
 
01:04:23.349 --> 01:04:23.359 align:start position:0%
it might be
 
01:04:26.710 --> 01:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
but i don't just change grades because
 
01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:27.589 align:start position:0%
but i don't just change grades because
it's

01:04:27.589 --> 01:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:04:30.150 --> 01:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
in someone else's opinion
 
01:04:32.230 --> 01:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of the students
 
01:04:35.270 --> 01:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
this is my grade it means something
 
01:04:37.750 --> 01:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
but if i read your bill correctly
 
01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
because the parent had asked
 
01:04:43.430 --> 01:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
that person who requests
 
01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:44.309 align:start position:0%
that person who requests
this

01:04:44.309 --> 01:04:44.319 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:04:45.829 --> 01:04:45.839 align:start position:0%
needs to be
 
01:04:45.839 --> 01:04:47.029 align:start position:0%
needs to be
reported

01:04:47.029 --> 01:04:47.039 align:start position:0%
reported
 
01:04:49.029 --> 01:04:49.039 align:start position:0%
and then the thing i handed out to you
 
01:04:51.910 --> 01:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
it says the instructor under supervision
 
01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
of an administrator and or counselor
 
01:04:57.670 --> 01:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
the student and in a formal grade review
 
01:05:01.270 --> 01:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
process the parents of a k-12 student
 
01:05:03.349 --> 01:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
are the only persons who should be
 
01:05:05.829 --> 01:05:05.839 align:start position:0%
involved in the final discussions of the
 
01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
student's grade
 
01:05:09.990 --> 01:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
that's what i put when i submitted this
 
01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
for a bill
 
01:05:14.470 --> 01:05:14.480 align:start position:0%
the parents have a right to say and yes
 
01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
they might ask that you say look i
 
01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
understand your concern my concern is
 
01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
that the student finished the grade
 
01:05:22.309 --> 01:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
knowing what the student needs to know
 
01:05:24.150 --> 01:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
to go to the next grade
 
01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
so let's work on improving his academic
 
01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:28.150 align:start position:0%
so let's work on improving his academic
performance

01:05:28.150 --> 01:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
performance
 
01:05:30.309 --> 01:05:30.319 align:start position:0%
and not just changing the grade
 
01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:37.109 --> 01:05:37.119 align:start position:0%
representative ford i i have a would you
 
01:05:39.029 --> 01:05:39.039 align:start position:0%
believe and i'm gonna follow up a little
 
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
bit where represent porter is right now
 
01:05:44.470 --> 01:05:44.480 align:start position:0%
um as a school principal for all those
 
01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:45.910 align:start position:0%
um as a school principal for all those
years

01:05:45.910 --> 01:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:05:48.549 --> 01:05:48.559 align:start position:0%
i've had to go through the process of
 
01:05:51.510 --> 01:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
changing grades let would you believe
 
01:05:53.190 --> 01:05:53.200 align:start position:0%
that we have teachers
 
01:05:54.549 --> 01:05:54.559 align:start position:0%
that retire
 
01:05:56.630 --> 01:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
teachers that leave the school system at
 
01:05:58.230 --> 01:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
the end of the year to have a vacation
 
01:06:00.710 --> 01:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
they may leave a little bit early yeah
 
01:06:03.270 --> 01:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
um they may be sick and not there for
 
01:06:05.270 --> 01:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
the closing days
 
01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:06.230 align:start position:0%
the closing days
and

01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:08.240 align:start position:0%
grades sometimes have to be changed for
 
01:06:09.990 --> 01:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
various reasons would you believe that
 
01:06:12.150 --> 01:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
there are reasons that
 
01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
go along i wrote down a few of them that
 
01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
there's makeup work that comes in
 
01:06:18.390 --> 01:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
there's a a teacher may have given an
 
01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:19.670 align:start position:0%
there's a a teacher may have given an
incomplete

01:06:19.670 --> 01:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
incomplete
 
01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
and all of a sudden in the the
 
01:06:23.829 --> 01:06:23.839 align:start position:0%
alternative program the grades come in
 
01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
and there's need for a change there
 
01:06:28.390 --> 01:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
there may be a medical issue associated
 
01:06:30.789 --> 01:06:30.799 align:start position:0%
a long-term medical issue associated
 
01:06:33.109 --> 01:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
with the student the list is just
 
01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
horrendous yes and there can be
 
01:06:37.589 --> 01:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
mathematical errors in the inputting of
 
01:06:39.990 --> 01:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
grades and we all do that
 
01:06:42.870 --> 01:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
i understand so then the under this
 
01:06:45.349 --> 01:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
though to change that grade
 
01:06:47.750 --> 01:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
of the instructor who hasn't given
 
01:06:50.150 --> 01:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
permission to change that grade
 
01:06:52.230 --> 01:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
is oftentimes done in schools i've had
 
01:06:54.789 --> 01:06:54.799 align:start position:0%
my guidance counselor do it i've had the
 
01:06:58.150 --> 01:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
myself do it where it's necessary to
 
01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
change that grade the transcript and
 
01:07:02.230 --> 01:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
which is shoved off to college is going
 
01:07:03.910 --> 01:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
to reflect something which is not
 
01:07:06.069 --> 01:07:06.079 align:start position:0%
actuality there was something that
 
01:07:07.589 --> 01:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
didn't come in that should be part of
 
01:07:09.829 --> 01:07:09.839 align:start position:0%
that grade so would you believe by
 
01:07:12.630 --> 01:07:12.640 align:start position:0%
entering in uh elementary and secondary
 
01:07:14.710 --> 01:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
education this we're kind of mixing
 
01:07:17.029 --> 01:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
apples and oranges
 
01:07:18.870 --> 01:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
with something that
 
01:07:21.510 --> 01:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
may or may not be happening even in our
 
01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
higher education programs well
 
01:07:26.630 --> 01:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
that came from an excess of zeal on my
 
01:07:29.109 --> 01:07:29.119 align:start position:0%
part and you'll notice in the title
 
01:07:31.349 --> 01:07:31.359 align:start position:0%
academic integrity and student
 
01:07:34.390 --> 01:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
protection act i did not envision the
 
01:07:37.270 --> 01:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
scenario you have just tried i agree you
 
01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
need to it needs to be amended to
 
01:07:41.910 --> 01:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
include administrative decisions to
 
01:07:44.470 --> 01:07:44.480 align:start position:0%
award grades under the school's normal
 
01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:45.670 align:start position:0%
award grades under the school's normal
processes

01:07:45.670 --> 01:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
processes
 
01:07:47.910 --> 01:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
something as simple as that and i think
 
01:07:49.430 --> 01:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
that would protect the people you're
 
01:07:51.670 --> 01:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
talking about but yes that's a valid
 
01:07:53.829 --> 01:07:53.839 align:start position:0%
reason to change a grade by someone
 
01:07:56.789 --> 01:07:56.799 align:start position:0%
other than the instructor and i think it
 
01:07:59.750 --> 01:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
should be provided protection under this
 
01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:01.190 align:start position:0%
should be provided protection under this
bill

01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
thank you are there further questions
 
01:08:03.589 --> 01:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative
 
01:08:05.270 --> 01:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
moffitt thank you michelle thank you for
 
01:08:08.470 --> 01:08:08.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question i went to kvc in to a
 
01:08:10.470 --> 01:08:10.480 align:start position:0%
college basketball player and the
 
01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
college basketball coach came to me and
 
01:08:15.029 --> 01:08:15.039 align:start position:0%
he didn't ask me to change the grade to
 
01:08:17.590 --> 01:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
a c plus he just explained that
 
01:08:20.550 --> 01:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
this player would now be ineligible
 
01:08:22.070 --> 01:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
would have to move out of the dorm and
 
01:08:24.070 --> 01:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
would probably have to leave school so
 
01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
could i just
 
01:08:25.199 --> 01:08:26.149 align:start position:0%
could i just
re

01:08:26.149 --> 01:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
re
 
01:08:28.309 --> 01:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
revisit my grading formula and run the
 
01:08:29.749 --> 01:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
numbers again
 
01:08:29.759 --> 01:08:30.709 align:start position:0%
numbers again
so

01:08:30.709 --> 01:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:08:30.719 --> 01:08:32.070 align:start position:0%
so
uh

01:08:32.070 --> 01:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:08:35.430 --> 01:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
looking at line 14 my question is would
 
01:08:38.470 --> 01:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
he or i be guilty of you know
 
01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
he tried to persuade me to revisit my
 
01:08:43.669 --> 01:08:43.679 align:start position:0%
calculation of the student's grade
 
01:08:46.870 --> 01:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
uh so would i having done what i did and
 
01:08:49.510 --> 01:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
listen to him and ran the numbers again
 
01:08:51.910 --> 01:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
would i be guilty of that class b felony
 
01:08:54.789 --> 01:08:54.799 align:start position:0%
would i have been or he potentially
 
01:08:56.950 --> 01:08:56.960 align:start position:0%
potentially and
 
01:08:58.950 --> 01:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
what i would suggest is the way to
 
01:09:01.990 --> 01:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
handle that sort of situation is to take
 
01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
that problem back to someone in the
 
01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
administration like your dean and say
 
01:09:09.189 --> 01:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
this is an unintended consequence of
 
01:09:11.829 --> 01:09:11.839 align:start position:0%
this is there any way we can
 
01:09:14.950 --> 01:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
mitigate this without having to corrupt
 
01:09:18.309 --> 01:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
representative nelson
 
01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
01:09:26.070 --> 01:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question is there any warning
 
01:09:28.309 --> 01:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
in this thing or it's immediately the
 
01:09:31.030 --> 01:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
coach is fired well i i figured that the
 
01:09:33.910 --> 01:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
promulgation of it and put out there
 
01:09:37.269 --> 01:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
should serve as a warning not to do it
 
01:09:39.749 --> 01:09:39.759 align:start position:0%
most of the egregious offenders i've
 
01:09:41.349 --> 01:09:41.359 align:start position:0%
encountered were either
 
01:09:41.359 --> 01:09:43.269 align:start position:0%
encountered were either
overzealous

01:09:43.269 --> 01:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
overzealous
 
01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
boosters of one sort or another and some
 
01:09:48.789 --> 01:09:48.799 align:start position:0%
assistant coaches undoubtedly sent out
 
01:09:51.349 --> 01:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
by the head coach
 
01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
yes there should be i think a warning
 
01:09:55.669 --> 01:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
but there should also be a promulgation
 
01:09:58.390 --> 01:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
of it this is the law of the land now
 
01:09:59.910 --> 01:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
don't do this
 
01:10:02.149 --> 01:10:02.159 align:start position:0%
and notify people put it out there
 
01:10:03.990 --> 01:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
discuss it say we're going to protect
 
01:10:06.630 --> 01:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
the students academic integrity and the
 
01:10:09.430 --> 01:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
teacher's right to or to award a grade
 
01:10:11.110 --> 01:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
that was earned
 
01:10:12.950 --> 01:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
i don't think you come down wrong when
 
01:10:15.189 --> 01:10:15.199 align:start position:0%
you say that just when you
 
01:10:17.110 --> 01:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
i would agree that the punishments that
 
01:10:19.590 --> 01:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
came out in the bill are
 
01:10:22.229 --> 01:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
probably too heavy thank you
 
01:10:25.669 --> 01:10:25.679 align:start position:0%
further questions represent lakas
 
01:10:27.830 --> 01:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm just looking at the language on
 
01:10:30.390 --> 01:10:30.400 align:start position:0%
the definition of instructor
 
01:10:32.310 --> 01:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
any full-time or part-time employee
 
01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
working as a substitute or adjunct
 
01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
teacher or administrator and i don't
 
01:10:40.790 --> 01:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
know all of the proper titles of
 
01:10:42.630 --> 01:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
people but
 
01:10:44.390 --> 01:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
it seems like
 
01:10:46.390 --> 01:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
and maybe i'm misunderstanding but it
 
01:10:49.070 --> 01:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
just seems like that eliminates
 
01:10:51.590 --> 01:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
professors or
 
01:10:53.430 --> 01:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
01:10:54.550 --> 01:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
full tilt
 
01:10:57.110 --> 01:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
instructor is a double meaning word it
 
01:10:59.590 --> 01:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
is an academic rank in college but it's
 
01:11:02.229 --> 01:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
also anyone who teaches
 
01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
so it can mean both and perhaps i was
 
01:11:06.550 --> 01:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
not as careful in delineating that
 
01:11:10.470 --> 01:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:13.189 --> 01:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
but it means that anybody who owes an
 
01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
academic position the vulnerability of
 
01:11:18.229 --> 01:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
many instructors is that they're
 
01:11:20.630 --> 01:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
temporary they're part-time one semester
 
01:11:22.630 --> 01:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
one year and
 
01:11:24.950 --> 01:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
their concern of course is having worked
 
01:11:26.470 --> 01:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
for next semester
 
01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
so if they get into some kind of a haha
 
01:11:31.270 --> 01:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
and they don't have any kind of backing
 
01:11:32.229 --> 01:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
for it
 
01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
you may find the coach saying we don't
 
01:11:37.189 --> 01:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
want them on the faculty and coach has
 
01:11:38.950 --> 01:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
tenure the coach makes more than the
 
01:11:42.310 --> 01:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
president you know uh
 
01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:43.750 align:start position:0%
president you know uh
so

01:11:43.750 --> 01:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:11:46.149 --> 01:11:46.159 align:start position:0%
so were you were
 
01:11:48.950 --> 01:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
so you weren't intentionally limiting it
 
01:11:51.669 --> 01:11:51.679 align:start position:0%
to them no it's just that that's the way
 
01:11:54.149 --> 01:11:54.159 align:start position:0%
they wrote it for you i was inclusively
 
01:11:57.270 --> 01:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
including them okay thank you
 
01:11:59.350 --> 01:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
01:12:04.870 --> 01:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:10.229 --> 01:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:13.669 --> 01:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
we have a card from tom cronin
 
01:12:15.669 --> 01:12:15.679 align:start position:0%

government relations for uh the
 
01:12:23.270 --> 01:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
university system thank you for the
 
01:12:24.709 --> 01:12:24.719 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be here on house bill
 
01:12:24.719 --> 01:12:26.630 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be here on house bill
1222.

01:12:26.630 --> 01:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
1222.
 
01:12:29.189 --> 01:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
uh so i think you know we certainly
 
01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
appreciate understand uh where the
 
01:12:33.830 --> 01:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
sponsor is coming from on this uh we you
 
01:12:37.189 --> 01:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
know as institutions um you know we are
 
01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
committed to honest fair clear grading
 
01:12:41.669 --> 01:12:41.679 align:start position:0%
practices um
 
01:12:43.750 --> 01:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
academic honesty is a core value for all
 
01:12:45.590 --> 01:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
of our institute all of our institutions
 
01:12:47.669 --> 01:12:47.679 align:start position:0%
as it should be that said we do have a
 
01:12:49.110 --> 01:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
number of concerns with at least how the
 
01:12:50.870 --> 01:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
bill is drafted i do appreciate
 
01:12:53.030 --> 01:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
representative ford uh sharing the
 
01:12:54.709 --> 01:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
couple page document of what he perhaps
 
01:12:58.149 --> 01:12:58.159 align:start position:0%
submitted to legislative services that
 
01:12:59.910 --> 01:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
maybe explains some of the concerns we
 
01:13:01.350 --> 01:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
have but i thought i'd run through them
 
01:13:02.950 --> 01:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
quickly and then of course be happy to
 
01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
take any questions so certainly a topic
 
01:13:07.990 --> 01:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
that's come up already uh the
 
01:13:09.830 --> 01:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
sort of the definition about
 
01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:10.630 align:start position:0%
sort of the definition about
uh

01:13:10.630 --> 01:13:10.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:13:12.470 --> 01:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
the activities that would violate this
 
01:13:14.709 --> 01:13:14.719 align:start position:0%
law uh we're most concerned about the
 
01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
use of the word persuade or otherwise
 
01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:18.390 align:start position:0%
use of the word persuade or otherwise
interfere

01:13:18.390 --> 01:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
interfere
 
01:13:20.390 --> 01:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
certainly we have a grading appeals
 
01:13:22.790 --> 01:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
process that is at its core the goal of
 
01:13:24.870 --> 01:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
that is to persuade someone that you did
 
01:13:27.110 --> 01:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh better in the class than the person
 
01:13:29.830 --> 01:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
graded you on um otherwise interfere is
 
01:13:31.990 --> 01:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
obviously quite vague in terms of how
 
01:13:33.270 --> 01:13:33.280 align:start position:0%
that could
 
01:13:35.189 --> 01:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
be interpreted
 
01:13:37.510 --> 01:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
um second just a question about
 
01:13:39.590 --> 01:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
the way educational institution is
 
01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:40.709 align:start position:0%
the way educational institution is
defined

01:13:40.709 --> 01:13:40.719 align:start position:0%
defined
 
01:13:43.910 --> 01:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
public or elementary secondary et cetera
 
01:13:45.830 --> 01:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
i guess our thought on that would be if
 
01:13:47.669 --> 01:13:47.679 align:start position:0%
the legislature agreed with the
 
01:13:49.110 --> 01:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
necessity of including this in the
 
01:13:50.229 --> 01:13:50.239 align:start position:0%
criminal code that it really should
 
01:13:52.070 --> 01:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
apply to all of the states colleges and
 
01:13:56.149 --> 01:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
universities not just uh usnh and ccsnh
 
01:13:57.590 --> 01:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh and i think our colleagues would
 
01:13:59.590 --> 01:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
agree that academic honesty is equally
 
01:14:01.030 --> 01:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
as important at their institutions as
 
01:14:02.790 --> 01:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
well but i think they'd also share some
 
01:14:04.630 --> 01:14:04.640 align:start position:0%
of our concerns uh with how the bill is
 
01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:05.990 align:start position:0%
of our concerns uh with how the bill is
drafted

01:14:05.990 --> 01:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
drafted
 
01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:06.950 align:start position:0%
drafted
um

01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:08.229 --> 01:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
class b felony has already been
 
01:14:10.149 --> 01:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh we agree that that appears
 
01:14:13.110 --> 01:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
to be an incredibly punitive penalty uh
 
01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
in this case we'd also point out that
 
01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
for faculty under contract i think we'd
 
01:14:19.110 --> 01:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
be concerned about some of the required
 
01:14:21.030 --> 01:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
suspension and other language that's
 
01:14:22.149 --> 01:14:22.159 align:start position:0%
included in the law and that would
 
01:14:24.229 --> 01:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
probably be contrary to collectively
 
01:14:25.910 --> 01:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
bargained discipline and grievance
 
01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:27.510 align:start position:0%
bargained discipline and grievance
procedures

01:14:27.510 --> 01:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
procedures
 
01:14:29.350 --> 01:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
and really i think finally
 
01:14:30.790 --> 01:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
our question would just be is this
 
01:14:32.070 --> 01:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
really necessary i think our
 
01:14:34.390 --> 01:14:34.400 align:start position:0%
institutions have both cultures and
 
01:14:36.550 --> 01:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
processes in place that dissuade this
 
01:14:39.189 --> 01:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
behavior um and then have steps to
 
01:14:41.110 --> 01:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
appropriately address it should there be
 
01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:43.280 align:start position:0%
reports that need to be looked into and
 
01:14:45.669 --> 01:14:45.679 align:start position:0%
i think that's why uh we should be proud
 
01:14:47.430 --> 01:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
that this isn't an instance that has
 
01:14:49.510 --> 01:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
happened at colleges universities in the
 
01:14:50.870 --> 01:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
state um
 
01:14:52.550 --> 01:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
so i think with that i would close and
 
01:14:53.910 --> 01:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
would just be happy to answer any
 
01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:54.870 align:start position:0%
would just be happy to answer any
questions

01:14:54.870 --> 01:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:14:56.550 --> 01:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there questions
 
01:14:58.390 --> 01:14:58.400 align:start position:0%
representative tanner
 
01:14:59.830 --> 01:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:00.790 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

01:15:00.790 --> 01:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:15:03.590 --> 01:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
um if the student at the university
 
01:15:06.070 --> 01:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
system is 18 or older
 
01:15:07.990 --> 01:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
can the parents really be involved in
 
01:15:11.110 --> 01:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
the grade discussion without the
 
01:15:13.669 --> 01:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
student's permission
 
01:15:15.030 --> 01:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
no it's certainly not without the
 
01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
student's permission i will say there is
 
01:15:20.229 --> 01:15:20.239 align:start position:0%
uh a process through the grading appeals
 
01:15:20.239 --> 01:15:21.189 align:start position:0%
uh a process through the grading appeals
uh

01:15:21.189 --> 01:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:15:24.310 --> 01:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
framework that does allow students to uh
 
01:15:26.229 --> 01:15:26.239 align:start position:0%
bring in an advisor to perhaps attest to
 
01:15:27.910 --> 01:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
his or her work in the case of a
 
01:15:29.350 --> 01:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
graduate student they're allowed to
 
01:15:31.030 --> 01:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
bring in a member of the community who
 
01:15:32.630 --> 01:15:32.640 align:start position:0%
may have worked with them so there are
 
01:15:34.870 --> 01:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
actually other people outside of even
 
01:15:36.390 --> 01:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
the framework that representative ford
 
01:15:38.709 --> 01:15:38.719 align:start position:0%
presents in his couple page document
 
01:15:40.390 --> 01:15:40.400 align:start position:0%
that at least in our appeals process are
 
01:15:42.630 --> 01:15:42.640 align:start position:0%
allowed to be engaged in attempting to
 
01:15:44.149 --> 01:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
persuade a faculty member to change a
 
01:15:44.159 --> 01:15:45.430 align:start position:0%
persuade a faculty member to change a
grade

01:15:45.430 --> 01:15:45.440 align:start position:0%

student privacy that if a student
 
01:15:55.030 --> 01:15:55.040 align:start position:0%

01:15:57.510 --> 01:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
older and they do not wish to have a
 
01:16:00.149 --> 01:16:00.159 align:start position:0%
discussion about their grades
 
01:16:02.229 --> 01:16:02.239 align:start position:0%

01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
like they are crossing a line or nearing
 
01:16:56.550 --> 01:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
a line to get clarity um
 
01:16:56.560 --> 01:16:57.350 align:start position:0%

be asking and leading us at a path we
 
01:17:04.870 --> 01:17:04.880 align:start position:0%

01:18:13.270 --> 01:18:13.280 align:start position:0%

new hampshire

what i did hear is over 75
 
01:18:28.709 --> 01:18:28.719 align:start position:0%

as new hampshire citizens that said
 
01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:34.470 align:start position:0%
as new hampshire citizens that said
that

01:18:34.470 --> 01:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:18:36.149 --> 01:18:36.159 align:start position:0%
there is a problem with our school
 
01:18:38.630 --> 01:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
systems they have been
 
01:18:42.149 --> 01:18:42.159 align:start position:0%
that that we need parental rights
 
01:18:43.910 --> 01:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
and that we don't have
 
01:18:47.430 --> 01:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
they ex there's policies and procedures
 
01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
but those are being violated
 
01:18:51.350 --> 01:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
excuse me this is not a parent rights
 
01:18:54.470 --> 01:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
bill correct changing a grade
 
01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:55.189 align:start position:0%
bill correct changing a grade
so

01:18:55.189 --> 01:18:55.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:18:57.350 --> 01:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
what i'm what i'm trying to get at is
 
01:19:00.229 --> 01:19:00.239 align:start position:0%
this bill this bill says
 
01:19:02.149 --> 01:19:02.159 align:start position:0%
um all schools
 
01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
universities elementary schools middle
 
01:19:06.550 --> 01:19:06.560 align:start position:0%
schools if anyone
 
01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:07.750 align:start position:0%
schools if anyone
has

01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:19:10.630 --> 01:19:10.640 align:start position:0%
has has coerced or changed a student's
 
01:19:13.350 --> 01:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
grade then they there should be a
 
01:19:15.750 --> 01:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
significant penalty for that that's the
 
01:19:17.750 --> 01:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
reason why i support this bill is
 
01:19:19.750 --> 01:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
because this bill is again about our
 
01:19:22.790 --> 01:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
children and their rights and if their
 
01:19:24.790 --> 01:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
if their rights are being violated
 
01:19:27.590 --> 01:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
regardless of what age there should be
 
01:19:30.550 --> 01:19:30.560 align:start position:0%
severe and swift consequences
 
01:19:32.070 --> 01:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
but i just wanted to make you folks
 
01:19:35.110 --> 01:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
aware that parents really are feeling
 
01:19:37.270 --> 01:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
that they don't have a say in what's
 
01:19:39.830 --> 01:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
happening in their school system
 
01:19:42.070 --> 01:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
and this bill would
 
01:19:44.950 --> 01:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
would put some responsibility on the
 
01:19:47.030 --> 01:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
administration my opinion
 
01:19:47.990 --> 01:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
that's all
 
01:19:49.110 --> 01:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:50.870 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
committee

01:19:50.870 --> 01:19:50.880 align:start position:0%

are there any other folks that like to
 
01:19:58.470 --> 01:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
testify in this particular bill
 
01:19:59.830 --> 01:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying we will close this
 
01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:02.310 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying we will close this
hearing

01:20:02.310 --> 01:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
and we're going to be taking a break now
 
01:20:06.950 --> 01:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to go into caucuses
 
01:20:11.030 --> 01:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:11.910 align:start position:0%

01:23:40.870 --> 01:23:40.880 align:start position:0%

02:06:21.669 --> 02:06:21.679 align:start position:0%
um i i conclude from our discussion this
 
02:06:24.790 --> 02:06:24.800 align:start position:0%
morning that um it the bill needs a lot
 
02:06:26.069 --> 02:06:26.079 align:start position:0%

and

02:06:27.109 --> 02:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:06:29.430 --> 02:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
it does not necessarily reflect the
 
02:06:32.069 --> 02:06:32.079 align:start position:0%
intent of the
 
02:06:35.350 --> 02:06:35.360 align:start position:0%

uh thank you mr chairman um
 
02:09:57.830 --> 02:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
i think that there are um
 
02:10:00.870 --> 02:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
issues with this bill
 
02:10:03.189 --> 02:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
02:10:03.199 --> 02:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
in terms of
the

02:10:03.360 --> 02:10:03.370 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:10:03.370 --> 02:10:06.550 align:start position:0%
the
[Music]

02:10:06.550 --> 02:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:06.560 --> 02:10:07.910 align:start position:0%

02:10:07.910 --> 02:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
tax
 
02:10:09.510 --> 02:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
property tax
 
02:10:09.520 --> 02:10:12.830 align:start position:0%

02:10:12.830 --> 02:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:15.830 --> 02:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
i think it is um
 
02:10:17.750 --> 02:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
a change to the
 
02:10:20.709 --> 02:10:20.719 align:start position:0%
uh way that the
 
02:10:22.709 --> 02:10:22.719 align:start position:0%
education freedom accounts
 
02:10:24.870 --> 02:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
are appropriated
 
02:10:24.880 --> 02:10:26.149 align:start position:0%
are appropriated
and

02:10:26.149 --> 02:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:10:27.830 --> 02:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
i do not think it is in the best
 
02:10:30.470 --> 02:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
interest of the program or the children
 
02:10:33.109 --> 02:10:33.119 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh is there anything
 
02:10:34.390 --> 02:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
from the
 
02:10:38.790 --> 02:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:45.189 --> 02:10:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:47.109 --> 02:10:47.119 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
02:10:48.629 --> 02:10:48.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair members of the
 
02:10:48.639 --> 02:10:49.589 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair members of the
committee

02:10:49.589 --> 02:10:49.599 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:10:52.709 --> 02:10:52.719 align:start position:0%
i will be voting against the itl
 
02:10:55.189 --> 02:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
i do believe that using local property
 
02:10:56.870 --> 02:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
taxes to pay
 
02:10:59.990 --> 02:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
for education at religious schools
 
02:11:02.870 --> 02:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
is unconstitutional according to article
 
02:11:06.390 --> 02:11:06.400 align:start position:0%
6 part 1 article 6 in the bill of rights
 
02:11:08.870 --> 02:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire constitution
 
02:11:11.750 --> 02:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
i also believe that if we start using
 
02:11:15.109 --> 02:11:15.119 align:start position:0%
locally raised property taxes to fund
 
02:11:17.030 --> 02:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
these other programs it's a slippery
 
02:11:17.040 --> 02:11:18.069 align:start position:0%
these other programs it's a slippery
slope

02:11:18.069 --> 02:11:18.079 align:start position:0%
slope
 
02:11:20.470 --> 02:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
and eventually property taxpayers will
 
02:11:20.480 --> 02:11:21.430 align:start position:0%
and eventually property taxpayers will
be

02:11:21.430 --> 02:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:11:24.950 --> 02:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
burdened beyond belief um to keep all
 
02:11:27.589 --> 02:11:27.599 align:start position:0%
these different and various
 
02:11:30.069 --> 02:11:30.079 align:start position:0%
educational opportunities running for
 
02:11:32.870 --> 02:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
everyone in the state so i urge you to
 
02:11:35.189 --> 02:11:35.199 align:start position:0%

02:11:35.199 --> 02:11:36.149 align:start position:0%
think carefully about what you're doing
here

02:11:36.149 --> 02:11:36.159 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:11:37.430 --> 02:11:37.440 align:start position:0%

thank you very much mr chair uh i think
 
02:11:51.030 --> 02:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
house bill 1516 simply protects
 
02:11:54.390 --> 02:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
uh local property taxpayers from from um
 
02:11:55.910 --> 02:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
from having
 
02:11:57.669 --> 02:11:57.679 align:start position:0%
their money used
 
02:12:00.229 --> 02:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
uh for these uh for these purposes and
 
02:12:02.790 --> 02:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
uh it is it is simply about protecting
 
02:12:05.510 --> 02:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
local property taxpayers
 
02:12:07.189 --> 02:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion
 
02:12:08.790 --> 02:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock thank you
 
02:12:10.870 --> 02:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
chairman ladd um i would concur on the
 
02:12:10.880 --> 02:12:11.990 align:start position:0%
chairman ladd um i would concur on the
eye

02:12:11.990 --> 02:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
eye
 
02:12:13.589 --> 02:12:13.599 align:start position:0%
on the uh
 
02:12:15.510 --> 02:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
motion as representative porter was
 
02:12:15.520 --> 02:12:16.709 align:start position:0%
motion as representative porter was
suggesting

02:12:16.709 --> 02:12:16.719 align:start position:0%
suggesting
 
02:12:18.629 --> 02:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
uh when this spill initially went
 
02:12:20.310 --> 02:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
through the back duo we've been talking
 
02:12:22.550 --> 02:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
about that it was going to be from ed
 
02:12:25.030 --> 02:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
trust fund we've all continued here in
 
02:12:27.030 --> 02:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
this state property tax property tax
 
02:12:29.030 --> 02:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
property tax and we know that the bulk
 
02:12:31.030 --> 02:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
of property tax is the schools
 
02:12:32.709 --> 02:12:32.719 align:start position:0%
so least we can do is keep where we put
 
02:12:34.629 --> 02:12:34.639 align:start position:0%
it initially so it doesn't go back to
 
02:12:36.310 --> 02:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
local property taxes and continue to
 
02:12:39.030 --> 02:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
increase the local taxpayers this is
 
02:12:41.030 --> 02:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
this has the potential to slide in the
 
02:12:43.030 --> 02:12:43.040 align:start position:0%

against the motion i'm sorry against the
 
02:13:00.790 --> 02:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
motion um this is has the potential of
 
02:13:03.669 --> 02:13:03.679 align:start position:0%
taking local tax dollars
 
02:13:06.390 --> 02:13:06.400 align:start position:0%
out of the community
 
02:13:08.310 --> 02:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
and spending it on
 
02:13:10.629 --> 02:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
areas where there's uh
 
02:13:13.350 --> 02:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
questionable accountability
 
02:13:15.189 --> 02:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
and questionable accountability both
 
02:13:17.350 --> 02:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
financially and academically
 
02:13:19.109 --> 02:13:19.119 align:start position:0%
for the use of this
 
02:13:21.270 --> 02:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
it also drains money local tax money
 
02:13:21.280 --> 02:13:22.149 align:start position:0%
it also drains money local tax money
from

02:13:22.149 --> 02:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:13:22.159 --> 02:13:23.350 align:start position:0%
from
the

02:13:23.350 --> 02:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
the

infrastructure that's built for
 
02:13:28.229 --> 02:13:28.239 align:start position:0%

i too will be voting no on the motion of

itl i believe this will raise local
 
02:13:38.550 --> 02:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
property taxes and i think we're wrong
 
02:13:40.550 --> 02:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
to be uh downshifting to the local
 
02:13:42.950 --> 02:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
property taxes so i will vote no

if you can get those done electronically
 
02:15:21.750 --> 02:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
there they didn't give us any of the
 
02:15:24.470 --> 02:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
handwritten forms we we have
 
02:15:27.109 --> 02:15:27.119 align:start position:0%
a forum which is um
 
02:15:28.310 --> 02:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
i think you've seen it they're not the
 
02:15:30.629 --> 02:15:30.639 align:start position:0%
yellow and blue sheets
 
02:15:32.950 --> 02:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's a form like this now
 
02:15:36.550 --> 02:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
uh if you don't have a computer or that
 
02:15:38.390 --> 02:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
use this but we would prefer if
 
02:15:40.310 --> 02:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
everything came in electronically due to
 
02:15:41.990 --> 02:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
the earliness of these bills and they
 
02:15:43.910 --> 02:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
have to be in by tomorrow and it just
 
02:15:46.229 --> 02:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
saves lindsay a lot of work down in the
 
02:15:50.629 --> 02:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
office so could lindsay email that or um
 
02:15:53.669 --> 02:15:53.679 align:start position:0%
jen email a copy of that document again
 
02:15:56.390 --> 02:15:56.400 align:start position:0%

02:15:58.310 --> 02:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
we get that done i don't see jen here
 
02:16:00.149 --> 02:16:00.159 align:start position:0%

02:16:06.790 --> 02:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:09.750 --> 02:16:09.760 align:start position:0%

02:16:22.350 --> 02:16:22.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:25.270 --> 02:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
1657 establishes a new hampshire farm to
 
02:16:28.470 --> 02:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
school reimbursement program
 
02:16:30.870 --> 02:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
and i look to uh
 
02:16:34.389 --> 02:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
represent bone for a recommendation or
 
02:16:39.190 --> 02:16:39.200 align:start position:0%
motion i move itl on 1657.
 
02:16:40.950 --> 02:16:40.960 align:start position:0%
is there any other
 
02:16:43.110 --> 02:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
02:16:45.990 --> 02:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
repress i'll second thank you
 
02:16:47.830 --> 02:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
representative do you care to speak to
 
02:16:50.549 --> 02:16:50.559 align:start position:0%
the your motion yes as we heard from the
 
02:16:52.549 --> 02:16:52.559 align:start position:0%
commissioner yesterday and
 
02:16:54.070 --> 02:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
for the first time probably i've ever
 
02:16:56.150 --> 02:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
agreed with him but anyway
 
02:16:57.990 --> 02:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
we won't go there no
 
02:17:00.549 --> 02:17:00.559 align:start position:0%
anyway yeah the thing is we don't live
 
02:17:04.309 --> 02:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
in a except for a few items farm produce
 
02:17:06.870 --> 02:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
is not available year round
 
02:17:09.110 --> 02:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
also the initial cost
 
02:17:13.190 --> 02:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
um the cost to do 600 000
 
02:17:14.870 --> 02:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh it's
 
02:17:14.880 --> 02:17:15.669 align:start position:0%
uh it's
way

02:17:15.669 --> 02:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
way
 
02:17:17.669 --> 02:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
too much so
 
02:17:19.910 --> 02:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
to me local school districts can can
 
02:17:22.549 --> 02:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
already and they already do it contract
 
02:17:25.270 --> 02:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
or buy produce from their local farms
 
02:17:27.509 --> 02:17:27.519 align:start position:0%
and i don't think we need this bill
 
02:17:29.429 --> 02:17:29.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:17:33.190 --> 02:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
further discussion from represent lacus
 
02:17:36.150 --> 02:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
just that the setup costs are so high in
 
02:17:37.910 --> 02:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
the amount that each school is going to
 
02:17:40.150 --> 02:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
get is so low that i don't think it's
 
02:17:43.270 --> 02:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
going to be enough to encourage them to
 
02:17:45.030 --> 02:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
start up or make that much difference so
 
02:17:46.549 --> 02:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
we're going to go to this huge setup
 
02:17:48.870 --> 02:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
cost and then not really do much with it
 
02:17:49.910 --> 02:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:17:51.270 --> 02:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
further discussion from the committee
 
02:17:52.629 --> 02:17:52.639 align:start position:0%
representative luno
 
02:17:55.429 --> 02:17:55.439 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair so
 
02:17:57.190 --> 02:17:57.200 align:start position:0%
we did hear from the uh from the
 
02:18:00.469 --> 02:18:00.479 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh yesterday uh very a
 
02:18:03.110 --> 02:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
little bit on this bill and i think his
 
02:18:06.070 --> 02:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
his words were it's a great idea but it
 
02:18:07.429 --> 02:18:07.439 align:start position:0%
needs more work
 
02:18:09.990 --> 02:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
and i agree with uh with
 
02:18:12.309 --> 02:18:12.319 align:start position:0%
with what he said and
 
02:18:14.230 --> 02:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
it's a great idea it needs more work and
 
02:18:15.990 --> 02:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
i think a motion of interim study would
 
02:18:18.230 --> 02:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
actually be much more suitable
 
02:18:20.150 --> 02:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
for for this bill
 
02:18:22.389 --> 02:18:22.399 align:start position:0%
when we uh when we look at what we heard
 
02:18:22.399 --> 02:18:23.349 align:start position:0%
when we uh when we look at what we heard
from

02:18:23.349 --> 02:18:23.359 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:18:25.270 --> 02:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
for for testimony
 
02:18:28.549 --> 02:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
it was uh it was extensive as far as as
 
02:18:30.950 --> 02:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
far as how this would be
 
02:18:32.870 --> 02:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
good for students good for nutrition and
 
02:18:35.349 --> 02:18:35.359 align:start position:0%
good for new hampshire's um
 
02:18:35.359 --> 02:18:36.709 align:start position:0%
good for new hampshire's um
agriculture

02:18:36.709 --> 02:18:36.719 align:start position:0%
agriculture
 
02:18:39.990 --> 02:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
industry are the dollars huge no they're
 
02:18:41.509 --> 02:18:41.519 align:start position:0%
not it's twelve hundred dollars per
 
02:18:43.509 --> 02:18:43.519 align:start position:0%
school i think is the reimbursement
 
02:18:45.910 --> 02:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
amount so given the fact that it is a
 
02:18:48.549 --> 02:18:48.559 align:start position:0%
reimbursement program it's not quite
 
02:18:50.709 --> 02:18:50.719 align:start position:0%
like what uh representative baum said
 
02:18:52.549 --> 02:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
that that school districts can do this
 
02:18:54.709 --> 02:18:54.719 align:start position:0%
already yes school districts can buy for
 
02:18:56.549 --> 02:18:56.559 align:start position:0%
farms already but they don't get
 
02:18:58.629 --> 02:18:58.639 align:start position:0%
reimbursed um and i think the
 
02:19:01.110 --> 02:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rate is is a third of the
 
02:19:03.910 --> 02:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
cost when uh when it comes from one of
 
02:19:05.030 --> 02:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:19:07.429 --> 02:19:07.439 align:start position:0%
the farms located here in new hampshire
 
02:19:09.910 --> 02:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
it does have a um
 
02:19:11.349 --> 02:19:11.359 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note
 
02:19:13.190 --> 02:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
uh of six hundred thousand dollars in
 
02:19:16.150 --> 02:19:16.160 align:start position:0%
appropriations uh to the department for
 
02:19:18.629 --> 02:19:18.639 align:start position:0%
uh for reimbursing schools is that going
 
02:19:20.629 --> 02:19:20.639 align:start position:0%
to change the uh the calculus when it
 
02:19:22.309 --> 02:19:22.319 align:start position:0%
comes to any of these local new
 
02:19:25.750 --> 02:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire farms probably not but um but
 
02:19:27.910 --> 02:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
it's 600 thousand dollars in business
 
02:19:29.669 --> 02:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
it's 600 000
 
02:19:32.389 --> 02:19:32.399 align:start position:0%
that helps nutrition for um for school
 
02:19:34.549 --> 02:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
kids and it's six hundred thousand
 
02:19:37.589 --> 02:19:37.599 align:start position:0%
dollars that that actually will will
 
02:19:40.790 --> 02:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
will probably result in um in a lot of
 
02:19:43.030 --> 02:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
recognition about this program and
 
02:19:44.709 --> 02:19:44.719 align:start position:0%
possibly even a greater understanding of
 
02:19:47.349 --> 02:19:47.359 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's agricultural heritage so
 
02:19:49.190 --> 02:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
for that reason i certainly can't
 
02:19:51.429 --> 02:19:51.439 align:start position:0%
support an itl but i would cert i would
 
02:19:55.510 --> 02:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:58.630 --> 02:19:58.640 align:start position:0%
so i'll go ahead reps and like us
 
02:20:01.110 --> 02:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
can we change the motion to interim
 
02:20:03.670 --> 02:20:03.680 align:start position:0%
study no we have a motion on the table
 
02:20:04.790 --> 02:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:20:04.800 --> 02:20:08.070 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

02:20:08.070 --> 02:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:11.590 --> 02:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
i'd like to speak for a second um we
 
02:20:13.190 --> 02:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
have another bill that we'll be
 
02:20:15.429 --> 02:20:15.439 align:start position:0%
discussing that's not an early bill
 
02:20:18.790 --> 02:20:18.800 align:start position:0%
which we are looking at interim study
 
02:20:20.870 --> 02:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh dealing with meals
 
02:20:20.880 --> 02:20:21.750 align:start position:0%
uh dealing with meals
um

02:20:21.750 --> 02:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:23.990 --> 02:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
we are in a situation where this
 
02:20:25.750 --> 02:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
committee has a huge number of bills
 
02:20:28.230 --> 02:20:28.240 align:start position:0%
this year we're going into a summer
 
02:20:29.750 --> 02:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
which is the summer which there's not
 
02:20:30.870 --> 02:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
going to be a whole lot of studying
 
02:20:32.389 --> 02:20:32.399 align:start position:0%
going on seeing that
 
02:20:34.630 --> 02:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of people be campaigning
 
02:20:34.640 --> 02:20:35.429 align:start position:0%
a lot of people be campaigning
um

02:20:35.429 --> 02:20:35.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:37.510 --> 02:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
we we uh
 
02:20:39.429 --> 02:20:39.439 align:start position:0%
there the intent of the bill there's
 
02:20:40.790 --> 02:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
some really wonderful parts on the
 
02:20:42.630 --> 02:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
commission would enlighten us that maybe
 
02:20:44.469 --> 02:20:44.479 align:start position:0%
we'd be better even looking at a pilot
 
02:20:46.710 --> 02:20:46.720 align:start position:0%
program where we can sprinkle a few more
 
02:20:49.429 --> 02:20:49.439 align:start position:0%
dollars out to specific schools and and
 
02:20:49.439 --> 02:20:50.389 align:start position:0%
dollars out to specific schools and and
and

02:20:50.389 --> 02:20:50.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:20:53.110 --> 02:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
try to see if this has some worth to it
 
02:20:56.950 --> 02:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
there's also question what is local
 
02:20:58.710 --> 02:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
and that was a question of stuff that's
 
02:21:00.230 --> 02:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
grown in the state but taken out and
 
02:21:01.750 --> 02:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
processed somewhere else and matched up
 
02:21:03.270 --> 02:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
with a lot of other ingredients comes
 
02:21:05.590 --> 02:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
back in is that local or not local
 
02:21:06.870 --> 02:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
good question
 
02:21:09.990 --> 02:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
but uh there's not going to stop us from
 
02:21:11.670 --> 02:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
looking at and discussing this whole
 
02:21:13.670 --> 02:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
topic when we got to the other bill like
 
02:21:15.750 --> 02:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
when we get to this 12 29 a committee
 
02:21:18.309 --> 02:21:18.319 align:start position:0%
for meal plans and all that
 
02:21:20.950 --> 02:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
i we're talking about food
 
02:21:20.960 --> 02:21:22.150 align:start position:0%
i we're talking about food
and

02:21:22.150 --> 02:21:22.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:21:24.870 --> 02:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
i just hesitate in getting too many
 
02:21:27.030 --> 02:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
interim studies going we have a huge
 
02:21:28.469 --> 02:21:28.479 align:start position:0%
interim study that we're going to come
 
02:21:30.630 --> 02:21:30.640 align:start position:0%
up with dealing with how we fund
 
02:21:32.630 --> 02:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
education in the state
 
02:21:34.309 --> 02:21:34.319 align:start position:0%
and that's if we're going to do things
 
02:21:36.309 --> 02:21:36.319 align:start position:0%
properly we've got to remember that
 
02:21:39.429 --> 02:21:39.439 align:start position:0%
there's not a whole lot of us
 
02:21:41.670 --> 02:21:41.680 align:start position:0%
uh to do what you know
 
02:21:43.830 --> 02:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
we got to start consolidating and so
 
02:21:46.710 --> 02:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
that's where i come from this
 
02:21:48.469 --> 02:21:48.479 align:start position:0%
and rick and i agree with with
 
02:21:49.750 --> 02:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
everything that you
 
02:21:52.070 --> 02:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
you you said there and that that i
 
02:21:52.080 --> 02:21:52.950 align:start position:0%
you you said there and that that i
believe

02:21:52.950 --> 02:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
believe
 
02:21:55.590 --> 02:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
this could be studied at the same time
 
02:21:57.110 --> 02:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
we we
 
02:21:59.349 --> 02:21:59.359 align:start position:0%
study interim studied
 
02:22:02.150 --> 02:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
which is an informal study not a study
 
02:22:02.160 --> 02:22:03.190 align:start position:0%
which is an informal study not a study
committee

02:22:03.190 --> 02:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:22:05.510 --> 02:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
study but an informal study
 
02:22:06.830 --> 02:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
along with
 
02:22:10.870 --> 02:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
um along with 1229. that's correct and
 
02:22:13.750 --> 02:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
and um but but i think when when we take
 
02:22:17.110 --> 02:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
a look at the hard itl on something that
 
02:22:19.830 --> 02:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
from the commissioner says is a great
 
02:22:22.309 --> 02:22:22.319 align:start position:0%
idea but it needs more work the itl i
 
02:22:24.150 --> 02:22:24.160 align:start position:0%
think sends the wrong message
 
02:22:26.550 --> 02:22:26.560 align:start position:0%
and um and and i don't think this
 
02:22:29.990 --> 02:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
interim study would would compound
 
02:22:31.670 --> 02:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
um or increase
 
02:22:33.750 --> 02:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
what what this committee would uh would
 
02:22:36.630 --> 02:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
probably do in that afternoon okay uh
 
02:22:39.110 --> 02:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
represent bowman and represent tanner
 
02:22:41.429 --> 02:22:41.439 align:start position:0%
yes whether or not we itl
 
02:22:43.349 --> 02:22:43.359 align:start position:0%
study doesn't stop it from coming back
 
02:22:46.230 --> 02:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
next year after people have worked on it
 
02:22:49.110 --> 02:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
that's been done before so
 
02:22:50.950 --> 02:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
i mean people can work on it if they
 
02:22:53.030 --> 02:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
want and come up with suggestions and
 
02:22:54.469 --> 02:22:54.479 align:start position:0%
come up with a bill next year whether or
 
02:22:59.990 --> 02:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
not we itl or otp it or whatever i mean
 
02:23:03.670 --> 02:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
next year starts a brand new
 
02:23:05.990 --> 02:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
thank you rev santana
 
02:23:09.030 --> 02:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
yes i i um represent the western part of
 
02:23:11.270 --> 02:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
the state and we have a lot of small
 
02:23:13.910 --> 02:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
family farms in that area not the big
 
02:23:15.510 --> 02:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
aggie farms that
 
02:23:17.110 --> 02:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
the commissioner was talking about might
 
02:23:18.870 --> 02:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
be have have a hard time getting
 
02:23:21.030 --> 02:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
involved with this program
 
02:23:23.030 --> 02:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
i see a lot of merits to the policy of
 
02:23:24.950 --> 02:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
this program and we're a policy
 
02:23:27.670 --> 02:23:27.680 align:start position:0%
committee not a finance committee so
 
02:23:30.070 --> 02:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
i i think the finance part of it
 
02:23:33.110 --> 02:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be such a heavy burden on
 
02:23:35.910 --> 02:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
making a decision um to go to interim
 
02:23:38.150 --> 02:23:38.160 align:start position:0%
study where we actually have made a
 
02:23:40.630 --> 02:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
commitment to these small family farms
 
02:23:43.510 --> 02:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
into the schools to bring agriculture or
 
02:23:45.270 --> 02:23:45.280 align:start position:0%
products into the school i think it's
 
02:23:47.750 --> 02:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
different than than the other bills we
 
02:23:50.550 --> 02:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
have on breakfast and and lunches
 
02:23:51.750 --> 02:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
and how
 
02:23:53.990 --> 02:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
long and how what's in them and that
 
02:23:56.630 --> 02:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
sort of thing i think this is this is a
 
02:23:59.110 --> 02:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
different program entirely we certainly
 
02:24:00.870 --> 02:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
saw that there were a number of sponsors
 
02:24:03.030 --> 02:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
on this bill and i think
 
02:24:06.150 --> 02:24:06.160 align:start position:0%
that we would have no problem getting
 
02:24:07.510 --> 02:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of help
 
02:24:09.910 --> 02:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
in setting up a pilot program maybe as a
 
02:24:11.990 --> 02:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
result of this interim study i think
 
02:24:14.469 --> 02:24:14.479 align:start position:0%
waiting until next year is just kind of
 
02:24:16.150 --> 02:24:16.160 align:start position:0%
kicking the can down the road a little
 
02:24:17.910 --> 02:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
bit and
 
02:24:19.910 --> 02:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of times things don't carry over
 
02:24:22.710 --> 02:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
and i would hate to lose this bill so i
 
02:24:24.550 --> 02:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
will be voting against
 
02:24:27.670 --> 02:24:27.680 align:start position:0%
uh the motion and asking for an interim
 
02:24:29.750 --> 02:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
study thank you thank you any further
 
02:24:31.750 --> 02:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
discussion representative woodcock
 
02:24:33.429 --> 02:24:33.439 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman lead
 
02:24:35.510 --> 02:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
i also have concerns about this first
 
02:24:37.110 --> 02:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
off it's one of our few
 
02:24:39.990 --> 02:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
bipartisan bills we've seen this this uh
 
02:24:42.550 --> 02:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
session and it's very bipartisan uh
 
02:24:43.750 --> 02:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
former ed community member
 
02:24:46.070 --> 02:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
representative allen and i have have for
 
02:24:48.469 --> 02:24:48.479 align:start position:0%
three years now i had a bipartisan bill
 
02:24:51.670 --> 02:24:51.680 align:start position:0%
upstairs in ag and as president boehm
 
02:24:52.950 --> 02:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
said it keeps on getting these can
 
02:24:54.870 --> 02:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
easily keep on getting kicked down the
 
02:24:57.190 --> 02:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
road it's about time we uh go a little
 
02:24:59.510 --> 02:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
bit more forward and commit to this uh
 
02:25:01.270 --> 02:25:01.280 align:start position:0%
the local the local farm and the local
 
02:25:03.190 --> 02:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
products what we're trying to do and and
 
02:25:05.190 --> 02:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
it's a small number as representative
 
02:25:06.790 --> 02:25:06.800 align:start position:0%
luna talked about the 1200 bucks for a
 
02:25:09.270 --> 02:25:09.280 align:start position:0%
school maximum that's a maximum number
 
02:25:11.270 --> 02:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
um and i agree with secretary casper
 
02:25:12.790 --> 02:25:12.800 align:start position:0%
that it's that's a real
 
02:25:14.550 --> 02:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
mile long an inch deep and may not
 
02:25:16.230 --> 02:25:16.240 align:start position:0%
accomplish what we want
 
02:25:18.469 --> 02:25:18.479 align:start position:0%
but as a pilot or the study so i i would
 
02:25:19.429 --> 02:25:19.439 align:start position:0%
i would
 
02:25:19.439 --> 02:25:20.469 align:start position:0%
i would
sure

02:25:20.469 --> 02:25:20.479 align:start position:0%
sure
 
02:25:21.990 --> 02:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
i would appreciate if the community in
 
02:25:23.590 --> 02:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
this case would think more about the
 
02:25:25.429 --> 02:25:25.439 align:start position:0%
possibility and not just kill it dead on
 
02:25:27.510 --> 02:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
the floor with an idl particularly with
 
02:25:29.270 --> 02:25:29.280 align:start position:0%
from the bipartisanship piece for a
 
02:25:31.110 --> 02:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
change thank you
 
02:25:32.150 --> 02:25:32.160 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion
 
02:25:34.150 --> 02:25:34.160 align:start position:0%
representative hall
 
02:25:37.429 --> 02:25:37.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair this bill is
 
02:25:39.670 --> 02:25:39.680 align:start position:0%
close to the heart
 
02:25:41.510 --> 02:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
grew up on the family farm we sold our
 
02:25:44.230 --> 02:25:44.240 align:start position:0%
potatoes to the groston schools
 
02:25:46.710 --> 02:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
02:25:49.349 --> 02:25:49.359 align:start position:0%
this is an interim study absolutely we
 
02:25:51.830 --> 02:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
should not be itling it
 
02:25:53.670 --> 02:25:53.680 align:start position:0%
i think and this bill to me is about
 
02:25:53.680 --> 02:25:54.790 align:start position:0%
i think and this bill to me is about
farmers

02:25:54.790 --> 02:25:54.800 align:start position:0%
farmers
 
02:25:56.150 --> 02:25:56.160 align:start position:0%
rather than the other ones that are
 
02:25:56.160 --> 02:25:57.110 align:start position:0%
rather than the other ones that are
about

02:25:57.110 --> 02:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:25:58.870 --> 02:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
more about the health and the nutrition
 
02:26:01.429 --> 02:26:01.439 align:start position:0%
that the kids are getting so i i think
 
02:26:03.030 --> 02:26:03.040 align:start position:0%
we really need to support our local
 
02:26:03.040 --> 02:26:04.389 align:start position:0%
we really need to support our local
farmers

02:26:04.389 --> 02:26:04.399 align:start position:0%
farmers
 
02:26:06.469 --> 02:26:06.479 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion represent
 
02:26:08.630 --> 02:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
like us
 
02:26:09.750 --> 02:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
so i'm
 
02:26:11.830 --> 02:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out what the difference
 
02:26:13.670 --> 02:26:13.680 align:start position:0%
between this
 
02:26:16.309 --> 02:26:16.319 align:start position:0%
and representative ford's bill that we
 
02:26:19.030 --> 02:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
itl because it wasn't ready
 
02:26:21.190 --> 02:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
since it's a brand new year next year
 
02:26:23.510 --> 02:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
and even if we interim study all we can
 
02:26:26.630 --> 02:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
do is make a recommendation we can't
 
02:26:26.640 --> 02:26:27.750 align:start position:0%
do is make a recommendation we can't
actually

02:26:27.750 --> 02:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:26:30.309 --> 02:26:30.319 align:start position:0%
it doesn't carry over so there's not
 
02:26:32.550 --> 02:26:32.560 align:start position:0%
another you know a new bill would have
 
02:26:34.870 --> 02:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
to be put in so
 
02:26:37.110 --> 02:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
is this not something that we can just
 
02:26:40.070 --> 02:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
say to the commissioner of ag and the
 
02:26:41.510 --> 02:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
farms and
 
02:26:44.070 --> 02:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
whoever else wants to work on this
 
02:26:45.910 --> 02:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
get together and figure out how to do
 
02:26:48.710 --> 02:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
this because i'm not sure that we
 
02:26:50.870 --> 02:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
would be the ones to interim study it
 
02:26:52.870 --> 02:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
anyways it seems like it's an
 
02:26:55.190 --> 02:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
agricultural thing more than an
 
02:26:57.990 --> 02:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
educational thing and so i'm not sure
 
02:26:59.670 --> 02:26:59.680 align:start position:0%
that we're the right people to come up
 
02:27:02.070 --> 02:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
with that recommendation
 
02:27:04.230 --> 02:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
but i love the idea and i would love to
 
02:27:05.670 --> 02:27:05.680 align:start position:0%
see it done
 
02:27:07.750 --> 02:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
i'm just not sure we're the right ones
 
02:27:08.950 --> 02:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
to do it
 
02:27:10.790 --> 02:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure that whatever we came
 
02:27:13.590 --> 02:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
out of an interim study would be and
 
02:27:15.590 --> 02:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
any more useful than what they might
 
02:27:17.429 --> 02:27:17.439 align:start position:0%
come up with as a new bill next year and
 
02:27:19.510 --> 02:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
either way it has to be a new bill next
 
02:27:19.520 --> 02:27:21.190 align:start position:0%
either way it has to be a new bill next
year

02:27:21.190 --> 02:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:27:24.790 --> 02:27:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:26.870 --> 02:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
we have a bill that we are going to
 
02:27:28.710 --> 02:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
discuss now i encourage everybody look
 
02:27:31.590 --> 02:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
at 29 right now
 
02:27:35.110 --> 02:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
and 12 29 has some duties assigned in
 
02:27:37.830 --> 02:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
there work with other state agencies is
 
02:27:42.230 --> 02:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:44.389 --> 02:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
identify potential legislation intended
 
02:27:46.150 --> 02:27:46.160 align:start position:0%
to reduce student hunger among students
 
02:27:49.349 --> 02:27:49.359 align:start position:0%
whose families meet the okay guidelines
 
02:27:49.359 --> 02:27:50.389 align:start position:0%
whose families meet the okay guidelines
um

02:27:50.389 --> 02:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:52.710 --> 02:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
to me this this bill right here would
 
02:27:54.870 --> 02:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
that committee and it's going to be very
 
02:27:58.309 --> 02:27:58.319 align:start position:0%
hard to sell any kind of committee
 
02:28:01.030 --> 02:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
to the full house this year when we
 
02:28:02.950 --> 02:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
can't get people in the legislature to
 
02:28:04.870 --> 02:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
serve on committees right now or you to
 
02:28:08.230 --> 02:28:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:09.990 --> 02:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of commissions which are
 
02:28:12.790 --> 02:28:12.800 align:start position:0%
just drying up because of that so
 
02:28:14.469 --> 02:28:14.479 align:start position:0%
i'd be very careful
 
02:28:15.830 --> 02:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
president porter
 
02:28:18.550 --> 02:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
mr chair this is just a process
 
02:28:18.560 --> 02:28:19.510 align:start position:0%
mr chair this is just a process
question

02:28:19.510 --> 02:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:28:23.030 --> 02:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
if we um interim studied both of them
 
02:28:24.830 --> 02:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
could the same
 
02:28:30.550 --> 02:28:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:32.469 --> 02:28:32.479 align:start position:0%
could we make a committee
 
02:28:35.429 --> 02:28:35.439 align:start position:0%
sure that that's always a possibility so
 
02:28:38.309 --> 02:28:38.319 align:start position:0%
it seems like maybe if it's a policy we
 
02:28:41.510 --> 02:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
think is a good idea that maybe if we
 
02:28:43.429 --> 02:28:43.439 align:start position:0%
could make the same committee work on
 
02:28:43.439 --> 02:28:45.429 align:start position:0%
could make the same committee work on
both

02:28:45.429 --> 02:28:45.439 align:start position:0%
both
 
02:28:47.190 --> 02:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
that would solve the problem of having
 
02:28:52.469 --> 02:28:52.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:55.429 --> 02:28:55.439 align:start position:0%
rough tanner thank you
 
02:28:57.510 --> 02:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
i just i i would just
 
02:28:59.110 --> 02:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
plead i guess
 
02:28:59.120 --> 02:28:59.910 align:start position:0%
plead i guess
that

02:28:59.910 --> 02:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:29:03.429 --> 02:29:03.439 align:start position:0%
small family farms again uh and sullivan
 
02:29:03.439 --> 02:29:04.309 align:start position:0%
small family farms again uh and sullivan
county

02:29:04.309 --> 02:29:04.319 align:start position:0%
county
 
02:29:06.230 --> 02:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
definitely has their share of small
 
02:29:07.670 --> 02:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
family farms
 
02:29:10.790 --> 02:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
that to itl this gives a different
 
02:29:12.950 --> 02:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a different message that
 
02:29:15.429 --> 02:29:15.439 align:start position:0%
that i just can't be a part of i want to
 
02:29:16.870 --> 02:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
be a part of
 
02:29:19.990 --> 02:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
saying we like this policy which
 
02:29:21.990 --> 02:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
may get out to the public through the
 
02:29:23.590 --> 02:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
the video but
 
02:29:25.830 --> 02:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
to see it in paper as a you know killed
 
02:29:27.750 --> 02:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
in committee kind of thing i would
 
02:29:30.870 --> 02:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
rather us do an interim study i know
 
02:29:32.150 --> 02:29:32.160 align:start position:0%
that the
 
02:29:33.110 --> 02:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:29:34.950 --> 02:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
it may be difficult getting a study
 
02:29:37.429 --> 02:29:37.439 align:start position:0%
committee i'll volunteer for it
 
02:29:40.710 --> 02:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
to start out but i and and i think it's
 
02:29:43.030 --> 02:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
a what you know an idea
 
02:29:45.349 --> 02:29:45.359 align:start position:0%
that um we don't want to just let it
 
02:29:47.990 --> 02:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
drop and certainly to put it in with the
 
02:29:49.349 --> 02:29:49.359 align:start position:0%
other bill
 
02:29:51.270 --> 02:29:51.280 align:start position:0%
might be a possibility but it seems like
 
02:29:53.670 --> 02:29:53.680 align:start position:0%
that other bill has some very specific
 
02:29:56.870 --> 02:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
ideas that that agriculture could be get
 
02:29:59.270 --> 02:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
get lost somewhere so
 
02:30:01.990 --> 02:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
um again i would plead that we go for an
 
02:30:05.990 --> 02:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
interim study rather than an itl on this
 
02:30:10.710 --> 02:30:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:13.030 --> 02:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry
 
02:30:14.790 --> 02:30:14.800 align:start position:0%
represent mullen
 
02:30:15.750 --> 02:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:30:19.510 --> 02:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
as someone who is a sponsor on both of
 
02:30:22.150 --> 02:30:22.160 align:start position:0%
these bills 1657
 
02:30:24.389 --> 02:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
and 1229
 
02:30:26.870 --> 02:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
i certainly can appreciate
 
02:30:28.950 --> 02:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
representative ladd the idea of
 
02:30:31.750 --> 02:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
streamlining the process
 
02:30:35.190 --> 02:30:35.200 align:start position:0%
however i think the scope of the bills
 
02:30:37.349 --> 02:30:37.359 align:start position:0%
in and of themselves are large enough
 
02:30:38.630 --> 02:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
that if you try to give this to one
 
02:30:40.469 --> 02:30:40.479 align:start position:0%
committee i think the one committee is
 
02:30:43.190 --> 02:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
going to be buried in the details
 
02:30:46.309 --> 02:30:46.319 align:start position:0%
looking at 1657 i want to be completely
 
02:30:48.070 --> 02:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
transparent with you there were people
 
02:30:50.309 --> 02:30:50.319 align:start position:0%
that worked far harder on this bill than
 
02:30:51.990 --> 02:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
i did
 
02:30:55.349 --> 02:30:55.359 align:start position:0%
though i was quite invested in the
 
02:30:58.309 --> 02:30:58.319 align:start position:0%
process farmland is not
 
02:30:58.319 --> 02:30:59.670 align:start position:0%
process farmland is not
my

02:30:59.670 --> 02:30:59.680 align:start position:0%
my
 
02:30:59.680 --> 02:31:01.030 align:start position:0%
my
wheelhouse

02:31:01.030 --> 02:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
wheelhouse
 
02:31:03.190 --> 02:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
uh however
 
02:31:06.150 --> 02:31:06.160 align:start position:0%
looking at the number of organizations
 
02:31:08.790 --> 02:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
that contacted us in support of this
 
02:31:11.830 --> 02:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
bill the number of farmers individual
 
02:31:13.910 --> 02:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
people that contacted us in support of
 
02:31:14.950 --> 02:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:31:17.510 --> 02:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
and looking at the sincerity of the of
 
02:31:19.110 --> 02:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:31:21.030 --> 02:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
camaraderie of the people on the
 
02:31:21.040 --> 02:31:22.070 align:start position:0%
camaraderie of the people on the
committee

02:31:22.070 --> 02:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:31:25.750 --> 02:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
i would venture to say that the thing
 
02:31:27.190 --> 02:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
that we
 
02:31:30.230 --> 02:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
that makes legislators successful
 
02:31:32.070 --> 02:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
is their ability to have relationships
 
02:31:33.910 --> 02:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
with one another
 
02:31:36.469 --> 02:31:36.479 align:start position:0%
and specifically because of the fact
 
02:31:36.479 --> 02:31:37.590 align:start position:0%
and specifically because of the fact
that

02:31:37.590 --> 02:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:31:39.270 --> 02:31:39.280 align:start position:0%
we don't know what the complexion of
 
02:31:41.429 --> 02:31:41.439 align:start position:0%
this committee will be after november of
 
02:31:42.550 --> 02:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
next year
 
02:31:44.870 --> 02:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
i would ask that you look at this as an
 
02:31:47.030 --> 02:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
interim study i won't be supporting the
 
02:31:50.710 --> 02:31:50.720 align:start position:0%
itl on this uh and i would hope for an
 
02:31:52.150 --> 02:31:52.160 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
02:31:54.469 --> 02:31:54.479 align:start position:0%
to really honestly honor the work that
 
02:31:57.670 --> 02:31:57.680 align:start position:0%
has already been done on this very
 
02:31:59.750 --> 02:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
wholesome topic
 
02:32:02.230 --> 02:32:02.240 align:start position:0%
so thank you for hearing me
 
02:32:03.830 --> 02:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
represent cordelia
 
02:32:06.790 --> 02:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i don't think
 
02:32:09.750 --> 02:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
anyone on the committee does not
 
02:32:11.910 --> 02:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
support local farmers
 
02:32:13.590 --> 02:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
my son is a farmer
 
02:32:15.830 --> 02:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
not in new hampshire but is a farmer so
 
02:32:18.230 --> 02:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
that's you know close to my heart as
 
02:32:18.240 --> 02:32:19.190 align:start position:0%
that's you know close to my heart as
well

02:32:19.190 --> 02:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:32:19.200 --> 02:32:20.469 align:start position:0%
well
but

02:32:20.469 --> 02:32:20.479 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:32:24.710 --> 02:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:27.030 --> 02:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
the interim study versus itl is not
 
02:32:29.429 --> 02:32:29.439 align:start position:0%
going to make any difference the
 
02:32:29.439 --> 02:32:31.270 align:start position:0%
going to make any difference the
229

02:32:31.270 --> 02:32:31.280 align:start position:0%
229
 
02:32:34.870 --> 02:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
vehicle can be used to look at this
 
02:32:35.990 --> 02:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
02:32:38.389 --> 02:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
certainly is is not
 
02:32:40.309 --> 02:32:40.319 align:start position:0%
not ready
 
02:32:40.319 --> 02:32:41.910 align:start position:0%
not ready
has

02:32:41.910 --> 02:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
has
 
02:32:44.230 --> 02:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
many many problems in including the
 
02:32:44.240 --> 02:32:45.349 align:start position:0%
many many problems in including the
financial

02:32:45.349 --> 02:32:45.359 align:start position:0%
financial
 
02:32:49.110 --> 02:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
and location origination aspects
 
02:32:51.190 --> 02:32:51.200 align:start position:0%
it can be worked on
 
02:32:53.349 --> 02:32:53.359 align:start position:0%
independently it can be worked on with
 
02:32:55.830 --> 02:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
the other bill it can be worked on and
 
02:32:58.630 --> 02:32:58.640 align:start position:0%
brought back in legislation
 
02:33:00.230 --> 02:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
in any event
 
02:33:00.240 --> 02:33:01.110 align:start position:0%
in any event
so

02:33:01.110 --> 02:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:33:02.950 --> 02:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
i don't think an itl motion is saying
 
02:33:05.349 --> 02:33:05.359 align:start position:0%
that we do not want to
 
02:33:07.349 --> 02:33:07.359 align:start position:0%
continue to look at the
 
02:33:07.359 --> 02:33:09.349 align:start position:0%
continue to look at the
topic

02:33:09.349 --> 02:33:09.359 align:start position:0%
topic
 
02:33:11.190 --> 02:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
it is saying this bill is right not
 
02:33:12.550 --> 02:33:12.560 align:start position:0%
ready and
 
02:33:14.150 --> 02:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
we can bring it back
 
02:33:17.670 --> 02:33:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:25.190 --> 02:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:26.469 --> 02:33:26.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:33:27.429 --> 02:33:27.439 align:start position:0%
i just
 
02:33:28.630 --> 02:33:28.640 align:start position:0%
there are a couple things i just wanted
 
02:33:30.150 --> 02:33:30.160 align:start position:0%
to address that have made me
 
02:33:32.710 --> 02:33:32.720 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable throughout the caucus the
 
02:33:33.670 --> 02:33:33.680 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:33:35.990 --> 02:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
throwing out bipartisan or we're not
 
02:33:37.750 --> 02:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
supporting the farmers
 
02:33:40.790 --> 02:33:40.800 align:start position:0%
i most definitely support our farmers
 
02:33:43.750 --> 02:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
i'm most definitely a team player
 
02:33:45.670 --> 02:33:45.680 align:start position:0%
regardless of what the bill is and i
 
02:33:47.590 --> 02:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
hope that you all know that
 
02:33:49.510 --> 02:33:49.520 align:start position:0%
what i wanted to point out in listening
 
02:33:52.230 --> 02:33:52.240 align:start position:0%
to testimony this bill it only applies
 
02:33:53.750 --> 02:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
to those schools who are in the federal
 
02:33:55.590 --> 02:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
lunch program it does not apply to all
 
02:33:58.389 --> 02:33:58.399 align:start position:0%
schools but we actually had people from
 
02:33:59.750 --> 02:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
the doe
 
02:34:02.389 --> 02:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
that had testified we were told that the
 
02:34:04.150 --> 02:34:04.160 align:start position:0%
actual cost of the bill is seven hundred
 
02:34:06.389 --> 02:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
and eighty thousand dollars forty
 
02:34:09.110 --> 02:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
thousand for new information systems
 
02:34:10.950 --> 02:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
five hundred and sixty thousand for the
 
02:34:13.270 --> 02:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
program reimbursements and hundred
 
02:34:15.110 --> 02:34:15.120 align:start position:0%
eighty thousand dollars for the new
 
02:34:17.670 --> 02:34:17.680 align:start position:0%
employees at the doe to oversee
 
02:34:20.630 --> 02:34:20.640 align:start position:0%
i know mckenzie had specifically told us
 
02:34:24.230 --> 02:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
that this effective date july 1st 2022
 
02:34:26.790 --> 02:34:26.800 align:start position:0%
was not a feasible timeline for roll out
 
02:34:28.389 --> 02:34:28.399 align:start position:0%
and i feel as though we continue to hear
 
02:34:30.469 --> 02:34:30.479 align:start position:0%
from the attorneys as well the attorney
 
02:34:31.590 --> 02:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
02:34:33.990 --> 02:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
and employees of doe that they're really
 
02:34:36.150 --> 02:34:36.160 align:start position:0%
having a hard time filling their slots
 
02:34:37.750 --> 02:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
right now for open employment
 
02:34:39.670 --> 02:34:39.680 align:start position:0%
opportunities and here we are we're
 
02:34:42.230 --> 02:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
about to add two more i would agree that
 
02:34:44.630 --> 02:34:44.640 align:start position:0%
this bill has a lot of merit i'm just
 
02:34:47.110 --> 02:34:47.120 align:start position:0%
not sure that it's ready either
 
02:34:48.710 --> 02:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:34:50.550 --> 02:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
02:34:52.950 --> 02:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
representative mullen
 
02:34:56.230 --> 02:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
i agree with about 50 of what you had to
 
02:35:00.469 --> 02:35:00.479 align:start position:0%
say representative flitchfield um
 
02:35:03.750 --> 02:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
yeah 50 is good uh
 
02:35:05.830 --> 02:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
keeping in mind two things one we're not
 
02:35:08.870 --> 02:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
looking for this bill to be enacted
 
02:35:10.790 --> 02:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
we're talking about studying it we're
 
02:35:12.469 --> 02:35:12.479 align:start position:0%
taking we're talking about going back
 
02:35:14.309 --> 02:35:14.319 align:start position:0%
and looking at exactly what you're
 
02:35:16.870 --> 02:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
talking about the costs whether or not
 
02:35:18.630 --> 02:35:18.640 align:start position:0%
we would be better off putting together
 
02:35:21.030 --> 02:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
a pilot program and making
 
02:35:23.670 --> 02:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
recommendations so uh you know
 
02:35:25.510 --> 02:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
agreeing to an interim study is not
 
02:35:28.469 --> 02:35:28.479 align:start position:0%
going to bind this committee nor
 
02:35:30.389 --> 02:35:30.399 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire to anything
 
02:35:31.910 --> 02:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
other than
 
02:35:35.429 --> 02:35:35.439 align:start position:0%
it is a formal nod to
 
02:35:38.070 --> 02:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
the fact that this is a worthwhile thing
 
02:35:39.349 --> 02:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
to study
 
02:35:41.990 --> 02:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
so i i would just and it's also a
 
02:35:44.150 --> 02:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
voluntary program so
 
02:35:46.070 --> 02:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
no school would be
 
02:35:48.950 --> 02:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
mandated into uh participating in this
 
02:35:48.960 --> 02:35:49.910 align:start position:0%
mandated into uh participating in this
so

02:35:49.910 --> 02:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:35:52.550 --> 02:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
if the local costs in
 
02:35:55.030 --> 02:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
brentwood don't support participating in
 
02:35:57.190 --> 02:35:57.200 align:start position:0%
the program but the local costs in
 
02:35:58.950 --> 02:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
woodsville do
 
02:36:02.150 --> 02:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
then um you know i think we can
 
02:36:04.070 --> 02:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
we can acknowledge the fact that not
 
02:36:05.910 --> 02:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
every school system would be involved in
 
02:36:08.309 --> 02:36:08.319 align:start position:0%
this unless it was of their own volition
 
02:36:08.319 --> 02:36:09.190 align:start position:0%
this unless it was of their own volition
so

02:36:09.190 --> 02:36:09.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:36:10.630 --> 02:36:10.640 align:start position:0%
again no
 
02:36:13.270 --> 02:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
nothing binding the state to anything
 
02:36:16.389 --> 02:36:16.399 align:start position:0%
just asking to take a look at things
 
02:36:17.910 --> 02:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:36:20.630 --> 02:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
is there further discussion on this bill
 
02:36:21.990 --> 02:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
not seeing anything
 
02:36:23.429 --> 02:36:23.439 align:start position:0%
just a a
 
02:36:25.190 --> 02:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
question of the chair
 
02:36:27.590 --> 02:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
so in an interim study the outcome what
 
02:36:30.150 --> 02:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
what is the outcome the possible two
 
02:36:32.150 --> 02:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
outcomes of an interim study
 
02:36:33.670 --> 02:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
well it's simply that to make a
 
02:36:36.630 --> 02:36:36.640 align:start position:0%
recommendation whether there's
 
02:36:38.550 --> 02:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
it should move forward or not move
 
02:36:41.510 --> 02:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
forward in terms of legislation and
 
02:36:43.590 --> 02:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
interim studies also
 
02:36:43.600 --> 02:36:44.469 align:start position:0%
interim studies also
can

02:36:44.469 --> 02:36:44.479 align:start position:0%
can
 
02:36:47.190 --> 02:36:47.200 align:start position:0%
provide more information
 
02:36:49.510 --> 02:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
to you know
 
02:36:51.030 --> 02:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
make the particular bill more
 
02:36:53.750 --> 02:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
sustainable and and and and to move it
 
02:36:57.030 --> 02:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
forward in a positive manner um
 
02:36:59.190 --> 02:36:59.200 align:start position:0%
i believe well i won't go into what i
 
02:37:01.990 --> 02:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
believe but that's exactly what
 
02:37:03.670 --> 02:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
whether it's up or down
 
02:37:05.429 --> 02:37:05.439 align:start position:0%
move forward or not
 
02:37:07.270 --> 02:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
that's what we would be doing and it's
 
02:37:09.270 --> 02:37:09.280 align:start position:0%
not necessarily move moving forward with
 
02:37:11.349 --> 02:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
the language and the bill it's it's
 
02:37:13.030 --> 02:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
whether it's recommended for future
 
02:37:15.110 --> 02:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
legislation or not recommended for
 
02:37:18.950 --> 02:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
future legislation exactly
 
02:37:21.110 --> 02:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
such as we received yesterday from the
 
02:37:22.550 --> 02:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner of agriculture and
 
02:37:22.560 --> 02:37:23.670 align:start position:0%
commissioner of agriculture and
marketing

02:37:23.670 --> 02:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
marketing
 
02:37:27.429 --> 02:37:27.439 align:start position:0%
um he made one comment that uh he's not
 
02:37:28.790 --> 02:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
sure that
 
02:37:28.800 --> 02:37:29.910 align:start position:0%
sure that
um

02:37:29.910 --> 02:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:37:29.920 --> 02:37:31.349 align:start position:0%
um
there

02:37:31.349 --> 02:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:37:34.150 --> 02:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
the agricultural products in this state
 
02:37:36.230 --> 02:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
are enough to sustain on a long
 
02:37:38.950 --> 02:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
sustainable process the food necessary
 
02:37:40.870 --> 02:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
for a particular school or school
 
02:37:40.880 --> 02:37:41.910 align:start position:0%
for a particular school or school
district

02:37:41.910 --> 02:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
district
 
02:37:43.910 --> 02:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of questions have to be
 
02:37:46.550 --> 02:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
asked on this and i quite truthfully i
 
02:37:49.830 --> 02:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
think it's beyond what this committee
 
02:37:51.510 --> 02:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
if if we had to set up what are all the
 
02:37:53.429 --> 02:37:53.439 align:start position:0%
priorities for this committee right now
 
02:37:57.110 --> 02:37:57.120 align:start position:0%
in terms of statewide education
 
02:37:59.750 --> 02:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
your bill is extremely important i'm
 
02:38:02.469 --> 02:38:02.479 align:start position:0%
talking foundation budget
 
02:38:04.710 --> 02:38:04.720 align:start position:0%
mathematics in our school
 
02:38:07.750 --> 02:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
is very important our scores are down a
 
02:38:10.150 --> 02:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
whole lot yeah it's the pandemic but
 
02:38:11.670 --> 02:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
they have been kind of flat-lined
 
02:38:14.469 --> 02:38:14.479 align:start position:0%
anyways how do we improve
 
02:38:16.710 --> 02:38:16.720 align:start position:0%
there's areas that we have to really
 
02:38:18.950 --> 02:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
start looking at
 
02:38:18.960 --> 02:38:20.070 align:start position:0%
start looking at
and

02:38:20.070 --> 02:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:38:22.469 --> 02:38:22.479 align:start position:0%
for me this is important
 
02:38:22.479 --> 02:38:23.270 align:start position:0%
for me this is important
but

02:38:23.270 --> 02:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:38:25.910 --> 02:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
i it's like i kind of jumped on doe the
 
02:38:27.270 --> 02:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
other day and say what are your
 
02:38:27.280 --> 02:38:29.110 align:start position:0%
other day and say what are your
priorities

02:38:29.110 --> 02:38:29.120 align:start position:0%
priorities
 
02:38:30.950 --> 02:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
and and um
 
02:38:33.590 --> 02:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
what are our priorities if i had to say
 
02:38:35.349 --> 02:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
honestly what my priorities are right
 
02:38:37.910 --> 02:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
now um
 
02:38:39.830 --> 02:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
we want to feed our kids we want them to
 
02:38:41.590 --> 02:38:41.600 align:start position:0%
have a healthy meal we want them to be
 
02:38:44.710 --> 02:38:44.720 align:start position:0%
well but this one right here is not the
 
02:38:46.870 --> 02:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
top priority is what i would lay out for
 
02:38:48.710 --> 02:38:48.720 align:start position:0%
what i would like to see studies done
 
02:38:53.830 --> 02:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:57.830 --> 02:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
so is there further discussion
 
02:38:59.990 --> 02:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
madam clerk yes
 
02:39:03.510 --> 02:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to say that
 
02:39:05.910 --> 02:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
i i just wanted to reiterate that we all
 
02:39:07.750 --> 02:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
support this idea
 
02:39:11.030 --> 02:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
but i just wanted to say i don't think
 
02:39:12.469 --> 02:39:12.479 align:start position:0%
i don't think we're the ones who have
 
02:39:14.950 --> 02:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
the information that needs to
 
02:39:18.389 --> 02:39:18.399 align:start position:0%
to study this that's all and man i
 
02:39:20.950 --> 02:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
really want people to study this so my
 
02:39:22.870 --> 02:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
recommendation is
 
02:39:24.469 --> 02:39:24.479 align:start position:0%
people really ought to study this and
 
02:39:25.830 --> 02:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
come up with something good for next
 
02:39:27.910 --> 02:39:27.920 align:start position:0%

[Music]

02:41:36.469 --> 02:41:36.479 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:41:38.870 --> 02:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
do you have any discussion
 
02:41:40.870 --> 02:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
yes uh i just wanted to point out that
 
02:41:43.830 --> 02:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
we heard from the doe
 
02:41:47.030 --> 02:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:55.830 --> 02:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:56.830 --> 02:41:56.840 align:start position:0%
out of
 
02:41:56.840 --> 02:41:58.710 align:start position:0%
out of
466

02:41:58.710 --> 02:41:58.720 align:start position:0%
466
 
02:41:59.830 --> 02:41:59.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
02:42:03.910 --> 02:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
schools participating in the nhslp
 
02:42:07.750 --> 02:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
30 of these schools are not providing
 
02:42:07.760 --> 02:42:10.830 align:start position:0%
30 of these schools are not providing
breakfast

02:42:10.830 --> 02:42:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:14.870 --> 02:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
so to that end i believe that most of
 
02:42:16.950 --> 02:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
the schools are already providing these
 
02:42:16.960 --> 02:42:18.150 align:start position:0%
the schools are already providing these
services

02:42:18.150 --> 02:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:42:21.030 --> 02:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
and to start up a new program
 
02:42:22.910 --> 02:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
would uh the costs would be
 
02:42:26.309 --> 02:42:26.319 align:start position:0%
indeterminable uh according to mackenzie
 
02:42:29.990 --> 02:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:32.950 --> 02:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
the start-up costs the the program to
 
02:42:35.590 --> 02:42:35.600 align:start position:0%
continue oversight
 
02:42:38.150 --> 02:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
they would place a fiscal burden on
 
02:42:42.070 --> 02:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
taxpayers so for that reason i vote itl
 
02:42:43.030 --> 02:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:42:45.429 --> 02:42:45.439 align:start position:0%

02:42:47.840 --> 02:42:49.429 align:start position:0%
uh is there any discussion from this
second

02:42:49.429 --> 02:42:49.439 align:start position:0%
second
 
02:42:51.830 --> 02:42:51.840 align:start position:0%

chair i'll be voting against the motion
 
02:43:00.960 --> 02:43:02.070 align:start position:0%
chair i'll be voting against the motion
uh

02:43:02.070 --> 02:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:43:04.150 --> 02:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
i think the the issues are real clear on
 
02:43:04.160 --> 02:43:04.950 align:start position:0%
i think the the issues are real clear on
this

02:43:04.950 --> 02:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:43:06.550 --> 02:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
and it's a dilemma that we as a
 
02:43:09.670 --> 02:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
committee face almost daily
 
02:43:09.680 --> 02:43:10.550 align:start position:0%
committee face almost daily
and

02:43:10.550 --> 02:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:43:13.110 --> 02:43:13.120 align:start position:0%
the issue here is feeding kids or local
 
02:43:15.030 --> 02:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
control of education
 
02:43:17.269 --> 02:43:17.279 align:start position:0%
and i will come down always on the side
 
02:43:18.790 --> 02:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
of feeding children
 
02:43:21.030 --> 02:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
and i think this committee should too
 
02:43:23.190 --> 02:43:23.200 align:start position:0%
the issue of an appropriation and how
 
02:43:25.830 --> 02:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
much money it costs goes to finance
 
02:43:28.550 --> 02:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
we're a policy committee finance decides
 
02:43:30.469 --> 02:43:30.479 align:start position:0%
those things the issue of how many
 
02:43:32.150 --> 02:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
schools are involved
 
02:43:36.469 --> 02:43:36.479 align:start position:0%
maybe 30 it may be as many as 37 or 40.
 
02:43:38.309 --> 02:43:38.319 align:start position:0%
so i will be voting against the motion
 
02:43:39.830 --> 02:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
and i would encourage you all to do that
 
02:43:40.710 --> 02:43:40.720 align:start position:0%
as well
 
02:43:45.510 --> 02:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:47.190 --> 02:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
we we are the richest country in the
 
02:43:49.750 --> 02:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
world we are a bread basket for
 
02:43:49.760 --> 02:43:51.110 align:start position:0%
world we are a bread basket for
everybody

02:43:51.110 --> 02:43:51.120 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
02:43:53.349 --> 02:43:53.359 align:start position:0%
i will be voting against this motion i
 
02:43:55.349 --> 02:43:55.359 align:start position:0%
see no reason that any child in this
 
02:43:57.349 --> 02:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
country should ever be hungry and i will
 
02:43:59.670 --> 02:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
always vote to feed children i will also
 
02:44:01.429 --> 02:44:01.439 align:start position:0%
say this is now the second or third bill
 
02:44:02.790 --> 02:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
where i've heard a discussion from the
 
02:44:05.190 --> 02:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
policy committee talking about the cost
 
02:44:07.429 --> 02:44:07.439 align:start position:0%
of this and as somebody who sits on the
 
02:44:09.510 --> 02:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
finance committee i would remind you
 
02:44:11.110 --> 02:44:11.120 align:start position:0%
that that really is the purview of the
 
02:44:12.550 --> 02:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
finance committee that we should be
 
02:44:14.710 --> 02:44:14.720 align:start position:0%
looking at the policy is feeding kids
 
02:44:16.790 --> 02:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
the right thing to do and let finance
 
02:44:18.389 --> 02:44:18.399 align:start position:0%
figure out the money on this
 
02:44:21.030 --> 02:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
but we should be feeding children no
 
02:44:22.790 --> 02:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
child should ever be sitting anywhere
 
02:44:24.710 --> 02:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
hungry so that's why i'll vote against
 
02:44:29.750 --> 02:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:31.590 --> 02:44:31.600 align:start position:0%
representative nelson thank you mr
 
02:44:34.070 --> 02:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
chairman parent responsibility parents
 
02:44:35.510 --> 02:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
should take the responsibility to make
 
02:44:37.670 --> 02:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
sure that dear children are fed they had
 
02:44:39.429 --> 02:44:39.439 align:start position:0%
it years ago
 
02:44:41.510 --> 02:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
mom and dad fed us i think we're losing
 
02:44:43.190 --> 02:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
that today and we expect government to
 
02:44:46.950 --> 02:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
be doing it for us so i will vote
 
02:44:49.110 --> 02:44:49.120 align:start position:0%
reps and like us
 
02:44:51.349 --> 02:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
my issue as with so many other things is
 
02:44:53.910 --> 02:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
i believe it's a 28a violation because
 
02:44:55.429 --> 02:44:55.439 align:start position:0%
even though we're reimbursing for the
 
02:44:56.950 --> 02:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
cost of the food
 
02:44:58.870 --> 02:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
we're not reimbursing for the cost of
 
02:45:01.590 --> 02:45:01.600 align:start position:0%
the preparation etc and these schools
 
02:45:03.910 --> 02:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
may not have anybody hired at the time
 
02:45:06.389 --> 02:45:06.399 align:start position:0%
that it would take at the time of day
 
02:45:09.429 --> 02:45:09.439 align:start position:0%
that they would need to prepare lunches
 
02:45:11.750 --> 02:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
and so we're asking them
 
02:45:14.550 --> 02:45:14.560 align:start position:0%
for these startup costs and the costs of
 
02:45:14.560 --> 02:45:17.269 align:start position:0%
for these startup costs and the costs of
the

02:45:17.269 --> 02:45:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:19.190 --> 02:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
workers etc
 
02:45:21.429 --> 02:45:21.439 align:start position:0%
and we're not paying for that
 
02:45:23.670 --> 02:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
and that's my problem with it once again
 
02:45:25.510 --> 02:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
we're telling schools they have to do
 
02:45:26.630 --> 02:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
something that's going to cost them
 
02:45:28.870 --> 02:45:28.880 align:start position:0%
money and we're not providing the full
 
02:45:28.880 --> 02:45:29.910 align:start position:0%
money and we're not providing the full
cost

02:45:29.910 --> 02:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
cost
 
02:45:32.150 --> 02:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
of what it is we're telling them to do
 
02:45:34.309 --> 02:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
and that's against our constitution
 
02:45:36.469 --> 02:45:36.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:45:39.670 --> 02:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
for reference thank you representative i
 
02:45:41.590 --> 02:45:41.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to comment i
 
02:45:43.429 --> 02:45:43.439 align:start position:0%
would just take take
 
02:45:46.550 --> 02:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
issue with president nelson's comment
 
02:45:50.070 --> 02:45:50.080 align:start position:0%
i agree that mom and dad when available
 
02:45:51.830 --> 02:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
went home and wouldn't have the
 
02:45:54.150 --> 02:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
financial resources to do that but the
 
02:45:55.750 --> 02:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
school has been providing meals for
 
02:45:57.269 --> 02:45:57.279 align:start position:0%
children for years
 
02:45:59.670 --> 02:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
think of our most recent costly program
 
02:46:00.870 --> 02:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
that we've taken out of the education
 
02:46:02.870 --> 02:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
trust fund for moms and dads to keep the
 
02:46:04.950 --> 02:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
kids home which is their responsibility
 
02:46:07.110 --> 02:46:07.120 align:start position:0%
four thousand bucks a piece we're asking
 
02:46:08.309 --> 02:46:08.319 align:start position:0%
to every youngster to get the most
 
02:46:10.309 --> 02:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
important meal of the day is breakfast
 
02:46:11.830 --> 02:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
and now we're saying we can't these are
 
02:46:13.670 --> 02:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
folks who are already
 
02:46:15.830 --> 02:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
on federal programs so they can't have
 
02:46:15.840 --> 02:46:17.590 align:start position:0%
on federal programs so they can't have
enough

02:46:17.590 --> 02:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
enough
 
02:46:19.670 --> 02:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
money to support their children going to
 
02:46:19.680 --> 02:46:20.630 align:start position:0%
money to support their children going to
school

02:46:20.630 --> 02:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:46:22.389 --> 02:46:22.399 align:start position:0%
in terms of feeding them properly the
 
02:46:23.910 --> 02:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
best thing we can do for education make
 
02:46:25.349 --> 02:46:25.359 align:start position:0%
our kids are there they're warm they're
 
02:46:27.110 --> 02:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
healthy they're mentally together and
 
02:46:28.630 --> 02:46:28.640 align:start position:0%
they're fed
 
02:46:30.389 --> 02:46:30.399 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
02:46:32.070 --> 02:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
uh other
 
02:46:33.510 --> 02:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
comments from the committee
 
02:46:35.030 --> 02:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
representative luno
 
02:46:37.269 --> 02:46:37.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and i think that i
 
02:46:38.950 --> 02:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
think the discussion here has been
 
02:46:38.960 --> 02:46:40.070 align:start position:0%
think the discussion here has been
compelling

02:46:40.070 --> 02:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
compelling
 
02:46:43.510 --> 02:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh i'm not going to support the itl
 
02:46:46.550 --> 02:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
motion and when you take a look
 
02:46:48.230 --> 02:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
because some of the conversations been
 
02:46:51.030 --> 02:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
about cost when you take a look at at
 
02:46:53.670 --> 02:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
our all-in costs in public public
 
02:46:55.910 --> 02:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
schools across the state local state and
 
02:46:58.870 --> 02:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
federal dollars 3.2 billion dollars a
 
02:47:01.190 --> 02:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
year and we're talking about
 
02:47:03.349 --> 02:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
what six hundred and
 
02:47:06.309 --> 02:47:06.319 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars here to um as a
 
02:47:08.070 --> 02:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
doe expenditure
 
02:47:10.230 --> 02:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
i i and i don't buy the art the local
 
02:47:12.150 --> 02:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
argument i mean yeah it's got in
 
02:47:13.750 --> 02:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
indeterminable but we're not talking
 
02:47:15.429 --> 02:47:15.439 align:start position:0%
about millions and millions and millions
 
02:47:17.830 --> 02:47:17.840 align:start position:0%
of dollars here certainly not 3.2
 
02:47:20.230 --> 02:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
billion dollars and the science is out
 
02:47:23.190 --> 02:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
there that that um that
 
02:47:25.830 --> 02:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
kids need to be fed in order to learn
 
02:47:27.349 --> 02:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
and if we're making that type of
 
02:47:29.670 --> 02:47:29.680 align:start position:0%
investment in our public schools i think
 
02:47:31.269 --> 02:47:31.279 align:start position:0%
making a little bit of
 
02:47:33.349 --> 02:47:33.359 align:start position:0%
an investment to make sure that our kids
 
02:47:34.950 --> 02:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
start the day
 
02:47:36.950 --> 02:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
so that they're ready for the first
 
02:47:40.230 --> 02:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
class of the day um is money very well
 
02:47:43.190 --> 02:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
spent so i i can't support the itl
 
02:47:44.870 --> 02:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
02:47:46.710 --> 02:47:46.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:47:48.389 --> 02:47:48.399 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of conversations in this
 
02:47:51.590 --> 02:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
committee about closing the gap between
 
02:47:54.070 --> 02:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
achievement gap between
 
02:47:56.150 --> 02:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
districts that have high
 
02:47:58.469 --> 02:47:58.479 align:start position:0%
numbers of free and reduced lunch kids
 
02:47:58.479 --> 02:47:59.590 align:start position:0%
numbers of free and reduced lunch kids
versus

02:47:59.590 --> 02:47:59.600 align:start position:0%
versus
 
02:48:01.429 --> 02:48:01.439 align:start position:0%
those that don't
 
02:48:03.910 --> 02:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
making sure that children have food so
 
02:48:06.230 --> 02:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
their brains can work when they get to
 
02:48:09.030 --> 02:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
school is a key element to closing that
 
02:48:09.040 --> 02:48:10.950 align:start position:0%
school is a key element to closing that
gap

02:48:10.950 --> 02:48:10.960 align:start position:0%
gap
 
02:48:12.950 --> 02:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
and i so for that reason i cannot
 
02:48:15.830 --> 02:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
support itl in this bill
 
02:48:16.950 --> 02:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:48:19.510 --> 02:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative tanner
 
02:48:23.830 --> 02:48:23.840 align:start position:0%
thank you um after teaching 35 years
 
02:48:25.990 --> 02:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
it was very apparent to me
 
02:48:28.550 --> 02:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
kids come to school and they're hungry
 
02:48:30.950 --> 02:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
and as a teacher and probably anybody
 
02:48:32.870 --> 02:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
that's taught in the public school
 
02:48:34.790 --> 02:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
system or has taught
 
02:48:37.190 --> 02:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
um had the same experience i did and
 
02:48:39.349 --> 02:48:39.359 align:start position:0%
that was that i kept peanut butter
 
02:48:39.359 --> 02:48:40.550 align:start position:0%
that was that i kept peanut butter
crackers

02:48:40.550 --> 02:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
crackers
 
02:48:43.269 --> 02:48:43.279 align:start position:0%
uh in my office for a kid that that
 
02:48:45.269 --> 02:48:45.279 align:start position:0%
really was struggling
 
02:48:47.110 --> 02:48:47.120 align:start position:0%
and at least it was a little bit of
 
02:48:47.120 --> 02:48:48.309 align:start position:0%
and at least it was a little bit of
nutrition

02:48:48.309 --> 02:48:48.319 align:start position:0%
nutrition
 
02:48:50.790 --> 02:48:50.800 align:start position:0%
in my area there's
 
02:48:52.710 --> 02:48:52.720 align:start position:0%
a couple of small groups that have even
 
02:48:52.720 --> 02:48:53.590 align:start position:0%
a couple of small groups that have even
formed

02:48:53.590 --> 02:48:53.600 align:start position:0%
formed
 
02:48:53.600 --> 02:48:54.469 align:start position:0%
formed
to

02:48:54.469 --> 02:48:54.479 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:48:56.469 --> 02:48:56.479 align:start position:0%
make sure that kids are fed
 
02:48:59.590 --> 02:48:59.600 align:start position:0%
on school holidays teacher work days
 
02:49:01.110 --> 02:49:01.120 align:start position:0%
the weekends
 
02:49:05.429 --> 02:49:05.439 align:start position:0%
and um also during vacation week
 
02:49:05.439 --> 02:49:06.230 align:start position:0%
and um also during vacation week
we

02:49:06.230 --> 02:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:49:08.870 --> 02:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
have kids who are food insecure they go
 
02:49:11.030 --> 02:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
home they don't there's nothing at home
 
02:49:13.830 --> 02:49:13.840 align:start position:0%
okay and maybe that's the parent's fault
 
02:49:16.389 --> 02:49:16.399 align:start position:0%
but the kids should not suffer
 
02:49:19.110 --> 02:49:19.120 align:start position:0%
because of what is at home or not at
 
02:49:19.120 --> 02:49:20.550 align:start position:0%
because of what is at home or not at
home

02:49:20.550 --> 02:49:20.560 align:start position:0%
home
 
02:49:22.870 --> 02:49:22.880 align:start position:0%
there's no as mary beth said there's no
 
02:49:22.880 --> 02:49:23.990 align:start position:0%
there's no as mary beth said there's no
reason

02:49:23.990 --> 02:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
reason
 
02:49:25.269 --> 02:49:25.279 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is one of the more
 
02:49:26.950 --> 02:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
wealthier states in the wealthiest
 
02:49:26.960 --> 02:49:27.910 align:start position:0%
wealthier states in the wealthiest
nation

02:49:27.910 --> 02:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
nation
 
02:49:29.670 --> 02:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
and there's no reason
 
02:49:29.680 --> 02:49:30.630 align:start position:0%
and there's no reason
why

02:49:30.630 --> 02:49:30.640 align:start position:0%
why
 
02:49:33.030 --> 02:49:33.040 align:start position:0%

well-rounded and and good for them
 
02:50:23.349 --> 02:50:23.359 align:start position:0%
it also affects their learning um and
 
02:50:25.910 --> 02:50:25.920 align:start position:0%

and there will be a minority report of
 
02:51:53.750 --> 02:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh ought to pass and it will come from
 
02:51:58.309 --> 02:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:01.990 --> 02:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:04.950 --> 02:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
the next bill to turn to which is also
 
02:52:08.150 --> 02:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
an early bill is 1661.
 
02:52:10.309 --> 02:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
uh we did have an amendment on that bill
 
02:52:12.389 --> 02:52:12.399 align:start position:0%

02:52:51.429 --> 02:52:51.439 align:start position:0%
i think
 
02:52:53.590 --> 02:52:53.600 align:start position:0%
everyone have should have a copy of the
 
02:52:53.600 --> 02:52:54.950 align:start position:0%
everyone have should have a copy of the
amendment

02:52:54.950 --> 02:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:52:54.960 --> 02:52:57.590 align:start position:0%
amendment
um

02:52:57.590 --> 02:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:52:57.600 --> 02:53:00.630 align:start position:0%
um
okay

02:53:00.630 --> 02:53:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:01.670 --> 02:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
i will
 
02:53:03.590 --> 02:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
call on uh
 
02:53:06.070 --> 02:53:06.080 align:start position:0%
chairman ladd for
 
02:53:14.630 --> 02:53:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:16.550 --> 02:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
so what i'm going to do is make a motion
 
02:53:19.030 --> 02:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on the bill
 
02:53:19.040 --> 02:54:04.630 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on the bill
1661.

02:54:04.630 --> 02:54:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:04.640 --> 02:54:21.269 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:54:21.269 --> 02:54:21.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:23.349 --> 02:54:23.359 align:start position:0%

02:54:28.640 --> 02:54:29.469 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:54:29.469 --> 02:54:29.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:54:32.389 --> 02:54:32.399 align:start position:0%
then in section three the old is the
 
02:54:34.600 --> 02:54:34.610 align:start position:0%
only change
 
02:54:34.610 --> 02:54:43.269 align:start position:0%
only change
[Music]

02:54:43.269 --> 02:54:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:45.590 --> 02:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
do you want to introduce the amendment
 
02:54:45.600 --> 02:54:57.670 align:start position:0%
do you want to introduce the amendment
um

02:54:57.670 --> 02:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:59.910 --> 02:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
seconds the motion of ought to pass and
 
02:55:05.429 --> 02:55:05.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:06.870 --> 02:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
i was just checking to make sure it all
 
02:55:14.150 --> 02:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:19.110 --> 02:55:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:19.120 --> 02:55:28.870 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:55:28.870 --> 02:55:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:28.880 --> 02:55:31.429 align:start position:0%
 
h

02:55:31.429 --> 02:55:31.439 align:start position:0%
h
 
02:55:33.750 --> 02:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
second anyone
 
02:55:35.510 --> 02:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
representative boehm
 
02:55:35.520 --> 02:55:36.710 align:start position:0%
representative boehm
uh

02:55:36.710 --> 02:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:55:38.150 --> 02:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
would representative
 
02:55:52.870 --> 02:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:54.630 --> 02:55:54.640 align:start position:0%
could you put your microphone on please
 
02:55:54.640 --> 02:55:55.990 align:start position:0%
could you put your microphone on please
sir

02:55:55.990 --> 02:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
sir
 
02:55:59.349 --> 02:55:59.359 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
02:56:01.510 --> 02:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
cte agreement
 
02:56:03.349 --> 02:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
is set up whereby
 
02:56:05.670 --> 02:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
we have all districts which are sending
 
02:56:07.830 --> 02:56:07.840 align:start position:0%
to the center
 
02:56:10.469 --> 02:56:10.479 align:start position:0%
and the center agreeing to
 
02:56:13.030 --> 02:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
a four four-year agreement how they're
 
02:56:15.830 --> 02:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
going to function and operate in terms
 
02:56:18.710 --> 02:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
of their scheduling
 
02:56:21.030 --> 02:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
classes that are taught transportation
 
02:56:24.309 --> 02:56:24.319 align:start position:0%
all that's in the rctea agreement
 
02:56:27.910 --> 02:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
and what the amendment does it then adds
 
02:56:30.070 --> 02:56:30.080 align:start position:0%
in that we're going to try to get all
 
02:56:31.670 --> 02:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
these districts
 
02:56:33.670 --> 02:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
into a
 
02:56:35.990 --> 02:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
similar schedule or as close as we can
 
02:56:37.750 --> 02:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
get the schedule
 
02:56:40.469 --> 02:56:40.479 align:start position:0%
the original bill said five days that
 
02:56:43.110 --> 02:56:43.120 align:start position:0%
were dissimilar days this has been
 
02:56:46.389 --> 02:56:46.399 align:start position:0%
changed to include 10 dissimilar days as
 
02:56:49.510 --> 02:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
requested by the directors
 
02:56:49.520 --> 02:56:50.389 align:start position:0%
requested by the directors
and

02:56:50.389 --> 02:56:50.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:56:52.710 --> 02:56:52.720 align:start position:0%
and by doing this
 
02:56:55.830 --> 02:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
it goes from after labor day through the
 
02:56:57.510 --> 02:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
last day so you're going to have a lot
 
02:56:59.349 --> 02:56:59.359 align:start position:0%
of dissimilar days of course on the
 
02:57:01.990 --> 02:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
front side of labor day
 
02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:02.790 align:start position:0%
front side of labor day
uh

02:57:02.790 --> 02:57:02.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:57:04.630 --> 02:57:04.640 align:start position:0%
seeing that different start times
 
02:57:06.469 --> 02:57:06.479 align:start position:0%
however from labor day onwards there's
 
02:57:10.070 --> 02:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
only 2 10 dissimilar days
 
02:57:11.190 --> 02:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
many of the
 
02:57:13.349 --> 02:57:13.359 align:start position:0%
regions are currently
 
02:57:15.590 --> 02:57:15.600 align:start position:0%
looking that we have 28 different
 
02:57:17.030 --> 02:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
centers and
 
02:57:19.830 --> 02:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
centers in our system of which five are
 
02:57:22.150 --> 02:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
out of state on the vermont side of the
 
02:57:22.160 --> 02:57:23.750 align:start position:0%
out of state on the vermont side of the
river

02:57:23.750 --> 02:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
river
 
02:57:23.760 --> 02:57:24.950 align:start position:0%
river
and

02:57:24.950 --> 02:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:57:27.670 --> 02:57:27.680 align:start position:0%
it's a challenge to get all the
 
02:57:29.670 --> 02:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
schedules on the same wavelength because
 
02:57:31.910 --> 02:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
we have negotiated agreements and that's
 
02:57:34.150 --> 02:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
why we have this four year period to try
 
02:57:36.469 --> 02:57:36.479 align:start position:0%
to arrive at this dissimilar
 
02:57:39.830 --> 02:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
get down to a december of only 10 days
 
02:57:41.910 --> 02:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
this is important from the standpoint of
 
02:57:44.309 --> 02:57:44.319 align:start position:0%
students attending the centers
 
02:57:46.309 --> 02:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
if you're on different calendar days
 
02:57:47.830 --> 02:57:47.840 align:start position:0%
like you have this day off a little
 
02:57:49.190 --> 02:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
vacation you have this one right here
 
02:57:51.590 --> 02:57:51.600 align:start position:0%
and they're not similar
 
02:57:53.429 --> 02:57:53.439 align:start position:0%
then you have kids which are going to
 
02:57:55.510 --> 02:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
the cte centers you have transportation
 
02:57:55.520 --> 02:57:56.469 align:start position:0%
the cte centers you have transportation
issues

02:57:56.469 --> 02:57:56.479 align:start position:0%
issues
 
02:57:58.550 --> 02:57:58.560 align:start position:0%
which the child has to get themselves to
 
02:57:59.990 --> 02:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
the school and then the school most
 
02:58:01.990 --> 02:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
school districts are providing that
 
02:58:05.110 --> 02:58:05.120 align:start position:0%
transportation to the center
 
02:58:07.030 --> 02:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
on a day that the
 
02:58:10.150 --> 02:58:10.160 align:start position:0%
ascending district's not in session for
 
02:58:12.870 --> 02:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
one reason or another but the center may
 
02:58:15.190 --> 02:58:15.200 align:start position:0%
be in session
 
02:58:17.429 --> 02:58:17.439 align:start position:0%
we're also trying to get our our
 
02:58:19.429 --> 02:58:19.439 align:start position:0%
schedule set up internally within the
 
02:58:21.910 --> 02:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
schools so that we're talking about the
 
02:58:23.990 --> 02:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
length of a course there's a real
 
02:58:25.750 --> 02:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
difference of course between new
 
02:58:27.349 --> 02:58:27.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire and the state of vermont where
 
02:58:29.349 --> 02:58:29.359 align:start position:0%
we have five of our centers
 
02:58:30.950 --> 02:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
where a cte
 
02:58:33.510 --> 02:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
course which is part of a program
 
02:58:36.070 --> 02:58:36.080 align:start position:0%
which has a cluster of courses within it
 
02:58:38.230 --> 02:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
uh is two hours over there it's an hour
 
02:58:40.150 --> 02:58:40.160 align:start position:0%
and a half here so when we ship kids
 
02:58:42.389 --> 02:58:42.399 align:start position:0%
over there there's a different
 
02:58:43.910 --> 02:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
arrival time you might arrive in the
 
02:58:45.750 --> 02:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
middle or the end and the same thing's
 
02:58:47.750 --> 02:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
occurring even internally within our own
 
02:58:49.429 --> 02:58:49.439 align:start position:0%
state so we're trying to get that
 
02:58:51.830 --> 02:58:51.840 align:start position:0%
internal schedules of the courses the
 
02:58:53.510 --> 02:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
block scheduling and all that squared
 
02:58:55.030 --> 02:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
away as well
 
02:58:57.110 --> 02:58:57.120 align:start position:0%
the second part which you'll see on the
 
02:58:59.349 --> 02:58:59.359 align:start position:0%
amendment which deals with and of course
 
02:59:01.190 --> 02:59:01.200 align:start position:0%
there's waivers for this let me get back
 
02:59:04.389 --> 02:59:04.399 align:start position:0%
to the waivers on the 10 day we know
 
02:59:06.550 --> 02:59:06.560 align:start position:0%
there's going to be emergencies we know
 
02:59:09.110 --> 02:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
there's going to be exceptions which are
 
02:59:10.469 --> 02:59:10.479 align:start position:0%
are very
 
02:59:13.030 --> 02:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh good exceptions that are needed
 
02:59:16.469 --> 02:59:16.479 align:start position:0%
we're living in one right now with covet
 
02:59:18.950 --> 02:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
and of course you have snow days and one
 
02:59:20.710 --> 02:59:20.720 align:start position:0%
part of the district may have a snow day
 
02:59:23.429 --> 02:59:23.439 align:start position:0%
here but there may be absolutely no snow
 
02:59:25.110 --> 02:59:25.120 align:start position:0%
on the other side that's typical new
 
02:59:27.190 --> 02:59:27.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire in places
 
02:59:30.150 --> 02:59:30.160 align:start position:0%
so so there can be requests that the
 
02:59:32.630 --> 02:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner approves for exceeding the
 
02:59:35.510 --> 02:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
10 days which are based upon emergency
 
02:59:38.309 --> 02:59:38.319 align:start position:0%
and exception but there's also
 
02:59:40.309 --> 02:59:40.319 align:start position:0%
another exception which we built into
 
02:59:42.230 --> 02:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
this with the the change in the
 
02:59:42.240 --> 02:59:43.269 align:start position:0%
this with the the change in the
amendment

02:59:43.269 --> 02:59:43.279 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:59:46.230 --> 02:59:46.240 align:start position:0%
that if the district's sending and the
 
02:59:46.240 --> 02:59:47.429 align:start position:0%
that if the district's sending and the
receiving

02:59:47.429 --> 02:59:47.439 align:start position:0%
receiving
 
02:59:47.439 --> 02:59:48.389 align:start position:0%
receiving
center

02:59:48.389 --> 02:59:48.399 align:start position:0%
center
 
02:59:50.870 --> 02:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
are working towards us actively working
 
02:59:53.429 --> 02:59:53.439 align:start position:0%
to try to get their
 
02:59:56.950 --> 02:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
calendars in line so they get into this
 
03:00:01.670 --> 03:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
10-day non-alignment requirement or less
 
03:00:04.710 --> 03:00:04.720 align:start position:0%
that they have through the ability to
 
03:00:04.720 --> 03:00:05.750 align:start position:0%
that they have through the ability to
through

03:00:05.750 --> 03:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
through
 
03:00:08.150 --> 03:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
july 1 2026
 
03:00:10.230 --> 03:00:10.240 align:start position:0%
to get this other exception done if
 
03:00:12.309 --> 03:00:12.319 align:start position:0%
they're all reasonably taking effort and
 
03:00:14.230 --> 03:00:14.240 align:start position:0%
working cooperatively and they're moving
 
03:00:15.830 --> 03:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
to that direction
 
03:00:17.830 --> 03:00:17.840 align:start position:0%
there's no reason why they should be
 
03:00:19.190 --> 03:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
harmed for doing what they should be
 
03:00:19.200 --> 03:00:20.630 align:start position:0%
harmed for doing what they should be
doing

03:00:20.630 --> 03:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
doing
 
03:00:23.830 --> 03:00:23.840 align:start position:0%
now the fourth part of this
 
03:00:25.349 --> 03:00:25.359 align:start position:0%
deals with
 
03:00:25.359 --> 03:00:26.150 align:start position:0%
deals with
the

03:00:26.150 --> 03:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:00:28.950 --> 03:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
embeddedness of competencies
 
03:00:32.550 --> 03:00:32.560 align:start position:0%
that into the courses at this rcte
 
03:00:35.910 --> 03:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
center we know that there's
 
03:00:38.469 --> 03:00:38.479 align:start position:0%
general requirements which we have based
 
03:00:40.870 --> 03:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
upon education 306
 
03:00:43.030 --> 03:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
that are required for you to graduate
 
03:00:45.190 --> 03:00:45.200 align:start position:0%
from a school in new hampshire every
 
03:00:47.349 --> 03:00:47.359 align:start position:0%
school has to offer 43 different courses
 
03:00:49.190 --> 03:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
but there are certain required courses
 
03:00:50.870 --> 03:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
that you must take
 
03:00:52.630 --> 03:00:52.640 align:start position:0%
and you have an option with the elective
 
03:00:52.640 --> 03:00:53.830 align:start position:0%
and you have an option with the elective
courses

03:00:53.830 --> 03:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
courses
 
03:00:57.110 --> 03:00:57.120 align:start position:0%
we have in some situations in the state
 
03:01:00.309 --> 03:01:00.319 align:start position:0%
where students which we now have in in
 
03:01:02.790 --> 03:01:02.800 align:start position:0%
manchester a kid can attend grades 9
 
03:01:05.990 --> 03:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
through 12 in a ct elsewhere in a state
 
03:01:07.510 --> 03:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
it's grades 10
 
03:01:08.870 --> 03:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
through 12.
 
03:01:10.389 --> 03:01:10.399 align:start position:0%
we know that there are some students
 
03:01:13.910 --> 03:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
that are unable to make the cte program
 
03:01:15.590 --> 03:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
which might be five miles from where
 
03:01:18.070 --> 03:01:18.080 align:start position:0%
their ascending school is due to the
 
03:01:19.910 --> 03:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
fact that the one course they need for
 
03:01:22.070 --> 03:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
graduation is being offered
 
03:01:25.030 --> 03:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
when the cte course and programs being
 
03:01:25.040 --> 03:01:25.990 align:start position:0%
when the cte course and programs being
offered

03:01:25.990 --> 03:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
offered
 
03:01:29.110 --> 03:01:29.120 align:start position:0%
at the receiving center
 
03:01:29.120 --> 03:01:30.309 align:start position:0%
at the receiving center
that's

03:01:30.309 --> 03:01:30.319 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:01:32.790 --> 03:01:32.800 align:start position:0%
that's contributing to the issue that in
 
03:01:35.110 --> 03:01:35.120 align:start position:0%
this state we only have 17 percent of
 
03:01:37.510 --> 03:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
our kids participating in cte
 
03:01:40.309 --> 03:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
that cte is necessary for prepare kids
 
03:01:43.110 --> 03:01:43.120 align:start position:0%
for the united states kids students for
 
03:01:45.269 --> 03:01:45.279 align:start position:0%
career and success in the past what they
 
03:01:47.269 --> 03:01:47.279 align:start position:0%
might choose but if we're denying the
 
03:01:47.279 --> 03:01:48.389 align:start position:0%
might choose but if we're denying the
opportunity

03:01:48.389 --> 03:01:48.399 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
03:01:50.469 --> 03:01:50.479 align:start position:0%
to attend the center do the fact there's
 
03:01:51.750 --> 03:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
a conflict
 
03:01:54.150 --> 03:01:54.160 align:start position:0%
in scheduling when in fact
 
03:01:56.150 --> 03:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
the competency which are taught in that
 
03:01:58.230 --> 03:01:58.240 align:start position:0%
course back in the high school maybe its
 
03:01:58.240 --> 03:01:59.670 align:start position:0%
course back in the high school maybe its
chemistry

03:01:59.670 --> 03:01:59.680 align:start position:0%
chemistry
 
03:02:01.349 --> 03:02:01.359 align:start position:0%
or mathematics
 
03:02:05.349 --> 03:02:05.359 align:start position:0%
are embedded into the course at the cte
 
03:02:08.550 --> 03:02:08.560 align:start position:0%
center or into the courses you get
 
03:02:10.950 --> 03:02:10.960 align:start position:0%
partial credit the way this is written
 
03:02:13.590 --> 03:02:13.600 align:start position:0%
on your partial competencies but
 
03:02:15.510 --> 03:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
remember when you're in a particular
 
03:02:18.389 --> 03:02:18.399 align:start position:0%
cluster whether it be a medical cluster
 
03:02:21.750 --> 03:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
or or a restaurant or in diesel
 
03:02:24.469 --> 03:02:24.479 align:start position:0%
mechanics or whatever or mathematics
 
03:02:26.710 --> 03:02:26.720 align:start position:0%
there's a number of courses
 
03:02:28.070 --> 03:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
and you could spread out these
 
03:02:28.080 --> 03:02:29.510 align:start position:0%
and you could spread out these
competencies

03:02:29.510 --> 03:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
competencies
 
03:02:31.830 --> 03:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
for that chemistry maybe in several
 
03:02:34.550 --> 03:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
different courses at the cte
 
03:02:37.030 --> 03:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
now the approval process for approving
 
03:02:39.990 --> 03:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
these competencies is not done through
 
03:02:41.910 --> 03:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
the state or the state board or the
 
03:02:44.389 --> 03:02:44.399 align:start position:0%
commissioner it's done by way of the
 
03:02:45.750 --> 03:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
agreement if you look at the way it's
 
03:02:48.630 --> 03:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
been reworded it's been reworded so it
 
03:02:51.030 --> 03:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
has to have the approval of the sending
 
03:02:51.040 --> 03:02:52.309 align:start position:0%
has to have the approval of the sending
district

03:02:52.309 --> 03:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
district
 
03:02:54.630 --> 03:02:54.640 align:start position:0%
and working with the
 
03:02:57.510 --> 03:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
career technical education center
 
03:02:59.830 --> 03:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
and that is i think conforms to where
 
03:03:01.910 --> 03:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
our discussion was when we uh discussed
 
03:03:04.230 --> 03:03:04.240 align:start position:0%
this earlier
 
03:03:05.830 --> 03:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
yeah and lastly
 
03:03:08.230 --> 03:03:08.240 align:start position:0%
um you're on board
 
03:03:08.240 --> 03:03:09.110 align:start position:0%
um you're on board
okay

03:03:09.110 --> 03:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:03:11.830 --> 03:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
uh so um and and the effective date of
 
03:03:14.630 --> 03:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
this as you can see july 1 2023 which
 
03:03:17.830 --> 03:03:17.840 align:start position:0%
was also a recommendation for change
 
03:03:19.990 --> 03:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
representative uh as the
 
03:03:21.349 --> 03:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
maker of the second
 
03:03:23.910 --> 03:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
yes just uh just a quickie i was on the
 
03:03:26.550 --> 03:03:26.560 align:start position:0%
committee that worked on this too and
 
03:03:29.269 --> 03:03:29.279 align:start position:0%
yeah it was a big diff and everybody's
 
03:03:32.150 --> 03:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
fighting it to align the calendar days
 
03:03:33.910 --> 03:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
and i remember when i was on the school
 
03:03:35.750 --> 03:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
board in litchfield we deliberately
 
03:03:37.750 --> 03:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
aligned it with hudson they're not
 
03:03:39.910 --> 03:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
playing those games anymore they're not
 
03:03:42.710 --> 03:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
but the problem with some districts like
 
03:03:46.150 --> 03:03:46.160 align:start position:0%
region 16 which is include hudson

in a cte and is in a single district i'm
 
03:04:19.750 --> 03:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
talking particularly conway
 
03:04:22.950 --> 03:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
do they have to also conform to this to
 
03:04:24.790 --> 03:04:24.800 align:start position:0%
the other ctes where they're only
 
03:04:27.990 --> 03:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
receiving students from the district
 
03:04:29.429 --> 03:04:29.439 align:start position:0%
if you you're going to have students
 
03:04:31.990 --> 03:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
coming in from uh another district two
 
03:04:33.429 --> 03:04:33.439 align:start position:0%
are you talking about no we just have we
 
03:04:35.110 --> 03:04:35.120 align:start position:0%

03:04:37.030 --> 03:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
district yeah two districts but in high
 
03:04:39.750 --> 03:04:39.760 align:start position:0%

03:04:47.269 --> 03:04:47.279 align:start position:0%
with the other ctes in the state under
 
03:04:49.429 --> 03:04:49.439 align:start position:0%

03:04:51.670 --> 03:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
state but for students which coming from
 
03:04:54.150 --> 03:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
sending schools to that if it's all in

okay thank you appreciate it
 
03:05:11.349 --> 03:05:11.359 align:start position:0%
representative porter thank you um rick
 
03:05:13.590 --> 03:05:13.600 align:start position:0%
i just have a quick a question about the
 
03:05:16.309 --> 03:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
partial credits
 
03:05:18.389 --> 03:05:18.399 align:start position:0%
for competencies what
 
03:05:21.830 --> 03:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
how does how would it work then if
 
03:05:23.990 --> 03:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
okay there's five credits let's say make
 
03:05:28.469 --> 03:05:28.479 align:start position:0%
it easy and the cte provide it covers
 
03:05:31.269 --> 03:05:31.279 align:start position:0%
three of those but the other two it does
 
03:05:32.389 --> 03:05:32.399 align:start position:0%
not cover
 
03:05:34.950 --> 03:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
how does that work then the
 
03:05:37.910 --> 03:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
local school is responsible for
 
03:05:40.070 --> 03:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
putting that kid into some course that
 
03:05:43.590 --> 03:05:43.600 align:start position:0%
will cover those two competencies
 
03:05:46.389 --> 03:05:46.399 align:start position:0%
the the whole process has to be approved
 
03:05:49.269 --> 03:05:49.279 align:start position:0%
and embedded in that rctea agreement
 
03:05:50.870 --> 03:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
so the schools are going to have to
 
03:05:53.030 --> 03:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
concur and work towards this end that
 
03:05:54.550 --> 03:05:54.560 align:start position:0%
you're talking about
 
03:05:56.950 --> 03:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
the there are some schools
 
03:05:58.950 --> 03:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
are already doing this right i i just
 
03:06:01.910 --> 03:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to know but it's up to the rcte
 
03:06:03.750 --> 03:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
agreement that that particular school
 
03:06:05.910 --> 03:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
district and the center
 
03:06:09.269 --> 03:06:09.279 align:start position:0%
the sending agree upon and this is all
 
03:06:10.950 --> 03:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
approved in there
 
03:06:13.190 --> 03:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
okay so uh i don't i don't think there
 
03:06:14.870 --> 03:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
should there'll be a lot yes there's
 
03:06:16.469 --> 03:06:16.479 align:start position:0%
going to be a lot of hurdles to jump
 
03:06:19.269 --> 03:06:19.279 align:start position:0%
because uh this is a tremendous step but
 
03:06:22.230 --> 03:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
we need to go there we need to get like
 
03:06:24.309 --> 03:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
delaware they have over 50 percent of
 
03:06:26.070 --> 03:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
their high school students participating
 
03:06:29.510 --> 03:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
at least one cte course we only have 17
 
03:06:31.429 --> 03:06:31.439 align:start position:0%
percent in this state we can ill afford
 
03:06:32.389 --> 03:06:32.399 align:start position:0%
to stay
 
03:06:34.469 --> 03:06:34.479 align:start position:0%
like that we got to do something thank
 
03:06:37.910 --> 03:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
you any further discussion uh questions
 
03:06:39.910 --> 03:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh seeing none um
 
03:06:41.830 --> 03:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
madam clerk could you call the role on
 
03:06:54.389 --> 03:06:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:57.750 --> 03:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
you can't do either way yeah or or
 
03:07:00.790 --> 03:07:00.800 align:start position:0%
on on on an amendment you can do a voice
 
03:07:03.750 --> 03:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
or you can raise a hand
 
03:07:05.190 --> 03:07:05.200 align:start position:0%
and this is actually good to lay out now
 
03:07:06.950 --> 03:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
because when we were when we were remote
 
03:07:08.150 --> 03:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
we had to roll
 
03:07:10.550 --> 03:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
right yeah that's right
 
03:07:11.910 --> 03:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
but we're all here and you're on
 
03:07:13.750 --> 03:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
amendment you can do that on the final
 
03:07:15.190 --> 03:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
you can't right
 
03:07:18.389 --> 03:07:18.399 align:start position:0%
yeah okay um in that case um
 
03:07:20.870 --> 03:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
maybe we can have a show of hands anyone
 
03:07:24.550 --> 03:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
uh supporting amendment three five six h
 
03:07:29.830 --> 03:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:31.910 --> 03:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
all right that looks to be everybody i
 
03:07:34.630 --> 03:07:34.640 align:start position:0%
don't anyone that i missed
 
03:07:36.309 --> 03:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
anyone that i missed
 
03:07:37.590 --> 03:07:37.600 align:start position:0%
raise their hand i think we got
 
03:07:40.309 --> 03:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
everybody in favor of the amendment
 
03:07:42.550 --> 03:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
so that would be uh
 
03:07:42.560 --> 03:07:44.150 align:start position:0%
so that would be uh
18

03:07:44.150 --> 03:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
18
 
03:07:48.389 --> 03:07:48.399 align:start position:0%

there's a lot to this bill and a lot
 
03:11:32.070 --> 03:11:32.080 align:start position:0%
that we have to address you know
 
03:11:33.510 --> 03:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
throughout this state
 
03:11:36.229 --> 03:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
and this still this bill is touching
 
03:11:36.239 --> 03:11:37.670 align:start position:0%
and this still this bill is touching
upon

03:11:37.670 --> 03:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
upon
 
03:11:39.990 --> 03:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of aspects and delving into
 
03:11:41.590 --> 03:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
certain elements
 
03:11:44.150 --> 03:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
and areas that comprise this bill in
 
03:11:46.389 --> 03:11:46.399 align:start position:0%
ways that we're doing it thoroughly and
 
03:11:49.110 --> 03:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
we're trying to ensure that all students
 
03:11:51.990 --> 03:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
in the state have that opportunity
 
03:11:52.000 --> 03:11:53.510 align:start position:0%
in the state have that opportunity
and

03:11:53.510 --> 03:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:11:54.950 --> 03:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
i i don't want to get into things like
 
03:11:56.950 --> 03:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
weighted formula but we know we have a
 
03:11:58.710 --> 03:11:58.720 align:start position:0%
constitutional issue going on in our
 
03:12:01.269 --> 03:12:01.279 align:start position:0%
state right now this bill is critical to
 
03:12:04.870 --> 03:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
our working in that direction and so i'd
 
03:12:07.349 --> 03:12:07.359 align:start position:0%
like to support absolutely support this
 
03:12:09.990 --> 03:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
interim study we need to do a lot more
 
03:12:11.990 --> 03:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
work and talking about not just talking
 
03:12:14.550 --> 03:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
we are every time we get into this
 
03:12:16.469 --> 03:12:16.479 align:start position:0%
we learn a little bit more maybe we
 
03:12:19.910 --> 03:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
should get information here or there
 
03:12:22.870 --> 03:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
i i think that's extremely exciting and
 
03:12:24.950 --> 03:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
so i'm hopeful that we can come out of
 
03:12:27.190 --> 03:12:27.200 align:start position:0%
the interim study and this would be
 
03:12:29.429 --> 03:12:29.439 align:start position:0%
as far as i'm concerned a real genuine
 
03:12:31.670 --> 03:12:31.680 align:start position:0%

who are cons
 
03:17:54.150 --> 03:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
i'm more concerned that there are 1800

i'm more concerned that there are 1800
students

students
 
03:17:57.990 --> 03:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
having an opportunity to get the
 
03:17:59.910 --> 03:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
education they need
 
03:18:01.269 --> 03:18:01.279 align:start position:0%
you know we've heard quite a bit of
 
03:18:03.510 --> 03:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
discussion this morning about
 
03:18:06.150 --> 03:18:06.160 align:start position:0%
the need for breakfast and the need for
 
03:18:09.429 --> 03:18:09.439 align:start position:0%
meals and how important that is i'm also
 
03:18:09.439 --> 03:18:10.550 align:start position:0%
meals and how important that is i'm also
important

03:18:10.550 --> 03:18:10.560 align:start position:0%

important
very

03:18:11.590 --> 03:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
very
 
03:18:14.550 --> 03:18:14.560 align:start position:0%
concerned about education
 
03:18:16.469 --> 03:18:16.479 align:start position:0%
academic achievement
 
03:18:19.670 --> 03:18:19.680 align:start position:0%
students being able to
 
03:18:24.309 --> 03:18:24.319 align:start position:0%
meet all their opportunities and goals
 
03:18:26.870 --> 03:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
and be the best they can be
 
03:18:30.070 --> 03:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:31.990 --> 03:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
in the best situation
 
03:18:34.630 --> 03:18:34.640 align:start position:0%
to meet those needs in a public school
 
03:18:34.640 --> 03:18:35.429 align:start position:0%
to meet those needs in a public school
then

03:18:35.429 --> 03:18:35.439 align:start position:0%
then
 
03:18:38.389 --> 03:18:38.399 align:start position:0%
i think that they need the opportunity
 
03:18:42.870 --> 03:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:46.710 --> 03:18:46.720 align:start position:0%
implement a budget for this program
 
03:18:46.720 --> 03:18:47.990 align:start position:0%
implement a budget for this program
and

03:18:47.990 --> 03:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:18:50.710 --> 03:18:50.720 align:start position:0%
kick kids out of a program that might be
 
03:18:53.429 --> 03:18:53.439 align:start position:0%
very successful for them
 
03:18:55.190 --> 03:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
i think that would be
 
03:18:55.200 --> 03:18:56.630 align:start position:0%
i think that would be
disastrous

03:18:56.630 --> 03:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
disastrous
 
03:18:58.790 --> 03:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
for many children who
 
03:19:00.469 --> 03:19:00.479 align:start position:0%
would experience
 
03:19:03.750 --> 03:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:05.510 --> 03:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
we need
 
03:19:07.429 --> 03:19:07.439 align:start position:0%
as a state
 
03:19:09.510 --> 03:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
as a country
 
03:19:12.469 --> 03:19:12.479 align:start position:0%
to provide the education
 
03:19:14.950 --> 03:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
that every child needs
 
03:19:17.830 --> 03:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
public education is also about educating
 
03:19:19.429 --> 03:19:19.439 align:start position:0%
the public
 
03:19:23.190 --> 03:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:25.590 --> 03:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
is there a discussion from the maker of
 
03:19:26.790 --> 03:19:26.800 align:start position:0%
the second
 
03:19:28.469 --> 03:19:28.479 align:start position:0%
mostly ditto
 
03:19:32.570 --> 03:19:32.580 align:start position:0%
um i do wonder do we
 
03:19:32.580 --> 03:19:34.389 align:start position:0%
um i do wonder do we

[Music]
 
03:19:36.630 --> 03:19:36.640 align:start position:0%
if we have students a whole bunch of
 
03:19:38.870 --> 03:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
students move into the state from out of
 
03:19:38.880 --> 03:19:39.910 align:start position:0%
students move into the state from out of
state

03:19:39.910 --> 03:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:19:42.229 --> 03:19:42.239 align:start position:0%
do we say well we didn't budget that
 
03:19:42.239 --> 03:19:43.190 align:start position:0%
do we say well we didn't budget that
many

03:19:43.190 --> 03:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
many
 
03:19:45.510 --> 03:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
for the amount that the state pays for
 
03:19:48.550 --> 03:19:48.560 align:start position:0%
those kids and tell them they can't go
 
03:19:51.190 --> 03:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
and i see that as sort of if we have
 
03:19:52.389 --> 03:19:52.399 align:start position:0%
these kids
 
03:19:54.469 --> 03:19:54.479 align:start position:0%
who decide they want to do this and we
 
03:19:56.070 --> 03:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
haven't budgeted for them because we
 
03:19:58.950 --> 03:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
didn't know they were going to be there
 
03:20:00.550 --> 03:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
i don't think we should be telling them
 
03:20:04.550 --> 03:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:07.030 --> 03:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
further discussion represent luna thank
 
03:20:09.990 --> 03:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
you very much mr chair so
 
03:20:11.590 --> 03:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
we budget for a lot of things in the
 
03:20:13.429 --> 03:20:13.439 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire in fact we every
 
03:20:14.950 --> 03:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
two years we
 
03:20:16.870 --> 03:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
create a thing called the um the
 
03:20:18.870 --> 03:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
biennial state budget
 
03:20:20.550 --> 03:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
and includes a lot of things that are
 
03:20:23.190 --> 03:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
really important to granite staters like
 
03:20:25.750 --> 03:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
dcyf caseworkers are budgeted do we have
 
03:20:25.760 --> 03:20:26.870 align:start position:0%
dcyf caseworkers are budgeted do we have
enough

03:20:26.870 --> 03:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
enough
 
03:20:29.030 --> 03:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
are we meeting the needs of those
 
03:20:30.710 --> 03:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
children what happens if we're not
 
03:20:32.070 --> 03:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
meeting the needs of those children what
 
03:20:34.389 --> 03:20:34.399 align:start position:0%
happens if we don't budget enough
 
03:20:39.590 --> 03:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:41.750 --> 03:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
we budget here in new hampshire we
 
03:20:43.750 --> 03:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
budget the number of caseworkers we have
 
03:20:46.790 --> 03:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
at dcyf taking care of
 
03:20:46.800 --> 03:20:47.750 align:start position:0%
at dcyf taking care of
looking

03:20:47.750 --> 03:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
looking
 
03:20:48.950 --> 03:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
out for
 
03:20:51.750 --> 03:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
the interests of our of our kids we put
 
03:20:54.389 --> 03:20:54.399 align:start position:0%
a budget on the um the developmentally
 
03:20:57.190 --> 03:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
disabled waiting list
 
03:20:59.110 --> 03:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
to try to keep that as small as possible
 
03:21:00.630 --> 03:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
when we don't budget enough guess what
 
03:21:00.640 --> 03:21:03.510 align:start position:0%
when we don't budget enough guess what
happens

03:21:03.510 --> 03:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:05.110 --> 03:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
it's not it
 
03:21:08.309 --> 03:21:08.319 align:start position:0%
it's not unthinkable to budget things
 
03:21:10.950 --> 03:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
here in the state and what that also
 
03:21:14.389 --> 03:21:14.399 align:start position:0%
does is it holds our leaders accountable
 
03:21:14.399 --> 03:21:15.670 align:start position:0%
does is it holds our leaders accountable
to

03:21:15.670 --> 03:21:15.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:21:18.070 --> 03:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
making reasonable estimations when
 
03:21:20.229 --> 03:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
putting forward a budget so what did we
 
03:21:21.590 --> 03:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
see last year
 
03:21:23.670 --> 03:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
when the efa program was budgeted
 
03:21:27.269 --> 03:21:27.279 align:start position:0%
commissioner of education this this is
 
03:21:29.269 --> 03:21:29.279 align:start position:0%
not even a year ago
 
03:21:31.030 --> 03:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
not even a year ago
 
03:21:34.630 --> 03:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
budget 129 000
 
03:21:38.150 --> 03:21:38.160 align:start position:0%
presented a 13-page
 
03:21:41.349 --> 03:21:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:44.950 --> 03:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:46.229 --> 03:21:46.239 align:start position:0%
that um
 
03:21:49.269 --> 03:21:49.279 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah that um that that
 
03:21:49.279 --> 03:21:50.630 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah that um that that
showed

03:21:50.630 --> 03:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
showed
 
03:21:50.640 --> 03:21:52.710 align:start position:0%
showed
showed

03:21:52.710 --> 03:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
showed
 
03:21:54.229 --> 03:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
28 students
 
03:21:56.630 --> 03:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
being expected to enroll in the first
 
03:21:59.030 --> 03:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
year and uh and actually i do have it
 
03:22:02.150 --> 03:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
it's on the back of this 21 of those
 
03:22:03.750 --> 03:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
transitioning directly from public
 
03:22:08.150 --> 03:22:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:10.389 --> 03:22:10.399 align:start position:0%
for from
 
03:22:10.399 --> 03:22:11.910 align:start position:0%
for from
from

03:22:11.910 --> 03:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
from
 
03:22:14.790 --> 03:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
students not in public schools and
 
03:22:18.630 --> 03:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
and three from from home education
 
03:22:21.510 --> 03:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
backgrounds going into the uh the efa
 
03:22:21.520 --> 03:22:22.550 align:start position:0%
backgrounds going into the uh the efa
program

03:22:22.550 --> 03:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
program
 
03:22:25.030 --> 03:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
so what do we find out wasn't it wasn't
 
03:22:27.910 --> 03:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
nearly what uh what was budgeted
 
03:22:29.830 --> 03:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
75 percent of the students did not come
 
03:22:33.030 --> 03:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
from public schools and um and end up
 
03:22:35.750 --> 03:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
providing a you know a
 
03:22:37.670 --> 03:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
realization in
 
03:22:40.469 --> 03:22:40.479 align:start position:0%
lower costs at the at the local level in
 
03:22:42.870 --> 03:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
fact only 17 percent of the students
 
03:22:45.110 --> 03:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
came directly from public schools and 83
 
03:22:46.950 --> 03:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
percent of the students came from
 
03:22:49.750 --> 03:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
private and home schools and uh and had
 
03:22:51.910 --> 03:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
actually come from private and many of
 
03:22:55.030 --> 03:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
those came from private and home schools
 
03:22:58.309 --> 03:22:58.319 align:start position:0%
um i'm sorry had already exited of those
 
03:23:00.309 --> 03:23:00.319 align:start position:0%
students all of those students who come
 
03:23:01.910 --> 03:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
from private and home schools had
 
03:23:03.590 --> 03:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
already exited their public school
 
03:23:05.190 --> 03:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
district so
 
03:23:07.670 --> 03:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
when um uh what does that mean for the
 
03:23:09.750 --> 03:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
state budget well the state budget
 
03:23:13.269 --> 03:23:13.279 align:start position:0%
included 129 000 for the fa program the
 
03:23:17.110 --> 03:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
actual cost for fy um
 
03:23:17.120 --> 03:23:18.550 align:start position:0%
actual cost for fy um
22

03:23:18.550 --> 03:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
22
 
03:23:21.750 --> 03:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
is closer to 8.1 million
 
03:23:24.630 --> 03:23:24.640 align:start position:0%
most of those students already attending
 
03:23:26.870 --> 03:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
private and home schools
 
03:23:26.880 --> 03:23:28.150 align:start position:0%
private and home schools
and

03:23:28.150 --> 03:23:28.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:23:30.469 --> 03:23:30.479 align:start position:0%
where do we see this going well hard to
 
03:23:32.710 --> 03:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
tell given what the uh given what the
 
03:23:35.110 --> 03:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner budgeted because um
 
03:23:38.389 --> 03:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
because um next year the uh the the
 
03:23:38.399 --> 03:23:39.510 align:start position:0%
because um next year the uh the the
commissioner

03:23:39.510 --> 03:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
03:23:43.830 --> 03:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
uh budgets for only um 649 students and
 
03:23:45.349 --> 03:23:45.359 align:start position:0%
we've already got
 
03:23:48.950 --> 03:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh almost a thousand more um students in
 
03:23:51.510 --> 03:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
again primarily that already came from
 
03:23:53.590 --> 03:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
home school and private school
 
03:23:53.600 --> 03:23:54.870 align:start position:0%
home school and private school
situations

03:23:54.870 --> 03:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
situations
 
03:23:56.070 --> 03:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
my understanding is we're going to be
 
03:23:58.710 --> 03:23:58.720 align:start position:0%
getting the actual numbers from from the
 
03:24:00.389 --> 03:24:00.399 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization going to
 
03:24:02.550 --> 03:24:02.560 align:start position:0%
provide a breakdown of
 
03:24:04.630 --> 03:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
of how many students came from home
 
03:24:04.640 --> 03:24:05.670 align:start position:0%
of how many students came from home
school

03:24:05.670 --> 03:24:05.680 align:start position:0%
school
 
03:24:07.750 --> 03:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
private school and public school when
 
03:24:10.309 --> 03:24:10.319 align:start position:0%
matriculating into the efa program so
 
03:24:13.910 --> 03:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
that we can know exactly what uh what
 
03:24:16.710 --> 03:24:16.720 align:start position:0%
the savings to local taxpayers
 
03:24:19.590 --> 03:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
uh has uh has been and which was a
 
03:24:19.600 --> 03:24:20.630 align:start position:0%
uh has uh has been and which was a
leading

03:24:20.630 --> 03:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
leading
 
03:24:21.990 --> 03:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
case made by
 
03:24:23.830 --> 03:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
the commissioner when when when
 
03:24:26.389 --> 03:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
supporting the education freedom account
 
03:24:30.229 --> 03:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
program i guess in the end
 
03:24:32.950 --> 03:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:35.670 --> 03:24:35.680 align:start position:0%
the program is no more important or no
 
03:24:37.590 --> 03:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
less important than so many other
 
03:24:39.510 --> 03:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
programs that we budget for here in the
 
03:24:42.469 --> 03:24:42.479 align:start position:0%
state and um and having a
 
03:24:44.950 --> 03:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
having the commissioner come in make the
 
03:24:47.110 --> 03:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
case for the budget
 
03:24:49.429 --> 03:24:49.439 align:start position:0%
would uh would would be appropriate
 
03:24:52.469 --> 03:24:52.479 align:start position:0%
rather than it being a um a blank check
 
03:24:54.550 --> 03:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
and what the amendment does
 
03:24:57.429 --> 03:24:57.439 align:start position:0%
is addresses i think concerns that were
 
03:24:58.710 --> 03:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
were aired
 
03:25:00.790 --> 03:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
during the uh during the public hearing
 
03:25:02.550 --> 03:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
on 1684
 
03:25:04.309 --> 03:25:04.319 align:start position:0%
uh that went along the lines of what are
 
03:25:05.269 --> 03:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
you going to do with the students
 
03:25:08.229 --> 03:25:08.239 align:start position:0%
already in so all the amendment does is
 
03:25:10.389 --> 03:25:10.399 align:start position:0%
for fy 22
 
03:25:12.710 --> 03:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
goes with the actual uh budgeted amount
 
03:25:16.070 --> 03:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
for um uh for this year based on the the
 
03:25:18.630 --> 03:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner's numbers and then for fy
 
03:25:23.429 --> 03:25:23.439 align:start position:0%
23 um adds on another group of students
 
03:25:25.990 --> 03:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
based on what the commissioner saw or
 
03:25:29.429 --> 03:25:29.439 align:start position:0%
marks down as efa switchers from 2021
 
03:25:31.190 --> 03:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
puts in the same number of students
 
03:25:34.150 --> 03:25:34.160 align:start position:0%
multiplies multiplied by the the average
 
03:25:34.160 --> 03:25:35.190 align:start position:0%
multiplies multiplied by the the average
efa

03:25:35.190 --> 03:25:35.200 align:start position:0%
efa
 
03:25:37.030 --> 03:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
so that we're not holding anything back
 
03:25:39.670 --> 03:25:39.680 align:start position:0%
for 22 and 23 and then by the time we
 
03:25:41.670 --> 03:25:41.680 align:start position:0%
get around to the next biennial budget
 
03:25:44.150 --> 03:25:44.160 align:start position:0%
cycle i think the commission will have a
 
03:25:46.550 --> 03:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
little bit better uh history with with
 
03:25:48.790 --> 03:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
how to budget this budgeted accurately
 
03:25:51.269 --> 03:25:51.279 align:start position:0%
and be held accountable to it thank you
 
03:25:52.630 --> 03:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
thank you

thank you chairman i appreciate the
 
03:26:00.070 --> 03:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity um i just want to bring a
 
03:26:02.710 --> 03:26:02.720 align:start position:0%
couple things out the the
 
03:26:04.950 --> 03:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
17 percent of the youngsters that
 
03:26:06.790 --> 03:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
withdrew from public school
 
03:26:09.590 --> 03:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
to participate in the efa program
 
03:26:11.429 --> 03:26:11.439 align:start position:0%
uh numerically that's if i had my math
 
03:26:14.150 --> 03:26:14.160 align:start position:0%
right or through the computer uh that's
 
03:26:18.550 --> 03:26:18.560 align:start position:0%
272 out of the 1600 or more kids i
 
03:26:21.590 --> 03:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
understand representative
 
03:26:23.910 --> 03:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
cordelli talking about the public edu
 
03:26:25.670 --> 03:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
public education and the public needs to
 
03:26:26.950 --> 03:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
be educated
 
03:26:29.670 --> 03:26:29.680 align:start position:0%
the public needs to be educated that 83
 
03:26:31.910 --> 03:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
of these kids weren't there the public
 
03:26:34.790 --> 03:26:34.800 align:start position:0%
needs to be educated that this tax money
 
03:26:36.469 --> 03:26:36.479 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about is going to
 
03:26:38.950 --> 03:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
private schools catholic schools
 
03:26:41.750 --> 03:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
religious schools not public schools or
 
03:26:43.910 --> 03:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
home schools that's that's part of the
 
03:26:45.429 --> 03:26:45.439 align:start position:0%
information that the public needs to
 
03:26:48.630 --> 03:26:48.640 align:start position:0%
know about their public tax dollars
 
03:26:49.510 --> 03:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
thank you

griffin lakers
 
03:26:53.750 --> 03:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
i was just going to ask a question but i
 
03:26:55.830 --> 03:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
will say that i have talked to numerous
 
03:26:57.670 --> 03:26:57.680 align:start position:0%
of those parents who say
 
03:26:59.990 --> 03:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
why isn't my kid as important as
 
03:27:02.550 --> 03:27:02.560 align:start position:0%
everybody else's kid and how come you're
 
03:27:04.790 --> 03:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
not willing to pay that little bit that
 
03:27:06.309 --> 03:27:06.319 align:start position:0%
little bit compared to the twenty
 
03:27:06.319 --> 03:27:07.269 align:start position:0%
little bit compared to the twenty
thousand

03:27:07.269 --> 03:27:07.279 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
03:27:09.429 --> 03:27:09.439 align:start position:0%
that four thousand for my kid to at
 
03:27:12.150 --> 03:27:12.160 align:start position:0%
least be able to get on school education
 
03:27:15.429 --> 03:27:15.439 align:start position:0%
but my question was um
 
03:27:16.200 --> 03:27:16.210 align:start position:0%
the number
 
03:27:16.210 --> 03:27:17.510 align:start position:0%
the number
[Music]

03:27:17.510 --> 03:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:27:21.110 --> 03:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
for those anticipated to come in next
 
03:27:23.670 --> 03:27:23.680 align:start position:0%
year do you know when that was made is
 
03:27:26.469 --> 03:27:26.479 align:start position:0%
that recent or is that a while ago so
 
03:27:29.670 --> 03:27:29.680 align:start position:0%
that number was uh was uh basic was from
 
03:27:32.070 --> 03:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
the efa fact sheet
 
03:27:34.870 --> 03:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
which was um provided by the department
 
03:27:35.990 --> 03:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
to the
 
03:27:38.790 --> 03:27:38.800 align:start position:0%
efa over is an oversight committee
 
03:27:41.510 --> 03:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh back in november of uh the end of
 
03:27:42.389 --> 03:27:42.399 align:start position:0%
last year
 
03:27:45.750 --> 03:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
so and my my understanding is that these
 
03:27:48.469 --> 03:27:48.479 align:start position:0%
are this is actual data from from this
 
03:27:50.710 --> 03:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
year so
 
03:27:54.630 --> 03:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:57.349 --> 03:27:57.359 align:start position:0%
further represent tanner
 
03:27:58.870 --> 03:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
03:28:01.910 --> 03:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
um i want to say that that for me i've
 
03:28:01.920 --> 03:28:03.510 align:start position:0%
um i want to say that that for me i've
been

03:28:03.510 --> 03:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
been
 
03:28:05.110 --> 03:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
really concerned about the
 
03:28:07.269 --> 03:28:07.279 align:start position:0%
accountability both financially and
 
03:28:09.349 --> 03:28:09.359 align:start position:0%
academically of the of the program the
 
03:28:12.229 --> 03:28:12.239 align:start position:0%
faa program but i'm also i'm
 
03:28:14.389 --> 03:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
particularly concerned because of my
 
03:28:16.309 --> 03:28:16.319 align:start position:0%
fiduciary responsibility to the
 
03:28:18.950 --> 03:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of new hampshire
 
03:28:20.790 --> 03:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
to allocate funds
 
03:28:23.190 --> 03:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
that are public funds that are
 
03:28:25.990 --> 03:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
reasonably budgeted and accounted for
 
03:28:26.000 --> 03:28:26.790 align:start position:0%
reasonably budgeted and accounted for
and

03:28:26.790 --> 03:28:26.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:28:28.710 --> 03:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
you know i serve on the
 
03:28:31.110 --> 03:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
school budget committee and i serve on
 
03:28:33.349 --> 03:28:33.359 align:start position:0%
the town budget committee the town i'm
 
03:28:33.359 --> 03:28:34.150 align:start position:0%
the town budget committee the town i'm
from

03:28:34.150 --> 03:28:34.160 align:start position:0%
from
 
03:28:37.510 --> 03:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
and in both those areas i've never seen
 
03:28:40.950 --> 03:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
an open checkbook i've never seen
 
03:28:43.510 --> 03:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
um a program that's or
 
03:28:46.150 --> 03:28:46.160 align:start position:0%
a department that's come in
 
03:28:48.630 --> 03:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
uh either in the public school system
 
03:28:51.670 --> 03:28:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:53.349 --> 03:28:53.359 align:start position:0%
the town itself
 
03:28:55.990 --> 03:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
that uh that the people from for example
 
03:28:58.309 --> 03:28:58.319 align:start position:0%
transportation come in and say
 
03:29:00.870 --> 03:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
okay uh we need to fix all the roads in
 
03:29:03.510 --> 03:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
in sunapee um i don't know exactly how
 
03:29:05.750 --> 03:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
much that's going to cost but we really
 
03:29:07.510 --> 03:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
need to so
 
03:29:09.910 --> 03:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
please give me an open checkbook
 
03:29:11.510 --> 03:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
and basically i think that's what we've
 
03:29:13.990 --> 03:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
given with this program
 
03:29:15.750 --> 03:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
i remember when
 
03:29:18.150 --> 03:29:18.160 align:start position:0%
193 came out with the
 
03:29:21.269 --> 03:29:21.279 align:start position:0%
first program of the education
 
03:29:24.550 --> 03:29:24.560 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund and i remember
 
03:29:27.429 --> 03:29:27.439 align:start position:0%
a very distinguished representative
 
03:29:28.790 --> 03:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
from where
 
03:29:30.309 --> 03:29:30.319 align:start position:0%
who had
 
03:29:32.550 --> 03:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
tremendous angst about the fact that
 
03:29:35.269 --> 03:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
there was not a cap on that program
 
03:29:35.279 --> 03:29:36.309 align:start position:0%
there was not a cap on that program
and

03:29:36.309 --> 03:29:36.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:29:38.150 --> 03:29:38.160 align:start position:0%
i just think that
 
03:29:40.469 --> 03:29:40.479 align:start position:0%
it makes sense to get the information
 
03:29:41.910 --> 03:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
out to the public
 
03:29:44.070 --> 03:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
through this budgeting
 
03:29:46.550 --> 03:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
what this program is actually costing
 
03:29:48.710 --> 03:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
for the 17 or
 
03:29:50.229 --> 03:29:50.239 align:start position:0%
of the of the
 
03:29:54.150 --> 03:29:54.160 align:start position:0%
participants uh versus the 160 000 kids
 
03:29:56.389 --> 03:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
that are still in public school
 
03:29:58.870 --> 03:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh that every penny in a public school
 
03:29:58.880 --> 03:29:59.990 align:start position:0%
uh that every penny in a public school
system

03:29:59.990 --> 03:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
system
 
03:30:03.750 --> 03:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
is accounted for and so that's my my
 
03:30:05.269 --> 03:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
major concern
 
03:30:06.710 --> 03:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:30:09.510 --> 03:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative nelson
 
03:30:11.990 --> 03:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
basically a question i'm curious as to
 
03:30:14.070 --> 03:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
what the cost is if somebody moves into
 
03:30:17.349 --> 03:30:17.359 align:start position:0%
town or city and what would the cost be
 
03:30:19.349 --> 03:30:19.359 align:start position:0%
for that child to walk into the
 
03:30:20.870 --> 03:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
classroom based on the budgets i think
 
03:30:22.870 --> 03:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
it's like twenty thousand of my way
 
03:30:24.229 --> 03:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
fifteen thousand
 
03:30:27.030 --> 03:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
versus them going through this program
 
03:30:29.349 --> 03:30:29.359 align:start position:0%
would it cost more or would it cost less
 
03:30:31.750 --> 03:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
to that town to educate one additional
 
03:30:31.760 --> 03:30:34.389 align:start position:0%
to that town to educate one additional
student

03:30:34.389 --> 03:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:36.790 --> 03:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
so uh you know i can i can respond to
 
03:30:40.309 --> 03:30:40.319 align:start position:0%
that by having spent 12 years on a
 
03:30:43.269 --> 03:30:43.279 align:start position:0%
school board but the marginal cost the
 
03:30:46.229 --> 03:30:46.239 align:start position:0%
incremental marginal cost of one student
 
03:30:48.070 --> 03:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
is not the same thing as the school
 
03:30:50.790 --> 03:30:50.800 align:start position:0%
budget divided by the adm or the
 
03:30:52.309 --> 03:30:52.319 align:start position:0%
enrollment of the student
 
03:30:55.429 --> 03:30:55.439 align:start position:0%
it's it's not that way in education it's
 
03:30:57.510 --> 03:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
not that way in business it's not that
 
03:30:59.190 --> 03:30:59.200 align:start position:0%
way for a lot of things
 
03:31:02.550 --> 03:31:02.560 align:start position:0%
um what you uh what what um what schools
 
03:31:04.710 --> 03:31:04.720 align:start position:0%
find and what uh what com what
 
03:31:07.429 --> 03:31:07.439 align:start position:0%
businesses find is that is that there
 
03:31:09.830 --> 03:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
tends to be a marginal cost when you
 
03:31:09.840 --> 03:31:11.110 align:start position:0%
tends to be a marginal cost when you
either

03:31:11.110 --> 03:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
either
 
03:31:13.510 --> 03:31:13.520 align:start position:0%
do one more thing
 
03:31:15.510 --> 03:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
have one more student come in it's not
 
03:31:18.870 --> 03:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
the average cost of what it costs to
 
03:31:22.309 --> 03:31:22.319 align:start position:0%
let's say educate a thousand students
 
03:31:25.510 --> 03:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
educating a thousand and one students
 
03:31:27.670 --> 03:31:27.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't increase that budget
 
03:31:29.990 --> 03:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
by the average cost per student it's a
 
03:31:32.950 --> 03:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
marginal cost per student so i would i
 
03:31:32.960 --> 03:31:35.110 align:start position:0%
marginal cost per student so i would i
would

03:31:35.110 --> 03:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
would
 
03:31:36.950 --> 03:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
i this is something that's actually
 
03:31:36.960 --> 03:31:37.990 align:start position:0%
i this is something that's actually
worth

03:31:37.990 --> 03:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
worth
 
03:31:41.269 --> 03:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
a i think a significant um economic
 
03:31:43.910 --> 03:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
study to better understand but i think
 
03:31:46.790 --> 03:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
an argument could be made that
 
03:31:49.349 --> 03:31:49.359 align:start position:0%
the uh that the marginal cost
 
03:31:53.030 --> 03:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh for a uh for for one additional
 
03:31:55.910 --> 03:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
public school student in the manchester
 
03:31:59.030 --> 03:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
school district may in fact be less than
 
03:32:02.309 --> 03:32:02.319 align:start position:0%
the um the the what the what the efa
 
03:32:02.319 --> 03:32:03.269 align:start position:0%
the um the the what the what the efa
program

03:32:03.269 --> 03:32:03.279 align:start position:0%
program
 
03:32:04.790 --> 03:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
03:32:06.790 --> 03:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
does in its um
 
03:32:08.389 --> 03:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
for its state allocation
 
03:32:10.389 --> 03:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
so but but that would be worthy i think
 
03:32:12.469 --> 03:32:12.479 align:start position:0%
of additional economic study
 
03:32:12.479 --> 03:32:16.950 align:start position:0%
of additional economic study
yes

03:32:16.950 --> 03:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:19.910 --> 03:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
i often see you know we have a student
 
03:32:21.670 --> 03:32:21.680 align:start position:0%
the school board will say
 
03:32:23.910 --> 03:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
we've increased our number of students
 
03:32:26.389 --> 03:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
so it's going to cost us another x
 
03:32:26.399 --> 03:32:28.229 align:start position:0%
so it's going to cost us another x
amount

03:32:28.229 --> 03:32:28.239 align:start position:0%
amount
 
03:32:30.150 --> 03:32:30.160 align:start position:0%
you know when kids come in now we have
 
03:32:31.429 --> 03:32:31.439 align:start position:0%
over the number that are allowed in the
 
03:32:33.429 --> 03:32:33.439 align:start position:0%
classroom 15 so now we have to have an
 
03:32:35.110 --> 03:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
extra teacher
 
03:32:36.950 --> 03:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
that's big expense that's adding it on i
 
03:32:38.150 --> 03:32:38.160 align:start position:0%
know where you're coming from and i
 
03:32:39.830 --> 03:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
agree but that's a big expense all of a
 
03:32:43.030 --> 03:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
sudden your budget ends up going 60 000
 
03:32:45.110 --> 03:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
so i just think where i understand where
 
03:32:46.229 --> 03:32:46.239 align:start position:0%
you're coming from but i think it's a
 
03:32:48.630 --> 03:32:48.640 align:start position:0%
budget game
 
03:32:50.710 --> 03:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
15 15 students
 
03:32:52.550 --> 03:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
times uh you know you
 
03:32:55.349 --> 03:32:55.359 align:start position:0%
15 students leading to a 60 000 increase
 
03:32:58.630 --> 03:32:58.640 align:start position:0%
cost would be would be a 4 000 marginal
 
03:33:01.830 --> 03:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
cost of per student not a 20 000
 
03:33:04.389 --> 03:33:04.399 align:start position:0%
marginal cost per student
 
03:33:05.590 --> 03:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
representative porter you've had your
 
03:33:08.550 --> 03:33:08.560 align:start position:0%
hand up yeah a couple of things mr chair
 
03:33:08.560 --> 03:33:09.750 align:start position:0%
hand up yeah a couple of things mr chair
so

03:33:09.750 --> 03:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:33:12.469 --> 03:33:12.479 align:start position:0%
for about 12 or 14 years my husband and
 
03:33:14.389 --> 03:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
i ran a private preschool and
 
03:33:14.399 --> 03:33:15.910 align:start position:0%
i ran a private preschool and
kindergarten

03:33:15.910 --> 03:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
kindergarten
 
03:33:17.590 --> 03:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
program in town
 
03:33:17.600 --> 03:33:17.850 align:start position:0%
program in town
and

03:33:17.850 --> 03:33:17.860 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:33:17.860 --> 03:33:19.190 align:start position:0%
and
[Music]

03:33:19.190 --> 03:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:33:21.670 --> 03:33:21.680 align:start position:0%
we had certain fixed expenses we had
 
03:33:23.269 --> 03:33:23.279 align:start position:0%
insurance we had
 
03:33:25.349 --> 03:33:25.359 align:start position:0%
you know the the heat and electricity
 
03:33:27.990 --> 03:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
and and phone service for the classroom
 
03:33:29.269 --> 03:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
we had
 
03:33:32.630 --> 03:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
supplies to buy we had all sorts of
 
03:33:34.070 --> 03:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
expenses that you would have in doing
 
03:33:34.080 --> 03:33:35.030 align:start position:0%
expenses that you would have in doing
that

03:33:35.030 --> 03:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:33:37.030 --> 03:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
and we were limited by the number of
 
03:33:39.750 --> 03:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
kids we could have by the size of our of
 
03:33:42.389 --> 03:33:42.399 align:start position:0%
our classroom
 
03:33:43.990 --> 03:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
when we
 
03:33:46.710 --> 03:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
lost a student we would get you know
 
03:33:48.710 --> 03:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
we'd have 10 kids enrolled
 
03:33:51.830 --> 03:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
we'd get a certain amount of income in
 
03:33:54.630 --> 03:33:54.640 align:start position:0%
if a student left
 
03:33:58.070 --> 03:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
that did not reduce any of those costs
 
03:33:59.590 --> 03:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
to us at all
 
03:34:02.070 --> 03:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
the only thing it reduced was the amount
 
03:34:04.469 --> 03:34:04.479 align:start position:0%
of income coming in
 
03:34:07.590 --> 03:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
so where that cost was absorbed was in
 
03:34:09.590 --> 03:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
the sal you know
 
03:34:13.590 --> 03:34:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:15.830 --> 03:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
that's what happens when a kid moves out
 
03:34:17.670 --> 03:34:17.680 align:start position:0%
of the public school
 
03:34:19.670 --> 03:34:19.680 align:start position:0%
it doesn't change
 
03:34:21.910 --> 03:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
how much it costs to run the buses for
 
03:34:22.910 --> 03:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
the other
 
03:34:26.870 --> 03:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
950 kids it doesn't change the amount of
 
03:34:29.190 --> 03:34:29.200 align:start position:0%
salaries or benefits for classroom
 
03:34:32.150 --> 03:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
teachers it doesn't change um the amount
 
03:34:33.429 --> 03:34:33.439 align:start position:0%
of fuel
 
03:34:35.910 --> 03:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
it takes to heat the building it doesn't
 
03:34:37.830 --> 03:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
change the maintenance costs the
 
03:34:40.229 --> 03:34:40.239 align:start position:0%
cleaning costs and all the other myriad
 
03:34:41.590 --> 03:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
of things that goes into running a
 
03:34:41.600 --> 03:34:43.429 align:start position:0%
of things that goes into running a
school

03:34:43.429 --> 03:34:43.439 align:start position:0%
school
 
03:34:46.150 --> 03:34:46.160 align:start position:0%
when we make the average
 
03:34:48.150 --> 03:34:48.160 align:start position:0%
cost per student
 
03:34:49.990 --> 03:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
and it comes out to be twenty thousand
 
03:34:50.000 --> 03:34:51.510 align:start position:0%
and it comes out to be twenty thousand
dollars

03:34:51.510 --> 03:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:34:53.910 --> 03:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
taking a child away is not going to
 
03:34:56.070 --> 03:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
reduce those costs by twenty thousand
 
03:34:56.080 --> 03:34:57.030 align:start position:0%
reduce those costs by twenty thousand
dollars

03:34:57.030 --> 03:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:34:59.269 --> 03:34:59.279 align:start position:0%
and i think that's something that we
 
03:35:01.190 --> 03:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
need to understand when we're talking
 
03:35:03.110 --> 03:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
about this and that the public needs to
 
03:35:03.120 --> 03:35:04.790 align:start position:0%
about this and that the public needs to
understand

03:35:04.790 --> 03:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
understand
 
03:35:07.030 --> 03:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
and the second issue that i i would like
 
03:35:09.429 --> 03:35:09.439 align:start position:0%
to address is something that um
 
03:35:11.670 --> 03:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
representative alec has mentioned about
 
03:35:13.670 --> 03:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
numbers of students moving into the
 
03:35:17.349 --> 03:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
state to take advantage of the program
 
03:35:19.990 --> 03:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering
 
03:35:23.429 --> 03:35:23.439 align:start position:0%
is the goal of this program to move many
 
03:35:25.670 --> 03:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
children from out of state
 
03:35:28.150 --> 03:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
into the state so they can receive these
 
03:35:30.950 --> 03:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
public dollars from the public schools
 
03:35:34.550 --> 03:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
to be home schooled is that what we are
 
03:35:36.950 --> 03:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
trying to do with this program
 
03:35:39.590 --> 03:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
or as the goal of this program i thought
 
03:35:43.110 --> 03:35:43.120 align:start position:0%
was to give low-income children a chance
 
03:35:45.429 --> 03:35:45.439 align:start position:0%
to attend a different
 
03:35:48.870 --> 03:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
educational setting if they needed to
 
03:35:50.630 --> 03:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
so i'm just throwing those two things
 
03:35:52.469 --> 03:35:52.479 align:start position:0%
out there for your consideration thank
 
03:35:54.790 --> 03:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative cordelli
 
03:35:57.110 --> 03:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman um if i could
 
03:36:02.469 --> 03:36:02.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:06.150 --> 03:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
in the past with all other states
 
03:36:08.550 --> 03:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
the projections for number of students
 
03:36:11.750 --> 03:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
enrolling in efa
 
03:36:13.670 --> 03:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
are a little bit different because now
 
03:36:16.309 --> 03:36:16.319 align:start position:0%
we are in a situation where we
 
03:36:18.309 --> 03:36:18.319 align:start position:0%
have a pandemic
 
03:36:21.670 --> 03:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
so those numbers um really are apples
 
03:36:24.309 --> 03:36:24.319 align:start position:0%
and oranges as it turns out
 
03:36:25.910 --> 03:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
and with the numbers provided by the
 
03:36:27.830 --> 03:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
department in november
 
03:36:27.840 --> 03:36:28.790 align:start position:0%
department in november
the

03:36:28.790 --> 03:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:36:31.190 --> 03:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
switcher number really if you look at
 
03:36:33.750 --> 03:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
the switchers including covid
 
03:36:37.510 --> 03:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
is 43 percent switchers
 
03:36:39.830 --> 03:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
point one uh two
 
03:36:41.910 --> 03:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
um it seems
 
03:36:44.150 --> 03:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
in terms of the arguments about
 
03:36:46.550 --> 03:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
dollars and so forth
 
03:36:49.030 --> 03:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
it seems that when
 
03:36:50.870 --> 03:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
enrollment increases
 
03:36:53.429 --> 03:36:53.439 align:start position:0%
all costs are variable
 
03:36:56.710 --> 03:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
but when enrollment decreases all costs
 
03:36:58.070 --> 03:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
are fixed
 
03:37:01.190 --> 03:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious about that and thirdly
 
03:37:04.389 --> 03:37:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:06.790 --> 03:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
discussions about this we've heard
 
03:37:06.800 --> 03:37:07.670 align:start position:0%
discussions about this we've heard
that

03:37:07.670 --> 03:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:37:09.670 --> 03:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
government funds are being sent to
 
03:37:11.750 --> 03:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
religious schools and private schools
 
03:37:13.429 --> 03:37:13.439 align:start position:0%
and so forth
 
03:37:15.429 --> 03:37:15.439 align:start position:0%
it's not the case
 
03:37:17.190 --> 03:37:17.200 align:start position:0%
government funds
 
03:37:21.110 --> 03:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
public funds are given to families
 
03:37:22.550 --> 03:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
families then
 
03:37:24.790 --> 03:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
make the choice of how those education
 
03:37:29.190 --> 03:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:32.550 --> 03:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
the court has ruled that way going back
 
03:37:32.560 --> 03:37:33.349 align:start position:0%
the court has ruled that way going back
to

03:37:33.349 --> 03:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:37:38.229 --> 03:37:38.239 align:start position:0%
pierce versus society of sisters in 1924
 
03:37:42.309 --> 03:37:42.319 align:start position:0%
zellman v simmons harris in 2022 and
 
03:37:45.110 --> 03:37:45.120 align:start position:0%
espinoza versus montana
 
03:37:47.590 --> 03:37:47.600 align:start position:0%
and quoting um
 
03:37:52.150 --> 03:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
uh the court in zellman versus harris
 
03:37:54.469 --> 03:37:54.479 align:start position:0%
the establishment clause permits neutral
 
03:37:56.389 --> 03:37:56.399 align:start position:0%
government programs
 
03:37:59.590 --> 03:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
where individuals individuals recipients
 
03:38:01.910 --> 03:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
of that money
 
03:38:04.950 --> 03:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
direct public aid to religious
 
03:38:08.389 --> 03:38:08.399 align:start position:0%
institutions or other institutions
 
03:38:08.399 --> 03:38:09.429 align:start position:0%
institutions or other institutions
to

03:38:09.429 --> 03:38:09.439 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:38:12.469 --> 03:38:12.479 align:start position:0%
exclude religious institutions would be
 
03:38:15.110 --> 03:38:15.120 align:start position:0%
discriminatory and you would have
 
03:38:17.990 --> 03:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
a host of lawyers in here
 
03:38:20.950 --> 03:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
the next day filing a lawsuit against
 
03:38:22.870 --> 03:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
can against new hampshire if we ever
 
03:38:26.229 --> 03:38:26.239 align:start position:0%
tried to do that we were told that um in
 
03:38:27.910 --> 03:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
a meeting um
 
03:38:30.389 --> 03:38:30.399 align:start position:0%
several years ago when we first
 
03:38:30.399 --> 03:38:31.349 align:start position:0%
several years ago when we first
well

03:38:31.349 --> 03:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:38:33.590 --> 03:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
second or third time we tried to pass an
 
03:38:35.349 --> 03:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
efa program
 
03:38:35.359 --> 03:38:36.229 align:start position:0%
efa program
but

03:38:36.229 --> 03:38:36.239 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:38:36.239 --> 03:38:38.830 align:start position:0%
but
um

03:38:38.830 --> 03:38:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:42.550 --> 03:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
to to limit the uh budget and let's talk
 
03:38:44.630 --> 03:38:44.640 align:start position:0%
about the education trust fund
 
03:38:46.790 --> 03:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
is not a budget it's it's an education
 
03:38:50.070 --> 03:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
trust fund in statute now if the trust
 
03:38:51.590 --> 03:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
fund needs money
 
03:38:53.990 --> 03:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
the governor takes a warrant to move
 
03:38:56.309 --> 03:38:56.319 align:start position:0%
monies from the general fund into the
 
03:38:59.030 --> 03:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
education trust fund because it is a
 
03:39:01.429 --> 03:39:01.439 align:start position:0%
priority to educate children
 
03:39:04.309 --> 03:39:04.319 align:start position:0%
the same thing would happen as this
 
03:39:08.870 --> 03:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:10.309 --> 03:39:10.319 align:start position:0%
we cannot
 
03:39:10.319 --> 03:39:11.269 align:start position:0%
we cannot
limit

03:39:11.269 --> 03:39:11.279 align:start position:0%
limit
 
03:39:13.349 --> 03:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
a program like this
 
03:39:16.309 --> 03:39:16.319 align:start position:0%
when it comes to education um it's
 
03:39:19.030 --> 03:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
unfair to the the children
 
03:39:22.630 --> 03:39:22.640 align:start position:0%
and just in terms of homeschoolers
 
03:39:24.630 --> 03:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers save this
 
03:39:24.640 --> 03:39:25.750 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers save this
state

03:39:25.750 --> 03:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:39:31.349 --> 03:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:32.950 --> 03:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
take the number of homeschoolers and
 
03:39:35.750 --> 03:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
multiply that by
 
03:39:39.510 --> 03:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:41.110 --> 03:39:41.120 align:start position:0%
to say that
 
03:39:42.790 --> 03:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers should not be involved in
 
03:39:42.800 --> 03:39:44.070 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers should not be involved in
this

03:39:44.070 --> 03:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:39:46.950 --> 03:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
you're saving a lot of money when
 
03:39:46.960 --> 03:39:48.710 align:start position:0%
you're saving a lot of money when
children

03:39:48.710 --> 03:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
children
 
03:39:51.110 --> 03:39:51.120 align:start position:0%
or families decide to home school
 
03:39:51.120 --> 03:39:51.990 align:start position:0%
or families decide to home school
so

03:39:51.990 --> 03:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:39:54.229 --> 03:39:54.239 align:start position:0%
again it's it's wrong to bring up
 
03:39:57.670 --> 03:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers as as possibly a draw or a
 
03:39:59.990 --> 03:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
negative when it comes to participation
 
03:40:01.590 --> 03:40:01.600 align:start position:0%
in this program
 
03:40:03.269 --> 03:40:03.279 align:start position:0%
um i think that's all i have for the
 
03:40:04.630 --> 03:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
moment anyway thank you very much
 
03:40:04.640 --> 03:40:06.790 align:start position:0%
moment anyway thank you very much
representative

03:40:06.790 --> 03:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:40:09.110 --> 03:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
a few things one my comment was not
 
03:40:10.790 --> 03:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
saying we should pull people in from
 
03:40:13.590 --> 03:40:13.600 align:start position:0%
other states to do this my comment was
 
03:40:15.030 --> 03:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
03:40:17.830 --> 03:40:17.840 align:start position:0%
if we had unexpected children coming
 
03:40:20.309 --> 03:40:20.319 align:start position:0%
from out of state to our public schools
 
03:40:23.189 --> 03:40:23.199 align:start position:0%
we would not say no you can't come
 
03:40:25.429 --> 03:40:25.439 align:start position:0%
because we didn't budget for you and so
 
03:40:27.510 --> 03:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
i was saying we should not do the same
 
03:40:30.150 --> 03:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
thing for other students
 
03:40:32.150 --> 03:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
who are in this state who decide to
 
03:40:34.710 --> 03:40:34.720 align:start position:0%
enroll in this and because we didn't
 
03:40:36.870 --> 03:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
expect them we should not be saying no
 
03:40:39.910 --> 03:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
you can't come this
 
03:40:41.750 --> 03:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
people talk about this a lot and they
 
03:40:43.670 --> 03:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
try to compare it to
 
03:40:46.950 --> 03:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
medicaid or other things that happen in
 
03:40:48.630 --> 03:40:48.640 align:start position:0%
the state that we don't provide for
 
03:40:50.710 --> 03:40:50.720 align:start position:0%
everybody and they say well it's not
 
03:40:52.630 --> 03:40:52.640 align:start position:0%
like other programs and my point is
 
03:40:54.550 --> 03:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
you're right it's not like other
 
03:40:57.349 --> 03:40:57.359 align:start position:0%
programs when it comes to health and
 
03:40:59.030 --> 03:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
that kind of stuff we don't provide
 
03:41:01.429 --> 03:41:01.439 align:start position:0%
health insurance for every person we
 
03:41:03.990 --> 03:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
provide an education that is what we're
 
03:41:06.389 --> 03:41:06.399 align:start position:0%
supposed to do provide an education for
 
03:41:07.830 --> 03:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
every student
 
03:41:09.590 --> 03:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
and this is what we're trying to do
 
03:41:11.990 --> 03:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
provide an education for every student
 
03:41:13.590 --> 03:41:13.600 align:start position:0%
and if you happen to
 
03:41:16.389 --> 03:41:16.399 align:start position:0%
if public school works out for you and
 
03:41:18.229 --> 03:41:18.239 align:start position:0%
you put your kids in public school and
 
03:41:19.990 --> 03:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
it works that's wonderful the state
 
03:41:21.910 --> 03:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
provides money
 
03:41:23.910 --> 03:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't work out for you why
 
03:41:25.429 --> 03:41:25.439 align:start position:0%
should you have to pay it all out of
 
03:41:26.950 --> 03:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
your own pocket which you don't
 
03:41:29.349 --> 03:41:29.359 align:start position:0%
necessarily have
 
03:41:31.510 --> 03:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
why can't the state provide that same
 
03:41:34.870 --> 03:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
money that they provide if public school
 
03:41:38.070 --> 03:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
works if public school doesn't work
 
03:41:38.080 --> 03:41:38.950 align:start position:0%
works if public school doesn't work
and

03:41:38.950 --> 03:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:41:41.429 --> 03:41:41.439 align:start position:0%
and i think the other thing is
 
03:41:43.750 --> 03:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
obviously it doesn't obviously there are
 
03:41:45.670 --> 03:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
marginal costs and they don't save that
 
03:41:48.550 --> 03:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
much money i want to know you said well
 
03:41:50.150 --> 03:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
for manchester it would be little well
 
03:41:51.830 --> 03:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
you picked the largest school district
 
03:41:53.429 --> 03:41:53.439 align:start position:0%
we have what about the small school
 
03:41:56.389 --> 03:41:56.399 align:start position:0%
districts when you have one come or one
 
03:41:59.189 --> 03:41:59.199 align:start position:0%
go how much does that cost and i would
 
03:42:00.790 --> 03:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
like to know i agree with you i would
 
03:42:02.150 --> 03:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
love to know
 
03:42:04.550 --> 03:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
what the marginal cost actually is
 
03:42:06.630 --> 03:42:06.640 align:start position:0%
because it's not like where she had a
 
03:42:10.070 --> 03:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
limited number of kids she could take
 
03:42:11.590 --> 03:42:11.600 align:start position:0%
and therefore
 
03:42:13.590 --> 03:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
you know she had very fixed costs that
 
03:42:14.870 --> 03:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
were going to be the same that's not
 
03:42:16.710 --> 03:42:16.720 align:start position:0%
like that in a public school
 
03:42:17.750 --> 03:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
you have
 
03:42:20.150 --> 03:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
you have kids not coming just because of
 
03:42:22.150 --> 03:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
demographics you know our numbers are
 
03:42:24.550 --> 03:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
shrinking just because of demographics
 
03:42:26.950 --> 03:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
and one kid plus or minus in the small
 
03:42:29.110 --> 03:42:29.120 align:start position:0%
schools can make a huge difference
 
03:42:30.950 --> 03:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
and and you know whether or not you have
 
03:42:32.309 --> 03:42:32.319 align:start position:0%
to have another teacher whether or not
 
03:42:34.710 --> 03:42:34.720 align:start position:0%
you have to run another bus whatever
 
03:42:36.550 --> 03:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:42:38.550 --> 03:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
i would like to know i agree with you i
 
03:42:40.469 --> 03:42:40.479 align:start position:0%
would love to know how much the marginal
 
03:42:43.990 --> 03:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
cost for each school district is
 
03:42:46.070 --> 03:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:42:47.990 --> 03:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock
 
03:42:49.510 --> 03:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
thank you this is one show all right
 
03:42:51.750 --> 03:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
okay um yeah we're on it i'll keep it
 
03:42:54.150 --> 03:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
short thank you uh i would just
 
03:42:55.670 --> 03:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
i think the
 
03:42:57.030 --> 03:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
going back to representative nelson's
 
03:42:58.550 --> 03:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
initial question about how much is one
 
03:42:59.910 --> 03:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
person cost
 
03:42:59.920 --> 03:43:00.870 align:start position:0%
person cost
uh

03:43:00.870 --> 03:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:43:00.880 --> 03:43:01.750 align:start position:0%
uh
the

03:43:01.750 --> 03:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:43:04.070 --> 03:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
heat as president reporter said the
 
03:43:06.710 --> 03:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
yellow school bus is going to show up
 
03:43:08.150 --> 03:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
without regardless of what you take out
 
03:43:09.830 --> 03:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
of there one more student coming in
 
03:43:10.790 --> 03:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
during the middle year is not going to
 
03:43:11.990 --> 03:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
change the budget because the budget's
 
03:43:13.910 --> 03:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
already set that's not going to change
 
03:43:15.750 --> 03:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
but representative quarterly does make a
 
03:43:17.349 --> 03:43:17.359 align:start position:0%
good point it's interesting how we do
 
03:43:19.830 --> 03:43:19.840 align:start position:0%
see enrollment go down school budgets
 
03:43:21.110 --> 03:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
but sometimes school budgets don't go
 
03:43:22.630 --> 03:43:22.640 align:start position:0%
down when aroma goes down and that's
 
03:43:24.630 --> 03:43:24.640 align:start position:0%
that's a whole different piece by itself
 
03:43:26.150 --> 03:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
but but the
 
03:43:28.870 --> 03:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
the idea of and i understand the supreme
 
03:43:30.150 --> 03:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
court rulings
 
03:43:33.670 --> 03:43:33.680 align:start position:0%
but it to me it's just semantics
 
03:43:35.269 --> 03:43:35.279 align:start position:0%
representative mullin gives me money for
 
03:43:38.229 --> 03:43:38.239 align:start position:0%
his tax money and i get it
 
03:43:40.710 --> 03:43:40.720 align:start position:0%
and i give it to a private school no
 
03:43:42.790 --> 03:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
different it's just a and i hate to use
 
03:43:44.309 --> 03:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
the word laundry because not but it's
 
03:43:46.710 --> 03:43:46.720 align:start position:0%
just it's just semantics our tax dollar
 
03:43:48.389 --> 03:43:48.399 align:start position:0%
is going right through me to
 
03:43:49.670 --> 03:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
representative ellison if he was the
 
03:43:51.830 --> 03:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
private school and that's that's where
 
03:43:53.030 --> 03:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
it is it's going to private religious
 
03:43:55.030 --> 03:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
school it's just semantics how it gets
 
03:43:57.590 --> 03:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
there has one more stop uh i think
 
03:43:59.429 --> 03:43:59.439 align:start position:0%
that's that's the feast and i do agree
 
03:44:03.030 --> 03:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
the the home school is would cost you
 
03:44:04.710 --> 03:44:04.720 align:start position:0%
as representative cordelia said a
 
03:44:06.950 --> 03:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
significant amount of dollars in the
 
03:44:09.910 --> 03:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
budget if they had been enrolled but
 
03:44:11.830 --> 03:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
they weren't
 
03:44:15.110 --> 03:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
so this is just giving them money
 
03:44:19.590 --> 03:44:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:22.950 --> 03:44:22.960 align:start position:0%
reps and hobson ralph i just have one
 
03:44:26.070 --> 03:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:26.080 --> 03:44:26.950 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:44:26.950 --> 03:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:44:29.030 --> 03:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh i just want to
 
03:44:30.710 --> 03:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
clarify something so
 
03:44:35.030 --> 03:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
if if a cost per student is 20 000
 
03:44:37.910 --> 03:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
we estimate that the education freedom
 
03:44:41.189 --> 03:44:41.199 align:start position:0%
amount is approximately 4 500 if they
 
03:44:44.630 --> 03:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
want to use it they have to apply for it
 
03:44:47.110 --> 03:44:47.120 align:start position:0%
it has to be approved expenses through
 
03:44:51.030 --> 03:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
approved resources correct so there is
 
03:44:52.070 --> 03:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
we'll say
 
03:44:54.070 --> 03:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
14 000
 
03:44:56.950 --> 03:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
from the local property tax that the
 
03:44:59.269 --> 03:44:59.279 align:start position:0%
district still gets
 
03:45:01.110 --> 03:45:01.120 align:start position:0%
with no student
 
03:45:04.469 --> 03:45:04.479 align:start position:0%
to educate do i have that correct
 
03:45:05.910 --> 03:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
so i'm assuming that question might have
 
03:45:08.229 --> 03:45:08.239 align:start position:0%
been directed to me that's only if this
 
03:45:10.790 --> 03:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
that's only if the student exits
 
03:45:13.269 --> 03:45:13.279 align:start position:0%
their public school district if they are
 
03:45:14.950 --> 03:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
already out of the public school
 
03:45:17.349 --> 03:45:17.359 align:start position:0%
district all it is is an additional
 
03:45:21.110 --> 03:45:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:24.150 --> 03:45:24.160 align:start position:0%
and so the the facts that that we've
 
03:45:26.070 --> 03:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
been presented by the department is that
 
03:45:29.030 --> 03:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
83 percent of the students did not exit
 
03:45:31.269 --> 03:45:31.279 align:start position:0%
their their public school
 
03:45:34.150 --> 03:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
directly to uh to to enter the efa
 
03:45:37.269 --> 03:45:37.279 align:start position:0%
program they were already either in
 
03:45:40.070 --> 03:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
private schools or home school settings
 
03:45:41.429 --> 03:45:41.439 align:start position:0%
uh having
 
03:45:43.910 --> 03:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
you know not not
 
03:45:47.510 --> 03:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
not costing the state um uh any expense
 
03:45:50.229 --> 03:45:50.239 align:start position:0%
uh at all so that's that you know that's
 
03:45:55.110 --> 03:45:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:57.349 --> 03:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
uh no representative litchfield's had
 
03:45:59.030 --> 03:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
her end up here she's waving it and then
 
03:46:00.229 --> 03:46:00.239 align:start position:0%
representing like us but i want to
 
03:46:02.070 --> 03:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
remind everybody that
 
03:46:03.429 --> 03:46:03.439 align:start position:0%
you know we're gonna have a lot of bills
 
03:46:04.870 --> 03:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
like this
 
03:46:06.630 --> 03:46:06.640 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:46:08.950 --> 03:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
if we want to keep going i'm i'm all for
 
03:46:10.790 --> 03:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
going but we're going to be whittling
 
03:46:14.710 --> 03:46:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:16.229 --> 03:46:16.239 align:start position:0%
but i think we're coming up to a bunch
 
03:46:27.030 --> 03:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:29.189 --> 03:46:29.199 align:start position:0%
okay great let's uh
 
03:46:31.110 --> 03:46:31.120 align:start position:0%
represent litchfield yeah yeah you know
 
03:46:33.670 --> 03:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
what i so i had an entire page of
 
03:46:35.510 --> 03:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
comments here's what i'm going to do
 
03:46:37.750 --> 03:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
first i'm now down to two representative
 
03:46:39.510 --> 03:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
luna um i understand where you're coming
 
03:46:42.229 --> 03:46:42.239 align:start position:0%
from and but i i also want to say like
 
03:46:44.630 --> 03:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
bonus points for giving us a um
 
03:46:46.389 --> 03:46:46.399 align:start position:0%
amendment with the three whole page
 
03:46:46.399 --> 03:46:47.349 align:start position:0%
amendment with the three whole page
punch

03:46:47.349 --> 03:46:47.359 align:start position:0%
punch
 
03:46:48.830 --> 03:46:48.840 align:start position:0%
really appreciated
 
03:46:51.750 --> 03:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
yeah almost swayed me all the way yeah
 
03:46:54.389 --> 03:46:54.399 align:start position:0%
um and then secondly um i think if i'm
 
03:46:55.910 --> 03:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
going to take one thing out of this is
 
03:46:57.910 --> 03:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
very important for me to convey is the
 
03:47:00.389 --> 03:47:00.399 align:start position:0%
fact that the messaging needs to be out
 
03:47:02.630 --> 03:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
there to the public that we are not
 
03:47:04.469 --> 03:47:04.479 align:start position:0%
taking money away from the public
 
03:47:07.510 --> 03:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
schools if the student is not attending
 
03:47:09.910 --> 03:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
the public school right
 
03:47:12.070 --> 03:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
whether it's private or wherever the
 
03:47:14.469 --> 03:47:14.479 align:start position:0%
money is not going to go to that public
 
03:47:16.870 --> 03:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
school anyway so there's just this
 
03:47:19.269 --> 03:47:19.279 align:start position:0%
misconception and i hear it all the time
 
03:47:20.790 --> 03:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
and i see it posted all the time on my
 
03:47:23.189 --> 03:47:23.199 align:start position:0%
own social media where people are saying
 
03:47:24.950 --> 03:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
you're you're taking away from the no
 
03:47:26.550 --> 03:47:26.560 align:start position:0%
we're not we are not taking it from the
 
03:47:28.710 --> 03:47:28.720 align:start position:0%
public school
 
03:47:28.720 --> 03:47:29.990 align:start position:0%
public school
perhaps

03:47:29.990 --> 03:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
03:47:31.110 --> 03:47:31.120 align:start position:0%
did you have
 
03:47:34.229 --> 03:47:34.239 align:start position:0%
i just had two things one is when we
 
03:47:35.910 --> 03:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
looked back like i had asked when the
 
03:47:38.469 --> 03:47:38.479 align:start position:0%
bill was introduced when we looked back
 
03:47:40.710 --> 03:47:40.720 align:start position:0%
at how many kids had left because of
 
03:47:43.830 --> 03:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
covid and taking that into consideration
 
03:47:47.189 --> 03:47:47.199 align:start position:0%
that it's 43 percent of the kids left
 
03:47:49.750 --> 03:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
public schools
 
03:47:52.550 --> 03:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
to go to this some of them just withdrew
 
03:47:55.110 --> 03:47:55.120 align:start position:0%
just you know the year prior because of
 
03:47:57.510 --> 03:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
coven and because their schools weren't
 
03:48:00.550 --> 03:48:00.560 align:start position:0%
open and it's not it and
 
03:48:02.790 --> 03:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
and and so you you need to count those
 
03:48:04.870 --> 03:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
into those who transferred because they
 
03:48:06.630 --> 03:48:06.640 align:start position:0%
left during covid when their school
 
03:48:07.990 --> 03:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
wasn't open
 
03:48:08.000 --> 03:48:08.870 align:start position:0%
wasn't open
and

03:48:08.870 --> 03:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:48:10.710 --> 03:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
so i think that's part of if there
 
03:48:12.950 --> 03:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
hadn't been covered i think all of these
 
03:48:14.870 --> 03:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
numbers would be different
 
03:48:17.830 --> 03:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
but but according to the doe it's 43
 
03:48:17.840 --> 03:48:19.030 align:start position:0%
but but according to the doe it's 43
percent

03:48:19.030 --> 03:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
percent
 
03:48:19.040 --> 03:48:20.150 align:start position:0%
percent
left

03:48:20.150 --> 03:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
left
 
03:48:22.150 --> 03:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
to go to this from public schools some
 
03:48:23.670 --> 03:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
of them just did it
 
03:48:25.349 --> 03:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
slightly earlier because they needed an
 
03:48:27.429 --> 03:48:27.439 align:start position:0%
education for their kids and their
 
03:48:29.349 --> 03:48:29.359 align:start position:0%
school wasn't meeting
 
03:48:31.189 --> 03:48:31.199 align:start position:0%
but the other thing is the difference
 
03:48:34.070 --> 03:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
it's not just semantics the difference
 
03:48:35.710 --> 03:48:35.720 align:start position:0%
in the part and it's very
 
03:48:38.229 --> 03:48:38.239 align:start position:0%
constitutionally important
 
03:48:40.070 --> 03:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
is that there's a choice and who makes
 
03:48:42.870 --> 03:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
the choice if the state makes the choice
 
03:48:46.150 --> 03:48:46.160 align:start position:0%
to give money to the private school
 
03:48:48.389 --> 03:48:48.399 align:start position:0%
then especially if it's a religious
 
03:48:52.389 --> 03:48:52.399 align:start position:0%
school then that's a state choosing
 
03:48:54.469 --> 03:48:54.479 align:start position:0%
to to send money or
 
03:48:56.150 --> 03:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
to a particular or supporting a
 
03:48:58.870 --> 03:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
particular religion whereas if it's the
 
03:49:00.790 --> 03:49:00.800 align:start position:0%
parent who chooses
 
03:49:02.790 --> 03:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
then it is not the state choosing and
 
03:49:05.750 --> 03:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
the state is not instituting or
 
03:49:08.070 --> 03:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
supporting a particular religion which
 
03:49:10.389 --> 03:49:10.399 align:start position:0%
is the religious which is the
 
03:49:12.950 --> 03:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
constitutional issue
 
03:49:15.110 --> 03:49:15.120 align:start position:0%
if you read it doesn't say separation of
 
03:49:16.790 --> 03:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
church and skate it doesn't say that
 
03:49:16.800 --> 03:49:18.469 align:start position:0%
church and skate it doesn't say that
anywhere

03:49:18.469 --> 03:49:18.479 align:start position:0%
anywhere
 
03:49:21.830 --> 03:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:23.990 --> 03:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
i just have to breathe it's jus it's a
 
03:49:27.110 --> 03:49:27.120 align:start position:0%
matter of the state supporting a
 
03:49:28.630 --> 03:49:28.640 align:start position:0%
particular or
 
03:49:30.790 --> 03:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh religious organization and if the
 
03:49:32.469 --> 03:49:32.479 align:start position:0%
state is just giving the money to the
 
03:49:35.030 --> 03:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
parent it is the parent supporting not
 
03:49:36.870 --> 03:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
the state supporting and that's why the
 
03:49:38.469 --> 03:49:38.479 align:start position:0%
cons that's why
 
03:49:41.189 --> 03:49:41.199 align:start position:0%
the supreme court keeps saying that no
 
03:49:43.510 --> 03:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
it is not the state's money and yes it
 
03:49:44.950 --> 03:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
can go there
 
03:49:47.269 --> 03:49:47.279 align:start position:0%
etc and i just wanted to point out
 
03:49:49.510 --> 03:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
that's the difference between the state
 
03:49:51.189 --> 03:49:51.199 align:start position:0%
just giving the money to the private
 
03:49:53.590 --> 03:49:53.600 align:start position:0%
school or the parent giving it it's a
 
03:49:56.150 --> 03:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
matter of choice and who chooses thank
 
03:50:01.269 --> 03:50:01.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:03.030 --> 03:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
okay folks uh
 
03:50:04.229 --> 03:50:04.239 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:50:05.830 --> 03:50:05.840 align:start position:0%
we gotta make a decision whether you
 
03:50:05.840 --> 03:50:07.030 align:start position:0%
we gotta make a decision whether you
know

03:50:07.030 --> 03:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:50:08.950 --> 03:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
you know it's i think we're moving on to
 
03:50:11.750 --> 03:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
the point where the gorge is still there
 
03:50:15.429 --> 03:50:15.439 align:start position:0%
and there's two sides of the gorge
 
03:50:17.590 --> 03:50:17.600 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
03:50:20.550 --> 03:50:20.560 align:start position:0%
represent waltz

promotion will be ought to pass
 
03:53:27.750 --> 03:53:27.760 align:start position:0%

03:53:30.469 --> 03:53:30.479 align:start position:0%
amendment yeah that's right exactly yeah
 
03:53:30.479 --> 03:53:31.830 align:start position:0%

03:53:34.389 --> 03:53:34.399 align:start position:0%
are you passing yourself now no
 
03:53:36.950 --> 03:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
no no no no no no no no
 
03:53:38.870 --> 03:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
could you just double check my bills
 
03:53:40.150 --> 03:53:40.160 align:start position:0%
that i'm
 
03:53:41.830 --> 03:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
telling lindsay
 
03:53:45.030 --> 03:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
11 30 yeah those those are for the 25th
 
03:53:46.710 --> 03:53:46.720 align:start position:0%
starting at nine o'clock right yeah
 
03:53:48.710 --> 03:53:48.720 align:start position:0%
those are hearings
 
03:53:51.429 --> 03:53:51.439 align:start position:0%
so so we're gonna have to set times
 
03:53:54.229 --> 03:53:54.239 align:start position:0%
um i just said you start at nine yeah oh
 
03:53:56.550 --> 03:53:56.560 align:start position:0%
i see but you gotta get so that'd be
 
03:53:57.910 --> 03:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
like nine
 
03:53:59.910 --> 03:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
and then eleven thirty
 
03:54:04.469 --> 03:54:04.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:06.950 --> 03:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
let's see uh nine to ten
 
03:54:09.030 --> 03:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
what's what is eleven thirty one
 
04:37:36.551 --> 04:37:36.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:39.269 --> 04:37:39.279 align:start position:0%
bill we had it's been heard
 
04:37:41.670 --> 04:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
so it's more technical advice for us
 
04:37:42.789 --> 04:37:42.799 align:start position:0%
right now
 
04:37:45.750 --> 04:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
saying i don't think we have a lot of
 
04:37:47.910 --> 04:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
engineers in this field here with us
 
04:37:47.920 --> 04:37:48.949 align:start position:0%
engineers in this field here with us
today

04:37:48.949 --> 04:37:48.959 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:37:50.709 --> 04:37:50.719 align:start position:0%
could you just look at some of the
 
04:37:52.949 --> 04:37:52.959 align:start position:0%
amending language which uh you know as a
 
04:37:54.949 --> 04:37:54.959 align:start position:0%
result of what the commissioner
 
04:37:56.629 --> 04:37:56.639 align:start position:0%
commissioner scott put in the letter
 
04:37:59.109 --> 04:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
that we received that's in there
 
04:37:59.119 --> 04:37:59.910 align:start position:0%
that we received that's in there
and

04:37:59.910 --> 04:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:38:03.830 --> 04:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:05.990 --> 04:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
sure so um
 
04:38:08.470 --> 04:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
the first the first item is kind of a
 
04:38:10.551 --> 04:38:10.561 align:start position:0%
change in the timing of the sampling
 
04:38:11.990 --> 04:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
that's required
 
04:38:14.230 --> 04:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
so since the bill
 
04:38:16.070 --> 04:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
since the original statute was put in
 
04:38:16.080 --> 04:38:16.949 align:start position:0%
since the original statute was put in
place

04:38:16.949 --> 04:38:16.959 align:start position:0%
place
 
04:38:19.990 --> 04:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
des has received funding from u.s epa
 
04:38:23.269 --> 04:38:23.279 align:start position:0%
that would cover two rounds of testing
 
04:38:25.349 --> 04:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
for public schools and licensed child
 
04:38:28.709 --> 04:38:28.719 align:start position:0%
care facilities that's federal funding
 
04:38:30.390 --> 04:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
you know the facilities were on their
 
04:38:32.070 --> 04:38:32.080 align:start position:0%
own to complete the first round of
 
04:38:33.990 --> 04:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
testing and most facilities have
 
04:38:36.789 --> 04:38:36.799 align:start position:0%
completed the first round of testing
 
04:38:39.349 --> 04:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
so the the change here would just be the
 
04:38:41.670 --> 04:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
ch to change the timing of the sampling
 
04:38:44.551 --> 04:38:44.561 align:start position:0%
rounds from every five years to
 
04:38:48.709 --> 04:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
completing three rounds by june 2024 and
 
04:38:50.390 --> 04:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
that's when the federal funding that we
 
04:38:53.429 --> 04:38:53.439 align:start position:0%
have to pay for the testing runs out and
 
04:38:55.510 --> 04:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
so that that was just the the change
 
04:38:57.990 --> 04:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
there to be able to provide the support
 
04:39:01.109 --> 04:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
um and we can cover the the lab costs
 
04:39:02.869 --> 04:39:02.879 align:start position:0%
for all public schools and licensed
 
04:39:04.629 --> 04:39:04.639 align:start position:0%
child care facilities
 
04:39:08.310 --> 04:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
so that's the first the first change
 
04:39:12.390 --> 04:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
um and then the next one is to
 
04:39:14.390 --> 04:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
a requirement that all the sample
 
04:39:17.830 --> 04:39:17.840 align:start position:0%
results be submitted to des
 
04:39:18.869 --> 04:39:18.879 align:start position:0%
we have a
 
04:39:21.510 --> 04:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
database where we've been tracking
 
04:39:23.910 --> 04:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
data and um
 
04:39:26.230 --> 04:39:26.240 align:start position:0%
we and and the original statute there
 
04:39:29.189 --> 04:39:29.199 align:start position:0%
was no requirement to submit the data to
 
04:39:31.590 --> 04:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
us and as we're going through and kind
 
04:39:33.910 --> 04:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
of looking back at facilities that
 
04:39:35.910 --> 04:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
didn't report data to us we're finding
 
04:39:37.590 --> 04:39:37.600 align:start position:0%
some that did the testing but they
 
04:39:39.670 --> 04:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
didn't provide us the data so this would
 
04:39:41.590 --> 04:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
just have that requirement in there that
 
04:39:44.150 --> 04:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
the data would be provided to des and
 
04:39:46.708 --> 04:39:46.718 align:start position:0%
then we can track it better uh you know
 
04:39:48.788 --> 04:39:48.798 align:start position:0%
people are interested in knowing how
 
04:39:50.230 --> 04:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
many schools have sampled and what the
 
04:39:52.788 --> 04:39:52.798 align:start position:0%
levels are and if we have a complete
 
04:39:54.390 --> 04:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
data set then we'll be able to better
 
04:39:56.628 --> 04:39:56.638 align:start position:0%
understand you know what um what the
 
04:39:58.550 --> 04:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
situation is
 
04:39:58.560 --> 04:40:00.830 align:start position:0%
situation is
and

04:40:00.830 --> 04:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:05.030 --> 04:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
then i think that next change was in the
 
04:40:07.430 --> 04:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
was in the with the notification i think
 
04:40:09.350 --> 04:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
that was in the original show
 
04:40:09.360 --> 04:40:10.788 align:start position:0%
that was in the original show
correct

04:40:10.788 --> 04:40:10.798 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:40:13.430 --> 04:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh and then the the change starting on
 
04:40:17.990 --> 04:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
line 19 is related to post remediation
 
04:40:20.470 --> 04:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
so if there's a fixture or drinking
 
04:40:23.590 --> 04:40:23.600 align:start position:0%
water fountain faucet that tests high
 
04:40:24.948 --> 04:40:24.958 align:start position:0%
they would need to do some sort of
 
04:40:28.070 --> 04:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
remediation either change out the faucet
 
04:40:31.030 --> 04:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
or put in potentially put in filtration
 
04:40:31.040 --> 04:40:32.150 align:start position:0%
or put in potentially put in filtration
but

04:40:32.150 --> 04:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:40:33.510 --> 04:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
most of the time we recommend changing
 
04:40:35.990 --> 04:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
out the faucet and then after you do
 
04:40:38.150 --> 04:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
that testing it's important to take
 
04:40:40.150 --> 04:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
another test
 
04:40:43.190 --> 04:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
to confirm that what you actually did
 
04:40:45.110 --> 04:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
remove the lead so if you change a
 
04:40:46.788 --> 04:40:46.798 align:start position:0%
faucet you want to retest it to make
 
04:40:48.948 --> 04:40:48.958 align:start position:0%
sure that that was actually the problem
 
04:40:50.708 --> 04:40:50.718 align:start position:0%
and the problem wasn't actually coming
 
04:40:53.590 --> 04:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
from somewhere else in the system and
 
04:40:55.910 --> 04:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
so the current statute doesn't have a
 
04:40:58.470 --> 04:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
requirement to do a retest
 
04:41:01.750 --> 04:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
in the case of remediation and so that's
 
04:41:04.948 --> 04:41:04.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:07.670 --> 04:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
and the last one is the 485
 
04:41:10.868 --> 04:41:10.878 align:start position:0%
correct the last one is the
 
04:41:13.270 --> 04:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement and penalties and in the
 
04:41:14.788 --> 04:41:14.798 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
04:41:17.990 --> 04:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh the rsa referenced a different rsa
 
04:41:20.470 --> 04:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
and so we recommended changing to this
 
04:41:22.948 --> 04:41:22.958 align:start position:0%
rsa which is the appropriate one that
 
04:41:25.030 --> 04:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
would um that you know that we typically
 
04:41:28.550 --> 04:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
use for these types of violations
 
04:41:30.150 --> 04:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
great that that takes through the
 
04:41:31.830 --> 04:41:31.840 align:start position:0%
changes there you notice there's a
 
04:41:34.390 --> 04:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
spelling mistake there on like 19 but
 
04:41:36.230 --> 04:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
that's a technical thing that's taken
 
04:41:37.190 --> 04:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
care of
 
04:41:39.190 --> 04:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
uh when it goes to review it's not
 
04:41:43.350 --> 04:41:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:44.788 --> 04:41:44.798 align:start position:0%
we don't want to go through mediation
 
04:41:44.798 --> 04:41:47.190 align:start position:0%
we don't want to go through mediation
here

04:41:47.190 --> 04:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:49.190 --> 04:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
yes represent boom
 
04:41:51.830 --> 04:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you question my question
 
04:41:51.840 --> 04:41:52.788 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you question my question
is

04:41:52.788 --> 04:41:52.798 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:41:55.910 --> 04:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
what happens after june 30th 2024 we
 
04:41:59.510 --> 04:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:00.550 --> 04:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
on line
 
04:42:00.560 --> 04:42:01.670 align:start position:0%
on line
five

04:42:01.670 --> 04:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
five
 
04:42:03.750 --> 04:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
so i think at that you know at that time
 
04:42:05.750 --> 04:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
if they if they had done all done the
 
04:42:08.150 --> 04:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
testing and the results were all less
 
04:42:09.990 --> 04:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
than the standard then they wouldn't
 
04:42:11.190 --> 04:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't need to do any more
 
04:42:11.200 --> 04:42:15.350 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't need to do any more
testing

04:42:15.350 --> 04:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:17.430 --> 04:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
okay represent luno
 
04:42:18.948 --> 04:42:18.958 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair and thanks
 
04:42:20.390 --> 04:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
very much um ms
 
04:42:20.400 --> 04:42:21.750 align:start position:0%
very much um ms
for

04:42:21.750 --> 04:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:42:23.510 --> 04:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
providing us with some technical support
 
04:42:25.030 --> 04:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
on this um
 
04:42:26.550 --> 04:42:26.560 align:start position:0%
sort of following up on what
 
04:42:27.990 --> 04:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
representative foam
 
04:42:29.990 --> 04:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
had asked i guess
 
04:42:31.510 --> 04:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
how would
 
04:42:35.430 --> 04:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:38.070 --> 04:42:38.080 align:start position:0%
applying for receiving federal funds
 
04:42:42.390 --> 04:42:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:43.990 --> 04:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
is complete on
 
04:42:46.628 --> 04:42:46.638 align:start position:0%
june 30th 2024.
 
04:42:48.550 --> 04:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
so the funding that we have is through
 
04:42:51.190 --> 04:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
the epa water improvement water
 
04:42:53.030 --> 04:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
infrastructure improvements for the
 
04:42:54.470 --> 04:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
nation act
 
04:42:56.708 --> 04:42:56.718 align:start position:0%
and we were originally told that this
 
04:42:58.628 --> 04:42:58.638 align:start position:0%
was kind of the last pot of money that
 
04:43:00.948 --> 04:43:00.958 align:start position:0%
was coming through that grant program we
 
04:43:02.788 --> 04:43:02.798 align:start position:0%
just received an allotment for this
 
04:43:05.030 --> 04:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
current federal fiscal year
 
04:43:07.110 --> 04:43:07.120 align:start position:0%
but with the bipartisan infrastructure
 
04:43:10.628 --> 04:43:10.638 align:start position:0%
law that was um recently passed they uh
 
04:43:12.390 --> 04:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
had said that there would be additional
 
04:43:14.788 --> 04:43:14.798 align:start position:0%
money coming through that wind
 
04:43:17.270 --> 04:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
that win program but we don't know
 
04:43:19.110 --> 04:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
the timing of that or what that look
 
04:43:23.190 --> 04:43:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:25.990 --> 04:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:26.000 --> 04:43:26.948 align:start position:0%
 
what

04:43:26.948 --> 04:43:26.958 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:43:28.310 --> 04:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
would the
 
04:43:31.510 --> 04:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
would the department be
 
04:43:33.590 --> 04:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
in a position then to
 
04:43:33.600 --> 04:43:34.550 align:start position:0%
in a position then to
to

04:43:34.550 --> 04:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:43:37.430 --> 04:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
apply for whatever grants may become
 
04:43:39.270 --> 04:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
available or
 
04:43:39.280 --> 04:43:40.390 align:start position:0%
available or
do

04:43:40.390 --> 04:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:43:43.270 --> 04:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
does that need to be in legislation
 
04:43:44.948 --> 04:43:44.958 align:start position:0%
um i think it would be the intention
 
04:43:47.190 --> 04:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
that we would apply for additional funds
 
04:43:51.510 --> 04:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:54.150 --> 04:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
are there can the department be of any
 
04:43:55.590 --> 04:43:55.600 align:start position:0%
further help to us
 
04:43:57.910 --> 04:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
on this
 
04:43:59.830 --> 04:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
yes represent nelson thank you mr
 
04:43:59.840 --> 04:44:01.030 align:start position:0%
yes represent nelson thank you mr
chairman

04:44:01.030 --> 04:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
04:44:03.670 --> 04:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
is each faucet or water fountain need to
 
04:44:05.030 --> 04:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
be tested
 
04:44:07.670 --> 04:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
yeah so each faucet that's available for
 
04:44:10.070 --> 04:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
consumption needs to be tested
 
04:44:12.628 --> 04:44:12.638 align:start position:0%
so if you have you know a sink in a
 
04:44:14.708 --> 04:44:14.718 align:start position:0%
janitor's closet that wouldn't need to
 
04:44:16.070 --> 04:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
be tested
 
04:44:17.990 --> 04:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
because hopefully no one's drinking out
 
04:44:20.708 --> 04:44:20.718 align:start position:0%
of that that sink um
 
04:44:22.788 --> 04:44:22.798 align:start position:0%
so but anything that is reasonably
 
04:44:24.948 --> 04:44:24.958 align:start position:0%
available for consumption and so that
 
04:44:26.628 --> 04:44:26.638 align:start position:0%
would include
 
04:44:28.550 --> 04:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
that would include faucets and kitchens
 
04:44:31.030 --> 04:44:31.040 align:start position:0%

representative luno
 
04:50:35.590 --> 04:50:35.600 align:start position:0%
discussion okay uh what what this does
 
04:50:37.750 --> 04:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
to the original bill
 
04:50:39.750 --> 04:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
you notice on lines
 
04:50:42.470 --> 04:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
five on line five of this
 
04:50:45.190 --> 04:50:45.200 align:start position:0%
it says shall invite a representative of
 
04:50:48.550 --> 04:50:48.560 align:start position:0%
the charter public school to the meeting
 
04:50:51.670 --> 04:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
the change down below on line eight for
 
04:50:53.830 --> 04:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
all subsequent meetings of the iep team
 
04:50:55.270 --> 04:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
the child's resident district shall
 
04:50:57.350 --> 04:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
provide prior notice too
 
04:50:59.430 --> 04:50:59.440 align:start position:0%
now this is where it changes from the
 
04:51:00.470 --> 04:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
way it was
 
04:51:02.070 --> 04:51:02.080 align:start position:0%
prior notice to the charter public
 
04:51:02.080 --> 04:51:03.030 align:start position:0%
prior notice to the charter public
school

04:51:03.030 --> 04:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:51:05.430 --> 04:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
now it says to the representative of the
 
04:51:07.670 --> 04:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
charter public school in conformance and
 
04:51:10.390 --> 04:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
alignment with what's on
 
04:51:12.948 --> 04:51:12.958 align:start position:0%
line five so you don't notice to a
 
04:51:15.510 --> 04:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
school you notice to a person
 
04:51:17.910 --> 04:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
and so this be rep to the representative
 
04:51:19.510 --> 04:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
that's uh
 
04:51:22.470 --> 04:51:22.480 align:start position:0%
of the chartered public school
 
04:51:24.070 --> 04:51:24.080 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
04:51:27.110 --> 04:51:27.120 align:start position:0%
so um sure and not to
 
04:51:29.910 --> 04:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
belabor a point where where it's a
 
04:51:33.110 --> 04:51:33.120 align:start position:0%
distinction without a difference but um
 
04:51:34.708 --> 04:51:34.718 align:start position:0%
but i i
 
04:51:34.718 --> 04:51:35.590 align:start position:0%
but i i
but

04:51:35.590 --> 04:51:35.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:51:38.788 --> 04:51:38.798 align:start position:0%
is is this amendment and actually the
 
04:51:40.230 --> 04:51:40.240 align:start position:0%
maybe the bill
 
04:51:43.830 --> 04:51:43.840 align:start position:0%
to um potentially
 
04:51:43.840 --> 04:51:45.190 align:start position:0%
to um potentially
clarify

04:51:45.190 --> 04:51:45.200 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
04:51:47.910 --> 04:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
something that might be looked at as
 
04:51:51.110 --> 04:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
being ambiguous in law whether the law
 
04:51:53.750 --> 04:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
only applied to the first meeting or all
 
04:51:55.590 --> 04:51:55.600 align:start position:0%
meetings i read it as the law would
 
04:51:57.350 --> 04:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
apply to all meetings while a child is
 
04:51:58.868 --> 04:51:58.878 align:start position:0%
enrolled by a parent in the chartered
 
04:52:00.470 --> 04:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
public schools i read it the same way
 
04:52:03.270 --> 04:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
yeah dave but uh evidently it hasn't
 
04:52:04.868 --> 04:52:04.878 align:start position:0%
been followed that way
 
04:52:07.670 --> 04:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
uh that we know of in all everywhere and
 
04:52:07.680 --> 04:52:08.390 align:start position:0%
uh that we know of in all everywhere and
uh

04:52:08.390 --> 04:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:52:11.030 --> 04:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
so just to clarify it's a clarifying
 
04:52:13.430 --> 04:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
that every iep
 
04:52:16.070 --> 04:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
and the members of the ieb team are
 
04:52:17.590 --> 04:52:17.600 align:start position:0%
notified by doing this the
 
04:52:20.230 --> 04:52:20.240 align:start position:0%
representative that's identified here
 
04:52:22.390 --> 04:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
will be notified whereas before it would
 
04:52:24.550 --> 04:52:24.560 align:start position:0%
be the building and that's not a member
 
04:52:27.190 --> 04:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
of the iep team that's the difference
 
04:52:29.510 --> 04:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
but the the building was actually part
 
04:52:32.150 --> 04:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
of the bill not part of the law
 
04:52:32.160 --> 04:52:34.310 align:start position:0%
of the bill not part of the law
yeah

04:52:34.310 --> 04:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:52:37.430 --> 04:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah right right right right so
 
04:52:40.150 --> 04:52:40.160 align:start position:0%
it's more clarification that notice goes
 
04:52:41.190 --> 04:52:41.200 align:start position:0%
out to
 
04:52:43.110 --> 04:52:43.120 align:start position:0%
that person yes
 
04:52:46.070 --> 04:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
and um it's clarifying and i don't think
 
04:52:48.150 --> 04:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
it hurts i actually i think it may you
 
04:52:48.160 --> 04:52:49.110 align:start position:0%
it hurts i actually i think it may you
know

04:52:49.110 --> 04:52:49.120 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:52:50.708 --> 04:52:50.718 align:start position:0%
improve upon so there won't be any
 
04:52:53.030 --> 04:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
interpretation that's that's
 
04:52:57.030 --> 04:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:58.868 --> 04:52:58.878 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
04:53:03.830 --> 04:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:03.840 --> 04:53:05.430 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:53:05.430 --> 04:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:08.470 --> 04:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
in that case um we'll take a
 
04:53:11.590 --> 04:53:11.600 align:start position:0%
hand vote on the amendment all those
 
04:53:13.030 --> 04:53:13.040 align:start position:0%

this bill
 
04:55:09.190 --> 04:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
relative to applications for a charter
 
04:55:19.110 --> 04:55:19.120 align:start position:0%

04:55:23.110 --> 04:55:23.120 align:start position:0%
you want to do this
 
04:55:33.270 --> 04:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:36.948 --> 04:55:36.958 align:start position:0%
uh house bill 1132 yes mr chair i'll
 
04:55:38.830 --> 04:55:38.840 align:start position:0%
move out to pass on 11
 
04:55:41.670 --> 04:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
32. thank you and do i have a second
 
04:55:45.670 --> 04:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:47.510 --> 04:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i think we've had our
 
04:55:49.430 --> 04:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
discussion hearing but i'll mention
 
04:55:51.350 --> 04:55:51.360 align:start position:0%
again that
 
04:55:53.270 --> 04:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
a charter conversion school is another
 
04:55:54.390 --> 04:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
way of
 
04:55:56.708 --> 04:55:56.718 align:start position:0%
developing a charter school within this
 
04:55:56.718 --> 04:55:59.270 align:start position:0%
developing a charter school within this
state

04:55:59.270 --> 04:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:00.788 --> 04:56:00.798 align:start position:0%
at this point in time i don't believe
 
04:56:02.628 --> 04:56:02.638 align:start position:0%
there are any charter conversion schools
 
04:56:05.670 --> 04:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
the process for doing that
 
04:56:09.830 --> 04:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
is by vote of the school board and then
 
04:56:11.750 --> 04:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
to become a charter school there are
 
04:56:14.628 --> 04:56:14.638 align:start position:0%
other conditions which are required
 
04:56:17.110 --> 04:56:17.120 align:start position:0%
one is you have a majority
 
04:56:20.788 --> 04:56:20.798 align:start position:0%
of its prospective prospective teachers
 
04:56:22.230 --> 04:56:22.240 align:start position:0%
and the teachers that are in the single
 
04:56:23.910 --> 04:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
district right now and that's two-thirds
 
04:56:23.920 --> 04:56:24.788 align:start position:0%
district right now and that's two-thirds
vote

04:56:24.788 --> 04:56:24.798 align:start position:0%
vote
 
04:56:26.390 --> 04:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
and the other is you have to have the
 
04:56:28.230 --> 04:56:28.240 align:start position:0%
approval of the superintendent and the
 
04:56:30.230 --> 04:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
principal in writing
 
04:56:33.430 --> 04:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
um this uh eliminates those latter two
 
04:56:36.788 --> 04:56:36.798 align:start position:0%
categories that i just uh indicated and
 
04:56:38.550 --> 04:56:38.560 align:start position:0%
and which i believe that there's
 
04:56:40.470 --> 04:56:40.480 align:start position:0%
rationale for doing that sometimes these
 
04:56:43.670 --> 04:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
teachers don't even live within the uh
 
04:56:45.510 --> 04:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
the district itself
 
04:56:49.030 --> 04:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
and it puts the um the option for going
 
04:56:51.430 --> 04:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
that route and a part of the school
 
04:56:53.910 --> 04:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
board and a majority vote of the
 
04:56:56.390 --> 04:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
folks that are in that school district
 
04:56:58.708 --> 04:56:58.718 align:start position:0%
at a rigor meeting or a special meeting
 
04:57:00.150 --> 04:57:00.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:57:02.310 --> 04:57:02.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative hopson anything
 
04:57:02.320 --> 04:57:05.270 align:start position:0%
thank you representative hopson anything
further

04:57:05.270 --> 04:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
further
 
04:57:06.708 --> 04:57:06.718 align:start position:0%
any other discussion i see
 
04:57:09.030 --> 04:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
representative porter's hand
 
04:57:10.788 --> 04:57:10.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
04:57:12.470 --> 04:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
i will be voting against the ought to
 
04:57:15.030 --> 04:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
pass on this for the reason that
 
04:57:19.190 --> 04:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
anybody can call a special meeting
 
04:57:19.200 --> 04:57:20.070 align:start position:0%
anybody can call a special meeting
50

04:57:20.070 --> 04:57:20.080 align:start position:0%
50
 
04:57:22.390 --> 04:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
it only takes 50 people to call one at a
 
04:57:24.628 --> 04:57:24.638 align:start position:0%
town or a school district
 
04:57:29.510 --> 04:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:29.520 --> 04:57:30.830 align:start position:0%
 
attendance

04:57:30.830 --> 04:57:30.840 align:start position:0%
attendance
 
04:57:33.350 --> 04:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
meeting and i believe that having it be
 
04:57:35.430 --> 04:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
a simple majority
 
04:57:37.190 --> 04:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
of those present
 
04:57:39.750 --> 04:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
to make such a major decision as this is
 
04:57:39.760 --> 04:57:41.430 align:start position:0%
to make such a major decision as this is
inappropriate

04:57:41.430 --> 04:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
inappropriate
 
04:57:43.590 --> 04:57:43.600 align:start position:0%
i believe that if you want to go this
 
04:57:46.070 --> 04:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
route you should have it at least be a
 
04:57:48.708 --> 04:57:48.718 align:start position:0%
three-fifths or a two-third vote
 
04:57:50.948 --> 04:57:50.958 align:start position:0%
of the membership of the voters at that
 
04:57:53.430 --> 04:57:53.440 align:start position:0%
meeting to because it's a major change
 
04:57:54.868 --> 04:57:54.878 align:start position:0%
for a district
 
04:57:57.110 --> 04:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
and it should not be a simple majority
 
04:57:59.030 --> 04:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
you could have a meeting
 
04:58:01.510 --> 04:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
with 50 people there
 
04:58:04.708 --> 04:58:04.718 align:start position:0%
and 26 of them vote for this
 
04:58:07.030 --> 04:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
and and end up changing your whole
 
04:58:09.190 --> 04:58:09.200 align:start position:0%
school district
 
04:58:12.470 --> 04:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
at the will of 26 people and i think
 
04:58:14.948 --> 04:58:14.958 align:start position:0%
that's a dangerous slippery slope to go
 
04:58:17.590 --> 04:58:17.600 align:start position:0%
down so i would highly recommend we vote
 
04:58:20.150 --> 04:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
against this bill or
 
04:58:23.670 --> 04:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
amend it to address that issue thank you
 
04:58:25.270 --> 04:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
thank you further
 
04:58:27.910 --> 04:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
discussion uh representative woodcock
 
04:58:29.750 --> 04:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman cordelli a couple of
 
04:58:29.760 --> 04:58:30.788 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman cordelli a couple of
points

04:58:30.788 --> 04:58:30.798 align:start position:0%
points
 
04:58:32.390 --> 04:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh when the bill or the charter school
 
04:58:33.590 --> 04:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
bill came in the conversion role
 
04:58:35.030 --> 04:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
initially came in
 
04:58:38.550 --> 04:58:38.560 align:start position:0%
it involved teachers and administrators
 
04:58:39.590 --> 04:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
from the schools that are going to be
 
04:58:39.600 --> 04:58:41.590 align:start position:0%
from the schools that are going to be
impacted

04:58:41.590 --> 04:58:41.600 align:start position:0%
impacted
 
04:58:43.270 --> 04:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
because that was their school
 
04:58:45.430 --> 04:58:45.440 align:start position:0%
and now they're taken out of the mix all
 
04:58:45.440 --> 04:58:46.628 align:start position:0%
and now they're taken out of the mix all
together

04:58:46.628 --> 04:58:46.638 align:start position:0%
together
 
04:58:48.390 --> 04:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
04:58:50.788 --> 04:58:50.798 align:start position:0%
their potential
 
04:58:52.550 --> 04:58:52.560 align:start position:0%
i see this more so though when
 
04:58:54.150 --> 04:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
representative was talking about this
 
04:58:54.160 --> 04:58:55.190 align:start position:0%
representative was talking about this
and

04:58:55.190 --> 04:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:58:57.270 --> 04:58:57.280 align:start position:0%
he talked about his outsourcing type of
 
04:58:59.350 --> 04:58:59.360 align:start position:0%
piece and i think the terms he uses
 
04:59:00.550 --> 04:59:00.560 align:start position:0%
saves money
 
04:59:01.990 --> 04:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
at that discussion i asked about
 
04:59:04.070 --> 04:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
examples and he indicated that well like
 
04:59:05.830 --> 04:59:05.840 align:start position:0%
a library service for instance
 
04:59:07.270 --> 04:59:07.280 align:start position:0%
uh you could close down the library and
 
04:59:08.550 --> 04:59:08.560 align:start position:0%
use the public library then we talked
 
04:59:10.708 --> 04:59:10.718 align:start position:0%
about the physical education pieces so
 
04:59:12.708 --> 04:59:12.718 align:start position:0%
it's really um
 
04:59:14.230 --> 04:59:14.240 align:start position:0%
in some respects i see this as an
 
04:59:15.990 --> 04:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to
 
04:59:18.230 --> 04:59:18.240 align:start position:0%
break or eliminate the teaching union
 
04:59:20.390 --> 04:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
the aft the nea if they're there because
 
04:59:21.910 --> 04:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
we start to go through this charter
 
04:59:23.510 --> 04:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
school we've taken out teachers we've
 
04:59:25.110 --> 04:59:25.120 align:start position:0%
taken our supervisors we've taken our
 
04:59:27.590 --> 04:59:27.600 align:start position:0%
principles we've taken out all educators
 
04:59:29.270 --> 04:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
and now we're going to say okay we're
 
04:59:31.190 --> 04:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
going to start outsourcing to save money
 
04:59:33.910 --> 04:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
so i i find this i find this bill the
 
04:59:36.310 --> 04:59:36.320 align:start position:0%
charter school provision for conversion
 
04:59:38.230 --> 04:59:38.240 align:start position:0%
initially made sense in terms of if you
 
04:59:39.990 --> 04:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
had a school within a school they wanted
 
04:59:41.350 --> 04:59:41.360 align:start position:0%
within a district they wanted to go that
 
04:59:43.750 --> 04:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
way thematically i get that i supported
 
04:59:45.830 --> 04:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
that then but not now when i see the
 
04:59:47.590 --> 04:59:47.600 align:start position:0%
union breaking money saving had nothing
 
04:59:49.270 --> 04:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
to do to improve education from my
 
04:59:49.280 --> 04:59:50.310 align:start position:0%
to do to improve education from my
perspective

04:59:50.310 --> 04:59:50.320 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
04:59:52.070 --> 04:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:59:54.948 --> 04:59:54.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:56.948 --> 04:59:56.958 align:start position:0%
uh representative ellison uh thank you
 
04:59:59.110 --> 04:59:59.120 align:start position:0%
mr chair i i guess this is a question to
 
05:00:02.230 --> 05:00:02.240 align:start position:0%
rick i and i raised this during the the
 
05:00:02.240 --> 05:00:03.270 align:start position:0%
rick i and i raised this during the the
hearing

05:00:03.270 --> 05:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
05:00:06.948 --> 05:00:06.958 align:start position:0%
and it gets to one of the issues that
 
05:00:08.470 --> 05:00:08.480 align:start position:0%
we've just heard about which is the
 
05:00:10.948 --> 05:00:10.958 align:start position:0%
labor agreements if there's a three-year
 
05:00:13.110 --> 05:00:13.120 align:start position:0%
contract in place between a school
 
05:00:15.910 --> 05:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
district and the teachers union
 
05:00:18.948 --> 05:00:18.958 align:start position:0%
and this process takes place at the end
 
05:00:21.990 --> 05:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
of year one and it goes to a
 
05:00:23.750 --> 05:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
china public school
 
05:00:25.830 --> 05:00:25.840 align:start position:0%
what happens to the
 
05:00:27.430 --> 05:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
agreement between the teachers and the
 
05:00:29.750 --> 05:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
school district for the next two years
 
05:00:32.230 --> 05:00:32.240 align:start position:0%
after we have a have a
 
05:00:35.190 --> 05:00:35.200 align:start position:0%
the conversion has taken place and i i i
 
05:00:36.550 --> 05:00:36.560 align:start position:0%
asked that question then i don't know
 
05:00:38.150 --> 05:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
that i have an answer to it i just would
 
05:00:40.230 --> 05:00:40.240 align:start position:0%
be interested in uh
 
05:00:41.670 --> 05:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
your opinion on that
 
05:00:43.670 --> 05:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
well i don't think that just because you
 
05:00:45.670 --> 05:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
have a charter conversion school means
 
05:00:47.510 --> 05:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to rid yourself of
 
05:00:49.270 --> 05:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
all the teachers within the building i
 
05:00:50.708 --> 05:00:50.718 align:start position:0%
don't agree with that
 
05:00:53.110 --> 05:00:53.120 align:start position:0%
and i also don't agree that that the
 
05:00:54.708 --> 05:00:54.718 align:start position:0%
those teachers in that building can't
 
05:00:57.030 --> 05:00:57.040 align:start position:0%
maintain their status as members of
 
05:00:59.190 --> 05:00:59.200 align:start position:0%
either nea or aft i don't have any
 
05:01:01.510 --> 05:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
problem with that either
 
05:01:01.520 --> 05:01:02.050 align:start position:0%
problem with that either
so

05:01:02.050 --> 05:01:02.060 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:01:02.060 --> 05:01:03.270 align:start position:0%
so
[Music]

05:01:03.270 --> 05:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:01:04.788 --> 05:01:04.798 align:start position:0%
as far as the agreements that are in
 
05:01:04.798 --> 05:01:05.670 align:start position:0%
as far as the agreements that are in
place

05:01:05.670 --> 05:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
place
 
05:01:07.270 --> 05:01:07.280 align:start position:0%
that those are issues which would have
 
05:01:09.510 --> 05:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
to be addressed between those designing
 
05:01:11.350 --> 05:01:11.360 align:start position:0%
that new charter and there was a whole
 
05:01:13.350 --> 05:01:13.360 align:start position:0%
process it's just one small part of the
 
05:01:15.670 --> 05:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
whole process for this occurring you'd
 
05:01:17.510 --> 05:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
have to look up in that part of the in
 
05:01:22.868 --> 05:01:22.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:25.430 --> 05:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh follow up
 
05:01:27.350 --> 05:01:27.360 align:start position:0%
just following that then
 
05:01:29.830 --> 05:01:29.840 align:start position:0%
it is possible then that
 
05:01:32.230 --> 05:01:32.240 align:start position:0%
a labor agreement in the discussion that
 
05:01:34.390 --> 05:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
took place going forward could be
 
05:01:34.400 --> 05:01:36.390 align:start position:0%
took place going forward could be
negated

05:01:36.390 --> 05:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
negated
 
05:01:38.788 --> 05:01:38.798 align:start position:0%
i would i i would say yes it could be
 
05:01:41.910 --> 05:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
negated or it could be continued
 
05:01:46.628 --> 05:01:46.638 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative
 
05:01:49.670 --> 05:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair and so um
 
05:01:52.070 --> 05:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
first of all i want to um sort of point
 
05:01:54.788 --> 05:01:54.798 align:start position:0%
out that i i probably made an amateur
 
05:01:56.310 --> 05:01:56.320 align:start position:0%
mistake on this
 
05:01:58.868 --> 05:01:58.878 align:start position:0%
i think this is the only bill that uh
 
05:02:01.270 --> 05:02:01.280 align:start position:0%
that at least on the line up here where
 
05:02:03.670 --> 05:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
we're in disagreement where where you
 
05:02:05.670 --> 05:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
are recommending ought to pass and we're
 
05:02:07.990 --> 05:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
recommending um itl
 
05:02:09.990 --> 05:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
and i think um we may have missed an
 
05:02:13.830 --> 05:02:13.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to prepare an amendment
 
05:02:15.750 --> 05:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
that might may have been able to address
 
05:02:16.948 --> 05:02:16.958 align:start position:0%
some of these
 
05:02:18.868 --> 05:02:18.878 align:start position:0%
some of these concerns so i'd like to
 
05:02:21.430 --> 05:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
put out three concerns that i think the
 
05:02:21.440 --> 05:02:22.550 align:start position:0%
put out three concerns that i think the
three

05:02:22.550 --> 05:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
three
 
05:02:25.430 --> 05:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
technical mechanical concerns that could
 
05:02:26.868 --> 05:02:26.878 align:start position:0%
be should be
 
05:02:29.510 --> 05:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
could be concerns for everybody
 
05:02:32.628 --> 05:02:32.638 align:start position:0%
in this room but also granite staters um
 
05:02:32.638 --> 05:02:34.310 align:start position:0%
in this room but also granite staters um
in

05:02:34.310 --> 05:02:34.320 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:02:37.350 --> 05:02:37.360 align:start position:0%
in every uh in every town
 
05:02:39.670 --> 05:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
and uh the first one i think marjorie
 
05:02:42.868 --> 05:02:42.878 align:start position:0%
porter brought up which is um which is
 
05:02:45.830 --> 05:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
could a could a conversion school
 
05:02:48.550 --> 05:02:48.560 align:start position:0%
somehow be forced into creation through
 
05:02:48.560 --> 05:02:49.270 align:start position:0%
somehow be forced into creation through
a

05:02:49.270 --> 05:02:49.280 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:02:52.948 --> 05:02:52.958 align:start position:0%
through a a very much minority minority
 
05:02:57.030 --> 05:02:57.040 align:start position:0%
minority um uh called special meeting
 
05:03:00.310 --> 05:03:00.320 align:start position:0%
with with 50 names where where
 
05:03:05.510 --> 05:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
um 50 people show up you know and
 
05:03:05.520 --> 05:03:06.628 align:start position:0%
um 50 people show up you know and
and

05:03:06.628 --> 05:03:06.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:03:08.310 --> 05:03:08.320 align:start position:0%
essentially put the town or put the
 
05:03:09.990 --> 05:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
school district into a position where it
 
05:03:12.070 --> 05:03:12.080 align:start position:0%
needs to um
 
05:03:13.990 --> 05:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
to um um
 
05:03:16.390 --> 05:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
you know to move forward with a uh with
 
05:03:18.948 --> 05:03:18.958 align:start position:0%
a with a charter conversion school
 
05:03:21.510 --> 05:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
um without the support of the of the
 
05:03:23.350 --> 05:03:23.360 align:start position:0%
school board the
 
05:03:25.750 --> 05:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
second concern would be
 
05:03:29.510 --> 05:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
how does this um read with respect to
 
05:03:32.550 --> 05:03:32.560 align:start position:0%
official ballot law so sb2 law where
 
05:03:35.510 --> 05:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
deliberative session um might be able to
 
05:03:38.550 --> 05:03:38.560 align:start position:0%
um to modify the warrant and put an
 
05:03:40.310 --> 05:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
article on here i just don't know the
 
05:03:42.070 --> 05:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
answers and and uh
 
05:03:44.390 --> 05:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
on it and then the third i think is one
 
05:03:45.750 --> 05:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
that um
 
05:03:49.110 --> 05:03:49.120 align:start position:0%
that patty cornell has um has brought up
 
05:03:51.430 --> 05:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
which is how will this apply to cities
 
05:03:53.990 --> 05:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
that don't have um uh annual school
 
05:03:55.590 --> 05:03:55.600 align:start position:0%
district meetings
 
05:03:58.868 --> 05:03:58.878 align:start position:0%
and and i think all are reasonable um
 
05:04:00.628 --> 05:04:00.638 align:start position:0%
um questions
 
05:04:04.070 --> 05:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh i would certainly appeal to the chair
 
05:04:07.590 --> 05:04:07.600 align:start position:0%
um if um if maybe we could uh be given a
 
05:04:09.750 --> 05:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
little this is not an early bill right
 
05:04:12.628 --> 05:04:12.638 align:start position:0%
no we're beyond that so to have time to
 
05:04:15.750 --> 05:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
um to maybe look into those and to to
 
05:04:15.760 --> 05:04:16.868 align:start position:0%
um to maybe look into those and to to
prepare

05:04:16.868 --> 05:04:16.878 align:start position:0%
prepare
 
05:04:16.878 --> 05:04:17.750 align:start position:0%
prepare
um

05:04:17.750 --> 05:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:21.670 --> 05:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
an amendment that um if if um
 
05:04:23.510 --> 05:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
if it's found that that yeah there's
 
05:04:25.590 --> 05:04:25.600 align:start position:0%
some holes in here that would be able to
 
05:04:27.510 --> 05:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
prepare an amendment i mean i think it
 
05:04:28.470 --> 05:04:28.480 align:start position:0%
is the
 
05:04:31.190 --> 05:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
i i mean i i i'm certainly i think we
 
05:04:33.270 --> 05:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
all feel that the work we do in the
 
05:04:36.070 --> 05:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
house tends to be very detail oriented
 
05:04:38.150 --> 05:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
maybe sometimes more often than what you
 
05:04:40.070 --> 05:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
find on the other side of the
 
05:04:43.510 --> 05:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
the um you know the wall so to speak
 
05:04:43.520 --> 05:04:45.430 align:start position:0%
the um you know the wall so to speak
and

05:04:45.430 --> 05:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:04:47.830 --> 05:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
be um well this is what
 
05:04:50.868 --> 05:04:50.878 align:start position:0%
we can see that privately well sure
 
05:04:52.310 --> 05:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
chair hunt used to say it pretty
 
05:04:54.390 --> 05:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
publicly i've done it on i've done it on
 
05:04:55.670 --> 05:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
the floor of the house
 
05:04:58.310 --> 05:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
um so uh but um
 
05:04:58.320 --> 05:04:59.270 align:start position:0%
um so uh but um
but

05:04:59.270 --> 05:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:05:01.030 --> 05:05:01.040 align:start position:0%
you know just uh just to make sure that
 
05:05:03.030 --> 05:05:03.040 align:start position:0%
that we're not stepping into something
 
05:05:04.868 --> 05:05:04.878 align:start position:0%
that that has a lot of unintended
 
05:05:06.788 --> 05:05:06.798 align:start position:0%
consequences that's that's all i'm
 
05:05:08.150 --> 05:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
putting out
 
05:05:10.470 --> 05:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
if i could just um mention about special
 
05:05:12.708 --> 05:05:12.718 align:start position:0%
meetings um
 
05:05:16.868 --> 05:05:16.878 align:start position:0%
we had a number of towns um
 
05:05:20.230 --> 05:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
the end of last year um have petitioned
 
05:05:23.430 --> 05:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
drives to establish special meetings
 
05:05:28.550 --> 05:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
um primarily in regard to mass mandates
 
05:05:28.560 --> 05:05:30.070 align:start position:0%
um primarily in regard to mass mandates
and

05:05:30.070 --> 05:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:05:32.948 --> 05:05:32.958 align:start position:0%
i believe in all those instances where a
 
05:05:36.070 --> 05:05:36.080 align:start position:0%
special meeting was held
 
05:05:38.390 --> 05:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
there was a ruling that
 
05:05:40.868 --> 05:05:40.878 align:start position:0%
the vote was not binding or in some
 
05:05:42.948 --> 05:05:42.958 align:start position:0%
cases um
 
05:05:44.788 --> 05:05:44.798 align:start position:0%
even though there was a petition
 
05:05:47.510 --> 05:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
as called for in the statutes the school
 
05:05:47.520 --> 05:05:48.628 align:start position:0%
as called for in the statutes the school
board

05:05:48.628 --> 05:05:48.638 align:start position:0%
board
 
05:05:50.310 --> 05:05:50.320 align:start position:0%
elected not to
 
05:05:53.110 --> 05:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
have that special meeting
 
05:05:55.510 --> 05:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
so i think the process for a special
 
05:05:58.708 --> 05:05:58.718 align:start position:0%
meeting is an open question um
 
05:05:59.750 --> 05:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
there was
 
05:05:59.760 --> 05:06:00.868 align:start position:0%
there was
some

05:06:00.868 --> 05:06:00.878 align:start position:0%
some
 
05:06:02.708 --> 05:06:02.718 align:start position:0%
movement about
 
05:06:05.910 --> 05:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
a lawsuit to challenge those rulings to
 
05:06:05.920 --> 05:06:07.270 align:start position:0%
a lawsuit to challenge those rulings to
clarify

05:06:07.270 --> 05:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
05:06:09.750 --> 05:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
the statute about special meetings so i
 
05:06:12.470 --> 05:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
would see special meetings as something
 
05:06:14.628 --> 05:06:14.638 align:start position:0%
um that is an open question and should
 
05:06:16.310 --> 05:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
not prevent us
 
05:06:17.830 --> 05:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
moving forward
 
05:06:19.750 --> 05:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
on that point
 
05:06:20.550 --> 05:06:20.560 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:06:23.270 --> 05:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
fair enough on on that glenn but you
 
05:06:25.510 --> 05:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
know in the case where we're
 
05:06:27.910 --> 05:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
we're any meeting um even an annual
 
05:06:29.750 --> 05:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
meeting i'm not sure
 
05:06:33.830 --> 05:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
um that uh that a uh that an article
 
05:06:36.628 --> 05:06:36.638 align:start position:0%
um with respect to masks
 
05:06:39.670 --> 05:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
uh would even be binding at a at an
 
05:06:43.030 --> 05:06:43.040 align:start position:0%
annual meeting um not much not less
 
05:06:44.550 --> 05:06:44.560 align:start position:0%
certainly um
 
05:06:46.868 --> 05:06:46.878 align:start position:0%
not a not a special meeting but in this
 
05:06:46.878 --> 05:06:47.830 align:start position:0%
not a not a special meeting but in this
case

05:06:47.830 --> 05:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
case
 
05:06:50.310 --> 05:06:50.320 align:start position:0%
it's it's clearly opening the door
 
05:06:53.590 --> 05:06:53.600 align:start position:0%
that that this is a an item
 
05:06:55.830 --> 05:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
that can that could be considered at
 
05:06:57.830 --> 05:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
either an annual meeting or a special
 
05:06:57.840 --> 05:06:58.708 align:start position:0%
either an annual meeting or a special
meeting

05:06:58.708 --> 05:06:58.718 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
05:07:00.948 --> 05:07:00.958 align:start position:0%
unlike a lot of you know like you can't
 
05:07:03.270 --> 05:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
you can't force the school district to
 
05:07:05.270 --> 05:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
run a lacrosse program if the school
 
05:07:06.868 --> 05:07:06.878 align:start position:0%
board doesn't want to do that even if
 
05:07:08.390 --> 05:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
you vote on it
 
05:07:08.400 --> 05:07:09.190 align:start position:0%
you vote on it
um

05:07:09.190 --> 05:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:11.590 --> 05:07:11.600 align:start position:0%
at a annual meeting so those those are
 
05:07:11.600 --> 05:07:13.110 align:start position:0%
at a annual meeting so those those are
non-binding

05:07:13.110 --> 05:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
non-binding
 
05:07:14.628 --> 05:07:14.638 align:start position:0%
things so this this i think would be
 
05:07:16.708 --> 05:07:16.718 align:start position:0%
binding because it opens
 
05:07:18.550 --> 05:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
the door that it should be considered at
 
05:07:19.670 --> 05:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
a meeting
 
05:07:21.990 --> 05:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh president boehm
 
05:07:24.390 --> 05:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman just to clarify
 
05:07:25.910 --> 05:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
things that the school board's got to
 
05:07:27.590 --> 05:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
propose it first before we have a
 
05:07:30.150 --> 05:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
special meeting and also for
 
05:07:32.948 --> 05:07:32.958 align:start position:0%
special meetings if people are notified
 
05:07:35.590 --> 05:07:35.600 align:start position:0%
then they don't come it's their
 
05:07:35.600 --> 05:07:36.948 align:start position:0%
then they don't come it's their
fault

05:07:36.948 --> 05:07:36.958 align:start position:0%
fault
 
05:07:38.708 --> 05:07:38.718 align:start position:0%
anyway also
 
05:07:41.430 --> 05:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
i can see this happening in large towns
 
05:07:44.230 --> 05:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
like hudson and derry and whatnot if the
 
05:07:47.110 --> 05:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
school population goes down they might
 
05:07:49.590 --> 05:07:49.600 align:start position:0%
be able to take one of their schools
 
05:07:51.350 --> 05:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
rather than closing it
 
05:07:54.390 --> 05:07:54.400 align:start position:0%
make it a charter conversion school so i
 
05:07:56.310 --> 05:07:56.320 align:start position:0%
think i think this is a good idea as a
 
05:07:59.430 --> 05:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
starting point thank you
 
05:08:00.830 --> 05:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
05:08:05.270 --> 05:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
lakers yes i think it's a great idea and
 
05:08:07.670 --> 05:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
i think having just the teachers instead
 
05:08:09.350 --> 05:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
of the town vote on it is sort of
 
05:08:11.670 --> 05:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest i think it really
 
05:08:13.910 --> 05:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
should be the town but i'm a little
 
05:08:17.350 --> 05:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
hesitant to make it
 
05:08:20.230 --> 05:08:20.240 align:start position:0%
just a simple majority i kind of like
 
05:08:22.550 --> 05:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
the three-fifths idea myself
 
05:08:24.310 --> 05:08:24.320 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
05:08:26.310 --> 05:08:26.320 align:start position:0%
various other of us sitting over here at
 
05:08:27.910 --> 05:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
the table kind of like the three-fifths
 
05:08:27.920 --> 05:08:29.590 align:start position:0%
the table kind of like the three-fifths
idea

05:08:29.590 --> 05:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
idea
 
05:08:31.830 --> 05:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
could we this isn't an early bill right
 
05:08:34.390 --> 05:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
so could we put an amendment to change
 
05:08:36.788 --> 05:08:36.798 align:start position:0%
it to instead a majority change it to
 
05:08:36.798 --> 05:08:37.990 align:start position:0%
it to instead a majority change it to
three-fifths

05:08:37.990 --> 05:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
three-fifths
 
05:08:41.350 --> 05:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:43.430 --> 05:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
or district or however that would work
 
05:08:44.788 --> 05:08:44.798 align:start position:0%
it would have to be the school voters
 
05:08:46.390 --> 05:08:46.400 align:start position:0%
present at the meeting
 
05:08:49.030 --> 05:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
right of the voters present but instead
 
05:08:51.510 --> 05:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
of a simple majority be a three-fifths i
 
05:08:53.830 --> 05:08:53.840 align:start position:0%
think it is a big thing
 
05:08:56.708 --> 05:08:56.718 align:start position:0%
and i do agree with rep porter that it
 
05:08:59.510 --> 05:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
should be a little bigger number and so
 
05:08:59.520 --> 05:09:00.470 align:start position:0%
should be a little bigger number and so
do

05:09:00.470 --> 05:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
do
 
05:09:03.430 --> 05:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
various of us over here think it's for
 
05:09:05.510 --> 05:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
such a big thing
 
05:09:07.830 --> 05:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
any other big things we have have to be
 
05:09:11.030 --> 05:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
passed by that much as well so
 
05:09:12.708 --> 05:09:12.718 align:start position:0%
well typically at meetings it's
 
05:09:12.718 --> 05:09:14.230 align:start position:0%
well typically at meetings it's
two-thirds

05:09:14.230 --> 05:09:14.240 align:start position:0%
two-thirds
 
05:09:17.990 --> 05:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
on on sb2 it's three-fifths
 
05:09:19.990 --> 05:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
right so we may have to put in wording
 
05:09:23.750 --> 05:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
that says two-thirds at a school at a
 
05:09:25.110 --> 05:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
meeting and
 
05:09:27.990 --> 05:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
fifths at a election however
 
05:09:30.708 --> 05:09:30.718 align:start position:0%
you know depending we will have you know
 
05:09:33.430 --> 05:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
right right and i think i think um
 
05:09:35.350 --> 05:09:35.360 align:start position:0%
um alicia what you're what you're
 
05:09:37.350 --> 05:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
getting at here really my sort of
 
05:09:40.788 --> 05:09:40.798 align:start position:0%
technical concerns with with this um
 
05:09:42.788 --> 05:09:42.798 align:start position:0%
that that maybe
 
05:09:45.910 --> 05:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
having a little more time to to get uh
 
05:09:48.868 --> 05:09:48.878 align:start position:0%
get a full understanding of of how does
 
05:09:50.708 --> 05:09:50.718 align:start position:0%
this read with sb2
 
05:09:52.310 --> 05:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
how does this read with cities that
 
05:09:55.510 --> 05:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
don't have annual or special meetings
 
05:09:55.520 --> 05:09:56.550 align:start position:0%
don't have annual or special meetings
um

05:09:56.550 --> 05:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:58.070 --> 05:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
how does this read with the special
 
05:09:59.990 --> 05:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
meeting law uh and then maybe a
 
05:10:01.670 --> 05:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
three-fifths or two-thirds depending
 
05:10:04.310 --> 05:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
upon what your um what you've adopted
 
05:10:07.830 --> 05:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
for uh official ballot
 
05:10:09.510 --> 05:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
because it should be the same as going
 
05:10:11.990 --> 05:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
to full-time kindergarten right the same
 
05:10:15.430 --> 05:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
one yeah fraction president boehm yeah i
 
05:10:17.910 --> 05:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
think that also since this is a big
 
05:10:19.990 --> 05:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
thing for the town i think it would just
 
05:10:22.310 --> 05:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
be at the regular annual meeting and
 
05:10:24.390 --> 05:10:24.400 align:start position:0%
just remove the special
 
05:10:26.390 --> 05:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
meeting just that i mean it's something
 
05:10:28.628 --> 05:10:28.638 align:start position:0%
that can take a lot of discussion so it
 
05:10:30.150 --> 05:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be just a special meeting it
 
05:10:31.750 --> 05:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
should be at the annual
 
05:10:31.760 --> 05:10:32.788 align:start position:0%
should be at the annual
film

05:10:32.788 --> 05:10:32.798 align:start position:0%
film
 
05:10:35.990 --> 05:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
no i think what we ought to do
 
05:10:37.590 --> 05:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
i i think what we ought to do at this
 
05:10:39.670 --> 05:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
point in time is that because there is
 
05:10:41.590 --> 05:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
you know i'm i'm just going back when
 
05:10:43.510 --> 05:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
you go for school building aid you're
 
05:10:44.868 --> 05:10:44.878 align:start position:0%
not going to do it with just a majority
 
05:10:47.670 --> 05:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
vote you've got to have a a larger vote
 
05:10:49.590 --> 05:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
than that i can't recall was two-thirds
 
05:10:51.910 --> 05:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
or three-fifths it's one or the other
 
05:10:54.628 --> 05:10:54.638 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:10:56.868 --> 05:10:56.878 align:start position:0%
yeah two-thirds of those present at the
 
05:10:56.878 --> 05:10:57.830 align:start position:0%
yeah two-thirds of those present at the
meeting

05:10:57.830 --> 05:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
05:11:00.310 --> 05:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
and so and i have no objections that
 
05:11:02.628 --> 05:11:02.638 align:start position:0%
either um
 
05:11:05.510 --> 05:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
i i you know when i wrote this i had
 
05:11:07.190 --> 05:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
concerns with the idea of a special
 
05:11:08.550 --> 05:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
meeting as well
 
05:11:10.948 --> 05:11:10.958 align:start position:0%
um i'm not convinced that that's the way
 
05:11:12.230 --> 05:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
to travel there this should be at a
 
05:11:13.510 --> 05:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
regular meeting
 
05:11:15.430 --> 05:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
one that's people are used to coming to
 
05:11:17.670 --> 05:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
because it is a huge jump
 
05:11:19.910 --> 05:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
so i would suggest to you know mr chair
 
05:11:22.628 --> 05:11:22.638 align:start position:0%
that um we um
 
05:11:24.550 --> 05:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
just recess any action on on this
 
05:11:27.590 --> 05:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
particular bill until we can uh
 
05:11:28.628 --> 05:11:28.638 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:11:29.990 --> 05:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
take into account some of the discussion
 
05:11:32.390 --> 05:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
we've had here
 
05:11:32.400 --> 05:11:33.910 align:start position:0%
we've had here
okay

05:11:33.910 --> 05:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:11:35.830 --> 05:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock thank you i
 
05:11:37.030 --> 05:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
05:11:38.708 --> 05:11:38.718 align:start position:0%
i know that representative is moving
 
05:11:40.550 --> 05:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
this to another venue or another off
 
05:11:42.470 --> 05:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
time period i appreciate that i do want
 
05:11:43.590 --> 05:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
to uh if we're going to do some
 
05:11:45.910 --> 05:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
clarification i'd i would like to uh go
 
05:11:47.830 --> 05:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
back to what my colleague here to my
 
05:11:49.190 --> 05:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
left asked about the collective
 
05:11:51.350 --> 05:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement when nate green was
 
05:11:53.670 --> 05:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
here from d.o.e uh without the
 
05:11:55.270 --> 05:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
information we just had now when he was
 
05:11:58.390 --> 05:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
here from d.o.e he said 194b14
 
05:12:00.390 --> 05:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
the collective bargaining group that
 
05:12:02.868 --> 05:12:02.878 align:start position:0%
that union could not transfer it to the
 
05:12:05.030 --> 05:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
school they could the charter school or
 
05:12:07.990 --> 05:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
the new conversion school could have a
 
05:12:11.110 --> 05:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
union but the union that they came from
 
05:12:13.190 --> 05:12:13.200 align:start position:0%
is that that is correct that's not what
 
05:12:15.110 --> 05:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
we just said we could have a union
 
05:12:17.190 --> 05:12:17.200 align:start position:0%
yes the union they left
 
05:12:19.430 --> 05:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
is gone they have the style or if they
 
05:12:21.510 --> 05:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
choose to in the charter school so that
 
05:12:23.750 --> 05:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
so that unit has been negated it's been
 
05:12:23.760 --> 05:12:24.948 align:start position:0%
so that unit has been negated it's been
eliminated

05:12:24.948 --> 05:12:24.958 align:start position:0%
eliminated
 
05:12:26.150 --> 05:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
um so the dialogue between
 
05:12:28.550 --> 05:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
representative ellison and ladd uh it
 
05:12:30.150 --> 05:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
left the the illusion at least to me
 
05:12:32.550 --> 05:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
anyhow that the union was fine it's not
 
05:12:35.110 --> 05:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
fine the union is gone
 
05:12:36.948 --> 05:12:36.958 align:start position:0%
so i just want to make that clear as we
 
05:12:39.110 --> 05:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
go back into the uh you're gonna we
 
05:12:40.470 --> 05:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
clarify it again
 
05:12:41.670 --> 05:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for the permission to speak
 
05:12:44.948 --> 05:12:44.958 align:start position:0%
represent cornell representative mullen
 
05:12:47.430 --> 05:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for uh
 
05:12:49.270 --> 05:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
taking my comments
 
05:12:51.670 --> 05:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
um with regards to the section that
 
05:12:54.830 --> 05:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
eliminates the faculty and
 
05:12:58.310 --> 05:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
superintendent and principal from
 
05:13:02.070 --> 05:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
participating in the decision making
 
05:13:03.750 --> 05:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
i would be curious as to what the
 
05:13:07.110 --> 05:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
original legislative intent was of that
 
05:13:11.350 --> 05:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
because i would venture a guess that
 
05:13:14.470 --> 05:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
there may have been some concern
 
05:13:16.868 --> 05:13:16.878 align:start position:0%
that if they
 
05:13:19.510 --> 05:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
converted a public school into a charter
 
05:13:19.520 --> 05:13:20.628 align:start position:0%
converted a public school into a charter
school

05:13:20.628 --> 05:13:20.638 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:13:23.270 --> 05:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
without buy-in from the faculty the
 
05:13:25.750 --> 05:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
superintendent and the principal
 
05:13:27.990 --> 05:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
that they might not have a faculty a
 
05:13:31.430 --> 05:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
superintendent and a principal so
 
05:13:32.470 --> 05:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
i would
 
05:13:34.470 --> 05:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
as much as
 
05:13:35.990 --> 05:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
we can
 
05:13:38.150 --> 05:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
knock around whether or not teachers are
 
05:13:39.590 --> 05:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
entitled to
 
05:13:42.470 --> 05:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
be part of the decision making or
 
05:13:44.708 --> 05:13:44.718 align:start position:0%
whether they live in the community
 
05:13:47.430 --> 05:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
i i think we do need to take into
 
05:13:49.990 --> 05:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
consideration the idea that a school
 
05:13:53.190 --> 05:13:53.200 align:start position:0%
does not run without a staff
 
05:13:55.350 --> 05:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
and that we have
 
05:13:57.510 --> 05:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
teacher shortages there's got to be some
 
05:14:00.230 --> 05:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
other way of doing this without
 
05:14:04.310 --> 05:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
eliminating everybody in the school from
 
05:14:07.990 --> 05:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
being part of the decision making
 
05:14:10.788 --> 05:14:10.798 align:start position:0%
okay um well
 
05:14:13.590 --> 05:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
i think that representative porter final
 
05:14:13.600 --> 05:14:14.708 align:start position:0%
i think that representative porter final
comment

05:14:14.708 --> 05:14:14.718 align:start position:0%
comment
 
05:14:17.590 --> 05:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps as we're if we are amending the
 
05:14:20.390 --> 05:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
bill we could make sure that the staff
 
05:14:22.550 --> 05:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
and the superintendent and the principal
 
05:14:24.550 --> 05:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
are involved in the decision-making
 
05:14:26.948 --> 05:14:26.958 align:start position:0%
process with the school board
 
05:14:28.868 --> 05:14:28.878 align:start position:0%
and then it goes to a vote
 
05:14:31.590 --> 05:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
that at least would allow the
 
05:14:33.590 --> 05:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
faculty to be involved and make a
 
05:14:35.750 --> 05:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
decision as to whether they want will be
 
05:14:39.030 --> 05:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
staying with the district or not
 
05:14:41.990 --> 05:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
okay um so i think we heard that uh we
 
05:14:45.110 --> 05:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
will recess um this bill to a future
 
05:14:48.230 --> 05:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
exact session
 
05:14:50.470 --> 05:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
will be a new amendment is going to be
 
05:14:52.150 --> 05:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
an amendment worked on to reflect all
 
05:14:53.910 --> 05:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
this anyone can
 
05:14:55.590 --> 05:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
work on an amendment it's free to work
 
05:14:58.470 --> 05:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
on an amendment if they so choose
 
05:15:00.868 --> 05:15:00.878 align:start position:0%
now one one of the things that there is
 
05:15:03.670 --> 05:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
a motion on the table yes
 
05:15:03.680 --> 05:15:04.948 align:start position:0%
a motion on the table yes
um

05:15:04.948 --> 05:15:04.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:07.670 --> 05:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
so would the uh make or the motion so it
 
05:15:09.510 --> 05:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
would be no i'm not going to take my
 
05:15:11.590 --> 05:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
motion off the table okay but there
 
05:15:13.350 --> 05:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
could be an amendment come back that
 
05:15:19.030 --> 05:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:21.430 --> 05:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
the the motion of ought to pass
 
05:15:23.830 --> 05:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
we can't just leave it hanging
 
05:15:26.390 --> 05:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
well i no you you can we we've had you
 
05:15:28.550 --> 05:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
know situations before in education
 
05:15:31.110 --> 05:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
where we've not we've had the most put
 
05:15:32.470 --> 05:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
on the table but we have not taken
 
05:15:34.150 --> 05:15:34.160 align:start position:0%

just where you've gone
 
05:15:52.230 --> 05:15:52.240 align:start position:0%
and then and put it in the file just and
 
05:15:57.110 --> 05:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:01.270 --> 05:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:03.990 --> 05:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
okay so uh i'll i'll take over from here
 
05:16:05.990 --> 05:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
because now we're going on the next bill
 
05:16:07.590 --> 05:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
and the next one we're jumping over
 
05:16:10.070 --> 05:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
agriculture in the classroom um we just
 
05:16:12.390 --> 05:16:12.400 align:start position:0%

last after yesterday afternoon
 
05:16:21.990 --> 05:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
and there were some suggestions came
 
05:16:25.350 --> 05:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
forward on on some of these one of the
 
05:16:28.070 --> 05:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
associations to eliminate that and
 
05:16:30.550 --> 05:16:30.560 align:start position:0%

uh thank you mr chairman um
 
05:17:17.750 --> 05:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
this was brought forward after
 
05:17:19.430 --> 05:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
discussions with the department of
 
05:17:19.440 --> 05:17:20.708 align:start position:0%
discussions with the department of
education

05:17:20.708 --> 05:17:20.718 align:start position:0%
education
 
05:17:20.718 --> 05:17:21.670 align:start position:0%
education
um

05:17:21.670 --> 05:17:21.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:23.270 --> 05:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
based on complaints that they had
 
05:17:25.830 --> 05:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
received in two areas
 
05:17:25.840 --> 05:17:27.510 align:start position:0%
received in two areas
one

05:17:27.510 --> 05:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:17:31.270 --> 05:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
fees being charged to students
 
05:17:31.280 --> 05:17:32.070 align:start position:0%
fees being charged to students
that

05:17:32.070 --> 05:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:17:35.430 --> 05:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:37.350 --> 05:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
could impact
 
05:17:40.628 --> 05:17:40.638 align:start position:0%
the students ability to enroll
 
05:17:42.628 --> 05:17:42.638 align:start position:0%
and secondly
 
05:17:44.550 --> 05:17:44.560 align:start position:0%
an issue with
 
05:17:47.110 --> 05:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
out of state students being accepted
 
05:17:51.750 --> 05:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
into border charter schools and
 
05:17:54.390 --> 05:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
because the charter school was able to
 
05:17:56.150 --> 05:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
charge tuition to those out of state
 
05:17:56.160 --> 05:17:57.270 align:start position:0%
charge tuition to those out of state
students

05:17:57.270 --> 05:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
students
 
05:17:59.110 --> 05:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
they were actually
 
05:18:01.430 --> 05:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
accepting charter students
 
05:18:03.430 --> 05:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
except out of state charter school
 
05:18:03.440 --> 05:18:04.628 align:start position:0%
except out of state charter school
students

05:18:04.628 --> 05:18:04.638 align:start position:0%
students
 
05:18:06.868 --> 05:18:06.878 align:start position:0%
that impacted the ability of in-state
 
05:18:09.510 --> 05:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
students to enroll because of maximum
 
05:18:09.520 --> 05:18:12.310 align:start position:0%
students to enroll because of maximum
enrollment

05:18:12.310 --> 05:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:15.430 --> 05:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
provisions in the charter of the school
 
05:18:15.440 --> 05:18:16.150 align:start position:0%
provisions in the charter of the school
so

05:18:16.150 --> 05:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:18:20.310 --> 05:18:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:22.470 --> 05:18:22.480 align:start position:0%
stating that those fees cannot be
 
05:18:25.110 --> 05:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
charged as a condition of enrollment
 
05:18:25.120 --> 05:18:26.070 align:start position:0%
charged as a condition of enrollment
and

05:18:26.070 --> 05:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:18:27.910 --> 05:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
secondly that
 
05:18:29.830 --> 05:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
in-state students have to be given
 
05:18:31.910 --> 05:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
preference and determination of
 
05:18:31.920 --> 05:18:33.110 align:start position:0%
preference and determination of
enrollment

05:18:33.110 --> 05:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
enrollment
 
05:18:34.868 --> 05:18:34.878 align:start position:0%
in the charter school
 
05:18:37.110 --> 05:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:18:39.590 --> 05:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
does the second have any further
 
05:18:39.600 --> 05:18:41.510 align:start position:0%
does the second have any further
discussion

05:18:41.510 --> 05:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
05:18:42.550 --> 05:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:18:43.910 --> 05:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
it's open to the committee any
 
05:18:45.910 --> 05:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
discussion from comedian jefferson
 
05:18:49.030 --> 05:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
woodcock just one i want to reiterate uh
 
05:18:50.310 --> 05:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
from the discussion we had initially
 
05:18:50.320 --> 05:18:51.430 align:start position:0%
from the discussion we had initially
when

05:18:51.430 --> 05:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
when
 
05:18:53.510 --> 05:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
mr green was here that
 
05:18:56.948 --> 05:18:56.958 align:start position:0%
the phrase enrollment on line four
 
05:18:59.430 --> 05:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh is
 
05:19:02.230 --> 05:19:02.240 align:start position:0%
initial enrollment and not maintaining
 
05:19:04.310 --> 05:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
enrollment if you recall my question was
 
05:19:04.320 --> 05:19:05.350 align:start position:0%
enrollment if you recall my question was
about

05:19:05.350 --> 05:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:19:07.110 --> 05:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
supplies in the school and art supplies
 
05:19:09.430 --> 05:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
and those things so once a student is
 
05:19:12.788 --> 05:19:12.798 align:start position:0%
admitted without a fee to the program he
 
05:19:14.550 --> 05:19:14.560 align:start position:0%
can't be removed from the program for
 
05:19:17.430 --> 05:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
lack of participating
 
05:19:19.750 --> 05:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
lack of fees at that point
 
05:19:21.670 --> 05:19:21.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:19:23.110 --> 05:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
good point
 
05:19:25.670 --> 05:19:25.680 align:start position:0%

05:21:03.830 --> 05:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:05.670 --> 05:21:05.680 align:start position:0%
represent boom do you care to speak to
 
05:21:06.788 --> 05:21:06.798 align:start position:0%
your motion
 
05:21:08.868 --> 05:21:08.878 align:start position:0%
it's just briefly we had a hearing on
 
05:21:09.830 --> 05:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
this and
 
05:21:12.150 --> 05:21:12.160 align:start position:0%
all this removes is the
 
05:21:14.070 --> 05:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
mileage requirement for the bill we did
 
05:21:16.948 --> 05:21:16.958 align:start position:0%
last year hasn't we learned we were
 
05:21:19.990 --> 05:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
arguing over the senate bill and that 75
 
05:21:22.948 --> 05:21:22.958 align:start position:0%
miles was a round trip or whatever
 
05:21:25.510 --> 05:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
without thinking ahead
 
05:21:27.830 --> 05:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
and afterwards we thought of wait a
 
05:21:30.390 --> 05:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
minute londonderry marching band goes
 
05:21:31.990 --> 05:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
all over the country
 
05:21:34.548 --> 05:21:34.558 align:start position:0%
and it's a trip to the airport it's not
 
05:21:37.590 --> 05:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
75 miles and when i went on a field trip
 
05:21:40.548 --> 05:21:40.558 align:start position:0%
out of the country we took a coach bus
 
05:21:43.110 --> 05:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
which is the safest thing to do and it's
 
05:21:46.868 --> 05:21:46.878 align:start position:0%
not 75 miles so tomorrow's requirement i
 
05:21:49.430 --> 05:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
don't think it's not required
 
05:21:49.440 --> 05:21:50.230 align:start position:0%
don't think it's not required
and

05:21:50.230 --> 05:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:21:52.230 --> 05:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
they still can't use it for
 
05:21:55.270 --> 05:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
any normal transportation like you know
 
05:21:58.708 --> 05:21:58.718 align:start position:0%
normal school bus trips so it's it's
 
05:22:01.270 --> 05:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
needed and we found that last year that
 
05:22:03.190 --> 05:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
the coach buses that we've been using
 
05:22:03.200 --> 05:22:04.230 align:start position:0%
the coach buses that we've been using
forever

05:22:04.230 --> 05:22:04.240 align:start position:0%
forever
 
05:22:06.230 --> 05:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
are were illegal
 
05:22:08.390 --> 05:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
now that makes last year so i made the
 
05:22:10.628 --> 05:22:10.638 align:start position:0%
bill legal but just the same as last
 
05:22:13.510 --> 05:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
year septa miles requirement was removed
 
05:22:16.150 --> 05:22:16.160 align:start position:0%

05:22:16.160 --> 05:22:17.190 align:start position:0%

05:22:34.628 --> 05:22:34.638 align:start position:0%
came i questioned the
 
05:22:36.788 --> 05:22:36.798 align:start position:0%
concern regarding the the background
 
05:22:38.230 --> 05:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
checks of coach bus drivers for
 
05:22:40.390 --> 05:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
commercial bus drivers raw students and
 
05:22:43.110 --> 05:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
the safety exiting for our students
 
05:22:44.470 --> 05:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
i don't think that has been changed from
 
05:22:46.868 --> 05:22:46.878 align:start position:0%
last year's bill it wasn't resolved
 
05:22:48.390 --> 05:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
and i will be voting knowing this bill
 
05:22:49.990 --> 05:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
rather than that
 
05:22:54.708 --> 05:22:54.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:57.590 --> 05:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
sure you can ask questions to this
 
05:22:59.670 --> 05:22:59.680 align:start position:0%
just to representative woodcock i asked
 
05:23:02.230 --> 05:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
you a question does it he let you does
 
05:23:05.270 --> 05:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
it he did i asked um
 
05:23:06.470 --> 05:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
rules follower
 
05:23:09.990 --> 05:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
does it impact your decision if that
 
05:23:11.990 --> 05:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
charter driver would not be alone
 
05:23:16.150 --> 05:23:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:17.670 --> 05:23:17.680 align:start position:0%
thank you i wouldn't change my
 
05:23:19.590 --> 05:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
discussion the the discussion last time
 
05:23:22.070 --> 05:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
was uh much broader because emergency
 
05:23:23.750 --> 05:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
access in the building in the school no
 
05:23:25.590 --> 05:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
practicing with those buses and all
 
05:23:27.190 --> 05:23:27.200 align:start position:0%
those things so i just think this opens
 
05:23:29.670 --> 05:23:29.680 align:start position:0%
the door for for more for more
 
05:23:32.070 --> 05:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
non-certified bus drivers for more uh
 
05:23:34.948 --> 05:23:34.958 align:start position:0%
non-uh school bus type uh
 
05:23:36.868 --> 05:23:36.878 align:start position:0%
projections so
 
05:23:38.390 --> 05:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
05:23:38.400 --> 05:23:43.190 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
question

05:23:43.190 --> 05:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:45.350 --> 05:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question and i
 
05:23:47.990 --> 05:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
this is a question for ref woodcock as
 
05:23:50.470 --> 05:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
well i was under the impression that we
 
05:23:52.628 --> 05:23:52.638 align:start position:0%
had legislation
 
05:23:56.310 --> 05:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
either in process in our committee
 
05:23:59.110 --> 05:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
dealing with schools and contracted
 
05:23:59.120 --> 05:24:00.150 align:start position:0%
dealing with schools and contracted
service

05:24:00.150 --> 05:24:00.160 align:start position:0%
service
 
05:24:02.788 --> 05:24:02.798 align:start position:0%
providers that would require them to go
 
05:24:04.628 --> 05:24:04.638 align:start position:0%
through a background check
 
05:24:08.230 --> 05:24:08.240 align:start position:0%
did we skip them in all of our work no i
 
05:24:09.670 --> 05:24:09.680 align:start position:0%
think a representative probably can
 
05:24:10.868 --> 05:24:10.878 align:start position:0%
clarify it closely with me yelling
 
05:24:12.390 --> 05:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
across the room because there but we
 
05:24:14.708 --> 05:24:14.718 align:start position:0%
found last year that when the safety
 
05:24:17.270 --> 05:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
police came in the state police that the
 
05:24:19.350 --> 05:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
china bus driver was not under the same
 
05:24:21.350 --> 05:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
regulatory requirements in terms of
 
05:24:22.788 --> 05:24:22.798 align:start position:0%
background checks
 
05:24:24.708 --> 05:24:24.718 align:start position:0%
that our school bus drivers are nor do
 
05:24:26.150 --> 05:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
they practice with our students on
 
05:24:28.150 --> 05:24:28.160 align:start position:0%
emergency exits in case of excellence
 
05:24:30.230 --> 05:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
you get a large bus boom it's over i
 
05:24:31.750 --> 05:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
mean every school bus the kids practice
 
05:24:33.030 --> 05:24:33.040 align:start position:0%
once or twice a year before they even
 
05:24:33.040 --> 05:24:34.470 align:start position:0%
once or twice a year before they even
start

05:24:34.470 --> 05:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
start
 
05:24:35.510 --> 05:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:24:37.430 --> 05:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
one of the issues that we we had last
 
05:24:39.750 --> 05:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
year on that was the these
 
05:24:41.270 --> 05:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
uh commercial
 
05:24:41.280 --> 05:24:42.310 align:start position:0%
uh commercial
buses

05:24:42.310 --> 05:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
buses
 
05:24:44.390 --> 05:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
uh which the drivers have gone through
 
05:24:45.750 --> 05:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
considerable training for and they have
 
05:24:47.590 --> 05:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
the cdl and all that
 
05:24:50.390 --> 05:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
um to have the certification that versus
 
05:24:52.150 --> 05:24:52.160 align:start position:0%
woodcock is talking about if you're on a
 
05:24:54.310 --> 05:24:54.320 align:start position:0%
trip to washington dc
 
05:24:56.788 --> 05:24:56.798 align:start position:0%
and your driver all sudden is really
 
05:24:58.788 --> 05:24:58.798 align:start position:0%
sick in philadelphia
 
05:25:01.510 --> 05:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
in pennsylvania it's going to be a rare
 
05:25:03.350 --> 05:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh bird that you pick up that has
 
05:25:05.190 --> 05:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
certification to drive
 
05:25:07.110 --> 05:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire certification
 
05:25:09.510 --> 05:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
they will have the the cdl and all that
 
05:25:11.510 --> 05:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
but they won't have that certification
 
05:25:14.628 --> 05:25:14.638 align:start position:0%
so then the kids are sitting there
 
05:25:18.868 --> 05:25:18.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:22.788 --> 05:25:22.798 align:start position:0%
and further i mean on these trips field
 
05:25:24.788 --> 05:25:24.798 align:start position:0%
trips or whatever there are usually a
 
05:25:27.590 --> 05:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
lot of teachers and chaperones on the
 
05:25:31.270 --> 05:25:31.280 align:start position:0%
bus also to help with any evacuation and
 
05:25:32.868 --> 05:25:32.878 align:start position:0%
they're clearly marked on the coach
 
05:25:36.390 --> 05:25:36.400 align:start position:0%
buses on on evacuations and stuff so
 
05:25:38.628 --> 05:25:38.638 align:start position:0%
and like i said this has been going on
 
05:25:38.638 --> 05:25:39.910 align:start position:0%
and like i said this has been going on
for

05:25:39.910 --> 05:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:25:42.070 --> 05:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
more than 50 years that i know of and
 
05:25:44.708 --> 05:25:44.718 align:start position:0%
people been doing it so
 
05:25:46.548 --> 05:25:46.558 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:25:48.310 --> 05:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
okay so we can discuss all the safety
 
05:25:50.470 --> 05:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
stuff either way on this so the only
 
05:25:53.030 --> 05:25:53.040 align:start position:0%

we talked a bit about this earlier today
 
05:27:48.708 --> 05:27:48.718 align:start position:0%
establishing a committee to study school
 
05:27:50.470 --> 05:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
meal programs in new hampshire's public
 
05:27:53.030 --> 05:27:53.040 align:start position:0%

any discussion from the maker of the
 
05:28:13.360 --> 05:28:14.548 align:start position:0%
any discussion from the maker of the
motion

05:28:14.548 --> 05:28:14.558 align:start position:0%
motion
 
05:28:16.788 --> 05:28:16.798 align:start position:0%
yes we've had quite a bit of discussion
 
05:28:19.430 --> 05:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
today about the school meal
 
05:28:19.440 --> 05:28:20.708 align:start position:0%
today about the school meal
programs

05:28:20.708 --> 05:28:20.718 align:start position:0%
programs
 
05:28:22.548 --> 05:28:22.558 align:start position:0%
and schools and whether or not they
 
05:28:25.270 --> 05:28:25.280 align:start position:0%
participate in addition some of the
 
05:28:26.788 --> 05:28:26.798 align:start position:0%
other things that we've talked about are
 
05:28:30.310 --> 05:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
whether or not to use local agriculture
 
05:28:35.110 --> 05:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
and if if you love farmers the way we do
 
05:28:37.030 --> 05:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
local products
 
05:28:40.310 --> 05:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
produce products that help people
 
05:28:42.628 --> 05:28:42.638 align:start position:0%
feel better
 
05:28:44.788 --> 05:28:44.798 align:start position:0%
if you grow local honey
 
05:28:45.830 --> 05:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
you can
 
05:28:49.110 --> 05:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
have better resistance to um
 
05:28:51.750 --> 05:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
allergies and things in our in our area
 
05:28:54.390 --> 05:28:54.400 align:start position:0%
so all of these things i believe should
 
05:28:56.948 --> 05:28:56.958 align:start position:0%
be studied and maybe even the other
 
05:28:58.548 --> 05:28:58.558 align:start position:0%
ideas that
 
05:29:00.548 --> 05:29:00.558 align:start position:0%
um that were brought up in the previous
 
05:29:03.510 --> 05:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
bills that we itled this morning so i
 
05:29:05.030 --> 05:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
don't know whose second did but i was
 
05:29:07.350 --> 05:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
really hoping mullen would
 
05:29:10.070 --> 05:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
hop on board
 
05:29:14.948 --> 05:29:14.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:17.510 --> 05:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
okay is there any discussion from the
 
05:29:17.520 --> 05:29:18.390 align:start position:0%
okay is there any discussion from the
second

05:29:18.390 --> 05:29:18.400 align:start position:0%
second
 
05:29:18.400 --> 05:29:19.430 align:start position:0%
second
no

05:29:19.430 --> 05:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
no
 
05:29:21.350 --> 05:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
any further discussion representative
 
05:29:24.070 --> 05:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
mullen pick me pick me
 
05:29:24.080 --> 05:29:25.350 align:start position:0%
mullen pick me pick me
um

05:29:25.350 --> 05:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:27.350 --> 05:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
so is there a
 
05:29:29.750 --> 05:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
it's more of a question for you mr chair
 
05:29:33.030 --> 05:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:36.868 --> 05:29:36.878 align:start position:0%
foresighted enough earlier in the day to
 
05:29:39.270 --> 05:29:39.280 align:start position:0%
look at this as a vehicle for additional
 
05:29:43.670 --> 05:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:47.830 --> 05:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
is this an informal enough process that
 
05:29:47.840 --> 05:29:48.708 align:start position:0%
is this an informal enough process that
the

05:29:48.708 --> 05:29:48.718 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:29:52.948 --> 05:29:52.958 align:start position:0%
sponsors of house bill 1657 would just
 
05:29:56.390 --> 05:29:56.400 align:start position:0%
reach out to representative oregon and
 
05:30:00.788 --> 05:30:00.798 align:start position:0%
sort of jump on board in a global
 
05:30:02.708 --> 05:30:02.718 align:start position:0%
interim study or
 
05:30:06.430 --> 05:30:06.440 align:start position:0%
do we need to do something else to keep
 
05:30:09.510 --> 05:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
1657 alive as well i think there's been
 
05:30:11.830 --> 05:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of discussion on meal plans
 
05:30:14.390 --> 05:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
breakfast plans the whole nine yards
 
05:30:16.390 --> 05:30:16.400 align:start position:0%
and i i think there's a wonderful
 
05:30:18.708 --> 05:30:18.718 align:start position:0%
opportunity here for us to integrate
 
05:30:21.350 --> 05:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
some of these other bills or discussions
 
05:30:23.030 --> 05:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
which we've had
 
05:30:24.868 --> 05:30:24.878 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned that the fourth item
 
05:30:26.948 --> 05:30:26.958 align:start position:0%
there gave a lot of latitude in this
 
05:30:29.110 --> 05:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
committee study
 
05:30:31.670 --> 05:30:31.680 align:start position:0%
so i i have no objection to in fact i
 
05:30:33.590 --> 05:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
think this interim study is a better a
 
05:30:34.708 --> 05:30:34.718 align:start position:0%
deal than
 
05:30:36.310 --> 05:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:30:37.830 --> 05:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
at the past then you don't really don't
 
05:30:39.670 --> 05:30:39.680 align:start position:0%
get on top of that until when it becomes
 
05:30:43.190 --> 05:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
a committee that's what july or august
 
05:30:45.030 --> 05:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
and when people get assigned and some of
 
05:30:47.430 --> 05:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
them probably won't get assigned because
 
05:30:49.510 --> 05:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
i don't think the committees are being
 
05:30:52.470 --> 05:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
looked on fondly this way we can have an
 
05:30:54.868 --> 05:30:54.878 align:start position:0%
interim study but we can also have we
 
05:30:57.350 --> 05:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
can start working ourselves as a group
 
05:31:01.270 --> 05:31:01.280 align:start position:0%
of the a study of this committee working
 
05:31:01.280 --> 05:31:02.150 align:start position:0%
of the a study of this committee working
towards

05:31:02.150 --> 05:31:02.160 align:start position:0%
towards
 
05:31:04.628 --> 05:31:04.638 align:start position:0%
the whole issue of what we've talked
 
05:31:07.270 --> 05:31:07.280 align:start position:0%
about today i i think it's important
 
05:31:09.670 --> 05:31:09.680 align:start position:0%
so rated his highest mathematics because
 
05:31:11.670 --> 05:31:11.680 align:start position:0%
i'm there but you know so what advice
 
05:31:14.070 --> 05:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
would you have me give representative
 
05:31:14.080 --> 05:31:15.350 align:start position:0%
would you have me give representative
simpson

05:31:15.350 --> 05:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
simpson
 
05:31:16.948 --> 05:31:16.958 align:start position:0%
about moving
 
05:31:20.190 --> 05:31:20.200 align:start position:0%
forward the study of house bill
 
05:31:24.628 --> 05:31:24.638 align:start position:0%
1657 in terms of this interim study
 
05:31:26.948 --> 05:31:26.958 align:start position:0%
i i think that the topic which we had
 
05:31:29.510 --> 05:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
there 1657
 
05:31:29.520 --> 05:31:31.110 align:start position:0%
there 1657
was

05:31:31.110 --> 05:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:31:33.110 --> 05:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
an itl motion
 
05:31:35.350 --> 05:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
but i mentioned when we were discussing
 
05:31:36.708 --> 05:31:36.718 align:start position:0%
it that i felt that it could be
 
05:31:39.590 --> 05:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
discussed within this area right here i
 
05:31:41.910 --> 05:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
still hold to that okay
 
05:31:45.670 --> 05:31:45.680 align:start position:0%
all right yeah fair enough thank you
 
05:31:47.590 --> 05:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
yes represent tanner
 
05:31:49.590 --> 05:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm trying to wrap my head
 
05:31:49.600 --> 05:31:50.708 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm trying to wrap my head
around

05:31:50.708 --> 05:31:50.718 align:start position:0%
around
 
05:31:53.430 --> 05:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
how you do an interim study
 
05:31:56.230 --> 05:31:56.240 align:start position:0%
of a bill for a study committee
 
05:31:58.628 --> 05:31:58.638 align:start position:0%
that to me it it's like
 
05:32:00.788 --> 05:32:00.798 align:start position:0%
it just i know it just doesn't sound
 
05:32:02.230 --> 05:32:02.240 align:start position:0%
like it's it's
 
05:32:04.708 --> 05:32:04.718 align:start position:0%
it's actually when that's uh
 
05:32:07.110 --> 05:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
interim study is one where of course it
 
05:32:08.548 --> 05:32:08.558 align:start position:0%
goes on the
 
05:32:08.558 --> 05:32:09.750 align:start position:0%
goes on the
calendar

05:32:09.750 --> 05:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
05:32:11.510 --> 05:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
and then it's you know
 
05:32:14.150 --> 05:32:14.160 align:start position:0%
i i know i know the what okay
 
05:32:16.310 --> 05:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
some study is but it just seems
 
05:32:18.708 --> 05:32:18.718 align:start position:0%
weird to me that you have an interim
 
05:32:18.718 --> 05:32:20.150 align:start position:0%
weird to me that you have an interim
study

05:32:20.150 --> 05:32:20.160 align:start position:0%
study
 
05:32:22.788 --> 05:32:22.798 align:start position:0%
to study a study committee
 
05:32:25.030 --> 05:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
um rather than just have a study
 
05:32:25.040 --> 05:32:27.190 align:start position:0%
um rather than just have a study
committee

05:32:27.190 --> 05:32:27.200 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:32:28.230 --> 05:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
that then
 
05:32:30.230 --> 05:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
picks up these other things and and i
 
05:32:32.788 --> 05:32:32.798 align:start position:0%
would also back up that you know i i'm
 
05:32:35.350 --> 05:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
very adamant about the local
 
05:32:37.030 --> 05:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
family farms and
 
05:32:39.750 --> 05:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
the whole intent of the bill to include
 
05:32:39.760 --> 05:32:40.548 align:start position:0%
the whole intent of the bill to include
them

05:32:40.548 --> 05:32:40.558 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:32:41.830 --> 05:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
in the uh
 
05:32:44.150 --> 05:32:44.160 align:start position:0%
you know in the lunch program and in the
 
05:32:47.110 --> 05:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
schools and i just feel like
 
05:32:48.708 --> 05:32:48.718 align:start position:0%
if you're studying whether to have a
 
05:32:51.830 --> 05:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
study committee or not
 
05:32:53.990 --> 05:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that that gives you
 
05:32:56.310 --> 05:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to study
 
05:32:58.070 --> 05:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
all the things that are really needed in
 
05:33:00.390 --> 05:33:00.400 align:start position:0%
that one bill the implementation the
 
05:33:01.830 --> 05:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
different organizations you want to
 
05:33:01.840 --> 05:33:03.110 align:start position:0%
different organizations you want to
involve

05:33:03.110 --> 05:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
involve
 
05:33:05.030 --> 05:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
all that kind of thing so i know
 
05:33:07.750 --> 05:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
representative hobson's just dying to
 
05:33:12.628 --> 05:33:12.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:14.628 --> 05:33:14.638 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
05:33:16.868 --> 05:33:16.878 align:start position:0%
um no i'm i'm not dying to tell you how
 
05:33:18.708 --> 05:33:18.718 align:start position:0%
it works but i guess
 
05:33:19.990 --> 05:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
when i had
 
05:33:21.910 --> 05:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
when i was thinking about this bill
 
05:33:24.070 --> 05:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
there are so many different things about
 
05:33:27.430 --> 05:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
the lunch program and about
 
05:33:28.910 --> 05:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
what makes
 
05:33:32.868 --> 05:33:32.878 align:start position:0%
430 public schools able to implement
 
05:33:36.310 --> 05:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
this why are 30 not
 
05:33:37.990 --> 05:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
is it a money issue
 
05:33:40.708 --> 05:33:40.718 align:start position:0%
how much how many meals are kids eating
 
05:33:42.628 --> 05:33:42.638 align:start position:0%
and what kind of food are they eating
 
05:33:45.670 --> 05:33:45.680 align:start position:0%
and could we solve supply chain issues
 
05:33:47.670 --> 05:33:47.680 align:start position:0%
for our schools i mean there was cream
 
05:33:50.070 --> 05:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
cheese and coffee cup lids a few weeks
 
05:33:52.390 --> 05:33:52.400 align:start position:0%
ago that we couldn't find
 
05:33:54.830 --> 05:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
are those products that that we could
 
05:33:58.310 --> 05:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
replicate um year-round in new hampshire
 
05:34:01.590 --> 05:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
um and and it helps our economy um you
 
05:34:03.030 --> 05:34:03.040 align:start position:0%
know rather than so i mean i think
 
05:34:05.190 --> 05:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
there's just different facets
 
05:34:06.548 --> 05:34:06.558 align:start position:0%
of all of these things that we could
 
05:34:08.868 --> 05:34:08.878 align:start position:0%
look at and and that belongs you know
 
05:34:10.548 --> 05:34:10.558 align:start position:0%
what do we study
 
05:34:12.070 --> 05:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
committee you know
 
05:34:12.080 --> 05:34:15.510 align:start position:0%
committee you know
so

05:34:15.510 --> 05:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:17.510 --> 05:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
so why don't we just pass a study
 
05:34:17.520 --> 05:34:18.708 align:start position:0%
so why don't we just pass a study
committee

05:34:18.708 --> 05:34:18.718 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:34:22.070 --> 05:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
rather than pass an interim study of a
 
05:34:23.270 --> 05:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
05:34:34.708 --> 05:34:34.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:37.510 --> 05:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
so we the option we have right now
 
05:34:40.868 --> 05:34:40.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:44.150 --> 05:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:49.430 --> 05:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:51.830 --> 05:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
yeah but see if you pass that you're not
 
05:34:53.430 --> 05:34:53.440 align:start position:0%
going to have a study
 
05:34:55.030 --> 05:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
because it's going to go through you're
 
05:34:56.788 --> 05:34:56.798 align:start position:0%
not going to there won't be when are you
 
05:35:00.868 --> 05:35:00.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:03.350 --> 05:35:03.360 align:start position:0%
law and and when the people are assigned
 
05:35:05.670 --> 05:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
to it probably
 
05:35:07.830 --> 05:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
in august
 
05:35:10.628 --> 05:35:10.638 align:start position:0%
if if then
 
05:35:12.548 --> 05:35:12.558 align:start position:0%
represent cardelli thank you uh
 
05:35:14.070 --> 05:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
representative mullen probably will
 
05:35:15.510 --> 05:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
remember the
 
05:35:18.548 --> 05:35:18.558 align:start position:0%
hp 581 special ed sub
 
05:35:21.510 --> 05:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
study committee that we had last fall
 
05:35:21.520 --> 05:35:22.310 align:start position:0%
study committee that we had last fall
um

05:35:22.310 --> 05:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:35:25.750 --> 05:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
we didn't get everybody assigned until
 
05:35:29.750 --> 05:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
um i believe it was the end of september
 
05:35:31.830 --> 05:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
um and the report had to be out november
 
05:35:34.708 --> 05:35:34.718 align:start position:0%
1st so we were left with having like
 
05:35:36.628 --> 05:35:36.638 align:start position:0%
three or four meetings
 
05:35:39.030 --> 05:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
um when it could have gone much much
 
05:35:41.750 --> 05:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
longer and that wasn't even an election
 
05:35:41.760 --> 05:35:42.788 align:start position:0%
longer and that wasn't even an election
year

05:35:42.788 --> 05:35:42.798 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:35:45.670 --> 05:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
so i think this year between
 
05:35:47.590 --> 05:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
as chairman lad said the assignment of
 
05:35:47.600 --> 05:35:48.948 align:start position:0%
as chairman lad said the assignment of
people

05:35:48.948 --> 05:35:48.958 align:start position:0%
people
 
05:35:51.270 --> 05:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
the willingness of
 
05:35:53.190 --> 05:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
the senate and everybody else to pass
 
05:35:55.110 --> 05:35:55.120 align:start position:0%
this through and even get it signed into
 
05:35:55.120 --> 05:35:55.990 align:start position:0%
this through and even get it signed into
law

05:35:55.990 --> 05:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
law
 
05:35:57.910 --> 05:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
and being an election year
 
05:36:00.788 --> 05:36:00.798 align:start position:0%
i see very little chance of
 
05:36:02.788 --> 05:36:02.798 align:start position:0%
a study committee actually been able to
 
05:36:05.030 --> 05:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
do much of a study
 
05:36:07.190 --> 05:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
that was the case when we had the cte
 
05:36:09.430 --> 05:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
committee initially we didn't have a
 
05:36:11.750 --> 05:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
senator on it they just didn't assign we
 
05:36:13.830 --> 05:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
went ahead and started the job we did
 
05:36:16.310 --> 05:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
the same thing in the infrastructure uh
 
05:36:18.390 --> 05:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
committee when we initially started that
 
05:36:20.150 --> 05:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
we didn't have people assigned but we
 
05:36:22.390 --> 05:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
got enough people to have a majority
 
05:36:24.390 --> 05:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
and we went ahead with it we got people
 
05:36:25.990 --> 05:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
from homeland security it was a
 
05:36:27.990 --> 05:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
commission and the other departments
 
05:36:30.788 --> 05:36:30.798 align:start position:0%
3doe and we had our reps we went ahead
 
05:36:33.990 --> 05:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:35.670 --> 05:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
the senate's not known for getting
 
05:36:44.070 --> 05:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:46.548 --> 05:36:46.558 align:start position:0%
going to kill it if if the bill any kind
 
05:36:47.750 --> 05:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
of committee
 
05:36:49.990 --> 05:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
i i'll i'll bet my paycheck here 100
 
05:36:52.390 --> 05:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
bucks a year 200 i'll bet at all
 
05:36:53.750 --> 05:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
i bet you we don't get a committee
 
05:36:54.788 --> 05:36:54.798 align:start position:0%
through the
 
05:37:00.230 --> 05:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:01.830 --> 05:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
represent mullen
 
05:37:01.840 --> 05:37:04.310 align:start position:0%
represent mullen
so

05:37:04.310 --> 05:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:37:05.990 --> 05:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
just trying to wrap my head around how
 
05:37:09.750 --> 05:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
this works so if we were in fact to
 
05:37:11.510 --> 05:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
05:37:13.670 --> 05:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
the study committee
 
05:37:16.868 --> 05:37:16.878 align:start position:0%
because it was in interim study
 
05:37:19.990 --> 05:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
we could still study
 
05:37:21.510 --> 05:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
i have set up when i've been chair
 
05:37:23.910 --> 05:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
before in previous years you know prior
 
05:37:26.708 --> 05:37:26.718 align:start position:0%
to right after mary gile
 
05:37:29.590 --> 05:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
we saw areas that we needed to look at
 
05:37:31.430 --> 05:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
we just did it
 
05:37:33.430 --> 05:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
we put together a working group and we
 
05:37:37.830 --> 05:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
did music to my ears mr chairman and so
 
05:37:40.628 --> 05:37:40.638 align:start position:0%
we just did it that's right a little bit
 
05:37:43.670 --> 05:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
of that nike stuff just do it yeah okay
 
05:37:44.788 --> 05:37:44.798 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:37:46.708 --> 05:37:46.718 align:start position:0%
but if it's not an official
 
05:37:49.350 --> 05:37:49.360 align:start position:0%
excuse me so what has to be official no
 
05:37:51.190 --> 05:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
no let me finish
 
05:37:52.868 --> 05:37:52.878 align:start position:0%
my statement please
 
05:37:54.788 --> 05:37:54.798 align:start position:0%
if it's not an official
 
05:37:56.230 --> 05:37:56.240 align:start position:0%
committee set up by a piece of
 
05:37:56.240 --> 05:37:57.590 align:start position:0%
committee set up by a piece of
legislation

05:37:57.590 --> 05:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
05:37:59.830 --> 05:37:59.840 align:start position:0%
whatever recommendations it makes
 
05:38:03.030 --> 05:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily don't necessarily have to be
 
05:38:05.110 --> 05:38:05.120 align:start position:0%
looked at by the house
 
05:38:07.430 --> 05:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
and and acted on by the house it does
 
05:38:09.750 --> 05:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
official committee right okay so if you
 
05:38:11.270 --> 05:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
do an ad hoc committee you can do all
 
05:38:13.350 --> 05:38:13.360 align:start position:0%
sorts that's exactly right and then a
 
05:38:15.030 --> 05:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
representative or two get together out
 
05:38:16.470 --> 05:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
of that group and they put legislation
 
05:38:19.190 --> 05:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
forward and then we got it thank you
 
05:38:21.030 --> 05:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
there's ways around the bar in a lot of
 
05:38:23.030 --> 05:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
what different ways so
 
05:38:25.190 --> 05:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
i see no problem with having a study
 
05:38:27.430 --> 05:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
going on and we can do that right off if
 
05:38:29.430 --> 05:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
we can get enough participation amongst
 
05:38:29.440 --> 05:38:34.150 align:start position:0%
we can get enough participation amongst
ourselves

05:38:34.150 --> 05:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:39.510 --> 05:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:41.350 --> 05:38:41.360 align:start position:0%
this should
 
05:38:42.310 --> 05:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
the things that have been going through
 
05:38:43.670 --> 05:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
my head basically have been said by
 
05:38:47.030 --> 05:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
other members and and it's just
 
05:38:49.110 --> 05:38:49.120 align:start position:0%
i'm going to vote for this but it's just
 
05:38:51.190 --> 05:38:51.200 align:start position:0%
weird to me to study the study i write
 
05:38:53.510 --> 05:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
with representative tanner it's true i
 
05:38:55.510 --> 05:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
agree with that but you know and what i
 
05:38:56.548 --> 05:38:56.558 align:start position:0%
was going to suggest is what
 
05:38:58.150 --> 05:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
representative porter just suggested is
 
05:38:59.670 --> 05:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
when i was chair i and we had these
 
05:39:01.750 --> 05:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
things i just set up ad hoc committees
 
05:39:03.350 --> 05:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
and you're right the the legislature
 
05:39:05.030 --> 05:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
didn't have to act on it but they did
 
05:39:07.030 --> 05:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
because it was needed it was an ad hoc
 
05:39:08.868 --> 05:39:08.878 align:start position:0%
committee we had the committee we had
 
05:39:08.878 --> 05:39:09.750 align:start position:0%
committee we had the committee we had
our

05:39:09.750 --> 05:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
our
 
05:39:11.510 --> 05:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
standing committee on board and things
 
05:39:12.708 --> 05:39:12.718 align:start position:0%
move forward
 
05:39:14.628 --> 05:39:14.638 align:start position:0%
i i in the end i'm okay with this it's
 
05:39:16.150 --> 05:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
just a little weird way to do it just
 
05:39:17.590 --> 05:39:17.600 align:start position:0%
sounds like but you know this is weird
 
05:39:19.270 --> 05:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
times too it's the first year i've had
 
05:39:20.628 --> 05:39:20.638 align:start position:0%
you know the second year we've had to
 
05:39:22.470 --> 05:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
wear these masks there's a lot things
 
05:39:25.350 --> 05:39:25.360 align:start position:0%
going on 100 and some odd bills we got
 
05:39:28.230 --> 05:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
you know this is not normal
 
05:39:30.628 --> 05:39:30.638 align:start position:0%
and so i know let's get the ad hoc stuff
 
05:39:33.190 --> 05:39:33.200 align:start position:0%
going i did have the same laugh as both
 
05:39:35.430 --> 05:39:35.440 align:start position:0%
of you when when we talked about it i
 
05:39:37.510 --> 05:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
said right we're going to have a study
 
05:39:40.070 --> 05:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
committee to study a committee it does
 
05:39:43.990 --> 05:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
sound strange but yes it makes sense
 
05:39:45.830 --> 05:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
mr chair are you assuming that we're
 
05:39:48.708 --> 05:39:48.718 align:start position:0%
normal anytime
 
05:39:52.070 --> 05:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
you don't want to hear my answer on that
 
05:39:53.510 --> 05:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
represent boom let's get on with the
 
05:39:55.590 --> 05:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
world here yeah just real quick i
 
05:39:58.150 --> 05:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
remember some years ago we failed we
 
05:39:59.830 --> 05:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
said no to a study committee on the
 
05:40:02.628 --> 05:40:02.638 align:start position:0%
house floor yet the following year some
 
05:40:05.350 --> 05:40:05.360 align:start position:0%
people came in with a bill based on they
 
05:40:08.708 --> 05:40:08.718 align:start position:0%
had their own study committee so i mean
 
05:40:11.030 --> 05:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
whether we not i have people can still
 
05:40:14.708 --> 05:40:14.718 align:start position:0%
study and come up with bills
 
05:40:14.718 --> 05:40:17.270 align:start position:0%
study and come up with bills
yes

05:40:17.270 --> 05:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:18.868 --> 05:40:18.878 align:start position:0%
we have done a lot of influencing
 
05:40:20.788 --> 05:40:20.798 align:start position:0%
there's another bill that representative
 
05:40:23.350 --> 05:40:23.360 align:start position:0%
talked about where we've opted to we're
 
05:40:25.350 --> 05:40:25.360 align:start position:0%
going to send a letter directly to the
 
05:40:27.190 --> 05:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner of education
 
05:40:28.948 --> 05:40:28.958 align:start position:0%
and ask for some work to be done over
 
05:40:30.470 --> 05:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
there they can do task force and all
 
05:40:32.070 --> 05:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
that there's a lot of ways getting
 
05:40:33.190 --> 05:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
things done
 
05:40:35.750 --> 05:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
and we can if if we can get uh committee
 
05:40:37.750 --> 05:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
support if you can get an agreement from
 
05:40:40.310 --> 05:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
your committee here the policy committee
 
05:40:42.868 --> 05:40:42.878 align:start position:0%
to endorse a letter it's it's
 
05:40:44.310 --> 05:40:44.320 align:start position:0%
that's the way to do it
 
05:40:46.708 --> 05:40:46.718 align:start position:0%
and we've done that before too
 
05:40:48.310 --> 05:40:48.320 align:start position:0%
and and it's always come out with a
 
05:40:50.310 --> 05:40:50.320 align:start position:0%
positive result
 
05:40:54.628 --> 05:40:54.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:57.270 --> 05:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
represent we'll put you in charge no
 
05:40:58.628 --> 05:40:58.638 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:41:00.708 --> 05:41:00.718 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i'll be in charge of
 
05:41:04.390 --> 05:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
the education committee aspect uh but uh
 
05:41:06.868 --> 05:41:06.878 align:start position:0%
i'm quite sure that representative
 
05:41:09.430 --> 05:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
simpson and murray and uh there's a
 
05:41:11.430 --> 05:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of them that are on this
 
05:41:11.440 --> 05:41:12.230 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of them that are on this
bill

05:41:12.230 --> 05:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:41:13.590 --> 05:41:13.600 align:start position:0%
that have
 
05:41:16.230 --> 05:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
really done a fine job
 
05:41:18.788 --> 05:41:18.798 align:start position:0%
connecting with the various stakeholders
 
05:41:20.948 --> 05:41:20.958 align:start position:0%
in the whole process so i would not want
 
05:41:23.750 --> 05:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
to do anything without
 
05:41:25.830 --> 05:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
the they can they
 
05:41:27.750 --> 05:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
we need to make sure that the working
 
05:41:30.150 --> 05:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
group we have here is a working group of
 
05:41:32.948 --> 05:41:32.958 align:start position:0%
people from this committee yeah we can
 
05:41:36.470 --> 05:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
involve and take input from others
 
05:41:38.150 --> 05:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
but we got to be careful in that regard
 
05:41:39.830 --> 05:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
oh yeah and so well and that's what i
 
05:41:43.430 --> 05:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
meant when i said i'm happy to uh be the
 
05:41:46.070 --> 05:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
you know the point guard of the house
 
05:41:48.310 --> 05:41:48.320 align:start position:0%
education aspect of this
 
05:41:50.310 --> 05:41:50.320 align:start position:0%
but uh they really have a tremendous
 
05:41:52.070 --> 05:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
amount of knowledge that i think would
 
05:41:53.990 --> 05:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
be beneficial to
 
05:41:55.750 --> 05:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
to the word you can be point guard i
 
05:41:57.270 --> 05:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
hope you watched the best basketball
 
05:41:59.190 --> 05:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
game ever last night oh i didn't
 
05:42:01.990 --> 05:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
arkansas beat number one
 
05:42:05.830 --> 05:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:07.830 --> 05:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
and it went in overtime
 
05:42:10.948 --> 05:42:10.958 align:start position:0%
college basketball is where it's at
 
05:42:10.958 --> 05:42:12.548 align:start position:0%
college basketball is where it's at
yeah

05:42:12.548 --> 05:42:12.558 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:42:18.070 --> 05:42:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:21.510 --> 05:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:21.520 --> 05:42:25.270 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:42:25.270 --> 05:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:26.470 --> 05:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
she's the point guard you're the
 
05:42:26.480 --> 05:42:27.910 align:start position:0%
she's the point guard you're the
quarterback

05:42:27.910 --> 05:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
quarterback
 
05:42:29.990 --> 05:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
that's right i feel like i'm
 
05:42:32.390 --> 05:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
on the end somewhere right now
 
05:42:36.868 --> 05:42:36.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:36.878 --> 05:42:37.590 align:start position:0%
 
uh

05:42:37.590 --> 05:42:37.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:42:39.910 --> 05:42:39.920 align:start position:0%

yes i need to be 1276. uh i'd like to

move uh itl india tango lima
 
05:44:07.520 --> 05:44:09.030 align:start position:0%
move uh itl india tango lima
okay

05:44:09.030 --> 05:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:44:10.390 --> 05:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
represent hobson do you wanna make a
 
05:44:12.708 --> 05:44:12.718 align:start position:0%
second on that a second
 
05:44:14.948 --> 05:44:14.958 align:start position:0%
do you like to speak on your motion talk
 
05:44:14.958 --> 05:44:15.910 align:start position:0%
do you like to speak on your motion talk
uh

05:44:15.910 --> 05:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:44:19.190 --> 05:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
briefly sure mr chairman uh this has to
 
05:44:21.830 --> 05:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
do with the formulas cost per pupil and
 
05:44:24.470 --> 05:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
the problem that some of us have is that
 
05:44:24.480 --> 05:44:25.510 align:start position:0%
the problem that some of us have is that
the

05:44:25.510 --> 05:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:44:27.830 --> 05:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
revenues come to districts from various
 
05:44:30.948 --> 05:44:30.958 align:start position:0%
sources property taxes to be sure but
 
05:44:33.430 --> 05:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
also grants uh maybe even bonds in some
 
05:44:33.440 --> 05:44:34.310 align:start position:0%
also grants uh maybe even bonds in some
cases

05:44:34.310 --> 05:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
cases
 
05:44:34.320 --> 05:44:35.590 align:start position:0%
cases
short-term

05:44:35.590 --> 05:44:35.600 align:start position:0%
short-term
 
05:44:37.830 --> 05:44:37.840 align:start position:0%
one-time covert relief funds are in the
 
05:44:39.190 --> 05:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
mix suddenly
 
05:44:43.830 --> 05:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
so the cost per pupil uh ratio or or
 
05:44:46.150 --> 05:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
formula could be deceptive
 
05:44:48.070 --> 05:44:48.080 align:start position:0%
um and also the
 
05:44:50.548 --> 05:44:50.558 align:start position:0%
the cost per student for for example i
 
05:44:51.830 --> 05:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
think i mentioned this during the
 
05:44:51.840 --> 05:44:53.030 align:start position:0%
think i mentioned this during the
hearing

05:44:53.030 --> 05:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
05:44:56.470 --> 05:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:58.948 --> 05:44:58.958 align:start position:0%
for the cost per student for a building
 
05:45:01.110 --> 05:45:01.120 align:start position:0%
roof roof improvement for example
 
05:45:03.590 --> 05:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
benefits everybody whereas
 
05:45:05.830 --> 05:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
the cost per pupil on a warrant article
 
05:45:07.990 --> 05:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
if they break it down for new band
 
05:45:10.628 --> 05:45:10.638 align:start position:0%
uniforms benefits just like a subset of
 
05:45:12.708 --> 05:45:12.718 align:start position:0%
students so for those and other reasons
 
05:45:12.718 --> 05:45:13.430 align:start position:0%
students so for those and other reasons
i

05:45:13.430 --> 05:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:45:15.350 --> 05:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
involving what i think what some of us
 
05:45:16.230 --> 05:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
think of
 
05:45:19.110 --> 05:45:19.120 align:start position:0%
flawed formulas for cost per pupil uh
 
05:45:21.190 --> 05:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
we're looking for itl
 
05:45:22.788 --> 05:45:22.798 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:45:22.798 --> 05:45:26.070 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

05:45:26.070 --> 05:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:28.628 --> 05:45:28.638 align:start position:0%
did you make the section i meant no
 
05:45:30.390 --> 05:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
let's let the second have an okay first
 
05:45:33.190 --> 05:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
if she cares yeah i do care
 
05:45:35.030 --> 05:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
but i don't have any further comments so
 
05:45:38.310 --> 05:45:38.320 align:start position:0%
i will pass it over to alicia
 
05:45:40.548 --> 05:45:40.558 align:start position:0%
okay i i messed up
 
05:45:43.270 --> 05:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
i just realized i have an amendment that
 
05:45:46.628 --> 05:45:46.638 align:start position:0%
was given to me to
 
05:45:49.270 --> 05:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
introduce on this what we didn't even
 
05:45:51.590 --> 05:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
talk about and what it does is it clears
 
05:45:53.830 --> 05:45:53.840 align:start position:0%
up all that
 
05:45:55.750 --> 05:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
it what it is and everything and it
 
05:45:58.708 --> 05:45:58.718 align:start position:0%
basically says it's on the operating
 
05:46:00.470 --> 05:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
budget warrant
 
05:46:03.110 --> 05:46:03.120 align:start position:0%
so for each warrant item
 
05:46:05.670 --> 05:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
it would give the cost per pupil for
 
05:46:07.510 --> 05:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
that warrant item
 
05:46:10.230 --> 05:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
and so it does change completely all of
 
05:46:12.150 --> 05:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
those things and i'm sorry i totally
 
05:46:15.510 --> 05:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
forgot when we were talking about this
 
05:46:18.310 --> 05:46:18.320 align:start position:0%
so i don't know what you want to do
 
05:46:18.320 --> 05:46:19.670 align:start position:0%
so i don't know what you want to do
because

05:46:19.670 --> 05:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:46:22.070 --> 05:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
we have a motion on the table yeah do we
 
05:46:24.230 --> 05:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
want to take it back and
 
05:46:27.110 --> 05:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
change it and do the amendment
 
05:46:29.270 --> 05:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
which was put in by rep thomas rep
 
05:46:33.510 --> 05:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
harley rep moffett and myself
 
05:46:35.910 --> 05:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
to try to clear up that whole issue
 
05:46:38.708 --> 05:46:38.718 align:start position:0%
i i don't know if everybody's had the
 
05:46:41.510 --> 05:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to see it exactly you know i
 
05:46:43.190 --> 05:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
think everybody else was of the opinion
 
05:46:45.350 --> 05:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
that we would ipl that because his
 
05:46:47.910 --> 05:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
district verse her district there may be
 
05:46:49.590 --> 05:46:49.600 align:start position:0%
using all kinds of different elements
 
05:46:50.948 --> 05:46:50.958 align:start position:0%
and coming up with some kind of a
 
05:46:52.470 --> 05:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
per-pupil cost
 
05:46:54.150 --> 05:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
and of course they say it's unto that
 
05:46:56.070 --> 05:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
district alone but they're going to look
 
05:46:57.670 --> 05:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
and see over in his district the kids
 
05:46:59.670 --> 05:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
getting a better education for less
 
05:47:01.990 --> 05:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
money well that may be so or may not be
 
05:47:04.150 --> 05:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
so well that was the point of changing
 
05:47:06.390 --> 05:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
it just to the warrant articles
 
05:47:08.548 --> 05:47:08.558 align:start position:0%
and so each warrant article
 
05:47:10.628 --> 05:47:10.638 align:start position:0%
would have what that warrant articles
 
05:47:12.548 --> 05:47:12.558 align:start position:0%
cost per pupil was
 
05:47:14.548 --> 05:47:14.558 align:start position:0%
and so if you bundled it all together or
 
05:47:17.270 --> 05:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
you separated it out it wouldn't matter
 
05:47:18.548 --> 05:47:18.558 align:start position:0%
because you could look at what the
 
05:47:20.230 --> 05:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
pieces were
 
05:47:20.240 --> 05:47:21.510 align:start position:0%
pieces were
and

05:47:21.510 --> 05:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:47:23.350 --> 05:47:23.360 align:start position:0%
you know and they wouldn't be comparable
 
05:47:25.750 --> 05:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
town to town because it depend upon what
 
05:47:27.350 --> 05:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
things were on what
 
05:47:29.670 --> 05:47:29.680 align:start position:0%
well we're just discussing this concept
 
05:47:32.390 --> 05:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
without any amendment on the floor
 
05:47:34.628 --> 05:47:34.638 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of elements within a
 
05:47:37.270 --> 05:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
budget in a small town let's say of 80
 
05:47:39.030 --> 05:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
kids district
 
05:47:41.670 --> 05:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
you can have two catastrophic aid kids
 
05:47:45.430 --> 05:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
in there 250 000 a piece
 
05:47:47.350 --> 05:47:47.360 align:start position:0%
and that's going to certainly shoot that
 
05:47:49.190 --> 05:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
budget up but you can't do a darn thing
 
05:47:51.750 --> 05:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
about it because you're required by law
 
05:47:53.270 --> 05:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
to do it
 
05:47:53.280 --> 05:47:54.310 align:start position:0%
to do it
uh

05:47:54.310 --> 05:47:54.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:47:54.320 --> 05:47:55.590 align:start position:0%
uh
so

05:47:55.590 --> 05:47:55.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:47:57.510 --> 05:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
i i i have some real issues with the
 
05:47:59.750 --> 05:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
whole thing of this per pupil cost per
 
05:48:02.470 --> 05:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
warrant article or any any associated
 
05:48:04.390 --> 05:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
cost so at this point in time i'm not
 
05:48:05.670 --> 05:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
going to allow the amendment to come
 
05:48:05.680 --> 05:48:07.030 align:start position:0%
going to allow the amendment to come
forward

05:48:07.030 --> 05:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
forward
 
05:48:09.030 --> 05:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to go ahead with a vote okay
 
05:48:13.510 --> 05:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:13.520 --> 05:48:14.548 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:48:14.548 --> 05:48:14.558 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:48:16.310 --> 05:48:16.320 align:start position:0%

okay any problems with uh consent
 
05:49:25.750 --> 05:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:28.628 --> 05:49:28.638 align:start position:0%
okay the next bill which we had here is
 
05:49:31.750 --> 05:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
13 55
 
05:49:35.030 --> 05:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
suspected cases of fraud
 
05:49:37.270 --> 05:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
and education freedom accounts
 
05:49:40.070 --> 05:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
i think this is one where we kind of
 
05:49:51.310 --> 05:49:51.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:18.708 --> 05:50:18.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:18.718 --> 05:50:23.110 align:start position:0%
 
mike

05:50:23.110 --> 05:50:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:31.910 --> 05:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:34.470 --> 05:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
so rick for discussion purposes why
 
05:50:36.948 --> 05:50:36.958 align:start position:0%
don't you explain what we got here sure
 
05:50:39.030 --> 05:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
sure before any motion is before any
 
05:50:40.948 --> 05:50:40.958 align:start position:0%
emotions being made i'd be happy to
 
05:50:43.030 --> 05:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the opportunity
 
05:50:46.548 --> 05:50:46.558 align:start position:0%
mr chair so 1355
 
05:50:48.788 --> 05:50:48.798 align:start position:0%
was relative to
 
05:50:51.190 --> 05:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization
 
05:50:53.990 --> 05:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
to refer any suspected cases of misuse
 
05:50:55.830 --> 05:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
of funds
 
05:50:58.390 --> 05:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
in the efa program to the attorney
 
05:51:00.470 --> 05:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
general office and the
 
05:51:02.628 --> 05:51:02.638 align:start position:0%
the way the current law
 
05:51:04.310 --> 05:51:04.320 align:start position:0%
is crafted
 
05:51:07.110 --> 05:51:07.120 align:start position:0%
and it's on line three of the
 
05:51:09.110 --> 05:51:09.120 align:start position:0%
of the bill is introduced
 
05:51:10.868 --> 05:51:10.878 align:start position:0%
it uses the word
 
05:51:13.270 --> 05:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
may so the scholarship organization may
 
05:51:15.430 --> 05:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
refer suspected cases
 
05:51:18.310 --> 05:51:18.320 align:start position:0%
of in of intentional and substantial
 
05:51:20.390 --> 05:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
misuse of efa funds to the attorney
 
05:51:23.430 --> 05:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
general for investigation and if
 
05:51:24.868 --> 05:51:24.878 align:start position:0%
evidence of
 
05:51:27.990 --> 05:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
fraudulent use of efa fronts is obtained
 
05:51:31.190 --> 05:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
so um so a couple of things have sort of
 
05:51:33.270 --> 05:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
come to my attention that
 
05:51:36.548 --> 05:51:36.558 align:start position:0%
that in earlier versions of the efa bill
 
05:51:37.590 --> 05:51:37.600 align:start position:0%
the word
 
05:51:39.270 --> 05:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
um the word
 
05:51:41.910 --> 05:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
the initial word was was shall so the
 
05:51:44.230 --> 05:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization shall refer
 
05:51:47.430 --> 05:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
suspected cases rather than may because
 
05:51:49.430 --> 05:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
you know to be honest the scholarship
 
05:51:52.310 --> 05:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
organization is in the only position
 
05:51:54.548 --> 05:51:54.558 align:start position:0%
to even um to even know because they're
 
05:51:57.590 --> 05:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
the ones reviewing the um the requests
 
05:52:00.150 --> 05:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
for um for uh for
 
05:52:02.230 --> 05:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
uh distribution of payment
 
05:52:04.628 --> 05:52:04.638 align:start position:0%
from the uh the efas
 
05:52:04.638 --> 05:52:05.510 align:start position:0%
from the uh the efas
so

05:52:05.510 --> 05:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:52:06.708 --> 05:52:06.718 align:start position:0%
the um
 
05:52:09.510 --> 05:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
so the amendment um uh the amendment
 
05:52:09.520 --> 05:52:10.628 align:start position:0%
so the amendment um uh the amendment
softens

05:52:10.628 --> 05:52:10.638 align:start position:0%
softens
 
05:52:12.708 --> 05:52:12.718 align:start position:0%
a little bit what uh takes a lighter
 
05:52:15.030 --> 05:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
touch on 1355.
 
05:52:17.670 --> 05:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
it um it does replace the word may with
 
05:52:17.680 --> 05:52:18.548 align:start position:0%
it um it does replace the word may with
shall

05:52:18.548 --> 05:52:18.558 align:start position:0%
shall
 
05:52:19.670 --> 05:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
as was
 
05:52:22.150 --> 05:52:22.160 align:start position:0%
in the in some earlier versions of the
 
05:52:22.160 --> 05:52:23.350 align:start position:0%
in the in some earlier versions of the
efa

05:52:23.350 --> 05:52:23.360 align:start position:0%
efa
 
05:52:23.360 --> 05:52:24.628 align:start position:0%
efa
proposals

05:52:24.628 --> 05:52:24.638 align:start position:0%
proposals
 
05:52:27.510 --> 05:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
it um it still takes out into the words
 
05:52:27.520 --> 05:52:29.030 align:start position:0%
it um it still takes out into the words
intentional

05:52:29.030 --> 05:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
intentional
 
05:52:32.310 --> 05:52:32.320 align:start position:0%
um but it does restore substantial
 
05:52:35.030 --> 05:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
and um reason for that is because you
 
05:52:37.910 --> 05:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
know it's i don't know how you
 
05:52:39.510 --> 05:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
how how you
 
05:52:41.270 --> 05:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
uh how a scholarship organization is
 
05:52:42.310 --> 05:52:42.320 align:start position:0%
going to be able to conduct an
 
05:52:45.030 --> 05:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
investment conduct an investigation to
 
05:52:46.390 --> 05:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
know whether or not something was
 
05:52:50.150 --> 05:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
intentional certainly submitting a form
 
05:52:53.590 --> 05:52:53.600 align:start position:0%
to request a distribution is intentional
 
05:52:55.510 --> 05:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
but whether that intent what is that was
 
05:52:57.590 --> 05:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
an intent of fraud that's really a
 
05:52:59.750 --> 05:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
question for law enforcement um
 
05:53:01.990 --> 05:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
department of justice and so that's why
 
05:53:03.670 --> 05:53:03.680 align:start position:0%
that comes out i put the word
 
05:53:05.750 --> 05:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
substantial back in
 
05:53:07.350 --> 05:53:07.360 align:start position:0%
so that these aren't don't become
 
05:53:09.990 --> 05:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
frivolous type uh you know five cents
 
05:53:12.070 --> 05:53:12.080 align:start position:0%
here 10 cents there did they use a stamp
 
05:53:13.990 --> 05:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
on the envelope you know stuff like that
 
05:53:16.628 --> 05:53:16.638 align:start position:0%
it's got to be substantial
 
05:53:19.670 --> 05:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
and and substantial is is at least when
 
05:53:22.070 --> 05:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh i think when when we had uh diana
 
05:53:24.390 --> 05:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
fenton she talked about how that was a
 
05:53:26.788 --> 05:53:26.798 align:start position:0%
uh um a term of law
 
05:53:29.910 --> 05:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
and um uh so that's back in there and
 
05:53:32.548 --> 05:53:32.558 align:start position:0%
then again it takes the uh you know the
 
05:53:35.110 --> 05:53:35.120 align:start position:0%
it's shall refer suspected cases
 
05:53:37.990 --> 05:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
substantial use of ef funds to the
 
05:53:40.310 --> 05:53:40.320 align:start position:0%
attorney general for investigation there
 
05:53:42.628 --> 05:53:42.638 align:start position:0%
you go that's where the investigation
 
05:53:44.310 --> 05:53:44.320 align:start position:0%
takes place so you don't need the rest
 
05:53:47.350 --> 05:53:47.360 align:start position:0%
of evidence because that's what the
 
05:53:48.788 --> 05:53:48.798 align:start position:0%
attorney general does
 
05:53:50.390 --> 05:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
so that's the that's the amendment i'd
 
05:53:52.628 --> 05:53:52.638 align:start position:0%
like to offer representative
 
05:53:54.868 --> 05:53:54.878 align:start position:0%
yeah just a quick are we being
 
05:53:56.310 --> 05:53:56.320 align:start position:0%
preliminary on this don't we have
 
05:53:57.510 --> 05:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
another bill
 
05:54:00.948 --> 05:54:00.958 align:start position:0%
to put a person in the department of
 
05:54:04.390 --> 05:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
education to look at efa
 
05:54:08.150 --> 05:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:08.160 --> 05:54:09.190 align:start position:0%
 
really

05:54:09.190 --> 05:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
really
 
05:54:11.510 --> 05:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
so wouldn't that so this would say maybe
 
05:54:13.510 --> 05:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
the department of education but then we
 
05:54:15.590 --> 05:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
have i don't believe we exact that bill
 
05:54:17.750 --> 05:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
yet correct no we haven't and that's a
 
05:54:19.350 --> 05:54:19.360 align:start position:0%
and that's a great question thanks ralph
 
05:54:20.708 --> 05:54:20.718 align:start position:0%
for bringing that up because um
 
05:54:23.030 --> 05:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
representative hamm i think brought uh
 
05:54:25.750 --> 05:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh brought that before us and uh
 
05:54:29.750 --> 05:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
and this would um uh
 
05:54:29.760 --> 05:54:30.708 align:start position:0%
and this would um uh
that

05:54:30.708 --> 05:54:30.718 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:54:32.230 --> 05:54:32.240 align:start position:0%
that bill does have some of this
 
05:54:32.240 --> 05:54:33.270 align:start position:0%
that bill does have some of this
language

05:54:33.270 --> 05:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
language
 
05:54:36.390 --> 05:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
in there if both bills pass
 
05:54:38.390 --> 05:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
that's the language that would that
 
05:54:41.350 --> 05:54:41.360 align:start position:0%
would um that would rule because it
 
05:54:43.670 --> 05:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
makes the change not only to the
 
05:54:45.750 --> 05:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
organization that oversees
 
05:54:48.070 --> 05:54:48.080 align:start position:0%
the efa but also the shall
 
05:54:48.080 --> 05:54:49.590 align:start position:0%
the efa but also the shall
[Music]

05:54:49.590 --> 05:54:49.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:54:51.830 --> 05:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
refer suspected cases of substantial
 
05:54:53.910 --> 05:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
misuse to the attorney general but if
 
05:54:53.920 --> 05:54:54.708 align:start position:0%
misuse to the attorney general but if
that

05:54:54.708 --> 05:54:54.718 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:54:57.430 --> 05:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
bill fails um
 
05:54:58.948 --> 05:54:58.958 align:start position:0%
then we don't have anything to fall back
 
05:55:02.548 --> 05:55:02.558 align:start position:0%
on and i do believe that that it was the
 
05:55:05.030 --> 05:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
the intent of the the original authors
 
05:55:07.430 --> 05:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
behind behind efas
 
05:55:08.830 --> 05:55:08.840 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
05:55:10.628 --> 05:55:10.638 align:start position:0%
to to
 
05:55:13.270 --> 05:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
to want to have some mechanism
 
05:55:15.910 --> 05:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
that that prevents uh fraudulent misuse
 
05:55:18.230 --> 05:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
or fraudulent use of the money because i
 
05:55:20.230 --> 05:55:20.240 align:start position:0%
think that that's part of the integrity
 
05:55:25.190 --> 05:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:27.910 --> 05:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
um i i got a question for you know the
 
05:55:29.830 --> 05:55:29.840 align:start position:0%
word intentional how
 
05:55:32.390 --> 05:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
how do you how do you prove intentional
 
05:55:34.230 --> 05:55:34.240 align:start position:0%
um you know do we have an attorney in
 
05:55:35.990 --> 05:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
the crowd here
 
05:55:37.830 --> 05:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
well that that's that's why the word
 
05:55:40.868 --> 05:55:40.878 align:start position:0%
intentional is taken i i i i agree with
 
05:55:42.548 --> 05:55:42.558 align:start position:0%
that and that's what's just saying it's
 
05:55:45.190 --> 05:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
very difficult for me to understand
 
05:55:46.708 --> 05:55:46.718 align:start position:0%
whether you're intentionally doing
 
05:55:48.470 --> 05:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
something or you're just plain doing it
 
05:55:50.628 --> 05:55:50.638 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:55:52.948 --> 05:55:52.958 align:start position:0%
there must be some kind of a fine line
 
05:55:52.958 --> 05:55:53.750 align:start position:0%
there must be some kind of a fine line
that

05:55:53.750 --> 05:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:55:55.750 --> 05:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
attorneys know about that common sense
 
05:55:55.760 --> 05:55:58.230 align:start position:0%
attorneys know about that common sense
doesn't

05:55:58.230 --> 05:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:00.150 --> 05:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
but it's a law enforcement it is a law
 
05:56:02.070 --> 05:56:02.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement thing i would say
 
05:56:05.270 --> 05:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
there's no secret fine line it is um
 
05:56:06.868 --> 05:56:06.878 align:start position:0%
i think what you're looking at at this
 
05:56:08.948 --> 05:56:08.958 align:start position:0%
point is what would
 
05:56:10.470 --> 05:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
more be viewed as prosecutorial
 
05:56:13.670 --> 05:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
discretion and that is as somebody you
 
05:56:15.510 --> 05:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
know county attorney if it's a criminal
 
05:56:17.270 --> 05:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
case or a civil case if somebody is
 
05:56:19.670 --> 05:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
trying to bring this case you know along
 
05:56:20.948 --> 05:56:20.958 align:start position:0%
the way
 
05:56:22.708 --> 05:56:22.718 align:start position:0%
they would weigh it and go ah do you
 
05:56:23.990 --> 05:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
think we can prove it you know and
 
05:56:25.670 --> 05:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
that's why sometimes things are
 
05:56:27.590 --> 05:56:27.600 align:start position:0%
convicted or acquitted or found for the
 
05:56:30.150 --> 05:56:30.160 align:start position:0%
plaintiff or not because it is a fine
 
05:56:32.470 --> 05:56:32.480 align:start position:0%
line and i think in the end it is the
 
05:56:34.548 --> 05:56:34.558 align:start position:0%
decision of the judge of the jury
 
05:56:36.948 --> 05:56:36.958 align:start position:0%
on those close cases i think sometimes
 
05:56:39.910 --> 05:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
intentional becomes very obvious
 
05:56:42.390 --> 05:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
people leave paper trails people
 
05:56:42.400 --> 05:56:43.190 align:start position:0%
people leave paper trails people
talk

05:56:43.190 --> 05:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
talk
 
05:56:45.190 --> 05:56:45.200 align:start position:0%
not in private you know and you can get
 
05:56:47.030 --> 05:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
a witness saying ah they told me what
 
05:56:49.110 --> 05:56:49.120 align:start position:0%
they're doing or you can find a text
 
05:56:50.708 --> 05:56:50.718 align:start position:0%
trail or an email trailer or something
 
05:56:52.948 --> 05:56:52.958 align:start position:0%
like that that easily improves intent
 
05:56:54.628 --> 05:56:54.638 align:start position:0%
i think the short the reason you're
 
05:56:56.150 --> 05:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
having trouble with it is because i
 
05:56:56.160 --> 05:56:57.590 align:start position:0%
having trouble with it is because i
think

05:56:57.590 --> 05:56:57.600 align:start position:0%
think
 
05:56:59.190 --> 05:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
it can be all over the place it can be
 
05:57:01.350 --> 05:57:01.360 align:start position:0%
anything from very obvious to a very
 
05:57:02.868 --> 05:57:02.878 align:start position:0%
close call that's going to be up to the
 
05:57:05.430 --> 05:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
prosecutor or the the attorneys in this
 
05:57:06.948 --> 05:57:06.958 align:start position:0%
case whether they think they can improve
 
05:57:06.958 --> 05:57:07.990 align:start position:0%
case whether they think they can improve
intent

05:57:07.990 --> 05:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
intent
 
05:57:09.910 --> 05:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
so um
 
05:57:12.470 --> 05:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
you know i think
 
05:57:14.788 --> 05:57:14.798 align:start position:0%
i i like you know i hadn't given this a
 
05:57:16.868 --> 05:57:16.878 align:start position:0%
whole lot of that but personally i like
 
05:57:18.628 --> 05:57:18.638 align:start position:0%
this amendment i think
 
05:57:20.868 --> 05:57:20.878 align:start position:0%
intentional sort of takes that out if
 
05:57:22.948 --> 05:57:22.958 align:start position:0%
you want and substantial again
 
05:57:25.670 --> 05:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
substantial is is not exactly a clearly
 
05:57:27.590 --> 05:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
defined term in the law you know it's
 
05:57:29.030 --> 05:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
one of those things that i think it
 
05:57:30.868 --> 05:57:30.878 align:start position:0%
really to a large extent falls back on
 
05:57:32.390 --> 05:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
the same meaning that you and i think of
 
05:57:35.430 --> 05:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
with substantial so neither one of those
 
05:57:38.230 --> 05:57:38.240 align:start position:0%
do i view i mean intent is a term in the
 
05:57:40.310 --> 05:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
law but the word intentional the word
 
05:57:42.470 --> 05:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
substantial they are not words that come
 
05:57:44.868 --> 05:57:44.878 align:start position:0%
to mind to me is being
 
05:57:44.878 --> 05:57:46.070 align:start position:0%
to mind to me is being
widely

05:57:46.070 --> 05:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
widely
 
05:57:47.910 --> 05:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
defined by case law as to what their
 
05:57:49.270 --> 05:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
meaning is
 
05:57:51.030 --> 05:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:57:52.948 --> 05:57:52.958 align:start position:0%
president cordelli
 
05:57:54.788 --> 05:57:54.798 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:57:57.510 --> 05:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
a couple of things
 
05:57:59.590 --> 05:57:59.600 align:start position:0%
they're using a system called class
 
05:58:03.270 --> 05:58:03.280 align:start position:0%
wallet to monitor expenses and approve
 
05:58:03.280 --> 05:58:04.868 align:start position:0%
wallet to monitor expenses and approve
expenses

05:58:04.868 --> 05:58:04.878 align:start position:0%
expenses
 
05:58:05.910 --> 05:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
there are
 
05:58:08.390 --> 05:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
great many reports out of that system
 
05:58:10.628 --> 05:58:10.638 align:start position:0%
and i believe that the
 
05:58:13.110 --> 05:58:13.120 align:start position:0%
intent is to
 
05:58:15.750 --> 05:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
provide access to that system to the
 
05:58:17.670 --> 05:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
department and i think that's maybe
 
05:58:20.070 --> 05:58:20.080 align:start position:0%
where the administrator comes in so they
 
05:58:22.948 --> 05:58:22.958 align:start position:0%
would have real-time access to view the
 
05:58:26.310 --> 05:58:26.320 align:start position:0%
transactions and there is much
 
05:58:28.310 --> 05:58:28.320 align:start position:0%
communication going on
 
05:58:29.910 --> 05:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
um i know from talking to people in the
 
05:58:29.920 --> 05:58:31.270 align:start position:0%
um i know from talking to people in the
department

05:58:31.270 --> 05:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
department
 
05:58:34.070 --> 05:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
and the scholarship fund um
 
05:58:37.590 --> 05:58:37.600 align:start position:0%
uh about questions and um you know about
 
05:58:40.548 --> 05:58:40.558 align:start position:0%
transactions and so forth so there's a
 
05:58:40.558 --> 05:58:42.788 align:start position:0%
transactions and so forth so there's a
great

05:58:42.788 --> 05:58:42.798 align:start position:0%
great
 
05:58:42.798 --> 05:58:44.310 align:start position:0%
great
communication

05:58:44.310 --> 05:58:44.320 align:start position:0%
communication
 
05:58:47.270 --> 05:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
going on in that respect
 
05:58:47.280 --> 05:58:48.230 align:start position:0%
going on in that respect
and

05:58:48.230 --> 05:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:58:50.628 --> 05:58:50.638 align:start position:0%
in addition i believe
 
05:58:52.948 --> 05:58:52.958 align:start position:0%
some of this in terms of
 
05:58:52.958 --> 05:58:54.708 align:start position:0%
some of this in terms of
misuse

05:58:54.708 --> 05:58:54.718 align:start position:0%
misuse
 
05:58:56.628 --> 05:58:56.638 align:start position:0%
and reporting
 
05:59:00.070 --> 05:59:00.080 align:start position:0%
is included in the contract that the
 
05:59:00.080 --> 05:59:02.628 align:start position:0%
is included in the contract that the
department

05:59:02.628 --> 05:59:02.638 align:start position:0%
department
 
05:59:05.750 --> 05:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
had signed by a children's scholarship
 
05:59:10.708 --> 05:59:10.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:12.788 --> 05:59:12.798 align:start position:0%
i think i've come to the
 
05:59:14.868 --> 05:59:14.878 align:start position:0%
um thought that
 
05:59:17.110 --> 05:59:17.120 align:start position:0%
it's really not needed
 
05:59:17.120 --> 05:59:18.310 align:start position:0%
it's really not needed
to

05:59:18.310 --> 05:59:18.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:59:18.320 --> 05:59:19.510 align:start position:0%
to
make

05:59:19.510 --> 05:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
make
 
05:59:21.350 --> 05:59:21.360 align:start position:0%
this change
 
05:59:22.948 --> 05:59:22.958 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
05:59:25.270 --> 05:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
one other aspect is i think some of it
 
05:59:27.270 --> 05:59:27.280 align:start position:0%
is provided for in
 
05:59:28.868 --> 05:59:28.878 align:start position:0%
rules that are
 
05:59:28.878 --> 05:59:29.910 align:start position:0%
rules that are
going

05:59:29.910 --> 05:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
going
 
05:59:29.920 --> 05:59:31.510 align:start position:0%
going
before

05:59:31.510 --> 05:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
before
 
05:59:33.430 --> 05:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
jailcar i think
 
05:59:40.788 --> 05:59:40.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:43.110 --> 05:59:43.120 align:start position:0%
you know a scholarship organization is
 
05:59:44.948 --> 05:59:44.958 align:start position:0%
going to have a lot on its plate and
 
05:59:47.670 --> 05:59:47.680 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be inclined to start
 
05:59:49.430 --> 05:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
going to look for this kind of stuff
 
05:59:51.510 --> 05:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
unless we tell them they got to do it
 
05:59:53.670 --> 05:59:53.680 align:start position:0%
and i think if we don't pass something
 
05:59:54.868 --> 05:59:54.878 align:start position:0%
like this
 
05:59:56.708 --> 05:59:56.718 align:start position:0%
it's just going to be overlooked i think
 
05:59:58.628 --> 05:59:58.638 align:start position:0%
if we really care about how the money's
 
06:00:00.390 --> 06:00:00.400 align:start position:0%
being used and we really want to protect
 
06:00:02.310 --> 06:00:02.320 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer we need to be passing
 
06:00:03.430 --> 06:00:03.440 align:start position:0%
something like this we need to be
 
06:00:05.030 --> 06:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
telling them yeah this is one of your
 
06:00:06.548 --> 06:00:06.558 align:start position:0%
responsibilities because if we don't
 
06:00:07.990 --> 06:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
tell them they're going to be doing
 
06:00:09.350 --> 06:00:09.360 align:start position:0%
other things and they're just not going
 
06:00:11.030 --> 06:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
to go looking for this and unless
 
06:00:12.548 --> 06:00:12.558 align:start position:0%
somebody throws it in their face that
 
06:00:14.868 --> 06:00:14.878 align:start position:0%
there's been some egregious abuse which
 
06:00:16.628 --> 06:00:16.638 align:start position:0%
is unlikely to happen
 
06:00:18.070 --> 06:00:18.080 align:start position:0%
they're not going to pay any attention
 
06:00:19.590 --> 06:00:19.600 align:start position:0%
as to whether there's a substantial
 
06:00:21.350 --> 06:00:21.360 align:start position:0%
misuse because they got
 
06:00:23.110 --> 06:00:23.120 align:start position:0%
like everything else in government too
 
06:00:26.868 --> 06:00:26.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:29.190 --> 06:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
can i ask you a question uh
 
06:00:31.030 --> 06:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
the last part which is scratched out
 
06:00:33.510 --> 06:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
fraudulent use
 
06:00:37.110 --> 06:00:37.120 align:start position:0%
evidence of fraudulent use
 
06:00:38.628 --> 06:00:38.638 align:start position:0%
how would that be
 
06:00:38.638 --> 06:00:40.788 align:start position:0%
how would that be
gathered

06:00:40.788 --> 06:00:40.798 align:start position:0%
gathered
 
06:00:42.788 --> 06:00:42.798 align:start position:0%
obviously it's
 
06:00:44.230 --> 06:00:44.240 align:start position:0%
the way it's written there right now i
 
06:00:47.910 --> 06:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:47.920 --> 06:00:48.788 align:start position:0%
 
would

06:00:48.788 --> 06:00:48.798 align:start position:0%
would
 
06:00:51.030 --> 06:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
have to have
 
06:00:53.270 --> 06:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
an understanding that's a fraudulent use
 
06:00:54.948 --> 06:00:54.958 align:start position:0%
of the efa funds before the
 
06:00:57.430 --> 06:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
investigation would occur
 
06:01:02.470 --> 06:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:03.670 --> 06:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
let me make sure i understand what
 
06:01:04.708 --> 06:01:04.718 align:start position:0%
you're saying
 
06:01:06.868 --> 06:01:06.878 align:start position:0%
under the current law or under under the
 
06:01:08.548 --> 06:01:08.558 align:start position:0%
current law they would have to have
 
06:01:10.948 --> 06:01:10.958 align:start position:0%
evidence of fraudulent use
 
06:01:10.958 --> 06:01:12.150 align:start position:0%
evidence of fraudulent use
of

06:01:12.150 --> 06:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:01:13.430 --> 06:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
let me just read it for a moment with
 
06:01:22.548 --> 06:01:22.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:24.390 --> 06:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not looking at yours i'm not looking
 
06:01:26.830 --> 06:01:26.840 align:start position:0%
at chairs i'm looking at what is in the
 
06:01:30.788 --> 06:01:30.798 align:start position:0%
current 1355.
 
06:01:30.798 --> 06:01:31.590 align:start position:0%
current 1355.
so

06:01:31.590 --> 06:01:31.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:01:31.600 --> 06:01:33.430 align:start position:0%
so
unintentional

06:01:33.430 --> 06:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
unintentional
 
06:01:33.440 --> 06:01:34.390 align:start position:0%
unintentional
so

06:01:34.390 --> 06:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:01:37.110 --> 06:01:37.120 align:start position:0%
evidence of fraudulent so would the
 
06:01:39.190 --> 06:01:39.200 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization have to come up
 
06:01:43.270 --> 06:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:45.270 --> 06:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
use of monies
 
06:01:47.030 --> 06:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
before the
 
06:01:49.110 --> 06:01:49.120 align:start position:0%
attorney general
 
06:01:51.190 --> 06:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
could investigate
 
06:01:53.590 --> 06:01:53.600 align:start position:0%
i because of the words is obtained i
 
06:01:56.390 --> 06:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
would argue yes because it says evidence
 
06:01:59.110 --> 06:01:59.120 align:start position:0%
of fraudulent use is obtained well
 
06:02:00.548 --> 06:02:00.558 align:start position:0%
how are you going to obtain it if you're
 
06:02:02.548 --> 06:02:02.558 align:start position:0%
not going out and
 
06:02:04.628 --> 06:02:04.638 align:start position:0%
you know i suppose somebody could
 
06:02:06.390 --> 06:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
lay it on you and say you know
 
06:02:07.590 --> 06:02:07.600 align:start position:0%
somebody's out there and they bought a
 
06:02:09.110 --> 06:02:09.120 align:start position:0%
new car with their efa money or
 
06:02:10.788 --> 06:02:10.798 align:start position:0%
something you know like if there was
 
06:02:13.590 --> 06:02:13.600 align:start position:0%
major abuse of it but
 
06:02:15.910 --> 06:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
yeah i would say that that
 
06:02:19.110 --> 06:02:19.120 align:start position:0%
as the law is currently written
 
06:02:21.030 --> 06:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
i i think i'm i think i'm answering the
 
06:02:23.990 --> 06:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
question you asked
 
06:02:26.150 --> 06:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
i think it also goes i mean the the
 
06:02:27.910 --> 06:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization
 
06:02:29.750 --> 06:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
is not in a position to make a legal
 
06:02:32.470 --> 06:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
finding of fraud
 
06:02:33.910 --> 06:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
that's right i mean that's what the
 
06:02:41.670 --> 06:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:43.110 --> 06:02:43.120 align:start position:0%
neither is the
 
06:02:45.750 --> 06:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
administrator at the efa the new
 
06:02:47.910 --> 06:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
position at the efa should that go
 
06:02:47.920 --> 06:02:48.788 align:start position:0%
position at the efa should that go
through

06:02:48.788 --> 06:02:48.798 align:start position:0%
through
 
06:02:50.948 --> 06:02:50.958 align:start position:0%
that position is described as a
 
06:02:53.270 --> 06:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
technical support position
 
06:02:55.750 --> 06:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
and the job description is described as
 
06:02:58.310 --> 06:02:58.320 align:start position:0%
being a resource to
 
06:02:59.830 --> 06:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
parents and
 
06:03:03.350 --> 06:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
students and the doe and whatever so i
 
06:03:04.788 --> 06:03:04.798 align:start position:0%
don't know that they've got the legal
 
06:03:06.948 --> 06:03:06.958 align:start position:0%
wherewithal to be able to
 
06:03:11.510 --> 06:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:14.070 --> 06:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
so would this amending language would
 
06:03:15.830 --> 06:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
this amending language be more
 
06:03:18.868 --> 06:03:18.878 align:start position:0%
protecting the scholarship organization
 
06:03:26.470 --> 06:03:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:26.480 --> 06:03:27.910 align:start position:0%
 
yes

06:03:27.910 --> 06:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:03:30.070 --> 06:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
i want to comment on the process that
 
06:03:30.080 --> 06:03:31.030 align:start position:0%
i want to comment on the process that
the

06:03:31.030 --> 06:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:03:34.070 --> 06:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
organization goes through i'm i'm sure
 
06:03:34.080 --> 06:03:35.030 align:start position:0%
organization goes through i'm i'm sure
that

06:03:35.030 --> 06:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:03:36.948 --> 06:03:36.958 align:start position:0%
people can figure out how to do just
 
06:03:38.868 --> 06:03:38.878 align:start position:0%
about anything and somebody might be
 
06:03:41.910 --> 06:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
able to the only fraud i could think of
 
06:03:41.920 --> 06:03:43.590 align:start position:0%
able to the only fraud i could think of
here

06:03:43.590 --> 06:03:43.600 align:start position:0%
here
 
06:03:43.600 --> 06:03:44.628 align:start position:0%
here
is

06:03:44.628 --> 06:03:44.638 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:03:46.788 --> 06:03:46.798 align:start position:0%
maybe they would sell the stuff instead
 
06:03:49.910 --> 06:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
of using them but otherwise
 
06:03:52.230 --> 06:03:52.240 align:start position:0%
the way the process works
 
06:03:55.430 --> 06:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
you can't get a penny even for a pencil
 
06:03:58.470 --> 06:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
without first putting in an application
 
06:03:59.990 --> 06:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
to the scholarship
 
06:04:02.470 --> 06:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
organization which goes over it which
 
06:04:04.788 --> 06:04:04.798 align:start position:0%
figures out whether it's appropriate use
 
06:04:08.708 --> 06:04:08.718 align:start position:0%
etc and then they okay and then you use
 
06:04:11.670 --> 06:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
that okay to go to a particular provider
 
06:04:14.868 --> 06:04:14.878 align:start position:0%
and that provider then provides and you
 
06:04:17.190 --> 06:04:17.200 align:start position:0%
pay for it and you get a receipt and you
 
06:04:19.430 --> 06:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
send the receipt in and you get
 
06:04:23.350 --> 06:04:23.360 align:start position:0%
reimbursed and so every single purchase
 
06:04:26.150 --> 06:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
even a pencil or eraser is personally
 
06:04:29.670 --> 06:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
okayed by a human being before it's ever
 
06:04:29.680 --> 06:04:30.548 align:start position:0%
okayed by a human being before it's ever
made

06:04:30.548 --> 06:04:30.558 align:start position:0%
made
 
06:04:33.350 --> 06:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
so you can't buy a car or a tv or any of
 
06:04:36.150 --> 06:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
that stuff and not only that the
 
06:04:39.190 --> 06:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
providers who want to stay providers are
 
06:04:41.030 --> 06:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
super super careful because they don't
 
06:04:43.670 --> 06:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
want to lose that business and i will
 
06:04:44.628 --> 06:04:44.638 align:start position:0%
tell you
 
06:04:46.628 --> 06:04:46.638 align:start position:0%
that some friends of mine because there
 
06:04:46.638 --> 06:04:47.430 align:start position:0%
that some friends of mine because there
were

06:04:47.430 --> 06:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
were
 
06:04:50.070 --> 06:04:50.080 align:start position:0%
a number of children well there were six
 
06:04:51.910 --> 06:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
children in the program and a number of
 
06:04:53.270 --> 06:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
them needed new
 
06:04:55.830 --> 06:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
uh laptops
 
06:04:58.948 --> 06:04:58.958 align:start position:0%
amazon decided to take away their
 
06:05:01.910 --> 06:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
ability after these laptops because they
 
06:05:04.150 --> 06:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
said oh that's too many laptops because
 
06:05:07.030 --> 06:05:07.040 align:start position:0%
they're thinking of like a kid or two
 
06:05:09.430 --> 06:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
and not all six kids got laptops but i'm
 
06:05:11.270 --> 06:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
just saying it was more than the one or
 
06:05:13.030 --> 06:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
two and
 
06:05:15.190 --> 06:05:15.200 align:start position:0%
and amazon itself who was one of the
 
06:05:18.310 --> 06:05:18.320 align:start position:0%
providers for particular things
 
06:05:21.110 --> 06:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
even though the purchase was okayed even
 
06:05:23.830 --> 06:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
though everything was done and whatever
 
06:05:25.590 --> 06:05:25.600 align:start position:0%
amazon itself because they wanted to
 
06:05:27.670 --> 06:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
stay providers said this looks fishy to
 
06:05:27.680 --> 06:05:28.470 align:start position:0%
stay providers said this looks fishy to
me

06:05:28.470 --> 06:05:28.480 align:start position:0%
me
 
06:05:30.868 --> 06:05:30.878 align:start position:0%
and closed and and put a hold on the
 
06:05:33.910 --> 06:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
account so it will be very very hard for
 
06:05:37.750 --> 06:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
anybody to commit fraud it be as far as
 
06:05:39.670 --> 06:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
purchasing the only thing i can think of
 
06:05:41.670 --> 06:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
is if they then decided to go off and
 
06:05:42.708 --> 06:05:42.718 align:start position:0%
sell those
 
06:05:44.628 --> 06:05:44.638 align:start position:0%
sell the things that were gotten
 
06:05:44.638 --> 06:05:46.868 align:start position:0%
sell the things that were gotten
um

06:05:46.868 --> 06:05:46.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:05:49.110 --> 06:05:49.120 align:start position:0%
and so other than that i mean this whole
 
06:05:51.030 --> 06:05:51.040 align:start position:0%
idea of buying all these fraudulent
 
06:05:54.070 --> 06:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
things or whatever it's it it's not
 
06:05:56.628 --> 06:05:56.638 align:start position:0%
going to happen every single purchase is
 
06:05:58.470 --> 06:05:58.480 align:start position:0%
reviewed first
 
06:06:00.868 --> 06:06:00.878 align:start position:0%
and the people have do not have the
 
06:06:03.350 --> 06:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
money okay they don't get the money they
 
06:06:05.510 --> 06:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
get the money as a refund
 
06:06:08.868 --> 06:06:08.878 align:start position:0%
for a purchase that was made or
 
06:06:10.470 --> 06:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
the money goes straight from the
 
06:06:13.670 --> 06:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization to the provider
 
06:06:15.350 --> 06:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
it never
 
06:06:20.150 --> 06:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
never is in the hands of the actual
 
06:06:20.160 --> 06:06:21.270 align:start position:0%
never is in the hands of the actual
parents

06:06:21.270 --> 06:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
parents
 
06:06:23.830 --> 06:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
they don't get it
 
06:06:23.840 --> 06:06:25.030 align:start position:0%
they don't get it
represented

06:06:25.030 --> 06:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
represented
 
06:06:26.070 --> 06:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:06:27.270 --> 06:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
um just
 
06:06:29.670 --> 06:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
in terms of terminology it doesn't go
 
06:06:31.830 --> 06:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
from the scholarship organization to the
 
06:06:35.350 --> 06:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
provider it goes from the uh efa account
 
06:06:37.430 --> 06:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
to the service provider
 
06:06:39.910 --> 06:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
and all the transactions are
 
06:06:39.920 --> 06:06:41.590 align:start position:0%
and all the transactions are
electronic

06:06:41.590 --> 06:06:41.600 align:start position:0%
electronic
 
06:06:44.628 --> 06:06:44.638 align:start position:0%
um and secondly i know specifically of
 
06:06:45.910 --> 06:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
an instance
 
06:06:45.920 --> 06:06:47.350 align:start position:0%
an instance
um

06:06:47.350 --> 06:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:06:49.030 --> 06:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
two children in the family one with an
 
06:06:51.030 --> 06:06:51.040 align:start position:0%
efa one wasn't
 
06:06:55.590 --> 06:06:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:57.750 --> 06:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship fund
 
06:06:59.910 --> 06:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
saw the transaction had questions about
 
06:07:01.030 --> 06:07:01.040 align:start position:0%
the book
 
06:07:02.868 --> 06:07:02.878 align:start position:0%
they verified what the age
 
06:07:05.830 --> 06:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
age-appropriate level was for that book
 
06:07:09.190 --> 06:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
to find out is this going to the child
 
06:07:13.190 --> 06:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
with an efa or the child without an efa
 
06:07:15.430 --> 06:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
so that's the extent of the verification
 
06:07:20.390 --> 06:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:23.030 --> 06:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
represent porter
 
06:07:24.948 --> 06:07:24.958 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chair what
 
06:07:27.430 --> 06:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you want to just make sure and
 
06:07:31.030 --> 06:07:31.040 align:start position:0%
protect that organization make sure that
 
06:07:33.190 --> 06:07:33.200 align:start position:0%
they are checking into potential fraud
 
06:07:35.110 --> 06:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
if they find it i mean it seems to me
 
06:07:37.270 --> 06:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
that if you want this program to be
 
06:07:40.310 --> 06:07:40.320 align:start position:0%
successful you would dread
 
06:07:42.788 --> 06:07:42.798 align:start position:0%
case coming out in the public of massive
 
06:07:44.868 --> 06:07:44.878 align:start position:0%
fraud of use of the funds
 
06:07:46.948 --> 06:07:46.958 align:start position:0%
if even though you say it might not
 
06:07:46.958 --> 06:07:48.230 align:start position:0%
if even though you say it might not
happen

06:07:48.230 --> 06:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
happen
 
06:07:49.670 --> 06:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you want to make sure it
 
06:07:51.430 --> 06:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
couldn't happen by having something like
 
06:07:56.708 --> 06:07:56.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:59.270 --> 06:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
how would passing a bill keep it from
 
06:08:00.868 --> 06:08:00.878 align:start position:0%
happening if the scholarship
 
06:08:04.390 --> 06:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
organization in their own self-interest
 
06:08:06.310 --> 06:08:06.320 align:start position:0%
is looking to make sure there is no
 
06:08:06.320 --> 06:08:07.430 align:start position:0%
is looking to make sure there is no
fraud

06:08:07.430 --> 06:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
fraud
 
06:08:09.590 --> 06:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
then how is passing this bill going to
 
06:08:11.750 --> 06:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
stop fraud
 
06:08:14.470 --> 06:08:14.480 align:start position:0%
so so again i think the
 
06:08:16.390 --> 06:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
the operative word here is words here
 
06:08:18.948 --> 06:08:18.958 align:start position:0%
misuse of funds fraud is a legal
 
06:08:21.910 --> 06:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
determination that um that that
 
06:08:25.030 --> 06:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
currently the um
 
06:08:28.150 --> 06:08:28.160 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization is uh is in
 
06:08:30.788 --> 06:08:30.798 align:start position:0%
the hot seat to have to determine if
 
06:08:33.190 --> 06:08:33.200 align:start position:0%
evidence of fraudulent use of efa funds
 
06:08:34.390 --> 06:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
is obtained
 
06:08:36.868 --> 06:08:36.878 align:start position:0%
um i think this this uh i think the
 
06:08:36.878 --> 06:08:38.070 align:start position:0%
um i think this this uh i think the
amendment

06:08:38.070 --> 06:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
06:08:39.830 --> 06:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
i think the bill
 
06:08:43.350 --> 06:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
and the amendment both clarify that
 
06:08:45.350 --> 06:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
and and and go right along the lines of
 
06:08:47.670 --> 06:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
what you're talking about uh alicia that
 
06:08:49.670 --> 06:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization has a very
 
06:08:51.830 --> 06:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
robust very strict
 
06:08:51.840 --> 06:08:53.030 align:start position:0%
robust very strict
um

06:08:53.030 --> 06:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:08:55.110 --> 06:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
misuse detection
 
06:08:57.990 --> 06:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
system in place
 
06:08:59.990 --> 06:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
but should something
 
06:09:01.270 --> 06:09:01.280 align:start position:0%
go awry
 
06:09:05.350 --> 06:09:05.360 align:start position:0%
should something be uh be be misused
 
06:09:07.910 --> 06:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
then then the scholarship organization
 
06:09:10.390 --> 06:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
all you have to do is say look is it
 
06:09:12.628 --> 06:09:12.638 align:start position:0%
substantial okay
 
06:09:14.310 --> 06:09:14.320 align:start position:0%
attorney general
 
06:09:15.990 --> 06:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
you take it the rest of the way take
 
06:09:17.750 --> 06:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
some out of the hot seat
 
06:09:21.510 --> 06:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
um to to to determine investigations and
 
06:09:23.670 --> 06:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
i think it's uh i think this both the
 
06:09:26.070 --> 06:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
bill and particularly the amendment are
 
06:09:29.350 --> 06:09:29.360 align:start position:0%
both good looks um at the efa program
 
06:09:33.110 --> 06:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
for um um granite staters who um who may
 
06:09:34.548 --> 06:09:34.558 align:start position:0%
be uh
 
06:09:36.390 --> 06:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
very um
 
06:09:40.390 --> 06:09:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:41.830 --> 06:09:41.840 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
06:09:43.510 --> 06:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
representative nelson
 
06:09:45.110 --> 06:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
thank you this is probably a stupid
 
06:09:47.110 --> 06:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
question but who's watching who is the
 
06:09:48.948 --> 06:09:48.958 align:start position:0%
problem watching the scholarship
 
06:09:48.958 --> 06:09:50.628 align:start position:0%
problem watching the scholarship
organization

06:09:50.628 --> 06:09:50.638 align:start position:0%
organization
 
06:09:52.548 --> 06:09:52.558 align:start position:0%
and their employees is watching the
 
06:09:54.868 --> 06:09:54.878 align:start position:0%
parent and what they have they're
 
06:09:56.470 --> 06:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
processing this or how they're involved
 
06:09:58.390 --> 06:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
in the school who's
 
06:10:00.150 --> 06:10:00.160 align:start position:0%
what's included i guess i'm confused and
 
06:10:04.628 --> 06:10:04.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:06.708 --> 06:10:06.718 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i get the i'm not sure i
 
06:10:08.548 --> 06:10:08.558 align:start position:0%
understood the question
 
06:10:10.150 --> 06:10:10.160 align:start position:0%
again i was not at the hearing so we
 
06:10:12.070 --> 06:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
have to apologize that
 
06:10:14.548 --> 06:10:14.558 align:start position:0%
i have to apologize for that
 
06:10:15.910 --> 06:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
we're looking for
 
06:10:18.230 --> 06:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
suspected cases of
 
06:10:22.070 --> 06:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
misuse of funds are we watching the
 
06:10:24.310 --> 06:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
organization that's overseeing the funds
 
06:10:25.910 --> 06:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
for fraud
 
06:10:28.548 --> 06:10:28.558 align:start position:0%
or the people who want to get the funds
 
06:10:30.310 --> 06:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
from them
 
06:10:32.150 --> 06:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
who are we watching both or just one or
 
06:10:34.470 --> 06:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
the other so this is specifically that
 
06:10:36.788 --> 06:10:36.798 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization
 
06:10:38.628 --> 06:10:38.638 align:start position:0%
who is is
 
06:10:42.390 --> 06:10:42.400 align:start position:0%
is uh overseeing or is managing
 
06:10:46.390 --> 06:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
the distribution of efa dollars
 
06:10:49.030 --> 06:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
and uh should they see
 
06:10:52.390 --> 06:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
what um what what is a what what they
 
06:10:56.230 --> 06:10:56.240 align:start position:0%
suspect may be a misuse of eight uh efa
 
06:10:59.030 --> 06:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
funds that they report that to the
 
06:11:00.788 --> 06:11:00.798 align:start position:0%
attorney general for investigation thank
 
06:11:00.798 --> 06:11:04.070 align:start position:0%
attorney general for investigation thank
you

06:11:04.070 --> 06:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:08.070 --> 06:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:11.030 --> 06:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i think an element of
 
06:11:12.708 --> 06:11:12.718 align:start position:0%
the question that was just asked that
 
06:11:14.868 --> 06:11:14.878 align:start position:0%
you didn't respond to was what if
 
06:11:17.030 --> 06:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
someone in the organization is
 
06:11:19.270 --> 06:11:19.280 align:start position:0%
defrauding the money
 
06:11:21.430 --> 06:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
someone who's supposed to be overseeing
 
06:11:24.868 --> 06:11:24.878 align:start position:0%
it finds creates a fictitious creature
 
06:11:27.430 --> 06:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
funds money to it and collects it right
 
06:11:29.670 --> 06:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
in their name is that any protection
 
06:11:31.350 --> 06:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
against that sure sure so the
 
06:11:33.270 --> 06:11:33.280 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization reports to the
 
06:11:34.390 --> 06:11:34.400 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire through a
 
06:11:36.868 --> 06:11:36.878 align:start position:0%
contract with the um with the with the
 
06:11:38.788 --> 06:11:38.798 align:start position:0%
governor's office and uh executive
 
06:11:42.788 --> 06:11:42.798 align:start position:0%
council so that contract um i i
 
06:11:44.788 --> 06:11:44.798 align:start position:0%
actually i have copies of it i don't
 
06:11:47.190 --> 06:11:47.200 align:start position:0%
have it memorized right now but i'm sure
 
06:11:49.830 --> 06:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
there there's there's there's probably
 
06:11:52.628 --> 06:11:52.638 align:start position:0%
like a lot of contracts have um have
 
06:11:56.310 --> 06:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
have clauses that uh that contain um
 
06:11:57.830 --> 06:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
terms that would follow that but that's
 
06:11:59.510 --> 06:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
a that's a reporting function directly
 
06:12:03.110 --> 06:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:05.030 --> 06:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
okay is there a further
 
06:12:05.040 --> 06:12:06.470 align:start position:0%
okay is there a further
discussion

06:12:06.470 --> 06:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
06:12:08.470 --> 06:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
represent tanner
 
06:12:11.110 --> 06:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
stuck around the corner here um i just
 
06:12:13.590 --> 06:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
uh you know i i think
 
06:12:16.310 --> 06:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
from my reading anyway and and
 
06:12:16.320 --> 06:12:17.110 align:start position:0%
from my reading anyway and and
just

06:12:17.110 --> 06:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
just
 
06:12:19.190 --> 06:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
i guess to back up whenever there's a
 
06:12:20.868 --> 06:12:20.878 align:start position:0%
large amount of money
 
06:12:23.190 --> 06:12:23.200 align:start position:0%
floating around it seems like there's
 
06:12:25.190 --> 06:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
always the potential for fraud
 
06:12:27.430 --> 06:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
and i think the people that
 
06:12:31.030 --> 06:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
commit fraud uh or try to or seize that
 
06:12:31.040 --> 06:12:33.510 align:start position:0%
commit fraud uh or try to or seize that
opportunity

06:12:33.510 --> 06:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
06:12:36.788 --> 06:12:36.798 align:start position:0%
you know kind of go out and seek it and
 
06:12:38.470 --> 06:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
we've seen it happen in other states i
 
06:12:41.270 --> 06:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
mean even individually you're not exempt
 
06:12:41.280 --> 06:12:42.548 align:start position:0%
mean even individually you're not exempt
from

06:12:42.548 --> 06:12:42.558 align:start position:0%
from
 
06:12:44.470 --> 06:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
having something fraudulently you know
 
06:12:47.030 --> 06:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
your id stolen or whatever particularly
 
06:12:48.310 --> 06:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
when you're interacting over the
 
06:12:51.430 --> 06:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
internet so i just think this is like a
 
06:12:51.440 --> 06:12:52.830 align:start position:0%
internet so i just think this is like a
protection

06:12:52.830 --> 06:12:52.840 align:start position:0%
protection
 
06:12:55.830 --> 06:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
um it's a protective statement
 
06:12:58.788 --> 06:12:58.798 align:start position:0%
and um i think it you know it's it's
 
06:13:01.030 --> 06:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
kind of like an insurance uh that we're
 
06:13:02.230 --> 06:13:02.240 align:start position:0%
going to have
 
06:13:03.590 --> 06:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
some backup
 
06:13:03.600 --> 06:13:04.390 align:start position:0%
some backup
um

06:13:04.390 --> 06:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:13:04.400 --> 06:13:05.270 align:start position:0%
um
because

06:13:05.270 --> 06:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
because
 
06:13:07.350 --> 06:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
you know things like that are just part
 
06:13:08.868 --> 06:13:08.878 align:start position:0%
of our
 
06:13:10.548 --> 06:13:10.558 align:start position:0%
culture now i think
 
06:13:12.230 --> 06:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
okay i think there's been enough
 
06:13:14.150 --> 06:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
discussion on this what i'm going to do
 
06:13:14.160 --> 06:13:15.270 align:start position:0%
discussion on this what i'm going to do
is

06:13:15.270 --> 06:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:13:17.030 --> 06:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to take action on this one
 
06:13:17.040 --> 06:13:18.390 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to take action on this one
today

06:13:18.390 --> 06:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
today
 
06:13:20.548 --> 06:13:20.558 align:start position:0%
um this has been introduced and i think
 
06:13:21.990 --> 06:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
it's generated
 
06:13:23.030 --> 06:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
all our
 
06:13:25.190 --> 06:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
wheels and gears up here to start you
 
06:13:26.708 --> 06:13:26.718 align:start position:0%
know moving
 
06:13:29.110 --> 06:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
and i myself right now i'm having a
 
06:13:31.030 --> 06:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
difficult time
 
06:13:31.040 --> 06:13:33.110 align:start position:0%
difficult time
um

06:13:33.110 --> 06:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:13:34.548 --> 06:13:34.558 align:start position:0%
with the
 
06:13:34.558 --> 06:13:35.430 align:start position:0%
with the
with

06:13:35.430 --> 06:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
with
 
06:13:37.750 --> 06:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
what we've got here and which is the
 
06:13:39.270 --> 06:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
path to take
 
06:13:39.280 --> 06:13:40.070 align:start position:0%
path to take
so

06:13:40.070 --> 06:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:13:41.990 --> 06:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
we'll recess this one there's not
 
06:13:43.750 --> 06:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
there's nothing on the table right now
 
06:13:45.750 --> 06:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
other than discussion which we've had so
 
06:13:48.628 --> 06:13:48.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:50.390 --> 06:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
even take it home and sleep on a little
 
06:13:52.470 --> 06:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
bit maybe we can get this on the docket
 
06:13:55.030 --> 06:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
again tomorrow you know rick since it's
 
06:13:57.270 --> 06:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
since it's not an early bill i might
 
06:13:59.750 --> 06:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
suggest uh we consider it back-to-back
 
06:14:03.510 --> 06:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
when bonnie ham's uh bill comes to exec
 
06:14:04.788 --> 06:14:04.798 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
06:14:06.708 --> 06:14:06.718 align:start position:0%
exactly where ralph was what's the
 
06:14:14.868 --> 06:14:14.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:23.270 --> 06:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:25.830 --> 06:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
so anyways i think what we will do is
 
06:14:27.590 --> 06:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
let's jump over that quickly and take
 
06:14:30.150 --> 06:14:30.160 align:start position:0%
care of a couple that i know we can do
 
06:14:30.160 --> 06:14:31.510 align:start position:0%
care of a couple that i know we can do
um

06:14:31.510 --> 06:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:14:33.350 --> 06:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
the next one
 
06:14:36.070 --> 06:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
um centralized criminal records check
 
06:14:36.080 --> 06:14:43.750 align:start position:0%
um centralized criminal records check
1398.

06:14:43.750 --> 06:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:43.760 --> 06:14:54.628 align:start position:0%
 
uh

06:14:54.628 --> 06:14:54.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:58.390 --> 06:14:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:00.868 --> 06:15:00.878 align:start position:0%
it's one you're
 
06:15:00.878 --> 06:15:07.190 align:start position:0%
it's one you're
yeah

06:15:07.190 --> 06:15:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:09.510 --> 06:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
yeah 1398 establishing committee to
 
06:15:10.948 --> 06:15:10.958 align:start position:0%
study the feasibility of centralized
 
06:15:12.830 --> 06:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
criminal history records checks in
 
06:15:15.430 --> 06:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
education and carol mcguire came in here

06:15:20.708 --> 06:15:20.718 align:start position:0%
jail card level as well
 
06:15:23.190 --> 06:15:23.200 align:start position:0%
so i'll recognize at this time uh
 
06:15:23.200 --> 06:15:24.470 align:start position:0%
so i'll recognize at this time uh
represent

06:15:24.470 --> 06:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
represent
 
06:15:26.230 --> 06:15:26.240 align:start position:0%
like us
 
06:15:29.110 --> 06:15:29.120 align:start position:0%

otf otl i'm confused
 
06:15:35.830 --> 06:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
i think so
 
06:15:38.150 --> 06:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
06:15:40.948 --> 06:15:40.958 align:start position:0%
and is there a second for ought to pass
 
06:15:43.030 --> 06:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
on the centralized criminal records
 
06:15:43.040 --> 06:15:45.510 align:start position:0%
on the centralized criminal records
check

06:15:45.510 --> 06:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:47.430 --> 06:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
that was foreign
 
06:15:51.750 --> 06:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:54.470 --> 06:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
okay any further discussion from the
 
06:15:54.480 --> 06:15:56.708 align:start position:0%
okay any further discussion from the
maker

06:15:56.708 --> 06:15:56.718 align:start position:0%
maker
 
06:15:59.750 --> 06:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
yes since we have seen this many times
 
06:16:01.030 --> 06:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
06:16:02.788 --> 06:16:02.798 align:start position:0%
been an issue on many bills we've been
 
06:16:05.270 --> 06:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
trying to do and various people in here
 
06:16:07.110 --> 06:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
have worked on this before on
 
06:16:09.430 --> 06:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittees and study things and
 
06:16:09.440 --> 06:16:10.788 align:start position:0%
subcommittees and study things and
whatever

06:16:10.788 --> 06:16:10.798 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
06:16:12.628 --> 06:16:12.638 align:start position:0%
we know that it's something that we need
 
06:16:14.230 --> 06:16:14.240 align:start position:0%
to take care of but we also know that
 
06:16:16.708 --> 06:16:16.718 align:start position:0%
it's extremely complicated when we first
 
06:16:18.628 --> 06:16:18.638 align:start position:0%
went to do it it was like oh piece of
 
06:16:20.470 --> 06:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
cake and then the more we looked the
 
06:16:22.230 --> 06:16:22.240 align:start position:0%
more we found that this conflicts with
 
06:16:24.548 --> 06:16:24.558 align:start position:0%
that and this needs these permissions
 
06:16:26.948 --> 06:16:26.958 align:start position:0%
and so it would be nice to do have an
 
06:16:26.958 --> 06:16:28.150 align:start position:0%
and so it would be nice to do have an
actual

06:16:28.150 --> 06:16:28.160 align:start position:0%
actual
 
06:16:29.990 --> 06:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
committee to
 
06:16:31.670 --> 06:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
study all the ins and outs and get all
 
06:16:33.430 --> 06:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
the appropriate people there the safety
 
06:16:36.948 --> 06:16:36.958 align:start position:0%
people and the administrative people and
 
06:16:39.190 --> 06:16:39.200 align:start position:0%
the education people and see if we can
 
06:16:41.430 --> 06:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
for once and for all actually
 
06:16:43.670 --> 06:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
come up with something that will work
 
06:16:45.670 --> 06:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
maybe we can't but at least this will
 
06:16:47.910 --> 06:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
give us the best attempt
 
06:16:49.510 --> 06:16:49.520 align:start position:0%

the maker of the blurb do you have
 
06:20:02.628 --> 06:20:02.638 align:start position:0%

anything to say
um

06:20:03.510 --> 06:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:20:05.910 --> 06:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
i guess a couple things one was that it
 
06:20:07.830 --> 06:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
seems like a really complicated issue
 
06:20:10.230 --> 06:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
that needs to be sorted out a little bit
 
06:20:10.240 --> 06:20:11.110 align:start position:0%
that needs to be sorted out a little bit
more

06:20:11.110 --> 06:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
more
 
06:20:14.070 --> 06:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
um and i know at least from up in my
 
06:20:17.030 --> 06:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
area where every student is bused to
 
06:20:19.110 --> 06:20:19.120 align:start position:0%

that um
 
06:20:22.230 --> 06:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
some of the requests in this this bill
 
06:20:25.270 --> 06:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
made it um virtually impossible to
 
06:20:27.830 --> 06:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
to do it in an effective efficient and
 
06:20:29.510 --> 06:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
manner so
 
06:20:29.520 --> 06:20:30.868 align:start position:0%
manner so
okay

06:20:30.868 --> 06:20:30.878 align:start position:0%

06:20:50.868 --> 06:20:50.878 align:start position:0%
going on but apparently it's not going

out of manchester if it was going on
