us to the Atlantic time zone and off of

uh daylight savings time
 
00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:24.419 align:start position:0%
this bill may look very familiar as it
 
00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:26.639 align:start position:0%
is the same bill that was
 
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
um passed from this committee a couple
 
00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:31.139 align:start position:0%
of years ago
 
00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:38.759 align:start position:0%
and it is it is uh back again so in in
 
00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:41.759 align:start position:0%
California and Florida they have passed
 
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh measures around uh daylight savings
 
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:47.940 align:start position:0%
times in an attempt to go to Daylight
 
00:06:50.809 --> 00:06:50.819 align:start position:0%
Savings time all year round however that
 
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
would require an act of Congress
 
00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.430 align:start position:0%
would require an act of Congress
which

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
um efforts are moving towards that but
 
00:06:59.390 --> 00:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
it doesn't seem to be
 
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
um forthcoming
 
00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:03.780 align:start position:0%
and so this proposal would make that
 
00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:05.759 align:start position:0%
same move without the need for an act of
 
00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:07.309 align:start position:0%
same move without the need for an act of
Congress

00:07:07.309 --> 00:07:07.319 align:start position:0%
Congress
 
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:10.380 align:start position:0%
um in 2017 Massachusetts formed a
 
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:12.360 align:start position:0%
special commission to study the costs
 
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
and benefits of this change and they
 
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
actually came up with the idea of moving
 
00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:23.340 align:start position:0%
to the well they kind of sanctioned the
 
00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
idea of moving
 
00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:25.850 align:start position:0%
idea of moving
um

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:25.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:29.220 align:start position:0%
as a group to the Atlantic time zone
 
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:31.020 align:start position:0%
instead of
 
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:39.240 align:start position:0%

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
um they've the commission found that
 
00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:49.800 align:start position:0%
there was an increase in economic growth
 
00:07:51.469 --> 00:07:51.479 align:start position:0%
and productivity while reducing

um
 
00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:02.220 align:start position:0%
a lot of these benefits come from just
 
00:08:03.969 --> 00:08:03.979 align:start position:0%
not switching

since we are
 
00:08:12.529 --> 00:08:12.539 align:start position:0%

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
um one hour and a half to one hour and
 
00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:34.140 align:start position:0%
45 minutes of of time uh via the Sun and
 
00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:36.440 align:start position:0%
so it was
 
00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:40.140 align:start position:0%
suggested that at least part of the
 
00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:42.200 align:start position:0%
eastern part of the Eastern Time Zone
 
00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:44.580 align:start position:0%
moved to
 
00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:46.010 align:start position:0%
moved to
uh

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:46.020 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
this this Atlantic time zone while
 
00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:52.740 align:start position:0%
leaving the western part of the the uh
 
00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:55.380 align:start position:0%
the eastern time current Eastern Time
 
00:08:58.509 --> 00:08:58.519 align:start position:0%
Zone in their uh
 
00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
current time
 
00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
so that uh it would more reflect what
 
00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:09.240 align:start position:0%
the sun is actually doing uh
 
00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:11.519 align:start position:0%
another recommendation which
 
00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:14.580 align:start position:0%
which is uh kind of goes in tandem with
 
00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:17.220 align:start position:0%
this but is not something that should be
 
00:09:21.829 --> 00:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
uh addressed uh via a statute is a
 
00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:23.580 align:start position:0%
recommendation for schools to not start
 
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
before 8 30 a.m this goes to the
 
00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
suggestion that children need that their
 
00:09:35.449 --> 00:09:35.459 align:start position:0%
their sleep and also with this when this
 
00:09:35.459 --> 00:09:36.829 align:start position:0%
their sleep and also with this when this
um

00:09:36.829 --> 00:09:36.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:39.660 align:start position:0%
this passes you don't want to have uh
 
00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:43.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:48.360 align:start position:0%
um so with this result
 
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
um well currently eastern time zones
 
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.990 align:start position:0%
um well currently eastern time zones
States

00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
States
 
00:09:58.009 --> 00:09:58.019 align:start position:0%
in the uh very far east part of that
 
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
time zone when they fall fall back in
 
00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
the winter they have sunsets around 5 to
 
00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:05.519 align:start position:0%
5 30 P.M
 
00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
and this can uh cause issues in the
 
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
evening commute in the dark which
 
00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:15.660 align:start position:0%
increases collisions with pedestrians
 
00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
and Wildlife and
 
00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.490 align:start position:0%
and Wildlife and
um

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
so this this change would only affect
 
00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:25.740 align:start position:0%
those winter months we would only be
 
00:10:29.389 --> 00:10:29.399 align:start position:0%
uh at a different time zone than the the
 
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
rest of the Eastern time zone four
 
00:10:33.829 --> 00:10:33.839 align:start position:0%
months of the year as long as they kept
 
00:10:36.829 --> 00:10:36.839 align:start position:0%
their daylight savings time
 
00:10:38.509 --> 00:10:38.519 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:10:41.829 --> 00:10:41.839 align:start position:0%
one of the the hurdles
 
00:10:45.769 --> 00:10:45.779 align:start position:0%
that have come up with this is
 
00:10:45.779 --> 00:10:46.810 align:start position:0%
that have come up with this is
um

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:46.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:49.260 align:start position:0%
pushed back by
 
00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.050 align:start position:0%
pushed back by
uh

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:51.060 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:54.420 align:start position:0%
the broadcasters Association
 
00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:55.490 align:start position:0%
the broadcasters Association
um

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:55.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:58.430 --> 00:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
because of the
 
00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.009 align:start position:0%
because of the
the

00:11:00.009 --> 00:11:00.019 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:11:04.269 --> 00:11:04.279 align:start position:0%
complexities of trying to
 
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
create more ad uh
 
00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:11.220 align:start position:0%
options and selling ad space
 
00:11:12.829 --> 00:11:12.839 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
the way that it was trying that that the
 
00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
Commission in Massachusetts tried to
 
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
address this issue was to go as a block
 
00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:24.680 align:start position:0%
and that's why this bill is
 
00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:28.260 align:start position:0%
contingent on kind of our our region of
 
00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:30.660 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and
 
00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
um Maine but if it uh if we came to an
 
00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:38.700 align:start position:0%
agreement with the uh
 
00:11:41.329 --> 00:11:41.339 align:start position:0%
the broadcasters Association that more
 
00:11:44.329 --> 00:11:44.339 align:start position:0%
States would be needed to be
 
00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:46.740 align:start position:0%
economically feasible for them that
 
00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:49.620 align:start position:0%
would be considered absolutely
 
00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:50.269 align:start position:0%
would be considered absolutely
um

00:11:50.269 --> 00:11:50.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:54.540 align:start position:0%
and so with that uh I would like to
 
00:11:57.530 --> 00:11:57.540 align:start position:0%
thank you for for hearing my testimony
 
00:12:02.569 --> 00:12:02.579 align:start position:0%
and there there is an expert hopefully
 
00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:03.899 align:start position:0%
um let me just
 
00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:05.820 align:start position:0%
make sure yeah
 
00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:10.200 align:start position:0%
um an expert that is uh I welcome to uh
 
00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
talk about it this issue in more detail
 
00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
his name is Scott Yates if you would be
 
00:12:18.889 --> 00:12:18.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:22.009 --> 00:12:22.019 align:start position:0%
to to talk to the more more uh intricate
 
00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
details of the studies and stuff like
 
00:12:26.569 --> 00:12:26.579 align:start position:0%
that but I would be happy to um
 
00:12:29.449 --> 00:12:29.459 align:start position:0%
entertain like more general questions if
 
00:12:36.769 --> 00:12:36.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:39.420 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
um just looking through the
 
00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:45.180 align:start position:0%
latter part of the bill the 24-25 area
 
00:12:47.269 --> 00:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
line you reference made in Massachusetts
 
00:12:48.889 --> 00:12:48.899 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that Rhode Island
 
00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
has also entered into a metoo clause
 
00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:56.220 align:start position:0%
in the event that Boston chooses to go
 
00:12:59.750 --> 00:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
to the Atlantic time zone as well am I
 
00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:02.220 align:start position:0%
correct in that
 
00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question
 
00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
um yes so this kind of
 
00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:11.220 align:start position:0%
um a bunch of states have
 
00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
um similar bills with similar
 
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
contingencies and so kind of like main
 
00:13:20.269 --> 00:13:20.279 align:start position:0%
uh it currently doesn't have a bill but
 
00:13:23.329 --> 00:13:23.339 align:start position:0%
if Maine had one before they were
 
00:13:26.329 --> 00:13:26.339 align:start position:0%
contingent on New Hampshire and New
 
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was contingent on
 
00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and Rhode Island is
 
00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:31.279 align:start position:0%
contingent on Connecticut
 
00:13:33.889 --> 00:13:33.899 align:start position:0%
and Connecticut is contingent on
 
00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:37.500 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and and uh
 
00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:40.860 align:start position:0%
and uh New York now and so it kind of
 
00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
just creates a kind of rolling effect of
 
00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
we need a bigger and bigger block
 
00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:50.360 align:start position:0%
um before it actually goes into effect
 
00:13:53.449 --> 00:13:53.459 align:start position:0%
but once it happens pretty much the
 
00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
whole region is going to go at the same
 
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
time and
 
00:13:59.629 --> 00:13:59.639 align:start position:0%
um so for those reasons that's why I
 
00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:02.519 align:start position:0%
would be more I would be open to
 
00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
um larger blocks per pose potentially by
 
00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
a broadcasters Association so thank you
 
00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:12.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:12.829 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:14:12.829 --> 00:14:12.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:15.540 align:start position:0%
is Connecticut actually considering uh
 
00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:17.519 align:start position:0%
changing because I wouldn't expect them
 
00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:20.100 align:start position:0%
to move from different time zone to New
 
00:14:21.829 --> 00:14:21.839 align:start position:0%
York City given the number of people in
 
00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question they actually
 
00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:28.820 align:start position:0%
have two bills
 
00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:33.540 align:start position:0%
uh this time uh this session for that
 
00:14:37.009 --> 00:14:37.019 align:start position:0%
exact uh this exact language and they
 
00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:40.260 align:start position:0%
are contingent on New York last time uh
 
00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:42.180 align:start position:0%
they had a bill that wasn't contingent
 
00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:43.500 align:start position:0%
on New York and they added that
 
00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
contingency so the bill currently in uh
 
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:50.940 align:start position:0%
Connecticut well both of the bills are
 
00:14:53.269 --> 00:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
contingent on New York so if that bill
 
00:14:56.689 --> 00:14:56.699 align:start position:0%
passes and New York is also considering
 
00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:00.660 align:start position:0%
the same it the same uh Bill and their
 
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
contingent on New Jersey and so it's
 
00:15:07.389 --> 00:15:07.399 align:start position:0%
it's a cascading effect
 
00:15:11.449 --> 00:15:11.459 align:start position:0%
yes thank you I I think we should uh
 
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
just keep it with Massachusetts in Maine
 
00:15:16.129 --> 00:15:16.139 align:start position:0%
and let New York deal with its own
 
00:15:16.139 --> 00:15:17.389 align:start position:0%
and let New York deal with its own
problems

00:15:17.389 --> 00:15:17.399 align:start position:0%
problems
 
00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:19.620 align:start position:0%
all right uh
 
00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:20.750 align:start position:0%
all right uh
I

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:15:23.269 --> 00:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:27.540 align:start position:0%
see uh Madam chair if I may fine yes
 
00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
please representative yes thank you
 
00:15:32.269 --> 00:15:32.279 align:start position:0%
madam chair uh thank you representative
 
00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
for taking the question uh we all kind
 
00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
of live through the Y2K and nothing
 
00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:40.620 align:start position:0%
really happened but I would like you to
 
00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
speak about the economic impact uh with
 
00:15:46.069 --> 00:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
computers and everything else when you
 
00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:49.320 align:start position:0%
uh purchase new electronic equipment it
 
00:15:51.829 --> 00:15:51.839 align:start position:0%
has you designate which type of time
 
00:15:55.009 --> 00:15:55.019 align:start position:0%
zone that you're in and uh would that
 
00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
affect any type of uh uh problems with
 
00:16:00.889 --> 00:16:00.899 align:start position:0%
the electronic devices that could have
 
00:16:03.889 --> 00:16:03.899 align:start position:0%
an economical impact on the economy that
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
you anticipate with this
 
00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
um so as you alluded to there is just a
 
00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:15.720 align:start position:0%
switch that that um computers have to
 
00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:17.820 align:start position:0%
designate which time zone that you're in
 
00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:19.740 align:start position:0%
it automatically
 
00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:21.540 align:start position:0%
um is
 
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
going to go forward correct from that
 
00:16:27.009 --> 00:16:27.019 align:start position:0%
time on once you select that time zone
 
00:16:29.509 --> 00:16:29.519 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
it would be a one-time cost up front I
 
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
guess and then however the in the uh
 
00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:39.300 align:start position:0%
special commission report they found
 
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
that it was the benefits were greatly
 
00:16:49.009 --> 00:16:49.019 align:start position:0%
outweighed the cost because it uh they
 
00:16:50.689 --> 00:16:50.699 align:start position:0%
found that people are much more likely
 
00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
to go shopping after work if it's still
 
00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:56.820 align:start position:0%
light and so uh there would just be an
 
00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:00.420 align:start position:0%
increased economic uh incentive during
 
00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:02.940 align:start position:0%
the winter months in in New Hampshire
 
00:17:06.409 --> 00:17:06.419 align:start position:0%
and in this region and so those would
 
00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
greatly outweigh the one-time costs of
 
00:17:10.669 --> 00:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
switching to a different time zone on
 
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
your computer so thank you for the
 
00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:14.579 align:start position:0%
question thank you representative
 
00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:19.010 align:start position:0%
question thank you representative
representative

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:21.309 --> 00:17:21.319 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:17:23.929 --> 00:17:23.939 align:start position:0%
if this bill was enacted in
 
00:17:26.090 --> 00:17:26.100 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and Maine went along what
 
00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:32.840 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:41.480 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up thank you
 
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
have that are outside of New England
 
00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
have this
 
00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:53.990 align:start position:0%
have this
regulation

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
what what excuse me what do you mean by
 
00:17:59.690 --> 00:17:59.700 align:start position:0%
regulation well this I'm sorry are not
 
00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:02.820 align:start position:0%
are not using this time zone now let's
 
00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:05.100 align:start position:0%
say about our mother States on Atlantic
 
00:18:09.289 --> 00:18:09.299 align:start position:0%
time at the moment it's uh parts of
 
00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:13.140 align:start position:0%
Canada are yeah okay yeah
 
00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question currently
 
00:18:21.289 --> 00:18:21.299 align:start position:0%
um the only place in New in uh
 
00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:26.340 align:start position:0%
in uh the United States that that uh
 
00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:28.740 align:start position:0%
does not exha that would be on the same
 
00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:30.660 align:start position:0%
time zone currently
 
00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:32.510 align:start position:0%
time zone currently
is

00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:33.770 align:start position:0%
is
um

00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:33.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:37.140 align:start position:0%
Puerto Rico that I know of
 
00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
but there may be there may be others
 
00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:41.029 align:start position:0%
but there may be there may be others
other

00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:41.039 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
um districts that
 
00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:46.980 align:start position:0%
that would be covered under this but uh
 
00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
they're as far as other states that are
 
00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:51.900 align:start position:0%
considering this option there is a lot
 
00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
of them and
 
00:18:57.010 --> 00:18:57.020 align:start position:0%
um Scott Yates may be able to
 
00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:00.900 align:start position:0%
more fully address how many people are
 
00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:02.220 align:start position:0%
considering this option versus
 
00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
considering the option of moving to
 
00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
Daylight Savings time all year round and
 
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
waiting for congress versus other other
 
00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
options that are proposed to address the
 
00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:14.340 align:start position:0%
issue of the time switching
 
00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:16.740 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:20.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
00:19:24.529 --> 00:19:24.539 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh the bill states that within 180 days
 
00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:29.220 align:start position:0%
of similar actions between Maine and
 
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts that the governor shall
 
00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:33.480 align:start position:0%
petition the United States Secretary of
 
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
Transportation to move to the Atlantic
 
00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:36.780 align:start position:0%
time zone
 
00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:40.280 align:start position:0%
is he uh is he secretary
 
00:19:42.529 --> 00:19:42.539 align:start position:0%
obliged to
 
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:53.400 align:start position:0%
so it's a shell so it would be required
 
00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
that he submit the application uh the
 
00:19:59.029 --> 00:19:59.039 align:start position:0%
there would be hearings on the cost
 
00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:03.660 align:start position:0%
benefits and people would testify to
 
00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:05.210 align:start position:0%
benefits and people would testify to
um the

00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:05.220 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:08.340 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of Transportation it
 
00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be uh we wouldn't be going to
 
00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:11.940 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State in New Hampshire
 
00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
for another
 
00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:16.200 align:start position:0%
um discussion on whether or not he
 
00:20:18.289 --> 00:20:18.299 align:start position:0%
should apply if the legislature tells
 
00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:20.580 align:start position:0%
them to apply then he would apply
 
00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up
 
00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:25.980 align:start position:0%
but the U.S Secretary of Transportation
 
00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:29.460 align:start position:0%
could deny this petition correct
 
00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:31.980 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for the question
 
00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:35.220 align:start position:0%
um yes it's potent if it was
 
00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:37.010 align:start position:0%
um yes it's potent if it was
unreasonable

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
unreasonable
 
00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:38.820 align:start position:0%
um you know there's there's
 
00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:40.260 align:start position:0%
um things that they might consider
 
00:20:43.789 --> 00:20:43.799 align:start position:0%
there's strong evidence that shows that
 
00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
um that there is good reason to and so
 
00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
it's unlikely that they would would deny
 
00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:50.820 align:start position:0%
it but it's possible yes absolutely
 
00:20:54.049 --> 00:20:54.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:57.950 --> 00:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
hi can you hear me yes no problems
 
00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
thanks and I'm
 
00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
coming at from two angles
 
00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:08.940 align:start position:0%
um representative Ocala isn't it correct
 
00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
that the Department of Transportation
 
00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:14.460 align:start position:0%
has very specific standards about how
 
00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:16.020 align:start position:0%
they would
 
00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:18.900 align:start position:0%
um decide on making a time zone change
 
00:21:21.169 --> 00:21:21.179 align:start position:0%
and doesn't it deal primarily with
 
00:21:21.179 --> 00:21:25.810 align:start position:0%
and doesn't it deal primarily with
transportation

00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:25.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:28.549 --> 00:21:28.559 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
they would consider a wide range of
 
00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
things but yes obviously it goes with
 
00:21:36.049 --> 00:21:36.059 align:start position:0%
their name that their main concern is
 
00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:42.850 align:start position:0%
and follow-up please follow up
 
00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:44.570 align:start position:0%
and follow-up please follow up
[Music]

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:44.580 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
uh the other issue is
 
00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:52.140 align:start position:0%
um I I read the report from the main
 
00:21:54.789 --> 00:21:54.799 align:start position:0%
study commission and that was in 2017
 
00:21:56.810 --> 00:21:56.820 align:start position:0%
and they have
 
00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
um yet to enact anything in Maine I'm
 
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
wondering if you can give us some
 
00:22:04.549 --> 00:22:04.559 align:start position:0%
history on this proposal to take change
 
00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
time zones my understanding has been
 
00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
going on for a number of years in
 
00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:16.140 align:start position:0%
multiple States and the U.S Department
 
00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
of Transport Commerce or whoever makes
 
00:22:21.649 --> 00:22:21.659 align:start position:0%
that decision has yet to approve any of
 
00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
those time zone changes
 
00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:26.940 align:start position:0%
that's the end of my question thanks
 
00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:29.100 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so there
 
00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:32.460 align:start position:0%
hasn't been any requests to the um
 
00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:35.460 align:start position:0%
uh Secretary of Transportation to switch
 
00:22:37.669 --> 00:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
so there would be no denying or
 
00:22:37.679 --> 00:22:39.529 align:start position:0%
so there would be no denying or
accepting

00:22:39.529 --> 00:22:39.539 align:start position:0%
accepting
 
00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
um at this state this idea of switching
 
00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:46.380 align:start position:0%
to Atlantic time zone is relatively new
 
00:22:49.789 --> 00:22:49.799 align:start position:0%
the the previous efforts were to just
 
00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:52.020 align:start position:0%
accept daylight savings time all year
 
00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:52.990 align:start position:0%
accept daylight savings time all year
around

00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:53.000 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:55.980 align:start position:0%
and wait for the con for Congress to
 
00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
allow that and so but uh I've only been
 
00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:02.280 align:start position:0%
um obviously I've only been in the
 
00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
legislature this is my second term and
 
00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.750 align:start position:0%
legislature this is my second term and
so

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:08.940 align:start position:0%
um Scott Yates would be able to to uh
 
00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:12.780 align:start position:0%
follow up more with the history and all
 
00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:14.820 align:start position:0%
the different states many states propose
 
00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:15.830 align:start position:0%
the different states many states propose
it

00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:17.940 align:start position:0%
um you know Maine right now is is
 
00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
suggesting to create their own study
 
00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:23.460 align:start position:0%
and I talked with the representative
 
00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
there and they're talking about
 
00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
potentially just uh putting in a bill to
 
00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:31.260 align:start position:0%
go with no contingencies no no other
 
00:23:33.649 --> 00:23:33.659 align:start position:0%
state contingencies but we'll find out
 
00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
what their their study finds if they end
 
00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
up passing that legislation so
 
00:23:42.529 --> 00:23:42.539 align:start position:0%
it's there are many there are many
 
00:23:45.289 --> 00:23:45.299 align:start position:0%
solutions being being floated but I
 
00:23:48.409 --> 00:23:48.419 align:start position:0%
don't I don't uh agree that that the
 
00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:50.820 align:start position:0%
state uh
 
00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:53.220 align:start position:0%
of TR the Secretary of Transportation
 
00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
has denied any requests for this this
 
00:23:58.909 --> 00:23:58.919 align:start position:0%
change because I don't believe it is
 
00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
um has passed and been
 
00:24:03.529 --> 00:24:03.539 align:start position:0%
uh requested of them to to change that
 
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question
 
00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:08.340 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Keller
 
00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
unmuted and he can even see me it's a
 
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
good thing I put on a tie for this so my
 
00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:22.860 align:start position:0%
name is Timothy Horrigan I'm
 
00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:25.140 align:start position:0%
I'm representing Stratford County's
 
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
District Six which is the towns of
 
00:24:30.049 --> 00:24:30.059 align:start position:0%
Durham and Madbury and I actually back
 
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
in 2011 I sponsored the bill that
 
00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:35.100 align:start position:0%
created the that made the current
 
00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:37.140 align:start position:0%
statute about daylight savings time and
 
00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:39.720 align:start position:0%
I was just uh making the definition of
 
00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:41.220 align:start position:0%
state laws the same as that in federal
 
00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:43.740 align:start position:0%
law which uh which was something that
 
00:24:45.409 --> 00:24:45.419 align:start position:0%
could have caused some confusion but it
 
00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:47.700 align:start position:0%
didn't but it could have so um we
 
00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh
 
00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:50.700 align:start position:0%
I mentioned from Durham I was actually
 
00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:52.380 align:start position:0%
born in South Bend Indiana the hometown
 
00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
of the current uh Secretary of
 
00:24:57.649 --> 00:24:57.659 align:start position:0%
Transportation Buddha judge in fact he
 
00:24:59.750 --> 00:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
lives in uh the same neighborhood where
 
00:25:01.549 --> 00:25:01.559 align:start position:0%
I spent part of my childhood except I'm
 
00:25:03.289 --> 00:25:03.299 align:start position:0%
slightly older as you can tell by the
 
00:25:04.549 --> 00:25:04.559 align:start position:0%
color of my hair
 
00:25:06.049 --> 00:25:06.059 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:07.860 align:start position:0%
this reason the Department of
 
00:25:09.289 --> 00:25:09.299 align:start position:0%
Transportation is in charge of time
 
00:25:10.549 --> 00:25:10.559 align:start position:0%
zones is because this was originally
 
00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
became necessary when we built the
 
00:25:15.649 --> 00:25:15.659 align:start position:0%
railroad Network so it caused huge
 
00:25:15.659 --> 00:25:16.490 align:start position:0%
railroad Network so it caused huge
um

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:16.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:18.649 --> 00:25:18.659 align:start position:0%
where that people cities were just
 
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
operating on them on you know solar time
 
00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:23.460 align:start position:0%
by where the sun is but um once we had
 
00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:25.380 align:start position:0%
railroads going we needed to get
 
00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:26.940 align:start position:0%
everybody in sync and so that's why they
 
00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:28.520 align:start position:0%
have the time zones they're not
 
00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:31.020 align:start position:0%
perfectly aligned with longitude it is
 
00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
true that we're here in New Hampshire
 
00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:34.500 align:start position:0%
we're about to north of Puerto Rico
 
00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:36.200 align:start position:0%
which is on the Atlantic Standard Time
 
00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:38.700 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:40.500 align:start position:0%
that would probably cause some confusion
 
00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:41.940 align:start position:0%
so one of the political issues probably
 
00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:43.980 align:start position:0%
we should wait on this before we make
 
00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:45.480 align:start position:0%
this change to see if Puerto Rico
 
00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:47.340 align:start position:0%
becomes a state which seems to be more
 
00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:49.020 align:start position:0%
probable now than it has in the past
 
00:25:51.649 --> 00:25:51.659 align:start position:0%
although that like daylight savings time
 
00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:53.400 align:start position:0%
has been kicked around for years so get
 
00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:55.020 align:start position:0%
back to South Bend it has to be in the
 
00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:57.240 align:start position:0%
Northwestern corner of the state near
 
00:25:59.090 --> 00:25:59.100 align:start position:0%
Chicago and that part of Indiana is
 
00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:00.590 align:start position:0%
Chicago and that part of Indiana is
along

00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
along
 
00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
history confusion of a controversy and
 
00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
confusion over daylight savings time in
 
00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:08.100 align:start position:0%
fact I have two birthdays because of
 
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
that because like my mother
 
00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:13.380 align:start position:0%
uh South Bend I think was operating on
 
00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
um representative yes so anyway get back
 
00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:19.400 align:start position:0%
to the point in the hand um
 
00:26:22.909 --> 00:26:22.919 align:start position:0%
it's an arbitrary thing I've gone
 
00:26:22.919 --> 00:26:23.750 align:start position:0%
it's an arbitrary thing I've gone
um

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:25.549 --> 00:26:25.559 align:start position:0%
Cameron arbitring what we call these
 
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
time zones where we draw the lines in
 
00:26:29.149 --> 00:26:29.159 align:start position:0%
the map but I think it's uh
 
00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:31.740 align:start position:0%
simplest thing to do is keep with the
 
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
current practice even though
 
00:26:36.049 --> 00:26:36.059 align:start position:0%
switching it's not an ideal thing
 
00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:38.820 align:start position:0%
switching time zones uh twice a year and
 
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
it does cause some problems but I think
 
00:26:42.909 --> 00:26:42.919 align:start position:0%
it would cause even more problems if we
 
00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:46.440 align:start position:0%
uh went on a time zone that normally
 
00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
which now is used only in Puerto Rico
 
00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:51.240 align:start position:0%
the Virgin Islands so I would say uh
 
00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:52.980 align:start position:0%
I would say even though there's a lot of
 
00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
a larger calories a lot you'll create
 
00:26:56.810 --> 00:26:56.820 align:start position:0%
less confusion to keep things where they
 
00:26:59.390 --> 00:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
are and um so that is to
 
00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:01.500 align:start position:0%
also a simpler way if we do want to be
 
00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:03.240 align:start position:0%
in the same time zone year round with
 
00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:05.340 align:start position:0%
Maine Massachusetts or whatever Rhode
 
00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
Island whatever States want to be it
 
00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
tell us in terms of the label we put on
 
00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:09.830 align:start position:0%
tell us in terms of the label we put on
it

00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:12.360 align:start position:0%
would probably just be easier to go to
 
00:27:14.149 --> 00:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
Daylight Savings Time year round just
 
00:27:15.409 --> 00:27:15.419 align:start position:0%
because um
 
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
there are some people who don't go to
 
00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
Canada or Puerto Rico very much you
 
00:27:20.149 --> 00:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
don't really know what Atlantic Standard
 
00:27:22.669 --> 00:27:22.679 align:start position:0%
time is so eastern daylight time is the
 
00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:25.980 align:start position:0%
same time zone as uh as a Atlantic
 
00:27:27.769 --> 00:27:27.779 align:start position:0%
Standard time so that would be simple
 
00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:29.460 align:start position:0%
solution even though it does require an
 
00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
act of Congress that would probably be
 
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
simpler than you know what we have
 
00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:38.220 align:start position:0%
you know 90. questions
 
00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
well thank you
 
00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:53.400 align:start position:0%
you have a question
 
00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:59.330 align:start position:0%
you have a question
absolutely

00:27:59.330 --> 00:27:59.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:02.149 --> 00:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
looks like he's muted yes you're muted
 
00:28:04.789 --> 00:28:04.799 align:start position:0%
representative Judy
 
00:28:08.029 --> 00:28:08.039 align:start position:0%
okay what about now that's better thank
 
00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:11.100 align:start position:0%
you please ask your question yes
 
00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:13.880 align:start position:0%
um Madame chair please could you please
 
00:28:15.649 --> 00:28:15.659 align:start position:0%
reminding me
 
00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:19.140 align:start position:0%
we have a similar Bill uh a couple years
 
00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:23.460 align:start position:0%
ago or two years ago uh what is the
 
00:28:27.769 --> 00:28:27.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:27.779 --> 00:28:31.210 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:31.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:33.960 align:start position:0%
yeah I just say this is a perennial
 
00:28:37.669 --> 00:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
issue it's it's uh it was not new
 
00:28:39.409 --> 00:28:39.419 align:start position:0%
um when I worked on the way back 10
 
00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:40.500 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
00:28:43.789 --> 00:28:43.799 align:start position:0%
um and uh it's been kicking around for a
 
00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:45.900 align:start position:0%
while and maybe someday we'll pass a
 
00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:48.740 align:start position:0%
bill maybe not you know as Revenue
 
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:51.240 align:start position:0%
correctly point out it depends on a lot
 
00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
of other what happens in other states
 
00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:55.620 align:start position:0%
and federally and so forth it's like
 
00:28:58.310 --> 00:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
it's a perennial build so that's why so
 
00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:00.900 align:start position:0%
every two years or so um it comes up
 
00:29:03.529 --> 00:29:03.539 align:start position:0%
again so here it is so
 
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Allegro yes
 
00:29:08.149 --> 00:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I I
 
00:29:09.769 --> 00:29:09.779 align:start position:0%
thought I understand this but something
 
00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:11.580 align:start position:0%
that was just said confused me a little
 
00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:12.900 align:start position:0%
bit and I just want to make sure I'm 100
 
00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:14.590 align:start position:0%
bit and I just want to make sure I'm 100
clear

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:14.600 align:start position:0%
clear
 
00:29:18.529 --> 00:29:18.539 align:start position:0%
the idea was that we're uh we might be
 
00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:20.820 align:start position:0%
switching to a system used only in
 
00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:22.820 align:start position:0%
Puerto Rico and Eastern Canada
 
00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that if this is
 
00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:28.620 align:start position:0%
enacted it will be only when a chunk of
 
00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:31.020 align:start position:0%
the Eastern yeah
 
00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
uh Seaboard yes okay thank you yeah
 
00:29:39.169 --> 00:29:39.179 align:start position:0%
thank you very much currently
 
00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:41.820 align:start position:0%
currently the Atlantic time zone is a
 
00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
time zone in Eastern Canada Puerto Rico
 
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
and the Virgin Islands ends then
 
00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:50.100 align:start position:0%
obviously going south so um
 
00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:51.049 align:start position:0%
obviously going south so um
yeah

00:29:51.049 --> 00:29:51.059 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:53.820 align:start position:0%
yeah it is required that's uh will
 
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
require like action from other states
 
00:29:57.409 --> 00:29:57.419 align:start position:0%
and possibly even the Canadian provinces
 
00:29:59.810 --> 00:29:59.820 align:start position:0%
and so forth so
 
00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative
 
00:30:02.159 --> 00:30:05.750 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative
Schultz

00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:07.669 --> 00:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:30:07.679 --> 00:30:09.049 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

00:30:09.049 --> 00:30:09.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:12.169 --> 00:30:12.179 align:start position:0%
I am very excited to speak about this
 
00:30:15.049 --> 00:30:15.059 align:start position:0%
bill as a co-sponsor that is it is a
 
00:30:18.169 --> 00:30:18.179 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan topic that I care about
 
00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:20.700 align:start position:0%
deeply and for those of you on the
 
00:30:23.149 --> 00:30:23.159 align:start position:0%
committee may remember I care about it
 
00:30:25.789 --> 00:30:25.799 align:start position:0%
so much two years ago that I decided to
 
00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:29.100 align:start position:0%
to as and I wasn't a co-sponsor that I
 
00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:31.020 align:start position:0%
signed in to speak after hearing all
 
00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:34.020 align:start position:0%
your questions and here's why there's a
 
00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:37.380 align:start position:0%
handful of reasons why first of all
 
00:30:41.389 --> 00:30:41.399 align:start position:0%
uh the amount of car accidents and work
 
00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:43.980 align:start position:0%
incidents accidents that happen because
 
00:30:46.389 --> 00:30:46.399 align:start position:0%
of daylight savings in the time switch
 
00:30:50.029 --> 00:30:50.039 align:start position:0%
is statistically significant the number
 
00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:53.820 align:start position:0%
of heart attacks goes up 24 on the
 
00:30:57.649 --> 00:30:57.659 align:start position:0%
Monday after the time change and there
 
00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
is even a an increase in the number of
 
00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:03.480 align:start position:0%
strokes and a temporary increase in the
 
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
number of suicides because as sleep
 
00:31:10.549 --> 00:31:10.559 align:start position:0%
researchers have determined even an hour
 
00:31:10.559 --> 00:31:12.710 align:start position:0%
researchers have determined even an hour
change

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:15.380 align:start position:0%
um in your sleep disturbance
 
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
quoting Matthew Walker a sleep
 
00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
researcher that's how fragile and
 
00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:22.980 align:start position:0%
susceptible your body is to even just
 
00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:25.260 align:start position:0%
one hour of lost sleep
 
00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:28.140 align:start position:0%
and I know this personally because I
 
00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:29.700 align:start position:0%
actually am someone who is very
 
00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
sensitive to issues around sleep I have
 
00:31:35.389 --> 00:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
an autoimmune disorder that one of the
 
00:31:39.909 --> 00:31:39.919 align:start position:0%
symptoms is an issue with sleep
 
00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
consistency of sleep is very important
 
00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:45.480 align:start position:0%
to maintaining my personal health
 
00:31:47.149 --> 00:31:47.159 align:start position:0%
can you hear me okay
 
00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:49.620 align:start position:0%
now we can do it sorry I heard an
 
00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:51.720 align:start position:0%
interruption I apologize
 
00:31:54.289 --> 00:31:54.299 align:start position:0%
um I'll continue I also
 
00:31:57.470 --> 00:31:57.480 align:start position:0%
um suffer from seasonal depression and
 
00:31:59.810 --> 00:31:59.820 align:start position:0%
am very happy to show you my light box
 
00:32:02.269 --> 00:32:02.279 align:start position:0%
since I'm next to it
 
00:32:06.889 --> 00:32:06.899 align:start position:0%
um and I know that many people in your
 
00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:08.940 align:start position:0%
districts if you ask them about this
 
00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
very much would like to get rid of the
 
00:32:15.529 --> 00:32:15.539 align:start position:0%
time change issue it is very disruptive
 
00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
um another issue that I remember being
 
00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
raised that compelled me to testify last
 
00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:22.620 align:start position:0%
time and I'm excited to co-sponsor is
 
00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:25.740 align:start position:0%
because of the confusion that people
 
00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:29.220 align:start position:0%
assume will happen if this passes and
 
00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
the group of states a block of States
 
00:32:36.409 --> 00:32:36.419 align:start position:0%
decide to ditch the time change and I
 
00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:38.700 align:start position:0%
wanted to reassure you and I think this
 
00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
is something that representative
 
00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
Corrigan was trying to point out that I
 
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
grew up on the westernmost boundary of
 
00:32:46.789 --> 00:32:46.799 align:start position:0%
the Eastern Time Zone in Louisville
 
00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:49.380 align:start position:0%
Kentucky Kentucky and just 45 minutes
 
00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:53.460 align:start position:0%
south of us was the time change and a
 
00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
whole section of uh the viewing audience
 
00:32:59.269 --> 00:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
for the Louisville media Market actually
 
00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:02.100 align:start position:0%
included this time change so everything
 
00:33:05.169 --> 00:33:05.179 align:start position:0%
everything on television was announced
 
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh Eastern and Central Time both times
 
00:33:12.409 --> 00:33:12.419 align:start position:0%
were listed in everything
 
00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:14.220 align:start position:0%
um and it really wasn't a big deal maybe
 
00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:16.559 align:start position:0%
because I was raised with it but many
 
00:33:21.409 --> 00:33:21.419 align:start position:0%
people live near a time zone change and
 
00:33:24.769 --> 00:33:24.779 align:start position:0%
quite a few States actually have two
 
00:33:26.509 --> 00:33:26.519 align:start position:0%
different time zones in their own State
 
00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:28.440 align:start position:0%
like Kentucky does Tennessee does and
 
00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:31.740 align:start position:0%
many others and it really is not a big
 
00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:35.640 align:start position:0%
deal to have a time zone change near you
 
00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
it is just a matter and fact of a way of
 
00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:40.009 align:start position:0%
it is just a matter and fact of a way of
life

00:33:40.009 --> 00:33:40.019 align:start position:0%
life
 
00:33:42.649 --> 00:33:42.659 align:start position:0%
uh you just know when you're driving
 
00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
South towards Fort Knox that the time is
 
00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:49.260 align:start position:0%
going to change and it is just a matter
 
00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
of fact of living just like it is when
 
00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:52.980 align:start position:0%
you know that the time is going to
 
00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
change here but with none of the uh car
 
00:33:59.870 --> 00:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
accidents and heart attacks that happen
 
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
because of the two times of changes in
 
00:34:06.169 --> 00:34:06.179 align:start position:0%
um in those issues I also want to point
 
00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
out that there's a lot of myths around
 
00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:11.580 align:start position:0%
why we even have daylight savings uh
 
00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:14.280 align:start position:0%
changes I will send a video out again
 
00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:17.580 align:start position:0%
that I sent I think two years ago
 
00:34:20.930 --> 00:34:20.940 align:start position:0%
um that sort of humorously portrays the
 
00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:24.540 align:start position:0%
myths of why we do it it has only been
 
00:34:26.450 --> 00:34:26.460 align:start position:0%
about a hundred years that we've been
 
00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:29.700 align:start position:0%
doing it and it was inspired by a change
 
00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:34.020 align:start position:0%
that Germany made I think in 1918 but
 
00:34:35.290 --> 00:34:35.300 align:start position:0%
um really
 
00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:39.780 align:start position:0%
uh having the two times a year of time
 
00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:43.020 align:start position:0%
change is very disruptive and most
 
00:34:46.629 --> 00:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
people hate it and I I think it's only
 
00:34:50.290 --> 00:34:50.300 align:start position:0%
an excess of questions and an in an
 
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
inability to accept change is the only
 
00:34:54.770 --> 00:34:54.780 align:start position:0%
reason why we haven't ditched it already
 
00:34:58.970 --> 00:34:58.980 align:start position:0%
when it is so universally despised so I
 
00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
hope that we will gain non-partisan
 
00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:03.660 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support however you want to
 
00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
look at that that and if you are
 
00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:08.700 align:start position:0%
concerned about this issue I just
 
00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
encourage you to talk to your
 
00:35:13.069 --> 00:35:13.079 align:start position:0%
constituents and I especially hope my
 
00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
fellow Democrats will ask me any
 
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
questions and concerns that you may have
 
00:35:19.609 --> 00:35:19.619 align:start position:0%
I know we've continued to talk about
 
00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:21.420 align:start position:0%
this bill for the two years since we
 
00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:24.180 align:start position:0%
last heard it so bring them on
 
00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:27.420 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Schiltz I would
 
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
also like to point out that it's not
 
00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:30.780 align:start position:0%
just humans that have a problem with
 
00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:31.490 align:start position:0%
just humans that have a problem with
this

00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:31.500 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:35:33.829 --> 00:35:33.839 align:start position:0%
um the body clock of my pugs when it's
 
00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
time to eat you could almost sit your
 
00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:37.320 align:start position:0%
watch too
 
00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
many questions for representative
 
00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
Schultz on her testimony
 
00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:48.109 align:start position:0%
Schultz on her testimony
Representatives

00:35:48.109 --> 00:35:48.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
00:35:52.490 --> 00:35:52.500 align:start position:0%
um good morning representative Schultz
 
00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:57.890 --> 00:35:57.900 align:start position:0%
I am
 
00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:01.260 align:start position:0%
listening to your testimony and it seems
 
00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
that the basic thrust of all of the
 
00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:07.380 align:start position:0%
problems that you mentioned uh health
 
00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
issues accidents and so forth are a
 
00:36:14.650 --> 00:36:14.660 align:start position:0%
result of Changing Times
 
00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh not a specific time in a big Zone
 
00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:23.700 align:start position:0%
and would that not be true
 
00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
it is the diff the difficulty comes in
 
00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:29.640 align:start position:0%
the springing forward and the falling
 
00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:32.220 align:start position:0%
back two times a year I hope I wasn't
 
00:36:34.609 --> 00:36:34.619 align:start position:0%
confusing in comparing the two different
 
00:36:37.310 --> 00:36:37.320 align:start position:0%
there's two sets of concerns that I
 
00:36:39.650 --> 00:36:39.660 align:start position:0%
remember hearing before so I just want
 
00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:42.180 align:start position:0%
to make sure I'm clear about them to
 
00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:45.180 align:start position:0%
live in a specific time zone and have
 
00:36:47.450 --> 00:36:47.460 align:start position:0%
the spring forward and fall back that
 
00:36:50.569 --> 00:36:50.579 align:start position:0%
the time changes require creates a
 
00:36:53.210 --> 00:36:53.220 align:start position:0%
physical difficulty that's one specific
 
00:36:56.589 --> 00:36:56.599 align:start position:0%
concern and that is what causes the
 
00:36:59.030 --> 00:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
temporary raise in the number of heart
 
00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:02.460 align:start position:0%
attacks suicides work accidents and car
 
00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:05.700 align:start position:0%
accidents the other concern I was maybe
 
00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:09.720 align:start position:0%
I I hope I was clear is that you know
 
00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:12.060 align:start position:0%
there were concerns around where the
 
00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:14.220 align:start position:0%
boundaries of a time zone change might
 
00:37:17.329 --> 00:37:17.339 align:start position:0%
be and the concerns about New Hampshire
 
00:37:20.569 --> 00:37:20.579 align:start position:0%
potentially having one on our western
 
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
border and the concerns that I was
 
00:37:26.329 --> 00:37:26.339 align:start position:0%
addressing in that regard was just the
 
00:37:29.050 --> 00:37:29.060 align:start position:0%
matter of factness it was
 
00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
to live near a time zone change so
 
00:37:35.810 --> 00:37:35.820 align:start position:0%
there's significant differences uh and
 
00:37:39.349 --> 00:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
difficulties raised by experiencing the
 
00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:41.880 align:start position:0%
time zone you live in changing two times
 
00:37:44.329 --> 00:37:44.339 align:start position:0%
a year and the desire to ditch that is
 
00:37:48.170 --> 00:37:48.180 align:start position:0%
huge and living near a time zone
 
00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:52.260 align:start position:0%
boundary is really not a big deal those
 
00:37:55.069 --> 00:37:55.079 align:start position:0%
are two very distinct issues so to
 
00:37:58.250 --> 00:37:58.260 align:start position:0%
switch to what is Atlantic time to then
 
00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:00.300 align:start position:0%
adopt what we have eight months of the
 
00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:03.540 align:start position:0%
year with daylight savings so it'd be
 
00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
adopting what we have during daylight
 
00:38:09.109 --> 00:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
savings and ditching where we are now to
 
00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
get rid of that time change two times a
 
00:38:14.329 --> 00:38:14.339 align:start position:0%
year uh the phys that would be a
 
00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:17.940 align:start position:0%
physical relief for many people and
 
00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
um that is the difficulty the difficulty
 
00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:23.400 align:start position:0%
living near a time zone boundary is no
 
00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:27.420 align:start position:0%
big deal does that help
 
00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
I think so
 
00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
um that was going to lead to a follow-up
 
00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
question sure
 
00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:36.660 align:start position:0%
um well I'm is that all right Mr chair
 
00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
all right with me
 
00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
good thank you
 
00:38:43.370 --> 00:38:43.380 align:start position:0%
um and that would be that from what we
 
00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:47.460 align:start position:0%
have heard uh Vermont is not how shall I
 
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
say on board with this program is that
 
00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:51.780 align:start position:0%
not true
 
00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
I believe that is how the bill is
 
00:38:55.970 --> 00:38:55.980 align:start position:0%
written and I and I that the questions
 
00:38:59.150 --> 00:38:59.160 align:start position:0%
about Vermont is why I felt it important
 
00:39:01.490 --> 00:39:01.500 align:start position:0%
to explain what it was like growing up
 
00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:04.380 align:start position:0%
near a Time boundary uh you know a time
 
00:39:06.770 --> 00:39:06.780 align:start position:0%
zone boundary
 
00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
um this would move us to the a
 
00:39:11.829 --> 00:39:11.839 align:start position:0%
westernmost point of the Atlantic time
 
00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:15.240 align:start position:0%
change and having grown up at the
 
00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:18.300 align:start position:0%
westernmost point of the
 
00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
um Eastern Time Zone to Central Time
 
00:39:23.089 --> 00:39:23.099 align:start position:0%
Zone was really no big deal
 
00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:25.740 align:start position:0%
the difficulty and the desire to create
 
00:39:29.690 --> 00:39:29.700 align:start position:0%
this change is in the actual switching
 
00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:33.240 align:start position:0%
of our existing time from daylight
 
00:39:36.349 --> 00:39:36.359 align:start position:0%
savings to daylight standard and then
 
00:39:40.130 --> 00:39:40.140 align:start position:0%
daylight standard to Daylight Savings
 
00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:40.849 align:start position:0%
daylight standard to Daylight Savings
um

00:39:40.849 --> 00:39:40.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:43.500 align:start position:0%
everyone would just know if this passes
 
00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
in the other states adopt it and a block
 
00:39:50.210 --> 00:39:50.220 align:start position:0%
of States then adopt Atlantic time you
 
00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:52.500 align:start position:0%
would just know Vermont is in Eastern
 
00:39:54.530 --> 00:39:54.540 align:start position:0%
time and
 
00:39:56.750 --> 00:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
um there would be signs at the border if
 
00:39:58.730 --> 00:39:58.740 align:start position:0%
you didn't know but everyone would just
 
00:40:01.609 --> 00:40:01.619 align:start position:0%
know oh it's actually seven o'clock not
 
00:40:03.890 --> 00:40:03.900 align:start position:0%
eight o'clock in Vermont and it's no big
 
00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:05.329 align:start position:0%
eight o'clock in Vermont and it's no big
deal

00:40:05.329 --> 00:40:05.339 align:start position:0%
deal
 
00:40:08.349 --> 00:40:08.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:12.420 align:start position:0%
um okay you just brought up another
 
00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
issue to my mind you mentioned signs
 
00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:16.020 align:start position:0%
that you're
 
00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:19.380 align:start position:0%
uh so there's going to be a cost with
 
00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:21.900 align:start position:0%
putting up signs that tell people the
 
00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
time difference is that not true
 
00:40:27.890 --> 00:40:27.900 align:start position:0%
I believe that would be very minimal the
 
00:40:30.829 --> 00:40:30.839 align:start position:0%
actual savings you would gain from not
 
00:40:33.650 --> 00:40:33.660 align:start position:0%
having this big blip and heart attacks
 
00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
with your health health care costs
 
00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:39.540 align:start position:0%
Medicare Medicaid costs and the amount
 
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
of uh costs that would incur from your
 
00:40:44.890 --> 00:40:44.900 align:start position:0%
car insurance
 
00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
uh actually would surely offset that in
 
00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:51.060 align:start position:0%
a societal sense I can't imagine a few
 
00:40:58.910 --> 00:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:00.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:03.720 align:start position:0%
representative goalie
 
00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:05.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
00:41:07.130 --> 00:41:07.140 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz for taking my
 
00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:08.270 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz for taking my
question

00:41:08.270 --> 00:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:41:12.050 --> 00:41:12.060 align:start position:0%
uh we hear an increase of heart attacks
 
00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:15.300 align:start position:0%
and other health issues from changing
 
00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:16.609 align:start position:0%
and other health issues from changing
time

00:41:16.609 --> 00:41:16.619 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
twice a year
 
00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
how come we don't hear that same
 
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
argument when folks travel from one time
 
00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:24.180 align:start position:0%
zone to another and back and forth
 
00:41:26.810 --> 00:41:26.820 align:start position:0%
within a week of each other springing
 
00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
forward springing back
 
00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:29.270 align:start position:0%
forward springing back
um

00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:31.250 --> 00:41:31.260 align:start position:0%
is that being an issue how come we don't
 
00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
require people uh we don't hear about
 
00:41:36.109 --> 00:41:36.119 align:start position:0%
the health hazards of changing time
 
00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:38.460 align:start position:0%
zones when we travel that's an excellent
 
00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:40.200 align:start position:0%
question I don't know the answer to it
 
00:41:42.589 --> 00:41:42.599 align:start position:0%
maybe the folks that are
 
00:41:45.109 --> 00:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
research experts
 
00:41:47.089 --> 00:41:47.099 align:start position:0%
experts to that question I guess it's
 
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
just a comparison of you know not many
 
00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
of us uh you know when we travel it's
 
00:41:55.310 --> 00:41:55.320 align:start position:0%
not the same comparison or easy
 
00:41:58.430 --> 00:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
comparison as it is to an entire state
 
00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:01.320 align:start position:0%
or town or half of a state changing at
 
00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:02.940 align:start position:0%
the same time you know we're talking
 
00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
about a level of consistency and
 
00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
comparison to the rest of the year on
 
00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
two Mondays essentially of a year that
 
00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:14.280 align:start position:0%
an everybody is changing
 
00:42:17.329 --> 00:42:17.339 align:start position:0%
um but I'll maybe folks that are better
 
00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
experts at this after me can answer that
 
00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:21.420 align:start position:0%
question but it's a good question
 
00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:27.180 align:start position:0%
representative like us you have a
 
00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
question uh yes
 
00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
um there's been discussions of the
 
00:42:35.930 --> 00:42:35.940 align:start position:0%
alternative Atlantic Standard Time of
 
00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:37.380 align:start position:0%
going to Daylight Savings Time
 
00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
permanently but isn't
 
00:42:42.829 --> 00:42:42.839 align:start position:0%
um those functionally the same as far as
 
00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:45.839 align:start position:0%
what the time would be and the only
 
00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:47.460 align:start position:0%
difference is that and perhaps
 
00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:49.320 align:start position:0%
Atlantic's inner time will be more
 
00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:52.079 align:start position:0%
straightforward and uh permit daylight
 
00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
savings time the requirement
 
00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:56.329 align:start position:0%
savings time the requirement
actually

00:42:56.329 --> 00:42:56.339 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:42:59.630 --> 00:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:02.460 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that was a question but
 
00:43:05.690 --> 00:43:05.700 align:start position:0%
um is that true it sounds like it's true
 
00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:09.180 align:start position:0%
you know maybe people don't want to have
 
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
their time zone named Atlantic time zone
 
00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
but I believe that's true maybe the
 
00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:16.740 align:start position:0%
sponsor the lead sponsor would be better
 
00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
to answer that question but it is it is
 
00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
functionally the same as just remaining
 
00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:25.260 align:start position:0%
in the daylight savings time that we
 
00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
will be switching to in March
 
00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:29.809 align:start position:0%
will be switching to in March
yes

00:43:29.809 --> 00:43:29.819 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:43:32.270 --> 00:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
yes representative Pearson points out
 
00:43:34.370 --> 00:43:34.380 align:start position:0%
that the Red Sox would not be affected
 
00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:36.540 align:start position:0%
by the schedule change
 
00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:39.780 align:start position:0%
be right simple way of closing Network
 
00:43:44.569 --> 00:43:44.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:47.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
time allotted for this for this bill and
 
00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
three people who need to speak
 
00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:55.670 align:start position:0%
three people who need to speak
so

00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:43:59.569 --> 00:43:59.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:01.260 align:start position:0%
plus two other people that have
 
00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
volunteered and representative fellows
 
00:44:05.690 --> 00:44:05.700 align:start position:0%
has a question so I believe that it
 
00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate to recess this
 
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:16.309 --> 00:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
we're not going to finish it anytime
 
00:44:16.319 --> 00:44:22.990 align:start position:0%
we're not going to finish it anytime
soon

00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:25.740 align:start position:0%
I apologize to the members of the public
 
00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:28.980 align:start position:0%
who have come to join us but uh
 
00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
okay so we're going to move on to House
 
00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:51.780 align:start position:0%
Bill we're going to open a public
 
00:44:54.410 --> 00:44:54.420 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 499 and the chair
 
00:44:56.809 --> 00:44:56.819 align:start position:0%
is going to
 
00:44:56.819 --> 00:45:01.370 align:start position:0%
is going to
recognize

00:45:01.370 --> 00:45:01.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:07.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:45:13.309 --> 00:45:13.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:17.210 --> 00:45:17.220 align:start position:0%
you please mute yourself
 
00:45:21.109 --> 00:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
Bill 499 prohibits the state from using
 
00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
a face recognition
 
00:45:26.089 --> 00:45:26.099 align:start position:0%
of two parts
 
00:45:30.490 --> 00:45:30.500 align:start position:0%
first part is a
 
00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:33.180 align:start position:0%
restriction of
 
00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
how face recognition technology can be
 
00:45:39.109 --> 00:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
used in court and this part was
 
00:45:42.650 --> 00:45:42.660 align:start position:0%
developed by representative birch as a
 
00:45:44.990 --> 00:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
result of some
 
00:45:47.329 --> 00:45:47.339 align:start position:0%
difficulties we had with Ace previous
 
00:45:50.089 --> 00:45:50.099 align:start position:0%
bill on the same topic last session
 
00:45:54.290 --> 00:45:54.300 align:start position:0%
and it has some very very clear uh
 
00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:55.910 align:start position:0%
and it has some very very clear uh
restrictions

00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
restrictions
 
00:45:58.790 --> 00:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
there is a later amendment by another
 
00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
member of the general report who was
 
00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:03.780 align:start position:0%
also a lawyer who has an amendment that
 
00:46:06.829 --> 00:46:06.839 align:start position:0%
that restricts face recognition more
 
00:46:06.839 --> 00:46:08.210 align:start position:0%
that restricts face recognition more
broadly

00:46:08.210 --> 00:46:08.220 align:start position:0%
broadly
 
00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh I'm happy to support either of them
 
00:46:14.329 --> 00:46:14.339 align:start position:0%
but I am not a lawyer I am unfamiliar
 
00:46:16.790 --> 00:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
with court practice and I don't really
 
00:46:19.329 --> 00:46:19.339 align:start position:0%
have a way to determine the implications
 
00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
of either of those positions
 
00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
the part that I concentrated on was part
 
00:46:31.609 --> 00:46:31.619 align:start position:0%
two which is which prohibits the state
 
00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
from engaging and face recognition
 
00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:37.130 align:start position:0%
from engaging and face recognition
the

00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:37.140 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:46:40.130 --> 00:46:40.140 align:start position:0%
we do currently have a database of Faces
 
00:46:42.589 --> 00:46:42.599 align:start position:0%
in our driver's license database
 
00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
and this would prohibit the department
 
00:46:46.970 --> 00:46:46.980 align:start position:0%
of transportation from using face
 
00:46:49.609 --> 00:46:49.619 align:start position:0%
recognition on that or allowing it to be
 
00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:51.240 align:start position:0%
used by anybody
 
00:46:54.829 --> 00:46:54.839 align:start position:0%
under the process of face recognition
 
00:46:58.930 --> 00:46:58.940 align:start position:0%
it also bans other other state agencies
 
00:47:02.089 --> 00:47:02.099 align:start position:0%
to create or maintain a searchable
 
00:47:04.370 --> 00:47:04.380 align:start position:0%
database the faces
 
00:47:07.309 --> 00:47:07.319 align:start position:0%
when I researched this over the summer
 
00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
all of the photo databases were in
 
00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:13.140 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services
 
00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
and they were all
 
00:47:18.829 --> 00:47:18.839 align:start position:0%
they none of them were searchable by
 
00:47:21.290 --> 00:47:21.300 align:start position:0%
face recognition you could go into them
 
00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
by name and say
 
00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:27.060 align:start position:0%
this person here's a picture of this
 
00:47:28.609 --> 00:47:28.619 align:start position:0%
person who is an employee of the
 
00:47:31.309 --> 00:47:31.319 align:start position:0%
department if you want to verify his
 
00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
presence this is a person this is a
 
00:47:36.410 --> 00:47:36.420 align:start position:0%
photo of the person of the names you
 
00:47:39.530 --> 00:47:39.540 align:start position:0%
named who is a licensed plumber and
 
00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:42.300 align:start position:0%
here's a photo that he can use to verify
 
00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:46.040 align:start position:0%
this is actually uh
 
00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
they're all going by name
 
00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:52.980 align:start position:0%
and find the photo which sometimes you
 
00:47:56.329 --> 00:47:56.339 align:start position:0%
need to know is who what you can't do is
 
00:47:57.950 --> 00:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
take a
 
00:48:00.290 --> 00:48:00.300 align:start position:0%
picture of somebody
 
00:48:04.069 --> 00:48:04.079 align:start position:0%
and scan that database and say oh this
 
00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
person who's
 
00:48:07.730 --> 00:48:07.740 align:start position:0%
whose face came up on a convenience
 
00:48:10.609 --> 00:48:10.619 align:start position:0%
store robbery photo is actually a plum
 
00:48:13.790 --> 00:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
named someone such and such so you can
 
00:48:15.410 --> 00:48:15.420 align:start position:0%
go in with the name and get the photo
 
00:48:18.109 --> 00:48:18.119 align:start position:0%
that's fine you cannot go in with a
 
00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
photo of an unidentified person and use
 
00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
the state's resources to like to obtain
 
00:48:26.030 --> 00:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
identifying data
 
00:48:29.450 --> 00:48:29.460 align:start position:0%
that's the part that I that I wrote and
 
00:48:33.109 --> 00:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
I'm uh at this point none of them are
 
00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
used that way and I would very much like
 
00:48:38.809 --> 00:48:38.819 align:start position:0%
to establish the prohibition before
 
00:48:41.210 --> 00:48:41.220 align:start position:0%
they get into it
 
00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
and I will answer any questions on part
 
00:48:47.390 --> 00:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
two and defer part one to the other
 
00:48:54.650 --> 00:48:54.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:57.170 --> 00:48:57.180 align:start position:0%
um Madam excuse me Mr chair I do have a
 
00:48:59.150 --> 00:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
question if I may yes representative
 
00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:00.410 align:start position:0%
question if I may yes representative
Brian

00:49:00.410 --> 00:49:00.420 align:start position:0%
Brian
 
00:49:02.329 --> 00:49:02.339 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:49:04.609 --> 00:49:04.619 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative for taking
 
00:49:06.410 --> 00:49:06.420 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:49:08.690 --> 00:49:08.700 align:start position:0%
um currently now on your cell phone the
 
00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
technology does exist uh police
 
00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
departments do use it if I have my cell
 
00:49:17.690 --> 00:49:17.700 align:start position:0%
phone with me and I went and created a
 
00:49:20.450 --> 00:49:20.460 align:start position:0%
robbery uh they could track that my
 
00:49:24.109 --> 00:49:24.119 align:start position:0%
whereabouts via that device also people
 
00:49:28.849 --> 00:49:28.859 align:start position:0%
do know how I travel with the uh uh with
 
00:49:32.270 --> 00:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
the transponder that is on my vehicle uh
 
00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
so how is this face recognition with the
 
00:49:39.130 --> 00:49:39.140 align:start position:0%
new technologies really different in the
 
00:49:41.809 --> 00:49:41.819 align:start position:0%
detractability that we're living in in
 
00:49:43.849 --> 00:49:43.859 align:start position:0%
today's modern world
 
00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
the main thing is is you your your phone
 
00:49:53.329 --> 00:49:53.339 align:start position:0%
says the phone is in this location
 
00:49:55.609 --> 00:49:55.619 align:start position:0%
all right your phone could be stolen and
 
00:49:57.170 --> 00:49:57.180 align:start position:0%
someone else could use it
 
00:50:00.290 --> 00:50:00.300 align:start position:0%
and there are no prohibitions in this
 
00:50:03.109 --> 00:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
bill on any private use of face
 
00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
recognition or any local uses of face
 
00:50:09.109 --> 00:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
recognition there is only a restriction
 
00:50:13.130 --> 00:50:13.140 align:start position:0%
on what the state government does and on
 
00:50:18.410 --> 00:50:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:22.250 --> 00:50:22.260 align:start position:0%
so if your employer assuming it's not a
 
00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
government agency say Fidelity wants to
 
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:28.020 align:start position:0%
set up face recognition system for
 
00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
people who are walking into their
 
00:50:31.490 --> 00:50:31.500 align:start position:0%
offices in Merrimack
 
00:50:39.050 --> 00:50:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:43.790 --> 00:50:43.800 align:start position:0%

written to address those concerns
 
00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:11.520 align:start position:0%

District
 
00:54:09.010 --> 00:54:09.020 align:start position:0%
when this committee last saw this bill
 
00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
you considered it to be of such
 
00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
significant importance
 
00:54:20.329 --> 00:54:20.339 align:start position:0%
that you created a subcommittee that did
 
00:54:23.390 --> 00:54:23.400 align:start position:0%
an incredible amount of work to address
 
00:54:27.049 --> 00:54:27.059 align:start position:0%
the concerns that had been raised and to
 
00:54:30.130 --> 00:54:30.140 align:start position:0%
come up with a bill that you believed
 
00:54:32.950 --> 00:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
addressed those concerns
 
00:54:35.870 --> 00:54:35.880 align:start position:0%
Edna passed the bill it went to the
 
00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
floor the floor passed the bill and sent
 
00:54:41.870 --> 00:54:41.880 align:start position:0%
it to the Judiciary Committee
 
00:54:44.930 --> 00:54:44.940 align:start position:0%
at that point at that time I chaired the
 
00:54:47.329 --> 00:54:47.339 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee and I will confess
 
00:54:50.510 --> 00:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
to you that I consider my most
 
00:54:54.410 --> 00:54:54.420 align:start position:0%
significant failure as chair of the
 
00:54:58.609 --> 00:54:58.619 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee was to find a way to
 
00:55:02.109 --> 00:55:02.119 align:start position:0%
have people understand the implications
 
00:55:05.870 --> 00:55:05.880 align:start position:0%
of facial recognition and the possible
 
00:55:08.569 --> 00:55:08.579 align:start position:0%
misuse because in the end
 
00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary Committee voted itl on
 
00:55:14.750 --> 00:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:18.530 --> 00:55:18.540 align:start position:0%
I'm back again because I believe it is
 
00:55:22.790 --> 00:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
an incredibly important bill and as you
 
00:55:26.450 --> 00:55:26.460 align:start position:0%
might well be aware since you first
 
00:55:30.069 --> 00:55:30.079 align:start position:0%
considered this bill we have had
 
00:55:33.650 --> 00:55:33.660 align:start position:0%
situation after situation where we have
 
00:55:37.370 --> 00:55:37.380 align:start position:0%
been able to measure both the pluses of
 
00:55:39.829 --> 00:55:39.839 align:start position:0%
facial recognition and there certainly
 
00:55:41.690 --> 00:55:41.700 align:start position:0%
are pluses
 
00:55:46.790 --> 00:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
and the minuses of facial recognition
 
00:55:51.650 --> 00:55:51.660 align:start position:0%
and there are significant minuses and
 
00:55:54.410 --> 00:55:54.420 align:start position:0%
because of my commitment to the
 
00:55:57.170 --> 00:55:57.180 align:start position:0%
importance of personal privacy
 
00:55:59.630 --> 00:55:59.640 align:start position:0%
and of
 
00:56:02.930 --> 00:56:02.940 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to use two terms both civil
 
00:56:05.809 --> 00:56:05.819 align:start position:0%
rights and civil liberties
 
00:56:09.250 --> 00:56:09.260 align:start position:0%
um I am back today with an amendment
 
00:56:12.650 --> 00:56:12.660 align:start position:0%
that takes the bill that
 
00:56:16.309 --> 00:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
um uh chairman Maguire introduced
 
00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:20.220 align:start position:0%
and attempted to incorporate in it a
 
00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
recognition of how if used correctly
 
00:56:25.790 --> 00:56:25.800 align:start position:0%
facial recognition is a plus
 
00:56:30.130 --> 00:56:30.140 align:start position:0%
but if not used correctly it can create
 
00:56:33.290 --> 00:56:33.300 align:start position:0%
terrible deleterious
 
00:56:33.300 --> 00:56:34.089 align:start position:0%
terrible deleterious
um

00:56:34.089 --> 00:56:34.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:37.130 --> 00:56:37.140 align:start position:0%
repercussions particularly for people of
 
00:56:40.670 --> 00:56:40.680 align:start position:0%
color and for women
 
00:56:45.349 --> 00:56:45.359 align:start position:0%
two categories where at least so far the
 
00:56:48.190 --> 00:56:48.200 align:start position:0%
level of facial recognition technology
 
00:56:53.809 --> 00:56:53.819 align:start position:0%
has not been able to ensure accurate
 
00:56:55.970 --> 00:56:55.980 align:start position:0%
um reporting
 
00:56:57.829 --> 00:56:57.839 align:start position:0%
I have
 
00:57:04.370 --> 00:57:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:07.990 --> 00:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
it has uh the chairs
 
00:57:12.410 --> 00:57:12.420 align:start position:0%
uh name on it chair McGuire and my name
 
00:57:16.609 --> 00:57:16.619 align:start position:0%
on it and what this bill this amendment
 
00:57:21.049 --> 00:57:21.059 align:start position:0%
tries to do is balance the pluses and
 
00:57:24.589 --> 00:57:24.599 align:start position:0%
minuses of facial recognition having to
 
00:57:24.599 --> 00:57:25.510 align:start position:0%
minuses of facial recognition having to
do

00:57:25.510 --> 00:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:57:30.109 --> 00:57:30.119 align:start position:0%
exclusively with the powers of the state
 
00:57:30.119 --> 00:57:32.329 align:start position:0%
exclusively with the powers of the state
and

00:57:32.329 --> 00:57:32.339 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:57:32.339 --> 00:57:32.990 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:57:32.990 --> 00:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:38.329 --> 00:57:38.339 align:start position:0%
what it does is put in place a very
 
00:57:44.329 --> 00:57:44.339 align:start position:0%
commonly used and effective tool of a
 
00:57:44.339 --> 00:57:45.230 align:start position:0%
commonly used and effective tool of a
warrant

00:57:45.230 --> 00:57:45.240 align:start position:0%
warrant
 
00:57:49.730 --> 00:57:49.740 align:start position:0%
to say that in order for the police
 
00:57:51.890 --> 00:57:51.900 align:start position:0%
to um
 
00:57:55.370 --> 00:57:55.380 align:start position:0%
use facial recognition
 
00:57:59.329 --> 00:57:59.339 align:start position:0%
they need award and as you all will know
 
00:58:03.309 --> 00:58:03.319 align:start position:0%
warrants can be granted very quickly
 
00:58:05.569 --> 00:58:05.579 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
um reason to believe that there is has
 
00:58:12.309 --> 00:58:12.319 align:start position:0%
to be a a significant time delay
 
00:58:12.319 --> 00:58:14.030 align:start position:0%
to be a a significant time delay
and

00:58:14.030 --> 00:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:15.410 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:58:15.410 --> 00:58:15.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:19.870 --> 00:58:19.880 align:start position:0%
and it makes it possible to
 
00:58:24.770 --> 00:58:24.780 align:start position:0%
put a belt and suspenders on a system to
 
00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:27.180 align:start position:0%
make sure that we can get the benefits
 
00:58:31.609 --> 00:58:31.619 align:start position:0%
of facial recognition but not encourage
 
00:58:33.349 --> 00:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
the misuse
 
00:58:36.829 --> 00:58:36.839 align:start position:0%
of a technology that at this point has
 
00:58:39.410 --> 00:58:39.420 align:start position:0%
not yet reached
 
00:58:42.250 --> 00:58:42.260 align:start position:0%
um a hundred percent
 
00:58:46.069 --> 00:58:46.079 align:start position:0%
guarantee of accuracy so
 
00:58:46.079 --> 00:58:47.329 align:start position:0%
guarantee of accuracy so
um

00:58:47.329 --> 00:58:47.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:47.339 --> 00:58:48.950 align:start position:0%
um
I

00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:58:52.849 --> 00:58:52.859 align:start position:0%
I think you've read a lot of stories in
 
00:58:54.890 --> 00:58:54.900 align:start position:0%
the year or more since we last looked at
 
00:58:58.370 --> 00:58:58.380 align:start position:0%
this bill about how sometimes facial
 
00:59:01.730 --> 00:59:01.740 align:start position:0%
recognition has been used positively but
 
00:59:04.970 --> 00:59:04.980 align:start position:0%
also the incredible injustices that have
 
00:59:07.069 --> 00:59:07.079 align:start position:0%
been caused by the misuse of facial
 
00:59:10.010 --> 00:59:10.020 align:start position:0%
recognition I believe that this
 
00:59:12.950 --> 00:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
amendment gets us closer
 
00:59:15.950 --> 00:59:15.960 align:start position:0%
to where we want to be and understanding
 
00:59:18.770 --> 00:59:18.780 align:start position:0%
that as the technology improves if it
 
00:59:22.490 --> 00:59:22.500 align:start position:0%
does improve we can always make future
 
00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:24.410 align:start position:0%
does improve we can always make future
changes

00:59:24.410 --> 00:59:24.420 align:start position:0%
changes
 
00:59:27.950 --> 00:59:27.960 align:start position:0%
um thank you for uh permitting me to
 
00:59:30.770 --> 00:59:30.780 align:start position:0%
give my my testimony
 
00:59:32.210 --> 00:59:32.220 align:start position:0%
does anybody on the committee have a
 
00:59:34.750 --> 00:59:34.760 align:start position:0%
question for the representative no I do
 
00:59:37.010 --> 00:59:37.020 align:start position:0%
representative scitec representative
 
00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:38.030 align:start position:0%
representative scitec representative
Smith

00:59:38.030 --> 00:59:38.040 align:start position:0%
Smith
 
00:59:40.789 --> 00:59:40.799 align:start position:0%
um with respect to the uh events at the
 
00:59:44.270 --> 00:59:44.280 align:start position:0%
national capital recently uh would the
 
00:59:46.370 --> 00:59:46.380 align:start position:0%
police need a warrant to go after to
 
00:59:48.410 --> 00:59:48.420 align:start position:0%
start identifying these people if they
 
00:59:52.549 --> 00:59:52.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:54.410 --> 00:59:54.420 align:start position:0%
well there are two answers to that
 
00:59:56.750 --> 00:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
question the first
 
01:00:01.490 --> 01:00:01.500 align:start position:0%
um answer representative scient is what
 
01:00:05.930 --> 01:00:05.940 align:start position:0%
we see going on today is why I have no
 
01:00:09.349 --> 01:00:09.359 align:start position:0%
I refuse to use social media what we see
 
01:00:15.609 --> 01:00:15.619 align:start position:0%
is in each and every case it was the um
 
01:00:19.849 --> 01:00:19.859 align:start position:0%
perpetrators themselves who took photos
 
01:00:23.630 --> 01:00:23.640 align:start position:0%
of themselves and broadcasted over all
 
01:00:26.270 --> 01:00:26.280 align:start position:0%
of the social media
 
01:00:28.309 --> 01:00:28.319 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
01:00:33.470 --> 01:00:33.480 align:start position:0%
sites and therefore are completely out
 
01:00:36.829 --> 01:00:36.839 align:start position:0%
of consideration in this because they
 
01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:40.380 align:start position:0%
are providing their faces and their oral
 
01:00:43.370 --> 01:00:43.380 align:start position:0%
testimony that they were there
 
01:00:46.370 --> 01:00:46.380 align:start position:0%
um in other cases
 
01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
um and I I believe that it would be
 
01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:52.970 align:start position:0%
um and I I believe that it would be
necessary

01:00:52.970 --> 01:00:52.980 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
01:00:54.890 --> 01:00:54.900 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:00:58.390 --> 01:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
um the appropriate police agency
 
01:01:01.069 --> 01:01:01.079 align:start position:0%
to get
 
01:01:04.130 --> 01:01:04.140 align:start position:0%
um a warrant which again under these
 
01:01:04.140 --> 01:01:05.990 align:start position:0%
um a warrant which again under these
circumstances

01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
01:01:10.630 --> 01:01:10.640 align:start position:0%
um would be issued by any uh
 
01:01:13.849 --> 01:01:13.859 align:start position:0%
Authority without any delay and it is
 
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
the perfect example of the pluses and
 
01:01:19.370 --> 01:01:19.380 align:start position:0%
the minuses of facial recognition
 
01:01:22.190 --> 01:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
because it can be used
 
01:01:25.309 --> 01:01:25.319 align:start position:0%
um well and carefully to the benefit of
 
01:01:27.530 --> 01:01:27.540 align:start position:0%
the public good but it also could be
 
01:01:32.089 --> 01:01:32.099 align:start position:0%
misused all that this does is require in
 
01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
cases where it's appropriate that the
 
01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
police state
 
01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:40.200 align:start position:0%
why they want a warrant and
 
01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:42.710 align:start position:0%
why they want a warrant and
um

01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:45.170 --> 01:01:45.180 align:start position:0%
for those of us who have
 
01:01:48.170 --> 01:01:48.180 align:start position:0%
been following at all what has been
 
01:01:51.230 --> 01:01:51.240 align:start position:0%
going on we know that that warrant would
 
01:01:55.089 --> 01:01:55.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:57.589 --> 01:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
representative Smith to chase you just a
 
01:01:59.930 --> 01:01:59.940 align:start position:0%
little bit on this uh just because they
 
01:02:02.930 --> 01:02:02.940 align:start position:0%
put their faces on social media does
 
01:02:04.309 --> 01:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
that mean they're they have been
 
01:02:06.650 --> 01:02:06.660 align:start position:0%
identified that would still need facial
 
01:02:09.770 --> 01:02:09.780 align:start position:0%
recognition technology
 
01:02:11.870 --> 01:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
to your first point
 
01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:12.530 align:start position:0%
to your first point
um

01:02:12.530 --> 01:02:12.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:14.630 align:start position:0%
um
yes

01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:17.160 align:start position:0%
that's true but
 
01:02:19.730 --> 01:02:19.740 align:start position:0%
um for many of them they have in fact
 
01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:21.950 align:start position:0%
um for many of them they have in fact
declared

01:02:21.950 --> 01:02:21.960 align:start position:0%
declared
 
01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
who they are and what they're doing I
 
01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
also want to say representative scitec
 
01:02:30.049 --> 01:02:30.059 align:start position:0%
that although I that I am not an
 
01:02:32.030 --> 01:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
attorney and
 
01:02:35.150 --> 01:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
um I don't even play one on TV
 
01:02:39.710 --> 01:02:39.720 align:start position:0%
um uh although I probably could but I
 
01:02:41.569 --> 01:02:41.579 align:start position:0%
don't like spatial recognition so I
 
01:02:43.849 --> 01:02:43.859 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want my picture taken
 
01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
um but I would uh respectfully suggest
 
01:02:49.609 --> 01:02:49.619 align:start position:0%
that people who are more sophisticated
 
01:02:52.849 --> 01:02:52.859 align:start position:0%
than I about the use of
 
01:02:52.859 --> 01:02:53.870 align:start position:0%
than I about the use of
um

01:02:53.870 --> 01:02:53.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:58.130 --> 01:02:58.140 align:start position:0%
uh of warrants answer your question uh
 
01:03:01.549 --> 01:03:01.559 align:start position:0%
because I don't want to mislead someone
 
01:03:06.109 --> 01:03:06.119 align:start position:0%
I respect so much in the legislature
 
01:03:08.930 --> 01:03:08.940 align:start position:0%
like Mr representative followed by
 
01:03:16.789 --> 01:03:16.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:19.549 --> 01:03:19.559 align:start position:0%
kind of following up on uh
 
01:03:22.609 --> 01:03:22.619 align:start position:0%
representative cytek's question
 
01:03:25.549 --> 01:03:25.559 align:start position:0%
um I saw in the news last night uh for
 
01:03:28.730 --> 01:03:28.740 align:start position:0%
the first time they presented some of
 
01:03:32.089 --> 01:03:32.099 align:start position:0%
the security camera footage from the
 
01:03:33.650 --> 01:03:33.660 align:start position:0%
capitol itself
 
01:03:36.609 --> 01:03:36.619 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know if those have been used
 
01:03:39.890 --> 01:03:39.900 align:start position:0%
uh in an attempt to identify some of
 
01:03:43.190 --> 01:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
these folks but isn't that wouldn't that
 
01:03:46.130 --> 01:03:46.140 align:start position:0%
be prohibited from this bill
 
01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
I can't answer that question
 
01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:50.690 align:start position:0%
I can't answer that question
representative

01:03:50.690 --> 01:03:50.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:52.670 --> 01:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
right thank you the federal law
 
01:03:56.410 --> 01:03:56.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:59.569 --> 01:03:59.579 align:start position:0%
yes this bill affects the New Hampshire
 
01:04:01.849 --> 01:04:01.859 align:start position:0%
government and the New Hampshire court
 
01:04:04.130 --> 01:04:04.140 align:start position:0%
system anything that happened at the
 
01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
federal capital in Washington is not
 
01:04:09.950 --> 01:04:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:13.130 --> 01:04:13.140 align:start position:0%
question of the chair
 
01:04:16.609 --> 01:04:16.619 align:start position:0%
um in regards to that response
 
01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
um we understand that some of the people
 
01:04:23.809 --> 01:04:23.819 align:start position:0%
who did invade the capital were from New
 
01:04:28.309 --> 01:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so this bill will prevent
 
01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure I guess Federal
 
01:04:32.930 --> 01:04:32.940 align:start position:0%
authorities from using facial
 
01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:34.250 align:start position:0%
authorities from using facial
recognition

01:04:34.250 --> 01:04:34.260 align:start position:0%
recognition
 
01:04:36.430 --> 01:04:36.440 align:start position:0%
two no
 
01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
representative it would prohibit
 
01:04:43.130 --> 01:04:43.140 align:start position:0%
them from bringing a case against that
 
01:04:46.250 --> 01:04:46.260 align:start position:0%
person in New Hampshire courts it would
 
01:04:48.170 --> 01:04:48.180 align:start position:0%
not affect anything they would do in
 
01:04:50.270 --> 01:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
federal courts which is where I would
 
01:04:52.849 --> 01:04:52.859 align:start position:0%
suspect they would be bringing such a
 
01:04:57.289 --> 01:04:57.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:59.750 --> 01:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
representative Allegro thank you a
 
01:05:02.210 --> 01:05:02.220 align:start position:0%
question of Representative Smith
 
01:05:05.270 --> 01:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
um rightly so I think you're you're you
 
01:05:06.829 --> 01:05:06.839 align:start position:0%
express concerns about the technical
 
01:05:09.410 --> 01:05:09.420 align:start position:0%
short comings of uh facial recognition
 
01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:11.329 align:start position:0%
short comings of uh facial recognition
systems

01:05:11.329 --> 01:05:11.339 align:start position:0%
systems
 
01:05:11.339 --> 01:05:12.049 align:start position:0%
systems
um

01:05:12.049 --> 01:05:12.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:14.930 --> 01:05:14.940 align:start position:0%
how does allowing for its use
 
01:05:17.569 --> 01:05:17.579 align:start position:0%
by requiring a warrant
 
01:05:21.589 --> 01:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
uh let me rephrase that
 
01:05:25.250 --> 01:05:25.260 align:start position:0%
how does um requiring a warrant to allow
 
01:05:27.530 --> 01:05:27.540 align:start position:0%
for its use mitigate against the
 
01:05:29.450 --> 01:05:29.460 align:start position:0%
technical shortcomings
 
01:05:32.450 --> 01:05:32.460 align:start position:0%
that you're concerned about I I don't
 
01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:39.170 --> 01:05:39.180 align:start position:0%
I agree with you I don't think per se
 
01:05:40.849 --> 01:05:40.859 align:start position:0%
that it does
 
01:05:43.490 --> 01:05:43.500 align:start position:0%
what this bill attempts to acknowledge
 
01:05:48.650 --> 01:05:48.660 align:start position:0%
is that facial recognition is here now
 
01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
it is being used now and it can be used
 
01:05:58.549 --> 01:05:58.559 align:start position:0%
for good and it can be used for ill and
 
01:06:03.710 --> 01:06:03.720 align:start position:0%
not wanting to completely deny
 
01:06:07.450 --> 01:06:07.460 align:start position:0%
the the existence of facial recognition
 
01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
technology and not wanting to completely
 
01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:13.849 align:start position:0%
technology and not wanting to completely
require

01:06:13.849 --> 01:06:13.859 align:start position:0%
require
 
01:06:16.910 --> 01:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
um law enforcement officials to be
 
01:06:19.210 --> 01:06:19.220 align:start position:0%
denied a potential
 
01:06:21.530 --> 01:06:21.540 align:start position:0%
valuable tool
 
01:06:25.789 --> 01:06:25.799 align:start position:0%
this is uh a measure along the Continuum
 
01:06:28.490 --> 01:06:28.500 align:start position:0%
that would require
 
01:06:32.349 --> 01:06:32.359 align:start position:0%
um law enforcement to
 
01:06:34.970 --> 01:06:34.980 align:start position:0%
stop and think
 
01:06:39.770 --> 01:06:39.780 align:start position:0%
and be sure and be on record
 
01:06:44.329 --> 01:06:44.339 align:start position:0%
as to why they are seeking to use facial
 
01:06:47.270 --> 01:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
recognition and it is possible in a year
 
01:06:49.849 --> 01:06:49.859 align:start position:0%
or two or ten
 
01:06:52.490 --> 01:06:52.500 align:start position:0%
um such a restriction might not be
 
01:06:55.549 --> 01:06:55.559 align:start position:0%
necessary by then who knows we all might
 
01:06:57.770 --> 01:06:57.780 align:start position:0%
have these little things embedded in our
 
01:07:00.349 --> 01:07:00.359 align:start position:0%
foreheads that you know tell everybody
 
01:07:02.630 --> 01:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
where we are every minute I'm not
 
01:07:04.730 --> 01:07:04.740 align:start position:0%
counting on that but it's possible as
 
01:07:07.250 --> 01:07:07.260 align:start position:0%
technology uh
 
01:07:11.450 --> 01:07:11.460 align:start position:0%
moves along meanwhile we have had too
 
01:07:14.390 --> 01:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
many instances of where facial
 
01:07:18.549 --> 01:07:18.559 align:start position:0%
recognition technology was used casually
 
01:07:23.150 --> 01:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
or without careful forethought and has
 
01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:25.930 align:start position:0%
or without careful forethought and has
definitely

01:07:25.930 --> 01:07:25.940 align:start position:0%
definitely
 
01:07:29.270 --> 01:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
resulted in um in harm
 
01:07:34.069 --> 01:07:34.079 align:start position:0%
to citizens in our in our country and in
 
01:07:35.470 --> 01:07:35.480 align:start position:0%
our state
 
01:07:38.329 --> 01:07:38.339 align:start position:0%
specifically but not exclusively people
 
01:07:43.730 --> 01:07:43.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:45.410 --> 01:07:45.420 align:start position:0%
representative fellows you had your hand
 
01:07:46.670 --> 01:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
up and you
 
01:07:48.289 --> 01:07:48.299 align:start position:0%
spoke it away
 
01:07:50.210 --> 01:07:50.220 align:start position:0%
thank you for a question a question for
 
01:07:53.870 --> 01:07:53.880 align:start position:0%
either representative Maguire or
 
01:07:57.529 --> 01:07:57.539 align:start position:0%
um Smith in the version that was passed
 
01:08:01.670 --> 01:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
last year by this committee it included
 
01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:04.799 align:start position:0%
a provision that said it was okay for
 
01:08:08.750 --> 01:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
state police to use this technology if
 
01:08:10.789 --> 01:08:10.799 align:start position:0%
they were working in cooperation with
 
01:08:15.170 --> 01:08:15.180 align:start position:0%
federal agents and so that's not in the
 
01:08:17.930 --> 01:08:17.940 align:start position:0%
new version either the original or the
 
01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:20.940 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment so is that just
 
01:08:23.269 --> 01:08:23.279 align:start position:0%
because you think it's not necessary or
 
01:08:26.570 --> 01:08:26.580 align:start position:0%
is by leaving it out is there does that
 
01:08:29.709 --> 01:08:29.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:29.719 --> 01:08:31.550 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:08:31.550 --> 01:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:08:33.349 --> 01:08:33.359 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire do you want to
 
01:08:34.970 --> 01:08:34.980 align:start position:0%
answer that
 
01:08:38.530 --> 01:08:38.540 align:start position:0%
no I bow to my experts on that part I
 
01:08:42.590 --> 01:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
did not work did not adopt
 
01:08:45.110 --> 01:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
the wording of each of that part either
 
01:08:49.789 --> 01:08:49.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:52.669 --> 01:08:52.679 align:start position:0%
and I I would do the same I would leave
 
01:08:53.930 --> 01:08:53.940 align:start position:0%
it to
 
01:08:53.940 --> 01:08:55.030 align:start position:0%
it to
um

01:08:55.030 --> 01:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:57.950 --> 01:08:57.960 align:start position:0%
the more skilled professionals who will
 
01:09:07.870 --> 01:09:07.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:11.329 --> 01:09:11.339 align:start position:0%
thank you that's all
 
01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:22.430 --> 01:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
Cher is going to call Mr share
 
01:09:23.690 --> 01:09:23.700 align:start position:0%
and unmute yourself sir
 
01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:27.590 align:start position:0%
and unmute yourself sir
[Music]

01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:30.289 --> 01:09:30.299 align:start position:0%
um everybody can hear me now yes we can
 
01:09:33.829 --> 01:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh
 
01:09:36.229 --> 01:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair uh members of
 
01:09:37.669 --> 01:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Albert sure
 
01:09:40.370 --> 01:09:40.380 align:start position:0%
often called Buzz instead of Albert I'm
 
01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
a professor at UNH School of Law I
 
01:09:45.769 --> 01:09:45.779 align:start position:0%
um I've been involved in the criminal
 
01:09:49.490 --> 01:09:49.500 align:start position:0%
justice system for 40 years I've also uh
 
01:09:51.229 --> 01:09:51.239 align:start position:0%
been very interested in privacy
 
01:09:53.329 --> 01:09:53.339 align:start position:0%
legislation particularly over the the
 
01:09:55.370 --> 01:09:55.380 align:start position:0%
last five years I worked very closely
 
01:09:59.390 --> 01:09:59.400 align:start position:0%
with former representative uh Kirk uh in
 
01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
the drafting of what is now uh New
 
01:10:04.010 --> 01:10:04.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's unique uh privacy
 
01:10:05.810 --> 01:10:05.820 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment part one
 
01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
article 2B so I'm very focused uh
 
01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
broadly on privacy issues I teach and I
 
01:10:14.030 --> 01:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
write in that area the opinions I
 
01:10:16.070 --> 01:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
expressed today are mine only they are
 
01:10:19.430 --> 01:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
not the opinions of uh the University of
 
01:10:23.290 --> 01:10:23.300 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire or the UNH School of Law
 
01:10:26.090 --> 01:10:26.100 align:start position:0%
just to clear up I've filed written
 
01:10:28.850 --> 01:10:28.860 align:start position:0%
testimony and so I'll try to be as
 
01:10:31.070 --> 01:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
abbreviated as I can in my presentation
 
01:10:33.290 --> 01:10:33.300 align:start position:0%
so that I can answer some of the more
 
01:10:34.970 --> 01:10:34.980 align:start position:0%
technical questions questions that that
 
01:10:36.649 --> 01:10:36.659 align:start position:0%
I've been hearing
 
01:10:42.290 --> 01:10:42.300 align:start position:0%
um uh my my I I am noted as opposing HB
 
01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:45.960 align:start position:0%
499 uh that's how I signed up I oppose
 
01:10:49.250 --> 01:10:49.260 align:start position:0%
the current version of hb499 and I'll
 
01:10:51.290 --> 01:10:51.300 align:start position:0%
explain that when I get to that part of
 
01:10:55.669 --> 01:10:55.679 align:start position:0%
my presentation I am in support of the
 
01:10:58.310 --> 01:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
amendment that has been filed that is
 
01:11:01.970 --> 01:11:01.980 align:start position:0%
more simple more clear uh and more to
 
01:11:05.149 --> 01:11:05.159 align:start position:0%
the point uh in dealing with this that
 
01:11:07.490 --> 01:11:07.500 align:start position:0%
is the amendment that requires a search
 
01:11:10.610 --> 01:11:10.620 align:start position:0%
warrant supported by probable cause
 
01:11:12.590 --> 01:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
issued by an independent endicrow
 
01:11:14.750 --> 01:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
magistrate so let me give a little
 
01:11:17.149 --> 01:11:17.159 align:start position:0%
context to all of this I think many of
 
01:11:19.970 --> 01:11:19.980 align:start position:0%
you are personally at least personally
 
01:11:22.250 --> 01:11:22.260 align:start position:0%
perhaps professionally familiar with the
 
01:11:24.530 --> 01:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
context you know in the in the 20th
 
01:11:27.729 --> 01:11:27.739 align:start position:0%
century uh we really thought about
 
01:11:30.410 --> 01:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
constitutional privacy in terms of the
 
01:11:32.990 --> 01:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
Fourth Amendment uh in terms of searches
 
01:11:35.030 --> 01:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
and seizures and the Fourth Amendment
 
01:11:37.430 --> 01:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
reads like uh
 
01:11:39.950 --> 01:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
text some version of physical privacy
 
01:11:43.370 --> 01:11:43.380 align:start position:0%
your body your house your property your
 
01:11:46.130 --> 01:11:46.140 align:start position:0%
luggage that's that's the feel and the
 
01:11:47.689 --> 01:11:47.699 align:start position:0%
language of the foursome Fourth
 
01:11:50.870 --> 01:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh and that worked fine in the
 
01:11:53.330 --> 01:11:53.340 align:start position:0%
20th century when we got to the 21st
 
01:11:56.149 --> 01:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
century more and more we started dealing
 
01:11:58.910 --> 01:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
with technology that was all about
 
01:12:01.669 --> 01:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
intangible information what's inside
 
01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
your cell phone the uh the pictures you
 
01:12:07.910 --> 01:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
can derive from uh official recognition
 
01:12:11.630 --> 01:12:11.640 align:start position:0%
technology uh they're basically uh fancy
 
01:12:14.149 --> 01:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
information uh for you know
 
01:12:16.610 --> 01:12:16.620 align:start position:0%
surreptitious DNA harvesting where the
 
01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
people the police follow somebody around
 
01:12:21.050 --> 01:12:21.060 align:start position:0%
and without a warrant sees a cigarette
 
01:12:23.870 --> 01:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
belt they cast aside and mine it for as
 
01:12:26.090 --> 01:12:26.100 align:start position:0%
much genetic information as they can get
 
01:12:28.370 --> 01:12:28.380 align:start position:0%
what's an issue there is information
 
01:12:31.550 --> 01:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
rather than the physical item and it
 
01:12:33.950 --> 01:12:33.960 align:start position:0%
turns out uh the fourth amendment has
 
01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
been in the 21st century kind of clunky
 
01:12:39.890 --> 01:12:39.900 align:start position:0%
uh in dealing with that uh trying to
 
01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
recognize well when you go into
 
01:12:44.810 --> 01:12:44.820 align:start position:0%
somebody's you know cells that they have
 
01:12:47.390 --> 01:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
abandoned does that count as a search
 
01:12:49.790 --> 01:12:49.800 align:start position:0%
you know is that covered by the Fourth
 
01:12:53.330 --> 01:12:53.340 align:start position:0%
Amendment or when you uh attach a GPS to
 
01:12:55.610 --> 01:12:55.620 align:start position:0%
the uh bottom of somebody's truck you
 
01:12:57.350 --> 01:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
don't enter the truck you just attach a
 
01:12:59.630 --> 01:12:59.640 align:start position:0%
GPS to the bottom of the truck the
 
01:13:02.030 --> 01:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
police uh do that and then follow it
 
01:13:04.070 --> 01:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
around for 10 days is the information
 
01:13:07.630 --> 01:13:07.640 align:start position:0%
they gathered uh acquired from a search
 
01:13:10.189 --> 01:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
uh that uh protected by the Fourth
 
01:13:13.189 --> 01:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
Amendment or not so we've run into these
 
01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
kind of problems when we're talking
 
01:13:17.270 --> 01:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
about information privacy the fourth
 
01:13:19.250 --> 01:13:19.260 align:start position:0%
amendment has been kind of clunky in
 
01:13:21.350 --> 01:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
figuring out whether whether the police
 
01:13:23.209 --> 01:13:23.219 align:start position:0%
need a warrant whether they don't need a
 
01:13:25.490 --> 01:13:25.500 align:start position:0%
warrant so uh and facial recognition
 
01:13:28.189 --> 01:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
technology is a part of that it gathers
 
01:13:30.669 --> 01:13:30.679 align:start position:0%
as I described the kind of information
 
01:13:33.850 --> 01:13:33.860 align:start position:0%
uh and you know it gathers information
 
01:13:37.189 --> 01:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
from somebody in public
 
01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
you know and part of what the discussion
 
01:13:42.830 --> 01:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
has been uh in court cases and among
 
01:13:46.130 --> 01:13:46.140 align:start position:0%
privacy uh Scholars and others uh an
 
01:13:48.590 --> 01:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
activists has been do you completely
 
01:13:53.510 --> 01:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
Abandon All privacy uh of any sort when
 
01:13:55.370 --> 01:13:55.380 align:start position:0%
you go into public
 
01:13:59.450 --> 01:13:59.460 align:start position:0%
you know Can the police mine your uh the
 
01:14:02.570 --> 01:14:02.580 align:start position:0%
saliva and the cells on your on your
 
01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
cigarette butt that you cast aside uh
 
01:14:07.310 --> 01:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
for all sorts of whatever genetic
 
01:14:09.229 --> 01:14:09.239 align:start position:0%
information they want without having to
 
01:14:11.270 --> 01:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
get a warrant to do that you know can
 
01:14:13.430 --> 01:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
they follow you you know secretly put a
 
01:14:15.649 --> 01:14:15.659 align:start position:0%
GPS on the bottom of your car and follow
 
01:14:17.149 --> 01:14:17.159 align:start position:0%
you around for as long as they want
 
01:14:19.189 --> 01:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
without ever having to get a warrant and
 
01:14:20.450 --> 01:14:20.460 align:start position:0%
use that information for whatever
 
01:14:23.630 --> 01:14:23.640 align:start position:0%
purpose they want and uh that you know
 
01:14:26.630 --> 01:14:26.640 align:start position:0%
and those are all you know privacy in
 
01:14:28.550 --> 01:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
public questions official recognition
 
01:14:32.209 --> 01:14:32.219 align:start position:0%
technology is another privacy and public
 
01:14:34.370 --> 01:14:34.380 align:start position:0%
uh problem
 
01:14:37.490 --> 01:14:37.500 align:start position:0%
um it's it's it's I'll
 
01:14:40.729 --> 01:14:40.739 align:start position:0%
now let me um
 
01:14:42.770 --> 01:14:42.780 align:start position:0%
let me talk briefly about the
 
01:14:45.709 --> 01:14:45.719 align:start position:0%
reliability issue although I agree with
 
01:14:49.189 --> 01:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
uh representative Smith that uh this
 
01:14:52.189 --> 01:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
bill is not a perfect bill I was in in
 
01:14:55.130 --> 01:14:55.140 align:start position:0%
strong support of the original Bill last
 
01:14:59.090 --> 01:14:59.100 align:start position:0%
succession that passed this committee uh
 
01:15:02.390 --> 01:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
uh with a solid majority
 
01:15:06.410 --> 01:15:06.420 align:start position:0%
um that that that put greater breaks on
 
01:15:09.649 --> 01:15:09.659 align:start position:0%
uh official recognition technology than
 
01:15:11.810 --> 01:15:11.820 align:start position:0%
the bills we're working with now
 
01:15:13.490 --> 01:15:13.500 align:start position:0%
um and I appreciate that that's a
 
01:15:16.430 --> 01:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
compromise uh it's imperfect compromise
 
01:15:18.950 --> 01:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
but I think it's a it's very important
 
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
to move forward in this way uh with the
 
01:15:28.250 --> 01:15:28.260 align:start position:0%
uh with um uh with the amendment to HB
 
01:15:32.149 --> 01:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
499 as it's now written uh my my tech my
 
01:15:34.850 --> 01:15:34.860 align:start position:0%
written testimony talks in more depth
 
01:15:37.310 --> 01:15:37.320 align:start position:0%
about the reliability issues so I won't
 
01:15:40.010 --> 01:15:40.020 align:start position:0%
go into that anymore
 
01:15:40.020 --> 01:15:40.729 align:start position:0%
go into that anymore
um

01:15:40.729 --> 01:15:40.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:45.590 --> 01:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
I I'm in strong opposition to HB 499 as
 
01:15:48.890 --> 01:15:48.900 align:start position:0%
it's currently written because it is a
 
01:15:53.330 --> 01:15:53.340 align:start position:0%
pro uh facial recognition bill it allows
 
01:15:55.130 --> 01:15:55.140 align:start position:0%
the police to do whatever facial
 
01:15:57.410 --> 01:15:57.420 align:start position:0%
recognition use facial recognition
 
01:16:00.350 --> 01:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
technology however they want to surveil
 
01:16:03.050 --> 01:16:03.060 align:start position:0%
someone for 72 hours they don't need a
 
01:16:04.850 --> 01:16:04.860 align:start position:0%
warrant they don't need to tell anybody
 
01:16:07.370 --> 01:16:07.380 align:start position:0%
uh they don't need to get approval of
 
01:16:11.870 --> 01:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
any sort for 72 hours under the uh the
 
01:16:15.410 --> 01:16:15.420 align:start position:0%
current HB 499 they can do whatever they
 
01:16:19.010 --> 01:16:19.020 align:start position:0%
want only after 72 hours do they start
 
01:16:23.510 --> 01:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
to have some some requirements uh to get
 
01:16:25.970 --> 01:16:25.980 align:start position:0%
a court order but the requirements that
 
01:16:28.490 --> 01:16:28.500 align:start position:0%
they're that are imposed on them are
 
01:16:31.250 --> 01:16:31.260 align:start position:0%
completely vague and uh troubling
 
01:16:34.970 --> 01:16:34.980 align:start position:0%
actually number one it requires a a
 
01:16:37.910 --> 01:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
police officer law enforcement to get a
 
01:16:40.790 --> 01:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:43.250 --> 01:16:43.260 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say that a court order is a
 
01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
warrant it doesn't say that to get a
 
01:16:48.950 --> 01:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
court order you need probable cause
 
01:16:52.189 --> 01:16:52.199 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say what uh what standards
 
01:16:54.229 --> 01:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
the judge should use in terms of what
 
01:16:56.030 --> 01:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
are the criteria if you don't need
 
01:16:58.189 --> 01:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
probable cause what are the criteria to
 
01:17:01.010 --> 01:17:01.020 align:start position:0%
get a court order it's completely vague
 
01:17:01.020 --> 01:17:02.930 align:start position:0%
get a court order it's completely vague
it

01:17:02.930 --> 01:17:02.940 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:17:06.110 --> 01:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
apparently studiously avoids saying they
 
01:17:08.209 --> 01:17:08.219 align:start position:0%
got to get a search warrant
 
01:17:08.219 --> 01:17:09.290 align:start position:0%
got to get a search warrant
um

01:17:09.290 --> 01:17:09.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:12.530 --> 01:17:12.540 align:start position:0%
um so uh and then further it creates an
 
01:17:15.350 --> 01:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
exception to that practice as vague as
 
01:17:19.189 --> 01:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
it is uh it says but a police officer if
 
01:17:21.709 --> 01:17:21.719 align:start position:0%
he has or she has exigent circumstances
 
01:17:25.790 --> 01:17:25.800 align:start position:0%
can can go ahead and uh
 
01:17:28.250 --> 01:17:28.260 align:start position:0%
engage in uh facial recognition
 
01:17:31.189 --> 01:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
surveillance uh as long as they have
 
01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
reasonable grounds to believe they could
 
01:17:34.729 --> 01:17:34.739 align:start position:0%
get a court order remember this is a
 
01:17:36.169 --> 01:17:36.179 align:start position:0%
court order that doesn't require
 
01:17:39.590 --> 01:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
probable cause now exigent circumstances
 
01:17:41.510 --> 01:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
is a term of Art in the legal World
 
01:17:43.250 --> 01:17:43.260 align:start position:0%
particularly in the criminal justice
 
01:17:45.770 --> 01:17:45.780 align:start position:0%
system there is a well-known exception
 
01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
to the warrant requirement that allows
 
01:17:51.410 --> 01:17:51.420 align:start position:0%
in exigent circumstances where there's
 
01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
no time to get a warrant and there's
 
01:17:58.090 --> 01:17:58.100 align:start position:0%
serious risks involved and
 
01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:01.020 align:start position:0%
officer has probable cause it allows the
 
01:18:02.750 --> 01:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
officer to act without getting a warrant
 
01:18:05.870 --> 01:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
the exigent circumstances exception in
 
01:18:09.350 --> 01:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
HB 499 doesn't require probable cause it
 
01:18:11.870 --> 01:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
dispenses with the critical requirement
 
01:18:14.950 --> 01:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
for use of the exigent circumstances
 
01:18:18.229 --> 01:18:18.239 align:start position:0%
exception under the Fourth Amendment uh
 
01:18:20.149 --> 01:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
the U.S Constitution and part 1 Article
 
01:18:23.450 --> 01:18:23.460 align:start position:0%
19 of the New Hampshire Constitution so
 
01:18:25.490 --> 01:18:25.500 align:start position:0%
uh there are other problems I've talked
 
01:18:28.430 --> 01:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
about in my uh written testimony what I
 
01:18:31.970 --> 01:18:31.980 align:start position:0%
think I think HB 499 has currently
 
01:18:37.010 --> 01:18:37.020 align:start position:0%
written uh is really in uh intended or
 
01:18:40.010 --> 01:18:40.020 align:start position:0%
otherwise it creates the illusion of
 
01:18:42.410 --> 01:18:42.420 align:start position:0%
imposing any kind of regulation of any
 
01:18:45.410 --> 01:18:45.420 align:start position:0%
substance on facial recognition
 
01:18:47.750 --> 01:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
in surveillance and technology and so I
 
01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
strongly oppose it that said the
 
01:18:53.510 --> 01:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
amendment uh that uh offered by uh
 
01:18:55.910 --> 01:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
representative Smith and and and and and
 
01:18:57.830 --> 01:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
chair McGuire
 
01:19:01.970 --> 01:19:01.980 align:start position:0%
um is uh I think is a as a strong effort
 
01:19:05.750 --> 01:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
to start to regulate uh uh facial
 
01:19:08.990 --> 01:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
recognition technology it's simple it's
 
01:19:13.669 --> 01:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
clear it's uh it's to the point uh it
 
01:19:16.970 --> 01:19:16.980 align:start position:0%
requires that the police get a search
 
01:19:19.750 --> 01:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
warrant supported by probable cause
 
01:19:22.550 --> 01:19:22.560 align:start position:0%
issued by a neutral and independent
 
01:19:24.850 --> 01:19:24.860 align:start position:0%
magistrate as representative Smith said
 
01:19:28.310 --> 01:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
it uh you can get warrants very quickly
 
01:19:31.430 --> 01:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
in these days of high technology
 
01:19:34.910 --> 01:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
um number one uh number two just to use
 
01:19:38.149 --> 01:19:38.159 align:start position:0%
as an example uh uh uh one of the
 
01:19:40.370 --> 01:19:40.380 align:start position:0%
members of the committee referred to uh
 
01:19:42.590 --> 01:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
the capital circumstance
 
01:19:44.209 --> 01:19:44.219 align:start position:0%
um I think representative Smith was
 
01:19:46.790 --> 01:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
right in that when people you know put
 
01:19:50.330 --> 01:19:50.340 align:start position:0%
their uh their uh uh pictures of
 
01:19:53.570 --> 01:19:53.580 align:start position:0%
themselves on social media websites or
 
01:19:56.570 --> 01:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
or have them on their cell phone and
 
01:19:59.630 --> 01:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
offer them up to friends uh you know you
 
01:20:01.189 --> 01:20:01.199 align:start position:0%
don't need a warrant because they've
 
01:20:03.410 --> 01:20:03.420 align:start position:0%
already identified themselves as in the
 
01:20:05.570 --> 01:20:05.580 align:start position:0%
picture to the extent there are other
 
01:20:07.850 --> 01:20:07.860 align:start position:0%
people in the picture committing
 
01:20:10.189 --> 01:20:10.199 align:start position:0%
offenses in the picture that are
 
01:20:12.709 --> 01:20:12.719 align:start position:0%
unidentifiable all the police would need
 
01:20:15.169 --> 01:20:15.179 align:start position:0%
to do all the D.C police would need to
 
01:20:17.570 --> 01:20:17.580 align:start position:0%
do or the FBI would need to do was get a
 
01:20:19.910 --> 01:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
warrant and say I want to use facial
 
01:20:23.390 --> 01:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
recognition technology to uh to identify
 
01:20:26.570 --> 01:20:26.580 align:start position:0%
these people and I mean I have probable
 
01:20:27.770 --> 01:20:27.780 align:start position:0%
cause to believe they're committing a
 
01:20:29.030 --> 01:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
crime because they're doing it in front
 
01:20:31.790 --> 01:20:31.800 align:start position:0%
of my very eyes in the in the video uh
 
01:20:33.950 --> 01:20:33.960 align:start position:0%
clip that I have in front of me so
 
01:20:35.510 --> 01:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
please give me a search warrant every
 
01:20:37.550 --> 01:20:37.560 align:start position:0%
judge that I've ever been in front of
 
01:20:39.890 --> 01:20:39.900 align:start position:0%
will give you a search warrant in that
 
01:20:42.169 --> 01:20:42.179 align:start position:0%
circumstance so it wouldn't get in the
 
01:20:45.590 --> 01:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
way at all of the investigation of the
 
01:20:49.189 --> 01:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
uh uh the so-called Insurrection uh
 
01:20:51.610 --> 01:20:51.620 align:start position:0%
involving the capital because a crime
 
01:20:54.709 --> 01:20:54.719 align:start position:0%
and very often with facial recognition
 
01:20:57.649 --> 01:20:57.659 align:start position:0%
technology used well you have a picture
 
01:21:01.490 --> 01:21:01.500 align:start position:0%
of somebody committing a crime so all
 
01:21:04.370 --> 01:21:04.380 align:start position:0%
you need to put in the warrant is the
 
01:21:07.010 --> 01:21:07.020 align:start position:0%
person in this picture is committing or
 
01:21:09.050 --> 01:21:09.060 align:start position:0%
has committed a crime a probable cause
 
01:21:10.790 --> 01:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
to believe that because it's right there
 
01:21:13.250 --> 01:21:13.260 align:start position:0%
in the picture please give me a warrant
 
01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
so I can use facial recognition
 
01:21:17.689 --> 01:21:17.699 align:start position:0%
technology to identify them very simple
 
01:21:20.570 --> 01:21:20.580 align:start position:0%
process and very easy to get in those
 
01:21:20.580 --> 01:21:22.550 align:start position:0%
process and very easy to get in those
circumstances

01:21:22.550 --> 01:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
01:21:26.330 --> 01:21:26.340 align:start position:0%
um uh to respond uh to uh What uh the
 
01:21:28.850 --> 01:21:28.860 align:start position:0%
question representative fellows asked
 
01:21:28.860 --> 01:21:30.050 align:start position:0%
question representative fellows asked
um

01:21:30.050 --> 01:21:30.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:32.270 --> 01:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
this wouldn't get in the way of the New
 
01:21:33.709 --> 01:21:33.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire police cooperating with
 
01:21:36.110 --> 01:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
federal agents and and working in New
 
01:21:38.510 --> 01:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire all it would require is if
 
01:21:42.590 --> 01:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
they have uh surveillance video of
 
01:21:44.750 --> 01:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
somebody involved in criminal activity
 
01:21:46.550 --> 01:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
or they have probable cause to believe
 
01:21:49.610 --> 01:21:49.620 align:start position:0%
the person in the picture is involved in
 
01:21:51.709 --> 01:21:51.719 align:start position:0%
criminal activity they'll be able to get
 
01:21:53.390 --> 01:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
a warrant
 
01:21:55.430 --> 01:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
um in New Hampshire courts
 
01:22:00.110 --> 01:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
uh so uh the beauty of uh the amendment
 
01:22:02.689 --> 01:22:02.699 align:start position:0%
offered by representative Smith and uh
 
01:22:05.570 --> 01:22:05.580 align:start position:0%
and representative McGuire is it's
 
01:22:08.510 --> 01:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
simple it's clear it uses a mechanism
 
01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
that the police are completely familiar
 
01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
with police in New Hampshire get
 
01:22:15.950 --> 01:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
warrants very quickly on a daily basis
 
01:22:19.189 --> 01:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
uh even on a nightly basis
 
01:22:22.310 --> 01:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
um waking judges up to get warrants so
 
01:22:23.750 --> 01:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
um I am
 
01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:24.470 align:start position:0%
um I am
um

01:22:24.470 --> 01:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:28.430 --> 01:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
uh I am uh I'm very much in support of
 
01:22:32.450 --> 01:22:32.460 align:start position:0%
the uh the amendment proposed to HB 499
 
01:22:34.250 --> 01:22:34.260 align:start position:0%
and I am very much
 
01:22:37.130 --> 01:22:37.140 align:start position:0%
opposed to uh the original
 
01:22:40.550 --> 01:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
um uh HB 499 and I asked the committee
 
01:22:43.490 --> 01:22:43.500 align:start position:0%
to vote ought to pass on the amendment
 
01:22:46.430 --> 01:22:46.440 align:start position:0%
to hv499 and more than willing to answer
 
01:22:48.290 --> 01:22:48.300 align:start position:0%
any questions I have representative
 
01:22:50.270 --> 01:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
Schmidt has a question for you
 
01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:52.330 align:start position:0%
Schmidt has a question for you
foreign

01:22:52.330 --> 01:22:52.340 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:22:55.370 --> 01:22:55.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you
 
01:22:58.850 --> 01:22:58.860 align:start position:0%
Professor for your uh very lucid
 
01:23:02.630 --> 01:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
testimony uh and very cogent testimony I
 
01:23:04.910 --> 01:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
have two questions one of them is a
 
01:23:06.890 --> 01:23:06.900 align:start position:0%
slight technicality and the other one is
 
01:23:10.070 --> 01:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
uh more profound I think so question
 
01:23:11.689 --> 01:23:11.699 align:start position:0%
number one
 
01:23:11.699 --> 01:23:12.350 align:start position:0%
number one
um

01:23:12.350 --> 01:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:13.729 align:start position:0%
um
you

01:23:13.729 --> 01:23:13.739 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:23:13.739 --> 01:23:14.830 align:start position:0%
you
um

01:23:14.830 --> 01:23:14.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:17.870 --> 01:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
earlier testimony was stated that the uh
 
01:23:21.890 --> 01:23:21.900 align:start position:0%
the bill only references the state but
 
01:23:26.689 --> 01:23:26.699 align:start position:0%
as I read lines 18 and 19 of the bill
 
01:23:31.130 --> 01:23:31.140 align:start position:0%
um the that's 18 and 19 on page one uh
 
01:23:35.330 --> 01:23:35.340 align:start position:0%
the um the state is defined as not only
 
01:23:37.550 --> 01:23:37.560 align:start position:0%
what we would consider consider to be
 
01:23:38.930 --> 01:23:38.940 align:start position:0%
the state that is State of New Hampshire
 
01:23:42.530 --> 01:23:42.540 align:start position:0%
but also its subdivisions namely you
 
01:23:44.990 --> 01:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
know city of Dover the police department
 
01:23:48.470 --> 01:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
of Durham you name it is that am I
 
01:23:50.750 --> 01:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
reading it correctly correct
 
01:23:53.990 --> 01:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you so the second question is more
 
01:23:56.930 --> 01:23:56.940 align:start position:0%
profound and one of the concerns that I
 
01:23:59.810 --> 01:23:59.820 align:start position:0%
have had and I had when I was the uh the
 
01:24:01.550 --> 01:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
chairman of the subcommittee that worked
 
01:24:04.550 --> 01:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
on the previous bill
 
01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
um was that uh if this if this uh if the
 
01:24:12.110 --> 01:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
statute were permitted uh permitted the
 
01:24:16.010 --> 01:24:16.020 align:start position:0%
use of safe recognition technology that
 
01:24:19.669 --> 01:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
it would be probably irresistible for
 
01:24:23.330 --> 01:24:23.340 align:start position:0%
towns uh to put up cameras
 
01:24:27.410 --> 01:24:27.420 align:start position:0%
um on the you know in the public way and
 
01:24:29.510 --> 01:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
photograph people going about their
 
01:24:32.390 --> 01:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
business engage in no crimes whatsoever
 
01:24:36.350 --> 01:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
but creating an enormous data that Trove
 
01:24:38.630 --> 01:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
that could be mined by facial
 
01:24:41.689 --> 01:24:41.699 align:start position:0%
recognition technology to identify
 
01:24:45.709 --> 01:24:45.719 align:start position:0%
everybody that was in those pictures is
 
01:24:48.290 --> 01:24:48.300 align:start position:0%
that would would that be correct in in
 
01:24:52.669 --> 01:24:52.679 align:start position:0%
your view uh no yes and no actually or
 
01:24:54.530 --> 01:24:54.540 align:start position:0%
no and yes would be the best way to put
 
01:24:58.330 --> 01:24:58.340 align:start position:0%
it uh this bill does not directly
 
01:25:02.090 --> 01:25:02.100 align:start position:0%
prohibit towns and municipalities from
 
01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
putting up cameras and recording
 
01:25:06.770 --> 01:25:06.780 align:start position:0%
everybody going about their daily
 
01:25:10.370 --> 01:25:10.380 align:start position:0%
business and putting it in a huge uh
 
01:25:13.189 --> 01:25:13.199 align:start position:0%
storage database although uh what would
 
01:25:15.229 --> 01:25:15.239 align:start position:0%
limit the towns practically speaking is
 
01:25:17.090 --> 01:25:17.100 align:start position:0%
the amount of money it would cost to
 
01:25:19.850 --> 01:25:19.860 align:start position:0%
store all that data but all those videos
 
01:25:22.850 --> 01:25:22.860 align:start position:0%
but putting that issue aside what this
 
01:25:26.330 --> 01:25:26.340 align:start position:0%
bill says is uh uh effectively to your
 
01:25:28.610 --> 01:25:28.620 align:start position:0%
question you can you can collect all
 
01:25:32.149 --> 01:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
that video you want but a 365 days a
 
01:25:34.970 --> 01:25:34.980 align:start position:0%
year 24 hours a day of people moving
 
01:25:37.370 --> 01:25:37.380 align:start position:0%
about downtown Dover right you can
 
01:25:39.410 --> 01:25:39.420 align:start position:0%
collect all of that put aside the cost
 
01:25:41.750 --> 01:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
of the storage issue but if you want to
 
01:25:43.910 --> 01:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
go in there and find out who somebody is
 
01:25:46.310 --> 01:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
you need a search warrant supported by
 
01:25:48.169 --> 01:25:48.179 align:start position:0%
probable cause issued by neutral
 
01:25:50.450 --> 01:25:50.460 align:start position:0%
independent magistrate you before you
 
01:25:53.810 --> 01:25:53.820 align:start position:0%
can use facial recognition technology to
 
01:25:55.970 --> 01:25:55.980 align:start position:0%
go in there and identify someone you
 
01:25:58.729 --> 01:25:58.739 align:start position:0%
need to establish that you have reason
 
01:26:01.250 --> 01:26:01.260 align:start position:0%
to believe you have probable cause to
 
01:26:02.870 --> 01:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
believe that a crime has been committed
 
01:26:06.229 --> 01:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
and by identifying that person uh in the
 
01:26:08.209 --> 01:26:08.219 align:start position:0%
video that you're you're showing the
 
01:26:10.370 --> 01:26:10.380 align:start position:0%
judge you would be able you would gain
 
01:26:12.709 --> 01:26:12.719 align:start position:0%
evidence uh for investigating this crime
 
01:26:15.470 --> 01:26:15.480 align:start position:0%
solving this crime so in theory you
 
01:26:17.930 --> 01:26:17.940 align:start position:0%
could create that video database but you
 
01:26:20.990 --> 01:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
can't access it just randomly and say
 
01:26:22.430 --> 01:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
hey I want to find out who that person
 
01:26:25.610 --> 01:26:25.620 align:start position:0%
is you you need to you need to get the
 
01:26:28.750 --> 01:26:28.760 align:start position:0%
warrant to access it
 
01:26:34.250 --> 01:26:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:37.910 --> 01:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
follow up Mr chair Mr Schmidt follow-up
 
01:26:40.430 --> 01:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman so the
 
01:26:42.050 --> 01:26:42.060 align:start position:0%
the scenario that we've just been
 
01:26:43.910 --> 01:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
discussing Professor
 
01:26:46.810 --> 01:26:46.820 align:start position:0%
um is is it the case that
 
01:26:50.930 --> 01:26:50.940 align:start position:0%
that that the um that the the ease of
 
01:26:54.350 --> 01:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
obtaining a warrant would be trumped by
 
01:26:58.010 --> 01:26:58.020 align:start position:0%
the the fact that this tremendous
 
01:27:00.649 --> 01:27:00.659 align:start position:0%
database that the that the the town of
 
01:27:03.530 --> 01:27:03.540 align:start position:0%
Dover hypothetically could have created
 
01:27:08.030 --> 01:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
uh by putting up a camera that the
 
01:27:10.910 --> 01:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
um that the the
 
01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:12.370 align:start position:0%
um that the the
State

01:27:12.370 --> 01:27:12.380 align:start position:0%
State
 
01:27:15.169 --> 01:27:15.179 align:start position:0%
entity in this case the police
 
01:27:17.770 --> 01:27:17.780 align:start position:0%
department of Dover or the Dover
 
01:27:22.030 --> 01:27:22.040 align:start position:0%
detectives uh the Dover courts could not
 
01:27:26.330 --> 01:27:26.340 align:start position:0%
authorize the uh the the town to begin
 
01:27:29.450 --> 01:27:29.460 align:start position:0%
to search that Trove
 
01:27:33.350 --> 01:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
um in order to see whether uh an
 
01:27:35.510 --> 01:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
individual that they're interested in
 
01:27:39.470 --> 01:27:39.480 align:start position:0%
were visible there uh could not get that
 
01:27:42.229 --> 01:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
warrant uh because they couldn't they
 
01:27:44.870 --> 01:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
couldn't demonstrate uh
 
01:27:48.169 --> 01:27:48.179 align:start position:0%
you know and initially that the person
 
01:27:51.709 --> 01:27:51.719 align:start position:0%
uh that the person was there and
 
01:27:53.810 --> 01:27:53.820 align:start position:0%
therefore they couldn't even begin to
 
01:27:56.930 --> 01:27:56.940 align:start position:0%
investigate using frd correct they
 
01:27:58.310 --> 01:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
couldn't they would have to have
 
01:28:00.649 --> 01:28:00.659 align:start position:0%
probable cause to believe that looking
 
01:28:03.590 --> 01:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
for the presence of that person in the
 
01:28:06.290 --> 01:28:06.300 align:start position:0%
massive theoretical massive database uh
 
01:28:08.930 --> 01:28:08.940 align:start position:0%
would lead to probable cause to believe
 
01:28:11.270 --> 01:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
that a crime has been or was being
 
01:28:13.610 --> 01:28:13.620 align:start position:0%
committed and that by finding this
 
01:28:16.669 --> 01:28:16.679 align:start position:0%
person in that database uh they would
 
01:28:20.030 --> 01:28:20.040 align:start position:0%
gain evidence uh uh in the investigation
 
01:28:22.970 --> 01:28:22.980 align:start position:0%
of that crime so it would be you know
 
01:28:25.010 --> 01:28:25.020 align:start position:0%
just the police scanning through this
 
01:28:28.189 --> 01:28:28.199 align:start position:0%
database to see what uh Peter Schmidt
 
01:28:31.850 --> 01:28:31.860 align:start position:0%
was doing uh the last week and just as a
 
01:28:33.290 --> 01:28:33.300 align:start position:0%
matter of you know we don't trust
 
01:28:35.570 --> 01:28:35.580 align:start position:0%
Schmidt and we want to kind of figure
 
01:28:37.610 --> 01:28:37.620 align:start position:0%
out what he's been doing they can't do
 
01:28:37.620 --> 01:28:38.510 align:start position:0%
out what he's been doing they can't do
that

01:28:38.510 --> 01:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:28:40.430 --> 01:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
they would need probable cause to
 
01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
believe that Schmidt had committed a
 
01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:44.090 align:start position:0%
believe that Schmidt had committed a
crime

01:28:44.090 --> 01:28:44.100 align:start position:0%
crime
 
01:28:46.729 --> 01:28:46.739 align:start position:0%
um and that using identifying Schmidt in
 
01:28:50.330 --> 01:28:50.340 align:start position:0%
those in those uh video uh those the
 
01:28:52.790 --> 01:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
surveillance videos would lead to
 
01:28:57.050 --> 01:28:57.060 align:start position:0%
evidence of a crime so while if once you
 
01:28:59.209 --> 01:28:59.219 align:start position:0%
have the probable cause
 
01:29:02.330 --> 01:29:02.340 align:start position:0%
it's easy to get the warrant it's not
 
01:29:05.030 --> 01:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
easy to get the probable cause it this
 
01:29:08.510 --> 01:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
bill prohibits by requiring there be the
 
01:29:10.250 --> 01:29:10.260 align:start position:0%
threshold of probable cause to be met
 
01:29:13.129 --> 01:29:13.139 align:start position:0%
this prohibits just the random scanning
 
01:29:14.810 --> 01:29:14.820 align:start position:0%
of databases
 
01:29:17.270 --> 01:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
thank you I think I'm going to continue
 
01:29:19.970 --> 01:29:19.980 align:start position:0%
the social distance in my house so that
 
01:29:21.709 --> 01:29:21.719 align:start position:0%
my face will not be out on the street
 
01:29:23.510 --> 01:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
there thank you very much for your
 
01:29:26.030 --> 01:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
testimony you're welcome thank you

Professor share is there any well we've
 
01:29:33.649 --> 01:29:33.659 align:start position:0%
run into a time constraint we are now at
 
01:29:36.050 --> 01:29:36.060 align:start position:0%
11 30. we will recess this hearing to 11
 
01:29:39.890 --> 01:29:39.900 align:start position:0%
A.M on the 18th of February I'm going to

close a public hearing on 499 in my
 
01:29:43.970 --> 01:29:43.980 align:start position:0%
apologies to the remaining three
 
01:29:47.330 --> 01:29:47.340 align:start position:0%
folks that wish to speak
 
01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
I will also be turning the chair back
 
01:29:52.310 --> 01:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
over to chair Maguire I have a question
 
01:29:53.570 --> 01:29:53.580 align:start position:0%
of the chair
 
01:29:53.580 --> 01:29:56.570 align:start position:0%
of the chair
yes

01:29:56.570 --> 01:29:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:59.330 --> 01:29:59.340 align:start position:0%
thank you I had just raised my hand
 
01:30:03.890 --> 01:30:03.900 align:start position:0%
uh for a question of Mr share will he be
 
01:30:06.290 --> 01:30:06.300 align:start position:0%
attending that recessed hearing
 
01:30:09.470 --> 01:30:09.480 align:start position:0%
I may ask my question then would you
 
01:30:11.810 --> 01:30:11.820 align:start position:0%
rather have the question now or we can
 
01:30:13.910 --> 01:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
reopen the hearing for one question I'm
 
01:30:16.250 --> 01:30:16.260 align:start position:0%
willing to answer the question now but I
 
01:30:18.350 --> 01:30:18.360 align:start position:0%
also will be at the the February 18th
 
01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:19.490 align:start position:0%
also will be at the the February 18th
hearing

01:30:19.490 --> 01:30:19.500 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:30:21.590 --> 01:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
okay I believe it's just a brief
 
01:30:23.930 --> 01:30:23.940 align:start position:0%
question Madam chair the hearing on
 
01:30:26.149 --> 01:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
House Bill 499 representative schuett
 
01:30:28.010 --> 01:30:28.020 align:start position:0%
your question
 
01:30:30.490 --> 01:30:30.500 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chair would this have any effect
 
01:30:35.090 --> 01:30:35.100 align:start position:0%
on the bodies that policers are
 
01:30:35.100 --> 01:30:35.990 align:start position:0%
on the bodies that policers are
beginning

01:30:35.990 --> 01:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
01:30:37.910 --> 01:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
where now
 
01:30:40.189 --> 01:30:40.199 align:start position:0%
well interestingly if you read my uh
 
01:30:41.930 --> 01:30:41.940 align:start position:0%
written testimony
 
01:30:45.649 --> 01:30:45.659 align:start position:0%
um uh uh there's the the one of them the
 
01:30:47.689 --> 01:30:47.699 align:start position:0%
one of the the biggest provider of body
 
01:30:50.810 --> 01:30:50.820 align:start position:0%
cams uh uh in the United States to
 
01:30:53.510 --> 01:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
police departments has made consulted
 
01:30:56.510 --> 01:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
with its uh expert ethics board an
 
01:30:59.810 --> 01:30:59.820 align:start position:0%
independent entity and that expert axon
 
01:31:01.550 --> 01:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
Corporation is the name of Corporation
 
01:31:04.910 --> 01:31:04.920 align:start position:0%
and their expert panel of scientists and
 
01:31:08.090 --> 01:31:08.100 align:start position:0%
uh ethics experts has said don't use
 
01:31:09.770 --> 01:31:09.780 align:start position:0%
this right now
 
01:31:12.950 --> 01:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
it's not reliable uh and I I go into
 
01:31:15.229 --> 01:31:15.239 align:start position:0%
more detail in that in uh my written
 
01:31:18.290 --> 01:31:18.300 align:start position:0%
testimony so uh that's where things are
 
01:31:20.209 --> 01:31:20.219 align:start position:0%
now as to body camps
 
01:31:22.610 --> 01:31:22.620 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much uh for
 
01:31:24.770 --> 01:31:24.780 align:start position:0%
taking my question and thank you madam
 
01:31:27.229 --> 01:31:27.239 align:start position:0%
chair for allowing me to ask
 
01:31:29.149 --> 01:31:29.159 align:start position:0%
thank you representative thank you
 
01:31:31.430 --> 01:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
Professor share I do hope you will be
 
01:31:34.189 --> 01:31:34.199 align:start position:0%
able to rejoin us next week uh I will do
 
01:31:39.790 --> 01:31:39.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:42.950 --> 01:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
okay reclosing the hearing on House Bill
 
01:31:46.790 --> 01:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
499 which is recessed until 11 o'clock
 
01:31:50.510 --> 01:31:50.520 align:start position:0%
on the 18th next Thursday opening the
 
01:31:54.709 --> 01:31:54.719 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 544 relative the
 
01:31:57.649 --> 01:31:57.659 align:start position:0%
propagation of divisive Concepts and I
 
01:32:01.310 --> 01:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:05.030 --> 01:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair for the record my
 
01:32:06.590 --> 01:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
name is Keith Ammon
 
01:32:09.350 --> 01:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
I represent Hillsboro District 40 which
 
01:32:11.390 --> 01:32:11.400 align:start position:0%
is the towns of New Boston
 
01:32:16.250 --> 01:32:16.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:20.330 --> 01:32:20.340 align:start position:0%
I'm introducing House Bill 544
 
01:32:23.689 --> 01:32:23.699 align:start position:0%
and I'm doing so recognizing that the
 
01:32:28.010 --> 01:32:28.020 align:start position:0%
topics the bill covers are controversial
 
01:32:31.550 --> 01:32:31.560 align:start position:0%
the origins of this bill uh
 
01:32:34.370 --> 01:32:34.380 align:start position:0%
came from the idea for the bill came
 
01:32:34.380 --> 01:32:35.750 align:start position:0%
came from the idea for the bill came
from

01:32:35.750 --> 01:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:32:37.610 --> 01:32:37.620 align:start position:0%
a professor
 
01:32:40.790 --> 01:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
at one of our state universities
 
01:32:44.750 --> 01:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
who wishes to remain anonymous
 
01:32:49.129 --> 01:32:49.139 align:start position:0%
due to fear of backlash
 
01:32:51.229 --> 01:32:51.239 align:start position:0%
so I will I will be I will not be
 
01:32:53.570 --> 01:32:53.580 align:start position:0%
divulging who that person is
 
01:32:56.870 --> 01:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
and the idea for this bill uh
 
01:32:59.450 --> 01:32:59.460 align:start position:0%
is to set policy
 
01:32:59.460 --> 01:33:01.129 align:start position:0%
is to set policy
guidelines

01:33:01.129 --> 01:33:01.139 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
01:33:01.139 --> 01:33:02.510 align:start position:0%
guidelines
for

01:33:02.510 --> 01:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:33:05.330 --> 01:33:05.340 align:start position:0%
State institutions
 
01:33:08.570 --> 01:33:08.580 align:start position:0%
and which is why House Bill 544
 
01:33:11.990 --> 01:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
amends section 10 of the rsas which
 
01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:12.890 align:start position:0%
amends section 10 of the rsas which
cover

01:33:12.890 --> 01:33:12.900 align:start position:0%
cover
 
01:33:15.950 --> 01:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
State institutions also why
 
01:33:20.810 --> 01:33:20.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:23.750 --> 01:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
the bill does not do the following
 
01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:25.669 align:start position:0%
the bill does not do the following
things

01:33:25.669 --> 01:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:33:27.350 --> 01:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
it does not apply to private
 
01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:29.090 align:start position:0%
it does not apply to private
institutions

01:33:29.090 --> 01:33:29.100 align:start position:0%
institutions
 
01:33:31.189 --> 01:33:31.199 align:start position:0%
with the caveat unless they choose to
 
01:33:33.950 --> 01:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
contract with the state Institution
 
01:33:36.470 --> 01:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
it does not ban diversity and inclusion
 
01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:38.390 align:start position:0%
it does not ban diversity and inclusion
training

01:33:38.390 --> 01:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
training
 
01:33:42.169 --> 01:33:42.179 align:start position:0%
it does not limit academic discussion
 
01:33:45.470 --> 01:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
and it does not limit free speech
 
01:33:47.510 --> 01:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
and I I will uh
 
01:33:50.689 --> 01:33:50.699 align:start position:0%
be happy to address any of those
 
01:33:53.149 --> 01:33:53.159 align:start position:0%
you can see uh
 
01:33:55.610 --> 01:33:55.620 align:start position:0%
by reading the bill that those things
 
01:33:57.770 --> 01:33:57.780 align:start position:0%
are true
 
01:34:00.830 --> 01:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
so I I understand that the committee has
 
01:34:02.990 --> 01:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
probably read the bill in advance
 
01:34:06.290 --> 01:34:06.300 align:start position:0%
but for the record I'd like to read at
 
01:34:08.270 --> 01:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
least some of the sections
 
01:34:10.070 --> 01:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
in the bill so that it is on the record
 
01:34:12.350 --> 01:34:12.360 align:start position:0%
because I think there are
 
01:34:14.209 --> 01:34:14.219 align:start position:0%
some misconceptions about this bill
 
01:34:17.090 --> 01:34:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:17.100 --> 01:34:18.110 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:34:18.110 --> 01:34:18.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:20.870 --> 01:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
this bill addresses something called
 
01:34:23.750 --> 01:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
critical race Theory
 
01:34:28.310 --> 01:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
and it is an ideology that is uh
 
01:34:31.790 --> 01:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
espoused by some people
 
01:34:34.970 --> 01:34:34.980 align:start position:0%
and the root of the ideology is that the
 
01:34:37.370 --> 01:34:37.380 align:start position:0%
United States is fundamentally racist
 
01:34:40.610 --> 01:34:40.620 align:start position:0%
and founded in racism
 
01:34:44.270 --> 01:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
and that people are born
 
01:34:47.990 --> 01:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh inherently oppressors
 
01:34:49.910 --> 01:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
and that others are born to be
 
01:34:53.030 --> 01:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
inherently oppressed so
 
01:34:55.610 --> 01:34:55.620 align:start position:0%
I'm going to turn your attention to
 
01:34:59.390 --> 01:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
uh 10 C colon one
 
01:35:01.129 --> 01:35:01.139 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral two that's the divisive
 
01:35:02.810 --> 01:35:02.820 align:start position:0%
concept lists
 
01:35:04.310 --> 01:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
and I'm just going to read through some
 
01:35:06.770 --> 01:35:06.780 align:start position:0%
of these I'll do it as uh
 
01:35:08.510 --> 01:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
in a reasonable pace so it doesn't take
 
01:35:10.250 --> 01:35:10.260 align:start position:0%
too much time
 
01:35:13.250 --> 01:35:13.260 align:start position:0%
divisive Concepts means that one race or
 
01:35:15.470 --> 01:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
sex is inherently Superior to another
 
01:35:18.410 --> 01:35:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:20.209 --> 01:35:20.219 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire or the United
 
01:35:24.050 --> 01:35:24.060 align:start position:0%
States is fundamentally racist or sexist
 
01:35:26.209 --> 01:35:26.219 align:start position:0%
an individual by virtue of his or her
 
01:35:28.430 --> 01:35:28.440 align:start position:0%
race or sex is inherently racist sexist
 
01:35:30.410 --> 01:35:30.420 align:start position:0%
or oppressive whether consciously or
 
01:35:30.420 --> 01:35:32.330 align:start position:0%
or oppressive whether consciously or
unconsciously

01:35:32.330 --> 01:35:32.340 align:start position:0%
unconsciously
 
01:35:34.430 --> 01:35:34.440 align:start position:0%
an individual should be discriminated
 
01:35:34.440 --> 01:35:35.750 align:start position:0%
an individual should be discriminated
against

01:35:35.750 --> 01:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
against
 
01:35:37.970 --> 01:35:37.980 align:start position:0%
or receive adverse treatment solely or
 
01:35:41.510 --> 01:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
partly because of his or her racer sex
 
01:35:43.850 --> 01:35:43.860 align:start position:0%
members of One race or sex cannot and
 
01:35:45.350 --> 01:35:45.360 align:start position:0%
should not attempt to treat others
 
01:35:49.430 --> 01:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
without respect to race or sex
 
01:35:51.590 --> 01:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
an individual's moral character is
 
01:35:54.830 --> 01:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily determined by his or horror
 
01:35:56.689 --> 01:35:56.699 align:start position:0%
race or sex
 
01:35:58.669 --> 01:35:58.679 align:start position:0%
an individual by virtue of his or her
 
01:36:01.070 --> 01:36:01.080 align:start position:0%
racer sex Bears responsibility for
 
01:36:03.890 --> 01:36:03.900 align:start position:0%
actions committed in the past by other
 
01:36:07.629 --> 01:36:07.639 align:start position:0%
members of the same racer sex
 
01:36:11.510 --> 01:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
meritocracy or traits such as hard work
 
01:36:14.930 --> 01:36:14.940 align:start position:0%
as a hard work ethic are racist or
 
01:36:16.970 --> 01:36:16.980 align:start position:0%
sexist and were created by a particular
 
01:36:20.930 --> 01:36:20.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:22.790 --> 01:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
and then finally the term divisive
 
01:36:24.950 --> 01:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
Concepts includes any other form of race
 
01:36:27.470 --> 01:36:27.480 align:start position:0%
or sex stereotyping or any other form of
 
01:36:30.470 --> 01:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
race or sex scapegoating and those terms
 
01:36:34.370 --> 01:36:34.380 align:start position:0%
are defined uh also in that section
 
01:36:37.370 --> 01:36:37.380 align:start position:0%
so those are the I those are the ideas
 
01:36:37.380 --> 01:36:38.209 align:start position:0%
so those are the I those are the ideas
um

01:36:38.209 --> 01:36:38.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:40.970 --> 01:36:40.980 align:start position:0%
that are termed divisive in The Spill
 
01:36:45.530 --> 01:36:45.540 align:start position:0%
because they don't unify our country or
 
01:36:48.229 --> 01:36:48.239 align:start position:0%
Society they break us up into different
 
01:36:50.629 --> 01:36:50.639 align:start position:0%
camps we know that
 
01:36:53.149 --> 01:36:53.159 align:start position:0%
in the American tradition we're all
 
01:36:53.159 --> 01:36:54.649 align:start position:0%
in the American tradition we're all
equal

01:36:54.649 --> 01:36:54.659 align:start position:0%
equal
 
01:36:57.169 --> 01:36:57.179 align:start position:0%
regardless of racer sex
 
01:37:00.410 --> 01:37:00.420 align:start position:0%
and uh though the United States was not
 
01:37:03.110 --> 01:37:03.120 align:start position:0%
perfect in the beginning
 
01:37:06.110 --> 01:37:06.120 align:start position:0%
the country has advanced to where we're
 
01:37:07.430 --> 01:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
able to talk about
 
01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:09.169 align:start position:0%
able to talk about
uh

01:37:09.169 --> 01:37:09.179 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:37:13.850 --> 01:37:13.860 align:start position:0%
a better more unity and more equality
 
01:37:17.149 --> 01:37:17.159 align:start position:0%
but these ideas are Akin you've probably
 
01:37:21.350 --> 01:37:21.360 align:start position:0%
heard the term snake oil salesman
 
01:37:23.750 --> 01:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
so there's a new industry that's popped
 
01:37:26.870 --> 01:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
up that is not regulated very well
 
01:37:28.550 --> 01:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
and I'm not asking for it to be
 
01:37:31.129 --> 01:37:31.139 align:start position:0%
regulated but it's a diversity training
 
01:37:33.490 --> 01:37:33.500 align:start position:0%
or inclusion training
 
01:37:33.500 --> 01:37:35.330 align:start position:0%
or inclusion training
and

01:37:35.330 --> 01:37:35.340 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:37:38.030 --> 01:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
there there's an aspect of that industry
 
01:37:41.629 --> 01:37:41.639 align:start position:0%
that promotes the ideas listed in the
 
01:37:43.850 --> 01:37:43.860 align:start position:0%
device of concept list
 
01:37:47.750 --> 01:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
and it's I would liken it to uh to snake
 
01:37:50.030 --> 01:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
oil as uh
 
01:37:53.510 --> 01:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
you know proposing to cure a disease but
 
01:37:55.010 --> 01:37:55.020 align:start position:0%
in actuality
 
01:37:57.649 --> 01:37:57.659 align:start position:0%
it's even making it worse
 
01:37:59.930 --> 01:37:59.940 align:start position:0%
and so as
 
01:38:02.870 --> 01:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
01:38:05.990 --> 01:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
it's our job to set policy
 
01:38:08.390 --> 01:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
for State institutions
 
01:38:12.590 --> 01:38:12.600 align:start position:0%
and what uh types of training
 
01:38:14.510 --> 01:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
are appropriate
 
01:38:17.870 --> 01:38:17.880 align:start position:0%
in the hierarchy of the state
 
01:38:17.880 --> 01:38:22.850 align:start position:0%
in the hierarchy of the state
institutions

01:38:22.850 --> 01:38:22.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:24.830 --> 01:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
so moving on the bill the requirements
 
01:38:27.169 --> 01:38:27.179 align:start position:0%
for the State of New Hampshire that's
 
01:38:29.870 --> 01:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
section 10c colon 2.
 
01:38:32.629 --> 01:38:32.639 align:start position:0%
Roman one requirements
 
01:38:34.850 --> 01:38:34.860 align:start position:0%
the bill simply bans at the State of New
 
01:38:37.189 --> 01:38:37.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the institutions under that
 
01:38:38.930 --> 01:38:38.940 align:start position:0%
umbrella shall not teach
 
01:38:40.790 --> 01:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
instruct or train any employee
 
01:38:43.970 --> 01:38:43.980 align:start position:0%
contractor or staff member student
 
01:38:46.250 --> 01:38:46.260 align:start position:0%
or any other individual group to adopt
 
01:38:49.930 --> 01:38:49.940 align:start position:0%
or believe any of the divisive Concepts
 
01:38:53.149 --> 01:38:53.159 align:start position:0%
so adopt or believe
 
01:38:57.410 --> 01:38:57.420 align:start position:0%
would be a form of advocacy
 
01:38:58.970 --> 01:38:58.980 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:39:01.189 --> 01:39:01.199 align:start position:0%
and then no employee contract or staff
 
01:39:02.450 --> 01:39:02.460 align:start position:0%
member student of the State of New
 
01:39:04.790 --> 01:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire shall face any penalty
 
01:39:06.770 --> 01:39:06.780 align:start position:0%
or discrimination on account of his or
 
01:39:08.450 --> 01:39:08.460 align:start position:0%
her refusal
 
01:39:11.149 --> 01:39:11.159 align:start position:0%
to support believe endorse Embrace
 
01:39:14.510 --> 01:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
confess act upon or otherwise ascent
 
01:39:17.689 --> 01:39:17.699 align:start position:0%
to the divisive Concepts listed
 
01:39:21.110 --> 01:39:21.120 align:start position:0%
that section B
 
01:39:23.629 --> 01:39:23.639 align:start position:0%
I think got the attention of
 
01:39:25.790 --> 01:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
our professor friend
 
01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:27.229 align:start position:0%
our professor friend
uh

01:39:27.229 --> 01:39:27.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:39:30.290 --> 01:39:30.300 align:start position:0%
that uh there is penalty and
 
01:39:33.890 --> 01:39:33.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:35.810 --> 01:39:35.820 align:start position:0%
and then this next section talks about
 
01:39:38.270 --> 01:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
requirements for contractors so
 
01:39:41.330 --> 01:39:41.340 align:start position:0%
if your tax dollars went to pay for a
 
01:39:41.340 --> 01:39:42.590 align:start position:0%
if your tax dollars went to pay for a
contractor

01:39:42.590 --> 01:39:42.600 align:start position:0%
contractor
 
01:39:45.110 --> 01:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh the one of the strings attached would
 
01:39:49.790 --> 01:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
be that they uh just would choose not to
 
01:39:52.550 --> 01:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
promote these traits within their
 
01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:55.850 align:start position:0%
promote these traits within their
organization

01:39:55.850 --> 01:39:55.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:58.970 --> 01:39:58.980 align:start position:0%
and then it talks about labor unions
 
01:40:03.169 --> 01:40:03.179 align:start position:0%
that it talks about on the next page C
 
01:40:06.050 --> 01:40:06.060 align:start position:0%
what if a contractor is not compliant
 
01:40:08.689 --> 01:40:08.699 align:start position:0%
the bill generally leaves the discretion
 
01:40:10.129 --> 01:40:10.139 align:start position:0%
up to the Department of administrative
 
01:40:12.890 --> 01:40:12.900 align:start position:0%
services to decide how
 
01:40:15.669 --> 01:40:15.679 align:start position:0%
and what um
 
01:40:18.410 --> 01:40:18.420 align:start position:0%
enforcement actions would be attached to
 
01:40:20.930 --> 01:40:20.940 align:start position:0%
this bill including with contractors and
 
01:40:20.940 --> 01:40:23.149 align:start position:0%
this bill including with contractors and
subcontractors

01:40:23.149 --> 01:40:23.159 align:start position:0%
subcontractors
 
01:40:25.129 --> 01:40:25.139 align:start position:0%
so Roman numeral three the department of
 
01:40:27.890 --> 01:40:27.900 align:start position:0%
administrative Services uh is directed
 
01:40:30.169 --> 01:40:30.179 align:start position:0%
to investigate complaints
 
01:40:32.450 --> 01:40:32.460 align:start position:0%
uh received so that's where the
 
01:40:34.850 --> 01:40:34.860 align:start position:0%
enforcement would come in and decide if
 
01:40:37.430 --> 01:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate enforcement and provide a
 
01:40:40.910 --> 01:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
remedial relief as appropriate
 
01:40:44.390 --> 01:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
section four is is uh
 
01:40:47.330 --> 01:40:47.340 align:start position:0%
a critical piece of the bill
 
01:40:50.510 --> 01:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
it directs the heads of state agencies
 
01:40:52.070 --> 01:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
to review
 
01:40:53.870 --> 01:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
Grant programs
 
01:40:56.450 --> 01:40:56.460 align:start position:0%
and identify programs for which the
 
01:40:58.310 --> 01:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
agency May
 
01:41:00.729 --> 01:41:00.739 align:start position:0%
as a requirement of the agency
 
01:41:04.610 --> 01:41:04.620 align:start position:0%
have the recipient certify that they
 
01:41:07.070 --> 01:41:07.080 align:start position:0%
are not willing to promote these
 
01:41:10.490 --> 01:41:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:12.649 --> 01:41:12.659 align:start position:0%
and then it talks about requirements for
 
01:41:12.659 --> 01:41:14.510 align:start position:0%
and then it talks about requirements for
agencies

01:41:14.510 --> 01:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
01:41:16.250 --> 01:41:16.260 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to read this line because
 
01:41:18.470 --> 01:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
it's very critical it says the fair and
 
01:41:20.090 --> 01:41:20.100 align:start position:0%
equal treatments
 
01:41:23.750 --> 01:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
of individuals is an inviable principle
 
01:41:25.910 --> 01:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
that must be maintained in the state
 
01:41:28.910 --> 01:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
workplace agencies should continue all
 
01:41:31.970 --> 01:41:31.980 align:start position:0%
training that will Foster a workplace
 
01:41:35.570 --> 01:41:35.580 align:start position:0%
that is respectful of all employees
 
01:41:37.010 --> 01:41:37.020 align:start position:0%
and then it directs the head of each
 
01:41:38.930 --> 01:41:38.940 align:start position:0%
agency to develop a policy to that
 
01:41:38.940 --> 01:41:40.070 align:start position:0%
agency to develop a policy to that
effect

01:41:40.070 --> 01:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
effect
 
01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:41.870 align:start position:0%
effect
and

01:41:41.870 --> 01:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:41:43.490 --> 01:41:43.500 align:start position:0%
it talks about the definition of
 
01:41:43.500 --> 01:41:45.590 align:start position:0%
it talks about the definition of
training

01:41:45.590 --> 01:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
training
 
01:41:47.930 --> 01:41:47.940 align:start position:0%
and then uh number two there it says
 
01:41:51.709 --> 01:41:51.719 align:start position:0%
agency diversity inclusion efforts shall
 
01:41:54.830 --> 01:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
first and foremost encourage agency
 
01:41:58.189 --> 01:41:58.199 align:start position:0%
employees not to judge each other
 
01:42:01.729 --> 01:42:01.739 align:start position:0%
by their Color Race ethnicity sex or any
 
01:42:03.229 --> 01:42:03.239 align:start position:0%
other characteristic protected by
 
01:42:05.870 --> 01:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
federal or state law
 
01:42:08.570 --> 01:42:08.580 align:start position:0%
and that the commissioner of
 
01:42:09.890 --> 01:42:09.900 align:start position:0%
the department of administrative
 
01:42:12.470 --> 01:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
Services shall develop regulations for
 
01:42:14.090 --> 01:42:14.100 align:start position:0%
the enforcement of the provisions of
 
01:42:16.370 --> 01:42:16.380 align:start position:0%
this statute
 
01:42:18.830 --> 01:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
so I I won't I won't belabor the rest of
 
01:42:20.990 --> 01:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
the points here
 
01:42:22.970 --> 01:42:22.980 align:start position:0%
but I do want to turn your attention to
 
01:42:25.310 --> 01:42:25.320 align:start position:0%
the general Provisions section
 
01:42:27.109 --> 01:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
it says nothing in this chapter shall
 
01:42:29.750 --> 01:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
prevent agencies or contractors
 
01:42:32.270 --> 01:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
from promoting racial cultural or ethnic
 
01:42:34.129 --> 01:42:34.139 align:start position:0%
diversity or inclusiveness
 
01:42:36.590 --> 01:42:36.600 align:start position:0%
provided such efforts are consistent
 
01:42:39.470 --> 01:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
with the requirements of this chapter
 
01:42:41.209 --> 01:42:41.219 align:start position:0%
Roman 2 says nothing in this chapter
 
01:42:42.350 --> 01:42:42.360 align:start position:0%
shall be construed to prohibit
 
01:42:44.990 --> 01:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
discussing as part of a larger course of
 
01:42:47.629 --> 01:42:47.639 align:start position:0%
academic instruction the divisive
 
01:42:49.370 --> 01:42:49.380 align:start position:0%
Concepts listed
 
01:42:51.470 --> 01:42:51.480 align:start position:0%
but they'd have to be done so in an
 
01:42:53.990 --> 01:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
objective manner without endorsement
 
01:42:55.550 --> 01:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
again that's
 
01:42:57.709 --> 01:42:57.719 align:start position:0%
the endorsement part is trying to
 
01:42:59.870 --> 01:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
convince other people to believe
 
01:43:02.209 --> 01:43:02.219 align:start position:0%
in the divisive Concepts using your
 
01:43:05.870 --> 01:43:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:08.390 --> 01:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:43:10.910 --> 01:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
I would ask that any opponents of this
 
01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:12.590 align:start position:0%
I would ask that any opponents of this
bill

01:43:12.590 --> 01:43:12.600 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:43:14.629 --> 01:43:14.639 align:start position:0%
you would ask them which of the divisive
 
01:43:16.790 --> 01:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
Concepts they support
 
01:43:19.850 --> 01:43:19.860 align:start position:0%
I think that would be a key question
 
01:43:23.270 --> 01:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
and this bill is really a bill about uh
 
01:43:27.169 --> 01:43:27.179 align:start position:0%
about Unity that we're all equal
 
01:43:30.070 --> 01:43:30.080 align:start position:0%
and with that I'll take any questions
 
01:43:32.390 --> 01:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz
 
01:43:34.669 --> 01:43:34.679 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I actually have a
 
01:43:37.250 --> 01:43:37.260 align:start position:0%
couple more than one question Madam
 
01:43:39.050 --> 01:43:39.060 align:start position:0%
chair depending on his answers if that's
 
01:43:39.060 --> 01:43:40.729 align:start position:0%
chair depending on his answers if that's
okay

01:43:40.729 --> 01:43:40.739 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:43:45.109 --> 01:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
yes okay uh representative Ammon
 
01:43:48.729 --> 01:43:48.739 align:start position:0%
um do you believe that systemic racism
 
01:43:53.930 --> 01:43:53.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:56.270 --> 01:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
do I believe that it's systemic does
 
01:43:58.310 --> 01:43:58.320 align:start position:0%
that mean the system is inherently
 
01:44:00.709 --> 01:44:00.719 align:start position:0%
racist is that the question does
 
01:44:03.169 --> 01:44:03.179 align:start position:0%
systemic racism exist can you define
 
01:44:03.179 --> 01:44:04.370 align:start position:0%
systemic racism exist can you define
systemic

01:44:04.370 --> 01:44:04.380 align:start position:0%
systemic
 
01:44:04.380 --> 01:44:06.070 align:start position:0%
systemic
uh

01:44:06.070 --> 01:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:44:10.970 --> 01:44:10.980 align:start position:0%
systemic would be that uh the remnants
 
01:44:16.490 --> 01:44:16.500 align:start position:0%
of slavery and racist beliefs have been
 
01:44:21.669 --> 01:44:21.679 align:start position:0%
codified and normalized in existing
 
01:44:24.709 --> 01:44:24.719 align:start position:0%
systems of government and business and
 
01:44:27.890 --> 01:44:27.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:33.229 --> 01:44:33.239 align:start position:0%
no no it exists nowhere no I'm saying
 
01:44:35.149 --> 01:44:35.159 align:start position:0%
it's not systemic it does exist there
 
01:44:37.609 --> 01:44:37.619 align:start position:0%
are vestiges of it and our country has
 
01:44:39.709 --> 01:44:39.719 align:start position:0%
done a very good job rooting out those
 
01:44:42.229 --> 01:44:42.239 align:start position:0%
last messages but do I think that the
 
01:44:44.330 --> 01:44:44.340 align:start position:0%
structure of our country is racist by
 
01:44:45.709 --> 01:44:45.719 align:start position:0%
Design no
 
01:44:48.010 --> 01:44:48.020 align:start position:0%
so do you acknowledge the
 
01:44:50.090 --> 01:44:50.100 align:start position:0%
institutionalized racism of the
 
01:44:51.890 --> 01:44:51.900 align:start position:0%
Three-Fifths Compromise of the
 
01:44:53.689 --> 01:44:53.699 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Convention of the United
 
01:44:53.699 --> 01:44:55.430 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Convention of the United
States

01:44:55.430 --> 01:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
States
 
01:44:55.440 --> 01:44:58.729 align:start position:0%
States
itself

01:44:58.729 --> 01:44:58.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:00.709 --> 01:45:00.719 align:start position:0%
could you familiarize me with that is
 
01:45:05.270 --> 01:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:09.649 --> 01:45:09.659 align:start position:0%
that has been uh rectified since
 
01:45:12.590 --> 01:45:12.600 align:start position:0%
and it slavery is one of the original
 
01:45:14.810 --> 01:45:14.820 align:start position:0%
sins of our country
 
01:45:17.270 --> 01:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
but the design of the country the Divine
 
01:45:18.590 --> 01:45:18.600 align:start position:0%
Design of the institutions of the
 
01:45:18.600 --> 01:45:19.550 align:start position:0%
Design of the institutions of the
country

01:45:19.550 --> 01:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:45:22.490 --> 01:45:22.500 align:start position:0%
have allowed our country to evolve
 
01:45:24.950 --> 01:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
into and and to rectify those sins of
 
01:45:27.649 --> 01:45:27.659 align:start position:0%
the past so it's that proves that it's
 
01:45:29.450 --> 01:45:29.460 align:start position:0%
not uh
 
01:45:31.250 --> 01:45:31.260 align:start position:0%
by Design
 
01:45:32.750 --> 01:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
I think it proves the opposite of your
 
01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:34.030 align:start position:0%
I think it proves the opposite of your
point

01:45:34.030 --> 01:45:34.040 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:45:36.350 --> 01:45:36.360 align:start position:0%
interesting I have so many more
 
01:45:37.669 --> 01:45:37.679 align:start position:0%
questions but I know there are other
 
01:45:39.770 --> 01:45:39.780 align:start position:0%
people that want to ask questions I just
 
01:45:43.669 --> 01:45:43.679 align:start position:0%
uh there's just one comes to mind as
 
01:45:45.709 --> 01:45:45.719 align:start position:0%
well because your bill also addresses
 
01:45:45.719 --> 01:45:47.990 align:start position:0%
well because your bill also addresses
sexuality

01:45:47.990 --> 01:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
sexuality
 
01:45:51.050 --> 01:45:51.060 align:start position:0%
um IT addresses sex so that would be a
 
01:45:52.390 --> 01:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
biological definition
 
01:45:54.890 --> 01:45:54.900 align:start position:0%
biological and gender
 
01:45:57.470 --> 01:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
it does not address gender
 
01:46:02.390 --> 01:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
so that's interesting is there specific
 
01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:04.609 align:start position:0%
so that's interesting is there specific
um

01:46:04.609 --> 01:46:04.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:08.330 --> 01:46:08.340 align:start position:0%
sexual uh biological sex then that you
 
01:46:10.189 --> 01:46:10.199 align:start position:0%
are concerned about here does that mean
 
01:46:14.050 --> 01:46:14.060 align:start position:0%
intersex or people born with different
 
01:46:16.430 --> 01:46:16.440 align:start position:0%
chromosomal differences that are not
 
01:46:19.010 --> 01:46:19.020 align:start position:0%
binary that are that kind of biology it
 
01:46:20.510 --> 01:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't address any of that addresses
 
01:46:22.010 --> 01:46:22.020 align:start position:0%
whether you're male or female and that
 
01:46:23.930 --> 01:46:23.940 align:start position:0%
would be your biological sex
 
01:46:26.149 --> 01:46:26.159 align:start position:0%
okay one more even though I probably
 
01:46:28.189 --> 01:46:28.199 align:start position:0%
could ask a hundred more
 
01:46:28.199 --> 01:46:29.810 align:start position:0%
could ask a hundred more
um

01:46:29.810 --> 01:46:29.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:36.910 --> 01:46:36.920 align:start position:0%
uh so it uh doesn't bother you that uh
 
01:46:41.109 --> 01:46:41.119 align:start position:0%
researchers have shown that modern day
 
01:46:45.290 --> 01:46:45.300 align:start position:0%
Society in America has inherent
 
01:46:48.709 --> 01:46:48.719 align:start position:0%
bias against people for a number of
 
01:46:51.649 --> 01:46:51.659 align:start position:0%
reasons including race and biological
 
01:46:51.659 --> 01:46:53.689 align:start position:0%
reasons including race and biological
sex

01:46:53.689 --> 01:46:53.699 align:start position:0%
sex
 
01:46:57.229 --> 01:46:57.239 align:start position:0%
yes and that's why this bill uh
 
01:46:59.870 --> 01:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
eliminates that or attempts to eliminate
 
01:47:01.430 --> 01:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
that and put the discussion on a Level
 
01:47:04.990 --> 01:47:05.000 align:start position:0%
Playing Field that people shouldn't be
 
01:47:07.370 --> 01:47:07.380 align:start position:0%
biased against because of their racer
 
01:47:10.669 --> 01:47:10.679 align:start position:0%
sex those that that that idea is
 
01:47:14.930 --> 01:47:14.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:16.729 --> 01:47:16.739 align:start position:0%
I have so many more questions but I
 
01:47:18.830 --> 01:47:18.840 align:start position:0%
don't want to monopolize thank you
 
01:47:20.870 --> 01:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz I think
 
01:47:30.550 --> 01:47:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:34.189 --> 01:47:34.199 align:start position:0%
you'll have to unmute yourself okay yes
 
01:47:36.950 --> 01:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm sorry about that Madam
 
01:47:41.149 --> 01:47:41.159 align:start position:0%
chair uh so I'm going to ask you a sweet
 
01:47:45.229 --> 01:47:45.239 align:start position:0%
question are you are racist
 
01:47:50.090 --> 01:47:50.100 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry if you are a racist person
 
01:47:51.770 --> 01:47:51.780 align:start position:0%
I'm really sorry I don't understand
 
01:47:53.629 --> 01:47:53.639 align:start position:0%
religious person
 
01:47:57.109 --> 01:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
no no this this is
 
01:48:00.950 --> 01:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
am I a racist person yes
 
01:48:02.870 --> 01:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
I don't believe so and I'll tell you a
 
01:48:04.970 --> 01:48:04.980 align:start position:0%
little reason why I don't believe that
 
01:48:04.980 --> 01:48:06.050 align:start position:0%
little reason why I don't believe that
um

01:48:06.050 --> 01:48:06.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:08.930 --> 01:48:08.940 align:start position:0%
I was raised in a faith uh it's called
 
01:48:11.149 --> 01:48:11.159 align:start position:0%
the Jehovah's Witness faith
 
01:48:14.209 --> 01:48:14.219 align:start position:0%
and it's probably the most integrated uh
 
01:48:14.219 --> 01:48:16.010 align:start position:0%
and it's probably the most integrated uh
congregation

01:48:16.010 --> 01:48:16.020 align:start position:0%
congregation
 
01:48:17.810 --> 01:48:17.820 align:start position:0%
and it's an international congregation
 
01:48:17.820 --> 01:48:18.770 align:start position:0%
and it's an international congregation
so

01:48:18.770 --> 01:48:18.780 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:48:21.050 --> 01:48:21.060 align:start position:0%
uh when I was growing up
 
01:48:21.060 --> 01:48:22.370 align:start position:0%
uh when I was growing up
uh

01:48:22.370 --> 01:48:22.380 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:48:24.709 --> 01:48:24.719 align:start position:0%
we regularly had
 
01:48:29.090 --> 01:48:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:31.729 --> 01:48:31.739 align:start position:0%
and so that's my experience that's the
 
01:48:34.370 --> 01:48:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:39.410 --> 01:48:39.420 align:start position:0%
and promoting divisions is toxic to that
 
01:48:44.109 --> 01:48:44.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:48.669 --> 01:48:48.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:53.149 --> 01:48:53.159 align:start position:0%
uh I received so many emails
 
01:48:56.209 --> 01:48:56.219 align:start position:0%
by my constituents in New Hampshire
 
01:48:59.030 --> 01:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
around New Hampshire
 
01:49:02.510 --> 01:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:02.520 --> 01:49:04.010 align:start position:0%
 
firmly

01:49:04.010 --> 01:49:04.020 align:start position:0%
firmly
 
01:49:06.229 --> 01:49:06.239 align:start position:0%
to be against
 
01:49:09.070 --> 01:49:09.080 align:start position:0%
this bill HB

544 okay
 
01:49:14.870 --> 01:49:14.880 align:start position:0%

01:49:28.310 --> 01:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:30.950 --> 01:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
why the person you mean the professor
 
01:49:32.950 --> 01:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
professor yes yes
 
01:49:35.990 --> 01:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh she or he is worried about
 
01:49:38.390 --> 01:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
retribution and losing their job for
 
01:49:40.310 --> 01:49:40.320 align:start position:0%
advocating this

I'll read you
 
01:49:47.090 --> 01:49:47.100 align:start position:0%
a piece of any of an email that I
 
01:49:47.100 --> 01:49:49.010 align:start position:0%
a piece of any of an email that I
received

01:49:49.010 --> 01:49:49.020 align:start position:0%
received
 
01:49:53.149 --> 01:49:53.159 align:start position:0%
and this person made emphasis uh I am
 
01:49:55.310 --> 01:49:55.320 align:start position:0%
required to inform you that I am a
 
01:49:55.320 --> 01:49:56.510 align:start position:0%
required to inform you that I am a
professor

01:49:56.510 --> 01:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
professor
 
01:49:58.609 --> 01:49:58.619 align:start position:0%
at XYZ
 
01:50:01.189 --> 01:50:01.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Public University
 
01:50:04.370 --> 01:50:04.380 align:start position:0%
and and I'm I'm redacting that

but I'm writing to you as a private
 
01:50:09.470 --> 01:50:09.480 align:start position:0%
citizen on behalf and not on behalf of
 
01:50:11.750 --> 01:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
XYZ private university
 
01:50:13.729 --> 01:50:13.739 align:start position:0%
and the reason that they don't want to
 
01:50:15.109 --> 01:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
be known is because they're worried
 
01:50:17.390 --> 01:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
about losing their job
 
01:50:19.330 --> 01:50:19.340 align:start position:0%

Freedom really doesn't exist or losing
it

01:50:24.109 --> 01:50:24.119 align:start position:0%

01:50:26.209 --> 01:50:26.219 align:start position:0%

01:50:39.109 --> 01:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:44.570 --> 01:50:44.580 align:start position:0%

right now I'm okay right now
 
01:51:04.129 --> 01:51:04.139 align:start position:0%

01:51:05.870 --> 01:51:05.880 align:start position:0%
he knows
 
01:51:10.189 --> 01:51:10.199 align:start position:0%
what he's wearing here it's one
 
01:51:13.070 --> 01:51:13.080 align:start position:0%
uh representative Judy you can't assume
 
01:51:22.189 --> 01:51:22.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:22.199 --> 01:51:22.850 align:start position:0%

01:51:44.990 --> 01:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
I don't think
 
01:51:46.729 --> 01:51:46.739 align:start position:0%
breaking the eggs
 
01:51:49.370 --> 01:51:49.380 align:start position:0%
will be good for anyways
 
01:51:56.830 --> 01:51:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:59.450 --> 01:51:59.460 align:start position:0%
may I ask a question
 
01:52:01.550 --> 01:52:01.560 align:start position:0%

01:52:26.590 --> 01:52:26.600 align:start position:0%

you welcome me so thank you sir
 
01:52:36.950 --> 01:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:39.470 --> 01:52:39.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
01:52:42.250 --> 01:52:42.260 align:start position:0%
representative for uh taking my question
 
01:52:46.729 --> 01:52:46.739 align:start position:0%
uh I am kind of concerned uh with my
 
01:52:49.669 --> 01:52:49.679 align:start position:0%
background and I'm uh
 
01:52:53.510 --> 01:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
and let me preface by saying uh most of
 
01:52:56.530 --> 01:52:56.540 align:start position:0%
the Union contracts that are established
 
01:53:00.950 --> 01:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh one of the first articles uh or the
 
01:53:03.470 --> 01:53:03.480 align:start position:0%
second article within the agreement or
 
01:53:05.930 --> 01:53:05.940 align:start position:0%
at some point it does say it will buy by
 
01:53:08.810 --> 01:53:08.820 align:start position:0%
the laws the U.S constitutions and by
 
01:53:11.330 --> 01:53:11.340 align:start position:0%
the laws of that particular state
 
01:53:15.709 --> 01:53:15.719 align:start position:0%
taking that into account looking at what
 
01:53:18.470 --> 01:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
you are submitting here from line on
 
01:53:23.990 --> 01:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
page two line 36 down to line 18 you
 
01:53:25.870 --> 01:53:25.880 align:start position:0%
have gotten quite
 
01:53:29.270 --> 01:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
explicit in going into some of the
 
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
things with the uh Union uh contracts
 
01:53:35.209 --> 01:53:35.219 align:start position:0%
most of the unions
 
01:53:39.169 --> 01:53:39.179 align:start position:0%
believe in uh cohesive bonding of a
 
01:53:41.810 --> 01:53:41.820 align:start position:0%
Brotherhood or Sisterhood do you feel
 
01:53:45.709 --> 01:53:45.719 align:start position:0%
that this current bill could jeopardize
 
01:53:48.649 --> 01:53:48.659 align:start position:0%
that in particular and if I could have
 
01:53:50.750 --> 01:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
your opinions of that thank you madam
 
01:53:50.760 --> 01:53:53.629 align:start position:0%
your opinions of that thank you madam
chair

01:53:53.629 --> 01:53:53.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:56.090 --> 01:53:56.100 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for the question
 
01:53:58.310 --> 01:53:58.320 align:start position:0%
um I've never been in a union so I can't
 
01:54:01.310 --> 01:54:01.320 align:start position:0%
speak from experience on that um
 
01:54:03.350 --> 01:54:03.360 align:start position:0%
the idea is generally that state money
 
01:54:06.109 --> 01:54:06.119 align:start position:0%
if it went to fund a union that
 
01:54:07.910 --> 01:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
they would follow these basic guidelines
 
01:54:09.590 --> 01:54:09.600 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
01:54:11.450 --> 01:54:11.460 align:start position:0%
uh you shouldn't be discriminated
 
01:54:13.729 --> 01:54:13.739 align:start position:0%
against based on race or sex
 
01:54:15.530 --> 01:54:15.540 align:start position:0%
if they're already doing that then maybe
 
01:54:17.090 --> 01:54:17.100 align:start position:0%
that's not
 
01:54:22.310 --> 01:54:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh a requirement in the bill the the
 
01:54:23.810 --> 01:54:23.820 align:start position:0%
I think the fundamental piece in the
 
01:54:27.410 --> 01:54:27.420 align:start position:0%
bill is State institutions and that the
 
01:54:29.990 --> 01:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
contractors the unions are kind of a
 
01:54:31.870 --> 01:54:31.880 align:start position:0%
secondary aspect
 
01:54:34.729 --> 01:54:34.739 align:start position:0%
and mainly because they
 
01:54:37.910 --> 01:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
receive funding from State institutions
 
01:54:42.950 --> 01:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
and they operate at the requests
 
01:54:46.310 --> 01:54:46.320 align:start position:0%
and direction of State institutions
 
01:54:48.890 --> 01:54:48.900 align:start position:0%
in in the capacity of performing a
 
01:54:50.629 --> 01:54:50.639 align:start position:0%
function for the state
 
01:54:52.609 --> 01:54:52.619 align:start position:0%
does that make sense
 
01:54:55.129 --> 01:54:55.139 align:start position:0%
it does and if I may follow up Madam
 
01:54:58.430 --> 01:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:58.440 --> 01:54:59.209 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:54:59.209 --> 01:54:59.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:02.450 --> 01:55:02.460 align:start position:0%
you you mentioned that the unions
 
01:55:04.970 --> 01:55:04.980 align:start position:0%
receive funding and just as a point of
 
01:55:08.030 --> 01:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
correction in my knowledge that I
 
01:55:11.330 --> 01:55:11.340 align:start position:0%
believe that there is no funding from
 
01:55:13.729 --> 01:55:13.739 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire into any of
 
01:55:15.830 --> 01:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
the unions that have any collective
 
01:55:17.990 --> 01:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
bargainings in the state they are
 
01:55:21.350 --> 01:55:21.360 align:start position:0%
independent and they're under the laws
 
01:55:23.689 --> 01:55:23.699 align:start position:0%
Guided by the state of New Hampshire but
 
01:55:26.810 --> 01:55:26.820 align:start position:0%
there is no funding mechanism I see
 
01:55:30.290 --> 01:55:30.300 align:start position:0%
you know I'm I'm open to uh
 
01:55:31.970 --> 01:55:31.980 align:start position:0%
improving the bill so if that's
 
01:55:34.010 --> 01:55:34.020 align:start position:0%
something that can be improved by
 
01:55:35.629 --> 01:55:35.639 align:start position:0%
leaving that out
 
01:55:37.790 --> 01:55:37.800 align:start position:0%
um you know I would be open to that
 
01:55:39.590 --> 01:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you madam chair
 
01:55:40.790 --> 01:55:40.800 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of other people with
 
01:55:43.850 --> 01:55:43.860 align:start position:0%
questions I'll yield thank you yes
 
01:55:48.470 --> 01:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh speaking of that it is almost noon we
 
01:55:50.270 --> 01:55:50.280 align:start position:0%
will complete the questions for
 
01:55:54.050 --> 01:55:54.060 align:start position:0%
representative Anna and then recess this
 
01:55:58.910 --> 01:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
hearing until 1 30 on Thursday the 18th
 
01:56:01.609 --> 01:56:01.619 align:start position:0%
and I apologize to all the people that
 
01:56:04.310 --> 01:56:04.320 align:start position:0%
came out for it but this bill is much
 
01:56:06.350 --> 01:56:06.360 align:start position:0%
more complicated than it seemed at the
 
01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:07.790 align:start position:0%
more complicated than it seemed at the
beginning

01:56:07.790 --> 01:56:07.800 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
01:56:09.530 --> 01:56:09.540 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt you have a
 
01:56:09.540 --> 01:56:13.729 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt you have a
question

01:56:13.729 --> 01:56:13.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:16.030 --> 01:56:16.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair indeed I do
 
01:56:18.109 --> 01:56:18.119 align:start position:0%
representative Ammon thank you for being
 
01:56:20.510 --> 01:56:20.520 align:start position:0%
with us this morning I read your bill
 
01:56:24.470 --> 01:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
carefully and I see that that it makes a
 
01:56:28.850 --> 01:56:28.860 align:start position:0%
number of categorical statements
 
01:56:34.129 --> 01:56:34.139 align:start position:0%
um which I think are unarguable uh that
 
01:56:36.310 --> 01:56:36.320 align:start position:0%
in the absolute
 
01:56:39.709 --> 01:56:39.719 align:start position:0%
the uh the statement that no one is
 
01:56:41.870 --> 01:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
better or worse because of their gender
 
01:56:45.649 --> 01:56:45.659 align:start position:0%
their race uh their sex and uh their
 
01:56:49.930 --> 01:56:49.940 align:start position:0%
origin whatever uh but so the the the
 
01:56:53.030 --> 01:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
categorical statements
 
01:56:56.270 --> 01:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
so if if the um
 
01:57:00.590 --> 01:57:00.600 align:start position:0%
if the uh if the bill is passed uh can
 
01:57:03.649 --> 01:57:03.659 align:start position:0%
it actually contribute to a an
 
01:57:05.689 --> 01:57:05.699 align:start position:0%
improvement of the situation that we
 
01:57:07.970 --> 01:57:07.980 align:start position:0%
currently find ourselves in because your
 
01:57:10.609 --> 01:57:10.619 align:start position:0%
earlier testimony does say
 
01:57:13.729 --> 01:57:13.739 align:start position:0%
uh that you recognize that there there
 
01:57:17.870 --> 01:57:17.880 align:start position:0%
is racism sexism ageism and so forth out
 
01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:19.189 align:start position:0%
is racism sexism ageism and so forth out
there

01:57:19.189 --> 01:57:19.199 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:57:22.089 --> 01:57:22.099 align:start position:0%
um that that Society is working on
 
01:57:24.709 --> 01:57:24.719 align:start position:0%
uh but
 
01:57:27.970 --> 01:57:27.980 align:start position:0%
do you really feel that that your bill
 
01:57:31.729 --> 01:57:31.739 align:start position:0%
provides a modality for to for getting
 
01:57:34.970 --> 01:57:34.980 align:start position:0%
to a better uh situation and a better
 
01:57:39.470 --> 01:57:39.480 align:start position:0%
process than we are currently engaged in
 
01:57:41.390 --> 01:57:41.400 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for the question
 
01:57:41.400 --> 01:57:42.470 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for the question
um

01:57:42.470 --> 01:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:48.890 --> 01:57:48.900 align:start position:0%
I think this puts guidelines on uh what
 
01:57:51.830 --> 01:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
what are the limits especially under
 
01:57:54.229 --> 01:57:54.239 align:start position:0%
the auspices of the state apparatus
 
01:57:56.350 --> 01:57:56.360 align:start position:0%
that's really what this is about
 
01:58:01.010 --> 01:58:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:01.020 --> 01:58:02.930 align:start position:0%
 
in

01:58:02.930 --> 01:58:02.940 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:58:06.250 --> 01:58:06.260 align:start position:0%
presuming that someone has
 
01:58:09.770 --> 01:58:09.780 align:start position:0%
uh someone was born
 
01:58:12.229 --> 01:58:12.239 align:start position:0%
to be an oppressor that's really like
 
01:58:14.330 --> 01:58:14.340 align:start position:0%
the underlying thing of this
 
01:58:17.870 --> 01:58:17.880 align:start position:0%
or someone was born to be oppressed
 
01:58:20.030 --> 01:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
uh because of the racer sex that's the
 
01:58:22.010 --> 01:58:22.020 align:start position:0%
underlying thing if that's the
 
01:58:24.050 --> 01:58:24.060 align:start position:0%
assumption that we're going to make as a
 
01:58:27.229 --> 01:58:27.239 align:start position:0%
society then I think we never get to
 
01:58:27.239 --> 01:58:29.570 align:start position:0%
society then I think we never get to
Unity

01:58:29.570 --> 01:58:29.580 align:start position:0%
Unity
 
01:58:32.810 --> 01:58:32.820 align:start position:0%
um and so that these this this list
 
01:58:35.450 --> 01:58:35.460 align:start position:0%
is a set of guidelines on what's
 
01:58:35.460 --> 01:58:37.070 align:start position:0%
is a set of guidelines on what's
appropriate

01:58:37.070 --> 01:58:37.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
01:58:41.330 --> 01:58:41.340 align:start position:0%
in in state institutions for having that
 
01:58:41.340 --> 01:58:43.910 align:start position:0%
in in state institutions for having that
discussion

01:58:43.910 --> 01:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:45.470 --> 01:58:45.480 align:start position:0%
does that make sense
 
01:58:47.930 --> 01:58:47.940 align:start position:0%
it does you you realize we're up against
 
01:58:49.669 --> 01:58:49.679 align:start position:0%
the time deadline here are you wanting
 
01:58:51.890 --> 01:58:51.900 align:start position:0%
to come back because this is a this is a
 
01:58:54.589 --> 01:58:54.599 align:start position:0%
colloquy that needs to continue in your
 
01:58:56.089 --> 01:58:56.099 align:start position:0%
testimony and helping us to understand
 
01:58:58.609 --> 01:58:58.619 align:start position:0%
your bill and your purpose is important
 
01:59:01.010 --> 01:59:01.020 align:start position:0%
can you come back when the bill whiz uh
 
01:59:03.770 --> 01:59:03.780 align:start position:0%
is taken up again I'd be happy to and
 
01:59:05.990 --> 01:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm acknowledging that this is a
 
01:59:07.609 --> 01:59:07.619 align:start position:0%
difficult discussion
 
01:59:10.330 --> 01:59:10.340 align:start position:0%
uh and I
 
01:59:12.709 --> 01:59:12.719 align:start position:0%
appreciate the intellect of everyone on
 
01:59:16.850 --> 01:59:16.860 align:start position:0%
the committee to look at this issue and
 
01:59:20.290 --> 01:59:20.300 align:start position:0%
decide what policies should be in place
 
01:59:20.300 --> 01:59:21.890 align:start position:0%
decide what policies should be in place
for

01:59:21.890 --> 01:59:21.900 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:59:24.070 --> 01:59:24.080 align:start position:0%
you know this the state agencies
 
01:59:27.530 --> 01:59:27.540 align:start position:0%
especially so thank you
 
01:59:29.750 --> 01:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:59:31.729 --> 01:59:31.739 align:start position:0%
thank you representative and then are
 
01:59:33.350 --> 01:59:33.360 align:start position:0%
there other questions for representative
 
01:59:37.370 --> 01:59:37.380 align:start position:0%
Ammon before we uh we close I don't care
 
01:59:39.350 --> 01:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to reiterate what Peter
 
01:59:41.330 --> 01:59:41.340 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt was saying I
 
01:59:43.669 --> 01:59:43.679 align:start position:0%
would really appreciate if the sponsors
 
01:59:46.310 --> 01:59:46.320 align:start position:0%
could join us when we reconvene whatever
 
01:59:48.770 --> 01:59:48.780 align:start position:0%
day and time that will be because I
 
01:59:50.450 --> 01:59:50.460 align:start position:0%
think we may have more questions for
 
01:59:50.460 --> 01:59:51.589 align:start position:0%
think we may have more questions for
them

01:59:51.589 --> 01:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:59:53.689 --> 01:59:53.699 align:start position:0%

hands repeatedly I am not going to

03:15:18.830 --> 03:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
Aesthetics without a license
 
03:15:22.490 --> 03:15:22.500 align:start position:0%
if if it is not 4K
 
03:15:26.450 --> 03:15:26.460 align:start position:0%
uh this came out during the early stages
 
03:15:29.450 --> 03:15:29.460 align:start position:0%
of the shutdown in March and April when
 
03:15:31.670 --> 03:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
barber shops and beauty salons were
 
03:15:34.370 --> 03:15:34.380 align:start position:0%
declared to be non-essential
 
03:15:36.469 --> 03:15:36.479 align:start position:0%
and a lot of us started looking awfully
 
03:15:40.849 --> 03:15:40.859 align:start position:0%
Shaggy and others uh illegally
 
03:15:43.849 --> 03:15:43.859 align:start position:0%
went to a friend and got their haircut
 
03:15:43.859 --> 03:15:45.530 align:start position:0%
went to a friend and got their haircut
and

03:15:45.530 --> 03:15:45.540 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:15:49.990 --> 03:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
that generated a fair amount of
 
03:15:52.790 --> 03:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
ridiculed that they were being criminals
 
03:15:54.769 --> 03:15:54.779 align:start position:0%
by getting their hair cut by a neighbor
 
03:15:56.830 --> 03:15:56.840 align:start position:0%
instead of a
 
03:15:59.030 --> 03:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
licensed professional
 
03:16:04.130 --> 03:16:04.140 align:start position:0%
and right now our our laws do not make
 
03:16:06.950 --> 03:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
any exceptions whatsoever on this
 
03:16:10.130 --> 03:16:10.140 align:start position:0%
criminality it is a crime for a group of
 
03:16:12.610 --> 03:16:12.620 align:start position:0%
pre-teen girls to get together
 
03:16:15.230 --> 03:16:15.240 align:start position:0%
it is a crime to cut your baby's
 
03:16:15.240 --> 03:16:16.809 align:start position:0%
it is a crime to cut your baby's
fingernails

03:16:16.809 --> 03:16:16.819 align:start position:0%
fingernails
 
03:16:20.630 --> 03:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
and so as long this bill simply says if
 
03:16:22.010 --> 03:16:22.020 align:start position:0%
you're not getting paid
 
03:16:24.230 --> 03:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
it's not a crime
 
03:16:26.990 --> 03:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
it may be ill-advised but
 
03:16:31.010 --> 03:16:31.020 align:start position:0%
uh that's your choice you the state has
 
03:16:32.809 --> 03:16:32.819 align:start position:0%
no no
 
03:16:34.969 --> 03:16:34.979 align:start position:0%
this state would have no interest in
 
03:16:38.570 --> 03:16:38.580 align:start position:0%
controlling or regulating free free
 
03:16:38.580 --> 03:16:40.309 align:start position:0%
controlling or regulating free free
actions

03:16:40.309 --> 03:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
actions
 
03:16:42.590 --> 03:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
the last time this came up the board
 
03:16:45.650 --> 03:16:45.660 align:start position:0%
said oh but we never prosecute somebody
 
03:16:47.750 --> 03:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
for cutting their husband's hair or
 
03:16:52.130 --> 03:16:52.140 align:start position:0%
whatever and I
 
03:16:55.670 --> 03:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
strongly object to that policy because I
 
03:16:57.290 --> 03:16:57.300 align:start position:0%
think that if it's on the books as a
 
03:17:00.650 --> 03:17:00.660 align:start position:0%
crime it should be enforced as a crime
 
03:17:02.389 --> 03:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
I would be
 
03:17:05.330 --> 03:17:05.340 align:start position:0%
and in many cases I I object to having
 
03:17:08.929 --> 03:17:08.939 align:start position:0%
laws that are selectively enforced
 
03:17:10.969 --> 03:17:10.979 align:start position:0%
I would hope you all do too
 
03:17:13.370 --> 03:17:13.380 align:start position:0%
anyway it's a very simple Bill last
 
03:17:25.130 --> 03:17:25.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:27.170 --> 03:17:27.180 align:start position:0%
I have at the end of its titled the
 
03:17:30.309 --> 03:17:30.319 align:start position:0%
executive departments
 
03:17:33.349 --> 03:17:33.359 align:start position:0%
earlier which I thought we'd fix it in
 
03:17:33.359 --> 03:17:34.490 align:start position:0%
earlier which I thought we'd fix it in
there

03:17:34.490 --> 03:17:34.500 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:17:37.550 --> 03:17:37.560 align:start position:0%

03:17:48.830 --> 03:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
I have my hand up is that you me you're
 
03:17:50.870 --> 03:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
referring to it's going to be you
 
03:17:54.050 --> 03:17:54.060 align:start position:0%
representative go for it
 
03:17:56.450 --> 03:17:56.460 align:start position:0%
thank you so first of all representative
 
03:17:56.460 --> 03:17:58.210 align:start position:0%
thank you so first of all representative
McGuire

03:17:58.210 --> 03:17:58.220 align:start position:0%
McGuire
 
03:18:05.090 --> 03:18:05.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:07.370 --> 03:18:07.380 align:start position:0%
according to the current statute it is a
 
03:18:10.730 --> 03:18:10.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:12.590 --> 03:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
said technically a crime or a
 
03:18:15.889 --> 03:18:15.899 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor it is a crime it is not a
 
03:18:18.010 --> 03:18:18.020 align:start position:0%
felony unless you are a
 
03:18:21.290 --> 03:18:21.300 align:start position:0%
non-natural person that is a business so
 
03:18:23.030 --> 03:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
if you set up a
 
03:18:27.349 --> 03:18:27.359 align:start position:0%
illicit Salon as an LLC or whatever that
 
03:18:30.110 --> 03:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
would be a felony if you simply
 
03:18:30.120 --> 03:18:31.370 align:start position:0%
would be a felony if you simply
uh

03:18:31.370 --> 03:18:31.380 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:18:33.469 --> 03:18:33.479 align:start position:0%
at somebody's hair as an individual
 
03:18:38.389 --> 03:18:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:38.399 --> 03:18:39.889 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

03:18:39.889 --> 03:18:39.899 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:18:39.899 --> 03:18:42.469 align:start position:0%
follow-up
yeah

03:18:42.469 --> 03:18:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:45.110 --> 03:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
thank you so if
 
03:18:47.870 --> 03:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
your bill were to pass
 
03:18:47.880 --> 03:18:48.530 align:start position:0%
your bill were to pass
um

03:18:48.530 --> 03:18:48.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:51.170 --> 03:18:51.180 align:start position:0%
are you concerned about the fact that it
 
03:18:53.349 --> 03:18:53.359 align:start position:0%
opens the door for
 
03:18:57.410 --> 03:18:57.420 align:start position:0%
all kinds of serious violations of the
 
03:19:01.510 --> 03:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
requirement that people performing these
 
03:19:06.530 --> 03:19:06.540 align:start position:0%
actions these Services uh be trained and
 
03:19:06.540 --> 03:19:09.650 align:start position:0%
actions these Services uh be trained and
competent

03:19:09.650 --> 03:19:09.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:09.660 --> 03:19:13.790 align:start position:0%
 
now

03:19:13.790 --> 03:19:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:16.550 --> 03:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
a follow-up
 
03:19:16.560 --> 03:19:19.429 align:start position:0%
a follow-up
okay

03:19:19.429 --> 03:19:19.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:22.730 --> 03:19:22.740 align:start position:0%
so are you aware that the people who are
 
03:19:25.550 --> 03:19:25.560 align:start position:0%
practitioners under the law legal
 
03:19:25.560 --> 03:19:27.650 align:start position:0%
practitioners under the law legal
practitioners

03:19:27.650 --> 03:19:27.660 align:start position:0%
practitioners
 
03:19:31.130 --> 03:19:31.140 align:start position:0%
um see lots of openings for illegal
 
03:19:35.030 --> 03:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
activity which would be you know the
 
03:19:39.889 --> 03:19:39.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:43.010 --> 03:19:43.020 align:start position:0%
understand the cosmetologists
 
03:19:46.010 --> 03:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
Etc are violently opposed to this
 
03:19:46.020 --> 03:19:48.170 align:start position:0%
Etc are violently opposed to this
but

03:19:48.170 --> 03:19:48.180 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:19:52.309 --> 03:19:52.319 align:start position:0%
I can't see that anyone is going to be
 
03:19:56.750 --> 03:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
doing very much without remuneration
 
03:19:59.870 --> 03:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
except for their friends or family
 
03:20:03.170 --> 03:20:03.180 align:start position:0%
and if you go to any drugstore or
 
03:20:05.330 --> 03:20:05.340 align:start position:0%
Walmart or wherever and walk through the
 
03:20:08.750 --> 03:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
beauty products you will see row after
 
03:20:11.210 --> 03:20:11.220 align:start position:0%
row of hair dyes
 
03:20:15.170 --> 03:20:15.180 align:start position:0%
permanent styling AIDS Etc not to
 
03:20:17.090 --> 03:20:17.100 align:start position:0%
mention nail polish which is also
 
03:20:20.210 --> 03:20:20.220 align:start position:0%
applying nail polish is also a part of
 
03:20:22.030 --> 03:20:22.040 align:start position:0%
this this chapter
 
03:20:25.010 --> 03:20:25.020 align:start position:0%
these products are available for the
 
03:20:25.020 --> 03:20:26.269 align:start position:0%
these products are available for the
public

03:20:26.269 --> 03:20:26.279 align:start position:0%
public
 
03:20:28.849 --> 03:20:28.859 align:start position:0%
there is no crime just it is not a crime
 
03:20:32.110 --> 03:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
to sell them or to use them on yourself
 
03:20:35.090 --> 03:20:35.100 align:start position:0%
but right now it is a crime to use them
 
03:20:38.870 --> 03:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:41.630 --> 03:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:20:44.269 --> 03:20:44.279 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
03:20:47.389 --> 03:20:47.399 align:start position:0%
thank you um representative McGuire I'm
 
03:20:50.690 --> 03:20:50.700 align:start position:0%
wondering if you might recall not so
 
03:20:53.990 --> 03:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
much this past year but before seeing on
 
03:20:54.000 --> 03:20:55.070 align:start position:0%
much this past year but before seeing on
TV

03:20:55.070 --> 03:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
TV
 
03:20:56.570 --> 03:20:56.580 align:start position:0%
um things about
 
03:21:01.730 --> 03:21:01.740 align:start position:0%
people who donate care to go to making
 
03:21:04.730 --> 03:21:04.740 align:start position:0%
wigs and that there's a cosmetologist
 
03:21:07.849 --> 03:21:07.859 align:start position:0%
there who who Styles their hair so it
 
03:21:10.309 --> 03:21:10.319 align:start position:0%
looks nice after the ponytails cut off
 
03:21:13.370 --> 03:21:13.380 align:start position:0%
and then another example I can think of
 
03:21:16.790 --> 03:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
is um it's not uncommon particularly in
 
03:21:20.870 --> 03:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
schools for the male teachers to grow a
 
03:21:23.690 --> 03:21:23.700 align:start position:0%
beard and they do it for fundraising for
 
03:21:25.730 --> 03:21:25.740 align:start position:0%
some kind of Charity and usually
 
03:21:27.650 --> 03:21:27.660 align:start position:0%
sometimes they cut their own but
 
03:21:30.530 --> 03:21:30.540 align:start position:0%
sometimes they get a professional shave
 
03:21:34.010 --> 03:21:34.020 align:start position:0%
so I don't you think that there there
 
03:21:37.190 --> 03:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
are times when people have an
 
03:21:40.070 --> 03:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
expectation that they're getting a
 
03:21:42.230 --> 03:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
professional service from somebody who
 
03:21:44.389 --> 03:21:44.399 align:start position:0%
knows all the how to
 
03:21:50.469 --> 03:21:50.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:54.050 --> 03:21:54.060 align:start position:0%
yes and anyone who is setting themselves
 
03:21:57.590 --> 03:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
up as a barber or a esthetician or
 
03:21:57.600 --> 03:21:59.990 align:start position:0%
up as a barber or a esthetician or
cosmetologist

03:21:59.990 --> 03:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
cosmetologist
 
03:22:03.349 --> 03:22:03.359 align:start position:0%
is required to be licensed
 
03:22:05.510 --> 03:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
however if you're
 
03:22:07.969 --> 03:22:07.979 align:start position:0%
if if you're playing with makeup with
 
03:22:11.330 --> 03:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
your your teenage friends or your cut or
 
03:22:12.710 --> 03:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
you're cutting your husband's hair
 
03:22:15.710 --> 03:22:15.720 align:start position:0%
because he can't get to the barber shop
 
03:22:18.110 --> 03:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
I mean that may be ill-advised I cut my
 
03:22:20.870 --> 03:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
husband's hair and he's still recovering
 
03:22:25.790 --> 03:22:25.800 align:start position:0%
but it's not it should not be a crime
 
03:22:30.410 --> 03:22:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:35.389 --> 03:22:35.399 align:start position:0%
so so what I'm saying is that these
 
03:22:37.429 --> 03:22:37.439 align:start position:0%
um beauticians cosmeticians whatever
 
03:22:40.790 --> 03:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
their their technical title is that they
 
03:22:43.370 --> 03:22:43.380 align:start position:0%
are it's not uncommon that they are
 
03:22:45.410 --> 03:22:45.420 align:start position:0%
cutting the hair of people that they
 
03:22:46.490 --> 03:22:46.500 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
03:22:49.010 --> 03:22:49.020 align:start position:0%
and or the or shaving a beard of
 
03:22:51.230 --> 03:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
somebody that they don't know because
 
03:22:54.050 --> 03:22:54.060 align:start position:0%
it's in connection with one of these
 
03:22:57.050 --> 03:22:57.060 align:start position:0%
chair chair running raising money for a
 
03:22:57.060 --> 03:22:58.250 align:start position:0%
chair chair running raising money for a
charity

03:22:58.250 --> 03:22:58.260 align:start position:0%
charity
 
03:23:02.450 --> 03:23:02.460 align:start position:0%
so representative this does not prohibit

a licensed cosmetologist or whatever
 
03:23:09.170 --> 03:23:09.180 align:start position:0%
from performing these acts for free or
 
03:23:11.990 --> 03:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
for charity that's up between them and
 
03:23:15.290 --> 03:23:15.300 align:start position:0%
and their business this is for
 
03:23:18.349 --> 03:23:18.359 align:start position:0%
for non-professionals to
 
03:23:20.690 --> 03:23:20.700 align:start position:0%
help their friends and neighbors and
 
03:23:22.969 --> 03:23:22.979 align:start position:0%
their families I I understand your
 
03:23:22.979 --> 03:23:24.110 align:start position:0%
their families I I understand your
intent

03:23:24.110 --> 03:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
intent
 
03:23:27.469 --> 03:23:27.479 align:start position:0%
but the way it's worded a cause a

but the way it's worded a cause a
cosmetician

03:23:29.150 --> 03:23:29.160 align:start position:0%
cosmetician
 
03:23:31.849 --> 03:23:31.859 align:start position:0%
who don't
 
03:23:34.729 --> 03:23:34.739 align:start position:0%
my the thing is that the the expectation
 
03:23:36.769 --> 03:23:36.779 align:start position:0%
of the people who are getting their hair
 
03:23:39.650 --> 03:23:39.660 align:start position:0%
cut or getting their beard shaved for a
 
03:23:42.110 --> 03:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
charity that the person that's doing
 
03:23:44.170 --> 03:23:44.180 align:start position:0%
that ought to know what they're doing
 
03:23:47.330 --> 03:23:47.340 align:start position:0%
and their assumption would be that they
 
03:23:49.790 --> 03:23:49.800 align:start position:0%
that the person does but you're saying
 
03:23:53.690 --> 03:23:53.700 align:start position:0%
just anybody can come in and do this
 
03:23:55.490 --> 03:23:55.500 align:start position:0%
representative house representative
 
03:23:59.150 --> 03:23:59.160 align:start position:0%
point of order we're still ascribing
 
03:24:01.370 --> 03:24:01.380 align:start position:0%
pensions the people we don't know when
 
03:24:03.110 --> 03:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
in this case are theoretically in
 
03:24:03.120 --> 03:24:04.429 align:start position:0%
in this case are theoretically in
existence

03:24:04.429 --> 03:24:04.439 align:start position:0%
existence
 
03:24:06.650 --> 03:24:06.660 align:start position:0%
that they that they expect to get
 
03:24:09.650 --> 03:24:09.660 align:start position:0%
professional care or something like this
 
03:24:13.190 --> 03:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
and actually just leave it at that
 
03:24:15.590 --> 03:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
we cannot ascribe
 
03:24:17.330 --> 03:24:17.340 align:start position:0%
the intentions to other people
 
03:24:21.590 --> 03:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
representative fellows I I had a talk
 
03:24:24.650 --> 03:24:24.660 align:start position:0%
with with my hair cutter and she was
 
03:24:27.650 --> 03:24:27.660 align:start position:0%
doing a charity event and her license
 
03:24:29.809 --> 03:24:29.819 align:start position:0%
was prominently mentioned in the
 
03:24:31.910 --> 03:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
advertisement even though she was doing
 
03:24:33.650 --> 03:24:33.660 align:start position:0%
it for free
 
03:24:35.750 --> 03:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
she was only doing things she was
 
03:24:39.769 --> 03:24:39.779 align:start position:0%
trained and actually licensed to do
 
03:24:42.410 --> 03:24:42.420 align:start position:0%
and I that is the case in other charity
 
03:24:42.420 --> 03:24:45.830 align:start position:0%
and I that is the case in other charity
events

03:24:45.830 --> 03:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:48.590 --> 03:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
all right follow up again
 
03:24:52.130 --> 03:24:52.140 align:start position:0%
yep go ahead I
 
03:24:55.070 --> 03:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
I I'm not sure that
 
03:24:56.690 --> 03:24:56.700 align:start position:0%
um we can be sure that that's what
 
03:24:59.389 --> 03:24:59.399 align:start position:0%
happens in all charity events but in
 
03:25:01.370 --> 03:25:01.380 align:start position:0%
that case if you think that that's an
 
03:25:04.250 --> 03:25:04.260 align:start position:0%
exception do you want to make would you
 
03:25:06.050 --> 03:25:06.060 align:start position:0%
consider making an amendment to this
 
03:25:09.530 --> 03:25:09.540 align:start position:0%
bill that says that okay
 
03:25:11.809 --> 03:25:11.819 align:start position:0%
about the charity events and displaying
 
03:25:14.389 --> 03:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
your credentials or do you want to make
 
03:25:17.450 --> 03:25:17.460 align:start position:0%
it make it a requirement that that the
 
03:25:20.809 --> 03:25:20.819 align:start position:0%
charity events only use a licensed
 
03:25:24.170 --> 03:25:24.180 align:start position:0%
cosmetician for this kind of thing
 
03:25:26.330 --> 03:25:26.340 align:start position:0%
no representative fellows I want to
 
03:25:28.190 --> 03:25:28.200 align:start position:0%
leave that up to the Charities I think
 
03:25:30.530 --> 03:25:30.540 align:start position:0%
they can decide on their own who they
 
03:25:32.330 --> 03:25:32.340 align:start position:0%
want to have doing that the chair
 
03:25:35.330 --> 03:25:35.340 align:start position:0%
trimming or whatever and they are aware
 
03:25:37.729 --> 03:25:37.739 align:start position:0%
of the training requirements for for
 
03:25:40.370 --> 03:25:40.380 align:start position:0%
cosmetologists and Barbers and I'm sure
 
03:25:43.490 --> 03:25:43.500 align:start position:0%
they can get licensed individuals that's
 
03:25:45.830 --> 03:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
all I'm going to say about it well thank
 
03:25:47.450 --> 03:25:47.460 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
03:25:47.460 --> 03:25:49.010 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question

McGuire

03:25:53.630 --> 03:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
McGuire
 
03:25:55.130 --> 03:25:55.140 align:start position:0%
um I went to college at Oklahoma State
 
03:25:57.650 --> 03:25:57.660 align:start position:0%
University where for some incredibly
 
03:26:01.130 --> 03:26:01.140 align:start position:0%
amazing reason 90 of the women in
 
03:26:03.229 --> 03:26:03.239 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma have blonde hair
 
03:26:05.389 --> 03:26:05.399 align:start position:0%
now you and I and all of us know that
 
03:26:07.130 --> 03:26:07.140 align:start position:0%
there's no way that that's actually true
 
03:26:11.110 --> 03:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
so when the
 
03:26:14.630 --> 03:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
sororities or the or the the dorm units
 
03:26:16.370 --> 03:26:16.380 align:start position:0%
or whatever when they have events where
 
03:26:19.610 --> 03:26:19.620 align:start position:0%
the where the the girls or even in the
 
03:26:21.530 --> 03:26:21.540 align:start position:0%
sense of the guys are dying each other's
 
03:26:21.540 --> 03:26:22.550 align:start position:0%
sense of the guys are dying each other's
hair

03:26:22.550 --> 03:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
hair
 
03:26:25.910 --> 03:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
is that a crime currently in New
 
03:26:25.920 --> 03:26:27.349 align:start position:0%
is that a crime currently in New
Hampshire

chair and members of the committee my
 
03:27:21.650 --> 03:27:21.660 align:start position:0%
name is Vinnie biaketti I'm a barber
 
03:27:22.790 --> 03:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
licensed in the state of New Hampshire
 
03:27:24.950 --> 03:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
and I'm here to testify an opposition of
 
03:27:24.960 --> 03:27:26.809 align:start position:0%
and I'm here to testify an opposition of
hb606

03:27:26.809 --> 03:27:26.819 align:start position:0%
hb606
 
03:27:28.670 --> 03:27:28.680 align:start position:0%
if you want to allow mom and dad to cut
 
03:27:31.130 --> 03:27:31.140 align:start position:0%
their kids hair or their their uh their
 
03:27:33.349 --> 03:27:33.359 align:start position:0%
spouse is here or take some box coloring

or do their hair paint their fingernails
 
03:27:37.670 --> 03:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
I don't have a problem with that as a
 
03:27:39.710 --> 03:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
trained professional it's the allowing
 
03:27:41.349 --> 03:27:41.359 align:start position:0%
of unlicensed people to cut hair
 
03:27:44.330 --> 03:27:44.340 align:start position:0%
individuals hair wax put chemicals on
 
03:27:46.250 --> 03:27:46.260 align:start position:0%
people's skin and scalp with no
 
03:27:48.110 --> 03:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
education or training and the safety and
 
03:27:49.550 --> 03:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
proper use of these services that I have
 
03:27:51.710 --> 03:27:51.720 align:start position:0%
an issue with just because I watch a
 
03:27:53.269 --> 03:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
video and practice on my friends doesn't
 
03:27:54.950 --> 03:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
make me a professional in any of these
 
03:27:56.870 --> 03:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
three categories and this is not a money
 
03:27:58.670 --> 03:27:58.680 align:start position:0%
issue this there's plenty of work to go
 
03:28:00.590 --> 03:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
around but I would caution you that this
 
03:28:02.210 --> 03:28:02.220 align:start position:0%
is the safety this is for the safety and
 
03:28:04.309 --> 03:28:04.319 align:start position:0%
sanitation issues and preventing people
 
03:28:06.290 --> 03:28:06.300 align:start position:0%
from becoming ill or severely injured
 
03:28:08.030 --> 03:28:08.040 align:start position:0%
and that's our top priority
 
03:28:10.010 --> 03:28:10.020 align:start position:0%
a licensed Barber cosmetologist or
 
03:28:11.990 --> 03:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
esthetician let's go through an approved
 
03:28:14.690 --> 03:28:14.700 align:start position:0%
course or even an apprenticeship and in
 
03:28:17.030 --> 03:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
our training we provide we learn to
 
03:28:18.769 --> 03:28:18.779 align:start position:0%
provide these services but we also learn
 
03:28:21.469 --> 03:28:21.479 align:start position:0%
and are tested on sanitation chemistry
 
03:28:23.990 --> 03:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
anatomy and physiology as well as issues
 
03:28:25.969 --> 03:28:25.979 align:start position:0%
with and diseases of the scalp the skin
 
03:28:27.830 --> 03:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
hair diseases that are primarily
 
03:28:30.050 --> 03:28:30.060 align:start position:0%
associated with follicles of the hair
 
03:28:32.990 --> 03:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
uh head lice dermatitis how to properly
 
03:28:34.610 --> 03:28:34.620 align:start position:0%
mix chemicals so the hair in the head of
 
03:28:36.429 --> 03:28:36.439 align:start position:0%
the person is not burned or scarred
 
03:28:39.229 --> 03:28:39.239 align:start position:0%
alopecia folliculitis just to name a few
 
03:28:41.090 --> 03:28:41.100 align:start position:0%
and we also learned the sanitation
 
03:28:43.070 --> 03:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
prevent procedures to prevent the spread
 
03:28:46.729 --> 03:28:46.739 align:start position:0%
of diseases such as HIV hepatitis staph
 
03:28:48.769 --> 03:28:48.779 align:start position:0%
infections fungal infections bacterial
 
03:28:51.110 --> 03:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
infections lice tetanus and again just
 
03:28:52.670 --> 03:28:52.680 align:start position:0%
to name a few
 
03:28:55.010 --> 03:28:55.020 align:start position:0%
services that we provide are actually
 
03:28:57.110 --> 03:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
pretty significant
 
03:28:59.269 --> 03:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
I'm a traveling Barber most of my
 
03:29:00.530 --> 03:29:00.540 align:start position:0%
clients are in medical facilities
 
03:29:02.929 --> 03:29:02.939 align:start position:0%
Correctional Facilities or or elderly
 
03:29:04.429 --> 03:29:04.439 align:start position:0%
and infirmed and are unable to leave
 
03:29:06.530 --> 03:29:06.540 align:start position:0%
their house this kind of service is
 
03:29:07.849 --> 03:29:07.859 align:start position:0%
allowed by law
 
03:29:09.769 --> 03:29:09.779 align:start position:0%
I not only have proper equipment to cut
 
03:29:12.469 --> 03:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
my my clients hair and shave their faces
 
03:29:14.330 --> 03:29:14.340 align:start position:0%
and perform the services that I'm
 
03:29:16.490 --> 03:29:16.500 align:start position:0%
allowed to and was trained for but my
 
03:29:17.870 --> 03:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
instruments Combs and other equipment
 
03:29:20.090 --> 03:29:20.100 align:start position:0%
are properly cleaned and sanitized after
 
03:29:22.370 --> 03:29:22.380 align:start position:0%
every service helping to prevent the
 
03:29:24.050 --> 03:29:24.060 align:start position:0%
spread of the disease and causing
 
03:29:26.150 --> 03:29:26.160 align:start position:0%
illicitor injury to clients I've also
 
03:29:27.410 --> 03:29:27.420 align:start position:0%
done the charity
 
03:29:30.050 --> 03:29:30.060 align:start position:0%
um circuit two you do need to be
 
03:29:31.309 --> 03:29:31.319 align:start position:0%
licensed for that and we can get a
 
03:29:32.990 --> 03:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
permit they don't charge us from from
 
03:29:36.469 --> 03:29:36.479 align:start position:0%
oplc for that I would suggest that if
 
03:29:38.150 --> 03:29:38.160 align:start position:0%
this bill be changed to allow the
 
03:29:40.849 --> 03:29:40.859 align:start position:0%
services to be provided by and two
 
03:29:43.130 --> 03:29:43.140 align:start position:0%
immediate family members only and I'd
 
03:29:44.750 --> 03:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
ask that you oppose this bill is written
 
03:29:46.490 --> 03:29:46.500 align:start position:0%
and voted itl
 
03:29:48.110 --> 03:29:48.120 align:start position:0%

representative

03:29:57.950 --> 03:29:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:59.990 --> 03:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I do have a question
 
03:30:00.000 --> 03:30:01.429 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I do have a question
now

03:30:01.429 --> 03:30:01.439 align:start position:0%

03:30:04.150 --> 03:30:04.160 align:start position:0%
um good afternoon Mr biochetti

thank you
 
03:30:11.389 --> 03:30:11.399 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that you have performed
 
03:30:16.550 --> 03:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:22.250 --> 03:30:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:22.260 --> 03:30:23.210 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:30:23.210 --> 03:30:23.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:30:25.969 --> 03:30:25.979 align:start position:0%
let me continue with my question uh you
 
03:30:27.650 --> 03:30:27.660 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you've performed your
 
03:30:30.729 --> 03:30:30.739 align:start position:0%
services in settings such as
 
03:30:33.469 --> 03:30:33.479 align:start position:0%
jails and
 
03:30:37.090 --> 03:30:37.100 align:start position:0%
um communal errors I'll put it that way
 
03:30:39.830 --> 03:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
in doing that have you
 
03:30:43.370 --> 03:30:43.380 align:start position:0%
uh in the process discovered
 
03:30:46.610 --> 03:30:46.620 align:start position:0%
um for example head lice or diseases or
 
03:30:50.269 --> 03:30:50.279 align:start position:0%
something that you were able to treat or
 
03:30:52.309 --> 03:30:52.319 align:start position:0%
recommend treatment for that have
 
03:30:55.190 --> 03:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
prevented transmission of those to other
 
03:30:58.849 --> 03:30:58.859 align:start position:0%
people I have we don't we don't treat
 
03:31:01.849 --> 03:31:01.859 align:start position:0%
and we don't cut hair if we notice lice
 
03:31:05.269 --> 03:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
or the or the knits eggs we don't we
 
03:31:07.070 --> 03:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
don't cut hair after that it's it
 
03:31:07.080 --> 03:31:08.330 align:start position:0%
don't cut hair after that it's it
stopped

03:31:08.330 --> 03:31:08.340 align:start position:0%
stopped
 
03:31:11.570 --> 03:31:11.580 align:start position:0%
um and then I found it in an inmate in
 
03:31:14.030 --> 03:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
um in a correctional facility and then
 
03:31:16.010 --> 03:31:16.020 align:start position:0%
you know discreetly said you know come
 
03:31:17.330 --> 03:31:17.340 align:start position:0%
on over here and then give them to the
 
03:31:18.769 --> 03:31:18.779 align:start position:0%
co and
 
03:31:21.410 --> 03:31:21.420 align:start position:0%
um they took care of it from there but I
 
03:31:22.849 --> 03:31:22.859 align:start position:0%
have found that
 
03:31:25.150 --> 03:31:25.160 align:start position:0%
as well as other other
 
03:31:27.110 --> 03:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
conditions that I've not cut hair
 
03:31:29.210 --> 03:31:29.220 align:start position:0%
because I don't want to cause any more
 
03:31:32.630 --> 03:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:39.950 --> 03:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:41.150 --> 03:31:41.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:31:41.160 --> 03:31:41.870 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

03:31:41.870 --> 03:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:31:41.880 --> 03:31:43.429 align:start position:0%
um
if

03:31:43.429 --> 03:31:43.439 align:start position:0%
if
 
03:31:46.309 --> 03:31:46.319 align:start position:0%
um if an amateur were doing this are
 
03:31:49.130 --> 03:31:49.140 align:start position:0%
there some conditions that I'm
 
03:31:51.349 --> 03:31:51.359 align:start position:0%
understanding your concern is that they
 
03:31:54.110 --> 03:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't recognize these problems or
 
03:31:55.969 --> 03:31:55.979 align:start position:0%
might continue to go ahead and cut the
 
03:31:57.950 --> 03:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
hair which would then
 
03:32:02.510 --> 03:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
date the disease being transmitted oh
 
03:32:02.520 --> 03:32:03.650 align:start position:0%
date the disease being transmitted oh
absolutely

03:32:03.650 --> 03:32:03.660 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
03:32:05.570 --> 03:32:05.580 align:start position:0%
um I do a lot of I and I do a lot of
 
03:32:08.090 --> 03:32:08.100 align:start position:0%
Razor work so I shave people
 
03:32:09.290 --> 03:32:09.300 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
03:32:11.450 --> 03:32:11.460 align:start position:0%
I'm exposed to to other people's blood
 
03:32:14.210 --> 03:32:14.220 align:start position:0%
sometimes I don't make that a habit
 
03:32:16.610 --> 03:32:16.620 align:start position:0%
um but you know you have to know how to
 
03:32:19.070 --> 03:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
treat that or or how to prevent the
 
03:32:20.870 --> 03:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
spread of that how to contain or prevent
 
03:32:23.030 --> 03:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
the contamination and prevent the
 
03:32:25.190 --> 03:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
cross-contamination also you'll notice
 
03:32:27.530 --> 03:32:27.540 align:start position:0%
you'll you know if you have uh scalp
 
03:32:31.610 --> 03:32:31.620 align:start position:0%
conditions or you miss mix chemicals and
 
03:32:33.530 --> 03:32:33.540 align:start position:0%
put them on the on the body and it burns
 
03:32:36.830 --> 03:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
the body if you don't do it all the time
 
03:32:39.889 --> 03:32:39.899 align:start position:0%
or you're not trained to know how to use
 
03:32:41.809 --> 03:32:41.819 align:start position:0%
it properly you can seriously injure
 
03:32:44.389 --> 03:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
somebody yes
 
03:32:46.370 --> 03:32:46.380 align:start position:0%
did I answer your question thank you
 
03:32:52.849 --> 03:32:52.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:54.410 --> 03:32:54.420 align:start position:0%
the chair has got a question for you sir
 
03:32:57.769 --> 03:32:57.779 align:start position:0%
yes sir are you
 
03:33:01.790 --> 03:33:01.800 align:start position:0%
all right I'm 44 I don't I don't dye my
 
03:33:04.790 --> 03:33:04.800 align:start position:0%
hair I don't do anything nor do I did my
 
03:33:06.469 --> 03:33:06.479 align:start position:0%
hair I have I went to high school with a
 
03:33:09.769 --> 03:33:09.779 align:start position:0%
lovely caledonza sharp and dairy with
 
03:33:12.110 --> 03:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
that being said the
 
03:33:14.450 --> 03:33:14.460 align:start position:0%
certainly Rite Aid in places like that
 
03:33:14.460 --> 03:33:16.250 align:start position:0%
certainly Rite Aid in places like that
sell

03:33:16.250 --> 03:33:16.260 align:start position:0%
sell
 
03:33:20.570 --> 03:33:20.580 align:start position:0%
numerous products that are
 
03:33:23.030 --> 03:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
apparently deemed acceptable for the
 
03:33:26.210 --> 03:33:26.220 align:start position:0%
general public to use in a safe manner
 
03:33:28.190 --> 03:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
now certainly you know you follow the
 
03:33:31.490 --> 03:33:31.500 align:start position:0%
directions and there are there are uh
 
03:33:34.190 --> 03:33:34.200 align:start position:0%
potential for misuse certainly and there
 
03:33:38.330 --> 03:33:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:40.490 --> 03:33:40.500 align:start position:0%
but with that being said I you know
 
03:33:42.170 --> 03:33:42.180 align:start position:0%
you've mentioned the mixing of chemicals
 
03:33:44.630 --> 03:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
and some of the other things that could
 
03:33:46.610 --> 03:33:46.620 align:start position:0%
potentially happen is there really a
 
03:33:46.620 --> 03:33:47.809 align:start position:0%
potentially happen is there really a
risk

03:33:47.809 --> 03:33:47.819 align:start position:0%
risk
 
03:33:47.819 --> 03:33:49.130 align:start position:0%
risk
for

03:33:49.130 --> 03:33:49.140 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:33:51.110 --> 03:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
for someone to
 
03:33:54.170 --> 03:33:54.180 align:start position:0%
assist their spouse or
 
03:33:57.590 --> 03:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
assist their their neighbor with uh
 
03:34:00.410 --> 03:34:00.420 align:start position:0%
dying their hair out of it
 
03:34:02.929 --> 03:34:02.939 align:start position:0%
because they're one in essence
 
03:34:05.269 --> 03:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
you know from a consumer grade
 
03:34:05.279 --> 03:34:07.790 align:start position:0%
you know from a consumer grade
standpoint

03:34:07.790 --> 03:34:07.800 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
03:34:10.729 --> 03:34:10.739 align:start position:0%
I'm not familiar well familiar with with
 
03:34:13.490 --> 03:34:13.500 align:start position:0%
coloring um the Box coloring stuff I
 
03:34:15.170 --> 03:34:15.180 align:start position:0%
know that if you you use it incorrectly
 
03:34:17.330 --> 03:34:17.340 align:start position:0%
you can cause some problems the other
 
03:34:20.030 --> 03:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
the other part is the esthetician part
 
03:34:22.250 --> 03:34:22.260 align:start position:0%
um we've given facials and you have
 
03:34:24.469 --> 03:34:24.479 align:start position:0%
masks I do a thing called a dermaplane
 
03:34:26.990 --> 03:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
dermaplane facial which is uh in essence
 
03:34:28.849 --> 03:34:28.859 align:start position:0%
using a razor on a woman's face and then
 
03:34:33.190 --> 03:34:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:36.410 --> 03:34:36.420 align:start position:0%
kind of like a mask on on somebody so
 
03:34:37.809 --> 03:34:37.819 align:start position:0%
you're applying chemicals on their face
 
03:34:41.330 --> 03:34:41.340 align:start position:0%
it's very easy to burn skin if it's not
 
03:34:42.889 --> 03:34:42.899 align:start position:0%
done properly if you don't recognize
 
03:34:45.349 --> 03:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
that there's an issue coming
 
03:34:47.809 --> 03:34:47.819 align:start position:0%
um it can it can cause some significant
 
03:34:50.150 --> 03:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
injury to to people so it's not just
 
03:34:52.790 --> 03:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
about the Box coloring it's about the
 
03:34:56.030 --> 03:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
other chemicals that are used as well
 
03:34:57.650 --> 03:34:57.660 align:start position:0%
you have to be licensed to purchase
 
03:35:00.469 --> 03:35:00.479 align:start position:0%
those products no no
 
03:35:00.479 --> 03:35:01.070 align:start position:0%
those products no no
um

03:35:01.070 --> 03:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:04.550 --> 03:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
there are there are places like Sally's
 
03:35:04.560 --> 03:35:06.290 align:start position:0%
there are there are places like Sally's
or

03:35:06.290 --> 03:35:06.300 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:35:06.300 --> 03:35:07.969 align:start position:0%
or
um

03:35:07.969 --> 03:35:07.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:10.550 --> 03:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
Paul Mitchell that you can you need to
 
03:35:12.610 --> 03:35:12.620 align:start position:0%
be a licensed
 
03:35:14.929 --> 03:35:14.939 align:start position:0%
professional to purchase those products
 
03:35:16.910 --> 03:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
but to go to Walmart or something like
 
03:35:18.830 --> 03:35:18.840 align:start position:0%
that and sometimes you don't even know
 
03:35:21.469 --> 03:35:21.479 align:start position:0%
what's in there what's in the boxes or
 
03:35:26.330 --> 03:35:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:26.340 --> 03:35:29.389 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:35:29.389 --> 03:35:29.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:32.929 --> 03:35:32.939 align:start position:0%
consent play a role in this at all let
 
03:35:35.269 --> 03:35:35.279 align:start position:0%
me provide a little context
 
03:35:35.279 --> 03:35:37.010 align:start position:0%
me provide a little context
if

03:35:37.010 --> 03:35:37.020 align:start position:0%
if
 
03:35:38.929 --> 03:35:38.939 align:start position:0%
my brother asked me to cut his hair
 
03:35:42.530 --> 03:35:42.540 align:start position:0%
because he couldn't get an appointment
 
03:35:43.969 --> 03:35:43.979 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:35:46.610 --> 03:35:46.620 align:start position:0%
he asks me and he's
 
03:35:50.750 --> 03:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:50.760 --> 03:35:51.590 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:35:51.590 --> 03:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:54.190 --> 03:35:54.200 align:start position:0%
just consent play a role in any of this
 
03:35:56.650 --> 03:35:56.660 align:start position:0%
I know people
 
03:36:00.170 --> 03:36:00.180 align:start position:0%
that have the hobby of skydiving
 
03:36:02.510 --> 03:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
which is I think probably a little bit
 
03:36:04.490 --> 03:36:04.500 align:start position:0%
more dangerous than getting your hair
 
03:36:04.500 --> 03:36:05.510 align:start position:0%
more dangerous than getting your hair
cut

03:36:05.510 --> 03:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
cut
 
03:36:09.229 --> 03:36:09.239 align:start position:0%
but that person has consented to jumping
 
03:36:10.790 --> 03:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
out of an airplane with a piece of
 
03:36:13.130 --> 03:36:13.140 align:start position:0%
fabric on their back
 
03:36:15.170 --> 03:36:15.180 align:start position:0%
I don't understand why it should be a
 
03:36:15.180 --> 03:36:16.550 align:start position:0%
I don't understand why it should be a
crime

03:36:16.550 --> 03:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
crime
 
03:36:19.070 --> 03:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
for me to cut my wife's hair
 
03:36:21.050 --> 03:36:21.060 align:start position:0%
can this consent play a role in this
 
03:36:22.969 --> 03:36:22.979 align:start position:0%
that's my question is is that for me
 
03:36:25.729 --> 03:36:25.739 align:start position:0%
representative yeah sure thank you
 
03:36:27.530 --> 03:36:27.540 align:start position:0%
you know in reality
 
03:36:30.110 --> 03:36:30.120 align:start position:0%
I've seen professionals who
 
03:36:32.809 --> 03:36:32.819 align:start position:0%
who don't cut hair very well and I also
 
03:36:34.729 --> 03:36:34.739 align:start position:0%
have seen unlicensed people cut hair
 
03:36:37.490 --> 03:36:37.500 align:start position:0%
very well cutting hair is is not that
 
03:36:40.070 --> 03:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
big a deal it's when you start to apply
 
03:36:43.070 --> 03:36:43.080 align:start position:0%
chemicals uh and you start to do just
 
03:36:44.330 --> 03:36:44.340 align:start position:0%
because you give somebody a bad haircut
 
03:36:46.190 --> 03:36:46.200 align:start position:0%
the joke is that the difference between
 
03:36:47.990 --> 03:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
a good haircut and a bad haircut is two
 
03:36:48.000 --> 03:36:49.429 align:start position:0%
a good haircut and a bad haircut is two
weeks

03:36:49.429 --> 03:36:49.439 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
03:36:51.410 --> 03:36:51.420 align:start position:0%
um cutting cutting hair is one thing
 
03:36:54.950 --> 03:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
when you improperly use equipment and
 
03:36:57.530 --> 03:36:57.540 align:start position:0%
tools and you start to spread disease
 
03:36:59.929 --> 03:36:59.939 align:start position:0%
from one person to another
 
03:37:01.910 --> 03:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
that because that person didn't
 
03:37:04.729 --> 03:37:04.739 align:start position:0%
recognize or understand
 
03:37:07.070 --> 03:37:07.080 align:start position:0%
um that there is a there's an issue
 
03:37:09.530 --> 03:37:09.540 align:start position:0%
that's where it becomes a problem hair
 
03:37:11.330 --> 03:37:11.340 align:start position:0%
is hair is actually pretty disgusting
 
03:37:14.210 --> 03:37:14.220 align:start position:0%
and it carries diseases as well
 
03:37:16.070 --> 03:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:37:18.469 --> 03:37:18.479 align:start position:0%
it's not so much the the physical act of
 
03:37:21.889 --> 03:37:21.899 align:start position:0%
cutting hair as it is the prevention of
 
03:37:23.750 --> 03:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
passing along diseases and and
 
03:37:27.130 --> 03:37:27.140 align:start position:0%
conditions infections
 
03:37:29.750 --> 03:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative under current
 
03:37:32.750 --> 03:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
law cutting the hair is actually part of
 
03:37:33.830 --> 03:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
the problem
 
03:37:37.610 --> 03:37:37.620 align:start position:0%
the simple Act of cutting someone's hair
 
03:37:41.929 --> 03:37:41.939 align:start position:0%
or no remuneration is currently a crime
 
03:37:46.550 --> 03:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
and uh so uh please address that and and
 
03:37:49.670 --> 03:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
the other side of this is again just
 
03:37:51.410 --> 03:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
consent play a role
 
03:37:53.870 --> 03:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
my kids got a head full of knits and I'd
 
03:37:55.250 --> 03:37:55.260 align:start position:0%
take care of it
 
03:37:57.410 --> 03:37:57.420 align:start position:0%
am I Criminal
 
03:38:00.830 --> 03:38:00.840 align:start position:0%
if if you sure I mean and knits are one
 
03:38:02.510 --> 03:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
thing because they I mean they live off
 
03:38:05.090 --> 03:38:05.100 align:start position:0%
of blood so once that happens it's not
 
03:38:07.490 --> 03:38:07.500 align:start position:0%
going to be a big deal however if you're
 
03:38:10.849 --> 03:38:10.859 align:start position:0%
cutting hair for friends
 
03:38:13.429 --> 03:38:13.439 align:start position:0%
you know consent is one thing if I give
 
03:38:15.590 --> 03:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
you permission to cut my hair and you
 
03:38:17.809 --> 03:38:17.819 align:start position:0%
cut part of my ear are you relieved from
 
03:38:20.090 --> 03:38:20.100 align:start position:0%
any uh any liability for that
 
03:38:22.910 --> 03:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
So and I've and I've had my ear cut in
 
03:38:24.710 --> 03:38:24.720 align:start position:0%
in barber school
 
03:38:26.090 --> 03:38:26.100 align:start position:0%
um so it's not out of the realm of
 
03:38:28.010 --> 03:38:28.020 align:start position:0%
possibility so if you're cutting my hair
 
03:38:30.290 --> 03:38:30.300 align:start position:0%
and you cause physical damage to me does
 
03:38:33.650 --> 03:38:33.660 align:start position:0%
that relieve you of the liability of
 
03:38:40.550 --> 03:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:40.560 --> 03:38:42.670 align:start position:0%
 
uh

03:38:42.670 --> 03:38:42.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:38:45.710 --> 03:38:45.720 align:start position:0%
I'm asking you does consent to play a
 
03:38:48.349 --> 03:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:51.830 --> 03:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh well my neighbor actually cut his
 
03:38:55.969 --> 03:38:55.979 align:start position:0%
hair or my neighbor's wife or he asked
 
03:38:59.690 --> 03:38:59.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:59.700 --> 03:39:00.850 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:39:00.850 --> 03:39:00.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:00.860 --> 03:39:03.349 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

03:39:03.349 --> 03:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:39:05.690 --> 03:39:05.700 align:start position:0%
for sure should it turn me into a
 
03:39:09.650 --> 03:39:09.660 align:start position:0%
criminal if I if I meet his request and
 
03:39:11.030 --> 03:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
I and I don't disagree with that if
 
03:39:12.110 --> 03:39:12.120 align:start position:0%
you're if you're going to put a Blue
 
03:39:13.790 --> 03:39:13.800 align:start position:0%
Streak in and I asked you to put a Blue
 
03:39:15.650 --> 03:39:15.660 align:start position:0%
Streak in my hair that's one thing you
 
03:39:17.210 --> 03:39:17.220 align:start position:0%
put a Blue Streak in my hair and you
 
03:39:18.590 --> 03:39:18.600 align:start position:0%
burn my scalp while you're doing it
 
03:39:20.450 --> 03:39:20.460 align:start position:0%
that's something completely different I
 
03:39:22.309 --> 03:39:22.319 align:start position:0%
didn't give you permission to hurt me
 
03:39:24.830 --> 03:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
so I guess that would be the the
 
03:39:26.929 --> 03:39:26.939 align:start position:0%
argument to the consent
 
03:39:29.510 --> 03:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
um yeah I mean cons consent is one thing
 
03:39:32.090 --> 03:39:32.100 align:start position:0%
liability is another
 
03:39:37.490 --> 03:39:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:42.710 --> 03:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:45.889 --> 03:39:45.899 align:start position:0%
thank you and uh thank you sir for
 
03:39:49.070 --> 03:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question and I'm not really
 
03:39:52.849 --> 03:39:52.859 align:start position:0%
trying to be funny here but I could see
 
03:39:52.859 --> 03:39:53.870 align:start position:0%
trying to be funny here but I could see
it

03:39:53.870 --> 03:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:39:56.769 --> 03:39:56.779 align:start position:0%
do you see any religious
 
03:40:00.830 --> 03:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
ramifications to this such as if uh
 
03:40:02.929 --> 03:40:02.939 align:start position:0%
somebody belonged to a monk and it was
 
03:40:06.650 --> 03:40:06.660 align:start position:0%
in that Cloister uh the terminology if I
 
03:40:09.469 --> 03:40:09.479 align:start position:0%
think if my memory is right is uh a ton
 
03:40:13.910 --> 03:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
sure of where you get your hair cut and
 
03:40:17.809 --> 03:40:17.819 align:start position:0%
certain religious sects do that and I've
 
03:40:19.969 --> 03:40:19.979 align:start position:0%
always assumed do they go to the barber
 
03:40:23.150 --> 03:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
or does a brother monk provide that
 
03:40:25.670 --> 03:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
service and if a brother monk does
 
03:40:29.210 --> 03:40:29.220 align:start position:0%
provide the service by this description
 
03:40:30.590 --> 03:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
what they
 
03:40:33.889 --> 03:40:33.899 align:start position:0%
be in any violation of their religious
 
03:40:40.050 --> 03:40:40.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:40.060 --> 03:40:42.830 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:40:42.830 --> 03:40:42.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:40:45.650 --> 03:40:45.660 align:start position:0%
the statute and I do appreciate the
 
03:40:47.929 --> 03:40:47.939 align:start position:0%
comment on uh by a fellow representative
 
03:40:52.610 --> 03:40:52.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:56.090 --> 03:40:56.100 align:start position:0%
you know I guess technically
 
03:40:56.100 --> 03:40:57.530 align:start position:0%
you know I guess technically
um

03:40:57.530 --> 03:40:57.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:59.389 --> 03:40:59.399 align:start position:0%
you know this the statute says that
 
03:41:01.190 --> 03:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
their person's engaged in the in the
 
03:41:02.570 --> 03:41:02.580 align:start position:0%
practice of Barbering cosmetology
 
03:41:05.210 --> 03:41:05.220 align:start position:0%
Aesthetics uh manicuring in a charitable
 
03:41:07.490 --> 03:41:07.500 align:start position:0%
benevolent institution nursing home
 
03:41:09.349 --> 03:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
long-term care facility assisted living
 
03:41:09.359 --> 03:41:10.910 align:start position:0%
long-term care facility assisted living
facility

03:41:10.910 --> 03:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
facility
 
03:41:12.469 --> 03:41:12.479 align:start position:0%
um where such practice is carried on
 
03:41:14.210 --> 03:41:14.220 align:start position:0%
solely for the benefit of the residents
 
03:41:15.710 --> 03:41:15.720 align:start position:0%
of such Institution
 
03:41:18.170 --> 03:41:18.180 align:start position:0%
that's how we get away with doing them
 
03:41:21.050 --> 03:41:21.060 align:start position:0%
in a nursing home a correctional
 
03:41:23.389 --> 03:41:23.399 align:start position:0%
facility the hospital those kinds of
 
03:41:23.399 --> 03:41:25.070 align:start position:0%
facility the hospital those kinds of
things

03:41:25.070 --> 03:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
things
 
03:41:26.389 --> 03:41:26.399 align:start position:0%
you know when you start to get into
 
03:41:28.969 --> 03:41:28.979 align:start position:0%
being in a um you know Convent or
 
03:41:31.670 --> 03:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
Monastery I don't know if that would fit
 
03:41:31.680 --> 03:41:33.469 align:start position:0%
Monastery I don't know if that would fit
the

03:41:33.469 --> 03:41:33.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:41:36.710 --> 03:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
um that definition
 
03:41:38.750 --> 03:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
so there are exemptions there are
 
03:41:41.330 --> 03:41:41.340 align:start position:0%
exemptions for
 
03:41:43.490 --> 03:41:43.500 align:start position:0%
not having a license to cut hair
 
03:41:45.650 --> 03:41:45.660 align:start position:0%
and representative McGuire was correct I
 
03:41:47.990 --> 03:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
mean technically you know your your
 
03:41:50.030 --> 03:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
daughters are having a you know a
 
03:41:51.469 --> 03:41:51.479 align:start position:0%
sleepover and they're painting each
 
03:41:53.330 --> 03:41:53.340 align:start position:0%
other's nails and technically that's
 
03:41:55.250 --> 03:41:55.260 align:start position:0%
illegal is anybody going to do anything
 
03:41:59.389 --> 03:41:59.399 align:start position:0%
about it no no it's I mean it's common
 
03:42:02.269 --> 03:42:02.279 align:start position:0%
sense but I've also seen people who are
 
03:42:05.450 --> 03:42:05.460 align:start position:0%
cutting hair not for renumeration but
 
03:42:07.370 --> 03:42:07.380 align:start position:0%
they're getting renumeration
 
03:42:09.769 --> 03:42:09.779 align:start position:0%
because they're not licensed so they're
 
03:42:11.210 --> 03:42:11.220 align:start position:0%
they're doing the services they're
 
03:42:11.220 --> 03:42:12.650 align:start position:0%
they're doing the services they're
performing

03:42:12.650 --> 03:42:12.660 align:start position:0%
performing
 
03:42:14.389 --> 03:42:14.399 align:start position:0%
um you know they're performing services
 
03:42:15.710 --> 03:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
on people
 
03:42:18.290 --> 03:42:18.300 align:start position:0%
and again it's not about cutting hair
 
03:42:20.929 --> 03:42:20.939 align:start position:0%
it's about the transmission and the or
 
03:42:23.030 --> 03:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
the prevention of the transmission of
 
03:42:25.790 --> 03:42:25.800 align:start position:0%
diseases and infections that's my
 
03:42:29.090 --> 03:42:29.100 align:start position:0%
biggest that's my only gripe about this
 
03:42:33.170 --> 03:42:33.180 align:start position:0%
so Mr vegetti so you're okay I guess in
 
03:42:34.610 --> 03:42:34.620 align:start position:0%
essence with Selective enforcement
 
03:42:36.410 --> 03:42:36.420 align:start position:0%
within the statute
 
03:42:38.269 --> 03:42:38.279 align:start position:0%
well so
 
03:42:39.710 --> 03:42:39.720 align:start position:0%
if they're if they're going to enforce
 
03:42:41.090 --> 03:42:41.100 align:start position:0%
it and they enforce it that's one thing
 
03:42:43.849 --> 03:42:43.859 align:start position:0%
we have like think two inspectors for
 
03:42:45.469 --> 03:42:45.479 align:start position:0%
the whole state of New Hampshire
 
03:42:48.650 --> 03:42:48.660 align:start position:0%
I know there are maybe 1500 Barbers and
 
03:42:50.750 --> 03:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
15 000 cosmetologists and I don't know
 
03:42:52.849 --> 03:42:52.859 align:start position:0%
how many estheticians
 
03:42:54.410 --> 03:42:54.420 align:start position:0%
um selective enforcement is one thing
 
03:42:57.290 --> 03:42:57.300 align:start position:0%
common sense is another
 
03:42:58.849 --> 03:42:58.859 align:start position:0%
representative schuett do you have a
 
03:42:58.859 --> 03:43:00.590 align:start position:0%
representative schuett do you have a
question

03:43:00.590 --> 03:43:00.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:43:02.809 --> 03:43:02.819 align:start position:0%
yes I do thank you
 
03:43:02.819 --> 03:43:03.530 align:start position:0%
yes I do thank you
um

03:43:03.530 --> 03:43:03.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:06.889 --> 03:43:06.899 align:start position:0%
just thinking back to the comments made
 
03:43:06.899 --> 03:43:08.050 align:start position:0%
just thinking back to the comments made
about

03:43:08.050 --> 03:43:08.060 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:43:12.670 --> 03:43:12.680 align:start position:0%
boxed dies that one can buy uh in
 
03:43:16.130 --> 03:43:16.140 align:start position:0%
various stores
 
03:43:16.140 --> 03:43:17.650 align:start position:0%
various stores
um

03:43:17.650 --> 03:43:17.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:20.830 --> 03:43:20.840 align:start position:0%
I have to admit I have used them myself
 
03:43:23.510 --> 03:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
would you believe Mr mayachetti that
 
03:43:27.070 --> 03:43:27.080 align:start position:0%
those boxes always have warnings
 
03:43:29.510 --> 03:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
inherent in them
 
03:43:33.229 --> 03:43:33.239 align:start position:0%
and always recommend that someone that
 
03:43:37.130 --> 03:43:37.140 align:start position:0%
use them would do a test on themselves
 
03:43:39.769 --> 03:43:39.779 align:start position:0%
to be sure that they don't have an
 
03:43:41.929 --> 03:43:41.939 align:start position:0%
allergy or a problem with the chemicals
 
03:43:44.210 --> 03:43:44.220 align:start position:0%
and would you believe that most people
 
03:43:47.090 --> 03:43:47.100 align:start position:0%
probably ignore those warnings I would
 
03:43:52.550 --> 03:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:54.410 --> 03:43:54.420 align:start position:0%
all right thank you Marissa branchetti
 
03:43:55.849 --> 03:43:55.859 align:start position:0%
for your testimony we're going to the
 
03:43:58.750 --> 03:43:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:04.910 --> 03:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:07.250 --> 03:44:07.260 align:start position:0%
hi my name is Jean Chappelle
 
03:44:12.170 --> 03:44:12.180 align:start position:0%
and I am the school owner member of the
 
03:44:13.610 --> 03:44:13.620 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Board of barbering
 
03:44:16.849 --> 03:44:16.859 align:start position:0%
cosmetology and Aesthetics
 
03:44:19.610 --> 03:44:19.620 align:start position:0%
um and we I am representing the board
 
03:44:23.210 --> 03:44:23.220 align:start position:0%
today not myself personally
 
03:44:25.250 --> 03:44:25.260 align:start position:0%
um I want to say first that I can answer
 
03:44:28.010 --> 03:44:28.020 align:start position:0%
several of the questions that were asked
 
03:44:30.710 --> 03:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
um by the representatives earlier in
 
03:44:32.929 --> 03:44:32.939 align:start position:0%
this conversation
 
03:44:34.849 --> 03:44:34.859 align:start position:0%
um I would also like to say that we
 
03:44:36.830 --> 03:44:36.840 align:start position:0%
strongly oppose
 
03:44:41.450 --> 03:44:41.460 align:start position:0%
House Bill 606 as written no other
 
03:44:43.490 --> 03:44:43.500 align:start position:0%
licensed profession has exemptions for
 
03:44:45.290 --> 03:44:45.300 align:start position:0%
unlicensed workers to perform their
 
03:44:47.389 --> 03:44:47.399 align:start position:0%
activities legally just because they are
 
03:44:49.790 --> 03:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
not being paid
 
03:44:52.849 --> 03:44:52.859 align:start position:0%
licensing protects the public health and
 
03:44:55.370 --> 03:44:55.380 align:start position:0%
safety in our industry and is not
 
03:44:57.530 --> 03:44:57.540 align:start position:0%
intended to extend the arm of the law
 
03:45:00.110 --> 03:45:00.120 align:start position:0%
into someone's home where a private
 
03:45:02.090 --> 03:45:02.100 align:start position:0%
citizen might unclog their neighbor's
 
03:45:05.809 --> 03:45:05.819 align:start position:0%
drain or help someone turn a light bulb
 
03:45:09.290 --> 03:45:09.300 align:start position:0%
or change a fuse or cut their child's
 
03:45:12.530 --> 03:45:12.540 align:start position:0%
hair there already are in place
 
03:45:14.990 --> 03:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
statues laws and rules
 
03:45:17.889 --> 03:45:17.899 align:start position:0%
that allow for
 
03:45:20.690 --> 03:45:20.700 align:start position:0%
individuals who are licensed to go into
 
03:45:23.210 --> 03:45:23.220 align:start position:0%
people's homes who are Homebound and
 
03:45:25.550 --> 03:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
take care of their hair
 
03:45:25.560 --> 03:45:26.330 align:start position:0%
take care of their hair
um

03:45:26.330 --> 03:45:26.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:45:28.729 --> 03:45:28.739 align:start position:0%
as far as consent I would say that
 
03:45:31.670 --> 03:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
consent plays a huge role in that
 
03:45:34.010 --> 03:45:34.020 align:start position:0%
somebody who consensually allows someone
 
03:45:35.570 --> 03:45:35.580 align:start position:0%
in their home
 
03:45:38.809 --> 03:45:38.819 align:start position:0%
to practice some form of hygiene on them
 
03:45:41.750 --> 03:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
is also not likely to call the police on
 
03:45:43.910 --> 03:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
that person to report them for
 
03:45:48.769 --> 03:45:48.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:48.779 --> 03:45:50.750 align:start position:0%
 
please

03:45:50.750 --> 03:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
please
 
03:45:53.809 --> 03:45:53.819 align:start position:0%
deem this bill in expedient to legislate
 
03:45:56.030 --> 03:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
as written the Board of barbering
 
03:45:58.610 --> 03:45:58.620 align:start position:0%
cosmetology and Aesthetics opposes bill
 
03:45:58.620 --> 03:46:00.889 align:start position:0%
cosmetology and Aesthetics opposes bill
606.

03:46:00.889 --> 03:46:00.899 align:start position:0%
606.
 
03:46:07.670 --> 03:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:17.389 --> 03:46:17.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:19.790 --> 03:46:19.800 align:start position:0%
seeing that I will then uh
 
03:46:26.269 --> 03:46:26.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:29.389 --> 03:46:29.399 align:start position:0%
the testify
 
03:46:29.399 --> 03:46:31.550 align:start position:0%
the testify
yeah

03:46:31.550 --> 03:46:31.560 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:46:36.290 --> 03:46:36.300 align:start position:0%

in that case representative introduce
 
03:47:12.290 --> 03:47:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:15.229 --> 03:47:15.239 align:start position:0%
sponsors here
 
03:47:15.239 --> 03:47:20.450 align:start position:0%
sponsors here
sure

03:47:20.450 --> 03:47:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:23.150 --> 03:47:23.160 align:start position:0%
so my name is representative Mark Lago
 
03:47:25.969 --> 03:47:25.979 align:start position:0%
I'm from Grafton 7th District covering
 
03:47:27.889 --> 03:47:27.899 align:start position:0%
the town of Camden
 
03:47:30.110 --> 03:47:30.120 align:start position:0%
and I'm introducing please correct me if
 
03:47:32.330 --> 03:47:32.340 align:start position:0%
I'm mistake because it's filing for my
 
03:47:33.410 --> 03:47:33.420 align:start position:0%
bills here
 
03:47:35.510 --> 03:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
HB 575
 
03:47:35.520 --> 03:47:36.889 align:start position:0%
HB 575
correct

03:47:36.889 --> 03:47:36.899 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:47:39.710 --> 03:47:39.720 align:start position:0%
which is an act relative to licensure of
 
03:47:42.290 --> 03:47:42.300 align:start position:0%
applicants for cosmetology Aesthetics
 
03:47:44.330 --> 03:47:44.340 align:start position:0%
and manicuring
 
03:47:46.250 --> 03:47:46.260 align:start position:0%
uh if I'm reading correctly the bill
 
03:47:47.870 --> 03:47:47.880 align:start position:0%
expands the use of apprenticeship
 
03:47:50.630 --> 03:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
programs in those fields in qualifying
 
03:47:52.910 --> 03:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
for licensures cosmetologists manicures
 
03:47:55.309 --> 03:47:55.319 align:start position:0%
or esthetician but for the barbering
 
03:47:58.729 --> 03:47:58.739 align:start position:0%
cosmetology anesthetics and manager are
 
03:48:01.670 --> 03:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:02.929 --> 03:48:02.939 align:start position:0%
whether or
 
03:48:05.389 --> 03:48:05.399 align:start position:0%
not going to take questions
 
03:48:08.389 --> 03:48:08.399 align:start position:0%
yes and uh
 
03:48:10.729 --> 03:48:10.739 align:start position:0%
clearly not qualified but still willing
 
03:48:13.969 --> 03:48:13.979 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions that I made from
 
03:48:19.729 --> 03:48:19.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:25.250 --> 03:48:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:27.650 --> 03:48:27.660 align:start position:0%
Mr Chappelle you signed up to speak
 
03:48:33.349 --> 03:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:36.530 --> 03:48:36.540 align:start position:0%
I would thank you representative McGuire
 
03:48:38.510 --> 03:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
um again I'm Gene Chappelle I am the
 
03:48:40.250 --> 03:48:40.260 align:start position:0%
school owner member of the cosmetology
 
03:48:42.769 --> 03:48:42.779 align:start position:0%
Board of New Hampshire and it's
 
03:48:46.550 --> 03:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
cosmetology barbering and Aesthetics
 
03:48:50.570 --> 03:48:50.580 align:start position:0%
um as far as House Bill 575 goes in a
 
03:48:53.150 --> 03:48:53.160 align:start position:0%
shop apprenticeship program it is widely
 
03:48:56.090 --> 03:48:56.100 align:start position:0%
accepted as in other professions that
 
03:48:57.950 --> 03:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
the instructor is a current practitioner
 
03:49:00.769 --> 03:49:00.779 align:start position:0%
who is continuing and working to
 
03:49:02.450 --> 03:49:02.460 align:start position:0%
maintain their own practice and
 
03:49:04.910 --> 03:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
profession for their own income
 
03:49:07.070 --> 03:49:07.080 align:start position:0%
this of course means that the Apprentice
 
03:49:09.950 --> 03:49:09.960 align:start position:0%
student is the second priority and is
 
03:49:12.830 --> 03:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
either watching or practicing alone
 
03:49:15.469 --> 03:49:15.479 align:start position:0%
while they are in a shop apprenticeship
 
03:49:19.610 --> 03:49:19.620 align:start position:0%
program not getting undivided attention
 
03:49:21.710 --> 03:49:21.720 align:start position:0%
therefore needing more time to become
 
03:49:24.410 --> 03:49:24.420 align:start position:0%
proficient also the instructor is
 
03:49:26.809 --> 03:49:26.819 align:start position:0%
currently not required in the shop to be
 
03:49:28.610 --> 03:49:28.620 align:start position:0%
a licensed instructor
 
03:49:31.490 --> 03:49:31.500 align:start position:0%
any licensed cosmetologist Barber or
 
03:49:34.849 --> 03:49:34.859 align:start position:0%
esthetician can be a an instructor for
 
03:49:36.830 --> 03:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
an apprentice
 
03:49:39.110 --> 03:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
that is a dangerous situation for that
 
03:49:39.120 --> 03:49:40.190 align:start position:0%
that is a dangerous situation for that
Apprentice

03:49:40.190 --> 03:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
Apprentice
 
03:49:42.229 --> 03:49:42.239 align:start position:0%
we are still not opposed to the
 
03:49:43.849 --> 03:49:43.859 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship program there is
 
03:49:46.429 --> 03:49:46.439 align:start position:0%
absolutely room for an apprenticeship
 
03:49:49.929 --> 03:49:49.939 align:start position:0%
program the other
 
03:49:51.889 --> 03:49:51.899 align:start position:0%
consideration with the apprenticeship
 
03:49:55.389 --> 03:49:55.399 align:start position:0%
program is that it is one Apprentice per
 
03:49:57.950 --> 03:49:57.960 align:start position:0%
practitioner unless you are a barber in
 
03:49:59.630 --> 03:49:59.640 align:start position:0%
which case you can have two apprentices
 
03:50:03.170 --> 03:50:03.180 align:start position:0%
so it also actually limits the amount of
 
03:50:06.889 --> 03:50:06.899 align:start position:0%
apprentices that can be taught
 
03:50:08.450 --> 03:50:08.460 align:start position:0%
um the instructor is currently not
 
03:50:10.370 --> 03:50:10.380 align:start position:0%
required in the shop to be a licensed
 
03:50:12.650 --> 03:50:12.660 align:start position:0%
instructor just a practitioner therefore
 
03:50:14.929 --> 03:50:14.939 align:start position:0%
they may not have any teaching education
 
03:50:18.710 --> 03:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
or experience so again it is more
 
03:50:18.720 --> 03:50:20.330 align:start position:0%
or experience so again it is more
important

03:50:20.330 --> 03:50:20.340 align:start position:0%
important
 
03:50:22.790 --> 03:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
um to have more time with that
 
03:50:25.550 --> 03:50:25.560 align:start position:0%
practitioner in a school setting it is
 
03:50:28.010 --> 03:50:28.020 align:start position:0%
required that all instructors are
 
03:50:31.309 --> 03:50:31.319 align:start position:0%
licensed and the primary goal of every
 
03:50:34.309 --> 03:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
instructor is the education of the
 
03:50:36.469 --> 03:50:36.479 align:start position:0%
student and that is their first priority
 
03:50:39.889 --> 03:50:39.899 align:start position:0%
it is their only priority they are not
 
03:50:43.070 --> 03:50:43.080 align:start position:0%
maintaining a clientele while they are
 
03:50:45.710 --> 03:50:45.720 align:start position:0%
teaching the students in fact they are
 
03:50:48.229 --> 03:50:48.239 align:start position:0%
prohibited from doing their own clients
 
03:50:50.750 --> 03:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
during school hours at the school while
 
03:50:53.269 --> 03:50:53.279 align:start position:0%
they are teaching so they're providing
 
03:50:55.370 --> 03:50:55.380 align:start position:0%
undivided attention to the students
 
03:50:58.910 --> 03:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
which is why the hours are reduced and
 
03:51:03.950 --> 03:51:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:06.229 --> 03:51:06.239 align:start position:0%
when a student is receiving uh
 
03:51:08.030 --> 03:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
instructed from a licensed instructor
 
03:51:09.830 --> 03:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
who is not permitted to work on their
 
03:51:12.229 --> 03:51:12.239 align:start position:0%
own clientele they are getting a
 
03:51:14.090 --> 03:51:14.100 align:start position:0%
different situation than they would get
 
03:51:17.150 --> 03:51:17.160 align:start position:0%
in a shop situation where they are very
 
03:51:18.769 --> 03:51:18.779 align:start position:0%
different and require very very
 
03:51:21.290 --> 03:51:21.300 align:start position:0%
different time demands
 
03:51:22.910 --> 03:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
um and speaking for the Board of
 
03:51:25.130 --> 03:51:25.140 align:start position:0%
Cosmetology barbering and Aesthetics we
 
03:51:29.450 --> 03:51:29.460 align:start position:0%
oppose House Bill 575 for these reasons
 
03:51:29.460 --> 03:51:35.389 align:start position:0%
oppose House Bill 575 for these reasons
ready

03:51:35.389 --> 03:51:35.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:37.309 --> 03:51:37.319 align:start position:0%
uh I just want to show you something
 
03:51:39.889 --> 03:51:39.899 align:start position:0%
command so
 
03:51:43.910 --> 03:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:46.070 --> 03:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
Bishop I presume you have the bill in
 
03:51:48.469 --> 03:51:48.479 align:start position:0%
front of you I do
 
03:51:51.410 --> 03:51:51.420 align:start position:0%
so as I'm reading starting in line 19
 
03:51:53.690 --> 03:51:53.700 align:start position:0%
that paragraph area where it talks about
 
03:51:56.450 --> 03:51:56.460 align:start position:0%
have you know completed a course of at
 
03:51:58.370 --> 03:51:58.380 align:start position:0%
least 600 hours
 
03:52:00.650 --> 03:52:00.660 align:start position:0%
with the new language basically then say
 
03:52:03.710 --> 03:52:03.720 align:start position:0%
which shall not exceed 600 hours we have
 
03:52:07.010 --> 03:52:07.020 align:start position:0%
put that number at exactly 600 hours
 
03:52:09.410 --> 03:52:09.420 align:start position:0%
because if it cannot be at least if it
 
03:52:12.110 --> 03:52:12.120 align:start position:0%
cannot be more that that's it that's the
 
03:52:15.290 --> 03:52:15.300 align:start position:0%
number is is the issue with the 600
 
03:52:19.250 --> 03:52:19.260 align:start position:0%
hours as a number or is it an issue with
 
03:52:23.990 --> 03:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
the overall process of having uh
 
03:52:27.110 --> 03:52:27.120 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship exists
 
03:52:29.630 --> 03:52:29.640 align:start position:0%
restricted time frame
 
03:52:32.090 --> 03:52:32.100 align:start position:0%
the problem is that currently
 
03:52:35.090 --> 03:52:35.100 align:start position:0%
um for the the required hours in a
 
03:52:38.630 --> 03:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
school for cosmetology is 1500 hours the
 
03:52:40.370 --> 03:52:40.380 align:start position:0%
requirement for the apprenticeship
 
03:52:42.769 --> 03:52:42.779 align:start position:0%
program is three thousand hours as it
 
03:52:45.349 --> 03:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
should be the requirement for Aesthetics
 
03:52:48.830 --> 03:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
in a school setting is 600 hours and the
 
03:52:51.349 --> 03:52:51.359 align:start position:0%
requirement for an apprenticeship in a
 
03:52:55.250 --> 03:52:55.260 align:start position:0%
shop is 1200 hours as it should be
 
03:52:57.530 --> 03:52:57.540 align:start position:0%
um the the requirement for barbering for
 
03:53:00.590 --> 03:53:00.600 align:start position:0%
a master Barber is 1500 hours in a
 
03:53:03.889 --> 03:53:03.899 align:start position:0%
school setting and it is 3 000 hours in
 
03:53:06.590 --> 03:53:06.600 align:start position:0%
a shop setting as it should be
 
03:53:08.870 --> 03:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
um what we are opposing is the reduction
 
03:53:11.450 --> 03:53:11.460 align:start position:0%
of the requirement of hours for in
 
03:53:16.370 --> 03:53:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:19.490 --> 03:53:19.500 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question no so
 
03:53:20.809 --> 03:53:20.819 align:start position:0%
you're saying that this bill is going to
 
03:53:23.030 --> 03:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
drop that from 3 000 hours down to 600
 
03:53:23.040 --> 03:53:24.010 align:start position:0%
drop that from 3 000 hours down to 600
hours

03:53:24.010 --> 03:53:24.020 align:start position:0%
hours
 
03:53:27.590 --> 03:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
no there are there are several
 
03:53:30.830 --> 03:53:30.840 align:start position:0%
disciplines that are um that are managed
 
03:53:32.929 --> 03:53:32.939 align:start position:0%
under the Board of barbering cosmetology
 
03:53:35.210 --> 03:53:35.220 align:start position:0%
and Aesthetics all of these separate
 
03:53:38.150 --> 03:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
disciplines have separate requirements
 
03:53:41.750 --> 03:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
of hours in order to complete the
 
03:53:44.750 --> 03:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
requirements to appeal to test for your
 
03:53:47.150 --> 03:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
practical exam and your practical and
 
03:53:50.330 --> 03:53:50.340 align:start position:0%
your written exam for your state license
 
03:53:54.250 --> 03:53:54.260 align:start position:0%
currently Cosmetology in a school
 
03:53:57.469 --> 03:53:57.479 align:start position:0%
requires 1500 hours of Education as it
 
03:53:59.769 --> 03:53:59.779 align:start position:0%
should currently
 
03:54:03.050 --> 03:54:03.060 align:start position:0%
the in-shop apprenticeship requires
 
03:54:07.790 --> 03:54:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:09.889 --> 03:54:09.899 align:start position:0%
all the rest of the disciplines have
 
03:54:12.590 --> 03:54:12.600 align:start position:0%
separate hours of requirements for
 
03:54:15.469 --> 03:54:15.479 align:start position:0%
example nail technicians if they're in a
 
03:54:18.170 --> 03:54:18.180 align:start position:0%
formal School setting need to have 300
 
03:54:20.929 --> 03:54:20.939 align:start position:0%
hours in a licensed school in order to
 
03:54:22.550 --> 03:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
appeal to get their state license
 
03:54:24.590 --> 03:54:24.600 align:start position:0%
through the Practical exam and the
 
03:54:25.790 --> 03:54:25.800 align:start position:0%
written exam
 
03:54:28.490 --> 03:54:28.500 align:start position:0%
in a salon setting they need to
 
03:54:32.030 --> 03:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
Apprentice for 600 hours because they
 
03:54:34.309 --> 03:54:34.319 align:start position:0%
are not they're not in a formal School
 
03:54:34.319 --> 03:54:37.550 align:start position:0%
are not they're not in a formal School
setting

03:54:37.550 --> 03:54:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:39.469 --> 03:54:39.479 align:start position:0%
thank you Ms Chappelle that's very clear
 
03:54:46.010 --> 03:54:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:50.269 --> 03:54:50.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:53.349 --> 03:54:53.359 align:start position:0%
no one else has signed up on House Bill
 
03:54:56.450 --> 03:54:56.460 align:start position:0%
575. is there anyone else who wishes to
 
03:54:56.460 --> 03:55:00.950 align:start position:0%
575. is there anyone else who wishes to
testify

03:55:00.950 --> 03:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:04.969 --> 03:55:04.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:06.950 --> 03:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
very good I will close the public
 
03:55:12.950 --> 03:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:16.849 --> 03:55:16.859 align:start position:0%
Adam chair uh if I may I have a question
 
03:55:18.229 --> 03:55:18.239 align:start position:0%
of the chair
 
03:55:18.239 --> 03:55:19.729 align:start position:0%
of the chair
um

03:55:19.729 --> 03:55:19.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:23.809 --> 03:55:23.819 align:start position:0%
looking back at House Bill 173
 
03:55:28.130 --> 03:55:28.140 align:start position:0%
which according to my notes we exact on
 
03:55:30.729 --> 03:55:30.739 align:start position:0%
January 27th
 
03:55:33.950 --> 03:55:33.960 align:start position:0%
motion by representative Roy seconded by
 
03:55:36.889 --> 03:55:36.899 align:start position:0%
representative goalie and we voted at
 
03:55:39.769 --> 03:55:39.779 align:start position:0%
octopass for the consent calendar but
 
03:55:43.550 --> 03:55:43.560 align:start position:0%
I'm still not seeing the status of that
 
03:55:47.229 --> 03:55:47.239 align:start position:0%
bill showing that a report has been
 
03:55:47.239 --> 03:55:49.090 align:start position:0%
bill showing that a report has been
yes

03:55:49.090 --> 03:55:49.100 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:55:53.389 --> 03:55:53.399 align:start position:0%
the committee report was lost in the
 
03:55:56.030 --> 03:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
email for a while I have finally seen it
 
03:55:57.889 --> 03:55:57.899 align:start position:0%
and it is working its way through the
 
03:55:59.870 --> 03:55:59.880 align:start position:0%
system the staff
 
03:56:02.809 --> 03:56:02.819 align:start position:0%
as a flood right now thank you very much
 
03:56:04.610 --> 03:56:04.620 align:start position:0%
I was afraid something like that might
 
03:56:16.790 --> 03:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:18.590 --> 03:56:18.600 align:start position:0%
we have three minutes before the next
 
03:56:20.269 --> 03:56:20.279 align:start position:0%
hearing so everybody stand up and
 
03:56:20.279 --> 03:56:33.050 align:start position:0%
hearing so everybody stand up and
stretch

03:56:33.050 --> 03:56:33.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:34.910 --> 03:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
Carol can you hear me
 
03:56:36.710 --> 03:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
yes Peter
 
03:56:38.330 --> 03:56:38.340 align:start position:0%
uh um
 
03:56:40.910 --> 03:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
I haven't had any acknowledgment of the
 
03:56:43.990 --> 03:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
blurb that I sent to you Pam and Miriam
 
03:56:49.370 --> 03:56:49.380 align:start position:0%
a couple of nights ago on cacr7 did you
 
03:56:53.450 --> 03:56:53.460 align:start position:0%
receive I received it and passed it on I
 
03:56:55.010 --> 03:56:55.020 align:start position:0%
just put in the words that you said
 
03:57:01.010 --> 03:57:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:03.950 --> 03:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
okay I I just didn't I hadn't had any
 
03:57:06.469 --> 03:57:06.479 align:start position:0%
feedback I just wanted to make sure that
 
03:57:09.410 --> 03:57:09.420 align:start position:0%
uh it hadn't gone off into cyberspace
 
03:57:12.050 --> 03:57:12.060 align:start position:0%
so I encouraged the committee to assume
 
03:57:13.670 --> 03:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
that they've written a wonderful
 
03:57:16.429 --> 03:57:16.439 align:start position:0%
wonderful blurb and it has been moved on
 
03:57:18.469 --> 03:57:18.479 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:57:21.170 --> 03:57:21.180 align:start position:0%
if I if that's not the case believe me
 
03:57:23.210 --> 03:57:23.220 align:start position:0%
we'll be getting in touch with you
 
03:57:25.790 --> 03:57:25.800 align:start position:0%
well I I figured that you might well
 
03:57:30.290 --> 03:57:30.300 align:start position:0%
contact me uh inquiring uh as to the
 
03:57:33.050 --> 03:57:33.060 align:start position:0%
status of the blurb but again just
 
03:57:34.969 --> 03:57:34.979 align:start position:0%
because ordinarily I hear something back
 
03:57:38.229 --> 03:57:38.239 align:start position:0%
I I since we have
 
03:57:45.469 --> 03:57:45.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:47.050 --> 03:57:47.060 align:start position:0%
if I'm working its way through ecosystem
 
03:57:57.110 --> 03:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:59.090 --> 03:57:59.100 align:start position:0%
oh man that's had to answer the covet
 
03:58:01.400 --> 03:58:01.410 align:start position:0%
screening questions
 
03:58:01.410 --> 03:58:03.349 align:start position:0%
screening questions
[Music]

03:58:03.349 --> 03:58:03.359 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:58:08.469 --> 03:58:08.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:14.170 --> 03:58:14.180 align:start position:0%
shot no no this is for oh okay
 
03:58:22.849 --> 03:58:22.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:25.250 --> 03:58:25.260 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering you since since everybody
 
03:58:28.010 --> 03:58:28.020 align:start position:0%
is walking around and taking a break
 
03:58:31.790 --> 03:58:31.800 align:start position:0%
um does it seem to the people in the in
 
03:58:34.670 --> 03:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
the committee room as it does to me that
 
03:58:36.830 --> 03:58:36.840 align:start position:0%
the sound quality today is not up to
 
03:58:39.110 --> 03:58:39.120 align:start position:0%
what it has been recently it seems like
 
03:58:41.330 --> 03:58:41.340 align:start position:0%
there's a kind of the and kind of a
 
03:58:44.090 --> 03:58:44.100 align:start position:0%
sharp edge to the sound and a lot of
 
03:58:48.410 --> 03:58:48.420 align:start position:0%
enough background and noise that it's
 
03:58:51.349 --> 03:58:51.359 align:start position:0%
not great on our end I think it's
 
03:58:51.359 --> 03:58:53.410 align:start position:0%
not great on our end I think it's
dramatically

03:58:53.410 --> 03:58:53.420 align:start position:0%
dramatically
 
03:58:56.450 --> 03:58:56.460 align:start position:0%
exactly dramatically better that's the
 
03:58:59.750 --> 03:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
same to me I don't know
 
03:58:59.760 --> 03:59:03.170 align:start position:0%
same to me I don't know
okay

03:59:03.170 --> 03:59:03.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:08.210 --> 03:59:08.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:10.490 --> 03:59:10.500 align:start position:0%
yes sometimes
 
03:59:12.410 --> 03:59:12.420 align:start position:0%
my phone you might need to move to
 
03:59:15.290 --> 03:59:15.300 align:start position:0%
another part of your house I found that
 
03:59:21.590 --> 03:59:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:32.050 --> 03:59:32.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:34.910 --> 03:59:34.920 align:start position:0%
exactly and sometimes I have to turn off
 
03:59:39.050 --> 03:59:39.060 align:start position:0%
the Wi-Fi access for my zoom and use
 
03:59:43.189 --> 03:59:43.199 align:start position:0%
actual cell phone bandwidth through my
 
03:59:47.090 --> 03:59:47.100 align:start position:0%
my cell provider rather than Wi-Fi so it
 
03:59:47.100 --> 03:59:51.290 align:start position:0%
my cell provider rather than Wi-Fi so it
varies

03:59:51.290 --> 03:59:51.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:53.510 --> 03:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
two o'clock
 
04:00:02.090 --> 04:00:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:04.849 --> 04:00:04.859 align:start position:0%
we all set Madam chair
 
04:00:07.670 --> 04:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
yes sir please speak okay
 
04:00:09.469 --> 04:00:09.479 align:start position:0%
um I did submit my written testimony and
 
04:00:11.570 --> 04:00:11.580 align:start position:0%
as I promised I will not read it
 
04:00:13.910 --> 04:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh but I will go over it
 
04:00:16.370 --> 04:00:16.380 align:start position:0%
so for the record my name is Gary
 
04:00:18.530 --> 04:00:18.540 align:start position:0%
Merchant I'm a representative
 
04:00:21.530 --> 04:00:21.540 align:start position:0%
from Claremont New Hampshire Ward 2. and
 
04:00:23.510 --> 04:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to introduce house bill
 
04:00:23.520 --> 04:00:25.189 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to introduce house bill
444.

04:00:25.189 --> 04:00:25.199 align:start position:0%
444.
 
04:00:27.950 --> 04:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
the intent to House Bill 444 is to make
 
04:00:31.130 --> 04:00:31.140 align:start position:0%
some technical changes to the RSA 318
 
04:00:33.229 --> 04:00:33.239 align:start position:0%
which governs the pharmacist and
 
04:00:33.239 --> 04:00:35.330 align:start position:0%
which governs the pharmacist and
pharmacies

04:00:35.330 --> 04:00:35.340 align:start position:0%
pharmacies
 
04:00:38.689 --> 04:00:38.699 align:start position:0%
so in sequence the first one I'd like to
 
04:00:40.670 --> 04:00:40.680 align:start position:0%
talk to the committee about is
 
04:00:43.309 --> 04:00:43.319 align:start position:0%
compounding for those who've been on
 
04:00:46.250 --> 04:00:46.260 align:start position:0%
this committee for a few terms
 
04:00:49.130 --> 04:00:49.140 align:start position:0%
you may go back and
 
04:00:51.469 --> 04:00:51.479 align:start position:0%
remember that there was some just some
 
04:00:54.170 --> 04:00:54.180 align:start position:0%
concern about the pharmacy board with
 
04:00:56.630 --> 04:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
inspecting Physicians offices related to
 
04:00:56.640 --> 04:00:58.189 align:start position:0%
inspecting Physicians offices related to
compounding

04:00:58.189 --> 04:00:58.199 align:start position:0%
compounding
 
04:01:00.229 --> 04:01:00.239 align:start position:0%
the challenge the board faced at that
 
04:01:02.809 --> 04:01:02.819 align:start position:0%
time and still does is the fact that
 
04:01:02.819 --> 04:01:04.250 align:start position:0%
time and still does is the fact that
compounding

04:01:04.250 --> 04:01:04.260 align:start position:0%
compounding
 
04:01:07.130 --> 04:01:07.140 align:start position:0%
in the law requires the board to comply
 
04:01:10.610 --> 04:01:10.620 align:start position:0%
with USB standards not to utilize the
 
04:01:12.889 --> 04:01:12.899 align:start position:0%
standards but the time in which the
 
04:01:15.790 --> 04:01:15.800 align:start position:0%
board was looking at Physician Offices
 
04:01:19.130 --> 04:01:19.140 align:start position:0%
the board was not allowed to use the FDA
 
04:01:21.530 --> 04:01:21.540 align:start position:0%
standard which was drug preparation
 
04:01:23.929 --> 04:01:23.939 align:start position:0%
which is the final stage of bearing a
 
04:01:26.150 --> 04:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
drug to a patient through the
 
04:01:27.710 --> 04:01:27.720 align:start position:0%
manufacturing process
 
04:01:30.290 --> 04:01:30.300 align:start position:0%
and because of that conflict the board
 
04:01:32.689 --> 04:01:32.699 align:start position:0%
had no choice but to sort of enforce a
 
04:01:32.699 --> 04:01:33.410 align:start position:0%
had no choice but to sort of enforce a
law

04:01:33.410 --> 04:01:33.420 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:01:35.269 --> 04:01:35.279 align:start position:0%
that it really didn't believe in but
 
04:01:37.250 --> 04:01:37.260 align:start position:0%
unfortunately law required it
 
04:01:39.070 --> 04:01:39.080 align:start position:0%
so what I'm trying to Simply do today
 
04:01:42.889 --> 04:01:42.899 align:start position:0%
with change in the language is to allow
 
04:01:45.229 --> 04:01:45.239 align:start position:0%
some flexibility for the board
 
04:01:47.630 --> 04:01:47.640 align:start position:0%
to use the standards or any other
 
04:01:50.389 --> 04:01:50.399 align:start position:0%
standards that they feel are applicable
 
04:01:53.210 --> 04:01:53.220 align:start position:0%
to the world of compounding without
 
04:01:54.830 --> 04:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
getting into a situation where they
 
04:01:57.530 --> 04:01:57.540 align:start position:0%
blindly follows national standards that
 
04:01:59.090 --> 04:01:59.100 align:start position:0%
the board may not
 
04:02:01.910 --> 04:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
believe is appropriate for the State of
 
04:02:03.769 --> 04:02:03.779 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire northward citizens
 
04:02:05.570 --> 04:02:05.580 align:start position:0%
and this is coming from my 10 years on
 
04:02:07.969 --> 04:02:07.979 align:start position:0%
the board serving the last two years as
 
04:02:10.189 --> 04:02:10.199 align:start position:0%
the president so that's the first one
 
04:02:12.530 --> 04:02:12.540 align:start position:0%
with compounding is this simply taking
 
04:02:15.530 --> 04:02:15.540 align:start position:0%
the word shall and saying they may
 
04:02:18.650 --> 04:02:18.660 align:start position:0%
utilize the standards
 
04:02:22.550 --> 04:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
on to the next one is the word of
 
04:02:24.650 --> 04:02:24.660 align:start position:0%
inspecting of pharmacies I'd like to
 
04:02:26.090 --> 04:02:26.100 align:start position:0%
leave that one if I may Madam chair
 
04:02:27.590 --> 04:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
towards the end I think that's the more
 
04:02:29.030 --> 04:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
challenging one
 
04:02:32.269 --> 04:02:32.279 align:start position:0%
in regards to the work of labeling the
 
04:02:32.279 --> 04:02:33.590 align:start position:0%
in regards to the work of labeling the
prescription

04:02:33.590 --> 04:02:33.600 align:start position:0%
prescription
 
04:02:36.950 --> 04:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
the days in which a pharmacist was a
 
04:02:39.170 --> 04:02:39.180 align:start position:0%
soul person behind the prescription
 
04:02:41.689 --> 04:02:41.699 align:start position:0%
counter in which they receive the
 
04:02:41.699 --> 04:02:43.130 align:start position:0%
counter in which they receive the
prescription

04:02:43.130 --> 04:02:43.140 align:start position:0%
prescription
 
04:02:45.590 --> 04:02:45.600 align:start position:0%
fill the prescription wrote the
 
04:02:47.090 --> 04:02:47.100 align:start position:0%
prescription typed the label and
 
04:02:49.010 --> 04:02:49.020 align:start position:0%
everything else there was really one
 
04:02:50.990 --> 04:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
person in the pharmacy doing the work
 
04:02:54.050 --> 04:02:54.060 align:start position:0%
and that was the pharmacist a comp a lot
 
04:02:56.510 --> 04:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
of times they may have help from
 
04:02:59.689 --> 04:02:59.699 align:start position:0%
um at that time support staff they
 
04:03:01.729 --> 04:03:01.739 align:start position:0%
weren't technicians per se what's
 
04:03:04.610 --> 04:03:04.620 align:start position:0%
happened over the course of time is that
 
04:03:06.590 --> 04:03:06.600 align:start position:0%
the restricting filling process has now
 
04:03:09.769 --> 04:03:09.779 align:start position:0%
been broken into various steps so you
 
04:03:11.809 --> 04:03:11.819 align:start position:0%
have the intake of the prescription
 
04:03:14.389 --> 04:03:14.399 align:start position:0%
which is I believe the most critical is
 
04:03:15.710 --> 04:03:15.720 align:start position:0%
for the pharmacist to review that
 
04:03:17.830 --> 04:03:17.840 align:start position:0%
prescription and make the determination
 
04:03:21.530 --> 04:03:21.540 align:start position:0%
whether they should fill it or not
 
04:03:23.750 --> 04:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
so therefore we created the licensed
 
04:03:26.150 --> 04:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
technician last time to allow the
 
04:03:27.889 --> 04:03:27.899 align:start position:0%
technician to do the product
 
04:03:30.530 --> 04:03:30.540 align:start position:0%
verification to the final stages with
 
04:03:32.450 --> 04:03:32.460 align:start position:0%
the technical side of building a
 
04:03:32.460 --> 04:03:33.650 align:start position:0%
the technical side of building a
prescription

04:03:33.650 --> 04:03:33.660 align:start position:0%
prescription
 
04:03:36.290 --> 04:03:36.300 align:start position:0%
so I think it's more appropriate to
 
04:03:37.849 --> 04:03:37.859 align:start position:0%
include the initials of the pharmacist
 
04:03:39.469 --> 04:03:39.479 align:start position:0%
that actually reviewed the prescription
 
04:03:41.689 --> 04:03:41.699 align:start position:0%
who approved the prescription
 
04:03:43.969 --> 04:03:43.979 align:start position:0%
than a person who may be on somewhere in
 
04:03:46.550 --> 04:03:46.560 align:start position:0%
that chain of events to say
 
04:03:48.769 --> 04:03:48.779 align:start position:0%
that's the person that the patient's
 
04:03:51.290 --> 04:03:51.300 align:start position:0%
looking for or anyone else and
 
04:03:52.670 --> 04:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
definitely using the pharmacist in
 
04:03:54.950 --> 04:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
charge initials doesn't tie it back to
 
04:03:57.229 --> 04:03:57.239 align:start position:0%
the actual prescription so what I'm
 
04:03:59.990 --> 04:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
trying to suggest in the bill is to
 
04:04:02.030 --> 04:04:02.040 align:start position:0%
allow for the board
 
04:04:04.490 --> 04:04:04.500 align:start position:0%
to require the initials of the
 
04:04:07.790 --> 04:04:07.800 align:start position:0%
pharmacist who did the review process
 
04:04:13.910 --> 04:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:15.889 --> 04:04:15.899 align:start position:0%
collaborative practice
 
04:04:17.210 --> 04:04:17.220 align:start position:0%
the challenge with collaborative
 
04:04:17.220 --> 04:04:18.530 align:start position:0%
the challenge with collaborative
practice

04:04:18.530 --> 04:04:18.540 align:start position:0%
practice
 
04:04:20.929 --> 04:04:20.939 align:start position:0%
one of the challenges and it became very
 
04:04:23.150 --> 04:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
evident today with Telehealth
 
04:04:26.630 --> 04:04:26.640 align:start position:0%
to require a patient to sign an
 
04:04:29.030 --> 04:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
agreement between a pharmacist and a
 
04:04:29.040 --> 04:04:30.349 align:start position:0%
agreement between a pharmacist and a
provider

04:04:30.349 --> 04:04:30.359 align:start position:0%
provider
 
04:04:31.910 --> 04:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
means that they have to review the
 
04:04:31.920 --> 04:04:32.929 align:start position:0%
means that they have to review the
agreement

04:04:32.929 --> 04:04:32.939 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
04:04:34.969 --> 04:04:34.979 align:start position:0%
understand the agreement
 
04:04:37.130 --> 04:04:37.140 align:start position:0%
and assigned consent to the agreement we
 
04:04:38.570 --> 04:04:38.580 align:start position:0%
do not in any other part of medical
 
04:04:41.210 --> 04:04:41.220 align:start position:0%
community that I know of require a
 
04:04:43.849 --> 04:04:43.859 align:start position:0%
patient to sign a document like that we
 
04:04:46.010 --> 04:04:46.020 align:start position:0%
don't ask them to sign and review the
 
04:04:49.070 --> 04:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
document between a position in the
 
04:04:52.250 --> 04:04:52.260 align:start position:0%
VA we don't ask them to assign a
 
04:04:54.410 --> 04:04:54.420 align:start position:0%
referral to go to physical therapy or go
 
04:04:55.429 --> 04:04:55.439 align:start position:0%
to a lab
 
04:04:58.729 --> 04:04:58.739 align:start position:0%
so what I'm asking for here is to not
 
04:05:01.010 --> 04:05:01.020 align:start position:0%
require the patient to sign the
 
04:05:02.630 --> 04:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
agreement they still have to give their
 
04:05:04.729 --> 04:05:04.739 align:start position:0%
consent because ultimately if they
 
04:05:06.469 --> 04:05:06.479 align:start position:0%
decide to go for the referral or not
 
04:05:07.910 --> 04:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
that's their choice
 
04:05:10.010 --> 04:05:10.020 align:start position:0%
and then number two the word attending
 
04:05:12.650 --> 04:05:12.660 align:start position:0%
is problematic because it provides a
 
04:05:14.269 --> 04:05:14.279 align:start position:0%
level of ambiguity
 
04:05:18.229 --> 04:05:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:21.590 --> 04:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
is that when you talk about attending is
 
04:05:23.990 --> 04:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
the primary care physician or is it the
 
04:05:25.969 --> 04:05:25.979 align:start position:0%
doc who's taking care of a particular
 
04:05:28.429 --> 04:05:28.439 align:start position:0%
disease state today most patients go to
 
04:05:30.349 --> 04:05:30.359 align:start position:0%
multiple Physicians multiple providers
 
04:05:32.510 --> 04:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
if you have a cardiologist you have a
 
04:05:34.849 --> 04:05:34.859 align:start position:0%
rheumatologist you have a orthopedic
 
04:05:36.889 --> 04:05:36.899 align:start position:0%
surgeon and so forth you may be under
 
04:05:38.809 --> 04:05:38.819 align:start position:0%
their care but you're not their primary
 
04:05:41.630 --> 04:05:41.640 align:start position:0%
care so by deleting the word attending
 
04:05:44.210 --> 04:05:44.220 align:start position:0%
and making it more broad dealing with
 
04:05:47.030 --> 04:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
the patient's practitioner it allows for
 
04:05:49.490 --> 04:05:49.500 align:start position:0%
each practitioner the patient sees to
 
04:05:50.929 --> 04:05:50.939 align:start position:0%
enter into a collaborative agreement
 
04:05:52.370 --> 04:05:52.380 align:start position:0%
with a pharmacist
 
04:05:54.229 --> 04:05:54.239 align:start position:0%
so that's the intent between those two
 
04:05:56.570 --> 04:05:56.580 align:start position:0%
changes one is not to require the
 
04:05:59.030 --> 04:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
patient to sign the document and to lead
 
04:06:02.210 --> 04:06:02.220 align:start position:0%
the word attending in order to broaden
 
04:06:04.010 --> 04:06:04.020 align:start position:0%
the scope to allow patients to see
 
04:06:05.450 --> 04:06:05.460 align:start position:0%
multiple Physicians to have multiple
 
04:06:08.870 --> 04:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:12.170 --> 04:06:12.180 align:start position:0%
in regards to permits and fees
 
04:06:14.090 --> 04:06:14.100 align:start position:0%
that's something we talked about last
 
04:06:17.090 --> 04:06:17.100 align:start position:0%
time when this was before the committee
 
04:06:18.469 --> 04:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
which I sat on
 
04:06:19.790 --> 04:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
by the way it's good to see everybody
 
04:06:23.510 --> 04:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
all again even though it's virtual but
 
04:06:25.670 --> 04:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
what happens is that we have a situation
 
04:06:27.830 --> 04:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
now in Pharmacy the roots of Pharmacy
 
04:06:30.110 --> 04:06:30.120 align:start position:0%
was you had an independent Pharmacy
 
04:06:32.570 --> 04:06:32.580 align:start position:0%
and it was owned by a pharmacist
 
04:06:34.790 --> 04:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
and the pharmacist and the owner were
 
04:06:36.349 --> 04:06:36.359 align:start position:0%
basically wanted the same
 
04:06:39.050 --> 04:06:39.060 align:start position:0%
those days are gone most pharmacies
 
04:06:41.809 --> 04:06:41.819 align:start position:0%
today are owned by Corporate America
 
04:06:43.610 --> 04:06:43.620 align:start position:0%
and the pharmacist is still responsible
 
04:06:46.130 --> 04:06:46.140 align:start position:0%
and accountable to the Board of Pharmacy
 
04:06:47.689 --> 04:06:47.699 align:start position:0%
for compliance of all the rules and
 
04:06:47.699 --> 04:06:49.010 align:start position:0%
for compliance of all the rules and
regulations

04:06:49.010 --> 04:06:49.020 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
04:06:51.590 --> 04:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
however that person no longer owns the
 
04:06:53.750 --> 04:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
pharmacy and therefore does not have a
 
04:06:55.790 --> 04:06:55.800 align:start position:0%
lot of control over the resources to
 
04:06:57.410 --> 04:06:57.420 align:start position:0%
operate that Pharmacy and to operate it
 
04:07:00.110 --> 04:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
safely so what I'm advocating for in the
 
04:07:02.870 --> 04:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
bill and suggesting to this committee is
 
04:07:04.490 --> 04:07:04.500 align:start position:0%
that we level the playing field and say
 
04:07:06.530 --> 04:07:06.540 align:start position:0%
both parties have responsibility to the
 
04:07:09.410 --> 04:07:09.420 align:start position:0%
board both the pharmacists in charge as
 
04:07:11.269 --> 04:07:11.279 align:start position:0%
well as to the owner the owners
 
04:07:12.830 --> 04:07:12.840 align:start position:0%
responsible to be sure that the
 
04:07:14.450 --> 04:07:14.460 align:start position:0%
appropriate resources are provided to
 
04:07:15.889 --> 04:07:15.899 align:start position:0%
the pharmacist in charge
 
04:07:17.990 --> 04:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
and the pharmacist in charge is
 
04:07:20.150 --> 04:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
responsible to use those resources
 
04:07:21.290 --> 04:07:21.300 align:start position:0%
appropriately so it's a joint
 
04:07:23.689 --> 04:07:23.699 align:start position:0%
responsibility equally accountable to
 
04:07:26.210 --> 04:07:26.220 align:start position:0%
both so that's why the change in the
 
04:07:28.729 --> 04:07:28.739 align:start position:0%
permit fees and the language with the
 
04:07:30.110 --> 04:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
pharmacist in charge that we actually
 
04:07:32.150 --> 04:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
have the pharmacist in charge and the
 
04:07:37.309 --> 04:07:37.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:40.809 --> 04:07:40.819 align:start position:0%
the last one is the inspections
 
04:07:43.490 --> 04:07:43.500 align:start position:0%
after we talked about that last year and
 
04:07:47.750 --> 04:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
again in house bill it was 1655 a 35
 
04:07:50.090 --> 04:07:50.100 align:start position:0%
the committee agreed that this was
 
04:07:51.349 --> 04:07:51.359 align:start position:0%
something to talk about for future
 
04:07:51.359 --> 04:07:52.729 align:start position:0%
something to talk about for future
legislation

04:07:52.729 --> 04:07:52.739 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:07:55.849 --> 04:07:55.859 align:start position:0%
what I am recommending to the
 
04:07:55.859 --> 04:07:57.229 align:start position:0%
what I am recommending to the
committee

04:07:57.229 --> 04:07:57.239 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:07:59.570 --> 04:07:59.580 align:start position:0%
based upon experience on the board
 
04:08:01.189 --> 04:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
that we still allow the Board of
 
04:08:03.650 --> 04:08:03.660 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy who has the expertise to write
 
04:08:05.870 --> 04:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
the rules and regulations on how drugs
 
04:08:08.450 --> 04:08:08.460 align:start position:0%
are stored how they're handled how
 
04:08:10.550 --> 04:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
they're disposed of and so forth that's
 
04:08:12.469 --> 04:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
their expertise
 
04:08:16.969 --> 04:08:16.979 align:start position:0%
they go into a none Pharmacy provider's
 
04:08:18.650 --> 04:08:18.660 align:start position:0%
office a dental Veterinary whatever it
 
04:08:19.849 --> 04:08:19.859 align:start position:0%
may be
 
04:08:22.429 --> 04:08:22.439 align:start position:0%
the differences here if they find in a
 
04:08:22.439 --> 04:08:23.269 align:start position:0%
the differences here if they find in a
fraction

04:08:23.269 --> 04:08:23.279 align:start position:0%
fraction
 
04:08:26.030 --> 04:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
the board does not act on that
 
04:08:28.670 --> 04:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
infraction the board then takes the
 
04:08:30.710 --> 04:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
investigation or the
 
04:08:33.410 --> 04:08:33.420 align:start position:0%
results of the
 
04:08:35.689 --> 04:08:35.699 align:start position:0%
inspection sends it over to the
 
04:08:38.330 --> 04:08:38.340 align:start position:0%
appropriate licensing board they are the
 
04:08:40.490 --> 04:08:40.500 align:start position:0%
ones responsible if they want to
 
04:08:40.500 --> 04:08:41.809 align:start position:0%
ones responsible if they want to
to

04:08:41.809 --> 04:08:41.819 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:08:43.910 --> 04:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
entertain how they want to impose any
 
04:08:45.889 --> 04:08:45.899 align:start position:0%
discipline onto their licensing the
 
04:08:47.330 --> 04:08:47.340 align:start position:0%
Board of Pharmacy has no jurisdiction
 
04:08:50.090 --> 04:08:50.100 align:start position:0%
over that licensee it strictly goes back
 
04:08:51.650 --> 04:08:51.660 align:start position:0%
to the licensing board for them to
 
04:08:53.689 --> 04:08:53.699 align:start position:0%
review and then determine what they want
 
04:08:55.130 --> 04:08:55.140 align:start position:0%
to do with the information all the board
 
04:08:57.410 --> 04:08:57.420 align:start position:0%
is doing is doing the inspections on
 
04:08:59.689 --> 04:08:59.699 align:start position:0%
their behalf and then providing the
 
04:09:01.849 --> 04:09:01.859 align:start position:0%
documentation back to the respective
 
04:09:04.010 --> 04:09:04.020 align:start position:0%
licensing board for them to look at and
 
04:09:05.570 --> 04:09:05.580 align:start position:0%
review and act on not the Board of
 
04:09:05.580 --> 04:09:06.410 align:start position:0%
review and act on not the Board of
Pharmacy

04:09:06.410 --> 04:09:06.420 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy
 
04:09:08.030 --> 04:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
so those are the five things I'm
 
04:09:10.370 --> 04:09:10.380 align:start position:0%
proposing to this committee on house
 
04:09:12.229 --> 04:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
bill 444
 
04:09:16.070 --> 04:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:18.530 --> 04:09:18.540 align:start position:0%
do you have a question Madam chair yes I
 
04:09:21.769 --> 04:09:21.779 align:start position:0%
see representative Schmidt
 
04:09:24.170 --> 04:09:24.180 align:start position:0%
thank you uh excuse me I don't have my
 
04:09:25.610 --> 04:09:25.620 align:start position:0%
camera on it right at the moment Gary
 
04:09:29.150 --> 04:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
but uh I'm looking at the text of the
 
04:09:38.330 --> 04:09:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:41.990 --> 04:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
okay you got it I have it okay do you
 
04:09:43.910 --> 04:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
see that it doesn't it doesn't seem to
 
04:09:45.309 --> 04:09:45.319 align:start position:0%
work in English
 
04:09:48.070 --> 04:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
line three ends with the word specific
 
04:09:52.130 --> 04:09:52.140 align:start position:0%
then you pick up uh agreement between a
 
04:09:56.389 --> 04:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
pharmacist and then says and
 
04:10:00.130 --> 04:10:00.140 align:start position:0%
close parentheses and and
 
04:10:02.590 --> 04:10:02.600 align:start position:0%
that doesn't work in English
 
04:10:05.750 --> 04:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
I think representative Smith I would say
 
04:10:07.490 --> 04:10:07.500 align:start position:0%
I'm going to send you down to OLS to
 
04:10:09.530 --> 04:10:09.540 align:start position:0%
help them out
 
04:10:11.870 --> 04:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
well you're the one that needs to have
 
04:10:14.450 --> 04:10:14.460 align:start position:0%
the language say what you wanted to say
 
04:10:18.110 --> 04:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
I hear you thank you okay so uh that
 
04:10:20.330 --> 04:10:20.340 align:start position:0%
that that's just part of it
 
04:10:20.340 --> 04:10:21.889 align:start position:0%
that that's just part of it
um

04:10:21.889 --> 04:10:21.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:25.729 --> 04:10:25.739 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh so you
 
04:10:25.739 --> 04:10:26.990 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh so you
um

04:10:26.990 --> 04:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:29.990 --> 04:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the words at some point
 
04:10:32.210 --> 04:10:32.220 align:start position:0%
I'm not finding it right at the moment
 
04:10:37.969 --> 04:10:37.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:42.170 --> 04:10:42.180 align:start position:0%
well in the language last year I
 
04:10:44.769 --> 04:10:44.779 align:start position:0%
proposed to have a May and leave the
 
04:10:46.610 --> 04:10:46.620 align:start position:0%
inspections if you will going to the
 
04:10:48.769 --> 04:10:48.779 align:start position:0%
Board of Pharmacy and I'm proposing that
 
04:10:50.809 --> 04:10:50.819 align:start position:0%
the board still has the authority to go
 
04:10:53.210 --> 04:10:53.220 align:start position:0%
in which is the shell but if they find
 
04:10:55.429 --> 04:10:55.439 align:start position:0%
anything with the inspection it goes
 
04:10:56.929 --> 04:10:56.939 align:start position:0%
over to the respective licensing board
 
04:10:58.550 --> 04:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
that's the change
 
04:11:01.969 --> 04:11:01.979 align:start position:0%
I don't know why well I saw it earlier
 
04:11:04.910 --> 04:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
when I when I read the bill
 
04:11:09.349 --> 04:11:09.359 align:start position:0%
um but it said shall be subject to you
 
04:11:11.750 --> 04:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
um and and that shell was struck and was
 
04:11:14.150 --> 04:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
may be subject to I'm not finding it in
 
04:11:16.610 --> 04:11:16.620 align:start position:0%
the in the bill text at the moment I am
 
04:11:19.689 --> 04:11:19.699 align:start position:0%
looking at hb4 444
 
04:11:22.670 --> 04:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
and somehow I'm not finding it but in
 
04:11:26.510 --> 04:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
any case uh maybe subject to shall be
 
04:11:29.570 --> 04:11:29.580 align:start position:0%
subject to seems to me then that there's
 
04:11:32.150 --> 04:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
no real difference between maybe subject
 
04:11:35.510 --> 04:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
to and shall be subject to frankly but
 
04:11:35.520 --> 04:11:37.070 align:start position:0%
to and shall be subject to frankly but
um

04:11:37.070 --> 04:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:39.889 --> 04:11:39.899 align:start position:0%
so think about that I'm not sure that I
 
04:11:41.889 --> 04:11:41.899 align:start position:0%
want to strike shell
 
04:11:45.769 --> 04:11:45.779 align:start position:0%
and substitute May for in when in the
 
04:11:48.830 --> 04:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
phrase shall be subject to or may be
 
04:11:51.290 --> 04:11:51.300 align:start position:0%
subject to and I want to think about
 
04:11:54.469 --> 04:11:54.479 align:start position:0%
that further or Bounce It Off Of You
 
04:11:57.590 --> 04:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
um but then my my second second question
 
04:12:00.590 --> 04:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
is with regard to uh whether you have
 
04:12:03.530 --> 04:12:03.540 align:start position:0%
any opposition to your proposed language
 
04:12:07.849 --> 04:12:07.859 align:start position:0%
from the board or anyone else the the
 
04:12:09.710 --> 04:12:09.720 align:start position:0%
board of pharmacies in full support of
 
04:12:09.720 --> 04:12:10.729 align:start position:0%
board of pharmacies in full support of
it

04:12:10.729 --> 04:12:10.739 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:12:14.330 --> 04:12:14.340 align:start position:0%
um I did run this by them uh to ensure
 
04:12:16.490 --> 04:12:16.500 align:start position:0%
that I wasn't running afoul of the
 
04:12:18.889 --> 04:12:18.899 align:start position:0%
intent of the board or the desire of the
 
04:12:21.590 --> 04:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
board so the board did vote on this bill
 
04:12:23.210 --> 04:12:23.220 align:start position:0%
and did approve it
 
04:12:25.250 --> 04:12:25.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:12:25.260 --> 04:12:29.510 align:start position:0%
thank you
fellows

04:12:29.510 --> 04:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:31.490 --> 04:12:31.500 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:12:35.269 --> 04:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
um representative Merchant I maybe I
 
04:12:37.370 --> 04:12:37.380 align:start position:0%
heard incorrectly I thought when you
 
04:12:40.910 --> 04:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
were talking about the labeling that you
 
04:12:45.469 --> 04:12:45.479 align:start position:0%
said you wanted to have the initials of
 
04:12:47.750 --> 04:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
the person who checked the prescription
 
04:12:49.189 --> 04:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
on the label
 
04:12:51.889 --> 04:12:51.899 align:start position:0%
is that what you said
 
04:12:54.170 --> 04:12:54.180 align:start position:0%
it wasn't my intent if I said it
 
04:12:56.870 --> 04:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
um what I was trying to communicate was
 
04:12:59.030 --> 04:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
that the person who reviews the
 
04:13:00.769 --> 04:13:00.779 align:start position:0%
prescription when it comes in
 
04:13:02.809 --> 04:13:02.819 align:start position:0%
it makes the determination to have the
 
04:13:05.170 --> 04:13:05.180 align:start position:0%
prescription filled
 
04:13:08.570 --> 04:13:08.580 align:start position:0%
you want their initials on it yes ma'am
 
04:13:11.030 --> 04:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
yes representative fellows what I I
 
04:13:13.309 --> 04:13:13.319 align:start position:0%
don't see where it says that can you
 
04:13:15.290 --> 04:13:15.300 align:start position:0%
point that out
 
04:13:20.590 --> 04:13:20.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:24.710 --> 04:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
actually it doesn't you know
 
04:13:28.189 --> 04:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
so also I can't find that may and shell
 
04:13:30.950 --> 04:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:33.530 --> 04:13:33.540 align:start position:0%
yes for the question about the
 
04:13:35.870 --> 04:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
prescription label is online
 
04:13:39.950 --> 04:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
starting on line 13 on page two and it
 
04:13:42.769 --> 04:13:42.779 align:start position:0%
doesn't require the name or name or
 
04:13:47.450 --> 04:13:47.460 align:start position:0%
initials of any pharmacist as amended so
 
04:13:49.370 --> 04:13:49.380 align:start position:0%
represent the merchant if you if that's
 
04:13:51.889 --> 04:13:51.899 align:start position:0%
what you intend would you uh please
 
04:13:53.450 --> 04:13:53.460 align:start position:0%
review the language and make sure it
 
04:13:56.150 --> 04:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
says that I will definitely thank you
 
04:13:57.590 --> 04:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
for picking that up Fitness uh
 
04:14:00.769 --> 04:14:00.779 align:start position:0%
representative fellows um I definitely
 
04:14:02.330 --> 04:14:02.340 align:start position:0%
see that that was left out of the bill
 
04:14:04.189 --> 04:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
so my apologies to the committee for
 
04:14:05.929 --> 04:14:05.939 align:start position:0%
leaving it out I will definitely go back
 
04:14:08.630 --> 04:14:08.640 align:start position:0%
to OLS and get an amendment or I I can't
 
04:14:10.670 --> 04:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
but the committee I can work with
 
04:14:12.050 --> 04:14:12.060 align:start position:0%
somebody on the committee if you'd like
 
04:14:14.450 --> 04:14:14.460 align:start position:0%
I don't know who that would be to on
 
04:14:16.370 --> 04:14:16.380 align:start position:0%
Amendment or I can make an amendment and
 
04:14:18.290 --> 04:14:18.300 align:start position:0%
have it sent to somebody on the
 
04:14:19.610 --> 04:14:19.620 align:start position:0%
committee because it's now the
 
04:14:22.309 --> 04:14:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:25.010 --> 04:14:25.020 align:start position:0%
what thank you representative fellows um
 
04:14:28.189 --> 04:14:28.199 align:start position:0%
fellows uh you can find the May if it's
 
04:14:29.450 --> 04:14:29.460 align:start position:0%
there I don't see it either
 
04:14:29.460 --> 04:14:37.550 align:start position:0%
there I don't see it either
representative

04:14:37.550 --> 04:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:40.250 --> 04:14:40.260 align:start position:0%
you have any comment about changing the
 
04:14:41.990 --> 04:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
attendant physician
 
04:14:44.450 --> 04:14:44.460 align:start position:0%
to practitioner
 
04:14:47.090 --> 04:14:47.100 align:start position:0%
the attending physician I'm interpreting
 
04:14:49.250 --> 04:14:49.260 align:start position:0%
to be the primary care physician is that
 
04:14:51.830 --> 04:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
correct that's where the ambiguity lies
 
04:14:53.630 --> 04:14:53.640 align:start position:0%
because the way it's written if you look
 
04:14:56.330 --> 04:14:56.340 align:start position:0%
at the definitions in RSA 318
 
04:14:57.769 --> 04:14:57.779 align:start position:0%
it says the one with primary
 
04:15:00.530 --> 04:15:00.540 align:start position:0%
responsibility for
 
04:15:04.429 --> 04:15:04.439 align:start position:0%
um the therapy so it's kind of I guess
 
04:15:05.450 --> 04:15:05.460 align:start position:0%
the actual language for you
 
04:15:08.389 --> 04:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
representative Brody it does open up a
 
04:15:10.790 --> 04:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
level of ambiguity and that's been a
 
04:15:12.349 --> 04:15:12.359 align:start position:0%
concern both by the Board of Pharmacy
 
04:15:14.150 --> 04:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
and by
 
04:15:15.769 --> 04:15:15.779 align:start position:0%
um providers and pharmacists trying to
 
04:15:17.150 --> 04:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
understand who can actually get into an
 
04:15:20.269 --> 04:15:20.279 align:start position:0%
agreement if you will So to avoid the
 
04:15:22.429 --> 04:15:22.439 align:start position:0%
ambiguity my recommendation is to strike
 
04:15:24.830 --> 04:15:24.840 align:start position:0%
the word attending which applies Primary
 
04:15:24.840 --> 04:15:26.450 align:start position:0%
the word attending which applies Primary
Care

04:15:26.450 --> 04:15:26.460 align:start position:0%
Care
 
04:15:28.189 --> 04:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
um versus looking at the person who's
 
04:15:30.170 --> 04:15:30.180 align:start position:0%
responsible for the disease management
 
04:15:33.710 --> 04:15:33.720 align:start position:0%
whether it be diabetes and Cardiology
 
04:15:40.130 --> 04:15:40.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:41.929 --> 04:15:41.939 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm going to be allowed a
 
04:15:44.150 --> 04:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
follow-up question so
 
04:15:48.170 --> 04:15:48.180 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm my concern is it where is it
 
04:15:49.670 --> 04:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
addressed that
 
04:15:52.130 --> 04:15:52.140 align:start position:0%
subscription prescriptions by a
 
04:15:52.140 --> 04:15:53.630 align:start position:0%
subscription prescriptions by a
specialist

04:15:53.630 --> 04:15:53.640 align:start position:0%
specialist
 
04:15:56.630 --> 04:15:56.640 align:start position:0%
are um tied into
 
04:15:59.870 --> 04:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
the primary cares record for that
 
04:15:59.880 --> 04:16:02.030 align:start position:0%
the primary cares record for that
patient

04:16:02.030 --> 04:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
patient
 
04:16:04.610 --> 04:16:04.620 align:start position:0%
so let's say cardiologist recommends a
 
04:16:08.050 --> 04:16:08.060 align:start position:0%
medication and a primary care physician
 
04:16:10.189 --> 04:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
recognizes that this might be a problem
 
04:16:12.170 --> 04:16:12.180 align:start position:0%
for that person based on another
 
04:16:14.689 --> 04:16:14.699 align:start position:0%
specialist that he's going to or they're
 
04:16:16.610 --> 04:16:16.620 align:start position:0%
going to how does that work with all
 
04:16:18.830 --> 04:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
this or is this not or is this not the
 
04:16:20.870 --> 04:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
place to address that I believe
 
04:16:23.809 --> 04:16:23.819 align:start position:0%
represent it is not actually the role of
 
04:16:27.769 --> 04:16:27.779 align:start position:0%
a pharmacist it's accepted the the
 
04:16:29.809 --> 04:16:29.819 align:start position:0%
pharmacist is trained to look for
 
04:16:29.819 --> 04:16:31.450 align:start position:0%
pharmacist is trained to look for
interactions

04:16:31.450 --> 04:16:31.460 align:start position:0%
interactions
 
04:16:33.950 --> 04:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
but the ACT
 
04:16:36.710 --> 04:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
but the actual transfer of information
 
04:16:38.990 --> 04:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
between Specialists and primary care
 
04:16:41.689 --> 04:16:41.699 align:start position:0%
physicians is the responsibility of the
 
04:16:41.699 --> 04:16:43.729 align:start position:0%
physicians is the responsibility of the
doctors

04:16:43.729 --> 04:16:43.739 align:start position:0%
doctors
 
04:16:46.250 --> 04:16:46.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:16:48.229 --> 04:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
representative lacas
 
04:16:52.429 --> 04:16:52.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:55.729 --> 04:16:55.739 align:start position:0%
I have a question about the differences
 
04:16:58.070 --> 04:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
in the standards uh
 
04:17:04.370 --> 04:17:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:06.830 --> 04:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
tendency that uh
 
04:17:09.830 --> 04:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
USP standards are too strict not strict
 
04:17:11.750 --> 04:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
enough for just wrong I was curious
 
04:17:14.330 --> 04:17:14.340 align:start position:0%
about that maybe an example of one
 
04:17:17.990 --> 04:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
to help well I think the one is
 
04:17:20.510 --> 04:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
representative which one Speaking please
 
04:17:20.520 --> 04:17:22.910 align:start position:0%
representative which one Speaking please
Marcus

04:17:22.910 --> 04:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
Marcus
 
04:17:25.130 --> 04:17:25.140 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
04:17:26.750 --> 04:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
I'll give you an example back to the
 
04:17:28.490 --> 04:17:28.500 align:start position:0%
compounding issue that we talked about
 
04:17:32.030 --> 04:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
before where the board
 
04:17:34.370 --> 04:17:34.380 align:start position:0%
um went in to do inspections and had to
 
04:17:34.380 --> 04:17:35.809 align:start position:0%
um went in to do inspections and had to
utilize

04:17:35.809 --> 04:17:35.819 align:start position:0%
utilize
 
04:17:39.170 --> 04:17:39.180 align:start position:0%
the USB standards there are times which
 
04:17:41.809 --> 04:17:41.819 align:start position:0%
we go into a provider's office and many
 
04:17:44.150 --> 04:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
times the inspector does more education
 
04:17:46.370 --> 04:17:46.380 align:start position:0%
than inspecting
 
04:17:48.590 --> 04:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
um so it's one of those things where
 
04:17:50.450 --> 04:17:50.460 align:start position:0%
we're trying to thread the needle
 
04:17:50.460 --> 04:17:51.830 align:start position:0%
we're trying to thread the needle
between

04:17:51.830 --> 04:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
between
 
04:17:53.870 --> 04:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
having regulations on how we store
 
04:17:56.150 --> 04:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
things and be consistent about that
 
04:17:57.530 --> 04:17:57.540 align:start position:0%
throughout the state
 
04:17:59.450 --> 04:17:59.460 align:start position:0%
and then to inspect against those
 
04:18:02.990 --> 04:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
standards but when you find
 
04:18:05.630 --> 04:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
in a fraction or find something that
 
04:18:07.330 --> 04:18:07.340 align:start position:0%
doesn't meet the standards The Falls
 
04:18:10.250 --> 04:18:10.260 align:start position:0%
below the standard that that is then
 
04:18:12.410 --> 04:18:12.420 align:start position:0%
report to licensing board an example
 
04:18:14.090 --> 04:18:14.100 align:start position:0%
could be
 
04:18:15.170 --> 04:18:15.180 align:start position:0%
um this is back to the federal
 
04:18:17.689 --> 04:18:17.699 align:start position:0%
government if you have controlled drugs
 
04:18:20.570 --> 04:18:20.580 align:start position:0%
every two years you're supposed to do an
 
04:18:23.929 --> 04:18:23.939 align:start position:0%
inventory on May 1st was we changed now
 
04:18:25.910 --> 04:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
to do it once a year but the federal
 
04:18:27.950 --> 04:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
government requires that each
 
04:18:27.960 --> 04:18:29.389 align:start position:0%
government requires that each
practitioner

04:18:29.389 --> 04:18:29.399 align:start position:0%
practitioner
 
04:18:31.729 --> 04:18:31.739 align:start position:0%
do account
 
04:18:34.610 --> 04:18:34.620 align:start position:0%
so in that case when we go into the
 
04:18:37.250 --> 04:18:37.260 align:start position:0%
provider's office and try to help them
 
04:18:39.410 --> 04:18:39.420 align:start position:0%
we find out that the inventory has not
 
04:18:42.950 --> 04:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
been done according to federal law
 
04:18:44.809 --> 04:18:44.819 align:start position:0%
what we did in the past was the board
 
04:18:46.729 --> 04:18:46.739 align:start position:0%
would issue a fine
 
04:18:48.830 --> 04:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is say okay when the
 
04:18:50.510 --> 04:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
board finds that
 
04:18:52.670 --> 04:18:52.680 align:start position:0%
that line is not levied by the board
 
04:18:54.590 --> 04:18:54.600 align:start position:0%
that information goes back to the Board
 
04:18:55.849 --> 04:18:55.859 align:start position:0%
of Medicine the board of dentistry
 
04:18:58.130 --> 04:18:58.140 align:start position:0%
whatever it may be and for them to make
 
04:18:59.750 --> 04:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
the determination if there should be a
 
04:19:04.630 --> 04:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:10.130 --> 04:19:10.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:11.990 --> 04:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Bob
 
04:19:14.750 --> 04:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
Madam chair I'd like to thank uh first
 
04:19:16.910 --> 04:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
representative fellows I did have that
 
04:19:19.729 --> 04:19:19.739 align:start position:0%
same question with the labeling but uh
 
04:19:21.530 --> 04:19:21.540 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
04:19:23.330 --> 04:19:23.340 align:start position:0%
question on
 
04:19:27.830 --> 04:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
um lines four and five on page one uh
 
04:19:30.050 --> 04:19:30.060 align:start position:0%
you seem to have struck out the patient
 
04:19:32.950 --> 04:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
a patient's authorized representative
 
04:19:36.170 --> 04:19:36.180 align:start position:0%
uh does that include somebody that has a
 
04:19:38.750 --> 04:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
medical proxy like in the case of an
 
04:19:42.050 --> 04:19:42.060 align:start position:0%
elderly patient or somebody that is uh
 
04:19:46.010 --> 04:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
mentally a physically incapacitated uh
 
04:19:50.210 --> 04:19:50.220 align:start position:0%
that person who has that proxy cannot uh
 
04:19:53.210 --> 04:19:53.220 align:start position:0%
you know interject on the patient's
 
04:19:53.220 --> 04:19:54.769 align:start position:0%
you know interject on the patient's
behalf

04:19:54.769 --> 04:19:54.779 align:start position:0%
behalf
 
04:19:55.790 --> 04:19:55.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:19:58.370 --> 04:19:58.380 align:start position:0%
representative Ryan uh no it's actually
 
04:20:00.710 --> 04:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
the other way instead of requiring
 
04:20:02.870 --> 04:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
either the patient or the patient's
 
04:20:06.710 --> 04:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
authorized caregiver to sign the form
 
04:20:09.410 --> 04:20:09.420 align:start position:0%
which is difficult with Telehealth they
 
04:20:12.050 --> 04:20:12.060 align:start position:0%
can give their verbal consent
 
04:20:13.309 --> 04:20:13.319 align:start position:0%
and not have to think you've been a
 
04:20:14.389 --> 04:20:14.399 align:start position:0%
written consent
 
04:20:14.399 --> 04:20:15.710 align:start position:0%
written consent
okay

04:20:15.710 --> 04:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:20:15.720 --> 04:20:17.990 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

04:20:17.990 --> 04:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:20:19.910 --> 04:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
are there other questions for
 
04:20:22.550 --> 04:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant
 
04:20:27.290 --> 04:20:27.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:29.870 --> 04:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and uh it's I know
 
04:20:32.030 --> 04:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
you necessarily see me but it is good to
 
04:20:35.150 --> 04:20:35.160 align:start position:0%
see you uh my old friend
 
04:20:39.530 --> 04:20:39.540 align:start position:0%
uh I have a question in reference to you
 
04:20:41.290 --> 04:20:41.300 align:start position:0%
said when you were talking about
 
04:20:44.150 --> 04:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
National standards
 
04:20:47.750 --> 04:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
and using a state standard
 
04:20:49.729 --> 04:20:49.739 align:start position:0%
maybe I'm a little confused I thought
 
04:20:51.110 --> 04:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
you said that there was there would be
 
04:20:52.309 --> 04:20:52.319 align:start position:0%
circumstances where the National
 
04:20:54.590 --> 04:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
Standard would not be followed
 
04:20:58.309 --> 04:20:58.319 align:start position:0%
but the state standard would
 
04:21:01.490 --> 04:21:01.500 align:start position:0%
did I hear you right or am I confused
 
04:21:01.500 --> 04:21:02.510 align:start position:0%
did I hear you right or am I confused
um

04:21:02.510 --> 04:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:04.490 --> 04:21:04.500 align:start position:0%
obviously I didn't say it
 
04:21:06.769 --> 04:21:06.779 align:start position:0%
clearly so thank you representative
 
04:21:08.990 --> 04:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
Pearson it's good to see you as well
 
04:21:10.790 --> 04:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
um although I good to hear you I guess I
 
04:21:12.469 --> 04:21:12.479 align:start position:0%
can't see you
 
04:21:15.469 --> 04:21:15.479 align:start position:0%
um in saying that what I'm trying to do
 
04:21:17.929 --> 04:21:17.939 align:start position:0%
with the change is to allow the Board of
 
04:21:20.570 --> 04:21:20.580 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy the some flexibility where they
 
04:21:22.790 --> 04:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
can use the federal standards
 
04:21:24.830 --> 04:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
when it makes sense and it doesn't have
 
04:21:27.830 --> 04:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
a conflict with State Standards
 
04:21:30.530 --> 04:21:30.540 align:start position:0%
um to allow the board to set State
 
04:21:32.510 --> 04:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
Standards based upon Federal standards
 
04:21:34.070 --> 04:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
but not require them to follow them
 
04:21:36.769 --> 04:21:36.779 align:start position:0%
blindly the issue that we ran into was
 
04:21:39.110 --> 04:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
that the FDA standard which is also a
 
04:21:41.150 --> 04:21:41.160 align:start position:0%
federal standard the board could not
 
04:21:43.729 --> 04:21:43.739 align:start position:0%
utilize in the word the definition of
 
04:21:46.250 --> 04:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
compounding because it's not part of the
 
04:21:48.650 --> 04:21:48.660 align:start position:0%
USB standard so we had two federal
 
04:21:50.990 --> 04:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
agencies with different standards that
 
04:21:52.370 --> 04:21:52.380 align:start position:0%
conflicted with each other
 
04:21:54.229 --> 04:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
and it created a problem for the board
 
04:21:56.090 --> 04:21:56.100 align:start position:0%
because the board was bound to follow
 
04:21:58.550 --> 04:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
the USP standards for the law and could
 
04:22:01.429 --> 04:22:01.439 align:start position:0%
not entertain the FDA Federal standards
 
04:22:03.530 --> 04:22:03.540 align:start position:0%
that would also have eliminated a
 
04:22:03.540 --> 04:22:08.570 align:start position:0%
that would also have eliminated a
problem

04:22:08.570 --> 04:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:10.130 --> 04:22:10.140 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:22:14.269 --> 04:22:14.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:17.090 --> 04:22:17.100 align:start position:0%
okay my experience as you as you know
 
04:22:19.130 --> 04:22:19.140 align:start position:0%
another world we'll see in the fire code
 
04:22:21.950 --> 04:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
where we don't necessarily we have state
 
04:22:23.570 --> 04:22:23.580 align:start position:0%
adopted National statements and there
 
04:22:27.110 --> 04:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
was no over why National statement so
 
04:22:30.469 --> 04:22:30.479 align:start position:0%
it so just keep that in mind as this is
 
04:22:32.990 --> 04:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
my frame of reference so here the state
 
04:22:35.870 --> 04:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
standard that you're talking about has
 
04:22:38.689 --> 04:22:38.699 align:start position:0%
to be an equivalency or greater than the
 
04:22:42.410 --> 04:22:42.420 align:start position:0%
National Standard it cannot be less
 
04:22:45.170 --> 04:22:45.180 align:start position:0%
or reduced from what what a National
 
04:22:50.570 --> 04:22:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:53.570 --> 04:22:53.580 align:start position:0%
however when we impose
 
04:22:56.030 --> 04:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
on a board or anyone else in our state a
 
04:22:57.590 --> 04:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
National Standard the state has no
 
04:23:00.830 --> 04:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
control over or any influence over
 
04:23:03.650 --> 04:23:03.660 align:start position:0%
then we don't have any flexibility
 
04:23:05.269 --> 04:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
within the state
 
04:23:07.610 --> 04:23:07.620 align:start position:0%
to make a determination that that
 
04:23:10.250 --> 04:23:10.260 align:start position:0%
particular standard doesn't fit the
 
04:23:11.809 --> 04:23:11.819 align:start position:0%
needs of our citizens here in New
 
04:23:11.819 --> 04:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
needs of our citizens here in New
Hampshire

04:23:14.960 --> 04:23:14.970 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:14.970 --> 04:23:19.030 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:23:19.030 --> 04:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:21.650 --> 04:23:21.660 align:start position:0%
and you're aware that it's a glowing
 
04:23:22.910 --> 04:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
example the state of New Hampshire
 
04:23:26.389 --> 04:23:26.399 align:start position:0%
adopts a fire code to which we carve out
 
04:23:28.490 --> 04:23:28.500 align:start position:0%
certain things that the state of New
 
04:23:30.110 --> 04:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire deems potentially problematic
 
04:23:31.790 --> 04:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason
 
04:23:34.370 --> 04:23:34.380 align:start position:0%
why would the pharmacy board not operate
 
04:23:36.050 --> 04:23:36.060 align:start position:0%
in a similar manner where you would
 
04:23:38.809 --> 04:23:38.819 align:start position:0%
adopt say the USP standards
 
04:23:41.809 --> 04:23:41.819 align:start position:0%
with the exception of X Y and Z to fit
 
04:23:45.229 --> 04:23:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:46.729 --> 04:23:46.739 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question
 
04:23:50.689 --> 04:23:50.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:53.090 --> 04:23:53.100 align:start position:0%
I think we start carving we could carve
 
04:23:55.790 --> 04:23:55.800 align:start position:0%
things out of the USB standards
 
04:23:57.290 --> 04:23:57.300 align:start position:0%
um so we can say these are exceptions
 
04:23:59.510 --> 04:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
that the board doesn't have to follow or
 
04:24:02.030 --> 04:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
has to take and determine whether they
 
04:24:03.229 --> 04:24:03.239 align:start position:0%
should apply or not I mean that's
 
04:24:05.389 --> 04:24:05.399 align:start position:0%
another approach to it
 
04:24:07.550 --> 04:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
um what I'm suggesting is that instead
 
04:24:08.809 --> 04:24:08.819 align:start position:0%
of trying to get into a list of all the
 
04:24:10.670 --> 04:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
things that the board thinks is
 
04:24:13.969 --> 04:24:13.979 align:start position:0%
problematic I would suggest that we say
 
04:24:16.610 --> 04:24:16.620 align:start position:0%
the board can adopt the standards based
 
04:24:18.410 --> 04:24:18.420 align:start position:0%
upon the needs of the board and what the
 
04:24:20.750 --> 04:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
citizens of the state need the challenge
 
04:24:22.309 --> 04:24:22.319 align:start position:0%
we have here is that at the federal
 
04:24:25.729 --> 04:24:25.739 align:start position:0%
level for instance we had two standards
 
04:24:27.290 --> 04:24:27.300 align:start position:0%
and they were in conflict with each
 
04:24:27.300 --> 04:24:28.130 align:start position:0%
and they were in conflict with each
other

04:24:28.130 --> 04:24:28.140 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:24:30.229 --> 04:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
so if we have
 
04:24:33.110 --> 04:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
an state agency only following one
 
04:24:35.269 --> 04:24:35.279 align:start position:0%
standard it doesn't have the option to
 
04:24:37.429 --> 04:24:37.439 align:start position:0%
look at the other agency at the federal
 
04:24:37.439 --> 04:24:38.389 align:start position:0%
look at the other agency at the federal
level

04:24:38.389 --> 04:24:38.399 align:start position:0%
level
 
04:24:39.950 --> 04:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
and look at their standards because
 
04:24:43.250 --> 04:24:43.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:45.590 --> 04:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
do I understand you correctly to say
 
04:24:45.600 --> 04:24:47.090 align:start position:0%
do I understand you correctly to say
that

04:24:47.090 --> 04:24:47.100 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:24:51.710 --> 04:24:51.720 align:start position:0%
the where oh where does the state adopt
 
04:24:53.389 --> 04:24:53.399 align:start position:0%
the USP
 
04:24:54.769 --> 04:24:54.779 align:start position:0%
who doesn't
 
04:24:58.429 --> 04:24:58.439 align:start position:0%
if you look into the compounding
 
04:25:03.290 --> 04:25:03.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:05.389 --> 04:25:05.399 align:start position:0%
all compounding should be done in
 
04:25:07.010 --> 04:25:07.020 align:start position:0%
compliance with
 
04:25:08.870 --> 04:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
USB standards
 
04:25:13.729 --> 04:25:13.739 align:start position:0%
okay so did the Florida pharmacy at some
 
04:25:17.809 --> 04:25:17.819 align:start position:0%
point actually adopt the USP yes they
 
04:25:19.570 --> 04:25:19.580 align:start position:0%
did and that's what caused the heartburn
 
04:25:22.070 --> 04:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
Madam chair because when we looked at
 
04:25:24.349 --> 04:25:24.359 align:start position:0%
the compounding being done in Physicians
 
04:25:25.969 --> 04:25:25.979 align:start position:0%
offices and things that we're doing with
 
04:25:27.710 --> 04:25:27.720 align:start position:0%
Remicade specifically
 
04:25:29.689 --> 04:25:29.699 align:start position:0%
the way they were compounding it and so
 
04:25:31.370 --> 04:25:31.380 align:start position:0%
do today
 
04:25:34.370 --> 04:25:34.380 align:start position:0%
violates USB standards but not FDA
 
04:25:34.380 --> 04:25:37.070 align:start position:0%
violates USB standards but not FDA
standards

04:25:37.070 --> 04:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:37.080 --> 04:25:38.450 align:start position:0%
 
lovely

04:25:38.450 --> 04:25:38.460 align:start position:0%
lovely
 
04:25:41.510 --> 04:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely lovely so what I'm suggesting
 
04:25:43.790 --> 04:25:43.800 align:start position:0%
to the committee is to allow the board
 
04:25:46.189 --> 04:25:46.199 align:start position:0%
some flexibility that when there are
 
04:25:47.870 --> 04:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
conflicts at the federal level and
 
04:25:50.689 --> 04:25:50.699 align:start position:0%
conflict within standards is that the
 
04:25:52.490 --> 04:25:52.500 align:start position:0%
board has some flexibility about which
 
04:25:54.349 --> 04:25:54.359 align:start position:0%
way to go with the standards not getting
 
04:25:57.649 --> 04:25:57.659 align:start position:0%
in the same situation we had last time
 
04:25:59.929 --> 04:25:59.939 align:start position:0%
I think this needs more work but not
 
04:26:02.030 --> 04:26:02.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily in the context of this bill
 
04:26:05.870 --> 04:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
but this that sounds like a invitation
 
04:26:07.550 --> 04:26:07.560 align:start position:0%
to disaster
 
04:26:10.610 --> 04:26:10.620 align:start position:0%
that we multiple Federal standards that
 
04:26:12.710 --> 04:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
apply that don't necessarily agree with
 
04:26:15.110 --> 04:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:17.630 --> 04:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that's kind of the the intent
 
04:26:18.830 --> 04:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
of the bill to try to get some
 
04:26:20.990 --> 04:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
flexibility to it and avoid things we've
 
04:26:23.750 --> 04:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
had done or the bridges we've crossed in
 
04:26:26.330 --> 04:26:26.340 align:start position:0%
the past that cause some heartburn
 
04:26:29.210 --> 04:26:29.220 align:start position:0%
hey I I can see that you're dealing with
 
04:26:31.969 --> 04:26:31.979 align:start position:0%
one specific issue but
 
04:26:35.750 --> 04:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
the USP is a fairly substantial code and
 
04:26:38.210 --> 04:26:38.220 align:start position:0%
I and I would imagine there are other
 
04:26:39.769 --> 04:26:39.779 align:start position:0%
cases where it conflicts with other
 
04:26:39.779 --> 04:26:42.969 align:start position:0%
cases where it conflicts with other
other

04:26:42.969 --> 04:26:42.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:46.729 --> 04:26:46.739 align:start position:0%
I don't care yes there are other areas
 
04:26:48.889 --> 04:26:48.899 align:start position:0%
but you're right it's not a time for
 
04:26:56.950 --> 04:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:56.960 --> 04:26:58.490 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:26:58.490 --> 04:26:58.500 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:27:00.469 --> 04:27:00.479 align:start position:0%
um Merchant did we not address this
 
04:27:03.349 --> 04:27:03.359 align:start position:0%
compounding issue last year
 
04:27:05.450 --> 04:27:05.460 align:start position:0%
I mean I I seem to remember a bill about
 
04:27:08.269 --> 04:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
compounding in the pharmaceutical board
 
04:27:11.929 --> 04:27:11.939 align:start position:0%
I thought we we had already and the USP
 
04:27:14.510 --> 04:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
in the conflict I thought we'd already
 
04:27:18.050 --> 04:27:18.060 align:start position:0%
fix that representative that bill was
 
04:27:22.370 --> 04:27:22.380 align:start position:0%
retained and therefore couldn't uh it
 
04:27:24.229 --> 04:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
was held for interim study because of
 
04:27:27.710 --> 04:27:27.720 align:start position:0%
issues not necessarily this one
 
04:27:31.429 --> 04:27:31.439 align:start position:0%
okay follow-up then is this do these did
 
04:27:33.590 --> 04:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
this does this bill run tandem to the
 
04:27:36.710 --> 04:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
other one is it is it in conflict or is
 
04:27:39.170 --> 04:27:39.180 align:start position:0%
it a advanced version of the other one
 
04:27:43.250 --> 04:27:43.260 align:start position:0%
yes Advanced version
 
04:27:46.969 --> 04:27:46.979 align:start position:0%
okay thank you all right representative
 
04:27:49.130 --> 04:27:49.140 align:start position:0%
Schmidt you have another question I do
 
04:27:52.870 --> 04:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:56.990 --> 04:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh so I see that there is a uh
 
04:28:01.610 --> 04:28:01.620 align:start position:0%
submission by uh Dr Conway I believe is
 
04:28:04.929 --> 04:28:04.939 align:start position:0%
he listed to speak to us
 
04:28:09.110 --> 04:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh yes people speak to us but he can't
 
04:28:11.929 --> 04:28:11.939 align:start position:0%
today he has a conflict
 
04:28:14.870 --> 04:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh he did I hear you say he's not going
 
04:28:17.750 --> 04:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
to speak because he has a conflict he
 
04:28:19.849 --> 04:28:19.859 align:start position:0%
has an emergency he was signed up to
 
04:28:21.889 --> 04:28:21.899 align:start position:0%
speak but he will not be able to okay
 
04:28:24.229 --> 04:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
thank you that's I want to make sure I
 
04:28:26.870 --> 04:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
understood you correctly uh so as you
 
04:28:28.729 --> 04:28:28.739 align:start position:0%
may know representative Merchant uh Dr
 
04:28:33.889 --> 04:28:33.899 align:start position:0%
Conway has uh sliled uh a uh thing with
 
04:28:38.330 --> 04:28:38.340 align:start position:0%
the committee in in opposition uh to uh
 
04:28:41.689 --> 04:28:41.699 align:start position:0%
some aspects anyway of your bill are you
 
04:28:45.490 --> 04:28:45.500 align:start position:0%
familiar with his uh with his letter
 
04:28:49.729 --> 04:28:49.739 align:start position:0%
yes I am I think the intent of what he's
 
04:28:51.410 --> 04:28:51.420 align:start position:0%
asking for is for the Board of Pharmacy
 
04:28:53.630 --> 04:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
to not have any authority to go into a
 
04:28:56.630 --> 04:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
provider's office to do inspections
 
04:28:59.389 --> 04:28:59.399 align:start position:0%
um I do have a concern about that
 
04:28:59.399 --> 04:29:00.950 align:start position:0%
um I do have a concern about that
because

04:29:00.950 --> 04:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:29:02.510 --> 04:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
the reason why we started doing
 
04:29:04.250 --> 04:29:04.260 align:start position:0%
inspections in the first place many
 
04:29:06.530 --> 04:29:06.540 align:start position:0%
years ago was because the boards of
 
04:29:08.689 --> 04:29:08.699 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy nursing
 
04:29:11.269 --> 04:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
dental and so forth came to the Board of
 
04:29:13.610 --> 04:29:13.620 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy asking for us to do inspections
 
04:29:16.130 --> 04:29:16.140 align:start position:0%
through an mou so that's kind of the
 
04:29:18.229 --> 04:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
root of all of this is that the
 
04:29:19.849 --> 04:29:19.859 align:start position:0%
respective boards recognized that
 
04:29:21.830 --> 04:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy had the expertise
 
04:29:24.349 --> 04:29:24.359 align:start position:0%
had the inspectors and asked the Board
 
04:29:26.809 --> 04:29:26.819 align:start position:0%
of Pharmacy to do the inspections on
 
04:29:30.349 --> 04:29:30.359 align:start position:0%
their behalf it then evolved into no
 
04:29:32.809 --> 04:29:32.819 align:start position:0%
longer having an mou for many different
 
04:29:35.030 --> 04:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
reasons a lot of dealing with
 
04:29:37.370 --> 04:29:37.380 align:start position:0%
funding mechanisms and that's what got
 
04:29:39.530 --> 04:29:39.540 align:start position:0%
us here today
 
04:29:41.870 --> 04:29:41.880 align:start position:0%
so you know you are you are aware that
 
04:29:44.090 --> 04:29:44.100 align:start position:0%
there you recall of course and know
 
04:29:46.309 --> 04:29:46.319 align:start position:0%
you're aware of it you recall that there
 
04:29:49.189 --> 04:29:49.199 align:start position:0%
was a big flap when uh Pharmacy Board
 
04:29:51.950 --> 04:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
inspectors went into doctors offices and
 
04:29:54.170 --> 04:29:54.180 align:start position:0%
I think kind of like shut them some of
 
04:29:56.990 --> 04:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
them were shut shut down pursuant to the
 
04:30:00.469 --> 04:30:00.479 align:start position:0%
inspectors uh you know reaction to
 
04:30:03.170 --> 04:30:03.180 align:start position:0%
things they found uh there was a major
 
04:30:06.410 --> 04:30:06.420 align:start position:0%
flap between you guys in the in the docs
 
04:30:10.149 --> 04:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
about that uh is this
 
04:30:13.729 --> 04:30:13.739 align:start position:0%
a continuation of that it's trying to
 
04:30:15.550 --> 04:30:15.560 align:start position:0%
resolve that issue
 
04:30:18.649 --> 04:30:18.659 align:start position:0%
so that instead of the Board of Pharmacy
 
04:30:21.349 --> 04:30:21.359 align:start position:0%
having jurisdiction over their providers
 
04:30:23.090 --> 04:30:23.100 align:start position:0%
when they find it in a fraction
 
04:30:24.590 --> 04:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
what they're doing is taking the
 
04:30:26.389 --> 04:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
documentation and turning it over to
 
04:30:28.550 --> 04:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
respective licensing board for them to
 
04:30:29.870 --> 04:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
act on
 
04:30:33.050 --> 04:30:33.060 align:start position:0%
Madam chair are we going to see see
 
04:30:35.450 --> 04:30:35.460 align:start position:0%
somebody hear somebody from the medical
 
04:30:39.530 --> 04:30:39.540 align:start position:0%
side uh in in doctor's place I'm call
 
04:30:41.510 --> 04:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
queued up and ready to speak as soon as
 
04:30:43.750 --> 04:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
you stop asking questions
 
04:30:48.410 --> 04:30:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:48.420 --> 04:30:50.689 align:start position:0%
 
possible

04:30:50.689 --> 04:30:50.699 align:start position:0%
possible
 
04:30:50.699 --> 04:30:53.149 align:start position:0%
possible
yes

04:30:53.149 --> 04:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:31:02.630 --> 04:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:04.910 --> 04:31:04.920 align:start position:0%

administration committee
 
04:31:59.030 --> 04:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
my name is Nancy Wilson and I am
 
04:32:01.370 --> 04:32:01.380 align:start position:0%
speaking for the New Hampshire nurse
 
04:32:04.189 --> 04:32:04.199 align:start position:0%
practitioners Association of which I am
 
04:32:06.530 --> 04:32:06.540 align:start position:0%
a member
 
04:32:08.990 --> 04:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire nurse practitioner
 
04:32:10.670 --> 04:32:10.680 align:start position:0%
Association is the professional
 
04:32:13.849 --> 04:32:13.859 align:start position:0%
association in the state dedicated to
 
04:32:16.189 --> 04:32:16.199 align:start position:0%
serving as the voice for nurse
 
04:32:16.199 --> 04:32:17.630 align:start position:0%
serving as the voice for nurse
practitioners

04:32:17.630 --> 04:32:17.640 align:start position:0%
practitioners
 
04:32:21.050 --> 04:32:21.060 align:start position:0%
we wish to register our opposition
 
04:32:25.429 --> 04:32:25.439 align:start position:0%
to hb44 as introduced
 
04:32:28.189 --> 04:32:28.199 align:start position:0%
the bill appears to be a rewrite of
 
04:32:34.130 --> 04:32:34.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:36.410 --> 04:32:36.420 align:start position:0%
which your committee considered and sent
 
04:32:41.030 --> 04:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
to interim study on a 19-0 vote
 
04:32:43.790 --> 04:32:43.800 align:start position:0%
less than a year ago
 
04:32:46.429 --> 04:32:46.439 align:start position:0%
the committee report to the house
 
04:32:48.710 --> 04:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
said that multiple professions had come
 
04:32:53.269 --> 04:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
out in opposition to hb1536
 
04:32:56.809 --> 04:32:56.819 align:start position:0%
and that interim study was needed quote
 
04:33:00.889 --> 04:33:00.899 align:start position:0%
to clarify definitions and resolve some
 
04:33:03.050 --> 04:33:03.060 align:start position:0%
of the inter-professional disputes
 
04:33:03.060 --> 04:33:05.810 align:start position:0%
of the inter-professional disputes
unquote

04:33:05.810 --> 04:33:05.820 align:start position:0%
unquote
 
04:33:07.449 --> 04:33:07.459 align:start position:0%
but work on
 
04:33:11.150 --> 04:33:11.160 align:start position:0%
hb1536 was curtailed by the pandemic
 
04:33:13.070 --> 04:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
and to our knowledge
 
04:33:15.410 --> 04:33:15.420 align:start position:0%
those outstanding questions have not
 
04:33:18.230 --> 04:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
been answered or resolved
 
04:33:22.310 --> 04:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
our association opposed the 2020 bill
 
04:33:24.949 --> 04:33:24.959 align:start position:0%
the primary issues we identified for
 
04:33:26.570 --> 04:33:26.580 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioners
 
04:33:29.470 --> 04:33:29.480 align:start position:0%
were the definition of quote dispensing
 
04:33:32.631 --> 04:33:32.641 align:start position:0%
unquote as well as the vague language
 
04:33:38.029 --> 04:33:38.039 align:start position:0%
and the disciplinary section of hb1536
 
04:33:42.650 --> 04:33:42.660 align:start position:0%
while HB 444 includes no definition of
 
04:33:45.349 --> 04:33:45.359 align:start position:0%
quote dispensing unquote
 
04:33:47.869 --> 04:33:47.879 align:start position:0%
we have the same problems with its
 
04:33:50.510 --> 04:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
disciplinary section that we did with
 
04:33:50.520 --> 04:33:54.470 align:start position:0%
disciplinary section that we did with
hb1536

04:33:54.470 --> 04:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:56.330 --> 04:33:56.340 align:start position:0%
for these reasons
 
04:34:00.349 --> 04:34:00.359 align:start position:0%
we think the timing of HB 444
 
04:34:02.150 --> 04:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
is premature
 
04:34:05.510 --> 04:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
until a study is completed
 
04:34:07.670 --> 04:34:07.680 align:start position:0%
an alternative for the committee to
 
04:34:09.769 --> 04:34:09.779 align:start position:0%
consider is an amendment being offered
 
04:34:12.349 --> 04:34:12.359 align:start position:0%
by the New Hampshire Medical Society
 
04:34:14.449 --> 04:34:14.459 align:start position:0%
which would address the Bill's attempt
 
04:34:17.209 --> 04:34:17.219 align:start position:0%
to give the Board of Pharmacy too much
 
04:34:19.670 --> 04:34:19.680 align:start position:0%
authority over other practitioners
 
04:34:22.910 --> 04:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
including Advanced registered nurse
 
04:34:22.920 --> 04:34:24.650 align:start position:0%
including Advanced registered nurse
practitioners

04:34:24.650 --> 04:34:24.660 align:start position:0%
practitioners
 
04:34:28.490 --> 04:34:28.500 align:start position:0%
an example is the boards of pharmacies
 
04:34:31.849 --> 04:34:31.859 align:start position:0%
ability to inspect a nurse's quote
 
04:34:34.429 --> 04:34:34.439 align:start position:0%
aseptic technique
 
04:34:38.449 --> 04:34:38.459 align:start position:0%
unquote in non-hospital settings
 
04:34:41.269 --> 04:34:41.279 align:start position:0%
we see this as an overreach of that
 
04:34:41.279 --> 04:34:42.289 align:start position:0%
we see this as an overreach of that
board

04:34:42.289 --> 04:34:42.299 align:start position:0%
board
 
04:34:45.070 --> 04:34:45.080 align:start position:0%
and both duplicative and unnecessary
 
04:34:47.869 --> 04:34:47.879 align:start position:0%
when nurse practitioners are governed by
 
04:34:47.879 --> 04:34:50.289 align:start position:0%
when nurse practitioners are governed by
RSA

04:34:50.289 --> 04:34:50.299 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
04:34:53.750 --> 04:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
326-b and licensed by the Board of

326-b and licensed by the Board of

Nursing
 
04:34:57.890 --> 04:34:57.900 align:start position:0%
we urge the committee to either retain
 
04:35:01.551 --> 04:35:01.561 align:start position:0%
or amend HB 444
 
04:35:06.529 --> 04:35:06.539 align:start position:0%
but not to adopt it as introduced
 
04:35:09.650 --> 04:35:09.660 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my testimony
 
04:35:11.449 --> 04:35:11.459 align:start position:0%
thank you are there questions from the
 
04:35:11.459 --> 04:35:15.250 align:start position:0%
thank you are there questions from the
committee

04:35:15.250 --> 04:35:15.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:20.510 --> 04:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:22.609 --> 04:35:22.619 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and Ms Wilson
 
04:35:24.890 --> 04:35:24.900 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here today
 
04:35:26.890 --> 04:35:26.900 align:start position:0%
as you know
 
04:35:29.631 --> 04:35:29.641 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure anymore whether you were on
 
04:35:32.209 --> 04:35:32.219 align:start position:0%
the in attendance when the subcommittee
 
04:35:35.349 --> 04:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
that I was on worked on this compounding
 
04:35:40.010 --> 04:35:40.020 align:start position:0%
and dispensing issue several years ago I
 
04:35:42.051 --> 04:35:42.061 align:start position:0%
would say about three or four years ago
 
04:35:43.990 --> 04:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
were you part of that
 
04:35:48.769 --> 04:35:48.779 align:start position:0%
gang no it was not okay so so let me
 
04:35:50.929 --> 04:35:50.939 align:start position:0%
turn on my light so you can see me a
 
04:35:53.390 --> 04:35:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:58.010 --> 04:35:58.020 align:start position:0%
um so uh as you know at the time uh
 
04:36:02.750 --> 04:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
there was a a definite need for uh for
 
04:36:05.090 --> 04:36:05.100 align:start position:0%
nurses basically that was how it was
 
04:36:08.029 --> 04:36:08.039 align:start position:0%
being done as I understood it for nurses
 
04:36:10.369 --> 04:36:10.379 align:start position:0%
to travel out to uh to the homes of
 
04:36:14.510 --> 04:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
people who are were because of age or
 
04:36:18.949 --> 04:36:18.959 align:start position:0%
infirmity unable to uh to go into uh one
 
04:36:23.449 --> 04:36:23.459 align:start position:0%
of these uh centers such as there is uh
 
04:36:25.970 --> 04:36:25.980 align:start position:0%
very close to the Portsmouth Regional
 
04:36:29.390 --> 04:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
hospital they have a it was it's called
 
04:36:32.449 --> 04:36:32.459 align:start position:0%
infusions a fusion Center I think okay
 
04:36:34.189 --> 04:36:34.199 align:start position:0%
you familiar with that
 
04:36:34.199 --> 04:36:38.570 align:start position:0%
you familiar with that
yes

04:36:38.570 --> 04:36:38.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:41.269 --> 04:36:41.279 align:start position:0%
that service okay so you know that uh
 
04:36:43.609 --> 04:36:43.619 align:start position:0%
you know that people go in and get their
 
04:36:45.890 --> 04:36:45.900 align:start position:0%
infusions done there but there are
 
04:36:48.349 --> 04:36:48.359 align:start position:0%
people who are as I say by virtue of
 
04:36:50.330 --> 04:36:50.340 align:start position:0%
their infirmity or age or combination
 
04:36:54.830 --> 04:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
thereof unable to to go to such a center
 
04:36:58.429 --> 04:36:58.439 align:start position:0%
and they need to be cared for at home uh
 
04:37:00.890 --> 04:37:00.900 align:start position:0%
and Specialty trained nurses are going
 
04:37:03.590 --> 04:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
out to these homes uh and there the
 
04:37:05.150 --> 04:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
question becomes
 
04:37:09.709 --> 04:37:09.719 align:start position:0%
can they get a sterile a setup so that
 
04:37:15.529 --> 04:37:15.539 align:start position:0%
they can combine the uh the the
 
04:37:19.250 --> 04:37:19.260 align:start position:0%
excuse me I've muted you your question
 
04:37:22.070 --> 04:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
is interesting but it is totally
 
04:37:24.769 --> 04:37:24.779 align:start position:0%
irrelevant to this bill there is nothing
 
04:37:29.510 --> 04:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
about infusion or Safe Handling anywhere
 
04:37:33.590 --> 04:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
the inspection of users talks about
 
04:37:37.189 --> 04:37:37.199 align:start position:0%
storage and labeling distribution and
 
04:37:40.189 --> 04:37:40.199 align:start position:0%
Disposal it does not talk about a septic
 
04:37:42.109 --> 04:37:42.119 align:start position:0%
technique it does not talk about
 
04:37:45.709 --> 04:37:45.719 align:start position:0%
infusion all of that process has been
 
04:37:49.490 --> 04:37:49.500 align:start position:0%
completely removed from this bill so
 
04:37:51.590 --> 04:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
please ask the question that's relevant
 
04:37:53.449 --> 04:37:53.459 align:start position:0%
to the bill and some of us and not to
 
04:37:55.670 --> 04:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
the bills from last year thank you very
 
04:37:58.730 --> 04:37:58.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:02.631 --> 04:38:02.641 align:start position:0%
well I appreciate your uh you're
 
04:38:05.269 --> 04:38:05.279 align:start position:0%
pointing this out but the reason I I
 
04:38:07.369 --> 04:38:07.379 align:start position:0%
give all this is because Miss Wilson
 
04:38:10.551 --> 04:38:10.561 align:start position:0%
said she was not part of that uh working
 
04:38:13.131 --> 04:38:13.141 align:start position:0%
group that tried to straighten that
 
04:38:15.709 --> 04:38:15.719 align:start position:0%
situation out and so I'm wondering
 
04:38:17.631 --> 04:38:17.641 align:start position:0%
whether we are going to see something
 
04:38:19.970 --> 04:38:19.980 align:start position:0%
where the the nurses and the pharmacy
 
04:38:22.369 --> 04:38:22.379 align:start position:0%
board are going to be on the same page
 
04:38:25.010 --> 04:38:25.020 align:start position:0%
because we should not be uh playing
 
04:38:28.429 --> 04:38:28.439 align:start position:0%
Solomon here so are what what can you
 
04:38:31.849 --> 04:38:31.859 align:start position:0%
tell me with regard to the any attempt
 
04:38:35.929 --> 04:38:35.939 align:start position:0%
to buy your organization to reach uh
 
04:38:37.990 --> 04:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
meeting of the minds with the pharmacist
 
04:38:43.010 --> 04:38:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:46.970 --> 04:38:46.980 align:start position:0%
well uh I I maintain that
 
04:38:48.769 --> 04:38:48.779 align:start position:0%
that as representative of the of the
 
04:38:51.170 --> 04:38:51.180 align:start position:0%
association we maintain that
 
04:38:55.670 --> 04:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
um each board is responsible for
 
04:38:55.680 --> 04:38:56.570 align:start position:0%
um each board is responsible for
um

04:38:56.570 --> 04:38:56.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:59.929 --> 04:38:59.939 align:start position:0%
making sure that the rules are in place
 
04:39:03.109 --> 04:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
the people that they're that people who
 
04:39:04.970 --> 04:39:04.980 align:start position:0%
are licensed by that board
 
04:39:09.109 --> 04:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
uh our competent and are following the
 
04:39:11.510 --> 04:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
rules and uh
 
04:39:14.269 --> 04:39:14.279 align:start position:0%
I uh as far as
 
04:39:17.449 --> 04:39:17.459 align:start position:0%
I mean collaboration is fine but
 
04:39:21.230 --> 04:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
um as far as inspecting uh I I do
 
04:39:22.551 --> 04:39:22.561 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
04:39:26.330 --> 04:39:26.340 align:start position:0%
um it's important for uh each board to
 
04:39:31.910 --> 04:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:35.689 --> 04:39:35.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:35.699 --> 04:39:38.510 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:39:38.510 --> 04:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:42.530 --> 04:39:42.540 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair so but the
 
04:39:44.288 --> 04:39:44.298 align:start position:0%
point is that
 
04:39:47.090 --> 04:39:47.100 align:start position:0%
respecting the competence of you and
 
04:39:50.810 --> 04:39:50.820 align:start position:0%
your organization uh this is this is
 
04:39:54.590 --> 04:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
something that needs to be resolved and
 
04:39:57.830 --> 04:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
so that's my question is what is being
 
04:40:00.470 --> 04:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
done to reach a meeting of the mind so
 
04:40:03.550 --> 04:40:03.560 align:start position:0%
that we have a collaboration of two two
 
04:40:07.430 --> 04:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
separate entities uh both of which are
 
04:40:11.390 --> 04:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
highly trained uh and so much Turf
 
04:40:14.390 --> 04:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
sensitive I understand but we we got to
 
04:40:16.788 --> 04:40:16.798 align:start position:0%
get a resolution of this
 
04:40:20.208 --> 04:40:20.218 align:start position:0%
and just putting it off is not it's not
 
04:40:22.250 --> 04:40:22.260 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of the citizens of
 
04:40:24.410 --> 04:40:24.420 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so where are we going with
 
04:40:24.420 --> 04:40:25.310 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so where are we going with
this

04:40:25.310 --> 04:40:25.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:40:28.788 --> 04:40:28.798 align:start position:0%
uh I I understand your concern but uh
 
04:40:32.090 --> 04:40:32.100 align:start position:0%
again we are we are governed by RSA
 
04:40:32.100 --> 04:40:34.670 align:start position:0%
again we are we are governed by RSA
326-b

04:40:34.670 --> 04:40:34.680 align:start position:0%
326-b
 
04:40:37.690 --> 04:40:37.700 align:start position:0%
uh which gives us our scope of practice
 
04:40:41.270 --> 04:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
uh each level of nursing has this in
 
04:40:44.690 --> 04:40:44.700 align:start position:0%
place and uh
 
04:40:47.570 --> 04:40:47.580 align:start position:0%
our licensure is
 
04:40:47.580 --> 04:40:49.850 align:start position:0%
our licensure is
um

04:40:49.850 --> 04:40:49.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:54.110 --> 04:40:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:57.050 --> 04:40:57.060 align:start position:0%
Board of Nursing and I would say that
 
04:40:59.630 --> 04:40:59.640 align:start position:0%
for the other disciplines as well
 
04:41:08.448 --> 04:41:08.458 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:11.830 --> 04:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:14.570 --> 04:41:14.580 align:start position:0%
I'll see any other questions I'd like to
 
04:41:14.580 --> 04:41:16.430 align:start position:0%
I'll see any other questions I'd like to
call

04:41:16.430 --> 04:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
call
 
04:41:19.368 --> 04:41:19.378 align:start position:0%
Ellen piranhas
 
04:41:19.378 --> 04:41:22.490 align:start position:0%
Ellen piranhas
foreign

04:41:22.490 --> 04:41:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:25.670 --> 04:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Madam chair and committee
 
04:41:29.208 --> 04:41:29.218 align:start position:0%
members my name is Helen pravanus and I
 
04:41:31.250 --> 04:41:31.260 align:start position:0%
am representing the New Hampshire Board
 
04:41:34.190 --> 04:41:34.200 align:start position:0%
of Pharmacy I am the current president
 
04:41:36.490 --> 04:41:36.500 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire Board of Pharmacy
 
04:41:41.448 --> 04:41:41.458 align:start position:0%
and we are in favor of House Bill 444
 
04:41:43.910 --> 04:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
which has been sponsored by
 
04:41:47.990 --> 04:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant and um massamila
 
04:41:51.590 --> 04:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
so this bill serves to clarify and
 
04:41:54.650 --> 04:41:54.660 align:start position:0%
further Define some existing statutes
 
04:41:56.270 --> 04:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
pertinent to the practice of Pharmacy
 
04:41:58.550 --> 04:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
and I just want to take just a few
 
04:42:00.770 --> 04:42:00.780 align:start position:0%
moments to comment on some of these
 
04:42:00.780 --> 04:42:01.788 align:start position:0%
moments to comment on some of these
changes

04:42:01.788 --> 04:42:01.798 align:start position:0%
changes
 
04:42:04.750 --> 04:42:04.760 align:start position:0%
regarding the collaborative practice
 
04:42:08.150 --> 04:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
agreements the statue was simplified to
 
04:42:10.750 --> 04:42:10.760 align:start position:0%
read an agreement between the pharmacist
 
04:42:14.570 --> 04:42:14.580 align:start position:0%
and the patient's practitioner and not
 
04:42:16.330 --> 04:42:16.340 align:start position:0%
requiring the
 
04:42:18.470 --> 04:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
patient signed the agreement but
 
04:42:20.628 --> 04:42:20.638 align:start position:0%
obviously the patient give consent to
 
04:42:22.850 --> 04:42:22.860 align:start position:0%
care so just to give you a little bit of
 
04:42:25.250 --> 04:42:25.260 align:start position:0%
background about how a collaborative
 
04:42:27.490 --> 04:42:27.500 align:start position:0%
practice agreement works
 
04:42:31.550 --> 04:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
for example we have several Pharmacists
 
04:42:33.110 --> 04:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
and Physicians that have collaborative
 
04:42:35.410 --> 04:42:35.420 align:start position:0%
collaborative practice agreements around
 
04:42:38.990 --> 04:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
anticoagulant therapy so for example a
 
04:42:41.330 --> 04:42:41.340 align:start position:0%
patient would come into the pharmacy
 
04:42:44.150 --> 04:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
they would get their lab work done
 
04:42:46.310 --> 04:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
a level would be
 
04:42:49.070 --> 04:42:49.080 align:start position:0%
um attained and based on that level and
 
04:42:51.350 --> 04:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
based on what the physician would like
 
04:42:54.230 --> 04:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
the Coumadin levels to be adjusted by
 
04:42:56.810 --> 04:42:56.820 align:start position:0%
that's what that that pharmacist would
 
04:42:58.610 --> 04:42:58.620 align:start position:0%
do so that's kind of an example of like
 
04:43:00.288 --> 04:43:00.298 align:start position:0%
a simple collaborative practice
 
04:43:03.770 --> 04:43:03.780 align:start position:0%
agreement around a anticoagulant type of
 
04:43:06.470 --> 04:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh of a clinic setting
 
04:43:09.110 --> 04:43:09.120 align:start position:0%
um regarding inspection and regulation
 
04:43:11.570 --> 04:43:11.580 align:start position:0%
of certain uses of prescription drugs
 
04:43:13.730 --> 04:43:13.740 align:start position:0%
again additional verbiage was added
 
04:43:15.948 --> 04:43:15.958 align:start position:0%
there to adopt and enforce standards to
 
04:43:18.650 --> 04:43:18.660 align:start position:0%
promote Safe Handling storage labeling
 
04:43:20.868 --> 04:43:20.878 align:start position:0%
distribution and disposal of
 
04:43:23.330 --> 04:43:23.340 align:start position:0%
prescriptions and to also report any
 
04:43:25.610 --> 04:43:25.620 align:start position:0%
infractions again to those responsible
 
04:43:28.670 --> 04:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
agencies or licensing boards so there's
 
04:43:31.250 --> 04:43:31.260 align:start position:0%
nothing there um
 
04:43:33.708 --> 04:43:33.718 align:start position:0%
um to you know talk about as Ms Wilson
 
04:43:35.690 --> 04:43:35.700 align:start position:0%
said about aseptic technique so there
 
04:43:38.030 --> 04:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
isn't anything there around that and
 
04:43:40.190 --> 04:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
again it it really is all about
 
04:43:43.010 --> 04:43:43.020 align:start position:0%
promoting patient safety
 
04:43:47.390 --> 04:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
um you know the inspectors go in and you
 
04:43:50.448 --> 04:43:50.458 align:start position:0%
know take a thorough look as far as you
 
04:43:52.730 --> 04:43:52.740 align:start position:0%
know the standards that that should be
 
04:43:54.590 --> 04:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
met when
 
04:43:56.750 --> 04:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
um you know anything that around
 
04:43:59.750 --> 04:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
medications right is is involved and
 
04:44:02.150 --> 04:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
bringing that then to the attention of
 
04:44:05.030 --> 04:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
that of their of their own boards
 
04:44:07.190 --> 04:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
um we feel is appropriate and again as
 
04:44:09.230 --> 04:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
representative mentioned
 
04:44:10.730 --> 04:44:10.740 align:start position:0%
um you know I've been on the board for
 
04:44:13.550 --> 04:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
nine years now and you know back in the
 
04:44:16.970 --> 04:44:16.980 align:start position:0%
day we we were asked to do this by all
 
04:44:18.948 --> 04:44:18.958 align:start position:0%
of the all of the medical boards they
 
04:44:20.750 --> 04:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
they wanted our assistance because they
 
04:44:24.650 --> 04:44:24.660 align:start position:0%
didn't have the capability and
 
04:44:26.990 --> 04:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
um the people available to do these
 
04:44:28.788 --> 04:44:28.798 align:start position:0%
inspections for them so they actually
 
04:44:32.350 --> 04:44:32.360 align:start position:0%
you know asked us to do this
 
04:44:35.270 --> 04:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
regarding the pharmacy permits again
 
04:44:37.368 --> 04:44:37.378 align:start position:0%
additional verbiage was added there to
 
04:44:40.190 --> 04:44:40.200 align:start position:0%
include the permit holder and pharmacist
 
04:44:42.830 --> 04:44:42.840 align:start position:0%
in charge to have joint and equal
 
04:44:45.050 --> 04:44:45.060 align:start position:0%
responsibility we really feel that this
 
04:44:47.270 --> 04:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
is very very important
 
04:44:50.030 --> 04:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
um there are instances where there are
 
04:44:52.250 --> 04:44:52.260 align:start position:0%
certain things that are found upon
 
04:44:55.190 --> 04:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
inspection in the pharmacy where the
 
04:44:57.948 --> 04:44:57.958 align:start position:0%
pharmacist in charge maybe is you know
 
04:44:59.690 --> 04:44:59.700 align:start position:0%
trying to get it fixed like for example
 
04:45:02.090 --> 04:45:02.100 align:start position:0%
the refrigerator isn't at the right
 
04:45:05.510 --> 04:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
temperature and they have reached out to
 
04:45:07.490 --> 04:45:07.500 align:start position:0%
possibly their permit holder their
 
04:45:10.368 --> 04:45:10.378 align:start position:0%
corporate their manager and they are
 
04:45:12.590 --> 04:45:12.600 align:start position:0%
still not able to get those those
 
04:45:14.510 --> 04:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
changes they are not able to get a new
 
04:45:17.690 --> 04:45:17.700 align:start position:0%
refrigerator or get it fixed and so in
 
04:45:19.970 --> 04:45:19.980 align:start position:0%
the so the way the rules stand now or
 
04:45:22.850 --> 04:45:22.860 align:start position:0%
the statue stands now the responsibility
 
04:45:24.590 --> 04:45:24.600 align:start position:0%
is the pharmacist in charge and the
 
04:45:26.690 --> 04:45:26.700 align:start position:0%
pharmacist in charge is then receiving
 
04:45:28.850 --> 04:45:28.860 align:start position:0%
that disciplinary action when in fact
 
04:45:30.530 --> 04:45:30.540 align:start position:0%
their hands are tied and they really
 
04:45:32.750 --> 04:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
can't can't do as much as
 
04:45:35.810 --> 04:45:35.820 align:start position:0%
um as they're able to so that's why that
 
04:45:38.690 --> 04:45:38.700 align:start position:0%
verbiage was added there and
 
04:45:38.700 --> 04:45:39.530 align:start position:0%
verbiage was added there and
um

04:45:39.530 --> 04:45:39.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:43.010 --> 04:45:43.020 align:start position:0%
and yeah and again I I do want to say
 
04:45:45.830 --> 04:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
that the Board of Pharmacy again fully
 
04:45:48.350 --> 04:45:48.360 align:start position:0%
supports this bill and the
 
04:45:50.750 --> 04:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
um RSA amendments and I thank you very
 
04:45:53.030 --> 04:45:53.040 align:start position:0%

04:46:03.530 --> 04:46:03.540 align:start position:0%

name is Michael Auerbach I'm the
 
04:46:33.050 --> 04:46:33.060 align:start position:0%
executive director of the New Hampshire
 
04:46:35.810 --> 04:46:35.820 align:start position:0%
Dental Society the nhgs is opposed to
 
04:46:35.820 --> 04:46:37.550 align:start position:0%
Dental Society the nhgs is opposed to
hb44

04:46:37.550 --> 04:46:37.560 align:start position:0%
hb44
 
04:46:39.948 --> 04:46:39.958 align:start position:0%
the nhds is a Statewide organization
 
04:46:42.230 --> 04:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
representing over 1100 members of the
 
04:46:44.150 --> 04:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
dental profession including dentists
 
04:46:46.190 --> 04:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
dental hygienists dental assistants and
 
04:46:48.890 --> 04:46:48.900 align:start position:0%
practice managers all of whom operate in
 
04:46:50.570 --> 04:46:50.580 align:start position:0%
accordance with the laws and rules of
 
04:46:52.788 --> 04:46:52.798 align:start position:0%
the dental practice act as administered
 
04:46:55.550 --> 04:46:55.560 align:start position:0%
by the board of dental examiners if a
 
04:46:58.010 --> 04:46:58.020 align:start position:0%
violation of these laws or rules occurs
 
04:47:00.530 --> 04:47:00.540 align:start position:0%
the Bode launches a thorough
 
04:47:02.570 --> 04:47:02.580 align:start position:0%
investigation of the charges including
 
04:47:05.270 --> 04:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
if necessary an on-site inspection if
 
04:47:07.550 --> 04:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action is warranted the
 
04:47:09.170 --> 04:47:09.180 align:start position:0%
accused is given a fair and reasonable
 
04:47:10.690 --> 04:47:10.700 align:start position:0%
hearing conducted by the board
 
04:47:13.368 --> 04:47:13.378 align:start position:0%
consisting of dentist hygienists and
 
04:47:15.890 --> 04:47:15.900 align:start position:0%
others whose expertise in dentistry is
 
04:47:17.448 --> 04:47:17.458 align:start position:0%
brought to bear
 
04:47:19.670 --> 04:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
furthermore any dentist who prescribes
 
04:47:22.310 --> 04:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
medications for patients must maintain
 
04:47:25.190 --> 04:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
an active DEA license the requirements
 
04:47:26.930 --> 04:47:26.940 align:start position:0%
for which are updated continuing
 
04:47:29.090 --> 04:47:29.100 align:start position:0%
education training on the safe storage
 
04:47:31.970 --> 04:47:31.980 align:start position:0%
handling labeling distribution and
 
04:47:35.570 --> 04:47:35.580 align:start position:0%
disposal of prescription drugs the DEA
 
04:47:38.510 --> 04:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
May if warranted conduct inspections and
 
04:47:40.310 --> 04:47:40.320 align:start position:0%
initiate disciplinary actions for
 
04:47:40.320 --> 04:47:41.868 align:start position:0%
initiate disciplinary actions for
non-compliance

04:47:41.868 --> 04:47:41.878 align:start position:0%
non-compliance
 
04:47:44.510 --> 04:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
in fact in light of the opioid crisis
 
04:47:46.910 --> 04:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
several years ago it was made mandatory
 
04:47:49.368 --> 04:47:49.378 align:start position:0%
that all dentists as a condition of New
 
04:47:51.470 --> 04:47:51.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State licensure undergo
 
04:47:54.050 --> 04:47:54.060 align:start position:0%
biennial continuing education on opioids
 
04:47:55.970 --> 04:47:55.980 align:start position:0%
and other prescription drugs
 
04:47:58.490 --> 04:47:58.500 align:start position:0%
lastly nhds and the American Dental
 
04:48:00.948 --> 04:48:00.958 align:start position:0%
Association have in place a number of
 
04:48:03.708 --> 04:48:03.718 align:start position:0%
relevant parameters such as our Council
 
04:48:05.868 --> 04:48:05.878 align:start position:0%
on ethics and Council on peer review
 
04:48:08.270 --> 04:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
which provide another layer of oversight
 
04:48:10.490 --> 04:48:10.500 align:start position:0%
on a wide range of issues including
 
04:48:12.830 --> 04:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
prescription protocols
 
04:48:14.390 --> 04:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
it is the belief of the New Hampshire
 
04:48:17.208 --> 04:48:17.218 align:start position:0%
Dental Society the hb44 creates an
 
04:48:18.830 --> 04:48:18.840 align:start position:0%
unnecessary additional layer of
 
04:48:20.990 --> 04:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
oversight one that is separate and
 
04:48:22.788 --> 04:48:22.798 align:start position:0%
disconnected from the primary licensing
 
04:48:25.190 --> 04:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
board for dentistry in New Hampshire Our
 
04:48:26.750 --> 04:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
concern is that this bill was developed
 
04:48:28.368 --> 04:48:28.378 align:start position:0%
without the consultation of the board of
 
04:48:30.708 --> 04:48:30.718 align:start position:0%
dental examiners or any of the other
 
04:48:33.170 --> 04:48:33.180 align:start position:0%
licensing boards under the oplc
 
04:48:34.970 --> 04:48:34.980 align:start position:0%
we're also deeply concerned that the
 
04:48:36.650 --> 04:48:36.660 align:start position:0%
board of pharmacies relative lack of
 
04:48:39.110 --> 04:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
familiarity with Dentistry May Foster
 
04:48:41.208 --> 04:48:41.218 align:start position:0%
unwarranted inspections that cause
 
04:48:44.090 --> 04:48:44.100 align:start position:0%
confusion and fear among patients
 
04:48:46.190 --> 04:48:46.200 align:start position:0%
we understand that an amendment has been
 
04:48:47.930 --> 04:48:47.940 align:start position:0%
offered that would be that will exempt
 
04:48:49.490 --> 04:48:49.500 align:start position:0%
dentists from section two of this bill
 
04:48:51.948 --> 04:48:51.958 align:start position:0%
the nhgs is in favor of such an
 
04:48:53.868 --> 04:48:53.878 align:start position:0%
amendment however with regard to the
 
04:48:55.490 --> 04:48:55.500 align:start position:0%
original Bill we believe that it will
 
04:48:57.350 --> 04:48:57.360 align:start position:0%
negatively impact Dental practices
 
04:49:00.110 --> 04:49:00.120 align:start position:0%
across the state we therefore request
 
04:49:01.610 --> 04:49:01.620 align:start position:0%
that you vote this legislation in
 
04:49:04.070 --> 04:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate and as always the
 
04:49:05.690 --> 04:49:05.700 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Dental Society is happy to
 
04:49:07.970 --> 04:49:07.980 align:start position:0%
provide any information and resources
 
04:49:10.250 --> 04:49:10.260 align:start position:0%
that this committee may need to make an
 
04:49:12.470 --> 04:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
informed decision thank you and I'll be
 
04:49:13.730 --> 04:49:13.740 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions that you may
 
04:49:17.150 --> 04:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
have thank you Mr Auerbach do I take
 
04:49:20.030 --> 04:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
your comments to mean that you object to
 
04:49:20.040 --> 04:49:21.850 align:start position:0%
your comments to mean that you object to
section

04:49:21.850 --> 04:49:21.860 align:start position:0%
section
 
04:49:24.708 --> 04:49:24.718 align:start position:0%
two of the bill on inspections and you
 
04:49:27.050 --> 04:49:27.060 align:start position:0%
don't care about the rest our biggest
 
04:49:29.750 --> 04:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
concern right now is the uh is the
 
04:49:31.490 --> 04:49:31.500 align:start position:0%
addition of additional inspections and
 
04:49:33.050 --> 04:49:33.060 align:start position:0%
so and oversight over the board of
 
04:49:34.850 --> 04:49:34.860 align:start position:0%
dental examiners and the dentists
 
04:49:37.010 --> 04:49:37.020 align:start position:0%
themselves so section two is specific to
 
04:49:37.020 --> 04:49:38.150 align:start position:0%
themselves so section two is specific to
that

04:49:38.150 --> 04:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:49:40.010 --> 04:49:40.020 align:start position:0%
um as I said I would be in support of
 
04:49:42.110 --> 04:49:42.120 align:start position:0%
the amendment striking dentist from that
 
04:49:44.990 --> 04:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
section uh but I I we're all concerned
 
04:49:46.730 --> 04:49:46.740 align:start position:0%
about the additional layers of oversight
 
04:49:48.890 --> 04:49:48.900 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any other questions
 
04:49:53.470 --> 04:49:53.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:56.690 --> 04:49:56.700 align:start position:0%

is president of the New Hampshire Board
 
04:50:18.948 --> 04:50:18.958 align:start position:0%

to an emergency procedure uh however uh
 
04:50:25.670 --> 04:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
through uh Mike padmore you have
 
04:50:28.430 --> 04:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
received an email of his written
 
04:50:31.550 --> 04:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
testimony uh and for the record the
 
04:50:33.770 --> 04:50:33.780 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine did vote against this
 
04:50:33.780 --> 04:50:35.270 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine did vote against this
provision

04:50:35.270 --> 04:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
provision
 
04:50:38.628 --> 04:50:38.638 align:start position:0%
um last year and again this year
 
04:50:38.638 --> 04:50:39.230 align:start position:0%
um last year and again this year
um

04:50:39.230 --> 04:50:39.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:41.510 --> 04:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
the medical society is again strongly
 
04:50:45.110 --> 04:50:45.120 align:start position:0%
opposing the language in section two of
 
04:50:47.868 --> 04:50:47.878 align:start position:0%
House Bill 444 that would strengthen the
 
04:50:49.970 --> 04:50:49.980 align:start position:0%
board of Pharmacy's ability to inspect
 
04:50:53.510 --> 04:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
ant will other uh licensed providers
 
04:50:55.670 --> 04:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
from other boards
 
04:50:59.030 --> 04:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
um so we have sent uh you all hopefully
 
04:51:01.550 --> 04:51:01.560 align:start position:0%
you've received at a proposed amendment
 
04:51:04.490 --> 04:51:04.500 align:start position:0%
uh on this proposed amendment this has
 
04:51:05.990 --> 04:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
been endorsed by the New Hampshire

specifically to that end

beginning on line eight of Hospital 444
 
04:51:30.288 --> 04:51:30.298 align:start position:0%
we would ask to strike the words going
 
04:51:32.990 --> 04:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
to line nine Physicians veterinarians
 
04:51:35.030 --> 04:51:35.040 align:start position:0%

and from the bill
 
04:51:43.490 --> 04:51:43.500 align:start position:0%
um I did hear your other uh discussion
 
04:51:46.910 --> 04:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
about Xiao versus May and if those
 
04:51:49.430 --> 04:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
practitioners are struck that it doesn't
 
04:51:51.708 --> 04:51:51.718 align:start position:0%
matter to us although we have suggested
 
04:51:54.948 --> 04:51:54.958 align:start position:0%
the the word may rather than shell also
 
04:51:57.110 --> 04:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
in our Amendment we would add a new
 
04:51:59.410 --> 04:51:59.420 align:start position:0%
section new section three
 
04:52:05.770 --> 04:52:05.780 align:start position:0%
that is references uh uh uh section 318
 
04:52:09.288 --> 04:52:09.298 align:start position:0%
9-a Inspection Services this this
 
04:52:14.410 --> 04:52:14.420 align:start position:0%
actually was part of HB 1536 last year
 
04:52:17.030 --> 04:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
and what it says is that the Board of
 
04:52:19.910 --> 04:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy then we strike shall and add
 
04:52:22.670 --> 04:52:22.680 align:start position:0%
May a provide inspectional services
 
04:52:27.708 --> 04:52:27.718 align:start position:0%
under the Chamber of rsna 18 318 B25 to
 
04:52:29.090 --> 04:52:29.100 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine the board of
 
04:52:30.470 --> 04:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
veterinary medicine the board of
 
04:52:32.628 --> 04:52:32.638 align:start position:0%
Podiatry the board of registration for
 
04:52:36.708 --> 04:52:36.718 align:start position:0%
in Optima in Optometry the board of
 
04:52:38.570 --> 04:52:38.580 align:start position:0%
dental examiners the Board of Nursing
 
04:52:41.208 --> 04:52:41.218 align:start position:0%
and the naturopathic Board of examiners
 
04:52:44.150 --> 04:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
and it would add the words or other
 
04:52:45.948 --> 04:52:45.958 align:start position:0%
health professional licensing boards
 
04:52:49.788 --> 04:52:49.798 align:start position:0%
upon the request of the respective board
 
04:52:53.090 --> 04:52:53.100 align:start position:0%
so again it's very clear
 
04:52:55.010 --> 04:52:55.020 align:start position:0%
um enough is enough this has been
 
04:52:57.288 --> 04:52:57.298 align:start position:0%
happening for years for the last five
 
04:52:57.298 --> 04:52:58.730 align:start position:0%
happening for years for the last five
years

04:52:58.730 --> 04:52:58.740 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:53:01.128 --> 04:53:01.138 align:start position:0%
um uh and essentially we're asking that
 
04:53:03.350 --> 04:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
these professions be removed from any
 
04:53:06.350 --> 04:53:06.360 align:start position:0%
complicit complied Authority uh from the
 
04:53:07.628 --> 04:53:07.638 align:start position:0%
Board of Pharmacy
 
04:53:10.430 --> 04:53:10.440 align:start position:0%
it also clarifies that the New Hampshire
 
04:53:13.070 --> 04:53:13.080 align:start position:0%
health care professional boards retain
 
04:53:14.390 --> 04:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
the authority of their respective
 
04:53:16.550 --> 04:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
licensees request
 
04:53:19.310 --> 04:53:19.320 align:start position:0%
search inspection services of the Board
 
04:53:21.708 --> 04:53:21.718 align:start position:0%
of Pharmacy and we believe firmly that's
 
04:53:23.628 --> 04:53:23.638 align:start position:0%
the way it should be not the other way
 
04:53:23.638 --> 04:53:24.590 align:start position:0%
the way it should be not the other way
around

04:53:24.590 --> 04:53:24.600 align:start position:0%
around
 
04:53:26.628 --> 04:53:26.638 align:start position:0%
now normally we would ask you just to
 
04:53:29.330 --> 04:53:29.340 align:start position:0%
itl this bill but because of the
 
04:53:31.510 --> 04:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
repeated behaviors
 
04:53:33.250 --> 04:53:33.260 align:start position:0%
of of
 
04:53:35.448 --> 04:53:35.458 align:start position:0%
stemming from the Board of Pharmacy over
 
04:53:37.670 --> 04:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
the last five five years enough is
 
04:53:40.128 --> 04:53:40.138 align:start position:0%
enough all five professional groups are
 
04:53:41.990 --> 04:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
requesting to be removed from
 
04:53:43.788 --> 04:53:43.798 align:start position:0%
inspections and equal employer and
 
04:53:46.310 --> 04:53:46.320 align:start position:0%
clarify that the respective licenses
 
04:53:48.530 --> 04:53:48.540 align:start position:0%
boards have clear jurisdiction are able
 
04:53:50.570 --> 04:53:50.580 align:start position:0%
to re request such Inspection Services
 
04:53:53.030 --> 04:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
if warranted
 
04:53:53.040 --> 04:53:55.250 align:start position:0%
if warranted
further

04:53:55.250 --> 04:53:55.260 align:start position:0%
further
 
04:53:57.288 --> 04:53:57.298 align:start position:0%
um I think it's been misrepresented on
 
04:54:00.590 --> 04:54:00.600 align:start position:0%
the mous in fact the Board of Medicine
 
04:54:03.708 --> 04:54:03.718 align:start position:0%
last year rejected mou that was put
 
04:54:05.930 --> 04:54:05.940 align:start position:0%
forward by the Board of Pharmacy to
 
04:54:08.690 --> 04:54:08.700 align:start position:0%
accomplish this same end it is my
 
04:54:10.368 --> 04:54:10.378 align:start position:0%
understanding that the Board of Nursing
 
04:54:13.550 --> 04:54:13.560 align:start position:0%
also rejected a similar mou by the Board
 
04:54:15.830 --> 04:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
of Pharmacy so as
 
04:54:18.830 --> 04:54:18.840 align:start position:0%
last year you are on clear record that
 
04:54:20.930 --> 04:54:20.940 align:start position:0%
both these boards want nothing to do
 
04:54:22.788 --> 04:54:22.798 align:start position:0%
with the Board of Pharmacy inspecting
 
04:54:25.128 --> 04:54:25.138 align:start position:0%
their licensees not the other way around
 
04:54:27.350 --> 04:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
estimated care price today
 
04:54:29.810 --> 04:54:29.820 align:start position:0%
second this past year the executive
 
04:54:31.190 --> 04:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
director of The Board of Pharmacy was
 
04:54:33.650 --> 04:54:33.660 align:start position:0%
terminated due to high uh irregular
 
04:54:36.470 --> 04:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
activities and practices that stem from
 
04:54:37.910 --> 04:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
many of the happenings that we're
 
04:54:40.310 --> 04:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
talking about today and date back a few
 
04:54:40.320 --> 04:54:41.330 align:start position:0%
talking about today and date back a few
years

04:54:41.330 --> 04:54:41.340 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:54:44.868 --> 04:54:44.878 align:start position:0%
third not once but twice attempted Rules
 
04:54:46.730 --> 04:54:46.740 align:start position:0%
by the board Pharmacy have been thwarted
 
04:54:49.128 --> 04:54:49.138 align:start position:0%
one could say by the lack of authority
 
04:54:50.930 --> 04:54:50.940 align:start position:0%
but again we didn't think they were
 
04:54:50.940 --> 04:54:52.010 align:start position:0%
but again we didn't think they were
appropriate

04:54:52.010 --> 04:54:52.020 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
04:54:54.470 --> 04:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
um and they were opposed by many boards
 
04:54:58.010 --> 04:54:58.020 align:start position:0%
and practitioners and fourth house was
 
04:55:00.948 --> 04:55:00.958 align:start position:0%
referred to earlier uh it troubled me to
 
04:55:00.958 --> 04:55:01.850 align:start position:0%
referred to earlier uh it troubled me to
hear

04:55:01.850 --> 04:55:01.860 align:start position:0%
hear
 
04:55:07.250 --> 04:55:07.260 align:start position:0%
um the author say that Remicade uh is uh
 
04:55:10.368 --> 04:55:10.378 align:start position:0%
is compounded Remicade is not compounded
 
04:55:12.770 --> 04:55:12.780 align:start position:0%
it is mixed and that was the clear
 
04:55:17.030 --> 04:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
intent of Senate Bill 581 that was
 
04:55:20.208 --> 04:55:20.218 align:start position:0%
passed by the general uh General Court
 
04:55:22.250 --> 04:55:22.260 align:start position:0%
um that essentially restricted the board
 
04:55:24.230 --> 04:55:24.240 align:start position:0%
of pharmacies authority over compounding
 
04:55:27.530 --> 04:55:27.540 align:start position:0%
and clarified that infusion products are
 
04:55:29.628 --> 04:55:29.638 align:start position:0%
not compounded in that way has been
 
04:55:29.638 --> 04:55:30.590 align:start position:0%
not compounded in that way has been
described

04:55:30.590 --> 04:55:30.600 align:start position:0%
described
 
04:55:32.750 --> 04:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
right this was stemming from the
 
04:55:34.368 --> 04:55:34.378 align:start position:0%
previous year when the Board of Pharmacy
 
04:55:38.270 --> 04:55:38.280 align:start position:0%
went and uh inspected and fined 12
 
04:55:41.930 --> 04:55:41.940 align:start position:0%
inspection fusion therapy practices and
 
04:55:41.940 --> 04:55:44.750 align:start position:0%
inspection fusion therapy practices and
Clinics

04:55:44.750 --> 04:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:47.090 --> 04:55:47.100 align:start position:0%
also I'm very troubled by section three
 
04:55:49.730 --> 04:55:49.740 align:start position:0%
compounding standards of Hospital 444
 
04:55:51.350 --> 04:55:51.360 align:start position:0%
that would give the Board of Pharmacy
 
04:55:53.930 --> 04:55:53.940 align:start position:0%
the ability to interpret and issue rules
 
04:55:57.050 --> 04:55:57.060 align:start position:0%
on National compounding standards
 
04:55:59.750 --> 04:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
given its more checkered history of
 
04:56:02.448 --> 04:56:02.458 align:start position:0%
infusion therapy services we would urge
 
04:56:05.390 --> 04:56:05.400 align:start position:0%
the committee not to make any changes to
 
04:56:07.788 --> 04:56:07.798 align:start position:0%
the board of pharmacies authority to
 
04:56:09.470 --> 04:56:09.480 align:start position:0%
develop new rules over prescription
 
04:56:12.948 --> 04:56:12.958 align:start position:0%
drugs until the oplc's legislative
 
04:56:17.270 --> 04:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
budget assistant LBA audit is conducted
 
04:56:19.970 --> 04:56:19.980 align:start position:0%
I've been told that this LBA audit is
 
04:56:22.250 --> 04:56:22.260 align:start position:0%
scheduled for later this spring and will
 
04:56:24.890 --> 04:56:24.900 align:start position:0%
be and be focusing on the questionable
 
04:56:27.050 --> 04:56:27.060 align:start position:0%
practices of the Board of Pharmacy over
 
04:56:29.930 --> 04:56:29.940 align:start position:0%
the last five years again we're highly
 
04:56:31.850 --> 04:56:31.860 align:start position:0%
troubled I will speak to one area
 
04:56:34.550 --> 04:56:34.560 align:start position:0%
outside of section two that was
 
04:56:38.030 --> 04:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
described attending does not imply being
 
04:56:42.110 --> 04:56:42.120 align:start position:0%
a PCP or a specialist in fact attending
 
04:56:45.350 --> 04:56:45.360 align:start position:0%
refers to the patient it is the
 
04:56:48.230 --> 04:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
intending physician to the patient not
 
04:56:51.288 --> 04:56:51.298 align:start position:0%
the type of practice so again to clarify
 
04:56:54.110 --> 04:56:54.120 align:start position:0%
that dialogue I don't think that was
 
04:56:56.890 --> 04:56:56.900 align:start position:0%
correct and where that was headed again
 
04:56:59.390 --> 04:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
we're very concerned because we think
 
04:57:02.390 --> 04:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
this is being used to uh for coercive
 
04:57:04.990 --> 04:57:05.000 align:start position:0%
inspections to disrupt the marketplace
 
04:57:07.610 --> 04:57:07.620 align:start position:0%
sending patients to much more expensive
 
04:57:10.310 --> 04:57:10.320 align:start position:0%
settings and for that we oppose
 
04:57:12.530 --> 04:57:12.540 align:start position:0%
um the the bill as presented
 
04:57:15.350 --> 04:57:15.360 align:start position:0%
um ask that you adopt uh our proposed
 
04:57:17.330 --> 04:57:17.340 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you very much for your
 
04:57:18.830 --> 04:57:18.840 align:start position:0%
time I'm happy to answer any questions
 
04:57:20.030 --> 04:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
you might have
 
04:57:22.670 --> 04:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Potter can you answer
 
04:57:22.680 --> 04:57:25.010 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Potter can you answer
questions

04:57:25.010 --> 04:57:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:25.020 --> 04:57:28.610 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:57:28.610 --> 04:57:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:30.890 --> 04:57:30.900 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh thank you Mr
 
04:57:33.708 --> 04:57:33.718 align:start position:0%
Potter you mentioned that
 
04:57:35.930 --> 04:57:35.940 align:start position:0%
um you would prefer that the various
 
04:57:40.128 --> 04:57:40.138 align:start position:0%
boards could request are all say
 
04:57:42.230 --> 04:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
practitioners under the boards could
 
04:57:45.770 --> 04:57:45.780 align:start position:0%
request an inspection from the Board of
 
04:57:49.010 --> 04:57:49.020 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy could you give us an example of
 
04:57:52.128 --> 04:57:52.138 align:start position:0%
for example when a physician's office
 
04:57:55.368 --> 04:57:55.378 align:start position:0%
would request an inspection by the board
 
04:57:58.550 --> 04:57:58.560 align:start position:0%
see yeah uh right well let me clarify it
 
04:58:01.788 --> 04:58:01.798 align:start position:0%
would actually be the respective Boards
 
04:58:03.530 --> 04:58:03.540 align:start position:0%
of the licensing so it wouldn't be
 
04:58:05.590 --> 04:58:05.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily an office
 
04:58:08.208 --> 04:58:08.218 align:start position:0%
it would be a board who would hand a
 
04:58:10.970 --> 04:58:10.980 align:start position:0%
particular case and say Well we'd like a
 
04:58:15.230 --> 04:58:15.240 align:start position:0%
little bit more expertise of a uh
 
04:58:18.948 --> 04:58:18.958 align:start position:0%
inspector who has background in Pharmacy
 
04:58:22.128 --> 04:58:22.138 align:start position:0%
um and the way that the oplc is
 
04:58:25.190 --> 04:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
reorganizing its inspectors is actually
 
04:58:29.330 --> 04:58:29.340 align:start position:0%
not to a specific board but their intent
 
04:58:31.310 --> 04:58:31.320 align:start position:0%
is to have that you have a group of
 
04:58:33.890 --> 04:58:33.900 align:start position:0%
inspectors that have various expertises
 
04:58:36.350 --> 04:58:36.360 align:start position:0%
I think that's where we've gotten in
 
04:58:39.350 --> 04:58:39.360 align:start position:0%
troubles before is that certain boards
 
04:58:41.208 --> 04:58:41.218 align:start position:0%
have said uh these are inspectors and we
 
04:58:43.368 --> 04:58:43.378 align:start position:0%
got to keep them busy and so we're going
 
04:58:46.190 --> 04:58:46.200 align:start position:0%
to go forward so in this case the intent
 
04:58:49.010 --> 04:58:49.020 align:start position:0%
of the amendment is really to say that
 
04:58:51.590 --> 04:58:51.600 align:start position:0%
if the board is presented with a case or
 
04:58:53.628 --> 04:58:53.638 align:start position:0%
complaint and says we need a little bit
 
04:58:56.448 --> 04:58:56.458 align:start position:0%
more expertise in this specific case we
 
04:58:58.610 --> 04:58:58.620 align:start position:0%
can ask the Board of Pharmacy or that
 
04:59:00.890 --> 04:59:00.900 align:start position:0%
that actually it will be the board of
 
04:59:03.470 --> 04:59:03.480 align:start position:0%
pharmacies inspector or who has that
 
04:59:06.350 --> 04:59:06.360 align:start position:0%
that expertise to come in and to do a
 
04:59:10.430 --> 04:59:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:14.090 --> 04:59:14.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:14.100 --> 04:59:15.708 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:59:15.708 --> 04:59:15.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:59:19.128 --> 04:59:19.138 align:start position:0%
um a request for someone with further
 
04:59:22.788 --> 04:59:22.798 align:start position:0%
expertise for inspection would simply be
 
04:59:26.868 --> 04:59:26.878 align:start position:0%
based on a complaint that that board had
 
04:59:28.970 --> 04:59:28.980 align:start position:0%
received is that what I'm understanding
 
04:59:30.830 --> 04:59:30.840 align:start position:0%
not necessarily
 
04:59:33.190 --> 04:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
um boards investigate various practices
 
04:59:37.190 --> 04:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
uh the trends you can emanate from a
 
04:59:39.230 --> 04:59:39.240 align:start position:0%
complaint but the disciplinary practices
 
04:59:42.650 --> 04:59:42.660 align:start position:0%
are not limited do those kind of
 
04:59:45.410 --> 04:59:45.420 align:start position:0%
activities so I know it's not based
 
04:59:49.310 --> 04:59:49.320 align:start position:0%
strictly like to answer your question
 
04:59:51.288 --> 04:59:51.298 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I have no further
 
04:59:51.298 --> 04:59:52.550 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I have no further
question

04:59:52.550 --> 04:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:59:56.288 --> 04:59:56.298 align:start position:0%
are there other questions to Mr Potter
 
04:59:59.050 --> 04:59:59.060 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:00:01.670 --> 05:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
05:00:01.680 --> 05:00:03.410 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
testify

05:00:03.410 --> 05:00:03.420 align:start position:0%
testify
 
05:00:09.350 --> 05:00:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:16.750 --> 05:00:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:20.810 --> 05:00:20.820 align:start position:0%
and open the public hearing on our last
 
05:00:23.810 --> 05:00:23.820 align:start position:0%
build house bill 405.
 
05:00:27.110 --> 05:00:27.120 align:start position:0%
I don't see the sponsor
 
05:00:27.120 --> 05:00:27.890 align:start position:0%
I don't see the sponsor
so

05:00:27.890 --> 05:00:27.900 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:00:27.900 --> 05:00:33.530 align:start position:0%
so
[Music]

05:00:33.530 --> 05:00:33.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:35.390 --> 05:00:35.400 align:start position:0%
so representative Blackness would you
 
05:00:37.970 --> 05:00:37.980 align:start position:0%
introduce this bill
 
05:00:40.490 --> 05:00:40.500 align:start position:0%
yes I'm sure so this I'm introducing
 
05:00:42.770 --> 05:00:42.780 align:start position:0%
House Bill 405
 
05:00:45.310 --> 05:00:45.320 align:start position:0%
relative to out-of-state applicant
 
05:00:49.730 --> 05:00:49.740 align:start position:0%
occupational graduation licensing or
 
05:00:49.740 --> 05:00:52.610 align:start position:0%
occupational graduation licensing or
certification

05:00:52.610 --> 05:00:52.620 align:start position:0%
certification
 
05:00:54.708 --> 05:00:54.718 align:start position:0%
I really don't
 
05:00:57.050 --> 05:00:57.060 align:start position:0%
I read through this but I don't have a
 
05:00:59.208 --> 05:00:59.218 align:start position:0%
lot of uh well we already saw I really
 
05:01:00.770 --> 05:01:00.780 align:start position:0%
can't answer questions
 
05:01:05.448 --> 05:01:05.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:05.458 --> 05:01:06.530 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:01:06.530 --> 05:01:06.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:09.470 --> 05:01:09.480 align:start position:0%
the only other the only person who has
 
05:01:14.810 --> 05:01:14.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:16.970 --> 05:01:16.980 align:start position:0%
so I'm Madam chair can you hear me yes
 
05:01:16.980 --> 05:01:18.110 align:start position:0%
so I'm Madam chair can you hear me yes
fine

05:01:18.110 --> 05:01:18.120 align:start position:0%
fine
 
05:01:20.448 --> 05:01:20.458 align:start position:0%
great well thank you for having me uh
 
05:01:22.670 --> 05:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
today and thank you to the members of
 
05:01:24.830 --> 05:01:24.840 align:start position:0%
the committee for holding this hearing
 
05:01:26.750 --> 05:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
uh for the record my name is Ross
 
05:01:28.550 --> 05:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
Connolly I'm the deputy state director
 
05:01:30.470 --> 05:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
for Americans for Prosperity in New
 
05:01:32.628 --> 05:01:32.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and on behalf of the thousands
 
05:01:35.510 --> 05:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
of AFP activists across the state I urge
 
05:01:39.708 --> 05:01:39.718 align:start position:0%
you to support HB 405. while AFP
 
05:01:41.448 --> 05:01:41.458 align:start position:0%
believes the most effective form of
 
05:01:44.150 --> 05:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
recognition is to remove unnecessary
 
05:01:46.850 --> 05:01:46.860 align:start position:0%
government licensing requirements within
 
05:01:49.310 --> 05:01:49.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so that formal recognition
 
05:01:51.670 --> 05:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
would not be required in many instances
 
05:01:54.770 --> 05:01:54.780 align:start position:0%
this bill would at least give relief for
 
05:01:56.448 --> 05:01:56.458 align:start position:0%
many looking to move to New Hampshire
 
05:01:59.690 --> 05:01:59.700 align:start position:0%
and work within a licensed field
 
05:02:01.910 --> 05:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
this licensing recognition bill would
 
05:02:04.850 --> 05:02:04.860 align:start position:0%
reduce reduce barriers to dozens of
 
05:02:06.830 --> 05:02:06.840 align:start position:0%
occupations between New Hampshire and
 
05:02:09.170 --> 05:02:09.180 align:start position:0%
the rest of the country ultimate
 
05:02:11.090 --> 05:02:11.100 align:start position:0%
ultimately making New Hampshire a leader
 
05:02:13.070 --> 05:02:13.080 align:start position:0%
in removing Interstate licensing
 
05:02:13.080 --> 05:02:14.090 align:start position:0%
in removing Interstate licensing
barriers

05:02:14.090 --> 05:02:14.100 align:start position:0%
barriers
 
05:02:16.250 --> 05:02:16.260 align:start position:0%
many low-income licensed professions
 
05:02:18.350 --> 05:02:18.360 align:start position:0%
have standards and requirements That
 
05:02:21.530 --> 05:02:21.540 align:start position:0%
Vary drastically across States we found
 
05:02:22.910 --> 05:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
this was the case for health care
 
05:02:25.368 --> 05:02:25.378 align:start position:0%
workers when the state had to quickly
 
05:02:28.430 --> 05:02:28.440 align:start position:0%
increase the available capacity in the
 
05:02:30.110 --> 05:02:30.120 align:start position:0%
health care sector during the outbreak
 
05:02:32.990 --> 05:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
of the covid pandemic Governor sununu
 
05:02:35.530 --> 05:02:35.540 align:start position:0%
quickly provided Universal recognition
 
05:02:39.170 --> 05:02:39.180 align:start position:0%
uh for all Health Care sector licensed
 
05:02:39.180 --> 05:02:40.070 align:start position:0%
uh for all Health Care sector licensed
workers

05:02:40.070 --> 05:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
workers
 
05:02:41.868 --> 05:02:41.878 align:start position:0%
so you may ask who who would benefit
 
05:02:44.868 --> 05:02:44.878 align:start position:0%
from this bill looking across license
 
05:02:49.368 --> 05:02:49.378 align:start position:0%
Fields uh low-income professions across
 
05:02:51.890 --> 05:02:51.900 align:start position:0%
New England there are more than a dozen
 
05:02:54.350 --> 05:02:54.360 align:start position:0%
examples of license requirements that
 
05:02:56.690 --> 05:02:56.700 align:start position:0%
are more onerous than New Hampshire and
 
05:02:59.090 --> 05:02:59.100 align:start position:0%
should be automatically recognized
 
05:03:00.590 --> 05:03:00.600 align:start position:0%
for example
 
05:03:02.690 --> 05:03:02.700 align:start position:0%
in Rhode Island which is one of the most
 
05:03:05.590 --> 05:03:05.600 align:start position:0%
onerously licensed states in the nation
 
05:03:08.270 --> 05:03:08.280 align:start position:0%
uh the the license requirement for being
 
05:03:11.930 --> 05:03:11.940 align:start position:0%
a shampooer is 1500 hours and in
 
05:03:13.490 --> 05:03:13.500 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts it's a thousand hours
 
05:03:15.410 --> 05:03:15.420 align:start position:0%
which is the same as the license
 
05:03:17.208 --> 05:03:17.218 align:start position:0%
requirement to be a barber in New
 
05:03:20.330 --> 05:03:20.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and here we require a fraction
 
05:03:23.930 --> 05:03:23.940 align:start position:0%
of the time for shampoors requiring 150
 
05:03:23.940 --> 05:03:24.890 align:start position:0%
of the time for shampoors requiring 150
hours

05:03:24.890 --> 05:03:24.900 align:start position:0%
hours
 
05:03:27.530 --> 05:03:27.540 align:start position:0%
another example if you are an optician
 
05:03:29.390 --> 05:03:29.400 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts you are required to
 
05:03:32.030 --> 05:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
have two years of formal education pass
 
05:03:35.050 --> 05:03:35.060 align:start position:0%
three exams for a total of an estimated
 
05:03:39.350 --> 05:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
730 lost days to acquire the license
 
05:03:42.110 --> 05:03:42.120 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we require a hundred
 
05:03:45.530 --> 05:03:45.540 align:start position:0%
and ten dollar fee and to pass an exam
 
05:03:47.690 --> 05:03:47.700 align:start position:0%
the Hoops associated with quickly
 
05:03:49.490 --> 05:03:49.500 align:start position:0%
transferring your optician license have
 
05:03:51.530 --> 05:03:51.540 align:start position:0%
been waived via emergency order number
 
05:03:54.890 --> 05:03:54.900 align:start position:0%
39 but that's only temporary New
 
05:03:56.868 --> 05:03:56.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire should codify this recognition
 
05:04:00.410 --> 05:04:00.420 align:start position:0%
and statute by passing HB 405.
 
05:04:02.570 --> 05:04:02.580 align:start position:0%
and this disparity even exists when it
 
05:04:04.610 --> 05:04:04.620 align:start position:0%
comes to already widely standardized
 
05:04:07.368 --> 05:04:07.378 align:start position:0%
licenses we are in the midst of a severe
 
05:04:09.770 --> 05:04:09.780 align:start position:0%
housing shortage electricians are
 
05:04:11.990 --> 05:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
desperately needed the national
 
05:04:15.590 --> 05:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
electrical reciprocal Alliance which New
 
05:04:18.830 --> 05:04:18.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire joined in 2005 only applies to
 
05:04:21.170 --> 05:04:21.180 align:start position:0%
10 states in our bordering states of
 
05:04:24.230 --> 05:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
Maine Vermont and Massachusetts many of
 
05:04:26.868 --> 05:04:26.878 align:start position:0%
these highly burdensome states which
 
05:04:29.628 --> 05:04:29.638 align:start position:0%
also have uh the the highest out by
 
05:04:33.110 --> 05:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
outbound migration are not included in
 
05:04:35.990 --> 05:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
our reciprocity so New York Rhode Island
 
05:04:38.990 --> 05:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
California Pennsylvania New Jersey are
 
05:04:41.510 --> 05:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
just a few examples of States who do not
 
05:04:44.350 --> 05:04:44.360 align:start position:0%
have reciprocal policy for electricians
 
05:04:47.510 --> 05:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
and passing if New Hampshire passes HP
 
05:04:50.448 --> 05:04:50.458 align:start position:0%
405 it would assist in the effort to
 
05:04:52.490 --> 05:04:52.500 align:start position:0%
gain more affordable housing
 
05:04:54.410 --> 05:04:54.420 align:start position:0%
and the last comparison I will give out
 
05:04:56.270 --> 05:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
of interest of time is truck drivers
 
05:04:58.970 --> 05:04:58.980 align:start position:0%
this industry has been deemed one of the
 
05:05:00.590 --> 05:05:00.600 align:start position:0%
most essential during the coveted
 
05:05:03.470 --> 05:05:03.480 align:start position:0%
pandemic they have rightly so been
 
05:05:05.510 --> 05:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
viewed as Heroes keeping our shelves
 
05:05:07.610 --> 05:05:07.620 align:start position:0%
stocked in grocery stores and feeding
 
05:05:10.010 --> 05:05:10.020 align:start position:0%
America through very difficult times
 
05:05:12.110 --> 05:05:12.120 align:start position:0%
if you're a truck driver based in New
 
05:05:15.410 --> 05:05:15.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we only require an 80 fee for
 
05:05:17.628 --> 05:05:17.638 align:start position:0%
the license if you have if you have
 
05:05:19.730 --> 05:05:19.740 align:start position:0%
passed the proper exams
 
05:05:22.550 --> 05:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
however if you are in Rhode Island the
 
05:05:24.230 --> 05:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
requirements include two years of
 
05:05:27.770 --> 05:05:27.780 align:start position:0%
education passing five exams and losing
 
05:05:31.788 --> 05:05:31.798 align:start position:0%
an estimated of 730 days in order to
 
05:05:34.010 --> 05:05:34.020 align:start position:0%
become a tractor trailer driver
 
05:05:36.770 --> 05:05:36.780 align:start position:0%
any truck driver uh moving to Rhode
 
05:05:39.230 --> 05:05:39.240 align:start position:0%
Island uh moving from Rhode Island to
 
05:05:41.510 --> 05:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has already jumped through
 
05:05:43.250 --> 05:05:43.260 align:start position:0%
significantly more burdensome
 
05:05:45.830 --> 05:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
regulations and we should welcome them
 
05:05:48.708 --> 05:05:48.718 align:start position:0%
by eliminating any additional regulatory
 
05:05:50.930 --> 05:05:50.940 align:start position:0%
Hoops so that they can quickly begin
 
05:05:52.310 --> 05:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
contributing to New Hampshire
 
05:05:52.320 --> 05:05:53.930 align:start position:0%
contributing to New Hampshire
communities

05:05:53.930 --> 05:05:53.940 align:start position:0%
communities
 
05:05:57.170 --> 05:05:57.180 align:start position:0%
and just lastly New Hampshire requires a
 
05:06:00.050 --> 05:06:00.060 align:start position:0%
license for at least a dozen low-income
 
05:06:02.750 --> 05:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
occupations including some of those I
 
05:06:05.750 --> 05:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
have already discussed that have uh that
 
05:06:07.730 --> 05:06:07.740 align:start position:0%
more than half the country does not
 
05:06:10.670 --> 05:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
require a license for so if an optician
 
05:06:13.490 --> 05:06:13.500 align:start position:0%
or a sign language interpreter that has
 
05:06:15.708 --> 05:06:15.718 align:start position:0%
worked in the field in another state for
 
05:06:17.930 --> 05:06:17.940 align:start position:0%
years and years wants to wants to move
 
05:06:20.930 --> 05:06:20.940 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire and and work here HB
 
05:06:24.230 --> 05:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
405 will allow those who have experience
 
05:06:27.410 --> 05:06:27.420 align:start position:0%
and can prove that experience to cut the
 
05:06:29.448 --> 05:06:29.458 align:start position:0%
red red tape that may be holding them
 
05:06:31.788 --> 05:06:31.798 align:start position:0%
back from working in their field in the
 
05:06:35.390 --> 05:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
granite state or even moving here simply
 
05:06:37.550 --> 05:06:37.560 align:start position:0%
because their home state did not require
 
05:06:39.170 --> 05:06:39.180 align:start position:0%
a license
 
05:06:41.208 --> 05:06:41.218 align:start position:0%
in the current economy we as a state
 
05:06:43.010 --> 05:06:43.020 align:start position:0%
should be doing everything possible to
 
05:06:44.628 --> 05:06:44.638 align:start position:0%
welcome people from out of state who
 
05:06:46.850 --> 05:06:46.860 align:start position:0%
wish to move here and contribute to our
 
05:06:50.030 --> 05:06:50.040 align:start position:0%
communities as I've outlined Most states
 
05:06:52.010 --> 05:06:52.020 align:start position:0%
of higher licensure requirements than
 
05:06:54.230 --> 05:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and thus a risk to Public
 
05:06:56.930 --> 05:06:56.940 align:start position:0%
Safety would be low for all these
 
05:07:00.170 --> 05:07:00.180 align:start position:0%
reasons we urge you to support HB 405 to
 
05:07:02.990 --> 05:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
give this this needed regulatory relief
 
05:07:05.270 --> 05:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire's employers and
 
05:07:08.090 --> 05:07:08.100 align:start position:0%
employees and with that I'd be happy to
 
05:07:12.230 --> 05:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:16.430 --> 05:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:19.070 --> 05:07:19.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh thank you Mr
 
05:07:21.110 --> 05:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
Conley for taking a question in your
 
05:07:24.288 --> 05:07:24.298 align:start position:0%
example you mentioned truck drivers and
 
05:07:26.510 --> 05:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
I would like to hear a little bit more
 
05:07:28.970 --> 05:07:28.980 align:start position:0%
about that because
 
05:07:31.788 --> 05:07:31.798 align:start position:0%
did when you get your commercial
 
05:07:34.910 --> 05:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
driver's license that is a state
 
05:07:37.990 --> 05:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
standard yes but the state has adopted
 
05:07:40.610 --> 05:07:40.620 align:start position:0%
CFR chapter 90 from the Federal
 
05:07:43.970 --> 05:07:43.980 align:start position:0%
Regulation uh Federal standards of
 
05:07:47.150 --> 05:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation so there is
 
05:07:50.628 --> 05:07:50.638 align:start position:0%
already a reciprocity in the whole
 
05:07:52.970 --> 05:07:52.980 align:start position:0%
United States as far as the commercial
 
05:07:55.970 --> 05:07:55.980 align:start position:0%
truck driver am I correct
 
05:07:57.590 --> 05:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative for the
 
05:07:59.330 --> 05:07:59.340 align:start position:0%
question you are correct there are
 
05:08:01.310 --> 05:08:01.320 align:start position:0%
federal standards for a lot of these
 
05:08:03.050 --> 05:08:03.060 align:start position:0%
licenses as well
 
05:08:04.850 --> 05:08:04.860 align:start position:0%
um what I was specifically pointing to
 
05:08:08.208 --> 05:08:08.218 align:start position:0%
was the state uh the state requirements
 
05:08:11.690 --> 05:08:11.700 align:start position:0%
in order to obtain uh the license to be
 
05:08:13.670 --> 05:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
there's a designation for truck driver
 
05:08:15.590 --> 05:08:15.600 align:start position:0%
there's a designation for tractor
 
05:08:18.050 --> 05:08:18.060 align:start position:0%
trailer truck driver uh both in New
 
05:08:20.750 --> 05:08:20.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and in Rhode Island and there
 
05:08:23.510 --> 05:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
are requirements at the state level uh
 
05:08:25.490 --> 05:08:25.500 align:start position:0%
in order to obtain those the the
 
05:08:27.410 --> 05:08:27.420 align:start position:0%
requirements in Rhode Island are
 
05:08:30.410 --> 05:08:30.420 align:start position:0%
obviously significantly higher uh than
 
05:08:32.150 --> 05:08:32.160 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire but they do have
 
05:08:34.250 --> 05:08:34.260 align:start position:0%
reciprocity when it comes to having like
 
05:08:38.510 --> 05:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
a CDL you know Federal type uh type
 
05:08:38.520 --> 05:08:40.070 align:start position:0%
a CDL you know Federal type uh type
license

05:08:40.070 --> 05:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
license
 
05:08:42.470 --> 05:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
okay follow up if I may
 
05:08:44.810 --> 05:08:44.820 align:start position:0%
Madam chair
 
05:08:44.820 --> 05:08:46.730 align:start position:0%
Madam chair
yeah

05:08:46.730 --> 05:08:46.740 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:08:49.310 --> 05:08:49.320 align:start position:0%
are you sure I didn't make my comment is
 
05:08:52.788 --> 05:08:52.798 align:start position:0%
not to argue but it is my opinion a bad
 
05:08:55.970 --> 05:08:55.980 align:start position:0%
example because when you do get your dot
 
05:08:59.090 --> 05:08:59.100 align:start position:0%
it's one D.O.T license what you do is
 
05:09:02.868 --> 05:09:02.878 align:start position:0%
you get certain uh you apply to uh you
 
05:09:04.670 --> 05:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
know such as air brakes so there is a
 
05:09:07.550 --> 05:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
difference uh you do uh to get your
 
05:09:09.948 --> 05:09:09.958 align:start position:0%
license to get whether you could drive a
 
05:09:12.830 --> 05:09:12.840 align:start position:0%
tanker or just a cargo vehicle and
 
05:09:15.288 --> 05:09:15.298 align:start position:0%
that's all done by the federal standards
 
05:09:18.770 --> 05:09:18.780 align:start position:0%
so uh New Hampshire is just the same as
 
05:09:21.590 --> 05:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
Hawaii when it comes down in that
 
05:09:24.650 --> 05:09:24.660 align:start position:0%
example and would that not be true even
 
05:09:26.750 --> 05:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
with electrician and meeting the
 
05:09:31.730 --> 05:09:31.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:33.708 --> 05:09:33.718 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the the question
 
05:09:36.110 --> 05:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
representative uh yes that is correct
 
05:09:37.490 --> 05:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
again there are federal electric
 
05:09:40.788 --> 05:09:40.798 align:start position:0%
standards and there is vast uh
 
05:09:42.770 --> 05:09:42.780 align:start position:0%
standardization obviously it's it's the
 
05:09:44.750 --> 05:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
same electrical code
 
05:09:48.530 --> 05:09:48.540 align:start position:0%
um in in Most states however to in order
 
05:09:51.230 --> 05:09:51.240 align:start position:0%
to quickly transfer your license if you
 
05:09:54.050 --> 05:09:54.060 align:start position:0%
are in the state of say New York or New
 
05:09:57.288 --> 05:09:57.298 align:start position:0%
Jersey uh you have to completely reapply
 
05:10:00.110 --> 05:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
for the license and and there's a lot of
 
05:10:02.750 --> 05:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
of regulations that that are holding
 
05:10:05.628 --> 05:10:05.638 align:start position:0%
people back I've I just researching some
 
05:10:08.030 --> 05:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
of this bill talking to to electricians
 
05:10:11.270 --> 05:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
they that uh they do have difficulty
 
05:10:13.070 --> 05:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
moving from state to state if you're not
 
05:10:15.590 --> 05:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
within that that compact that already
 
05:10:17.990 --> 05:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
exists so this bill would just simply
 
05:10:20.868 --> 05:10:20.878 align:start position:0%
make it easier for the rest of the
 
05:10:23.208 --> 05:10:23.218 align:start position:0%
people moving from especially those High
 
05:10:25.368 --> 05:10:25.378 align:start position:0%
migration States
 
05:10:27.288 --> 05:10:27.298 align:start position:0%
um who are moving to New Hampshire as we
 
05:10:29.750 --> 05:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
know to just make that a little a little
 
05:10:32.930 --> 05:10:32.940 align:start position:0%
easier uh for for that to be able to
 
05:10:36.830 --> 05:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
quickly start uh start working here
 
05:10:38.750 --> 05:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Colleen thank you madam
 
05:10:38.760 --> 05:10:39.650 align:start position:0%

05:10:52.430 --> 05:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
on that case thank you uh Mr Connolly I
 
05:10:59.390 --> 05:10:59.400 align:start position:0%

not speaking on behalf of the boards I
 
05:11:41.750 --> 05:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
haven't been authorized to speak on the
 
05:11:44.510 --> 05:11:44.520 align:start position:0%
half of the boards uh so first I'd like
 
05:11:46.490 --> 05:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
to thank the sponsor this bill the
 
05:11:48.288 --> 05:11:48.298 align:start position:0%
intention behind this bill is admirable
 
05:11:50.690 --> 05:11:50.700 align:start position:0%
and I I want to be clear that oplc does
 
05:11:53.208 --> 05:11:53.218 align:start position:0%
not oppose reciprocity and making it
 
05:11:55.010 --> 05:11:55.020 align:start position:0%
easier for those individuals originally
 
05:11:56.690 --> 05:11:56.700 align:start position:0%
licensed in other states to come work
 
05:11:56.700 --> 05:11:57.890 align:start position:0%
licensed in other states to come work
here

05:11:57.890 --> 05:11:57.900 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:11:59.570 --> 05:11:59.580 align:start position:0%
um we have been working on some other
 
05:12:02.330 --> 05:12:02.340 align:start position:0%
bills uh to join compacts
 
05:12:03.890 --> 05:12:03.900 align:start position:0%
and and
 
05:12:05.448 --> 05:12:05.458 align:start position:0%
other things to make it easy to work
 
05:12:07.250 --> 05:12:07.260 align:start position:0%
here but there are several issues with
 
05:12:08.990 --> 05:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
this bill some minor some more major
 
05:12:11.570 --> 05:12:11.580 align:start position:0%
that oplc does have issues with and for
 
05:12:13.128 --> 05:12:13.138 align:start position:0%
that reason we do oppose the bill is
 
05:12:13.138 --> 05:12:14.150 align:start position:0%
that reason we do oppose the bill is
drafted

05:12:14.150 --> 05:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
drafted
 
05:12:15.650 --> 05:12:15.660 align:start position:0%
so if the committee wouldn't will
 
05:12:17.628 --> 05:12:17.638 align:start position:0%
indulge for a few minutes oplc's
 
05:12:19.788 --> 05:12:19.798 align:start position:0%
specific issues with this bill are as
 
05:12:19.798 --> 05:12:21.230 align:start position:0%
specific issues with this bill are as
follows

05:12:21.230 --> 05:12:21.240 align:start position:0%
follows
 
05:12:25.190 --> 05:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
on page one lines 19-20 this is a change
 
05:12:27.410 --> 05:12:27.420 align:start position:0%
to the qualifications for those applying
 
05:12:30.170 --> 05:12:30.180 align:start position:0%
for a temporary license from the oplc
 
05:12:32.208 --> 05:12:32.218 align:start position:0%
currently individuals must certify that
 
05:12:33.770 --> 05:12:33.780 align:start position:0%
they've committed no Acts or emissions
 
05:12:35.150 --> 05:12:35.160 align:start position:0%
which are grounds for disciplinary
 
05:12:37.368 --> 05:12:37.378 align:start position:0%
action in in the jurisdiction they're
 
05:12:38.330 --> 05:12:38.340 align:start position:0%
coming from
 
05:12:40.610 --> 05:12:40.620 align:start position:0%
this bill would change it and limit this
 
05:12:42.110 --> 05:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
to only Acts or missions that are
 
05:12:43.368 --> 05:12:43.378 align:start position:0%
grounds for discipline in that
 
05:12:46.128 --> 05:12:46.138 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction quote as negligence or
 
05:12:47.930 --> 05:12:47.940 align:start position:0%
intentional misconduct related to the
 
05:12:49.310 --> 05:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
person's profession
 
05:12:51.170 --> 05:12:51.180 align:start position:0%
our position is this change is
 
05:12:53.750 --> 05:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and too limiting for
 
05:12:55.368 --> 05:12:55.378 align:start position:0%
instance what about gross negligence or
 
05:12:58.550 --> 05:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
Reckless conduct uh also there's a
 
05:13:00.590 --> 05:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
question as to when
 
05:13:02.990 --> 05:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
um when an act is quote related to the
 
05:13:05.390 --> 05:13:05.400 align:start position:0%
person's profession and what really
 
05:13:07.368 --> 05:13:07.378 align:start position:0%
qualifies here
 
05:13:08.810 --> 05:13:08.820 align:start position:0%
um clearly if an applicant for an
 
05:13:10.490 --> 05:13:10.500 align:start position:0%
accounting license has been convicted of
 
05:13:12.830 --> 05:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
embezzlement that would apply but if I'm
 
05:13:15.410 --> 05:13:15.420 align:start position:0%
I'm applying for a temporary permit to
 
05:13:17.570 --> 05:13:17.580 align:start position:0%
become a barber and I have a conviction
 
05:13:20.570 --> 05:13:20.580 align:start position:0%
for assault in another jurisdiction is
 
05:13:22.850 --> 05:13:22.860 align:start position:0%
that conviction for assault related to
 
05:13:24.590 --> 05:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
my profession
 
05:13:24.600 --> 05:13:25.550 align:start position:0%
my profession
um

05:13:25.550 --> 05:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:27.590 --> 05:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
it's it's just not clear
 
05:13:29.570 --> 05:13:29.580 align:start position:0%
uh the second
 
05:13:29.580 --> 05:13:30.830 align:start position:0%
uh the second
part

05:13:30.830 --> 05:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
part
 
05:13:34.070 --> 05:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
um page one lines 25 through 26 has the
 
05:13:36.170 --> 05:13:36.180 align:start position:0%
same issue with the terms related to the
 
05:13:37.970 --> 05:13:37.980 align:start position:0%
person's profession it's it's just not
 
05:13:37.980 --> 05:13:39.948 align:start position:0%
person's profession it's it's just not
clear

05:13:39.948 --> 05:13:39.958 align:start position:0%
clear
 
05:13:44.690 --> 05:13:44.700 align:start position:0%
um page one lines 26 through 29
 
05:13:46.368 --> 05:13:46.378 align:start position:0%
so this is the portion of the bill that
 
05:13:48.530 --> 05:13:48.540 align:start position:0%
states and I'm paraphrasing that if an
 
05:13:50.030 --> 05:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
applicant has a complaint pending
 
05:13:52.490 --> 05:13:52.500 align:start position:0%
against them in another jurisdiction the
 
05:13:54.410 --> 05:13:54.420 align:start position:0%
oplc and the respective board shall
 
05:13:56.510 --> 05:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
suspend the application and may not
 
05:13:58.190 --> 05:13:58.200 align:start position:0%
issue or deny the license until the
 
05:14:01.250 --> 05:14:01.260 align:start position:0%
complaint is resolved I I understand the
 
05:14:03.530 --> 05:14:03.540 align:start position:0%
intent behind this but this is again in
 
05:14:05.770 --> 05:14:05.780 align:start position:0%
conflict with uh RSA
 
05:14:08.990 --> 05:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
541a29a which states and I paraphrase
 
05:14:11.570 --> 05:14:11.580 align:start position:0%
again that the boards must rule on an
 
05:14:13.788 --> 05:14:13.798 align:start position:0%
application within 60 days of receipt of
 
05:14:16.070 --> 05:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
that the completed application or else
 
05:14:17.930 --> 05:14:17.940 align:start position:0%
the application is deemed granted as a
 
05:14:20.810 --> 05:14:20.820 align:start position:0%
matter of law so um this conflict would
 
05:14:22.550 --> 05:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
need to be resolved in some way if this
 
05:14:24.830 --> 05:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
bill were passed
 
05:14:27.708 --> 05:14:27.718 align:start position:0%
the next uh issue
 
05:14:31.610 --> 05:14:31.620 align:start position:0%
on page two lines 17-25 this is the
 
05:14:33.170 --> 05:14:33.180 align:start position:0%
portion of the bill that would require a
 
05:14:34.788 --> 05:14:34.798 align:start position:0%
board to issue a license to someone
 
05:14:36.590 --> 05:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
based on work experience in another
 
05:14:38.448 --> 05:14:38.458 align:start position:0%
state if their home state doesn't
 
05:14:40.610 --> 05:14:40.620 align:start position:0%
license that profession they've worked
 
05:14:42.170 --> 05:14:42.180 align:start position:0%
for three years in that occupation and
 
05:14:44.390 --> 05:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
they meet certain other requirements
 
05:14:47.150 --> 05:14:47.160 align:start position:0%
so there's several issues with this the
 
05:14:50.390 --> 05:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
the the smaller issue is on line 24. um
 
05:14:53.090 --> 05:14:53.100 align:start position:0%
they have to verify that they've worked
 
05:14:54.708 --> 05:14:54.718 align:start position:0%
in their profession in that home state
 
05:14:57.770 --> 05:14:57.780 align:start position:0%
for three years uh I I'm not sure how
 
05:14:59.868 --> 05:14:59.878 align:start position:0%
oplc can verify this if they're not
 
05:15:02.150 --> 05:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
licensed in their home state I suppose
 
05:15:04.070 --> 05:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
we would be
 
05:15:04.080 --> 05:15:05.570 align:start position:0%
we would be
um

05:15:05.570 --> 05:15:05.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:07.250 --> 05:15:07.260 align:start position:0%
basically trusting them when they say
 
05:15:08.690 --> 05:15:08.700 align:start position:0%
that they have have worked in that
 
05:15:12.110 --> 05:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
profession for for three years but the
 
05:15:14.090 --> 05:15:14.100 align:start position:0%
larger issue is one we testified to on a
 
05:15:17.150 --> 05:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
similar Bill last legislative session
 
05:15:18.770 --> 05:15:18.780 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure how to phrase this I'm
 
05:15:20.090 --> 05:15:20.100 align:start position:0%
just going to call it unintended
 
05:15:20.100 --> 05:15:21.890 align:start position:0%
just going to call it unintended
consequences

05:15:21.890 --> 05:15:21.900 align:start position:0%
consequences
 
05:15:23.690 --> 05:15:23.700 align:start position:0%
um naturopathic doctors are the prime
 
05:15:25.850 --> 05:15:25.860 align:start position:0%
example here there may be others though
 
05:15:27.708 --> 05:15:27.718 align:start position:0%
we do that we don't know about
 
05:15:30.830 --> 05:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
so not all states regulate naturopathic
 
05:15:33.590 --> 05:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
doctrines 18 states and U.S territories
 
05:15:35.990 --> 05:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
do New Hampshire is one of them and in
 
05:15:38.150 --> 05:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire naturopaths may actually
 
05:15:40.550 --> 05:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
may prescribe medications according to
 
05:15:42.470 --> 05:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
the naturopathic formulary which is set
 
05:15:44.990 --> 05:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
by the naturopathic board so if this
 
05:15:46.430 --> 05:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
bill is passed we could have the
 
05:15:48.170 --> 05:15:48.180 align:start position:0%
situation where someone from a state
 
05:15:50.868 --> 05:15:50.878 align:start position:0%
that does not license naturopaths could
 
05:15:53.390 --> 05:15:53.400 align:start position:0%
open a business there hang out a shingle
 
05:15:56.030 --> 05:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
call themselves a naturopath
 
05:15:56.040 --> 05:15:56.750 align:start position:0%
call themselves a naturopath
um

05:15:56.750 --> 05:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:58.788 --> 05:15:58.798 align:start position:0%
with little or no training they could
 
05:16:00.230 --> 05:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
practice in that state for three years
 
05:16:02.690 --> 05:16:02.700 align:start position:0%
moved to New Hampshire and then get a
 
05:16:04.490 --> 05:16:04.500 align:start position:0%
license under this provision that
 
05:16:06.230 --> 05:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
individual would then according to state
 
05:16:07.850 --> 05:16:07.860 align:start position:0%
law have the ability to prescribe
 
05:16:09.590 --> 05:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
medications to the public with no
 
05:16:12.110 --> 05:16:12.120 align:start position:0%
training so oplc does have concerns
 
05:16:13.550 --> 05:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
about that
 
05:16:15.110 --> 05:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
um as I said there may be other
 
05:16:17.208 --> 05:16:17.218 align:start position:0%
professions with similar concerns I just
 
05:16:18.770 --> 05:16:18.780 align:start position:0%
don't know and it would take an
 
05:16:20.090 --> 05:16:20.100 align:start position:0%
extensive review of other states
 
05:16:22.910 --> 05:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
licensing schemes What professions those
 
05:16:25.730 --> 05:16:25.740 align:start position:0%
States license and the Scopes of
 
05:16:27.350 --> 05:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
practice of
 
05:16:32.930 --> 05:16:32.940 align:start position:0%
um various uh State Licensing schemes
 
05:16:35.750 --> 05:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
um the next concern so that's I think
 
05:16:37.730 --> 05:16:37.740 align:start position:0%
that's the biggest concern the next
 
05:16:40.670 --> 05:16:40.680 align:start position:0%
concern page two lines 26 through Page
 
05:16:43.368 --> 05:16:43.378 align:start position:0%
Three line two so this is the portion of
 
05:16:45.050 --> 05:16:45.060 align:start position:0%
the bill that would require a board to
 
05:16:47.090 --> 05:16:47.100 align:start position:0%
issue a license to someone who holds a
 
05:16:49.128 --> 05:16:49.138 align:start position:0%
private certification if their home
 
05:16:51.530 --> 05:16:51.540 align:start position:0%
state doesn't license that profession
 
05:16:53.570 --> 05:16:53.580 align:start position:0%
they worked for two years in that
 
05:16:55.970 --> 05:16:55.980 align:start position:0%
profession and they hold a private
 
05:16:58.010 --> 05:16:58.020 align:start position:0%
certification in our in good standing
 
05:17:00.230 --> 05:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
with that certifying body and I meet a
 
05:17:03.470 --> 05:17:03.480 align:start position:0%
few other requirements so this is
 
05:17:04.910 --> 05:17:04.920 align:start position:0%
another route for those seeking
 
05:17:07.010 --> 05:17:07.020 align:start position:0%
licensure that are coming from another
 
05:17:08.510 --> 05:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
state that doesn't regulate that
 
05:17:10.490 --> 05:17:10.500 align:start position:0%
profession only now they can get a
 
05:17:12.530 --> 05:17:12.540 align:start position:0%
license I see it as similar to the
 
05:17:14.208 --> 05:17:14.218 align:start position:0%
previous but now they can get a license
 
05:17:16.670 --> 05:17:16.680 align:start position:0%
after two years based on a private
 
05:17:18.948 --> 05:17:18.958 align:start position:0%
certification rather than the three in
 
05:17:20.570 --> 05:17:20.580 align:start position:0%
the previous subsection
 
05:17:24.170 --> 05:17:24.180 align:start position:0%
so oplc's same concerns apply here
 
05:17:26.270 --> 05:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
um first how do we verify that they've
 
05:17:27.708 --> 05:17:27.718 align:start position:0%
worked in that profession for the two
 
05:17:30.288 --> 05:17:30.298 align:start position:0%
years and second the larger issue of
 
05:17:32.570 --> 05:17:32.580 align:start position:0%
unforeseen consequences which I
 
05:17:34.670 --> 05:17:34.680 align:start position:0%
explained in the example of the
 
05:17:36.230 --> 05:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
naturopathic doctors
 
05:17:38.208 --> 05:17:38.218 align:start position:0%
but the other concern here is with these
 
05:17:40.550 --> 05:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
private certifying bodies
 
05:17:43.128 --> 05:17:43.138 align:start position:0%
um I want to be clear many outside
 
05:17:45.410 --> 05:17:45.420 align:start position:0%
certified bodies are excellent and many
 
05:17:47.208 --> 05:17:47.218 align:start position:0%
of our boards rely on either private
 
05:17:49.730 --> 05:17:49.740 align:start position:0%
certifications to some extent or tests
 
05:17:50.990 --> 05:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
that were developed by these outside
 
05:17:54.050 --> 05:17:54.060 align:start position:0%
certifying groups but the fact of the
 
05:17:55.070 --> 05:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
matter is
 
05:17:57.230 --> 05:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
anyone can start a non-governmental
 
05:17:59.448 --> 05:17:59.458 align:start position:0%
certifying body and the state has no
 
05:18:01.310 --> 05:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
control over the qualifications that the
 
05:18:03.708 --> 05:18:03.718 align:start position:0%
certifying body would require
 
05:18:06.490 --> 05:18:06.500 align:start position:0%
um so you know what would stop a
 
05:18:09.948 --> 05:18:09.958 align:start position:0%
unscrupulous individual from creating
 
05:18:11.448 --> 05:18:11.458 align:start position:0%
um I guess I could call it a sort of
 
05:18:12.890 --> 05:18:12.900 align:start position:0%
diploma Mill but for private
 
05:18:12.900 --> 05:18:15.470 align:start position:0%
diploma Mill but for private
certifications

05:18:15.470 --> 05:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:17.390 --> 05:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
um lastly I just want to point out that
 
05:18:19.670 --> 05:18:19.680 align:start position:0%
the truck driver example
 
05:18:23.690 --> 05:18:23.700 align:start position:0%
um I believe this is a change to RSA 332
 
05:18:23.700 --> 05:18:25.670 align:start position:0%
um I believe this is a change to RSA 332
G14

05:18:25.670 --> 05:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
G14
 
05:18:29.750 --> 05:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
um RSA chapter 332g applies only to
 
05:18:33.110 --> 05:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
title 30 of the rsas
 
05:18:34.850 --> 05:18:34.860 align:start position:0%
um so it's only the professions that
 
05:18:37.550 --> 05:18:37.560 align:start position:0%
where their practice acts excuse me
 
05:18:41.090 --> 05:18:41.100 align:start position:0%
practice practice acts uh are located in
 
05:18:43.368 --> 05:18:43.378 align:start position:0%
title 30. I don't believe truck drivers
 
05:18:44.570 --> 05:18:44.580 align:start position:0%
are in there
 
05:18:47.330 --> 05:18:47.340 align:start position:0%
um I think 95 of oplc boards are in
 
05:18:49.430 --> 05:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
there a few are not
 
05:18:51.890 --> 05:18:51.900 align:start position:0%
um and then there's a few oplc boards
 
05:18:54.350 --> 05:18:54.360 align:start position:0%
that are in other provisions of of the
 
05:18:54.360 --> 05:18:56.150 align:start position:0%
that are in other provisions of of the
rsas

05:18:56.150 --> 05:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
rsas
 
05:18:58.368 --> 05:18:58.378 align:start position:0%
um I don't have any more testimony I
 
05:18:59.810 --> 05:18:59.820 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time I'm happy to
 
05:19:01.128 --> 05:19:01.138 align:start position:0%
take any questions
 
05:19:03.948 --> 05:19:03.958 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Brown uh representative
 
05:19:03.958 --> 05:19:05.990 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Brown uh representative
Pearson

05:19:05.990 --> 05:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
Pearson
 
05:19:08.090 --> 05:19:08.100 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:19:11.930 --> 05:19:11.940 align:start position:0%
I'm going to start by saying uh not I
 
05:19:13.570 --> 05:19:13.580 align:start position:0%
don't have an opinion on this bill yet
 
05:19:15.770 --> 05:19:15.780 align:start position:0%
but the
 
05:19:18.770 --> 05:19:18.780 align:start position:0%
Mr Roderick the more you spoke the more
 
05:19:18.780 --> 05:19:20.350 align:start position:0%
Mr Roderick the more you spoke the more
questions

05:19:20.350 --> 05:19:20.360 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:19:22.990 --> 05:19:23.000 align:start position:0%
I have
 
05:19:26.150 --> 05:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
you talked about on specifically page
 
05:19:29.510 --> 05:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
124 lines 24 of that section and you
 
05:19:32.390 --> 05:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
talked about the conflict with RSA 541a
 
05:19:38.690 --> 05:19:38.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:40.910 --> 05:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
there are there are other areas in
 
05:19:42.830 --> 05:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
statute that have time frames like that
 
05:19:46.190 --> 05:19:46.200 align:start position:0%
and typically what it's done is that you
 
05:19:49.010 --> 05:19:49.020 align:start position:0%
know you are required to to do something
 
05:19:51.470 --> 05:19:51.480 align:start position:0%
within the 60 days and typically that's
 
05:19:54.708 --> 05:19:54.718 align:start position:0%
just a rule they rejected to give
 
05:19:56.448 --> 05:19:56.458 align:start position:0%
themselves an extension
 
05:19:56.458 --> 05:19:58.750 align:start position:0%
themselves an extension
so

05:19:58.750 --> 05:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:20:02.628 --> 05:20:02.638 align:start position:0%
is that an Avenue that can be done
 
05:20:06.050 --> 05:20:06.060 align:start position:0%
as to alleviate the concern of that 60
 
05:20:09.110 --> 05:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
days when it comes to folks that have a
 
05:20:13.430 --> 05:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:15.410 --> 05:20:15.420 align:start position:0%
would you believe that that issue could
 
05:20:17.208 --> 05:20:17.218 align:start position:0%
be resolved by adding
 
05:20:17.218 --> 05:20:18.170 align:start position:0%
be resolved by adding
um

05:20:18.170 --> 05:20:18.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:20:22.250 --> 05:20:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:22.260 --> 05:20:23.510 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:20:23.510 --> 05:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:20:27.530 --> 05:20:27.540 align:start position:0%
beginning of that sentence line 26 uh
 
05:20:29.990 --> 05:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
before if an applicant if you could say
 
05:20:34.970 --> 05:20:34.980 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding RSA 541a 29a that would
 
05:20:34.980 --> 05:20:36.170 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding RSA 541a 29a that would
alleviate

05:20:36.170 --> 05:20:36.180 align:start position:0%
alleviate
 
05:20:43.190 --> 05:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:45.708 --> 05:20:45.718 align:start position:0%
okay the other part the other question I
 
05:20:47.030 --> 05:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
have is there's something you just
 
05:20:48.830 --> 05:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
talked about here on on page two at the
 
05:20:51.350 --> 05:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
bottom of the private certifications
 
05:20:54.288 --> 05:20:54.298 align:start position:0%
uh I I agree I very much agree with your
 
05:20:57.288 --> 05:20:57.298 align:start position:0%
assessment of of what what a private
 
05:20:57.298 --> 05:20:59.050 align:start position:0%
assessment of of what what a private
certification

05:20:59.050 --> 05:20:59.060 align:start position:0%
certification
 
05:21:02.930 --> 05:21:02.940 align:start position:0%
actually truly is do you at the current
 
05:21:06.530 --> 05:21:06.540 align:start position:0%
time does the oplc have a
 
05:21:11.030 --> 05:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
list a database an idea as to what
 
05:21:13.430 --> 05:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
private certification organizations are
 
05:21:16.910 --> 05:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
accepted by the otlc versus ones that
 
05:21:20.150 --> 05:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:20.160 --> 05:21:20.930 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:21:20.930 --> 05:21:20.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:20.940 --> 05:21:23.208 align:start position:0%
um
so

05:21:23.208 --> 05:21:23.218 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:21:27.070 --> 05:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
right now uh right now oplc we we can't
 
05:21:30.470 --> 05:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
we can't issue a license on the basis of
 
05:21:33.110 --> 05:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
a certification only I guess what I
 
05:21:34.550 --> 05:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
meant by that is
 
05:21:34.560 --> 05:21:35.510 align:start position:0%
meant by that is
um

05:21:35.510 --> 05:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:38.868 --> 05:21:38.878 align:start position:0%
some boards in their practice acts uh
 
05:21:41.090 --> 05:21:41.100 align:start position:0%
specifically say
 
05:21:43.788 --> 05:21:43.798 align:start position:0%
um like for instance the speech language
 
05:21:45.708 --> 05:21:45.718 align:start position:0%
pathology board
 
05:21:47.570 --> 05:21:47.580 align:start position:0%
um says one of their requirements for
 
05:21:50.270 --> 05:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
licensure is it that you have
 
05:21:52.788 --> 05:21:52.798 align:start position:0%
certification from Asha which is the
 
05:21:56.270 --> 05:21:56.280 align:start position:0%
association of speech hearing I'm
 
05:21:58.250 --> 05:21:58.260 align:start position:0%
butchering it but
 
05:22:00.470 --> 05:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
um an outside certifying body it's a
 
05:22:02.930 --> 05:22:02.940 align:start position:0%
national body there is a way around that
 
05:22:05.208 --> 05:22:05.218 align:start position:0%
you can if you're not a member of Asha
 
05:22:07.550 --> 05:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
you can take another route but so
 
05:22:09.350 --> 05:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
there's examples where it's in statutes
 
05:22:11.990 --> 05:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
there's also examples where boards
 
05:22:14.330 --> 05:22:14.340 align:start position:0%
through rules have said
 
05:22:16.970 --> 05:22:16.980 align:start position:0%
um as proof of your educational
 
05:22:19.628 --> 05:22:19.638 align:start position:0%
experience and experience we will accept
 
05:22:23.448 --> 05:22:23.458 align:start position:0%
your membership into
 
05:22:24.890 --> 05:22:24.900 align:start position:0%
um X
 
05:22:27.830 --> 05:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
certifying organization
 
05:22:30.530 --> 05:22:30.540 align:start position:0%
I I don't have a comprehensive list it
 
05:22:32.868 --> 05:22:32.878 align:start position:0%
would be in all the board statues it
 
05:22:35.150 --> 05:22:35.160 align:start position:0%
would be board specific and you'd go in
 
05:22:37.368 --> 05:22:37.378 align:start position:0%
the board statutes and rules so what a
 
05:22:40.010 --> 05:22:40.020 align:start position:0%
fix to this then necessarily work if it
 
05:22:41.570 --> 05:22:41.580 align:start position:0%
said a private certification
 
05:22:48.470 --> 05:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:48.480 --> 05:22:50.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:22:50.030 --> 05:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:52.550 --> 05:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
that way those that are not recognized
 
05:22:56.570 --> 05:22:56.580 align:start position:0%
are are not deemed applicable in those
 
05:22:58.610 --> 05:22:58.620 align:start position:0%
that the oplc has already vetted and
 
05:23:00.830 --> 05:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
said yes we do recognize that this
 
05:23:02.570 --> 05:23:02.580 align:start position:0%
private certification organization does
 
05:23:04.368 --> 05:23:04.378 align:start position:0%
bring something of value to the table
 
05:23:07.628 --> 05:23:07.638 align:start position:0%
and and we hold that certification
 
05:23:10.970 --> 05:23:10.980 align:start position:0%
as being something of validity for what
 
05:23:14.230 --> 05:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
you know for moving forward
 
05:23:16.730 --> 05:23:16.740 align:start position:0%
that would alleviate some of the
 
05:23:18.948 --> 05:23:18.958 align:start position:0%
concerns I I can't speak for the boards
 
05:23:20.390 --> 05:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
as I had said in the beginning I mean
 
05:23:23.510 --> 05:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
the boards of the the experts on the
 
05:23:24.890 --> 05:23:24.900 align:start position:0%
profession rather than the
 
05:23:24.900 --> 05:23:26.448 align:start position:0%
profession rather than the
administration

05:23:26.448 --> 05:23:26.458 align:start position:0%
administration
 
05:23:28.490 --> 05:23:28.500 align:start position:0%
um so we would have to be doing that in
 
05:23:30.708 --> 05:23:30.718 align:start position:0%
consultation with the boards
 
05:23:30.718 --> 05:23:32.390 align:start position:0%
consultation with the boards
um

05:23:32.390 --> 05:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:35.150 --> 05:23:35.160 align:start position:0%
so that would require oplc keeping a
 
05:23:37.250 --> 05:23:37.260 align:start position:0%
list of what would be acceptable what
 
05:23:39.650 --> 05:23:39.660 align:start position:0%
certifying body would be acceptable for
 
05:23:42.470 --> 05:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
each profession
 
05:23:44.270 --> 05:23:44.280 align:start position:0%
and the boards would have to determine
 
05:23:47.510 --> 05:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
within each board what they I understand
 
05:23:50.270 --> 05:23:50.280 align:start position:0%
your management part of it each of the
 
05:23:53.570 --> 05:23:53.580 align:start position:0%
of the 54 boards would have to
 
05:23:56.270 --> 05:23:56.280 align:start position:0%
decide as a board what they would accept
 
05:23:59.270 --> 05:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
as a private certification or not
 
05:24:02.030 --> 05:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
correct correct if if the legislature
 
05:24:03.410 --> 05:24:03.420 align:start position:0%
were going to go that way I would
 
05:24:03.420 --> 05:24:04.490 align:start position:0%
were going to go that way I would
suggest

05:24:04.490 --> 05:24:04.500 align:start position:0%
suggest
 
05:24:06.170 --> 05:24:06.180 align:start position:0%
um that that decision should be made by
 
05:24:08.690 --> 05:24:08.700 align:start position:0%
the boards as they are the experts in in
 
05:24:13.190 --> 05:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:13.200 --> 05:24:17.448 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:24:17.448 --> 05:24:17.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:19.430 --> 05:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
05:24:22.250 --> 05:24:22.260 align:start position:0%
um good afternoon Mr Broderick
 
05:24:24.948 --> 05:24:24.958 align:start position:0%
um I'm curious
 
05:24:28.490 --> 05:24:28.500 align:start position:0%
um if this bill were to pass would you
 
05:24:31.490 --> 05:24:31.500 align:start position:0%
say that this would
 
05:24:36.288 --> 05:24:36.298 align:start position:0%
um be much more burdensome time wise to
 
05:24:39.708 --> 05:24:39.718 align:start position:0%
the various Boards of oplc then your
 
05:24:45.948 --> 05:24:45.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:45.958 --> 05:24:47.510 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:24:47.510 --> 05:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:49.670 --> 05:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
well I would
 
05:24:52.070 --> 05:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
I I'm not exactly sure how to answer
 
05:24:55.310 --> 05:24:55.320 align:start position:0%
that it it would add two more as I read
 
05:24:57.050 --> 05:24:57.060 align:start position:0%
it two more
 
05:24:59.990 --> 05:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
um avenues for reciprocal licensing
 
05:25:02.330 --> 05:25:02.340 align:start position:0%
um and uh
 
05:25:04.610 --> 05:25:04.620 align:start position:0%
right now I don't know if this is
 
05:25:06.410 --> 05:25:06.420 align:start position:0%
answering your question so I'm I'm sorry
 
05:25:08.330 --> 05:25:08.340 align:start position:0%
if it's not right now there are many
 
05:25:10.490 --> 05:25:10.500 align:start position:0%
avenues for reciprocal licensing but a
 
05:25:11.810 --> 05:25:11.820 align:start position:0%
lot of it depends on which board they're
 
05:25:13.190 --> 05:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
applying for
 
05:25:16.190 --> 05:25:16.200 align:start position:0%
um personally I you know I would love to
 
05:25:18.830 --> 05:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
see some sort of standardization
 
05:25:22.010 --> 05:25:22.020 align:start position:0%
um so that there's uh more similarity
 
05:25:24.010 --> 05:25:24.020 align:start position:0%
process between all the boards
 
05:25:26.868 --> 05:25:26.878 align:start position:0%
this doesn't get rid of any extraneous
 
05:25:29.448 --> 05:25:29.458 align:start position:0%
processes it just adds two more so I I
 
05:25:35.810 --> 05:25:35.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:37.730 --> 05:25:37.740 align:start position:0%
answers my question thank you
 
05:25:37.740 --> 05:25:43.368 align:start position:0%
answers my question thank you
representative

05:25:43.368 --> 05:25:43.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:45.708 --> 05:25:45.718 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
05:25:48.170 --> 05:25:48.180 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr Broderick
 
05:25:49.730 --> 05:25:49.740 align:start position:0%
um I
 
05:25:52.250 --> 05:25:52.260 align:start position:0%
um am concerned about this bill because
 
05:25:56.330 --> 05:25:56.340 align:start position:0%
I think that to give wide life you know
 
05:25:59.868 --> 05:25:59.878 align:start position:0%
expand the licensing in this manner may
 
05:26:02.770 --> 05:26:02.780 align:start position:0%
have unintended consequences based on
 
05:26:06.890 --> 05:26:06.900 align:start position:0%
the profession that's involved and our
 
05:26:06.900 --> 05:26:08.208 align:start position:0%
the profession that's involved and our
current

05:26:08.208 --> 05:26:08.218 align:start position:0%
current
 
05:26:10.610 --> 05:26:10.620 align:start position:0%
the way we currently do this now in my
 
05:26:13.310 --> 05:26:13.320 align:start position:0%
limited experience with Edna has been to
 
05:26:16.490 --> 05:26:16.500 align:start position:0%
address reciprocity on a professional on
 
05:26:18.650 --> 05:26:18.660 align:start position:0%
a profession basis with this with a
 
05:26:19.850 --> 05:26:19.860 align:start position:0%
certain board
 
05:26:22.310 --> 05:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
because at that time the boy can decide
 
05:26:23.628 --> 05:26:23.638 align:start position:0%
for itself what they're going to
 
05:26:25.610 --> 05:26:25.620 align:start position:0%
recognize that as the qualification
 
05:26:30.350 --> 05:26:30.360 align:start position:0%
whether it be private certification or
 
05:26:32.990 --> 05:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
um work experience
 
05:26:37.368 --> 05:26:37.378 align:start position:0%
so how and and so my question to you is
 
05:26:39.948 --> 05:26:39.958 align:start position:0%
is that not
 
05:26:42.170 --> 05:26:42.180 align:start position:0%
um from an opioids oplc management
 
05:26:43.850 --> 05:26:43.860 align:start position:0%
standpoint considering your position
 
05:26:47.270 --> 05:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
versus the Board is it not easier and
 
05:26:49.490 --> 05:26:49.500 align:start position:0%
more unless
 
05:26:49.500 --> 05:26:50.750 align:start position:0%
more unless
um

05:26:50.750 --> 05:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:53.448 --> 05:26:53.458 align:start position:0%
and a path of having less unattended
 
05:26:55.730 --> 05:26:55.740 align:start position:0%
consequences to continue in the way this
 
05:26:59.990 --> 05:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
this has addressed reciprocity
 
05:27:03.590 --> 05:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
the board themselves and the profession
 
05:27:03.600 --> 05:27:04.690 align:start position:0%
the board themselves and the profession
um

05:27:04.690 --> 05:27:04.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:08.390 --> 05:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
yes I mean to your point and I I think
 
05:27:10.990 --> 05:27:11.000 align:start position:0%
rewarding a point from pre
 
05:27:14.570 --> 05:27:14.580 align:start position:0%
repoint previous excuse me a point I
 
05:27:17.410 --> 05:27:17.420 align:start position:0%
made previously the uh you know we
 
05:27:19.970 --> 05:27:19.980 align:start position:0%
licensed 54 different professions they
 
05:27:22.730 --> 05:27:22.740 align:start position:0%
all have and I know bits and pieces of
 
05:27:25.670 --> 05:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
each profession and so do the staff that
 
05:27:29.410 --> 05:27:29.420 align:start position:0%
work here but there's no way we know
 
05:27:32.510 --> 05:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
there's a reason why we have uh
 
05:27:34.850 --> 05:27:34.860 align:start position:0%
people in the profession on these boards
 
05:27:37.190 --> 05:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
and that is to determine matters like
 
05:27:39.350 --> 05:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
this uh yeah
 
05:27:40.850 --> 05:27:40.860 align:start position:0%
thank you I think you've answered my
 
05:27:42.948 --> 05:27:42.958 align:start position:0%
question I appreciate it thank you
 
05:27:46.670 --> 05:27:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:48.650 --> 05:27:48.660 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you Mr
 
05:27:51.230 --> 05:27:51.240 align:start position:0%
Broderick for taking my question
 
05:27:54.830 --> 05:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
uh and looking at this uh
 
05:27:58.430 --> 05:27:58.440 align:start position:0%
says any person shall have uh worked for
 
05:28:00.050 --> 05:28:00.060 align:start position:0%
at least three years in a lawful
 
05:28:00.060 --> 05:28:01.490 align:start position:0%
at least three years in a lawful
occupation

05:28:01.490 --> 05:28:01.500 align:start position:0%
occupation
 
05:28:03.530 --> 05:28:03.540 align:start position:0%
doesn't say the number of hours in the
 
05:28:06.110 --> 05:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
year it just says three years could
 
05:28:08.628 --> 05:28:08.638 align:start position:0%
three years be I worked one week each
 
05:28:11.690 --> 05:28:11.700 align:start position:0%
year and that's classified as I was
 
05:28:15.650 --> 05:28:15.660 align:start position:0%
doing the occupation for three years
 
05:28:17.510 --> 05:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
um yes
 
05:28:19.190 --> 05:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean that would be another issue
 
05:28:19.200 --> 05:28:20.628 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean that would be another issue
here

05:28:20.628 --> 05:28:20.638 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:28:22.970 --> 05:28:22.980 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
05:28:22.980 --> 05:28:25.490 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
Schmidt

05:28:25.490 --> 05:28:25.500 align:start position:0%
Schmidt
 
05:28:28.970 --> 05:28:28.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:32.208 --> 05:28:32.218 align:start position:0%
turn on my lights so Tom can see me
 
05:28:35.810 --> 05:28:35.820 align:start position:0%
um so this strikes me as a rowboat with
 
05:28:38.090 --> 05:28:38.100 align:start position:0%
a lot of little leaks in it
 
05:28:43.128 --> 05:28:43.138 align:start position:0%
um but uh the question I have is uh do
 
05:28:46.070 --> 05:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
we have a flood of people coming in from
 
05:28:50.208 --> 05:28:50.218 align:start position:0%
uh surrounding areas or wherever uh
 
05:28:54.670 --> 05:28:54.680 align:start position:0%
seeking Licensing in the in the areas
 
05:28:57.708 --> 05:28:57.718 align:start position:0%
that this bill addresses
 
05:29:00.470 --> 05:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
and what can you comment on whether we
 
05:29:02.510 --> 05:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
have whether we actually would be
 
05:29:05.690 --> 05:29:05.700 align:start position:0%
justified in fixing all each one of
 
05:29:08.390 --> 05:29:08.400 align:start position:0%
these little leaks uh or any of the
 
05:29:11.208 --> 05:29:11.218 align:start position:0%
Little leaks for that matter uh with the
 
05:29:12.650 --> 05:29:12.660 align:start position:0%
staff that you time that you have
 
05:29:12.660 --> 05:29:13.510 align:start position:0%
staff that you time that you have
available

05:29:13.510 --> 05:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
available
 
05:29:18.590 --> 05:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
uh to to meet uh the needs of people who
 
05:29:21.230 --> 05:29:21.240 align:start position:0%
want to come here and work
 
05:29:23.628 --> 05:29:23.638 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Schmidt um
 
05:29:26.990 --> 05:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
I unfortunately I may need to have to
 
05:29:28.850 --> 05:29:28.860 align:start position:0%
get back to you as legal counsel I don't
 
05:29:32.030 --> 05:29:32.040 align:start position:0%
see uh the everyday requests that are
 
05:29:33.830 --> 05:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
coming in for reciprocity I would
 
05:29:34.670 --> 05:29:34.680 align:start position:0%
probably have to check with our
 
05:29:36.470 --> 05:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
administrative team
 
05:29:36.480 --> 05:29:37.930 align:start position:0%
administrative team
um

05:29:37.930 --> 05:29:37.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:40.730 --> 05:29:40.740 align:start position:0%
so I'm happy to get back
 
05:29:42.590 --> 05:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
to you with something in writing I I
 
05:29:45.230 --> 05:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
will know I mean the with the amount of
 
05:29:47.448 --> 05:29:47.458 align:start position:0%
emergency licenses Etc that we're
 
05:29:49.070 --> 05:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
issuing under
 
05:29:51.590 --> 05:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
um covid and the extra pandemic work we
 
05:29:53.930 --> 05:29:53.940 align:start position:0%
are stretched pretty thin but
 
05:29:57.708 --> 05:29:57.718 align:start position:0%
um to your specific question of how
 
05:30:01.070 --> 05:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
um how many individuals this would uh
 
05:30:04.070 --> 05:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
help I'm happy to talk with my executive
 
05:30:06.770 --> 05:30:06.780 align:start position:0%
director and more the administrative arm
 
05:30:09.650 --> 05:30:09.660 align:start position:0%
and get some of that for you
 
05:30:12.410 --> 05:30:12.420 align:start position:0%
uh follow-up follow-up
 
05:30:15.830 --> 05:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
so you have I mean you you've got enough
 
05:30:18.530 --> 05:30:18.540 align:start position:0%
work to to fill out your day I'm sure
 
05:30:21.288 --> 05:30:21.298 align:start position:0%
and just all the aspects that you've
 
05:30:24.590 --> 05:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
addressed in in this bill show uh a
 
05:30:28.550 --> 05:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
command of the uh the the subject
 
05:30:30.650 --> 05:30:30.660 align:start position:0%
material that you deal with on a regular
 
05:30:33.530 --> 05:30:33.540 align:start position:0%
basis uh because as I said this is a
 
05:30:35.810 --> 05:30:35.820 align:start position:0%
book with a lot of little leaks
 
05:30:41.030 --> 05:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
um and ultimately uh it it all has to be
 
05:30:44.890 --> 05:30:44.900 align:start position:0%
fixed because we we can't have
 
05:30:47.590 --> 05:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
half of it and and not the other half
 
05:30:50.030 --> 05:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
that that's not the kind of Bill we want
 
05:30:54.230 --> 05:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
to pass in this committee so uh I I'm
 
05:30:56.330 --> 05:30:56.340 align:start position:0%
not sure how quickly we have to act on
 
05:30:58.490 --> 05:30:58.500 align:start position:0%
the bill uh the chair can speak to that
 
05:31:01.448 --> 05:31:01.458 align:start position:0%
but but uh as I say
 
05:31:04.190 --> 05:31:04.200 align:start position:0%
this is a it would be a lot of work for
 
05:31:09.530 --> 05:31:09.540 align:start position:0%
the agency to uh to to get at if
 
05:31:13.368 --> 05:31:13.378 align:start position:0%
there's not a lot of people uh waiting
 
05:31:15.890 --> 05:31:15.900 align:start position:0%
in any one of these professions to come
 
05:31:17.810 --> 05:31:17.820 align:start position:0%
into New Hampshire from surrounding
 
05:31:17.820 --> 05:31:19.368 align:start position:0%
into New Hampshire from surrounding
areas

05:31:19.368 --> 05:31:19.378 align:start position:0%
areas
 
05:31:21.830 --> 05:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
um so I think I think it needs a lot
 
05:31:23.868 --> 05:31:23.878 align:start position:0%
more work before we could think of
 
05:31:27.948 --> 05:31:27.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:30.350 --> 05:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
I have a question Mr Broderick that you
 
05:31:32.208 --> 05:31:32.218 align:start position:0%
I hope you would look into
 
05:31:36.128 --> 05:31:36.138 align:start position:0%
sure some years ago we passed a
 
05:31:40.250 --> 05:31:40.260 align:start position:0%
requirement that asked the boards to
 
05:31:44.110 --> 05:31:44.120 align:start position:0%
post what states had equivalent
 
05:31:46.368 --> 05:31:46.378 align:start position:0%
requirements because most of the
 
05:31:48.050 --> 05:31:48.060 align:start position:0%
practice acts say that they shall
 
05:31:50.510 --> 05:31:50.520 align:start position:0%
license people from states with
 
05:31:54.410 --> 05:31:54.420 align:start position:0%
equivalent requirements and at
 
05:31:58.190 --> 05:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
two years after that law passed I had I
 
05:32:02.510 --> 05:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
saw no such listings and I would hope
 
05:32:06.110 --> 05:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
that if you could find out if any of the
 
05:32:08.810 --> 05:32:08.820 align:start position:0%
boards have bothered to put up
 
05:32:08.820 --> 05:32:10.610 align:start position:0%
boards have bothered to put up
say

05:32:10.610 --> 05:32:10.620 align:start position:0%
say
 
05:32:13.250 --> 05:32:13.260 align:start position:0%
the state of Massachusetts is fine the
 
05:32:16.010 --> 05:32:16.020 align:start position:0%
state of Maine is inadequate because of
 
05:32:18.288 --> 05:32:18.298 align:start position:0%
this or whatever
 
05:32:21.288 --> 05:32:21.298 align:start position:0%
the the issue is because that sort of
 
05:32:24.050 --> 05:32:24.060 align:start position:0%
information that the board should know
 
05:32:27.470 --> 05:32:27.480 align:start position:0%
from the licenses that and request for
 
05:32:30.170 --> 05:32:30.180 align:start position:0%
reciprocity that they received and they
 
05:32:31.610 --> 05:32:31.620 align:start position:0%
should make it public
 
05:32:34.010 --> 05:32:34.020 align:start position:0%
so I hope it could you find out which if
 
05:32:36.590 --> 05:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
any boards have done something like that
 
05:32:39.770 --> 05:32:39.780 align:start position:0%
sure I do know that our boards have a I
 
05:32:42.170 --> 05:32:42.180 align:start position:0%
think each board has a like reciprocity
 
05:32:45.170 --> 05:32:45.180 align:start position:0%
tab on our website but
 
05:32:48.230 --> 05:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
um I can find out what's posted on that
 
05:32:48.240 --> 05:32:49.788 align:start position:0%
um I can find out what's posted on that
tab

05:32:49.788 --> 05:32:49.798 align:start position:0%
tab
 
05:32:52.670 --> 05:32:52.680 align:start position:0%
um and yes I can get that information
 
05:32:54.770 --> 05:32:54.780 align:start position:0%
thank you and I would mention that I
 
05:32:57.530 --> 05:32:57.540 align:start position:0%
know someone from Washington State
 
05:33:00.530 --> 05:33:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:02.770 --> 05:33:02.780 align:start position:0%
is a licensed electrician in Washington
 
05:33:06.170 --> 05:33:06.180 align:start position:0%
and he had the requisite apprenticeship
 
05:33:08.930 --> 05:33:08.940 align:start position:0%
including 8 000 hours of supervised
 
05:33:11.030 --> 05:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
practice which is the same requirement
 
05:33:14.270 --> 05:33:14.280 align:start position:0%
we have here and he was told that if you
 
05:33:16.190 --> 05:33:16.200 align:start position:0%
were to come to New Hampshire you would
 
05:33:18.230 --> 05:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
have to repeat that eight thousand
 
05:33:20.330 --> 05:33:20.340 align:start position:0%
dollars rather than being able to
 
05:33:23.270 --> 05:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
transfer his journeyman's license
 
05:33:26.628 --> 05:33:26.638 align:start position:0%
and that's something that is totally
 
05:33:30.170 --> 05:33:30.180 align:start position:0%
unacceptable as far as I'm concerned
 
05:33:33.350 --> 05:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
of course that's third hand verbal I
 
05:33:35.150 --> 05:33:35.160 align:start position:0%
didn't speak to the electricians board
 
05:33:37.128 --> 05:33:37.138 align:start position:0%
myself but if
 
05:33:39.050 --> 05:33:39.060 align:start position:0%
if that's the kind of response we're
 
05:33:41.150 --> 05:33:41.160 align:start position:0%
giving to people who are thinking of
 
05:33:43.850 --> 05:33:43.860 align:start position:0%
moving to this area and they call up the
 
05:33:45.470 --> 05:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
board and say hey I'm a licensed
 
05:33:47.270 --> 05:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
electrician what do I need to do to get
 
05:33:49.730 --> 05:33:49.740 align:start position:0%
a license and they're told they have to
 
05:33:53.470 --> 05:33:53.480 align:start position:0%
start 40 four or five years back
 
05:33:56.510 --> 05:33:56.520 align:start position:0%
that's a very bad problem we have and
 
05:33:58.128 --> 05:33:58.138 align:start position:0%
I'm sure this bill is intended to
 
05:34:00.170 --> 05:34:00.180 align:start position:0%
address that
 
05:34:02.208 --> 05:34:02.218 align:start position:0%
end of speech
 
05:34:04.310 --> 05:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
all right are there any other questions
 
05:34:07.128 --> 05:34:07.138 align:start position:0%
for Mr Broderick
 
05:34:09.170 --> 05:34:09.180 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none is there anyone else
 
05:34:15.708 --> 05:34:15.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:17.270 --> 05:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you Mr
 
05:34:19.910 --> 05:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
Broderick and uh
 
05:34:31.208 --> 05:34:31.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:36.948 --> 05:34:36.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:38.570 --> 05:34:38.580 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:34:38.580 --> 05:34:39.590 align:start position:0%
all right
um

05:34:39.590 --> 05:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:41.930 --> 05:34:41.940 align:start position:0%
it is
 
05:34:44.990 --> 05:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
3 35. I think we will take a 10 minute
 
05:34:47.208 --> 05:34:47.218 align:start position:0%
break and then come back and resume with
 
05:34:50.270 --> 05:34:50.280 align:start position:0%

05:34:52.490 --> 05:34:52.500 align:start position:0%

thank you all for lasting through a

day that's finished better than it
 
05:43:35.280 --> 05:43:38.030 align:start position:0%
day that's finished better than it
started

05:43:38.030 --> 05:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:42.948 --> 05:43:42.958 align:start position:0%
all right on House Bill 274.
 
05:43:42.958 --> 05:43:44.390 align:start position:0%
all right on House Bill 274.
we

05:43:44.390 --> 05:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
we
 
05:43:47.448 --> 05:43:47.458 align:start position:0%
amended it with
 
05:43:47.458 --> 05:43:48.830 align:start position:0%
amended it with
uh

05:43:48.830 --> 05:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:43:50.750 --> 05:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
representative of brahmi's amendment
 
05:43:54.590 --> 05:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
that clarified the fee section
 
05:43:57.470 --> 05:43:57.480 align:start position:0%
both representative blackis and
 
05:43:59.810 --> 05:43:59.820 align:start position:0%
representative schuette have submitted
 
05:44:04.070 --> 05:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
amendments where that part is identical
 
05:44:07.128 --> 05:44:07.138 align:start position:0%
the only question chair yes
 
05:44:10.190 --> 05:44:10.200 align:start position:0%
excuse me you mentioned House Bill 274
 
05:44:12.110 --> 05:44:12.120 align:start position:0%
believe you're referring to House Bill
 
05:44:12.120 --> 05:44:13.628 align:start position:0%
believe you're referring to House Bill
591

05:44:13.628 --> 05:44:13.638 align:start position:0%
591
 
05:44:16.610 --> 05:44:16.620 align:start position:0%
you are totally correct I apologize
 
05:44:19.850 --> 05:44:19.860 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely right house bill 591
 
05:44:21.770 --> 05:44:21.780 align:start position:0%
The Liquor Commission
 
05:44:24.890 --> 05:44:24.900 align:start position:0%
thank you the
 
05:44:27.288 --> 05:44:27.298 align:start position:0%
the difference between the amendment we
 
05:44:29.090 --> 05:44:29.100 align:start position:0%
have already adopted
 
05:44:31.128 --> 05:44:31.138 align:start position:0%
the shoe would have been and the Lexus
 
05:44:34.310 --> 05:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
Amendment it are only in the last
 
05:44:38.390 --> 05:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
section about the two positions so I
 
05:44:38.400 --> 05:44:40.190 align:start position:0%
section about the two positions so I
think

05:44:40.190 --> 05:44:40.200 align:start position:0%
think
 
05:44:43.430 --> 05:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
the simplest way to handle it will be to
 
05:44:46.010 --> 05:44:46.020 align:start position:0%
debate what we want to do with the two
 
05:44:48.170 --> 05:44:48.180 align:start position:0%
positions whether to delete them
 
05:44:51.470 --> 05:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
completely whether to leave them as our
 
05:44:55.128 --> 05:44:55.138 align:start position:0%
last amendment was as as examiners or
 
05:44:57.350 --> 05:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
change them as the Seward Amendment
 
05:44:59.868 --> 05:44:59.878 align:start position:0%
calls for into investigators
 
05:45:02.448 --> 05:45:02.458 align:start position:0%
and then
 
05:45:04.548 --> 05:45:04.558 align:start position:0%
pass the appropriate Amendment so that
 
05:45:08.510 --> 05:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:10.730 --> 05:45:10.740 align:start position:0%
Miss Sparling begged me to make sure we
 
05:45:13.788 --> 05:45:13.798 align:start position:0%
only passed one Amendment so I will I
 
05:45:16.430 --> 05:45:16.440 align:start position:0%
will do issue requests thank you very
 
05:45:16.440 --> 05:45:17.288 align:start position:0%
will do issue requests thank you very
much

05:45:17.288 --> 05:45:17.298 align:start position:0%
much
 
05:45:20.090 --> 05:45:20.100 align:start position:0%
of course that would mean you know
 
05:45:21.610 --> 05:45:21.620 align:start position:0%
unless you pass
 
05:45:25.190 --> 05:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
um0116 the abrami amendment you'd need
 
05:45:28.970 --> 05:45:28.980 align:start position:0%
to reconsider and and turn it down since
 
05:45:31.570 --> 05:45:31.580 align:start position:0%
you once you have
 
05:45:34.548 --> 05:45:34.558 align:start position:0%
decided what we want to do what we can
 
05:45:36.470 --> 05:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
make sure to adopt the amendment that
 
05:45:40.128 --> 05:45:40.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:40.138 --> 05:45:42.110 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:45:42.110 --> 05:45:42.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:45:42.120 --> 05:45:43.730 align:start position:0%
so
uh

05:45:43.730 --> 05:45:43.740 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:45:46.448 --> 05:45:46.458 align:start position:0%
under the circumstances I'd like to ask
 
05:45:49.490 --> 05:45:49.500 align:start position:0%
representative shuitt to briefly explain
 
05:45:53.390 --> 05:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
why she wants to change the examiners we
 
05:45:56.208 --> 05:45:56.218 align:start position:0%
had in our current Amendment
 
05:45:58.430 --> 05:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
to inspectors and then I'll ask
 
05:46:00.830 --> 05:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
representative leckis to explain why he
 
05:46:03.230 --> 05:46:03.240 align:start position:0%
wants to eliminate the positions and
 
05:46:05.930 --> 05:46:05.940 align:start position:0%
then open it up for debate
 
05:46:05.940 --> 05:46:07.070 align:start position:0%
then open it up for debate
okay

05:46:07.070 --> 05:46:07.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:46:10.970 --> 05:46:10.980 align:start position:0%
sounds like a plan okay I am go ahead
 
05:46:14.810 --> 05:46:14.820 align:start position:0%
I thank you madam chair uh yes I my
 
05:46:17.810 --> 05:46:17.820 align:start position:0%
amendment was drafted so that
 
05:46:17.820 --> 05:46:19.670 align:start position:0%
amendment was drafted so that
technically

05:46:19.670 --> 05:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
technically
 
05:46:22.250 --> 05:46:22.260 align:start position:0%
the amendment that the committee has
 
05:46:25.548 --> 05:46:25.558 align:start position:0%
already adopted which changed the fee
 
05:46:29.270 --> 05:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
structure would still be in place and
 
05:46:30.890 --> 05:46:30.900 align:start position:0%
basically putting it back to the
 
05:46:33.708 --> 05:46:33.718 align:start position:0%
original bill that called for to
 
05:46:33.718 --> 05:46:35.170 align:start position:0%
original bill that called for to
investigators

05:46:35.170 --> 05:46:35.180 align:start position:0%
investigators
 
05:46:38.708 --> 05:46:38.718 align:start position:0%
as folks may recall during the
 
05:46:42.288 --> 05:46:42.298 align:start position:0%
questioning of the chief of the
 
05:46:45.410 --> 05:46:45.420 align:start position:0%
inspection officers
 
05:46:48.410 --> 05:46:48.420 align:start position:0%
um he indicated that yes he could use
 
05:46:51.110 --> 05:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
two more investigators uh the numbers
 
05:46:53.810 --> 05:46:53.820 align:start position:0%
that they gave us uh the fact that there
 
05:46:55.990 --> 05:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
are approximately
 
05:46:59.150 --> 05:46:59.160 align:start position:0%
5600 facilities
 
05:47:03.230 --> 05:47:03.240 align:start position:0%
and with 15 investigators uh that looked
 
05:47:07.670 --> 05:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
about a ratio of one investigator for
 
05:47:07.680 --> 05:47:09.250 align:start position:0%
about a ratio of one investigator for
every

05:47:09.250 --> 05:47:09.260 align:start position:0%
every
 
05:47:14.690 --> 05:47:14.700 align:start position:0%
375 facilities which means that
 
05:47:17.690 --> 05:47:17.700 align:start position:0%
and ratio the investigators could
 
05:47:20.650 --> 05:47:20.660 align:start position:0%
probably get to one facility a year
 
05:47:23.690 --> 05:47:23.700 align:start position:0%
each facility once a year let me put it
 
05:47:25.010 --> 05:47:25.020 align:start position:0%
that way
 
05:47:29.750 --> 05:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
so it struck me that it was likely that
 
05:47:32.570 --> 05:47:32.580 align:start position:0%
um they could use two more investigators
 
05:47:36.350 --> 05:47:36.360 align:start position:0%
we heard that examiners if they found
 
05:47:36.360 --> 05:47:37.390 align:start position:0%
we heard that examiners if they found
something

05:47:37.390 --> 05:47:37.400 align:start position:0%
something
 
05:47:37.400 --> 05:47:39.190 align:start position:0%
something
egregious

05:47:39.190 --> 05:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
egregious
 
05:47:42.048 --> 05:47:42.058 align:start position:0%
would have to then call for an
 
05:47:45.470 --> 05:47:45.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer I hope that you have
 
05:47:49.910 --> 05:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
all seen the email from Lieutenant
 
05:47:54.830 --> 05:47:54.840 align:start position:0%
Morrison a former investigator
 
05:47:58.788 --> 05:47:58.798 align:start position:0%
um to the need for uh having an
 
05:48:02.030 --> 05:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
investigator rather than an examiner do
 
05:48:05.030 --> 05:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
this kind of work he felt that it would
 
05:48:07.730 --> 05:48:07.740 align:start position:0%
actually be more efficient
 
05:48:11.990 --> 05:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
and so on that basis that's why I am
 
05:48:14.690 --> 05:48:14.700 align:start position:0%
putting this amendment forward to put
 
05:48:17.270 --> 05:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
those two investigator positions back in
 
05:48:24.830 --> 05:48:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:26.690 --> 05:48:26.700 align:start position:0%
um yes I mean
 
05:48:29.810 --> 05:48:29.820 align:start position:0%
suffered from the changes of Licensing
 
05:48:32.208 --> 05:48:32.218 align:start position:0%
done in this build or may or may not be
 
05:48:34.250 --> 05:48:34.260 align:start position:0%
a need for either additional
 
05:48:37.490 --> 05:48:37.500 align:start position:0%
investigators or examiners
 
05:48:37.500 --> 05:48:38.330 align:start position:0%
investigators or examiners
um

05:48:38.330 --> 05:48:38.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:41.208 --> 05:48:41.218 align:start position:0%
I don't know that that should be dealt
 
05:48:43.128 --> 05:48:43.138 align:start position:0%
with in the same bill
 
05:48:46.610 --> 05:48:46.620 align:start position:0%
I think the most places that sell
 
05:48:48.410 --> 05:48:48.420 align:start position:0%
it looks like the effect of this would
 
05:48:51.048 --> 05:48:51.058 align:start position:0%
be to add some
 
05:48:55.010 --> 05:48:55.020 align:start position:0%
to have some places that sell alcohol
 
05:48:57.948 --> 05:48:57.958 align:start position:0%
be able to add tobacco a tobacco license
 
05:49:01.070 --> 05:49:01.080 align:start position:0%
at a reduced
 
05:49:01.080 --> 05:49:03.650 align:start position:0%
at a reduced
and

05:49:03.650 --> 05:49:03.660 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:49:07.150 --> 05:49:07.160 align:start position:0%
The Whipper tradition is already
 
05:49:09.770 --> 05:49:09.780 align:start position:0%
reviewing and inspecting the location
 
05:49:12.770 --> 05:49:12.780 align:start position:0%
that currently has a liquor license I
 
05:49:14.208 --> 05:49:14.218 align:start position:0%
don't see there would be significantly
 
05:49:18.650 --> 05:49:18.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:22.368 --> 05:49:22.378 align:start position:0%
um and so my Amendment would eliminate
 
05:49:24.948 --> 05:49:24.958 align:start position:0%
the positions would included neither and
 
05:49:29.690 --> 05:49:29.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:31.548 --> 05:49:31.558 align:start position:0%
to ask you a question
 
05:49:33.650 --> 05:49:33.660 align:start position:0%
and that is is it normal to include
 
05:49:36.048 --> 05:49:36.058 align:start position:0%
positions in statute or is that normally
 
05:49:38.270 --> 05:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
part of the budget submitted by the
 
05:49:38.280 --> 05:49:39.770 align:start position:0%
part of the budget submitted by the
governor

05:49:39.770 --> 05:49:39.780 align:start position:0%
governor
 
05:49:39.780 --> 05:49:43.190 align:start position:0%
governor
legislature

05:49:43.190 --> 05:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:45.070 --> 05:49:45.080 align:start position:0%
so it would not have to be done that way
 
05:49:47.390 --> 05:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
if the Liquor Commission felt that they
 
05:49:49.128 --> 05:49:49.138 align:start position:0%
needed more positions it could be done
 
05:49:51.770 --> 05:49:51.780 align:start position:0%
through the normal budget process and
 
05:49:53.510 --> 05:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
that's what I would suggest should be
 
05:49:56.448 --> 05:49:56.458 align:start position:0%
done including it kind of almost an
 
05:50:01.128 --> 05:50:01.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:01.138 --> 05:50:04.910 align:start position:0%
 
great

05:50:04.910 --> 05:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:06.910 --> 05:50:06.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative blackis that
 
05:50:09.410 --> 05:50:09.420 align:start position:0%
brings us the point of debating these
 
05:50:13.548 --> 05:50:13.558 align:start position:0%
positions of Representative Allegro I
 
05:50:16.368 --> 05:50:16.378 align:start position:0%
had a question that uh either of the
 
05:50:19.490 --> 05:50:19.500 align:start position:0%
amendment sponsors to answer I just want
 
05:50:21.650 --> 05:50:21.660 align:start position:0%
to be 100 clear on the role of
 
05:50:24.230 --> 05:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
investigators is it to make regular
 
05:50:26.750 --> 05:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
annual or semi-annual business or is it
 
05:50:28.970 --> 05:50:28.980 align:start position:0%
to investigate complaints and then I'll
 
05:50:32.150 --> 05:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
I may have to follow along please
 
05:50:36.230 --> 05:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:39.548 --> 05:50:39.558 align:start position:0%
the investigators they do both
 
05:50:41.948 --> 05:50:41.958 align:start position:0%
semi-regular visits
 
05:50:45.708 --> 05:50:45.718 align:start position:0%
and they also follow up to complaints
 
05:50:45.718 --> 05:50:47.110 align:start position:0%
and they also follow up to complaints
okay

05:50:47.110 --> 05:50:47.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:50:50.868 --> 05:50:50.878 align:start position:0%
so I was just wondering if the concerns
 
05:50:54.590 --> 05:50:54.600 align:start position:0%
about a ratio or a a once a year visit
 
05:50:54.600 --> 05:50:56.448 align:start position:0%
about a ratio or a a once a year visit
um

05:50:56.448 --> 05:50:56.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:51:00.288 --> 05:51:00.298 align:start position:0%
is is necessarily a concern because
 
05:51:00.298 --> 05:51:01.250 align:start position:0%
is is necessarily a concern because
um

05:51:01.250 --> 05:51:01.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:51:02.570 --> 05:51:02.580 align:start position:0%
you know that
 
05:51:05.690 --> 05:51:05.700 align:start position:0%
that's the ratio of investigators to
 
05:51:09.170 --> 05:51:09.180 align:start position:0%
total number of Institutions but
 
05:51:11.390 --> 05:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
not necessarily the ratio of
 
05:51:14.750 --> 05:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
investigators to Total business
 
05:51:20.150 --> 05:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:25.368 --> 05:51:25.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:25.378 --> 05:51:26.150 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:51:26.150 --> 05:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:51:28.670 --> 05:51:28.680 align:start position:0%
the more I hear about it the more I am
 
05:51:33.470 --> 05:51:33.480 align:start position:0%
confused because I have to apply uh
 
05:51:36.650 --> 05:51:36.660 align:start position:0%
Committee hearing discounts to some of
 
05:51:38.628 --> 05:51:38.638 align:start position:0%
the things that I hear
 
05:51:41.750 --> 05:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
I don't know how audits work I don't
 
05:51:43.730 --> 05:51:43.740 align:start position:0%
know what the investigators do or
 
05:51:46.970 --> 05:51:46.980 align:start position:0%
Auditors do uh I'm calling it orders or
 
05:51:50.150 --> 05:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
examiners even you know I have this
 
05:51:52.788 --> 05:51:52.798 align:start position:0%
conception that an examiner comes in
 
05:51:55.010 --> 05:51:55.020 align:start position:0%
most of the time it's a routine audit
 
05:51:56.390 --> 05:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
there's nothing I don't know even what
 
05:51:57.948 --> 05:51:57.958 align:start position:0%
they do they count liquor bottles do
 
05:51:59.448 --> 05:51:59.458 align:start position:0%
they look at receipts
 
05:52:01.310 --> 05:52:01.320 align:start position:0%
once in a while they're going to find
 
05:52:03.890 --> 05:52:03.900 align:start position:0%
somebody that's loading up their trunk
 
05:52:06.830 --> 05:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
or selling it or do and I'm all of a
 
05:52:06.840 --> 05:52:07.788 align:start position:0%
or selling it or do and I'm all of a
sudden

05:52:07.788 --> 05:52:07.798 align:start position:0%
sudden
 
05:52:10.250 --> 05:52:10.260 align:start position:0%
not understanding and not in a position
 
05:52:11.930 --> 05:52:11.940 align:start position:0%
to understand
 
05:52:14.570 --> 05:52:14.580 align:start position:0%
and what this says to me is this is not
 
05:52:17.030 --> 05:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
our area of expertise this may be a
 
05:52:20.030 --> 05:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
great idea but I don't know that I think
 
05:52:22.310 --> 05:52:22.320 align:start position:0%
this should be split off in Ways and
 
05:52:24.048 --> 05:52:24.058 align:start position:0%
Means ought to be looking at this
 
05:52:27.770 --> 05:52:27.780 align:start position:0%
because they deal with Liquors uh all
 
05:52:30.610 --> 05:52:30.620 align:start position:0%
the time I have liquor around Christmas
 
05:52:36.470 --> 05:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
so that's I I I it isn't that I'm a
 
05:52:40.010 --> 05:52:40.020 align:start position:0%
I'm opposed to this bill be that portion
 
05:52:42.830 --> 05:52:42.840 align:start position:0%
of the bill being here it may be a
 
05:52:45.350 --> 05:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
wonderful life I've said it
 
05:52:47.690 --> 05:52:47.700 align:start position:0%
okay I'm going to be calling on people
 
05:52:50.690 --> 05:52:50.700 align:start position:0%
in the order that they have not yet
 
05:52:55.070 --> 05:52:55.080 align:start position:0%
spoken today so representative Fontenot
 
05:52:58.850 --> 05:52:58.860 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh Madam chair
 
05:53:01.190 --> 05:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
um a short follow-up on representative
 
05:53:03.770 --> 05:53:03.780 align:start position:0%
scitec's point about the examiners I'm
 
05:53:05.448 --> 05:53:05.458 align:start position:0%
not sure
 
05:53:09.350 --> 05:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
um if the examiner position exists at at
 
05:53:10.490 --> 05:53:10.500 align:start position:0%
this point
 
05:53:12.708 --> 05:53:12.718 align:start position:0%
um or if the look commission at Liquor
 
05:53:15.010 --> 05:53:15.020 align:start position:0%
Commission has exclusively
 
05:53:18.110 --> 05:53:18.120 align:start position:0%
investigators and and that it was this
 
05:53:21.170 --> 05:53:21.180 align:start position:0%
bill that was going to then create these
 
05:53:24.830 --> 05:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
two examiner uh positions and and if
 
05:53:28.788 --> 05:53:28.798 align:start position:0%
those positions are adequately defined
 
05:53:33.010 --> 05:53:33.020 align:start position:0%
I don't recall that testimony
 
05:53:39.530 --> 05:53:39.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:42.410 --> 05:53:42.420 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and I too am I
 
05:53:44.390 --> 05:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
will support uh representative schwart's
 
05:53:46.490 --> 05:53:46.500 align:start position:0%
Amendment for
 
05:53:49.128 --> 05:53:49.138 align:start position:0%
the investigators the original bill was
 
05:53:51.530 --> 05:53:51.540 align:start position:0%
for investigators not sure I think
 
05:53:53.810 --> 05:53:53.820 align:start position:0%
whether it was just cost savings uh
 
05:53:55.548 --> 05:53:55.558 align:start position:0%
looking to get positions to go to
 
05:53:59.330 --> 05:53:59.340 align:start position:0%
examiners but also want to just remind
 
05:54:01.430 --> 05:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
folks that during the testimony we did
 
05:54:03.708 --> 05:54:03.718 align:start position:0%
here from
 
05:54:07.128 --> 05:54:07.138 align:start position:0%
the department that uh businesses out
 
05:54:07.138 --> 05:54:08.810 align:start position:0%
the department that uh businesses out
there

05:54:08.810 --> 05:54:08.820 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:54:11.150 --> 05:54:11.160 align:start position:0%
the feedback from them on the uh
 
05:54:12.708 --> 05:54:12.718 align:start position:0%
individuals going in and helping out in
 
05:54:16.250 --> 05:54:16.260 align:start position:0%
the workplace uh with uh rules and laws
 
05:54:18.288 --> 05:54:18.298 align:start position:0%
and regulations was positive and that
 
05:54:19.910 --> 05:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
they were receiving positive feedback on
 
05:54:26.090 --> 05:54:26.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:30.890 --> 05:54:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:33.350 --> 05:54:33.360 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so I have a being
 
05:54:35.750 --> 05:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
neither a smoker nor a drinker I haven't
 
05:54:37.490 --> 05:54:37.500 align:start position:0%
been in the New Hampshire liquor store
 
05:54:40.730 --> 05:54:40.740 align:start position:0%
or any liquor store for I don't know a
 
05:54:42.470 --> 05:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
couple of years
 
05:54:46.970 --> 05:54:46.980 align:start position:0%
um uh so my first question is excuse me
 
05:54:49.310 --> 05:54:49.320 align:start position:0%
do the investigators
 
05:54:53.090 --> 05:54:53.100 align:start position:0%
uh can they deal with cigarette issues
 
05:54:55.010 --> 05:54:55.020 align:start position:0%
or tobacco issues as well as liquor
 
05:54:58.730 --> 05:54:58.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:01.430 --> 05:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
okay that was my assumption so
 
05:55:03.470 --> 05:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
I think if first of all if we are going
 
05:55:06.048 --> 05:55:06.058 align:start position:0%
to go for personnel at all we ought to
 
05:55:08.090 --> 05:55:08.100 align:start position:0%
go to investigate go for investigators
 
05:55:10.690 --> 05:55:10.700 align:start position:0%
they are the more useful and and
 
05:55:13.548 --> 05:55:13.558 align:start position:0%
valuable employees to have for the
 
05:55:15.110 --> 05:55:15.120 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission
 
05:55:18.110 --> 05:55:18.120 align:start position:0%
um so the question for me only becomes
 
05:55:21.350 --> 05:55:21.360 align:start position:0%
whether we want to uh well see whether
 
05:55:24.708 --> 05:55:24.718 align:start position:0%
we have a majority for investigators and
 
05:55:26.330 --> 05:55:26.340 align:start position:0%
then whether we want to go forward with
 
05:55:29.150 --> 05:55:29.160 align:start position:0%
adding positions at all
 
05:55:35.690 --> 05:55:35.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:37.730 --> 05:55:37.740 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
05:55:39.110 --> 05:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to
 
05:55:42.470 --> 05:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
um look me back in my notes the
 
05:55:44.868 --> 05:55:44.878 align:start position:0%
um this bill is going to mean Ways and
 
05:55:48.170 --> 05:55:48.180 align:start position:0%
Means after it goes it comes here after
 
05:55:51.410 --> 05:55:51.420 align:start position:0%
it leaves here excuse me and um the way
 
05:55:55.330 --> 05:55:55.340 align:start position:0%
we had someone named Mark
 
05:56:06.490 --> 05:56:06.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:09.590 --> 05:56:09.600 align:start position:0%
he said that applications have gone up
 
05:56:12.288 --> 05:56:12.298 align:start position:0%
through by 167
 
05:56:16.910 --> 05:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
in the um liquor uh license area that
 
05:56:19.868 --> 05:56:19.878 align:start position:0%
includes smoke shops there's 5
 
05:56:24.770 --> 05:56:24.780 align:start position:0%
661 active licenses and they have 26
 
05:56:27.410 --> 05:56:27.420 align:start position:0%
investigators some are full-time and
 
05:56:30.350 --> 05:56:30.360 align:start position:0%
some are part-time and each investigator
 
05:56:34.430 --> 05:56:34.440 align:start position:0%
in has approximately 377 licenses that
 
05:56:37.190 --> 05:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
they're responsible for
 
05:56:39.410 --> 05:56:39.420 align:start position:0%
um it was also noted by the um
 
05:56:42.230 --> 05:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
representative abrami that these two
 
05:56:44.270 --> 05:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
investigators would be sworn officers
 
05:56:46.730 --> 05:56:46.740 align:start position:0%
and they would be paid in time by the
 
05:56:49.850 --> 05:56:49.860 align:start position:0%
fees collected from this change in fee
 
05:56:49.860 --> 05:56:51.890 align:start position:0%
fees collected from this change in fee
schedule

05:56:51.890 --> 05:56:51.900 align:start position:0%
schedule
 
05:56:54.288 --> 05:56:54.298 align:start position:0%
um let me just see what other thing that
 
05:56:57.590 --> 05:56:57.600 align:start position:0%
I can say to be helpful
 
05:57:01.070 --> 05:57:01.080 align:start position:0%
um we also um Catherine Frey from new
 
05:57:04.250 --> 05:57:04.260 align:start position:0%
Futures also testified in favor of the
 
05:57:06.590 --> 05:57:06.600 align:start position:0%
in support of the bill because she felt
 
05:57:08.810 --> 05:57:08.820 align:start position:0%
the enforcement which I guess is part of
 
05:57:11.690 --> 05:57:11.700 align:start position:0%
the investigator's role would help with
 
05:57:15.948 --> 05:57:15.958 align:start position:0%
those who are younger than 21 years old
 
05:57:19.010 --> 05:57:19.020 align:start position:0%
um the uh Arden Moore who's the state
 
05:57:22.010 --> 05:57:22.020 align:start position:0%
liquor commissioner also uh testified
 
05:57:22.020 --> 05:57:23.690 align:start position:0%
liquor commissioner also uh testified
and

05:57:23.690 --> 05:57:23.700 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:57:25.548 --> 05:57:25.558 align:start position:0%
um he was supportive of the amendment
 
05:57:27.770 --> 05:57:27.780 align:start position:0%
especially with the um
 
05:57:30.830 --> 05:57:30.840 align:start position:0%
the fee remedy
 
05:57:33.650 --> 05:57:33.660 align:start position:0%
so that I hope that helps but it seemed
 
05:57:35.990 --> 05:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
to me that the um that most people that
 
05:57:37.548 --> 05:57:37.558 align:start position:0%
testified were in support of the
 
05:57:39.590 --> 05:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
investigators because of the workload
 
05:57:41.448 --> 05:57:41.458 align:start position:0%
and the enforcement regulations that are
 
05:57:43.190 --> 05:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
needed in this industry
 
05:57:45.470 --> 05:57:45.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:57:49.430 --> 05:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:51.890 --> 05:57:51.900 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
05:57:54.230 --> 05:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
um I was having I've had this sense that
 
05:57:56.448 --> 05:57:56.458 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns might be the cost of
 
05:57:59.750 --> 05:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
these two positions so I looked up
 
05:58:02.390 --> 05:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
um the Personnel classifications for
 
05:58:07.250 --> 05:58:07.260 align:start position:0%
these jobs and the investigators which
 
05:58:09.350 --> 05:58:09.360 align:start position:0%
are the lower level
 
05:58:12.350 --> 05:58:12.360 align:start position:0%
um which are the higher position their
 
05:58:14.690 --> 05:58:14.700 align:start position:0%
labor grades there's two classes a one
 
05:58:17.150 --> 05:58:17.160 align:start position:0%
and a two and those are labor grades 19
 
05:58:19.010 --> 05:58:19.020 align:start position:0%
and 20.
 
05:58:23.170 --> 05:58:23.180 align:start position:0%
and the examiners there are three levels
 
05:58:27.350 --> 05:58:27.360 align:start position:0%
17 20 and 23
 
05:58:30.288 --> 05:58:30.298 align:start position:0%
. so there's and these are not high
 
05:58:32.750 --> 05:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
level positions the classified labor
 
05:58:34.788 --> 05:58:34.798 align:start position:0%
grades I've seen the lowest one I've
 
05:58:37.730 --> 05:58:37.740 align:start position:0%
ever seen was eight and the highest you
 
05:58:40.610 --> 05:58:40.620 align:start position:0%
can get is 35 and that's somebody who
 
05:58:43.010 --> 05:58:43.020 align:start position:0%
usually supervises
 
05:58:44.750 --> 05:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
um quite a few people
 
05:58:47.510 --> 05:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
so I don't think that the cost is really
 
05:58:50.350 --> 05:58:50.360 align:start position:0%
an issue on this if if that's what's
 
05:58:53.930 --> 05:58:53.940 align:start position:0%
been holding some people back so I
 
05:58:53.940 --> 05:58:55.250 align:start position:0%
been holding some people back so I
certainly

05:58:55.250 --> 05:58:55.260 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
05:58:58.250 --> 05:58:58.260 align:start position:0%
um support the investigators I also
 
05:59:00.070 --> 05:59:00.080 align:start position:0%
looked at the job description
 
05:59:02.868 --> 05:59:02.878 align:start position:0%
descriptions and
 
05:59:05.868 --> 05:59:05.878 align:start position:0%
um the investigators the job description
 
05:59:10.970 --> 05:59:10.980 align:start position:0%
was last updated in 2017 the other ones
 
05:59:15.590 --> 05:59:15.600 align:start position:0%
were last updated in 2010 which it
 
05:59:19.368 --> 05:59:19.378 align:start position:0%
doesn't prove but it um
 
05:59:23.208 --> 05:59:23.218 align:start position:0%
in a way supports the representative
 
05:59:26.690 --> 05:59:26.700 align:start position:0%
fontenotes thought that perhaps
 
05:59:29.390 --> 05:59:29.400 align:start position:0%
um nobody they don't even employ any of
 
05:59:33.530 --> 05:59:33.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:35.990 --> 05:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
so that's what I have to say all right
 
05:59:36.000 --> 05:59:38.390 align:start position:0%
so that's what I have to say all right
representative

05:59:38.390 --> 05:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:59:40.310 --> 05:59:40.320 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
05:59:42.830 --> 05:59:42.840 align:start position:0%
um representative in a couple of my
 
05:59:46.010 --> 05:59:46.020 align:start position:0%
points that the bill will bring on to
 
05:59:48.948 --> 05:59:48.958 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means I just wanted to respond
 
05:59:53.230 --> 05:59:53.240 align:start position:0%
to representative scitec's concerns that
 
05:59:57.170 --> 05:59:57.180 align:start position:0%
my main intent is that we would just be
 
06:00:00.650 --> 06:00:00.660 align:start position:0%
endorsing the policy of adding these two
 
06:00:00.660 --> 06:00:01.670 align:start position:0%
endorsing the policy of adding these two
positions

06:00:01.670 --> 06:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
positions
 
06:00:03.530 --> 06:00:03.540 align:start position:0%
and of course Ways and Means would make
 
06:00:06.650 --> 06:00:06.660 align:start position:0%
the final decision as to the economics
 
06:00:10.570 --> 06:00:10.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:14.150 --> 06:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
I have a question for representative
 
06:00:14.160 --> 06:00:15.070 align:start position:0%
I have a question for representative
yes

06:00:15.070 --> 06:00:15.080 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:00:18.170 --> 06:00:18.180 align:start position:0%
I representative so just just so I heard
 
06:00:19.850 --> 06:00:19.860 align:start position:0%
you right the pay grade for an
 
06:00:22.670 --> 06:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
investigator is 19 and 20 The Examiner
 
06:00:25.850 --> 06:00:25.860 align:start position:0%
is 17 20 23 the examiners have a higher
 
06:00:28.070 --> 06:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
pay grade than the investigators
 
06:00:28.080 --> 06:00:31.910 align:start position:0%
pay grade than the investigators
potentially

06:00:31.910 --> 06:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:34.548 --> 06:00:34.558 align:start position:0%
um at the top level I mean I'm just I'm
 
06:00:36.650 --> 06:00:36.660 align:start position:0%
just reading from the database that has
 
06:00:38.330 --> 06:00:38.340 align:start position:0%
all the job descriptions and
 
06:00:40.730 --> 06:00:40.740 align:start position:0%
classifications that's not telling you
 
06:00:42.890 --> 06:00:42.900 align:start position:0%
if anybody's in that slot but that's
 
06:00:47.690 --> 06:00:47.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:49.788 --> 06:00:49.798 align:start position:0%
and they're not those are not high labor
 
06:00:52.090 --> 06:00:52.100 align:start position:0%
grades right no right
 
06:00:52.100 --> 06:00:53.270 align:start position:0%
grades right no right
[Music]

06:00:53.270 --> 06:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:00:54.830 --> 06:00:54.840 align:start position:0%
I guess my presumption with the
 
06:00:56.390 --> 06:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
investigation repeat more than examiners
 
06:00:58.090 --> 06:00:58.100 align:start position:0%
but I guess that's not the case
 
06:01:02.448 --> 06:01:02.458 align:start position:0%
it may be the higher ones
 
06:01:05.628 --> 06:01:05.638 align:start position:0%
very likely uh I would like to mention
 
06:01:08.990 --> 06:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
that at the hearing that representative
 
06:01:13.070 --> 06:01:13.080 align:start position:0%
abrami mentioned that the amendment that
 
06:01:16.788 --> 06:01:16.798 align:start position:0%
eliminated the duplicate license fees
 
06:01:19.910 --> 06:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
for tobacco plus alcohol places which is
 
06:01:22.670 --> 06:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of them would
 
06:01:26.208 --> 06:01:26.218 align:start position:0%
in fact make it unlikely that the fees
 
06:01:28.128 --> 06:01:28.138 align:start position:0%
collected would cover the cost of the
 
06:01:31.010 --> 06:01:31.020 align:start position:0%
Auditors but that's
 
06:01:32.930 --> 06:01:32.940 align:start position:0%
we don't know that for sure we don't
 
06:01:34.970 --> 06:01:34.980 align:start position:0%
know what their their budget is like and
 
06:01:36.530 --> 06:01:36.540 align:start position:0%
I think that's something that Ways and
 
06:01:44.510 --> 06:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:48.470 --> 06:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
so representative Allegro yeah I didn't
 
06:01:50.570 --> 06:01:50.580 align:start position:0%
want to chime in again but I I asked the
 
06:01:53.270 --> 06:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
question of what investigators do versus
 
06:01:53.280 --> 06:01:54.830 align:start position:0%
question of what investigators do versus
examiners

06:01:54.830 --> 06:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
examiners
 
06:01:57.110 --> 06:01:57.120 align:start position:0%
and we're sitting here debating whether
 
06:01:59.150 --> 06:01:59.160 align:start position:0%
or not we're going to
 
06:02:03.650 --> 06:02:03.660 align:start position:0%
essentially authorize two employees
 
06:02:06.170 --> 06:02:06.180 align:start position:0%
or to employee classes one of two
 
06:02:08.390 --> 06:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
employee classes neither of which any of
 
06:02:10.250 --> 06:02:10.260 align:start position:0%
us appears to know what their function
 
06:02:10.260 --> 06:02:12.650 align:start position:0%
us appears to know what their function
is

06:02:12.650 --> 06:02:12.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:16.010 --> 06:02:16.020 align:start position:0%
so maybe we should consider holding off
 
06:02:19.610 --> 06:02:19.620 align:start position:0%
on this one until we know precisely what
 
06:02:21.350 --> 06:02:21.360 align:start position:0%
those roles are excuse me the sun is in
 
06:02:23.208 --> 06:02:23.218 align:start position:0%
my eyes I can't
 
06:02:25.788 --> 06:02:25.798 align:start position:0%
um you can't see the screen but maybe we
 
06:02:27.788 --> 06:02:27.798 align:start position:0%
should hold off until we've
 
06:02:30.410 --> 06:02:30.420 align:start position:0%
understood what an investigator what an
 
06:02:33.110 --> 06:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
examiner does what their paid rates are
 
06:02:34.548 --> 06:02:34.558 align:start position:0%
whether that's
 
06:02:37.250 --> 06:02:37.260 align:start position:0%
even a concern
 
06:02:39.920 --> 06:02:39.930 align:start position:0%
just a thought
 
06:02:39.930 --> 06:02:42.650 align:start position:0%
just a thought
[Music]

06:02:42.650 --> 06:02:42.660 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:02:42.660 --> 06:02:43.670 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

06:02:43.670 --> 06:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:02:46.670 --> 06:02:46.680 align:start position:0%
I'm new to the committee but it seemed a
 
06:02:48.350 --> 06:02:48.360 align:start position:0%
little strange to me that this bill came
 
06:02:50.390 --> 06:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
to Union in the first place
 
06:02:53.690 --> 06:02:53.700 align:start position:0%
and certainly strange that we would be
 
06:02:55.310 --> 06:02:55.320 align:start position:0%
deciding whether or not to have
 
06:02:57.288 --> 06:02:57.298 align:start position:0%
positions and what type is
 
06:02:59.330 --> 06:02:59.340 align:start position:0%
previous speaker said you know that we
 
06:03:01.070 --> 06:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
don't fully understand and that's part
 
06:03:02.090 --> 06:03:02.100 align:start position:0%
of why
 
06:03:04.190 --> 06:03:04.200 align:start position:0%
I have the amendment to remove them all
 
06:03:06.948 --> 06:03:06.958 align:start position:0%
together and if Ways and Means feels
 
06:03:08.390 --> 06:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
there is a need
 
06:03:10.610 --> 06:03:10.620 align:start position:0%
to add them they can do that either this
 
06:03:13.730 --> 06:03:13.740 align:start position:0%
bill or someplace else that's what I
 
06:03:16.970 --> 06:03:16.980 align:start position:0%
would suggest doing yeah the
 
06:03:21.170 --> 06:03:21.180 align:start position:0%
uh the positions could be easily added
 
06:03:22.850 --> 06:03:22.860 align:start position:0%
in this in the budget
 
06:03:25.430 --> 06:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
if they are deemed to be appropriate but
 
06:03:27.350 --> 06:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
as you say we don't know what these
 
06:03:28.430 --> 06:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
people do
 
06:03:31.788 --> 06:03:31.798 align:start position:0%
and we don't know what they
 
06:03:34.368 --> 06:03:34.378 align:start position:0%
so we don't know the really the
 
06:03:36.230 --> 06:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
difference between the two positions
 
06:03:40.510 --> 06:03:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:40.520 --> 06:03:42.230 align:start position:0%
 
and

06:03:42.230 --> 06:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:03:44.810 --> 06:03:44.820 align:start position:0%
um and we also you know have it as far
 
06:03:45.890 --> 06:03:45.900 align:start position:0%
as I know
 
06:03:50.690 --> 06:03:50.700 align:start position:0%
uh seriously analyze the actual needs of
 
06:03:53.090 --> 06:03:53.100 align:start position:0%
of a Liquor Commission and if you have
 
06:03:54.650 --> 06:03:54.660 align:start position:0%
any understanding of whether they really
 
06:03:59.890 --> 06:03:59.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:02.510 --> 06:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
it's very quickly to Representatives
 
06:04:05.208 --> 06:04:05.218 align:start position:0%
show it you mentioned that we were the
 
06:04:07.430 --> 06:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
policy committee and that Ways and Means
 
06:04:10.128 --> 06:04:10.138 align:start position:0%
would do the dollars and cents of it and
 
06:04:13.010 --> 06:04:13.020 align:start position:0%
I think they really I don't want to be
 
06:04:15.890 --> 06:04:15.900 align:start position:0%
trying to be Mr last word but I think
 
06:04:18.288 --> 06:04:18.298 align:start position:0%
it's really a policy decision for them
 
06:04:20.810 --> 06:04:20.820 align:start position:0%
if they if they want the two invest if
 
06:04:24.350 --> 06:04:24.360 align:start position:0%
if you can sell the two investigators to
 
06:04:26.990 --> 06:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
them I'll vote for it but right now I I
 
06:04:29.390 --> 06:04:29.400 align:start position:0%
I'm going to Kick the Can up the road or
 
06:04:32.170 --> 06:04:32.180 align:start position:0%
down the road wherever the road is
 
06:04:35.270 --> 06:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
I'm not at all sure why we got this bill
 
06:04:36.890 --> 06:04:36.900 align:start position:0%
in the first place
 
06:04:40.670 --> 06:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
fees belong with toys and means and
 
06:04:43.190 --> 06:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
commerce normally deals with the details
 
06:04:44.690 --> 06:04:44.700 align:start position:0%
of the Liquor Commission and the
 
06:04:47.868 --> 06:04:47.878 align:start position:0%
licenses we don't
 
06:04:50.448 --> 06:04:50.458 align:start position:0%
this is totally outside of our bail of
 
06:04:52.548 --> 06:04:52.558 align:start position:0%
wind and none of us are familiar with
 
06:04:53.930 --> 06:04:53.940 align:start position:0%
the type of
 
06:04:57.770 --> 06:04:57.780 align:start position:0%
of issues that are brought out and
 
06:05:00.350 --> 06:05:00.360 align:start position:0%
if we were in a normal year where we
 
06:05:02.990 --> 06:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
could where we were meeting in session I
 
06:05:04.610 --> 06:05:04.620 align:start position:0%
would have asked to vacate this bill
 
06:05:07.490 --> 06:05:07.500 align:start position:0%
because it's not really appropriate for
 
06:05:07.500 --> 06:05:08.448 align:start position:0%
because it's not really appropriate for
us

06:05:08.448 --> 06:05:08.458 align:start position:0%
us
 
06:05:08.458 --> 06:05:09.788 align:start position:0%
us
so

06:05:09.788 --> 06:05:09.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:05:13.250 --> 06:05:13.260 align:start position:0%
I agree that we should
 
06:05:17.030 --> 06:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
pass pass to get the fee changes that
 
06:05:19.310 --> 06:05:19.320 align:start position:0%
representative abrami says correct a
 
06:05:21.708 --> 06:05:21.718 align:start position:0%
mistake and everybody seems to worry
 
06:05:24.770 --> 06:05:24.780 align:start position:0%
about that but I'm not personally
 
06:05:26.570 --> 06:05:26.580 align:start position:0%
comfortable with adding new positions
 
06:05:28.010 --> 06:05:28.020 align:start position:0%
when we
 
06:05:30.708 --> 06:05:30.718 align:start position:0%
didn't really get the good understanding
 
06:05:34.670 --> 06:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
of what they do or why we need them
 
06:05:39.110 --> 06:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:41.030 --> 06:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and all the
 
06:05:43.070 --> 06:05:43.080 align:start position:0%
discussion about not knowing what these
 
06:05:45.410 --> 06:05:45.420 align:start position:0%
folks do I thought it was explained to
 
06:05:48.230 --> 06:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
us uh in the hearing that
 
06:05:50.810 --> 06:05:50.820 align:start position:0%
um the examiners do the auditing and
 
06:05:52.548 --> 06:05:52.558 align:start position:0%
looking at the records where the
 
06:05:54.170 --> 06:05:54.180 align:start position:0%
investigators have the enforcement
 
06:05:54.180 --> 06:05:55.368 align:start position:0%
investigators have the enforcement
Authority

06:05:55.368 --> 06:05:55.378 align:start position:0%
Authority
 
06:05:58.670 --> 06:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure where we're not
 
06:06:00.890 --> 06:06:00.900 align:start position:0%
knowing what they do because for my
 
06:06:02.590 --> 06:06:02.600 align:start position:0%
recollection that was explained to us
 
06:06:06.830 --> 06:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:08.990 --> 06:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm glad you got it so could
 
06:06:15.110 --> 06:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:17.930 --> 06:06:17.940 align:start position:0%
I thought I just did that the examiners
 
06:06:19.730 --> 06:06:19.740 align:start position:0%
were the ones that do the auditing and
 
06:06:22.730 --> 06:06:22.740 align:start position:0%
looking at the records and receipts and
 
06:06:25.310 --> 06:06:25.320 align:start position:0%
my understanding was the investigators
 
06:06:27.410 --> 06:06:27.420 align:start position:0%
uh actually had the law enforcement
 
06:06:30.170 --> 06:06:30.180 align:start position:0%
authority to actually
 
06:06:32.510 --> 06:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
follow up on the cases and prosecute
 
06:06:32.520 --> 06:06:33.530 align:start position:0%
follow up on the cases and prosecute
them

06:06:33.530 --> 06:06:33.540 align:start position:0%
them
 
06:06:36.350 --> 06:06:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:36.360 --> 06:06:38.230 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:06:38.230 --> 06:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:06:41.270 --> 06:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
even if that's true you know we don't
 
06:06:44.030 --> 06:06:44.040 align:start position:0%
have an overview really of the workload
 
06:06:45.830 --> 06:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
of the department I don't think police
 
06:06:48.170 --> 06:06:48.180 align:start position:0%
know how many employees what type they
 
06:06:49.970 --> 06:06:49.980 align:start position:0%
had or whatever they need
 
06:06:52.310 --> 06:06:52.320 align:start position:0%
and so I wouldn't feel comfortable
 
06:06:55.310 --> 06:06:55.320 align:start position:0%
supporting adding positions but I can't
 
06:06:59.208 --> 06:06:59.218 align:start position:0%
really tell that they really are me
 
06:07:01.128 --> 06:07:01.138 align:start position:0%
and it's really not I don't see it as
 
06:07:03.048 --> 06:07:03.058 align:start position:0%
our job to do that
 
06:07:04.090 --> 06:07:04.100 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:07:06.770 --> 06:07:06.780 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
06:07:09.650 --> 06:07:09.660 align:start position:0%
um yes Madam chair I'm just if you want
 
06:07:11.690 --> 06:07:11.700 align:start position:0%
me to read a couple of words from the
 
06:07:15.170 --> 06:07:15.180 align:start position:0%
job descriptions I can or I can
 
06:07:17.448 --> 06:07:17.458 align:start position:0%
um take me a little bit of time I could
 
06:07:20.390 --> 06:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh email them to you there's five of
 
06:07:21.770 --> 06:07:21.780 align:start position:0%
them all together if you want to see all
 
06:07:24.230 --> 06:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
three of the layers but it's very clear
 
06:07:26.750 --> 06:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
that the examiners I'm just reading
 
06:07:29.628 --> 06:07:29.638 align:start position:0%
words from the first two items of the
 
06:07:31.490 --> 06:07:31.500 align:start position:0%
job description
 
06:07:34.190 --> 06:07:34.200 align:start position:0%
um audits verify sales uh delivery
 
06:07:36.410 --> 06:07:36.420 align:start position:0%
reports and fiscal audits prepares
 
06:07:39.368 --> 06:07:39.378 align:start position:0%
reports of tax payments and violations
 
06:07:43.310 --> 06:07:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:46.610 --> 06:07:46.620 align:start position:0%
the investigator
 
06:07:48.850 --> 06:07:48.860 align:start position:0%
um supports
 
06:07:51.610 --> 06:07:51.620 align:start position:0%
licensing by doing
 
06:07:55.190 --> 06:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
inspections issuance of new in renewed
 
06:07:58.970 --> 06:07:58.980 align:start position:0%
licenses and the second item talks about
 
06:08:02.090 --> 06:08:02.100 align:start position:0%
conducts criminal investigations so
 
06:08:05.150 --> 06:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
those they always list what the person
 
06:08:06.708 --> 06:08:06.718 align:start position:0%
does most
 
06:08:09.288 --> 06:08:09.298 align:start position:0%
at on the first lines of the description
 
06:08:09.298 --> 06:08:10.730 align:start position:0%
at on the first lines of the description
so

06:08:10.730 --> 06:08:10.740 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:08:13.128 --> 06:08:13.138 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:08:14.868 --> 06:08:14.878 align:start position:0%
representative schuett you have another
 
06:08:14.878 --> 06:08:15.948 align:start position:0%
representative schuett you have another
comment

06:08:15.948 --> 06:08:15.958 align:start position:0%
comment
 
06:08:19.548 --> 06:08:19.558 align:start position:0%
yes um I have known
 
06:08:23.530 --> 06:08:23.540 align:start position:0%
um a few actual liquor investigators
 
06:08:26.868 --> 06:08:26.878 align:start position:0%
mostly they are retired police officers
 
06:08:30.410 --> 06:08:30.420 align:start position:0%
who are familiar with the laws and they
 
06:08:33.650 --> 06:08:33.660 align:start position:0%
investigate for example charges of
 
06:08:39.230 --> 06:08:39.240 align:start position:0%
someone who has gotten a DUI who then
 
06:08:42.170 --> 06:08:42.180 align:start position:0%
they investigate whether or not the
 
06:08:45.310 --> 06:08:45.320 align:start position:0%
bartender involved for example in a bar
 
06:08:49.128 --> 06:08:49.138 align:start position:0%
was not following the law about
 
06:08:49.138 --> 06:08:50.150 align:start position:0%
was not following the law about
um

06:08:50.150 --> 06:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:08:52.910 --> 06:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
on refusing to serve someone who has
 
06:08:57.048 --> 06:08:57.058 align:start position:0%
over imbibed things of that nature
 
06:08:59.448 --> 06:08:59.458 align:start position:0%
um and again I will just say that
 
06:09:02.448 --> 06:09:02.458 align:start position:0%
basically I put this amendment in to
 
06:09:05.750 --> 06:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
return the bill to the original way that
 
06:09:10.128 --> 06:09:10.138 align:start position:0%
we got it except for the um
 
06:09:13.270 --> 06:09:13.280 align:start position:0%
changes in the tax
 
06:09:13.280 --> 06:09:14.830 align:start position:0%
changes in the tax
ramifications

06:09:14.830 --> 06:09:14.840 align:start position:0%
ramifications
 
06:09:17.930 --> 06:09:17.940 align:start position:0%
and that's the way I felt it should go
 
06:09:20.810 --> 06:09:20.820 align:start position:0%
ways and means I'm sure that the ways
 
06:09:23.990 --> 06:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
and means members have much more
 
06:09:27.770 --> 06:09:27.780 align:start position:0%
knowledge of what investigators do and
 
06:09:31.190 --> 06:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
the implications of this bill
 
06:09:39.048 --> 06:09:39.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:42.470 --> 06:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
sorry I thought I put my hand down I did
 
06:09:49.910 --> 06:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:53.208 --> 06:09:53.218 align:start position:0%
no it's then you're sorry I lowered my
 
06:09:55.730 --> 06:09:55.740 align:start position:0%
hand instead of unmuting myself
 
06:09:55.740 --> 06:09:56.390 align:start position:0%
hand instead of unmuting myself
um

06:09:56.390 --> 06:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:09:59.510 --> 06:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
I just want to reiterate that it was
 
06:10:01.910 --> 06:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
these positions were described in the
 
06:10:03.708 --> 06:10:03.718 align:start position:0%
hearing and also the need for these
 
06:10:06.110 --> 06:10:06.120 align:start position:0%
subscriptions these these positions was
 
06:10:06.120 --> 06:10:07.970 align:start position:0%
subscriptions these these positions was
also

06:10:07.970 --> 06:10:07.980 align:start position:0%
also
 
06:10:10.548 --> 06:10:10.558 align:start position:0%
um requested by not only representative
 
06:10:14.390 --> 06:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
abrami but by the liquid commission so I
 
06:10:17.810 --> 06:10:17.820 align:start position:0%
don't um feel comfortable taking them
 
06:10:20.990 --> 06:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
out of the out of the bill
 
06:10:21.000 --> 06:10:23.090 align:start position:0%
out of the out of the bill
um

06:10:23.090 --> 06:10:23.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:25.610 --> 06:10:25.620 align:start position:0%
and I would rather I would rather
 
06:10:25.620 --> 06:10:26.868 align:start position:0%
and I would rather I would rather
support

06:10:26.868 --> 06:10:26.878 align:start position:0%
support
 
06:10:29.330 --> 06:10:29.340 align:start position:0%
um representative shewitz Amendment
 
06:10:31.368 --> 06:10:31.378 align:start position:0%
rather than that of Representative
 
06:10:36.070 --> 06:10:36.080 align:start position:0%
luckis no um no harm intended
 
06:10:38.990 --> 06:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
06:10:42.890 --> 06:10:42.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:45.470 --> 06:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
I think it's been it's been made Fairly
 
06:10:47.570 --> 06:10:47.580 align:start position:0%
clear that this is really something that
 
06:10:49.850 --> 06:10:49.860 align:start position:0%
should be handled by
 
06:10:51.410 --> 06:10:51.420 align:start position:0%
the other committee
 
06:10:53.448 --> 06:10:53.458 align:start position:0%
so I'm
 
06:10:55.250 --> 06:10:55.260 align:start position:0%
I'm fine with the Lexus Amendment let's
 
06:10:57.708 --> 06:10:57.718 align:start position:0%
get it over to them and let them deal
 
06:10:59.150 --> 06:10:59.160 align:start position:0%
with the particulars that they're used
 
06:10:59.160 --> 06:10:59.830 align:start position:0%
with the particulars that they're used
to

06:10:59.830 --> 06:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:10:59.840 --> 06:11:01.490 align:start position:0%
to
[Music]

06:11:01.490 --> 06:11:01.500 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:11:03.650 --> 06:11:03.660 align:start position:0%
does anyone else
 
06:11:05.030 --> 06:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
or in
 
06:11:11.330 --> 06:11:11.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:13.730 --> 06:11:13.740 align:start position:0%
I do have a quick comment if Ways and
 
06:11:15.770 --> 06:11:15.780 align:start position:0%
Means finds that these positions are not
 
06:11:18.230 --> 06:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
necessary then they can take them out is
 
06:11:19.490 --> 06:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
06:11:19.500 --> 06:11:20.990 align:start position:0%
that correct
yes

06:11:20.990 --> 06:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:11:21.000 --> 06:11:22.070 align:start position:0%
yes
okay

06:11:22.070 --> 06:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:11:22.080 --> 06:11:23.990 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

06:11:23.990 --> 06:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:11:24.000 --> 06:11:24.590 align:start position:0%
okay
um

06:11:24.590 --> 06:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:11:27.288 --> 06:11:27.298 align:start position:0%
rather than having a specific vote on
 
06:11:29.570 --> 06:11:29.580 align:start position:0%
the specific Amendment
 
06:11:32.030 --> 06:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
I think we have a three Choice vote it's
 
06:11:34.610 --> 06:11:34.620 align:start position:0%
important to handle it
 
06:11:34.620 --> 06:11:35.570 align:start position:0%
important to handle it
okay

06:11:35.570 --> 06:11:35.580 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:11:39.170 --> 06:11:39.180 align:start position:0%
uh oh I have plenty of papers okay it's
 
06:11:41.570 --> 06:11:41.580 align:start position:0%
fine so I think we will
 
06:11:44.390 --> 06:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
the the simplest thing to do is to vote
 
06:11:47.390 --> 06:11:47.400 align:start position:0%
on whether we think there should be
 
06:11:47.400 --> 06:11:49.128 align:start position:0%
on whether we think there should be
examiners

06:11:49.128 --> 06:11:49.138 align:start position:0%
examiners
 
06:11:53.030 --> 06:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
inspectors or no Physicians the bill and
 
06:11:54.590 --> 06:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
then we will adopt the amendment that
 
06:11:58.310 --> 06:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:02.948 --> 06:12:02.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:07.610 --> 06:12:07.620 align:start position:0%
shelves wait I I think it's investigator
 
06:12:09.530 --> 06:12:09.540 align:start position:0%
maybe you said this I mean I couldn't
 
06:12:12.048 --> 06:12:12.058 align:start position:0%
hear it quite right investigators or
 
06:12:15.708 --> 06:12:15.718 align:start position:0%
examiners or no position correct I
 
06:12:17.868 --> 06:12:17.878 align:start position:0%
thought you said inspectors so it's
 
06:12:22.670 --> 06:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:25.190 --> 06:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
06:12:27.170 --> 06:12:27.180 align:start position:0%
representative scitec could you call the
 
06:12:28.310 --> 06:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
role okay
 
06:12:31.670 --> 06:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
what is
 
06:12:34.090 --> 06:12:34.100 align:start position:0%
what is the vote
 
06:12:36.830 --> 06:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
I just believe this bill should be
 
06:12:40.548 --> 06:12:40.558 align:start position:0%
amended or left alone and whether we
 
06:12:44.470 --> 06:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
send it forward with investigators
 
06:12:47.810 --> 06:12:47.820 align:start position:0%
examiners or no positions
 
06:12:50.090 --> 06:12:50.100 align:start position:0%
right but what are we voting yes or no
 
06:12:51.948 --> 06:12:51.958 align:start position:0%
are we going to vote investigators or
 
06:12:56.150 --> 06:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
exams oh no positions investigators or
 
06:12:56.160 --> 06:12:57.708 align:start position:0%
exams oh no positions investigators or
examiners

06:12:57.708 --> 06:12:57.718 align:start position:0%
examiners
 
06:12:59.990 --> 06:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
she's a three-way vote
 
06:13:01.970 --> 06:13:01.980 align:start position:0%
this is a survey essentially it's a
 
06:13:05.650 --> 06:13:05.660 align:start position:0%
survey like a straw poll whatever yeah
 
06:13:09.288 --> 06:13:09.298 align:start position:0%
after we decide what the committee wants
 
06:13:11.570 --> 06:13:11.580 align:start position:0%
then we will find the amendment that
 
06:13:14.090 --> 06:13:14.100 align:start position:0%
that puts that into proper language and
 
06:13:14.100 --> 06:13:16.690 align:start position:0%
that puts that into proper language and
adopted

06:13:16.690 --> 06:13:16.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:19.990 --> 06:13:20.000 align:start position:0%

investigators please representative
O'Brien

06:15:15.910 --> 06:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
O'Brien
 
06:15:18.470 --> 06:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
investigators okay I didn't mean to step
 
06:15:20.810 --> 06:15:20.820 align:start position:0%
on your line representative Rhoda it
 
06:15:24.110 --> 06:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
does look like it's quite binary 10 9
 
06:15:27.530 --> 06:15:27.540 align:start position:0%
10. all right the current status of the
 
06:15:29.390 --> 06:15:29.400 align:start position:0%
bill is that we adopted an amendment
 
06:15:34.750 --> 06:15:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:37.970 --> 06:15:37.980 align:start position:0%
so I did I didn't hear a vote of the
 
06:15:37.980 --> 06:15:38.750 align:start position:0%
so I did I didn't hear a vote of the
chair

06:15:38.750 --> 06:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
chair
 
06:15:41.048 --> 06:15:41.058 align:start position:0%
and I didn't hear what the outcome was
 
06:15:44.948 --> 06:15:44.958 align:start position:0%
excuse me that's correct I wasn't asked
 
06:15:48.708 --> 06:15:48.718 align:start position:0%
I vote with the zeros so we have nine in
 
06:15:51.650 --> 06:15:51.660 align:start position:0%
favor investigators 10 in favor of no
 
06:15:54.948 --> 06:15:54.958 align:start position:0%
positions and nobody wants examiners
 
06:15:57.910 --> 06:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
well I wouldn't mind
 
06:16:03.410 --> 06:16:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:06.890 --> 06:16:06.900 align:start position:0%
so so the amendment we previously
 
06:16:09.230 --> 06:16:09.240 align:start position:0%
adopted has examiners
 
06:16:12.890 --> 06:16:12.900 align:start position:0%
nobody wants to do that so I would
 
06:16:15.590 --> 06:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
invite a motion to reconsider our vote
 
06:16:19.070 --> 06:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
to adopt that Amendment
 
06:16:22.788 --> 06:16:22.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:24.948 --> 06:16:24.958 align:start position:0%
don't adopt that Amendment and we want
 
06:16:26.930 --> 06:16:26.940 align:start position:0%
to adopt my Amendment then we go back to
 
06:16:29.270 --> 06:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
the whole fees in the original bill
 
06:16:32.030 --> 06:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
and also if you're a kid you can't do
 
06:16:34.490 --> 06:16:34.500 align:start position:0%
that because my amendment to set up to
 
06:16:36.010 --> 06:16:36.020 align:start position:0%
use the section numbers
 
06:16:39.230 --> 06:16:39.240 align:start position:0%
oh okay so that instead of a complete
 
06:16:40.970 --> 06:16:40.980 align:start position:0%
Amendment you just have a deleted
 
06:16:43.190 --> 06:16:43.200 align:start position:0%
positions correct okay so you don't have
 
06:16:45.230 --> 06:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
to reconsider that but but Madam
 
06:16:47.350 --> 06:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
chairman you do have Amendment
 
06:16:51.288 --> 06:16:51.298 align:start position:0%
um0269 which is the fees from the abrami
 
06:17:06.190 --> 06:17:06.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:10.150 --> 06:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
no no you did it on your own
 
06:17:12.890 --> 06:17:12.900 align:start position:0%
you're right that amendment has my name
 
06:17:16.548 --> 06:17:16.558 align:start position:0%
on it yeah so in any event we want to
 
06:17:20.810 --> 06:17:20.820 align:start position:0%
reconsider the motion to adopt the the
 
06:17:24.410 --> 06:17:24.420 align:start position:0%
abrami amendment which nobody wants and
 
06:17:29.448 --> 06:17:29.458 align:start position:0%
then we can vote on the if we choose to
 
06:17:33.288 --> 06:17:33.298 align:start position:0%
not adopt that Amendment we can adopt my
 
06:17:33.298 --> 06:17:35.990 align:start position:0%
not adopt that Amendment we can adopt my
Amendment

06:17:35.990 --> 06:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:38.270 --> 06:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
and have a minority support recommending
 
06:17:40.250 --> 06:17:40.260 align:start position:0%
the shoe at Amendment which is what it
 
06:17:41.750 --> 06:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
sounds like
 
06:17:43.670 --> 06:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
so I will
 
06:17:43.680 --> 06:17:45.530 align:start position:0%
so I will
um

06:17:45.530 --> 06:17:45.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:17:50.750 --> 06:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:54.590 --> 06:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
the abrami amendment 0116.
 
06:17:54.600 --> 06:17:55.610 align:start position:0%
the abrami amendment 0116.
so

06:17:55.610 --> 06:17:55.620 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:17:57.650 --> 06:17:57.660 align:start position:0%
all right representative Allegro moves

06:32:26.570 --> 06:32:26.580 align:start position:0%
so I just have a question so it'll be
 
06:32:29.208 --> 06:32:29.218 align:start position:0%
listed with just one Amendment just the
 
06:32:32.510 --> 06:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
last one is that correct yes the
 
06:32:35.868 --> 06:32:35.878 align:start position:0%
minority proposes to adopt the bill
 
06:32:37.970 --> 06:32:37.980 align:start position:0%
ought to pass with the shuet amendment
 
06:32:40.250 --> 06:32:40.260 align:start position:0%
for example which is certainly a
 
06:32:42.650 --> 06:32:42.660 align:start position:0%
legitimate position then both amendments
 
06:32:44.708 --> 06:32:44.718 align:start position:0%
will be listed in the calendar
 
06:32:56.690 --> 06:32:56.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:01.310 --> 06:33:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:06.650 --> 06:33:06.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:06.660 --> 06:33:09.048 align:start position:0%
 
the

06:33:09.048 --> 06:33:09.058 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:33:11.750 --> 06:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
when we left off the last time the
 
06:33:15.530 --> 06:33:15.540 align:start position:0%
motion of itl failed
 
06:33:17.930 --> 06:33:17.940 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson
 
06:33:25.430 --> 06:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:28.510 --> 06:33:28.520 align:start position:0%
exhaust and I present Amendment
 
06:33:32.510 --> 06:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
0295 each
 
06:33:39.110 --> 06:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:41.570 --> 06:33:41.580 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry this is just I don't have a
 
06:33:45.548 --> 06:33:45.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:49.510 --> 06:33:49.520 align:start position:0%
okay representative Pearson
 
06:33:52.010 --> 06:33:52.020 align:start position:0%
thank you uh what the amendment does
 
06:33:55.670 --> 06:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
here is the amendment changes this bill
 
06:33:58.910 --> 06:33:58.920 align:start position:0%
to remove group one out of it if you
 
06:34:03.048 --> 06:34:03.058 align:start position:0%
turn to uh in the bill and it leaves it
 
06:34:05.448 --> 06:34:05.458 align:start position:0%
at the five percent as originally
 
06:34:05.458 --> 06:34:10.730 align:start position:0%
at the five percent as originally
written

06:34:10.730 --> 06:34:10.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:13.490 --> 06:34:13.500 align:start position:0%
so if you were looking at the
 
06:34:16.310 --> 06:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
fiscal note group one which is the
 
06:34:17.510 --> 06:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
reason they didn't add a new fiscal
 
06:34:18.830 --> 06:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
notice because it just eliminates group
 
06:34:20.510 --> 06:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
one so the fiscal notification would
 
06:34:24.830 --> 06:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:27.230 --> 06:34:27.240 align:start position:0%
may I ask a question
 
06:34:29.448 --> 06:34:29.458 align:start position:0%
uh yes
 
06:34:32.390 --> 06:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
so what you're saying is that
 
06:34:35.750 --> 06:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
only the contributions to group one
 
06:34:38.510 --> 06:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
we cut would be paid five percent of
 
06:34:40.730 --> 06:34:40.740 align:start position:0%
that would be paid by
 
06:34:40.740 --> 06:34:41.990 align:start position:0%
that would be paid by
state

06:34:41.990 --> 06:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
state
 
06:34:46.990 --> 06:34:47.000 align:start position:0%
and then the teachers which is group two
 
06:34:49.310 --> 06:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
I got this backwards do I have it
 
06:34:49.320 --> 06:34:50.330 align:start position:0%
I got this backwards do I have it
backwards

06:34:50.330 --> 06:34:50.340 align:start position:0%
backwards
 
06:34:53.090 --> 06:34:53.100 align:start position:0%
yes okay so group one okay group one
 
06:34:55.368 --> 06:34:55.378 align:start position:0%
that teaches with paper state but then
 
06:34:56.990 --> 06:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
the fire department and police
 
06:34:58.670 --> 06:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
department would all stay still the
 
06:35:00.770 --> 06:35:00.780 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the municipalities is
 
06:35:04.368 --> 06:35:04.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:06.350 --> 06:35:06.360 align:start position:0%
so the five percent State contribution
 
06:35:09.590 --> 06:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
would would kick in for police and fire
 
06:35:09.600 --> 06:35:10.610 align:start position:0%
would would kick in for police and fire
yeah

06:35:10.610 --> 06:35:10.620 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:35:12.890 --> 06:35:12.900 align:start position:0%
group one the teachers would stay as
 
06:35:16.190 --> 06:35:16.200 align:start position:0%
they are today with no change and why is
 
06:35:16.200 --> 06:35:17.330 align:start position:0%
they are today with no change and why is
that

06:35:17.330 --> 06:35:17.340 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:35:19.368 --> 06:35:19.378 align:start position:0%
the the reason for that really honestly
 
06:35:21.470 --> 06:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
has to do with what I what I have
 
06:35:22.910 --> 06:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
personally witnessed in the last four
 
06:35:26.390 --> 06:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
years of municipalities
 
06:35:29.868 --> 06:35:29.878 align:start position:0%
tightening their belts and
 
06:35:31.910 --> 06:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
some reorganization especially with the
 
06:35:33.590 --> 06:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
expanded roles that police and fire fed
 
06:35:35.750 --> 06:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic and what I have seen
 
06:35:39.470 --> 06:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
from the group one is the exact opposite
 
06:35:39.480 --> 06:35:40.850 align:start position:0%
from the group one is the exact opposite
so

06:35:40.850 --> 06:35:40.860 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:35:43.430 --> 06:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
there comes a point in time where we
 
06:35:44.868 --> 06:35:44.878 align:start position:0%
continue to
 
06:35:46.490 --> 06:35:46.500 align:start position:0%
give money
 
06:35:46.500 --> 06:35:49.490 align:start position:0%
give money
to

06:35:49.490 --> 06:35:49.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:52.788 --> 06:35:52.798 align:start position:0%
to group one in essence to the to the to
 
06:35:55.610 --> 06:35:55.620 align:start position:0%
education and for every dollar the state
 
06:35:56.990 --> 06:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
seems to give them they want a dollar
 
06:35:59.930 --> 06:35:59.940 align:start position:0%
25. and I I am
 
06:36:01.910 --> 06:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
I'm literally just kind of at wit's end
 
06:36:03.350 --> 06:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
with the lack of fiscal restraint that's
 
06:36:05.448 --> 06:36:05.458 align:start position:0%
going on I am I'm just really not
 
06:36:07.850 --> 06:36:07.860 align:start position:0%
interested in providing
 
06:36:11.570 --> 06:36:11.580 align:start position:0%
any more dollars in that Avenue until I
 
06:36:14.330 --> 06:36:14.340 align:start position:0%
can see some sort of willingness on the
 
06:36:17.270 --> 06:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
part of the school districts to do what
 
06:36:18.708 --> 06:36:18.718 align:start position:0%
everybody else in the town side of
 
06:36:20.990 --> 06:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
government has done and that is really
 
06:36:23.208 --> 06:36:23.218 align:start position:0%
look at things and do what's necessary
 
06:36:31.010 --> 06:36:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:33.470 --> 06:36:33.480 align:start position:0%
the fire department as an example
 
06:36:35.150 --> 06:36:35.160 align:start position:0%
and how they didn't want to pay for
 
06:36:37.490 --> 06:36:37.500 align:start position:0%
other people's fire department and
 
06:36:38.930 --> 06:36:38.940 align:start position:0%
police department
 
06:36:42.590 --> 06:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
so again I go back to We Are One
 
06:36:42.600 --> 06:36:43.730 align:start position:0%
so again I go back to We Are One
community

06:36:43.730 --> 06:36:43.740 align:start position:0%
community
 
06:36:47.830 --> 06:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
and you have the feeling of unrestraint
 
06:36:50.750 --> 06:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
budget expansion by the school on your
 
06:36:50.760 --> 06:36:51.770 align:start position:0%
budget expansion by the school on your
part

06:36:51.770 --> 06:36:51.780 align:start position:0%
part
 
06:36:51.780 --> 06:36:53.690 align:start position:0%
part
Maybe

06:36:53.690 --> 06:36:53.700 align:start position:0%
Maybe
 
06:36:56.628 --> 06:36:56.638 align:start position:0%
has is not may not be based on data
 
06:36:58.970 --> 06:36:58.980 align:start position:0%
because it's certainly not true in my
 
06:37:00.288 --> 06:37:00.298 align:start position:0%
school district
 
06:37:02.330 --> 06:37:02.340 align:start position:0%
and many school districts on the
 
06:37:05.448 --> 06:37:05.458 align:start position:0%
Seacoast so I'm I'm I I am very
 
06:37:07.610 --> 06:37:07.620 align:start position:0%
concerned about these broad statements
 
06:37:10.310 --> 06:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
that are made without data
 
06:37:13.868 --> 06:37:13.878 align:start position:0%
and I don't support that Amendment
 
06:37:19.250 --> 06:37:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:22.730 --> 06:37:22.740 align:start position:0%
um I just uh I agree with what uh
 
06:37:25.010 --> 06:37:25.020 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson said and I will
 
06:37:27.470 --> 06:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
add that uh
 
06:37:29.208 --> 06:37:29.218 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
06:37:29.218 --> 06:37:30.830 align:start position:0%
um you know
prefer

06:37:30.830 --> 06:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
prefer
 
06:37:33.170 --> 06:37:33.180 align:start position:0%
none of the money on the state budget if
 
06:37:38.810 --> 06:37:38.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:44.628 --> 06:37:44.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:44.638 --> 06:37:45.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:37:45.470 --> 06:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:37:47.510 --> 06:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm
 
06:37:50.150 --> 06:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
just skip over me okay representative
 
06:37:50.160 --> 06:37:51.410 align:start position:0%
just skip over me okay representative
O'Brien

06:37:51.410 --> 06:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
O'Brien
 
06:37:51.420 --> 06:37:52.250 align:start position:0%
O'Brien
yeah

06:37:52.250 --> 06:37:52.260 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:37:56.330 --> 06:37:56.340 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh and with the
 
06:37:59.270 --> 06:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
deepest of respect to my
 
06:38:01.910 --> 06:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
fellow representative representative
 
06:38:07.070 --> 06:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
Pearson uh with his bill I think by his
 
06:38:09.410 --> 06:38:09.420 align:start position:0%
own admission what he has just said with
 
06:38:12.048 --> 06:38:12.058 align:start position:0%
the school department is his entitled
 
06:38:16.128 --> 06:38:16.138 align:start position:0%
opinion but let me Express mine when I
 
06:38:20.770 --> 06:38:20.780 align:start position:0%
wrote uh House Bill 274
 
06:38:25.190 --> 06:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
uh it was intended to give some form of
 
06:38:29.690 --> 06:38:29.700 align:start position:0%
relief to municipalities at all every
 
06:38:31.788 --> 06:38:31.798 align:start position:0%
single corner of the state from the
 
06:38:34.070 --> 06:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
Canadian border down to the
 
06:38:36.650 --> 06:38:36.660 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts border from the Atlantic
 
06:38:39.770 --> 06:38:39.780 align:start position:0%
Ocean to the state of Vermont
 
06:38:39.780 --> 06:38:41.150 align:start position:0%
Ocean to the state of Vermont
now

06:38:41.150 --> 06:38:41.160 align:start position:0%
now
 
06:38:43.368 --> 06:38:43.378 align:start position:0%
the thing is if you have a particular
 
06:38:45.048 --> 06:38:45.058 align:start position:0%
issue with your particular Community
 
06:38:48.288 --> 06:38:48.298 align:start position:0%
that's why we have elections but I'd
 
06:38:51.890 --> 06:38:51.900 align:start position:0%
much rather stay focused right on what
 
06:38:55.010 --> 06:38:55.020 align:start position:0%
274 does
 
06:38:58.250 --> 06:38:58.260 align:start position:0%
as we know we discussed before the state
 
06:39:00.948 --> 06:39:00.958 align:start position:0%
used to pay 35 percent it was teared
 
06:39:03.708 --> 06:39:03.718 align:start position:0%
down to zero since the 10 years it's
 
06:39:06.530 --> 06:39:06.540 align:start position:0%
been teared down to zeros municipalities
 
06:39:09.230 --> 06:39:09.240 align:start position:0%
had to face this burden of making up the
 
06:39:12.410 --> 06:39:12.420 align:start position:0%
difference the structure of the nhrs and
 
06:39:14.570 --> 06:39:14.580 align:start position:0%
the contribution rates didn't really
 
06:39:17.270 --> 06:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
change that much the only thing the only
 
06:39:19.788 --> 06:39:19.798 align:start position:0%
person that got a break was the state in
 
06:39:22.070 --> 06:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire now I'm going to use
 
06:39:25.128 --> 06:39:25.138 align:start position:0%
Nashua as the example and you can refer
 
06:39:27.048 --> 06:39:27.058 align:start position:0%
this to your own particular communities
 
06:39:29.390 --> 06:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
although nashua's numbers will probably
 
06:39:33.288 --> 06:39:33.298 align:start position:0%
be bigger Manchester's may be a little
 
06:39:35.750 --> 06:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
bit bigger than nashua's but they're all
 
06:39:37.970 --> 06:39:37.980 align:start position:0%
comparatively the same
 
06:39:37.980 --> 06:39:40.570 align:start position:0%
comparatively the same
foreign

06:39:40.570 --> 06:39:40.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:42.490 --> 06:39:42.500 align:start position:0%
we have
 
06:39:45.530 --> 06:39:45.540 align:start position:0%
180 police officers that are in the New
 
06:39:47.570 --> 06:39:47.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Retirement System
 
06:39:52.310 --> 06:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh we have 165 uh firefighters in the
 
06:39:54.530 --> 06:39:54.540 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire retirement system and we
 
06:39:54.540 --> 06:39:55.690 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire retirement system and we
have

06:39:55.690 --> 06:39:55.700 align:start position:0%
have
 
06:39:59.390 --> 06:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
950 teachers now as we look at the
 
06:40:01.910 --> 06:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
Pearson's Amendment the Pearson's
 
06:40:04.430 --> 06:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
amendment is going to remove the
 
06:40:07.430 --> 06:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
majority of the largest chair
 
06:40:11.090 --> 06:40:11.100 align:start position:0%
out of this supposedly given the break
 
06:40:15.110 --> 06:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
to attack to your constituents who pay
 
06:40:15.120 --> 06:40:16.368 align:start position:0%
to attack to your constituents who pay
taxes

06:40:16.368 --> 06:40:16.378 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
06:40:19.070 --> 06:40:19.080 align:start position:0%
as in the example as we heard from the
 
06:40:20.570 --> 06:40:20.580 align:start position:0%
mayor of Nashua
 
06:40:22.448 --> 06:40:22.458 align:start position:0%
and that example
 
06:40:26.330 --> 06:40:26.340 align:start position:0%
4.4 million dollars of taxpayers money
 
06:40:28.788 --> 06:40:28.798 align:start position:0%
is going to the New Hampshire Retirement
 
06:40:28.798 --> 06:40:30.170 align:start position:0%
is going to the New Hampshire Retirement
System

06:40:30.170 --> 06:40:30.180 align:start position:0%
System
 
06:40:34.548 --> 06:40:34.558 align:start position:0%
so therefore let's look what is in the
 
06:40:38.390 --> 06:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
example nashua's contribution rate the
 
06:40:39.670 --> 06:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
police pay
 
06:40:41.890 --> 06:40:41.900 align:start position:0%
338 uh
 
06:40:46.010 --> 06:40:46.020 align:start position:0%
thousand uh dollars the fireplace 262
 
06:40:49.190 --> 06:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars with the combination of
 
06:40:51.948 --> 06:40:51.958 align:start position:0%
adding those numbers up of basically six
 
06:40:54.170 --> 06:40:54.180 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars the teacher
 
06:40:57.350 --> 06:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
switches group one is six hundred and
 
06:41:00.970 --> 06:41:00.980 align:start position:0%
forty eight thousand now you'll say geez
 
06:41:03.110 --> 06:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien you gave us
 
06:41:04.750 --> 06:41:04.760 align:start position:0%
numbers that there was
 
06:41:08.030 --> 06:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
950 teachers again that's the largest
 
06:41:10.610 --> 06:41:10.620 align:start position:0%
group but let's keep in mind the
 
06:41:14.390 --> 06:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
teachers only pay seven percent into the
 
06:41:16.850 --> 06:41:16.860 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire retirement system police
 
06:41:19.070 --> 06:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
and fire be in group two and that's why
 
06:41:21.530 --> 06:41:21.540 align:start position:0%
the difference of group two and not to
 
06:41:23.930 --> 06:41:23.940 align:start position:0%
be co-mingled or anything or confused
 
06:41:27.670 --> 06:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
with group one uh basically pays
 
06:41:31.970 --> 06:41:31.980 align:start position:0%
basically a little self of 13 12 point
 
06:41:31.980 --> 06:41:33.350 align:start position:0%
basically a little self of 13 12 point
something

06:41:33.350 --> 06:41:33.360 align:start position:0%
something
 
06:41:37.670 --> 06:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
now how's this affected uh this will
 
06:41:39.830 --> 06:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
greatly affect like I say the city in
 
06:41:39.840 --> 06:41:40.970 align:start position:0%
greatly affect like I say the city in
Nashua

06:41:40.970 --> 06:41:40.980 align:start position:0%
Nashua
 
06:41:44.090 --> 06:41:44.100 align:start position:0%
it will affect your community Manchester
 
06:41:47.330 --> 06:41:47.340 align:start position:0%
everybody else because basically the
 
06:41:49.610 --> 06:41:49.620 align:start position:0%
Nashua tax rate as compared to everybody
 
06:41:49.620 --> 06:41:50.810 align:start position:0%
Nashua tax rate as compared to everybody
else

06:41:50.810 --> 06:41:50.820 align:start position:0%
else
 
06:41:52.490 --> 06:41:52.500 align:start position:0%
you raise
 
06:41:55.850 --> 06:41:55.860 align:start position:0%
the uh two million dollars seems to be
 
06:41:59.150 --> 06:41:59.160 align:start position:0%
what raises the tax rate one percent now
 
06:42:01.250 --> 06:42:01.260 align:start position:0%
if you should happen to live in a
 
06:42:01.260 --> 06:42:02.448 align:start position:0%
if you should happen to live in a
community

06:42:02.448 --> 06:42:02.458 align:start position:0%
community
 
06:42:06.288 --> 06:42:06.298 align:start position:0%
where your individual town uh has
 
06:42:09.830 --> 06:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
smaller than compared to Nashua you do
 
06:42:13.070 --> 06:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
pay teachers in the New Hampshire
 
06:42:15.830 --> 06:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
retirement system you might even have
 
06:42:19.628 --> 06:42:19.638 align:start position:0%
police officers you may not have
 
06:42:22.970 --> 06:42:22.980 align:start position:0%
165 offices in your community but you
 
06:42:26.090 --> 06:42:26.100 align:start position:0%
may have a few you may have five so you
 
06:42:27.470 --> 06:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
are paying
 
06:42:29.868 --> 06:42:29.878 align:start position:0%
within the percentages because nobody
 
06:42:32.150 --> 06:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
gets the break with into the New
 
06:42:34.670 --> 06:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire time system if you're
 
06:42:37.368 --> 06:42:37.378 align:start position:0%
fortunate or unfortunate I would say
 
06:42:40.850 --> 06:42:40.860 align:start position:0%
fortunate to have volunteer firefighters
 
06:42:43.310 --> 06:42:43.320 align:start position:0%
then you're not paying anything into the
 
06:42:45.310 --> 06:42:45.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire retirement system because
 
06:42:49.070 --> 06:42:49.080 align:start position:0%
as in the volunteer status uh they don't
 
06:42:50.390 --> 06:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
contribute to the New Hampshire
 
06:42:52.850 --> 06:42:52.860 align:start position:0%
retirement system but again if you have
 
06:42:55.310 --> 06:42:55.320 align:start position:0%
teachers and if you have police officers
 
06:42:57.948 --> 06:42:57.958 align:start position:0%
you are making that contribution into
 
06:43:00.650 --> 06:43:00.660 align:start position:0%
the uh New Hampshire retirement system
 
06:43:03.650 --> 06:43:03.660 align:start position:0%
so based upon those numbers
 
06:43:06.288 --> 06:43:06.298 align:start position:0%
I don't want you to follow down the
 
06:43:08.330 --> 06:43:08.340 align:start position:0%
rabbit hole of
 
06:43:11.628 --> 06:43:11.638 align:start position:0%
what 274 is supposed to do if you
 
06:43:15.288 --> 06:43:15.298 align:start position:0%
believe like I do the intention of this
 
06:43:18.110 --> 06:43:18.120 align:start position:0%
bill was to give a break to
 
06:43:18.120 --> 06:43:20.270 align:start position:0%
bill was to give a break to
municipalities

06:43:20.270 --> 06:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
06:43:22.670 --> 06:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
of the attacks burden into the New
 
06:43:25.310 --> 06:43:25.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system and we only
 
06:43:30.110 --> 06:43:30.120 align:start position:0%
asked for five percent which was prudent
 
06:43:31.970 --> 06:43:31.980 align:start position:0%
and judicial
 
06:43:35.448 --> 06:43:35.458 align:start position:0%
keep in mind originally the state paid
 
06:43:39.230 --> 06:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
the 35 percent so I feel when I authored
 
06:43:42.230 --> 06:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
this bill I didn't come in high on a hog
 
06:43:44.810 --> 06:43:44.820 align:start position:0%
with it I think I came in with a
 
06:43:48.048 --> 06:43:48.058 align:start position:0%
reasonable dollar amount that would be
 
06:43:52.368 --> 06:43:52.378 align:start position:0%
prudent and uh I want you to keep that
 
06:43:54.770 --> 06:43:54.780 align:start position:0%
in mind as you consider the vote on this
 
06:43:57.830 --> 06:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
that this was a prudent intent attempt
 
06:44:01.010 --> 06:44:01.020 align:start position:0%
to alleviate the tax burden
 
06:44:03.670 --> 06:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
that was downshifted to the
 
06:44:07.250 --> 06:44:07.260 align:start position:0%
municipalities and thus got downshifted
 
06:44:10.730 --> 06:44:10.740 align:start position:0%
into the uh the taxpayers of your
 
06:44:14.510 --> 06:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
community so I urge you all to vote with
 
06:44:17.510 --> 06:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
me to shoot down uh representative
 
06:44:19.610 --> 06:44:19.620 align:start position:0%
Pearsons I think well-intentioned
 
06:44:19.620 --> 06:44:20.930 align:start position:0%
Pearsons I think well-intentioned
Amendment

06:44:20.930 --> 06:44:20.940 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
06:44:24.350 --> 06:44:24.360 align:start position:0%
but to shoot that down let me see my
 
06:44:27.470 --> 06:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
subsequent emotion could be made to
 
06:44:31.610 --> 06:44:31.620 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on 274 Standalone I thank
 
06:44:33.948 --> 06:44:33.958 align:start position:0%
you madam chair thank you thank you
 
06:44:33.958 --> 06:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
you madam chair thank you thank you
representative

06:44:35.040 --> 06:44:35.050 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:44:35.050 --> 06:44:36.770 align:start position:0%
representative
[Music]

06:44:36.770 --> 06:44:36.780 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:44:39.170 --> 06:44:39.180 align:start position:0%
I uh
 
06:44:40.970 --> 06:44:40.980 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
 
06:44:44.030 --> 06:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien I am uh I am a
 
06:44:45.830 --> 06:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
student of the
 
06:44:48.288 --> 06:44:48.298 align:start position:0%
of the history of the state pension
 
06:44:49.850 --> 06:44:49.860 align:start position:0%
system that's something I've really
 
06:44:53.270 --> 06:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
worked on myself if I had assurances
 
06:44:56.090 --> 06:44:56.100 align:start position:0%
that this would provide tax relief
 
06:44:58.730 --> 06:44:58.740 align:start position:0%
I would love this the problem is is that
 
06:45:01.548 --> 06:45:01.558 align:start position:0%
historically and I can be from dairy and
 
06:45:03.530 --> 06:45:03.540 align:start position:0%
being virtually a
 
06:45:04.910 --> 06:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
outside of college pretty much a
 
06:45:06.948 --> 06:45:06.958 align:start position:0%
lifelong resident of dairy the history
 
06:45:09.288 --> 06:45:09.298 align:start position:0%
shows me otherwise that the taxpayers
 
06:45:10.850 --> 06:45:10.860 align:start position:0%
will not see this
 
06:45:12.830 --> 06:45:12.840 align:start position:0%
as a relief at all
 
06:45:12.840 --> 06:45:14.390 align:start position:0%
as a relief at all
and

06:45:14.390 --> 06:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:45:17.690 --> 06:45:17.700 align:start position:0%
so I embrace the concept of that and I I
 
06:45:21.830 --> 06:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
applaud you for for recognizing
 
06:45:23.628 --> 06:45:23.638 align:start position:0%
the situation
 
06:45:25.548 --> 06:45:25.558 align:start position:0%
because it is a situation
 
06:45:27.770 --> 06:45:27.780 align:start position:0%
I don't have a historical context within
 
06:45:29.930 --> 06:45:29.940 align:start position:0%
my own Community to have that faith and
 
06:45:33.410 --> 06:45:33.420 align:start position:0%
I'll give you an example since 1996 this
 
06:45:34.788 --> 06:45:34.798 align:start position:0%
enrollment in the dairy school district
 
06:45:37.610 --> 06:45:37.620 align:start position:0%
has gone down every year since 1996. we
 
06:45:39.048 --> 06:45:39.058 align:start position:0%
have a thousand less students in k
 
06:45:41.390 --> 06:45:41.400 align:start position:0%
through eight than we did 20 years ago
 
06:45:43.730 --> 06:45:43.740 align:start position:0%
which would equate to around an 8
 
06:45:45.288 --> 06:45:45.298 align:start position:0%
million dollar decrease in our budget
 
06:45:47.990 --> 06:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
our School District budget is up 16
 
06:45:51.170 --> 06:45:51.180 align:start position:0%
million dollars so I have no faith and
 
06:45:53.628 --> 06:45:53.638 align:start position:0%
confidence whatsoever that this money is
 
06:45:55.548 --> 06:45:55.558 align:start position:0%
going to be used for tax relief and I'm
 
06:45:58.010 --> 06:45:58.020 align:start position:0%
and I it's I don't profess to know what
 
06:45:59.750 --> 06:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
the other communities are specifically
 
06:46:02.208 --> 06:46:02.218 align:start position:0%
doing but when I see things in the city
 
06:46:03.708 --> 06:46:03.718 align:start position:0%
of Manchester where reports are coming
 
06:46:05.330 --> 06:46:05.340 align:start position:0%
out telling them they need to mothball
 
06:46:07.548 --> 06:46:07.558 align:start position:0%
High School in three elementary schools
 
06:46:10.368 --> 06:46:10.378 align:start position:0%
and here we are with them not doing it
 
06:46:12.770 --> 06:46:12.780 align:start position:0%
I just I'm seeing just too much of this
 
06:46:15.288 --> 06:46:15.298 align:start position:0%
to lack the faith to go along with the
 
06:46:17.868 --> 06:46:17.878 align:start position:0%
concept that that is the origin of this
 
06:46:19.968 --> 06:46:19.978 align:start position:0%
representative Brian and uh again I
 
06:46:22.070 --> 06:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate your angle on it I really do
 
06:46:23.990 --> 06:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
and I do recognize it and I wish it was
 
06:46:27.048 --> 06:46:27.058 align:start position:0%
true it's just in my mind it isn't
 
06:46:27.058 --> 06:46:31.730 align:start position:0%
true it's just in my mind it isn't
it

06:46:31.730 --> 06:46:31.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:33.650 --> 06:46:33.660 align:start position:0%
just wanted to ask representative
 
06:46:36.770 --> 06:46:36.780 align:start position:0%
Pearson why he didn't instead of um
 
06:46:40.510 --> 06:46:40.520 align:start position:0%
selecting only some of the
 
06:46:43.548 --> 06:46:43.558 align:start position:0%
retiree one of the retiree regroups and
 
06:46:45.770 --> 06:46:45.780 align:start position:0%
not the both of them why didn't he just
 
06:46:51.670 --> 06:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:51.680 --> 06:46:54.468 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

06:46:54.468 --> 06:46:54.478 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:46:56.868 --> 06:46:56.878 align:start position:0%
because my my lack of confidence and the
 
06:47:00.048 --> 06:47:00.058 align:start position:0%
ability to to have this actually help
 
06:47:02.510 --> 06:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer is irrespective of a
 
06:47:05.330 --> 06:47:05.340 align:start position:0%
percentage it is it is the philosophy to
 
06:47:08.030 --> 06:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
which I have seen go forward for the
 
06:47:10.730 --> 06:47:10.740 align:start position:0%
last 20 years so within this within
 
06:47:14.330 --> 06:47:14.340 align:start position:0%
group especially the education wise so
 
06:47:17.750 --> 06:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
you know where where the education gets
 
06:47:19.368 --> 06:47:19.378 align:start position:0%
more attention in the state of New
 
06:47:21.468 --> 06:47:21.478 align:start position:0%
Hampshire than anything else anything
 
06:47:23.810 --> 06:47:23.820 align:start position:0%
else to the point where we have towns
 
06:47:26.810 --> 06:47:26.820 align:start position:0%
that have sau's offices that have larger
 
06:47:28.548 --> 06:47:28.558 align:start position:0%
budgets than their entire town
 
06:47:28.558 --> 06:47:30.230 align:start position:0%
budgets than their entire town
government

06:47:30.230 --> 06:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
government
 
06:47:32.208 --> 06:47:32.218 align:start position:0%
there is a line that needs to be drawn
 
06:47:34.190 --> 06:47:34.200 align:start position:0%
and frankly I've had enough I just have
 
06:47:35.990 --> 06:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
had enough
 
06:47:36.000 --> 06:47:37.250 align:start position:0%
had enough
follow-up

06:47:37.250 --> 06:47:37.260 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
06:47:39.410 --> 06:47:39.420 align:start position:0%
follow up please
 
06:47:41.628 --> 06:47:41.638 align:start position:0%
representative Pierce
 
06:47:45.410 --> 06:47:45.420 align:start position:0%
son with the with the ex exception of
 
06:47:48.890 --> 06:47:48.900 align:start position:0%
the two largest cities in the state it
 
06:47:52.430 --> 06:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
has always absolutely always been the
 
06:47:55.850 --> 06:47:55.860 align:start position:0%
case that the schools cost more than the
 
06:47:58.490 --> 06:47:58.500 align:start position:0%
municipal side of the budget that's
 
06:48:00.890 --> 06:48:00.900 align:start position:0%
that's just how it is there are far more
 
06:48:04.430 --> 06:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
employees of cities and towns that work
 
06:48:06.830 --> 06:48:06.840 align:start position:0%
for the school system it's just what the
 
06:48:08.868 --> 06:48:08.878 align:start position:0%
job is representative fellas I don't
 
06:48:11.230 --> 06:48:11.240 align:start position:0%
mean this the schools as a whole I'm
 
06:48:14.868 --> 06:48:14.878 align:start position:0%
specifically referring to just the SAU
 
06:48:18.350 --> 06:48:18.360 align:start position:0%
office of some of these towns have
 
06:48:21.110 --> 06:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
massive budgets that that are rivaling
 
06:48:24.230 --> 06:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
their own entire town budgets so I I get
 
06:48:25.910 --> 06:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
the fact that the schools are up they're
 
06:48:27.948 --> 06:48:27.958 align:start position:0%
obviously they're typically your Town's
 
06:48:30.708 --> 06:48:30.718 align:start position:0%
largest employer and certainly from an
 
06:48:33.530 --> 06:48:33.540 align:start position:0%
employee standpoint dwarf any other of
 
06:48:35.330 --> 06:48:35.340 align:start position:0%
the Town side of things combined there's
 
06:48:38.090 --> 06:48:38.100 align:start position:0%
no question for that it's just the we've
 
06:48:39.170 --> 06:48:39.180 align:start position:0%
gotten to the point where just the
 
06:48:42.048 --> 06:48:42.058 align:start position:0%
administration of schools has become so
 
06:48:42.058 --> 06:48:44.448 align:start position:0%
administration of schools has become so
grossly

06:48:44.448 --> 06:48:44.458 align:start position:0%
grossly
 
06:48:46.730 --> 06:48:46.740 align:start position:0%
inflated that and this isn't even
 
06:48:48.468 --> 06:48:48.478 align:start position:0%
translating down to the classrooms so
 
06:48:50.390 --> 06:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
I'm just I cannot
 
06:48:52.490 --> 06:48:52.500 align:start position:0%
I cannot stomach just continuously
 
06:48:54.708 --> 06:48:54.718 align:start position:0%
throwing money in here without seeing
 
06:48:57.770 --> 06:48:57.780 align:start position:0%
some kind of results in some kind of
 
06:48:59.750 --> 06:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
restraint on the part of these school
 
06:49:01.968 --> 06:49:01.978 align:start position:0%
boards where I'm looking at Emergency
 
06:49:04.670 --> 06:49:04.680 align:start position:0%
Services doing everything they can doing
 
06:49:07.968 --> 06:49:07.978 align:start position:0%
less than most with more
 
06:49:11.708 --> 06:49:11.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:16.368 --> 06:49:16.378 align:start position:0%
and and really taking taking the hits
 
06:49:18.770 --> 06:49:18.780 align:start position:0%
and then when they save a nickel to
 
06:49:20.690 --> 06:49:20.700 align:start position:0%
school spending the dime
 
06:49:22.548 --> 06:49:22.558 align:start position:0%
I'm drawing the line I've just had it
 
06:49:24.410 --> 06:49:24.420 align:start position:0%
and and I think that those that are
 
06:49:25.910 --> 06:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
doing the right thing that are really
 
06:49:27.948 --> 06:49:27.958 align:start position:0%
trying their best deserve to have some
 
06:49:30.708 --> 06:49:30.718 align:start position:0%
sort of could be on the state's part to
 
06:49:33.530 --> 06:49:33.540 align:start position:0%
to acknowledge that and those that are
 
06:49:35.208 --> 06:49:35.218 align:start position:0%
not don't deserve it
 
06:49:35.218 --> 06:49:36.590 align:start position:0%
not don't deserve it
and

06:49:36.590 --> 06:49:36.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:49:41.690 --> 06:49:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:41.700 --> 06:49:43.968 align:start position:0%
 
yes

06:49:43.968 --> 06:49:43.978 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:49:46.930 --> 06:49:46.940 align:start position:0%
um I I am quite amazed
 
06:49:50.090 --> 06:49:50.100 align:start position:0%
that in a discussion about the state's
 
06:49:52.548 --> 06:49:52.558 align:start position:0%
obligation to support the retirement
 
06:49:52.558 --> 06:49:53.890 align:start position:0%
obligation to support the retirement
system

06:49:53.890 --> 06:49:53.900 align:start position:0%
system
 
06:49:57.890 --> 06:49:57.900 align:start position:0%
that this has devolved into a discussion
 
06:50:00.948 --> 06:50:00.958 align:start position:0%
of SAU budgets that is really a huge
 
06:50:04.850 --> 06:50:04.860 align:start position:0%
step stretch my imagination thank you
 
06:50:06.830 --> 06:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of money in SIU budgets
 
06:50:09.590 --> 06:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
representative Allegro well I I like
 
06:50:11.330 --> 06:50:11.340 align:start position:0%
this amendment and I think it's a good
 
06:50:14.208 --> 06:50:14.218 align:start position:0%
resolution to the impasse that we may
 
06:50:16.750 --> 06:50:16.760 align:start position:0%
have reached and here's why
 
06:50:19.070 --> 06:50:19.080 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding the idea that we're all
 
06:50:21.650 --> 06:50:21.660 align:start position:0%
the same we are dealing with separate
 
06:50:23.030 --> 06:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
entities here right we're dealing with
 
06:50:25.070 --> 06:50:25.080 align:start position:0%
the school districts versus the
 
06:50:28.910 --> 06:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities in our case you have one
 
06:50:31.270 --> 06:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
group typing their belt and the other
 
06:50:33.830 --> 06:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
group you have for continuation from
 
06:50:36.048 --> 06:50:36.058 align:start position:0%
slicked spending
 
06:50:38.270 --> 06:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
and where separate entities in another
 
06:50:41.090 --> 06:50:41.100 align:start position:0%
sense as well I'm here representing
 
06:50:43.730 --> 06:50:43.740 align:start position:0%
my constituents from Camden
 
06:50:46.788 --> 06:50:46.798 align:start position:0%
not from Ashmore so I have to go back to
 
06:50:46.798 --> 06:50:47.810 align:start position:0%
not from Ashmore so I have to go back to
Canton

06:50:47.810 --> 06:50:47.820 align:start position:0%
Canton
 
06:50:51.410 --> 06:50:51.420 align:start position:0%
theoretically speaking and explain
 
06:50:53.330 --> 06:50:53.340 align:start position:0%
to the constituents there to the
 
06:50:55.010 --> 06:50:55.020 align:start position:0%
residents of Canton
 
06:50:57.530 --> 06:50:57.540 align:start position:0%
why they're picking up the tab for the
 
06:50:59.090 --> 06:50:59.100 align:start position:0%
profligated spending
 
06:51:02.628 --> 06:51:02.638 align:start position:0%
in the National School District and so I
 
06:51:05.570 --> 06:51:05.580 align:start position:0%
think that this distinction
 
06:51:08.930 --> 06:51:08.940 align:start position:0%
allows us to bring relief to one entity
 
06:51:11.510 --> 06:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
that has been tightening their belt as I
 
06:51:13.548 --> 06:51:13.558 align:start position:0%
understand it
 
06:51:13.558 --> 06:51:15.288 align:start position:0%
understand it
but

06:51:15.288 --> 06:51:15.298 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:51:15.298 --> 06:51:16.250 align:start position:0%
but
um

06:51:16.250 --> 06:51:16.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:51:19.368 --> 06:51:19.378 align:start position:0%
brings the reality of responsibility
 
06:51:22.910 --> 06:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
to the to the other and who has not
 
06:51:26.890 --> 06:51:26.900 align:start position:0%
so I'll be supporting this
 
06:51:29.690 --> 06:51:29.700 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean the reason to bring in uh
 
06:51:31.610 --> 06:51:31.620 align:start position:0%
yes are you uh spending on school
 
06:51:31.620 --> 06:51:32.690 align:start position:0%
yes are you uh spending on school
spending

06:51:32.690 --> 06:51:32.700 align:start position:0%
spending
 
06:51:35.330 --> 06:51:35.340 align:start position:0%
is that under their spending and the
 
06:51:37.788 --> 06:51:37.798 align:start position:0%
number of employees that hire has an
 
06:51:40.548 --> 06:51:40.558 align:start position:0%
influence on what the country cost is
 
06:51:42.170 --> 06:51:42.180 align:start position:0%
and therefore what the state's gonna
 
06:51:44.930 --> 06:51:44.940 align:start position:0%
have to pay for it yet football we don't
 
06:51:48.468 --> 06:51:48.478 align:start position:0%
have any direct control over that and uh
 
06:51:50.510 --> 06:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
you know we have we're concerned that
 
06:51:52.730 --> 06:51:52.740 align:start position:0%
that they're not being responsible in
 
06:51:55.310 --> 06:51:55.320 align:start position:0%
that regard and therefore
 
06:51:57.948 --> 06:51:57.958 align:start position:0%
um you know I'm not comfortable
 
06:51:59.690 --> 06:51:59.700 align:start position:0%
um you know putting us on the hook for
 
06:51:59.700 --> 06:52:00.948 align:start position:0%
um you know putting us on the hook for
further

06:52:00.948 --> 06:52:00.958 align:start position:0%
further
 
06:52:02.628 --> 06:52:02.638 align:start position:0%
in my view uncontrolled and
 
06:52:02.638 --> 06:52:04.788 align:start position:0%
in my view uncontrolled and
irresponsible

06:52:04.788 --> 06:52:04.798 align:start position:0%
irresponsible
 
06:52:07.310 --> 06:52:07.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Schultz and
 
06:52:08.868 --> 06:52:08.878 align:start position:0%
representative Bryant you've already
 
06:52:10.730 --> 06:52:10.740 align:start position:0%
spoken twice so I'm going to let people
 
06:52:15.230 --> 06:52:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:17.150 --> 06:52:17.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
06:52:19.128 --> 06:52:19.138 align:start position:0%
um my question for representative
 
06:52:20.868 --> 06:52:20.878 align:start position:0%
Pearson is
 
06:52:24.230 --> 06:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
given that pensions are a promise
 
06:52:26.930 --> 06:52:26.940 align:start position:0%
and given that that promise has been
 
06:52:31.490 --> 06:52:31.500 align:start position:0%
made as well to local cities and towns
 
06:52:33.010 --> 06:52:33.020 align:start position:0%
from the state
 
06:52:36.948 --> 06:52:36.958 align:start position:0%
given that that promise is is also for
 
06:52:41.270 --> 06:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
you as a firefighter isn't it perilous
 
06:52:44.628 --> 06:52:44.638 align:start position:0%
to forego the
 
06:52:47.270 --> 06:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
um Promises to the teachers too wouldn't
 
06:52:50.810 --> 06:52:50.820 align:start position:0%
you want to As A Firefighter support all
 
06:52:53.390 --> 06:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
public employees pensions that are
 
06:52:58.430 --> 06:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:01.368 --> 06:53:01.378 align:start position:0%
uh representative Schultz you're getting
 
06:53:04.250 --> 06:53:04.260 align:start position:0%
very close to impugning his motives and
 
06:53:06.070 --> 06:53:06.080 align:start position:0%
we don't allow that
 
06:53:08.448 --> 06:53:08.458 align:start position:0%
let me see if I can rephrase it here's
 
06:53:10.430 --> 06:53:10.440 align:start position:0%
what I I didn't mean to do that I see
 
06:53:12.110 --> 06:53:12.120 align:start position:0%
what you're saying
 
06:53:12.120 --> 06:53:12.890 align:start position:0%
what you're saying
um

06:53:12.890 --> 06:53:12.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:53:15.948 --> 06:53:15.958 align:start position:0%
and I will say that this this bill does
 
06:53:17.330 --> 06:53:17.340 align:start position:0%
not affect
 
06:53:20.810 --> 06:53:20.820 align:start position:0%
any benefits or pension
 
06:53:24.410 --> 06:53:24.420 align:start position:0%
results or contributions by any employee
 
06:53:27.048 --> 06:53:27.058 align:start position:0%
all it affects is who is paying the
 
06:53:30.110 --> 06:53:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:33.350 --> 06:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
enough I the concern I have though is
 
06:53:36.048 --> 06:53:36.058 align:start position:0%
when we start to parse this out
 
06:53:38.628 --> 06:53:38.638 align:start position:0%
and we start to pick a part what has
 
06:53:40.310 --> 06:53:40.320 align:start position:0%
been promised
 
06:53:42.230 --> 06:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
it really does
 
06:53:44.628 --> 06:53:44.638 align:start position:0%
pit groups against each other that
 
06:53:46.430 --> 06:53:46.440 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be pitted against each other
 
06:53:48.890 --> 06:53:48.900 align:start position:0%
is really what I'm trying to say whether
 
06:53:51.350 --> 06:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
it's the promises we've made
 
06:53:53.990 --> 06:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
to public employees who are public
 
06:53:57.170 --> 06:53:57.180 align:start position:0%
servants who I feel are underpaid but
 
06:54:00.048 --> 06:54:00.058 align:start position:0%
these promises should be met or the
 
06:54:04.368 --> 06:54:04.378 align:start position:0%
taxpayers uh paying property taxes that
 
06:54:08.690 --> 06:54:08.700 align:start position:0%
are struggling I hate to see any of our
 
06:54:12.590 --> 06:54:12.600 align:start position:0%
Public Services of what we offer to our
 
06:54:14.810 --> 06:54:14.820 align:start position:0%
communities also be thrown under the bus
 
06:54:14.820 --> 06:54:16.208 align:start position:0%
communities also be thrown under the bus
and

06:54:16.208 --> 06:54:16.218 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:54:19.610 --> 06:54:19.620 align:start position:0%
I well I oppose this amendment because
 
06:54:20.868 --> 06:54:20.878 align:start position:0%
of that
 
06:54:20.878 --> 06:54:21.430 align:start position:0%
of that
um

06:54:21.430 --> 06:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:54:23.990 --> 06:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
more time to debate just Steve and I
 
06:54:28.010 --> 06:54:28.020 align:start position:0%
over lunch but it is as it is
 
06:54:31.310 --> 06:54:31.320 align:start position:0%
so so to to to add a historical context
 
06:54:33.708 --> 06:54:33.718 align:start position:0%
here because I did tell you that I am
 
06:54:35.930 --> 06:54:35.940 align:start position:0%
really kind of Taken upon myself to be a
 
06:54:38.990 --> 06:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
student of this if it really truly was
 
06:54:39.000 --> 06:54:39.890 align:start position:0%
student of this if it really truly was
about

06:54:39.890 --> 06:54:39.900 align:start position:0%
about
 
06:54:42.288 --> 06:54:42.298 align:start position:0%
things rising and falling together the
 
06:54:44.628 --> 06:54:44.638 align:start position:0%
pension changes in 2011 should have done
 
06:54:46.610 --> 06:54:46.620 align:start position:0%
that and they did not
 
06:54:48.770 --> 06:54:48.780 align:start position:0%
group two took a much bigger punch in
 
06:54:50.810 --> 06:54:50.820 align:start position:0%
the face than group one did in the 2011
 
06:54:52.548 --> 06:54:52.558 align:start position:0%
pension changes so we've already gone
 
06:54:54.890 --> 06:54:54.900 align:start position:0%
down that road of looking at these two
 
06:54:58.610 --> 06:54:58.620 align:start position:0%
groups separately and I I'm not I
 
06:54:58.620 --> 06:54:59.810 align:start position:0%
groups separately and I I'm not I
completely

06:54:59.810 --> 06:54:59.820 align:start position:0%
completely
 
06:55:02.448 --> 06:55:02.458 align:start position:0%
agree with your with your statement in
 
06:55:04.490 --> 06:55:04.500 align:start position:0%
reference to public employees it's no
 
06:55:06.350 --> 06:55:06.360 align:start position:0%
secret that I'm a big supporter of of
 
06:55:08.868 --> 06:55:08.878 align:start position:0%
the employees themselves my sister was a
 
06:55:10.190 --> 06:55:10.200 align:start position:0%
school teacher
 
06:55:12.948 --> 06:55:12.958 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and my my brother's a
 
06:55:14.690 --> 06:55:14.700 align:start position:0%
corrections officer so there's no
 
06:55:17.270 --> 06:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
there's no love missing from my heart
 
06:55:20.150 --> 06:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
for these people but this is this is a
 
06:55:22.490 --> 06:55:22.500 align:start position:0%
deal that has to do with the in the
 
06:55:24.650 --> 06:55:24.660 align:start position:0%
administrations of of these various
 
06:55:28.968 --> 06:55:28.978 align:start position:0%
entities and just a
 
06:55:32.270 --> 06:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
just at some point taking a stand and
 
06:55:34.610 --> 06:55:34.620 align:start position:0%
that's and it's really just his like I
 
06:55:36.890 --> 06:55:36.900 align:start position:0%
said before historically we're giving
 
06:55:39.170 --> 06:55:39.180 align:start position:0%
them a dime and they're spending a
 
06:55:41.570 --> 06:55:41.580 align:start position:0%
quarter in a that is just not
 
06:55:43.310 --> 06:55:43.320 align:start position:0%
sustainable and I just don't have the
 
06:55:44.810 --> 06:55:44.820 align:start position:0%
faith that this would equate to tax
 
06:55:46.490 --> 06:55:46.500 align:start position:0%
relief and I wish I did
 
06:55:46.500 --> 06:55:50.030 align:start position:0%
relief and I wish I did
[Music]

06:55:50.030 --> 06:55:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:50.040 --> 06:55:51.410 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:55:51.410 --> 06:55:51.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:55:54.650 --> 06:55:54.660 align:start position:0%
questions appropriate but yeah okay yeah
 
06:55:57.730 --> 06:55:57.740 align:start position:0%
debate in committee cannot be curtailed
 
06:56:02.208 --> 06:56:02.218 align:start position:0%
questions representative thought now
 
06:56:04.910 --> 06:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair I guess I just
 
06:56:07.368 --> 06:56:07.378 align:start position:0%
wanted to I'm I kind of missed the whole
 
06:56:10.548 --> 06:56:10.558 align:start position:0%
connection here between uh House Bill
 
06:56:13.548 --> 06:56:13.558 align:start position:0%
274 and and splitting the difference
 
06:56:16.548 --> 06:56:16.558 align:start position:0%
between the group one and group two
 
06:56:18.830 --> 06:56:18.840 align:start position:0%
um you know and not that I disagree at
 
06:56:21.590 --> 06:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
all I've I've been at many City Council
 
06:56:24.410 --> 06:56:24.420 align:start position:0%
meetings and and hollered and and whined
 
06:56:26.810 --> 06:56:26.820 align:start position:0%
about property taxes and where's all the
 
06:56:28.310 --> 06:56:28.320 align:start position:0%
money going and why are they spending it
 
06:56:29.750 --> 06:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
on this and that and
 
06:56:31.730 --> 06:56:31.740 align:start position:0%
Etc I don't disagree with the with
 
06:56:34.010 --> 06:56:34.020 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson on on many of
 
06:56:35.990 --> 06:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
those issues
 
06:56:36.000 --> 06:56:37.910 align:start position:0%
those issues
however

06:56:37.910 --> 06:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
however
 
06:56:40.670 --> 06:56:40.680 align:start position:0%
um I don't think two this doesn't this
 
06:56:42.590 --> 06:56:42.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't discern that at all whether you
 
06:56:45.610 --> 06:56:45.620 align:start position:0%
if you take group one out of this bill
 
06:56:47.570 --> 06:56:47.580 align:start position:0%
it doesn't
 
06:56:50.510 --> 06:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
send less money to the uh to the school
 
06:56:52.968 --> 06:56:52.978 align:start position:0%
department it it simply sends money less
 
06:56:55.548 --> 06:56:55.558 align:start position:0%
money from the state back to the
 
06:56:57.770 --> 06:56:57.780 align:start position:0%
municipality it doesn't it doesn't help
 
06:56:59.448 --> 06:56:59.458 align:start position:0%
the firefighters it doesn't help the
 
06:57:01.310 --> 06:57:01.320 align:start position:0%
policemen it doesn't hurt the teachers
 
06:57:04.490 --> 06:57:04.500 align:start position:0%
it hurts the taxpayers plain and simple
 
06:57:06.948 --> 06:57:06.958 align:start position:0%
it's it's all it's just one
 
06:57:09.770 --> 06:57:09.780 align:start position:0%
it's one some group of money going to
 
06:57:13.070 --> 06:57:13.080 align:start position:0%
the municipality and so I don't see I
 
06:57:14.510 --> 06:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
think it would have made more sense if
 
06:57:16.128 --> 06:57:16.138 align:start position:0%
you if you wanted to lower the amount of
 
06:57:18.770 --> 06:57:18.780 align:start position:0%
money to lower the percentage but I
 
06:57:21.890 --> 06:57:21.900 align:start position:0%
don't um I don't understand this uh this
 
06:57:26.628 --> 06:57:26.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:30.770 --> 06:57:30.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:33.410 --> 06:57:33.420 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
06:57:36.110 --> 06:57:36.120 align:start position:0%
I am going to oppose the amendment I
 
06:57:38.628 --> 06:57:38.638 align:start position:0%
think uh we heard from the missile
 
06:57:41.510 --> 06:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
Association and many cities and towns
 
06:57:44.628 --> 06:57:44.638 align:start position:0%
across the state looking for relief
 
06:57:47.690 --> 06:57:47.700 align:start position:0%
and looking for a small fraction of the
 
06:57:49.250 --> 06:57:49.260 align:start position:0%
promises that were made by the state of
 
06:57:52.070 --> 06:57:52.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh and covering
 
06:57:54.708 --> 06:57:54.718 align:start position:0%
parts of the costs of the cities and
 
06:57:57.530 --> 06:57:57.540 align:start position:0%
towns towards the State retirement
 
06:58:00.410 --> 06:58:00.420 align:start position:0%
system and taking one piece of that pie
 
06:58:04.010 --> 06:58:04.020 align:start position:0%
away I cannot support it's
 
06:58:06.650 --> 06:58:06.660 align:start position:0%
was group one and group two at the
 
06:58:08.150 --> 06:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
beginning and it should go back to
 
06:58:10.250 --> 06:58:10.260 align:start position:0%
remaining group one and group two when
 
06:58:12.610 --> 06:58:12.620 align:start position:0%
the state gives their
 
06:58:15.708 --> 06:58:15.718 align:start position:0%
percentage discount to the cities and
 
06:58:17.390 --> 06:58:17.400 align:start position:0%
towns so I will vote against the
 
06:58:19.390 --> 06:58:19.400 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you
 
06:58:24.110 --> 06:58:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:27.230 --> 06:58:27.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh there's a
 
06:58:30.830 --> 06:58:30.840 align:start position:0%
couple of facts uh yeah if I just would
 
06:58:32.990 --> 06:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
like to share with the committee
 
06:58:33.000 --> 06:58:33.650 align:start position:0%
like to share with the committee
um

06:58:33.650 --> 06:58:33.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:58:37.070 --> 06:58:37.080 align:start position:0%
basically as many you know uh yeah I was
 
06:58:39.410 --> 06:58:39.420 align:start position:0%
a firefighter for 35 years and you know
 
06:58:41.750 --> 06:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
I am currently a member of the New
 
06:58:43.368 --> 06:58:43.378 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system and
 
06:58:45.890 --> 06:58:45.900 align:start position:0%
receiving benefits so let's get that out
 
06:58:49.190 --> 06:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
there but I am also besides the State
 
06:58:52.010 --> 06:58:52.020 align:start position:0%
Rep I am also vice president of the
 
06:58:54.610 --> 06:58:54.620 align:start position:0%
board of aldermen for the city of Nashua
 
06:58:58.490 --> 06:58:58.500 align:start position:0%
I am on the budget committee and I am on
 
06:59:00.948 --> 06:59:00.958 align:start position:0%
the finance committee and I think when
 
06:59:03.350 --> 06:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
we get together we don't establish the
 
06:59:05.750 --> 06:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
tax rate actually the state does is
 
06:59:08.270 --> 06:59:08.280 align:start position:0%
established a tax rate but basically
 
06:59:11.030 --> 06:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
when we work in in the budget and come
 
06:59:14.390 --> 06:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
to find out what we basically do is we
 
06:59:16.968 --> 06:59:16.978 align:start position:0%
try to run the city based upon the needs
 
06:59:19.690 --> 06:59:19.700 align:start position:0%
now there was a statement that was made
 
06:59:23.150 --> 06:59:23.160 align:start position:0%
that I can't guarantee that some of
 
06:59:25.610 --> 06:59:25.620 align:start position:0%
these savings will go back well where
 
06:59:29.170 --> 06:59:29.180 align:start position:0%
would they go is the question uh
 
06:59:31.490 --> 06:59:31.500 align:start position:0%
anti-theoretically the way you run the
 
06:59:34.010 --> 06:59:34.020 align:start position:0%
city at the end of the fiscal year yeah
 
06:59:37.010 --> 06:59:37.020 align:start position:0%
you are fair in theory are not supposed
 
06:59:39.048 --> 06:59:39.058 align:start position:0%
to be sitting on millions and millions
 
06:59:42.170 --> 06:59:42.180 align:start position:0%
and millions of dollars the city is not
 
06:59:43.788 --> 06:59:43.798 align:start position:0%
a bank
 
06:59:47.270 --> 06:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to provide service to each
 
06:59:52.070 --> 06:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
community so yes we do have a rainy day
 
06:59:54.948 --> 06:59:54.958 align:start position:0%
account such as we had situations in the
 
06:59:57.410 --> 06:59:57.420 align:start position:0%
past where a school Wall fell down and
 
07:00:00.048 --> 07:00:00.058 align:start position:0%
needed to be repaired and stuff and yes
 
07:00:02.690 --> 07:00:02.700 align:start position:0%
we did take that money out of our rainy
 
07:00:05.208 --> 07:00:05.218 align:start position:0%
day account but basically when the
 
07:00:07.070 --> 07:00:07.080 align:start position:0%
question gets asked where does the money
 
07:00:11.090 --> 07:00:11.100 align:start position:0%
go it goes back into the community on
 
07:00:13.070 --> 07:00:13.080 align:start position:0%
many of the things and one of the most
 
07:00:15.350 --> 07:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
important things where will some of this
 
07:00:19.128 --> 07:00:19.138 align:start position:0%
money go by a positive vote on 274
 
07:00:21.708 --> 07:00:21.718 align:start position:0%
without this amendment in your
 
07:00:24.708 --> 07:00:24.718 align:start position:0%
communities because I asked you to talk
 
07:00:26.570 --> 07:00:26.580 align:start position:0%
to your city fathers
 
07:00:28.850 --> 07:00:28.860 align:start position:0%
and your lead is on this and I hope that
 
07:00:31.730 --> 07:00:31.740 align:start position:0%
you did but where would that money go it
 
07:00:35.270 --> 07:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
will go back into your community by not
 
07:00:37.310 --> 07:00:37.320 align:start position:0%
supporting this you might be doing
 
07:00:39.368 --> 07:00:39.378 align:start position:0%
members of your community it's a service
 
07:00:43.070 --> 07:00:43.080 align:start position:0%
you may be now there was also another
 
07:00:47.150 --> 07:00:47.160 align:start position:0%
statement that uh oh I don't know if I
 
07:00:49.010 --> 07:00:49.020 align:start position:0%
want to support Nashua with all this
 
07:00:52.250 --> 07:00:52.260 align:start position:0%
well let me take you down the road of
 
07:00:52.260 --> 07:00:54.048 align:start position:0%
well let me take you down the road of
percentages

07:00:54.048 --> 07:00:54.058 align:start position:0%
percentages
 
07:00:56.868 --> 07:00:56.878 align:start position:0%
Nashua doesn't pay more or doesn't pay
 
07:00:59.628 --> 07:00:59.638 align:start position:0%
less than your community into the New
 
07:01:02.810 --> 07:01:02.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Retirement System it pays the
 
07:01:05.570 --> 07:01:05.580 align:start position:0%
percentage of basically what the
 
07:01:08.510 --> 07:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
employee does so therefore to say one
 
07:01:10.788 --> 07:01:10.798 align:start position:0%
Community gets a better deal than
 
07:01:13.368 --> 07:01:13.378 align:start position:0%
another Community I think that's a very
 
07:01:15.110 --> 07:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
fair question that the next time Mr
 
07:01:18.170 --> 07:01:18.180 align:start position:0%
Colin comes up from nhrs that you can
 
07:01:20.868 --> 07:01:20.878 align:start position:0%
ask him he'll tell you no uh
 
07:01:23.030 --> 07:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
firefighters and police officers like I
 
07:01:25.490 --> 07:01:25.500 align:start position:0%
say pay within the 12 percentile and
 
07:01:28.010 --> 07:01:28.020 align:start position:0%
Teachers Pay within the seven percentile
 
07:01:30.770 --> 07:01:30.780 align:start position:0%
that's true all across the board in the
 
07:01:33.230 --> 07:01:33.240 align:start position:0%
whole state nobody is getting any
 
07:01:35.150 --> 07:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
special benefits
 
07:01:38.930 --> 07:01:38.940 align:start position:0%
so to say within what does money do
 
07:01:41.390 --> 07:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
within the city budget maybe in your
 
07:01:43.610 --> 07:01:43.620 align:start position:0%
community if you just please like I say
 
07:01:45.948 --> 07:01:45.958 align:start position:0%
is the power of the the election box
 
07:01:49.310 --> 07:01:49.320 align:start position:0%
maybe you can influence the budget but
 
07:01:51.770 --> 07:01:51.780 align:start position:0%
basically what happens right now with
 
07:01:51.780 --> 07:01:52.788 align:start position:0%
basically what happens right now with
this

07:01:52.788 --> 07:01:52.798 align:start position:0%
this
 
07:01:54.708 --> 07:01:54.718 align:start position:0%
this has the backing of the New
 
07:01:56.990 --> 07:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association as
 
07:01:58.910 --> 07:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
representative goalie said and the
 
07:02:02.270 --> 07:02:02.280 align:start position:0%
reason they support it it is a car
 
07:02:05.150 --> 07:02:05.160 align:start position:0%
across the board attempt
 
07:02:07.128 --> 07:02:07.138 align:start position:0%
to alleviate
 
07:02:10.430 --> 07:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
the tax the burden on the taxpayers and
 
07:02:13.810 --> 07:02:13.820 align:start position:0%
that's why I wrote 274 and
 
07:02:16.430 --> 07:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately with deepest respect to
 
07:02:18.590 --> 07:02:18.600 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson it would
 
07:02:21.948 --> 07:02:21.958 align:start position:0%
partially dismantle that because by just
 
07:02:24.350 --> 07:02:24.360 align:start position:0%
with the volume of group two people
 
07:02:24.360 --> 07:02:26.030 align:start position:0%
with the volume of group two people
alone

07:02:26.030 --> 07:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
alone
 
07:02:28.730 --> 07:02:28.740 align:start position:0%
you would be taking down basically a
 
07:02:30.410 --> 07:02:30.420 align:start position:0%
half a percent or something like that
 
07:02:33.048 --> 07:02:33.058 align:start position:0%
that would benefit the taxpayers thank
 
07:02:34.730 --> 07:02:34.740 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
07:02:37.430 --> 07:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
representative Allegra no I'm forced to
 
07:02:39.890 --> 07:02:39.900 align:start position:0%
respond to that I don't remember hearing
 
07:02:41.930 --> 07:02:41.940 align:start position:0%
anybody uh say the things that you
 
07:02:44.510 --> 07:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
quoted being said there certainly I can
 
07:02:47.690 --> 07:02:47.700 align:start position:0%
speak for myself I didn't say that but I
 
07:02:49.968 --> 07:02:49.978 align:start position:0%
will say this you're absolutely right
 
07:02:53.810 --> 07:02:53.820 align:start position:0%
the city is not a bank
 
07:02:55.610 --> 07:02:55.620 align:start position:0%
so there should be not there should not
 
07:02:57.530 --> 07:02:57.540 align:start position:0%
be millions and millions and millions of
 
07:03:00.770 --> 07:03:00.780 align:start position:0%
dollars in Surplus neither should there
 
07:03:03.468 --> 07:03:03.478 align:start position:0%
be millions and millions and millions of
 
07:03:05.810 --> 07:03:05.820 align:start position:0%
dollars in debt
 
07:03:05.820 --> 07:03:07.670 align:start position:0%
dollars in debt
now

07:03:07.670 --> 07:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
now
 
07:03:09.830 --> 07:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
I didn't say that one Community gets
 
07:03:12.048 --> 07:03:12.058 align:start position:0%
more or benefits more from the other
 
07:03:14.390 --> 07:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
but I'll tell you what I did say I don't
 
07:03:16.490 --> 07:03:16.500 align:start position:0%
remember my exact words but I'll use the
 
07:03:18.948 --> 07:03:18.958 align:start position:0%
same sentiment certainly some
 
07:03:22.968 --> 07:03:22.978 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:26.390 --> 07:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
and going back to my community and

07:11:05.390 --> 07:11:05.400 align:start position:0%
right
 
07:11:08.090 --> 07:11:08.100 align:start position:0%
so what happens if the retain fits
 
07:11:08.100 --> 07:11:14.930 align:start position:0%
so what happens if the retain fits
um

07:11:14.930 --> 07:11:14.940 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:14.940 --> 07:11:17.930 align:start position:0%
 
made

07:11:17.930 --> 07:11:17.940 align:start position:0%

07:11:20.510 --> 07:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
yes representative Schmidt the motion
 
07:11:22.670 --> 07:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
was made representative goalie
 
07:11:24.650 --> 07:11:24.660 align:start position:0%
that's okay do you want I'll let you
 
07:11:26.030 --> 07:11:26.040 align:start position:0%

um
 
07:11:34.610 --> 07:11:34.620 align:start position:0%
we have not been able to agree on itl
 
07:11:36.530 --> 07:11:36.540 align:start position:0%
ought to pass or ought to pass with an
 
07:11:38.628 --> 07:11:38.638 align:start position:0%
amendment no one else has brought
 
07:11:41.690 --> 07:11:41.700 align:start position:0%
forward any other Amendment
 
07:11:45.170 --> 07:11:45.180 align:start position:0%
we're at our deadline and
 
07:11:47.448 --> 07:11:47.458 align:start position:0%
this is something that we are divided on
 
07:11:51.288 --> 07:11:51.298 align:start position:0%
but it is important and I think we
 
07:11:55.010 --> 07:11:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:58.250 --> 07:11:58.260 align:start position:0%
for example please
 
07:12:00.288 --> 07:12:00.298 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I will be voting
 
07:12:02.448 --> 07:12:02.458 align:start position:0%
against retaining uh this isn't the only
 
07:12:04.250 --> 07:12:04.260 align:start position:0%
other option we have we have the option
 
07:12:05.510 --> 07:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
of sending it to the floor without
 
07:12:08.868 --> 07:12:08.878 align:start position:0%
recommendation if this motion shall fail
 
07:12:08.878 --> 07:12:09.948 align:start position:0%
recommendation if this motion shall fail
um

07:12:09.948 --> 07:12:09.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:12:11.810 --> 07:12:11.820 align:start position:0%
this is the budget year this is when
 
07:12:15.048 --> 07:12:15.058 align:start position:0%
this should be being taken up the cities
 
07:12:16.968 --> 07:12:16.978 align:start position:0%
and towns are looking for Relief and
 
07:12:19.610 --> 07:12:19.620 align:start position:0%
this is a way of providing that relief
 
07:12:21.170 --> 07:12:21.180 align:start position:0%
this is scheduled to go to the second
 
07:12:23.690 --> 07:12:23.700 align:start position:0%
hearing uh so that it would be the
 
07:12:25.250 --> 07:12:25.260 align:start position:0%
numbers can be figured out and it can be
 
07:12:26.270 --> 07:12:26.280 align:start position:0%
part of
 
07:12:29.510 --> 07:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
um if passed uh can be included within
 
07:12:32.150 --> 07:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
the budget if we retain it it does no
 
07:12:34.310 --> 07:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
good the budget will be done the money
 
07:12:36.288 --> 07:12:36.298 align:start position:0%
won't be there so I don't see a reason
 
07:12:38.448 --> 07:12:38.458 align:start position:0%
to retain this I think we should vote on
 
07:12:41.810 --> 07:12:41.820 align:start position:0%
it act on it today and if we have to
 
07:12:42.650 --> 07:12:42.660 align:start position:0%
send it to the floor without
 
07:12:43.968 --> 07:12:43.978 align:start position:0%
recommendation and let the whole house
 
07:12:46.190 --> 07:12:46.200 align:start position:0%
fall behind thank you unless someone
 
07:12:47.990 --> 07:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
wants to step up we can't send it
 
07:12:50.390 --> 07:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
without recommendation is that an odd
 
07:12:52.368 --> 07:12:52.378 align:start position:0%
number wrong sorry
 
07:12:55.670 --> 07:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
but uh anyone else
 
07:12:58.128 --> 07:12:58.138 align:start position:0%
well I would I would also like to
 
07:12:59.990 --> 07:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
mention that the Senate has a similar
 
07:13:03.230 --> 07:13:03.240 align:start position:0%
bill that includes a contribution to
 
07:13:05.628 --> 07:13:05.638 align:start position:0%
retirement system you are working on it
 
07:13:07.910 --> 07:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
I believe I don't know whether just pass
 
07:13:10.190 --> 07:13:10.200 align:start position:0%
the senate or not I do know it is being
 
07:13:11.628 --> 07:13:11.638 align:start position:0%
considered there
 
07:13:14.030 --> 07:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
point-of-point order bouncer yeah oh I'm
 
07:13:15.410 --> 07:13:15.420 align:start position:0%
sorry go ahead representative point of
 
07:13:19.610 --> 07:13:19.620 align:start position:0%
order I believe if no
 
07:13:22.010 --> 07:13:22.020 align:start position:0%
motion comes out of this
 
07:13:25.070 --> 07:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
committee with a positive vote then it
 
07:13:27.170 --> 07:13:27.180 align:start position:0%
goes to the floor without recommendation
 
07:13:28.670 --> 07:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
is my recollection
 
07:13:31.250 --> 07:13:31.260 align:start position:0%
so if this goes down and we've made all
 
07:13:33.890 --> 07:13:33.900 align:start position:0%
of the attempts on the motions and
 
07:13:35.930 --> 07:13:35.940 align:start position:0%
nothing passes that is when it goes to
 
07:13:37.850 --> 07:13:37.860 align:start position:0%
the floor it doesn't go on a tie vote it
 
07:13:39.048 --> 07:13:39.058 align:start position:0%
goes on I
 
07:13:40.910 --> 07:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
thank you that's a good point I hadn't
 
07:13:41.868 --> 07:13:41.878 align:start position:0%
thought of it
 
07:13:44.570 --> 07:13:44.580 align:start position:0%
thank you darling is that the case can
 
07:13:46.010 --> 07:13:46.020 align:start position:0%
we vote to give it with no
 
07:13:46.020 --> 07:13:48.288 align:start position:0%
we vote to give it with no
recommendation

07:13:48.288 --> 07:13:48.298 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
07:13:52.910 --> 07:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
yes if every motion fails you're you're
 
07:13:54.170 --> 07:13:54.180 align:start position:0%
left with
 
07:13:56.030 --> 07:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
no recommendation
 
07:13:59.930 --> 07:13:59.940 align:start position:0%
okay in that case I will withdraw my
 
07:14:02.990 --> 07:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
motion to retain
 
07:14:03.000 --> 07:14:04.250 align:start position:0%
motion to retain
and

07:14:04.250 --> 07:14:04.260 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:14:06.830 --> 07:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
entertain representative Foley's motion
 
07:14:09.650 --> 07:14:09.660 align:start position:0%
to send it with no recommendation I
 
07:14:09.660 --> 07:14:11.150 align:start position:0%
to send it with no recommendation I
second

07:14:11.150 --> 07:14:11.160 align:start position:0%

um and Pam correct me if I'm wrong I I'm
 
07:14:24.830 --> 07:14:24.840 align:start position:0%

07:14:27.288 --> 07:14:27.298 align:start position:0%
up as long as we take up the itl the
 
07:14:28.968 --> 07:14:28.978 align:start position:0%
amendments in the ought to pass to send
 
07:14:31.610 --> 07:14:31.620 align:start position:0%

07:14:33.948 --> 07:14:33.958 align:start position:0%
you correct me if I'm wrong well I could
 
07:14:35.990 --> 07:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
I could give Paul Smith a call if you
 
07:14:38.690 --> 07:14:38.700 align:start position:0%
like to be to be 100 sure I'm not sure
 
07:14:39.948 --> 07:14:39.958 align:start position:0%
about that
 
07:14:41.810 --> 07:14:41.820 align:start position:0%
well we definitely ought not to
 
07:14:44.150 --> 07:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
hypothesize let's find out from the
 
07:14:44.160 --> 07:14:45.170 align:start position:0%
hypothesize let's find out from the
clerk

07:14:45.170 --> 07:14:45.180 align:start position:0%

07:14:47.510 --> 07:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
I've got his uh cell phone I'll I'll be
 
07:14:50.690 --> 07:14:50.700 align:start position:0%
back to you Logan well we it won't hurt
 
07:14:54.048 --> 07:14:54.058 align:start position:0%
to vote on no recommendation there
 
07:14:56.510 --> 07:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
manager if I may there is no vote on a
 
07:14:58.850 --> 07:14:58.860 align:start position:0%
on that motion it's just if all the
 
07:15:01.670 --> 07:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
votes fail then that's the way the
 
07:15:04.548 --> 07:15:04.558 align:start position:0%
committee sends it there is no way to
 
07:15:04.558 --> 07:15:05.510 align:start position:0%
committee sends it there is no way to
vote

07:15:05.510 --> 07:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
vote
 
07:15:08.390 --> 07:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
you cannot send something by a positive
 
07:15:08.400 --> 07:15:09.780 align:start position:0%
you cannot send something by a positive
vote

07:15:09.780 --> 07:15:09.790 align:start position:0%
vote
 
07:15:09.790 --> 07:15:12.430 align:start position:0%
vote
[Music]

07:15:12.430 --> 07:15:12.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
07:15:16.250 --> 07:15:16.260 align:start position:0%
if I if I'm clear on that I would agree
 
07:15:18.230 --> 07:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
with representative goalie I believe the
 
07:15:21.170 --> 07:15:21.180 align:start position:0%
clerk is going to state that uh without
 
07:15:23.750 --> 07:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
recommendation is technically not
 
07:15:26.948 --> 07:15:26.958 align:start position:0%
emotional we would vote on
 
07:15:29.448 --> 07:15:29.458 align:start position:0%
yeah that's how it was with indigenous
 
07:15:32.570 --> 07:15:32.580 align:start position:0%
people's day about a year or two ago
 
07:15:38.468 --> 07:15:38.478 align:start position:0%

unfortunately we have all our opinions
 
07:16:34.070 --> 07:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
and of course I respect that but I I did
 
07:16:36.830 --> 07:16:36.840 align:start position:0%
enjoy and I thought there was a a very
 
07:16:38.990 --> 07:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
well thought of discussion on both sides
 
07:16:40.968 --> 07:16:40.978 align:start position:0%

it's something that we we agree on no
 
07:17:08.750 --> 07:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
recommendation representative O'Brien
 
07:17:11.410 --> 07:17:11.420 align:start position:0%
would you care to write the
 
07:17:14.570 --> 07:17:14.580 align:start position:0%
recommendation of what to pass
 
07:17:17.330 --> 07:17:17.340 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I would all right
 
07:17:19.368 --> 07:17:19.378 align:start position:0%
I will write a recommendation in favor
 
07:17:22.490 --> 07:17:22.500 align:start position:0%
of an expedient to legislate and mention
 
07:17:25.910 --> 07:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
the amendment that was adopted but not
 
07:17:25.920 --> 07:17:27.170 align:start position:0%
the amendment that was adopted but not
uh

07:17:27.170 --> 07:17:27.180 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:17:30.048 --> 07:17:30.058 align:start position:0%
not included
 
07:17:33.170 --> 07:17:33.180 align:start position:0%
uh when does it uh needed I'm kind of
 
07:17:38.930 --> 07:17:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:38.940 --> 07:17:39.890 align:start position:0%
 
okay

07:17:39.890 --> 07:17:39.900 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:17:42.250 --> 07:17:42.260 align:start position:0%
I assume this can't be enough
 
07:17:46.990 --> 07:17:47.000 align:start position:0%
if it needs to novel it can be a novel
 
07:17:49.910 --> 07:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
I would I would say that a short story
