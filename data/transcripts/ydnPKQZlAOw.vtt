um thanks so much for
 
00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
you know being on this committee i am
 
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
i personally love this committee i love
 
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
the work we do
 
00:08:57.910 --> 00:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
and i think that we are just so
 
00:08:59.110 --> 00:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
responsible in our
 
00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:00.959 align:start position:0%
our work and i think that we set a good
 
00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
example for the rest of the committees
 
00:09:03.509 --> 00:09:03.519 align:start position:0%
in the house
 
00:09:07.269 --> 00:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
with our bipartisanship and the way that
 
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
we all really
 
00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
try to work together um
 
00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:14.720 align:start position:0%
some of my expectations as chair is that
 
00:09:15.269 --> 00:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
we are
 
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
always respectful to each other
 
00:09:21.509 --> 00:09:21.519 align:start position:0%
um there you know leave the r d at the
 
00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:21.990 align:start position:0%
um there you know leave the r d at the
door

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
door
 
00:09:24.949 --> 00:09:24.959 align:start position:0%
because kids don't care kids don't care
 
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
if you're a republican or a democrat
 
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:29.200 align:start position:0%
you know and we're just supposed to be
 
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
looking out for what's best for them
 
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
and you know we're not going to agree on
 
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
everything that's
 
00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:38.240 align:start position:0%
that's you know obvious but we really
 
00:09:38.949 --> 00:09:38.959 align:start position:0%
really do
 
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
try to come to agreement on all our
 
00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:42.550 align:start position:0%
try to come to agreement on all our
bills

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
you know every sometimes you know people
 
00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
just have to give a little
 
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
and some you know it's just the way it
 
00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:49.269 align:start position:0%
and some you know it's just the way it
is

00:09:49.269 --> 00:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:52.240 align:start position:0%
you know but um i really really want us
 
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
to all be very respectful to each other
 
00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
and you know really be friends because
 
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
i consider all my the committee members
 
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
that are returning from last year to be
 
00:10:04.949 --> 00:10:04.959 align:start position:0%
my friends and i'm really excited to
 
00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
gain new friends
 
00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
so um i just i'm really looking forward
 
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
to this term
 
00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
not not that last term was bad last term
 
00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:15.200 align:start position:0%

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
job as chair
 
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:20.800 align:start position:0%

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
really good members that we had
 
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
but um i think we've gained some really
 
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
good members also
 
00:10:32.069 --> 00:10:32.079 align:start position:0%

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:15.200 align:start position:0%
stickler for starting on time
 
00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
because the public comes to our meetings
 
00:12:18.949 --> 00:12:18.959 align:start position:0%
they're expecting them to start at a
 
00:12:20.389 --> 00:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
certain time
 
00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
and i don't want them sitting and
 
00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
waiting for 20 minutes because we're not
 
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
on time
 
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:29.360 align:start position:0%

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
you know be on time because i'll start
 
00:12:32.389 --> 00:12:32.399 align:start position:0%

going to be a couple of minutes i can
 
00:12:40.069 --> 00:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
drag things out a little bit when i
 
00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
start the meeting but
 
00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:44.560 align:start position:0%

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
um do not share your zoom link with
 
00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
anyone else it's specific to you
 
00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
um and you should always try to enter
 
00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:56.720 align:start position:0%

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
that's just
 
00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
if you could today yeah is an exception
 
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
but going forward if you can have your
 
00:14:15.509 --> 00:14:15.519 align:start position:0%
video on during a public hearing i think
 
00:14:17.269 --> 00:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
it means a lot to the public they get to
 
00:14:18.629 --> 00:14:18.639 align:start position:0%
see who they're talking to
 
00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
they get to see you know they they know
 
00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
that you're paying attention to their
 
00:14:24.629 --> 00:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
testimony because
 
00:14:27.189 --> 00:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
while you know this may not have
 
00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
affected you this has been something
 
00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
deeply personal in their life and and
 
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:32.240 align:start position:0%
they want to know that people are
 
00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:32.949 align:start position:0%
they want to know that people are
listening

00:14:32.949 --> 00:14:32.959 align:start position:0%
listening
 
00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
but one thing about our committee is
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
it's very emotional
 
00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
um not everything is black and white um
 
00:14:41.269 --> 00:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of emotions behind
 
00:14:41.279 --> 00:14:42.230 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of emotions behind
everything

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
everything
 
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:44.240 align:start position:0%
so we always want to you know be
 
00:14:46.069 --> 00:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
respectful and make sure we're paying
 
00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
attention to the people who are
 
00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.030 align:start position:0%
attention to the people who are
testifying

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
testifying
 
00:14:54.629 --> 00:14:54.639 align:start position:0%
um the chat feature will not be on
 
00:14:59.350 --> 00:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
um and we but we can text or email
 
00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:00.230 align:start position:0%
um and we but we can text or email
during

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
during
 
00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
um the hearing if if we you know if
 
00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
someone has an issue and
 
00:15:10.829 --> 00:15:10.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
yeah i will last that you remain muted
 
00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:24.720 align:start position:0%
and then um
 
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
you know until you're you're asked to
 
00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
talk that way we don't get the
 
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
background noise we don't you know
 
00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
um because i understand things happen
 
00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
and it's it's different when you're how
 
00:15:36.629 --> 00:15:36.639 align:start position:0%
my dog would would be jumping up on me
 
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
trying to tell me a whole story
 
00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
in the middle of a meeting so um you
 
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
know if if
 
00:15:45.829 --> 00:15:45.839 align:start position:0%
if you if you mute we we avoid that
 
00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
um let's see
 
00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
um really quick i want to touch on
 
00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:53.990 align:start position:0%
um really quick i want to touch on
executive

00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
executive
 
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
sessions i know there's been a lot of
 
00:15:57.269 --> 00:15:57.279 align:start position:0%
talk about executive sessions
 
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
um we those are going to be hybrid
 
00:16:03.749 --> 00:16:03.759 align:start position:0%
um most of you know i had covid
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
i am not taking chances with anyone
 
00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
um so the
 
00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
they will be hybrid you can if you
 
00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
choose to come to the state house and
 
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
wear a mask
 
00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
then great but if you don't want to stay
 
00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:18.949 align:start position:0%
then great but if you don't want to stay
home

00:16:18.949 --> 00:16:18.959 align:start position:0%
home
 
00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
and you can do it this way but your
 
00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
video must be
 
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
on because we have to know who is voting
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
we have to be able to see that it's
 
00:16:29.829 --> 00:16:29.839 align:start position:0%
really you voting
 
00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
and not your neighbor that came over to
 
00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
sit in your seat
 
00:16:35.749 --> 00:16:35.759 align:start position:0%
so you could go walk your dog or
 
00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:36.959 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
so you know those are um i i just wanted
 
00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:40.790 align:start position:0%
so you know those are um i i just wanted
to

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
let everyone know that so it could you
 
00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:44.800 align:start position:0%

00:17:15.909 --> 00:17:15.919 align:start position:0%
anytime you need
 
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
something look into or something and you
 
00:17:19.669 --> 00:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
want to have um
 
00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
christina do that that request goes
 
00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:23.839 align:start position:0%
through the chair
 
00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
so you bring your request to me and and
 
00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
i then bring it to
 
00:17:30.789 --> 00:17:30.799 align:start position:0%
um christina i don't ever deny anyone's
 
00:17:32.549 --> 00:17:32.559 align:start position:0%
request for anything because we all want
 
00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
to have all the information we want to
 
00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:37.430 align:start position:0%
to have all the information we want to
have

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
i think that's about it as far as that
 
00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:45.590 align:start position:0%
i think that's about it as far as that
goes

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
goes
 
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
it looks like i think that last count i
 
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
can't remember if it was 17
 
00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
or 19 bills that we'll have coming to
 
00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:53.360 align:start position:0%

00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
um we will be doing we will have one set
 
00:17:59.669 --> 00:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
day a week i don't know what that day is
 
00:17:59.679 --> 00:18:00.950 align:start position:0%
day a week i don't know what that day is

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
yet
 
00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
and we will be going from nine to five
 
00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:07.280 align:start position:0%

days
 
00:18:20.789 --> 00:18:20.799 align:start position:0%
to um get our work done because that
 
00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
is the people that have been here before
 
00:18:24.789 --> 00:18:24.799 align:start position:0%
know we have some bills where
 
00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
yeah we
 
00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:30.160 align:start position:0%
get a lot of people to come in and
 
00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:32.240 align:start position:0%
testify on them it's emotional
 
00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
it's a long day um but let's get it done
 
00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
because these
 
00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
you know a lot of these people have
 
00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:40.720 align:start position:0%
waited long enough for some results
 
00:18:43.909 --> 00:18:43.919 align:start position:0%
in their cases and and lives
 
00:18:43.919 --> 00:18:47.270 align:start position:0%
in their cases and and lives
um

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
uh what else was i gonna say i don't
 
00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
know do you guys have any questions for
 
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.190 align:start position:0%
know do you guys have any questions for
me

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
um if you have a question that's the
 
00:18:59.190 --> 00:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
practice using the raise your hand thing
 
00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
and then i believe that for right now
 
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
christina is going to
 
00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
um run that for me thank god because i
 
00:19:07.029 --> 00:19:07.039 align:start position:0%
forgot my mouse for my
 
00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
laptop and i'm not really good without
 
00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:10.549 align:start position:0%
laptop and i'm not really good without
it

00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:10.559 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
but so does anyone have any questions
 
00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
it looks like representative yokela has
 
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
his hand up hey
 
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
representative yokela how you doing
 
00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
i'm fine um i have a question about uh
 
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
your statement that people need to be
 
00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
in uh have their video on
 
00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:36.160 align:start position:0%
during during voting for executive
 
00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
sessions so i i think there's one person
 
00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:39.270 align:start position:0%
sessions so i i think there's one person
that's

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:19:42.549 --> 00:19:42.559 align:start position:0%
on this that is on via
 
00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
phone call right so are you saying that
 
00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
phone calls would not be allowed during
 
00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
executives not during executive sessions
 
00:19:51.029 --> 00:19:51.039 align:start position:0%
so we will work with representative
 
00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
lewicki to see if we can come to
 
00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:57.200 align:start position:0%
um a solution for that but we do we do
 
00:19:57.909 --> 00:19:57.919 align:start position:0%
have to know
 
00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
that it's actually the person voting but
 
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
we will work on that
 
00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
okay this is representative can you can
 
00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
you wait to be recognized representative
 
00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
let me just make sure that
 
00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
representative yokela is done
 
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
um yeah i mean it seems like it's going
 
00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:20:20.789 --> 00:20:20.799 align:start position:0%
like there was someone earlier that was
 
00:20:22.549 --> 00:20:22.559 align:start position:0%
having connection issues
 
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
and they suggested turning off the the
 
00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:25.990 align:start position:0%
and they suggested turning off the the
um

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
video so that they could be heard it
 
00:20:29.669 --> 00:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
seems like there's going to be
 
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
uh we're just opening up to a lot of
 
00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:33.029 align:start position:0%
uh we're just opening up to a lot of
problems

00:20:33.029 --> 00:20:33.039 align:start position:0%
problems
 
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
so when we get to a boat okay
 
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
they can turn their video back on
 
00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:41.520 align:start position:0%

somewhere else that just
 
00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
for the public that does not mean that
 
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
we have to shut down the meeting
 
00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:41.440 align:start position:0%

precautions so people have choices
 
00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
yeah except for the public when we're
 
00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
not letting the public end
 
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
but what were you going to say
 
00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
representative wiki
 
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
no thank you madam chair um as of now
 
00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
and probably until the end of this month
 
00:22:45.029 --> 00:22:45.039 align:start position:0%
i am still on a
 
00:22:47.029 --> 00:22:47.039 align:start position:0%
dial-up phone connection and i cannot
 
00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
possibly do video i am happy
 
00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
as i said in messages to the speaker and
 
00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
the clerk to come in
 
00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
and sit in a room by myself at the lob
 
00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:55.909 align:start position:0%
and sit in a room by myself at the lob
or

00:22:55.909 --> 00:22:55.919 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:22:59.750 --> 00:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:03.669 --> 00:23:03.679 align:start position:0%
perfect okay like i said we're you know
 
00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
we're working on all of this i think
 
00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
we'll have like what
 
00:23:08.789 --> 00:23:08.799 align:start position:0%
it won't be us that that meets next week
 
00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:10.240 align:start position:0%
there'll be one
 
00:23:12.789 --> 00:23:12.799 align:start position:0%
see how it goes you know um see how all
 
00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:13.919 align:start position:0%
of this works
 
00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
you know because we also have you know i
 
00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
had questions about
 
00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
um people calling in from out of new
 
00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:21.990 align:start position:0%

hampshire
 
00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
right i mean we represent new hampshire
 
00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
so i don't want
 
00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
10 people calling in on a bill from new
 
00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:28.480 align:start position:0%
york city
 
00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
right because they're not new hampshire
 
00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
and you know as you know new hampshire
 
00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
we do things our own ways so we have to

you know
 
00:23:36.789 --> 00:23:36.799 align:start position:0%

00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
working out and
 
00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:40.720 align:start position:0%
you know it but i really have faith that
 
00:23:43.669 --> 00:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
it will all work out
 
00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:47.360 align:start position:0%

um now do we know the capacity in the
lod

00:24:04.149 --> 00:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
lod
 
00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
is there not that i know of yet but it
 
00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
looks like it will be
 
00:24:11.909 --> 00:24:11.919 align:start position:0%
um wherever the double room is
 
00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
put right because we're going to use
 
00:24:16.549 --> 00:24:16.559 align:start position:0%
double rooms
 
00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
six feet apart for the people that come
 
00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
and masks one at
 
00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:26.240 align:start position:0%
one end of the hall the other at the
 
00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:27.190 align:start position:0%
one end of the hall the other at the
other

00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:27.200 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:24:30.149 --> 00:24:30.159 align:start position:0%
other end of the hall we're working on
 
00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
staggered arrival times
 
00:24:36.149 --> 00:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
so one committee starts at this time
 
00:24:37.909 --> 00:24:37.919 align:start position:0%
another committee will you know start at
 
00:24:40.789 --> 00:24:40.799 align:start position:0%
this time something like that
 
00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
um like i said it's also new but you
 
00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
know our main priority is just making
 
00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
sure that
 
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
everyone is safe okay and the
 
00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
um is this the hybrid just for
 
00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
exact sessions nope hybrid is for um
 
00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
for both hearings absolutely yeah yeah
 
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
um and uh and you're you're when you
 
00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
find out the day you'll let us know what
 
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
day you're oh definitely right away yeah
 
00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
yeah so you don't anticipate a couple
 
00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:10.720 align:start position:0%
days just
 
00:25:14.149 --> 00:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
one day one day all day
 
00:25:17.269 --> 00:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
yeah um a week you know um right
 
00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
until we get our work done but yeah i
 
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
because with only
 
00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
17 to 19 bills i don't think we need two
 
00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
days a week i think we can get
 
00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:28.240 align:start position:0%
a lot a lot done in a day i think there
 
00:25:29.669 --> 00:25:29.679 align:start position:0%
might be a couple of bills that are
 
00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
going to take
 
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
um a longer period of time okay
 
00:25:37.269 --> 00:25:37.279 align:start position:0%
but um other than that i i think we'll
 
00:25:39.029 --> 00:25:39.039 align:start position:0%
be able to get a lot done
 
00:25:40.789 --> 00:25:40.799 align:start position:0%
you know as long as we're you know on
 
00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
time and and just
 
00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
sticking to the script you know
 
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
but uh right i mean i really believe we
 
00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
can do it
 
00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:52.960 align:start position:0%

that that will be let me just go over my
 
00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
notes again real time
 
00:27:11.909 --> 00:27:11.919 align:start position:0%

00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:17.120 align:start position:0%

alicia has a question and followed by
 
00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:20.070 align:start position:0%
alicia has a question and followed by
representative

00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
there you are thank you madam chair my
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
question is regarding
 
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
the possibility of someone recording
 
00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
our session and i know that there's
 
00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
there can be issues with that so just to
 
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
share with everyone are we allowed to
 
00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
record the sessions or not
 
00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
so that people will know in in advance
 
00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
well i know that it's
 
00:27:58.789 --> 00:27:58.799 align:start position:0%
it's being recorded right now
 
00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
um as far as the outside i
 
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
it's also being streamed on youtube yeah
 
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
each of the sessions
 
00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
yeah so i mean it's out there
 
00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
i suppose if if somebody's gonna record
 
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
it they're gonna have it
 
00:28:15.669 --> 00:28:15.679 align:start position:0%
anyways and we'll have the original but
 
00:28:16.789 --> 00:28:16.799 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that's an
 
00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
option for someone who's not a panelist
 
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
you know what i mean christina do you
 
00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:24.640 align:start position:0%
know if that's the case
 
00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:26.480 align:start position:0%
uh no i don't believe that someone who's
 
00:28:27.909 --> 00:28:27.919 align:start position:0%
not a panelist can do it
 
00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
but i can say that these are archived on
 
00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
the house of representative website so
 
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
anyone can go back and take a look at
 
00:28:36.389 --> 00:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
the the recording at any time
 
00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:44.070 align:start position:0%
 
behavior

00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
behavior
 
00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
representative long you were nagged hey
 
00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
um do you anticipate next week starting
 
00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
hearings or
 
00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
not for this committee i don't
 
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
anticipate that
 
00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
i do anticipate that something will
 
00:28:58.789 --> 00:28:58.799 align:start position:0%
start next week
 
00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
but i don't think it's this one because
 
00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
i think we're going to have a trial
 
00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
run with i hope they don't pick this
 
00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
committee because i really don't want to
 
00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
make us
 
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
look you know but um
 
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
you know if i i just uh
 
00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
i'm just not sure yet you know as you
 
00:29:17.909 --> 00:29:17.919 align:start position:0%
know we were really behind
 
00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
the timeline with the um
 
00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:24.640 align:start position:0%

a verizon commercial
 
00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:08.470 align:start position:0%
a verizon commercial
[Laughter]

00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
dude are you able to hear me i can hear
 
00:39:25.109 --> 00:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
so one of the one of the things i'm
 
00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:28.710 align:start position:0%
so one of the one of the things i'm
wondering

00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:31.839 align:start position:0%
um melissa is if you turned
 
00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:34.640 align:start position:0%
if you turned off the audio and called
 
00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:34.950 align:start position:0%
if you turned off the audio and called
in

00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
on your phone to use the audio that way
 
00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
and we just had your video
 
00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
i wonder if that would work better
 
00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
what i mean like we can turn off the
 
00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
audio on your computer
 
00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
call in with your phone because there
 
00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
should have been a phone number where

to go back over to the speaker's office
 
00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
after this is over
 
00:47:35.829 --> 00:47:35.839 align:start position:0%
to bring up um some of the concerns that
 
00:47:35.839 --> 00:47:36.309 align:start position:0%
to bring up um some of the concerns that
um

00:47:36.309 --> 00:47:36.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
that i've noticed and everything um
 
00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
but does anyone have any other questions
 
00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
for me
 
00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:46.720 align:start position:0%
or um you know anything that
 
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
that you know you want to bring up uh
 
00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
so just so you know if you do come in
 
00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
for the committee there's um
 
00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
you can bring like a bottled water but
 
00:47:56.870 --> 00:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
there's you can't eat food while you're
 
00:47:58.150 --> 00:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
at the thing i ask that you
 
00:48:01.349 --> 00:48:01.359 align:start position:0%
keep your um cell phones you know
 
00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
really to a minimum especially
 
00:48:06.309 --> 00:48:06.319 align:start position:0%
especially if someone is testifying
 
00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
because there's nothing worse than
 
00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
someone who thinks you're not listening
 
00:48:12.309 --> 00:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
or that you don't care
 
00:48:14.309 --> 00:48:14.319 align:start position:0%
so it's really important that you know
 
00:48:16.069 --> 00:48:16.079 align:start position:0%
you're really focused when people are
 
00:48:16.079 --> 00:48:17.190 align:start position:0%
you're really focused when people are
testifying

00:48:17.190 --> 00:48:17.200 align:start position:0%
testifying
 
00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
uh they will be able to see us there
 
00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
will be a big screen
 
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
um tv in the room so it's going to be
 
00:48:28.549 --> 00:48:28.559 align:start position:0%
um interesting to say the least
 
00:48:31.349 --> 00:48:31.359 align:start position:0%
but um you know so those are just some
 
00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
things that if you come in
 
00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
um from the um
 
00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
you know to come actually into the
 
00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:41.109 align:start position:0%
you know to come actually into the
committee

00:48:41.109 --> 00:48:41.119 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
so i i want to say that we said today if
 
00:48:46.549 --> 00:48:46.559 align:start position:0%
you if as long as we are six feet away
 
00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
we will not have to wear a mask while
 
00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
we're sitting
 
00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
we're also trying to get the um the
 
00:48:55.349 --> 00:48:55.359 align:start position:0%
plastic partitions that would go up in
 
00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
between us
 
00:48:59.910 --> 00:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
um so we're looking into that also but
 
00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
if you get up from your seat you need to
 
00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
wear a mask
 
00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
if you are coming into the building you
 
00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
need to wear a mask until you are seated
 
00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
in your seat
 
00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
okay because regardless of how you feel
 
00:49:17.109 --> 00:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
about it okay we have staff here who are
 
00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
very concerned and we have to think of
 
00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:19.589 align:start position:0%
very concerned and we have to think of
them

00:49:19.589 --> 00:49:19.599 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
there's that um and i said you know no
 
00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
food keep your electronic use to
 
00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:32.720 align:start position:0%
a minimum um
 
00:49:36.069 --> 00:49:36.079 align:start position:0%
let's see uh madam vice chair did i
 
00:49:38.390 --> 00:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
forget anything
 
00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
probably but
 
00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i don't think you
 
00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
forgot anything
 
00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
um i think
 
00:49:53.829 --> 00:49:53.839 align:start position:0%
that as long as we understand
 
00:49:57.829 --> 00:49:57.839 align:start position:0%
that the perception of our committee
 
00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
is what the public sees and if we
 
00:50:03.349 --> 00:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
treat each other with the ultimate of
 
00:50:03.359 --> 00:50:05.190 align:start position:0%
treat each other with the ultimate of
respect

00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
respect
 
00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
and leave our party lines at the door
 
00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:12.800 align:start position:0%
then the general public who testifies
 
00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
feels more comfortable they feel that
 
00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
their words are not falling
 
00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:22.720 align:start position:0%
we need to respect each other by
 
00:50:25.829 --> 00:50:25.839 align:start position:0%
referring to each other as
 
00:50:29.589 --> 00:50:29.599 align:start position:0%
our chair has today representative
 
00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
grossman representative levac whomever
 
00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:36.640 align:start position:0%
but always use the word representative
 
00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:40.960 align:start position:0%
that shows that we respect each other
 
00:50:43.349 --> 00:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
and it shows the general public that
 
00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
that's the case
 
00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
and we're serious and we're professional
 
00:50:52.309 --> 00:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
um i will say um that
 
00:50:56.069 --> 00:50:56.079 align:start position:0%
i believe our chair
 
00:50:59.190 --> 00:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
when she tells us because i've heard in
 
00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:02.720 align:start position:0%
