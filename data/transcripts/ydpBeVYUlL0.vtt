belnap

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
belnap
 
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
7 the reason I'm bringing this bill
 
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
forward is that I have a
 
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.589 align:start position:0%
forward is that I have a
constituency

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 align:start position:0%
constituency
 
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
um that has had issues with the easy
 
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.949 align:start position:0%
um that has had issues with the easy
pass

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 align:start position:0%
pass
 
00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.550 align:start position:0%
pass
system

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 align:start position:0%
and I was actually just talking to
 
00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:08.159 align:start position:0%
someone on the way in this morning that
 
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 align:start position:0%
they're getting bills for a plate that
 
00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 align:start position:0%
is no longer
 
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 align:start position:0%
theirs unfortunately when that happens
 
00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:19.159 align:start position:0%
and they go through and I didn't take
 
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 align:start position:0%
out the New Hampshire portion of this
 
00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 align:start position:0%
but dealing with the Easy Pass and
 
00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:26.879 align:start position:0%
trying to get these things rectified is
 
00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
a real
 
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.309 align:start position:0%
a real
hardship

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 align:start position:0%
hardship
 
00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:31.550 align:start position:0%
hardship
my

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 align:start position:0%
constituency does not have the ability
 
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 align:start position:0%
to have an Easy Pass
 
00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 align:start position:0%
system to have an easy path system you
 
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
have to have at least a minimum of $20
 
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 align:start position:0%
in an
 
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 align:start position:0%
account a lot of these people that $20
 
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 align:start position:0%
allows them to get to
 
00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 align:start position:0%
work when you put money in an easy path
 
00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 align:start position:0%
system it sits there and no one gets any
 
00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
interest on their monies it's free money
 
00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 align:start position:0%
and so the reason I brought this forward
 
00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 align:start position:0%
is because and a lot of these people
 
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 align:start position:0%
move around a lot so they're not even
 
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 align:start position:0%
getting their bills or they're not able
 
00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:16.199 align:start position:0%
to pay the fines and on top of all of
 
00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
that is that if you do not have an easy
 
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
pass in your vehicle you would charge an
 
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.230 align:start position:0%
pass in your vehicle you would charge an
additional

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
additional
 
00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 align:start position:0%
amount so who are we hurting we're
 
00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
hurting the constituency that needs us
 
00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:34.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 align:start position:0%
most and that is why I submitted this
 
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
bill and that is why I remove the
 
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 align:start position:0%
administra rative fees from being paid
 
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
in order to register your
 
00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
vehicle these people that I'm
 
00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
representing live from paycheck to
 
00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:54.199 align:start position:0%
paycheck and have a hard time making
 
00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
ends meet and in the economy that we're
 
00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
in it's actually gotten
 
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.469 align:start position:0%
in it's actually gotten
worse

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 align:start position:0%
worse
 
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 align:start position:0%
so I would urge you to really delve into
 
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 align:start position:0%
this and look at this and I am open to
 
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.270 align:start position:0%
this and look at this and I am open to
any

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
representative representative who okay
 
00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 align:start position:0%
yes uh representative could you describe
 
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
a little more are these problems if they
 
00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
use Easy Pass on other state or in New
 
00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:28.759 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um so if you do not have an
 
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 align:start position:0%
Easy Pass system and you can't afford it
 
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 align:start position:0%
Maine you don't have any options even in
 
00:05:40.309 --> 00:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire you no longer
 
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
really have an
 
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 align:start position:0%
option because we have gone to a almost
 
00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:50.600 align:start position:0%
an completely electronic
 
00:05:54.309 --> 00:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
system and for a lot of these folks they
 
00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
might have to travel through a toll
 
00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 align:start position:0%
booth and they can't afford an Easy Pass
 
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
punishing people that we're supposed to
 
00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:09.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.120 align:start position:0%
help thank you any further
 
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:17.919 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry
 
00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:20.440 align:start position:0%
please um with the passage of this bill
 
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
do you think it would lead to abuse
 
00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:24.039 align:start position:0%
people just say nothing's going to
 
00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
happen why Why Pay
 
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.000 align:start position:0%
It representative I I thank you for that
 
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
question um there's already abuse going
 
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
on we can't
 
00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:37.000 align:start position:0%
legislate stopping people from abusing
 
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.430 align:start position:0%
legislate stopping people from abusing
the

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:38.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
system and the thing is is if you abuse
 
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:45.720 align:start position:0%
it in New Hampshire we can still go
 
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
after them it's if they go travel into
 
00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
another state those states can prevents
 
00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire citizen a New Hampshire
 
00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
citizen from
 
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:00.360 align:start position:0%
registering and sell selling their
 
00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:04.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:10.639 align:start position:0%
cash thank you uh further question
 
00:07:13.309 --> 00:07:13.319 align:start position:0%
please represent
 
00:07:16.629 --> 00:07:16.639 align:start position:0%
pearon bone I'm sorry thank you Mr
 
00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:18.639 align:start position:0%
chairman so could you could you just
 
00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:22.120 align:start position:0%
walk me through this um so the person's
 
00:07:24.189 --> 00:07:24.199 align:start position:0%
drive I'm thinking it happens on the
 
00:07:26.309 --> 00:07:26.319 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Turnpike is that probably
 
00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:27.800 align:start position:0%
one of the situations that come up
 
00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
because there's no toll I mean there's
 
00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:32.120 align:start position:0%
no you it has to be an electronic
 
00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:34.280 align:start position:0%
transfer on the Mass
 
00:07:38.589 --> 00:07:38.599 align:start position:0%
Pike so thank you for the question
 
00:07:43.309 --> 00:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
um so yes I mean I went to
 
00:07:46.749 --> 00:07:46.759 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and I still have not yet
 
00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:49.479 align:start position:0%
to receive a bill to the best of my
 
00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
knowledge and that was over six months
 
00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.270 align:start position:0%
knowledge and that was over six months
ago

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:54.280 align:start position:0%
ago
 
00:07:57.189 --> 00:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
now there are other times when someone
 
00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:00.440 align:start position:0%
borrows a person's vehicle and and
 
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
they're unsta and that they may owe a
 
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
toll right I
 
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
mean there is a huge flaw in the way the
 
00:08:11.309 --> 00:08:11.319 align:start position:0%
system works I don't know what the
 
00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:14.360 align:start position:0%
answer is but this here is not the
 
00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:17.039 align:start position:0%
answer how we're doing it thank you
 
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
followup question thank you Mr chair so
 
00:08:22.309 --> 00:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
they still have to pay the tolls under
 
00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:23.960 align:start position:0%
this bill it's just basically they they
 
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
get out they don't have to pay the
 
00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.589 align:start position:0%
get out they don't have to pay the
administrative

00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:26.599 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
00:08:30.749 --> 00:08:30.759 align:start position:0%
fee that is correct for new Ure citizens
 
00:08:32.589 --> 00:08:32.599 align:start position:0%
and if they don't pay the toll they
 
00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
still could be prevented from having the
 
00:08:37.469 --> 00:08:37.479 align:start position:0%
registration approved right in New
 
00:08:40.829 --> 00:08:40.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yes but could Mass still be
 
00:08:42.949 --> 00:08:42.959 align:start position:0%
able to tell New Hampshire that there
 
00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
there's an unpaid toll
 
00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
no thank
 
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:52.240 align:start position:0%
you thank you further questions yes
 
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.910 align:start position:0%
you thank you further questions yes
representative

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
CL I noticed from the fiscal note that
 
00:08:58.389 --> 00:08:58.399 align:start position:0%
they have not estimated the amount of
 
00:08:58.399 --> 00:08:59.949 align:start position:0%
they have not estimated the amount of
Revenue

00:08:59.949 --> 00:08:59.959 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
that the state would lose now I
 
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
understand if if we have a scoff wall
 
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.870 align:start position:0%
understand if if we have a scoff wall
from

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:07.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:09.949 --> 00:09:09.959 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts we see them go through the
 
00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire toll without paying we
 
00:09:13.829 --> 00:09:13.839 align:start position:0%
send the notice to the state now there's
 
00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:16.399 align:start position:0%
no way to enforce that so the revenue we
 
00:09:18.949 --> 00:09:18.959 align:start position:0%
might have collected from Massachusetts
 
00:09:18.959 --> 00:09:19.870 align:start position:0%
might have collected from Massachusetts
are

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:19.880 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
main drivers who decide not to pay our
 
00:09:26.949 --> 00:09:26.959 align:start position:0%
toll goes down so in
 
00:09:29.829 --> 00:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
fact there is a
 
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:31.480 align:start position:0%
there is a fiscal impact from that it
 
00:09:34.069 --> 00:09:34.079 align:start position:0%
hasn't estimated here but uh do you have
 
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
any idea how many of those tolls we be
 
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
Miss as a result of this thank you for
 
00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:41.640 align:start position:0%
your question if you look at the very
 
00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:45.800 align:start position:0%
last page of the bill it tells you that
 
00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
the department uh related collections of
 
00:09:52.389 --> 00:09:52.399 align:start position:0%
$326 in fiscal year
 
00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:54.160 align:start position:0%
2022 and
 
00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
93,471 fiscal year
 
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
2023 and with the removal of the $50
 
00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:03.279 align:start position:0%
administrative fine it was a would be a
 
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:04.720 align:start position:0%
loss of
 
00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:07.640 align:start position:0%
$4,400 so
 
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
um yeah and if you notice that um there
 
00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:16.600 align:start position:0%
were over a million UNP 1.6 million
 
00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.389 align:start position:0%
were over a million UNP 1.6 million
unpaid

00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:18.399 align:start position:0%
unpaid
 
00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
transactions and the highest ranking
 
00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:23.800 align:start position:0%
States uh were New Hampshire Mass with
 
00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:27.560 align:start position:0%
27% and Maine with 6% so I think that
 
00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:30.680 align:start position:0%
the majority of the plate
 
00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:33.200 align:start position:0%
that are having the issues are our New
 
00:10:36.829 --> 00:10:36.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire plates and our New Hampshire
 
00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:40.600 align:start position:0%

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:43.320 align:start position:0%

turnpike system operates on an
 
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
Enterprise fund where all the revenue
 
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
collected on the system must be used on
 
00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
the system in fiscal year 23 we
 
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
collected 1 $1.3
 
00:11:27.509 --> 00:11:27.519 align:start position:0%
million of that
 
00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
$13.9 million was toll Revenue that's
 
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
cash or easy
 
00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:35.560 align:start position:0%
pass with that Revenue we we I broke it
 
00:11:37.069 --> 00:11:37.079 align:start position:0%
down into four categories where that
 
00:11:39.389 --> 00:11:39.399 align:start position:0%
money is spent operations and
 
00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:41.320 align:start position:0%
maintenance that is for the collection
 
00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:44.240 align:start position:0%
of tolls cash easy passs their
 
00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:47.320 align:start position:0%
violations and including our vendors um
 
00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:50.120 align:start position:0%
plowing repair and drainage guard rail
 
00:11:53.389 --> 00:11:53.399 align:start position:0%
Bridges U material for those repairs
 
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
mowing tree work and also our vendors
 
00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
who help support us with that
 
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
work um we also category that gets spent
 
00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:04.120 align:start position:0%
with that money is Debt Service and last
 
00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:06.680 align:start position:0%
year we spent 28.3 million paying off
 
00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:07.710 align:start position:0%
year we spent 28.3 million paying off
our

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:07.720 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
debt um our renewal and replacement
 
00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
program is the third category this is
 
00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:16.360 align:start position:0%
where we advertise our projects to keep
 
00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
the system in good working order those
 
00:12:20.829 --> 00:12:20.839 align:start position:0%
are like our resurfacing projects our
 
00:12:23.389 --> 00:12:23.399 align:start position:0%
drainage repair project guard rail toll
 
00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
plaza rehab Bridge painting and Bridge
 
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
rehabs and then the fourth category we
 
00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
spend where the money goes is the
 
00:12:32.949 --> 00:12:32.959 align:start position:0%
capital expansion that is also part of
 
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
the state's 10year Transportation um
 
00:12:39.829 --> 00:12:39.839 align:start position:0%
plan AKA 10year plan and these projects
 
00:12:44.069 --> 00:12:44.079 align:start position:0%
um are involving on the DOA Rochester a
 
00:12:47.269 --> 00:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
the widening from Nashwood of Bedford um
 
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
Newington shed and also the Newton Dober
 
00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
production um Dober pedestrian bike
 
00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
bridge and the capital expenses for last
 
00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:00.040 align:start position:0%
year was 36.7 million all the revenue is
 
00:13:01.829 --> 00:13:01.839 align:start position:0%
put right back into the system to
 
00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:03.560 align:start position:0%
benefit the users of the
 
00:13:05.949 --> 00:13:05.959 align:start position:0%
system um the turnpike system operates
 
00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
under the easy path system which
 
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
consists of 35 toll agencies in 19
 
00:13:13.189 --> 00:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
States and provides a seamless and
 
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
effective and efficient way to collect
 
00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
toll for instate residents and out ofate
 
00:13:21.829 --> 00:13:21.839 align:start position:0%
residents um typically where you these
 
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
tolls are in Easy Pass Lanes or in open
 
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
road toll Lanes or at all electronic
 
00:13:29.949 --> 00:13:29.959 align:start position:0%
tolling environment and fiscal year 23
 
00:13:57.749 --> 00:13:57.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:00.189 --> 00:14:00.199 align:start position:0%
110.71202012 account options you can
 
00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
have a transponder account where we read
 
00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:04.600 align:start position:0%
your transponder we also have a license
 
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
plate option where we read the license
 
00:14:10.509 --> 00:14:10.519 align:start position:0%
plate and then we also have a 7-Day
 
00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:12.680 align:start position:0%
postpay that is where somebody who goes
 
00:14:14.389 --> 00:14:14.399 align:start position:0%
through the toll who doesn't have the
 
00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
money they can go online and pay it
 
00:14:19.069 --> 00:14:19.079 align:start position:0%
within seven days after the toll and
 
00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
that is just the toll pair no other fees
 
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:24.680 align:start position:0%
are added on to
 
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:28.160 align:start position:0%
it um when the when they fail to pay and
 
00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
incur several a lot of a number of
 
00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:33.880 align:start position:0%
violations um the customers are faced
 
00:14:36.189 --> 00:14:36.199 align:start position:0%
with suspension of vehicle registration
 
00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
this is a total collection enforcement
 
00:14:40.829 --> 00:14:40.839 align:start position:0%
method as known as DMV hold which has
 
00:14:40.839 --> 00:14:41.829 align:start position:0%
method as known as DMV hold which has
been

00:14:41.829 --> 00:14:41.839 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:14:44.189 --> 00:14:44.199 align:start position:0%
effective um New Hampshire residents
 
00:14:46.829 --> 00:14:46.839 align:start position:0%
face the consequence a vehicle
 
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
registration suspension for failure to
 
00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:52.240 align:start position:0%
pay tolls plus residents of Maine and
 
00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:55.720 align:start position:0%
mass who fail to pay New Hampshire tolls
 
00:14:59.590 --> 00:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
this is due to our toll re um collection
 
00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:02.120 align:start position:0%
reciprocity enforcement agreements we
 
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
have the department opposes the bill
 
00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
which would eliminate our reciprocity
 
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
toll collection enforcement agreements
 
00:15:10.509 --> 00:15:10.519 align:start position:0%
with massam main which have been
 
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
effective since
 
00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:15.160 align:start position:0%
2011 with these agreements we are only
 
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
we are only be suspending vehicle
 
00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
without these agreements we only
 
00:15:21.189 --> 00:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
suspending Vehicles registrations with
 
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents and allow mass
 
00:15:26.749 --> 00:15:26.759 align:start position:0%
and Maine to continue to violate on our
 
00:15:30.389 --> 00:15:30.399 align:start position:0%
system these agreements are presently in
 
00:15:32.309 --> 00:15:32.319 align:start position:0%
place so New Hampshire can collect tolls
 
00:15:34.629 --> 00:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
from our bordering states which are also
 
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
the the states that mainly use our
 
00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:39.350 align:start position:0%
the the states that mainly use our
facilities

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
um now I'd like to explain the Easy
 
00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
paath System to help with understanding
 
00:15:47.629 --> 00:15:47.639 align:start position:0%
of uh the fiscal note we
 
00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
submitted um there's an easy path system
 
00:15:52.949 --> 00:15:52.959 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned there's electronic toll
 
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
Lanes through the electronic toll Lanes
 
00:15:58.670 --> 00:15:58.680 align:start position:0%
approximately 74% of the traffic going
 
00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:01.000 align:start position:0%
through there have Easy Pass accounts so
 
00:16:03.749 --> 00:16:03.759 align:start position:0%
we are um processing their payment
 
00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:06.920 align:start position:0%
through their accounts another 177% of
 
00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
them we call undefined transactions are
 
00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
vehicles that go through where we don't
 
00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
read a
 
00:16:15.949 --> 00:16:15.959 align:start position:0%
transponder um and we often with those
 
00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
we take a picture of their
 
00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
plate all these transactions and images
 
00:16:24.189 --> 00:16:24.199 align:start position:0%
of the plate are sent to our Easy Pass
 
00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:26.720 align:start position:0%
vendor the Easy Pass vendor reviews the
 
00:16:30.189 --> 00:16:30.199 align:start position:0%
plate the state the number I mean the
 
00:16:31.949 --> 00:16:31.959 align:start position:0%
plate number the plate the state and the
 
00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
plate type and ties that image to the
 
00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
transaction in the fiscal note there was
 
00:16:41.629 --> 00:16:41.639 align:start position:0%
a reference in June 2023 of having 1.6
 
00:16:44.189 --> 00:16:44.199 align:start position:0%
million unpaid transactions that was for
 
00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
that month in June of the unpa
 
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
transactions that went through the toll
 
00:16:50.749 --> 00:16:50.759 align:start position:0%
plaza of and I'm going to try to break
 
00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
that down to explain what happened to
 
00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:53.910 align:start position:0%
that down to explain what happened to
those

00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:16:57.629 --> 00:16:57.639 align:start position:0%
transactions 43% of those transactions
 
00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
became image tolls which are people who
 
00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:02.600 align:start position:0%
we who didn't have their transponder in
 
00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:05.000 align:start position:0%
their vehicle and we were able to charge
 
00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
to their Easy Pass account through their
 
00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:09.039 align:start position:0%
license plate or it could have also been

a license plate account 133% of those
 
00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
got rejected those could be you know bad

images no front plate um and the weather
 
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
now we get a lot of rejects because of
 
00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:26.360 align:start position:0%

Jersey of those state of those invoices
 
00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 23 we issued 1.9 million
 
00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:29.310 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 23 we issued 1.9 million
invoices

00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:29.320 align:start position:0%
invoices
 
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
of those when you when we first issue an
 
00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:35.039 align:start position:0%
in first invoice the customer has 30
 
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
days to
 
00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
pay um if not paid in 30 days it goes to
 
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:42.640 align:start position:0%
a second invoice and then the customer
 
00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
has another 30 days to pay that invoice
 
00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
actually comes on pink paper too we're
 
00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:51.200 align:start position:0%
hopeing that it stands out to them um if
 
00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
they don't pay that second invoice they
 
00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:57.400 align:start position:0%
have 30 we issue a violation notice and
 
00:18:59.149 --> 00:18:59.159 align:start position:0%
then they have 30 days to pay the
 
00:18:59.159 --> 00:19:01.350 align:start position:0%
then they have 30 days to pay the
violation

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
violation
 
00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:05.480 align:start position:0%
notice DMV hold which is what this law
 
00:19:08.149 --> 00:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
is referred to happens when a customer
 
00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
has 10 transactions at a violation
 
00:19:13.549 --> 00:19:13.559 align:start position:0%
notice so they have to accumulate at
 
00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
least 10 transactions at a violation
 
00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
level before we can start the DMV hold
 
00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:21.720 align:start position:0%
process um and what that does is it
 
00:19:24.549 --> 00:19:24.559 align:start position:0%
creates a hold file for that specific
 
00:19:24.559 --> 00:19:26.350 align:start position:0%
creates a hold file for that specific
vehicle

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:26.360 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:31.480 align:start position:0%
owner um at this after that we
 
00:19:33.789 --> 00:19:33.799 align:start position:0%
personally reach out to each customer
 
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
and make them an offer instead of
 
00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:38.600 align:start position:0%
sending them to DMV for the suspension
 
00:19:40.549 --> 00:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
they have 30 days to pay that and if
 
00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
they don't pay that then they get sent
 
00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:44.240 align:start position:0%
to DMV
 
00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
hold uh or to DMV DMV then sends them
 
00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
out a letter informing them possible
 
00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:53.400 align:start position:0%
expension suspension due to the um
 
00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:56.039 align:start position:0%
unpaid tolls and they got 30 days to pay
 
00:19:58.590 --> 00:19:58.600 align:start position:0%
that and if they don't pay that then the
 
00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
customer gets put into DMV hold which is
 
00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:03.310 align:start position:0%
customer gets put into DMV hold which is
registration

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:03.320 align:start position:0%
registration
 
00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
suspension um the register owner who
 
00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
goes through this they have received a
 
00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
lot of notices you know you typically
 
00:20:12.909 --> 00:20:12.919 align:start position:0%
get nine to 12 pieces of mail consisting
 
00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:15.880 align:start position:0%
of these first second and violation
 
00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:19.240 align:start position:0%
notices all the notices go to the
 
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
registration the register owner's
 
00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
address that is at DMV that's where we
 
00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
get all our addresses
 
00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
from um in reference to the DMV hold in
 
00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23 we had approximately
 
00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
75,7 of them some of those were
 
00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:38.280 align:start position:0%
duplicate plates the same person going
 
00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:40.480 align:start position:0%
through the toll plaza so which brought
 
00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:43.480 align:start position:0%
us down to 7 70,000 DMV
 
00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:45.640 align:start position:0%
holds um of these DMV holds
 
00:20:48.669 --> 00:20:48.679 align:start position:0%
approximately 5 50,000 are New Hampshire
 
00:20:50.789 --> 00:20:50.799 align:start position:0%
plates and
 
00:20:54.789 --> 00:20:54.799 align:start position:0%
15,600 mass and 3,700
 
00:20:57.789 --> 00:20:57.799 align:start position:0%
remain presently we are Smit in DMV
 
00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:00.440 align:start position:0%
holds for Massa main about we're at a
 
00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
limit of 20 per month and that's because
 
00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
it's a labor effort it's not automated
 
00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:07.480 align:start position:0%
with DMV which is something we like to
 
00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
do with the
 
00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:14.360 align:start position:0%
DMVs of those 15,000 DMV holds in um
 
00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:15.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
00:21:18.789 --> 00:21:18.799 align:start position:0%
23 um the total value the total amount
 
00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
was around
 
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
$420,000 um our typical collection rate
 
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
is around 69% and that would equal to
 
00:21:27.039 --> 00:21:29.110 align:start position:0%
is around 69% and that would equal to
318

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
318
 
00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
,000 in our fiscal note we just noted
 
00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
what was pay um in fiscal year 23 which
 
00:21:36.789 --> 00:21:36.799 align:start position:0%
was the
 
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
92,000 um some of that the reason why we
 
00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:43.919 align:start position:0%
aren't able to get the whole all the 318
 
00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
is because we're it's limit to 20 per
 
00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
month it's a manual effort so that
 
00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
reduces our chance of collecting
 
00:21:54.269 --> 00:21:54.279 align:start position:0%
everything but the 318 is what we
 
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
estimate we would be able to get if we
 
00:21:59.510 --> 00:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
were able to go autom made
 
00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:04.520 align:start position:0%
it um in Maine we had 300 3,700 DMV
 
00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
holds excuse me which is approximately
 
00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:09.880 align:start position:0%
about $83,000 in tolls um with a
 
00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:13.240 align:start position:0%
collection rate of 69% we would get 60
 
00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:15.320 align:start position:0%
$60,000 for
 
00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
that in conclusion the fiscal year 23
 
00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
total revenue is
 
00:22:24.549 --> 00:22:24.559 align:start position:0%
$378,000 from invoice from Main and mass
 
00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
invoicing violation processing that we
 
00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
may not
 
00:22:32.669 --> 00:22:32.679 align:start position:0%
we may not get if this DMV reciprocity
 
00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
is removed a lot that money isn't a lot
 
00:22:37.789 --> 00:22:37.799 align:start position:0%
of money but it does support a lot of
 
00:22:40.549 --> 00:22:40.559 align:start position:0%
those programs that I mentioned
 
00:22:44.269 --> 00:22:44.279 align:start position:0%
before also you can't forget too there's
 
00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:47.240 align:start position:0%
33% of the total revenue from Mass and
 
00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:49.480 align:start position:0%
Maine that we collect money through
 
00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:51.400 align:start position:0%
their Easy Pass
 
00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
accounts some of those people might find
 
00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:56.200 align:start position:0%
out oh there's no more DMV hold there's
 
00:22:59.310 --> 00:22:59.320 align:start position:0%
not a hammer on this they might decide
 
00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:00.520 align:start position:0%
they're not going to they're going to
 
00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
take their Easy Pass transponder out of
 
00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:04.840 align:start position:0%
their car because it's free toll in New
 
00:23:09.549 --> 00:23:09.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um a dis discon of this DMV
 
00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:11.960 align:start position:0%
reciprocity with mass m also does not
 
00:23:14.789 --> 00:23:14.799 align:start position:0%
treat New Hampshire residents compared
 
00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
to our neighboring states that means New
 
00:23:18.549 --> 00:23:18.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents are getting
 
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
penalized for DMV hold and neighboring
 
00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
states will not get
 
00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
penalized um lastly to um we didn't
 
00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
mention it in our fiscal note but if the
 
00:23:31.909 --> 00:23:31.919 align:start position:0%
bill is passed there is some edits that
 
00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
need to be in there because it
 
00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:36.200 align:start position:0%
references removal of the reciprocity of
 
00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
the iag that we can't remove that is
 
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
like the trans when we're collecting
 
00:23:43.789 --> 00:23:43.799 align:start position:0%
transponders and we're
 
00:23:46.269 --> 00:23:46.279 align:start position:0%
exchanging um transactions between the
 
00:23:48.029 --> 00:23:48.039 align:start position:0%
agency we need
 
00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:52.600 align:start position:0%
that um in the in the law still um that
 
00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
concludes my testimony I'm happy to
 
00:23:57.269 --> 00:23:57.279 align:start position:0%
answer any questions the committee may
 
00:23:57.279 --> 00:23:59.990 align:start position:0%
answer any questions the committee may
have

00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
um thank you uh thank you for the
 
00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
testimony could I also ask It prepares
 
00:24:06.669 --> 00:24:06.679 align:start position:0%
you had a a written statement would you
 
00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
would you please submit a copy of that
 
00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:11.960 align:start position:0%
to the clerk yes for your we can I wrote
 
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
on this can we send it wait yeah send an
 
00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
EMA I think it'd be very helpful for
 
00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
represent Jack yeah actually I was going
 
00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
to uh raise that if you could just give
 
00:24:22.029 --> 00:24:22.039 align:start position:0%
me the one they've written on that would

previous
 
00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:40.520 align:start position:0%
comment is that is the driver's license
 
00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
immediately suspended or are they going
 
00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
back to your testimony given the
 
00:26:47.909 --> 00:26:47.919 align:start position:0%
appropriate time to receive the bill and
 
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:52.720 align:start position:0%
make begin to make payment to the
 
00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation or to the
 
00:26:58.110 --> 00:26:58.120 align:start position:0%
applicable state so that they are put
 
00:27:01.269 --> 00:27:01.279 align:start position:0%
back into good standing if if it's
 
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
somebody who's on New Hampshire
 
00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
traveling on main turnpike you're
 
00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:07.880 align:start position:0%
referencing they would get that same
 
00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
letter from our New Hampshire DMV and
 
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
they'd have to they get 30 days to pay
 
00:27:14.149 --> 00:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
the bill and stuff like that so they
 
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:17.279 align:start position:0%

state of Connecticut is it still a
 
00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:52.600 align:start position:0%
significant amount um with the state of
 
00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
Connecticut no it's not a significant
 
00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:57.240 align:start position:0%
amount of violations or invoice is
 
00:28:00.029 --> 00:28:00.039 align:start position:0%
violation ations that we sent out there
 
00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:04.440 align:start position:0%

necessarily Lily required to travel a

toll road to get from point A to point B
 
00:28:23.549 --> 00:28:23.559 align:start position:0%
that there are alternative non-tool
 
00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
roads that one can travel and avoid
 
00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
having to pay a toll at all in New
 
00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:31.470 align:start position:0%

call line has a long wait time I agree
 
00:29:02.789 --> 00:29:02.799 align:start position:0%
with that the DMV or like the violation
 
00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:05.600 align:start position:0%

an option on the on the on the uh say
 
00:29:14.549 --> 00:29:14.559 align:start position:0%

00:40:55.319 --> 00:42:51.950 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:55.230 --> 00:42:55.240 align:start position:0%

00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:00.430 align:start position:0%
looking to exec after after our session
tomorrow

00:43:00.430 --> 00:43:00.440 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:02.829 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
1547

00:43:02.829 --> 00:43:02.839 align:start position:0%
1547
 
00:43:02.839 --> 00:43:05.630 align:start position:0%
1547
1488

00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:05.640 align:start position:0%
1488
 
00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:08.069 align:start position:0%
1488
1043

00:43:08.069 --> 00:43:08.079 align:start position:0%
1043
 
00:43:10.510 --> 00:43:10.520 align:start position:0%
1379 and
 
00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
1253 those are all the bills you heard
 
00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:15.240 align:start position:0%
last week I think it was Wednesday when
 
00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
we were in here but in the event we
 
00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
can't get there after session we're
 
00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:25.079 align:start position:0%
considering coming in the Tuesday the
 
00:43:29.470 --> 00:43:29.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:33.790 --> 00:43:33.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:36.680 align:start position:0%
schedule so we would be in here probably
 
00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
probably be done by lunch unless we have
 
00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
and we'd start at 10:30 so if there was
 
00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
something that was rubbing one party or
 
00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
the other uh there'll be time to cck us
 
00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
ahead of that and if there is an issue
 
00:43:52.349 --> 00:43:52.359 align:start position:0%
let's let's figure that out we can talk
 
00:43:54.069 --> 00:43:54.079 align:start position:0%
later but and so that would we would
 
00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
come in Tuesday for the morning for then
 
00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
we'd have to come back the next day for
 
00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:00.280 align:start position:0%
hearing I yeah there there's just
 
00:44:01.950 --> 00:44:01.960 align:start position:0%
there's just not enough room the next
 
00:44:05.069 --> 00:44:05.079 align:start position:0%
day to capture that because on the
 
00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
7th um we're planning on um we have a
 
00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:12.040 align:start position:0%
full schedule and we're going to we're
 
00:44:14.549 --> 00:44:14.559 align:start position:0%
going to try and try and exact the bills
 
00:44:14.559 --> 00:44:16.630 align:start position:0%
going to try and try and exact the bills
from

00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:16.640 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
today there's that one that we didn't
 
00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
actually have the hearing on also yeah
 
00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
day that's scheduled for the seventh I
 
00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
believe yeah and then it turns out
 
00:44:30.589 --> 00:44:30.599 align:start position:0%
science told me they had a bill that
 
00:44:33.309 --> 00:44:33.319 align:start position:0%
ended up with them that looked entirely
 
00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
like it should have been here maybe they
 
00:44:38.349 --> 00:44:38.359 align:start position:0%
just exchanged them oh he was told to
 
00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:40.640 align:start position:0%
keep it so yep well we were told that as
 
00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
well yeah so can't thinking a two ven us
 
00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
out yeah they um so we and there there
 
00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
may be problems with me you know putting
 
00:44:59.109 --> 00:44:59.119 align:start position:0%
this on an Exe on the
 
00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
calendar but
 
00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:05.480 align:start position:0%
I I've run into a few issues with this
 
00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:07.960 align:start position:0%
sort of thing this year that never seen
 
00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:11.800 align:start position:0%
ever before in my life legislative life
 
00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
so um we'll we'll try and work that out
 
00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
today and see if that's possible so if
 
00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
all if all goes well with session we're
 
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
going to dis we're going to have
 
00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
executive session on all those bills if
 
00:45:27.790 --> 00:45:27.800 align:start position:0%
for some reason we can't meet tomorrow I
 
00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
deem it's too late um then we will exec
 
00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
on the 6th okay so you can put that on
 
00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:34.990 align:start position:0%
on the 6th okay so you can put that on
your

00:45:54.880 --> 01:01:31.230 align:start position:0%
 
m

01:01:31.230 --> 01:01:31.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:38.309 --> 01:01:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
testifying okay sorry about that go
 
01:01:44.029 --> 01:01:44.039 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you Mr chairman and
 
01:01:46.390 --> 01:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the public works
 
01:01:48.309 --> 01:01:48.319 align:start position:0%
and Highway committee my name is
 
01:01:51.150 --> 01:01:51.160 align:start position:0%
representative Caitlyn cab and I'm here
 
01:01:53.630 --> 01:01:53.640 align:start position:0%
to introduce this bill which is
 
01:01:56.589 --> 01:01:56.599 align:start position:0%
establishing a study committee relative
 
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
to alternatives for the road tool and
 
01:02:02.710 --> 01:02:02.720 align:start position:0%
vehicle registration fees including
 
01:02:06.029 --> 01:02:06.039 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle registration fees and
 
01:02:08.309 --> 01:02:08.319 align:start position:0%
the reason behind this is I know that
 
01:02:10.029 --> 01:02:10.039 align:start position:0%
there was a commission that had been
 
01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
ongoing but it was more focused on road
 
01:02:14.589 --> 01:02:14.599 align:start position:0%
tools and it didn't include vehicle
 
01:02:16.710 --> 01:02:16.720 align:start position:0%
registrations the cost of vehicle
 
01:02:20.589 --> 01:02:20.599 align:start position:0%
registrations is really becoming pretty
 
01:02:24.750 --> 01:02:24.760 align:start position:0%
expensive for for many families I know
 
01:02:28.710 --> 01:02:28.720 align:start position:0%
for my um Grand Highlander that I just
 
01:02:31.630 --> 01:02:31.640 align:start position:0%
got which was under $50,000 car um
 
01:02:35.069 --> 01:02:35.079 align:start position:0%
because it was a 20124 model I paid uh
 
01:02:38.349 --> 01:02:38.359 align:start position:0%
$984 to register it this year and it
 
01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
meeting last year and then because again
 
01:02:44.349 --> 01:02:44.359 align:start position:0%
I bought it in 2023 as a 2024 model I'll
 
01:02:47.630 --> 01:02:47.640 align:start position:0%
have to pay that again next year um and
 
01:02:50.430 --> 01:02:50.440 align:start position:0%
then it the the amount kind of decreases
 
01:02:52.670 --> 01:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
each year but it's just they're really
 
01:02:54.390 --> 01:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
becoming quite expensive and I think I
 
01:02:56.029 --> 01:02:56.039 align:start position:0%
think we need to look into some
 
01:02:57.990 --> 01:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
alternatives to to see about making
 
01:03:01.190 --> 01:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
those be less I think ultimately they're
 
01:03:03.029 --> 01:03:03.039 align:start position:0%
the reason behind them obviously is to
 
01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
pay for the upkeep of the roads and a
 
01:03:09.309 --> 01:03:09.319 align:start position:0%
new car isn't causing
 
01:03:11.870 --> 01:03:11.880 align:start position:0%
more wear and tear on a road certainly
 
01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
than an old car is and one could argue
 
01:03:17.190 --> 01:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
that perhaps you know a a a heavier
 
01:03:19.269 --> 01:03:19.279 align:start position:0%
weight vehicle is going to cause more
 
01:03:22.230 --> 01:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
wear and tear on a road than a smaller
 
01:03:25.109 --> 01:03:25.119 align:start position:0%
car would and uh
 
01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:26.680 align:start position:0%
I think it's worth looking into seeing
 
01:03:28.430 --> 01:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
what we can do about this I I had
 
01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
received several emails from
 
01:03:31.990 --> 01:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
constituents who were concerned about
 
01:03:34.309 --> 01:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
the rising costs of of uh car
 
01:03:37.630 --> 01:03:37.640 align:start position:0%
registrations and I uh wanted to bring
 
01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
this forward for your consideration I'm
 
01:03:41.309 --> 01:03:41.319 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions okay all
 
01:03:43.309 --> 01:03:43.319 align:start position:0%
right thank you representative questions
 
01:03:44.750 --> 01:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
uh yes go ahead please representative
 
01:03:47.109 --> 01:03:47.119 align:start position:0%
blue thank you Mr chairman and
 
01:03:49.549 --> 01:03:49.559 align:start position:0%
representative kab good to see you um
 
01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:51.839 align:start position:0%
regarding your bill
 
01:03:54.670 --> 01:03:54.680 align:start position:0%
on under the membership it's it's listed
 
01:03:56.589 --> 01:03:56.599 align:start position:0%
as only four members do you think we
 
01:03:58.269 --> 01:03:58.279 align:start position:0%
need to have a fifth member so that it's
 
01:04:00.750 --> 01:04:00.760 align:start position:0%
odd if so would we contemplate another
 
01:04:02.150 --> 01:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
member of the Senate or the governor's
 
01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:08.870 --> 01:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
or and if you weren't prepared for that
 
01:04:10.630 --> 01:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
question I apologize I actually think
 
01:04:12.150 --> 01:04:12.160 align:start position:0%
that it would be okay that way I think
 
01:04:14.109 --> 01:04:14.119 align:start position:0%
that there's been a lot of I think that
 
01:04:15.789 --> 01:04:15.799 align:start position:0%
it's important and especially in work
 
01:04:17.109 --> 01:04:17.119 align:start position:0%
like this that we we would have a
 
01:04:19.269 --> 01:04:19.279 align:start position:0%
bipartisan kind of solution there and I
 
01:04:20.589 --> 01:04:20.599 align:start position:0%
I would hope that it would be a solution
 
01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
that everybody could agree on because
 
01:04:24.870 --> 01:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
that would be the ultimate goal a lot of
 
01:04:26.670 --> 01:04:26.680 align:start position:0%
my pretty much all of my bills that I
 
01:04:28.269 --> 01:04:28.279 align:start position:0%
put in this year were all bipartisan I
 
01:04:29.630 --> 01:04:29.640 align:start position:0%
think we need to work together to come
 
01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
up with a solution and find something
 
01:04:33.430 --> 01:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
that everybody can agree on because if
 
01:04:35.430 --> 01:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
we can get four people to agree then we
 
01:04:36.750 --> 01:04:36.760 align:start position:0%
can probably get the majority of the
 
01:04:38.269 --> 01:04:38.279 align:start position:0%
house to agree as well and the same with
 
01:04:39.470 --> 01:04:39.480 align:start position:0%
the Senate so I think there's something
 
01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
to be said with getting everybody on a
 
01:04:43.870 --> 01:04:43.880 align:start position:0%
on a committee to agree yes
 
01:04:46.750 --> 01:04:46.760 align:start position:0%
please chairman and then on on the uh
 
01:04:49.150 --> 01:04:49.160 align:start position:0%
the due date of November 1st 2024 do you
 
01:04:51.150 --> 01:04:51.160 align:start position:0%
think that provides ample time of
 
01:04:52.589 --> 01:04:52.599 align:start position:0%
roughly about six months for the
 
01:04:55.829 --> 01:04:55.839 align:start position:0%
committee to to do it's due diligence to
 
01:04:58.230 --> 01:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
provide a report that gives gives us
 
01:05:00.589 --> 01:05:00.599 align:start position:0%
some direction of where we need to
 
01:05:03.230 --> 01:05:03.240 align:start position:0%
go I do think so okay I do I'm not
 
01:05:04.750 --> 01:05:04.760 align:start position:0%
looking for it to be ex you know an
 
01:05:08.269 --> 01:05:08.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:10.470 --> 01:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
think some of these committees kind of
 
01:05:11.829 --> 01:05:11.839 align:start position:0%
can go on and on and on and I'm
 
01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
certainly not looking to have that that
 
01:05:16.470 --> 01:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
happen and I think
 
01:05:18.630 --> 01:05:18.640 align:start position:0%
that I have some of the data but I
 
01:05:19.870 --> 01:05:19.880 align:start position:0%
wasn't able to kind of go through it
 
01:05:21.230 --> 01:05:21.240 align:start position:0%
quickly enough which is part of the
 
01:05:23.069 --> 01:05:23.079 align:start position:0%
reason for for putting in for this this
 
01:05:24.510 --> 01:05:24.520 align:start position:0%
committee and I think it's it's
 
01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
certainly not my wheelhouse so to speak
 
01:05:29.390 --> 01:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
so I think having some people that are
 
01:05:31.829 --> 01:05:31.839 align:start position:0%
more experienced in this look at it
 
01:05:33.630 --> 01:05:33.640 align:start position:0%
would would be better anyway okay thank
 
01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony and for the
 
01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
record I do support the Bill thank you
 
01:05:37.549 --> 01:05:37.559 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you thank you
 
01:05:39.230 --> 01:05:39.240 align:start position:0%
represent Bo further questions of
 
01:05:41.269 --> 01:05:41.279 align:start position:0%
represent cev right is that correct
 
01:05:43.910 --> 01:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
correct okay uh from the committee any
 
01:05:45.549 --> 01:05:45.559 align:start position:0%
further yes go ahead please
 
01:05:45.559 --> 01:05:46.630 align:start position:0%
further yes go ahead please
representative

01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:05:48.750 --> 01:05:48.760 align:start position:0%
Newton thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:05:50.750 --> 01:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question you mentioned in
 
01:05:53.430 --> 01:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
your testimony that auto registrations
 
01:05:56.589 --> 01:05:56.599 align:start position:0%
are getting extremely expensive would
 
01:05:59.789 --> 01:05:59.799 align:start position:0%
this could you see this commission or
 
01:06:03.870 --> 01:06:03.880 align:start position:0%
committee look into exactly what autor
 
01:06:05.870 --> 01:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
restoration money is going towards
 
01:06:08.710 --> 01:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
because in Rochester almost 5 million a
 
01:06:11.430 --> 01:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
year goes into a slush fund it goes into
 
01:06:13.750 --> 01:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
the unassigned fund balance not to fix
 
01:06:15.789 --> 01:06:15.799 align:start position:0%
roads it goes into the unassigned fund
 
01:06:18.670 --> 01:06:18.680 align:start position:0%
balance would you see this committee
 
01:06:21.390 --> 01:06:21.400 align:start position:0%
possibly looking at that as a way to
 
01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
reduce the
 
01:06:25.309 --> 01:06:25.319 align:start position:0%
cost think that the committee could
 
01:06:27.470 --> 01:06:27.480 align:start position:0%
could consider all alternatives to to
 
01:06:28.990 --> 01:06:29.000 align:start position:0%
reduce the costs that's certainly
 
01:06:31.630 --> 01:06:31.640 align:start position:0%
something worth looking into making sure
 
01:06:33.870 --> 01:06:33.880 align:start position:0%
that again it is going for the purpose
 
01:06:36.910 --> 01:06:36.920 align:start position:0%
that it's supposed to be purposed for so
 
01:06:39.150 --> 01:06:39.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely I think looking at it is a
 
01:06:41.870 --> 01:06:41.880 align:start position:0%
good idea okay thank you yes represent
 
01:06:43.510 --> 01:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
Jack please uh thank you Mr chairman and

sir
 
03:18:46.830 --> 03:18:46.840 align:start position:0%
hi I'm representative Eric Gallagher I
 
03:18:50.429 --> 03:18:50.439 align:start position:0%
represent Mar County District 20 which
 
03:18:54.870 --> 03:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
is conquered Ward six um it's just down
 
03:18:57.590 --> 03:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
that way a little bit within walking
 
03:19:00.510 --> 03:19:00.520 align:start position:0%
distance which is something that's
 
03:19:02.269 --> 03:19:02.279 align:start position:0%
actually relevant to this bill since
 
03:19:08.429 --> 03:19:08.439 align:start position:0%
it's about um being a pedestrian um so
 
03:19:12.830 --> 03:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
um yeah I I don't have a car and thus
 
03:19:16.189 --> 03:19:16.199 align:start position:0%
try to walk as many places as possible
 
03:19:16.199 --> 03:19:17.309 align:start position:0%
try to walk as many places as possible
um

03:19:17.309 --> 03:19:17.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:21.670 --> 03:19:21.680 align:start position:0%
so I recently um changed dentists and my
 
03:19:24.469 --> 03:19:24.479 align:start position:0%
new dentist is out more on Pleasant
 
03:19:28.269 --> 03:19:28.279 align:start position:0%
Street that ways so um my route for
 
03:19:32.030 --> 03:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
walking there takes me um along Pleasant
 
03:19:35.030 --> 03:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
Street past the state hospital grounds
 
03:19:37.389 --> 03:19:37.399 align:start position:0%
and if you ever been by the state
 
03:19:39.070 --> 03:19:39.080 align:start position:0%
hospital grounds before one thing you'll
 
03:19:41.630 --> 03:19:41.640 align:start position:0%
notice is that there actually isn't a
 
03:19:42.990 --> 03:19:43.000 align:start position:0%
sidewalk walk
 
03:19:46.349 --> 03:19:46.359 align:start position:0%
along that portion of Pleasant Street
 
03:19:48.950 --> 03:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
there so I got in touch with the city
 
03:19:51.269 --> 03:19:51.279 align:start position:0%
councilor I knew um well now now the
 
03:19:54.630 --> 03:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
mayor Byron Champlain of conquered about
 
03:19:57.830 --> 03:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
why there isn't a sidewalk there
 
03:20:01.870 --> 03:20:01.880 align:start position:0%
currently and apparently it's because
 
03:20:03.750 --> 03:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
the state owns the
 
03:20:08.429 --> 03:20:08.439 align:start position:0%
land and um that thus also owns the
 
03:20:12.870 --> 03:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
telephone poles on it and
 
03:20:15.110 --> 03:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
that the telephone poles would need to
 
03:20:19.990 --> 03:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
be moved in order to put a sidewalk down
 
03:20:23.790 --> 03:20:23.800 align:start position:0%
um and there isn't apparently isn't
 
03:20:25.349 --> 03:20:25.359 align:start position:0%
currently a way
 
03:20:31.670 --> 03:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
for the city to do that so um I filed
 
03:20:34.150 --> 03:20:34.160 align:start position:0%
this bill to address that sort of
 
03:20:37.950 --> 03:20:37.960 align:start position:0%
situation um I got in touch with n g of
 
03:20:40.910 --> 03:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
the municipal Association for help with
 
03:20:44.950 --> 03:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
drafting it uh so he helped provide um a
 
03:20:49.590 --> 03:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
lot of the wording
 
03:20:49.600 --> 03:20:51.510 align:start position:0%
lot of the wording
um

03:20:51.510 --> 03:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:56.229 --> 03:20:56.239 align:start position:0%
so um yeah I forget the class Road
 
03:20:56.239 --> 03:20:57.870 align:start position:0%
so um yeah I forget the class Road
specifically

03:20:57.870 --> 03:20:57.880 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
03:21:02.070 --> 03:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
um that Pleasant Street there is
 
03:21:04.830 --> 03:21:04.840 align:start position:0%
um along the state hospital grounds but
 
03:21:07.910 --> 03:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
we included class one two three and four
 
03:21:09.950 --> 03:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
um just inclusively to make sure we'd
 
03:21:12.469 --> 03:21:12.479 align:start position:0%
covered all the bases um
 
03:21:16.630 --> 03:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
and so uh one one bit of feedback
 
03:21:20.229 --> 03:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
um I got during the drafting process the
 
03:21:23.150 --> 03:21:23.160 align:start position:0%
first draft had 30 days of receiving the
 
03:21:25.070 --> 03:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
request I heard that might be actually
 
03:21:28.389 --> 03:21:28.399 align:start position:0%
too short to process it so um I
 
03:21:31.389 --> 03:21:31.399 align:start position:0%
increased it to 90 days um which
 
03:21:33.950 --> 03:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
hopefully is enough
 
03:21:39.110 --> 03:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:43.830 --> 03:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
um yeah so and also hopefully um so what
 
03:21:47.150 --> 03:21:47.160 align:start position:0%
while I mentioned the specific case um
 
03:21:50.229 --> 03:21:50.239 align:start position:0%
in conquered that inspired this um I've
 
03:21:51.750 --> 03:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
also heard of other
 
03:21:55.110 --> 03:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
communities where it might be relevant
 
03:21:56.950 --> 03:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
too like there was some news from the
 
03:22:00.590 --> 03:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
Sea Coast I think it was Hampton or Ry
 
03:22:03.389 --> 03:22:03.399 align:start position:0%
where they were trying to figure out how
 
03:22:07.189 --> 03:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
to put a sidewalk along uh a state-owned
 
03:22:09.510 --> 03:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
road and couldn't figure out how to do
 
03:22:12.309 --> 03:22:12.319 align:start position:0%
it so I think this bill would be helpful
 
03:22:15.429 --> 03:22:15.439 align:start position:0%
over there too um
 
03:22:19.429 --> 03:22:19.439 align:start position:0%
so yeah I I think um this boat would be
 
03:22:23.150 --> 03:22:23.160 align:start position:0%
helpful for pedestrians and that
 
03:22:24.950 --> 03:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
pedestrians ship is something that we
 
03:22:27.870 --> 03:22:27.880 align:start position:0%
should encourage it's good for uh
 
03:22:30.870 --> 03:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
People's Health and the environment um
 
03:22:36.349 --> 03:22:36.359 align:start position:0%
and uh so being being um what one
 
03:22:38.150 --> 03:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
question I got is well why not just walk
 
03:22:41.790 --> 03:22:41.800 align:start position:0%
on the shoulder well so that that's
 
03:22:43.630 --> 03:22:43.640 align:start position:0%
that's more dangerous um being on a
 
03:22:45.910 --> 03:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
sidewalk really does help um that having
 
03:22:50.389 --> 03:22:50.399 align:start position:0%
that curb there to protect you from cars
 
03:22:53.750 --> 03:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
that might be um varying a little bit to
 
03:22:57.070 --> 03:22:57.080 align:start position:0%
the side um so yeah as a pedestrian I
 
03:22:58.910 --> 03:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
would much rather be walking on a
 
03:23:01.469 --> 03:23:01.479 align:start position:0%
sidewalk rather than the shoulder of the
 
03:23:05.189 --> 03:23:05.199 align:start position:0%
road um so yeah hopefully this bill will
 
03:23:09.429 --> 03:23:09.439 align:start position:0%
help get help us uh get more of those
 
03:23:12.389 --> 03:23:12.399 align:start position:0%
built and I'll take questions now thank
 
03:23:15.030 --> 03:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
you uh questions for the
 
03:23:18.710 --> 03:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
representative yes representative Eaton
 
03:23:20.990 --> 03:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
please I guess I shouldn't be being
 
03:23:22.910 --> 03:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
specific because it's a bill that
 
03:23:25.590 --> 03:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
affects the entire state
 
03:23:29.590 --> 03:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
but um visualizing my mind going up
 
03:23:32.110 --> 03:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
Pleasant Street and along Fruit
 
03:23:35.510 --> 03:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
Street and I see sidewalks in my mind it
 
03:23:38.189 --> 03:23:38.199 align:start position:0%
may not be on both sides of the road but
 
03:23:40.550 --> 03:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
I thought there was a sidewalk yeah so
 
03:23:42.150 --> 03:23:42.160 align:start position:0%
there is a sidewalk on one inside of the
 
03:23:46.030 --> 03:23:46.040 align:start position:0%
street the thing is due to the um odd
 
03:23:51.030 --> 03:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
Junction layout um at the junction of uh
 
03:23:52.790 --> 03:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
Fruit Street Pleasant Street and Warren
 
03:23:55.950 --> 03:23:55.960 align:start position:0%
Street with five streets there um the
 
03:23:57.870 --> 03:23:57.880 align:start position:0%
side of the street that the sidewalk is
 
03:24:01.510 --> 03:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
on it comes to a point there um like
 
03:24:05.630 --> 03:24:05.640 align:start position:0%
this really narrow acute angle um and
 
03:24:09.550 --> 03:24:09.560 align:start position:0%
you can't actually cross from that point
 
03:24:11.630 --> 03:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
um there's no there's there's no
 
03:24:14.189 --> 03:24:14.199 align:start position:0%
sidewalk to the tip it comes to you have
 
03:24:17.229 --> 03:24:17.239 align:start position:0%
to go back down around the other side of
 
03:24:20.110 --> 03:24:20.120 align:start position:0%
Warren Street to um the
 
03:24:22.790 --> 03:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
nearest crosswalk which is by the high
 
03:24:25.070 --> 03:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
school and then up the other side of
 
03:24:27.550 --> 03:24:27.560 align:start position:0%
Warren Street again which is
 
03:24:30.830 --> 03:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
um ra would is rather
 
03:24:35.590 --> 03:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
inconvenient thank you thank you yes
 
03:24:37.790 --> 03:24:37.800 align:start position:0%
represent thank you Mr chairman and
 
03:24:39.070 --> 03:24:39.080 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher thank you for
 
03:24:43.309 --> 03:24:43.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question if these sidewalk
 
03:24:45.630 --> 03:24:45.640 align:start position:0%
are eventually constructed who's going
 
03:24:47.750 --> 03:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
to be responsible for the overall
 
03:24:50.830 --> 03:24:50.840 align:start position:0%
maintenance and repair if necessary of
 
03:24:50.840 --> 03:24:52.510 align:start position:0%
maintenance and repair if necessary of
said

03:24:52.510 --> 03:24:52.520 align:start position:0%
said
 
03:24:55.070 --> 03:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
sidewalks um so yeah it says that in the
 
03:24:59.030 --> 03:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
bill lines 14 to 15 the municipality is
 
03:25:01.269 --> 03:25:01.279 align:start position:0%
responsible for any construction costs
 
03:25:04.630 --> 03:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
and maintenance of the sidewalk um so
 
03:25:05.790 --> 03:25:05.800 align:start position:0%
yeah that's something that the
 
03:25:09.429 --> 03:25:09.439 align:start position:0%
municipality would have to uh make a
 
03:25:11.910 --> 03:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
decision about when applying for it is
 
03:25:14.510 --> 03:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
if they want to be responsible for the
 
03:25:16.229 --> 03:25:16.239 align:start position:0%
maintenance costs or not and if they
 
03:25:18.309 --> 03:25:18.319 align:start position:0%
don't want to be then presumably they
 
03:25:20.910 --> 03:25:20.920 align:start position:0%
would just not apply for it okay thank
 
03:25:22.429 --> 03:25:22.439 align:start position:0%
you for answer thank you thank you Mr
 
03:25:25.870 --> 03:25:25.880 align:start position:0%
chairman yes please thank you chair
 
03:25:29.110 --> 03:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
represent the does is the m is the
 
03:25:31.750 --> 03:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
municipality on the hook for utility
 
03:25:33.750 --> 03:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
relocations too you mentioned in this
 
03:25:38.670 --> 03:25:38.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:38.680 --> 03:25:40.469 align:start position:0%
 
polls

03:25:40.469 --> 03:25:40.479 align:start position:0%
polls
 
03:25:40.479 --> 03:25:42.429 align:start position:0%
polls
um

03:25:42.429 --> 03:25:42.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:45.510 --> 03:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
so it's a request
 
03:25:50.469 --> 03:25:50.479 align:start position:0%
for an easement um
 
03:25:50.479 --> 03:25:52.229 align:start position:0%
for an easement um
and

03:25:52.229 --> 03:25:52.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:25:55.830 --> 03:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
um I mean I think that would be written
 
03:26:00.070 --> 03:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
into the terms of the easement
 
03:26:06.990 --> 03:26:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:09.990 --> 03:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
um yeah I I'm not quite sure
 
03:26:13.189 --> 03:26:13.199 align:start position:0%
specifically about like terms of um
 
03:26:14.790 --> 03:26:14.800 align:start position:0%
payment if that's what you mean by on
 
03:26:17.189 --> 03:26:17.199 align:start position:0%
the hook for um but I think that would
 
03:26:19.510 --> 03:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
fit under um being responsible for
 
03:26:22.469 --> 03:26:22.479 align:start position:0%
construction costs thank you represent G
 
03:26:23.990 --> 03:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative jurus any other
 
03:26:28.630 --> 03:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:31.590 --> 03:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
represent I just have a simple
 
03:26:34.670 --> 03:26:34.680 align:start position:0%
question have you already
 
03:26:38.870 --> 03:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
tried asking the do for that
 
03:26:44.429 --> 03:26:44.439 align:start position:0%
easement um not not directly um I think
 
03:26:48.670 --> 03:26:48.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:51.550 --> 03:26:51.560 align:start position:0%
um yeah due to some of the conversations
 
03:26:55.910 --> 03:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
I got started I think um that um it was
 
03:26:58.429 --> 03:26:58.439 align:start position:0%
either the city of conquer or the
 
03:27:01.429 --> 03:27:01.439 align:start position:0%
municipal Association may have um done
 
03:27:07.030 --> 03:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
that for me and um yeah uh decided
 
03:27:10.590 --> 03:27:10.600 align:start position:0%
that uh crafting this legislation would
 
03:27:14.269 --> 03:27:14.279 align:start position:0%
be a Better Way Forward well we did that
 
03:27:16.229 --> 03:27:16.239 align:start position:0%
up followup question represent
 
03:27:18.830 --> 03:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
F we did that up in
 
03:27:18.840 --> 03:27:20.510 align:start position:0%
F we did that up in
Hillsboro

03:27:20.510 --> 03:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro
 
03:27:23.469 --> 03:27:23.479 align:start position:0%
and we've been building a sidewalk now
 
03:27:25.110 --> 03:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
for two
 
03:27:27.790 --> 03:27:27.800 align:start position:0%
years I I just think this might already
 
03:27:29.030 --> 03:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
be a
 
03:27:29.040 --> 03:27:31.030 align:start position:0%
be a
law

03:27:31.030 --> 03:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
law
 
03:27:34.030 --> 03:27:34.040 align:start position:0%
well I don't know I mean maybe it is
 
03:27:36.189 --> 03:27:36.199 align:start position:0%
possible but the city of conquered seems
 
03:27:40.309 --> 03:27:40.319 align:start position:0%
to think that it isn't and the idea here
 
03:27:44.150 --> 03:27:44.160 align:start position:0%
is to reassure the city of conquer that
 
03:27:48.670 --> 03:27:48.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:52.309 --> 03:27:52.319 align:start position:0%
forward thank you represent
 
03:27:54.309 --> 03:27:54.319 align:start position:0%
vulner so I don't know if you've had
 
03:27:56.510 --> 03:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
discussions with DOT but it seems like
 
03:27:58.030 --> 03:27:58.040 align:start position:0%
the different class roads going to have
 
03:28:01.269 --> 03:28:01.279 align:start position:0%
very different considerations a class
 
03:28:03.950 --> 03:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
one road is like an interstate highway
 
03:28:07.229 --> 03:28:07.239 align:start position:0%
and I could see that the do would not
 
03:28:07.239 --> 03:28:08.630 align:start position:0%
and I could see that the do would not
want

03:28:08.630 --> 03:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
want
 
03:28:11.469 --> 03:28:11.479 align:start position:0%
to have pedestrians walking alongside
 
03:28:14.309 --> 03:28:14.319 align:start position:0%
interstate highway and yet this I think
 
03:28:17.309 --> 03:28:17.319 align:start position:0%
would require them to issue that class
 
03:28:19.750 --> 03:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
two are secondary state
 
03:28:23.630 --> 03:28:23.640 align:start position:0%
roads maybe similar issues class three
 
03:28:26.830 --> 03:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
are Forest roads and things like
 
03:28:29.110 --> 03:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
that I can't imagine that would be an
 
03:28:31.030 --> 03:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
issue but why would the municipality be
 
03:28:33.990 --> 03:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
involved in that class four and five are
 
03:28:36.389 --> 03:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
already Municipal roads and why would
 
03:28:39.189 --> 03:28:39.199 align:start position:0%
they be having to go to the state I'm
 
03:28:41.710 --> 03:28:41.720 align:start position:0%
just not sure that this is a General
 
03:28:44.710 --> 03:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
problem that um that this provides a
 
03:28:48.910 --> 03:28:48.920 align:start position:0%
solution to um so yeah thank you for the
 
03:28:54.110 --> 03:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
question um so yeah I kind of
 
03:28:58.710 --> 03:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
um I kind of was over cautious in just
 
03:29:01.110 --> 03:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
uh choosing the number of classes of
 
03:29:04.510 --> 03:29:04.520 align:start position:0%
roads that it would apply to and I'd be
 
03:29:08.309 --> 03:29:08.319 align:start position:0%
open to an amendment that
 
03:29:12.030 --> 03:29:12.040 align:start position:0%
um that reduces it to just the classes
 
03:29:14.550 --> 03:29:14.560 align:start position:0%
that you think are relevant if you think
 
03:29:18.229 --> 03:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
that would be uh helpful in getting the
 
03:29:18.239 --> 03:29:19.229 align:start position:0%
that would be uh helpful in getting the
bill

03:29:19.229 --> 03:29:19.239 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:29:22.790 --> 03:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
passed thank you any further question U
 
03:29:25.429 --> 03:29:25.439 align:start position:0%
for myself and perhaps you already uh
 
03:29:27.590 --> 03:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps you already brought this in
 
03:29:29.670 --> 03:29:29.680 align:start position:0%
represent I apologize if I'm asking it
 
03:29:32.790 --> 03:29:32.800 align:start position:0%
twice you had a conversation with the
 
03:29:35.469 --> 03:29:35.479 align:start position:0%
with the city on it did the city say if
 
03:29:39.630 --> 03:29:39.640 align:start position:0%
you were to if the state was to provide
 
03:29:42.550 --> 03:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
a the ease me that they would move
 
03:29:44.590 --> 03:29:44.600 align:start position:0%
forward with a
 
03:29:44.600 --> 03:29:46.950 align:start position:0%
forward with a
proposal

03:29:46.950 --> 03:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
03:29:52.269 --> 03:29:52.279 align:start position:0%
um I mean not explicitly but
 
03:29:54.590 --> 03:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
um basically they said you should you
 
03:29:56.870 --> 03:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
should file legislation so that's what I
 
03:29:59.670 --> 03:29:59.680 align:start position:0%
did and I'm assuming that in telling me
 
03:30:03.550 --> 03:30:03.560 align:start position:0%
that that they were implying that if I
 
03:30:06.030 --> 03:30:06.040 align:start position:0%
did then they therefore would all right
 
03:30:07.710 --> 03:30:07.720 align:start position:0%
go ahead and use it thank you for your
 
03:30:10.389 --> 03:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
response any further questions seeing no
 
03:30:12.269 --> 03:30:12.279 align:start position:0%
further questions a representative thank

03:30:32.389 --> 03:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
afternoon good afternoon Mr chairman and
 
03:30:34.429 --> 03:30:34.439 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
03:30:36.670 --> 03:30:36.680 align:start position:0%
my name is David rodrig and I'm the
 
03:30:38.189 --> 03:30:38.199 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner for the
 
03:30:39.349 --> 03:30:39.359 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
03:30:42.030 --> 03:30:42.040 align:start position:0%
Transportation the department does have
 
03:30:47.110 --> 03:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
concerns with this bill as proposed um I
 
03:30:49.630 --> 03:30:49.640 align:start position:0%
will will start by saying it was very
 
03:30:53.349 --> 03:30:53.359 align:start position:0%
helpful to hear the spirit in which uh
 
03:30:56.389 --> 03:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
the bill was proposed the area that
 
03:30:58.750 --> 03:30:58.760 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher is speaking
 
03:31:02.870 --> 03:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
about is really within conquer's Urban
 
03:31:05.429 --> 03:31:05.439 align:start position:0%
Compact and the Department of
 
03:31:08.429 --> 03:31:08.439 align:start position:0%
Transportation I don't believe has any
 
03:31:10.229 --> 03:31:10.239 align:start position:0%
re well I'm sure we don't have any
 
03:31:12.990 --> 03:31:13.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility for the the maintenance
 
03:31:16.030 --> 03:31:16.040 align:start position:0%
of Pleasant Street in that area um but
 
03:31:19.670 --> 03:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
it's probably also a class five City
 
03:31:21.870 --> 03:31:21.880 align:start position:0%
Road I need to make sure it's not a
 
03:31:25.510 --> 03:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
class 4 Urban compact Road um but I
 
03:31:28.469 --> 03:31:28.479 align:start position:0%
think why this area is different than a
 
03:31:30.750 --> 03:31:30.760 align:start position:0%
sidewalk adjacent to our regular
 
03:31:33.630 --> 03:31:33.640 align:start position:0%
highways is I believe the state's
 
03:31:36.349 --> 03:31:36.359 align:start position:0%
interest in that property is the state
 
03:31:38.750 --> 03:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
hospital grounds not the Department of
 
03:31:41.429 --> 03:31:41.439 align:start position:0%
Transportation so I did leave Mr
 
03:31:43.790 --> 03:31:43.800 align:start position:0%
Gallagher my card I'd be happy to work
 
03:31:46.349 --> 03:31:46.359 align:start position:0%
with him to find the owner of that
 
03:31:48.950 --> 03:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
property so that he can direct the city
 
03:31:52.110 --> 03:31:52.120 align:start position:0%
to work with them on an easement if
 
03:31:56.150 --> 03:31:56.160 align:start position:0%
that's what's appropriate with regard to
 
03:32:00.510 --> 03:32:00.520 align:start position:0%
a law that um requires the department to
 
03:32:03.110 --> 03:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
issue or consider easements from
 
03:32:06.750 --> 03:32:06.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities for sidewalks um adjacent
 
03:32:10.070 --> 03:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
to our state maintained roads there are
 
03:32:13.030 --> 03:32:13.040 align:start position:0%
a number of issues that would be created
 
03:32:16.830 --> 03:32:16.840 align:start position:0%
by that the the first issue is the
 
03:32:19.910 --> 03:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
department already has either in
 
03:32:24.189 --> 03:32:24.199 align:start position:0%
easement or owns the land in in fee and
 
03:32:27.710 --> 03:32:27.720 align:start position:0%
we are very interested in constructing
 
03:32:30.590 --> 03:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
sidewalks where municipalities are
 
03:32:33.150 --> 03:32:33.160 align:start position:0%
interested in maintaining those
 
03:32:36.670 --> 03:32:36.680 align:start position:0%
sidewalks in the in the future in Ean
 
03:32:40.590 --> 03:32:40.600 align:start position:0%
isn't necessary I know of no State Road
 
03:32:44.030 --> 03:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
on um where a municipality wanted to
 
03:32:47.150 --> 03:32:47.160 align:start position:0%
install a sidewalk and maintain it that
 
03:32:51.030 --> 03:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
we were not able to accommodate that if
 
03:32:53.830 --> 03:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
we were in a position of having to give
 
03:32:57.070 --> 03:32:57.080 align:start position:0%
the municipality an easement that would
 
03:33:00.870 --> 03:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
then put a cloud on our land rights and
 
03:33:03.870 --> 03:33:03.880 align:start position:0%
when we wanted to widen the road or
 
03:33:05.590 --> 03:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
other things we would have the
 
03:33:09.189 --> 03:33:09.199 align:start position:0%
municipality to to deal with um and that
 
03:33:12.510 --> 03:33:12.520 align:start position:0%
could create some EXP events and some
 
03:33:14.990 --> 03:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
issues with that so those are just a few
 
03:33:17.790 --> 03:33:17.800 align:start position:0%
of my concerns but I hope that gives a
 
03:33:22.269 --> 03:33:22.279 align:start position:0%
flavor and i' be happy to take any
 
03:33:24.910 --> 03:33:24.920 align:start position:0%
questions thank you sir um represent
 
03:33:26.630 --> 03:33:26.640 align:start position:0%

you uh commissioner for appearing uh

we've had bills in the past that have a
 
03:33:33.349 --> 03:33:33.359 align:start position:0%
shell issue after a time limit provision
 
03:33:35.830 --> 03:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
as this one does and uh can you comment
 
03:33:37.670 --> 03:33:37.680 align:start position:0%
on whether you think that's
 
03:33:39.990 --> 03:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
problematic time limits can be
 
03:33:42.870 --> 03:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
problematic for us the depending on the
 
03:33:47.710 --> 03:33:47.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:51.229 --> 03:33:51.239 align:start position:0%
situation further questions thank you

please represent
 
03:33:54.750 --> 03:33:54.760 align:start position:0%
Eon I think I know the answer but just
 
03:33:56.830 --> 03:33:56.840 align:start position:0%
curious uh the area that he's talking
 
03:33:59.389 --> 03:33:59.399 align:start position:0%
about is on the Pleasant Street Fruit
 
03:34:01.389 --> 03:34:01.399 align:start position:0%
Street School Street that old
 
03:34:07.590 --> 03:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:12.429 --> 03:34:12.439 align:start position:0%
dual legal fee owner ship it's New
 
03:34:14.030 --> 03:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Route
 
03:34:17.030 --> 03:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
9 that comes through on the Pleasant
 
03:34:19.389 --> 03:34:19.399 align:start position:0%
Street but it's in the city compact is
 
03:34:21.550 --> 03:34:21.560 align:start position:0%
Pleasant Street is there any dual
 
03:34:23.910 --> 03:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
ownership dual use dual
 
03:34:26.950 --> 03:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility if it is an urban compact
 
03:34:29.830 --> 03:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
Road the the city's responsible to
 
03:34:32.590 --> 03:34:32.600 align:start position:0%
operate maintain and reconstruct that
 
03:34:36.110 --> 03:34:36.120 align:start position:0%
road um we do have some oversight in
 
03:34:38.910 --> 03:34:38.920 align:start position:0%
what the city does on the urban compact
 
03:34:40.990 --> 03:34:41.000 align:start position:0%
roads to make sure they don't do
 
03:34:43.830 --> 03:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
anything that degrades past Federal
 
03:34:46.309 --> 03:34:46.319 align:start position:0%
investments in those roads so it really
 
03:34:48.990 --> 03:34:49.000 align:start position:0%
depends on some research for this
 
03:34:49.000 --> 03:34:50.229 align:start position:0%
depends on some research for this

04:02:43.030 --> 04:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
of class six roads not maintained by the
 
04:02:44.870 --> 04:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
municipality I'll note that there are
 
04:02:49.070 --> 04:02:49.080 align:start position:0%
drafting errors in House Bill 1234 as
 
04:02:53.990 --> 04:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
introduced as compared to LSR 24
 
04:02:55.990 --> 04:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
21780 which was
 
04:02:59.110 --> 04:02:59.120 align:start position:0%
reviewed and signed off by the sponsor
 
04:03:01.550 --> 04:03:01.560 align:start position:0%
representative Earth F who is unable to
 
04:03:04.630 --> 04:03:04.640 align:start position:0%
repair today I understand an amendment
 
04:03:07.070 --> 04:03:07.080 align:start position:0%
to correct the bill to correspond the
 
04:03:10.550 --> 04:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
LSR which doesn't contain the errors has
 
04:03:12.710 --> 04:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
been filed or drafted by representative
 
04:03:16.189 --> 04:03:16.199 align:start position:0%
Jack this committee uh bill was put in
 
04:03:19.070 --> 04:03:19.080 align:start position:0%
at the request of a constituent of
 
04:03:21.830 --> 04:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
Representative Earth and that was Mr
 
04:03:25.830 --> 04:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
Javi Richardson of we Mr Richardson is
 
04:03:28.830 --> 04:03:28.840 align:start position:0%

bill I am happy to answer any questions
 
04:03:33.550 --> 04:03:33.560 align:start position:0%

04:03:37.110 --> 04:03:37.120 align:start position:0%
in-depth responses and I would uh prefer
 
04:03:40.550 --> 04:03:40.560 align:start position:0%

we're going to give the committee of
 
04:03:46.630 --> 04:03:46.640 align:start position:0%
course a chance anyone have any
 
04:03:48.910 --> 04:03:48.920 align:start position:0%
questions for the good representative
 
04:03:50.269 --> 04:03:50.279 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for the
 
04:03:52.389 --> 04:03:52.399 align:start position:0%
introduction sir thank you very much uh
 
04:03:53.790 --> 04:03:53.800 align:start position:0%
for the
 
04:03:57.229 --> 04:03:57.239 align:start position:0%
committee um and I'm looking for some
 
04:04:00.429 --> 04:04:00.439 align:start position:0%
guidance here perhaps uh um
 
04:04:02.950 --> 04:04:02.960 align:start position:0%
representative Jack
 
04:04:05.830 --> 04:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
where uh the amendment was prepared to
 
04:04:07.349 --> 04:04:07.359 align:start position:0%
move this could you speak to your
 
04:04:08.670 --> 04:04:08.680 align:start position:0%
amendment that you brought forward uh
 
04:04:10.670 --> 04:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh I have
 
04:04:13.110 --> 04:04:13.120 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh
 
04:04:16.510 --> 04:04:16.520 align:start position:0%
20208 H and the effect of the amendment
 
04:04:20.790 --> 04:04:20.800 align:start position:0%
is to uh restore the text private that
 
04:04:23.429 --> 04:04:23.439 align:start position:0%
was inadvertently deleted from the as
 
04:04:27.070 --> 04:04:27.080 align:start position:0%
introduced so throughout the text of
 
04:04:30.309 --> 04:04:30.319 align:start position:0%
this code section uh it says private or
 
04:04:34.030 --> 04:04:34.040 align:start position:0%
class six uh so it it normalizes the
 
04:04:35.630 --> 04:04:35.640 align:start position:0%
treatment of private roads that we
 
04:04:38.790 --> 04:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
already had in statute and adds on the
 
04:04:41.750 --> 04:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
same treatment for class six roads and
 
04:04:45.630 --> 04:04:45.640 align:start position:0%
then uh on line 10 uh there's a slight
 
04:04:49.750 --> 04:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
change uh 229 colon 5 is where all of
 
04:04:52.630 --> 04:04:52.640 align:start position:0%
the classes are defined and it it
 
04:04:55.349 --> 04:04:55.359 align:start position:0%
changes it so that 2 that uh it does not
 
04:04:58.309 --> 04:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
apply to class 1 through five but does
 
04:05:01.269 --> 04:05:01.279 align:start position:0%
apply to class six so if there's if
 
04:05:02.910 --> 04:05:02.920 align:start position:0%
that's clear i' I'd be happy to take any
 
04:05:05.309 --> 04:05:05.319 align:start position:0%
questions if if that's unclear excuse me
 
04:05:07.469 --> 04:05:07.479 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I move we accept the
 
04:05:10.429 --> 04:05:10.439 align:start position:0%

04:05:10.439 --> 04:05:12.990 align:start position:0%

little nervous I apologize uh name it
 
04:06:09.910 --> 04:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
Harvey Richardson my residence is in
 
04:06:12.269 --> 04:06:12.279 align:start position:0%
Hollis New Hampshire uh but I'm here
 
04:06:15.670 --> 04:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
today in my capacity as the treasurer of
 
04:06:18.269 --> 04:06:18.279 align:start position:0%
the East Shore Drive Road
 
04:06:21.030 --> 04:06:21.040 align:start position:0%
Association uh in wear that's along
 
04:06:21.040 --> 04:06:22.349 align:start position:0%
Association uh in wear that's along
Horus

04:06:22.349 --> 04:06:22.359 align:start position:0%
Horus
 
04:06:26.550 --> 04:06:26.560 align:start position:0%
Lake uh we're probably unique
 
04:06:31.830 --> 04:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
in uh class six roads in that we have 61
 
04:06:34.110 --> 04:06:34.120 align:start position:0%
residences on that road that's just
 
04:06:35.429 --> 04:06:35.439 align:start position:0%
under a mile
 
04:06:40.910 --> 04:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
long uh and we maintain that road uh
 
04:06:40.920 --> 04:06:42.349 align:start position:0%
long uh and we maintain that road uh
year

04:06:42.349 --> 04:06:42.359 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:06:45.790 --> 04:06:45.800 align:start position:0%
round uh but then all across the state
 
04:06:49.510 --> 04:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
there are uh many class six roads uh
 
04:06:53.429 --> 04:06:53.439 align:start position:0%
some having like ours being Lake roads
 
04:06:55.309 --> 04:06:55.319 align:start position:0%
uh with a good number of residences and
 
04:06:57.590 --> 04:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
of course others are nothing more than a
 
04:07:00.070 --> 04:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
snowmobile trail this time of
 
04:07:00.080 --> 04:07:01.710 align:start position:0%
snowmobile trail this time of
year

04:07:01.710 --> 04:07:01.720 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:07:06.030 --> 04:07:06.040 align:start position:0%
uh so uh we have a road Association
 
04:07:08.790 --> 04:07:08.800 align:start position:0%
voluntary uh nonprofit
 
04:07:12.429 --> 04:07:12.439 align:start position:0%
and we collect dues and uh maintain the
 
04:07:15.229 --> 04:07:15.239 align:start position:0%
road grading it in the summer and uh
 
04:07:18.070 --> 04:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
plowing it and sanding it in the
 
04:07:21.790 --> 04:07:21.800 align:start position:0%
winter uh collecting dues to do that my
 
04:07:25.790 --> 04:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
budget is over $1,000 a year uh is
 
04:07:25.800 --> 04:07:27.189 align:start position:0%
budget is over $1,000 a year uh is
totally

04:07:27.189 --> 04:07:27.199 align:start position:0%
totally
 
04:07:30.389 --> 04:07:30.399 align:start position:0%
voluntary which for most of the folks
 
04:07:32.910 --> 04:07:32.920 align:start position:0%
their neighborly and and they pay their
 
04:07:36.109 --> 04:07:36.119 align:start position:0%
dues uh I have some residents who flat
 
04:07:38.349 --> 04:07:38.359 align:start position:0%
out refuse
 
04:07:40.510 --> 04:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
and there is absolutely nothing we can
 
04:07:44.950 --> 04:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
do about that so uh it's it's unfair it
 
04:07:48.590 --> 04:07:48.600 align:start position:0%
raises the rate for everyone who does
 
04:07:53.870 --> 04:07:53.880 align:start position:0%
volunteer uh and the intent in asking Mr
 
04:07:57.309 --> 04:07:57.319 align:start position:0%
representative Earth to uh file this
 
04:08:01.950 --> 04:08:01.960 align:start position:0%
bill was to give us an ability to
 
04:08:04.990 --> 04:08:05.000 align:start position:0%
uh uh file a civil action against people
 
04:08:05.000 --> 04:08:05.670 align:start position:0%
uh uh file a civil action against people
who

04:08:05.670 --> 04:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
who
 
04:08:08.630 --> 04:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
aren't uh paying but civil action I'm
 
04:08:10.990 --> 04:08:11.000 align:start position:0%
kind of implying putting a mechanic lean
 
04:08:12.389 --> 04:08:12.399 align:start position:0%
on the
 
04:08:17.269 --> 04:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
property uh it was never our intent
 
04:08:21.030 --> 04:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
to hijack the former law about uh
 
04:08:24.070 --> 04:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
private roads I used that as a model
 
04:08:27.870 --> 04:08:27.880 align:start position:0%
when uh representative Earth F asked me
 
04:08:30.309 --> 04:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
to uh write something
 
04:08:34.870 --> 04:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
up and gave that uh to him last fall and
 
04:08:37.429 --> 04:08:37.439 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the translation we wound up
 
04:08:41.990 --> 04:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
with with this confusion so uh I felt it
 
04:08:44.510 --> 04:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
was probably cleaner to have a separate
 
04:08:47.349 --> 04:08:47.359 align:start position:0%
bill just for class six roads being
 
04:08:50.189 --> 04:08:50.199 align:start position:0%
there's some definite Nuance difference
 
04:08:52.550 --> 04:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
between private roads and class six
 
04:08:56.030 --> 04:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
roads but uh if it can be accomplished
 
04:08:58.910 --> 04:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
with uh the two being on the same bill
 
04:09:01.070 --> 04:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
we have no objection to
 
04:09:01.080 --> 04:09:03.990 align:start position:0%
we have no objection to
that

04:09:03.990 --> 04:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:09:07.670 --> 04:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
uh I think that's uh the main points
 
04:09:11.510 --> 04:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
that uh that I have uh obviously I'll
 
04:09:14.309 --> 04:09:14.319 align:start position:0%
take questions if folks have
 
04:09:16.910 --> 04:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
them thank you Mr richon questions from
 
04:09:19.030 --> 04:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
the committee represent Jack uh thank
 
04:09:20.750 --> 04:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for appearing
 
04:09:22.870 --> 04:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
uh I have I have two questions uh the
 
04:09:25.750 --> 04:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
original bill was brought because people
 
04:09:27.750 --> 04:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
were having difficulty getting certain
 
04:09:30.309 --> 04:09:30.319 align:start position:0%
types of mortgages on a private road
 
04:09:32.349 --> 04:09:32.359 align:start position:0%
that didn't have a maintenance agreement
 
04:09:34.030 --> 04:09:34.040 align:start position:0%
uh are you experiencing that at all on
 
04:09:35.469 --> 04:09:35.479 align:start position:0%
the class six
 
04:09:39.790 --> 04:09:39.800 align:start position:0%
roads uh I've asked a real a excuse me a
 
04:09:42.910 --> 04:09:42.920 align:start position:0%
mortgage broker I know uh and to date
 
04:09:45.950 --> 04:09:45.960 align:start position:0%
they have not found anything uh
 
04:09:49.630 --> 04:09:49.640 align:start position:0%
personally I would expect uh Insurance
 
04:09:53.670 --> 04:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
to be more of an issue but uh again I
 
04:09:55.790 --> 04:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
haven't uh researched that in
 
04:09:58.710 --> 04:09:58.720 align:start position:0%
depth thank you followup question R and
 
04:10:01.109 --> 04:10:01.119 align:start position:0%
and thank you again uh normally you
 
04:10:03.550 --> 04:10:03.560 align:start position:0%
cannot get a building permit on a class
 
04:10:06.229 --> 04:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
on on a the fire department will not
 
04:10:09.269 --> 04:10:09.279 align:start position:0%
Grant uh so presumably this started out
 
04:10:11.269 --> 04:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
as a class five Road and got built on
 
04:10:13.590 --> 04:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
and then became a class six road is that
 
04:10:16.070 --> 04:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
the normal progression how this could
 
04:10:19.990 --> 04:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
happen I'm really not sure uh
 
04:10:22.910 --> 04:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
my uh the lake we're on Horus lake is a
 
04:10:25.790 --> 04:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
man-made lake uh I believe it was the
 
04:10:28.550 --> 04:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
30s or 40s that it was uh
 
04:10:31.030 --> 04:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
created uh I would expect that the road
 
04:10:34.389 --> 04:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
was put in uh and handed over to the
 
04:10:38.030 --> 04:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
town uh at that point
 
04:10:42.070 --> 04:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
uh and you know as many uh Lakes back
 
04:10:45.790 --> 04:10:45.800 align:start position:0%
then it were what we all called camps uh
 
04:10:47.950 --> 04:10:47.960 align:start position:0%
along there and nobody worried too much
 
04:10:52.590 --> 04:10:52.600 align:start position:0%
about it but uh it is the town-owned uh
 
04:10:55.670 --> 04:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
it's a separate strip none of our uh
 
04:10:57.790 --> 04:10:57.800 align:start position:0%
residential Deeds make any reference to
 
04:11:03.229 --> 04:11:03.239 align:start position:0%
it and again uh not like a private road
 
04:11:07.149 --> 04:11:07.159 align:start position:0%
there is nothing in our Deeds uh talking
 
04:11:09.229 --> 04:11:09.239 align:start position:0%
about about Road dues or anything of
 
04:11:09.239 --> 04:11:10.149 align:start position:0%
about about Road dues or anything of
that

04:11:10.149 --> 04:11:10.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:11:12.790 --> 04:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
nature I don't did I answer your
 
04:11:17.349 --> 04:11:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:19.830 --> 04:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
richson yes
 
04:11:23.870 --> 04:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
represent so Devil's Advocate um I'm in
 
04:11:26.109 --> 04:11:26.119 align:start position:0%
the town of Stoddard and we have what
 
04:11:27.830 --> 04:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
used to be a Town Road became a class
 
04:11:30.670 --> 04:11:30.680 align:start position:0%
six road goes between a town road and a
 
04:11:30.680 --> 04:11:31.510 align:start position:0%
six road goes between a town road and a
state

04:11:31.510 --> 04:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:11:33.590 --> 04:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
highway there are
 
04:11:33.600 --> 04:11:35.469 align:start position:0%
highway there are
three

04:11:35.469 --> 04:11:35.479 align:start position:0%
three
 
04:11:38.710 --> 04:11:38.720 align:start position:0%
residences on that class last six
 
04:11:42.950 --> 04:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
section uh none of which are used year
 
04:11:45.349 --> 04:11:45.359 align:start position:0%
round but according to the verbiage of
 
04:11:47.790 --> 04:11:47.800 align:start position:0%
this bill if one
 
04:11:51.389 --> 04:11:51.399 align:start position:0%
person decides they want year- round
 
04:11:54.389 --> 04:11:54.399 align:start position:0%
access and easy access non four-wheel
 
04:11:54.399 --> 04:11:55.429 align:start position:0%
access and easy access non four-wheel
drive

04:11:55.429 --> 04:11:55.439 align:start position:0%
drive
 
04:11:59.469 --> 04:11:59.479 align:start position:0%
access they would be able to force the
 
04:12:02.870 --> 04:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
others into paying to make that road
 
04:12:07.030 --> 04:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
navigable year round and last I checked
 
04:12:09.309 --> 04:12:09.319 align:start position:0%
um numbers for that one road I'm
 
04:12:11.750 --> 04:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
thinking of they were talking in excess
 
04:12:14.910 --> 04:12:14.920 align:start position:0%
of $100,000 which would essentially
 
04:12:17.469 --> 04:12:17.479 align:start position:0%
place a couple of those properties at
 
04:12:19.109 --> 04:12:19.119 align:start position:0%
road maintenance more than the value of
 
04:12:19.119 --> 04:12:20.590 align:start position:0%
road maintenance more than the value of
their

04:12:20.590 --> 04:12:20.600 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:12:20.600 --> 04:12:22.469 align:start position:0%
their
dwelling

04:12:22.469 --> 04:12:22.479 align:start position:0%
dwelling
 
04:12:28.070 --> 04:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:31.109 --> 04:12:31.119 align:start position:0%
scenario trying to is this a bill trying
 
04:12:35.389 --> 04:12:35.399 align:start position:0%
to fix one individual scenario that can
 
04:12:40.189 --> 04:12:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:42.070 --> 04:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
that certainly wasn't our
 
04:12:46.870 --> 04:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
intent uh obviously every situation is
 
04:12:46.880 --> 04:12:49.189 align:start position:0%
intent uh obviously every situation is
unique

04:12:49.189 --> 04:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
unique
 
04:12:53.790 --> 04:12:53.800 align:start position:0%
uh we get our one mile long road uh
 
04:13:00.070 --> 04:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
plowed for about $7,000 a year uh if
 
04:13:02.070 --> 04:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
suddenly it were to be paved I can see
 
04:13:05.030 --> 04:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
where that would be $100,000 or well
 
04:13:10.590 --> 04:13:10.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:13.429 --> 04:13:13.439 align:start position:0%
but I suppose it's a
 
04:13:16.790 --> 04:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
possibility thank thank you any other
 
04:13:16.800 --> 04:13:18.389 align:start position:0%
possibility thank thank you any other
further

04:13:18.389 --> 04:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
further
 
04:13:21.670 --> 04:13:21.680 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you sir oh
 
04:13:23.510 --> 04:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry go right
 
04:13:26.590 --> 04:13:26.600 align:start position:0%

04:13:48.269 --> 04:13:48.279 align:start position:0%
that that's the way it is right now but
 
04:13:50.389 --> 04:13:50.399 align:start position:0%
some of the members of this group are
 
04:13:53.109 --> 04:13:53.119 align:start position:0%
not paying their dues is that the
 
04:13:55.790 --> 04:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
situation yes I should be clear the the
 
04:14:00.550 --> 04:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
association is voluntary
 
04:14:00.560 --> 04:14:02.070 align:start position:0%
association is voluntary
nonprofit

04:14:02.070 --> 04:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
nonprofit
 
04:14:04.469 --> 04:14:04.479 align:start position:0%
uh when I bought the property I didn't
 
04:14:06.910 --> 04:14:06.920 align:start position:0%
need to sign on to the association I
 
04:14:06.920 --> 04:14:07.870 align:start position:0%
need to sign on to the association I
just

04:14:07.870 --> 04:14:07.880 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:14:11.950 --> 04:14:11.960 align:start position:0%
voluntarily do so so uh I'm giving you a
 
04:14:14.349 --> 04:14:14.359 align:start position:0%
wishy-washy answer if everyone everybody
 
04:14:17.229 --> 04:14:17.239 align:start position:0%
on the road is a
 
04:14:17.239 --> 04:14:21.830 align:start position:0%
on the road is a
member

04:14:21.830 --> 04:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:25.269 --> 04:14:25.279 align:start position:0%
uh I'm I'm sorry so not every not every
 
04:14:27.950 --> 04:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
person is a member that lives on this
 
04:14:33.630 --> 04:14:33.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:36.469 --> 04:14:36.479 align:start position:0%
association again I'm not I really don't
 
04:14:38.229 --> 04:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
know how to answer answer that the the
 
04:14:38.239 --> 04:14:39.790 align:start position:0%
know how to answer answer that the the
association

04:14:39.790 --> 04:14:39.800 align:start position:0%
association
 
04:14:46.510 --> 04:14:46.520 align:start position:0%
exists uh we meet annually we have uh
 
04:14:48.990 --> 04:14:49.000 align:start position:0%
members but whether or not all right I
 
04:14:54.710 --> 04:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:58.910 --> 04:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
St we are a uh nonprofit we're
 
04:15:01.910 --> 04:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
registered with the state thank you was
 
04:15:03.790 --> 04:15:03.800 align:start position:0%
there a further question repres Bel so I
 
04:15:06.349 --> 04:15:06.359 align:start position:0%
guess the final question is so basically
 
04:15:09.269 --> 04:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
if somebody buys into this this area
 
04:15:12.710 --> 04:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
they're forced to join this Association
 
04:15:14.710 --> 04:15:14.720 align:start position:0%
there's because if
 
04:15:16.830 --> 04:15:16.840 align:start position:0%
they or they're forced to actually have
 
04:15:19.670 --> 04:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
to pay for this maintenance of the Road
 
04:15:21.870 --> 04:15:21.880 align:start position:0%
H they are not that that's our problem
 
04:15:26.109 --> 04:15:26.119 align:start position:0%
is we have no I'm sorry just to clarify
 
04:15:29.030 --> 04:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
if this bill passes wouldn't that be the
 
04:15:32.469 --> 04:15:32.479 align:start position:0%
case effectively yes okay thank you okay
 
04:15:33.910 --> 04:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
thank you represent Boyd do you have a
 
04:15:36.429 --> 04:15:36.439 align:start position:0%
question yeah and I I thank my my good
 
04:15:37.910 --> 04:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
colleague from started for raising the
 
04:15:40.189 --> 04:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
issue I work as a as a real estate title
 
04:15:41.990 --> 04:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
examiner and one of the things that I've
 
04:15:45.389 --> 04:15:45.399 align:start position:0%
seen specifically in Carrol County in
 
04:15:48.349 --> 04:15:48.359 align:start position:0%
Grafton county is that people that are
 
04:15:51.030 --> 04:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
choosing to build on a class six roadway
 
04:15:52.510 --> 04:15:52.520 align:start position:0%
will enter into a road maintenance
 
04:15:54.750 --> 04:15:54.760 align:start position:0%
agreement or they get the building
 
04:15:56.550 --> 04:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
permit and they accept responsibility
 
04:15:58.109 --> 04:15:58.119 align:start position:0%
with the fact that the road is not going
 
04:15:59.910 --> 04:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
to be maintained for use and that they
 
04:16:01.550 --> 04:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
and that's that's the kind kind of the
 
04:16:02.950 --> 04:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
quit Pro qu we'll give you the building
 
04:16:05.189 --> 04:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
permit we don't take care of the road so
 
04:16:06.630 --> 04:16:06.640 align:start position:0%
there is a remedy out there that certain
 
04:16:09.109 --> 04:16:09.119 align:start position:0%
min muncipalities can use with people
 
04:16:11.429 --> 04:16:11.439 align:start position:0%
choosing to build on a class six road
 
04:16:13.070 --> 04:16:13.080 align:start position:0%
that municipalities are not going to be
 
04:16:14.790 --> 04:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
responsible for maintaining the road so
 
04:16:16.830 --> 04:16:16.840 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to amplify that to to the
 
04:16:19.469 --> 04:16:19.479 align:start position:0%
Comm that's good uh further
 
04:16:23.830 --> 04:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:26.070 --> 04:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
sir I'd like to
 
04:16:26.080 --> 04:16:27.750 align:start position:0%
sir I'd like to
recognize

04:16:27.750 --> 04:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
recognize
 
04:16:32.550 --> 04:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
U Brian um I can never pronounce
 
04:16:35.870 --> 04:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
04:16:35.880 --> 04:16:40.269 align:start position:0%
you thank you
please

04:16:40.269 --> 04:16:40.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:42.750 --> 04:16:42.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
04:16:42.760 --> 04:16:43.790 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
Public

04:16:43.790 --> 04:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
Public
 
04:16:48.189 --> 04:16:48.199 align:start position:0%
Works um I actually have checked off
 
04:16:52.229 --> 04:16:52.239 align:start position:0%
that I was I am opposed to um what is
 
04:16:55.269 --> 04:16:55.279 align:start position:0%
provided to you and hb1
 
04:16:58.590 --> 04:16:58.600 align:start position:0%
1234 uh and the reason is very very
 
04:17:02.269 --> 04:17:02.279 align:start position:0%
simply um the crossout of private roads
 
04:17:05.070 --> 04:17:05.080 align:start position:0%
and if you would indulge me I would just
 
04:17:06.109 --> 04:17:06.119 align:start position:0%
like to give you a little bit of a
 
04:17:08.910 --> 04:17:08.920 align:start position:0%
history as to why this wording had come
 
04:17:13.269 --> 04:17:13.279 align:start position:0%
to be please um so from 2010 to 2020 I
 
04:17:14.389 --> 04:17:14.399 align:start position:0%
was a State
 
04:17:17.590 --> 04:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
Rep um and this language here basically
 
04:17:20.790 --> 04:17:20.800 align:start position:0%
took me three years to get
 
04:17:24.950 --> 04:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
through uh and finally passed in 2019
 
04:17:27.269 --> 04:17:27.279 align:start position:0%
and one of the reasons why it took so
 
04:17:29.229 --> 04:17:29.239 align:start position:0%
long it was very confusing because I I'm
 
04:17:33.349 --> 04:17:33.359 align:start position:0%
talking about private roads when the
 
04:17:36.309 --> 04:17:36.319 align:start position:0%
issue that I was trying to solve was
 
04:17:38.429 --> 04:17:38.439 align:start position:0%
Finance ING with Fanny May and Freddy
 
04:17:41.030 --> 04:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
Mack on private roads that don't have a
 
04:17:43.910 --> 04:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
maintenance agreement in place so we all
 
04:17:46.109 --> 04:17:46.119 align:start position:0%
know that we have a housing shortage and
 
04:17:47.429 --> 04:17:47.439 align:start position:0%
unemployment is we have we have
 
04:17:50.070 --> 04:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
employment issues and
 
04:17:54.149 --> 04:17:54.159 align:start position:0%
um by um this new bill taking out the
 
04:17:57.269 --> 04:17:57.279 align:start position:0%
word private roads doesn't codify the
 
04:17:59.830 --> 04:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
the the maintenance agreement that's
 
04:18:03.189 --> 04:18:03.199 align:start position:0%
caught in statute right now um I can
 
04:18:06.189 --> 04:18:06.199 align:start position:0%
tell you uh I'm also a real estate agent
 
04:18:06.199 --> 04:18:07.229 align:start position:0%
tell you uh I'm also a real estate agent
so

04:18:07.229 --> 04:18:07.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:18:09.109 --> 04:18:09.119 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that once this pass
 
04:18:11.790 --> 04:18:11.800 align:start position:0%
finally passed the real estate agents
 
04:18:15.109 --> 04:18:15.119 align:start position:0%
were uh extremely appreciative that this
 
04:18:18.149 --> 04:18:18.159 align:start position:0%
passed and I'll give you a reason why in
 
04:18:21.590 --> 04:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
the old days you would go onto a private
 
04:18:25.189 --> 04:18:25.199 align:start position:0%
road look at a house the buyers would
 
04:18:27.189 --> 04:18:27.199 align:start position:0%
want to buy purchase but there was no
 
04:18:29.309 --> 04:18:29.319 align:start position:0%
maintenance agreement with anybody on
 
04:18:31.710 --> 04:18:31.720 align:start position:0%
that road so what would happen is these
 
04:18:33.269 --> 04:18:33.279 align:start position:0%
real estate agents would actually
 
04:18:34.469 --> 04:18:34.479 align:start position:0%
believe it or not go knock on
 
04:18:35.870 --> 04:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
everybody's door and say would you sign
 
04:18:37.309 --> 04:18:37.319 align:start position:0%
this maintenance agreement
 
04:18:39.910 --> 04:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
so these people can buy this house and
 
04:18:44.030 --> 04:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
if one resident said no that deal was
 
04:18:47.349 --> 04:18:47.359 align:start position:0%
gone so it it seemed to be more and more
 
04:18:49.429 --> 04:18:49.439 align:start position:0%
common over time that you know someone
 
04:18:51.030 --> 04:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
didn't want to deal with the maintenance
 
04:18:53.710 --> 04:18:53.720 align:start position:0%
agreement and so
 
04:18:56.510 --> 04:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
anyway the fix for us as real estate
 
04:18:59.910 --> 04:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
agents was to codify this into law and
 
04:19:02.309 --> 04:19:02.319 align:start position:0%
um that's what we did with the with the
 
04:19:05.590 --> 04:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
wording so when I saw this uh online
 
04:19:08.429 --> 04:19:08.439 align:start position:0%
where where um representative Earth um
 
04:19:11.349 --> 04:19:11.359 align:start position:0%
took out private road I was a little bit
 
04:19:13.590 --> 04:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
taken aack because a took me three years
 
04:19:17.630 --> 04:19:17.640 align:start position:0%
to to get it past um but B I didn't want
 
04:19:20.870 --> 04:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
to go back to the old days where um
 
04:19:23.349 --> 04:19:23.359 align:start position:0%
people were losing Housing Opportunity
 
04:19:25.070 --> 04:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
and that's the name of the I that's the
 
04:19:26.710 --> 04:19:26.720 align:start position:0%
the end of the game right there it's
 
04:19:28.389 --> 04:19:28.399 align:start position:0%
affordability we have an affordability
 
04:19:31.990 --> 04:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
issue here now um it's not getting any
 
04:19:35.950 --> 04:19:35.960 align:start position:0%
better um housing is is critical um less
 
04:19:38.229 --> 04:19:38.239 align:start position:0%
firsttime homey buyers can buy and um
 
04:19:40.229 --> 04:19:40.239 align:start position:0%
and it's affecting our economy it's
 
04:19:42.149 --> 04:19:42.159 align:start position:0%
affecting a lot of um people that are
 
04:19:44.349 --> 04:19:44.359 align:start position:0%
looking for help so that's the only
 
04:19:45.990 --> 04:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
reason why I'm opposed to it I'm not
 
04:19:47.910 --> 04:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
opposed to anything any other part of it
 
04:19:49.309 --> 04:19:49.319 align:start position:0%
if you want to deal with the class six
 
04:19:50.790 --> 04:19:50.800 align:start position:0%
that's fine I'm not opposed to that I'm
 
04:19:54.590 --> 04:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
just I want to make sure that Fanny May
 
04:19:58.149 --> 04:19:58.159 align:start position:0%
and Freddy Mack still have this de facto
 
04:20:01.149 --> 04:20:01.159 align:start position:0%
um maintenance agreement codified in
 
04:20:03.590 --> 04:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
State Statute so that's where I'm coming
 
04:20:06.830 --> 04:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
from so um with that I we have Happ to
 
04:20:08.429 --> 04:20:08.439 align:start position:0%
answer any questions good representative
 
04:20:10.349 --> 04:20:10.359 align:start position:0%
Jack and then thank you Mr chairman and
 
04:20:12.030 --> 04:20:12.040 align:start position:0%
I thank the former representative we
 
04:20:14.469 --> 04:20:14.479 align:start position:0%
worked a long time on that bill uh can
 
04:20:17.109 --> 04:20:17.119 align:start position:0%
we clarify your position on the as
 
04:20:19.349 --> 04:20:19.359 align:start position:0%
amended yes oh I'm sorry I should have
 
04:20:21.750 --> 04:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
brought that up um I I did was able
 
04:20:23.830 --> 04:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
representative Jack U was able to let me
 
04:20:26.469 --> 04:20:26.479 align:start position:0%
see the amendment that he is going to
 
04:20:28.630 --> 04:20:28.640 align:start position:0%
introduce uh and I'm happy with that
 
04:20:30.229 --> 04:20:30.239 align:start position:0%
that that works because it doesn't take
 
04:20:31.750 --> 04:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
out the word private it doesn't affect
 
04:20:34.269 --> 04:20:34.279 align:start position:0%
Fanny May or Freddy Mack financing so
 
04:20:35.830 --> 04:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
like I said I have no issues with
 
04:20:39.070 --> 04:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
anything else in the in that proposed
 
04:20:41.710 --> 04:20:41.720 align:start position:0%
bill um I just want to make sure that
 
04:20:44.109 --> 04:20:44.119 align:start position:0%
you know the real estate agents
 
04:20:47.469 --> 04:20:47.479 align:start position:0%
are able to still sell on private roads
 
04:20:49.229 --> 04:20:49.239 align:start position:0%
because it's important thank you
 
04:20:53.149 --> 04:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:56.910 --> 04:20:56.920 align:start position:0%
please okay thank you any other further
 
04:20:59.710 --> 04:20:59.720 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank

04:21:08.429 --> 04:21:08.439 align:start position:0%

sock New Hampshire Timberland Owners
 
04:21:25.790 --> 04:21:25.800 align:start position:0%
Association um asking for a few minutes
 
04:21:28.550 --> 04:21:28.560 align:start position:0%

bill well good afternoon I'm Jason stock
 
04:21:32.950 --> 04:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire timber land
 
04:21:35.910 --> 04:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
Owners Association and I appreciate the
 
04:21:37.309 --> 04:21:37.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity to come and
 
04:21:39.950 --> 04:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
testify to you today we are opposed to
 
04:21:44.630 --> 04:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1 two 3 4 um our land our
 
04:21:47.070 --> 04:21:47.080 align:start position:0%
Members Own and or manage about a
 
04:21:49.469 --> 04:21:49.479 align:start position:0%
million Acres across the state of New
 
04:21:52.030 --> 04:21:52.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and a lot of this land is
 
04:21:54.309 --> 04:21:54.319 align:start position:0%
accessible via class six
 
04:21:56.990 --> 04:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
roads um as you had heard earlier from
 
04:21:58.950 --> 04:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
representative Boyd some of these roads
 
04:22:01.830 --> 04:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
have residences some of them don't
 
04:22:03.870 --> 04:22:03.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes the land owners live on it
 
04:22:05.830 --> 04:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes you know they are one of those
 
04:22:09.870 --> 04:22:09.880 align:start position:0%
residences and sometimes they're not and
 
04:22:12.149 --> 04:22:12.159 align:start position:0%
so when we looked at this piece of
 
04:22:14.790 --> 04:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
legislation and and we too were involved
 
04:22:17.389 --> 04:22:17.399 align:start position:0%
in the whole the the original debate on
 
04:22:19.429 --> 04:22:19.439 align:start position:0%
on private roads
 
04:22:22.630 --> 04:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
earlier um but when we looked at this
 
04:22:25.269 --> 04:22:25.279 align:start position:0%
legislation in this proposal there were
 
04:22:27.070 --> 04:22:27.080 align:start position:0%
a couple things that really just jumped
 
04:22:31.229 --> 04:22:31.239 align:start position:0%
out at us um the term contribute
 
04:22:33.429 --> 04:22:33.439 align:start position:0%
equitably what does that
 
04:22:37.830 --> 04:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
mean number of trips um the gross
 
04:22:40.309 --> 04:22:40.319 align:start position:0%
vehicle weight if I have a if I live on
 
04:22:43.510 --> 04:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
a class six Road and I have a wood lot
 
04:22:45.469 --> 04:22:45.479 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to do a Timber
 
04:22:48.550 --> 04:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
Harvest am I now going to be is my
 
04:22:50.830 --> 04:22:50.840 align:start position:0%
Equitable contribution go up that year
 
04:22:53.990 --> 04:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
that I'm doing a Timber sale does it get
 
04:22:57.229 --> 04:22:57.239 align:start position:0%
adjusted um that was one piece is it the
 
04:23:01.590 --> 04:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
number of feet on the road um does that
 
04:23:04.389 --> 04:23:04.399 align:start position:0%
indic would that be an indication I have
 
04:23:07.149 --> 04:23:07.159 align:start position:0%
a residence and then again I have a 100
 
04:23:09.309 --> 04:23:09.319 align:start position:0%
acres and now they look at my my
 
04:23:13.510 --> 04:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
Frontage is that quote cons considered
 
04:23:16.750 --> 04:23:16.760 align:start position:0%
Equitable um that was one thing that
 
04:23:19.469 --> 04:23:19.479 align:start position:0%
really jumped out the other and as you
 
04:23:22.070 --> 04:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
had heard you know
 
04:23:24.950 --> 04:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
the well let me back up the other thing
 
04:23:28.830 --> 04:23:28.840 align:start position:0%
that really created a a concern for us
 
04:23:31.269 --> 04:23:31.279 align:start position:0%
was some of the definitions and in
 
04:23:35.070 --> 04:23:35.080 align:start position:0%
paragraph Roman 1 they talk about
 
04:23:39.030 --> 04:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
residences enjoying Jo a common benefit
 
04:23:42.590 --> 04:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
and then you drop down to line nine um
 
04:23:45.710 --> 04:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
you're talking about a budding and
 
04:23:47.510 --> 04:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
whether you directly or
 
04:23:51.030 --> 04:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
indirectly I have a piece of property my
 
04:23:53.189 --> 04:23:53.199 align:start position:0%
residents that that a butts a class six
 
04:23:56.349 --> 04:23:56.359 align:start position:0%
road on the along the back side of
 
04:23:59.550 --> 04:23:59.560 align:start position:0%
it and I may live on a class five road
 
04:24:01.710 --> 04:24:01.720 align:start position:0%
on the other side of that property but I
 
04:24:05.389 --> 04:24:05.399 align:start position:0%
ABD it am I affected by this am I in the
 
04:24:07.149 --> 04:24:07.159 align:start position:0%
soup on this
 
04:24:08.990 --> 04:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
I have a property that I do have a
 
04:24:11.670 --> 04:24:11.680 align:start position:0%
residential property that abuts it is
 
04:24:15.630 --> 04:24:15.640 align:start position:0%
that now and again if I do a Timber sale
 
04:24:18.550 --> 04:24:18.560 align:start position:0%
um I I cut some wood and I have trucks
 
04:24:22.269 --> 04:24:22.279 align:start position:0%
coming and going is that would I now how
 
04:24:25.229 --> 04:24:25.239 align:start position:0%
would that apply to me so that was the
 
04:24:26.910 --> 04:24:26.920 align:start position:0%
other piece that kind of jumped out at
 
04:24:29.429 --> 04:24:29.439 align:start position:0%
us is saying all right what what exactly
 
04:24:33.149 --> 04:24:33.159 align:start position:0%
does this does how does that does that
 
04:24:36.189 --> 04:24:36.199 align:start position:0%
uh affect us the other piece and I think
 
04:24:38.950 --> 04:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
as you heard that the sponsor is they're
 
04:24:41.830 --> 04:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
they have a a a voluntary it sounds like
 
04:24:43.510 --> 04:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
they have a voluntary Association and
 
04:24:44.870 --> 04:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
they're having a hard time getting
 
04:24:48.189 --> 04:24:48.199 align:start position:0%
everyone to Annie upd and so what better
 
04:24:51.469 --> 04:24:51.479 align:start position:0%
way then let's pass a law and require
 
04:24:54.349 --> 04:24:54.359 align:start position:0%
this assoc these Association members to
 
04:24:57.590 --> 04:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
anti up dues and Andor create a civil
 
04:24:59.269 --> 04:24:59.279 align:start position:0%
action against them if I guess if they
 
04:25:02.030 --> 04:25:02.040 align:start position:0%
don't pay their dues to us that seemed a
 
04:25:02.040 --> 04:25:03.030 align:start position:0%
don't pay their dues to us that seemed a
little

04:25:03.030 --> 04:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
little
 
04:25:06.229 --> 04:25:06.239 align:start position:0%
heavy-handed um the other and then
 
04:25:08.349 --> 04:25:08.359 align:start position:0%
fundamentally what we're talking about
 
04:25:12.189 --> 04:25:12.199 align:start position:0%
here is taking private money and putting
 
04:25:15.910 --> 04:25:15.920 align:start position:0%
it into a public asset a class six road
 
04:25:19.750 --> 04:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
is a Town Road it's it's an odd duck
 
04:25:23.950 --> 04:25:23.960 align:start position:0%
town has no uh you know obligation to to
 
04:25:26.630 --> 04:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
repair it maintain it but it's still a
 
04:25:29.149 --> 04:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
town right of way when we go to do a
 
04:25:31.590 --> 04:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
Timber sale or we go to access a
 
04:25:33.870 --> 04:25:33.880 align:start position:0%
property and we're going to use a class
 
04:25:36.510 --> 04:25:36.520 align:start position:0%
six Road and we have to we have to we
 
04:25:39.269 --> 04:25:39.279 align:start position:0%
have to do some updates to it we we are
 
04:25:41.750 --> 04:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
obligated to go to the town the
 
04:25:44.870 --> 04:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
selectman or the road agent and present
 
04:25:47.109 --> 04:25:47.119 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do and they have to
 
04:25:49.750 --> 04:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
approve it if we monkey or touch that
 
04:25:52.309 --> 04:25:52.319 align:start position:0%
road without that approval that's a
 
04:25:55.429 --> 04:25:55.439 align:start position:0%
violation of of existing law and what
 
04:25:57.510 --> 04:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here is creating
 
04:26:00.469 --> 04:26:00.479 align:start position:0%
kind of this other type of class six
 
04:26:02.870 --> 04:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
Road where you have private money going
 
04:26:06.469 --> 04:26:06.479 align:start position:0%
in and it sounds like on a regular basis
 
04:26:09.070 --> 04:26:09.080 align:start position:0%
maintaining and doing maintenance on a
 
04:26:12.070 --> 04:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
on a on a public
 
04:26:12.080 --> 04:26:14.349 align:start position:0%
on a on a public
asset

04:26:14.349 --> 04:26:14.359 align:start position:0%
asset
 
04:26:18.349 --> 04:26:18.359 align:start position:0%
um there is a process if if you have a a
 
04:26:21.990 --> 04:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
class six Road and you have a bunch of
 
04:26:24.910 --> 04:26:24.920 align:start position:0%
residences that that live on it which
 
04:26:27.349 --> 04:26:27.359 align:start position:0%
sounds like this may be a a unique case
 
04:26:29.510 --> 04:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
there is a process to get that road
 
04:26:33.349 --> 04:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
designated a private road um it happens
 
04:26:36.149 --> 04:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
not frequently but it does happen um and
 
04:26:39.070 --> 04:26:39.080 align:start position:0%
so there is a process already in place
 
04:26:42.710 --> 04:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
in which case existing law as we' see
 
04:26:44.790 --> 04:26:44.800 align:start position:0%
quite clearly in the bill there's a
 
04:26:47.349 --> 04:26:47.359 align:start position:0%
mechanism there so get it
 
04:26:50.309 --> 04:26:50.319 align:start position:0%
designated get it designated a private
 
04:26:52.630 --> 04:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
road um have your
 
04:26:55.750 --> 04:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
Association you know get out the vote at
 
04:26:57.990 --> 04:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
town meeting get it designated a private
 
04:27:00.070 --> 04:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
road and at that point you have a
 
04:27:03.469 --> 04:27:03.479 align:start position:0%
vehicle already in law to address your
 
04:27:04.750 --> 04:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
your your
 
04:27:07.830 --> 04:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
issue um
 
04:27:10.830 --> 04:27:10.840 align:start position:0%
and then the last thing is there were
 
04:27:11.910 --> 04:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
some questions and I think
 
04:27:14.229 --> 04:27:14.239 align:start position:0%
representative Boyd had mentioned this
 
04:27:16.389 --> 04:27:16.399 align:start position:0%
building on a class six Road there are
 
04:27:18.750 --> 04:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
there are waivers that get signed there
 
04:27:21.990 --> 04:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
is a process um and the other thing
 
04:27:23.710 --> 04:27:23.720 align:start position:0%
that's worth noting is if someone does
 
04:27:26.590 --> 04:27:26.600 align:start position:0%
build on a class six Road you know
 
04:27:30.830 --> 04:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
that's you know they build on it they go
 
04:27:33.710 --> 04:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
into it with their eyes wide open this
 
04:27:36.630 --> 04:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
is what is expected for services is this
 
04:27:40.269 --> 04:27:40.279 align:start position:0%
is what I can expect and so there is a
 
04:27:43.429 --> 04:27:43.439 align:start position:0%
process there's transparency there and I
 
04:27:45.870 --> 04:27:45.880 align:start position:0%
would I would dare say that the the the
 
04:27:49.750 --> 04:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
value the the the value of that home or
 
04:27:52.950 --> 04:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
residence reflects that if I have a and
 
04:27:54.790 --> 04:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
and I just had this discussion on a bill
 
04:27:56.990 --> 04:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
in the Senate if I have two identical
 
04:27:59.870 --> 04:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
homes one is on a class six Road and
 
04:28:02.070 --> 04:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
then I have another which is on a
 
04:28:04.590 --> 04:28:04.600 align:start position:0%
maintained road with trash pickup snow
 
04:28:06.950 --> 04:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
plowing from the town and my classic
 
04:28:10.269 --> 04:28:10.279 align:start position:0%
Road I'm kind of on my own my sales
 
04:28:12.469 --> 04:28:12.479 align:start position:0%
values are going to differ the Market's
 
04:28:16.070 --> 04:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
working the market takes care of this um
 
04:28:18.670 --> 04:28:18.680 align:start position:0%
so again I I don't we don't believe this
 
04:28:21.349 --> 04:28:21.359 align:start position:0%
bill is necessary we see it as kind of
 
04:28:24.229 --> 04:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
opening up the door to a lot of
 
04:28:24.239 --> 04:28:25.510 align:start position:0%
opening up the door to a lot of
potential

04:28:25.510 --> 04:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
potential
 
04:28:29.349 --> 04:28:29.359 align:start position:0%
litigation um someone gets grumpy about
 
04:28:29.359 --> 04:28:30.030 align:start position:0%
litigation um someone gets grumpy about
you

04:28:30.030 --> 04:28:30.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:28:32.590 --> 04:28:32.600 align:start position:0%
know neighbors fighting neighbors over
 
04:28:34.790 --> 04:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
who's going to maintain the road you
 
04:28:37.109 --> 04:28:37.119 align:start position:0%
drove during mud season and you weren't
 
04:28:39.030 --> 04:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
supposed to do that and I'm going to
 
04:28:41.510 --> 04:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
bring a civil action against you to fix
 
04:28:45.550 --> 04:28:45.560 align:start position:0%
those ruts we just see it we just see
 
04:28:47.349 --> 04:28:47.359 align:start position:0%
and again all of this is taking place on
 
04:28:52.229 --> 04:28:52.239 align:start position:0%
a public right away so for us don't we
 
04:28:55.950 --> 04:28:55.960 align:start position:0%
we we urge you there other vote itl on
 
04:28:58.070 --> 04:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
this there are mechanisms already in
 
04:29:00.630 --> 04:29:00.640 align:start position:0%
place for this particular situation to
 
04:29:03.109 --> 04:29:03.119 align:start position:0%
address it they can go ahead get it
 
04:29:05.429 --> 04:29:05.439 align:start position:0%
designated private and they can raise
 
04:29:07.429 --> 04:29:07.439 align:start position:0%
all the do money Do's money they want
 
04:29:10.910 --> 04:29:10.920 align:start position:0%
and fix it but to take every class six
 
04:29:13.229 --> 04:29:13.239 align:start position:0%
road that has a residence on it and
 
04:29:16.830 --> 04:29:16.840 align:start position:0%
quite as you as came out Force those
 
04:29:20.870 --> 04:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
residences into an agreement I I just
 
04:29:23.469 --> 04:29:23.479 align:start position:0%
don't think that's right and and nor I
 
04:29:27.149 --> 04:29:27.159 align:start position:0%
shouldn't say me the associ nhtoa thank
 
04:29:29.750 --> 04:29:29.760 align:start position:0%

and I'd be happy to try and answer some
 
04:29:34.349 --> 04:29:34.359 align:start position:0%
questions thank you um

04:29:40.590 --> 04:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
in law to to uh use The Ballot Box and
 
04:29:42.790 --> 04:29:42.800 align:start position:0%
turn those roads into a private road if
 
04:29:44.109 --> 04:29:44.119 align:start position:0%
they're doing a good enough job with
 
04:29:46.870 --> 04:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
maintenance there's also a unability in
 
04:29:48.630 --> 04:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
law to turn it into a public road again
 
04:29:51.070 --> 04:29:51.080 align:start position:0%
as well correct you are
 
04:29:53.670 --> 04:29:53.680 align:start position:0%
correct F further questions yes
 
04:29:53.680 --> 04:29:54.990 align:start position:0%
correct F further questions yes
represent

04:29:54.990 --> 04:29:55.000 align:start position:0%
represent
 
04:29:57.349 --> 04:29:57.359 align:start position:0%
vulner wh this in the form of a question
 
04:29:59.990 --> 04:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
then do you recall that we had this
 
04:30:02.950 --> 04:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
original Bill several years ago we had
 
04:30:05.950 --> 04:30:05.960 align:start position:0%
extensive negotiations over essenti
 
04:30:09.389 --> 04:30:09.399 align:start position:0%
every single word in the in the
 
04:30:11.710 --> 04:30:11.720 align:start position:0%
bill and
 
04:30:15.590 --> 04:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
um in in in in particular there was a
 
04:30:17.229 --> 04:30:17.239 align:start position:0%
concern about the timber
 
04:30:20.309 --> 04:30:20.319 align:start position:0%
owners and the words selected here I
 
04:30:24.269 --> 04:30:24.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:26.790 --> 04:30:26.800 align:start position:0%
time took the logging operations off the
 
04:30:28.469 --> 04:30:28.479 align:start position:0%
hook there was no responsibility it's
 
04:30:32.229 --> 04:30:32.239 align:start position:0%
only for residential users so is there
 
04:30:34.030 --> 04:30:34.040 align:start position:0%
has there been any experience that that
 
04:30:35.870 --> 04:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
hasn't worked the way people people
 
04:30:38.309 --> 04:30:38.319 align:start position:0%
expected it to on private
 
04:30:40.950 --> 04:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
roads thank you for your question I've
 
04:30:43.790 --> 04:30:43.800 align:start position:0%
not I have not gotten any feedback I
 
04:30:46.429 --> 04:30:46.439 align:start position:0%
will admit not a lot of wood I think a
 
04:30:48.950 --> 04:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
heck of a lot more wood gets cut and
 
04:30:52.030 --> 04:30:52.040 align:start position:0%
harvested and transported over class six
 
04:30:55.630 --> 04:30:55.640 align:start position:0%
roads than than private roads I would
 
04:30:58.309 --> 04:30:58.319 align:start position:0%
again you go particularly some of these
 
04:31:00.870 --> 04:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
rural parts of the state you look at
 
04:31:03.269 --> 04:31:03.279 align:start position:0%
these Town maps and you'll see roads a
 
04:31:05.630 --> 04:31:05.640 align:start position:0%
spiderweb of roads and a lot of them are
 
04:31:08.590 --> 04:31:08.600 align:start position:0%
class six roads uh as opposed to private
 
04:31:12.670 --> 04:31:12.680 align:start position:0%
roads so we did a lot of negotiation I
 
04:31:14.990 --> 04:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
remember working very closely with you
 
04:31:18.070 --> 04:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
on that and at the end of the day we we
 
04:31:21.790 --> 04:31:21.800 align:start position:0%
held our nose and we we we were we were
 
04:31:24.189 --> 04:31:24.199 align:start position:0%
helpers and we went along with this
 
04:31:27.269 --> 04:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
because we recognized there was this
 
04:31:29.830 --> 04:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
this problem and that was The Fanny May
 
04:31:34.229 --> 04:31:34.239 align:start position:0%
Freddy Mack F uh issue and we said all
 
04:31:36.269 --> 04:31:36.279 align:start position:0%
right we're not not dealing with the
 
04:31:38.990 --> 04:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
Fanny May Freddy Mack issue this time
 
04:31:40.469 --> 04:31:40.479 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with some folks that are
 
04:31:44.109 --> 04:31:44.119 align:start position:0%
in association that say I don't want to
 
04:31:46.990 --> 04:31:47.000 align:start position:0%
pay little different thank you thank you
 
04:31:50.710 --> 04:31:50.720 align:start position:0%
any further questions Mr St
 
04:31:53.109 --> 04:31:53.119 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
04:31:55.750 --> 04:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'd like to give
 
04:31:58.990 --> 04:31:59.000 align:start position:0%
you a scenario and give me your best
 
04:32:00.750 --> 04:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
guess of how it would work let's say
 
04:32:04.269 --> 04:32:04.279 align:start position:0%
there's a class six Road that's a mile
 
04:32:06.550 --> 04:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
long with there's two people that live
 
04:32:08.510 --> 04:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
on it one lives at the
 
04:32:11.070 --> 04:32:11.080 align:start position:0%
End by the road that is
 
04:32:13.189 --> 04:32:13.199 align:start position:0%
maintained the other person lives at the
 
04:32:14.630 --> 04:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
other and a mile
 
04:32:16.990 --> 04:32:17.000 align:start position:0%
away there's only two people that live
 
04:32:18.790 --> 04:32:18.800 align:start position:0%
on that road how would you explain how
 
04:32:21.630 --> 04:32:21.640 align:start position:0%
this law would they would do the
 
04:32:24.030 --> 04:32:24.040 align:start position:0%
equitableness of that law and how would
 
04:32:28.469 --> 04:32:28.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:30.870 --> 04:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
other let's not resort to let's not
 
04:32:34.070 --> 04:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
resort to let's not resort to violence
 
04:32:36.510 --> 04:32:36.520 align:start position:0%
you you you're you're you're you're
 
04:32:40.389 --> 04:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
highlighting one of my my key points is
 
04:32:43.189 --> 04:32:43.199 align:start position:0%
just this as drafted how do you
 
04:32:45.750 --> 04:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
determine that that question of
 
04:32:49.910 --> 04:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
equitability I may drive 50 feet on it
 
04:32:52.550 --> 04:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
to get out to the the main Highway a
 
04:32:52.560 --> 04:32:53.510 align:start position:0%
to get out to the the main Highway a
state

04:32:53.510 --> 04:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:32:59.109 --> 04:32:59.119 align:start position:0%
road and the other residence drives 500
 
04:33:04.349 --> 04:33:04.359 align:start position:0%
yards why on this bill this bill what is
 
04:33:07.269 --> 04:33:07.279 align:start position:0%
equitable how do you determine that and
 
04:33:10.949 --> 04:33:10.959 align:start position:0%

you thank you Mr chair members of the
 
04:34:12.949 --> 04:34:12.959 align:start position:0%
committee for the record Rob Johnson

Bureau as a federation's policy
 
04:34:20.750 --> 04:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
director and yes we we we are opposed um
 
04:34:24.551 --> 04:34:24.561 align:start position:0%
very similar to Mr stock uh few years
 
04:34:28.709 --> 04:34:28.719 align:start position:0%
back um we worked uh very closely with
 
04:34:30.789 --> 04:34:30.799 align:start position:0%
the Timberland owners and with the
 
04:34:34.150 --> 04:34:34.160 align:start position:0%
former representative from Derry uh on
 
04:34:36.551 --> 04:34:36.561 align:start position:0%
on the private w a bill as he said it
 
04:34:38.629 --> 04:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
was a three-year process uh we spent
 
04:34:41.310 --> 04:34:41.320 align:start position:0%
many hours at my office trying to trying
 
04:34:43.470 --> 04:34:43.480 align:start position:0%
to iron out in the iron out things in
 
04:34:46.269 --> 04:34:46.279 align:start position:0%
the end we we we kind of we I'd say held
 
04:34:49.189 --> 04:34:49.199 align:start position:0%
our nose and went along uh but as been
 
04:34:52.109 --> 04:34:52.119 align:start position:0%
pointed out by by representative jacked
 
04:34:54.949 --> 04:34:54.959 align:start position:0%
earlier and others that that was Rel uh
 
04:34:57.029 --> 04:34:57.039 align:start position:0%
the purpose of that bill is access to
 
04:35:01.789 --> 04:35:01.799 align:start position:0%
financing and and uh we could see it uh
 
04:35:04.429 --> 04:35:04.439 align:start position:0%
and this is different as Mr stalk has
 
04:35:06.709 --> 04:35:06.719 align:start position:0%
pointed out this class six roads are
 
04:35:09.189 --> 04:35:09.199 align:start position:0%
public ways and you're you're asking
 
04:35:11.590 --> 04:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
these individuals who who would be
 
04:35:14.670 --> 04:35:14.680 align:start position:0%
required to um put put their resources
 
04:35:17.390 --> 04:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
towards a onto a public way and and it
 
04:35:20.990 --> 04:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
was why it was not included in the the
 
04:35:23.189 --> 04:35:23.199 align:start position:0%
uh when the the private way Bill became
 
04:35:25.990 --> 04:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
lot that was that was understood and and
 
04:35:28.029 --> 04:35:28.039 align:start position:0%
why we didn't the other thing I'd like
 
04:35:29.510 --> 04:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
to point out and I guess probably like
 
04:35:30.750 --> 04:35:30.760 align:start position:0%
everything I'm going to say has already
 
04:35:32.670 --> 04:35:32.680 align:start position:0%
been touched on one way or another but
 
04:35:35.789 --> 04:35:35.799 align:start position:0%
when when the uh land owners on these
 
04:35:38.551 --> 04:35:38.561 align:start position:0%
class six roads uh purchased their
 
04:35:41.070 --> 04:35:41.080 align:start position:0%
property they knew the
 
04:35:44.189 --> 04:35:44.199 align:start position:0%
deal they certainly should have if they
 
04:35:47.349 --> 04:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
didn't I think it's it's it's that it's
 
04:35:51.429 --> 04:35:51.439 align:start position:0%
that simple uh and and I I'll try to
 
04:35:54.670 --> 04:35:54.680 align:start position:0%
touch on a a a question or two
 
04:35:56.750 --> 04:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
representative faulon your experience
 
04:35:58.949 --> 04:35:58.959 align:start position:0%
and I can just tell you a personal one
 
04:36:01.789 --> 04:36:01.799 align:start position:0%
or more relative to the private way but
 
04:36:03.590 --> 04:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
my my family owns a a cottage on
 
04:36:06.590 --> 04:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
Northwood Lake that something my uh my
 
04:36:11.670 --> 04:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
my dad and my aunt purchased 1950 is and
 
04:36:14.670 --> 04:36:14.680 align:start position:0%
um it's always been voluntary we
 
04:36:16.869 --> 04:36:16.879 align:start position:0%
contributed to maintenance of the road
 
04:36:18.429 --> 04:36:18.439 align:start position:0%
and if you drive down the road it's
 
04:36:20.470 --> 04:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
about half a mile and we're the we're
 
04:36:22.590 --> 04:36:22.600 align:start position:0%
basically the second Cottage and then
 
04:36:26.150 --> 04:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
the road goes on for a couple miles and
 
04:36:28.269 --> 04:36:28.279 align:start position:0%
my my family it's a a summer Cottage
 
04:36:30.789 --> 04:36:30.799 align:start position:0%
it's not winter rise we we we we like it
 
04:36:32.830 --> 04:36:32.840 align:start position:0%
when it snows and it's not plow because
 
04:36:34.269 --> 04:36:34.279 align:start position:0%
then we're we're a little bit more
 
04:36:36.269 --> 04:36:36.279 align:start position:0%
comfortable because it it prohibits
 
04:36:39.709 --> 04:36:39.719 align:start position:0%
access from people to get in and but now
 
04:36:44.949 --> 04:36:44.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:48.390 --> 04:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:51.269 --> 04:36:51.279 align:start position:0%
press I believe every other Cottage in
 
04:36:53.910 --> 04:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
the 20 somewhat on that Shore are now
 
04:36:56.709 --> 04:36:56.719 align:start position:0%
winterized where there are full-time
 
04:36:59.949 --> 04:36:59.959 align:start position:0%
residences and uh we have not uh
 
04:37:02.470 --> 04:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
contributed to the the uh have been
 
04:37:04.709 --> 04:37:04.719 align:start position:0%
contributing to the the the fund for the
 
04:37:07.269 --> 04:37:07.279 align:start position:0%
years way back we we my family
 
04:37:08.949 --> 04:37:08.959 align:start position:0%
contributed quite a bit we actually
 
04:37:12.070 --> 04:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
built built uh brought in some some uh
 
04:37:14.709 --> 04:37:14.719 align:start position:0%
um material and did a lot of work um but
 
04:37:17.150 --> 04:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
since it's been uh the others a fulltime
 
04:37:19.189 --> 04:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
we we feel like well we're only using it
 
04:37:20.390 --> 04:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
a short portion we're right at the
 
04:37:22.869 --> 04:37:22.879 align:start position:0%
beginning but we have been threatened
 
04:37:24.990 --> 04:37:25.000 align:start position:0%
with with the they' show with the new
 
04:37:26.510 --> 04:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
law and said hey if you don't contribute
 
04:37:29.269 --> 04:37:29.279 align:start position:0%
we're gonna and and we it's just hasn't
 
04:37:31.830 --> 04:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
been worth it we we we have contributed
 
04:37:33.150 --> 04:37:33.160 align:start position:0%
though we still don't think we should be
 
04:37:35.310 --> 04:37:35.320 align:start position:0%
have to contribute to the amount the the
 
04:37:37.990 --> 04:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
others uh do so just it gives you a
 
04:37:42.990 --> 04:37:43.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:46.551 --> 04:37:46.561 align:start position:0%

selling as to financing and did any
 
04:39:28.029 --> 04:39:28.039 align:start position:0%
mortgage lender get interested in what
 
04:39:30.709 --> 04:39:30.719 align:start position:0%
the deal was with the road uh to the
 
04:39:32.869 --> 04:39:32.879 align:start position:0%

been an issue with mortgage
 
04:39:41.350 --> 04:39:41.360 align:start position:0%
people uh recently we do try to make uh
 
04:39:43.830 --> 04:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
the representing realtor the listing
 
04:39:46.190 --> 04:39:46.200 align:start position:0%
agent aware that we have this
 
04:39:48.868 --> 04:39:48.878 align:start position:0%
Association and they pass that on
 
04:39:53.430 --> 04:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
to uh prospective homeowners and new
 
04:39:57.030 --> 04:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
property owners have all uh been paying
 
04:39:59.230 --> 04:39:59.240 align:start position:0%
but it's again it's continuing
 
04:40:01.590 --> 04:40:01.600 align:start position:0%
voluntarily and and just to thank you is
 
04:40:04.030 --> 04:40:04.040 align:start position:0%
there a followup question yes and I made
 
04:40:06.708 --> 04:40:06.718 align:start position:0%
a note but there is nothing in the
 
04:40:09.150 --> 04:40:09.160 align:start position:0%
deeded information for any of the
 
04:40:12.390 --> 04:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
properties about this it's just an an a
 
04:40:12.400 --> 04:40:13.628 align:start position:0%
properties about this it's just an an a
gentlemen's

04:40:13.628 --> 04:40:13.638 align:start position:0%
gentlemen's
 
04:40:16.070 --> 04:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
agreement yes that's correct and and
 
04:40:21.750 --> 04:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
that's our challenge uh where uh every
 
04:40:24.990 --> 04:40:25.000 align:start position:0%
piece of road down to a class six that
 
04:40:26.430 --> 04:40:26.440 align:start position:0%
people live
 
04:40:29.590 --> 04:40:29.600 align:start position:0%
on there's a method to collect
 
04:40:33.350 --> 04:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
payment uh to maintain the road but uh
 
04:40:35.628 --> 04:40:35.638 align:start position:0%
those of us on this class six we have no
 
04:40:38.470 --> 04:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
method to enforce that and that was one
 
04:40:41.510 --> 04:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
of the main concerns here thank you
 
04:40:43.190 --> 04:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any further
 
04:40:46.110 --> 04:40:46.120 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none uh on the blue
 
04:40:47.910 --> 04:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
sheet uh the only people that have
 
04:40:50.830 --> 04:40:50.840 align:start position:0%
signed the blue sheet are the speakers
 
04:40:52.550 --> 04:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
uh that you've heard from and they're
 
04:40:56.030 --> 04:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
showing two for and two against um with
 
04:40:59.310 --> 04:40:59.320 align:start position:0%
that I will pull to a close House Bill

04:42:33.560 --> 04:42:54.230 align:start position:0%
 
questions

04:42:54.230 --> 04:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:55.750 --> 04:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
this where we bring out the hard
 
04:43:03.470 --> 04:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:07.550 --> 04:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:25.788 --> 04:43:25.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:28.070 --> 04:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
Mark trouble with this I will now open
 
04:43:31.190 --> 04:43:31.200 align:start position:0%

1631 uh and this is uh extending the
 
04:43:36.628 --> 04:43:36.638 align:start position:0%
commission on the revenue Alternatives
 
04:43:40.070 --> 04:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
the road toll and I will now call upon
 
04:43:42.230 --> 04:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
uh the Bill's Prime sponsor
 
04:43:44.590 --> 04:43:44.600 align:start position:0%
representative mark mcon
 
04:43:47.868 --> 04:43:47.878 align:start position:0%
welome thank you uh Mr chairman um
 
04:43:50.270 --> 04:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
illustrious members of this wonderful
 
04:43:53.670 --> 04:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
powerful committee I uh I sit before you
 
04:43:56.830 --> 04:43:56.840 align:start position:0%
and uh ask for your attention at least
 
04:43:59.670 --> 04:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
momentarily I for the record my name is
 
04:44:02.230 --> 04:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
Mark makoni I represent the good people
 
04:44:04.990 --> 04:44:05.000 align:start position:0%
of Carol 8 in Carol
 
04:44:08.470 --> 04:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
County um I have had the pleasure of
 
04:44:11.430 --> 04:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
chairing this commission um over the
 
04:44:12.708 --> 04:44:12.718 align:start position:0%
last two
 
04:44:14.990 --> 04:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
years uh it's relative to extending the
 
04:44:17.350 --> 04:44:17.360 align:start position:0%
commission study Revenue alternatives to
 
04:44:18.670 --> 04:44:18.680 align:start position:0%
the road
 
04:44:22.510 --> 04:44:22.520 align:start position:0%
toll um it won't come as um as much of a
 
04:44:25.910 --> 04:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
surprise to this committee uh but the
 
04:44:27.750 --> 04:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
funding that we're receiving on a
 
04:44:31.868 --> 04:44:31.878 align:start position:0%
continual basis is uh is mostly tied to
 
04:44:34.868 --> 04:44:34.878 align:start position:0%
the federal and the state road toll uh
 
04:44:37.708 --> 04:44:37.718 align:start position:0%
in the the feds I believe have not
 
04:44:39.390 --> 04:44:39.400 align:start position:0%
raised that
 
04:44:43.430 --> 04:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
contribution in more than 16 years it
 
04:44:45.868 --> 04:44:45.878 align:start position:0%
might be more than that and there's a
 
04:44:48.510 --> 04:44:48.520 align:start position:0%
reluctance by the state uh ever to
 
04:44:51.708 --> 04:44:51.718 align:start position:0%
increase our um our fees on our gas for
 
04:44:51.718 --> 04:44:52.550 align:start position:0%
increase our um our fees on our gas for
more

04:44:52.550 --> 04:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
more
 
04:44:55.670 --> 04:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
income the second big issue is so we
 
04:44:57.550 --> 04:44:57.560 align:start position:0%
we've got this small pot of money that
 
04:45:00.070 --> 04:45:00.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a chance to grow uh the
 
04:45:02.590 --> 04:45:02.600 align:start position:0%
second is we have Federal mandates to
 
04:45:05.070 --> 04:45:05.080 align:start position:0%
make cars and trucks more more efficient
 
04:45:09.470 --> 04:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
all of the time and when we do that um
 
04:45:12.910 --> 04:45:12.920 align:start position:0%
we are buying less gasoline and Diesel
 
04:45:15.470 --> 04:45:15.480 align:start position:0%
and when we buy less our contribution
 
04:45:17.750 --> 04:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
again is less we then have the
 
04:45:21.070 --> 04:45:21.080 align:start position:0%
introduction of electric vehicles which
 
04:45:26.070 --> 04:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
um EVS um have until just I believe last
 
04:45:28.750 --> 04:45:28.760 align:start position:0%
year are now contributing on their
 
04:45:31.390 --> 04:45:31.400 align:start position:0%
registration fee for their use of the
 
04:45:34.788 --> 04:45:34.798 align:start position:0%
roads so we we have an issue
 
04:45:37.550 --> 04:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
that is just getting harder and harder
 
04:45:41.430 --> 04:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
we have I I cannot tell you next to this
 
04:45:44.070 --> 04:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
committee's membership how proud I am of
 
04:45:46.390 --> 04:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
the commission members uh everyone comes
 
04:45:50.550 --> 04:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
in sits down and uh and we're digging in
 
04:45:53.910 --> 04:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
trying to find a way forward there there
 
04:45:56.070 --> 04:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
there must be a better method to fund
 
04:45:59.270 --> 04:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
our roads and our bridges and our issue
 
04:46:01.788 --> 04:46:01.798 align:start position:0%
to date on this commission is it started
 
04:46:04.910 --> 04:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
with a piece of legislation and and do
 
04:46:08.270 --> 04:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
out to report uh our findings by the end
 
04:46:11.150 --> 04:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
of the year but by the time the first
 
04:46:13.310 --> 04:46:13.320 align:start position:0%
year rolled around by the time the
 
04:46:16.948 --> 04:46:16.958 align:start position:0%
governor um um put his signature on the
 
04:46:20.868 --> 04:46:20.878 align:start position:0%
bill uh we met only two times the next
 
04:46:22.948 --> 04:46:22.958 align:start position:0%
year we thought we were doing wonderful
 
04:46:24.030 --> 04:46:24.040 align:start position:0%
we thought it was going to be
 
04:46:25.868 --> 04:46:25.878 align:start position:0%
fast-tracked and it was going to be
 
04:46:28.670 --> 04:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
brought forward in a much quicker Manner
 
04:46:32.628 --> 04:46:32.638 align:start position:0%
and again uh we ended up uh only getting
 
04:46:34.990 --> 04:46:35.000 align:start position:0%
uh meeting officially we were asked not
 
04:46:36.750 --> 04:46:36.760 align:start position:0%
to meet over the summer which brought us
 
04:46:39.830 --> 04:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
into September and we met in Earnest
 
04:46:42.910 --> 04:46:42.920 align:start position:0%
every couple weeks and uh filed our
 
04:46:45.110 --> 04:46:45.120 align:start position:0%
report but we're we're not making
 
04:46:52.150 --> 04:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
Headway so the the 1631 before you is to
 
04:46:54.430 --> 04:46:54.440 align:start position:0%
enact that commission one more time and
 
04:46:56.628 --> 04:46:56.638 align:start position:0%
I believe it runs us out for at least
 
04:47:00.430 --> 04:47:00.440 align:start position:0%
three years and it is our hope at the
 
04:47:03.590 --> 04:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
end of that period um and hoping that
 
04:47:03.600 --> 04:47:04.628 align:start position:0%
end of that period um and hoping that
there's

04:47:04.628 --> 04:47:04.638 align:start position:0%
there's
 
04:47:06.868 --> 04:47:06.878 align:start position:0%
possibly a federal solution we keep
 
04:47:08.990 --> 04:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
saying that this should probably be a a
 
04:47:11.510 --> 04:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
federal issue uh that we will make
 
04:47:14.708 --> 04:47:14.718 align:start position:0%
greater progress for the for the uh
 
04:47:18.150 --> 04:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
motoring public in our state so it's the
 
04:47:21.788 --> 04:47:21.798 align:start position:0%
same commission uh we it looks like we
 
04:47:25.190 --> 04:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
are going to there's appointments but I
 
04:47:27.110 --> 04:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
have some assurances that many of our
 
04:47:30.270 --> 04:47:30.280 align:start position:0%
members are hoping to be uh
 
04:47:33.470 --> 04:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
reappointed um and um I would hope that
 
04:47:36.708 --> 04:47:36.718 align:start position:0%
you would support this and uh I'm happy
 
04:47:39.990 --> 04:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
to take any questions if there are so
 
04:47:42.110 --> 04:47:42.120 align:start position:0%

please your Committee in the past ever
 
04:47:50.750 --> 04:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
considered the weight of vehicles as a
 
04:47:54.628 --> 04:47:54.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:58.590 --> 04:47:58.600 align:start position:0%

thank you and I and i' I've had the I've
 
04:48:03.670 --> 04:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
had the pleasure of some education on
 
04:48:04.590 --> 04:48:04.600 align:start position:0%
this matter
 
04:48:07.510 --> 04:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
matter by yourself and I and
 
04:48:10.110 --> 04:48:10.120 align:start position:0%
conversations and and I I believe your
 
04:48:14.430 --> 04:48:14.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:14.440 --> 04:48:16.230 align:start position:0%
 
considered

04:48:16.230 --> 04:48:16.240 align:start position:0%
considered
 
04:48:18.230 --> 04:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
you uh further questions of
 
04:48:19.628 --> 04:48:19.638 align:start position:0%

04:48:23.788 --> 04:48:23.798 align:start position:0%
uh represent vone please thank you and
 
04:48:27.310 --> 04:48:27.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh taking my question so
 
04:48:30.270 --> 04:48:30.280 align:start position:0%
we earlier heard
 
04:48:33.788 --> 04:48:33.798 align:start position:0%
1464 could you just help me we have this
 
04:48:35.270 --> 04:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
bill Bill too but I'm seeing a
 
04:48:38.310 --> 04:48:38.320 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of overlap thank you
 
04:48:42.150 --> 04:48:42.160 align:start position:0%
um when we were waiting to uh press an
 
04:48:45.110 --> 04:48:45.120 align:start position:0%
LSR uh for the continuation of the
 
04:48:47.350 --> 04:48:47.360 align:start position:0%
commission and was it what was the
 
04:48:49.868 --> 04:48:49.878 align:start position:0%
number again representative
 
04:48:53.910 --> 04:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
14 1464 if that's okay M
 
04:48:57.350 --> 04:48:57.360 align:start position:0%
1464 um many many members of the
 
04:49:00.110 --> 04:49:00.120 align:start position:0%
commission actually thought that someone
 
04:49:02.750 --> 04:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
had um had brought forward our
 
04:49:04.830 --> 04:49:04.840 align:start position:0%
legislation going forward but it appears
 
04:49:06.830 --> 04:49:06.840 align:start position:0%
to be a different Mission than what we
 
04:49:09.628 --> 04:49:09.638 align:start position:0%
have and I I think we will have
 
04:49:12.430 --> 04:49:12.440 align:start position:0%
conversation going forward Public Works
 
04:49:14.868 --> 04:49:14.878 align:start position:0%
and if perhaps maybe some of that could
 
04:49:19.270 --> 04:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:22.390 --> 04:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
commission represent Farner
 
04:49:24.628 --> 04:49:24.638 align:start position:0%
please thank you representative one of
 
04:49:27.670 --> 04:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
the concerns that I had expressed in the
 
04:49:30.788 --> 04:49:30.798 align:start position:0%
previous legislation was whether we're
 
04:49:34.510 --> 04:49:34.520 align:start position:0%
looking just at methods for collecting
 
04:49:36.350 --> 04:49:36.360 align:start position:0%
money to support the road
 
04:49:40.070 --> 04:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
system but that uh we should also be
 
04:49:42.948 --> 04:49:42.958 align:start position:0%
looking at what the what the volume of
 
04:49:44.708 --> 04:49:44.718 align:start position:0%
those needs are projecting down the road
 
04:49:48.430 --> 04:49:48.440 align:start position:0%
what what uh dollar amount do we need to
 
04:49:51.910 --> 04:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
maintain our road system uh in a manner
 
04:49:53.590 --> 04:49:53.600 align:start position:0%
in a safe manner in a manner that we
 
04:49:56.670 --> 04:49:56.680 align:start position:0%
expected to be uh provide service to
 
04:50:00.470 --> 04:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
their people and then use that to help
 
04:50:02.430 --> 04:50:02.440 align:start position:0%
determine how much and what kind of uh
 
04:50:04.910 --> 04:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
mechanisms might
 
04:50:07.510 --> 04:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
might work are we still looking at that
 
04:50:10.350 --> 04:50:10.360 align:start position:0%
long-term need or was it focusing have
