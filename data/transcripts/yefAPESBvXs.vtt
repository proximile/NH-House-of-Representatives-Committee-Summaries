good morning everyone
 
00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:31.759 align:start position:0%
in the interest of keeping the clocks
 
00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 align:start position:0%
and keeping the trains rather running on
 
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
time i'd like to call to order the

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
our meetings which typically this year
 
00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
so far have been on tuesdays
 
00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
but to
 
00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:00.639 align:start position:0%
upset that apple cart a little bit i
 
00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 align:start position:0%

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 align:start position:0%
we will meet again in this room we will
 
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 align:start position:0%

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:22.639 align:start position:0%
on the 5 bills
 
00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:25.759 align:start position:0%
that have been designated as early bills
 
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
by the clerk of the house
 
00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 align:start position:0%
those bills have to be
 
00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:33.759 align:start position:0%
reported on by february 17th
 
00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:34.629 align:start position:0%
reported on by february 17th
but

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:34.639 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 align:start position:0%
due to
 
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
some scheduling issues we've been
 
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
informed that they actually must be done
 
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
by february 10th
 
00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 align:start position:0%
so we will
 
00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:45.430 align:start position:0%
so we will
report

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:47.199 align:start position:0%
we'll have an exact session and report
 
00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
on those bills next monday february 7th
 
00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
we will meet again the next day tuesday
 
00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
february 8th
 
00:05:59.749 --> 00:05:59.759 align:start position:0%
to hear the final six bills
 
00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:00.469 align:start position:0%
to hear the final six bills
that

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
six house bills anyway that will come
 
00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 align:start position:0%
before us this year
 
00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 align:start position:0%
it has not yet
 
00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
been determined exactly when we will
 
00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639 align:start position:0%
exec the rest of our bills but we're
 
00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:16.479 align:start position:0%
looking right now at the week of
 
00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:17.670 align:start position:0%
looking right now at the week of
february

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
february
 
00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:18.950 align:start position:0%
february
21st

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
21st
 
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
so tuesday february 22nd would be a
 
00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
likely candidate
 
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
and another likely candidate would be
 
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
the following tuesday which would be
 
00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
march 1st
 
00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
so representative callie pitts you have
 
00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
a question i have a question about
 
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
we're going to exec and normally
 
00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
executive sessions
 
00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
is when we do business when we talk
 
00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
and i i just wondered if we were going
 
00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
to do any
 
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
discussion of any of these bills because
 
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
we're going quite late in the day
 
00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:55.039 align:start position:0%
that's all and then it just seemed like
 
00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
the public hearing we're
 
00:06:59.510 --> 00:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
more or less discussing at the public
 
00:07:01.749 --> 00:07:01.759 align:start position:0%
hearing but that's not normally the way
 
00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
okay well thank you for that question
 
00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:08.390 align:start position:0%
okay well thank you for that question
we

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
typically do confine our
 
00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.550 align:start position:0%
typically do confine our
intra

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:12.560 align:start position:0%
intra
 
00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
committee discussions to either
 
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work sessions
 
00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
full committee work sessions or
 
00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
because we've had very few people
 
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
testifying on a couple of recent bills
 
00:07:31.589 --> 00:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
last week for example we did have some
 
00:07:31.599 --> 00:07:32.629 align:start position:0%
last week for example we did have some
intra

00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:32.639 align:start position:0%
intra
 
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
committee discussion
 
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
of a couple of those bills simply
 
00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
because we had the time to do that and i
 
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
will continue to do that going forward
 
00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
if we have the time we will have those
 
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
we're basically
 
00:07:52.869 --> 00:07:52.879 align:start position:0%
full committee
 
00:07:55.029 --> 00:07:55.039 align:start position:0%
work session at that point
 
00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
um so it's a it's an appropriate thing
 
00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
now because we're having an exec session
 
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
next monday february 7th i would alert
 
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
all committee members
 
00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
that if you know you cannot be here next
 
00:08:14.629 --> 00:08:14.639 align:start position:0%
monday february 7th
 
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
either contact myself
 
00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
or representative samsich
 
00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
to arrange for a
 
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
a substitute for yourself if you can't
 
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
be here so as soon as you know that you
 
00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:28.720 align:start position:0%
can't be here
 
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
let one of us know so that we can make
 
00:08:35.509 --> 00:08:35.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:38.149 --> 00:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
have house leadership
 
00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
assign some
 
00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:41.750 align:start position:0%
assign some
substitutes

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
substitutes
 
00:08:43.269 --> 00:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
so that we'll be able to have a full
 
00:08:45.509 --> 00:08:45.519 align:start position:0%
complement of members to
 
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
before we get started this morning i
 
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
want to
 
00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
issue an apology to all members of the
 
00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
committee for a mistake that i have made
 
00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:00.720 align:start position:0%
over the course of the last few weeks
 
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
and that mistake is i have neglected to
 
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.230 align:start position:0%
and that mistake is i have neglected to
ask

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
ask
 
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
a member to retrieve the blue sheets
 
00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
in the back of the room
 
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
and report
 
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
at the end of each public hearing how
 
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
many people signed up for and or against
 
00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:09:22.389 --> 00:09:22.399 align:start position:0%
and so i apologize for that oversight
 
00:09:24.389 --> 00:09:24.399 align:start position:0%
and i will correct it today by making
 
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
sure that
 
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:26.550 align:start position:0%
sure that
uh

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
representative pimentel
 
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
retrieves those blue sheets and lets us
 
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
know who was in favor and who was
 
00:09:36.949 --> 00:09:36.959 align:start position:0%
opposed to a bill
 
00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
also before we start this morning i'll
 
00:09:40.949 --> 00:09:40.959 align:start position:0%
remind everyone that if you intend to
 
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
testify on a bill
 
00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
we need
 
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
a pink card
 
00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
otherwise we won't know that you intend
 
00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
to testify
 
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
and therefore we
 
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
won't call on you so please submit
 
00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
a pink card it's
 
00:09:59.269 --> 00:09:59.279 align:start position:0%
essential for record record keeping
 
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
after the public hearing as well as for
 
00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:09.269 --> 00:10:09.279 align:start position:0%
processing of the public hearing so that
 
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
we'll know who wants to speak and how
 
00:10:13.509 --> 00:10:13.519 align:start position:0%
much time to give each of those persons
 
00:10:15.269 --> 00:10:15.279 align:start position:0%
to speak
 
00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
i'd also remind
 
00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
people in the audience
 
00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
that if you do intend to speak
 
00:10:24.389 --> 00:10:24.399 align:start position:0%
you should maximize the time that you
 
00:10:26.069 --> 00:10:26.079 align:start position:0%
have to speak
 
00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
by not spending a lot of time
 
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
telling us about your background what
 
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
your credentials are
 
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
the best place to do that would be in an
 
00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
email to the committee rather than
 
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
taking up valuable testimony time by
 
00:10:42.949 --> 00:10:42.959 align:start position:0%
doing it here in front of us all so
 
00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:45.200 align:start position:0%
in the future
 
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
both today and
 
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
i'd urge you all to
 
00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
refrain from going into lengthy
 
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
descriptions of your background
 
00:10:59.110 --> 00:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
well we all appreciate your background
 
00:11:01.509 --> 00:11:01.519 align:start position:0%
it may not be the most appropriate way
 
00:11:01.519 --> 00:11:02.949 align:start position:0%
it may not be the most appropriate way
to

pounds of pfas emitted annually at 45
 
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
was based on
 
00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
a couple different reports that i had
 
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
read the state of michigan
 
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
state of new york and state of minnesota
 
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
had done studies regarding
 
00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:52.949 align:start position:0%
had done studies regarding
pfas

00:13:52.949 --> 00:13:52.959 align:start position:0%
pfas
 
00:13:54.949 --> 00:13:54.959 align:start position:0%
infiltrating the year and actually
 
00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:56.310 align:start position:0%
infiltrating the year and actually
quantifying

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
quantifying
 
00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:57.750 align:start position:0%
quantifying
um

00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:59.269 --> 00:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
the amount of
 
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
chemicals that per pounds are being
 
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
my word belched into the into the
 
00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
atmosphere that's how i arrived at
 
00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
45 pounds in in contrast the state of
 
00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
texas actually did a study
 
00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
and there they have a i don't think it's
 
00:14:16.949 --> 00:14:16.959 align:start position:0%
a regulation but they were looking at a
 
00:14:19.509 --> 00:14:19.519 align:start position:0%
advisory of 5 000 pounds
 
00:14:22.949 --> 00:14:22.959 align:start position:0%
annually of pfas that was being admitted
 
00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
specifically the the legislation targets
 
00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
short change p5 substances long chain
 
00:14:33.189 --> 00:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
precursor compounds in any new genex
 
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
chemical that is being created
 
00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
that's what the lsr was and that is the
 
00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
bill that is before you
 
00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:45.519 align:start position:0%
once the bill was drafted i received an
 
00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
email from kathy beam
 
00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
asking if i could sit down with des and
 
00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
talk about my bill and to be very candid
 
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
with you folks i'm very grateful
 
00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:58.240 align:start position:0%
to mike fitzgerald gary milbury craig
 
00:15:00.389 --> 00:15:00.399 align:start position:0%
wright and kathy beam for
 
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
talking to me about 1546 and explaining
 
00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:05.519 align:start position:0%
to me how
 
00:15:08.949 --> 00:15:08.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
it was not manageable from from a des
 
00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:13.509 align:start position:0%
it was not manageable from from a des
perspective

00:15:13.509 --> 00:15:13.519 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
we had a
 
00:15:17.269 --> 00:15:17.279 align:start position:0%
very cordial very frank dialogue
 
00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
regarding about air quality standards as
 
00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:22.240 align:start position:0%
it relates to pfas in new hampshire
 
00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
and kind of indicated to me that this
 
00:15:26.949 --> 00:15:26.959 align:start position:0%
was something that they could not in
 
00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
good faith um support
 
00:15:31.829 --> 00:15:31.839 align:start position:0%
so i asked them i said well is there
 
00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
something that i could offer
 
00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:36.160 align:start position:0%
that would begin
 
00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
to tackle
 
00:15:40.629 --> 00:15:40.639 align:start position:0%
air quality as it relates to pfas in the
 
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:43.590 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
um

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:46.069 --> 00:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
again i'm kathy beam is here today i'm
 
00:15:47.829 --> 00:15:47.839 align:start position:0%
very grateful to her and
 
00:15:47.839 --> 00:15:48.629 align:start position:0%
very grateful to her and
um

00:15:48.629 --> 00:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
i spoke with chairman vos and
 
00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
i actually have an amendment
 
00:15:55.509 --> 00:15:55.519 align:start position:0%
to my bill i'm basically throwing out
 
00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
the original language of my bill
 
00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
and i have new language
 
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
that would commence in 2023 january
 
00:16:04.629 --> 00:16:04.639 align:start position:0%
first of next year
 
00:16:06.829 --> 00:16:06.839 align:start position:0%
which gives latitude to ds and the
 
00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner to identify a study
 
00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
that's been conducted with generally
 
00:16:13.829 --> 00:16:13.839 align:start position:0%
accepted scientific principles that
 
00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
demonstrates an individual
 
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
pfas or profound chemical
 
00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
may cause acute chronic
 
00:16:23.509 --> 00:16:23.519 align:start position:0%
or developmental health effects as a
 
00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:27.680 align:start position:0%
result of inhalation exposure
 
00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
if the study exists in
 
00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:32.320 align:start position:0%
after appropriate evaluation by ds is
 
00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.269 align:start position:0%
after appropriate evaluation by ds is
done

00:16:33.269 --> 00:16:33.279 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
that they be given the added latitude to
 
00:16:38.069 --> 00:16:38.079 align:start position:0%
establish or modify that classification
 
00:16:40.389 --> 00:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
uh as it relates to ambient air limits
 
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh for this analyte but in
 
00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
adding that analyte into their rules of
 
00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:46.550 align:start position:0%
adding that analyte into their rules of
management

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
management
 
00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:47.509 align:start position:0%
management
so

00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to address the original bill
 
00:16:52.069 --> 00:16:52.079 align:start position:0%
but i'm really grateful

committee to consider thank you
 
00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:34.000 align:start position:0%

uh thank you chairman votes uh thank you

for taking my question uh representative
uh

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
did i understand you correctly in your
 
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
initial introduction that there are
 
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
several other states that have enacted
 
00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
legislation that their studies or their
 
00:17:53.669 --> 00:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
only studies i apologize they are
 
00:17:55.029 --> 00:17:55.039 align:start position:0%
studies that i read there were five
 
00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
studies that i read that talked about
 
00:17:59.590 --> 00:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
limiting and i apologize i should
 
00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
clarify that and thank you for allowing
 
00:18:03.029 --> 00:18:03.039 align:start position:0%
me to amplify that point there's studies
 
00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:04.799 align:start position:0%
that were done by those five states that
 
00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
i had read that was the genesis behind
 
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
my bill
 
00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you for the follow-up
 
00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
and so in your speak in your talks with
 
00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:14.630 align:start position:0%
and so in your speak in your talks with
des

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
des
 
00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
your original bill they said it was
 
00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
very unmanageable to
 
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
deal with poundage and in terms of that
 
00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
and so they're
 
00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
you're going to fashion
 
00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
your amendment to
 
00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
maybe be more like the other state's
 
00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.470 align:start position:0%
maybe be more like the other state's
studies

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
studies
 
00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:32.240 align:start position:0%
the short answer is yes but it's not to
 
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
be like the other states new hampshire
 
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
is its own state and new hampshire can
 
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
decide what they feel is appropriate in
 
00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
terms of how the state so
 
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
i'll let
 
00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
kathy um she's here today
 
00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
um to talk about
 
00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
where the department stands but
 
00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:50.480 align:start position:0%
unmanageable is my word that was
 
00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:52.640 align:start position:0%
i i like to simplify things as as much
 
00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
as possible that's how that was the word
 
00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
that i took away from my conversation
 
00:18:57.990 --> 00:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
with them and it's in honestly it's a
 
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:00.640 align:start position:0%
good word it allowed for a lot for me to
 
00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
circle back and provide
 
00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh alternative language for the
 
00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
committee's consideration for enactment
 
00:19:09.029 --> 00:19:09.039 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:12.160 align:start position:0%
okay by the way before i uh
 
00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
recognize someone for further questions
 
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
did everybody get a copy of the proposed
 
00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:18.070 align:start position:0%
did everybody get a copy of the proposed
amendment

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
if not
 
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
raise your hand
 
00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:33.669 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:19:33.669 --> 00:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:19:33.679 --> 00:19:35.590 align:start position:0%
okay
apparently

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
apparently
 
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
everyone has
 
00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
received 20. actually
 
00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
one stuck together representative
 
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
okay representative callie pitts is
 
00:19:46.549 --> 00:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
 
00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative floyd uh
 
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
i i have a couple of questions
 
00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
portsmouth and i'll ask the first in
 
00:19:55.909 --> 00:19:55.919 align:start position:0%
portsmouth itself is having pfas
 
00:19:55.919 --> 00:19:56.870 align:start position:0%
portsmouth itself is having pfas
problems

00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
problems
 
00:19:58.470 --> 00:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
and one of the problems that we're
 
00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:00.559 align:start position:0%
having is with the turf
 
00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
and of course that's an emission and
 
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
what we
 
00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
what we
 
00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
what has been determined
 
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
is that it is very difficult
 
00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
to quantify what's in the air so
 
00:20:15.909 --> 00:20:15.919 align:start position:0%
and that's that's going on right now we
 
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
haven't got the results of studies and
 
00:20:20.549 --> 00:20:20.559 align:start position:0%
that's going on right now would you i
 
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
see the amendment would you um
 
00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:26.870 align:start position:0%
see the amendment would you um
consider

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
consider
 
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
rather than an amendment which the
 
00:20:31.909 --> 00:20:31.919 align:start position:0%
committee has to introduce
 
00:20:34.789 --> 00:20:34.799 align:start position:0%
a commission to study this
 
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
again there are studies going on around
 
00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
the state i understand merrimack's
 
00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:40.640 align:start position:0%
problem portsmouth had its own problem
 
00:20:42.549 --> 00:20:42.559 align:start position:0%
cochlear landfill there's all kinds of
 
00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
things and pfas is everywhere
 
00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
everything we touch almost has some sort
 
00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
of pfas in it but it's not all
 
00:20:53.909 --> 00:20:53.919 align:start position:0%
what i'm told dangerous and
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
the jury's out
 
00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:56.870 align:start position:0%
the jury's out
so

00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:20:59.669 --> 00:20:59.679 align:start position:0%
would you uh
 
00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
want to change this to a commission
 
00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:03.669 align:start position:0%
want to change this to a commission
yes

00:21:03.669 --> 00:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
if that's the will of the committee yes
 
00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying would you agree with
 
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
that that it needs to be studied more
 
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
especially quantification
 
00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
everything that in representative cali
 
00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:14.549 align:start position:0%
everything that in representative cali
pets

00:21:14.549 --> 00:21:14.559 align:start position:0%
pets
 
00:21:17.029 --> 00:21:17.039 align:start position:0%
portsmouth and merrimack have been
 
00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
at the forefront
 
00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
of being impacted
 
00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:21.110 align:start position:0%
of being impacted
by

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
the flowers whether it be in in the soil
 
00:21:26.789 --> 00:21:26.799 align:start position:0%
or in or in our water and
 
00:21:26.799 --> 00:21:27.669 align:start position:0%
or in or in our water and
i'm

00:21:27.669 --> 00:21:27.679 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
i think we're all intimately aware of
 
00:21:31.029 --> 00:21:31.039 align:start position:0%
what you know what's going on with the
 
00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
coakley landfill i think new hampshire
 
00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
is uniquely positioned to take the lead
 
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
nationally on this issue if we begin
 
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
having the conversation the conversation
 
00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
needs to happen now it can't be for
 
00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
my grandkids grandkids and it can't be
 
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
for your grandkids great grandkids
 
00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
representative okay we need to start
 
00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
having the conversation now if it means
 
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
creating a commission so that we can
 
00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
work with our partners at des to begin
 
00:21:58.470 --> 00:21:58.480 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
00:22:00.789 --> 00:22:00.799 align:start position:0%
how how the analytes are impacting air
 
00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
quality and coming up with some real
 
00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
scientific data so that this state can
 
00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
begin to take steps
 
00:22:08.549 --> 00:22:08.559 align:start position:0%
uh as it relates to air quality then
 
00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely i would i would i would
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
embrace that so whatever whatever the
 
00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
direction the committee wants to go with
 
00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
my bill i would be grateful to begin the
 
00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
conversation with anything follow up
 
00:22:22.149 --> 00:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
i would like to follow up with a point
 
00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
and i i understand about saint gobain
 
00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:31.029 --> 00:22:31.039 align:start position:0%
coakley and what happened at pease with
 
00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
the wells at peace what i
 
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
what what recently case
 
00:22:38.549 --> 00:22:38.559 align:start position:0%
was that children playing on an
 
00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
artificial turf field are also breathing
 
00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:41.909 align:start position:0%
artificial turf field are also breathing
in

00:22:41.909 --> 00:22:41.919 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:22:43.669 --> 00:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
these chemicals
 
00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
and have you
 
00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
not only industrial emissions but those
 
00:22:50.549 --> 00:22:50.559 align:start position:0%
types of emissions and have you come
 
00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
across that at all in any of your
 
00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
studies or reading or talking to people
 
00:23:01.029 --> 00:23:01.039 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much for the question
 
00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
this is kind of
 
00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
for me personally
 
00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
hearkening back to my days on the town
 
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
council has nothing
 
00:23:08.549 --> 00:23:08.559 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:23:08.559 --> 00:23:09.350 align:start position:0%
to do
with

00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
pfas per se
 
00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
but merrimack has a brownfield that
 
00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
is currently being managed by the epa i
 
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
believe and they wanted to give us this
 
00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
brownfield to put a soccer field on and
 
00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
i absolutely said no because once you
 
00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
break the cap of that brownfield and
 
00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:28.559 align:start position:0%
that begins to leech then you are
 
00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
potentially exposing whatever was in
 
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
that particular brownfield um
 
00:23:34.549 --> 00:23:34.559 align:start position:0%
you know i mean there's a reason why
 
00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
there's a captive there's a reason why
 
00:23:38.789 --> 00:23:38.799 align:start position:0%
it's it's a field it's probably
 
00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
you know we've we have you know we're
 
00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
very lucky that we have another
 
00:23:44.549 --> 00:23:44.559 align:start position:0%
part in town that we were able to
 
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
remediate and it's actually a passive
 
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
parking town
 
00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:49.110 align:start position:0%
parking town
so

00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
circling back to
 
00:23:52.149 --> 00:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
the the other brownfield
 
00:23:53.029 --> 00:23:53.039 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
once that cap is broken it it
 
00:23:58.230 --> 00:23:58.240 align:start position:0%
potentially can impact the community um
 
00:23:58.240 --> 00:23:59.430 align:start position:0%
potentially can impact the community um
so

00:23:59.430 --> 00:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:24:01.029 --> 00:24:01.039 align:start position:0%
very mindful
 
00:24:01.039 --> 00:24:02.630 align:start position:0%
very mindful
of

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:05.200 align:start position:0%
of the exposure that that's that's
 
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
involved so while it doesn't relate to
 
00:24:10.549 --> 00:24:10.559 align:start position:0%
pfas per se it i certainly can
 
00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
anecdotally relate to
 
00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:14.230 align:start position:0%
anecdotally relate to
being

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
having kids being exposed thank you
 
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
you're welcome thank you uh
 
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee is recognized for a
 
00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
question thank you mr chairman and thank
 
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
you representative boyd for bringing
 
00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:25.990 align:start position:0%
this bill
um

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
my question is the bill is exclusively
 
00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
about about um
 
00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
pfos in the air
 
00:24:36.789 --> 00:24:36.799 align:start position:0%
and i know that um considerations i live
 
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
near merrimack i'm pretty aware the
 
00:24:40.549 --> 00:24:40.559 align:start position:0%
water warriors work and the
 
00:24:42.789 --> 00:24:42.799 align:start position:0%
um the issues that you've undergone in
 
00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
terms of people's private wells you know
 
00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
they're on uh
 
00:24:48.549 --> 00:24:48.559 align:start position:0%
they're on bottled water now many of
 
00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
them still
 
00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
because of the contamination there but i
 
00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:54.320 align:start position:0%
think since you've read all these
 
00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
when these chemicals are in the air
 
00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:04.240 align:start position:0%
uh what else do they tend to contaminate
 
00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
in other words the concern would be not
 
00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
just that you would be breathing the
 
00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
particles in from the air and the
 
00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:10.720 align:start position:0%
percentage of
 
00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
pifoas that you might you know end up in
 
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
in your lungs or whatever from from the
 
00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
air but that that that air acts as a
 
00:25:21.269 --> 00:25:21.279 align:start position:0%
current that allows it to drift and
 
00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
contaminate other things in the
 
00:25:24.549 --> 00:25:24.559 align:start position:0%
community right so that your your
 
00:25:24.559 --> 00:25:26.070 align:start position:0%
community right so that your your
environment

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
environment
 
00:25:28.149 --> 00:25:28.159 align:start position:0%
it's very hard to gauge how much of your
 
00:25:29.909 --> 00:25:29.919 align:start position:0%
environment would be contaminated is
 
00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
that correct or that is correct what i
 
00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
would say to you
 
00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:35.110 align:start position:0%
would say to you
anecdotally

00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
anecdotally
 
00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
as it relates to
 
00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
my company in town
 
00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:42.149 align:start position:0%
my company in town
when

00:25:42.149 --> 00:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
pfas was belching into the atmosphere
 
00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:46.470 align:start position:0%
pfas was belching into the atmosphere
unregulated

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
unregulated
 
00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
um if you
 
00:25:50.789 --> 00:25:50.799 align:start position:0%
look at and i forget the na i want to
 
00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:52.240 align:start position:0%
say it's the goal of report i think i
 
00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:54.400 align:start position:0%
think that's the what
 
00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
ultimately came out of the decree
 
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
between saint gobain and ds i think it's
 
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
the golden report when they created that
 
00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
circumference that radius went from a
 
00:26:05.909 --> 00:26:05.919 align:start position:0%
half mile to a mile
 
00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
pfas was not being carried
 
00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
downwind in in out to sea to use a
 
00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
fishing reference it was dropping like a
 
00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
lead sinker and it dropped it dropped on
 
00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
wells four and five it dropped in
 
00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
litchfield it dropped in londonderry
 
00:26:25.029 --> 00:26:25.039 align:start position:0%
um and and that's where
 
00:26:27.029 --> 00:26:27.039 align:start position:0%
um because going from the from the
 
00:26:29.029 --> 00:26:29.039 align:start position:0%
northwest to the southeast that's how
 
00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
the winds tend to prevail in that part
 
00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
of town it makes perfect sense where
 
00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:34.230 align:start position:0%
of town it makes perfect sense where
where

00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:34.240 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
where the pollutants you know impacted
 
00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
those water sources
 
00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
so if you accept if you accept that that
 
00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
it's dropping like a lead snicker you
 
00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
know you've got you've got fit you've
 
00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:46.400 align:start position:0%
got fish that are in the merrimack river
 
00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
you've got
 
00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
the merrimack river that now is a result
 
00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
of on another commission that i belong
 
00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:53.190 align:start position:0%
of on another commission that i belong
to

00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:54.070 align:start position:0%
to
um

00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:55.909 --> 00:26:55.919 align:start position:0%
we appropriated monies to penetrate to
 
00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
put a pump in the merrimack river to
 
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
provide an ancillary water source to not
 
00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
only supplement gun check utilities uh
 
00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
in in nashua in merrimack but also for
 
00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
for the new for their new customers in
 
00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
in litchfield you know when it's
 
00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:11.360 align:start position:0%
dropping in there and it was being
 
00:27:13.909 --> 00:27:13.919 align:start position:0%
pumped in they're going in unfiltrated
 
00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
thankfully you know a lot of the water i
 
00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
think the water concern is relatively
 
00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
um address based on what mvd and what
 
00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
pentachuck is doing to remediate that
 
00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
specific situation
 
00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
so long as san gobain is
 
00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:32.720 align:start position:0%
has their rto online and it's cleaning
 
00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
the pollutants out of the air i think
 
00:27:37.669 --> 00:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
there is a relative assurance
 
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
that people can have relative not
 
00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
complete but a relative
 
00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:44.230 align:start position:0%
complete but a relative
assurance

00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
assurance
 
00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
that you know sango bain
 
00:27:49.669 --> 00:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
is being compliant but as we've seen
 
00:27:51.269 --> 00:27:51.279 align:start position:0%
they've they just had a
 
00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
notice of deficiency letter issued by
 
00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
san gobain because they took that
 
00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
offline so
 
00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
you you never know when this company is
 
00:27:59.110 --> 00:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
going to have to take that rto offline
 
00:28:01.269 --> 00:28:01.279 align:start position:0%
that's the potential could impact people
 
00:28:02.789 --> 00:28:02.799 align:start position:0%
downstream so
 
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
coming full circle to what you are
 
00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:05.350 align:start position:0%
coming full circle to what you are
saying

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
saying
 
00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
yes there is the if if that is if if
 
00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:10.240 align:start position:0%
saying go being baited and that stuff
 
00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
gets it's it's going to go downstream
 
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
and it could it it may not impact
 
00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
the drinking water per se as it relates
 
00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:20.240 align:start position:0%
to mvd or penetrate based on the
 
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
precautions and the filtration that
 
00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
they've put in but you know if we're
 
00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:26.240 align:start position:0%
talking wildlife if we're talking you
 
00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
know eating the fish from the merrimack
 
00:28:31.029 --> 00:28:31.039 align:start position:0%
this certainly could be uh based on some
 
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
of the stuff that i've read and in
 
00:28:34.789 --> 00:28:34.799 align:start position:0%
conversations that i've had with members
 
00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
in my community that have been very
 
00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
adept um at this issue from the onset
 
00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:40.720 align:start position:0%
you know they're they're certainly
 
00:28:42.789 --> 00:28:42.799 align:start position:0%
long-term health risks to consider
 
00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up
 
00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
and uh the other question i would ask is
 
00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
i spoke with
 
00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
um commissioner scott
 
00:28:53.269 --> 00:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
in just in the hallway
 
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
not too long ago and he mentioned the
 
00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:56.480 align:start position:0%
fact that there were federal dollars
 
00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
coming that were going to be assisting
 
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
with water cleanup in the state
 
00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
um i don't know if that's the are for
 
00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
money or infrastructure money but i
 
00:29:06.389 --> 00:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
think there was about a hundred million
 
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
dollars that was coming to des water
 
00:29:12.389 --> 00:29:12.399 align:start position:0%
uh that's my understanding yeah so so do
 
00:29:14.389 --> 00:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
you have any understanding of whether or
 
00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
not there will be additional cleanup
 
00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
efforts in terms of being able to
 
00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
protect the water supplies because i
 
00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
think that's what that was targeted for
 
00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
short answer short answer is no i just i
 
00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
know i know money is coming i just don't
 
00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
know how it's going to be
 
00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:28.950 align:start position:0%
know how it's going to be
distributed

00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
distributed
 
00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
throughout the state
 
00:29:32.549 --> 00:29:32.559 align:start position:0%
okay thank you no thank you
 
00:29:34.389 --> 00:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
representative plett is recognized for a
 
00:29:34.399 --> 00:29:39.430 align:start position:0%
representative plett is recognized for a
question

00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
this is a clerk question what is an rto
 
00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:45.200 align:start position:0%
an rto
 
00:29:46.389 --> 00:29:46.399 align:start position:0%
do you do you have pencil and paper
 
00:29:46.399 --> 00:29:47.750 align:start position:0%
do you do you have pencil and paper
ready

00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
ready
 
00:29:49.269 --> 00:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
mr clerk
 
00:29:54.149 --> 00:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:54.159 --> 00:29:56.549 align:start position:0%
 
thermal

00:29:56.549 --> 00:29:56.559 align:start position:0%
thermal
 
00:29:56.559 --> 00:29:58.149 align:start position:0%
thermal
oxidizer

00:29:58.149 --> 00:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
oxidizer
 
00:29:59.590 --> 00:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
so when
 
00:30:02.549 --> 00:30:02.559 align:start position:0%
san gobain is manufacturing a product
 
00:30:05.029 --> 00:30:05.039 align:start position:0%
and thank you you're welcome if i could
 
00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
amplify the point mr chairman yes please
 
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
do thank you just for
 
00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
to educate people they don't know over a
 
00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
regenerative thermal oxidizer or rto
 
00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
when san gomez making a product and
 
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
they're using
 
00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
um perforas on their product it
 
00:30:21.029 --> 00:30:21.039 align:start position:0%
generally gets baked and once it's baked
 
00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
it goes into it's prepares to go out
 
00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
this oxidizer covers the smoke stack and
 
00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:28.640 align:start position:0%
it actually burns
 
00:30:30.389 --> 00:30:30.399 align:start position:0%
it burns that pea floss right inside the
 
00:30:32.149 --> 00:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
smokestack so that when
 
00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:34.240 align:start position:0%
what goes out of the smokestack is
 
00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
relatively clean of of pfoas and
 
00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
i think that the temperature gets up to
 
00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:42.640 align:start position:0%
1200 degrees or 1500 degrees i mean it's
 
00:30:44.789 --> 00:30:44.799 align:start position:0%
it's scorching it's scorching what they
 
00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:46.240 align:start position:0%
need to do to burn that off so that's
 
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
that's what an rto does
 
00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative samsich is
 
00:30:54.549 --> 00:30:54.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
00:30:59.269 --> 00:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
representative boyd i think it's a very
 
00:31:01.509 --> 00:31:01.519 align:start position:0%
important bill that she brought to us
 
00:31:01.519 --> 00:31:03.029 align:start position:0%
important bill that she brought to us
today

00:31:03.029 --> 00:31:03.039 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:31:05.509 --> 00:31:05.519 align:start position:0%
i was a little um
 
00:31:07.269 --> 00:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
taken aback by the fact that you
 
00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned a absolute quantity of 45
 
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:10.950 align:start position:0%
mentioned a absolute quantity of 45
pounds

00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
pounds
 
00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
but you didn't say whether that was
 
00:31:14.789 --> 00:31:14.799 align:start position:0%
per year
 
00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
per state per site
 
00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh i assumed you
 
00:31:21.509 --> 00:31:21.519 align:start position:0%
know like this was annually from the
 
00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
whole state
 
00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
45 pounds annually is for the whole
 
00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire that's correct
 
00:31:27.909 --> 00:31:27.919 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:31:30.789 --> 00:31:30.799 align:start position:0%
thanks for for clarifying that uh but i
 
00:31:33.909 --> 00:31:33.919 align:start position:0%
also want to uh mention that because
 
00:31:37.029 --> 00:31:37.039 align:start position:0%
because i saw that i thought well um you
 
00:31:39.029 --> 00:31:39.039 align:start position:0%
know we started out with the issue of
 
00:31:41.669 --> 00:31:41.679 align:start position:0%
water quality and water pollution now
 
00:31:43.669 --> 00:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
we're getting into the air and air
 
00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:46.240 align:start position:0%
emissions and as representative kelly
 
00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:48.149 align:start position:0%
emissions and as representative kelly
smith

00:31:48.149 --> 00:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
smith
 
00:31:50.789 --> 00:31:50.799 align:start position:0%
pitts mentioned uh in portsmouth now we
 
00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
have this issue of a a sports athletic
 
00:31:57.269 --> 00:31:57.279 align:start position:0%
field that was promised to be non-pfas
 
00:31:58.630 --> 00:31:58.640 align:start position:0%
which now
 
00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
is maybe not
 
00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:04.240 align:start position:0%
non-pfas and so this could happen to
 
00:32:06.549 --> 00:32:06.559 align:start position:0%
other communities as well and we don't
 
00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
know how much emission there is and the
 
00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:10.389 align:start position:0%
know how much emission there is and the
fact

00:32:10.389 --> 00:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
fact
 
00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
don't you agree that the
 
00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
health effects in general are just not
 
00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
known i mean i'm i'm in the pfas study
 
00:32:19.909 --> 00:32:19.919 align:start position:0%
in peace as a placebo group but it's
 
00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
being done because there are no health
 
00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
studies yet that are conclusive about
 
00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:24.549 align:start position:0%
studies yet that are conclusive about
this

00:32:24.549 --> 00:32:24.559 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:32:26.549 --> 00:32:26.559 align:start position:0%
have you run into any more studies that
 
00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
are more conclusive about either water
 
00:32:29.669 --> 00:32:29.679 align:start position:0%
or air
 
00:32:31.029 --> 00:32:31.039 align:start position:0%
so there's a couple commissions right
 
00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
now that are that are addressing the
 
00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
health of health effects
 
00:32:36.149 --> 00:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
um department of health insert health
 
00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
and human services
 
00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
had a
 
00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
zoom call last week i think it was
 
00:32:44.149 --> 00:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
either wednesday or thursday last week
 
00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
that talked about
 
00:32:49.509 --> 00:32:49.519 align:start position:0%
um elevated levels of cancer
 
00:32:49.519 --> 00:32:50.870 align:start position:0%
um elevated levels of cancer
specif

00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
specif
 
00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:52.240 align:start position:0%
now i'm drawing a total blank in front
 
00:32:53.509 --> 00:32:53.519 align:start position:0%
of the committee what kind of cancer it
 
00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
was there was an uptick
 
00:32:58.230 --> 00:32:58.240 align:start position:0%
in the specific kind of cancers in the
 
00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:59.590 align:start position:0%
in the specific kind of cancers in the
um

00:32:59.590 --> 00:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
was that in the merrimack area in the
 
00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
merrimack area that is correct and the
 
00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:04.720 align:start position:0%
the question
 
00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
that they knew was going to be asked and
 
00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
they had already addressed it you know
 
00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:09.440 align:start position:0%
is is any of the upticks related to san
 
00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:10.549 align:start position:0%
is is any of the upticks related to san
gobain

00:33:10.549 --> 00:33:10.559 align:start position:0%
gobain
 
00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
and department of health and human
 
00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
services responded we don't know
 
00:33:17.029 --> 00:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
so yes we we don't know what the
 
00:33:17.039 --> 00:33:18.230 align:start position:0%
so yes we we don't know what the
long-term

00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
long-term
 
00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
health impacts are as they relate to
 
00:33:25.669 --> 00:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
a pregnant woman you know comorbidities
 
00:33:27.909 --> 00:33:27.919 align:start position:0%
chronic medical condition cancer we we
 
00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:29.200 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
00:33:30.789 --> 00:33:30.799 align:start position:0%
the the either the short-term or the
 
00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
long-term effects
 
00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
as as it relates to pfas but
 
00:33:36.789 --> 00:33:36.799 align:start position:0%
new hampshire thankfully has a couple we
 
00:33:38.789 --> 00:33:38.799 align:start position:0%
have a couple studies as a consequence
 
00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
of what happened with with merrimack
 
00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
beginning to analyze data as it relates
 
00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:45.350 align:start position:0%
beginning to analyze data as it relates
to

00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
health impacts
 
00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
with with pfas
 
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
okay uh you've already asked a couple of
 
00:33:53.669 --> 00:33:53.679 align:start position:0%
questions so i'll circle back to you
 
00:33:55.509 --> 00:33:55.519 align:start position:0%
later after everyone else has had an
 
00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity and i'll recognize
 
00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
representative bernardi for a question
 
00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh
 
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
representative boyd you mentioned uh
 
00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
five states that are doing studies is
 
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
the epa engaged in this at all to your
 
00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:12.629 align:start position:0%
the epa engaged in this at all to your
knowledge

00:34:12.629 --> 00:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
knowledge
 
00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:15.919 align:start position:0%
my uh the showing answer would would be
 
00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
i think so
 
00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
based on some of the things that i've
 
00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
that i've researched on i think so i did
 
00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:21.829 align:start position:0%
that i've researched on i think so i did
not

00:34:21.829 --> 00:34:21.839 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
specifically look at the epa i wanted to
 
00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
see what individual states were doing on
 
00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
their own level because i feel if new
 
00:34:29.349 --> 00:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire is going to take the lead if
 
00:34:30.869 --> 00:34:30.879 align:start position:0%
we're going to be independent from
 
00:34:30.879 --> 00:34:32.310 align:start position:0%
we're going to be independent from
because

00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:34:34.869 --> 00:34:34.879 align:start position:0%
i'm going to speak i apologize mr
 
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
chairman you know
 
00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
i have more confidence in what we do as
 
00:34:41.349 --> 00:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
a state than what the epa
 
00:34:41.359 --> 00:34:42.149 align:start position:0%
a state than what the epa
does

00:34:42.149 --> 00:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:34:44.950 --> 00:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
part of mine relates to another issue
 
00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:45.919 align:start position:0%
that has
 
00:34:45.919 --> 00:34:47.510 align:start position:0%
that has
impacted

00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
impacted
 
00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:48.710 align:start position:0%
impacted
basically

00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
storm water issues in my community and
 
00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:52.399 align:start position:0%
other communities south of new hampshire
 
00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
i'm not happy with how the
 
00:34:56.950 --> 00:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
eba handled it and based on that i don't
 
00:34:58.790 --> 00:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
have a level of trust that that they
 
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
might get it right or they might not get
 
00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:02.720 align:start position:0%
it right i have confidence
 
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
in our state and the people that serve
 
00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:06.880 align:start position:0%
at des that they can help us with this
 
00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
and begin to take the necessary first
 
00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
steps to to tackle the issue
 
00:35:13.349 --> 00:35:13.359 align:start position:0%
thank you not sure if that answers your
 
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
question but thank you thank you
 
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
representative okay thank you uh
 
00:35:19.589 --> 00:35:19.599 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chairman and happy birthday
 
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for taking the
 
00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
question representative notter thank you
 
00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
very much for reminding me i'm 53 years
 
00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
young so
 
00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
um first i want to thank you for all the
 
00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
work that you've done on the town
 
00:35:33.109 --> 00:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
council since the start of this whole
 
00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
ugly pfas issue i also don't want to
 
00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
forget um our late speaker dick hinch
 
00:35:40.069 --> 00:35:40.079 align:start position:0%
who was working behind the scenes as
 
00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
well as in the house without any media
 
00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:44.630 align:start position:0%
well as in the house without any media
kudos

00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
kudos
 
00:35:46.069 --> 00:35:46.079 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
00:35:48.069 --> 00:35:48.079 align:start position:0%
with so many commissions already would
 
00:35:50.069 --> 00:35:50.079 align:start position:0%
it be better to just consolidate them
 
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
all into one commission to handle
 
00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
everything air
 
00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
soil water
 
00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:02.150 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:03.349 align:start position:0%
the
[Music]

00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
conservative in me would answer yes
 
00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:08.470 align:start position:0%
conservative in me would answer yes
the

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:09.750 align:start position:0%
the
pragmatic

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
pragmatic
 
00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:11.270 align:start position:0%
pragmatic
logical

00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
logical
 
00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
person in me would say
 
00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
no because
 
00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
if you mix air soil and water
 
00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
it will take
 
00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:25.510 align:start position:0%
it will take
a

00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:36:27.829 --> 00:36:27.839 align:start position:0%
longer period of time
 
00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
to arrive
 
00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
at the appropriate analysis as what
 
00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
would need to be done for all three
 
00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
i think if you target the three
 
00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:39.750 align:start position:0%
i think if you target the three
individual

00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
and you specifically give them focus
 
00:36:45.109 --> 00:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
as it relates to
 
00:36:47.589 --> 00:36:47.599 align:start position:0%
the toxicity that it does to that
 
00:36:49.109 --> 00:36:49.119 align:start position:0%
particular mineral
 
00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
the short-term and the long-term impacts
 
00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
as it relates
 
00:36:55.349 --> 00:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
you know to to humans and and animals
 
00:36:57.829 --> 00:36:57.839 align:start position:0%
and in in in the agricultural piece you
 
00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
know because
 
00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
that there is there is a relation there
 
00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
as well i think
 
00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
and and you say you might have some
 
00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
crossover with some people participating
 
00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:10.720 align:start position:0%
in one participating the other because
 
00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
you know they're amped up to a new level
 
00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
of ampedness of wanting to to solve the
 
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:16.720 align:start position:0%
problem and i certainly respect that but
 
00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
if you have in you know three different
 
00:37:20.069 --> 00:37:20.079 align:start position:0%
commissions with all sorts of different
 
00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:22.640 align:start position:0%
individuals working collectively on each
 
00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
individual topic
 
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
i think you're able to get to get to
 
00:37:32.069 --> 00:37:32.079 align:start position:0%
a solution and a direction more quicker
 
00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
than as opposed to commingling all into
 
00:37:37.109 --> 00:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
one big large commission and i also you
 
00:37:39.349 --> 00:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
know quite honestly i would think that a
 
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
large commission
 
00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
handling those three it could become
 
00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
from my perspective i think it would be
 
00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:45.589 align:start position:0%
from my perspective i think it would be
unwieldy

00:37:45.589 --> 00:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
unwieldy
 
00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
i like the three and candidly i like the
 
00:37:49.109 --> 00:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
three independent
 
00:37:51.109 --> 00:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
commissions and if each commission can
 
00:37:53.349 --> 00:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
have the latitude that they want to do a
 
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
subgroup or a subcommittee on a
 
00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:57.200 align:start position:0%
particular topic you know they certainly
 
00:37:59.109 --> 00:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
have the latitude to do that
 
00:38:01.349 --> 00:38:01.359 align:start position:0%
thank you follow up yes thank you mr
 
00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
chairman um i feel like we've been just
 
00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
fighting this whole pfas issue for
 
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
several terms now could you just remind
 
00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
us all when this all started what year
 
00:38:11.349 --> 00:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
it was now you're testing me on that
 
00:38:11.359 --> 00:38:12.950 align:start position:0%
it was now you're testing me on that
representative

00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:17.440 align:start position:0%
uh i want to say it is 2016
 
00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:20.310 align:start position:0%
uh i want to say it is 2016
when

00:38:20.310 --> 00:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
san gobain was testing drinking water at
 
00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
their plant and they actually uncovered
 
00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
the issue
 
00:38:27.829 --> 00:38:27.839 align:start position:0%
i mean our full disclosure they
 
00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:29.200 align:start position:0%
uncovered the issue
 
00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
des had a meeting with merrimack and and
 
00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
that's when the community was notified
 
00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:36.320 align:start position:0%
by des that san gobain had disclosed
 
00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
that there was there were there were
 
00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
pollutants in the drinking water
 
00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:40.790 align:start position:0%
pollutants in the drinking water
and

00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:43.040 align:start position:0%

okay thank you
 
00:38:51.349 --> 00:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
before we ask any more questions i would
 
00:38:53.349 --> 00:38:53.359 align:start position:0%
remind anybody who would like to speak
 
00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
that we need to see
 
00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
a pink card to identify you
 
00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
are there any more questions from the
 
00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:04.960 align:start position:0%

represent boyd um
 
00:39:11.109 --> 00:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
i just wondered whether uh during your
 
00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:12.320 align:start position:0%
your uh
 
00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:14.720 align:start position:0%
time trying to get a handle on this
 
00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:15.670 align:start position:0%
time trying to get a handle on this
issue

00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
whether you also considered
 
00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:20.720 align:start position:0%
the various uh fire departments national
 
00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
guard sites that could be using
 
00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
firefighting foams as we know befose are
 
00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
connected directly to p to firefighting
 
00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:29.270 align:start position:0%
connected directly to p to firefighting
foams

00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
foams
 
00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
at the piezer air base initially but
 
00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
those are also sites that could be
 
00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
sources both for
 
00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
ground or intermission pfas
 
00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question the short
 
00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
answer is we we have a fire department
 
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
we don't have any other units that are
 
00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:47.200 align:start position:0%
on site like like in that like like a
 
00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
national guard unit or an armory in in
 
00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:51.589 align:start position:0%
national guard unit or an armory in in
merrimack

00:39:51.589 --> 00:39:51.599 align:start position:0%
merrimack
 
00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
i want to say and again i'm trying to
 
00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
draw back on my 10 years of serving on
 
00:39:58.150 --> 00:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
the town council and numerous
 
00:39:59.750 --> 00:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
conversations with the fire department i
 
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
know at one particular point that they
 
00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
had foam that did have pfos i know that
 
00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
they have migrated to a particular foam
 
00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
that does not contain pfos now when
 
00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:12.640 align:start position:0%
that transition occurred i i don't know
 
00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:14.720 align:start position:0%
the answer to your question but i i know
 
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
that the fire department has has
 
00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:18.230 align:start position:0%
that the fire department has has
eliminated

00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
eliminated
 
00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
i shouldn't say limited they have
 
00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
removed the pfas firefighting phone from
 
00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
the list of equipment that firefighters
 
00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
are trained to use when pointing out a
 
00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.670 align:start position:0%
are trained to use when pointing out a
fire

00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:32.069 --> 00:40:32.079 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any more questions from
 
00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:34.720 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts
 
00:40:42.309 --> 00:40:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
this is a public hearing and the public
 
00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
is involved and not everybody
 
00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:52.309 --> 00:40:52.319 align:start position:0%
snuff on all the issues that's the best
 
00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
way i can put it
 
00:40:56.309 --> 00:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
uh pfas is a very would you agree that
 
00:40:59.270 --> 00:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
pfas is a very complicated issue
 
00:41:02.790 --> 00:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
and that pfas that
 
00:41:05.349 --> 00:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
that's around us all it's in implants
 
00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
it's in it's in plants matter of fact in
 
00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
portsmouth they're saying well maybe
 
00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
it's not the turf it could be the walnut
 
00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:12.710 align:start position:0%
it's not the turf it could be the walnut
shells

00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
shells
 
00:41:15.589 --> 00:41:15.599 align:start position:0%
you mentioned agriculture that this is
 
00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
something that really needs to be
 
00:41:21.589 --> 00:41:21.599 align:start position:0%
defined and that not every
 
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
quote unquote
 
00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:24.390 align:start position:0%
quote unquote
pfas

00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
pfas
 
00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
could be carcinogen and i believe that
 
00:41:29.109 --> 00:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
one of our colleagues on the other side
 
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
of the wall
 
00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
i don't know if i'm allowed to mention
 
00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:34.720 align:start position:0%
that person but studied the
 
00:41:37.109 --> 00:41:37.119 align:start position:0%
is studying or in involved in studying
 
00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
the cancer cluster in the seacoast so
 
00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
that this is a very complicated issue
 
00:41:43.109 --> 00:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
and that
 
00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
general umbrella of pfas
 
00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
really has to be broken out into
 
00:41:50.309 --> 00:41:50.319 align:start position:0%
elements and it needs more study i don't
 
00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
know if
 
00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
if that's what you would envision a
 
00:41:56.470 --> 00:41:56.480 align:start position:0%
commission doing but that's what i would
 
00:41:58.470 --> 00:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
envision a commission doing
 
00:42:00.069 --> 00:42:00.079 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
putting back all the information that's
 
00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
going on all around which local people
 
00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
have been doing with the cooperation of
 
00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
the state and
 
00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
different manufacturers so
 
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
anywhere near what you would consider a
 
00:42:24.069 --> 00:42:24.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:24.079 --> 00:42:25.589 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:42:25.589 --> 00:42:25.599 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
pfas is very complicated
 
00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
i don't disagree i don't disagree with
 
00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
you on that
 
00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:32.950 align:start position:0%
you on that
um

00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:35.589 --> 00:42:35.599 align:start position:0%
if somebody can show me
 
00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
a phos chemical that is not carcinogenic
 
00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
i i think we we would all like to would
 
00:42:45.109 --> 00:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
all like to to see that and see the data
 
00:42:47.109 --> 00:42:47.119 align:start position:0%
that that would support that particular
 
00:42:50.069 --> 00:42:50.079 align:start position:0%
chemical as not being carcinogenic
 
00:42:53.589 --> 00:42:53.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
i'm targeting
 
00:42:56.550 --> 00:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
air quality
 
00:42:59.829 --> 00:42:59.839 align:start position:0%
and i'm hoping that a commission
 
00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
if if that is the will of this committee
 
00:43:06.309 --> 00:43:06.319 align:start position:0%
to embark on a commission to
 
00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
focus on p fox and air quality i think
 
00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
that is a necessary first step because
 
00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
then you get because in the context of
 
00:43:16.150 --> 00:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
having that conversation
 
00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
as i alluded to in my original testimony
 
00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:21.510 align:start position:0%
as i alluded to in my original testimony
um

00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:23.829 align:start position:0%
um
inhalation

00:43:23.829 --> 00:43:23.839 align:start position:0%
inhalation
 
00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
is is you know
 
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
can't even begin to to to
 
00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
emphasize that you know when you know
 
00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
inhaling this particular stuff you you
 
00:43:35.349 --> 00:43:35.359 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
again short-term long-term health health
 
00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
effects of it so
 
00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
the commission i would think would would
 
00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
hopefully would look at once they've
 
00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:43.990 align:start position:0%
hopefully would look at once they've
analyzed

00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
analyzed
 
00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:46.640 align:start position:0%
what what air quality is and what's
 
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
considered acceptable that they would
 
00:43:51.349 --> 00:43:51.359 align:start position:0%
attack and again
 
00:43:53.829 --> 00:43:53.839 align:start position:0%
that it's certainly subject for
 
00:43:57.430 --> 00:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
compensation that they would tackle the
 
00:43:59.190 --> 00:43:59.200 align:start position:0%
the health risks that that are involved
 
00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
with this
 
00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:01.030 align:start position:0%
with this
um

00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
i know
 
00:44:03.829 --> 00:44:03.839 align:start position:0%
trying to remember everything that you
 
00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
said representative and i apologize
 
00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:06.950 align:start position:0%
said representative and i apologize
um

00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
the one thing that i would would try to
 
00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:10.230 align:start position:0%
the one thing that i would would try to
amplify

00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:10.240 align:start position:0%
amplify
 
00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
to you as it relates to
 
00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:14.630 align:start position:0%
to you as it relates to
complexity

00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
complexity
 
00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:17.589 align:start position:0%
complexity
is

00:44:17.589 --> 00:44:17.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:17.599 --> 00:44:18.790 align:start position:0%
 
somewhere

00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
right now in a lab it could be mit could
 
00:44:24.309 --> 00:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
be cal tech could be stanford cornell
 
00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
you know they're they're making
 
00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
something new
 
00:44:29.829 --> 00:44:29.839 align:start position:0%
um and they're doing it in concert with
 
00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
what they can with chemical company a
 
00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
that's going to be the latest and
 
00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
greatest you know people are 2.0 before
 
00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:39.839 align:start position:0%
2.1 it's like you know your apple ios
 
00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
updates that we get ever it seems like
 
00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
you know every week we're getting a new
 
00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
update from apple on our phone
 
00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
pfos is the same thing this is going to
 
00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:48.640 align:start position:0%
be a new update and new update and this
 
00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
is you know what
 
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
we've tried to do in merrimack and the
 
00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
folks that have been on
 
00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
you know that and i don't mean to
 
00:44:58.470 --> 00:44:58.480 align:start position:0%
pontificate mr chairman and to my
 
00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
esteemed colleagues i apologize i'll be
 
00:45:02.309 --> 00:45:02.319 align:start position:0%
quick but this is what they've tried to
 
00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
to amplify to the general public
 
00:45:07.589 --> 00:45:07.599 align:start position:0%
you ban one chemical they're going to
 
00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
come up with something new you being
 
00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:10.640 align:start position:0%
that next chemical they're going to come
 
00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
up with something new it's just it's one
 
00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:16.640 align:start position:0%
domino after another and i think
 
00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
and i have a little bit of a difference
 
00:45:21.349 --> 00:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
of opinion with des because you know des
 
00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
is and i agree with what they're doing
 
00:45:25.270 --> 00:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
you know they're taking a programmatic
 
00:45:28.309 --> 00:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
approach to to identifying i'm like
 
00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
we we've got to basically all lumping
 
00:45:32.550 --> 00:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
into one grocery bag so that work i feel
 
00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
like we're covering everything and
 
00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it can't work that way but
 
00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
i think the more education we do we tell
 
00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:41.430 align:start position:0%
i think the more education we do we tell
people

00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:45:43.990 --> 00:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
of the potential effects that they could
 
00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
have not just on on water and fruit but
 
00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
our our health our animals our pets help
 
00:45:51.349 --> 00:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
you know i i think we'll be doing
 
00:45:53.109 --> 00:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
we will be doing
 
00:45:55.829 --> 00:45:55.839 align:start position:0%
our community a great service by
 
00:45:57.990 --> 00:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
educating people on that so
 
00:45:58.790 --> 00:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
representative i agree
 
00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:03.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:06.160 align:start position:0%
uh further questions for representative
 
00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:08.470 align:start position:0%
uh further questions for representative
boyd

00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
boyd
 
00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
i have one
 
00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
referring to your suggested amendment
 
00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:15.109 align:start position:0%
referring to your suggested amendment
representative

00:46:15.109 --> 00:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:46:17.349 --> 00:46:17.359 align:start position:0%
you use this language you say the
 
00:46:19.589 --> 00:46:19.599 align:start position:0%
commissioner shall conduct a review to
 
00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
determine whether there exists one study
 
00:46:27.109 --> 00:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:28.720 align:start position:0%
et cetera et cetera
 
00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:35.109 --> 00:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
why only one study what if there are
 
00:46:38.550 --> 00:46:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
could that language be modified in your
 
00:46:43.589 --> 00:46:43.599 align:start position:0%
judgment so i like i said i collaborated
 
00:46:45.349 --> 00:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
with des
 
00:46:48.309 --> 00:46:48.319 align:start position:0%
on on this particular language i
 
00:46:50.309 --> 00:46:50.319 align:start position:0%
made a small change based on the
 
00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation of an attorney from ols
 
00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
but i
 
00:46:56.790 --> 00:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
and i can't speak for for kathy and
 
00:46:58.230 --> 00:46:58.240 align:start position:0%
health and human health health and human
 
00:47:00.390 --> 00:47:00.400 align:start position:0%
services i apologize uh new hampshire
 
00:47:03.589 --> 00:47:03.599 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services um
 
00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
i certainly
 
00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
if you told me you wanted to see
 
00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
you know three or four
 
00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
you know definitive studies
 
00:47:14.069 --> 00:47:14.079 align:start position:0%
you know whether they be from
 
00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
state of minnesota
 
00:47:18.069 --> 00:47:18.079 align:start position:0%
mayo clinic i mean however you want i
 
00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
mean how i mean not to be facetious but
 
00:47:21.829 --> 00:47:21.839 align:start position:0%
however you wanted to arrive at that
 
00:47:24.069 --> 00:47:24.079 align:start position:0%
number i certainly would be amenable to
 
00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
i think the the concept
 
00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
of of the language of giving des the
 
00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:30.870 align:start position:0%
of of the language of giving des the
flexibility

00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
flexibility
 
00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:31.829 align:start position:0%
flexibility
to

00:47:31.829 --> 00:47:31.839 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
rely on specific studies that would
 
00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
allow new hampshire to be able
 
00:47:38.549 --> 00:47:38.559 align:start position:0%
to be proactive in
 
00:47:38.559 --> 00:47:39.910 align:start position:0%
to be proactive in
managing

00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
managing
 
00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh ambient air quality limits in new
 
00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire i think is
 
00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
the way that i
 
00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
walked away in with
 
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
the way that i walked away with is is
 
00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
the goal of what the amendment is trying
 
00:47:53.910 --> 00:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
to do to have des have that flexibility
 
00:47:58.150 --> 00:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:00.309 --> 00:48:00.319 align:start position:0%
or i'll get clarification rather on that
 
00:48:02.069 --> 00:48:02.079 align:start position:0%
question from
 
00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
ms uh beam when she testifies did i
 
00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
pronounce that correctly
 
00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
any further representative thomas
 
00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh this uh jogged
 
00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
me to ask this question so thank you for
 
00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:16.640 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
00:48:18.829 --> 00:48:18.839 align:start position:0%
realizing that the
 
00:48:22.230 --> 00:48:22.240 align:start position:0%
um the study of the air quality of pfas
 
00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
and the study of its effects in water
 
00:48:27.829 --> 00:48:27.839 align:start position:0%
are so closely related
 
00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
cause and effect if if you will
 
00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:32.720 align:start position:0%
would you
 
00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
be amenable if we came up with an
 
00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
amendment that although we keep those
 
00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
two commissions separate
 
00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
that there might be a requirement
 
00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
that the two commissions would have to
 
00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
collaborate at some point in time
 
00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:51.839 align:start position:0%
to collectively go over their
 
00:48:55.030 --> 00:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
information to see the symbiotic effects
 
00:48:58.309 --> 00:48:58.319 align:start position:0%
of of the two uh my my fear is that if
 
00:48:58.319 --> 00:48:59.030 align:start position:0%
of of the two uh my my fear is that if
you

00:48:59.030 --> 00:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
when you have two separate commissions
 
00:49:04.069 --> 00:49:04.079 align:start position:0%
they will take on a rice bowl approach
 
00:49:06.309 --> 00:49:06.319 align:start position:0%
and you know they'll report on their own
 
00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
but but i see a a potential need that at
 
00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
some point they would need to
 
00:49:12.549 --> 00:49:12.559 align:start position:0%
collaborate their information together
 
00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
and i think putting it into statute
 
00:49:16.549 --> 00:49:16.559 align:start position:0%
might be a way of ensuring that they
 
00:49:18.309 --> 00:49:18.319 align:start position:0%
that they share this information
 
00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
representative thomas thank you very
 
00:49:21.589 --> 00:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
much for your comments and question and
 
00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
the answer is yes i think it's a great
 
00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
idea i think that's absolutely important
 
00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:30.470 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:49:32.549 --> 00:49:32.559 align:start position:0%
any additional questions for
 
00:49:35.349 --> 00:49:35.359 align:start position:0%
representative boyd
 
00:49:37.349 --> 00:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
seeing none i thank you representative
 
00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
for bringing this bill to our committee
 
00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
and uh for your testimony this morning
 
00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:44.720 align:start position:0%
we appreciate it mr chairman through you
 
00:49:46.069 --> 00:49:46.079 align:start position:0%
and again to my esteemed colleagues of
 
00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
the general court thank you very much
 
00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
for having my bill today i appreciate it
 
00:49:51.109 --> 00:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
so now we'll turn to
 
00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh our next
 
00:49:57.990 --> 00:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
presenter and i'll call on kathy beam of
 
00:49:59.910 --> 00:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire department of
 
00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
environmental services air resources
 
00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:03.750 align:start position:0%
environmental services air resources
division

00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
division
 
00:50:05.990 --> 00:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
and please miss bm if i mispronounce
 
00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
your name i
 
00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
i ask your forgiveness and please give
 
00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
me the correct pronounce and
 
00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
pronunciation well thank you very much
 
00:50:15.589 --> 00:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
representative boys and the commission
 
00:50:15.599 --> 00:50:16.549 align:start position:0%
representative boys and the commission
committee

00:50:16.549 --> 00:50:16.559 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:20.240 align:start position:0%
it's beam so the h is silent
 
00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:21.109 align:start position:0%
it's beam so the h is silent
um

00:50:21.109 --> 00:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:23.200 align:start position:0%
so i just want to come up and give you
 
00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
some factual information about how the
 
00:50:28.069 --> 00:50:28.079 align:start position:0%
regulations that we currently implement
 
00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:30.640 align:start position:0%
at the department work because this bill
 
00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
and the amendment are part of a
 
00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:33.440 align:start position:0%
regulation that we already have on the
 
00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:41.670 --> 00:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
the bill and the amendment are
 
00:50:44.230 --> 00:50:44.240 align:start position:0%
language that will be if if approved
 
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
would be put into rsa 125 i which is our
 
00:50:50.230 --> 00:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
state air toxics regulation
 
00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
it already requires a department using
 
00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
the similar language
 
00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:55.589 align:start position:0%
the similar language
to

00:50:55.589 --> 00:50:55.599 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:50:58.150 --> 00:50:58.160 align:start position:0%
create rules that establish ambient air
 
00:51:00.790 --> 00:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
limits for inhalation standards
 
00:51:02.549 --> 00:51:02.559 align:start position:0%
for regulated pollutants and we have
 
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
over 400 regulated toxic air pollutants
 
00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
already on a
 
00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
regulation as a result of this rsa
 
00:51:12.790 --> 00:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
currently the way that those compounds
 
00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
go on to that rule is either they're
 
00:51:18.069 --> 00:51:18.079 align:start position:0%
deemed a hazardous air pollutant or they
 
00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
have information from the acgih which
 
00:51:22.870 --> 00:51:22.880 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i can't remember exactly what
 
00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
that is but it's basically osha's
 
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
you know a committee that comes up with
 
00:51:28.870 --> 00:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
the compounds that are of concern for
 
00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
osha exposure
 
00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:32.240 align:start position:0%
and we as a department
 
00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
create the limits based on information
 
00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
scientific and information
 
00:51:38.309 --> 00:51:38.319 align:start position:0%
so just to put into perspective the
 
00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
ammonia salt of pifoa was already on our
 
00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
ambient air list
 
00:51:44.069 --> 00:51:44.079 align:start position:0%
the company saint-gobain already was
 
00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
subject to the air already reformula
 
00:51:49.750 --> 00:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
related back in
 
00:51:52.230 --> 00:51:52.240 align:start position:0%
2006 as a result of that regulation so
 
00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
it already was dealing with inhalation
 
00:51:58.069 --> 00:51:58.079 align:start position:0%
exposure from a particular pfas compound
 
00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
what i believe this amendment
 
00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
does is require us to use the same
 
00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:03.750 align:start position:0%
does is require us to use the same
mechanism

00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
mechanism
 
00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
that we already have for other regular
 
00:52:07.829 --> 00:52:07.839 align:start position:0%
toxic aeroplanes but specifically spells
 
00:52:10.390 --> 00:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
out pfas and looking for a science that
 
00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
would substantiate putting more
 
00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:14.800 align:start position:0%
compounds from pfas
 
00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:17.200 align:start position:0%
substances on the list so that's
 
00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
just some context when it comes to air
 
00:52:24.069 --> 00:52:24.079 align:start position:0%
ex air emissions that impact water we
 
00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
already have a regulation it's called
 
00:52:28.069 --> 00:52:28.079 align:start position:0%
rsa 125 c
 
00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
10e and we'll go into the details but
 
00:52:31.270 --> 00:52:31.280 align:start position:0%
that is the
 
00:52:33.349 --> 00:52:33.359 align:start position:0%
backed best available control technology
 
00:52:35.109 --> 00:52:35.119 align:start position:0%
rule that required saint-gobain to put
 
00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
on the regenerative thermal oxidizer to
 
00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:38.720 align:start position:0%
control air emissions so they wouldn't
 
00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
impact water so we again have another
 
00:52:43.829 --> 00:52:43.839 align:start position:0%
regulation that already deals with
 
00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
air emissions that impact water versus
 
00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
this one which is inhalation standards i
 
00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
just wanted to put that into perspective
 
00:52:51.270 --> 00:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
and then the other comment i wanted to
 
00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:53.200 align:start position:0%
make is that when saint cobain was
 
00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
emitting large amounts of pifoa back in
 
00:52:58.390 --> 00:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
2004 2005
 
00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
just pifoa we're talking about it was
 
00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
around 800 pounds a year the
 
00:53:04.950 --> 00:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
reformulation brought them down 96
 
00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
reduction as a result of this air toxics
 
00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:08.150 align:start position:0%
reduction as a result of this air toxics
regulation

00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
regulation
 
00:53:10.470 --> 00:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
and now after measuring their stack test
 
00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
emissions back in september
 
00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
49 compounds 49 p-fast compounds
 
00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:18.640 align:start position:0%
uncontrolled would be about 17 pounds a
 
00:53:20.549 --> 00:53:20.559 align:start position:0%
year and controlled her at 2 pounds a
 
00:53:22.230 --> 00:53:22.240 align:start position:0%
year so i just want to put everybody
 
00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
into that perspective it was around 900
 
00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:24.870 align:start position:0%
into that perspective it was around 900
it's

00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:53:26.630 --> 00:53:26.640 align:start position:0%
for one compound we're now down to
 
00:53:28.790 --> 00:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
controlled emissions of 49 compounds at
 
00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:30.160 align:start position:0%
2 pounds a year which is why the
 
00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
department was a little concerned about
 
00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
the 45 pounds per year across the state
 
00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
we weren't quite sure where it came from
 
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:36.710 align:start position:0%
we weren't quite sure where it came from
so

00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:53:39.430 --> 00:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
i'm you know just providing information
 
00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
for the commission our committee sorry
 
00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
well thank you we appreciate that
 
00:53:46.630 --> 00:53:46.640 align:start position:0%
information it's
 
00:53:48.870 --> 00:53:48.880 align:start position:0%
very important to uh
 
00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
to our decision-making process
 
00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
and i suspect we number one want to
 
00:53:56.950 --> 00:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here to testify and
 
00:53:58.630 --> 00:53:58.640 align:start position:0%
to answer questions and i suspect there
 
00:54:00.069 --> 00:54:00.079 align:start position:0%
will be quite a few
 
00:54:01.670 --> 00:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
questions for you
 
00:54:04.549 --> 00:54:04.559 align:start position:0%
uh representative thomas is recognized
 
00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair a very simple
 
00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
question uh
 
00:54:09.910 --> 00:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
what you just presented us is that a
 
00:54:12.069 --> 00:54:12.079 align:start position:0%
written testimony that you provide to us
 
00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
it was very technical and and number
 
00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
oriented we'd like to be able to read
 
00:54:17.349 --> 00:54:17.359 align:start position:0%
that sure
 
00:54:19.750 --> 00:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
um is it possible for me to provide that
 
00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
in an email later i don't have it
 
00:54:23.589 --> 00:54:23.599 align:start position:0%
written up i just yes yeah please do
 
00:54:25.270 --> 00:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
email would be fine thank you
 
00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative mcgee is recognized
 
00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
for a question thank you mr chairman and
 
00:54:34.630 --> 00:54:34.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony miss beam
 
00:54:37.430 --> 00:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that when you last
 
00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
measured at st cobain in september
 
00:54:43.750 --> 00:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
um my question is around uh
 
00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:46.240 align:start position:0%
you know we're talking about quantifying
 
00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
in terms of how we categorize what we're
 
00:54:51.270 --> 00:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
looking at so that we understand what it
 
00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
is and what category it should be in in
 
00:54:54.950 --> 00:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
order to be regulated
 
00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
but then the other piece of that is the
 
00:54:58.549 --> 00:54:58.559 align:start position:0%
enforcement so i wonder if you could
 
00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
tell us a little bit about how
 
00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
how we get a handle on it in terms of
 
00:55:04.549 --> 00:55:04.559 align:start position:0%
being able to interact with the
 
00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:06.640 align:start position:0%
companies who might be
 
00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
leeching this either from their air you
 
00:55:12.390 --> 00:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
know air stacks or or through water
 
00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
how that piece happens and
 
00:55:16.950 --> 00:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
you know how well you think you're able
 
00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
to keep on top of the enforcement piece
 
00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
of whether people are actually complying
 
00:55:22.870 --> 00:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
with the regulations that we have in
 
00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:26.630 align:start position:0%
with the regulations that we have in
place

00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:27.829 --> 00:55:27.839 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much for your
 
00:55:27.839 --> 00:55:29.349 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much for your
question

00:55:29.349 --> 00:55:29.359 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:55:31.349 --> 00:55:31.359 align:start position:0%
as it pertains to saint-gobain they
 
00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:34.240 align:start position:0%
already have an air permit and so we are
 
00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
already well you know very familiar with
 
00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
the facility we have requirements for
 
00:55:39.990 --> 00:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
monitoring record keeping reporting we
 
00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
can inspect at any time we have
 
00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
inspected um
 
00:55:46.230 --> 00:55:46.240 align:start position:0%
recently we do
 
00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
you know do inspections and enforcement
 
00:55:51.349 --> 00:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
for those facilities and others that may
 
00:55:53.109 --> 00:55:53.119 align:start position:0%
fall into that category
 
00:55:55.829 --> 00:55:55.839 align:start position:0%
um when it comes to very small sources
 
00:55:57.589 --> 00:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
they're still required to comply with
 
00:56:00.309 --> 00:56:00.319 align:start position:0%
the state or toxics regulation and many
 
00:56:01.950 --> 00:56:01.960 align:start position:0%
times that's a
 
00:56:04.549 --> 00:56:04.559 align:start position:0%
self-monitored type of situation if if
 
00:56:07.270 --> 00:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
you look at this rsa 125 i where this
 
00:56:08.789 --> 00:56:08.799 align:start position:0%
bill is proposed
 
00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
that requires us to write regulations
 
00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
and it imposes requirements on sources
 
00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
but in terms of actually having to have
 
00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
a permit or going through us and being
 
00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:19.430 align:start position:0%
a permit or going through us and being
evaluated

00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
evaluated
 
00:56:21.349 --> 00:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
it's more of self-imposed on the
 
00:56:22.950 --> 00:56:22.960 align:start position:0%
companies unless they're already in the
 
00:56:25.109 --> 00:56:25.119 align:start position:0%
system but we can request that
 
00:56:26.710 --> 00:56:26.720 align:start position:0%
information at any time and they are
 
00:56:29.270 --> 00:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
required to to keep that information if
 
00:56:31.750 --> 00:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
they determine that by evaluating it
 
00:56:33.109 --> 00:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
they need a permit to limit their
 
00:56:34.789 --> 00:56:34.799 align:start position:0%
operations they're required by the rule
 
00:56:36.950 --> 00:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
to to contact us
 
00:56:38.390 --> 00:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
so i mean that's just
 
00:56:39.990 --> 00:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
the structure of the law itself and
 
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:41.510 align:start position:0%
the structure of the law itself and
follow-up

00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:56:43.349 --> 00:56:43.359 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you
 
00:56:46.630 --> 00:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
um i know that in my town north hollis
 
00:56:48.789 --> 00:56:48.799 align:start position:0%
uh several folks have received notices
 
00:56:51.589 --> 00:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
from des that they wanted to
 
00:56:54.069 --> 00:56:54.079 align:start position:0%
test their wells for potential pfast
 
00:56:56.230 --> 00:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
contamination and they and it was found
 
00:56:58.390 --> 00:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
in those wells in north hollis
 
00:57:01.030 --> 00:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
um but the source wasn't saint cobain it
 
00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:03.680 align:start position:0%
was another um it was determined to be
 
00:57:05.589 --> 00:57:05.599 align:start position:0%
and this is this is the rumor that i
 
00:57:07.589 --> 00:57:07.599 align:start position:0%
heard i wasn't really involved in the
 
00:57:09.190 --> 00:57:09.200 align:start position:0%
conversations but
 
00:57:11.829 --> 00:57:11.839 align:start position:0%
um another manufacturing plant that was
 
00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
over by the walmart facility in amherst
 
00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
and so i guess my question is when you
 
00:57:19.109 --> 00:57:19.119 align:start position:0%
talk about a large company you may have
 
00:57:21.349 --> 00:57:21.359 align:start position:0%
more insight into them because they
 
00:57:23.349 --> 00:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
actually have resources
 
00:57:25.510 --> 00:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
to devote to
 
00:57:27.349 --> 00:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
making sure that the state is able to
 
00:57:28.950 --> 00:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
get what information it needs and so
 
00:57:30.549 --> 00:57:30.559 align:start position:0%
that they might have more
 
00:57:32.470 --> 00:57:32.480 align:start position:0%
insights into what's going on in their
 
00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:33.750 align:start position:0%
insights into what's going on in their
company

00:57:33.750 --> 00:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
company
 
00:57:36.309 --> 00:57:36.319 align:start position:0%
do you have any knowledge of of other
 
00:57:36.319 --> 00:57:37.750 align:start position:0%
do you have any knowledge of of other
smaller

00:57:37.750 --> 00:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
smaller
 
00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:39.109 align:start position:0%
smaller
manufacturing

00:57:39.109 --> 00:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
manufacturing
 
00:57:41.109 --> 00:57:41.119 align:start position:0%
facilities around the state like the one
 
00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:42.640 align:start position:0%
that i'm referring to
 
00:57:43.990 --> 00:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
that are having
 
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.069 align:start position:0%
that are having
additional

00:57:46.069 --> 00:57:46.079 align:start position:0%
additional
 
00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
impacts on folks in the area in terms of
 
00:57:51.030 --> 00:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
pfas because i know that it's not widely
 
00:57:52.710 --> 00:57:52.720 align:start position:0%
known but i think
 
00:57:55.990 --> 00:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
the water piece is spreading
 
00:57:58.870 --> 00:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
ms beam before you answer that question
 
00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh representative mcgee i would caution
 
00:58:03.430 --> 00:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
you to
 
00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
be very careful about making an
 
00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:07.349 align:start position:0%
be very careful about making an
accusation

00:58:07.349 --> 00:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
accusation
 
00:58:09.670 --> 00:58:09.680 align:start position:0%
against a company
 
00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
that could be identified based on your
 
00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:13.829 align:start position:0%
that could be identified based on your
description

00:58:13.829 --> 00:58:13.839 align:start position:0%
description
 
00:58:16.710 --> 00:58:16.720 align:start position:0%
without evidence
 
00:58:19.510 --> 00:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
based on rumor i i don't think that's a
 
00:58:21.270 --> 00:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
an appropriate thing to do so i'd ask
 
00:58:23.030 --> 00:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
you to be very careful about that in the
 
00:58:25.750 --> 00:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
future i think yes involved in in the
 
00:58:27.829 --> 00:58:27.839 align:start position:0%
discussions with the people in my town i
 
00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
just don't remember the name of
 
00:58:32.549 --> 00:58:32.559 align:start position:0%
okay miss beam if you have any knowledge
 
00:58:34.390 --> 00:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
or if you want to comment feel free
 
00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:35.510 align:start position:0%
or if you want to comment feel free
otherwise

00:58:35.510 --> 00:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
00:58:37.109 --> 00:58:37.119 align:start position:0%
if you don't want to comment that's fine
 
00:58:37.119 --> 00:58:38.710 align:start position:0%
if you don't want to comment that's fine
too

00:58:38.710 --> 00:58:38.720 align:start position:0%
too
 
00:58:41.109 --> 00:58:41.119 align:start position:0%
the the only comment i can say is that
 
00:58:41.119 --> 00:58:42.150 align:start position:0%
the the only comment i can say is that
um

00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not involved with water and and the
 
00:58:45.910 --> 00:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
remediation efforts going on around the
 
00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
state so i can't really speak to that
 
00:58:49.510 --> 00:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
particular situation what i can speak to
 
00:58:51.990 --> 00:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
is our investigation of the air side of
 
00:58:54.309 --> 00:58:54.319 align:start position:0%
any of the companies in the in the state
 
00:58:57.829 --> 00:58:57.839 align:start position:0%
in 2016 when the saint-gobain incident
 
00:58:57.839 --> 00:58:58.630 align:start position:0%
in 2016 when the saint-gobain incident
was

00:58:58.630 --> 00:58:58.640 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:58:58.640 --> 00:58:59.990 align:start position:0%
was
discovered

00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
discovered
 
00:59:02.549 --> 00:59:02.559 align:start position:0%
we made a list of potential facilities
 
00:59:04.630 --> 00:59:04.640 align:start position:0%
based on their type of operation and
 
00:59:06.150 --> 00:59:06.160 align:start position:0%
based on what we know about pfas at the
 
00:59:08.230 --> 00:59:08.240 align:start position:0%
time and so we had a list of companies
 
00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
that we did further investigations
 
00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:11.990 align:start position:0%
that we did further investigations
inspections

00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
inspections
 
00:59:14.309 --> 00:59:14.319 align:start position:0%
surveys and whatnot so we do have a list
 
00:59:16.390 --> 00:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
of those
 
00:59:18.549 --> 00:59:18.559 align:start position:0%
there haven't been a large number of
 
00:59:20.549 --> 00:59:20.559 align:start position:0%
companies identified to the level that
 
00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
saint cobain was okay thank you
 
00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative pled is
 
00:59:27.109 --> 00:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question thank you mr
 
00:59:28.789 --> 00:59:28.799 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:59:31.030 --> 00:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
question miss beam
 
00:59:33.589 --> 00:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
in all of my spare time up here well uh
 
00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:36.720 align:start position:0%
in between keystrokes i went on the web
 
00:59:39.670 --> 00:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
and i'll ask if you think that acgih
 
00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
might stand for american conference of
 
00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
governmental industrial hygienists yes
 
00:59:48.309 --> 00:59:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for that clarification
 
00:59:51.270 --> 00:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts is
 
00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
 
00:59:54.870 --> 00:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:55.910 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:59:55.910 --> 00:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:58.150 --> 00:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned before the the
 
01:00:01.829 --> 01:00:01.839 align:start position:0%
there is another pfast situation going
 
01:00:01.839 --> 01:00:03.030 align:start position:0%
there is another pfast situation going
on

01:00:03.030 --> 01:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:03.750 align:start position:0%
on
and

01:00:03.750 --> 01:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:00:07.829 --> 01:00:07.839 align:start position:0%
in portsmouth and one of the one of the
 
01:00:09.670 --> 01:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
involvements is
 
01:00:10.950 --> 01:00:10.960 align:start position:0%
or one of the
 
01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
concerns is that children are playing on
 
01:00:16.630 --> 01:00:16.640 align:start position:0%
a field that is artificial and that
 
01:00:19.030 --> 01:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
somehow this pfas
 
01:00:21.030 --> 01:00:21.040 align:start position:0%
gets released
 
01:00:23.430 --> 01:00:23.440 align:start position:0%
and children are breathing it as well as
 
01:00:25.829 --> 01:00:25.839 align:start position:0%
coming in contact with it
 
01:00:28.789 --> 01:00:28.799 align:start position:0%
is there any way that and that's a small
 
01:00:30.390 --> 01:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
thing but when you're dealing with
 
01:00:33.270 --> 01:00:33.280 align:start position:0%
children it's not so small
 
01:00:35.670 --> 01:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
is there any way that the
 
01:00:39.270 --> 01:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
division of air services can monitor
 
01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
what's coming out of that field what
 
01:00:43.990 --> 01:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
emissions are coming out of that field
 
01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.349 align:start position:0%
emissions are coming out of that field
because

01:00:45.349 --> 01:00:45.359 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:00:49.349 --> 01:00:49.359 align:start position:0%
we were told or advised up until now
 
01:00:52.069 --> 01:00:52.079 align:start position:0%
that that's almost impossible to do on
 
01:00:54.069 --> 01:00:54.079 align:start position:0%
that level because of the pfas that
 
01:00:55.589 --> 01:00:55.599 align:start position:0%
surrounds us
 
01:00:58.069 --> 01:00:58.079 align:start position:0%
in regular life
 
01:00:58.079 --> 01:00:58.950 align:start position:0%
in regular life
so

01:00:58.950 --> 01:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:01.109 --> 01:01:01.119 align:start position:0%
can can the this
 
01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
large emissions
 
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
are probably easier to
 
01:01:08.069 --> 01:01:08.079 align:start position:0%
quantify but how about the small
 
01:01:10.069 --> 01:01:10.079 align:start position:0%
emissions we could be which could be
 
01:01:12.150 --> 01:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
just as dangerous if done on a regular
 
01:01:16.470 --> 01:01:16.480 align:start position:0%
basis can you do that now or is that
 
01:01:17.349 --> 01:01:17.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
representative i'm sure
 
01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
um there are various ways to measure air
 
01:01:25.990 --> 01:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
concentrations in air
 
01:01:28.230 --> 01:01:28.240 align:start position:0%
one is to do a stack test right at the
 
01:01:30.069 --> 01:01:30.079 align:start position:0%
facility and collect the information
 
01:01:31.910 --> 01:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
directly from the vent which is the most
 
01:01:33.349 --> 01:01:33.359 align:start position:0%
accurate because you know where it's
 
01:01:35.109 --> 01:01:35.119 align:start position:0%
coming from and you have methods to do
 
01:01:38.069 --> 01:01:38.079 align:start position:0%
so that's what we've done at st cobain
 
01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
the other way is to monitor background
 
01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
information and put monitors around the
 
01:01:44.950 --> 01:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
facility so in the case of saint gobain
 
01:01:46.470 --> 01:01:46.480 align:start position:0%
we've asked them to do some rainwater
 
01:01:49.109 --> 01:01:49.119 align:start position:0%
studies looking at wet deposition
 
01:01:51.510 --> 01:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
and what's collected in rainwater and
 
01:01:53.190 --> 01:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
there have been some studies nationally
 
01:01:55.270 --> 01:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
that have looked at rainwater and then
 
01:01:56.789 --> 01:01:56.799 align:start position:0%
there is another method where you can
 
01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
get ambient dry deposition it's much
 
01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
more difficult to actually get
 
01:02:04.230 --> 01:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
substantial amount of information from
 
01:02:05.910 --> 01:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
that or even to be able to pinpoint
 
01:02:07.589 --> 01:02:07.599 align:start position:0%
where that background information you
 
01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:10.240 align:start position:0%
know concentration is coming from
 
01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
many of the studies i've read about
 
01:02:14.390 --> 01:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
background dry deposition or dry
 
01:02:16.870 --> 01:02:16.880 align:start position:0%
concentrations have been in picograms
 
01:02:18.309 --> 01:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
which is an order of magnitude lower
 
01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
than what is measured or what is of
 
01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:21.670 align:start position:0%
than what is measured or what is of
concern

01:02:21.670 --> 01:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
concern
 
01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
from from an inhalation point of view
 
01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:24.470 align:start position:0%
from from an inhalation point of view
but

01:02:24.470 --> 01:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:02:25.670 --> 01:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
again there haven't been that many
 
01:02:27.829 --> 01:02:27.839 align:start position:0%
studies on breathing it in
 
01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
at those lower levels
 
01:02:31.829 --> 01:02:31.839 align:start position:0%
mostly it's been about children in terms
 
01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
of getting it on their hands with dust
 
01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:34.470 align:start position:0%
of getting it on their hands with dust
and

01:02:34.470 --> 01:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:02:36.309 --> 01:02:36.319 align:start position:0%
ingesting it and that's why the
 
01:02:38.230 --> 01:02:38.240 align:start position:0%
standards are primarily related to
 
01:02:41.510 --> 01:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
drinking water or perhaps with with dust
 
01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
and and that sort of thing but there are
 
01:02:45.829 --> 01:02:45.839 align:start position:0%
not been that many studies done on
 
01:02:47.589 --> 01:02:47.599 align:start position:0%
inhaling it especially at those very low
 
01:02:47.599 --> 01:02:49.750 align:start position:0%
inhaling it especially at those very low
levels

01:02:49.750 --> 01:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
levels
 
01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:51.750 align:start position:0%
levels
follow-up

01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
what what you just said about the dust
 
01:02:56.069 --> 01:02:56.079 align:start position:0%
and inhaling it and and getting it on
 
01:02:58.950 --> 01:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
their skin and as well as inhaling it
 
01:03:02.309 --> 01:03:02.319 align:start position:0%
if children are playing and on a field
 
01:03:02.319 --> 01:03:04.390 align:start position:0%
if children are playing and on a field
that

01:03:04.390 --> 01:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:03:09.349 --> 01:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
could that be a problem in your mind and
 
01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
would it
 
01:03:16.470 --> 01:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
come to the attention of the des
 
01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
and then if that field does prove to be
 
01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
a problem
 
01:03:24.870 --> 01:03:24.880 align:start position:0%
have we
 
01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:32.549 --> 01:03:32.559 align:start position:0%
so i i don't think we have enough
 
01:03:34.309 --> 01:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
information to be able to comment on
 
01:03:36.390 --> 01:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
that in terms of both exposure or in
 
01:03:39.029 --> 01:03:39.039 align:start position:0%
terms of toxicity so i i don't really
 
01:03:40.549 --> 01:03:40.559 align:start position:0%
have an answer for that
 
01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative samsung is
 
01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:46.549 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative samsung is

01:03:46.549 --> 01:03:46.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:48.390 --> 01:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chairman and
 
01:03:50.309 --> 01:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
thank you miss miss beam
 
01:03:50.319 --> 01:03:52.069 align:start position:0%
thank you miss miss beam
um

01:03:52.069 --> 01:03:52.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:54.640 align:start position:0%
i i want to kind of uh
 
01:03:56.829 --> 01:03:56.839 align:start position:0%
hook on to the comment that
 
01:03:59.670 --> 01:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
representative was making before about
 
01:04:02.069 --> 01:04:02.079 align:start position:0%
the symbiotic relationship
 
01:04:04.069 --> 01:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
between representative thomas about
 
01:04:05.910 --> 01:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
water and air
 
01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
and we just heard
 
01:04:09.109 --> 01:04:09.119 align:start position:0%
from representative mcgee about the
 
01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
issue with well water
 
01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
so i know that you're now
 
01:04:15.670 --> 01:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
you've got limits on air emissions and
 
01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
you have identified the primary source
 
01:04:20.069 --> 01:04:20.079 align:start position:0%
for this in the state at least here in
 
01:04:21.430 --> 01:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:04:24.190 --> 01:04:24.200 align:start position:0%
but what is the role of des as far as
 
01:04:27.349 --> 01:04:27.359 align:start position:0%
remediation i mean this plant has been
 
01:04:30.069 --> 01:04:30.079 align:start position:0%
emitting this large quantities for many
 
01:04:31.829 --> 01:04:31.839 align:start position:0%
many years
 
01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
and that has had an impact on the
 
01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
environment around us and perhaps even
 
01:04:37.829 --> 01:04:37.839 align:start position:0%
health effects
 
01:04:39.990 --> 01:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
and that could include well water in the
 
01:04:42.150 --> 01:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
vicinity of the area
 
01:04:44.470 --> 01:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
so what is ds's role in trying to
 
01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:46.559 align:start position:0%
mitigate any harm that was done in the
 
01:04:46.559 --> 01:04:48.950 align:start position:0%
mitigate any harm that was done in the
past

01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
past
 
01:04:52.710 --> 01:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:54.230 --> 01:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
in the interest of time i really can't
 
01:04:55.349 --> 01:04:55.359 align:start position:0%
go through all of the things that are
 
01:04:57.349 --> 01:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
going on with the remediation efforts in
 
01:05:00.150 --> 01:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
merrimack but i can say that um there is
 
01:05:01.910 --> 01:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
a huge site investigation going on in
 
01:05:04.309 --> 01:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
the waste division i primarily work in
 
01:05:06.309 --> 01:05:06.319 align:start position:0%
the air side of things so i would be
 
01:05:07.910 --> 01:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
remiss in trying to answer all of your
 
01:05:09.270 --> 01:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
questions regarding what's going on in
 
01:05:11.029 --> 01:05:11.039 align:start position:0%
that area
 
01:05:11.039 --> 01:05:11.750 align:start position:0%
that area
but

01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:12.789 align:start position:0%
but
again

01:05:12.789 --> 01:05:12.799 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
that information or that that evaluation
 
01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
is being done by the waste division
 
01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:19.109 align:start position:0%
is being done by the waste division
so

01:05:19.109 --> 01:05:19.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:05:21.510 --> 01:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
i don't know if i can exactly
 
01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
cover everything that they're doing
 
01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
it's not my area of expertise
 
01:05:27.589 --> 01:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative thomas is
 
01:05:29.510 --> 01:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question uh thank you
 
01:05:32.069 --> 01:05:32.079 align:start position:0%
mr thank you for taking my question um
 
01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
much to my knowledge
 
01:05:35.910 --> 01:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
of all the compounds that can be
 
01:05:38.870 --> 01:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
combined into the general pfas category
 
01:05:41.829 --> 01:05:41.839 align:start position:0%
i believe there's a five i believe that
 
01:05:43.910 --> 01:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
are considered the most concerning at
 
01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
this time so i was wondering and correct
 
01:05:48.870 --> 01:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
me if i'm wrong but so i was wondering
 
01:05:51.029 --> 01:05:51.039 align:start position:0%
in your testing particularly of of the
 
01:05:51.039 --> 01:05:51.990 align:start position:0%
in your testing particularly of of the
air

01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
air
 
01:05:55.190 --> 01:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
does one test fit all or do you have to
 
01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:56.069 align:start position:0%
does one test fit all or do you have to
do

01:05:56.069 --> 01:05:56.079 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:05:58.710 --> 01:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
numerous tests for each and every
 
01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:00.230 align:start position:0%
numerous tests for each and every
compound

01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
compound
 
01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for your questions so
 
01:06:04.150 --> 01:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
stack testing we get the sample but we
 
01:06:07.029 --> 01:06:07.039 align:start position:0%
can analyze now for up to 50 pfas
 
01:06:09.190 --> 01:06:09.200 align:start position:0%
compounds from that sample
 
01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
and those 50 do cover all of the
 
01:06:12.309 --> 01:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
compounds that have an ambient
 
01:06:13.910 --> 01:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
groundwater quality standard in the
 
01:06:16.069 --> 01:06:16.079 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire as well as 45
 
01:06:20.069 --> 01:06:20.079 align:start position:0%
others or actually 46 others i guess so
 
01:06:21.670 --> 01:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
yeah we can we can get it from one
 
01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:22.630 align:start position:0%
yeah we can we can get it from one
sample

01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:22.640 align:start position:0%
sample
 
01:06:25.270 --> 01:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:27.510 --> 01:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative bernardi is
 
01:06:29.910 --> 01:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
 
01:06:31.990 --> 01:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh thank you miss
 
01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
beam um
 
01:06:36.549 --> 01:06:36.559 align:start position:0%
with respect to setting and ultimately
 
01:06:38.789 --> 01:06:38.799 align:start position:0%
setting a standard that
 
01:06:41.109 --> 01:06:41.119 align:start position:0%
is described in the amendment or
 
01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
potentially commission coming up with
 
01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:44.630 align:start position:0%
potentially commission coming up with
this

01:06:44.630 --> 01:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that typically two
 
01:06:49.349 --> 01:06:49.359 align:start position:0%
adequate and well-controlled studies are
 
01:06:49.359 --> 01:06:50.630 align:start position:0%
adequate and well-controlled studies are
the

01:06:50.630 --> 01:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:06:52.630 --> 01:06:52.640 align:start position:0%
the basis for setting a particular
 
01:06:54.870 --> 01:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
standard i'm i'm trying to understand
 
01:06:58.230 --> 01:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
why one was selected here
 
01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for your questions so
 
01:07:02.549 --> 01:07:02.559 align:start position:0%
in drafting the amendment uh the
 
01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
department took the existing language
 
01:07:06.390 --> 01:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
that's in rsa125i
 
01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:07.270 align:start position:0%
that's in rsa125i
that

01:07:07.270 --> 01:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:07:09.990 --> 01:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
that requires us to set rules based on
 
01:07:11.990 --> 01:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
one standard if somebody um brings that
 
01:07:13.910 --> 01:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
to our attention so i just used we just
 
01:07:15.430 --> 01:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
used the same language that was already
 
01:07:17.029 --> 01:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
in there for the regular
 
01:07:19.029 --> 01:07:19.039 align:start position:0%
regular toxic air pollutants in the
 
01:07:21.270 --> 01:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
previous section of the law so it was
 
01:07:23.510 --> 01:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
just a consistency more than a
 
01:07:25.349 --> 01:07:25.359 align:start position:0%
you know an up-to-date way of
 
01:07:26.870 --> 01:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
defining how that study should be
 
01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:28.150 align:start position:0%
defining how that study should be
evaluated

01:07:28.150 --> 01:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
evaluated
 
01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:30.630 align:start position:0%
evaluated
follow-up

01:07:30.630 --> 01:07:30.640 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:07:33.270 --> 01:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
then is it appropriate in some future
 
01:07:35.990 --> 01:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
bill to change that standard to
 
01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
two for the future
 
01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:43.270 --> 01:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative pementel is
 
01:07:45.430 --> 01:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
 
01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you ms bean
 
01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:49.349 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you ms bean
uh

01:07:49.349 --> 01:07:49.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:07:49.359 --> 01:07:50.710 align:start position:0%
uh
there's

01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:07:53.190 --> 01:07:53.200 align:start position:0%
this conversation is going a couple ways
 
01:07:55.029 --> 01:07:55.039 align:start position:0%
one is towards the
 
01:07:56.950 --> 01:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
amended bill and the other is to a
 
01:07:56.960 --> 01:07:59.910 align:start position:0%
amended bill and the other is to a
commission

01:07:59.910 --> 01:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:02.390 --> 01:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
commissions are always very informative
 
01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
and give us a lot of answers that we
 
01:08:05.990 --> 01:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
don't already have
 
01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
that being said
 
01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
is there any reason why we shouldn't go
 
01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:11.670 align:start position:0%
is there any reason why we shouldn't go
forward

01:08:11.670 --> 01:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:08:14.069 --> 01:08:14.079 align:start position:0%
with an amended bill
 
01:08:15.750 --> 01:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
just to keep things
 
01:08:19.669 --> 01:08:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:21.189 --> 01:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
again i would leave that up to the
 
01:08:22.870 --> 01:08:22.880 align:start position:0%
committee i i don't have an opinion one
 
01:08:25.669 --> 01:08:25.679 align:start position:0%
way or the other in that regard
 
01:08:27.269 --> 01:08:27.279 align:start position:0%
certainly if you if you did the
 
01:08:27.279 --> 01:08:28.309 align:start position:0%
certainly if you if you did the
amendment

01:08:28.309 --> 01:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:08:30.709 --> 01:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
it would require us as a department to
 
01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
look at the studies on an annual basis
 
01:08:34.789 --> 01:08:34.799 align:start position:0%
and at least be doing that
 
01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
it could be done in conjunction i
 
01:08:39.749 --> 01:08:39.759 align:start position:0%
suppose with the commission but
 
01:08:39.759 --> 01:08:42.070 align:start position:0%
suppose with the commission but
follow-up

01:08:42.070 --> 01:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:08:44.470 --> 01:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman ye i guess
 
01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:46.229 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman ye i guess
essentially

01:08:46.229 --> 01:08:46.239 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
01:08:46.239 --> 01:08:47.189 align:start position:0%
essentially
um

01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:47.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:49.430 --> 01:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm not asking
 
01:08:51.990 --> 01:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
if you think it's a
 
01:08:55.749 --> 01:08:55.759 align:start position:0%
good idea i guess i'm asking
 
01:08:57.430 --> 01:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
do you think it's
 
01:08:59.110 --> 01:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
not prudent
 
01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:01.669 align:start position:0%
not prudent
to

01:09:01.669 --> 01:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
pass this amended version
 
01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:05.349 align:start position:0%
pass this amended version
if

01:09:05.349 --> 01:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:09:08.070 --> 01:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
we're also going to do a study committee
 
01:09:10.709 --> 01:09:10.719 align:start position:0%
or a commission
 
01:09:12.229 --> 01:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
well i guess i'm unclear what the
 
01:09:13.749 --> 01:09:13.759 align:start position:0%
commission's purpose is if they're
 
01:09:15.269 --> 01:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
looking for a study and doing the same
 
01:09:17.030 --> 01:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
work then maybe it isn't prudent but if
 
01:09:19.269 --> 01:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
they're doing further evaluations of air
 
01:09:21.910 --> 01:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
inhalation issues i i'm not completely
 
01:09:23.269 --> 01:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
sure what the commission's proposed to
 
01:09:24.309 --> 01:09:24.319 align:start position:0%
do so
 
01:09:27.990 --> 01:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:30.070 --> 01:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative cambrils
 
01:09:32.309 --> 01:09:32.319 align:start position:0%
is recognized for a question
 
01:09:34.149 --> 01:09:34.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you miss
 
01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
bean uh you mentioned earlier that most
 
01:09:39.030 --> 01:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
of the small industrial companies
 
01:09:40.630 --> 01:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
self-regulate or
 
01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:41.990 align:start position:0%
self-regulate or
self-monitor

01:09:41.990 --> 01:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
self-monitor
 
01:09:44.470 --> 01:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
at what point or what is the threshold
 
01:09:46.309 --> 01:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
for them to have to get a permit like
 
01:09:46.319 --> 01:09:49.669 align:start position:0%
for them to have to get a permit like
sangobain

01:09:49.669 --> 01:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:51.749 --> 01:09:51.759 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um so there
 
01:09:53.669 --> 01:09:53.679 align:start position:0%
are different requirements for permit
 
01:09:55.830 --> 01:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
to get a permit some of them are
 
01:09:57.590 --> 01:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
separate from
 
01:09:57.600 --> 01:09:58.390 align:start position:0%
separate from
the

01:09:58.390 --> 01:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
regulated toxic air pollutant rule some
 
01:10:01.910 --> 01:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
of them are because of the size of a
 
01:10:04.310 --> 01:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
boiler or in terms of the emissions of
 
01:10:06.390 --> 01:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
all the organic compounds in general or
 
01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
particular process so there are lots of
 
01:10:10.390 --> 01:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
reasons to get a permit for that
 
01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
particular law and the rule that applies
 
01:10:14.550 --> 01:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
to it what it basically says is that you
 
01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
have to comply with these ambient air
 
01:10:18.390 --> 01:10:18.400 align:start position:0%
limits and if you cannot do so with
 
01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:20.070 align:start position:0%
limits and if you cannot do so with
uncontrolled

01:10:20.070 --> 01:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
uncontrolled
 
01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh emissions allowed you know throughout
 
01:10:25.189 --> 01:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
87 60 hours a year and you need to take
 
01:10:26.550 --> 01:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
some sort of limitation either in
 
01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
throughput or hours or whatever you have
 
01:10:31.030 --> 01:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
to come and ask for a permit that
 
01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
limits you to that that's that's how the
 
01:10:34.870 --> 01:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
rule is structured
 
01:10:37.270 --> 01:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:38.149 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:10:38.149 --> 01:10:38.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
additional questions for miss beam
 
01:10:44.550 --> 01:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
representative samsic
 
01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you miss
 
01:10:49.030 --> 01:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
bean i just want to follow up again on
 
01:10:51.189 --> 01:10:51.199 align:start position:0%
this question of one study
 
01:10:54.149 --> 01:10:54.159 align:start position:0%
uh if i read if i read this
 
01:10:56.790 --> 01:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
amendment correctly it almost sounds
 
01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:58.310 align:start position:0%
amendment correctly it almost sounds
like

01:10:58.310 --> 01:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:11:00.310 --> 01:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
you need to conduct a review and if you
 
01:11:03.270 --> 01:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
can just find one study
 
01:11:06.310 --> 01:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
that shows some kind of cause of chronic
 
01:11:08.470 --> 01:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
illness or so forth
 
01:11:13.590 --> 01:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:14.870 --> 01:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
why not
 
01:11:17.510 --> 01:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
identify all studies including the ones
 
01:11:18.790 --> 01:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
that show no
 
01:11:22.229 --> 01:11:22.239 align:start position:0%
no negative effects or why is just one
 
01:11:24.709 --> 01:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
study required it almost sounds like we
 
01:11:27.030 --> 01:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
need to kind of sift through the studies
 
01:11:29.110 --> 01:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
and find one that we like and we pick
 
01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
that one and we ignore the others that
 
01:11:33.430 --> 01:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
probably is not a good way of doing
 
01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:35.750 align:start position:0%
probably is not a good way of doing
things

01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so
 
01:11:42.070 --> 01:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
initially the department had suggested
 
01:11:43.990 --> 01:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
that there be language that it would be
 
01:11:45.590 --> 01:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
upon the term determination by the
 
01:11:47.669 --> 01:11:47.679 align:start position:0%
department about the study so that we
 
01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
could evaluate the scientific validity
 
01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
of it um
 
01:11:55.110 --> 01:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
but that was a little too ambiguous so i
 
01:11:57.750 --> 01:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
think it was recommended to remove that
 
01:11:57.760 --> 01:11:59.189 align:start position:0%
think it was recommended to remove that
um

01:11:59.189 --> 01:11:59.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:01.030 --> 01:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
you know again the language was exactly
 
01:12:02.709 --> 01:12:02.719 align:start position:0%
what was in the previous section four of
 
01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
that law that says we do the same thing
 
01:12:06.470 --> 01:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
for regulated toxic air balloons now
 
01:12:08.630 --> 01:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
have we had very many people come and
 
01:12:10.950 --> 01:12:10.960 align:start position:0%
bring a study to us to get a compound on
 
01:12:12.229 --> 01:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
the list no
 
01:12:13.990 --> 01:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
so it hasn't probably been vetted as to
 
01:12:16.470 --> 01:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
the level that it may imply but
 
01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:17.510 align:start position:0%
the level that it may imply but
um

01:12:17.510 --> 01:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
so we were just using the language
 
01:12:21.430 --> 01:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
that's already in the law for other
 
01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
pollutants for this particular case so i
 
01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
defer to the committee on whether that
 
01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
should be
 
01:12:29.430 --> 01:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
changed or broadened or whatever you
 
01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:30.709 align:start position:0%
changed or broadened or whatever you
choose

01:12:30.709 --> 01:12:30.719 align:start position:0%
choose
 
01:12:32.229 --> 01:12:32.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:12:34.229 --> 01:12:34.239 align:start position:0%
sounds like a matter for discussion at
 
01:12:35.750 --> 01:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
some future date
 
01:12:37.830 --> 01:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
any further questions for
 
01:12:43.110 --> 01:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:44.950 --> 01:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
seeing none i will thank you miss beam
 
01:12:47.590 --> 01:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
for coming this morning to testify
 
01:12:50.149 --> 01:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
before the committee we appreciate your
 
01:12:52.149 --> 01:12:52.159 align:start position:0%
insights and your data
 
01:12:54.149 --> 01:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
and i would like also like to thank
 
01:12:57.110 --> 01:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
representative boyd for bringing this
 
01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
bill to our attention
 
01:13:02.390 --> 01:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
as you may have
 
01:13:04.950 --> 01:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
determined or or guessed
 
01:13:07.270 --> 01:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
i was expecting a much larger crowd of
 
01:13:09.350 --> 01:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
people to testify on this bill so that's
 
01:13:11.510 --> 01:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
why i originally scheduled this hearing
 
01:13:13.189 --> 01:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
for two hours
 
01:13:15.270 --> 01:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
and uh i'm a little bit surprised that
 
01:13:17.669 --> 01:13:17.679 align:start position:0%
we had so few people interested given
 
01:13:17.679 --> 01:13:19.430 align:start position:0%
we had so few people interested given
the

01:13:19.430 --> 01:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:13:21.110 --> 01:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
the importance of this particular
 
01:13:23.590 --> 01:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
subject and and
 
01:13:25.270 --> 01:13:25.280 align:start position:0%
the number of discussions that are being
 
01:13:27.270 --> 01:13:27.280 align:start position:0%
held about it um
 
01:13:30.310 --> 01:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
but so be it that's the way it is uh
 
01:13:31.350 --> 01:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:13:34.390 --> 01:13:34.400 align:start position:0%
uh i'm going to close the public hearing
 
01:13:38.709 --> 01:13:38.719 align:start position:0%
on house bill 1546-f
 
01:13:38.719 --> 01:13:40.229 align:start position:0%
on house bill 1546-f
n

01:13:40.229 --> 01:13:40.239 align:start position:0%
n
 
01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee did you have a
 
01:13:44.470 --> 01:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
question yes mr chairman thank you um
 
01:13:46.550 --> 01:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
are we going to review the blue sheet i
 
01:13:48.229 --> 01:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
i know people may not have been signed
 
01:13:50.229 --> 01:13:50.239 align:start position:0%
in here but we may have had online folks
 
01:13:50.239 --> 01:13:51.669 align:start position:0%
in here but we may have had online folks
so

01:13:51.669 --> 01:13:51.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:13:54.149 --> 01:13:54.159 align:start position:0%
yes representative pementel would you
 
01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
retrieve the blue sheet and
 
01:13:58.470 --> 01:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
give us a
 
01:14:05.910 --> 01:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
you can just read it you don't have to
 
01:14:24.310 --> 01:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:25.990 --> 01:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and thank you
 
01:14:29.990 --> 01:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee for reminding me to
 
01:14:32.470 --> 01:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
announce the results of the flu of the
 
01:14:35.110 --> 01:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
blue sheet mr chair yes representative
 
01:14:37.350 --> 01:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
thomas thank you for clarification does
 
01:14:39.830 --> 01:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh uh representative pimentel does that
 
01:14:41.430 --> 01:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
mean that there were in terms of the
 
01:14:46.310 --> 01:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
blue sheet they were zero pro one con
 
01:14:49.830 --> 01:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:51.030 --> 01:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
uh rep
 
01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:52.149 align:start position:0%
uh rep
kristen

01:14:52.149 --> 01:14:52.159 align:start position:0%
kristen
 
01:14:54.550 --> 01:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
do you know how to get the results of
 
01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:01.669 --> 01:15:01.679 align:start position:0%
representative partial maybe you know
 
01:15:03.510 --> 01:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
something about this
 
01:15:05.830 --> 01:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
she does and so do i and i already have
 
01:15:07.910 --> 01:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
it here so i'll save you the trouble
 
01:15:10.149 --> 01:15:10.159 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:15:12.630 --> 01:15:12.640 align:start position:0%
eight people in support of this bill
 
01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:13.830 align:start position:0%
eight people in support of this bill
34

01:15:13.830 --> 01:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
34
 
01:15:15.189 --> 01:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
in opposition
 
01:15:17.189 --> 01:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
and no neutrals
 
01:15:19.830 --> 01:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:15:22.470 --> 01:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
at some point we'll need a a description
 
01:15:25.030 --> 01:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
of how to retrieve that information
 
01:15:27.030 --> 01:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
for all of us representative knotter has
 
01:15:28.070 --> 01:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
a question
 
01:15:30.550 --> 01:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman do we have any way
 
01:15:33.350 --> 01:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
of knowing who the people are that sign
 
01:15:35.590 --> 01:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
in online where they come from from if
 
01:15:38.550 --> 01:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
they're even in new hampshire
 
01:15:40.390 --> 01:15:40.400 align:start position:0%
good question christian do you know the
 
01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:46.070 align:start position:0%
good question christian do you know the
answer

01:15:46.070 --> 01:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:48.229 --> 01:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
could you come up to the table and use
 
01:15:49.750 --> 01:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
the microphone to give us the answer
 
01:15:51.350 --> 01:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:15:59.430 --> 01:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:01.510 --> 01:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
i'm bringing my laptop because i don't
 
01:16:04.870 --> 01:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
always remember well enough without it
 
01:16:06.630 --> 01:16:06.640 align:start position:0%
on the general court website under the
 
01:16:08.870 --> 01:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
house homepage
 
01:16:10.229 --> 01:16:10.239 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry
 
01:16:12.229 --> 01:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
usually i'm thinking the same thing when
 
01:16:14.630 --> 01:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
people are talking okay
 
01:16:17.030 --> 01:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:16:19.510 --> 01:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
general court webpage for the hou the
 
01:16:21.750 --> 01:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
house home page
 
01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:28.470 --> 01:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:31.030 --> 01:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
meeting information which of course now
 
01:16:39.110 --> 01:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
at the bottom oh yes okay so if you go
 
01:16:43.030 --> 01:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
under actually forget about meeting
 
01:16:44.229 --> 01:16:44.239 align:start position:0%
information because that's what i was
 
01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
looking for before but representative
 
01:16:48.229 --> 01:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
partial is correct if um when there's
 
01:16:50.630 --> 01:16:50.640 align:start position:0%
the blue uh menu bar
 
01:16:51.830 --> 01:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
where you can see
 
01:16:53.669 --> 01:16:53.679 align:start position:0%
committees and there's a drop down where
 
01:16:55.189 --> 01:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
you can look up standing committees
 
01:16:56.790 --> 01:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
statutory and study
 
01:16:58.790 --> 01:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
you can look at online testimony
 
01:16:58.800 --> 01:16:59.990 align:start position:0%
you can look at online testimony
submissions

01:16:59.990 --> 01:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
submissions
 
01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
and if you click on that
 
01:17:05.669 --> 01:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
you can select a committee
 
01:17:07.430 --> 01:17:07.440 align:start position:0%
and then once you select a committee you
 
01:17:09.510 --> 01:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
can select a bill
 
01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
and obviously you select a bill and that
 
01:17:14.390 --> 01:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
will bring up um
 
01:17:16.790 --> 01:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
a list of um what was this what's his
 
01:17:19.070 --> 01:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
bill number one
 
01:17:21.910 --> 01:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
1546. okay thank you
 
01:17:24.870 --> 01:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
so if we look at 1546 i won't repeat the
 
01:17:27.189 --> 01:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
numbers but um
 
01:17:28.390 --> 01:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
on this one it doesn't look like there
 
01:17:31.590 --> 01:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
was any online written testimony but if
 
01:17:34.310 --> 01:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
there was you'd see a pdf link
 
01:17:35.830 --> 01:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
so you can see it from there and
 
01:17:37.510 --> 01:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
hopefully that will um
 
01:17:38.709 --> 01:17:38.719 align:start position:0%
i don't know how people feel about the
 
01:17:41.669 --> 01:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
emails but the the idea is fewer emails
 
01:17:44.790 --> 01:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
to the committee email address
 
01:17:47.830 --> 01:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
but otherwise it it should be on here i
 
01:17:51.110 --> 01:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
had one pdf that i didn't i clicked on
 
01:17:52.950 --> 01:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
and it couldn't find it so if anybody
 
01:17:54.950 --> 01:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
runs into that with something
 
01:17:57.030 --> 01:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
you can let us let me know and i can try
 
01:17:59.030 --> 01:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
to find out what's going on with that
 
01:18:00.630 --> 01:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
but it should work it should be when
 
01:18:02.390 --> 01:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
people submit the online
 
01:18:04.229 --> 01:18:04.239 align:start position:0%
submissions so again that's from the
 
01:18:05.990 --> 01:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
house homepage
 
01:18:08.229 --> 01:18:08.239 align:start position:0%
under committees at the in the blue menu
 
01:18:08.239 --> 01:18:09.830 align:start position:0%
under committees at the in the blue menu
bar

01:18:09.830 --> 01:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
bar
 
01:18:12.790 --> 01:18:12.800 align:start position:0%
online testimony submissions that's also
 
01:18:14.709 --> 01:18:14.719 align:start position:0%
where people can find the option to
 
01:18:16.709 --> 01:18:16.719 align:start position:0%
submit their own testimony
 
01:18:18.950 --> 01:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
so i think representative notter was
 
01:18:20.950 --> 01:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
asking a question about the online
 
01:18:22.870 --> 01:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
version of the blue sheet
 
01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:23.910 align:start position:0%
version of the blue sheet
okay

01:18:23.910 --> 01:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:18:26.870 --> 01:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
that's essentially it it's just either a
 
01:18:29.430 --> 01:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
blue it's all one list and if they
 
01:18:31.830 --> 01:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
submitted written testimony
 
01:18:33.910 --> 01:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
it will also have a pdf
 
01:18:35.669 --> 01:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
but that this also shows position
 
01:18:37.430 --> 01:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
supporter opposed
 
01:18:40.709 --> 01:18:40.719 align:start position:0%
representative partial
 
01:18:42.149 --> 01:18:42.159 align:start position:0%
yes thank you and thank you kristen for
 
01:18:43.910 --> 01:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
being so
 
01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:44.790 align:start position:0%
being so
thorough

01:18:44.790 --> 01:18:44.800 align:start position:0%
thorough
 
01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
there is one thing i think to answer
 
01:18:49.430 --> 01:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
representative knotter's question
 
01:18:51.990 --> 01:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know how to access
 
01:18:54.229 --> 01:18:54.239 align:start position:0%
where these are from i know when i weigh
 
01:18:57.669 --> 01:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
in on a bill myself they ask me my town
 
01:18:59.910 --> 01:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
this information is not getting through
 
01:19:01.350 --> 01:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
to this page
 
01:19:02.950 --> 01:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
i don't know if we can back up i think
 
01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
would be an excellent thing to know
 
01:19:06.830 --> 01:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
where these people are weighing in
 
01:19:08.950 --> 01:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
from but i
 
01:19:10.950 --> 01:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
and i know the information is available
 
01:19:12.950 --> 01:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
i'm just not seeing it
 
01:19:14.550 --> 01:19:14.560 align:start position:0%
get through to this level and i think
 
01:19:16.390 --> 01:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
it'd be an excellent suggestion for
 
01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:17.990 align:start position:0%
it'd be an excellent suggestion for
whoever

01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
whoever
 
01:19:19.350 --> 01:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
enters this information if you could
 
01:19:20.870 --> 01:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
find some way to do crystal as well you
 
01:19:25.590 --> 01:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:27.510 --> 01:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
i do know how to get to a different
 
01:19:29.830 --> 01:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
version of the of the blue sheet if
 
01:19:31.510 --> 01:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
we're still using it so i'll find out
 
01:19:33.030 --> 01:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
and what i can do is
 
01:19:35.430 --> 01:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
that these don't close until midnight
 
01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:36.550 align:start position:0%
that these don't close until midnight
tonight

01:19:36.550 --> 01:19:36.560 align:start position:0%
tonight
 
01:19:40.070 --> 01:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
so what i can do what i've been doing um
 
01:19:41.910 --> 01:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
or what we've been doing is they'll go
 
01:19:44.790 --> 01:19:44.800 align:start position:0%
in the file after it closes so you know
 
01:19:46.310 --> 01:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
tomorrow morning for example i can print
 
01:19:48.310 --> 01:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
out a different version that will have
 
01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
at least their
 
01:19:54.790 --> 01:19:54.800 align:start position:0%
email addresses i think let me see
 
01:19:57.030 --> 01:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
i can look at that up if you want to
 
01:19:58.630 --> 01:19:58.640 align:start position:0%
representative knotter did you have a
 
01:19:58.640 --> 01:19:59.750 align:start position:0%
representative knotter did you have a
follow-up

01:19:59.750 --> 01:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:20:02.709 --> 01:20:02.719 align:start position:0%
yes oh thank you i recognized ten of the
 
01:20:05.750 --> 01:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
names some of them are state reps or
 
01:20:07.590 --> 01:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
they they used to be
 
01:20:10.709 --> 01:20:10.719 align:start position:0%
one is a a lobbyist and
 
01:20:12.790 --> 01:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
one but the rest of them
 
01:20:14.870 --> 01:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
we don't know who they are i mean how do
 
01:20:16.790 --> 01:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
we know that they're not
 
01:20:19.270 --> 01:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
typing in from california or some other
 
01:20:20.390 --> 01:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
state right
 
01:20:24.950 --> 01:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
right um this is what i'm looking at now
 
01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:27.350 align:start position:0%
right um this is what i'm looking at now
so

01:20:27.350 --> 01:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:29.510 --> 01:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
i just don't know how
 
01:20:31.270 --> 01:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
you can get to it i just happen to have
 
01:20:32.629 --> 01:20:32.639 align:start position:0%
a link and i don't know if that's
 
01:20:32.639 --> 01:20:33.590 align:start position:0%
a link and i don't know if that's
something

01:20:33.590 --> 01:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:20:35.510 --> 01:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
that will work for everybody or if it's
 
01:20:36.550 --> 01:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
something i
 
01:20:38.229 --> 01:20:38.239 align:start position:0%
somebody shared with me
 
01:20:41.350 --> 01:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
but i do have that information um so i
 
01:20:43.350 --> 01:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
do have people's towns and email
 
01:20:46.629 --> 01:20:46.639 align:start position:0%
addresses and their positions so i can
 
01:20:48.950 --> 01:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
get that to the committee um i could
 
01:20:52.229 --> 01:20:52.239 align:start position:0%
send it to the clerk um or i can just
 
01:20:53.910 --> 01:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
however you want me to deliver it i can
 
01:20:55.510 --> 01:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
get that but we generally will do that
 
01:20:58.790 --> 01:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
the day after the hearing because
 
01:20:58.800 --> 01:20:59.830 align:start position:0%
the day after the hearing because
it's

01:20:59.830 --> 01:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:21:02.149 --> 01:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
they can still submit their opinion
 
01:21:03.990 --> 01:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
um through and after the hearing and up
 
01:21:06.470 --> 01:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
until midnight tonight um i will say
 
01:21:09.270 --> 01:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
there's another committee um uh
 
01:21:11.350 --> 01:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
commerce uh they asked me to print it
 
01:21:12.709 --> 01:21:12.719 align:start position:0%
the day of just so that they know where
 
01:21:14.470 --> 01:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
it stands at the time which i'm happy to
 
01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:15.990 align:start position:0%
it stands at the time which i'm happy to
do

01:21:15.990 --> 01:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:21:18.950 --> 01:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:21.430 --> 01:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
that would be useful sure it might also
 
01:21:23.830 --> 01:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
be useful for you to speak to the folks
 
01:21:25.990 --> 01:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
in committee services to ask if they
 
01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:26.870 align:start position:0%
in committee services to ask if they
could

01:21:26.870 --> 01:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:21:29.189 --> 01:21:29.199 align:start position:0%
figure out a way to make this to get
 
01:21:31.830 --> 01:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
that to you data available online so
 
01:21:33.910 --> 01:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
that it could be easily accessible we
 
01:21:35.990 --> 01:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
have a whole bunch of folks who want to
 
01:21:38.229 --> 01:21:38.239 align:start position:0%
make a comment about this
 
01:21:41.030 --> 01:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
representative thomas thank you i i
 
01:21:43.910 --> 01:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
agree with you i i i is my desire to
 
01:21:46.550 --> 01:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
follow commerce's um
 
01:21:48.790 --> 01:21:48.800 align:start position:0%
way and and have something in writing
 
01:21:50.950 --> 01:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
for our public hearing at least
 
01:21:53.189 --> 01:21:53.199 align:start position:0%
we know where we stand at that time i
 
01:21:54.550 --> 01:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
think it'd be very helpful yeah
 
01:21:57.510 --> 01:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely i can do that
 
01:21:59.910 --> 01:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
um other comments representative callie
 
01:22:03.030 --> 01:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
pitts yeah i you know i i guess where
 
01:22:05.430 --> 01:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
people are coming from
 
01:22:08.950 --> 01:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
is important but i have never heard or
 
01:22:11.350 --> 01:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
understood that there was a rule that
 
01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
limited testimony to new hampshire
 
01:22:15.990 --> 01:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
residents we usually give precedence to
 
01:22:17.669 --> 01:22:17.679 align:start position:0%
new hampshire residents
 
01:22:20.629 --> 01:22:20.639 align:start position:0%
and how we weigh it is up to us
 
01:22:24.709 --> 01:22:24.719 align:start position:0%
but testimony can come in from anywhere
 
01:22:28.149 --> 01:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
as far as i know so where it comes from
 
01:22:30.709 --> 01:22:30.719 align:start position:0%
if it's a legitimate source
 
01:22:32.870 --> 01:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
an expert source or whatever i i don't
 
01:22:35.189 --> 01:22:35.199 align:start position:0%
think that's
 
01:22:35.199 --> 01:22:37.590 align:start position:0%
think that's
relevant

01:22:37.590 --> 01:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
relevant
 
01:22:39.270 --> 01:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
01:22:40.950 --> 01:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
representative nader did you have a
 
01:22:43.270 --> 01:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
further comment um yes and i i
 
01:22:46.310 --> 01:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
understand uh what the representative um
 
01:22:48.550 --> 01:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
means because uh you're right we have
 
01:22:51.590 --> 01:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
people that fly in to testify but um
 
01:22:53.350 --> 01:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
last year the reason i was wondering
 
01:22:54.709 --> 01:22:54.719 align:start position:0%
about this where they're from is because
 
01:22:56.790 --> 01:22:56.800 align:start position:0%
last year we just had this unreasonable
 
01:22:59.270 --> 01:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
amount of numbers coming in these people
 
01:23:01.590 --> 01:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
signing names and just hundreds of them
 
01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
from from where
 
01:23:05.189 --> 01:23:05.199 align:start position:0%
and we didn't know and it was just a
 
01:23:07.750 --> 01:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
ridiculous amount
 
01:23:09.270 --> 01:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
01:23:10.709 --> 01:23:10.719 align:start position:0%
representative stop said you have a
 
01:23:12.870 --> 01:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you mr chairman i
 
01:23:15.430 --> 01:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
actually i i want to just
 
01:23:17.189 --> 01:23:17.199 align:start position:0%
underscore what uh
 
01:23:20.070 --> 01:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
representation said about uh that every
 
01:23:22.070 --> 01:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
anyone can submit testimony to us just
 
01:23:24.629 --> 01:23:24.639 align:start position:0%
like they can come in and sign the blue
 
01:23:26.870 --> 01:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
sheet the big difference is
 
01:23:29.030 --> 01:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
on the blue sheet we know who they were
 
01:23:30.790 --> 01:23:30.800 align:start position:0%
and where the where they live or where
 
01:23:32.709 --> 01:23:32.719 align:start position:0%
they come from it's it's okay to make
 
01:23:34.790 --> 01:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
testimony from anywhere but we should
 
01:23:36.870 --> 01:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
know that when we're when we're hearing
 
01:23:39.270 --> 01:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
a bill and if it's a hundred people
 
01:23:41.669 --> 01:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
signing in and 50 of them are from out
 
01:23:43.910 --> 01:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
of state they can do it but we should
 
01:23:45.990 --> 01:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
know that so it would be good to have
 
01:23:49.189 --> 01:23:49.199 align:start position:0%
that documented
 
01:23:50.870 --> 01:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
so kristin anything you can do to help
 
01:23:53.270 --> 01:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
us get that information would be
 
01:23:55.510 --> 01:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
gratefully appreciated i can get you if
 
01:23:56.790 --> 01:23:56.800 align:start position:0%
you want i can run up and get the print
 
01:23:59.189 --> 01:23:59.199 align:start position:0%
out of what i just did but the numbers
 
01:23:59.199 --> 01:24:00.790 align:start position:0%
out of what i just did but the numbers
are

01:24:00.790 --> 01:24:00.800 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:24:02.709 --> 01:24:02.719 align:start position:0%
i can get that for you either way um i
 
01:24:05.510 --> 01:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
can go get that now and i will get you
 
01:24:07.270 --> 01:24:07.280 align:start position:0%
the ones for this afternoon
 
01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:08.390 align:start position:0%
the ones for this afternoon
um

01:24:08.390 --> 01:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:10.070 --> 01:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
it looks like there will be a time for
 
01:24:12.709 --> 01:24:12.719 align:start position:0%
me to do that by 12 30. so that would be
 
01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
appreciated thank you i know last year
 
01:24:19.510 --> 01:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
we got that print out
 
01:24:22.229 --> 01:24:22.239 align:start position:0%
before our public hearing started now
 
01:24:27.270 --> 01:24:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:28.870 --> 01:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
the sign ends
 
01:24:30.709 --> 01:24:30.719 align:start position:0%
yeah in the morning or the night so this
 
01:24:32.550 --> 01:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
is so it's different this year because
 
01:24:33.590 --> 01:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
we allow
 
01:24:35.910 --> 01:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
sign-ins until midnight right but
 
01:24:38.149 --> 01:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
nevertheless if we could have some sense
 
01:24:40.629 --> 01:24:40.639 align:start position:0%
of what the online sign-ins looked like
 
01:24:42.310 --> 01:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
during the public hearing that would be
 
01:24:44.070 --> 01:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
that would be useful representative
 
01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:46.229 align:start position:0%
that would be useful representative
partial

01:24:46.229 --> 01:24:46.239 align:start position:0%
partial
 
01:24:47.669 --> 01:24:47.679 align:start position:0%
thank you again for taking my question
 
01:24:47.679 --> 01:24:48.629 align:start position:0%
thank you again for taking my question
chair

01:24:48.629 --> 01:24:48.639 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:24:50.310 --> 01:24:50.320 align:start position:0%
uh we were having a discussion about
 
01:24:52.149 --> 01:24:52.159 align:start position:0%
this very thing when the sign-in cuts
 
01:24:52.159 --> 01:24:53.270 align:start position:0%
this very thing when the sign-in cuts
off

01:24:53.270 --> 01:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
off
 
01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:54.870 align:start position:0%
off
and

01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:24:56.790 --> 01:24:56.800 align:start position:0%
one of the questions that i had is why
 
01:24:59.590 --> 01:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
can't we have the sign ins cut off
 
01:25:01.990 --> 01:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
on the day that we exec the bill
 
01:25:04.149 --> 01:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
that will be able to get the broadest
 
01:25:07.669 --> 01:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
sample possible of people who like to
 
01:25:10.149 --> 01:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
either support or oppose the bill
 
01:25:12.310 --> 01:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
i don't know why we have to sign off on
 
01:25:13.830 --> 01:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
the day
 
01:25:16.390 --> 01:25:16.400 align:start position:0%
the hearings close
 
01:25:17.910 --> 01:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
and if you have i mean
 
01:25:19.350 --> 01:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
this could be a rhetorical question or
 
01:25:20.629 --> 01:25:20.639 align:start position:0%
it could be a serious question i don't
 
01:25:20.639 --> 01:25:21.590 align:start position:0%
it could be a serious question i don't
know

01:25:21.590 --> 01:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:25:23.990 --> 01:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
maybe kristen you could ask committee
 
01:25:26.149 --> 01:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
services why they chose to do it the way
 
01:25:29.030 --> 01:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
they're doing it today and uh bring us
 
01:25:30.870 --> 01:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
an answer sure
 
01:25:32.709 --> 01:25:32.719 align:start position:0%

very simple
 
03:36:31.510 --> 03:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
language uh we don't need this bill uh
 
03:36:34.070 --> 03:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
this commission anymore the original
 
03:36:36.309 --> 03:36:36.319 align:start position:0%
intent of this commission
 
03:36:38.710 --> 03:36:38.720 align:start position:0%
was to oversee the um
 
03:36:38.720 --> 03:36:39.910 align:start position:0%
was to oversee the um
uh

03:36:39.910 --> 03:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:36:42.550 --> 03:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
the change in the in the utilities to
 
03:36:44.870 --> 03:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
divest themselves of their of the energy
 
03:36:44.880 --> 03:36:47.269 align:start position:0%
divest themselves of their of the energy
producing

03:36:47.269 --> 03:36:47.279 align:start position:0%
producing
 
03:36:49.590 --> 03:36:49.600 align:start position:0%
plants they had and that was completed a
 
03:36:51.030 --> 03:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago
 
03:36:53.750 --> 03:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
there was an attempt to perhaps change
 
03:36:53.760 --> 03:36:55.030 align:start position:0%
there was an attempt to perhaps change
the

03:36:55.030 --> 03:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:36:58.150 --> 03:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
purpose of this committee but in reality
 
03:37:00.309 --> 03:37:00.319 align:start position:0%
there's been no meetings held on this
 
03:37:01.590 --> 03:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
commission for
 
03:37:03.670 --> 03:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
at least a year and a half
 
03:37:05.910 --> 03:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
there really is i see no need for this
 
03:37:07.990 --> 03:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
commission to exist any longer we have a
 
03:37:10.309 --> 03:37:10.319 align:start position:0%
lot of others coming after us here for
 
03:37:12.469 --> 03:37:12.479 align:start position:0%
other purposes that are far more
 
03:37:14.469 --> 03:37:14.479 align:start position:0%
pertinent and important
 
03:37:18.229 --> 03:37:18.239 align:start position:0%
so my my recommendation is that we just
 
03:37:20.790 --> 03:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
repeal this committee and allow room for
 
03:37:22.309 --> 03:37:22.319 align:start position:0%
others to take place that are going to
 
03:37:23.670 --> 03:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
be much more
 
03:37:26.150 --> 03:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
important for the you know coming times
 
03:37:28.070 --> 03:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
that's that's all i have to say
 
03:37:29.590 --> 03:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:37:31.670 --> 03:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative thomas for your
 
03:37:33.349 --> 03:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
testimony on this bill are there
 
03:37:35.349 --> 03:37:35.359 align:start position:0%
questions for representative thomas
 
03:37:37.349 --> 03:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
representative flett is recognized for a
 
03:37:39.190 --> 03:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you i'll just point
 
03:37:40.870 --> 03:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
out a minor edit you might want to
 
03:37:40.880 --> 03:37:41.990 align:start position:0%
out a minor edit you might want to
consider

03:37:41.990 --> 03:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
consider
 
03:37:44.550 --> 03:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
with uh
 
03:37:47.030 --> 03:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
on page on line four and five we
 
03:37:48.790 --> 03:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
scratched out to the legislative
 
03:37:49.910 --> 03:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
oversight committee to monitor the
 
03:37:51.750 --> 03:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
transformation deliver electric services
 
03:37:54.389 --> 03:37:54.399 align:start position:0%
established under iris whatever the word
 
03:37:57.349 --> 03:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
two got struck out you need it
 
03:37:59.670 --> 03:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
so so it should so the two should stay
 
03:38:02.229 --> 03:38:02.239 align:start position:0%
in there so beginning in 2009 to the
 
03:38:04.309 --> 03:38:04.319 align:start position:0%
house science technology energy
 
03:38:06.630 --> 03:38:06.640 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question and yes i
 
03:38:08.790 --> 03:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
agree we can undo the strikeout of the
 
03:38:08.800 --> 03:38:09.990 align:start position:0%
agree we can undo the strikeout of the
t.o

03:38:09.990 --> 03:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
t.o
 
03:38:14.469 --> 03:38:14.479 align:start position:0%
i think that's all okay uh
 
03:38:15.990 --> 03:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts is
 
03:38:18.870 --> 03:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
 
03:38:21.269 --> 03:38:21.279 align:start position:0%
representative thomas having served on
 
03:38:23.269 --> 03:38:23.279 align:start position:0%
that committee
 
03:38:23.279 --> 03:38:25.190 align:start position:0%
that committee
for

03:38:25.190 --> 03:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:38:26.870 --> 03:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
some years
 
03:38:26.880 --> 03:38:29.670 align:start position:0%
some years
uh

03:38:29.670 --> 03:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:32.469 --> 03:38:32.479 align:start position:0%
nothing has met for a year and a half
 
03:38:34.150 --> 03:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
we've been kind of dormant for a year
 
03:38:35.349 --> 03:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
and a half
 
03:38:37.110 --> 03:38:37.120 align:start position:0%
and it's very hard to get it together
 
03:38:40.229 --> 03:38:40.239 align:start position:0%
but the purpose i think of this
 
03:38:40.239 --> 03:38:42.070 align:start position:0%
but the purpose i think of this
committee

03:38:42.070 --> 03:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:38:44.070 --> 03:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
was to
 
03:38:47.750 --> 03:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
be able to independently call
 
03:38:50.790 --> 03:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
a study on a particular issue or delve
 
03:38:52.950 --> 03:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
into an issue that needed to be
 
03:38:55.510 --> 03:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
delved into i don't know if you were
 
03:38:57.590 --> 03:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
here when the committee was very active
 
03:39:00.070 --> 03:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
but we would bring quite a few experts
 
03:39:02.229 --> 03:39:02.239 align:start position:0%
in to talk to us from the and they would
 
03:39:02.239 --> 03:39:03.189 align:start position:0%
in to talk to us from the and they would
come

03:39:03.189 --> 03:39:03.199 align:start position:0%
come
 
03:39:04.870 --> 03:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
because they were very interested in
 
03:39:06.870 --> 03:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
what the oversight committee had to do
 
03:39:09.269 --> 03:39:09.279 align:start position:0%
for recommendations and reports
 
03:39:11.830 --> 03:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
in the last few years i understand it
 
03:39:13.910 --> 03:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
waned a little bit and then in the last
 
03:39:15.750 --> 03:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
year and a half you know everything's
 
03:39:18.469 --> 03:39:18.479 align:start position:0%
gone but i i think that it's very
 
03:39:21.429 --> 03:39:21.439 align:start position:0%
important to have a committee
 
03:39:23.349 --> 03:39:23.359 align:start position:0%
that can be independent of this
 
03:39:23.359 --> 03:39:24.790 align:start position:0%
that can be independent of this
committee

03:39:24.790 --> 03:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:39:26.790 --> 03:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
and not bring
 
03:39:28.790 --> 03:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
20 people in
 
03:39:31.750 --> 03:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
but be able to keep pulse on issues that
 
03:39:34.150 --> 03:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
are important and the same way that the
 
03:39:36.950 --> 03:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
science and technical committee can we
 
03:39:38.469 --> 03:39:38.479 align:start position:0%
can put
 
03:39:40.389 --> 03:39:40.399 align:start position:0%
refer things to
 
03:39:42.950 --> 03:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
the electric oversight committee
 
03:39:44.389 --> 03:39:44.399 align:start position:0%
representative would you say
 
03:39:44.399 --> 03:39:46.389 align:start position:0%
representative would you say
representative

03:39:46.389 --> 03:39:46.399 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:39:49.269 --> 03:39:49.279 align:start position:0%
okay would you say that this committee
 
03:39:52.070 --> 03:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
if it stays on the books
 
03:39:54.469 --> 03:39:54.479 align:start position:0%
is costing any money
 
03:39:56.550 --> 03:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
or doing any
 
03:40:00.070 --> 03:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:02.309 --> 03:40:02.319 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question i'm a
 
03:40:04.150 --> 03:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
firm believer that if nothing is
 
03:40:05.349 --> 03:40:05.359 align:start position:0%
happening with something that's
 
03:40:07.510 --> 03:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
established that we
 
03:40:10.150 --> 03:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have it because what one thing
 
03:40:12.389 --> 03:40:12.399 align:start position:0%
is that if these are on the books we
 
03:40:14.229 --> 03:40:14.239 align:start position:0%
still have to assign people on that
 
03:40:16.550 --> 03:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
commission or or committee that takes
 
03:40:18.389 --> 03:40:18.399 align:start position:0%
some valuable resources
 
03:40:20.630 --> 03:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
and it's just it's just another one of
 
03:40:22.469 --> 03:40:22.479 align:start position:0%
the over 400
 
03:40:24.309 --> 03:40:24.319 align:start position:0%
committees and commissions that we have
 
03:40:25.670 --> 03:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
here in the state which are very
 
03:40:27.590 --> 03:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
difficult to fill all of them and some
 
03:40:29.189 --> 03:40:29.199 align:start position:0%
of them in fact have been around for a
 
03:40:30.870 --> 03:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
long long time we keep wondering why
 
03:40:33.349 --> 03:40:33.359 align:start position:0%
they're still here
 
03:40:35.750 --> 03:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
i just believe that if there is a
 
03:40:35.760 --> 03:40:37.429 align:start position:0%
i just believe that if there is a
special

03:40:37.429 --> 03:40:37.439 align:start position:0%
special
 
03:40:39.750 --> 03:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
presentation that has to be made this
 
03:40:41.670 --> 03:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
committee could certainly invite those
 
03:40:43.269 --> 03:40:43.279 align:start position:0%
people to come here and make a special
 
03:40:45.189 --> 03:40:45.199 align:start position:0%
presentation we don't have to have have
 
03:40:47.189 --> 03:40:47.199 align:start position:0%
a committee for that
 
03:40:49.910 --> 03:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
so as an answer to your question is
 
03:40:51.750 --> 03:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
why keep something on the books when we
 
03:40:53.830 --> 03:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
really don't have a useful use for it
 
03:40:56.389 --> 03:40:56.399 align:start position:0%
and the original intent of it really has
 
03:40:57.750 --> 03:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
gone away so
 
03:40:59.189 --> 03:40:59.199 align:start position:0%
that's that's why i'm proposing this
 
03:40:59.199 --> 03:41:00.550 align:start position:0%
that's that's why i'm proposing this
bill

03:41:00.550 --> 03:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:41:02.070 --> 03:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts i'm going to
 
03:41:04.150 --> 03:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
let you follow up but i will remind you
 
03:41:07.189 --> 03:41:07.199 align:start position:0%
that we're here to ask questions not to
 
03:41:10.070 --> 03:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
debate or discuss this issue
 
03:41:10.080 --> 03:41:11.349 align:start position:0%
debate or discuss this issue
well

03:41:11.349 --> 03:41:11.359 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:41:14.229 --> 03:41:14.239 align:start position:0%
the other the other thing i would say is
 
03:41:16.070 --> 03:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
in your opinion
 
03:41:18.229 --> 03:41:18.239 align:start position:0%
would it be more expensive to have a
 
03:41:18.239 --> 03:41:19.349 align:start position:0%
would it be more expensive to have a
committee

03:41:19.349 --> 03:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:41:22.950 --> 03:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
of 20 or 21 people come in
 
03:41:24.710 --> 03:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
or 22 people
 
03:41:26.710 --> 03:41:26.720 align:start position:0%
than have a subcommittee
 
03:41:28.870 --> 03:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
of five or six come in to delve into
 
03:41:30.630 --> 03:41:30.640 align:start position:0%
some of these issues that really take
 
03:41:30.640 --> 03:41:33.510 align:start position:0%
some of these issues that really take
time

03:41:33.510 --> 03:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:35.110 --> 03:41:35.120 align:start position:0%
well i don't know what issues you're
 
03:41:37.269 --> 03:41:37.279 align:start position:0%
talking about but and thank you for the
 
03:41:38.710 --> 03:41:38.720 align:start position:0%
question because
 
03:41:40.630 --> 03:41:40.640 align:start position:0%
if there was a special issue that came
 
03:41:40.640 --> 03:41:41.349 align:start position:0%
if there was a special issue that came
up

03:41:41.349 --> 03:41:41.359 align:start position:0%
up
 
03:41:43.269 --> 03:41:43.279 align:start position:0%
and this committee is already meeting on
 
03:41:45.590 --> 03:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
a day where we maybe have an extra hour
 
03:41:47.269 --> 03:41:47.279 align:start position:0%
uh we're already being paid for coming
 
03:41:48.630 --> 03:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
here for that day so we might as well
 
03:41:51.269 --> 03:41:51.279 align:start position:0%
hear a one-hour presentation on on on
 
03:41:52.469 --> 03:41:52.479 align:start position:0%
some issue i don't think we need to have
 
03:41:55.030 --> 03:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
a special subcommittee to to to delve
 
03:41:56.950 --> 03:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
into a to a
 
03:41:59.269 --> 03:41:59.279 align:start position:0%
a special interest that that wants to
 
03:42:01.670 --> 03:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
come in here so again
 
03:42:03.590 --> 03:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at all the committees we
 
03:42:05.990 --> 03:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
have on the books and a lot of them
 
03:42:08.469 --> 03:42:08.479 align:start position:0%
haven't met in well over a year
 
03:42:10.229 --> 03:42:10.239 align:start position:0%
this is one of them and we have all the
 
03:42:12.389 --> 03:42:12.399 align:start position:0%
committee i mean i'm on the offshore win
 
03:42:14.469 --> 03:42:14.479 align:start position:0%
commission which is very valuable right
 
03:42:16.630 --> 03:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
now we have the easy board that's very
 
03:42:19.030 --> 03:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
valuable um i think we we have enough
 
03:42:19.040 --> 03:42:20.070 align:start position:0%
valuable um i think we we have enough
mediums

03:42:20.070 --> 03:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
mediums
 
03:42:22.710 --> 03:42:22.720 align:start position:0%
involving this this type committee
 
03:42:24.150 --> 03:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
than to have one that's been sitting
 
03:42:26.710 --> 03:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
dormant for a while
 
03:42:29.269 --> 03:42:29.279 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee is recognized thank
 
03:42:30.950 --> 03:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman and thank you for taking
 
03:42:32.150 --> 03:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
my question
 
03:42:36.309 --> 03:42:36.319 align:start position:0%
um when i look at the bill it
 
03:42:38.150 --> 03:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
your description makes it sound as
 
03:42:39.830 --> 03:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
though this i think what you're saying
 
03:42:41.910 --> 03:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
is that this was a result of the
 
03:42:44.389 --> 03:42:44.399 align:start position:0%
restructuring so it was it was
 
03:42:47.030 --> 03:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
originally put together in order to sort
 
03:42:48.790 --> 03:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
of deal with the questions that came
 
03:42:51.429 --> 03:42:51.439 align:start position:0%
with a restructured energy market
 
03:42:53.750 --> 03:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
but in the language of the bill itself
 
03:42:56.630 --> 03:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
there are sections and the first section
 
03:42:56.640 --> 03:42:57.990 align:start position:0%
there are sections and the first section
um

03:42:57.990 --> 03:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:01.030 --> 03:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
is the renewable energy fund
 
03:43:02.309 --> 03:43:02.319 align:start position:0%
and there's always a lot of questions
 
03:43:04.070 --> 03:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
around that and then
 
03:43:07.510 --> 03:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
pollute pollutant reduction program
 
03:43:10.309 --> 03:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
carbon dioxide emission budget for those
 
03:43:12.550 --> 03:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
trade programs so it seems like there
 
03:43:15.750 --> 03:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
are a lot of other discussion items here
 
03:43:17.670 --> 03:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
that have come out since
 
03:43:19.990 --> 03:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
restructuring happened so we may not
 
03:43:22.790 --> 03:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
need what we needed back then
 
03:43:24.790 --> 03:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
but i don't think the
 
03:43:27.269 --> 03:43:27.279 align:start position:0%
issues that are even listed here uh as
 
03:43:28.790 --> 03:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
being part of the purvey of that
 
03:43:28.800 --> 03:43:30.229 align:start position:0%
being part of the purvey of that
committee

03:43:30.229 --> 03:43:30.239 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:43:31.990 --> 03:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
are gone so
 
03:43:33.830 --> 03:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
is there a question here yeah so the
 
03:43:35.110 --> 03:43:35.120 align:start position:0%
question is
 
03:43:36.550 --> 03:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
you're saying we don't need this
 
03:43:39.510 --> 03:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
committee and i'm saying
 
03:43:41.750 --> 03:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
do you have a description of the
 
03:43:43.429 --> 03:43:43.439 align:start position:0%
questions that this committee would be
 
03:43:45.910 --> 03:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
concerning itself with today
 
03:43:47.510 --> 03:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't seem like energy
 
03:43:50.070 --> 03:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
questions have gone away in terms of
 
03:43:50.080 --> 03:43:51.269 align:start position:0%
questions have gone away in terms of
needing

03:43:51.269 --> 03:43:51.279 align:start position:0%
needing
 
03:43:54.469 --> 03:43:54.479 align:start position:0%
people who are overseeing them
 
03:43:57.189 --> 03:43:57.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
03:43:59.030 --> 03:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
my opinion is we don't need this
 
03:44:01.590 --> 03:44:01.600 align:start position:0%
committee if we want to talk about a
 
03:44:04.389 --> 03:44:04.399 align:start position:0%
particular issue that's coming up in
 
03:44:06.950 --> 03:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
today's you know trending issues we
 
03:44:08.389 --> 03:44:08.399 align:start position:0%
certainly could arrange time during this
 
03:44:10.950 --> 03:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
committee to hear a presentation and i
 
03:44:12.389 --> 03:44:12.399 align:start position:0%
think the proof in the pudding is the
 
03:44:13.510 --> 03:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
fact that
 
03:44:15.510 --> 03:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
no one has seen fit to call a committee
 
03:44:18.070 --> 03:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
meeting of this nature for well over a
 
03:44:19.349 --> 03:44:19.359 align:start position:0%
year and a half
 
03:44:20.950 --> 03:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
and i don't believe keeping things on
 
03:44:21.910 --> 03:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
the books
 
03:44:23.990 --> 03:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
just in case something was to happen is
 
03:44:25.990 --> 03:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
a good way to manage business here like
 
03:44:27.670 --> 03:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
i said we have a lot of commissions and
 
03:44:29.590 --> 03:44:29.600 align:start position:0%
committees that are kind of in the same
 
03:44:29.600 --> 03:44:30.389 align:start position:0%
committees that are kind of in the same
boat

03:44:30.389 --> 03:44:30.399 align:start position:0%
boat
 
03:44:31.750 --> 03:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
and i think you'll see other bills
 
03:44:33.590 --> 03:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
coming through that are trying to just
 
03:44:34.630 --> 03:44:34.640 align:start position:0%
clean up
 
03:44:36.150 --> 03:44:36.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of these committees that just
 
03:44:38.389 --> 03:44:38.399 align:start position:0%
haven't seen a need to meet even those
 
03:44:39.750 --> 03:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
there may be issues out there there are
 
03:44:41.750 --> 03:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
other ways to uh deal with them this
 
03:44:44.309 --> 03:44:44.319 align:start position:0%
committee isn't one of them
 
03:44:46.150 --> 03:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
do you need a follow-up
 
03:44:48.070 --> 03:44:48.080 align:start position:0%
i would love to but i don't want to
 
03:44:50.150 --> 03:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
argue with the witness because i don't i
 
03:44:51.510 --> 03:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
don't see it that way
 
03:44:53.429 --> 03:44:53.439 align:start position:0%
i don't see that there's another forum
 
03:44:55.830 --> 03:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
for this to be happening so
 
03:44:57.110 --> 03:44:57.120 align:start position:0%
i would just disagree with the
 
03:44:58.870 --> 03:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
conclusion but i don't think i have
 
03:45:00.070 --> 03:45:00.080 align:start position:0%
another question that would lead me
 
03:45:02.550 --> 03:45:02.560 align:start position:0%
anywhere thank you thank you
 
03:45:05.110 --> 03:45:05.120 align:start position:0%
uh representative bernardi is recognized
 
03:45:06.630 --> 03:45:06.640 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
03:45:09.110 --> 03:45:09.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh
 
03:45:13.269 --> 03:45:13.279 align:start position:0%
rep representative thomas uh the
 
03:45:16.389 --> 03:45:16.399 align:start position:0%
the bill calls for an annual report uh
 
03:45:18.229 --> 03:45:18.239 align:start position:0%
the first of october has has there been
 
03:45:20.309 --> 03:45:20.319 align:start position:0%
an annual report last year or the year
 
03:45:20.319 --> 03:45:22.550 align:start position:0%
an annual report last year or the year
before

03:45:22.550 --> 03:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
before
 
03:45:24.150 --> 03:45:24.160 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware thank you for the question
 
03:45:25.510 --> 03:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of the year before but
 
03:45:27.110 --> 03:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
there wasn't one last year to my
 
03:45:27.120 --> 03:45:28.229 align:start position:0%
there wasn't one last year to my
knowledge

03:45:28.229 --> 03:45:28.239 align:start position:0%
knowledge
 
03:45:29.670 --> 03:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
at least there hasn't been one presented
 
03:45:30.950 --> 03:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
to this committee
 
03:45:32.870 --> 03:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
and i doubt that there'll be one this
 
03:45:34.870 --> 03:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
year as well
 
03:45:37.750 --> 03:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
i think a point that can be made is
 
03:45:41.030 --> 03:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
up until last term this
 
03:45:42.550 --> 03:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
committee was the purpose of this
 
03:45:44.710 --> 03:45:44.720 align:start position:0%
committee was for the restructuring
 
03:45:44.720 --> 03:45:45.750 align:start position:0%
committee was for the restructuring
and

03:45:45.750 --> 03:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:45:47.590 --> 03:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
there was a bill passed to kind of
 
03:45:49.269 --> 03:45:49.279 align:start position:0%
change the intent of this committee
 
03:45:51.429 --> 03:45:51.439 align:start position:0%
because they didn't want to you know
 
03:45:53.670 --> 03:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
i guess people didn't want to not see
 
03:45:56.150 --> 03:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
each other again but but
 
03:45:57.750 --> 03:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
but after that was done
 
03:46:00.469 --> 03:46:00.479 align:start position:0%
nothing was ever held and so i just
 
03:46:02.630 --> 03:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
don't see a reason for having a
 
03:46:04.870 --> 03:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
commission if something if if a new
 
03:46:06.229 --> 03:46:06.239 align:start position:0%
commission wants to be made for a
 
03:46:08.630 --> 03:46:08.640 align:start position:0%
specific issue then perhaps a bill can
 
03:46:11.110 --> 03:46:11.120 align:start position:0%
come along next year to propose one but
 
03:46:13.750 --> 03:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
this one here i think is it's it's
 
03:46:15.269 --> 03:46:15.279 align:start position:0%
run the length of its life i think it's
 
03:46:17.590 --> 03:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
time to retire it and just go on to you
 
03:46:19.990 --> 03:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
know newer things
 
03:46:21.510 --> 03:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:46:23.670 --> 03:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
follow up no
 
03:46:26.309 --> 03:46:26.319 align:start position:0%
all right uh representative uh samsic is
 
03:46:26.319 --> 03:46:29.349 align:start position:0%
all right uh representative uh samsic is
recognized

03:46:29.349 --> 03:46:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:31.349 --> 03:46:31.359 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
03:46:33.590 --> 03:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
03:46:36.469 --> 03:46:36.479 align:start position:0%
representative thomas um just to be
 
03:46:38.389 --> 03:46:38.399 align:start position:0%
clear um
 
03:46:42.150 --> 03:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
can you explain to me in your own words
 
03:46:45.269 --> 03:46:45.279 align:start position:0%
what you perceive as being the real
 
03:46:47.349 --> 03:46:47.359 align:start position:0%
purpose of this oversight committee that
 
03:46:49.110 --> 03:46:49.120 align:start position:0%
we're trying to get rid of now what was
 
03:46:51.830 --> 03:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
its initial real purpose i know we've
 
03:46:54.870 --> 03:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
heard okay here and there but
 
03:46:56.710 --> 03:46:56.720 align:start position:0%
it's an oversight committee so what was
 
03:46:58.150 --> 03:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
it overseeing
 
03:46:58.160 --> 03:46:59.590 align:start position:0%
it overseeing
specifically

03:46:59.590 --> 03:46:59.600 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
03:47:01.750 --> 03:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question
 
03:47:04.630 --> 03:47:04.640 align:start position:0%
and i only have my own words so i will
 
03:47:07.510 --> 03:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
i i will say that uh when i first came
 
03:47:10.389 --> 03:47:10.399 align:start position:0%
in here they were still talking about
 
03:47:12.950 --> 03:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
how the divestiture was going to
 
03:47:12.960 --> 03:47:14.229 align:start position:0%
how the divestiture was going to
ultimately

03:47:14.229 --> 03:47:14.239 align:start position:0%
ultimately
 
03:47:16.550 --> 03:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh play out and that was and what i
 
03:47:18.469 --> 03:47:18.479 align:start position:0%
heard time and time again
 
03:47:20.070 --> 03:47:20.080 align:start position:0%
for the few years i was here at first
 
03:47:21.110 --> 03:47:21.120 align:start position:0%
was that
 
03:47:23.670 --> 03:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
that they that was why it was formed the
 
03:47:25.189 --> 03:47:25.199 align:start position:0%
researcher happened
 
03:47:28.150 --> 03:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
sale was made we're well into a
 
03:47:28.160 --> 03:47:30.870 align:start position:0%
sale was made we're well into a
post-divestiture

03:47:30.870 --> 03:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
post-divestiture
 
03:47:33.910 --> 03:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
era and so uh
 
03:47:35.910 --> 03:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this original committee
 
03:47:38.389 --> 03:47:38.399 align:start position:0%
was served they they did the oversight
 
03:47:41.030 --> 03:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
it was done uh there's no more
 
03:47:43.030 --> 03:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
divestiture to oversee
 
03:47:45.590 --> 03:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
and to extend the life of this committee
 
03:47:48.630 --> 03:47:48.640 align:start position:0%
for other reasons that might come up
 
03:47:50.469 --> 03:47:50.479 align:start position:0%
this is just a housekeeping as far as
 
03:47:53.110 --> 03:47:53.120 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned and like i said if there's
 
03:47:54.870 --> 03:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
a specific purpose
 
03:47:56.870 --> 03:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
next year that they see that we have to
 
03:47:58.389 --> 03:47:58.399 align:start position:0%
have a committee they can certainly
 
03:48:00.309 --> 03:48:00.319 align:start position:0%
propose one for that specific purpose
 
03:48:00.319 --> 03:48:01.349 align:start position:0%
propose one for that specific purpose
but

03:48:01.349 --> 03:48:01.359 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:48:03.590 --> 03:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
i think this like i said this commission
 
03:48:05.750 --> 03:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
this committee has run its course and we
 
03:48:07.269 --> 03:48:07.279 align:start position:0%
just get it off the books so we can go
 
03:48:09.670 --> 03:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
on to other committees
 
03:48:11.590 --> 03:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
03:48:12.950 --> 03:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
03:48:15.750 --> 03:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
just a quick question on page two
 
03:48:17.990 --> 03:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh can you explain to me the
 
03:48:20.309 --> 03:48:20.319 align:start position:0%
the two repeals that are done there what
 
03:48:22.150 --> 03:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
what is being repealed there
 
03:48:24.070 --> 03:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
i have to admit thank you again for the
 
03:48:27.830 --> 03:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
question i uh be because of the
 
03:48:29.830 --> 03:48:29.840 align:start position:0%
nature of of i was here during the
 
03:48:31.990 --> 03:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
original part of the bill
 
03:48:34.389 --> 03:48:34.399 align:start position:0%
i don't have that in front of me if you
 
03:48:34.399 --> 03:48:35.269 align:start position:0%
i don't have that in front of me if you
could

03:48:35.269 --> 03:48:35.279 align:start position:0%
could
 
03:48:37.269 --> 03:48:37.279 align:start position:0%
relate what those two repeals are it
 
03:48:39.349 --> 03:48:39.359 align:start position:0%
might chug my memory yes well one one
 
03:48:41.110 --> 03:48:41.120 align:start position:0%
says relative to
 
03:48:42.870 --> 03:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
the oversights committee to monitor the
 
03:48:45.510 --> 03:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
transmission of delivery of electric
 
03:48:45.520 --> 03:48:46.630 align:start position:0%
transmission of delivery of electric
service

03:48:46.630 --> 03:48:46.640 align:start position:0%
service
 
03:48:49.590 --> 03:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
and the other one is um
 
03:48:51.110 --> 03:48:51.120 align:start position:0%
oversight commitment to monitor the
 
03:48:53.189 --> 03:48:53.199 align:start position:0%
transformation of the delivery of
 
03:48:54.630 --> 03:48:54.640 align:start position:0%
electric service
 
03:48:57.269 --> 03:48:57.279 align:start position:0%
to the public utilities commission
 
03:49:01.030 --> 03:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
and the department of energy so
 
03:49:01.040 --> 03:49:02.070 align:start position:0%
and the department of energy so
um

03:49:02.070 --> 03:49:02.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:04.630 --> 03:49:04.640 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how that repeal affects
 
03:49:04.640 --> 03:49:05.830 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how that repeal affects
things

03:49:05.830 --> 03:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
things
 
03:49:07.429 --> 03:49:07.439 align:start position:0%
is that well i thank you for the
 
03:49:09.990 --> 03:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
question i i in this particular case i
 
03:49:11.910 --> 03:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
believe there is a department of energy
 
03:49:14.229 --> 03:49:14.239 align:start position:0%
person here that is going to follow me i
 
03:49:15.750 --> 03:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
would defer that question to that
 
03:49:15.760 --> 03:49:18.790 align:start position:0%
would defer that question to that
department

03:49:18.790 --> 03:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:20.469 --> 03:49:20.479 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:49:22.950 --> 03:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
further questions for the bill sponsor
 
03:49:25.189 --> 03:49:25.199 align:start position:0%
representative plett is recognized yes
 
03:49:27.110 --> 03:49:27.120 align:start position:0%
this is a clerk question
 
03:49:31.269 --> 03:49:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:31.279 --> 03:49:32.150 align:start position:0%
 
uh

03:49:32.150 --> 03:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:49:32.160 --> 03:49:33.990 align:start position:0%
uh
divestiture

03:49:33.990 --> 03:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
divestiture
 
03:49:35.830 --> 03:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
divestiture of what was that the
 
03:49:38.870 --> 03:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
separation of generation generally from
 
03:49:41.590 --> 03:49:41.600 align:start position:0%
the utilities or was that specific to
 
03:49:41.600 --> 03:49:43.030 align:start position:0%
the utilities or was that specific to
seabrook

03:49:43.030 --> 03:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
seabrook
 
03:49:44.870 --> 03:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question uh your
 
03:49:44.880 --> 03:49:46.309 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question uh your
first

03:49:46.309 --> 03:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
first
 
03:49:48.710 --> 03:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
intent was correct it was the visitor of
 
03:49:51.030 --> 03:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
all electrical generating stations from
 
03:49:54.070 --> 03:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
utilities in this case you know
 
03:49:57.429 --> 03:49:57.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:59.189 --> 03:49:59.199 align:start position:0%
plant that belonged to a utility was
 
03:50:01.590 --> 03:50:01.600 align:start position:0%
divested and put to the general private
 
03:50:01.600 --> 03:50:03.189 align:start position:0%
divested and put to the general private
market

03:50:03.189 --> 03:50:03.199 align:start position:0%
market
 
03:50:04.550 --> 03:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:50:05.590 --> 03:50:05.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:50:07.510 --> 03:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
okay representative pementel is
 
03:50:09.750 --> 03:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question thank you mr
 
03:50:11.030 --> 03:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
chairman uh
 
03:50:13.189 --> 03:50:13.199 align:start position:0%
thank you representative thomas
 
03:50:16.630 --> 03:50:16.640 align:start position:0%
for answering our questions um
 
03:50:19.349 --> 03:50:19.359 align:start position:0%
i i see that basically the all you're
 
03:50:21.429 --> 03:50:21.439 align:start position:0%
doing is taking
 
03:50:24.550 --> 03:50:24.560 align:start position:0%
out the legislative oversight committee
 
03:50:27.510 --> 03:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:29.590 --> 03:50:29.600 align:start position:0%
that's easy to understand
 
03:50:29.600 --> 03:50:30.950 align:start position:0%
that's easy to understand
but

03:50:30.950 --> 03:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:50:33.110 --> 03:50:33.120 align:start position:0%
the house science technology and energy
 
03:50:34.710 --> 03:50:34.720 align:start position:0%
committee are still in there
 
03:50:36.389 --> 03:50:36.399 align:start position:0%
the senate committee
 
03:50:38.389 --> 03:50:38.399 align:start position:0%
and natural resources committee are
 
03:50:39.990 --> 03:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
still in there
 
03:50:40.000 --> 03:50:41.110 align:start position:0%
still in there
and

03:50:41.110 --> 03:50:41.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:50:42.710 --> 03:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
it looks like we were supposed to see a
 
03:50:45.990 --> 03:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
report on october 1st of this year
 
03:50:48.630 --> 03:50:48.640 align:start position:0%
and i'm not really sure
 
03:50:52.150 --> 03:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
if that ever happened and there was also
 
03:50:54.870 --> 03:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
someone was supposed to do a report by
 
03:50:56.790 --> 03:50:56.800 align:start position:0%
june 30th
 
03:50:56.800 --> 03:50:58.070 align:start position:0%
june 30th
um

03:50:58.070 --> 03:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:00.630 --> 03:51:00.640 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm just wondering
 
03:51:05.110 --> 03:51:05.120 align:start position:0%
um do you know why any of these reports
 
03:51:06.950 --> 03:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
weren't done is there
 
03:51:09.349 --> 03:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
somewhere and somebody in the loop was
 
03:51:11.910 --> 03:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
wasn't uh
 
03:51:13.830 --> 03:51:13.840 align:start position:0%
calling these reports or making sure
 
03:51:16.229 --> 03:51:16.239 align:start position:0%
that they're done
 
03:51:17.670 --> 03:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question if you're
 
03:51:17.680 --> 03:51:19.030 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question if you're
referring

03:51:19.030 --> 03:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
referring
 
03:51:20.790 --> 03:51:20.800 align:start position:0%
to the part where there were other
 
03:51:23.750 --> 03:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
agencies that were originally providing
 
03:51:26.710 --> 03:51:26.720 align:start position:0%
reports to the oversight committee
 
03:51:28.309 --> 03:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
the answer is
 
03:51:29.910 --> 03:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
since i no longer think we have the
 
03:51:32.710 --> 03:51:32.720 align:start position:0%
oversight committee's purpose
 
03:51:34.790 --> 03:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
those reports were
 
03:51:36.550 --> 03:51:36.560 align:start position:0%
should have come straight to the science
 
03:51:38.070 --> 03:51:38.080 align:start position:0%
and tech committee as i think the
 
03:51:39.990 --> 03:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
original bill had in there
 
03:51:42.309 --> 03:51:42.319 align:start position:0%
i can't speak for other
 
03:51:44.229 --> 03:51:44.239 align:start position:0%
agencies that may or may not have you
 
03:51:47.030 --> 03:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
know given reports yet that that would
 
03:51:53.349 --> 03:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:53.359 --> 03:51:54.710 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

03:51:54.710 --> 03:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:51:56.830 --> 03:51:56.840 align:start position:0%
um i i
 
03:52:00.630 --> 03:52:00.640 align:start position:0%
guess well i guess i'd like to know um
 
03:52:02.469 --> 03:52:02.479 align:start position:0%
why we're not getting these reports and
 
03:52:03.910 --> 03:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if you
 
03:52:06.790 --> 03:52:06.800 align:start position:0%
have the knowledge to know
 
03:52:06.800 --> 03:52:07.590 align:start position:0%
have the knowledge to know
uh

03:52:07.590 --> 03:52:07.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:52:10.790 --> 03:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
whose responsibility it was to get these
 
03:52:13.030 --> 03:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
reports to us
 
03:52:15.510 --> 03:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
so that we can
 
03:52:17.030 --> 03:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
we can get them right
 
03:52:19.030 --> 03:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
obviously the legislature wanted us to
 
03:52:20.070 --> 03:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
have them
 
03:52:20.080 --> 03:52:21.110 align:start position:0%
have them
so

03:52:21.110 --> 03:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:52:23.269 --> 03:52:23.279 align:start position:0%
where are they
 
03:52:25.349 --> 03:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for the good question uh
 
03:52:25.359 --> 03:52:28.870 align:start position:0%
thank you for the good question uh
if

03:52:28.870 --> 03:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:30.710 --> 03:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
those reports are
 
03:52:32.229 --> 03:52:32.239 align:start position:0%
that from other agencies are supposed to
 
03:52:34.229 --> 03:52:34.239 align:start position:0%
be sent to the chair of the science and
 
03:52:37.189 --> 03:52:37.199 align:start position:0%
tech committee if we didn't get them
 
03:52:38.790 --> 03:52:38.800 align:start position:0%
it would be up to us to go back and find
 
03:52:40.950 --> 03:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
out where they are but with everything
 
03:52:43.349 --> 03:52:43.359 align:start position:0%
going on as was so eloquently stated
 
03:52:43.359 --> 03:52:44.630 align:start position:0%
going on as was so eloquently stated
before

03:52:44.630 --> 03:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
before
 
03:52:46.469 --> 03:52:46.479 align:start position:0%
i'm sure there are some things that may
 
03:52:47.750 --> 03:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
have fallen through the crack but i
 
03:52:48.950 --> 03:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
think that's something that we could
 
03:52:50.389 --> 03:52:50.399 align:start position:0%
check on as to why we haven't gotten
 
03:52:52.550 --> 03:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
some of those reports
 
03:52:54.550 --> 03:52:54.560 align:start position:0%
representative plett is recognized for a
 
03:52:56.710 --> 03:52:56.720 align:start position:0%
question could it be that the reports
 
03:52:58.550 --> 03:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
would have no content whatsoever because
 
03:52:59.910 --> 03:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
nothing was
 
03:53:02.150 --> 03:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
uh transpired yeah
 
03:53:03.830 --> 03:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question if i had
 
03:53:06.229 --> 03:53:06.239 align:start position:0%
every if i had to re write a report on
 
03:53:08.710 --> 03:53:08.720 align:start position:0%
to this on this existing commission that
 
03:53:10.469 --> 03:53:10.479 align:start position:0%
we're trying to eliminate
 
03:53:12.550 --> 03:53:12.560 align:start position:0%
my words would have been no action in
 
03:53:15.429 --> 03:53:15.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:19.110 --> 03:53:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:21.429 --> 03:53:21.439 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund
 
03:53:23.670 --> 03:53:23.680 align:start position:0%
report was sent to this committee by
 
03:53:25.030 --> 03:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
august 1st
 
03:53:26.630 --> 03:53:26.640 align:start position:0%
of this year every member of this
 
03:53:31.030 --> 03:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:32.870 --> 03:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
so that one
 
03:53:35.429 --> 03:53:35.439 align:start position:0%
in particular i know we received we also
 
03:53:37.670 --> 03:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
received a report
 
03:53:39.990 --> 03:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
about reggie which is
 
03:53:43.030 --> 03:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
section four of the bill
 
03:53:45.030 --> 03:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
the only one i'm unsure about would be
 
03:53:46.950 --> 03:53:46.960 align:start position:0%
section two of the bill multiple
 
03:53:49.189 --> 03:53:49.199 align:start position:0%
pollutant reduction program
 
03:53:50.389 --> 03:53:50.399 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
03:53:52.070 --> 03:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
remember off the top of my head if we
 
03:53:54.630 --> 03:53:54.640 align:start position:0%
received a report from from that uh
 
03:53:58.710 --> 03:53:58.720 align:start position:0%
organization but it's likely that we did
 
03:54:00.229 --> 03:54:00.239 align:start position:0%
you can all go back and review your
 
03:54:02.070 --> 03:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
inbox to see
 
03:54:03.990 --> 03:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
what kind of goodies might be residing
 
03:54:04.000 --> 03:54:05.269 align:start position:0%
what kind of goodies might be residing
there

03:54:05.269 --> 03:54:05.279 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:54:06.630 --> 03:54:06.640 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts is
 
03:54:06.640 --> 03:54:10.309 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts is

chairman
 
03:55:14.630 --> 03:55:14.640 align:start position:0%
okay this is this is interesting
 
03:55:14.640 --> 03:55:15.429 align:start position:0%
okay this is this is interesting
um

03:55:15.429 --> 03:55:15.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:18.389 --> 03:55:18.399 align:start position:0%
from what the uh chairman just mentioned
 
03:55:20.469 --> 03:55:20.479 align:start position:0%
about the two reports that we did
 
03:55:20.479 --> 03:55:21.670 align:start position:0%
about the two reports that we did
receive

03:55:21.670 --> 03:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
receive
 
03:55:21.680 --> 03:55:22.550 align:start position:0%
receive
um

03:55:22.550 --> 03:55:22.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:24.389 --> 03:55:24.399 align:start position:0%
it sounds as though these are reports
 
03:55:25.990 --> 03:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
that we do
 
03:55:28.710 --> 03:55:28.720 align:start position:0%
actually rely on and expect to recede
 
03:55:31.750 --> 03:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
receive in terms of the renewable energy
 
03:55:33.349 --> 03:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
fund and what has happened in the
 
03:55:35.830 --> 03:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
preceding year and also the regional
 
03:55:38.389 --> 03:55:38.399 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas initiatives information
 
03:55:39.830 --> 03:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
and what has happened in the preceding
 
03:55:43.269 --> 03:55:43.279 align:start position:0%
year so how will that be accomplished
 
03:55:43.279 --> 03:55:44.229 align:start position:0%
year so how will that be accomplished
if

03:55:44.229 --> 03:55:44.239 align:start position:0%
if
 
03:55:46.550 --> 03:55:46.560 align:start position:0%
if there is no oversight
 
03:55:48.229 --> 03:55:48.239 align:start position:0%
with members of the legislature at the
 
03:55:48.239 --> 03:55:50.070 align:start position:0%
with members of the legislature at the
helm

03:55:50.070 --> 03:55:50.080 align:start position:0%
helm
 
03:55:51.830 --> 03:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question i
 
03:55:51.840 --> 03:55:52.870 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question i
believe

03:55:52.870 --> 03:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
believe
 
03:55:55.189 --> 03:55:55.199 align:start position:0%
i previously stated that those reports
 
03:55:57.670 --> 03:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
are sent directly to the chair of the
 
03:56:00.150 --> 03:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
science and tech committee and certainly
 
03:56:01.670 --> 03:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
they're send out to everybody on the
 
03:56:04.309 --> 03:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
committee for their information in my
 
03:56:06.469 --> 03:56:06.479 align:start position:0%
time on this committee
 
03:56:09.750 --> 03:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
i do not recall any time where any of
 
03:56:11.110 --> 03:56:11.120 align:start position:0%
those reports
 
03:56:13.269 --> 03:56:13.279 align:start position:0%
have been discussed or brought up in
 
03:56:16.550 --> 03:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:18.389 --> 03:56:18.399 align:start position:0%
i just don't remember any time
 
03:56:20.630 --> 03:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
so i think it's handled by the fact that
 
03:56:21.990 --> 03:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
they're sent to everyone and for their
 
03:56:23.670 --> 03:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
information to use and
 
03:56:25.030 --> 03:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
for them to uh
 
03:56:26.790 --> 03:56:26.800 align:start position:0%
to to read but i don't believe there's
 
03:56:29.349 --> 03:56:29.359 align:start position:0%
any action required on this committee to
 
03:56:31.429 --> 03:56:31.439 align:start position:0%
to actually review those reports and
 
03:56:32.950 --> 03:56:32.960 align:start position:0%
make a comment on them here unless
 
03:56:34.790 --> 03:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
someone feels a need to but
 
03:56:37.670 --> 03:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
that's a follow-up no need
 
03:56:40.950 --> 03:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
follow-up so if this goes through and
 
03:56:42.950 --> 03:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
the and this language is repealed then
 
03:56:45.990 --> 03:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
do we stop getting those reports
 
03:56:47.750 --> 03:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i i don't
 
03:56:50.070 --> 03:56:50.080 align:start position:0%
believe if you if if you're reading the
 
03:56:52.469 --> 03:56:52.479 align:start position:0%
the amendment to the bill or the bill as
 
03:56:55.590 --> 03:56:55.600 align:start position:0%
as as amended those reports
 
03:56:58.309 --> 03:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
were being forwarded to the oversight
 
03:57:01.429 --> 03:57:01.439 align:start position:0%
committee and to the chair of science
 
03:57:02.710 --> 03:57:02.720 align:start position:0%
and tech
 
03:57:05.030 --> 03:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
the biggest amendment that i made on it
 
03:57:08.070 --> 03:57:08.080 align:start position:0%
was there was one there was one report
 
03:57:10.070 --> 03:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
that was not being sent to the chair of
 
03:57:12.710 --> 03:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
science and tech and i added that to
 
03:57:15.510 --> 03:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
ensure that all those reports were being
 
03:57:17.510 --> 03:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
sent to the science and tech committee
 
03:57:21.110 --> 03:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
for everyone to see here so you know
 
03:57:23.269 --> 03:57:23.279 align:start position:0%
nothing would be lost by by repealing
 
03:57:24.790 --> 03:57:24.800 align:start position:0%
this committee nothing would be lost
 
03:57:26.389 --> 03:57:26.399 align:start position:0%
those reports would still be sent to
 
03:57:29.349 --> 03:57:29.359 align:start position:0%
every member of science and tech
 
03:57:31.990 --> 03:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
thank you just to clarify
 
03:57:34.550 --> 03:57:34.560 align:start position:0%
the legislation does specify
 
03:57:36.950 --> 03:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
that the reports go to
 
03:57:38.950 --> 03:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
the house science technology and energy
 
03:57:40.550 --> 03:57:40.560 align:start position:0%
committee it's nothing it says nothing
 
03:57:42.950 --> 03:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
about going to the chairman okay
 
03:57:44.790 --> 03:57:44.800 align:start position:0%
except of course that the chairman is a
 
03:57:46.870 --> 03:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
member of the committee but it should go
 
03:57:49.349 --> 03:57:49.359 align:start position:0%
to every member of the committee just
 
03:57:51.429 --> 03:57:51.439 align:start position:0%
point of clarification representative
 
03:57:53.349 --> 03:57:53.359 align:start position:0%
samsich is recognized for a question
 
03:57:55.189 --> 03:57:55.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
03:57:57.590 --> 03:57:57.600 align:start position:0%
representative thomas uh well now that
 
03:57:59.590 --> 03:57:59.600 align:start position:0%
we know that you you are the chairman of
 
03:58:01.590 --> 03:58:01.600 align:start position:0%
this oversight committee
 
03:58:03.510 --> 03:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
and you haven't called a meeting in the
 
03:58:04.870 --> 03:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
last what
 
03:58:06.870 --> 03:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
19 months or whatever's
 
03:58:08.950 --> 03:58:08.960 align:start position:0%
did you notify the members of that
 
03:58:11.189 --> 03:58:11.199 align:start position:0%
committee that you were planning to ask
 
03:58:13.429 --> 03:58:13.439 align:start position:0%
to dissolve this committee
 
03:58:14.630 --> 03:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
and wouldn't
 
03:58:16.309 --> 03:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
these reports we were talking about
 
03:58:17.990 --> 03:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that have been material that
 
03:58:20.070 --> 03:58:20.080 align:start position:0%
you would you would have been normally
 
03:58:21.910 --> 03:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
discussing in that oversight committee
 
03:58:26.309 --> 03:58:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:27.429 --> 03:58:27.439 align:start position:0%
well uh
 
03:58:29.429 --> 03:58:29.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
03:58:31.510 --> 03:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
i i would assume that as a chair of
 
03:58:33.590 --> 03:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
committee it would be up to me to come
 
03:58:35.110 --> 03:58:35.120 align:start position:0%
up with an agenda
 
03:58:36.710 --> 03:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
i don't recall
 
03:58:39.349 --> 03:58:39.359 align:start position:0%
those reports being specifically part of
 
03:58:41.110 --> 03:58:41.120 align:start position:0%
any agenda in the committee in the
 
03:58:43.349 --> 03:58:43.359 align:start position:0%
previous times although the information
 
03:58:44.790 --> 03:58:44.800 align:start position:0%
from them may have been used for
 
03:58:46.710 --> 03:58:46.720 align:start position:0%
people's information to discuss other
 
03:58:48.309 --> 03:58:48.319 align:start position:0%
other matters
 
03:58:50.870 --> 03:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
but i looked at the background
 
03:58:52.950 --> 03:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
i haven't been the i haven't been a
 
03:58:54.309 --> 03:58:54.319 align:start position:0%
chair of the
 
03:58:57.030 --> 03:58:57.040 align:start position:0%
dormant committee for as long as 19
 
03:58:58.950 --> 03:58:58.960 align:start position:0%
months because i think i i've we've only
 
03:59:00.309 --> 03:59:00.319 align:start position:0%
been here for a year
 
03:59:03.910 --> 03:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
uh so prior to my tenure uh the uh there
 
03:59:05.510 --> 03:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
was a previous chair of that committee
 
03:59:07.110 --> 03:59:07.120 align:start position:0%
i'm not quite sure who it was at the
 
03:59:10.150 --> 03:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
time and that there was no zoom meeting
 
03:59:11.830 --> 03:59:11.840 align:start position:0%
called or any other meeting called on
 
03:59:13.910 --> 03:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
that committee as well so when i looked
 
03:59:16.469 --> 03:59:16.479 align:start position:0%
at that background and i looked at the
 
03:59:16.479 --> 03:59:17.510 align:start position:0%
at that background and i looked at the
future

03:59:17.510 --> 03:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
future
 
03:59:19.830 --> 03:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
i just saw no need to to have this
 
03:59:19.840 --> 03:59:21.510 align:start position:0%
i just saw no need to to have this
committee

03:59:21.510 --> 03:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:59:24.150 --> 03:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
the lsr was in public view for quite
 
03:59:26.389 --> 03:59:26.399 align:start position:0%
some time no one contacted me
 
03:59:29.349 --> 03:59:29.359 align:start position:0%
voicing any question or opposition to it
 
03:59:32.710 --> 03:59:32.720 align:start position:0%
and it again is just my opinion that
 
03:59:35.510 --> 03:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
we have no need for this committee to to
 
03:59:38.790 --> 03:59:38.800 align:start position:0%
exist and i see no need at this point to
 
03:59:41.189 --> 03:59:41.199 align:start position:0%
call for one um
 
03:59:42.790 --> 03:59:42.800 align:start position:0%
because we're dealing with other matters
 
03:59:44.150 --> 03:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
right now then other and there are other
 
03:59:45.429 --> 03:59:45.439 align:start position:0%
committees out there that are are
 
03:59:46.710 --> 03:59:46.720 align:start position:0%
handling things
 
03:59:46.720 --> 03:59:47.429 align:start position:0%
handling things
so

03:59:47.429 --> 03:59:47.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:59:51.189 --> 03:59:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:52.790 --> 03:59:52.800 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
03:59:54.790 --> 03:59:54.800 align:start position:0%
any further questions for representative
 
03:59:56.550 --> 03:59:56.560 align:start position:0%
thomas representative partial has a
 
03:59:56.560 --> 03:59:58.469 align:start position:0%
thomas representative partial has a
question

03:59:58.469 --> 03:59:58.479 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:00:00.229 --> 04:00:00.239 align:start position:0%
yes i hope this does oh thank you uh
 
04:00:00.239 --> 04:00:01.030 align:start position:0%
yes i hope this does oh thank you uh
chair

04:00:01.030 --> 04:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:00:03.349 --> 04:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
and thank you uh for your testimony hope
 
04:00:05.189 --> 04:00:05.199 align:start position:0%
this is not a tangential question but
 
04:00:07.269 --> 04:00:07.279 align:start position:0%
being a sophomore here i feel like i'd
 
04:00:08.950 --> 04:00:08.960 align:start position:0%
ask a very sophomore question and that
 
04:00:08.960 --> 04:00:10.070 align:start position:0%
ask a very sophomore question and that
concerns

04:00:10.070 --> 04:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
04:00:12.790 --> 04:00:12.800 align:start position:0%
uh griffin roberge's uh testimony uh
 
04:00:14.550 --> 04:00:14.560 align:start position:0%
written testimony i assume he will speak
 
04:00:15.750 --> 04:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
to it later
 
04:00:15.760 --> 04:00:16.790 align:start position:0%
to it later
uh

04:00:16.790 --> 04:00:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:00:18.710 --> 04:00:18.720 align:start position:0%
and he has uh pointed out that there is
 
04:00:21.429 --> 04:00:21.439 align:start position:0%
a house bill 1269
 
04:00:22.630 --> 04:00:22.640 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
04:00:24.950 --> 04:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
also addresses the structure of this
 
04:00:26.229 --> 04:00:26.239 align:start position:0%
same committee
 
04:00:28.150 --> 04:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
and it's uh they speak of a
 
04:00:30.630 --> 04:00:30.640 align:start position:0%
restructuring rather than dissolving of
 
04:00:31.750 --> 04:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
04:00:33.429 --> 04:00:33.439 align:start position:0%
and i would just
 
04:00:33.770 --> 04:00:33.780 align:start position:0%
like to
 
04:00:33.780 --> 04:00:35.349 align:start position:0%
like to
[Music]

04:00:35.349 --> 04:00:35.359 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:00:37.830 --> 04:00:37.840 align:start position:0%
if you're aware of that or not i'd like
 
04:00:39.110 --> 04:00:39.120 align:start position:0%
you to just
 
04:00:40.309 --> 04:00:40.319 align:start position:0%
call it to your attention and perhaps
 
04:00:42.950 --> 04:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
you have some thoughts on that
 
04:00:45.110 --> 04:00:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question uh what i
 
04:00:47.349 --> 04:00:47.359 align:start position:0%
am aware of is that mr roberge told me
 
04:00:49.510 --> 04:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
the other day that he would be speaking
 
04:00:51.189 --> 04:00:51.199 align:start position:0%
on this bill and mentioning that there
 
04:00:54.790 --> 04:00:54.800 align:start position:0%
were other bills coming that would um
 
04:00:56.630 --> 04:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
i thought he said it would do away with
 
04:00:56.640 --> 04:00:57.510 align:start position:0%
i thought he said it would do away with
this

04:00:57.510 --> 04:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:00:59.429 --> 04:00:59.439 align:start position:0%
this and other committees
 
04:01:01.990 --> 04:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
so uh to fully answer that question i
 
04:01:03.349 --> 04:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
would ask that you defer that question
 
04:01:05.590 --> 04:01:05.600 align:start position:0%
to mr roberge when he comes up to speak
 
04:01:06.870 --> 04:01:06.880 align:start position:0%
i would be glad to do that i just want
 
04:01:08.070 --> 04:01:08.080 align:start position:0%
to have if you have the opportunity
 
04:01:09.590 --> 04:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
should you have anything on that thank
 
04:01:12.630 --> 04:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
you for chair no follow-up
 
04:01:14.950 --> 04:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative berezni is
 
04:01:16.710 --> 04:01:16.720 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
 
04:01:18.309 --> 04:01:18.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
04:01:19.750 --> 04:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
representative thomas for taking my
 
04:01:22.710 --> 04:01:22.720 align:start position:0%
question um was the only purpose of this
 
04:01:24.950 --> 04:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
committee to read the reports and then
 
04:01:27.349 --> 04:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
provide another report to the governor
 
04:01:30.710 --> 04:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
and and back to the uh the
 
04:01:32.870 --> 04:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
department of energy uh thank you for
 
04:01:34.950 --> 04:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
the question uh no i don't think that
 
04:01:36.870 --> 04:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
was the only purpose of this committee
 
04:01:38.229 --> 04:01:38.239 align:start position:0%
uh although it might have been
 
04:01:39.830 --> 04:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
insinuated today
 
04:01:41.670 --> 04:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
but uh the
 
04:01:43.429 --> 04:01:43.439 align:start position:0%
again the main purpose of this committee
 
04:01:46.550 --> 04:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
was to oversee the divestiture and it
 
04:01:48.630 --> 04:01:48.640 align:start position:0%
was only in the last term that they
 
04:01:49.830 --> 04:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
changed the
 
04:01:51.269 --> 04:01:51.279 align:start position:0%
title and purpose
 
04:01:53.750 --> 04:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
to cover other matters that they thought
 
04:01:56.309 --> 04:01:56.319 align:start position:0%
might be coming up which
 
04:01:58.309 --> 04:01:58.319 align:start position:0%
never materialized in my previous
 
04:01:59.750 --> 04:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
successor or
 
04:02:01.110 --> 04:02:01.120 align:start position:0%
or me so
 
04:02:01.120 --> 04:02:03.590 align:start position:0%
or me so
again

04:02:03.590 --> 04:02:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:05.590 --> 04:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
it was a future purpose that just has
 
04:02:07.510 --> 04:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
materialized it's best that we get this
 
04:02:09.269 --> 04:02:09.279 align:start position:0%
off the books and go on to other
 
04:02:11.189 --> 04:02:11.199 align:start position:0%
committees like i said we have we have
 
04:02:14.469 --> 04:02:14.479 align:start position:0%
over 400 out there and many of them
 
04:02:16.550 --> 04:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
meet only once a year or haven't met at
 
04:02:19.110 --> 04:02:19.120 align:start position:0%
all so i think i think this is good
 
04:02:21.590 --> 04:02:21.600 align:start position:0%
housekeeping to make way for better
 
04:02:21.600 --> 04:02:23.030 align:start position:0%
housekeeping to make way for better
commissions

04:02:23.030 --> 04:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
04:02:25.030 --> 04:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up
 
04:02:27.030 --> 04:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
so other than generating reports what
 
04:02:30.150 --> 04:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
other actions could this committee take
 
04:02:30.160 --> 04:02:31.590 align:start position:0%
other actions could this committee take
right

04:02:31.590 --> 04:02:31.600 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:02:33.910 --> 04:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
well i'll be honest with you uh thanks
 
04:02:36.710 --> 04:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
for the question at this time i if if i
 
04:02:38.389 --> 04:02:38.399 align:start position:0%
thought there was a burning issue that
 
04:02:39.910 --> 04:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
had to be discussed in a separate
 
04:02:39.920 --> 04:02:41.030 align:start position:0%
had to be discussed in a separate
committee

04:02:41.030 --> 04:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:02:42.870 --> 04:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
i probably would have called one by now
 
04:02:44.950 --> 04:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
but i just didn't see a need for
 
04:02:46.469 --> 04:02:46.479 align:start position:0%
anything right now
 
04:02:48.950 --> 04:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
the the fact that the doors are open to
 
04:02:51.349 --> 04:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
allow for issues to come up
 
04:02:52.550 --> 04:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily mean i'm going to
 
04:02:54.469 --> 04:02:54.479 align:start position:0%
call a meeting together just for people
 
04:02:56.469 --> 04:02:56.479 align:start position:0%
to come here and
 
04:02:58.389 --> 04:02:58.399 align:start position:0%
talk about something that
 
04:03:00.710 --> 04:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
uh maybe we may be discussing in other
 
04:03:03.670 --> 04:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
bills or or or other commissions
 
04:03:05.349 --> 04:03:05.359 align:start position:0%
i know that right now the hot topic is
 
04:03:06.870 --> 04:03:06.880 align:start position:0%
offshore a win and we certainly have a
 
04:03:08.150 --> 04:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
commission for that
 
04:03:08.160 --> 04:03:09.349 align:start position:0%
commission for that
so

04:03:09.349 --> 04:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:03:11.269 --> 04:03:11.279 align:start position:0%
the answer your question is i i just
 
04:03:13.269 --> 04:03:13.279 align:start position:0%
don't see a need under under this
 
04:03:15.590 --> 04:03:15.600 align:start position:0%
committee to call one for just the sake
 
04:03:19.429 --> 04:03:19.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:21.110 --> 04:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:03:23.189 --> 04:03:23.199 align:start position:0%
any further questions for
 
04:03:26.950 --> 04:03:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:29.349 --> 04:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
representative mann has a question thank
 
04:03:30.870 --> 04:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman
 
04:03:33.590 --> 04:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
i hope to be somewhat up
 
04:03:35.670 --> 04:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
articulate with this
 
04:03:37.189 --> 04:03:37.199 align:start position:0%
i thought that
 
04:03:40.389 --> 04:03:40.399 align:start position:0%
one of the possible futures of
 
04:03:43.349 --> 04:03:43.359 align:start position:0%
in terms of restructuring might be
 
04:03:46.309 --> 04:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
that the utilities themselves would take
 
04:03:46.319 --> 04:03:47.349 align:start position:0%
that the utilities themselves would take
on

04:03:47.349 --> 04:03:47.359 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:03:49.830 --> 04:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
the responsibility to
 
04:03:49.840 --> 04:03:51.030 align:start position:0%
the responsibility to
either

04:03:51.030 --> 04:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
either
 
04:03:53.189 --> 04:03:53.199 align:start position:0%
deliver electricity or
 
04:03:55.990 --> 04:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
deliver energy efficiency services to
 
04:03:56.000 --> 04:03:57.670 align:start position:0%
deliver energy efficiency services to
customers

04:03:57.670 --> 04:03:57.680 align:start position:0%
customers
 
04:04:00.070 --> 04:04:00.080 align:start position:0%
there being basically two ways of
 
04:04:02.150 --> 04:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
meeting demand
 
04:04:03.269 --> 04:04:03.279 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:04:07.110 --> 04:04:07.120 align:start position:0%
this could possibly be a future
 
04:04:09.429 --> 04:04:09.439 align:start position:0%
uh role for this committee
 
04:04:11.910 --> 04:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
because you know and it could be
 
04:04:14.150 --> 04:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
certainly possible that if
 
04:04:16.469 --> 04:04:16.479 align:start position:0%
it's going to be in but would be in the
 
04:04:19.349 --> 04:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
utilities hands to decide and to run
 
04:04:21.910 --> 04:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
both aspects of this
 
04:04:24.950 --> 04:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
future um
 
04:04:27.349 --> 04:04:27.359 align:start position:0%
is there a question energy system would
 
04:04:27.359 --> 04:04:29.269 align:start position:0%
is there a question energy system would
uh

04:04:29.269 --> 04:04:29.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:04:31.189 --> 04:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
would this committee possible in your
 
04:04:34.870 --> 04:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
view be a useful place to
 
04:04:34.880 --> 04:04:37.189 align:start position:0%
view be a useful place to
to

04:04:37.189 --> 04:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:39.750 --> 04:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
assign the task of
 
04:04:39.760 --> 04:04:41.349 align:start position:0%
assign the task of
monitoring

04:04:41.349 --> 04:04:41.359 align:start position:0%
monitoring
 
04:04:43.750 --> 04:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
how the utilities are
 
04:04:46.630 --> 04:04:46.640 align:start position:0%
balancing both of these kinds of ways of
 
04:04:49.189 --> 04:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
meeting demand
 
04:04:51.110 --> 04:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i i don't
 
04:04:51.120 --> 04:04:52.070 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i i don't
know

04:04:52.070 --> 04:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:04:54.950 --> 04:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
if we want to have a committee for that
 
04:04:56.950 --> 04:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
purpose that might not otherwise be
 
04:04:59.110 --> 04:04:59.120 align:start position:0%
covered by having a presentation by the
 
04:05:01.590 --> 04:05:01.600 align:start position:0%
utilities in front of us to cover that
 
04:05:05.429 --> 04:05:05.439 align:start position:0%
one subject but i would also
 
04:05:08.070 --> 04:05:08.080 align:start position:0%
perhaps think that it might be an
 
04:05:10.870 --> 04:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
agenda item that could be discussed
 
04:05:12.710 --> 04:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
with the easy board as well
 
04:05:12.720 --> 04:05:13.910 align:start position:0%
with the easy board as well
so

04:05:13.910 --> 04:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:05:15.429 --> 04:05:15.439 align:start position:0%
i think there are other avenues that
 
04:05:17.189 --> 04:05:17.199 align:start position:0%
that we could discuss these
 
04:05:18.790 --> 04:05:18.800 align:start position:0%
these issues of that nature that these
 
04:05:20.710 --> 04:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
are not
 
04:05:22.150 --> 04:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
having a separate commission for a lot
 
04:05:26.150 --> 04:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
of these things sometimes just it's just
 
04:05:27.590 --> 04:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
not worth it in my mind when we have
 
04:05:29.269 --> 04:05:29.279 align:start position:0%
other avenues that we can just discuss
 
04:05:30.950 --> 04:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
those issues
 
04:05:33.670 --> 04:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:33.680 --> 04:05:34.630 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:05:34.630 --> 04:05:34.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:05:37.110 --> 04:05:37.120 align:start position:0%

have back before the messenger actually
happened

04:06:23.910 --> 04:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
i think i was on that board for about
 
04:06:26.630 --> 04:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
two years
 
04:06:28.630 --> 04:06:28.640 align:start position:0%

i i have a
 
04:06:31.670 --> 04:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
for the chair
 
04:06:31.680 --> 04:06:32.469 align:start position:0%
for the chair
yes

04:06:32.469 --> 04:06:32.479 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:06:32.479 --> 04:06:33.269 align:start position:0%
yes
we

04:06:33.269 --> 04:06:33.279 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:06:37.349 --> 04:06:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:37.359 --> 04:06:38.790 align:start position:0%
 
nobody

04:06:38.790 --> 04:06:38.800 align:start position:0%
nobody
 
04:06:41.269 --> 04:06:41.279 align:start position:0%
has the experience or the understanding
 
04:06:42.790 --> 04:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
of what this committee was supposed to
 
04:06:42.800 --> 04:06:43.590 align:start position:0%
of what this committee was supposed to
do

04:06:43.590 --> 04:06:43.600 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:06:45.670 --> 04:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
and a few years ago
 
04:06:49.189 --> 04:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i am the older one i
 
04:06:49.199 --> 04:06:50.309 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i am the older one i
remember

04:06:50.309 --> 04:06:50.319 align:start position:0%
remember
 
04:06:52.229 --> 04:06:52.239 align:start position:0%
what it was supposed to do and what it
 
04:06:54.710 --> 04:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
was supposed to be continuing to do
 
04:06:57.269 --> 04:06:57.279 align:start position:0%
and it wasn't just to do divestiture
 
04:07:00.309 --> 04:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
when do i get an opportunity to say that
 
04:07:02.070 --> 04:07:02.080 align:start position:0%
what the history is behind this
 
04:07:04.150 --> 04:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
committee and what it's supposed to be
 
04:07:04.160 --> 04:07:05.670 align:start position:0%
committee and what it's supposed to be
doing

04:07:05.670 --> 04:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
doing
 
04:07:07.590 --> 04:07:07.600 align:start position:0%
well when we have an executive session
 
04:07:09.910 --> 04:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
we have discussions and that would be an
 
04:07:12.389 --> 04:07:12.399 align:start position:0%
appropriate time for you to
 
04:07:12.399 --> 04:07:13.590 align:start position:0%
appropriate time for you to
um

04:07:13.590 --> 04:07:13.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:15.750 --> 04:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
give us a history lesson expound on what
 
04:07:17.990 --> 04:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
if if you want what's your purposes
 
04:07:18.000 --> 04:07:18.870 align:start position:0%
if if you want what's your purposes
so

04:07:18.870 --> 04:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:07:21.429 --> 04:07:21.439 align:start position:0%
that would be the perfect time
 
04:07:23.750 --> 04:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee yes thank you mr
 
04:07:25.910 --> 04:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative
 
04:07:29.269 --> 04:07:29.279 align:start position:0%
thomas for taking my question um
 
04:07:31.269 --> 04:07:31.279 align:start position:0%
i get your point about not having
 
04:07:32.710 --> 04:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
committees just to have committees but
 
04:07:35.429 --> 04:07:35.439 align:start position:0%
when you mentioned easy board which i'm
 
04:07:37.269 --> 04:07:37.279 align:start position:0%
a speaker appointed member of the easy
 
04:07:37.279 --> 04:07:38.710 align:start position:0%
a speaker appointed member of the easy
board

04:07:38.710 --> 04:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
board
 
04:07:40.710 --> 04:07:40.720 align:start position:0%
there's also a bill that's going through
 
04:07:42.870 --> 04:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
to change what the easy board is doing
 
04:07:44.229 --> 04:07:44.239 align:start position:0%
which means that it would not be an
 
04:07:45.670 --> 04:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate place
 
04:07:48.070 --> 04:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
to have these conversations and i think
 
04:07:50.149 --> 04:07:50.159 align:start position:0%
that's what i've been trying to get at
 
04:07:50.159 --> 04:07:50.870 align:start position:0%
that's what i've been trying to get at
is

04:07:50.870 --> 04:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:07:53.269 --> 04:07:53.279 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned that there will be an
 
04:07:55.670 --> 04:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
insufficient place for the issues that
 
04:07:56.950 --> 04:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
are coming up
 
04:07:58.950 --> 04:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
uh since the divestiture with how the
 
04:08:01.429 --> 04:08:01.439 align:start position:0%
electorate markets are being are being
 
04:08:02.870 --> 04:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
managed in the state
 
04:08:04.950 --> 04:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
without an oversight committee that's
 
04:08:06.950 --> 04:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
specifically devoted to that
 
04:08:08.469 --> 04:08:08.479 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to mention the fact
 
04:08:08.479 --> 04:08:09.429 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to mention the fact
that

04:08:09.429 --> 04:08:09.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:08:11.750 --> 04:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
the easy board has recently been
 
04:08:13.830 --> 04:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
diminished in its role saying you know
 
04:08:16.309 --> 04:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
that they shouldn't be doing policy
 
04:08:18.389 --> 04:08:18.399 align:start position:0%
discussions there and it should be more
 
04:08:18.399 --> 04:08:19.189 align:start position:0%
discussions there and it should be more
about

04:08:19.189 --> 04:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:08:20.950 --> 04:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
telling people what energy efficiency
 
04:08:23.429 --> 04:08:23.439 align:start position:0%
can do and you know so our our role has
 
04:08:26.229 --> 04:08:26.239 align:start position:0%
recently been changed so that i don't
 
04:08:26.239 --> 04:08:27.510 align:start position:0%
recently been changed so that i don't
think

04:08:27.510 --> 04:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
think
 
04:08:29.429 --> 04:08:29.439 align:start position:0%
i don't think it would be able to assume
 
04:08:31.030 --> 04:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
the role of the oversight committee that
 
04:08:33.189 --> 04:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
that's just my point
 
04:08:34.630 --> 04:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
so what is the question thank you for
 
04:08:35.990 --> 04:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
the statement i was just wondering if
 
04:08:37.670 --> 04:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
you understood that because we did just
 
04:08:40.469 --> 04:08:40.479 align:start position:0%
have a bill recently that changed in in
 
04:08:43.670 --> 04:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
549 even the language changed um the
 
04:08:47.110 --> 04:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
role of the easy board
 
04:08:49.030 --> 04:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
well i'm not thank you for the question
 
04:08:51.670 --> 04:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
um i'm not
 
04:08:53.429 --> 04:08:53.439 align:start position:0%
extremely sure that i want to comment on
 
04:08:54.870 --> 04:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
someone else's bill
 
04:08:56.469 --> 04:08:56.479 align:start position:0%
uh what it might affect with with the
 
04:08:59.910 --> 04:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
easy board but i i will add that at one
 
04:09:02.229 --> 04:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
time when i was on the the oversight
 
04:09:04.630 --> 04:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
committee um and as my recollection
 
04:09:06.309 --> 04:09:06.319 align:start position:0%
comes into full focus i was actually
 
04:09:09.510 --> 04:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
vice chair of it for one term and i and
 
04:09:11.269 --> 04:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
i remember sitting through
 
04:09:14.389 --> 04:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
briefings and i remember the chair
 
04:09:16.229 --> 04:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
struggled to get people to come up in
 
04:09:18.309 --> 04:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
brief uh they're looking for things to
 
04:09:19.349 --> 04:09:19.359 align:start position:0%
breathe at
 
04:09:22.149 --> 04:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
and when you start having to look and
 
04:09:24.309 --> 04:09:24.319 align:start position:0%
struggle to bring
 
04:09:26.630 --> 04:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
people to speak on something because you
 
04:09:28.870 --> 04:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
have to have a meeting that month
 
04:09:30.469 --> 04:09:30.479 align:start position:0%
tells me that the life of that
 
04:09:32.950 --> 04:09:32.960 align:start position:0%
commission has is coming to its end and
 
04:09:34.630 --> 04:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
i think this commission has come to its
 
04:09:37.269 --> 04:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
end in that respect and like i said if
 
04:09:38.790 --> 04:09:38.800 align:start position:0%
there's something if we find that there
 
04:09:39.750 --> 04:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
is something
 
04:09:39.760 --> 04:09:40.630 align:start position:0%
is something
needed

04:09:40.630 --> 04:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
needed
 
04:09:42.469 --> 04:09:42.479 align:start position:0%
for other purposes
 
04:09:44.469 --> 04:09:44.479 align:start position:0%
i'm sure it can be brought up next year
 
04:09:46.790 --> 04:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
in a bill to establish a new purpose of
 
04:09:49.750 --> 04:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:51.830 --> 04:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative thomas i
 
04:09:53.030 --> 04:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
think we've
 
04:09:54.950 --> 04:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
exhausted the questions of the committee
 
04:09:56.870 --> 04:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
for you i
 
04:09:58.630 --> 04:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
really appreciate you introducing this
 
04:10:00.950 --> 04:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
bill and explaining it to us
 
04:10:05.590 --> 04:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:07.670 --> 04:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
mr griffin roberge from the department
 
04:10:09.110 --> 04:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
of energy for
 
04:10:11.670 --> 04:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
his take on
 
04:10:41.110 --> 04:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:42.469 --> 04:10:42.479 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon members of the
 
04:10:44.790 --> 04:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
committee uh for the record griffin
 
04:10:47.590 --> 04:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
roberge from the department of energy um
 
04:10:49.030 --> 04:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
i'll try to be a little bit slow in my
 
04:10:51.189 --> 04:10:51.199 align:start position:0%
introduction until my letter of
 
04:10:53.590 --> 04:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
testimony reaches its way around the
 
04:10:53.600 --> 04:10:55.590 align:start position:0%
testimony reaches its way around the
room

04:10:55.590 --> 04:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
room
 
04:10:57.349 --> 04:10:57.359 align:start position:0%
but here just to
 
04:10:59.510 --> 04:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
provide a note that the department is
 
04:11:01.670 --> 04:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
neutral on the bill however
 
04:11:03.189 --> 04:11:03.199 align:start position:0%
should the bill move forward there are a
 
04:11:05.910 --> 04:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
couple of housekeeping changes we wanted
 
04:11:08.710 --> 04:11:08.720 align:start position:0%
to suggest or just some observations for
 
04:11:10.950 --> 04:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
the committee to consider in
 
04:11:14.790 --> 04:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:15.990 --> 04:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
starting in
 
04:11:17.189 --> 04:11:17.199 align:start position:0%
if you're referencing my letter of
 
04:11:19.030 --> 04:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
written testimony
 
04:11:21.910 --> 04:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
i guess the department outlines four
 
04:11:24.469 --> 04:11:24.479 align:start position:0%
observations representative plett caught
 
04:11:28.309 --> 04:11:28.319 align:start position:0%
a fifth on line four but um on line 16
 
04:11:30.389 --> 04:11:30.399 align:start position:0%
there's just unfortunately a hanging tee
 
04:11:35.269 --> 04:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
just a very minor grammatical correction
 
04:11:37.110 --> 04:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
line 26
 
04:11:39.910 --> 04:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
this is pertaining to section
 
04:11:42.950 --> 04:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
3 of the bill
 
04:11:44.309 --> 04:11:44.319 align:start position:0%
it would require the department of
 
04:11:45.750 --> 04:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
environmental services and the public
 
04:11:47.990 --> 04:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
utilities commission to annually report
 
04:11:50.389 --> 04:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
to various committees on the status of
 
04:11:53.189 --> 04:11:53.199 align:start position:0%
the implementation of the
 
04:11:55.189 --> 04:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
regional greenhouse gas initiative or
 
04:11:55.199 --> 04:11:57.189 align:start position:0%
regional greenhouse gas initiative or
reggie

04:11:57.189 --> 04:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
reggie
 
04:11:58.790 --> 04:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
should the committee wish to move
 
04:12:01.670 --> 04:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
forward with house bill 1270 the
 
04:12:03.269 --> 04:12:03.279 align:start position:0%
department would suggest replacing
 
04:12:05.590 --> 04:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
commission with department of energy
 
04:12:07.910 --> 04:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
this is just a simple housekeeping
 
04:12:09.670 --> 04:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
measure due to the creation of the
 
04:12:12.309 --> 04:12:12.319 align:start position:0%
department of energy and hb2
 
04:12:13.830 --> 04:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of that staff has moved over from
 
04:12:15.349 --> 04:12:15.359 align:start position:0%
the public utilities commission to the
 
04:12:16.950 --> 04:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
department so it makes sense to have the
 
04:12:19.030 --> 04:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services
 
04:12:20.309 --> 04:12:20.319 align:start position:0%
and the department of energy working
 
04:12:22.870 --> 04:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
together to create this report
 
04:12:24.790 --> 04:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
that's one observation
 
04:12:27.590 --> 04:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
the last one is pertaining to
 
04:12:30.710 --> 04:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
one of the repeals in section four
 
04:12:33.349 --> 04:12:33.359 align:start position:0%
that's specifically page two
 
04:12:35.750 --> 04:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
line six to eight
 
04:12:39.030 --> 04:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
um as you'll see that repeals um a
 
04:12:41.670 --> 04:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
statute and i've provided in italics
 
04:12:44.389 --> 04:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
what the statute actually reads
 
04:12:46.870 --> 04:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
the statute that's being affected is the
 
04:12:48.710 --> 04:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
commission and the department shall
 
04:12:50.790 --> 04:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
submit a report to the legislative
 
04:12:52.710 --> 04:12:52.720 align:start position:0%
oversight committee that's the focus of
 
04:12:54.630 --> 04:12:54.640 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:12:56.550 --> 04:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
and it shall concern the results and
 
04:12:58.550 --> 04:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of the system benefits
 
04:12:58.560 --> 04:12:59.670 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of the system benefits
charge

04:12:59.670 --> 04:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
charge
 
04:13:02.149 --> 04:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if this was in if this was
 
04:13:04.149 --> 04:13:04.159 align:start position:0%
a mistake or or anything like that but
 
04:13:05.830 --> 04:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
the department wanted to get some
 
04:13:07.670 --> 04:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
clarity on that whether or not they wish
 
04:13:07.680 --> 04:13:08.469 align:start position:0%
clarity on that whether or not they wish
to

04:13:08.469 --> 04:13:08.479 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:13:10.630 --> 04:13:10.640 align:start position:0%
retain this reporting requirement or
 
04:13:12.550 --> 04:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
repeal it because
 
04:13:14.870 --> 04:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
either or there are some kind of other
 
04:13:16.870 --> 04:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
suggestions we'd make
 
04:13:18.309 --> 04:13:18.319 align:start position:0%
and that's where the two sub-bullets
 
04:13:20.630 --> 04:13:20.640 align:start position:0%
come in my written testimony should the
 
04:13:22.469 --> 04:13:22.479 align:start position:0%
committee wish to retain this reporting
 
04:13:24.630 --> 04:13:24.640 align:start position:0%
requirement and rename who receives the
 
04:13:28.070 --> 04:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
system benefits charge report
 
04:13:30.950 --> 04:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
doe respectfully suggests taking section
 
04:13:33.670 --> 04:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
16 out of representative harrington's
 
04:13:33.680 --> 04:13:35.189 align:start position:0%
16 out of representative harrington's
bill

04:13:35.189 --> 04:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:13:37.030 --> 04:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
and just putting that in this bill
 
04:13:39.429 --> 04:13:39.439 align:start position:0%
because that bill makes a
 
04:13:40.870 --> 04:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
slight correction it just deletes
 
04:13:42.710 --> 04:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
commission and
 
04:13:43.910 --> 04:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
just has the department of energy
 
04:13:45.510 --> 04:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
handling the report and then just
 
04:13:48.229 --> 04:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
redirects who the report is submitted to
 
04:13:50.229 --> 04:13:50.239 align:start position:0%
so we suggested maybe the house science
 
04:13:52.229 --> 04:13:52.239 align:start position:0%
technology and energy committee and the
 
04:13:53.990 --> 04:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
senate energy and natural resources
 
04:13:54.000 --> 04:13:55.030 align:start position:0%
senate energy and natural resources
committee

04:13:55.030 --> 04:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:13:55.040 --> 04:13:56.389 align:start position:0%
committee
um

04:13:56.389 --> 04:13:56.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:58.309 --> 04:13:58.319 align:start position:0%
if the committee wished to repeal this
 
04:13:59.670 --> 04:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
reporting requirement there is a
 
04:14:02.070 --> 04:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
crossover reference in another area of
 
04:14:04.149 --> 04:14:04.159 align:start position:0%
statute that requires the report be
 
04:14:05.590 --> 04:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
submitted to the commission of the
 
04:14:07.429 --> 04:14:07.439 align:start position:0%
department of education so that
 
04:14:08.790 --> 04:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
reference depending on which way the
 
04:14:10.630 --> 04:14:10.640 align:start position:0%
committee wishes to go should be
 
04:14:13.429 --> 04:14:13.439 align:start position:0%
repealed or amended
 
04:14:17.110 --> 04:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
my final note is as was referenced
 
04:14:18.389 --> 04:14:18.399 align:start position:0%
there are other bills obviously
 
04:14:19.910 --> 04:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
affecting this committee working its way
 
04:14:22.070 --> 04:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
through the legislature there's a minor
 
04:14:23.510 --> 04:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
reference to it in representative
 
04:14:25.510 --> 04:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
harrington's bill there's also house
 
04:14:25.520 --> 04:14:26.269 align:start position:0%
harrington's bill there's also house
bill

04:14:26.269 --> 04:14:26.279 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:14:28.389 --> 04:14:28.399 align:start position:0%
1269 which is
 
04:14:29.990 --> 04:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
dealing with certain legislative study
 
04:14:32.630 --> 04:14:32.640 align:start position:0%
committees it repeals some
 
04:14:34.550 --> 04:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
amends the membership and quorum
 
04:14:36.550 --> 04:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
requirements of others
 
04:14:38.229 --> 04:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
as it pertains to the legislative
 
04:14:40.229 --> 04:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
oversight committee to monitor the
 
04:14:43.110 --> 04:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
delivery of electric services i believe
 
04:14:45.110 --> 04:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
that bill as it's written
 
04:14:47.590 --> 04:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
amends the membership and quorum
 
04:14:49.830 --> 04:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
requirements of that committee um
 
04:14:51.189 --> 04:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
certainly willing to answer any
 
04:14:52.870 --> 04:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
questions you might have i understand if
 
04:14:54.389 --> 04:14:54.399 align:start position:0%
certainly your head is spinning with
 
04:14:55.990 --> 04:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
everything i've said
 
04:14:57.189 --> 04:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
but certainly willing to answer any
 
04:14:58.149 --> 04:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
questions you might have and that
 
04:15:01.990 --> 04:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:04.469 --> 04:15:04.479 align:start position:0%
okay thank you mr roberge for your
 
04:15:07.830 --> 04:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
testimony on this bill i'm sure we have
 
04:15:10.550 --> 04:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
some questions that we want to ask
 
04:15:12.389 --> 04:15:12.399 align:start position:0%
i have a general question before we get
 
04:15:14.630 --> 04:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
to any specific questions about the bill
 
04:15:17.670 --> 04:15:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:19.910 --> 04:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this
 
04:15:21.990 --> 04:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
committee originally was to provide
 
04:15:23.429 --> 04:15:23.439 align:start position:0%
oversight to
 
04:15:23.439 --> 04:15:26.309 align:start position:0%
oversight to
restructuring

04:15:26.309 --> 04:15:26.319 align:start position:0%
restructuring
 
04:15:28.950 --> 04:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
then it was modified to provide
 
04:15:32.309 --> 04:15:32.319 align:start position:0%
kind of a general oversight on the
 
04:15:32.319 --> 04:15:34.229 align:start position:0%
kind of a general oversight on the
electricity

04:15:34.229 --> 04:15:34.239 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
04:15:34.239 --> 04:15:36.790 align:start position:0%
electricity
industry

04:15:36.790 --> 04:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
industry
 
04:15:39.030 --> 04:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
would the department of energy assume
 
04:15:41.189 --> 04:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
some of that
 
04:15:42.870 --> 04:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
oversight of
 
04:15:44.790 --> 04:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
the electricity
 
04:15:44.800 --> 04:15:46.710 align:start position:0%
the electricity
markets

04:15:46.710 --> 04:15:46.720 align:start position:0%
markets
 
04:15:48.710 --> 04:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
and if so
 
04:15:51.830 --> 04:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
would an oversight committee to
 
04:15:53.510 --> 04:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
provide some oversight to the department
 
04:15:56.870 --> 04:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
of energy be in order
 
04:15:58.389 --> 04:15:58.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh mr
 
04:16:00.790 --> 04:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
chairman um in terms of the first part
 
04:16:02.550 --> 04:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
of your question in regards to what the
 
04:16:04.790 --> 04:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
oversight committee looks at now
 
04:16:07.349 --> 04:16:07.359 align:start position:0%
um its duties were so
 
04:16:09.349 --> 04:16:09.359 align:start position:0%
initially this oversight committee was
 
04:16:12.389 --> 04:16:12.399 align:start position:0%
as you said to look at the divestiture
 
04:16:14.630 --> 04:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
back in 2018 there was a bill put
 
04:16:16.870 --> 04:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
forward that renamed and refocused the
 
04:16:16.880 --> 04:16:18.149 align:start position:0%
forward that renamed and refocused the
committee

04:16:18.149 --> 04:16:18.159 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:16:20.950 --> 04:16:20.960 align:start position:0%
and turned it into what it is today
 
04:16:22.550 --> 04:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
if this committee
 
04:16:24.630 --> 04:16:24.640 align:start position:0%
were repealed i mean the department does
 
04:16:27.349 --> 04:16:27.359 align:start position:0%
have you know regulatory aspects over
 
04:16:29.189 --> 04:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
public utilities and the public
 
04:16:30.710 --> 04:16:30.720 align:start position:0%
utilities commission looks at various
 
04:16:32.389 --> 04:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
issues as they come up under under
 
04:16:33.750 --> 04:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
dockets and that type of thing and
 
04:16:35.110 --> 04:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
people are certainly welcome to take
 
04:16:37.670 --> 04:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
part in those processes i think it's in
 
04:16:38.790 --> 04:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
04:16:40.389 --> 04:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
whether or not you want a specific
 
04:16:41.990 --> 04:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee looking
 
04:16:43.830 --> 04:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
at this that would be a policy decision
 
04:16:43.840 --> 04:16:44.550 align:start position:0%
at this that would be a policy decision
for

04:16:44.550 --> 04:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:16:47.750 --> 04:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
um legislators to make
 
04:16:49.750 --> 04:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
we serve at the i mean we'll provide any
 
04:16:52.070 --> 04:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
answers to questions that
 
04:16:54.149 --> 04:16:54.159 align:start position:0%
com that policy makers may have this is
 
04:16:55.590 --> 04:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
i guess a vehicle
 
04:16:57.030 --> 04:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
to do that whether or not you guys want
 
04:17:00.389 --> 04:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
to repeal it or keep it
 
04:17:02.710 --> 04:17:02.720 align:start position:0%
okay thank you questions for
 
04:17:04.389 --> 04:17:04.399 align:start position:0%
mr roberge
 
04:17:06.469 --> 04:17:06.479 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee has a question
 
04:17:08.309 --> 04:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you mr roberge
 
04:17:10.710 --> 04:17:10.720 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um they're just
 
04:17:13.110 --> 04:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
two small little knits um
 
04:17:16.070 --> 04:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
do you think the department of
 
04:17:17.670 --> 04:17:17.680 align:start position:0%
the department of education was put in
 
04:17:20.630 --> 04:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
here because doe was misconstrued or no
 
04:17:23.349 --> 04:17:23.359 align:start position:0%
i i i cannot unfortunately represent i
 
04:17:25.750 --> 04:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
can't speak to the genesis as to why the
 
04:17:27.189 --> 04:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
department of education is in there i
 
04:17:29.830 --> 04:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
know and this is my it was my attempt at
 
04:17:33.110 --> 04:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
brevity in my written remarks is that
 
04:17:35.590 --> 04:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
in that second sub-bullet is that it's a
 
04:17:37.990 --> 04:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
little bit more of a
 
04:17:40.389 --> 04:17:40.399 align:start position:0%
substantial section of statute and i
 
04:17:41.510 --> 04:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
want to
 
04:17:43.030 --> 04:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
i just want to paste the certain section
 
04:17:45.269 --> 04:17:45.279 align:start position:0%
as it pertained to the report
 
04:17:47.030 --> 04:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
based on my recollection and i don't
 
04:17:48.790 --> 04:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
have the statute in front of me is that
 
04:17:50.309 --> 04:17:50.319 align:start position:0%
i think
 
04:17:51.429 --> 04:17:51.439 align:start position:0%
part of the
 
04:17:53.750 --> 04:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
report is to look at the effectiveness
 
04:17:56.229 --> 04:17:56.239 align:start position:0%
of energy efficiency and the use of sbc
 
04:17:57.990 --> 04:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
funds for
 
04:17:59.750 --> 04:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
public schools educational institutions
 
04:18:02.790 --> 04:18:02.800 align:start position:0%
and what have you and part of that is
 
04:18:04.149 --> 04:18:04.159 align:start position:0%
included in the report so it was
 
04:18:05.510 --> 04:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
forwarded along to the commissioner of
 
04:18:07.670 --> 04:18:07.680 align:start position:0%
the department of education
 
04:18:09.510 --> 04:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
the department of energy has no position
 
04:18:10.950 --> 04:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
on whether or not you guys want to keep
 
04:18:12.630 --> 04:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
that reporting requirement or not it's
 
04:18:14.790 --> 04:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
just if you do go ahead and
 
04:18:14.800 --> 04:18:16.149 align:start position:0%
just if you do go ahead and
repeal

04:18:16.149 --> 04:18:16.159 align:start position:0%
repeal
 
04:18:17.830 --> 04:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
the requirement for the system benefits
 
04:18:19.349 --> 04:18:19.359 align:start position:0%
charge report that this
 
04:18:21.030 --> 04:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
other statute should be tinkered with as
 
04:18:23.110 --> 04:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
well because it's a cross reference okay
 
04:18:25.030 --> 04:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
and follow-up
 
04:18:27.670 --> 04:18:27.680 align:start position:0%
follow-up my other net
 
04:18:28.710 --> 04:18:28.720 align:start position:0%
i think it's interesting that we're
 
04:18:30.309 --> 04:18:30.319 align:start position:0%
hearing that the system benefits charge
 
04:18:31.510 --> 04:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
is one of the
 
04:18:31.520 --> 04:18:33.269 align:start position:0%
is one of the
current

04:18:33.269 --> 04:18:33.279 align:start position:0%
current
 
04:18:35.030 --> 04:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
charges of the of the oversight
 
04:18:36.469 --> 04:18:36.479 align:start position:0%
committee that we weren't we weren't
 
04:18:38.950 --> 04:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
made aware of by the sponsor but um you
 
04:18:41.030 --> 04:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
had also mentioned representative
 
04:18:42.870 --> 04:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
harrington's bill multiple times and i'm
 
04:18:44.550 --> 04:18:44.560 align:start position:0%
wondering which bill that is that you're
 
04:18:46.710 --> 04:18:46.720 align:start position:0%
referring to i'm sorry so that i believe
 
04:18:49.670 --> 04:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
is house bill 1258 and i'm not speaking
 
04:18:51.110 --> 04:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
all to
 
04:18:52.790 --> 04:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
the only part of the bill i'm focusing
 
04:18:55.030 --> 04:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
on is section 16 of the bill as
 
04:18:56.950 --> 04:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
introduced okay
 
04:18:59.189 --> 04:18:59.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:19:02.389 --> 04:19:02.399 align:start position:0%
additional questions for mr roberge
 
04:19:05.670 --> 04:19:05.680 align:start position:0%
representative sausage
 
04:19:07.590 --> 04:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you mr
 
04:19:07.600 --> 04:19:10.070 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you mr
rubish

04:19:10.070 --> 04:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
rubish
 
04:19:12.630 --> 04:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
since since the the assistance benefits
 
04:19:15.030 --> 04:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
charge is mentioned here and you say
 
04:19:17.750 --> 04:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
that if this bill were to pass
 
04:19:20.870 --> 04:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
that requirement to report on the
 
04:19:23.030 --> 04:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of the system's benefits
 
04:19:25.030 --> 04:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
charge would then also
 
04:19:27.670 --> 04:19:27.680 align:start position:0%
be repealed
 
04:19:29.590 --> 04:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
is there any other entity that is
 
04:19:31.269 --> 04:19:31.279 align:start position:0%
looking into the effectiveness of the
 
04:19:33.429 --> 04:19:33.439 align:start position:0%
assistance benefits charge besides this
 
04:19:35.830 --> 04:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
oversight committee uh well just to be
 
04:19:35.840 --> 04:19:37.510 align:start position:0%
oversight committee uh well just to be
clear

04:19:37.510 --> 04:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
clear
 
04:19:39.429 --> 04:19:39.439 align:start position:0%
based on based on the department's read
 
04:19:41.750 --> 04:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
is that it does repeal again on line six
 
04:19:43.670 --> 04:19:43.680 align:start position:0%
to eight on page two it does repeal this
 
04:19:45.830 --> 04:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
reporting requirement as it reads in my
 
04:19:48.710 --> 04:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
letter of testimony the puc and the
 
04:19:50.550 --> 04:19:50.560 align:start position:0%
department which means i believe the
 
04:19:52.389 --> 04:19:52.399 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services
 
04:19:54.229 --> 04:19:54.239 align:start position:0%
shall submit a report to the legislative
 
04:19:55.670 --> 04:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
oversight committee to monitor the
 
04:19:57.910 --> 04:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
transformation of delivery of electric
 
04:19:59.750 --> 04:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
services the report shall concern the
 
04:20:01.189 --> 04:20:01.199 align:start position:0%
results and effectiveness of the system
 
04:20:05.030 --> 04:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:07.110 --> 04:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
repealing that
 
04:20:07.120 --> 04:20:08.149 align:start position:0%
repealing that
would

04:20:08.149 --> 04:20:08.159 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:20:10.070 --> 04:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
would lessen the uh would remove the
 
04:20:11.990 --> 04:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
obligation for under the existing
 
04:20:13.110 --> 04:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
language the commission and the
 
04:20:14.710 --> 04:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services to
 
04:20:16.870 --> 04:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
produce that report and deliver it to
 
04:20:18.630 --> 04:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
the legislative oversight committee or
 
04:20:20.710 --> 04:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
this legislative oversight committee if
 
04:20:22.389 --> 04:20:22.399 align:start position:0%
the committee wish to retain this
 
04:20:23.910 --> 04:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
reporting requirement that's why i spell
 
04:20:25.910 --> 04:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
out my first sub-bullet is we would
 
04:20:27.830 --> 04:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
suggest taking the language from
 
04:20:29.670 --> 04:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
representative harrington's bill
 
04:20:31.269 --> 04:20:31.279 align:start position:0%
and replacing the reference to the
 
04:20:33.269 --> 04:20:33.279 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee with say
 
04:20:34.790 --> 04:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
the house science technology and energy
 
04:20:37.030 --> 04:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
committee and the senate enr committee
 
04:20:38.710 --> 04:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
so that would ensure that the reporting
 
04:20:41.110 --> 04:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
requirement is retained it just redirect
 
04:20:42.870 --> 04:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
redirects who it's sent to so it would
 
04:20:44.870 --> 04:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
be sent to the two legislative standing
 
04:20:46.790 --> 04:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
committees with jurisdiction over energy
 
04:20:46.800 --> 04:20:48.229 align:start position:0%
committees with jurisdiction over energy
matters

04:20:48.229 --> 04:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
matters
 
04:20:50.070 --> 04:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:20:54.550 --> 04:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
okay further questions for mr roberge
 
04:20:54.560 --> 04:20:57.830 align:start position:0%
okay further questions for mr roberge
anyone

04:20:57.830 --> 04:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:01.269 --> 04:21:01.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:04.070 --> 04:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
we heard today that
 
04:21:06.710 --> 04:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
wind energy is important and is
 
04:21:10.229 --> 04:21:10.239 align:start position:0%
important part of our whole process
 
04:21:12.389 --> 04:21:12.399 align:start position:0%
would you say that
 
04:21:12.399 --> 04:21:14.070 align:start position:0%
would you say that
these

04:21:14.070 --> 04:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
these
 
04:21:16.229 --> 04:21:16.239 align:start position:0%
various industries
 
04:21:16.239 --> 04:21:17.189 align:start position:0%
various industries
wind

04:21:17.189 --> 04:21:17.199 align:start position:0%
wind
 
04:21:17.199 --> 04:21:18.630 align:start position:0%
wind
solar

04:21:18.630 --> 04:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
solar
 
04:21:18.640 --> 04:21:21.110 align:start position:0%

04:21:21.110 --> 04:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
hydro
 
04:21:23.429 --> 04:21:23.439 align:start position:0%
their proliferation
 
04:21:26.309 --> 04:21:26.319 align:start position:0%
is a direct result of electric
 
04:21:26.319 --> 04:21:28.710 align:start position:0%
is a direct result of electric
deregulation

04:21:28.710 --> 04:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
deregulation
 
04:21:30.550 --> 04:21:30.560 align:start position:0%
i i would say
 
04:21:32.950 --> 04:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
in part but certainly you know variety
 
04:21:35.990 --> 04:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
of other factors i'm sure come into play
 
04:21:39.910 --> 04:21:39.920 align:start position:0%
man follow-up follow-up would you say
 
04:21:39.920 --> 04:21:40.790 align:start position:0%
man follow-up follow-up would you say
or

04:21:40.790 --> 04:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:21:42.550 --> 04:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
could you envision
 
04:21:45.990 --> 04:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
that an electric oversight committee
 
04:21:49.349 --> 04:21:49.359 align:start position:0%
should have its hand on the pulse
 
04:21:52.389 --> 04:21:52.399 align:start position:0%
of the proliferation of these types of
 
04:21:55.189 --> 04:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
energies and what they do to the
 
04:21:57.910 --> 04:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
electric delivery system
 
04:21:59.510 --> 04:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
yeah sure i mean to the extent that
 
04:22:02.149 --> 04:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
legislators want to be informed that's a
 
04:22:03.670 --> 04:22:03.680 align:start position:0%
you know in terms of the committees that
 
04:22:05.110 --> 04:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
they create that's a decision for

from restricting the types of fuel
 
04:33:31.910 --> 04:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
sources that may be used for energy and
 
04:33:35.510 --> 04:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
i would like to call on the bill's
 
04:33:37.910 --> 04:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
primary sponsor
 
04:33:41.029 --> 04:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
representative fred plett to introduce
 
04:33:42.789 --> 04:33:42.799 align:start position:0%
the bill thank you and i have written
 
04:33:45.029 --> 04:33:45.039 align:start position:0%
testimony passed out to every member of
 
04:33:46.230 --> 04:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
04:33:48.551 --> 04:33:48.561 align:start position:0%
and then i passed it to the audience so
 
04:33:56.709 --> 04:33:56.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:57.910 --> 04:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
i tried it
 
04:33:59.510 --> 04:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
i tried to do it to every member of the
 
04:33:59.520 --> 04:34:00.869 align:start position:0%
i tried to do it to every member of the
committee

04:34:00.869 --> 04:34:00.879 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:34:03.349 --> 04:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
but with this two-layer system it
 
04:34:06.150 --> 04:34:06.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes uh gets confusing sorry about
 
04:34:06.160 --> 04:34:10.551 align:start position:0%
sometimes uh gets confusing sorry about
that

04:34:10.551 --> 04:34:10.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:12.869 --> 04:34:12.879 align:start position:0%
they all have them back there
 
04:34:15.029 --> 04:34:15.039 align:start position:0%
yes they do but uh lee oxenham do you
 
04:34:16.629 --> 04:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
have oxygen
 
04:34:18.709 --> 04:34:18.719 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:34:21.269 --> 04:34:21.279 align:start position:0%
then shall i begin

yes please begin hb 1148 is designed to
 
04:34:28.629 --> 04:34:28.639 align:start position:0%

04:34:33.029 --> 04:34:33.039 align:start position:0%

04:34:34.869 --> 04:34:34.879 align:start position:0%
determination of this type of estate
 
04:34:37.029 --> 04:34:37.039 align:start position:0%
responsibility is solely and we have a
 
04:34:38.869 --> 04:34:38.879 align:start position:0%

04:34:38.879 --> 04:34:40.070 align:start position:0%

making any kind of power generation or
 
04:34:44.949 --> 04:34:44.959 align:start position:0%
conversion when proposed no matter what
 
04:34:46.949 --> 04:34:46.959 align:start position:0%
the nature appears to engender a
 
04:34:49.349 --> 04:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
negative response whether simply are not
 
04:34:51.670 --> 04:34:51.680 align:start position:0%

04:34:58.070 --> 04:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
and i stress any kind uh solar i think
 
04:34:59.429 --> 04:34:59.439 align:start position:0%
is opposed sometimes they have
 
04:35:01.189 --> 04:35:01.199 align:start position:0%

04:35:28.070 --> 04:35:28.080 align:start position:0%

municipal level
 
04:35:34.230 --> 04:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
this bill amends rsa 362 by inserting a
 
04:35:37.349 --> 04:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
new section 362.9 to prohibit government
 
04:35:38.949 --> 04:35:38.959 align:start position:0%
entities subordinate to the state from
 
04:35:40.629 --> 04:35:40.639 align:start position:0%
restricting the types of fuel sources
 
04:35:42.869 --> 04:35:42.879 align:start position:0%
that may be used for energy as such it
 
04:35:44.629 --> 04:35:44.639 align:start position:0%
is geared towards energy production or
 
04:35:44.639 --> 04:35:45.830 align:start position:0%
is geared towards energy production or
conversion

04:35:45.830 --> 04:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
conversion
 
04:35:48.551 --> 04:35:48.561 align:start position:0%
it was pointed out to me twice in fact
 
04:35:51.109 --> 04:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
that sb-86 that passed last session and
 
04:35:53.109 --> 04:35:53.119 align:start position:0%
now law prohibited restrictions on the
 
04:35:55.109 --> 04:35:55.119 align:start position:0%
installation of certain commercially
 
04:35:57.349 --> 04:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
available heating systems and engaging
 
04:35:59.830 --> 04:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
the services of certain energy providers
 
04:36:02.230 --> 04:36:02.240 align:start position:0%
i see the subject matter is different
 
04:36:04.390 --> 04:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
the ssb ssb-86 was prohibiting
 
04:36:06.949 --> 04:36:06.959 align:start position:0%
restrictions excuse me uh
 
04:36:10.310 --> 04:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
hb 1148 is prohibiting restrictions on
 
04:36:12.709 --> 04:36:12.719 align:start position:0%
energy production or conversion whereas
 
04:36:15.590 --> 04:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
sb 86 that passed last year was
 
04:36:17.109 --> 04:36:17.119 align:start position:0%
prohibiting restrictions on heating
 
04:36:19.510 --> 04:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
systems never their language though was
 
04:36:21.510 --> 04:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
very similar so nevertheless i did go
 
04:36:23.269 --> 04:36:23.279 align:start position:0%
back to the office of legislative
 
04:36:25.429 --> 04:36:25.439 align:start position:0%
service to see if the language of either
 
04:36:26.470 --> 04:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
could be
 
04:36:28.949 --> 04:36:28.959 align:start position:0%
modified tweaked to uh to cut down on
 
04:36:31.029 --> 04:36:31.039 align:start position:0%
the overall verbiage in the statutes and
 
04:36:34.551 --> 04:36:34.561 align:start position:0%
it was told no by ols that sb-86 last
 
04:36:36.349 --> 04:36:36.359 align:start position:0%
year amended
 
04:36:40.230 --> 04:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
rsa-155a2 and rsa 674-51
 
04:36:41.830 --> 04:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
both of which relate to the state
 
04:36:43.910 --> 04:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
building code the language of the new
 
04:36:46.070 --> 04:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
section inserted by this bill is
 
04:36:48.629 --> 04:36:48.639 align:start position:0%
inserted into rsa 362 because of
 
04:36:50.310 --> 04:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
regulation of energy production so i
 
04:36:52.070 --> 04:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
confirm my belief they are two different
 
04:36:53.750 --> 04:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
things and belong in two different parts
 
04:36:56.310 --> 04:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
of the statute with that i'll open up
 
04:36:58.310 --> 04:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
the questions
 
04:37:00.230 --> 04:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative plett for your
 
04:37:03.029 --> 04:37:03.039 align:start position:0%
testimony and for bringing forth house
 
04:37:05.750 --> 04:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
bill 1148
 
04:37:07.590 --> 04:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
do committee members have questions for
 
04:37:09.349 --> 04:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
representative platt representative
 
04:37:11.590 --> 04:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
harrington is recognized for a question
 
04:37:13.029 --> 04:37:13.039 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman they'll be taking
 
04:37:16.310 --> 04:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:18.390 --> 04:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't the present
 
04:37:20.070 --> 04:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
law i assume you're bringing this up
 
04:37:21.830 --> 04:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
because the present law you feel is not
 
04:37:24.470 --> 04:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
effective uh meeting the site evaluation
 
04:37:27.269 --> 04:37:27.279 align:start position:0%
committee rules and the 362h in
 
04:37:29.590 --> 04:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
preventing a municipality from blocking
 
04:37:29.600 --> 04:37:30.390 align:start position:0%
preventing a municipality from blocking
a

04:37:30.390 --> 04:37:30.400 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:37:32.310 --> 04:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
uh project let me give you for instance
 
04:37:33.910 --> 04:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
if it was a transmission project that
 
04:37:35.429 --> 04:37:35.439 align:start position:0%
was going to go across
 
04:37:37.750 --> 04:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
uh six or seven different towns
 
04:37:40.070 --> 04:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't the present law prevent any one
 
04:37:42.551 --> 04:37:42.561 align:start position:0%
town there from simply making it
 
04:37:44.310 --> 04:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
impossible to build it
 
04:37:46.629 --> 04:37:46.639 align:start position:0%
you're talking one example i'm talking
 
04:37:49.269 --> 04:37:49.279 align:start position:0%
the generality of any kind of production
 
04:37:51.510 --> 04:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
any type of conversion so i'm not
 
04:37:53.189 --> 04:37:53.199 align:start position:0%
certain that the current law covers
 
04:37:55.269 --> 04:37:55.279 align:start position:0%
everything okay follow up mr chairman
 
04:37:58.230 --> 04:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
follow up so this would basically then
 
04:38:00.551 --> 04:38:00.561 align:start position:0%
come uh this bill would pick up the
 
04:38:03.109 --> 04:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
things that aren't covered by the uh
 
04:38:05.990 --> 04:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
site evaluation statute meaning
 
04:38:07.990 --> 04:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
projects like below 30 megawatts which
 
04:38:10.070 --> 04:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
is not necessarily of jurisdiction over
 
04:38:12.470 --> 04:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
and things such as that absolutely thank
 
04:38:12.480 --> 04:38:14.150 align:start position:0%
and things such as that absolutely thank
you

04:38:14.150 --> 04:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:38:15.990 --> 04:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
okay further questions for
 
04:38:18.230 --> 04:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
representative plett representative

callie pitts is recognized
 
04:38:22.629 --> 04:38:22.639 align:start position:0%
representative plitt would these
 
04:38:25.109 --> 04:38:25.119 align:start position:0%
projects still have to go through the
 
04:38:27.429 --> 04:38:27.439 align:start position:0%
permitting process on the state level
 
04:38:30.551 --> 04:38:30.561 align:start position:0%
like environmental services and epa and
 
04:38:32.869 --> 04:38:32.879 align:start position:0%
all that absolutely it just would
 
04:38:34.869 --> 04:38:34.879 align:start position:0%
prohibit a municipality but throwing
 
04:38:37.590 --> 04:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
from throwing roadblocks in their way
 
04:38:37.600 --> 04:38:39.830 align:start position:0%
from throwing roadblocks in their way
thanks

04:38:39.830 --> 04:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
04:38:41.670 --> 04:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee is recognized real
 
04:38:43.349 --> 04:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
quick thank you mr chairman
 
04:38:45.510 --> 04:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
um i'm concerned how
 
04:38:48.070 --> 04:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
this would affect uh folks who are
 
04:38:50.310 --> 04:38:50.320 align:start position:0%
already following a sort of a net zero
 
04:38:51.990 --> 04:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
planning for their cities i know we have
 
04:38:54.070 --> 04:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
towns and cities that did that at our
 
04:38:54.080 --> 04:38:55.510 align:start position:0%
towns and cities that did that at our
behest

04:38:55.510 --> 04:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
behest
 
04:38:57.429 --> 04:38:57.439 align:start position:0%
so there are currently
 
04:38:59.990 --> 04:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities who are working on plans
 
04:39:00.000 --> 04:39:01.830 align:start position:0%
municipalities who are working on plans
to

04:39:01.830 --> 04:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:39:04.390 --> 04:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
lower their consumption of
 
04:39:06.949 --> 04:39:06.959 align:start position:0%
emitting fuels by a certain date like
 
04:39:09.269 --> 04:39:09.279 align:start position:0%
2050 or something like that would this
 
04:39:12.390 --> 04:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
be impacting folks in terms of their
 
04:39:14.070 --> 04:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
ability to
 
04:39:17.029 --> 04:39:17.039 align:start position:0%
uh state that they have that goal
 
04:39:18.390 --> 04:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
no it would not prohibit any
 
04:39:21.189 --> 04:39:21.199 align:start position:0%
municipality from stating a goal
 
04:39:23.109 --> 04:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
it would not prohibit a municipality
 
04:39:24.551 --> 04:39:24.561 align:start position:0%
from encouraging
 
04:39:26.470 --> 04:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
certain investments but it would
 
04:39:29.189 --> 04:39:29.199 align:start position:0%
prohibit a municipality from blocking
 
04:39:31.029 --> 04:39:31.039 align:start position:0%
any kind of investment that they don't
 
04:39:33.349 --> 04:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
particularly care for
 
04:39:35.429 --> 04:39:35.439 align:start position:0%
following up i i understand
 
04:39:37.590 --> 04:39:37.600 align:start position:0%
oh thank you i understand the the
 
04:39:39.430 --> 04:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
impetus for
 
04:39:40.948 --> 04:39:40.958 align:start position:0%
making sure that there aren't
 
04:39:43.030 --> 04:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
unreasonable nimby type
 
04:39:44.470 --> 04:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
ordinances and
 
04:39:46.230 --> 04:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
going in at the municipal level to stop
 
04:39:48.550 --> 04:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
all types of projects but i just want to
 
04:39:50.868 --> 04:39:50.878 align:start position:0%
dig down a little deeper into the idea
 
04:39:53.350 --> 04:39:53.360 align:start position:0%
of folks who already have a plan
 
04:39:55.190 --> 04:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
if they already have a plan
 
04:39:57.270 --> 04:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
on their goals in terms of
 
04:39:59.510 --> 04:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
reaching a net zero emissions for
 
04:40:01.670 --> 04:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
municipal buildings or town town
 
04:40:03.350 --> 04:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
holdings and that kind of thing
 
04:40:04.948 --> 04:40:04.958 align:start position:0%
wouldn't this bill
 
04:40:07.830 --> 04:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
undo their ability to to do that only in
 
04:40:07.840 --> 04:40:08.948 align:start position:0%
undo their ability to to do that only in
part

04:40:08.948 --> 04:40:08.958 align:start position:0%
part
 
04:40:10.788 --> 04:40:10.798 align:start position:0%
it if the fact that they encouraged
 
04:40:13.670 --> 04:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
certain investments fine but it would
 
04:40:15.670 --> 04:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
it would prohibit them from blocking any
 
04:40:17.190 --> 04:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
kind of investment that doesn't happen
 
04:40:23.350 --> 04:40:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:23.360 --> 04:40:25.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:40:25.030 --> 04:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:40:26.948 --> 04:40:26.958 align:start position:0%
further questions for representative
 
04:40:26.958 --> 04:40:28.868 align:start position:0%
further questions for representative
platt

04:40:28.868 --> 04:40:28.878 align:start position:0%
platt
 
04:40:31.430 --> 04:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts
 
04:40:34.470 --> 04:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
and take my follow-up so
 
04:40:37.510 --> 04:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh when you say the word representative
 
04:40:40.070 --> 04:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
blocking do you mean by
 
04:40:42.788 --> 04:40:42.798 align:start position:0%
particular zone local zoning ordinances
 
04:40:44.948 --> 04:40:44.958 align:start position:0%
to stop a company from coming in for
 
04:40:47.190 --> 04:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
instance any which way it could be a
 
04:40:49.190 --> 04:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinance it could be a
 
04:40:51.110 --> 04:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
it could be an ordinance from the select
 
04:40:53.830 --> 04:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
board or whatever the system uh system
 
04:40:56.470 --> 04:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
is it's a city uh mayor and oliver mayor
 
04:40:59.350 --> 04:40:59.360 align:start position:0%
and council whatever entity municipal
 
04:41:02.310 --> 04:41:02.320 align:start position:0%
entity it would stop them from blocking
 
04:41:05.350 --> 04:41:05.360 align:start position:0%
anything uh that they don't particularly
 
04:41:08.948 --> 04:41:08.958 align:start position:0%
care for for whatever reason
 
04:41:11.270 --> 04:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
in my town there was a trash to energy
 
04:41:13.590 --> 04:41:13.600 align:start position:0%
facility proposed i was on the planning
 
04:41:16.070 --> 04:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
board at the time and 15 people might
 
04:41:17.590 --> 04:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
show up normally at a planning board
 
04:41:20.628 --> 04:41:20.638 align:start position:0%
hearing there was 1500 people showing up
 
04:41:22.150 --> 04:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
accusing the planning board of taking
 
04:41:23.670 --> 04:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
money under the table
 
04:41:25.590 --> 04:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
all sorts of nasty things
 
04:41:28.310 --> 04:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
and and there's a lot of emotion about
 
04:41:31.030 --> 04:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
stuff like that but that really is uh
 
04:41:32.550 --> 04:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
something that is
 
04:41:35.030 --> 04:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh should be beyond the town and what we
 
04:41:36.868 --> 04:41:36.878 align:start position:0%
wound up doing the the wheel of braider
 
04:41:39.590 --> 04:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
fry removed that proposal and built one
 
04:41:41.110 --> 04:41:41.120 align:start position:0%
in maine and we shipped our trash to
 
04:41:42.708 --> 04:41:42.718 align:start position:0%
maine it was okay in maine but not in
 
04:41:44.868 --> 04:41:44.878 align:start position:0%
our town and so that's a nimby sort of
 
04:41:48.230 --> 04:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
reaction and it's sort of this is what's
 
04:41:50.470 --> 04:41:50.480 align:start position:0%
prohibit that sort of stuff now if it's
 
04:41:52.150 --> 04:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
big enough to go to site evaluation
 
04:41:54.070 --> 04:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
committee you can argue with the site
 
04:41:58.550 --> 04:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:58.560 --> 04:41:59.430 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:41:59.430 --> 04:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:42:02.070 --> 04:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
any further questions for representative
 
04:42:04.070 --> 04:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
plett representative mick williams is
 
04:42:07.350 --> 04:42:07.360 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you chairpost
 
04:42:09.030 --> 04:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
representative platt i just want to
 
04:42:10.550 --> 04:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
understand what this would mean for the
 
04:42:13.510 --> 04:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
city of concord um which has enacted a
 
04:42:13.520 --> 04:42:15.350 align:start position:0%
city of concord um which has enacted a
uh

04:42:15.350 --> 04:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:42:17.590 --> 04:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
we're basically going for
 
04:42:19.830 --> 04:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
electric needs to be completely fossil
 
04:42:22.788 --> 04:42:22.798 align:start position:0%
free by 2030 across the board both
 
04:42:25.350 --> 04:42:25.360 align:start position:0%
municipal and private use in concord so
 
04:42:28.470 --> 04:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
we've enacted this um statute for the
 
04:42:30.788 --> 04:42:30.798 align:start position:0%
city of concord and what you're saying
 
04:42:34.150 --> 04:42:34.160 align:start position:0%
here at least in section four
 
04:42:36.390 --> 04:42:36.400 align:start position:0%
roman i a
 
04:42:38.150 --> 04:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh you're saying that you can't enforce
 
04:42:40.868 --> 04:42:40.878 align:start position:0%
the resolution so concord has gone above
 
04:42:42.788 --> 04:42:42.798 align:start position:0%
and beyond to commit to this and now
 
04:42:44.070 --> 04:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
we're as a state saying it's
 
04:42:45.830 --> 04:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
unenforceable is that correct that's
 
04:42:45.840 --> 04:42:48.550 align:start position:0%
unenforceable is that correct that's
correct

04:42:48.550 --> 04:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:50.948 --> 04:42:50.958 align:start position:0%
so just understand follow-up just so i
 
04:42:53.030 --> 04:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
understand so that means that for other
 
04:42:55.030 --> 04:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
cities and towns who have committed to a
 
04:42:57.750 --> 04:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
certain type of energy
 
04:42:59.270 --> 04:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
that would no longer be enforceable is
 
04:43:00.628 --> 04:43:00.638 align:start position:0%
that your intention
 
04:43:03.590 --> 04:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
i think the town can encourage forms of
 
04:43:03.600 --> 04:43:04.390 align:start position:0%
i think the town can encourage forms of
energy

04:43:04.390 --> 04:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
energy
 
04:43:06.470 --> 04:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
that just cannot block other forms of
 
04:43:06.480 --> 04:43:09.030 align:start position:0%
that just cannot block other forms of
energy

04:43:09.030 --> 04:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:12.150 --> 04:43:12.160 align:start position:0%

a gas line
 
04:43:45.670 --> 04:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
being built through their territory yes
 
04:43:47.190 --> 04:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
they still have the right to go to site
 
04:43:49.350 --> 04:43:49.360 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee and argue but yes
 
04:43:51.750 --> 04:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
it would stop a town or municipality
 
04:43:54.948 --> 04:43:54.958 align:start position:0%
from blocking a pipeline thank you

04:44:26.550 --> 04:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
converted or supplied to their customers
 
04:44:28.628 --> 04:44:28.638 align:start position:0%
does that mean to say that uh community
 
04:44:30.470 --> 04:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
aggregation when it makes commitment to
 
04:44:32.868 --> 04:44:32.878 align:start position:0%
uh providing 20 green power would not be
 
04:44:34.550 --> 04:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
able to make that commitment
 
04:44:37.270 --> 04:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
as an example that's uh something i
 
04:44:38.788 --> 04:44:38.798 align:start position:0%
haven't thought through thoroughly i
 
04:44:41.590 --> 04:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
think that's broad it's not prohibiting
 
04:44:43.990 --> 04:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
any particular source in their town
 
04:44:45.590 --> 04:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
so so i'm not sure that that would
 
04:44:47.910 --> 04:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily be restricted well thank you
 
04:44:49.350 --> 04:44:49.360 align:start position:0%
so much i'm not sure from the language
 
04:44:50.310 --> 04:44:50.320 align:start position:0%
but thank you for answering that
 
04:44:52.708 --> 04:44:52.718 align:start position:0%
question nope no follow up
 
04:44:52.718 --> 04:44:54.390 align:start position:0%
question nope no follow up
okay

04:44:54.390 --> 04:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:44:56.708 --> 04:44:56.718 align:start position:0%
any further questions for representative
 
04:44:56.718 --> 04:44:59.750 align:start position:0%
any further questions for representative
plett

04:44:59.750 --> 04:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:01.510 --> 04:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
seeing none i thank you representative

04:45:34.628 --> 04:45:34.638 align:start position:0%
and thank you natch
 
04:45:37.430 --> 04:45:37.440 align:start position:0%

and nhma opposes this bill
 
04:45:40.480 --> 04:45:41.510 align:start position:0%
and nhma opposes this bill
um

04:45:41.510 --> 04:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:41.520 --> 04:45:43.270 align:start position:0%
um
we

04:45:43.270 --> 04:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:45:45.750 --> 04:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
in our first analysis we were interested
 
04:45:48.390 --> 04:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
to see how this related to last year's
 
04:45:51.830 --> 04:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
senate bill 86 which which passed
 
04:45:54.150 --> 04:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
and was signed into law by the governor
 
04:45:54.160 --> 04:45:55.670 align:start position:0%
and was signed into law by the governor
um

04:45:55.670 --> 04:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:58.628 --> 04:45:58.638 align:start position:0%
we concluded that last year's bill
 
04:46:00.868 --> 04:46:00.878 align:start position:0%
really looks the retail end at the
 
04:46:03.350 --> 04:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
customer end so
 
04:46:06.628 --> 04:46:06.638 align:start position:0%
a municipality could not for example
 
04:46:10.550 --> 04:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
prevent a home builder from installing a
 
04:46:11.990 --> 04:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
a propane
 
04:46:14.390 --> 04:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
heating system or a propane
 
04:46:14.400 --> 04:46:16.470 align:start position:0%
heating system or a propane
oven

04:46:16.470 --> 04:46:16.480 align:start position:0%
oven
 
04:46:18.948 --> 04:46:18.958 align:start position:0%
the way we would would read this bill as
 
04:46:21.910 --> 04:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:21.920 --> 04:46:22.708 align:start position:0%
 
has

04:46:22.708 --> 04:46:22.718 align:start position:0%
has
 
04:46:24.708 --> 04:46:24.718 align:start position:0%
not only to do with kind of that retail
 
04:46:27.270 --> 04:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
end but also sort of the delivery system
 
04:46:28.390 --> 04:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
as well
 
04:46:29.830 --> 04:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
and we're really concerned about the
 
04:46:32.628 --> 04:46:32.638 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences here
 
04:46:34.788 --> 04:46:34.798 align:start position:0%
um so there was a case a couple years
 
04:46:36.708 --> 04:46:36.718 align:start position:0%
ago liberty utilities versus city of
 
04:46:36.718 --> 04:46:37.830 align:start position:0%
ago liberty utilities versus city of
concord

04:46:37.830 --> 04:46:37.840 align:start position:0%
concord
 
04:46:41.430 --> 04:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
number 2015-0510
 
04:46:43.510 --> 04:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
from 2017
 
04:46:45.590 --> 04:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
where liberty utilities had to repair
 
04:46:47.830 --> 04:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
the gas lines in downtown concord so
 
04:46:50.070 --> 04:46:50.080 align:start position:0%
they dug up the road and that issue in
 
04:46:51.910 --> 04:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
that case was okay who's going to pay to
 
04:46:54.390 --> 04:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
repair the road concord had enacted a
 
04:46:56.230 --> 04:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
fee schedule so that if you dug up the
 
04:46:56.240 --> 04:46:57.670 align:start position:0%
fee schedule so that if you dug up the
road

04:46:57.670 --> 04:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
road
 
04:46:59.990 --> 04:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
you were required to
 
04:47:02.788 --> 04:47:02.798 align:start position:0%
pay to restore the road and that was
 
04:47:04.708 --> 04:47:04.718 align:start position:0%
debated it ended up going to the supreme
 
04:47:06.868 --> 04:47:06.878 align:start position:0%
court and the supreme court said well
 
04:47:09.590 --> 04:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
that's perfectly fair to charge the
 
04:47:12.550 --> 04:47:12.560 align:start position:0%
utility company to repair the road
 
04:47:13.750 --> 04:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
we're concerned about the unintended
 
04:47:15.430 --> 04:47:15.440 align:start position:0%
consequence here because the language is
 
04:47:16.788 --> 04:47:16.798 align:start position:0%
so broad
 
04:47:19.190 --> 04:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
that if a municipality were to take any
 
04:47:19.200 --> 04:47:20.230 align:start position:0%
that if a municipality were to take any
action

04:47:20.230 --> 04:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
action
 
04:47:23.590 --> 04:47:23.600 align:start position:0%
that has the effect of restricting
 
04:47:25.670 --> 04:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
the fuel source that could be used or
 
04:47:25.680 --> 04:47:27.350 align:start position:0%
the fuel source that could be used or
delivered

04:47:27.350 --> 04:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
delivered
 
04:47:29.350 --> 04:47:29.360 align:start position:0%
would that mean that that's overruling
 
04:47:32.230 --> 04:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
the liberty utilities case in which case
 
04:47:34.150 --> 04:47:34.160 align:start position:0%
the burden of repairing the road the
 
04:47:35.670 --> 04:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
cost there would be borne by the
 
04:47:37.590 --> 04:47:37.600 align:start position:0%
municipality by the taxpayers of that
 
04:47:37.600 --> 04:47:39.110 align:start position:0%
municipality by the taxpayers of that
municipality

04:47:39.110 --> 04:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
04:47:41.910 --> 04:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
rather than by the utility which caused
 
04:47:41.920 --> 04:47:42.788 align:start position:0%
rather than by the utility which caused
the

04:47:42.788 --> 04:47:42.798 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:47:45.110 --> 04:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
damage in the first place so we're
 
04:47:47.030 --> 04:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
concerned about how broad this language
 
04:47:47.040 --> 04:47:48.788 align:start position:0%
concerned about how broad this language
is

04:47:48.788 --> 04:47:48.798 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:47:52.550 --> 04:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:54.230 --> 04:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:47:56.708 --> 04:47:56.718 align:start position:0%
mr grace for your testimony on behalf of
 
04:47:58.470 --> 04:47:58.480 align:start position:0%
the municipal association do we have
 
04:48:03.750 --> 04:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:05.670 --> 04:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
representative samsich
 
04:48:08.390 --> 04:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you mr
 
04:48:11.270 --> 04:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh nate for taking my question
 
04:48:13.510 --> 04:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
just just to be clear um what you were
 
04:48:14.628 --> 04:48:14.638 align:start position:0%
just saying
 
04:48:17.430 --> 04:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
uh is the concern of your organization
 
04:48:17.440 --> 04:48:18.470 align:start position:0%
uh is the concern of your organization
that

04:48:18.470 --> 04:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:48:18.480 --> 04:48:20.230 align:start position:0%
that
um

04:48:20.230 --> 04:48:20.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:23.510 --> 04:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
fuel choices that municipalities might
 
04:48:26.150 --> 04:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
allow to happen or try to prevent from
 
04:48:26.160 --> 04:48:27.350 align:start position:0%
allow to happen or try to prevent from
happening

04:48:27.350 --> 04:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
happening
 
04:48:29.270 --> 04:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh would
 
04:48:32.070 --> 04:48:32.080 align:start position:0%
would end up being born by the taxpayers
 
04:48:34.868 --> 04:48:34.878 align:start position:0%
instead of by the actual utility or
 
04:48:37.190 --> 04:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
entity that does this is that is that
 
04:48:37.200 --> 04:48:38.070 align:start position:0%
entity that does this is that is that
what

04:48:38.070 --> 04:48:38.080 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:48:40.470 --> 04:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
i don't quite understand the logic there
 
04:48:42.708 --> 04:48:42.718 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for the question so
 
04:48:45.670 --> 04:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
um in in looking at the language of the
 
04:48:47.270 --> 04:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
bill and trying to square it away with
 
04:48:49.190 --> 04:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
what is already the law due to last
 
04:48:51.270 --> 04:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
year's sb 86
 
04:48:52.390 --> 04:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
we were trying to figure out what the
 
04:48:53.670 --> 04:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
difference is you know we can't
 
04:48:55.510 --> 04:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
relitigate what happened last year you
 
04:48:57.030 --> 04:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
already can't prevent someone from
 
04:48:59.910 --> 04:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
installing you know their propane stove
 
04:49:03.270 --> 04:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
um that's that's already the law so how
 
04:49:04.948 --> 04:49:04.958 align:start position:0%
is this different
 
04:49:07.910 --> 04:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
well if you have a utility that's
 
04:49:11.190 --> 04:49:11.200 align:start position:0%
delivering something like natural gas
 
04:49:13.670 --> 04:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
via their delivery system
 
04:49:15.430 --> 04:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
and they need to go in and repair that
 
04:49:17.350 --> 04:49:17.360 align:start position:0%
and part of that repair process is going
 
04:49:19.670 --> 04:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
to require that they damage municipal
 
04:49:21.590 --> 04:49:21.600 align:start position:0%
property so the municipal road for
 
04:49:25.350 --> 04:49:25.360 align:start position:0%
example under which the gas line runs
 
04:49:28.628 --> 04:49:28.638 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns has
 
04:49:31.830 --> 04:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
been until 2017 when the supreme court
 
04:49:33.350 --> 04:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
made a decision
 
04:49:35.830 --> 04:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
who is responsible for repairing that
 
04:49:35.840 --> 04:49:36.708 align:start position:0%
who is responsible for repairing that
road

04:49:36.708 --> 04:49:36.718 align:start position:0%
road
 
04:49:39.030 --> 04:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
you know under the law the municipality
 
04:49:41.430 --> 04:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
runs the operates the road it maintains
 
04:49:43.750 --> 04:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
the road and there really isn't anything
 
04:49:46.150 --> 04:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
in the statutes about anything that runs
 
04:49:48.830 --> 04:49:48.840 align:start position:0%
under the road like the gas line
 
04:49:52.150 --> 04:49:52.160 align:start position:0%
so who exactly is going to pay for that
 
04:49:54.230 --> 04:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
repair and what standard is that repair
 
04:49:55.670 --> 04:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
04:49:55.680 --> 04:49:56.470 align:start position:0%
going to be
well

04:49:56.470 --> 04:49:56.480 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:49:58.310 --> 04:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
obviously the gas company could choose a
 
04:49:59.990 --> 04:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
couple options right they could shut off
 
04:50:02.070 --> 04:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
the gas line and say well we can't
 
04:50:05.590 --> 04:50:05.600 align:start position:0%
deliver you gas anymore um or
 
04:50:08.948 --> 04:50:08.958 align:start position:0%
they could go in and make that repair
 
04:50:10.708 --> 04:50:10.718 align:start position:0%
um and if the municipality has said well
 
04:50:12.868 --> 04:50:12.878 align:start position:0%
of course we want you to make the repair
 
04:50:12.878 --> 04:50:14.150 align:start position:0%
of course we want you to make the repair
um

04:50:14.150 --> 04:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:16.150 --> 04:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
but you're gonna have to pay for the
 
04:50:18.390 --> 04:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
damage to our property
 
04:50:21.270 --> 04:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
uh it's possible that this language is
 
04:50:23.750 --> 04:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
so broad that the municipality wouldn't
 
04:50:26.390 --> 04:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
be able to do that in which case it
 
04:50:28.788 --> 04:50:28.798 align:start position:0%
overrules the supreme court's decision
 
04:50:31.830 --> 04:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
and liberty utilities argument prevails
 
04:50:33.590 --> 04:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
which would mean that liberty utilities
 
04:50:35.350 --> 04:50:35.360 align:start position:0%
would say we have to go and repair our
 
04:50:37.590 --> 04:50:37.600 align:start position:0%
gas line into your road and by the way
 
04:50:38.788 --> 04:50:38.798 align:start position:0%
you have to figure out how to pay to
 
04:50:40.390 --> 04:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
repave that because it's not our
 
04:50:40.400 --> 04:50:41.910 align:start position:0%
repave that because it's not our
responsibility

04:50:41.910 --> 04:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
04:50:43.910 --> 04:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
and that was what was at contention in
 
04:50:45.670 --> 04:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
the liberty utilities case and we're
 
04:50:47.910 --> 04:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
very concerned that based on the
 
04:50:50.070 --> 04:50:50.080 align:start position:0%
language provided here that that would
 
04:50:52.868 --> 04:50:52.878 align:start position:0%
be the result
 
04:50:52.878 --> 04:50:54.628 align:start position:0%
be the result
follow-up

04:50:54.628 --> 04:50:54.638 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:50:56.948 --> 04:50:56.958 align:start position:0%
uh yeah thank you for that thank you mr
 
04:50:58.948 --> 04:50:58.958 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for that explanation
 
04:51:02.628 --> 04:51:02.638 align:start position:0%
um would you be willing to suggest a
 
04:51:04.708 --> 04:51:04.718 align:start position:0%
change that would make sure that doesn't
 
04:51:07.670 --> 04:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
happen in this case
 
04:51:07.680 --> 04:51:08.470 align:start position:0%
happen in this case
uh

04:51:08.470 --> 04:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:51:10.310 --> 04:51:10.320 align:start position:0%
i i'd certainly be happy to work with
 
04:51:12.390 --> 04:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
the sponsor i don't have a suggested
 
04:51:16.150 --> 04:51:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:18.310 --> 04:51:18.320 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:51:20.868 --> 04:51:20.878 align:start position:0%
next uh question representative callie
 
04:51:20.878 --> 04:51:22.948 align:start position:0%
next uh question representative callie
pitts

04:51:22.948 --> 04:51:22.958 align:start position:0%
pitts
 
04:51:25.270 --> 04:51:25.280 align:start position:0%
it's like i'm on a roll today what you
 
04:51:28.070 --> 04:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
just described
 
04:51:31.910 --> 04:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
if i'm interpreting it correctly is a
 
04:51:35.430 --> 04:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
after the fact situation correct this
 
04:51:35.440 --> 04:51:36.708 align:start position:0%
after the fact situation correct this
bill

04:51:36.708 --> 04:51:36.718 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:51:39.270 --> 04:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
if i'm interpreting it correctly and i
 
04:51:41.670 --> 04:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
want you to tell me that
 
04:51:43.670 --> 04:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
is a
 
04:51:43.680 --> 04:51:45.110 align:start position:0%
is a
pre

04:51:45.110 --> 04:51:45.120 align:start position:0%
pre
 
04:51:48.628 --> 04:51:48.638 align:start position:0%
this says you can't put gas in my
 
04:51:50.708 --> 04:51:50.718 align:start position:0%
i don't want your gas line you can't put
 
04:51:52.708 --> 04:51:52.718 align:start position:0%
it in my town
 
04:51:54.070 --> 04:51:54.080 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mean that if it's
 
04:51:56.868 --> 04:51:56.878 align:start position:0%
pre-existing and it doesn't go into
 
04:52:00.070 --> 04:52:00.080 align:start position:0%
those type of repair is what i see
 
04:52:04.788 --> 04:52:04.798 align:start position:0%
if i don't want a coal plant in my town
 
04:52:06.070 --> 04:52:06.080 align:start position:0%
i can say
 
04:52:09.030 --> 04:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:11.670 --> 04:52:11.680 align:start position:0%
this is preventing that
 
04:52:14.310 --> 04:52:14.320 align:start position:0%
this is saying the town can't stop that
 
04:52:17.110 --> 04:52:17.120 align:start position:0%
i don't believe it has
 
04:52:19.270 --> 04:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
in my mind anything to do with the
 
04:52:21.510 --> 04:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
situation you described which is a post
 
04:52:23.750 --> 04:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
that they've already allowed and it's a
 
04:52:25.990 --> 04:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
situation that arises all right can you
 
04:52:27.750 --> 04:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
clarify that for me
 
04:52:30.390 --> 04:52:30.400 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for the question um so
 
04:52:32.708 --> 04:52:32.718 align:start position:0%
i understand that's the sponsor's intent
 
04:52:34.470 --> 04:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
um but in in rereading this and
 
04:52:36.788 --> 04:52:36.798 align:start position:0%
re-reading the liberty utilities case
 
04:52:39.990 --> 04:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
that's what struck me as a concern um
 
04:52:42.550 --> 04:52:42.560 align:start position:0%
not only kind of the pipeline the new
 
04:52:44.470 --> 04:52:44.480 align:start position:0%
pipeline going through town
 
04:52:44.480 --> 04:52:45.430 align:start position:0%
pipeline going through town
but

04:52:45.430 --> 04:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:52:47.110 --> 04:52:47.120 align:start position:0%
the legal questions surrounding the
 
04:52:49.830 --> 04:52:49.840 align:start position:0%
existing pipeline and what happens if
 
04:52:51.190 --> 04:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
something goes wrong and who's going to
 
04:52:52.470 --> 04:52:52.480 align:start position:0%
pay for that
 
04:52:54.628 --> 04:52:54.638 align:start position:0%
and that's why we were we were concerned
 
04:52:59.270 --> 04:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:01.110 --> 04:53:01.120 align:start position:0%
you need a follow-up yes
 
04:53:03.190 --> 04:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
so you believe that this
 
04:53:03.200 --> 04:53:04.868 align:start position:0%
so you believe that this
bill

04:53:04.868 --> 04:53:04.878 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:53:04.878 --> 04:53:05.750 align:start position:0%
bill
would

04:53:05.750 --> 04:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:53:07.590 --> 04:53:07.600 align:start position:0%
override and i'm not saying i'm for
 
04:53:09.430 --> 04:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
against the bill but this bill would
 
04:53:09.440 --> 04:53:11.190 align:start position:0%
against the bill but this bill would
override

04:53:11.190 --> 04:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
override
 
04:53:13.110 --> 04:53:13.120 align:start position:0%
that decision
 
04:53:15.590 --> 04:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
even though that was a decision made on
 
04:53:18.550 --> 04:53:18.560 align:start position:0%
something that was already existing
 
04:53:21.030 --> 04:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
i i think that the language is broad
 
04:53:22.390 --> 04:53:22.400 align:start position:0%
enough that it has the potential to
 
04:53:23.830 --> 04:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
override that and
 
04:53:26.070 --> 04:53:26.080 align:start position:0%
i i can't make the the call for the
 
04:53:30.070 --> 04:53:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:31.590 --> 04:53:31.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:53:34.230 --> 04:53:34.240 align:start position:0%
additional questions
 
04:53:36.550 --> 04:53:36.560 align:start position:0%
for mr grays
 
04:53:38.390 --> 04:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
seeing none i thank you mr graves for
 
04:53:40.628 --> 04:53:40.638 align:start position:0%

04:53:44.310 --> 04:53:44.320 align:start position:0%
and i will now call on
 
04:53:46.708 --> 04:53:46.718 align:start position:0%

04:53:50.628 --> 04:53:50.638 align:start position:0%

okay all the materials have at this
 
04:55:10.830 --> 04:55:10.840 align:start position:0%
point been
 
04:55:13.670 --> 04:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
circulated so
 
04:55:16.868 --> 04:55:16.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:19.670 --> 04:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
open the floor to mr gage and remind him
 
04:55:22.868 --> 04:55:22.878 align:start position:0%
that you are here to speak on house bill
 
04:55:22.878 --> 04:55:25.670 align:start position:0%
that you are here to speak on house bill
1148

04:55:25.670 --> 04:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
1148
 
04:55:27.590 --> 04:55:27.600 align:start position:0%

thank you very much chairman fos and
 
04:55:38.830 --> 04:55:38.840 align:start position:0%
members of the

ste for hear my testimony today
 
04:55:44.708 --> 04:55:44.718 align:start position:0%
do any of us know what climate policies
 
04:55:46.070 --> 04:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
will be introduced by congress in the
 
04:55:47.990 --> 04:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
next 20 years
 
04:55:50.070 --> 04:55:50.080 align:start position:0%
of course not
 
04:55:52.150 --> 04:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
i'm a member of the windham local energy
 
04:55:52.160 --> 04:55:53.670 align:start position:0%
i'm a member of the windham local energy
committee

04:55:53.670 --> 04:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:55:55.670 --> 04:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
and i pose this bill because it takes
 
04:55:59.590 --> 04:55:59.600 align:start position:0%
local decision making away from
 
04:56:05.270 --> 04:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:06.868 --> 04:56:06.878 align:start position:0%
the first handout
 
04:56:09.030 --> 04:56:09.040 align:start position:0%
that i wanted to call attention to
 
04:56:10.948 --> 04:56:10.958 align:start position:0%
is this one
 
04:56:12.550 --> 04:56:12.560 align:start position:0%
the executive summary of the fourth
 
04:56:14.868 --> 04:56:14.878 align:start position:0%
national climate assessment this is from
 
04:56:16.868 --> 04:56:16.878 align:start position:0%
the united states global change research
 
04:56:16.878 --> 04:56:17.990 align:start position:0%
the united states global change research
program

04:56:17.990 --> 04:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:56:20.470 --> 04:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
and it's required by law it's uh
 
04:56:22.390 --> 04:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
basically what we know about climate
 
04:56:24.788 --> 04:56:24.798 align:start position:0%
change and climate pollution according
 
04:56:25.990 --> 04:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
to science
 
04:56:28.150 --> 04:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
this is settled science there's
 
04:56:29.670 --> 04:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
not a single organization in the world
 
04:56:31.910 --> 04:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
that disagrees with this
 
04:56:33.110 --> 04:56:33.120 align:start position:0%
the second
 
04:56:33.120 --> 04:56:34.390 align:start position:0%
the second
volume

04:56:34.390 --> 04:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
volume
 
04:56:36.868 --> 04:56:36.878 align:start position:0%
is on the impacts and effects
 
04:56:39.510 --> 04:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
of global warming from our climate
 
04:56:41.190 --> 04:56:41.200 align:start position:0%
pollution most of which is carbon
 
04:56:44.230 --> 04:56:44.240 align:start position:0%
emissions from fossil fuels
 
04:56:44.240 --> 04:56:45.430 align:start position:0%
emissions from fossil fuels
now

04:56:45.430 --> 04:56:45.440 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:56:48.708 --> 04:56:48.718 align:start position:0%
my town um was going to move toward
 
04:56:52.070 --> 04:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
getting gas piped in a couple years ago
 
04:56:53.350 --> 04:56:53.360 align:start position:0%
that was one of the reasons i joined the
 
04:56:53.360 --> 04:56:54.550 align:start position:0%
that was one of the reasons i joined the
committee

04:56:54.550 --> 04:56:54.560 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:56:54.560 --> 04:56:55.430 align:start position:0%
committee
um

04:56:55.430 --> 04:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:55.440 --> 04:56:56.550 align:start position:0%
um
because

04:56:56.550 --> 04:56:56.560 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:56:58.390 --> 04:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
i work at the federal level to help them
 
04:57:02.150 --> 04:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
put a price on carbon when that happens
 
04:57:04.868 --> 04:57:04.878 align:start position:0%
local regions that have locked in on
 
04:57:06.708 --> 04:57:06.718 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel infrastructure
 
04:57:09.590 --> 04:57:09.600 align:start position:0%
to hopefully have cheap energy are going
 
04:57:12.390 --> 04:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
to find themselves sitting on a bunch of
 
04:57:14.550 --> 04:57:14.560 align:start position:0%
stranded costs because
 
04:57:16.470 --> 04:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
their bet that fossil fuels were going
 
04:57:18.550 --> 04:57:18.560 align:start position:0%
to remain cheap will have
 
04:57:20.708 --> 04:57:20.718 align:start position:0%
proven not to be true
 
04:57:22.070 --> 04:57:22.080 align:start position:0%
i don't think the state should make a
 
04:57:23.670 --> 04:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
decision about whether
 
04:57:25.190 --> 04:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
a town or city
 
04:57:27.350 --> 04:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
can make that decision and make
 
04:57:29.270 --> 04:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
bets accordingly what they want to do
 
04:57:32.868 --> 04:57:32.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:35.430 --> 04:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
the third handout is
 
04:57:37.750 --> 04:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
starts with an economist statement
 
04:57:39.590 --> 04:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
now this is the largest economist
 
04:57:41.510 --> 04:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
statement supported by the most u.s
 
04:57:43.990 --> 04:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
economist ever about anything
 
04:57:45.830 --> 04:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
and it recommends
 
04:57:47.750 --> 04:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
that the most cost-effective
 
04:57:49.510 --> 04:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
and equitable way to reduce climate
 
04:57:51.510 --> 04:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
pollution is to put a price on the
 
04:57:53.990 --> 04:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
pollution where it enters the economy
 
04:57:56.390 --> 04:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
rebate the money back to households
 
04:57:58.868 --> 04:57:58.878 align:start position:0%
on an equal per capita basis each month
 
04:58:00.868 --> 04:58:00.878 align:start position:0%
to protect purchasing power
 
04:58:03.030 --> 04:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
and use border carbon adjustments
 
04:58:05.350 --> 04:58:05.360 align:start position:0%
to protect us businesses from free
 
04:58:07.430 --> 04:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
riding countries
 
04:58:09.110 --> 04:58:09.120 align:start position:0%
this is the only way we can hold other
 
04:58:12.310 --> 04:58:12.320 align:start position:0%
countries accountable for their climate
 
04:58:14.788 --> 04:58:14.798 align:start position:0%
pollution and strongly motivate them to
 
04:58:18.550 --> 04:58:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:21.030 --> 04:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
in congress right now there's a bill
 
04:58:23.190 --> 04:58:23.200 align:start position:0%
the reconciliation package
 
04:58:24.628 --> 04:58:24.638 align:start position:0%
which looks like they're going to focus
 
04:58:26.550 --> 04:58:26.560 align:start position:0%
on climate
 
04:58:28.708 --> 04:58:28.718 align:start position:0%
a carbon price is one of the obvious
 
04:58:31.350 --> 04:58:31.360 align:start position:0%
things for them to put into that
 
04:58:34.070 --> 04:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
if you take the control of local
 
04:58:36.230 --> 04:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
towns and cities
 
04:58:38.628 --> 04:58:38.638 align:start position:0%
uh if you remove their ability to say we
 
04:58:40.390 --> 04:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
don't want to invest in fossil fuel
 
04:58:45.030 --> 04:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
energy in our in our local region
 
04:58:47.990 --> 04:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
you're setting up developers to
 
04:58:49.670 --> 04:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
build infrastructure that's going to be
 
04:58:53.750 --> 04:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:53.760 --> 04:58:55.430 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:58:55.430 --> 04:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:57.990 --> 04:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
46 countries are already pricing carbon
 
04:59:01.830 --> 04:59:01.840 align:start position:0%
the eu now hit a 85 per ton price
 
04:59:01.840 --> 04:59:02.868 align:start position:0%
the eu now hit a 85 per ton price
um

04:59:02.868 --> 04:59:02.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:04.230 --> 04:59:04.240 align:start position:0%
and they're going to implement border
 
04:59:06.150 --> 04:59:06.160 align:start position:0%
carbon adjustments which means they're
 
04:59:08.550 --> 04:59:08.560 align:start position:0%
going to be charging us for our carbon
 
04:59:10.868 --> 04:59:10.878 align:start position:0%
pollution when we import goods
 
04:59:13.430 --> 04:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
into the eu marketplace 30 seconds
 
04:59:15.750 --> 04:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
canada is also looking at doing the same
 
04:59:18.230 --> 04:59:18.240 align:start position:0%
their price will be 135 dollars per ton
 
04:59:21.590 --> 04:59:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:21.600 --> 04:59:23.110 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:59:23.110 --> 04:59:23.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:59:24.390 --> 04:59:24.400 align:start position:0%
this is
 
04:59:25.830 --> 04:59:25.840 align:start position:0%
settled science
 
04:59:25.840 --> 04:59:26.868 align:start position:0%
settled science
um

04:59:26.868 --> 04:59:26.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:26.878 --> 04:59:28.310 align:start position:0%
um
economics

04:59:28.310 --> 04:59:28.320 align:start position:0%
economics
 
04:59:29.830 --> 04:59:29.840 align:start position:0%
says putting a price on carbon and
 
04:59:31.990 --> 04:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
rebated it is the most important first
 
04:59:34.310 --> 04:59:34.320 align:start position:0%
step to address this pollution problem
 
04:59:37.350 --> 04:59:37.360 align:start position:0%
congress is looking at doing it
 
04:59:39.030 --> 04:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
so we should let our towns and
 
04:59:39.040 --> 04:59:40.868 align:start position:0%
so we should let our towns and
municipalities

04:59:40.868 --> 04:59:40.878 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
04:59:43.830 --> 04:59:43.840 align:start position:0%
anticipate that and make good decisions
 
04:59:43.840 --> 04:59:44.788 align:start position:0%
anticipate that and make good decisions
um

04:59:44.788 --> 04:59:44.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:47.030 --> 04:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
and one of those would be to not
 
04:59:49.350 --> 04:59:49.360 align:start position:0%
encourage the development of fossil fuel
 
04:59:49.360 --> 04:59:50.550 align:start position:0%
encourage the development of fossil fuel
infrastructure

04:59:50.550 --> 04:59:50.560 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
04:59:52.708 --> 04:59:52.718 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you for your
 
04:59:55.030 --> 04:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
testimony appreciate it
 
04:59:57.110 --> 04:59:57.120 align:start position:0%
i'm sure we have questions i know i have
 
04:59:59.750 --> 04:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
a question uh my first question is is
 
05:00:02.310 --> 05:00:02.320 align:start position:0%
your primary objection to this
 
05:00:04.788 --> 05:00:04.798 align:start position:0%
legislation that it would remove local
 
05:00:04.798 --> 05:00:07.510 align:start position:0%
legislation that it would remove local
control

05:00:07.510 --> 05:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
control
 
05:00:10.310 --> 05:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
yes just as the example of concord
 
05:00:10.320 --> 05:00:11.190 align:start position:0%
yes just as the example of concord
was

05:00:11.190 --> 05:00:11.200 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:00:13.510 --> 05:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
talked about if a city makes a
 
05:00:15.270 --> 05:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
commitment to get down to net zero by
 
05:00:18.150 --> 05:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
2050 they should be allowed
 
05:00:20.628 --> 05:00:20.638 align:start position:0%
the leeway to set the policies so that
 
05:00:23.030 --> 05:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
they can achieve that goal
 
05:00:26.628 --> 05:00:26.638 align:start position:0%
okay further questions for mr gage
 
05:00:28.788 --> 05:00:28.798 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee is recognized thank
 
05:00:30.470 --> 05:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman and thank you mr gage
 
05:00:32.310 --> 05:00:32.320 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
05:00:34.470 --> 05:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
i know we have a very active energy
 
05:00:37.270 --> 05:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
committee in my town of hollis um and
 
05:00:38.788 --> 05:00:38.798 align:start position:0%
they're really trying to look at every
 
05:00:41.670 --> 05:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
way to save us money and also lower our
 
05:00:43.190 --> 05:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
missions at the same time so they've
 
05:00:43.200 --> 05:00:43.910 align:start position:0%
missions at the same time so they've
been

05:00:43.910 --> 05:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
been
 
05:00:46.708 --> 05:00:46.718 align:start position:0%
they've undertaken that planning uh
 
05:00:48.948 --> 05:00:48.958 align:start position:0%
many maybe 20 years now we've been
 
05:00:51.430 --> 05:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
working on it and you said you're also
 
05:00:53.270 --> 05:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
on an energy committee in your town as
 
05:00:57.190 --> 05:00:57.200 align:start position:0%
well right yes um so my question is
 
05:00:57.200 --> 05:00:59.270 align:start position:0%
well right yes um so my question is
uh

05:00:59.270 --> 05:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:01:01.510 --> 05:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding and maybe you can
 
05:01:03.110 --> 05:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
tell me because you're actually involved
 
05:01:05.350 --> 05:01:05.360 align:start position:0%
on an energy committee personally that
 
05:01:09.030 --> 05:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
the state encouraged towns to do this i
 
05:01:10.868 --> 05:01:10.878 align:start position:0%
i thought it was the state that actually
 
05:01:13.190 --> 05:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
asked towns to start looking at their
 
05:01:15.350 --> 05:01:15.360 align:start position:0%
planning locally because we are a sort
 
05:01:17.110 --> 05:01:17.120 align:start position:0%
of local control
 
05:01:19.750 --> 05:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
type of state so do you have any
 
05:01:21.350 --> 05:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
knowledge of that because i would like
 
05:01:23.590 --> 05:01:23.600 align:start position:0%
to know more about
 
05:01:26.470 --> 05:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
how that fits into this right
 
05:01:28.550 --> 05:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i don't know i i joined three
 
05:01:30.390 --> 05:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
years ago so maybe this was interesting
 
05:01:31.590 --> 05:01:31.600 align:start position:0%
you know before
 
05:01:33.670 --> 05:01:33.680 align:start position:0%
i'm very new i i got into this because
 
05:01:35.270 --> 05:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
of my concern about global warming and
 
05:01:36.628 --> 05:01:36.638 align:start position:0%
climate pollution
 
05:01:39.030 --> 05:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to help save my town and my
 
05:01:41.510 --> 05:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
state and my country money because
 
05:01:43.670 --> 05:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
if we lock in future fossil fuel
 
05:01:45.110 --> 05:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
investments they're going to become
 
05:01:47.830 --> 05:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
stranded costs so the oil and gas
 
05:01:49.910 --> 05:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
industry would love us to continue
 
05:01:51.750 --> 05:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
deploying infrastructure that uses their
 
05:01:53.110 --> 05:01:53.120 align:start position:0%
products because that locks us into
 
05:01:54.390 --> 05:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
their their
 
05:01:57.110 --> 05:01:57.120 align:start position:0%
fuels but we know from global
 
05:01:59.270 --> 05:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
momentum we're going to be paying other
 
05:02:01.430 --> 05:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
countries for our climate pollution
 
05:02:03.910 --> 05:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
soon if we don't put a price on it here
 
05:02:05.670 --> 05:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
if we put a price on it here we can
 
05:02:07.270 --> 05:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
recycle that money in our own economy
 
05:02:09.910 --> 05:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
and protect family budgets so it just
 
05:02:09.920 --> 05:02:10.868 align:start position:0%
and protect family budgets so it just
seems

05:02:10.868 --> 05:02:10.878 align:start position:0%
seems
 
05:02:12.788 --> 05:02:12.798 align:start position:0%
so simple to me that we need to price
 
05:02:14.788 --> 05:02:14.798 align:start position:0%
carbon at the federal level with border
 
05:02:17.190 --> 05:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
carbon adjustments and be the driver of
 
05:02:20.788 --> 05:02:20.798 align:start position:0%
the global policy follow-up follow up so
 
05:02:23.510 --> 05:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
05:02:25.270 --> 05:02:25.280 align:start position:0%
when the chairman asked if local control
 
05:02:27.030 --> 05:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
was your primary concern i think when i
 
05:02:28.550 --> 05:02:28.560 align:start position:0%
was first looking at this bill i was
 
05:02:30.550 --> 05:02:30.560 align:start position:0%
thinking of it in that regard but it
 
05:02:33.190 --> 05:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
sounds like you're talking about
 
05:02:35.110 --> 05:02:35.120 align:start position:0%
not just the environment but also the
 
05:02:35.120 --> 05:02:36.390 align:start position:0%
not just the environment but also the
economics

05:02:36.390 --> 05:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
economics
 
05:02:38.310 --> 05:02:38.320 align:start position:0%
right so you're making an argument on
 
05:02:40.230 --> 05:02:40.240 align:start position:0%
all three levels that you don't think
 
05:02:41.190 --> 05:02:41.200 align:start position:0%
this is
 
05:02:43.830 --> 05:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
desirable for new hampshire exactly
 
05:02:45.350 --> 05:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
fundamentally from an economic
 
05:02:45.360 --> 05:02:46.788 align:start position:0%
fundamentally from an economic
perspective

05:02:46.788 --> 05:02:46.798 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
05:02:46.798 --> 05:02:47.990 align:start position:0%
perspective
really

05:02:47.990 --> 05:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
really
 
05:02:49.510 --> 05:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
we're being pushed by industry to
 
05:02:51.430 --> 05:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
continue using their product
 
05:02:53.750 --> 05:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
or be manipulated by out of state
 
05:02:53.760 --> 05:02:55.030 align:start position:0%
or be manipulated by out of state
influences

05:02:55.030 --> 05:02:55.040 align:start position:0%
influences
 
05:02:55.040 --> 05:02:56.150 align:start position:0%
influences
and

05:02:56.150 --> 05:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:02:58.470 --> 05:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
we're an independent state we should be
 
05:02:58.480 --> 05:02:59.510 align:start position:0%
we're an independent state we should be
proud

05:02:59.510 --> 05:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
proud
 
05:03:02.310 --> 05:03:02.320 align:start position:0%
to do what we want at the local level
 
05:03:03.910 --> 05:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
and at the state level
 
05:03:05.110 --> 05:03:05.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:03:06.788 --> 05:03:06.798 align:start position:0%
thank you representative harrington is
 
05:03:08.390 --> 05:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question thank you mr
 
05:03:09.430 --> 05:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
05:03:11.590 --> 05:03:11.600 align:start position:0%
question you've mentioned stranded cost
 
05:03:13.030 --> 05:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
a number of times and i'm just trying to
 
05:03:15.190 --> 05:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
figure this out since in new hampshire
 
05:03:17.830 --> 05:03:17.840 align:start position:0%
now we only have merchant generators
 
05:03:19.990 --> 05:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
so if anyone was to plan on building a
 
05:03:22.550 --> 05:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
new fossil fuel plant since it would be
 
05:03:24.390 --> 05:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
a merchant generator it would not be
 
05:03:24.400 --> 05:03:25.670 align:start position:0%
a merchant generator it would not be
utility

05:03:25.670 --> 05:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
utility
 
05:03:27.510 --> 05:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
how would there ever be any stranded
 
05:03:29.270 --> 05:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
costs associated with that other than to
 
05:03:31.190 --> 05:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
the stockholders of the merchant
 
05:03:31.200 --> 05:03:32.230 align:start position:0%
the stockholders of the merchant
generator

05:03:32.230 --> 05:03:32.240 align:start position:0%
generator
 
05:03:33.830 --> 05:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
i guess i look at it from a holistic
 
05:03:36.070 --> 05:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
perspective of what the state has
 
05:03:37.430 --> 05:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
invested in
 
05:03:39.670 --> 05:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
so sb-82 i guess
 
05:03:41.350 --> 05:03:41.360 align:start position:0%
means that we can't
 
05:03:41.360 --> 05:03:42.628 align:start position:0%
means that we can't
prevent

05:03:42.628 --> 05:03:42.638 align:start position:0%
prevent
 
05:03:45.030 --> 05:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
people from installing gas for heating i
 
05:03:46.868 --> 05:03:46.878 align:start position:0%
think that's a bad economic decision
 
05:03:46.878 --> 05:03:48.310 align:start position:0%
think that's a bad economic decision
because

05:03:48.310 --> 05:03:48.320 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:03:50.868 --> 05:03:50.878 align:start position:0%
developers will put in gas heating it'll
 
05:03:52.628 --> 05:03:52.638 align:start position:0%
look like a cheap solution
 
05:03:55.270 --> 05:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
um but then when congress puts a price
 
05:03:56.390 --> 05:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
on carbon
 
05:03:58.470 --> 05:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
um energy prices will start going up and
 
05:04:01.270 --> 05:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
at some point those heating machines are
 
05:04:04.070 --> 05:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
going to become obsolete before they've
 
05:04:04.080 --> 05:04:05.270 align:start position:0%
going to become obsolete before they've
they've

05:04:05.270 --> 05:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
they've
 
05:04:07.110 --> 05:04:07.120 align:start position:0%
run the course of their life
 
05:04:08.708 --> 05:04:08.718 align:start position:0%
and they're going to have to be replaced
 
05:04:11.510 --> 05:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
so when i say stranded costs they're
 
05:04:11.520 --> 05:04:12.550 align:start position:0%
so when i say stranded costs they're
they're

05:04:12.550 --> 05:04:12.560 align:start position:0%
they're
 
05:04:14.390 --> 05:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
decisions throughout our whole economy
 
05:04:15.750 --> 05:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
that will affect
 
05:04:15.760 --> 05:04:17.110 align:start position:0%
that will affect
renters

05:04:17.110 --> 05:04:17.120 align:start position:0%
renters
 
05:04:17.120 --> 05:04:18.470 align:start position:0%
renters
businesses

05:04:18.470 --> 05:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
05:04:18.480 --> 05:04:19.590 align:start position:0%
businesses
homeowners

05:04:19.590 --> 05:04:19.600 align:start position:0%
homeowners
 
05:04:21.110 --> 05:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
we don't want to get locked into new
 
05:04:23.190 --> 05:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel investments right now
 
05:04:26.230 --> 05:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
because when there is a price on carbon
 
05:04:28.230 --> 05:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
that comes from above
 
05:04:29.510 --> 05:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to be getting stuck with
 
05:04:32.868 --> 05:04:32.878 align:start position:0%
things stranded cost stranded assets
 
05:04:35.590 --> 05:04:35.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up so just so i'm clear
 
05:04:37.030 --> 05:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
on this then when you're talking about
 
05:04:38.628 --> 05:04:38.638 align:start position:0%
stranded costs you're not talking about
 
05:04:41.030 --> 05:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
the normal sense of the term where in
 
05:04:42.390 --> 05:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
the case like for seabrook where there
 
05:04:44.230 --> 05:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
was stranded costs the millions of
 
05:04:46.310 --> 05:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
dollars the ratepayers had to pick up
 
05:04:47.910 --> 05:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
you're talking about someone who makes a
 
05:04:50.550 --> 05:04:50.560 align:start position:0%
decision on their own that i think it's
 
05:04:52.868 --> 05:04:52.878 align:start position:0%
best for me to put in a propane heating
 
05:04:54.628 --> 05:04:54.638 align:start position:0%
system in my new house
 
05:04:57.270 --> 05:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
and then five years whatever years later
 
05:04:59.510 --> 05:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
propane becomes very expensive so they
 
05:05:01.590 --> 05:05:01.600 align:start position:0%
have to go to some other option the cost
 
05:05:03.030 --> 05:05:03.040 align:start position:0%
you're talking about are the costs that
 
05:05:04.948 --> 05:05:04.958 align:start position:0%
would be borne by the person who made
 
05:05:06.628 --> 05:05:06.638 align:start position:0%
the decision to put the propane heating
 
05:05:08.150 --> 05:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
system in their house
 
05:05:10.628 --> 05:05:10.638 align:start position:0%
yeah at all different levels for example
 
05:05:12.708 --> 05:05:12.718 align:start position:0%
i got into this when the ned pipeline
 
05:05:14.948 --> 05:05:14.958 align:start position:0%
was trying to be deployed across
 
05:05:16.788 --> 05:05:16.798 align:start position:0%
southern new hampshire
 
05:05:18.550 --> 05:05:18.560 align:start position:0%
i didn't think a seven billion dollar
 
05:05:20.310 --> 05:05:20.320 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel infrastructure project was a
 
05:05:21.590 --> 05:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
good long-term
 
05:05:21.600 --> 05:05:22.310 align:start position:0%
good long-term
uh

05:05:22.310 --> 05:05:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:05:24.390 --> 05:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
investment in energy in our state i know
 
05:05:26.230 --> 05:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
we weren't going to be paying it but it
 
05:05:29.350 --> 05:05:29.360 align:start position:0%
is our economy the power of our economy
 
05:05:31.430 --> 05:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
is driven by decisions that are made if
 
05:05:32.470 --> 05:05:32.480 align:start position:0%
we make
 
05:05:34.868 --> 05:05:34.878 align:start position:0%
the wrong long-term decisions we invest
 
05:05:36.390 --> 05:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
billions of dollars in things that don't
 
05:05:37.910 --> 05:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
work out
 
05:05:39.510 --> 05:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
all of us lose
 
05:05:42.310 --> 05:05:42.320 align:start position:0%
some people's directly but the economy
 
05:05:46.390 --> 05:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:49.190 --> 05:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
uh representative lewicky is recognized
 
05:05:51.350 --> 05:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
for a question thank you mr chairman um
 
05:05:52.868 --> 05:05:52.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr gage
 
05:05:52.878 --> 05:05:53.830 align:start position:0%
thank you mr gage
i

05:05:53.830 --> 05:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:05:56.230 --> 05:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
am wondering who determines what science
 
05:05:58.708 --> 05:05:58.718 align:start position:0%
is settled what science is not and what
 
05:06:01.270 --> 05:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
happens when the science turns out to be
 
05:06:02.868 --> 05:06:02.878 align:start position:0%
not as subtle as it as it might have
 
05:06:02.878 --> 05:06:04.070 align:start position:0%
not as subtle as it as it might have
been

05:06:04.070 --> 05:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
been
 
05:06:06.550 --> 05:06:06.560 align:start position:0%
well climate science is 200 years old
 
05:06:08.830 --> 05:06:08.840 align:start position:0%
uh spent iranians in the
 
05:06:11.190 --> 05:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
1800s calculated just through simple
 
05:06:11.200 --> 05:06:12.310 align:start position:0%
1800s calculated just through simple
physics

05:06:12.310 --> 05:06:12.320 align:start position:0%
physics
 
05:06:15.350 --> 05:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
if we doubled co2 we'd get about
 
05:06:18.390 --> 05:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
four degrees of global warming
 
05:06:21.190 --> 05:06:21.200 align:start position:0%
this report is the best science we know
 
05:06:23.190 --> 05:06:23.200 align:start position:0%
it's based on all of the available
 
05:06:25.510 --> 05:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
evidence it's supported by every
 
05:06:28.310 --> 05:06:28.320 align:start position:0%
scientific organization in the world
 
05:06:31.190 --> 05:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
even exxon mobil had a scientific
 
05:06:33.430 --> 05:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
organization in the 70s and 80s they
 
05:06:35.510 --> 05:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
came to the same conclusions
 
05:06:38.310 --> 05:06:38.320 align:start position:0%
unfortunately for human civilization
 
05:06:40.708 --> 05:06:40.718 align:start position:0%
rather than promote the science and
 
05:06:42.150 --> 05:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
and promote congress addressing this
 
05:06:44.230 --> 05:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
pollution problem they chose a different
 
05:06:44.240 --> 05:06:45.030 align:start position:0%
pollution problem they chose a different
path

05:06:45.030 --> 05:06:45.040 align:start position:0%
path
 
05:06:48.150 --> 05:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
they funded misinformation and doubt
 
05:06:50.868 --> 05:06:50.878 align:start position:0%
about the science to delay addressing
 
05:06:52.390 --> 05:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
this pollution problem
 
05:06:54.230 --> 05:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
okay i'm going to stop you right there
 
05:06:56.788 --> 05:06:56.798 align:start position:0%
because we've strayed from the subject
 
05:06:58.708 --> 05:06:58.718 align:start position:0%
of this legislation
 
05:07:00.310 --> 05:07:00.320 align:start position:0%
uh we don't want to get into a
 
05:07:02.230 --> 05:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
discussion here of climate i'll just say
 
05:07:02.240 --> 05:07:03.030 align:start position:0%
discussion here of climate i'll just say
that

05:07:03.030 --> 05:07:03.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:07:04.628 --> 05:07:04.638 align:start position:0%
there's not a single scientific
 
05:07:06.470 --> 05:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
organization in the world
 
05:07:09.270 --> 05:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
that says this is wrong
 
05:07:11.030 --> 05:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
i i know of several so that's an
 
05:07:12.628 --> 05:07:12.638 align:start position:0%
incorrect i would love
 
05:07:14.948 --> 05:07:14.958 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts do you have
 
05:07:17.510 --> 05:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
a question yes please
 
05:07:17.520 --> 05:07:18.948 align:start position:0%
a question yes please
um

05:07:18.948 --> 05:07:18.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:22.708 --> 05:07:22.718 align:start position:0%
i'm going to go back to this legislation
 
05:07:25.430 --> 05:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to try to use
 
05:07:27.510 --> 05:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
an example to
 
05:07:30.470 --> 05:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
clarify what i think you're trying to
 
05:07:30.480 --> 05:07:31.910 align:start position:0%
clarify what i think you're trying to
say

05:07:31.910 --> 05:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
say
 
05:07:32.948 --> 05:07:32.958 align:start position:0%
and i
 
05:07:35.510 --> 05:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
i have to say that i can't agree with it
 
05:07:37.270 --> 05:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
but i i
 
05:07:39.510 --> 05:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
also all of medicine has told me that
 
05:07:41.190 --> 05:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
sticking a candy bar in my mouth is not
 
05:07:43.590 --> 05:07:43.600 align:start position:0%
the right thing i should do
 
05:07:43.600 --> 05:07:45.350 align:start position:0%
the right thing i should do
and

05:07:45.350 --> 05:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:07:47.750 --> 05:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
they could put a tax on that candy bar
 
05:07:50.070 --> 05:07:50.080 align:start position:0%
if i want that tax candy bar i'm going
 
05:07:51.910 --> 05:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
to eat that candy bar
 
05:07:55.590 --> 05:07:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:59.110 --> 05:07:59.120 align:start position:0%
the government's or anybody else's
 
05:08:01.590 --> 05:08:01.600 align:start position:0%
purview to tell me
 
05:08:01.600 --> 05:08:02.628 align:start position:0%
purview to tell me
don't

05:08:02.628 --> 05:08:02.638 align:start position:0%
don't
 
05:08:05.030 --> 05:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
make that bad decision
 
05:08:07.270 --> 05:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
and put that candy bar in your mouth in
 
05:08:10.150 --> 05:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
other words do does a town
 
05:08:11.750 --> 05:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
or a city
 
05:08:15.270 --> 05:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
have the right to make its own
 
05:08:17.350 --> 05:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
if need be bad decisions that i know
 
05:08:18.948 --> 05:08:18.958 align:start position:0%
plenty of bad decisions were made on
 
05:08:21.110 --> 05:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
cities and towns that's what we're doing
 
05:08:22.550 --> 05:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
here would take you
 
05:08:23.910 --> 05:08:23.920 align:start position:0%
in this bill
 
05:08:25.990 --> 05:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
you're taking away or i believe you're
 
05:08:27.830 --> 05:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
taking away the right
 
05:08:30.708 --> 05:08:30.718 align:start position:0%
of somebody or a group of people to make
 
05:08:33.430 --> 05:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
a bad decision should
 
05:08:37.350 --> 05:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
should that happen in this society
 
05:08:38.948 --> 05:08:38.958 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it
 
05:08:42.150 --> 05:08:42.160 align:start position:0%
i the way that i look at it is
 
05:08:44.310 --> 05:08:44.320 align:start position:0%
when the majority in the town decides
 
05:08:45.750 --> 05:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
that they're going to commit to net zero
 
05:08:47.510 --> 05:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
by 2050
 
05:08:50.470 --> 05:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
and they need policies to do that
 
05:08:52.230 --> 05:08:52.240 align:start position:0%
they might want to say we don't want any
 
05:08:53.830 --> 05:08:53.840 align:start position:0%
more natural gas
 
05:08:53.840 --> 05:08:55.430 align:start position:0%
more natural gas
infrastructure

05:08:55.430 --> 05:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
05:08:55.440 --> 05:08:56.550 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
installed

05:08:56.550 --> 05:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
installed
 
05:08:58.550 --> 05:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
to promote this because it's
 
05:09:01.350 --> 05:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
it's doesn't align with our goals so i
 
05:09:03.350 --> 05:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
think the state should not be
 
05:09:06.390 --> 05:09:06.400 align:start position:0%
deciding what towns can do
 
05:09:11.590 --> 05:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:14.150 --> 05:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
i preferences follow up even if in your
 
05:09:14.160 --> 05:09:15.590 align:start position:0%
i preferences follow up even if in your
opinion

05:09:15.590 --> 05:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
05:09:15.600 --> 05:09:16.708 align:start position:0%
opinion
or

05:09:16.708 --> 05:09:16.718 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:09:18.470 --> 05:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
the opinion of some of the people in the
 
05:09:18.480 --> 05:09:19.510 align:start position:0%
the opinion of some of the people in the
town

05:09:19.510 --> 05:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
town
 
05:09:21.030 --> 05:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
or even the majority of the people in
 
05:09:22.788 --> 05:09:22.798 align:start position:0%
the town and the council rules it's a
 
05:09:24.150 --> 05:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
bad decision
 
05:09:26.230 --> 05:09:26.240 align:start position:0%
yes they have the right to make that bad
 
05:09:26.240 --> 05:09:28.310 align:start position:0%
yes they have the right to make that bad
decision

05:09:28.310 --> 05:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
decision
 
05:09:31.350 --> 05:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
and that i that i'm asking you do you
 
05:09:32.868 --> 05:09:32.878 align:start position:0%
think that
 
05:09:35.590 --> 05:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
stopping people from doing that
 
05:09:35.600 --> 05:09:36.470 align:start position:0%
stopping people from doing that
is

05:09:36.470 --> 05:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:09:38.948 --> 05:09:38.958 align:start position:0%
with a hammer is more effective than
 
05:09:38.958 --> 05:09:41.990 align:start position:0%
with a hammer is more effective than
education

05:09:41.990 --> 05:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:43.910 --> 05:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
um you know the fossil fuel industry has
 
05:09:46.550 --> 05:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
way more money than anybody else to
 
05:09:48.708 --> 05:09:48.718 align:start position:0%
educate the public about what they want
 
05:09:48.718 --> 05:09:49.990 align:start position:0%
educate the public about what they want
so

05:09:49.990 --> 05:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:09:51.590 --> 05:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure it's a matter of educating
 
05:09:52.708 --> 05:09:52.718 align:start position:0%
the public
 
05:09:54.708 --> 05:09:54.718 align:start position:0%
when there's a committee that's charged
 
05:09:57.590 --> 05:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
with making energy decisions for a town
 
05:09:59.670 --> 05:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
and they study the science they look at
 
05:10:01.270 --> 05:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
what policy is happening around the
 
05:10:03.510 --> 05:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
world and what's happening at the con at
 
05:10:05.510 --> 05:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
the federal level
 
05:10:06.788 --> 05:10:06.798 align:start position:0%
i think they ought to be able to make
 
05:10:09.270 --> 05:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
decisions that they think are best for
 
05:10:11.030 --> 05:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
the town and
 
05:10:12.550 --> 05:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
whether they're right or not
 
05:10:14.230 --> 05:10:14.240 align:start position:0%
local control is important to new
 
05:10:18.230 --> 05:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire and i i think taking it away
 
05:10:21.190 --> 05:10:21.200 align:start position:0%
is a mistake i'll bet anybody here
 
05:10:22.788 --> 05:10:22.798 align:start position:0%
that there will be a price on carbon at
 
05:10:26.948 --> 05:10:26.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:29.670 --> 05:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
okay further questions for mr gage
 
05:10:32.628 --> 05:10:32.638 align:start position:0%
representative partial
 
05:10:35.350 --> 05:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and welcome
 
05:10:37.910 --> 05:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
now let me if i understand this we're
 
05:10:39.590 --> 05:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
talking about energy decisions which
 
05:10:42.070 --> 05:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
also are economic decisions
 
05:10:43.030 --> 05:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
and these
 
05:10:45.990 --> 05:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
economic decisions they will be born by
 
05:10:48.470 --> 05:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
the municipality should they choose
 
05:10:51.270 --> 05:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
correctly or incorrectly
 
05:10:51.280 --> 05:10:52.470 align:start position:0%
correctly or incorrectly
so

05:10:52.470 --> 05:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:10:54.708 --> 05:10:54.718 align:start position:0%
what we have here if i understand this
 
05:10:56.550 --> 05:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
correctly and please correct me this is
 
05:10:57.830 --> 05:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
a question
 
05:11:01.270 --> 05:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
um if we seed the authority on making
 
05:11:04.230 --> 05:11:04.240 align:start position:0%
these decisions to the state level or to
 
05:11:04.240 --> 05:11:05.590 align:start position:0%
these decisions to the state level or to
the

05:11:05.590 --> 05:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:11:05.600 --> 05:11:07.430 align:start position:0%
the
regulatory

05:11:07.430 --> 05:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
regulatory
 
05:11:10.708 --> 05:11:10.718 align:start position:0%
to the suppliers of these uh
 
05:11:10.718 --> 05:11:12.550 align:start position:0%
to the suppliers of these uh
systems

05:11:12.550 --> 05:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
systems
 
05:11:12.560 --> 05:11:13.590 align:start position:0%
systems
then

05:11:13.590 --> 05:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
then
 
05:11:16.150 --> 05:11:16.160 align:start position:0%
we could be left holding the price tag
 
05:11:18.390 --> 05:11:18.400 align:start position:0%
on their bad decision
 
05:11:20.150 --> 05:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
is that the way i read this
 
05:11:22.550 --> 05:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
that's exactly how i look at it it's in
 
05:11:24.470 --> 05:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
the fossil fuels in just industries
 
05:11:26.230 --> 05:11:26.240 align:start position:0%
interest to get us to continue using
 
05:11:27.510 --> 05:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
their product
 
05:11:29.670 --> 05:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
it's in the public's interest
 
05:11:31.750 --> 05:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
to have a broader view of what's going
 
05:11:33.270 --> 05:11:33.280 align:start position:0%
on around the world
 
05:11:35.110 --> 05:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
to understand pollution
 
05:11:37.750 --> 05:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
and to not be fooled into making
 
05:11:39.830 --> 05:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
expensive decisions
 
05:11:41.510 --> 05:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
that will hurt us in the end that was
 
05:11:42.868 --> 05:11:42.878 align:start position:0%
enough thinking for me i don't have a
 
05:11:44.830 --> 05:11:44.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up okay thank
 
05:11:47.590 --> 05:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
you additional questions representative
 
05:11:47.600 --> 05:11:50.948 align:start position:0%
you additional questions representative
samsich

05:11:50.948 --> 05:11:50.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:52.868 --> 05:11:52.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
 
05:11:55.830 --> 05:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
gage for coming today um
 
05:11:57.830 --> 05:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
in your opinion is
 
05:12:00.390 --> 05:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
would this bill be an encumbrance and an
 
05:12:02.708 --> 05:12:02.718 align:start position:0%
obstacle to communities who are now
 
05:12:04.868 --> 05:12:04.878 align:start position:0%
considering community power as one of
 
05:12:07.910 --> 05:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
their options locally uh to implement
 
05:12:09.750 --> 05:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
and with this is a bill we passed just
 
05:12:11.030 --> 05:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
last year
 
05:12:12.948 --> 05:12:12.958 align:start position:0%
yes i think so i hadn't thought about
 
05:12:14.550 --> 05:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
that until
 
05:12:17.590 --> 05:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
it was brought up earlier but
 
05:12:18.948 --> 05:12:18.958 align:start position:0%
you know when you start making
 
05:12:20.628 --> 05:12:20.638 align:start position:0%
regulations about who can do what at a
 
05:12:22.470 --> 05:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
high level you have all kinds of
 
05:12:25.590 --> 05:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences i i don't think
 
05:12:27.510 --> 05:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
the state should do that in this case
 
05:12:29.990 --> 05:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
there's lots of reasons that local
 
05:12:31.830 --> 05:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
regions might want to control
 
05:12:34.310 --> 05:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
their power locally and i think we
 
05:12:36.628 --> 05:12:36.638 align:start position:0%
should give them that option
 
05:12:36.638 --> 05:12:38.230 align:start position:0%
should give them that option
follow-up

05:12:38.230 --> 05:12:38.240 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:12:38.240 --> 05:12:39.350 align:start position:0%
follow-up
follow-up

05:12:39.350 --> 05:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:12:40.628 --> 05:12:40.638 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:12:44.150 --> 05:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
also um in light of the fact that
 
05:12:46.628 --> 05:12:46.638 align:start position:0%
local decisions
 
05:12:49.110 --> 05:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
end up paying getting paid by local
 
05:12:49.120 --> 05:12:50.788 align:start position:0%
end up paying getting paid by local
taxpayers

05:12:50.788 --> 05:12:50.798 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
05:12:52.230 --> 05:12:52.240 align:start position:0%
don't you believe that local
 
05:12:54.390 --> 05:12:54.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities should have the priority
 
05:12:56.788 --> 05:12:56.798 align:start position:0%
to make their own decisions instead of
 
05:12:59.270 --> 05:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
dictating mandates from the state i
 
05:13:00.470 --> 05:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
certainly do
 
05:13:03.430 --> 05:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
that's a very important part i one of
 
05:13:04.470 --> 05:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
the first
 
05:13:07.830 --> 05:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
things i ever testified at was in pelham
 
05:13:11.990 --> 05:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
gas company wanted to increase the
 
05:13:12.000 --> 05:13:14.390 align:start position:0%
gas company wanted to increase the
10-year

05:13:14.390 --> 05:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
10-year
 
05:13:16.070 --> 05:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
license for their compressor station in
 
05:13:16.080 --> 05:13:17.030 align:start position:0%
license for their compressor station in
pelham

05:13:17.030 --> 05:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
pelham
 
05:13:18.628 --> 05:13:18.638 align:start position:0%
and i testified and i said are you
 
05:13:20.150 --> 05:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
considering the pollution that's going
 
05:13:22.708 --> 05:13:22.718 align:start position:0%
to be released by continuing using this
 
05:13:25.030 --> 05:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
in pelham and he said well that's not
 
05:13:27.910 --> 05:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
written into the state's statute
 
05:13:30.150 --> 05:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
we can't consider pollution
 
05:13:31.910 --> 05:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
and i live two miles away from that
 
05:13:34.628 --> 05:13:34.638 align:start position:0%
compressor station and and methane
 
05:13:36.788 --> 05:13:36.798 align:start position:0%
is released all the time for those
 
05:13:38.628 --> 05:13:38.638 align:start position:0%
things for various reasons and it causes
 
05:13:41.190 --> 05:13:41.200 align:start position:0%
asthma which my daughter has and health
 
05:13:43.750 --> 05:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
problems so you know
 
05:13:46.470 --> 05:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
local control for energy because it's a
 
05:13:48.550 --> 05:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
very polluting thing i think is very
 
05:13:48.560 --> 05:13:49.750 align:start position:0%
very polluting thing i think is very
important

05:13:49.750 --> 05:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
important
 
05:13:53.030 --> 05:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:13:55.990 --> 05:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
further questions representative mcgee
 
05:13:57.510 --> 05:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
this is your second
 
05:13:59.590 --> 05:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
round of questions right
 
05:13:59.600 --> 05:14:00.788 align:start position:0%
round of questions right
okay

05:14:00.788 --> 05:14:00.798 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:14:03.590 --> 05:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
and last right okay thank you i'll do my
 
05:14:03.600 --> 05:14:04.628 align:start position:0%
and last right okay thank you i'll do my
best

05:14:04.628 --> 05:14:04.638 align:start position:0%
best
 
05:14:08.230 --> 05:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
okay so um to try to kind of wrap up
 
05:14:10.310 --> 05:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
what has just been said
 
05:14:10.320 --> 05:14:12.948 align:start position:0%
what has just been said
um

05:14:12.948 --> 05:14:12.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:16.470 --> 05:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
i think the the bill is striving to say
 
05:14:16.480 --> 05:14:17.270 align:start position:0%
i think the the bill is striving to say
that

05:14:17.270 --> 05:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:14:19.350 --> 05:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
local control shouldn't be allowed to
 
05:14:21.510 --> 05:14:21.520 align:start position:0%
sort of get in the way of decisions that
 
05:14:24.708 --> 05:14:24.718 align:start position:0%
at this point local municipalities have
 
05:14:26.948 --> 05:14:26.958 align:start position:0%
kind of taken responsibility for
 
05:14:28.948 --> 05:14:28.958 align:start position:0%
and i guess
 
05:14:32.070 --> 05:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
i've also heard you say um or someone
 
05:14:33.910 --> 05:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
else said
 
05:14:36.070 --> 05:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
that it's sort of a one-size-fits-all
 
05:14:37.670 --> 05:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
approach to
 
05:14:39.590 --> 05:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
you know nobody should be able to say
 
05:14:39.600 --> 05:14:40.390 align:start position:0%
you know nobody should be able to say
what

05:14:40.390 --> 05:14:40.400 align:start position:0%
what
 
05:14:42.150 --> 05:14:42.160 align:start position:0%
what is good and bad
 
05:14:44.310 --> 05:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
right for their town
 
05:14:46.150 --> 05:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
and i guess
 
05:14:48.470 --> 05:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
what i see in looking at it in terms of
 
05:14:49.750 --> 05:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
it being a law
 
05:14:52.070 --> 05:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
is that there's a gap here because
 
05:14:53.990 --> 05:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
those decisions are presently being made
 
05:14:56.628 --> 05:14:56.638 align:start position:0%
at the local level and so they're
 
05:14:58.628 --> 05:14:58.638 align:start position:0%
if you're no longer able to make those
 
05:15:00.070 --> 05:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
decisions because that power was taken
 
05:15:01.350 --> 05:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
away from you
 
05:15:04.230 --> 05:15:04.240 align:start position:0%
then the ability to really discuss and
 
05:15:07.110 --> 05:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
and uncover the solutions for your town
 
05:15:08.948 --> 05:15:08.958 align:start position:0%
kind of get eliminated
 
05:15:11.510 --> 05:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
um and so that's the that's just the
 
05:15:14.868 --> 05:15:14.878 align:start position:0%
point i wanted to make is do you see
 
05:15:16.788 --> 05:15:16.798 align:start position:0%
that's what i see here is do you see
 
05:15:18.708 --> 05:15:18.718 align:start position:0%
that i agree that the town should be
 
05:15:20.868 --> 05:15:20.878 align:start position:0%
able to make its own economic and
 
05:15:24.230 --> 05:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
environmental decisions uh based on how
 
05:15:26.868 --> 05:15:26.878 align:start position:0%
the citizens of that town choose to live
 
05:15:28.470 --> 05:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
and how what they think is coming in the
 
05:15:30.150 --> 05:15:30.160 align:start position:0%
future and how they can best prepare for
 
05:15:32.310 --> 05:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
that we don't generally use one size
 
05:15:33.910 --> 05:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
fits all so i just feel like it's kind
 
05:15:38.868 --> 05:15:38.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:40.868 --> 05:15:40.878 align:start position:0%
yeah that's all that's all i have to do
 
05:15:43.510 --> 05:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:48.070 --> 05:15:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:51.350 --> 05:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
i have another question for you mr gage
 
05:15:53.830 --> 05:15:53.840 align:start position:0%
if i live in a town
 
05:15:57.510 --> 05:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
that's in the pathway of a highway say
 
05:15:59.110 --> 05:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
route 101.
 
05:16:01.590 --> 05:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
and the state wants to root route 101
 
05:16:03.590 --> 05:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
through my town
 
05:16:03.600 --> 05:16:05.350 align:start position:0%
through my town
should

05:16:05.350 --> 05:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
should
 
05:16:08.310 --> 05:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
my town have the ability to say no
 
05:16:12.470 --> 05:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
to that state highway which could impede
 
05:16:14.868 --> 05:16:14.878 align:start position:0%
orderly travel throughout the state and
 
05:16:17.270 --> 05:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
provide great economic benefits to the
 
05:16:17.280 --> 05:16:18.550 align:start position:0%
provide great economic benefits to the
state

05:16:18.550 --> 05:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:16:20.708 --> 05:16:20.718 align:start position:0%
should my town be allowed to
 
05:16:23.270 --> 05:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
to say no anyway
 
05:16:25.670 --> 05:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's a very good analogy
 
05:16:27.990 --> 05:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
chairman because
 
05:16:30.470 --> 05:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
transportation goes from place to place
 
05:16:32.150 --> 05:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
and there's obviously benefits in having
 
05:16:34.708 --> 05:16:34.718 align:start position:0%
highways to travel long distances
 
05:16:35.990 --> 05:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
whereas what we see with power
 
05:16:36.000 --> 05:16:37.750 align:start position:0%
whereas what we see with power
generation

05:16:37.750 --> 05:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
generation
 
05:16:40.470 --> 05:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
it is shrinking it's becoming local
 
05:16:40.480 --> 05:16:41.750 align:start position:0%
it is shrinking it's becoming local
distributed

05:16:41.750 --> 05:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
distributed
 
05:16:41.760 --> 05:16:43.110 align:start position:0%
distributed
resources

05:16:43.110 --> 05:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
resources
 
05:16:45.590 --> 05:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
which is going to push the decisions
 
05:16:48.070 --> 05:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
down to local levels i mean we can have
 
05:16:51.190 --> 05:16:51.200 align:start position:0%
an energy independent future
 
05:16:53.270 --> 05:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
if all every each town produces its own
 
05:16:55.510 --> 05:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
electricity and they ought to be able to
 
05:16:57.910 --> 05:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
do that how they choose i think having
 
05:16:59.190 --> 05:16:59.200 align:start position:0%
the state
 
05:17:01.910 --> 05:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
you know kind of take the
 
05:17:04.310 --> 05:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
the side of fossil fuel industries
 
05:17:06.708 --> 05:17:06.718 align:start position:0%
because they don't want this
 
05:17:09.190 --> 05:17:09.200 align:start position:0%
is damaging in a whole bunch of ways uh
 
05:17:12.070 --> 05:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
to our state uh and particularly to
 
05:17:14.470 --> 05:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
itan's independence and how they want to
 
05:17:19.990 --> 05:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:21.910 --> 05:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
okay so you didn't comment on the
 
05:17:21.920 --> 05:17:23.270 align:start position:0%
okay so you didn't comment on the
concept

05:17:23.270 --> 05:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
concept
 
05:17:26.150 --> 05:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
you just commented on the fact that
 
05:17:27.910 --> 05:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
you think a town should be able to say
 
05:17:30.150 --> 05:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
no for certain things but not for other
 
05:17:32.948 --> 05:17:32.958 align:start position:0%
things i think transportation is a poor
 
05:17:35.110 --> 05:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
analogy there are a lot of ways to
 
05:17:36.788 --> 05:17:36.798 align:start position:0%
produce electricity there's only one
 
05:17:38.708 --> 05:17:38.718 align:start position:0%
place to only one way to get cars from
 
05:17:41.110 --> 05:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
here to there
 
05:17:43.350 --> 05:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative bernardi
 
05:17:45.750 --> 05:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
is recognized for a question
 
05:17:47.670 --> 05:17:47.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
05:17:50.788 --> 05:17:50.798 align:start position:0%
mr gage as i read this bill it talks
 
05:17:50.798 --> 05:17:51.750 align:start position:0%
mr gage as i read this bill it talks
about

05:17:51.750 --> 05:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:17:55.030 --> 05:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
all types of fuel sources so
 
05:17:57.350 --> 05:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
fuel sources such as
 
05:18:00.070 --> 05:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
wind or solar power and dispatching them
 
05:18:00.080 --> 05:18:00.868 align:start position:0%
wind or solar power and dispatching them
on

05:18:00.868 --> 05:18:00.878 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:18:00.878 --> 05:18:02.230 align:start position:0%
on
online

05:18:02.230 --> 05:18:02.240 align:start position:0%
online
 
05:18:04.628 --> 05:18:04.638 align:start position:0%
throughout a community on a microgrid or
 
05:18:07.830 --> 05:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
whatever uh are equally covered compared
 
05:18:07.840 --> 05:18:08.948 align:start position:0%
whatever uh are equally covered compared
to

05:18:08.948 --> 05:18:08.958 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:18:12.628 --> 05:18:12.638 align:start position:0%
uh fossil fuel distribution lines
 
05:18:12.638 --> 05:18:14.230 align:start position:0%
uh fossil fuel distribution lines
so

05:18:14.230 --> 05:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:18:17.590 --> 05:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
are you against the bill in its entirety
 
05:18:18.868 --> 05:18:18.878 align:start position:0%
or just
 
05:18:18.878 --> 05:18:19.670 align:start position:0%
or just
for

05:18:19.670 --> 05:18:19.680 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:18:21.910 --> 05:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels
 
05:18:25.030 --> 05:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
in its entirety uh i think towns should
 
05:18:27.590 --> 05:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
have the the power to make decisions
 
05:18:29.590 --> 05:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
about how they want to generate energy
 
05:18:32.628 --> 05:18:32.638 align:start position:0%
in the future this is happening uh we
 
05:18:34.708 --> 05:18:34.718 align:start position:0%
should encourage community power and
 
05:18:37.110 --> 05:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
other things like that it builds
 
05:18:37.120 --> 05:18:38.310 align:start position:0%
other things like that it builds
resilience

05:18:38.310 --> 05:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
resilience
 
05:18:40.150 --> 05:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
in the long term it's going to
 
05:18:42.708 --> 05:18:42.718 align:start position:0%
produce much cheaper power
 
05:18:45.990 --> 05:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh in town the the the trend is for
 
05:18:48.470 --> 05:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
towns to be looking into how they want
 
05:18:51.190 --> 05:18:51.200 align:start position:0%
to provide power to their citizens i i
 
05:18:52.628 --> 05:18:52.638 align:start position:0%
think the state should not get in the
 
05:18:57.110 --> 05:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:57.120 --> 05:18:58.310 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

05:18:58.310 --> 05:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:19:00.708 --> 05:19:00.718 align:start position:0%
no follow-up representative berezni is
 
05:19:02.628 --> 05:19:02.638 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
 
05:19:04.550 --> 05:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
 
05:19:06.550 --> 05:19:06.560 align:start position:0%
gage for taking my question uh would
 
05:19:09.190 --> 05:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
this bill prevent a town from generating
 
05:19:11.510 --> 05:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
its own electricity and can you explain
 
05:19:11.520 --> 05:19:13.190 align:start position:0%
its own electricity and can you explain
how

05:19:13.190 --> 05:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
how
 
05:19:14.868 --> 05:19:14.878 align:start position:0%
that community power would not be
 
05:19:18.628 --> 05:19:18.638 align:start position:0%
possible if this passes thank you
 
05:19:20.390 --> 05:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
i think you want henry earned in here
 
05:19:22.230 --> 05:19:22.240 align:start position:0%
not me to talk about this
 
05:19:22.240 --> 05:19:24.230 align:start position:0%
not me to talk about this
um

05:19:24.230 --> 05:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:27.430 --> 05:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
i it's a very high level summary of what
 
05:19:29.590 --> 05:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
would happen but you're restricting the
 
05:19:31.030 --> 05:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
town's ability
 
05:19:31.040 --> 05:19:32.550 align:start position:0%
town's ability
to

05:19:32.550 --> 05:19:32.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:19:34.550 --> 05:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
chart a course to meet their goals for
 
05:19:37.590 --> 05:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
power generation in the future
 
05:19:39.190 --> 05:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
the town should be able to decide if it
 
05:19:41.670 --> 05:19:41.680 align:start position:0%
wants to burn trash to generate
 
05:19:43.430 --> 05:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
electricity or not it should be able to
 
05:19:45.830 --> 05:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
decide if it wants a five megabit
 
05:19:48.948 --> 05:19:48.958 align:start position:0%
megawatt solar installation or not
 
05:19:51.350 --> 05:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
it should be able to decide if it wants
 
05:19:53.430 --> 05:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
natural gas piped in
 
05:19:56.628 --> 05:19:56.638 align:start position:0%
uh to generate electricity or not
 
05:19:59.110 --> 05:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
there's economic
 
05:19:59.910 --> 05:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:20:02.230 --> 05:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
current economic
 
05:20:04.788 --> 05:20:04.798 align:start position:0%
questions to answer that and long-term
 
05:20:06.230 --> 05:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
economic questions
 
05:20:07.750 --> 05:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
to determine those
 
05:20:10.550 --> 05:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
those answers as well as environmental a
 
05:20:11.750 --> 05:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
lot of people in new hampshire just
 
05:20:13.110 --> 05:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
don't like pollution
 
05:20:15.830 --> 05:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
and they are willing to pay more even
 
05:20:17.430 --> 05:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
for power that's generated through
 
05:20:19.750 --> 05:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
cleaner sources
 
05:20:21.030 --> 05:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
a town should be able to make its
 
05:20:22.310 --> 05:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
decision about how it wants its
 
05:20:24.948 --> 05:20:24.958 align:start position:0%
electricity generated
 
05:20:24.958 --> 05:20:26.788 align:start position:0%
electricity generated
follow-up

05:20:26.788 --> 05:20:26.798 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:20:29.350 --> 05:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
so if a town wants to install
 
05:20:31.910 --> 05:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
a huge array of solar panels how would
 
05:20:34.230 --> 05:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
this build prevent the town from doing
 
05:20:38.070 --> 05:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:39.350 --> 05:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
i think isn't that
 
05:20:41.110 --> 05:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
basically the bill says
 
05:20:42.548 --> 05:20:42.558 align:start position:0%
the town cannot
 
05:20:44.310 --> 05:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
restrict any
 
05:20:47.430 --> 05:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
fuel or electric sources so i guess
 
05:20:49.350 --> 05:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
if like
 
05:20:51.110 --> 05:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
if it's particularly about fuels i guess
 
05:20:55.910 --> 05:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:58.390 --> 05:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
maybe trash is a better example
 
05:20:58.400 --> 05:20:59.830 align:start position:0%
maybe trash is a better example
clarification

05:20:59.830 --> 05:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
05:21:02.070 --> 05:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
yeah can you can you clarify that if if
 
05:21:03.910 --> 05:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
the town wants to install if the
 
05:21:06.948 --> 05:21:06.958 align:start position:0%
municipality wants to install a large
 
05:21:10.070 --> 05:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
solar array how would this bill prevent
 
05:21:12.070 --> 05:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
them from doing that
 
05:21:14.070 --> 05:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
actually i don't know if it would or not
 
05:21:16.070 --> 05:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
somebody else may be able to answer
 
05:21:20.150 --> 05:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:23.110 --> 05:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
it would not it would seem
 
05:21:25.590 --> 05:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
it would not prevent them
 
05:21:28.070 --> 05:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
but i was going to ask and i probably
 
05:21:30.230 --> 05:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
should have asked the sponsor this bill
 
05:21:33.830 --> 05:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
in no way prevents
 
05:21:35.990 --> 05:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
and going to court and finding out if
 
05:21:38.628 --> 05:21:38.638 align:start position:0%
what we've done is legitimate so if a
 
05:21:41.190 --> 05:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
company wanted to put a cold powered
 
05:21:43.030 --> 05:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
plant in the this
 
05:21:45.110 --> 05:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
you know and the town didn't want it it
 
05:21:48.230 --> 05:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
does not prevent the town from appealing
 
05:21:48.240 --> 05:21:49.030 align:start position:0%
does not prevent the town from appealing
this

05:21:49.030 --> 05:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:21:50.948 --> 05:21:50.958 align:start position:0%
and i think i'm not a lawyer but i think
 
05:21:54.150 --> 05:21:54.160 align:start position:0%
that's very important that the town will
 
05:21:56.150 --> 05:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
still have rights i'm not saying i'm for
 
05:21:58.070 --> 05:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
or against this bill but
 
05:22:00.948 --> 05:22:00.958 align:start position:0%
we forget that sometimes that the town
 
05:22:05.350 --> 05:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:07.830 --> 05:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you i think i mean speaking
 
05:22:09.510 --> 05:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
as a local energy
 
05:22:12.070 --> 05:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
committee person in town towns don't
 
05:22:13.590 --> 05:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
have a lot of resources so if you're
 
05:22:16.628 --> 05:22:16.638 align:start position:0%
talking about using the legal system to
 
05:22:17.670 --> 05:22:17.680 align:start position:0%
address the right that's already
 
05:22:19.350 --> 05:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
happened that's a wrong i
 
05:22:21.990 --> 05:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
you know i think this is simply a state
 
05:22:24.948 --> 05:22:24.958 align:start position:0%
control versus a local control issue
 
05:22:27.830 --> 05:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh and the the local control for
 
05:22:29.990 --> 05:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
economic reasons and environmental
 
05:22:33.830 --> 05:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:33.840 --> 05:22:34.628 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:22:34.628 --> 05:22:34.638 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:22:34.638 --> 05:22:35.510 align:start position:0%
okay
uh

05:22:35.510 --> 05:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:22:37.910 --> 05:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
before i take rep let representative
 
05:22:39.670 --> 05:22:39.680 align:start position:0%
samsung ask a question i have another
 
05:22:41.030 --> 05:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
question for you
 
05:22:43.510 --> 05:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
what about individual
 
05:22:46.230 --> 05:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
rights and individual control
 
05:22:47.430 --> 05:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
let's say that
 
05:22:50.070 --> 05:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
i have a house and i want to
 
05:22:51.910 --> 05:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
install a
 
05:22:54.628 --> 05:22:54.638 align:start position:0%
natural gas heating system
 
05:22:58.628 --> 05:22:58.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:00.948 --> 05:23:00.958 align:start position:0%
refuses to let a natural gas company
 
05:23:04.628 --> 05:23:04.638 align:start position:0%
build a pipeline to serve the town
 
05:23:07.510 --> 05:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
is the town then taking away
 
05:23:10.390 --> 05:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
my control over my
 
05:23:14.628 --> 05:23:14.638 align:start position:0%
energy choices and is that legitimate
 
05:23:17.030 --> 05:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
well i think if the town has decided
 
05:23:17.040 --> 05:23:17.910 align:start position:0%
well i think if the town has decided
to

05:23:17.910 --> 05:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:23:20.390 --> 05:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
not burn coal in that town and you
 
05:23:22.310 --> 05:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
really want to burn coal there's other
 
05:23:22.320 --> 05:23:23.590 align:start position:0%
really want to burn coal there's other
towns

05:23:23.590 --> 05:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
towns
 
05:23:26.628 --> 05:23:26.638 align:start position:0%
so you have certain rights but we also
 
05:23:28.948 --> 05:23:28.958 align:start position:0%
have certain social responsibilities
 
05:23:31.910 --> 05:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
and addressing pollution is an important
 
05:23:33.270 --> 05:23:33.280 align:start position:0%
part of
 
05:23:35.910 --> 05:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
the social contract that we all make if
 
05:23:39.190 --> 05:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
if a town decides that the
 
05:23:40.868 --> 05:23:40.878 align:start position:0%
the economics don't work out because
 
05:23:41.830 --> 05:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
they think that there's going to be a
 
05:23:43.990 --> 05:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
price on carbon and the local pollution
 
05:23:45.430 --> 05:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't work out because they want clean
 
05:23:48.310 --> 05:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
air and water and a stable climate then
 
05:23:50.390 --> 05:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
they ought to be able to make a decision
 
05:23:52.230 --> 05:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
um and if
 
05:23:55.110 --> 05:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
if you don't like the decision um
 
05:23:57.270 --> 05:23:57.280 align:start position:0%
you either live with it or go to another
 
05:23:59.750 --> 05:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
town but we make decisions locally all
 
05:24:01.510 --> 05:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
the time about how much we invest in our
 
05:24:01.520 --> 05:24:02.470 align:start position:0%
the time about how much we invest in our
schools

05:24:02.470 --> 05:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
schools
 
05:24:02.480 --> 05:24:03.670 align:start position:0%
schools
um

05:24:03.670 --> 05:24:03.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:05.990 --> 05:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
you know how roads are maintained
 
05:24:07.510 --> 05:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
all of these are political decisions
 
05:24:09.270 --> 05:24:09.280 align:start position:0%
that you decide whether you want to live
 
05:24:10.548 --> 05:24:10.558 align:start position:0%
in the town or not
 
05:24:11.590 --> 05:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
based on
 
05:24:13.670 --> 05:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
representative samsic
 
05:24:15.750 --> 05:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh and thank you
 
05:24:18.070 --> 05:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
mr gage um
 
05:24:18.080 --> 05:24:19.750 align:start position:0%
mr gage um
if

05:24:19.750 --> 05:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:24:22.070 --> 05:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
would you agree with me that if if i
 
05:24:24.548 --> 05:24:24.558 align:start position:0%
lived in a scenic town in
 
05:24:26.868 --> 05:24:26.878 align:start position:0%
somewhere in new hampshire nor north of
 
05:24:26.878 --> 05:24:27.990 align:start position:0%
somewhere in new hampshire nor north of
here

05:24:27.990 --> 05:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:24:30.548 --> 05:24:30.558 align:start position:0%
and that town because it's a touristy
 
05:24:32.788 --> 05:24:32.798 align:start position:0%
town and it values the environmental
 
05:24:34.830 --> 05:24:34.840 align:start position:0%
resources around it
 
05:24:37.430 --> 05:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
decides uh for example through community
 
05:24:39.190 --> 05:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
power or otherwise
 
05:24:40.788 --> 05:24:40.798 align:start position:0%
that that
 
05:24:43.910 --> 05:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
municipality is only gonna
 
05:24:45.910 --> 05:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
generate generate or
 
05:24:45.920 --> 05:24:46.788 align:start position:0%
generate generate or
buy

05:24:46.788 --> 05:24:46.798 align:start position:0%
buy
 
05:24:48.788 --> 05:24:48.798 align:start position:0%
renewable energy
 
05:24:51.030 --> 05:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
then they would be in violation of this
 
05:24:53.190 --> 05:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
spill if it passed is that correct
 
05:24:54.628 --> 05:24:54.638 align:start position:0%
that's how i read it i think they would
 
05:24:57.030 --> 05:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
be really limited in what decisions the
 
05:25:01.670 --> 05:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
town could could make yes thank you
 
05:25:01.680 --> 05:25:02.708 align:start position:0%
town could could make yes thank you
okay

05:25:02.708 --> 05:25:02.718 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:25:05.910 --> 05:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
any uh additional questions for mr gage
 
05:25:08.390 --> 05:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
seeing none i thank you mr gage for your
 
05:25:10.548 --> 05:25:10.558 align:start position:0%

05:31:34.628 --> 05:31:34.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:46.868 --> 05:31:46.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:46.878 --> 05:32:39.510 align:start position:0%
 
is

05:32:39.510 --> 05:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:39.520 --> 05:33:10.390 align:start position:0%
 
yes

05:33:10.390 --> 05:33:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:46.788 --> 05:33:46.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:49.030 --> 05:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
all right everyone i call to order the
 
05:33:51.230 --> 05:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
public hearing on house bill
 
05:33:51.240 --> 05:33:53.110 align:start position:0%
public hearing on house bill
1328

05:33:53.110 --> 05:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
1328
 
05:33:55.910 --> 05:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
a bill authorizing a utility to petition
 
05:33:58.470 --> 05:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
to be relieved of their carrier of last
 
05:34:01.830 --> 05:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
resort obligations and i introduce the
 
05:34:04.628 --> 05:34:04.638 align:start position:0%
bill's prime sponsor representative
 
05:34:07.110 --> 05:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
michael harrington
 
05:34:08.628 --> 05:34:08.638 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
05:34:10.788 --> 05:34:10.798 align:start position:0%
let me start out by saying there's one
 
05:34:12.390 --> 05:34:12.400 align:start position:0%
question that needs to be resolved on
 
05:34:14.470 --> 05:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
this bill that's more administrative
 
05:34:16.310 --> 05:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
than anything else and
 
05:34:17.990 --> 05:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
what it does is it
 
05:34:19.270 --> 05:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
talks about i'll get into the details
 
05:34:20.788 --> 05:34:20.798 align:start position:0%
for the second but it mentions the
 
05:34:22.230 --> 05:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
department of energy in multiple
 
05:34:25.030 --> 05:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
positions here i'm not positive yet as
 
05:34:27.030 --> 05:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
to whether it should be the puc or the
 
05:34:29.030 --> 05:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
department of energy the problem is
 
05:34:30.868 --> 05:34:30.878 align:start position:0%
neither group really has a telephone
 
05:34:33.350 --> 05:34:33.360 align:start position:0%
group in it at all so it's part of what
 
05:34:34.708 --> 05:34:34.718 align:start position:0%
looking at what we're looking at with
 
05:34:37.510 --> 05:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
the puc and the doe right now we'll come
 
05:34:40.070 --> 05:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
up with the decision where best goes
 
05:34:41.590 --> 05:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
so that's just so before that question
 
05:34:43.750 --> 05:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
gets asked so it's uh
 
05:34:43.760 --> 05:34:44.628 align:start position:0%
gets asked so it's uh
um

05:34:44.628 --> 05:34:44.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:46.548 --> 05:34:46.558 align:start position:0%
maybe someone from doe could comment on
 
05:34:46.558 --> 05:34:47.430 align:start position:0%
maybe someone from doe could comment on
that

05:34:47.430 --> 05:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:34:49.190 --> 05:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
the reason for this is this is a
 
05:34:50.628 --> 05:34:50.638 align:start position:0%
leftover thing from when we had
 
05:34:52.470 --> 05:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
regulated telephone services one of the
 
05:34:55.190 --> 05:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
last things left it obviously cost money
 
05:34:57.910 --> 05:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
for the the um incumbent utility which
 
05:34:57.920 --> 05:34:59.110 align:start position:0%
for the the um incumbent utility which
is

05:34:59.110 --> 05:34:59.120 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:35:00.788 --> 05:35:00.798 align:start position:0%
most places is consolidated but there
 
05:35:02.470 --> 05:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
are others in the state
 
05:35:05.110 --> 05:35:05.120 align:start position:0%
and they have to provide this where
 
05:35:08.230 --> 05:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
simply it no longer exists this uh need
 
05:35:10.470 --> 05:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
to do this this is going back 20 30
 
05:35:13.030 --> 05:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
years ago where people didn't have cell
 
05:35:15.110 --> 05:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
phone service they didn't have cable
 
05:35:17.830 --> 05:35:17.840 align:start position:0%
options your voip voice over ip
 
05:35:19.990 --> 05:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh there's so many different competitors
 
05:35:21.510 --> 05:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
on there i mean every time you turn on
 
05:35:24.548 --> 05:35:24.558 align:start position:0%
tv there's a uh a different uh
 
05:35:26.628 --> 05:35:26.638 align:start position:0%
cell phone company coming up uh telling
 
05:35:27.830 --> 05:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
you they're gonna sell the service
 
05:35:29.510 --> 05:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
you've got broadband you've got all
 
05:35:31.350 --> 05:35:31.360 align:start position:0%
these other things and this just simply
 
05:35:33.510 --> 05:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
says if they find that it's not there
 
05:35:34.708 --> 05:35:34.718 align:start position:0%
and they give the conditions there i'm
 
05:35:35.910 --> 05:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
not going to read all the details
 
05:35:37.750 --> 05:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
everyone can read the bill themselves
 
05:35:40.150 --> 05:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
that then they can make a decision that
 
05:35:42.150 --> 05:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
they no longer have to be this provider
 
05:35:44.548 --> 05:35:44.558 align:start position:0%
of last resort and
 
05:35:46.548 --> 05:35:46.558 align:start position:0%
because the decision would be that they
 
05:35:48.470 --> 05:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
there's certainly ample things out there
 
05:35:48.480 --> 05:35:49.190 align:start position:0%
there's certainly ample things out there
and

05:35:49.190 --> 05:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:35:51.430 --> 05:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
people might say well what's the benefit
 
05:35:52.628 --> 05:35:52.638 align:start position:0%
of this well
 
05:35:54.948 --> 05:35:54.958 align:start position:0%
the benefit of this is that
 
05:35:57.590 --> 05:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
every time we put a burden on the
 
05:35:59.830 --> 05:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
incumbent utility that accomplishes
 
05:36:01.830 --> 05:36:01.840 align:start position:0%
virtually nothing as far as giving
 
05:36:03.190 --> 05:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
better service
 
05:36:05.350 --> 05:36:05.360 align:start position:0%
it there's a cost involved in that and
 
05:36:07.110 --> 05:36:07.120 align:start position:0%
if the cost involved that means it's
 
05:36:08.548 --> 05:36:08.558 align:start position:0%
like they're less competitive and less
 
05:36:10.070 --> 05:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
competitive means everyone's going to
 
05:36:11.510 --> 05:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
pay a little bit more money in the long
 
05:36:13.430 --> 05:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
run we want to have a vibrant uh
 
05:36:14.948 --> 05:36:14.958 align:start position:0%
competitive uh
 
05:36:17.910 --> 05:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
um system here with the understanding
 
05:36:19.910 --> 05:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
that the incumbent utilities uh you know
 
05:36:21.830 --> 05:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
for the most part only central offices
 
05:36:23.830 --> 05:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
and even though you think all your cell
 
05:36:26.230 --> 05:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
phones uh conversations don't go through
 
05:36:28.470 --> 05:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
there they do so we want to make sure
 
05:36:31.590 --> 05:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
that they stay around and are healthy
 
05:36:31.600 --> 05:36:32.470 align:start position:0%
that they stay around and are healthy
and

05:36:32.470 --> 05:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:36:33.910 --> 05:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
it's pretty much as simple as that is
 
05:36:35.670 --> 05:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
the if you want i'm going to have a
 
05:36:36.868 --> 05:36:36.878 align:start position:0%
couple of people from the telephone
 
05:36:38.548 --> 05:36:38.558 align:start position:0%
companies uh speak on if you have more
 
05:36:40.948 --> 05:36:40.958 align:start position:0%
specifics uh but that's all it does is
 
05:36:43.350 --> 05:36:43.360 align:start position:0%
this is something that's was needed 25
 
05:36:45.190 --> 05:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
or 30 years ago it simply isn't needed
 
05:36:47.190 --> 05:36:47.200 align:start position:0%
anymore due to competition and
 
05:36:50.070 --> 05:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
widespread use of other forms of
 
05:36:50.080 --> 05:36:51.510 align:start position:0%
widespread use of other forms of
um

05:36:51.510 --> 05:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:53.670 --> 05:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
telephone service uh it kind of almost
 
05:36:55.430 --> 05:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
dates back to the old
 
05:36:58.628 --> 05:36:58.638 align:start position:0%
pre-verizon uh bell days so with that
 
05:37:01.510 --> 05:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
i'll take any questions
 
05:37:04.628 --> 05:37:04.638 align:start position:0%
thank you representative harrington for
 
05:37:07.270 --> 05:37:07.280 align:start position:0%

mentioned in your testimony that the
 
05:37:21.430 --> 05:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
benefit from this bill would be to
 
05:37:23.990 --> 05:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
relieve incumbent utilities
 
05:37:27.190 --> 05:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
of certain burdensome costs you have any
 
05:37:27.200 --> 05:37:28.470 align:start position:0%
of certain burdensome costs you have any
idea

05:37:28.470 --> 05:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
idea
 
05:37:30.070 --> 05:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
how much money we're talking about i
 
05:37:31.990 --> 05:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
would prefer that the actual companies
 
05:37:33.430 --> 05:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
speak on that because i don't have i
 
05:37:36.230 --> 05:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
don't have exactly figure okay thank you

i just want to clarify first of all
 
05:37:51.910 --> 05:37:51.920 align:start position:0%

05:37:53.110 --> 05:37:53.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:37:55.670 --> 05:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
the requirement for being relieved of
 
05:37:57.270 --> 05:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
this burden
 
05:37:58.548 --> 05:37:58.558 align:start position:0%
is that
 
05:38:01.350 --> 05:38:01.360 align:start position:0%
there is at least one other
 
05:38:03.990 --> 05:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
wire based
 
05:38:06.830 --> 05:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
network available
 
05:38:10.150 --> 05:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
or or is it or and
 
05:38:13.190 --> 05:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
there is also a wireless
 
05:38:15.190 --> 05:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
service available
 
05:38:20.948 --> 05:38:20.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:23.190 --> 05:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
i'm suspecting that in many places there
 
05:38:27.270 --> 05:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
is just one wire uh i mean
 
05:38:30.548 --> 05:38:30.558 align:start position:0%
non-mobile phone network available and i
 
05:38:32.868 --> 05:38:32.878 align:start position:0%
guess those are the people who are
 
05:38:36.470 --> 05:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh kind of stranded in places where
 
05:38:38.948 --> 05:38:38.958 align:start position:0%
they put wires in there long time ago
 
05:38:40.548 --> 05:38:40.558 align:start position:0%
and they have them
 
05:38:42.948 --> 05:38:42.958 align:start position:0%
so are you suggesting that
 
05:38:45.990 --> 05:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
there are com competitors to uh
 
05:38:48.948 --> 05:38:48.958 align:start position:0%
uh non non-mobile carriers that are
 
05:38:51.030 --> 05:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
available to these people if if
 
05:38:52.230 --> 05:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
the current
 
05:38:54.868 --> 05:38:54.878 align:start position:0%
service provider stops serving no what
 
05:38:57.190 --> 05:38:57.200 align:start position:0%
i'm suggesting is that those criteria
 
05:38:59.590 --> 05:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
have to be met so if you had a situation
 
05:39:01.670 --> 05:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
where there wasn't at least one wire
 
05:39:05.750 --> 05:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
facilities based voice network and a
 
05:39:07.350 --> 05:39:07.360 align:start position:0%
one or more mobile
 
05:39:09.030 --> 05:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
commit let me split that out again
 
05:39:10.788 --> 05:39:10.798 align:start position:0%
telecommunications service providers
 
05:39:12.628 --> 05:39:12.638 align:start position:0%
that they couldn't they couldn't be
 
05:39:14.470 --> 05:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
relieved of their burden or whatever you
 
05:39:16.548 --> 05:39:16.558 align:start position:0%
want to call it their obligation to
 
05:39:18.470 --> 05:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
serve the wire customer that's why the
 
05:39:20.788 --> 05:39:20.798 align:start position:0%
criteria there it doesn't say you the
 
05:39:22.628 --> 05:39:22.638 align:start position:0%
incumbent utility does away with this
 
05:39:24.628 --> 05:39:24.638 align:start position:0%
class of customers altogether it just
 
05:39:26.868 --> 05:39:26.878 align:start position:0%
says in the overwhelming majority of the
 
05:39:30.230 --> 05:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
state it it's uh not it's does it's not
 
05:39:31.830 --> 05:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
needed but in those places where it is
 
05:39:33.670 --> 05:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
needed it would stay that's why this
 
05:39:35.750 --> 05:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
criteria has to be met before it can be
 
05:39:37.350 --> 05:39:37.360 align:start position:0%
relieved of that
 
05:39:39.350 --> 05:39:39.360 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up
 
05:39:41.350 --> 05:39:41.360 align:start position:0%
okay i understand that that makes sense
 
05:39:44.390 --> 05:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
and uh however you also say
 
05:39:47.030 --> 05:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
there has to be a wire line
 
05:39:49.270 --> 05:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
network person available that covers at
 
05:39:52.310 --> 05:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
least 95 percent of the households
 
05:39:53.590 --> 05:39:53.600 align:start position:0%
in other words
 
05:39:54.948 --> 05:39:54.958 align:start position:0%
there could be five percent of the
 
05:39:57.510 --> 05:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
households who are not covered by them
 
05:40:00.628 --> 05:40:00.638 align:start position:0%
or by three percent people who would not
 
05:40:03.030 --> 05:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
be covered by a mobile phone
 
05:40:05.110 --> 05:40:05.120 align:start position:0%
aren't those exactly the kind of people
 
05:40:07.350 --> 05:40:07.360 align:start position:0%
that were at the end of the line
 
05:40:08.868 --> 05:40:08.878 align:start position:0%
uh were
 
05:40:11.110 --> 05:40:11.120 align:start position:0%
if they're i mean i realize they're just
 
05:40:13.190 --> 05:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
a small percentage of of the town but
 
05:40:13.200 --> 05:40:14.390 align:start position:0%
a small percentage of of the town but
nonetheless

05:40:14.390 --> 05:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
nonetheless
 
05:40:15.830 --> 05:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh you know we're trying to make sure
 
05:40:18.310 --> 05:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
that everyone has equal access to phone
 
05:40:19.670 --> 05:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
yeah i i
 
05:40:21.750 --> 05:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
think this criteria and like i said this
 
05:40:23.910 --> 05:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
these exact numbers would derive from
 
05:40:26.150 --> 05:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
the utilities because they'd obviously
 
05:40:27.990 --> 05:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
done more analysis and know more about
 
05:40:30.868 --> 05:40:30.878 align:start position:0%
it than i do but i think this is a
 
05:40:32.390 --> 05:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
balancing thing we have to look at and
 
05:40:33.830 --> 05:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
say you just can't shut it off
 
05:40:36.310 --> 05:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
completely but when you read this this
 
05:40:38.150 --> 05:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
level then you're probably going to be
 
05:40:40.310 --> 05:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
okay i mean there's some i mean we've
 
05:40:40.320 --> 05:40:41.910 align:start position:0%
okay i mean there's some i mean we've
had

05:40:41.910 --> 05:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
had
 
05:40:43.510 --> 05:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
a series of
 
05:40:46.310 --> 05:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
bizarre telephone rules in new hampshire
 
05:40:47.990 --> 05:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
over the years
 
05:40:50.230 --> 05:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
maybe well jackie's probably around to
 
05:40:53.350 --> 05:40:53.360 align:start position:0%
remember some of these but
 
05:40:55.510 --> 05:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
but she remembers the only person
 
05:40:57.190 --> 05:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
she remembers when god was a little boy
 
05:40:57.200 --> 05:40:59.270 align:start position:0%
she remembers when god was a little boy
so

05:40:59.270 --> 05:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:41:01.110 --> 05:41:01.120 align:start position:0%
that's right and anyways there was
 
05:41:02.390 --> 05:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
actually one there was actually a rule
 
05:41:03.750 --> 05:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
that came up because i testified when i
 
05:41:05.350 --> 05:41:05.360 align:start position:0%
was a commissioner on it and it said
 
05:41:07.990 --> 05:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
that if somebody called up the puc to
 
05:41:10.150 --> 05:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
complain about their telephone service
 
05:41:13.430 --> 05:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
and they had caller id the puc was not
 
05:41:15.910 --> 05:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
allowed to help them with that at all if
 
05:41:17.430 --> 05:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
they called back the next day and said
 
05:41:20.070 --> 05:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
i've gotten rid of uh caller id the puc
 
05:41:22.230 --> 05:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
amanda would say up what do you want i
 
05:41:23.910 --> 05:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
can help you so there's always there's
 
05:41:25.190 --> 05:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
always little quirks that we've been
 
05:41:26.150 --> 05:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
trying to work out with that
 
05:41:28.548 --> 05:41:28.558 align:start position:0%
deregulation because it wasn't quite the
 
05:41:30.150 --> 05:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
same as with electricity where it was
 
05:41:31.750 --> 05:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
just saying you know get rid of your
 
05:41:33.670 --> 05:41:33.680 align:start position:0%
power plants because it was more of a
 
05:41:35.350 --> 05:41:35.360 align:start position:0%
transition i just think this is another
 
05:41:37.190 --> 05:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
one of the steps in the transition okay
 
05:41:39.190 --> 05:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative plett is
 
05:41:41.590 --> 05:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question yes thank you
 
05:41:43.590 --> 05:41:43.600 align:start position:0%
i was confused at first because it says
 
05:41:45.270 --> 05:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
a utility doesn't see a telephone
 
05:41:45.280 --> 05:41:46.548 align:start position:0%
a utility doesn't see a telephone
utility

05:41:46.548 --> 05:41:46.558 align:start position:0%
utility
 
05:41:47.990 --> 05:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
and so uh
 
05:41:50.070 --> 05:41:50.080 align:start position:0%
and i read the body and i saw that it
 
05:41:52.548 --> 05:41:52.558 align:start position:0%
was indeed telephone utilities but it
 
05:41:54.868 --> 05:41:54.878 align:start position:0%
crossed my mind that electric utilities
 
05:41:56.948 --> 05:41:56.958 align:start position:0%
still have provider of last resort even
 
05:41:58.868 --> 05:41:58.878 align:start position:0%
though they don't own anything anymore
 
05:42:01.830 --> 05:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
so could this be broadened to cover the
 
05:42:03.110 --> 05:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
remove the
 
05:42:04.868 --> 05:42:04.878 align:start position:0%
provider of last report for electric
 
05:42:07.430 --> 05:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
utilities or gas utilities
 
05:42:09.030 --> 05:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
you're not the only one who raised that
 
05:42:12.230 --> 05:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
concern with me uh so uh in fact i got
 
05:42:13.510 --> 05:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
some very excited people from the
 
05:42:15.430 --> 05:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
electric utilities calling
 
05:42:15.440 --> 05:42:16.150 align:start position:0%
electric utilities calling
that

05:42:16.150 --> 05:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:42:17.750 --> 05:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
i have no problem with adding the
 
05:42:19.670 --> 05:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
incumbent telephone utility if it
 
05:42:21.190 --> 05:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
clarifies it to make so there's no
 
05:42:22.788 --> 05:42:22.798 align:start position:0%
confusion because it's not supposed to
 
05:42:25.350 --> 05:42:25.360 align:start position:0%
apply to uh electric utilities it's just
 
05:42:25.360 --> 05:42:29.590 align:start position:0%
apply to uh electric utilities it's just
telephone

05:42:29.590 --> 05:42:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:31.830 --> 05:42:31.840 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative pimentel is
 
05:42:33.670 --> 05:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
 
05:42:35.750 --> 05:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
05:42:37.670 --> 05:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative harrington
 
05:42:37.680 --> 05:42:38.788 align:start position:0%
thank you representative harrington
um

05:42:38.788 --> 05:42:38.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:42:41.590 --> 05:42:41.600 align:start position:0%
i'm curious about
 
05:42:43.830 --> 05:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
what happens it looks like
 
05:42:46.310 --> 05:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
the incumbent utility would petition the
 
05:42:49.990 --> 05:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
department of energy and
 
05:42:50.000 --> 05:42:51.350 align:start position:0%
department of energy and
if

05:42:51.350 --> 05:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:42:53.510 --> 05:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
what would the department of energy do
 
05:42:53.520 --> 05:42:54.628 align:start position:0%
what would the department of energy do
say

05:42:54.628 --> 05:42:54.638 align:start position:0%
say
 
05:42:56.470 --> 05:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
yes or no
 
05:42:59.510 --> 05:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
and then if if they say yes
 
05:43:03.350 --> 05:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
you you're no longer the resort the last
 
05:43:03.360 --> 05:43:04.548 align:start position:0%
you you're no longer the resort the last
resort

05:43:04.548 --> 05:43:04.558 align:start position:0%
resort
 
05:43:04.558 --> 05:43:06.070 align:start position:0%
resort
carrier

05:43:06.070 --> 05:43:06.080 align:start position:0%
carrier
 
05:43:08.150 --> 05:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
would that mean the other utility that
 
05:43:09.910 --> 05:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
is hooked up
 
05:43:13.110 --> 05:43:13.120 align:start position:0%
then with 95 percent would become the
 
05:43:17.030 --> 05:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
last resort or there be no last resort
 
05:43:19.110 --> 05:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
utility my understanding would be no
 
05:43:20.948 --> 05:43:20.958 align:start position:0%
last resort because of certain other
 
05:43:22.708 --> 05:43:22.718 align:start position:0%
words the idea that the service was
 
05:43:24.948 --> 05:43:24.958 align:start position:0%
sufficient enough so that you would let
 
05:43:27.750 --> 05:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
competition decide what service they got
 
05:43:30.230 --> 05:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
whether it be i mean you can get
 
05:43:31.830 --> 05:43:31.840 align:start position:0%
typically you could get satellite you
 
05:43:33.510 --> 05:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
can get voip
 
05:43:34.868 --> 05:43:34.878 align:start position:0%
you can get
 
05:43:37.030 --> 05:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
wireless you can get landline all those
 
05:43:40.628 --> 05:43:40.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:41.910 --> 05:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
05:43:43.510 --> 05:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
05:43:46.150 --> 05:43:46.160 align:start position:0%
uh so just for clarity you're saying
 
05:43:47.670 --> 05:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
that because there are
 
05:43:48.948 --> 05:43:48.958 align:start position:0%
at least two
 
05:43:51.110 --> 05:43:51.120 align:start position:0%
land lines and
 
05:43:54.788 --> 05:43:54.798 align:start position:0%
cell service then there is no need for
 
05:43:54.798 --> 05:43:56.948 align:start position:0%
cell service then there is no need for
um

05:43:56.948 --> 05:43:56.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:43:58.868 --> 05:43:58.878 align:start position:0%
a utility of last
 
05:44:01.190 --> 05:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
resort correct if the criteria listed
 
05:44:02.948 --> 05:44:02.958 align:start position:0%
here were met
 
05:44:04.390 --> 05:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
then there would there would be no
 
05:44:06.708 --> 05:44:06.718 align:start position:0%
utility thank you
 
05:44:09.190 --> 05:44:09.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh
 
05:44:10.948 --> 05:44:10.958 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts you have a
 
05:44:10.958 --> 05:44:14.390 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts you have a
question

05:44:14.390 --> 05:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:17.350 --> 05:44:17.360 align:start position:0%
microphone on please
 
05:44:19.910 --> 05:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
besides being a
 
05:44:21.510 --> 05:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
old fossil
 
05:44:23.590 --> 05:44:23.600 align:start position:0%
and having a landline i worked for the
 
05:44:25.270 --> 05:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
companies i know that
 
05:44:27.510 --> 05:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
i would like to know
 
05:44:30.708 --> 05:44:30.718 align:start position:0%
it's having a landline what would happen
 
05:44:32.310 --> 05:44:32.320 align:start position:0%
should the current
 
05:44:34.548 --> 05:44:34.558 align:start position:0%
telephone company decide
 
05:44:36.470 --> 05:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not providing landline service
 
05:44:36.480 --> 05:44:37.670 align:start position:0%
i'm not providing landline service
anymore

05:44:37.670 --> 05:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
05:44:39.430 --> 05:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
can they just shut it off like that
 
05:44:39.440 --> 05:44:40.708 align:start position:0%
can they just shut it off like that
without

05:44:40.708 --> 05:44:40.718 align:start position:0%
without
 
05:44:43.590 --> 05:44:43.600 align:start position:0%
notice and having somebody to cover
 
05:44:46.868 --> 05:44:46.878 align:start position:0%
that landline service
 
05:44:49.030 --> 05:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
quite honest i don't know what the law
 
05:44:51.030 --> 05:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
is on that i would assume that there's
 
05:44:53.430 --> 05:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
some process involved in before they can
 
05:44:54.948 --> 05:44:54.958 align:start position:0%
disconnect but i would refer to one of
 
05:44:56.310 --> 05:44:56.320 align:start position:0%
the representatives from the utilities
 
05:44:57.670 --> 05:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
because i'm sure they know that better
 
05:44:59.990 --> 05:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
than i do
 
05:45:01.670 --> 05:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
follow-up i would save it for the
 
05:45:03.110 --> 05:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
utilities so i would hope they would
 
05:45:04.628 --> 05:45:04.638 align:start position:0%
address it so i don't have to ask the
 
05:45:07.110 --> 05:45:07.120 align:start position:0%
question what would happen
 
05:45:09.270 --> 05:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
you used to have to
 
05:45:11.670 --> 05:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
leave 9-1-1 available
 
05:45:13.510 --> 05:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
so you could come in and plug in a phone
 
05:45:17.350 --> 05:45:17.360 align:start position:0%
and call 9-1-1 no problem
 
05:45:19.350 --> 05:45:19.360 align:start position:0%
what would happen to
 
05:45:21.110 --> 05:45:21.120 align:start position:0%
customers who have
 
05:45:23.590 --> 05:45:23.600 align:start position:0%
any service now
 
05:45:26.708 --> 05:45:26.718 align:start position:0%
not being able if a company should cease
 
05:45:27.990 --> 05:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
to exist
 
05:45:30.470 --> 05:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
have nine one one service
 
05:45:32.230 --> 05:45:32.240 align:start position:0%
and i would hope
 
05:45:34.470 --> 05:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
i i i don't know if you know that answer
 
05:45:35.990 --> 05:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
but i would hope that the companies
 
05:45:37.830 --> 05:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
would address that i'll defer to them on
 
05:45:39.910 --> 05:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
that one thank you
 
05:45:41.910 --> 05:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
representative partial is recognized for
 
05:45:43.750 --> 05:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
a question
 
05:45:45.190 --> 05:45:45.200 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you representative
 
05:45:45.200 --> 05:45:47.030 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you representative
farrington

05:45:47.030 --> 05:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
farrington
 
05:45:50.070 --> 05:45:50.080 align:start position:0%
if i'm reading this it says at least one
 
05:45:52.548 --> 05:45:52.558 align:start position:0%
wireless facilities based uh voice
 
05:45:52.558 --> 05:45:53.590 align:start position:0%
wireless facilities based uh voice
network

05:45:53.590 --> 05:45:53.600 align:start position:0%
network
 
05:45:56.990 --> 05:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
and and one or more mobile telecom
 
05:45:58.948 --> 05:45:58.958 align:start position:0%
communications service
 
05:45:58.958 --> 05:45:59.830 align:start position:0%
communications service
uh

05:45:59.830 --> 05:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:46:02.788 --> 05:46:02.798 align:start position:0%
at 95 and 97 percent of coverage in the
 
05:46:04.868 --> 05:46:04.878 align:start position:0%
municipality respectfully
 
05:46:07.750 --> 05:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
that seems like a fairly
 
05:46:10.390 --> 05:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
high bar to be able to even consider
 
05:46:12.788 --> 05:46:12.798 align:start position:0%
applying to ask to be relieved of the
 
05:46:14.390 --> 05:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
carrier of last resort
 
05:46:16.548 --> 05:46:16.558 align:start position:0%
again not trying to not answer your
 
05:46:18.628 --> 05:46:18.638 align:start position:0%
question but the the actual numbers came
 
05:46:20.230 --> 05:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
from the utility so i'm assuming they
 
05:46:22.310 --> 05:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
put research into getting those so you
 
05:46:23.830 --> 05:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
could hold that question until they
 
05:46:24.948 --> 05:46:24.958 align:start position:0%
speak they would give you a better
 
05:46:26.470 --> 05:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
answer than i can i sure will thank you
 
05:46:28.470 --> 05:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
so much
 
05:46:31.430 --> 05:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
representative samsich
 
05:46:33.190 --> 05:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you mr
 
05:46:36.390 --> 05:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
harrington uh just because of the
 
05:46:38.548 --> 05:46:38.558 align:start position:0%
comments we just i just heard
 
05:46:40.708 --> 05:46:40.718 align:start position:0%
uh it seems to me
 
05:46:42.788 --> 05:46:42.798 align:start position:0%
that even if these requirements are
 
05:46:45.190 --> 05:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
there that there is another
 
05:46:47.350 --> 05:46:47.360 align:start position:0%
uh wire-based company
 
05:46:49.030 --> 05:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
like represent kelly pitts was saying
 
05:46:51.590 --> 05:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
let's say let's say a landline
 
05:46:53.590 --> 05:46:53.600 align:start position:0%
there is another company would provide
 
05:46:53.600 --> 05:46:54.708 align:start position:0%
there is another company would provide
landline

05:46:54.708 --> 05:46:54.718 align:start position:0%
landline
 
05:46:56.868 --> 05:46:56.878 align:start position:0%
and another mobile company
 
05:46:58.548 --> 05:46:58.558 align:start position:0%
they're not obligated to take her as a
 
05:46:58.558 --> 05:47:00.150 align:start position:0%
they're not obligated to take her as a
customer

05:47:00.150 --> 05:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
customer
 
05:47:02.150 --> 05:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
so if the company is relieved of its
 
05:47:04.628 --> 05:47:04.638 align:start position:0%
duty to provide her that landline
 
05:47:06.150 --> 05:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
05:47:08.070 --> 05:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
and can i follow up
 
05:47:10.868 --> 05:47:10.878 align:start position:0%
and and what what uh what is the what do
 
05:47:13.110 --> 05:47:13.120 align:start position:0%
you understand what is the level of
 
05:47:15.110 --> 05:47:15.120 align:start position:0%
proof that a company would have to
 
05:47:18.470 --> 05:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
provide to the department of energy uh
 
05:47:20.390 --> 05:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
before they can do this what what what
 
05:47:22.628 --> 05:47:22.638 align:start position:0%
is the proof of this i understand uh we
 
05:47:24.628 --> 05:47:24.638 align:start position:0%
have this criterion with alternatives
 
05:47:25.990 --> 05:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
here but
 
05:47:27.750 --> 05:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
what does that look like as far as if
 
05:47:30.470 --> 05:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
they go and say this is why we want this
 
05:47:33.510 --> 05:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
and here we can prove that is there some
 
05:47:35.270 --> 05:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
vehicle of proof i'm assuming they'll
 
05:47:37.030 --> 05:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
have to use some type of maps or
 
05:47:38.868 --> 05:47:38.878 align:start position:0%
something that shows cell coverage area
 
05:47:40.548 --> 05:47:40.558 align:start position:0%
as well as where the wire-based
 
05:47:43.030 --> 05:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
facilities go but again the utility
 
05:47:43.910 --> 05:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
should be able to give you more
 
05:47:45.590 --> 05:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
information on that but obviously it's
 
05:47:47.110 --> 05:47:47.120 align:start position:0%
not just calling up and saying yeah we
 
05:47:49.030 --> 05:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
met the criteria thanks they're going to
 
05:47:51.030 --> 05:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
have to give some facts to back it up
 
05:47:54.868 --> 05:47:54.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:56.470 --> 05:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
does anyone else
 
05:47:58.548 --> 05:47:58.558 align:start position:0%
have a question for
 
05:48:00.628 --> 05:48:00.638 align:start position:0%
uh representative harrington
 
05:48:02.948 --> 05:48:02.958 align:start position:0%
before i go back to representative kelly
 
05:48:05.270 --> 05:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
pitts i guess representative mcgee has a
 
05:48:07.510 --> 05:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you mr chairman and
 
05:48:08.868 --> 05:48:08.878 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
05:48:10.628 --> 05:48:10.638 align:start position:0%
representative harrington
 
05:48:12.150 --> 05:48:12.160 align:start position:0%
i'm just looking in the methodology
 
05:48:13.990 --> 05:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
under the fiscal note and it mentions
 
05:48:15.590 --> 05:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
that the department's unaware of
 
05:48:17.510 --> 05:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
arrangements made by the state county or
 
05:48:19.430 --> 05:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
local governments for telephone service
 
05:48:21.350 --> 05:48:21.360 align:start position:0%
the cost of that service or the cost of
 
05:48:22.948 --> 05:48:22.958 align:start position:0%
changing that service
 
05:48:24.788 --> 05:48:24.798 align:start position:0%
should a telephone utility cease to
 
05:48:28.070 --> 05:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
provide service or fail to extend
 
05:48:30.230 --> 05:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
service to a customer
 
05:48:32.948 --> 05:48:32.958 align:start position:0%
um and i guess my question is
 
05:48:34.390 --> 05:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
what was the
 
05:48:35.830 --> 05:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that this is kind of an
 
05:48:35.840 --> 05:48:37.510 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that this is kind of an
antiquated

05:48:37.510 --> 05:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
antiquated
 
05:48:41.910 --> 05:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:43.350 --> 05:48:43.360 align:start position:0%
relief from
 
05:48:47.430 --> 05:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
being the carrier of last resort service
 
05:48:47.440 --> 05:48:49.270 align:start position:0%
being the carrier of last resort service
so

05:48:49.270 --> 05:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:48:50.868 --> 05:48:50.878 align:start position:0%
so the
 
05:48:53.750 --> 05:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that oftentimes
 
05:48:55.430 --> 05:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
what we're doing by having something
 
05:48:58.150 --> 05:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
that's uniform like a carrier of last
 
05:49:01.910 --> 05:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
resort status is to say that you're
 
05:49:04.070 --> 05:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
guaranteeing that people will be able to
 
05:49:06.310 --> 05:49:06.320 align:start position:0%
get service through them even though it
 
05:49:08.390 --> 05:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
may be expensive to bring the service to
 
05:49:08.400 --> 05:49:09.510 align:start position:0%
may be expensive to bring the service to
them

05:49:09.510 --> 05:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:49:11.990 --> 05:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
is that part of the factor in this in
 
05:49:13.190 --> 05:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
wanting to
 
05:49:15.110 --> 05:49:15.120 align:start position:0%
take it away
 
05:49:17.030 --> 05:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
yeah well you've got to go back in time
 
05:49:19.910 --> 05:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
a little bit the whole concept of this
 
05:49:21.670 --> 05:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
customer like this was set back when we
 
05:49:24.230 --> 05:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
had franchised areas back under you know
 
05:49:26.548 --> 05:49:26.558 align:start position:0%
new england bell
 
05:49:28.310 --> 05:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
excuse me and
 
05:49:29.990 --> 05:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
the obligation there was that the
 
05:49:31.990 --> 05:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
telephone company had to provide service
 
05:49:34.470 --> 05:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
out to somebody and let's say there was
 
05:49:36.708 --> 05:49:36.718 align:start position:0%
you lived at the you know three quarters
 
05:49:38.548 --> 05:49:38.558 align:start position:0%
of a mile down a dirt road you were the
 
05:49:39.910 --> 05:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
only house out there well they would
 
05:49:42.230 --> 05:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
have to run the thing out and that cost
 
05:49:43.990 --> 05:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
would just be put into the rates that
 
05:49:45.750 --> 05:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
everybody paid it wouldn't be a
 
05:49:48.230 --> 05:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
significant uh increase to the to the
 
05:49:49.750 --> 05:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
singular person there that was the whole
 
05:49:51.990 --> 05:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
idea of the way the the pre-regulation
 
05:49:52.000 --> 05:49:52.830 align:start position:0%
idea of the way the the pre-regulation
of

05:49:52.830 --> 05:49:52.840 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:49:55.670 --> 05:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
pre-deregulation worked for telephone so
 
05:49:57.590 --> 05:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
this was by saying that now we don't
 
05:49:59.030 --> 05:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
need those anymore because we've got so
 
05:50:01.110 --> 05:50:01.120 align:start position:0%
much competition and especially with
 
05:50:03.030 --> 05:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
wireless and satellite and everything
 
05:50:04.470 --> 05:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
else has come in there you know things
 
05:50:04.480 --> 05:50:05.910 align:start position:0%
else has come in there you know things
that

05:50:05.910 --> 05:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:50:07.270 --> 05:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
05:50:09.350 --> 05:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
couldn't be even envisioned 20 or 30
 
05:50:11.270 --> 05:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
years ago when it was thought that the
 
05:50:12.548 --> 05:50:12.558 align:start position:0%
only way you could have telephone
 
05:50:14.708 --> 05:50:14.718 align:start position:0%
service was you know one company running
 
05:50:16.070 --> 05:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
wires because that was the only one that
 
05:50:17.830 --> 05:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
made sense so this is kind of what the
 
05:50:20.470 --> 05:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
change is on that so just a follow-up
 
05:50:22.628 --> 05:50:22.638 align:start position:0%
same line of questioning
 
05:50:24.230 --> 05:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
and the only other thought that i had
 
05:50:27.110 --> 05:50:27.120 align:start position:0%
was are there areas in new hampshire
 
05:50:27.120 --> 05:50:28.150 align:start position:0%
was are there areas in new hampshire
where

05:50:28.150 --> 05:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
where
 
05:50:28.160 --> 05:50:30.868 align:start position:0%
where
um

05:50:30.868 --> 05:50:30.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:50:32.868 --> 05:50:32.878 align:start position:0%
where those levels of competition don't
 
05:50:35.590 --> 05:50:35.600 align:start position:0%
actually affect people's ability to get
 
05:50:37.830 --> 05:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
phone service i know we have all those
 
05:50:39.670 --> 05:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
available to us but are there areas that
 
05:50:42.868 --> 05:50:42.878 align:start position:0%
are dead zones for that that
 
05:50:44.390 --> 05:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
i would assume they're uh
 
05:50:46.150 --> 05:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
excuse me i would assume there are some
 
05:50:48.470 --> 05:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
and that's that's why the criteria has
 
05:50:51.110 --> 05:50:51.120 align:start position:0%
been placed in here and they would have
 
05:50:53.350 --> 05:50:53.360 align:start position:0%
to show that if they wanted to get
 
05:50:56.070 --> 05:50:56.080 align:start position:0%
relieved of the being the supplier of
 
05:50:57.750 --> 05:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
last resort in that particular area
 
05:50:59.110 --> 05:50:59.120 align:start position:0%
they'd have to show that these criteria
 
05:51:01.270 --> 05:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
were met before they could do that but
 
05:51:03.430 --> 05:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
again the the people from the utilities
 
05:51:04.708 --> 05:51:04.718 align:start position:0%
could probably give you a little bit
 
05:51:06.868 --> 05:51:06.878 align:start position:0%
better okay thank you
 
05:51:09.030 --> 05:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
representative harrington uh i have a
 
05:51:10.548 --> 05:51:10.558 align:start position:0%
quick question
 
05:51:12.628 --> 05:51:12.638 align:start position:0%
the effective date of this legislation
 
05:51:15.430 --> 05:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
is 60 days after its passage but it
 
05:51:17.910 --> 05:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
apparently incurs some costs according
 
05:51:19.590 --> 05:51:19.600 align:start position:0%
to the fiscal note
 
05:51:22.310 --> 05:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
the department estimates the cost of
 
05:51:24.390 --> 05:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
employing consultants will range from
 
05:51:26.070 --> 05:51:26.080 align:start position:0%
between 50 to one hundred thousand
 
05:51:26.080 --> 05:51:27.670 align:start position:0%
between 50 to one hundred thousand
dollars

05:51:27.670 --> 05:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
05:51:29.430 --> 05:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
does that mean that the effective date
 
05:51:30.708 --> 05:51:30.718 align:start position:0%
should be
 
05:51:34.070 --> 05:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh july 1st of 2023 after the
 
05:51:36.868 --> 05:51:36.878 align:start position:0%
next budget is prepared i'm not sure the
 
05:51:38.390 --> 05:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
cost issue here there's been a lot of
 
05:51:40.948 --> 05:51:40.958 align:start position:0%
controversy on that as far as exactly
 
05:51:43.590 --> 05:51:43.600 align:start position:0%
who's going to have to do what
 
05:51:45.990 --> 05:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
and if the
 
05:51:47.430 --> 05:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
i think if the utilities and i'm going
 
05:51:48.708 --> 05:51:48.718 align:start position:0%
to let them speak to this because they
 
05:51:49.990 --> 05:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
know better of what they're going to do
 
05:51:51.750 --> 05:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
but my what i would envision is they're
 
05:51:53.430 --> 05:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
going to do the work and they're going
 
05:51:55.110 --> 05:51:55.120 align:start position:0%
to come up with the the maps that are
 
05:51:57.030 --> 05:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
public records that can show where cell
 
05:51:59.190 --> 05:51:59.200 align:start position:0%
coverage is and where cable companies go
 
05:52:01.430 --> 05:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
and where landline goes and everything
 
05:52:03.030 --> 05:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
else and they're going to present a case
 
05:52:05.270 --> 05:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
and bring that to the doe
 
05:52:07.990 --> 05:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
assuming it's doe and not puc i don't
 
05:52:09.750 --> 05:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
think they're going to i don't see that
 
05:52:11.750 --> 05:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
they would have to go outside and hire a
 
05:52:13.990 --> 05:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
special consultant this is this is not
 
05:52:15.670 --> 05:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
going to be rocket science it's going to
 
05:52:15.680 --> 05:52:16.390 align:start position:0%
going to be rocket science it's going to
be

05:52:16.390 --> 05:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:52:17.750 --> 05:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
05:52:19.830 --> 05:52:19.840 align:start position:0%
you know houses on maps and seeing what
 
05:52:21.510 --> 05:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
kind of coverage they have so i think
 
05:52:23.910 --> 05:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
that might be a little bit high but
 
05:52:25.350 --> 05:52:25.360 align:start position:0%
we do have i think
 
05:52:27.350 --> 05:52:27.360 align:start position:0%
the the doe still here maybe they could
 
05:52:29.750 --> 05:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
comment on that specifically okay thank
 
05:52:29.760 --> 05:52:32.470 align:start position:0%
comment on that specifically okay thank
you

05:52:32.470 --> 05:52:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:33.910 --> 05:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts you have
 
05:52:36.390 --> 05:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
another question
 
05:52:38.390 --> 05:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
question for
 
05:52:40.150 --> 05:52:40.160 align:start position:0%
representative harrington
 
05:52:42.310 --> 05:52:42.320 align:start position:0%
with your expertise representative
 
05:52:45.830 --> 05:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
harrington and what this committee did
 
05:52:49.030 --> 05:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
a few years ago where we ceded authority
 
05:52:50.628 --> 05:52:50.638 align:start position:0%
over the telephone companies we kind of
 
05:52:52.310 --> 05:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
cut them loose
 
05:52:54.070 --> 05:52:54.080 align:start position:0%
do you believe
 
05:52:58.628 --> 05:52:58.638 align:start position:0%
that this type of legislation is real
 
05:53:01.190 --> 05:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
and i mean that it has to be enacted or
 
05:53:03.110 --> 05:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
that right now it would have no effect
 
05:53:05.590 --> 05:53:05.600 align:start position:0%
because my understanding was that we
 
05:53:06.948 --> 05:53:06.958 align:start position:0%
were out of the telephone business as
 
05:53:10.230 --> 05:53:10.240 align:start position:0%
far as the puc was concerned and
 
05:53:12.470 --> 05:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
i don't know where the doe
 
05:53:14.788 --> 05:53:14.798 align:start position:0%
would pick it up because it's gone they
 
05:53:17.030 --> 05:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
didn't move it over because it's gone
 
05:53:18.470 --> 05:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
so i
 
05:53:20.788 --> 05:53:20.798 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if this is just a
 
05:53:24.310 --> 05:53:24.320 align:start position:0%
housekeeping measure not a real one no i
 
05:53:25.190 --> 05:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
think it's a little bit more the
 
05:53:26.628 --> 05:53:26.638 align:start position:0%
housekeeping measure because there's
 
05:53:28.310 --> 05:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
cost involved in it for the incumbent
 
05:53:30.150 --> 05:53:30.160 align:start position:0%
utility so it would be something that
 
05:53:32.150 --> 05:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
could be resolved so that they would say
 
05:53:33.430 --> 05:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
as far as the
 
05:53:33.440 --> 05:53:34.230 align:start position:0%
as far as the
um

05:53:34.230 --> 05:53:34.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:53:37.190 --> 05:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
the utility the telephone expertise yes
 
05:53:38.708 --> 05:53:38.718 align:start position:0%
i think uh
 
05:53:41.430 --> 05:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
that kind of went away in the puc and
 
05:53:43.350 --> 05:53:43.360 align:start position:0%
that's why i say it's i'm gonna have to
 
05:53:46.150 --> 05:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
talk to both puc and the doe on this as
 
05:53:48.390 --> 05:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
to where it would be more appropriate to
 
05:53:50.548 --> 05:53:50.558 align:start position:0%
file it it was the doe seemed to be
 
05:53:52.390 --> 05:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
because it was more administrative but
 
05:53:53.750 --> 05:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
then again the department of energy
 
05:53:55.270 --> 05:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't say anything about telephones in
 
05:53:57.670 --> 05:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
their description either but uh i don't
 
05:53:59.750 --> 05:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
think the puc has anything left on that
 
05:54:01.270 --> 05:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
either so just that's that's something
 
05:54:02.548 --> 05:54:02.558 align:start position:0%
that needs to be worked out it's a valid
 
05:54:02.558 --> 05:54:05.030 align:start position:0%
that needs to be worked out it's a valid
point

05:54:05.030 --> 05:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:06.628 --> 05:54:06.638 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up quick follow-up as i
 
05:54:09.030 --> 05:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
thought we ceded all authority
 
05:54:11.590 --> 05:54:11.600 align:start position:0%
there's still a little left
 
05:54:13.590 --> 05:54:13.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you i i think we should move
 
05:54:15.510 --> 05:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
on because we have two representatives
 
05:54:18.708 --> 05:54:18.718 align:start position:0%
from uh telephone utilities here and
 
05:54:20.628 --> 05:54:20.638 align:start position:0%
we'll probably get a lot more clarity on
 
05:54:22.628 --> 05:54:22.638 align:start position:0%
some of these questions if we bring them
 
05:54:24.948 --> 05:54:24.958 align:start position:0%
to the stand but before we do that i'd
 
05:54:26.708 --> 05:54:26.718 align:start position:0%
like to bring the department of energy's
 
05:54:29.430 --> 05:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
griffin roberge to the stand to give us
 
05:54:32.230 --> 05:54:32.240 align:start position:0%
his take on this legislation
 
05:54:43.430 --> 05:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:45.350 --> 05:54:45.360 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman vos members of the
 
05:54:47.270 --> 05:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
committee for the record griffin roberge
 
05:54:48.708 --> 05:54:48.718 align:start position:0%
from the new hampshire department of
 
05:54:51.750 --> 05:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
energy i'm here to testify give neutral
 
05:54:55.830 --> 05:54:55.840 align:start position:0%
testimony on house bill 1328
 
05:54:57.190 --> 05:54:57.200 align:start position:0%
i know there were some questions
 
05:54:57.200 --> 05:54:58.948 align:start position:0%
i know there were some questions
regarding

05:54:58.948 --> 05:54:58.958 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
05:55:00.788 --> 05:55:00.798 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note so i'll start at the top
 
05:55:02.868 --> 05:55:02.878 align:start position:0%
work my way down
 
05:55:05.110 --> 05:55:05.120 align:start position:0%
the bill as representative harrington
 
05:55:07.590 --> 05:55:07.600 align:start position:0%
indicated permits an incumbent telephone
 
05:55:10.310 --> 05:55:10.320 align:start position:0%
utility to petition doe to relieve it of
 
05:55:13.670 --> 05:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
any carrier of last resort obligations
 
05:55:15.270 --> 05:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
in one or more municipalities if certain
 
05:55:18.070 --> 05:55:18.080 align:start position:0%
conditions are met um
 
05:55:19.430 --> 05:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
the first one being there is at least
 
05:55:21.430 --> 05:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
one other wireline voice provider that
 
05:55:23.350 --> 05:55:23.360 align:start position:0%
provides service to at least 95 percent
 
05:55:26.150 --> 05:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
of households in the municipality or
 
05:55:28.788 --> 05:55:28.798 align:start position:0%
and one or more mobile providers that
 
05:55:31.350 --> 05:55:31.360 align:start position:0%
offer aggregate services to at least 97
 
05:55:32.310 --> 05:55:32.320 align:start position:0%
percent of the households in the
 
05:55:32.320 --> 05:55:33.590 align:start position:0%
percent of the households in the
municipality

05:55:33.590 --> 05:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
05:55:35.830 --> 05:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
second one is there is another provider
 
05:55:38.230 --> 05:55:38.240 align:start position:0%
or providers that have received state
 
05:55:40.230 --> 05:55:40.240 align:start position:0%
federal or municipal funding to serve
 
05:55:42.310 --> 05:55:42.320 align:start position:0%
the entire municipality
 
05:55:43.670 --> 05:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
there was some question as to what
 
05:55:45.830 --> 05:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
criteria would be established per the
 
05:55:47.270 --> 05:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
bill lines
 
05:55:47.280 --> 05:55:48.868 align:start position:0%
bill lines
13-14

05:55:48.868 --> 05:55:48.878 align:start position:0%
13-14
 
05:55:50.310 --> 05:55:50.320 align:start position:0%
doe is
 
05:55:52.390 --> 05:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
allowed to adopt rules to enforce this
 
05:55:52.400 --> 05:55:54.470 align:start position:0%
allowed to adopt rules to enforce this
section

05:55:54.470 --> 05:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
section
 
05:55:56.470 --> 05:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
regarding the fiscal note
 
05:55:58.070 --> 05:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
doe is assuming that it would either
 
05:55:59.590 --> 05:55:59.600 align:start position:0%
have the option of
 
05:56:01.590 --> 05:56:01.600 align:start position:0%
adopting rules
 
05:56:03.670 --> 05:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
that depend on the utility to certify
 
05:56:05.510 --> 05:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
compliance with the bill's criteria in
 
05:56:07.430 --> 05:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
which case the department just collects
 
05:56:09.270 --> 05:56:09.280 align:start position:0%
information that the telephone utility
 
05:56:11.190 --> 05:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
provides and we say yep meets the
 
05:56:13.830 --> 05:56:13.840 align:start position:0%
criteria good to go or
 
05:56:15.190 --> 05:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
we're adopting
 
05:56:17.510 --> 05:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
rules that require doe to analyze the
 
05:56:20.230 --> 05:56:20.240 align:start position:0%
data that the telephone utility provides
 
05:56:23.030 --> 05:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
to confirm that it meets the criteria of
 
05:56:25.510 --> 05:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
the of the bill so that's where we
 
05:56:27.430 --> 05:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
become a question as to what degree of
 
05:56:29.110 --> 05:56:29.120 align:start position:0%
involvement the part is taking in this
 
05:56:30.310 --> 05:56:30.320 align:start position:0%
process and
 
05:56:32.310 --> 05:56:32.320 align:start position:0%
overlooking the criteria
 
05:56:33.670 --> 05:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
so that's where the department
 
05:56:36.070 --> 05:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
anticipated that would cost roughly 50
 
05:56:37.510 --> 05:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
to 100 000
 
05:56:38.948 --> 05:56:38.958 align:start position:0%
for each consultant and we're
 
05:56:40.788 --> 05:56:40.798 align:start position:0%
anticipating two consultants one for
 
05:56:43.590 --> 05:56:43.600 align:start position:0%
wire one for non-wireless um and that
 
05:56:45.270 --> 05:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
would likely be paid through general
 
05:56:47.750 --> 05:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
assessment and spread amongst the
 
05:56:49.830 --> 05:56:49.840 align:start position:0%
utilities customers
 
05:56:51.750 --> 05:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
just for background as has been
 
05:56:53.910 --> 05:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned the telecom industry
 
05:56:53.920 --> 05:56:55.190 align:start position:0%
mentioned the telecom industry
is

05:56:55.190 --> 05:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:56:58.230 --> 05:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
vastly deregulated in the state um
 
05:56:59.670 --> 05:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
competition in this industry is meant to
 
05:57:01.590 --> 05:57:01.600 align:start position:0%
provide alternatives obviously lower
 
05:57:04.150 --> 05:57:04.160 align:start position:0%
costs for consumers
 
05:57:06.628 --> 05:57:06.638 align:start position:0%
in this context though
 
05:57:08.470 --> 05:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
the incumbent carriers are those former
 
05:57:11.110 --> 05:57:11.120 align:start position:0%
telephone utilities that had designated
 
05:57:12.948 --> 05:57:12.958 align:start position:0%
franchise areas
 
05:57:16.310 --> 05:57:16.320 align:start position:0%
and these incumbent carriers have a
 
05:57:18.628 --> 05:57:18.638 align:start position:0%
carrier of last resort obligation i mean
 
05:57:20.470 --> 05:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
they have to provide at least a basic
 
05:57:22.230 --> 05:57:22.240 align:start position:0%
level of service to all customers in a
 
05:57:24.548 --> 05:57:24.558 align:start position:0%
given area
 
05:57:27.030 --> 05:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
the department in reviewing the bill did
 
05:57:29.430 --> 05:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
want to express some observations that
 
05:57:31.830 --> 05:57:31.840 align:start position:0%
while the telecom industry com uh while
 
05:57:33.270 --> 05:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
the telecom industry competition is
 
05:57:35.030 --> 05:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
quite robust in some parts of the state
 
05:57:37.430 --> 05:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
such as your your cities your large
 
05:57:40.390 --> 05:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
towns that have a greater population and
 
05:57:43.190 --> 05:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
demand can be higher many rural parts of
 
05:57:45.350 --> 05:57:45.360 align:start position:0%
the state do not have a higher level of
 
05:57:48.070 --> 05:57:48.080 align:start position:0%
competition due to a lesser demand less
 
05:57:48.080 --> 05:57:49.750 align:start position:0%
competition due to a lesser demand less
population

05:57:49.750 --> 05:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
population
 
05:57:51.990 --> 05:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
those rural areas are also less likely
 
05:57:53.590 --> 05:57:53.600 align:start position:0%
they have
 
05:57:53.600 --> 05:57:54.470 align:start position:0%
they have
certain

05:57:54.470 --> 05:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
certain
 
05:57:56.390 --> 05:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
aspects of wireless
 
05:57:58.548 --> 05:57:58.558 align:start position:0%
service coverage rural households would
 
05:57:58.558 --> 05:58:00.230 align:start position:0%
service coverage rural households would
therefore

05:58:00.230 --> 05:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
05:58:02.548 --> 05:58:02.558 align:start position:0%
not always but likely rely on their
 
05:58:04.390 --> 05:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
carrier of last resort for basic
 
05:58:05.990 --> 05:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
telephone service
 
05:58:08.070 --> 05:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
um obviously the bill permits a carrier
 
05:58:09.750 --> 05:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
of last resort to withdraw from its
 
05:58:12.150 --> 05:58:12.160 align:start position:0%
obligation to serve a municipality if at
 
05:58:15.990 --> 05:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
least 95 are served by a wire provider
 
05:58:18.708 --> 05:58:18.718 align:start position:0%
and 97 by a wireless voice provider
 
05:58:20.470 --> 05:58:20.480 align:start position:0%
however the bill doesn't establish any
 
05:58:22.310 --> 05:58:22.320 align:start position:0%
other criteria regarding service
 
05:58:24.868 --> 05:58:24.878 align:start position:0%
availability or any requirement to serve
 
05:58:27.110 --> 05:58:27.120 align:start position:0%
all customers in a given area so this
 
05:58:28.310 --> 05:58:28.320 align:start position:0%
could lead to some percentage of
 
05:58:30.390 --> 05:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
households being unable to access
 
05:58:31.830 --> 05:58:31.840 align:start position:0%
telephone service at times when they
 
05:58:33.030 --> 05:58:33.040 align:start position:0%
might need it for
 
05:58:35.590 --> 05:58:35.600 align:start position:0%
emergency services medical needs that
 
05:58:37.750 --> 05:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
type of thing
 
05:58:40.230 --> 05:58:40.240 align:start position:0%
similar concerns extend to the second
 
05:58:43.270 --> 05:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
element of criteria on lines 11 and 12.
 
05:58:45.590 --> 05:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
a provider or multiple providers may
 
05:58:47.270 --> 05:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
have received
 
05:58:49.590 --> 05:58:49.600 align:start position:0%
some level of government funding
 
05:58:51.270 --> 05:58:51.280 align:start position:0%
to serve an entire municipality but the
 
05:58:52.868 --> 05:58:52.878 align:start position:0%
bill does not state the type of service
 
05:58:54.628 --> 05:58:54.638 align:start position:0%
that's provided whether it's voice
 
05:58:56.628 --> 05:58:56.638 align:start position:0%
service or broadband or any guarantee
 
05:58:57.990 --> 05:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
that such service continues to be
 
05:59:00.070 --> 05:59:00.080 align:start position:0%
provided on what the terms and
 
05:59:02.470 --> 05:59:02.480 align:start position:0%
conditions are
 
05:59:04.868 --> 05:59:04.878 align:start position:0%
i think the most important criteria the
 
05:59:06.150 --> 05:59:06.160 align:start position:0%
observation that the department want to
 
05:59:08.150 --> 05:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
know is that the criteria for permitting
 
05:59:10.070 --> 05:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
an incumbent telephone company to drop
 
05:59:11.990 --> 05:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
service in the town only focuses on the
 
05:59:13.670 --> 05:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
competitive landscape
 
05:59:16.628 --> 05:59:16.638 align:start position:0%
at a specific point in time so if you
 
05:59:18.628 --> 05:59:18.638 align:start position:0%
have competition now
 
05:59:20.708 --> 05:59:20.718 align:start position:0%
it can't speak for what it might be in
 
05:59:22.310 --> 05:59:22.320 align:start position:0%
the future it doesn't have any
 
05:59:24.390 --> 05:59:24.400 align:start position:0%
consideration as to what change may
 
05:59:25.910 --> 05:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
occur after the incumbent has
 
05:59:28.868 --> 05:59:28.878 align:start position:0%
discontinued service so in theory it is
 
05:59:30.548 --> 05:59:30.558 align:start position:0%
conceivable that
 
05:59:32.070 --> 05:59:32.080 align:start position:0%
similar business considerations
 
05:59:33.830 --> 05:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
regarding lesser demand would result in
 
05:59:36.150 --> 05:59:36.160 align:start position:0%
competitors leaving a municipality or
 
05:59:38.150 --> 05:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities and that could occur
 
05:59:41.590 --> 05:59:41.600 align:start position:0%
without any doe review or approval um it
 
05:59:43.990 --> 05:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
just there's a i guess
 
05:59:46.470 --> 05:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
some potential unintended consequences
 
05:59:48.948 --> 05:59:48.958 align:start position:0%
in which residences in your rural areas
 
05:59:51.430 --> 05:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
your small towns might lose access
 
05:59:53.270 --> 05:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
including service for
 
05:59:55.750 --> 05:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
necessary communica communication
 
05:59:57.750 --> 05:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
services such as like i said uh
 
05:59:59.510 --> 05:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
contacting a doctor or emergency
 
06:00:01.910 --> 06:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
services um with that i apologize i
 
06:00:03.510 --> 06:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
rambled on but that concludes the
 
06:00:05.190 --> 06:00:05.200 align:start position:0%
department's testimony
 
06:00:07.110 --> 06:00:07.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr roberge any questions
 
06:00:09.430 --> 06:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
representative flett has a question
 
06:00:12.628 --> 06:00:12.638 align:start position:0%
yes i see the language of the bill
 
06:00:14.150 --> 06:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
in line four
 
06:00:15.910 --> 06:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
relatives carrier of last resort
 
06:00:17.590 --> 06:00:17.600 align:start position:0%
obligations in one or more
 
06:00:19.670 --> 06:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
municipalities correct so that this is
 
06:00:22.070 --> 06:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
not a blanket relief you might be
 
06:00:23.910 --> 06:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
relieved in manchester but have to keep
 
06:00:28.150 --> 06:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:28.160 --> 06:00:29.350 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:00:29.350 --> 06:00:29.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:00:30.830 --> 06:00:30.840 align:start position:0%
and what i think
 
06:00:33.510 --> 06:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
it i guess that's something that might
 
06:00:36.150 --> 06:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
need a little bit more specificity there
 
06:00:38.708 --> 06:00:38.718 align:start position:0%
um again i think the department is
 
06:00:40.390 --> 06:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
concerned that
 
06:00:41.910 --> 06:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
there is language in here that would
 
06:00:44.150 --> 06:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
allow an incumbent with their carry of
 
06:00:46.150 --> 06:00:46.160 align:start position:0%
last resort obligation to opt out of
 
06:00:48.470 --> 06:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
this obligation in which case they just
 
06:00:50.310 --> 06:00:50.320 align:start position:0%
have to prove that 95
 
06:00:53.590 --> 06:00:53.600 align:start position:0%
97 of households are served again that's
 
06:00:55.190 --> 06:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
it might be a small amount but it's more
 
06:00:56.390 --> 06:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
or less saying that there are some
 
06:00:58.868 --> 06:00:58.878 align:start position:0%
households that
 
06:01:03.190 --> 06:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
can kind of be left alone per se
 
06:01:06.948 --> 06:01:06.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:09.430 --> 06:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh
 
06:01:11.510 --> 06:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming
 
06:01:11.520 --> 06:01:12.868 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming
and

06:01:12.868 --> 06:01:12.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:01:15.350 --> 06:01:15.360 align:start position:0%
hearing our questions um
 
06:01:19.270 --> 06:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
on the the fiscal note the very bottom
 
06:01:21.830 --> 06:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
it says that um and we're talking about
 
06:01:23.990 --> 06:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
these department estimated costs for
 
06:01:27.590 --> 06:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
consultants between 50 and 100 000
 
06:01:30.708 --> 06:01:30.718 align:start position:0%
it reads there uh those costs would be
 
06:01:32.708 --> 06:01:32.718 align:start position:0%
directly assessed to the petitioning
 
06:01:32.718 --> 06:01:34.150 align:start position:0%
directly assessed to the petitioning
utility

06:01:34.150 --> 06:01:34.160 align:start position:0%
utility
 
06:01:36.230 --> 06:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
which may then attempt to recover the
 
06:01:38.948 --> 06:01:38.958 align:start position:0%
cost from its customers
 
06:01:42.070 --> 06:01:42.080 align:start position:0%
so if i get this right i mean the whole
 
06:01:45.430 --> 06:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
idea was initially in the good old days
 
06:01:47.670 --> 06:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
to provide everybody phone service even
 
06:01:50.150 --> 06:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
if they did live far away from
 
06:01:51.910 --> 06:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
a bigger area
 
06:01:54.230 --> 06:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
so those installations were made those
 
06:01:56.390 --> 06:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
polls were put in place
 
06:01:58.788 --> 06:01:58.798 align:start position:0%
and when they were those costs were paid
 
06:02:01.110 --> 06:02:01.120 align:start position:0%
for by the all the customers together
 
06:02:04.230 --> 06:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
to make sure that everybody got service
 
06:02:06.868 --> 06:02:06.878 align:start position:0%
now what this bill says is now in order
 
06:02:09.830 --> 06:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
for somebody to be relieved of this cost
 
06:02:12.470 --> 06:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
because the department now has costs
 
06:02:14.708 --> 06:02:14.718 align:start position:0%
those costs now will go back to the same
 
06:02:18.788 --> 06:02:18.798 align:start position:0%
customers to be paid for again
 
06:02:20.948 --> 06:02:20.958 align:start position:0%
it seems to me
 
06:02:22.548 --> 06:02:22.558 align:start position:0%
i don't know how much cost can be
 
06:02:24.310 --> 06:02:24.320 align:start position:0%
involved here because the initial
 
06:02:26.070 --> 06:02:26.080 align:start position:0%
installation probably was the most
 
06:02:27.350 --> 06:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
costly part
 
06:02:30.070 --> 06:02:30.080 align:start position:0%
maintaining those lines over many years
 
06:02:32.150 --> 06:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
couldn't have been that expensive
 
06:02:35.510 --> 06:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
so once they're in place
 
06:02:37.910 --> 06:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
taking them out is like creating dead
 
06:02:40.708 --> 06:02:40.718 align:start position:0%
capital where there was something before
 
06:02:43.510 --> 06:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh don't you agree that maybe uh
 
06:02:45.350 --> 06:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
financially this doesn't seem like it
 
06:02:47.270 --> 06:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
makes sense well i
 
06:02:47.910 --> 06:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
06:02:50.788 --> 06:02:50.798 align:start position:0%
representative i can't speak to
 
06:02:52.788 --> 06:02:52.798 align:start position:0%
i can't speak to what the cost would be
 
06:02:55.030 --> 06:02:55.040 align:start position:0%
for removing
 
06:02:56.470 --> 06:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
telephone infrastructure that's been
 
06:02:57.910 --> 06:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
there for years but at least just you
 
06:03:00.390 --> 06:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
know pertinent to the bill just the cost
 
06:03:02.310 --> 06:03:02.320 align:start position:0%
of the consultants for rule making would
 
06:03:04.788 --> 06:03:04.798 align:start position:0%
be paid for by doe's general assessment
 
06:03:07.110 --> 06:03:07.120 align:start position:0%
which would be levied on the telephone
 
06:03:08.868 --> 06:03:08.878 align:start position:0%
utility petition
 
06:03:10.470 --> 06:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
petitioning the department and they
 
06:03:13.350 --> 06:03:13.360 align:start position:0%
would likely spread those costs amongst
 
06:03:17.190 --> 06:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
the rest of their customers so you know
 
06:03:20.470 --> 06:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
it being what it is you know yeah that's
 
06:03:21.830 --> 06:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
i guess the way i would answer this just
 
06:03:23.190 --> 06:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
the cost of the consultants are spread
 
06:03:24.470 --> 06:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
amongst the telephone's utility
 
06:03:26.470 --> 06:03:26.480 align:start position:0%
customers okay thank you
 
06:03:28.948 --> 06:03:28.958 align:start position:0%
representative pementel
 
06:03:34.868 --> 06:03:34.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:36.548 --> 06:03:36.558 align:start position:0%
uh yeah thank you
 
06:03:36.558 --> 06:03:37.910 align:start position:0%
uh yeah thank you
uh

06:03:37.910 --> 06:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:03:40.310 --> 06:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
i have a i i don't know like a nightmare
 
06:03:42.868 --> 06:03:42.878 align:start position:0%
scenario looking at this whole thing
 
06:03:45.990 --> 06:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
and the nightmare scenario is that
 
06:03:48.070 --> 06:03:48.080 align:start position:0%
in places that actually meet the
 
06:03:48.080 --> 06:03:49.990 align:start position:0%
in places that actually meet the
criteria

06:03:49.990 --> 06:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
06:03:52.310 --> 06:03:52.320 align:start position:0%
they would all of a sudden find
 
06:03:53.750 --> 06:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
themselves with
 
06:03:56.310 --> 06:03:56.320 align:start position:0%
no carrier of last resort
 
06:03:58.150 --> 06:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
and then
 
06:03:58.160 --> 06:03:59.670 align:start position:0%
and then
um

06:03:59.670 --> 06:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:04:03.190 --> 06:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
the powers that be could
 
06:04:03.200 --> 06:04:04.628 align:start position:0%
the powers that be could
discontinue

06:04:04.628 --> 06:04:04.638 align:start position:0%
discontinue
 
06:04:08.548 --> 06:04:08.558 align:start position:0%
all wired service to that area
 
06:04:10.470 --> 06:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
and bring on
 
06:04:13.830 --> 06:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
what is being touted as the new thing
 
06:04:13.840 --> 06:04:15.350 align:start position:0%
what is being touted as the new thing
5g

06:04:15.350 --> 06:04:15.360 align:start position:0%
5g
 
06:04:17.190 --> 06:04:17.200 align:start position:0%
and and that would become the only
 
06:04:17.200 --> 06:04:18.150 align:start position:0%
and and that would become the only
choice

06:04:18.150 --> 06:04:18.160 align:start position:0%
choice
 
06:04:19.110 --> 06:04:19.120 align:start position:0%
is that
 
06:04:21.350 --> 06:04:21.360 align:start position:0%
an unreasonable scenario
 
06:04:23.270 --> 06:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
i think that's in part what the
 
06:04:25.270 --> 06:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
department is expressing concerned with
 
06:04:28.310 --> 06:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
is that when you have a
 
06:04:29.990 --> 06:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
incumbent utility let's just envision
 
06:04:31.510 --> 06:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
that this whole process set up goes
 
06:04:33.510 --> 06:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
through and everything like that um an
 
06:04:35.270 --> 06:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
incumbent utility petitions the
 
06:04:37.510 --> 06:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
department meets the criteria is
 
06:04:39.350 --> 06:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
relieved of that
 
06:04:41.910 --> 06:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
carrier of last resort obligation
 
06:04:42.948 --> 06:04:42.958 align:start position:0%
that that
 
06:04:46.070 --> 06:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
obligation does not then carry on to
 
06:04:48.310 --> 06:04:48.320 align:start position:0%
you know the other wire provider or
 
06:04:50.788 --> 06:04:50.798 align:start position:0%
wireless provider in that area
 
06:04:51.910 --> 06:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
and so
 
06:04:53.990 --> 06:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
if again it's only capturing the
 
06:04:56.150 --> 06:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
criteria only captures at one moment in
 
06:04:57.430 --> 06:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
time you know there could be people who
 
06:04:59.110 --> 06:04:59.120 align:start position:0%
move in out of an area and that type of
 
06:05:02.070 --> 06:05:02.080 align:start position:0%
thing so it's conceivable that
 
06:05:04.390 --> 06:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
the wire or wireless provider that's
 
06:05:06.628 --> 06:05:06.638 align:start position:0%
there after the incumbent utility leaves
 
06:05:07.830 --> 06:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
takes into account business
 
06:05:09.430 --> 06:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
considerations and decides there's
 
06:05:11.990 --> 06:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
lesser demand and competitors might move
 
06:05:13.830 --> 06:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
to and you know leave the municipality
 
06:05:15.510 --> 06:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
or take their business elsewhere in
 
06:05:17.670 --> 06:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
which case again that carrier of last
 
06:05:19.670 --> 06:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
resort obligation is no longer there so
 
06:05:21.910 --> 06:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
there might be the potential not saying
 
06:05:23.590 --> 06:05:23.600 align:start position:0%
it will happen the potential
 
06:05:23.600 --> 06:05:24.390 align:start position:0%
it will happen the potential
of

06:05:24.390 --> 06:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:05:26.628 --> 06:05:26.638 align:start position:0%
of some people in rural areas you know
 
06:05:28.390 --> 06:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
having difficulty accessing
 
06:05:30.070 --> 06:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
communication services for emergency
 
06:05:30.080 --> 06:05:32.150 align:start position:0%
communication services for emergency
services

06:05:32.150 --> 06:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
services
 
06:05:34.070 --> 06:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:05:36.310 --> 06:05:36.320 align:start position:0%
okay further questions for
 
06:05:38.390 --> 06:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh representative lewicky
 
06:05:39.830 --> 06:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you mr
 
06:05:43.270 --> 06:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
roberge um i'm seeing as i see this goes
 
06:05:44.868 --> 06:05:44.878 align:start position:0%
by municipalities and maybe you're the
 
06:05:46.708 --> 06:05:46.718 align:start position:0%
wrong person but
 
06:05:49.670 --> 06:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
it's very conceivable that people in one
 
06:05:51.750 --> 06:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
part of a municipality might have good
 
06:05:53.990 --> 06:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
cellular service and a significant
 
06:05:56.390 --> 06:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
number of them would drop their uh
 
06:05:56.400 --> 06:05:57.510 align:start position:0%
number of them would drop their uh
landline

06:05:57.510 --> 06:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
landline
 
06:06:00.150 --> 06:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
bringing that number down to some small
 
06:06:01.510 --> 06:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
percentage where
 
06:06:03.270 --> 06:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
people within the same municipality
 
06:06:05.430 --> 06:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
might not have cellular service and
 
06:06:05.440 --> 06:06:06.948 align:start position:0%
might not have cellular service and
might

06:06:06.948 --> 06:06:06.958 align:start position:0%
might
 
06:06:09.430 --> 06:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
essentially be cut loose just because of
 
06:06:10.868 --> 06:06:10.878 align:start position:0%
meeting the percentage requirements can
 
06:06:13.510 --> 06:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
you speak to that please i mean i guess
 
06:06:16.548 --> 06:06:16.558 align:start position:0%
let me there is a uh a thing on the puc
 
06:06:18.708 --> 06:06:18.718 align:start position:0%
website um right now that lists out all
 
06:06:20.548 --> 06:06:20.558 align:start position:0%
the utilities by city and town
 
06:06:22.070 --> 06:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
predominantly consolidated
 
06:06:24.230 --> 06:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
communications fills a significant
 
06:06:25.750 --> 06:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
majority of those areas but in some
 
06:06:28.548 --> 06:06:28.558 align:start position:0%
municipalities you'll see some crossover
 
06:06:30.788 --> 06:06:30.798 align:start position:0%
tds telecom might be involved in some
 
06:06:32.390 --> 06:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
parts of municipality consolidate as
 
06:06:32.400 --> 06:06:34.310 align:start position:0%
parts of municipality consolidate as
well

06:06:34.310 --> 06:06:34.320 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:06:36.708 --> 06:06:36.718 align:start position:0%
in regards to your question
 
06:06:38.150 --> 06:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
give me some rope and feel free to hit
 
06:06:44.230 --> 06:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:45.670 --> 06:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
i got sidetracked what was your question
 
06:06:47.990 --> 06:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry representative um
 
06:06:50.150 --> 06:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
in some municipalities there might be
 
06:06:51.990 --> 06:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
good cellular service in one part of the
 
06:06:54.708 --> 06:06:54.718 align:start position:0%
municipality and then in a more rural
 
06:06:56.390 --> 06:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
part of that same municipality there
 
06:06:57.590 --> 06:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
might be
 
06:07:00.788 --> 06:07:00.798 align:start position:0%
no wireless service and if substantial
 
06:07:02.230 --> 06:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
numbers of people within the good
 
06:07:04.628 --> 06:07:04.638 align:start position:0%
service part of town decide to drop
 
06:07:06.628 --> 06:07:06.638 align:start position:0%
their uh landlines because they've got
 
06:07:08.868 --> 06:07:08.878 align:start position:0%
the wireless service that then could
 
06:07:11.350 --> 06:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
leave people in the same part of town
 
06:07:13.030 --> 06:07:13.040 align:start position:0%
potentially in the dark
 
06:07:14.470 --> 06:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm sorry and thank you for
 
06:07:15.910 --> 06:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
repeating the question i apologize i
 
06:07:18.230 --> 06:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
didn't grab it the first time but again
 
06:07:19.430 --> 06:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
that i guess circles back to the
 
06:07:20.948 --> 06:07:20.958 align:start position:0%
department's concern is it's only
 
06:07:24.070 --> 06:07:24.080 align:start position:0%
grabbing a moment in time as to where as
 
06:07:25.910 --> 06:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
to what households have in the
 
06:07:28.150 --> 06:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
marketplace so you know okay at this
 
06:07:31.990 --> 06:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
point you might have 97 percent um who
 
06:07:34.230 --> 06:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
have a wireless provider but then
 
06:07:36.390 --> 06:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
um 95 percent whoever wired provider
 
06:07:37.910 --> 06:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
what have you but it could change over
 
06:07:37.920 --> 06:07:38.708 align:start position:0%
what have you but it could change over
time

06:07:38.708 --> 06:07:38.718 align:start position:0%
time
 
06:07:40.708 --> 06:07:40.718 align:start position:0%
and if people leave or anything like
 
06:07:42.708 --> 06:07:42.718 align:start position:0%
that or people move out or that type of
 
06:07:42.718 --> 06:07:43.750 align:start position:0%
that or people move out or that type of
thing

06:07:43.750 --> 06:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
thing
 
06:07:46.948 --> 06:07:46.958 align:start position:0%
there's no mechanism for the doe
 
06:07:49.750 --> 06:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
to issue any review or approval of that
 
06:07:52.310 --> 06:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
so some people again could be left in a
 
06:07:53.990 --> 06:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
gap and not have any access to
 
06:07:55.830 --> 06:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
telecommunications services that's i
 
06:08:00.470 --> 06:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:02.310 --> 06:08:02.320 align:start position:0%
okay representative oxenoum has a
 
06:08:02.320 --> 06:08:05.430 align:start position:0%
okay representative oxenoum has a
question

06:08:05.430 --> 06:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:07.030 --> 06:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
06:08:08.628 --> 06:08:08.638 align:start position:0%
thank you mr roberts for taking my
 
06:08:11.270 --> 06:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
question and thank you representative
 
06:08:14.070 --> 06:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
plett for bringing up cornish
 
06:08:16.708 --> 06:08:16.718 align:start position:0%
i had an inquiry just yesterday from a
 
06:08:18.868 --> 06:08:18.878 align:start position:0%
constituent in cornish who's very
 
06:08:22.070 --> 06:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
concerned about the area where he lives
 
06:08:25.190 --> 06:08:25.200 align:start position:0%
where there is no cell phone coverage
 
06:08:28.150 --> 06:08:28.160 align:start position:0%
and you know we we think about you know
 
06:08:30.070 --> 06:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
rural distances there's also problems
 
06:08:32.150 --> 06:08:32.160 align:start position:0%
with mountains
 
06:08:34.948 --> 06:08:34.958 align:start position:0%
there there are many problems here in in
 
06:08:37.830 --> 06:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
the 20th century one one of the great uh
 
06:08:39.830 --> 06:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
social progressive measures was rural
 
06:08:43.350 --> 06:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
electrification we made sure everybody
 
06:08:46.390 --> 06:08:46.400 align:start position:0%
had access to telecommunications in the
 
06:08:48.310 --> 06:08:48.320 align:start position:0%
21st century
 
06:08:49.430 --> 06:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
this is
 
06:08:52.150 --> 06:08:52.160 align:start position:0%
high-speed internet is an absolute
 
06:08:55.110 --> 06:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
essential and towns will get left behind
 
06:08:57.510 --> 06:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
businesses will leave if they don't have
 
06:09:00.628 --> 06:09:00.638 align:start position:0%
high-speed reliable communications i'm
 
06:09:03.910 --> 06:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
very concerned that this 95 and 97
 
06:09:03.920 --> 06:09:05.110 align:start position:0%
very concerned that this 95 and 97
percent

06:09:05.110 --> 06:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
percent
 
06:09:06.708 --> 06:09:06.718 align:start position:0%
is going to leave
 
06:09:09.430 --> 06:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
it it's walking away from that guarantee
 
06:09:11.510 --> 06:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
at a time when we need to be stepping up
 
06:09:14.548 --> 06:09:14.558 align:start position:0%
and saying yes universal access for
 
06:09:14.558 --> 06:09:15.990 align:start position:0%
and saying yes universal access for
every

06:09:15.990 --> 06:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
every
 
06:09:18.868 --> 06:09:18.878 align:start position:0%
resident every business in new hampshire
 
06:09:22.310 --> 06:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
is a social good a social necessity
 
06:09:22.320 --> 06:09:23.270 align:start position:0%
is a social good a social necessity
and

06:09:23.270 --> 06:09:23.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:09:25.910 --> 06:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
this this seems to be opening the door
 
06:09:29.030 --> 06:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
to walking away from that shared
 
06:09:31.110 --> 06:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
commitment that we've had in this
 
06:09:34.310 --> 06:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
country for for a hundred years
 
06:09:37.030 --> 06:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
do you share that concern i i i i
 
06:09:39.750 --> 06:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't i guess just from the
 
06:09:41.830 --> 06:09:41.840 align:start position:0%
department's perspective obviously we
 
06:09:43.350 --> 06:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
just want to i think we just want to
 
06:09:44.788 --> 06:09:44.798 align:start position:0%
ensure that
 
06:09:46.390 --> 06:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
people are not necessarily
 
06:09:48.708 --> 06:09:48.718 align:start position:0%
unintentionally left out
 
06:09:50.868 --> 06:09:50.878 align:start position:0%
of important telephone service
 
06:09:52.628 --> 06:09:52.638 align:start position:0%
specifically in times of emergency when
 
06:09:54.708 --> 06:09:54.718 align:start position:0%
they might need to contact a doctor
 
06:09:58.150 --> 06:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
9-1-1 or something like that
 
06:09:59.670 --> 06:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
i think that's just the concern of the
 
06:10:01.190 --> 06:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
department we just want to raise that
 
06:10:03.270 --> 06:10:03.280 align:start position:0%
unintended consequence during the
 
06:10:05.670 --> 06:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
committee meeting and if people want to
 
06:10:07.430 --> 06:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
modify the language or you know make
 
06:10:09.510 --> 06:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
some clarifications more than willing to
 
06:10:11.750 --> 06:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
be a party in those discussions but at
 
06:10:13.270 --> 06:10:13.280 align:start position:0%
least just temporarily as the bill is
 
06:10:14.868 --> 06:10:14.878 align:start position:0%
written we just raised concern about
 
06:10:16.788 --> 06:10:16.798 align:start position:0%
those in small communities in rural
 
06:10:18.788 --> 06:10:18.798 align:start position:0%
areas of the state
 
06:10:20.548 --> 06:10:20.558 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:10:22.628 --> 06:10:22.638 align:start position:0%
uh representative platt has a question
 
06:10:24.230 --> 06:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:10:27.190 --> 06:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
back in the good old days with uh
 
06:10:27.200 --> 06:10:28.548 align:start position:0%
back in the good old days with uh
marbell

06:10:28.548 --> 06:10:28.558 align:start position:0%
marbell
 
06:10:32.948 --> 06:10:32.958 align:start position:0%
uh its various names um there was 100
 
06:10:34.788 --> 06:10:34.798 align:start position:0%
availability availability almost 100
 
06:10:34.798 --> 06:10:35.910 align:start position:0%
availability availability almost 100
service

06:10:35.910 --> 06:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
service
 
06:10:38.470 --> 06:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
uh and so the the utilities could afford
 
06:10:40.070 --> 06:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
to provide
 
06:10:41.430 --> 06:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
provider of last
 
06:10:43.830 --> 06:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
resort but isn't a different situation
 
06:10:45.990 --> 06:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
today when very few people except
 
06:10:49.750 --> 06:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
fossils like me still have a landline
 
06:10:51.670 --> 06:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
and so that th
 
06:10:53.990 --> 06:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
they're going broke essentially so how
 
06:10:56.150 --> 06:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
can you continue to demand provider of
 
06:10:58.628 --> 06:10:58.638 align:start position:0%
last resort under those conditions
 
06:10:59.510 --> 06:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
06:11:02.548 --> 06:11:02.558 align:start position:0%
representative um you know it's just
 
06:11:04.390 --> 06:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
in obviously in rural parts of the state
 
06:11:05.670 --> 06:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
as has been mentioned there are those
 
06:11:07.510 --> 06:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
dead zones where people don't have
 
06:11:09.270 --> 06:11:09.280 align:start position:0%
access to phone service or anything like
 
06:11:11.990 --> 06:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
that um
 
06:11:14.310 --> 06:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
and some of those individuals still rely
 
06:11:17.430 --> 06:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
on landline services to some degree
 
06:11:19.670 --> 06:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
um if you know we
 
06:11:21.910 --> 06:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
and i certainly understand um there
 
06:11:24.230 --> 06:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
being robust competition in the uh
 
06:11:25.830 --> 06:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
telecom industry obviously that's one of
 
06:11:28.070 --> 06:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
the re that's a factor as to why it was
 
06:11:30.390 --> 06:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
deregulated but
 
06:11:33.830 --> 06:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:35.110 --> 06:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
again it just circles back to the
 
06:11:37.510 --> 06:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
department having concern about people
 
06:11:39.830 --> 06:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
not having an ability to have
 
06:11:43.030 --> 06:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
telecommunication services if it's left
 
06:11:46.150 --> 06:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
if it's left open to uh a carrier of
 
06:11:47.830 --> 06:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
last resort dropping their obligation
 
06:11:49.670 --> 06:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
you have other telecom industries coming
 
06:11:51.110 --> 06:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
in there and they make they don't have
 
06:11:52.708 --> 06:11:52.718 align:start position:0%
an obligation anymore they make they
 
06:11:55.750 --> 06:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
make decisions based on you know what's
 
06:11:57.190 --> 06:11:57.200 align:start position:0%
best for the company and that type of
 
06:11:57.200 --> 06:11:58.390 align:start position:0%
best for the company and that type of
thing

06:11:58.390 --> 06:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
thing
 
06:12:00.390 --> 06:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
i hope that answers your question
 
06:12:02.548 --> 06:12:02.558 align:start position:0%
all right thank you mr roberge i think
 
06:12:04.390 --> 06:12:04.400 align:start position:0%
we want to move on here because we've
 
06:12:06.628 --> 06:12:06.638 align:start position:0%
got two representatives from telephone
 
06:12:08.548 --> 06:12:08.558 align:start position:0%

06:12:10.628 --> 06:12:10.638 align:start position:0%

06:13:22.310 --> 06:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
it used to also be dixiel telephone
 
06:13:24.628 --> 06:13:24.638 align:start position:0%
dixville telephone and i think you guys
 
06:13:26.150 --> 06:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
are some of you who've been around a
 
06:13:29.110 --> 06:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
while like my friend represent pitt
 
06:13:33.030 --> 06:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
remembers me testifying years ago that
 
06:13:36.310 --> 06:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
we needed to figure out how to allow
 
06:13:38.230 --> 06:13:38.240 align:start position:0%
dixville telephone to go out of business
 
06:13:40.230 --> 06:13:40.240 align:start position:0%
because they had a total of five
 
06:13:40.240 --> 06:13:41.750 align:start position:0%
because they had a total of five
customers

06:13:41.750 --> 06:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
customers
 
06:13:44.390 --> 06:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
and when the balsams was
 
06:13:47.190 --> 06:13:47.200 align:start position:0%
was functioning and the balsams itself
 
06:13:49.110 --> 06:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
must have had at least
 
06:13:50.868 --> 06:13:50.878 align:start position:0%
five hundred to a thousand lines but
 
06:13:52.788 --> 06:13:52.798 align:start position:0%
when the boston's closed
 
06:13:55.910 --> 06:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
dixville telephone literally had
 
06:13:57.990 --> 06:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
two tillotsons and two employees who
 
06:13:59.590 --> 06:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
were five customers
 
06:14:02.470 --> 06:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
now as much as there were five customers
 
06:14:02.480 --> 06:14:03.750 align:start position:0%
now as much as there were five customers
um

06:14:03.750 --> 06:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:14:06.230 --> 06:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
dixiel telephone could not go out of
 
06:14:08.548 --> 06:14:08.558 align:start position:0%
business without the approval of the new
 
06:14:10.070 --> 06:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire puc
 
06:14:12.390 --> 06:14:12.400 align:start position:0%
and we had to have the fcc approval as
 
06:14:12.400 --> 06:14:13.510 align:start position:0%
and we had to have the fcc approval as
well

06:14:13.510 --> 06:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:14:16.390 --> 06:14:16.400 align:start position:0%
that law with and deregulation had
 
06:14:19.350 --> 06:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
passed so that is still the case
 
06:14:21.830 --> 06:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
even if dunbarton telephone which is a
 
06:14:24.868 --> 06:14:24.878 align:start position:0%
very defined area
 
06:14:26.310 --> 06:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
wants to go
 
06:14:29.510 --> 06:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
close up and no longer provide lean line
 
06:14:32.230 --> 06:14:32.240 align:start position:0%
they have to have permission from the
 
06:14:35.270 --> 06:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
state in um and federal government and
 
06:14:37.270 --> 06:14:37.280 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry to have my back for you too
 
06:14:39.510 --> 06:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
it's a little it's a little it's hard to
 
06:14:40.708 --> 06:14:40.718 align:start position:0%
do anyway
 
06:14:42.788 --> 06:14:42.798 align:start position:0%
so let me just give you a little bit of
 
06:14:44.150 --> 06:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
an overview which representative
 
06:14:46.548 --> 06:14:46.558 align:start position:0%
harrington did a great job of doing
 
06:14:47.708 --> 06:14:47.718 align:start position:0%
back in
 
06:14:50.070 --> 06:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
1934 when we had the original
 
06:14:54.150 --> 06:14:54.160 align:start position:0%
communications act there was a duty to
 
06:14:56.788 --> 06:14:56.798 align:start position:0%
serve all in your territory
 
06:14:59.430 --> 06:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
and this is back in the old days when
 
06:15:01.830 --> 06:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
literally each telephone company was
 
06:15:05.750 --> 06:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
given a territory it was a monopoly
 
06:15:07.750 --> 06:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
so they had a territory and in that
 
06:15:10.150 --> 06:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
territory they had to serve
 
06:15:12.310 --> 06:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
and it didn't really make any difference
 
06:15:14.230 --> 06:15:14.240 align:start position:0%
where you were you had to serve them
 
06:15:15.670 --> 06:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
with landline
 
06:15:19.590 --> 06:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
then in 1996 they passed the telecom act
 
06:15:22.868 --> 06:15:22.878 align:start position:0%
of 96 and that act was really geared
 
06:15:25.030 --> 06:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
towards competition
 
06:15:27.350 --> 06:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
i will say to you and as many of you
 
06:15:29.590 --> 06:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
know i did uh was associated with
 
06:15:31.910 --> 06:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
fairpoint for a while
 
06:15:34.390 --> 06:15:34.400 align:start position:0%
there is absolutely no question in 25
 
06:15:37.510 --> 06:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
years there is tremendous competition
 
06:15:41.190 --> 06:15:41.200 align:start position:0%
and it's cable it's void it
 
06:15:43.830 --> 06:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
it's satellite it's wireless etc the
 
06:15:47.270 --> 06:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
telecom act of 96 has really actually
 
06:15:47.280 --> 06:15:48.390 align:start position:0%
telecom act of 96 has really actually
succeeded

06:15:48.390 --> 06:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
succeeded
 
06:15:51.830 --> 06:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh they did say though
 
06:15:55.190 --> 06:15:55.200 align:start position:0%
that if you were going to be relieved of
 
06:15:58.470 --> 06:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
your carry of last resort obligation it
 
06:16:01.510 --> 06:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
had to be approved by the state and it
 
06:16:03.830 --> 06:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
had to gain the support of the local
 
06:16:06.548 --> 06:16:06.558 align:start position:0%
commission the local puc
 
06:16:06.558 --> 06:16:07.830 align:start position:0%
commission the local puc
so

06:16:07.830 --> 06:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:16:12.310 --> 06:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
today those states that have limited or
 
06:16:14.470 --> 06:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
gotten rid of their carry of last resort
 
06:16:14.480 --> 06:16:15.910 align:start position:0%
gotten rid of their carry of last resort
obligations

06:16:15.910 --> 06:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
obligations
 
06:16:17.270 --> 06:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
had to have
 
06:16:20.948 --> 06:16:20.958 align:start position:0%
approval by the the commission or or the
 
06:16:20.958 --> 06:16:21.910 align:start position:0%
approval by the the commission or or the
state

06:16:21.910 --> 06:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
state
 
06:16:21.920 --> 06:16:22.948 align:start position:0%
state
um

06:16:22.948 --> 06:16:22.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:16:26.868 --> 06:16:26.878 align:start position:0%
so this legislation is really enabling a
 
06:16:29.190 --> 06:16:29.200 align:start position:0%
legislation from my point of view
 
06:16:32.390 --> 06:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
there are now um and i have to honestly
 
06:16:35.270 --> 06:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
say i haven't checked today but
 
06:16:40.470 --> 06:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
there are uh 38 states that have limited
 
06:16:42.230 --> 06:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
limited carry of last resorts
 
06:16:44.070 --> 06:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
obligations the nine states that have
 
06:16:44.080 --> 06:16:45.030 align:start position:0%
obligations the nine states that have
none

06:16:45.030 --> 06:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
none
 
06:16:46.948 --> 06:16:46.958 align:start position:0%
three states didn't answer a survey so
 
06:16:48.230 --> 06:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not really quite sure what's going
 
06:16:49.910 --> 06:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
on in those three states
 
06:16:49.920 --> 06:16:50.708 align:start position:0%
on in those three states
but

06:16:50.708 --> 06:16:50.718 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:16:54.230 --> 06:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is as the industry has
 
06:16:56.548 --> 06:16:56.558 align:start position:0%
changed people as just as representative
 
06:16:58.070 --> 06:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
harrington said
 
06:17:00.948 --> 06:17:00.958 align:start position:0%
have said wait a minute we got to change
 
06:17:04.070 --> 06:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
with it why if take example
 
06:17:07.110 --> 06:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
my client granite state telephone and
 
06:17:08.868 --> 06:17:08.878 align:start position:0%
then there and where
 
06:17:10.230 --> 06:17:10.240 align:start position:0%
where has
 
06:17:12.548 --> 06:17:12.558 align:start position:0%
a hundred percent competition
 
06:17:15.990 --> 06:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
and and not just on the
 
06:17:18.948 --> 06:17:18.958 align:start position:0%
cable side but also on the wireless side
 
06:17:21.670 --> 06:17:21.680 align:start position:0%
now does the town of washington have a
 
06:17:24.708 --> 06:17:24.718 align:start position:0%
hundred percent no because washington's
 
06:17:26.548 --> 06:17:26.558 align:start position:0%
a little more rural there's been no
 
06:17:28.310 --> 06:17:28.320 align:start position:0%
question over the years washington is
 
06:17:31.510 --> 06:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
desperately wanted wireless
 
06:17:34.070 --> 06:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
it's kind of there not really so would
 
06:17:35.590 --> 06:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
granite state
 
06:17:38.708 --> 06:17:38.718 align:start position:0%
come in and make an application to the
 
06:17:40.470 --> 06:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
department of energy or the puc
 
06:17:43.510 --> 06:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
whichever one we want to call it um for
 
06:17:45.110 --> 06:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
being relieved of the carry of last
 
06:17:47.430 --> 06:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
resort in washington no
 
06:17:49.110 --> 06:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
they can't meet the criteria they
 
06:17:51.670 --> 06:17:51.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't do it you can the way this bill
 
06:17:52.948 --> 06:17:52.958 align:start position:0%
is written do
 
06:17:52.958 --> 06:17:53.750 align:start position:0%
is written do
do

06:17:53.750 --> 06:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
do
 
06:17:57.910 --> 06:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
town by town in may they passed um they
 
06:18:00.548 --> 06:18:00.558 align:start position:0%
basically limited their cola regulations
 
06:18:03.590 --> 06:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
in 2016. now i don't like to think
 
06:18:06.310 --> 06:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
frankly that we're ever behind maine but
 
06:18:07.830 --> 06:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
we're behind me
 
06:18:10.788 --> 06:18:10.798 align:start position:0%
and so when they did it they actually
 
06:18:14.708 --> 06:18:14.718 align:start position:0%
specified certain towns like you can do
 
06:18:19.030 --> 06:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
portland you can you can do augusta so
 
06:18:21.030 --> 06:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
and this one it's really up to the
 
06:18:23.990 --> 06:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
company to say where do i not where do i
 
06:18:26.150 --> 06:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
have 95
 
06:18:28.390 --> 06:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
competition on the land line or the
 
06:18:31.110 --> 06:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
wired side and we're going to have 97
 
06:18:33.830 --> 06:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
percent competition on the wireless side
 
06:18:36.070 --> 06:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
and then move forward now i will tell
 
06:18:39.030 --> 06:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
you some of my clients that are members
 
06:18:40.390 --> 06:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
of the association aren't going to
 
06:18:43.270 --> 06:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
exercise this for one reason or another
 
06:18:44.948 --> 06:18:44.958 align:start position:0%
it's a business decision whether you
 
06:18:47.990 --> 06:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
exercise it so they may they may well
 
06:18:48.000 --> 06:18:49.270 align:start position:0%
exercise it so they may they may well
not

06:18:49.270 --> 06:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
not
 
06:18:50.788 --> 06:18:50.798 align:start position:0%
so anyway
 
06:18:54.230 --> 06:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
i see this is enabling i see this is
 
06:18:54.240 --> 06:18:55.750 align:start position:0%
i see this is enabling i see this is
totally

06:18:55.750 --> 06:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
totally
 
06:18:55.760 --> 06:18:56.708 align:start position:0%
totally
having

06:18:56.708 --> 06:18:56.718 align:start position:0%
having
 
06:18:59.110 --> 06:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire department of energy
 
06:19:01.350 --> 06:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
puc in control
 
06:19:03.990 --> 06:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely if anybody decides to give up
 
06:19:06.390 --> 06:19:06.400 align:start position:0%
landline they got to go to the ps the
 
06:19:08.390 --> 06:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
state and the fcc
 
06:19:11.430 --> 06:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
um i see this is actually there was a
 
06:19:14.230 --> 06:19:14.240 align:start position:0%
report i read a while back that said
 
06:19:17.510 --> 06:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
every state on a regular basis should
 
06:19:19.910 --> 06:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
actually do an analysis of the carry of
 
06:19:22.548 --> 06:19:22.558 align:start position:0%
last resort resort to see if we're
 
06:19:24.708 --> 06:19:24.718 align:start position:0%
keeping up with where things are now
 
06:19:26.310 --> 06:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
where the industry is and all the
 
06:19:28.310 --> 06:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
changes to my knowledge we have not done
 
06:19:31.190 --> 06:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
it so this is the first attempt to say
 
06:19:33.830 --> 06:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
hey let's move forward let's become
 
06:19:36.628 --> 06:19:36.638 align:start position:0%
current and let's really um
 
06:19:38.948 --> 06:19:38.958 align:start position:0%
let's really allow these companies
 
06:19:40.788 --> 06:19:40.798 align:start position:0%
opportunities when there's full
 
06:19:40.798 --> 06:19:42.070 align:start position:0%
opportunities when there's full
competition

06:19:42.070 --> 06:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
competition
 
06:19:44.628 --> 06:19:44.638 align:start position:0%
to answer i think i answered your
 
06:19:46.230 --> 06:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
somebody's question
 
06:19:48.708 --> 06:19:48.718 align:start position:0%
about the um the
 
06:19:50.628 --> 06:19:50.638 align:start position:0%
can you go out of business
 
06:19:52.548 --> 06:19:52.558 align:start position:0%
the other thing that's happened just so
 
06:19:55.830 --> 06:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
you know back in 2012
 
06:19:59.350 --> 06:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
we passed deregulation of the
 
06:19:59.360 --> 06:20:00.628 align:start position:0%
we passed deregulation of the
telephone

06:20:00.628 --> 06:20:00.638 align:start position:0%
telephone
 
06:20:02.788 --> 06:20:02.798 align:start position:0%
utilities and that was again of the
 
06:20:04.708 --> 06:20:04.718 align:start position:0%
landlines because we were heavily
 
06:20:06.948 --> 06:20:06.958 align:start position:0%
regulated i will say
 
06:20:08.628 --> 06:20:08.638 align:start position:0%
and i think some of you heard me say
 
06:20:10.708 --> 06:20:10.718 align:start position:0%
when i was at fairpoint and running that
 
06:20:12.948 --> 06:20:12.958 align:start position:0%
company i came in here at one point and
 
06:20:16.150 --> 06:20:16.160 align:start position:0%
said i feel like i've got shackles
 
06:20:16.160 --> 06:20:17.110 align:start position:0%
said i feel like i've got shackles
because

06:20:17.110 --> 06:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
because
 
06:20:18.468 --> 06:20:18.478 align:start position:0%
and i think you might have been on the
 
06:20:21.750 --> 06:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
commission then but we had
 
06:20:23.910 --> 06:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
our regulations were unbelievable we
 
06:20:27.350 --> 06:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
couldn't compete we had a labor union we
 
06:20:29.910 --> 06:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
had service quality and it was just it
 
06:20:31.270 --> 06:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
was unbelievable
 
06:20:33.350 --> 06:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
deregulation in new hampshire passed in
 
06:20:36.628 --> 06:20:36.638 align:start position:0%
2012 and i am proud to say
 
06:20:38.868 --> 06:20:38.878 align:start position:0%
all of the landline companies i think
 
06:20:40.788 --> 06:20:40.798 align:start position:0%
today are doing far better their their
 
06:20:42.468 --> 06:20:42.478 align:start position:0%
prices are better they're quite
 
06:20:44.468 --> 06:20:44.478 align:start position:0%
everything everything's working but
 
06:20:46.390 --> 06:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
having said that
 
06:20:48.788 --> 06:20:48.798 align:start position:0%
consolidated who's back there
 
06:20:51.030 --> 06:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
if they want to go into granite state
 
06:20:53.670 --> 06:20:53.680 align:start position:0%
telephone territory they can
 
06:20:55.910 --> 06:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
comcast has always been
 
06:20:58.070 --> 06:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
able to go in chart has been able to go
 
06:20:59.990 --> 06:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
in wireless has been able to go in but
 
06:21:02.788 --> 06:21:02.798 align:start position:0%
the old mob bells have not been able to
 
06:21:05.670 --> 06:21:05.680 align:start position:0%
go into the other mobile territory
 
06:21:08.150 --> 06:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
they can now you also now as you all
 
06:21:10.948 --> 06:21:10.958 align:start position:0%
know municipalities are competing that's
 
06:21:13.350 --> 06:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
why the language is in here about the
 
06:21:15.468 --> 06:21:15.478 align:start position:0%
municipalities i mean you've got some
 
06:21:18.868 --> 06:21:18.878 align:start position:0%
municipalities that are are right now
 
06:21:20.548 --> 06:21:20.558 align:start position:0%
building for unserved and they're
 
06:21:22.788 --> 06:21:22.798 align:start position:0%
looking to build completely built for
 
06:21:26.708 --> 06:21:26.718 align:start position:0%
served and unserved so i look at this as
 
06:21:29.270 --> 06:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
modernization and bringing us up to
 
06:21:30.628 --> 06:21:30.638 align:start position:0%
where we should be
 
06:21:33.670 --> 06:21:33.680 align:start position:0%
the other things i'd say in here is the
 
06:21:35.430 --> 06:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
section about rules
 
06:21:37.030 --> 06:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
so a lot of the questions that were
 
06:21:38.468 --> 06:21:38.478 align:start position:0%
asked of griffin and a lot of the
 
06:21:40.150 --> 06:21:40.160 align:start position:0%
questions can be dealt with
 
06:21:44.708 --> 06:21:44.718 align:start position:0%
in rules i also the assessments
 
06:21:47.350 --> 06:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
right now and i'm sure sarah davis will
 
06:21:49.350 --> 06:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
say more about this than i will but
 
06:21:51.510 --> 06:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
right now all the telephone companies
 
06:21:53.670 --> 06:21:53.680 align:start position:0%
are paying assessments to the puc or
 
06:21:55.350 --> 06:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
06:21:57.750 --> 06:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure we actually have a person
 
06:21:59.830 --> 06:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
over there that does telecom but we
 
06:22:01.750 --> 06:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
still pay
 
06:22:01.760 --> 06:22:02.788 align:start position:0%
still pay
so

06:22:02.788 --> 06:22:02.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:22:05.750 --> 06:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
if doe needs a consultant it comes out
 
06:22:07.830 --> 06:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
of those assessments we pay it will not
 
06:22:09.430 --> 06:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
come out of the general fund it comes
 
06:22:11.990 --> 06:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
out of those assessments
 
06:22:14.310 --> 06:22:14.320 align:start position:0%
i think i talked about town by town so
 
06:22:16.548 --> 06:22:16.558 align:start position:0%
we can go town by town so
 
06:22:18.390 --> 06:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
maybe you know there are towns that we
 
06:22:20.708 --> 06:22:20.718 align:start position:0%
will certainly i think many of these
 
06:22:22.788 --> 06:22:22.798 align:start position:0%
folks will not look at including
 
06:22:26.788 --> 06:22:26.798 align:start position:0%
including um consolidated i do have the
 
06:22:29.990 --> 06:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
site if anybody wants it on the
 
06:22:32.788 --> 06:22:32.798 align:start position:0%
fcc and the federal communications
 
06:22:34.948 --> 06:22:34.958 align:start position:0%
act of 96 and
 
06:22:36.150 --> 06:22:36.160 align:start position:0%
people not being able to go out of
 
06:22:38.070 --> 06:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
business without commission
 
06:22:41.030 --> 06:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
i can't remember if i missed anything
 
06:22:43.350 --> 06:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
but i'm here to answer questions oh i
 
06:22:45.110 --> 06:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
knew you'd ask a question but he's got
 
06:22:47.910 --> 06:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
to recognize you first
 
06:22:50.468 --> 06:22:50.478 align:start position:0%
thank you and before i do
 
06:22:52.708 --> 06:22:52.718 align:start position:0%
i just heard you say something that i
 
06:22:54.548 --> 06:22:54.558 align:start position:0%
want to clarify make sure i understood
 
06:22:56.468 --> 06:22:56.478 align:start position:0%
correctly did you say
 
06:22:59.110 --> 06:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
that the puc is still assessing
 
06:23:01.350 --> 06:23:01.360 align:start position:0%
telephone companies even though they
 
06:23:04.310 --> 06:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
have no regulatory authority over them i
 
06:23:06.628 --> 06:23:06.638 align:start position:0%
did say that do you know approximately i
 
06:23:08.788 --> 06:23:08.798 align:start position:0%
did i did say that yes you know
 
06:23:10.788 --> 06:23:10.798 align:start position:0%
approximately how much money is involved
 
06:23:12.788 --> 06:23:12.798 align:start position:0%
i can get you the numbers
 
06:23:14.548 --> 06:23:14.558 align:start position:0%
i will get i mean the assessments have
 
06:23:16.390 --> 06:23:16.400 align:start position:0%
gone down there's no question a number
 
06:23:18.070 --> 06:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
of years ago we kind of said wait a
 
06:23:19.670 --> 06:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
minute you don't have anybody so the
 
06:23:21.110 --> 06:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
assessment's going down but we're still
 
06:23:22.788 --> 06:23:22.798 align:start position:0%
being assessed and i think if i'm
 
06:23:24.708 --> 06:23:24.718 align:start position:0%
correct miss davis is shaking her head
 
06:23:26.230 --> 06:23:26.240 align:start position:0%
when you say the assessments have gone
 
06:23:28.628 --> 06:23:28.638 align:start position:0%
down no no no what no no wait wait wait
 
06:23:28.638 --> 06:23:29.350 align:start position:0%
down no no no what no no wait wait wait
wait wait

06:23:29.350 --> 06:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
wait wait
 
06:23:31.350 --> 06:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
wait wait that what i was going to say
 
06:23:34.468 --> 06:23:34.478 align:start position:0%
to clarify is that it percentage-wise it
 
06:23:36.628 --> 06:23:36.638 align:start position:0%
went down and then when the department
 
06:23:38.390 --> 06:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
of energy was created they all of a
 
06:23:40.868 --> 06:23:40.878 align:start position:0%
sudden went back up and that was to
 
06:23:43.110 --> 06:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
cover the cost of the department of
 
06:23:45.270 --> 06:23:45.280 align:start position:0%
energy so
 
06:23:47.190 --> 06:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
way back when we got deregulation and
 
06:23:49.350 --> 06:23:49.360 align:start position:0%
there was no staff the percentage of
 
06:23:52.468 --> 06:23:52.478 align:start position:0%
what we paid was going down now for they
 
06:23:54.548 --> 06:23:54.558 align:start position:0%
claim it's going down after this year
 
06:23:56.150 --> 06:23:56.160 align:start position:0%
after we get the department of energy
 
06:24:00.230 --> 06:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
but no we pay all of the companies pay
 
06:24:02.468 --> 06:24:02.478 align:start position:0%
okay i'll ask you this question i asked
 
06:24:04.150 --> 06:24:04.160 align:start position:0%
representative harrington and he he
 
06:24:06.468 --> 06:24:06.478 align:start position:0%
deferred it to you oh dear he described
 
06:24:08.708 --> 06:24:08.718 align:start position:0%
one of the benefits of this legislation
 
06:24:11.270 --> 06:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
as really relieving the incumbent
 
06:24:13.190 --> 06:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
incumbent utilities
 
06:24:15.110 --> 06:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
of costs
 
06:24:15.120 --> 06:24:15.910 align:start position:0%
of costs
uh

06:24:15.910 --> 06:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:24:17.830 --> 06:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
do you know approximately how much those
 
06:24:20.948 --> 06:24:20.958 align:start position:0%
costs would be i'll let mrs davis um
 
06:24:23.510 --> 06:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
answer that because i did not i did not
 
06:24:26.150 --> 06:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
survey but i'm happy to do so all the uh
 
06:24:28.548 --> 06:24:28.558 align:start position:0%
all the other all the other companies
 
06:24:30.310 --> 06:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
okay i'm sure representative callie
 
06:24:31.750 --> 06:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
pitts has a question
 
06:24:33.910 --> 06:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
being a dinosaur and still having i'm
 
06:24:35.510 --> 06:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
with you i'm with you remember having a
 
06:24:37.590 --> 06:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
landline yeah and
 
06:24:40.548 --> 06:24:40.558 align:start position:0%
and the companies you know we heard a a
 
06:24:42.628 --> 06:24:42.638 align:start position:0%
presentation on 5g that said don't hold
 
06:24:44.708 --> 06:24:44.718 align:start position:0%
that in your head use your landline so
 
06:24:44.718 --> 06:24:45.670 align:start position:0%
that in your head use your landline so
now

06:24:45.670 --> 06:24:45.680 align:start position:0%
now
 
06:24:47.590 --> 06:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
i want to know and i asked before
 
06:24:49.110 --> 06:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
hopefully that i wouldn't have to ask
 
06:24:51.590 --> 06:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
the question was the 9-1-1 situation
 
06:24:54.070 --> 06:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
when you when you aban when you leave an
 
06:24:57.110 --> 06:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
area you abandon the area
 
06:24:57.120 --> 06:24:58.230 align:start position:0%
area you abandon the area
and

06:24:58.230 --> 06:24:58.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:24:59.910 --> 06:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
say three percent because you only have
 
06:25:03.030 --> 06:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
to have 97 percent served so three
 
06:25:04.230 --> 06:25:04.240 align:start position:0%
percent of the people are without
 
06:25:04.240 --> 06:25:06.070 align:start position:0%
percent of the people are without
service

06:25:06.070 --> 06:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
service
 
06:25:07.910 --> 06:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
is there still what we call left in
 
06:25:12.548 --> 06:25:12.558 align:start position:0%
9-1-1 that people can get 9-1-1
 
06:25:14.548 --> 06:25:14.558 align:start position:0%
and do you perceive
 
06:25:17.030 --> 06:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
this particular
 
06:25:17.040 --> 06:25:18.948 align:start position:0%
this particular
movement

06:25:18.948 --> 06:25:18.958 align:start position:0%
movement
 
06:25:23.110 --> 06:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:25.190 --> 06:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
cell phones i couldn't afford a thousand
 
06:25:27.270 --> 06:25:27.280 align:start position:0%
dollar cell phone which is what's out
 
06:25:29.030 --> 06:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
there now
 
06:25:31.430 --> 06:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
is that a movement that we're going to
 
06:25:33.750 --> 06:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
get away from land lines and just go to
 
06:25:36.628 --> 06:25:36.638 align:start position:0%
wireless well i think two questions okay
 
06:25:38.868 --> 06:25:38.878 align:start position:0%
i think and i i hopefully you'll ask ms
 
06:25:41.190 --> 06:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
davis the same question i think in this
 
06:25:42.628 --> 06:25:42.638 align:start position:0%
we're not asking you to get rid of
 
06:25:45.750 --> 06:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
landline service and where their service
 
06:25:47.830 --> 06:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
now their service we're just getting
 
06:25:49.430 --> 06:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
asking to get rid of the carry of last
 
06:25:52.868 --> 06:25:52.878 align:start position:0%
resort uh and that means you have to you
 
06:25:55.670 --> 06:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
have to serve anybody anywhere and it
 
06:25:58.310 --> 06:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
really impacts basic service now when
 
06:25:58.320 --> 06:25:59.670 align:start position:0%
really impacts basic service now when
when

06:25:59.670 --> 06:25:59.680 align:start position:0%
when
 
06:26:03.030 --> 06:26:03.040 align:start position:0%
when there was deregulation back in 12 a
 
06:26:05.590 --> 06:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
lot of the standards left but the one
 
06:26:08.070 --> 06:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
thing the company consolidated at that
 
06:26:09.830 --> 06:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
point fear point still had to do was
 
06:26:11.670 --> 06:26:11.680 align:start position:0%
offer basic service
 
06:26:14.390 --> 06:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
and we had to offer that as i recall and
 
06:26:16.788 --> 06:26:16.798 align:start position:0%
sarah helped me because sarah sarah was
 
06:26:21.350 --> 06:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
in regulatory back then too as i recall
 
06:26:25.110 --> 06:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
we had a cap on how much that cost could
 
06:26:27.910 --> 06:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
go up for five for four years i think
 
06:26:29.990 --> 06:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
and then after that the cap went went
 
06:26:30.000 --> 06:26:30.788 align:start position:0%
and then after that the cap went went
off

06:26:30.788 --> 06:26:30.798 align:start position:0%
off
 
06:26:30.798 --> 06:26:31.750 align:start position:0%
off
now

06:26:31.750 --> 06:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
now
 
06:26:33.510 --> 06:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
everybody still is offering basic
 
06:26:36.070 --> 06:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
service but there's no cap and that
 
06:26:39.030 --> 06:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean if like me i have basic
 
06:26:41.270 --> 06:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
service i have
 
06:26:44.070 --> 06:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
two landlines and i have wireless but
 
06:26:46.548 --> 06:26:46.558 align:start position:0%
i've got a landline on my alarm system
 
06:26:48.310 --> 06:26:48.320 align:start position:0%
now guess what
 
06:26:50.150 --> 06:26:50.160 align:start position:0%
i'm using basic service because i don't
 
06:26:52.948 --> 06:26:52.958 align:start position:0%
use that so why should i pay 40 or 50
 
06:26:54.390 --> 06:26:54.400 align:start position:0%
dollars a month
 
06:26:58.628 --> 06:26:58.638 align:start position:0%
um so it just because you're eliminating
 
06:27:00.708 --> 06:27:00.718 align:start position:0%
the carry of last resort doesn't mean
 
06:27:02.390 --> 06:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
you're eliminating service and you
 
06:27:03.750 --> 06:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean you're eliminating the
 
06:27:06.868 --> 06:27:06.878 align:start position:0%
availability of service even now you've
 
06:27:09.590 --> 06:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
got in some depending on the company and
 
06:27:11.590 --> 06:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
in some parts of the state somebody
 
06:27:14.390 --> 06:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
who's down a five mile dirt road
 
06:27:16.948 --> 06:27:16.958 align:start position:0%
and the company has an obligation to go
 
06:27:20.230 --> 06:27:20.240 align:start position:0%
so far and then that person has to has
 
06:27:20.240 --> 06:27:21.510 align:start position:0%
so far and then that person has to has
to

06:27:21.510 --> 06:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:27:23.430 --> 06:27:23.440 align:start position:0%
at that point pay for it and i do
 
06:27:25.270 --> 06:27:25.280 align:start position:0%
remember whoever asked the question
 
06:27:27.750 --> 06:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
about i mean you want every customer you
 
06:27:29.990 --> 06:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
can get i do remember when i was at
 
06:27:31.910 --> 06:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
fairpoint this gentleman had called me
 
06:27:33.430 --> 06:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
up and said
 
06:27:36.390 --> 06:27:36.400 align:start position:0%
well you won't come down my road i built
 
06:27:38.390 --> 06:27:38.400 align:start position:0%
this spec house and it's three miles
 
06:27:40.150 --> 06:27:40.160 align:start position:0%
down this road and this was over in
 
06:27:43.110 --> 06:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
keene or outside of king and i said well
 
06:27:45.750 --> 06:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
you should have called me first because
 
06:27:48.788 --> 06:27:48.798 align:start position:0%
bottom line we can take it so far but
 
06:27:50.788 --> 06:27:50.798 align:start position:0%
we're not gonna pay
 
06:27:52.948 --> 06:27:52.958 align:start position:0%
ten thousand dollars to get but you can
 
06:27:55.750 --> 06:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
pay it and that was the only time i
 
06:27:57.590 --> 06:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
actually i shouldn't say this in front
 
06:28:00.468 --> 06:28:00.478 align:start position:0%
of sierra but i actually recommended
 
06:28:02.150 --> 06:28:02.160 align:start position:0%
that he use a different carrier because
 
06:28:04.468 --> 06:28:04.478 align:start position:0%
there was a carrier who had a guy over
 
06:28:06.788 --> 06:28:06.798 align:start position:0%
in keene who had a fixed wireless which
 
06:28:08.948 --> 06:28:08.958 align:start position:0%
was going to be cheaper for him and he
 
06:28:12.868 --> 06:28:12.878 align:start position:0%
did it so there are things you can do
 
06:28:15.670 --> 06:28:15.680 align:start position:0%
but um and it just depends on where you
 
06:28:17.270 --> 06:28:17.280 align:start position:0%
are and who the company is whether
 
06:28:19.110 --> 06:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
they're gonna you're gonna have to pay
 
06:28:21.350 --> 06:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
after they get to the end of their their
 
06:28:21.360 --> 06:28:22.628 align:start position:0%
after they get to the end of their their
polls

06:28:22.628 --> 06:28:22.638 align:start position:0%
polls
 
06:28:24.708 --> 06:28:24.718 align:start position:0%
all right i would like to bring miss
 
06:28:28.230 --> 06:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
davis up now and have her sit beside you
 
06:28:31.190 --> 06:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
ms rosenberger so that uh she can give
 
06:28:33.990 --> 06:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
us uh her insights
 
06:28:35.990 --> 06:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
and then um we can
 
06:28:38.948 --> 06:28:38.958 align:start position:0%
direct questions to both of you so
 
06:28:42.230 --> 06:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
ms davis uh representing um
 
06:28:44.708 --> 06:28:44.718 align:start position:0%
consolidated communications could you
 
06:28:48.548 --> 06:28:48.558 align:start position:0%
give us your um take on this legislation
 
06:28:50.070 --> 06:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
and then and then we'll open it up to
 
06:28:52.708 --> 06:28:52.718 align:start position:0%
questions to you too okay wonderful and

i'll try to try to answer all the
 
06:28:55.750 --> 06:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
questions but certainly there are a lot
 
06:28:57.270 --> 06:28:57.280 align:start position:0%
of good ones so if i miss anything i'm
 
06:28:59.910 --> 06:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
sure you'll follow up but good afternoon
 
06:29:02.390 --> 06:29:02.400 align:start position:0%

and distinguished members of this
 
06:29:03.760 --> 06:29:04.948 align:start position:0%
and distinguished members of this
committee

06:29:04.948 --> 06:29:04.958 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:29:06.628 --> 06:29:06.638 align:start position:0%
consolidated communications is
 
06:29:08.150 --> 06:29:08.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely committed to the state of new
 
06:29:09.910 --> 06:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire we're committed to broadband
 
06:29:11.830 --> 06:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
deployment in new hampshire we're
 
06:29:13.590 --> 06:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
upgrading with fiber over four hundred
 
06:29:15.990 --> 06:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
thousand locations over the next five
 
06:29:17.990 --> 06:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
years enabled completely by private
 
06:29:18.000 --> 06:29:19.190 align:start position:0%
years enabled completely by private
investment

06:29:19.190 --> 06:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
investment
 
06:29:20.868 --> 06:29:20.878 align:start position:0%
we have taken money from the rural
 
06:29:22.868 --> 06:29:22.878 align:start position:0%
digital opportunity fund which is the
 
06:29:25.110 --> 06:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
fcc's fund that replaced the universal
 
06:29:27.350 --> 06:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
service fund that existed before to
 
06:29:29.910 --> 06:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
upgrade very rural areas of the state we
 
06:29:31.510 --> 06:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
have public private partnerships with
 
06:29:33.670 --> 06:29:33.680 align:start position:0%
over 15 municipalities in the state
 
06:29:34.948 --> 06:29:34.958 align:start position:0%
where we are putting in fiber to the
 
06:29:36.468 --> 06:29:36.478 align:start position:0%
premise service offering one gig
 
06:29:38.628 --> 06:29:38.638 align:start position:0%
symmetrical we're absolutely committed
 
06:29:40.230 --> 06:29:40.240 align:start position:0%
to the state
 
06:29:42.230 --> 06:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
with respect to this bill it does date
 
06:29:45.670 --> 06:29:45.680 align:start position:0%
back to the 1934 act um which was then
 
06:29:47.990 --> 06:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
amended by the 1996 act and the purpose
 
06:29:49.190 --> 06:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
of that amendment was to encourage
 
06:29:51.270 --> 06:29:51.280 align:start position:0%
competition because ideally there's a
 
06:29:53.350 --> 06:29:53.360 align:start position:0%
free market for everything right and
 
06:29:55.190 --> 06:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
regulation steps in when the free market
 
06:29:57.350 --> 06:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
isn't working and it was very successful
 
06:29:59.030 --> 06:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
for the most part right i wish i wish
 
06:30:00.868 --> 06:30:00.878 align:start position:0%
everyone had a landline if everyone had
 
06:30:03.270 --> 06:30:03.280 align:start position:0%
a landline we wouldn't be here today um
 
06:30:04.868 --> 06:30:04.878 align:start position:0%
and and to the question about pushing
 
06:30:06.788 --> 06:30:06.798 align:start position:0%
people to cellular service we have not
 
06:30:08.830 --> 06:30:08.840 align:start position:0%
pushed them there they have gone there
 
06:30:11.430 --> 06:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately and if you look at your
 
06:30:14.230 --> 06:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
state's 911 metrics you know well over
 
06:30:17.270 --> 06:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
75 percent of calls are coming 911 calls
 
06:30:19.110 --> 06:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
are coming from wireless
 
06:30:22.150 --> 06:30:22.160 align:start position:0%
devices and and then a substantial
 
06:30:23.430 --> 06:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
portion and i don't know the number
 
06:30:26.070 --> 06:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
sitting here from cable devices and then
 
06:30:28.150 --> 06:30:28.160 align:start position:0%
only a small portion is left coming from
 
06:30:29.910 --> 06:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
a true landline but offered by the
 
06:30:32.390 --> 06:30:32.400 align:start position:0%
incumbent local exchange carrier and
 
06:30:34.070 --> 06:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
that's that's the fundamental change
 
06:30:36.628 --> 06:30:36.638 align:start position:0%
that has enabled this legislation that
 
06:30:39.590 --> 06:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
is requiring this legislation is that
 
06:30:41.830 --> 06:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
there is still a requirement on
 
06:30:43.830 --> 06:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
incumbent local exchange carriers that
 
06:30:46.230 --> 06:30:46.240 align:start position:0%
is not on its competitors it is required
 
06:30:48.150 --> 06:30:48.160 align:start position:0%
to continue and maintain and offer
 
06:30:50.310 --> 06:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
service in places where it may not make
 
06:30:51.350 --> 06:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
sense to
 
06:30:53.670 --> 06:30:53.680 align:start position:0%
and and as all your questions get to we
 
06:30:55.270 --> 06:30:55.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate the importance of continuing
 
06:30:57.030 --> 06:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
to offer service to those who are really
 
06:30:58.708 --> 06:30:58.718 align:start position:0%
going to be left without it and so
 
06:31:00.468 --> 06:31:00.478 align:start position:0%
that's why we've set the bar pretty high
 
06:31:03.350 --> 06:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
to your point 97 and 95
 
06:31:06.390 --> 06:31:06.400 align:start position:0%
is is a pretty high bar it's recognizing
 
06:31:07.910 --> 06:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
that there will be somebody who is 10
 
06:31:10.150 --> 06:31:10.160 align:start position:0%
miles down the road who just isn't
 
06:31:11.590 --> 06:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
served and frankly a lot of times
 
06:31:12.948 --> 06:31:12.958 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to be served they they
 
06:31:14.708 --> 06:31:14.718 align:start position:0%
built way out in the middle of nowhere
 
06:31:17.030 --> 06:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
to be off the grid and so it strikes the
 
06:31:19.350 --> 06:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
right balance i'd point out that 95 and
 
06:31:21.750 --> 06:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
97 percent of manchester is a
 
06:31:23.990 --> 06:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
significant number but also because of
 
06:31:25.990 --> 06:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
that density manchester has very good
 
06:31:27.270 --> 06:31:27.280 align:start position:0%
service and you'll probably find it's
 
06:31:29.590 --> 06:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
100 hundred percent as you get into
 
06:31:31.830 --> 06:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
smaller municipalities those percentages
 
06:31:33.750 --> 06:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
turn into a very small number and and
 
06:31:35.350 --> 06:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
that's where that analysis came from
 
06:31:37.110 --> 06:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
that's the analysis we did in maine at
 
06:31:39.350 --> 06:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
the time we did it it resulted in 21
 
06:31:42.628 --> 06:31:42.638 align:start position:0%
municipalities um that were eligible for
 
06:31:44.548 --> 06:31:44.558 align:start position:0%
deregulation and if you read the 21
 
06:31:46.230 --> 06:31:46.240 align:start position:0%
municipalities as theresa points out
 
06:31:47.750 --> 06:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
you're talking portland's in west brooks
 
06:31:50.070 --> 06:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
and very well served areas of the state
 
06:31:51.910 --> 06:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
it would be similar here so the
 
06:31:53.670 --> 06:31:53.680 align:start position:0%
cornishes and i don't know cornish in
 
06:31:55.510 --> 06:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
particular but i'm guessing it's got a
 
06:31:57.510 --> 06:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
significant portion that's lacking a
 
06:31:57.520 --> 06:31:59.270 align:start position:0%
significant portion that's lacking a
competitor

06:31:59.270 --> 06:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
competitor
 
06:32:01.670 --> 06:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
there is a possibility you know oh
 
06:32:01.680 --> 06:32:02.390 align:start position:0%
there is a possibility you know oh
i'm

06:32:02.390 --> 06:32:02.400 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
06:32:03.750 --> 06:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
completely honest person i'm an open
 
06:32:06.708 --> 06:32:06.718 align:start position:0%
book there is a possibility that um
 
06:32:08.788 --> 06:32:08.798 align:start position:0%
in the future some this other competitor
 
06:32:11.750 --> 06:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
could leave but that's not how companies
 
06:32:13.990 --> 06:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
typically act right they've taken the
 
06:32:16.070 --> 06:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
time to invest in putting wire line
 
06:32:17.750 --> 06:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
facilities or
 
06:32:19.590 --> 06:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
to permit a wireless tower which is no
 
06:32:22.390 --> 06:32:22.400 align:start position:0%
small feat um in an area to provide
 
06:32:24.548 --> 06:32:24.558 align:start position:0%
service they made that investment
 
06:32:27.030 --> 06:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
wanting to provide service there isn't
 
06:32:28.150 --> 06:32:28.160 align:start position:0%
something that
 
06:32:30.868 --> 06:32:30.878 align:start position:0%
precipitates a decision to just be done
 
06:32:33.270 --> 06:32:33.280 align:start position:0%
in the future in fact if
 
06:32:35.110 --> 06:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
consolidated were to just continue
 
06:32:37.030 --> 06:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
providing which we have no plans to do
 
06:32:38.868 --> 06:32:38.878 align:start position:0%
but if we ever were that's all the more
 
06:32:40.310 --> 06:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
reason to stay because that's a bigger
 
06:32:42.868 --> 06:32:42.878 align:start position:0%
piece of the pie right so that it's just
 
06:32:45.030 --> 06:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
not how companies rational companies act
 
06:32:46.468 --> 06:32:46.478 align:start position:0%
it's kind of like saying if we don't
 
06:32:47.990 --> 06:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
mandate a grocery store all the grocery
 
06:32:49.430 --> 06:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
stores would go away they wouldn't right
 
06:32:51.270 --> 06:32:51.280 align:start position:0%
there's there's profit to be made there
 
06:32:51.280 --> 06:32:52.150 align:start position:0%
there's there's profit to be made there
so

06:32:52.150 --> 06:32:52.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:32:52.160 --> 06:32:53.270 align:start position:0%
so
um

06:32:53.270 --> 06:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:32:54.628 --> 06:32:54.638 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'm trying to think of some of
 
06:32:57.430 --> 06:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
the other questions that were asked
 
06:32:58.868 --> 06:32:58.878 align:start position:0%
do you want to just i'll just open it up
 
06:33:00.390 --> 06:33:00.400 align:start position:0%
because you guys had such you get it you
 
06:33:02.070 --> 06:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
had all the questions so i'll just let
 
06:33:04.150 --> 06:33:04.160 align:start position:0%
you ask them yes we'll open it up to
 
06:33:05.990 --> 06:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
questions but before we do that i'm
 
06:33:07.110 --> 06:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
going to
 
06:33:11.430 --> 06:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:15.350 --> 06:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
35 fn and then recess that hearing for
 
06:33:17.670 --> 06:33:17.680 align:start position:0%
10 to 15 minutes so we can continue this
 
06:33:17.680 --> 06:33:19.030 align:start position:0%
10 to 15 minutes so we can continue this
hearing

06:33:19.030 --> 06:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
06:33:20.628 --> 06:33:20.638 align:start position:0%
all right so now let's go to the
 
06:33:22.468 --> 06:33:22.478 align:start position:0%
questions representative partial has a
 
06:33:22.478 --> 06:33:23.910 align:start position:0%
questions representative partial has a
question

06:33:23.910 --> 06:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:33:25.670 --> 06:33:25.680 align:start position:0%
at your chair and think about no that's
 
06:33:25.680 --> 06:33:26.548 align:start position:0%
at your chair and think about no that's
fine

06:33:26.548 --> 06:33:26.558 align:start position:0%
fine
 
06:33:28.468 --> 06:33:28.478 align:start position:0%
we chose
 
06:33:28.478 --> 06:33:29.830 align:start position:0%
we chose
um

06:33:29.830 --> 06:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:33:32.070 --> 06:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
my question is um how do you determine
 
06:33:34.310 --> 06:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
what is adequate cell coverage because i
 
06:33:35.910 --> 06:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
know that in some of the places where i
 
06:33:37.430 --> 06:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
pass through in the state
 
06:33:39.270 --> 06:33:39.280 align:start position:0%
um you can be standing in one particular
 
06:33:41.350 --> 06:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
spot in one second have service and next
 
06:33:42.788 --> 06:33:42.798 align:start position:0%
second it drops it's that's kind of like
 
06:33:44.070 --> 06:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
depend upon which way the wind is
 
06:33:44.080 --> 06:33:45.110 align:start position:0%
depend upon which way the wind is
blowing

06:33:45.110 --> 06:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
blowing
 
06:33:46.948 --> 06:33:46.958 align:start position:0%
um i don't know if that would qualify as
 
06:33:50.070 --> 06:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
being part of that 97 percent or
 
06:33:53.110 --> 06:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
yeah it's it's not always easy to
 
06:33:54.868 --> 06:33:54.878 align:start position:0%
establish exactly where there is service
 
06:33:56.468 --> 06:33:56.478 align:start position:0%
but there are significant coverage maps
 
06:33:58.390 --> 06:33:58.400 align:start position:0%
that can be used please speak into the
 
06:34:00.390 --> 06:34:00.400 align:start position:0%
mic i'm sorry it's very it's very
 
06:34:00.400 --> 06:34:01.830 align:start position:0%
mic i'm sorry it's very it's very
awkward

06:34:01.830 --> 06:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
awkward
 
06:34:04.628 --> 06:34:04.638 align:start position:0%
all right um it's it's not it's not
 
06:34:06.628 --> 06:34:06.638 align:start position:0%
always easy to tell with respect to cell
 
06:34:09.350 --> 06:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
coverage to a perfect extent there are
 
06:34:11.990 --> 06:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
coverage maps that demonstrate the area
 
06:34:14.230 --> 06:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
and that's sort of where the doe
 
06:34:16.628 --> 06:34:16.638 align:start position:0%
oversight comes in we we allow the
 
06:34:18.628 --> 06:34:18.638 align:start position:0%
opportunity to make rules to sort of
 
06:34:20.628 --> 06:34:20.638 align:start position:0%
check into the information to the extent
 
06:34:23.510 --> 06:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
possible it's not perfect nothing is
 
06:34:24.788 --> 06:34:24.798 align:start position:0%
perfect but
 
06:34:26.948 --> 06:34:26.958 align:start position:0%
in most instances when we've looked at
 
06:34:28.788 --> 06:34:28.798 align:start position:0%
the data it's it's a hundred percent
 
06:34:30.868 --> 06:34:30.878 align:start position:0%
coverage so there is plenty of wiggle
 
06:34:32.230 --> 06:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
room for a little bit of space that
 
06:34:34.150 --> 06:34:34.160 align:start position:0%
might not have coverage
 
06:34:35.670 --> 06:34:35.680 align:start position:0%
thank you no follow-up
 
06:34:39.270 --> 06:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
okay who's next representative samsic
 
06:34:42.390 --> 06:34:42.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and um
 
06:34:45.830 --> 06:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you um miss davis for and miss
 
06:34:48.070 --> 06:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
rosenberg um
 
06:34:51.030 --> 06:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
first of all i have a landline and i
 
06:34:52.230 --> 06:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
also have
 
06:34:54.070 --> 06:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
mobile phone lines
 
06:34:57.350 --> 06:34:57.360 align:start position:0%
and i noticed from past experience that
 
06:34:57.360 --> 06:34:58.708 align:start position:0%
and i noticed from past experience that
landlines

06:34:58.708 --> 06:34:58.718 align:start position:0%
landlines
 
06:35:00.708 --> 06:35:00.718 align:start position:0%
have a lot of advantages
 
06:35:03.430 --> 06:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
a doctor's office will fax you something
 
06:35:05.990 --> 06:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
on a landline but they will not send it
 
06:35:09.590 --> 06:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
to you by email or by mobile phone
 
06:35:11.990 --> 06:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
for security reasons
 
06:35:14.310 --> 06:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
the the other thing is that
 
06:35:14.320 --> 06:35:15.270 align:start position:0%
the the other thing is that
the

06:35:15.270 --> 06:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:35:18.708 --> 06:35:18.718 align:start position:0%
the question i have also as concern is
 
06:35:22.070 --> 06:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
when there is a a customer that
 
06:35:22.080 --> 06:35:23.190 align:start position:0%
when there is a a customer that
that

06:35:23.190 --> 06:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:35:26.548 --> 06:35:26.558 align:start position:0%
qualifies to be relieved of that
 
06:35:29.750 --> 06:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
that landline that they have
 
06:35:32.150 --> 06:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
there is no real assurance that that
 
06:35:33.990 --> 06:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
person can get
 
06:35:36.390 --> 06:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
affordable basic service from any other
 
06:35:36.400 --> 06:35:37.430 align:start position:0%
affordable basic service from any other
provider

06:35:37.430 --> 06:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
provider
 
06:35:40.150 --> 06:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
so maybe they have right now this basic
 
06:35:41.830 --> 06:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
service which they're trying to keep as
 
06:35:44.310 --> 06:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
low as possible cost wise
 
06:35:46.468 --> 06:35:46.478 align:start position:0%
and if they are
 
06:35:48.310 --> 06:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
you know they lose that landline
 
06:35:48.320 --> 06:35:49.510 align:start position:0%
you know they lose that landline
connection

06:35:49.510 --> 06:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
connection
 
06:35:49.520 --> 06:35:50.868 align:start position:0%
connection
um

06:35:50.868 --> 06:35:50.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:35:52.948 --> 06:35:52.958 align:start position:0%
they might end up like uh representative
 
06:35:54.468 --> 06:35:54.478 align:start position:0%
kelly pittsburgh was mentioning first of
 
06:35:56.948 --> 06:35:56.958 align:start position:0%
all having to buy expensive mobile phone
 
06:35:58.708 --> 06:35:58.718 align:start position:0%
and secondly the service itself will be
 
06:36:01.350 --> 06:36:01.360 align:start position:0%
more expensive so that means we're going
 
06:36:02.310 --> 06:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
to be
 
06:36:05.430 --> 06:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
shifting costs to people like that
 
06:36:05.440 --> 06:36:06.548 align:start position:0%
shifting costs to people like that
for

06:36:06.548 --> 06:36:06.558 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:36:08.788 --> 06:36:08.798 align:start position:0%
what we think is a basic
 
06:36:11.030 --> 06:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh need of any everybody whether
 
06:36:13.190 --> 06:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
business or residence of having
 
06:36:15.750 --> 06:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
phone and communications
 
06:36:17.270 --> 06:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
is that is that
 
06:36:19.590 --> 06:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
do i see that right i mean is that what
 
06:36:22.468 --> 06:36:22.478 align:start position:0%
could happen to some extent um there are
 
06:36:25.430 --> 06:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
there are programs um that are out there
 
06:36:27.590 --> 06:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
that first of all you can get a free
 
06:36:29.190 --> 06:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
cell phone and a certain bucket of
 
06:36:30.788 --> 06:36:30.798 align:start position:0%
minutes that is a low income program
 
06:36:32.788 --> 06:36:32.798 align:start position:0%
that is available for cellular phones
 
06:36:34.548 --> 06:36:34.558 align:start position:0%
there are what they call them lifeline
 
06:36:36.070 --> 06:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
cellular providers that provide that
 
06:36:38.868 --> 06:36:38.878 align:start position:0%
service there's also a large shift in
 
06:36:40.788 --> 06:36:40.798 align:start position:0%
and that's consistent with this there's
 
06:36:43.350 --> 06:36:43.360 align:start position:0%
a shift at the fcc and a focus on
 
06:36:45.190 --> 06:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
broadband and so they've shifted away
 
06:36:47.830 --> 06:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
the traditional funding that underpinned
 
06:36:49.670 --> 06:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
this whole premise when you talk about
 
06:36:51.670 --> 06:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
rural electrification there was funding
 
06:36:53.190 --> 06:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
for all of this right there was a
 
06:36:55.110 --> 06:36:55.120 align:start position:0%
recognition this was a public good and
 
06:36:57.030 --> 06:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
we would fund all this it's no longer
 
06:36:58.868 --> 06:36:58.878 align:start position:0%
funded anymore
 
06:37:01.030 --> 06:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
they've transitioned away from lifeline
 
06:37:02.788 --> 06:37:02.798 align:start position:0%
they've stepped it down it's it used to
 
06:37:05.510 --> 06:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
be 9.25 now it's down to 5.25 and it
 
06:37:07.270 --> 06:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
goes away next year and the only
 
06:37:08.868 --> 06:37:08.878 align:start position:0%
lifeline that'll be available is for
 
06:37:11.030 --> 06:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
broadband all the focus is on broadband
 
06:37:12.548 --> 06:37:12.558 align:start position:0%
and with a broadband connection you can
 
06:37:14.548 --> 06:37:14.558 align:start position:0%
certainly do an over-the-top service and
 
06:37:16.628 --> 06:37:16.638 align:start position:0%
so those tend to be affordable because
 
06:37:19.030 --> 06:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
there's robust competition there so
 
06:37:20.548 --> 06:37:20.558 align:start position:0%
there are programs out there that's
 
06:37:22.150 --> 06:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
where all the shift has been and that's
 
06:37:24.788 --> 06:37:24.798 align:start position:0%
what's precipitating this legislation is
 
06:37:27.030 --> 06:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
that there has been a shift away from
 
06:37:28.708 --> 06:37:28.718 align:start position:0%
everything that used to allow
 
06:37:30.628 --> 06:37:30.638 align:start position:0%
consolidated to continue to make
 
06:37:32.868 --> 06:37:32.878 align:start position:0%
maintain hundreds of thousands of miles
 
06:37:34.310 --> 06:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
of wire
 
06:37:36.390 --> 06:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
for you know what used to be hundreds
 
06:37:37.990 --> 06:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
and thousands of customers has now
 
06:37:39.910 --> 06:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
shrunk to you know not all that many
 
06:37:41.590 --> 06:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
customers because the competition that
 
06:37:43.750 --> 06:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
exists and the mandate to continue to
 
06:37:46.070 --> 06:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
keep doing something that isn't frankly
 
06:37:48.628 --> 06:37:48.638 align:start position:0%
subsidized and so your your concern is
 
06:37:52.708 --> 06:37:52.718 align:start position:0%
one that is is accurate but the problem
 
06:37:53.750 --> 06:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
is that
 
06:37:56.788 --> 06:37:56.798 align:start position:0%
continuing to maintain these costs
 
06:37:58.708 --> 06:37:58.718 align:start position:0%
while allowing competitors to take their
 
06:38:00.708 --> 06:38:00.718 align:start position:0%
piece of the pie is an unsustainable
 
06:38:03.190 --> 06:38:03.200 align:start position:0%
model at some point and so this is
 
06:38:05.270 --> 06:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
trying to strike the right balance
 
06:38:05.280 --> 06:38:06.390 align:start position:0%
trying to strike the right balance
between

06:38:06.390 --> 06:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
between
 
06:38:08.868 --> 06:38:08.878 align:start position:0%
um that unfunded mandate and and
 
06:38:10.548 --> 06:38:10.558 align:start position:0%
ensuring that people really do have
 
06:38:12.310 --> 06:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
access because there has to be a
 
06:38:13.910 --> 06:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
demonstration that there's somebody else
 
06:38:15.830 --> 06:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
there um so
 
06:38:18.310 --> 06:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
it's it's not it's not a 100 guarantee
 
06:38:20.310 --> 06:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
you know it's but it is trying to strike
 
06:38:23.110 --> 06:38:23.120 align:start position:0%
that balance between um recognizing that
 
06:38:24.948 --> 06:38:24.958 align:start position:0%
consolidated needs to compete and needs
 
06:38:27.110 --> 06:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
to be not hamstrung from acting
 
06:38:29.670 --> 06:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
consistent with its competitors and
 
06:38:31.990 --> 06:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
ensuring people have service
 
06:38:34.230 --> 06:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
we're running short on time so i'm going
 
06:38:35.270 --> 06:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
to have to
 
06:38:37.990 --> 06:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
limit it to one question for a member
 
06:38:38.000 --> 06:38:39.750 align:start position:0%
limit it to one question for a member
um

06:38:39.750 --> 06:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:38:41.750 --> 06:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
i have a quick question i asked it
 
06:38:44.468 --> 06:38:44.478 align:start position:0%
earlier uh approximately how much is the
 
06:38:46.150 --> 06:38:46.160 align:start position:0%
puc assessment
 
06:38:48.390 --> 06:38:48.400 align:start position:0%
our puc assessment i i'll get you an
 
06:38:50.548 --> 06:38:50.558 align:start position:0%
exact number but it's about a couple
 
06:38:51.590 --> 06:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars for
 
06:38:53.670 --> 06:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
consolidated and each telephone company
 
06:38:55.510 --> 06:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
pays that and as i stated before it went
 
06:38:57.350 --> 06:38:57.360 align:start position:0%
up this year and and they received a
 
06:38:58.788 --> 06:38:58.798 align:start position:0%
call because we no longer even have a
 
06:39:01.110 --> 06:39:01.120 align:start position:0%
telecom person there anymore um and
 
06:39:03.350 --> 06:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
fairness to the doe it's done through a
 
06:39:05.350 --> 06:39:05.360 align:start position:0%
formula and an assessment they you know
 
06:39:07.030 --> 06:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
they're not coming after us in
 
06:39:09.030 --> 06:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
particular or anything there but i think
 
06:39:11.350 --> 06:39:11.360 align:start position:0%
it's time with no telecom staff left to
 
06:39:13.430 --> 06:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
reset that formula probably
 
06:39:15.350 --> 06:39:15.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative callie
 
06:39:18.708 --> 06:39:18.718 align:start position:0%
pitts one question one question
 
06:39:20.948 --> 06:39:20.958 align:start position:0%
i had the question about the 911 system
 
06:39:22.390 --> 06:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
and it and
 
06:39:25.030 --> 06:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
and how much does it cost you
 
06:39:26.868 --> 06:39:26.878 align:start position:0%
when you run wire
 
06:39:29.590 --> 06:39:29.600 align:start position:0%
to now eliminate
 
06:39:29.600 --> 06:39:30.788 align:start position:0%
to now eliminate
the

06:39:30.788 --> 06:39:30.798 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:39:33.110 --> 06:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
cell phone service or the the landline
 
06:39:33.120 --> 06:39:34.948 align:start position:0%
cell phone service or the the landline
service

06:39:34.948 --> 06:39:34.958 align:start position:0%
service
 
06:39:37.110 --> 06:39:37.120 align:start position:0%
and replace that on
 
06:39:38.948 --> 06:39:38.958 align:start position:0%
very similar wire
 
06:39:41.510 --> 06:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
with broadband
 
06:39:43.110 --> 06:39:43.120 align:start position:0%
um so
 
06:39:43.120 --> 06:39:44.628 align:start position:0%
um so
the the

06:39:44.628 --> 06:39:44.638 align:start position:0%
the the
 
06:39:47.110 --> 06:39:47.120 align:start position:0%
standard industry estimate for running
 
06:39:48.708 --> 06:39:48.718 align:start position:0%
fiber if that's what like like the
 
06:39:50.628 --> 06:39:50.638 align:start position:0%
broadband we're building now today is
 
06:39:53.030 --> 06:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
fiber-based broadband um to run fiber is
 
06:39:54.948 --> 06:39:54.958 align:start position:0%
about five dollars a foot is what it
 
06:39:56.390 --> 06:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
typically cost to run fiber was that the
 
06:40:00.628 --> 06:40:00.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:01.750 --> 06:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping we're going to have another
 
06:40:03.110 --> 06:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
bite at the apple that wasn't the
 
06:40:03.120 --> 06:40:03.990 align:start position:0%
bite at the apple that wasn't the
question

06:40:03.990 --> 06:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:40:06.708 --> 06:40:06.718 align:start position:0%
i would like to know again the 911 is
 
06:40:08.230 --> 06:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
really important to me they used to have
 
06:40:10.948 --> 06:40:10.958 align:start position:0%
something i worked for the company
 
06:40:12.548 --> 06:40:12.558 align:start position:0%
before you were born
 
06:40:14.230 --> 06:40:14.240 align:start position:0%
and it was left in dial tone that
 
06:40:15.590 --> 06:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
anybody could
 
06:40:17.270 --> 06:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
plug in a phone service or not you could
 
06:40:18.788 --> 06:40:18.798 align:start position:0%
call 9-1-1
 
06:40:22.150 --> 06:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
uh similar services on broadband
 
06:40:24.788 --> 06:40:24.798 align:start position:0%
do you would you do that if
 
06:40:27.430 --> 06:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
you pulled out of an area would is is
 
06:40:29.590 --> 06:40:29.600 align:start position:0%
there an ability for somebody to call
 
06:40:29.600 --> 06:40:33.750 align:start position:0%
there an ability for somebody to call
9-1-1

06:40:33.750 --> 06:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:35.350 --> 06:40:35.360 align:start position:0%
yes i mean to the extent there's
 
06:40:36.948 --> 06:40:36.958 align:start position:0%
competition there's an ability for
 
06:40:41.350 --> 06:40:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:49.270 --> 06:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:51.510 --> 06:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
i think but i think
 
06:40:55.190 --> 06:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
the misconception maybe here is
 
06:40:58.310 --> 06:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
if they are relieved of the carry of
 
06:41:00.948 --> 06:41:00.958 align:start position:0%
last resort obligation
 
06:41:02.548 --> 06:41:02.558 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean they're leaving an
 
06:41:05.670 --> 06:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
area it just means that obligation is
 
06:41:05.680 --> 06:41:06.788 align:start position:0%
area it just means that obligation is
relieved

06:41:06.788 --> 06:41:06.798 align:start position:0%
relieved
 
06:41:08.948 --> 06:41:08.958 align:start position:0%
so the carry of last resort obligation
 
06:41:11.270 --> 06:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
is that basic service
 
06:41:17.830 --> 06:41:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:17.840 --> 06:41:18.628 align:start position:0%
 
well

06:41:18.628 --> 06:41:18.638 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:41:18.638 --> 06:41:19.510 align:start position:0%
well
they

06:41:19.510 --> 06:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
they
 
06:41:20.788 --> 06:41:20.798 align:start position:0%
i don't know what you mean they don't
 
06:41:23.030 --> 06:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
have to have they they
 
06:41:25.430 --> 06:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
they can still have just
 
06:41:27.910 --> 06:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
service that doesn't have call waiting
 
06:41:27.920 --> 06:41:28.788 align:start position:0%
service that doesn't have call waiting
and

06:41:28.788 --> 06:41:28.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:41:31.430 --> 06:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
voicemail could i just uh suggest that
 
06:41:32.788 --> 06:41:32.798 align:start position:0%
you ladies
 
06:41:35.110 --> 06:41:35.120 align:start position:0%
yeah you ladies discuss this offline
 
06:41:36.628 --> 06:41:36.638 align:start position:0%
representative bresni had a quick
 
06:41:38.628 --> 06:41:38.638 align:start position:0%
question yes it's quick i was just
 
06:41:40.788 --> 06:41:40.798 align:start position:0%
wondering about how many municipalities
 
06:41:43.030 --> 06:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
would be affected if this bill passes
 
06:41:45.110 --> 06:41:45.120 align:start position:0%
and and kind of a follow-up to that is
 
06:41:46.390 --> 06:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
how much does that change if you
 
06:41:48.390 --> 06:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
increase it the percentages by one or
 
06:41:48.400 --> 06:41:49.990 align:start position:0%
increase it the percentages by one or
two

06:41:49.990 --> 06:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
two
 
06:41:51.750 --> 06:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
i haven't done the analysis on
 
06:41:53.910 --> 06:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
increasing the percentages
 
06:41:56.628 --> 06:41:56.638 align:start position:0%
at current time based on
 
06:42:00.070 --> 06:42:00.080 align:start position:0%
fcc data that carriers file with the fcc
 
06:42:02.548 --> 06:42:02.558 align:start position:0%
i estimate it would be about 30 to 40
 
06:42:02.558 --> 06:42:05.510 align:start position:0%
i estimate it would be about 30 to 40
municipalities

06:42:05.510 --> 06:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
06:42:07.590 --> 06:42:07.600 align:start position:0%
and if i just may say the numbers that
 
06:42:09.670 --> 06:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
are there are the the percentages are
 
06:42:09.680 --> 06:42:10.628 align:start position:0%
are there are the the percentages are
pretty

06:42:10.628 --> 06:42:10.638 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
06:42:12.868 --> 06:42:12.878 align:start position:0%
pretty consistent with what has been
 
06:42:14.548 --> 06:42:14.558 align:start position:0%
done around the country
 
06:42:16.230 --> 06:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
these are not just pulled out for new
 
06:42:19.830 --> 06:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire they're totally consistent
 
06:42:20.948 --> 06:42:20.958 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
06:42:20.958 --> 06:42:22.070 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
okay

06:42:22.070 --> 06:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:42:24.150 --> 06:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
in many areas yeah yeah well we'd like
 
06:42:26.390 --> 06:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
to thank both you ladies for being here
 
06:42:28.868 --> 06:42:28.878 align:start position:0%
giving us great testimony and providing
 
06:42:30.830 --> 06:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
lots of wonderful answers to our
 
06:42:33.110 --> 06:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
questions i would urge members if you
 
06:42:34.390 --> 06:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
have additional questions that we
 
06:42:36.150 --> 06:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
couldn't get to
 
06:42:39.910 --> 06:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
to contact these ladies via email
 
06:42:39.920 --> 06:42:40.948 align:start position:0%
to contact these ladies via email
to

06:42:40.948 --> 06:42:40.958 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:42:42.708 --> 06:42:42.718 align:start position:0%
find out
 
06:42:44.548 --> 06:42:44.558 align:start position:0%
get the answers to your to your
 
06:42:46.390 --> 06:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
additional questions
 
06:42:48.150 --> 06:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
so with that i'm going to close the

okay

06:43:11.830 --> 06:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
okay

thank you
 
06:43:15.190 --> 06:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
all right with that we will close the
 
06:43:16.868 --> 06:43:16.878 align:start position:0%
public hearing on
 
06:43:18.150 --> 06:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
house bill

1328 fn
 
06:43:23.030 --> 06:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
and we will now
 
06:43:23.040 --> 06:43:25.030 align:start position:0%
and we will now
reopen

06:43:25.030 --> 06:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
reopen
 
06:43:27.548 --> 06:43:27.558 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on house bill
 
06:43:31.590 --> 06:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
1635 fn and i will call to the
 
06:43:34.628 --> 06:43:34.638 align:start position:0%
testimony table representative kat mcgee
 
06:43:36.708 --> 06:43:36.718 align:start position:0%
who is the prime sponsor to introduce
 
06:43:38.868 --> 06:43:38.878 align:start position:0%
this bill representative mcgee it's all
 
06:43:38.878 --> 06:43:40.868 align:start position:0%
this bill representative mcgee it's all
yours

06:43:40.868 --> 06:43:40.878 align:start position:0%
yours
 
06:43:42.548 --> 06:43:42.558 align:start position:0%
thank you chair votes and esteemed
 
06:43:44.310 --> 06:43:44.320 align:start position:0%
colleagues of house science technology
 
06:43:46.230 --> 06:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
and energy
 
06:43:48.468 --> 06:43:48.478 align:start position:0%
i come to you today as the prime sponsor
 
06:43:51.110 --> 06:43:51.120 align:start position:0%
of hb 1635
 
06:43:53.670 --> 06:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
a bill with bipartisan support in favor
 
06:43:55.670 --> 06:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
of updating new hampshire statute with
 
06:43:58.390 --> 06:43:58.400 align:start position:0%
regard to the purchase of output from
 
06:44:00.788 --> 06:44:00.798 align:start position:0%
limited electric energy producers also
 
06:44:02.868 --> 06:44:02.878 align:start position:0%
known as leap
 
06:44:05.590 --> 06:44:05.600 align:start position:0%
and qualifying storage
 
06:44:07.670 --> 06:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
as the energy market expands to include
 
06:44:10.150 --> 06:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
a variety of contributors the need for
 
06:44:11.830 --> 06:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
updated statutory language that
 
06:44:13.830 --> 06:44:13.840 align:start position:0%
accurately represents and defines that
 
06:44:16.150 --> 06:44:16.160 align:start position:0%
market becomes our challenge
 
06:44:18.230 --> 06:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
in the last two years multiple attempts
 
06:44:20.390 --> 06:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
have been made to add simple language
 
06:44:23.590 --> 06:44:23.600 align:start position:0%
that is represented in hv 1635 this
 
06:44:26.548 --> 06:44:26.558 align:start position:0%
language defines who qualifies as a
 
06:44:28.868 --> 06:44:28.878 align:start position:0%
limited electric energy producer by
 
06:44:32.868 --> 06:44:32.878 align:start position:0%
clarifying that a leap is number one
 
06:44:34.868 --> 06:44:34.878 align:start position:0%
a generator who's not engaged in net
 
06:44:34.878 --> 06:44:35.830 align:start position:0%
a generator who's not engaged in net
metering

06:44:35.830 --> 06:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
metering
 
06:44:37.350 --> 06:44:37.360 align:start position:0%
number two
 
06:44:39.350 --> 06:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
not registered as a generating asset
 
06:44:40.948 --> 06:44:40.958 align:start position:0%
with the iso new england or the
 
06:44:43.750 --> 06:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
independent system operators
 
06:44:46.868 --> 06:44:46.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:48.548 --> 06:44:48.558 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
06:44:53.270 --> 06:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:55.350 --> 06:44:55.360 align:start position:0%
who managed the grid is this where i
 
06:44:56.948 --> 06:44:56.958 align:start position:0%
left off and number three is not
 
06:44:58.468 --> 06:44:58.478 align:start position:0%
participating in any wholesale
 
06:45:01.270 --> 06:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
electricity market that would fall under
 
06:45:03.350 --> 06:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
federal jurisdiction
 
06:45:05.190 --> 06:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
since the generation from the limited
 
06:45:07.590 --> 06:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
electric energy producer is not being
 
06:45:10.070 --> 06:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
counted towards the centrally managed
 
06:45:12.468 --> 06:45:12.478 align:start position:0%
generation and is supplying local
 
06:45:14.548 --> 06:45:14.558 align:start position:0%
customers with energy that does not
 
06:45:16.788 --> 06:45:16.798 align:start position:0%
travel long distances over state lines
 
06:45:18.468 --> 06:45:18.478 align:start position:0%
or transmission lines
 
06:45:19.910 --> 06:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
it presents a new challenge for
 
06:45:21.750 --> 06:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
regulators to try and figure out how to
 
06:45:23.670 --> 06:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
account for the value of this energy
 
06:45:26.390 --> 06:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
market in the energy market
 
06:45:28.868 --> 06:45:28.878 align:start position:0%
qualifying the leap category of the new
 
06:45:31.190 --> 06:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire electricity market is the
 
06:45:34.110 --> 06:45:34.120 align:start position:0%
purpose of the changes suggested by hb
 
06:45:39.350 --> 06:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
1635 and its predecessor in 2021 hb 407
 
06:45:42.310 --> 06:45:42.320 align:start position:0%
for which i was also the prime sponsor
 
06:45:44.230 --> 06:45:44.240 align:start position:0%
the other new language included in this
 
06:45:47.110 --> 06:45:47.120 align:start position:0%
bill adds qualifying storage to the list
 
06:45:50.150 --> 06:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
of qualifying small generator types
 
06:45:51.910 --> 06:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
in order to acknowledge the role of
 
06:45:54.628 --> 06:45:54.638 align:start position:0%
storage in providing energy when the use
 
06:45:57.270 --> 06:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
of stored energy is appropriate
 
06:46:00.390 --> 06:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
both bills also quantify the generators
 
06:46:02.310 --> 06:46:02.320 align:start position:0%
as having a discharge capacity between
 
06:46:05.750 --> 06:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
one megawatt and up to five megawatts
 
06:46:07.030 --> 06:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
although the bill
 
06:46:09.350 --> 06:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
as written in 2021
 
06:46:12.390 --> 06:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
secured 115 sign-ins in favor and only
 
06:46:14.468 --> 06:46:14.478 align:start position:0%
two sign-ins opposed
 
06:46:16.468 --> 06:46:16.478 align:start position:0%
there were remaining questions on the
 
06:46:16.478 --> 06:46:17.670 align:start position:0%
there were remaining questions on the
committee

06:46:17.670 --> 06:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:46:19.510 --> 06:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
on this committee that made it a
 
06:46:21.910 --> 06:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
candidate for further study
 
06:46:24.070 --> 06:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
and a study committee was undertaken by
 
06:46:25.750 --> 06:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
three members of this committee and two
 
06:46:27.990 --> 06:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
members of the senate and chairman vos
 
06:46:30.468 --> 06:46:30.478 align:start position:0%
served as the chair though the
 
06:46:33.750 --> 06:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
definitions in hb 1635 are still
 
06:46:33.760 --> 06:46:34.948 align:start position:0%
definitions in hb 1635 are still
necessary

06:46:34.948 --> 06:46:34.958 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
06:46:37.190 --> 06:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
the study committee concluded there were
 
06:46:38.868 --> 06:46:38.878 align:start position:0%
issues beyond these definitions for
 
06:46:42.150 --> 06:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
which the legislature wanted answers
 
06:46:44.788 --> 06:46:44.798 align:start position:0%
those questions mostly relate to
 
06:46:47.430 --> 06:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
properly defining the small generator
 
06:46:49.350 --> 06:46:49.360 align:start position:0%
market in such a way as to inject the
 
06:46:50.948 --> 06:46:50.958 align:start position:0%
appropriate price signals and
 
06:46:53.110 --> 06:46:53.120 align:start position:0%
competition to enable the free market to
 
06:46:55.350 --> 06:46:55.360 align:start position:0%
work as intended
 
06:46:56.548 --> 06:46:56.558 align:start position:0%
should we
 
06:46:56.558 --> 06:46:58.788 align:start position:0%
should we
count

06:46:58.788 --> 06:46:58.798 align:start position:0%
count
 
06:47:01.590 --> 06:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
should we count retail local generation
 
06:47:04.150 --> 06:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
as load reduction since it diminished
 
06:47:06.070 --> 06:47:06.080 align:start position:0%
our need to buy additional regional
 
06:47:07.990 --> 06:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
electric supply
 
06:47:10.150 --> 06:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
what's the process for calculating and
 
06:47:12.708 --> 06:47:12.718 align:start position:0%
reimbursing the value of leap generation
 
06:47:16.628 --> 06:47:16.638 align:start position:0%
who reaps the rate benefits
 
06:47:18.548 --> 06:47:18.558 align:start position:0%
several members of this committee
 
06:47:18.558 --> 06:47:19.430 align:start position:0%
several members of this committee
uh

06:47:19.430 --> 06:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:47:22.230 --> 06:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
are signed onto a bipartisan senate bill
 
06:47:25.190 --> 06:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
321 that actually takes a more fulsome
 
06:47:28.548 --> 06:47:28.558 align:start position:0%
approach to addressing these questions
 
06:47:30.708 --> 06:47:30.718 align:start position:0%
hb 1635
 
06:47:33.590 --> 06:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
can be considered a subset of sb
 
06:47:36.468 --> 06:47:36.478 align:start position:0%
321 and so we should understand that
 
06:47:39.910 --> 06:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
passing hb 1635 in no way harms the more
 
06:47:42.230 --> 06:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
comprehensive senate bill
 
06:47:44.230 --> 06:47:44.240 align:start position:0%
the main reason for the brevity of this
 
06:47:46.548 --> 06:47:46.558 align:start position:0%
bill is that it was filed prior to the
 
06:47:49.190 --> 06:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
november 2021 leap study committee
 
06:47:49.200 --> 06:47:50.788 align:start position:0%
november 2021 leap study committee
report

06:47:50.788 --> 06:47:50.798 align:start position:0%
report
 
06:47:52.150 --> 06:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
uh i thank you for your time and i'll
 
06:47:56.230 --> 06:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:58.390 --> 06:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mcgee
 
06:48:00.910 --> 06:48:00.920 align:start position:0%
for introducing hb
 
06:48:04.150 --> 06:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
1635 representative plutt has a question
 
06:48:04.160 --> 06:48:05.030 align:start position:0%
1635 representative plutt has a question
yes

06:48:05.030 --> 06:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:48:08.948 --> 06:48:08.958 align:start position:0%
from the title uh rather the analysis
 
06:48:10.868 --> 06:48:10.878 align:start position:0%
do i understand that analysis is say
 
06:48:12.788 --> 06:48:12.798 align:start position:0%
that a leap could be
 
06:48:14.628 --> 06:48:14.638 align:start position:0%
created in nashua
 
06:48:19.110 --> 06:48:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:23.750 --> 06:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:25.510 --> 06:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
it is unlikely
 
06:48:27.430 --> 06:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
um but i don't have the answer for that
 
06:48:28.948 --> 06:48:28.958 align:start position:0%
i think there are probably people here
 
06:48:30.548 --> 06:48:30.558 align:start position:0%
who could answer you more specifically
 
06:48:32.310 --> 06:48:32.320 align:start position:0%
that are more familiar with
 
06:48:33.830 --> 06:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
whether that would
 
06:48:35.030 --> 06:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
that would work
 
06:48:36.868 --> 06:48:36.878 align:start position:0%
and whether any claim of transmission
 
06:48:38.310 --> 06:48:38.320 align:start position:0%
savings would work when they're doing
 
06:48:38.320 --> 06:48:42.070 align:start position:0%
savings would work when they're doing
that

06:48:42.070 --> 06:48:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:44.230 --> 06:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative harrington is
 
06:48:46.150 --> 06:48:46.160 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question yeah thank you
 
06:48:47.510 --> 06:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
06:48:49.830 --> 06:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
question uh speaking of that what was
 
06:48:51.190 --> 06:48:51.200 align:start position:0%
just mentioned transmission savings they
 
06:48:53.910 --> 06:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
go to uh page two of the bill and
 
06:48:55.830 --> 06:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of cost about avoid
 
06:48:57.590 --> 06:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
unreasonable cost shifting for
 
06:48:59.750 --> 06:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
transmission rates and lower down the
 
06:49:01.590 --> 06:49:01.600 align:start position:0%
page it says limited producers shall
 
06:49:03.110 --> 06:49:03.120 align:start position:0%
receive credits for actual voyage
 
06:49:05.190 --> 06:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
transmission charges and it goes on i
 
06:49:07.030 --> 06:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
won't read the whole paragraph
 
06:49:08.468 --> 06:49:08.478 align:start position:0%
and you would just mention that in some
 
06:49:10.468 --> 06:49:10.478 align:start position:0%
ways these are like a load reduction
 
06:49:12.628 --> 06:49:12.638 align:start position:0%
thing and of course we already have a
 
06:49:14.548 --> 06:49:14.558 align:start position:0%
program in iso new england where you can
 
06:49:15.990 --> 06:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
come in as a
 
06:49:18.390 --> 06:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
a load reducer and you can get a uh
 
06:49:20.628 --> 06:49:20.638 align:start position:0%
capacity supply obligation
 
06:49:23.030 --> 06:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
and you get paid for reducing load uh
 
06:49:26.150 --> 06:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
when demand is a certain time
 
06:49:27.350 --> 06:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
and um
 
06:49:28.868 --> 06:49:28.878 align:start position:0%
people there's quite a bit of this
 
06:49:28.878 --> 06:49:29.990 align:start position:0%
people there's quite a bit of this
there's

06:49:29.990 --> 06:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
there's
 
06:49:32.230 --> 06:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
many many many megawatts of mod on that
 
06:49:34.468 --> 06:49:34.478 align:start position:0%
but when you do this you don't get any
 
06:49:36.628 --> 06:49:36.638 align:start position:0%
credit for transmission savings
 
06:49:39.990 --> 06:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
so if you put on a
 
06:49:43.270 --> 06:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
put in a whole mess of new motors or
 
06:49:45.430 --> 06:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
go to new bulbing in a factory so you
 
06:49:48.708 --> 06:49:48.718 align:start position:0%
can reduce the uh demand um
 
06:49:50.868 --> 06:49:50.878 align:start position:0%
when it's called for to be reduced you
 
06:49:52.708 --> 06:49:52.718 align:start position:0%
can get a capacity supply obligation not
 
06:49:54.310 --> 06:49:54.320 align:start position:0%
only do you save the obviously money on
 
06:49:56.310 --> 06:49:56.320 align:start position:0%
electricity but you save you get paid by
 
06:49:58.070 --> 06:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
iso new england which means the rate
 
06:50:00.548 --> 06:50:00.558 align:start position:0%
payers for that amount of money what you
 
06:50:02.788 --> 06:50:02.798 align:start position:0%
don't get paid for is any transmission
 
06:50:04.788 --> 06:50:04.798 align:start position:0%
savings that may or may not manifest
 
06:50:07.030 --> 06:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
itself why do you want to carve this out
 
06:50:08.230 --> 06:50:08.240 align:start position:0%
different with this in giving
 
06:50:10.468 --> 06:50:10.478 align:start position:0%
transmission savings to this type of
 
06:50:12.150 --> 06:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
thing when it's basically this basically
 
06:50:14.150 --> 06:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
the same thing
 
06:50:15.510 --> 06:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
06:50:17.270 --> 06:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
representative harrington
 
06:50:17.280 --> 06:50:18.628 align:start position:0%
representative harrington
um

06:50:18.628 --> 06:50:18.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:50:21.750 --> 06:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
i think the point of this bill
 
06:50:23.910 --> 06:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
and the other legislation that we've
 
06:50:27.670 --> 06:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
been attempting is that this market this
 
06:50:30.230 --> 06:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
region this local retail market which
 
06:50:31.910 --> 06:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
does not participate
 
06:50:33.590 --> 06:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
in the wholesale markets that have that
 
06:50:36.070 --> 06:50:36.080 align:start position:0%
definition it does not have definition
 
06:50:38.230 --> 06:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
in other words how we account
 
06:50:38.240 --> 06:50:39.030 align:start position:0%
in other words how we account
for

06:50:39.030 --> 06:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:50:41.030 --> 06:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
if there is load reduction
 
06:50:43.110 --> 06:50:43.120 align:start position:0%
right that process is not defined in
 
06:50:45.670 --> 06:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
statute at this point so the limited
 
06:50:47.430 --> 06:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
electric energy producer in my
 
06:50:49.910 --> 06:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
understanding is a separate category
 
06:50:51.350 --> 06:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
that we have not yet defined
 
06:50:53.110 --> 06:50:53.120 align:start position:0%
sufficiently so that we understand
 
06:50:54.948 --> 06:50:54.958 align:start position:0%
whether if there are benefits coming
 
06:50:57.510 --> 06:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
from someone in this role how we would
 
06:50:59.190 --> 06:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
account for them so that the market's
 
06:51:01.830 --> 06:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
operating properly so i think the iso
 
06:51:03.990 --> 06:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
new england or the wholesale market
 
06:51:06.468 --> 06:51:06.478 align:start position:0%
piece i in my testimony i specifically
 
06:51:06.478 --> 06:51:07.430 align:start position:0%
piece i in my testimony i specifically
said

06:51:07.430 --> 06:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
said
 
06:51:07.440 --> 06:51:08.708 align:start position:0%
said
leap

06:51:08.708 --> 06:51:08.718 align:start position:0%
leap
 
06:51:10.708 --> 06:51:10.718 align:start position:0%
people participating in the limited
 
06:51:13.430 --> 06:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
electric energy producer market
 
06:51:16.548 --> 06:51:16.558 align:start position:0%
do not participate in that market so
 
06:51:18.788 --> 06:51:18.798 align:start position:0%
we need rules for them that's the point
 
06:51:20.628 --> 06:51:20.638 align:start position:0%
we have to think about that follow up
 
06:51:23.030 --> 06:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
follow up okay just so i'm cleared so
 
06:51:24.468 --> 06:51:24.478 align:start position:0%
what you're saying is it's a separate
 
06:51:25.830 --> 06:51:25.840 align:start position:0%
set of rules
 
06:51:25.840 --> 06:51:26.868 align:start position:0%
set of rules
but

06:51:26.868 --> 06:51:26.878 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:51:29.590 --> 06:51:29.600 align:start position:0%
we don't even though the effect on the
 
06:51:31.510 --> 06:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
overall grid is a reduction in the
 
06:51:33.110 --> 06:51:33.120 align:start position:0%
amount of electricity needed because
 
06:51:35.270 --> 06:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
you're being produced through this
 
06:51:37.590 --> 06:51:37.600 align:start position:0%
leap process rather than through the
 
06:51:39.590 --> 06:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
normal generation system
 
06:51:42.070 --> 06:51:42.080 align:start position:0%
that is the same as if someone
 
06:51:44.310 --> 06:51:44.320 align:start position:0%
reduces the demand for electricity and
 
06:51:46.868 --> 06:51:46.878 align:start position:0%
takes a capacity supply obligation but
 
06:51:48.708 --> 06:51:48.718 align:start position:0%
one case for the leap you want to get
 
06:51:51.110 --> 06:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
them to be paid for transmission savings
 
06:51:52.468 --> 06:51:52.478 align:start position:0%
and the other case
 
06:51:54.708 --> 06:51:54.718 align:start position:0%
uh they don't it's just so i'm clear is
 
06:51:56.628 --> 06:51:56.638 align:start position:0%
that which that's what you're proposing
 
06:51:56.638 --> 06:51:57.590 align:start position:0%
that which that's what you're proposing
yep

06:51:57.590 --> 06:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
yep
 
06:51:59.430 --> 06:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
yeah i think the
 
06:52:01.510 --> 06:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
way that i would understand it is this
 
06:52:03.670 --> 06:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
is a new category of someone who's
 
06:52:05.590 --> 06:52:05.600 align:start position:0%
contributing in terms of electricity so
 
06:52:08.230 --> 06:52:08.240 align:start position:0%
you you mentioned a couple of examples
 
06:52:10.390 --> 06:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
um like light bulbs you know that there
 
06:52:12.310 --> 06:52:12.320 align:start position:0%
are other ways that we save electricity
 
06:52:15.430 --> 06:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
or or reduce load but i don't think
 
06:52:17.670 --> 06:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
that's at the same capacity so this is
 
06:52:19.910 --> 06:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
sort of a retail piece that's in between
 
06:52:22.070 --> 06:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
the wholesale piece and the individual
 
06:52:23.990 --> 06:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
changing out light bulbs
 
06:52:25.910 --> 06:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
that is unaccounted for the way we do
 
06:52:27.830 --> 06:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
things today and so we want to try and
 
06:52:30.310 --> 06:52:30.320 align:start position:0%
put some definition around if there is a
 
06:52:32.468 --> 06:52:32.478 align:start position:0%
value let's get on it figure out what it
 
06:52:33.910 --> 06:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
is and then make sure that it works
 
06:52:33.920 --> 06:52:38.230 align:start position:0%
is and then make sure that it works
appropriately

06:52:38.230 --> 06:52:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:39.910 --> 06:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
okay additional questions for
 
06:52:42.310 --> 06:52:42.320 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee
 
06:52:45.510 --> 06:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
i have one following along
 
06:52:47.350 --> 06:52:47.360 align:start position:0%
with the question from representative
 
06:52:51.110 --> 06:52:51.120 align:start position:0%
harrington going back to page 2 line 20
 
06:52:53.110 --> 06:52:53.120 align:start position:0%
the limited producer shall receive
 
06:52:55.670 --> 06:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
credit for actual avoided transmission
 
06:52:57.750 --> 06:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
charges what is your understanding of
 
06:53:00.948 --> 06:53:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:05.430 --> 06:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:05.440 --> 06:53:07.910 align:start position:0%
 
hmm

06:53:07.910 --> 06:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:07.920 --> 06:53:08.708 align:start position:0%
 
i

06:53:08.708 --> 06:53:08.718 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:53:11.510 --> 06:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
i don't have an answer i'm not sure okay
 
06:53:14.548 --> 06:53:14.558 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how it will operate in the
 
06:53:14.558 --> 06:53:15.590 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how it will operate in the
system

06:53:15.590 --> 06:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
system
 
06:53:15.600 --> 06:53:16.548 align:start position:0%
system
um

06:53:16.548 --> 06:53:16.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:53:17.750 --> 06:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
i think the
 
06:53:19.990 --> 06:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
language here is just to say that that
 
06:53:20.000 --> 06:53:20.948 align:start position:0%
language here is just to say that that
there

06:53:20.948 --> 06:53:20.958 align:start position:0%
there
 
06:53:22.868 --> 06:53:22.878 align:start position:0%
should be a way for them to even if it's
 
06:53:24.708 --> 06:53:24.718 align:start position:0%
credited to them
 
06:53:25.990 --> 06:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
when they're
 
06:53:27.910 --> 06:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
it's credited to them on their bill and
 
06:53:29.750 --> 06:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
this is a calculation for what that
 
06:53:32.310 --> 06:53:32.320 align:start position:0%
avoided cost is but i'm not really sure
 
06:53:34.468 --> 06:53:34.478 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure there is somebody behind me
 
06:53:36.948 --> 06:53:36.958 align:start position:0%
that would be able to answer that
 
06:53:38.468 --> 06:53:38.478 align:start position:0%
okay great i'll ask
 
06:53:40.390 --> 06:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
okay someone else
 
06:53:42.230 --> 06:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
additional questions for representative
 
06:53:42.240 --> 06:53:43.270 align:start position:0%
additional questions for representative

seeing none i thank you representative
 
06:53:47.670 --> 06:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
for introducing this bill and now i'll

06:54:46.080 --> 06:54:47.670 align:start position:0%
the state's population um
and

06:54:47.670 --> 06:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:54:49.430 --> 06:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
what part of what this coalition is
 
06:54:51.350 --> 06:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
interested in doing is supporting the
 
06:54:52.830 --> 06:54:52.840 align:start position:0%
development of community power
 
06:54:55.510 --> 06:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
aggregation including enabling
 
06:54:58.150 --> 06:54:58.160 align:start position:0%
market-based alternatives to
 
06:54:59.830 --> 06:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
expanded net metering
 
06:55:01.830 --> 06:55:01.840 align:start position:0%
that would put
 
06:55:03.990 --> 06:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
competitive suppliers and municipal
 
06:55:05.990 --> 06:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
aggregations sort of on a level playing
 
06:55:09.590 --> 06:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
field with the utilities in terms of uh
 
06:55:12.070 --> 06:55:12.080 align:start position:0%
values that they can be recognized in
 
06:55:13.830 --> 06:55:13.840 align:start position:0%
terms of um
 
06:55:16.070 --> 06:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
value produced um
 
06:55:18.070 --> 06:55:18.080 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
06:55:20.948 --> 06:55:20.958 align:start position:0%
in the intent of this legislation
 
06:55:23.430 --> 06:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
which has been uh versions of it have
 
06:55:25.110 --> 06:55:25.120 align:start position:0%
passed the senate over the past couple
 
06:55:28.230 --> 06:55:28.240 align:start position:0%
of years um and and uh have been brought
 
06:55:32.070 --> 06:55:32.080 align:start position:0%
to this committee is to try to create a
 
06:55:32.080 --> 06:55:32.948 align:start position:0%
to this committee is to try to create a
uh

06:55:32.948 --> 06:55:32.958 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:55:34.548 --> 06:55:34.558 align:start position:0%
a market structure where there aren't
 
06:55:37.750 --> 06:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
cross subsidies in either direction um
 
06:55:41.990 --> 06:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
and and try to do it in a way that is um
 
06:55:44.070 --> 06:55:44.080 align:start position:0%
that they can that can actually work um
 
06:55:46.868 --> 06:55:46.878 align:start position:0%
as a complement to the iso new england
 
06:55:50.948 --> 06:55:50.958 align:start position:0%
um interstate wholesale market to enable
 
06:55:53.190 --> 06:55:53.200 align:start position:0%
a sort of a local distribution level
 
06:55:55.670 --> 06:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
market that sort of parallels that
 
06:55:57.910 --> 06:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
i should note that the statute
 
06:56:00.788 --> 06:56:00.798 align:start position:0%
that this reforms are say
 
06:56:03.190 --> 06:56:03.200 align:start position:0%
a 362 a 2a
 
06:56:06.070 --> 06:56:06.080 align:start position:0%
purchase of output by private sector has
 
06:56:07.788 --> 06:56:07.798 align:start position:0%
been on the books in new hampshire since
 
06:56:11.750 --> 06:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
1979 so so this idea is not a new policy
 
06:56:14.310 --> 06:56:14.320 align:start position:0%
the law currently provides that a
 
06:56:17.510 --> 06:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
producer a limited producer
 
06:56:19.670 --> 06:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
under you know up to five megawatts uh
 
06:56:22.390 --> 06:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
could sell its um energy to not more
 
06:56:24.230 --> 06:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
than three purchasers other than the
 
06:56:26.230 --> 06:56:26.240 align:start position:0%
franchise utility which could be any
 
06:56:28.708 --> 06:56:28.718 align:start position:0%
entity within the state um and could
 
06:56:29.990 --> 06:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
sell them more if the commission
 
06:56:31.830 --> 06:56:31.840 align:start position:0%
approves it the current law also
 
06:56:33.510 --> 06:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
provides that
 
06:56:37.430 --> 06:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
such limited producers may receive
 
06:56:39.190 --> 06:56:39.200 align:start position:0%
actually not be charged for the
 
06:56:41.350 --> 06:56:41.360 align:start position:0%
transmission tariff or rate for such
 
06:56:43.510 --> 06:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
sales if transmission facilities or
 
06:56:45.990 --> 06:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
capacity under federal jurisdiction are
 
06:56:48.310 --> 06:56:48.320 align:start position:0%
not used or needed for the transaction
 
06:56:49.590 --> 06:56:49.600 align:start position:0%
that that
 
06:56:52.070 --> 06:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
law legal structure is a bit archaic in
 
06:56:54.150 --> 06:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
terms of all the requirements so these
 
06:56:56.628 --> 06:56:56.638 align:start position:0%
um bills are trying to move and reform
 
06:56:58.948 --> 06:56:58.958 align:start position:0%
that and as representative mcgee pointed
 
06:57:01.910 --> 06:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
out um the chairman of this committee uh
 
06:57:04.390 --> 06:57:04.400 align:start position:0%
chair chaired also the
 
06:57:06.230 --> 06:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
commission to study limited electrical
 
06:57:09.430 --> 06:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
producers um which as he discovered you
 
06:57:11.110 --> 06:57:11.120 align:start position:0%
know this is not there are a lot of
 
06:57:14.708 --> 06:57:14.718 align:start position:0%
complexities to this issue um and i i
 
06:57:17.590 --> 06:57:17.600 align:start position:0%
did print the copy of that report and uh
 
06:57:19.110 --> 06:57:19.120 align:start position:0%
the appendices which which are the
 
06:57:20.468 --> 06:57:20.478 align:start position:0%
submissions written submissions that
 
06:57:22.310 --> 06:57:22.320 align:start position:0%
were provided to the committee it's also
 
06:57:23.590 --> 06:57:23.600 align:start position:0%
available online through the general
 
06:57:25.110 --> 06:57:25.120 align:start position:0%
court website and you can access
 
06:57:26.868 --> 06:57:26.878 align:start position:0%
hyperlinks there but i know sometimes
 
06:57:29.030 --> 06:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
it's nice to just have the paper copies
 
06:57:30.948 --> 06:57:30.958 align:start position:0%
i'll just go ahead and and hand those
 
06:57:33.190 --> 06:57:33.200 align:start position:0%
out and and be re available for
 
06:57:35.910 --> 06:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
questions i do think that you know this
 
06:57:37.910 --> 06:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
bill might be appropriate to think of
 
06:57:40.310 --> 06:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
this as a sort of a preview of what's to
 
06:57:42.628 --> 06:57:42.638 align:start position:0%
come um perhaps from the senate bill
 
06:57:44.390 --> 06:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
because i do think the senate bill is
 
06:57:46.468 --> 06:57:46.478 align:start position:0%
more fully informed by the work of the
 
06:57:48.070 --> 06:57:48.080 align:start position:0%
study commission and there's some
 
06:57:50.468 --> 06:57:50.478 align:start position:0%
aspects of this bill while maybe an
 
06:57:51.910 --> 06:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
improvement over what was being
 
06:57:53.830 --> 06:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
considered last spring as part of senate
 
06:57:57.990 --> 06:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
bill 91 you know kind of um
 
06:57:59.670 --> 06:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
didn't really you know there's still
 
06:58:02.468 --> 06:58:02.478 align:start position:0%
issues with the bill as introduced um
 
06:58:04.788 --> 06:58:04.798 align:start position:0%
that could be thought about but um
 
06:58:06.310 --> 06:58:06.320 align:start position:0%
this will provide you some background
 
06:58:07.910 --> 06:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps to prepare for the senate bill
 
06:58:09.110 --> 06:58:09.120 align:start position:0%
to come over where you might have more
 
06:58:19.190 --> 06:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:23.030 --> 06:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:25.350 --> 06:58:25.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for providing those that hard
 
06:58:36.830 --> 06:58:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:39.990 --> 06:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
that go ahead mr representative
 
06:58:46.070 --> 06:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:47.990 --> 06:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
now let's let's hold the questions until
 
06:58:50.310 --> 06:58:50.320 align:start position:0%
uh i'm done oh you're done
 
06:58:52.708 --> 06:58:52.718 align:start position:0%
i just figure i don't need to get into
 
06:58:55.030 --> 06:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
the details at this point because
 
06:58:57.590 --> 06:58:57.600 align:start position:0%
um i think people want to read you know
 
06:58:59.270 --> 06:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
want to read the report before you start
 
06:59:01.510 --> 06:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
discussing this in depth
 
06:59:03.110 --> 06:59:03.120 align:start position:0%
okay representative harrington has a
 
06:59:03.120 --> 06:59:04.788 align:start position:0%
okay representative harrington has a
question

06:59:04.788 --> 06:59:04.798 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:59:06.468 --> 06:59:06.478 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman let me take my
 
06:59:08.150 --> 06:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
question i'm just trying to figure out a
 
06:59:10.390 --> 06:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
little bit more of this on page one
 
06:59:12.548 --> 06:59:12.558 align:start position:0%
on line 20. it talks about a limited
 
06:59:14.708 --> 06:59:14.718 align:start position:0%
producer of electricity may sell its
 
06:59:16.628 --> 06:59:16.638 align:start position:0%
electrical energy one or more purchases
 
06:59:18.708 --> 06:59:18.718 align:start position:0%
other than the franchise utility
 
06:59:21.990 --> 06:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
and then if we go over to page two
 
06:59:23.910 --> 06:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
to line 15
 
06:59:25.510 --> 06:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
it says the department of energy should
 
06:59:27.190 --> 06:59:27.200 align:start position:0%
adopt rules to provide reasonable
 
06:59:28.948 --> 06:59:28.958 align:start position:0%
customer protection for all
 
06:59:31.190 --> 06:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
retail sales of electricity from limited
 
06:59:32.548 --> 06:59:32.558 align:start position:0%
producers which may include the
 
06:59:33.990 --> 06:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
requirement for prior review and
 
06:59:36.150 --> 06:59:36.160 align:start position:0%
approval of such contracts before they
 
06:59:37.510 --> 06:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
go into effect
 
06:59:39.750 --> 06:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
it sounds as if
 
06:59:41.590 --> 06:59:41.600 align:start position:0%
on page one you're talking about a
 
06:59:41.600 --> 06:59:42.948 align:start position:0%
on page one you're talking about a
voluntary

06:59:42.948 --> 06:59:42.958 align:start position:0%
voluntary
 
06:59:45.110 --> 06:59:45.120 align:start position:0%
agreement between a limited producer and
 
06:59:47.590 --> 06:59:47.600 align:start position:0%
someone who wants to buy their product
 
06:59:49.830 --> 06:59:49.840 align:start position:0%
and then you turn around in the second
 
06:59:52.230 --> 06:59:52.240 align:start position:0%
page and say but this may require
 
06:59:53.830 --> 06:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
approval for the department of energy
 
06:59:56.468 --> 06:59:56.478 align:start position:0%
why would they be involved at all
 
06:59:56.478 --> 06:59:57.350 align:start position:0%
why would they be involved at all
um

06:59:57.350 --> 06:59:57.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:59:59.670 --> 06:59:59.680 align:start position:0%
that's a good question it's partially a
 
07:00:02.628 --> 07:00:02.638 align:start position:0%
carryover from the current statute that
 
07:00:05.510 --> 07:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
that actually calls for the commission
 
07:00:06.948 --> 07:00:06.958 align:start position:0%
to review
 
07:00:09.350 --> 07:00:09.360 align:start position:0%
each individual contract and
 
07:00:11.670 --> 07:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
and says it may disapprove any contract
 
07:00:13.430 --> 07:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
which in its judgment
 
07:00:14.948 --> 07:00:14.958 align:start position:0%
fails to protect both parties from
 
07:00:17.510 --> 07:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
excessive liability or undue risk and
 
07:00:19.030 --> 07:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
you know it says a couple more things
 
07:00:20.708 --> 07:00:20.718 align:start position:0%
you know the impact on the utility or is
 
07:00:23.190 --> 07:00:23.200 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with the public good so to
 
07:00:25.350 --> 07:00:25.360 align:start position:0%
some extent that language was to replace
 
07:00:27.510 --> 07:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
what's already in statute and sort of
 
07:00:30.070 --> 07:00:30.080 align:start position:0%
just bring it more up to date i think we
 
07:00:32.468 --> 07:00:32.478 align:start position:0%
heard i've heard in some testimony on
 
07:00:36.310 --> 07:00:36.320 align:start position:0%
related bills a concern that
 
07:00:38.708 --> 07:00:38.718 align:start position:0%
that's that residential or even small
 
07:00:41.430 --> 07:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
business customers might not realize
 
07:00:43.510 --> 07:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
what they're getting into so that maybe
 
07:00:46.468 --> 07:00:46.478 align:start position:0%
there should be some review of this
 
07:00:49.750 --> 07:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
i i know i think that's a ways off if
 
07:00:51.590 --> 07:00:51.600 align:start position:0%
this does become enabled i think it's
 
07:00:54.070 --> 07:00:54.080 align:start position:0%
some years off before small
 
07:00:55.990 --> 07:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
customers would be entering into
 
07:00:58.390 --> 07:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
contracts but i do know from our own
 
07:01:00.548 --> 07:01:00.558 align:start position:0%
survey of businesses in the community
 
07:01:02.070 --> 07:01:02.080 align:start position:0%
that there are several
 
07:01:04.628 --> 07:01:04.638 align:start position:0%
large you know businesses that have
 
07:01:07.510 --> 07:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
full-time energy managers who procure
 
07:01:09.670 --> 07:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
power now who said they'd be very
 
07:01:11.270 --> 07:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
interested if they could enter into a
 
07:01:13.830 --> 07:01:13.840 align:start position:0%
long-term purchase power agreement with
 
07:01:16.070 --> 07:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
like a three or four megawatt local
 
07:01:19.590 --> 07:01:19.600 align:start position:0%
solar and battery storage facility uh
 
07:01:21.110 --> 07:01:21.120 align:start position:0%
they would they would like to be able to
 
07:01:22.548 --> 07:01:22.558 align:start position:0%
do that so that they can say they're
 
07:01:24.150 --> 07:01:24.160 align:start position:0%
sourcing some of their power locally
 
07:01:25.670 --> 07:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
they just don't have room on their land
 
07:01:28.070 --> 07:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
to do what they to do it themselves so
 
07:01:29.830 --> 07:01:29.840 align:start position:0%
this would be a vehicle for that i i
 
07:01:32.230 --> 07:01:32.240 align:start position:0%
don't really think a responsible party
 
07:01:34.310 --> 07:01:34.320 align:start position:0%
like that would would need to have their
 
07:01:36.868 --> 07:01:36.878 align:start position:0%
contract reviewed but but it's there
 
07:01:38.310 --> 07:01:38.320 align:start position:0%
because there was concern that that
 
07:01:40.788 --> 07:01:40.798 align:start position:0%
might be appropriate for small customers
 
07:01:40.798 --> 07:01:41.750 align:start position:0%
might be appropriate for small customers
follow-up

07:01:41.750 --> 07:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
07:01:41.760 --> 07:01:42.788 align:start position:0%
follow-up
follow-up

07:01:42.788 --> 07:01:42.798 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
07:01:45.030 --> 07:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
it's from what i'm saying then in a real
 
07:01:46.788 --> 07:01:46.798 align:start position:0%
competitive market it would be up to
 
07:01:49.110 --> 07:01:49.120 align:start position:0%
this the buyer to look at the contract
 
07:01:50.548 --> 07:01:50.558 align:start position:0%
and take care of themselves this is sort
 
07:01:52.468 --> 07:01:52.478 align:start position:0%
of like a step back to
 
07:01:55.030 --> 07:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
big brother regulation then right in in
 
07:01:56.788 --> 07:01:56.798 align:start position:0%
in the same way that the
 
07:01:59.350 --> 07:01:59.360 align:start position:0%
puc or now the doe you know has rules
 
07:02:01.030 --> 07:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
and regulations concerning competitive
 
07:02:03.750 --> 07:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
suppliers and what they have to disclose
 
07:02:05.350 --> 07:02:05.360 align:start position:0%
as their terms particularly for
 
07:02:07.110 --> 07:02:07.120 align:start position:0%
residential customers so that they
 
07:02:08.948 --> 07:02:08.958 align:start position:0%
they're not kind of abused right thank
 
07:02:08.958 --> 07:02:10.868 align:start position:0%
they're not kind of abused right thank
you

07:02:10.868 --> 07:02:10.878 align:start position:0%
you
 
07:02:15.030 --> 07:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:17.670 --> 07:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
unless the same one i asked earlier
 
07:02:19.030 --> 07:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
under this bill
 
07:02:21.750 --> 07:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
i'll reverse the polarity somebody could
 
07:02:24.548 --> 07:02:24.558 align:start position:0%
generate something in colebrook and sell
 
07:02:26.788 --> 07:02:26.798 align:start position:0%
it in nashua is that correct and how
 
07:02:29.350 --> 07:02:29.360 align:start position:0%
does that avoid transmission um the only
 
07:02:31.830 --> 07:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
way you avoid transmission charges
 
07:02:33.670 --> 07:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
is and and that's what the bill provides
 
07:02:35.830 --> 07:02:35.840 align:start position:0%
for only if there's actual reduction of
 
07:02:38.150 --> 07:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
actual transmission charges is by
 
07:02:41.190 --> 07:02:41.200 align:start position:0%
reducing the load on the transmission
 
07:02:43.510 --> 07:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
system at the hour of coincident peak
 
07:02:46.390 --> 07:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
demand um
 
07:02:48.468 --> 07:02:48.478 align:start position:0%
the highest hour of demand for each in
 
07:02:51.910 --> 07:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
each month um the the
 
07:02:53.910 --> 07:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
transmission cost whether it's for the
 
07:02:55.670 --> 07:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
regional network service or what's
 
07:02:57.830 --> 07:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
called local network service which is
 
07:03:01.830 --> 07:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
which is still um crosses state lines
 
07:03:04.548 --> 07:03:04.558 align:start position:0%
those costs are allocated to
 
07:03:04.558 --> 07:03:05.830 align:start position:0%
those costs are allocated to
um

07:03:05.830 --> 07:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:03:08.628 --> 07:03:08.638 align:start position:0%
in theory under the iso new england
 
07:03:11.430 --> 07:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
tariff to to the um load serving
 
07:03:13.510 --> 07:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
entities but in new hampshire instead of
 
07:03:15.350 --> 07:03:15.360 align:start position:0%
doing that it's it's allocated to the
 
07:03:17.750 --> 07:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
distribution utilities but it's based on
 
07:03:19.910 --> 07:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
their share coincident peak essentially
 
07:03:22.230 --> 07:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
either measured or estimated at the
 
07:03:23.830 --> 07:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
interface of the transmission grid in
 
07:03:25.830 --> 07:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
the distribution grid so if you're
 
07:03:27.910 --> 07:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
producing power and colebrook and it
 
07:03:31.670 --> 07:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
actually reduced the coincident peak on
 
07:03:33.190 --> 07:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
wherever it interconnects to the
 
07:03:36.230 --> 07:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
transmission grid then it would produce
 
07:03:38.468 --> 07:03:38.478 align:start position:0%
a reduced transmission charge and that
 
07:03:40.150 --> 07:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
would be where there's credit
 
07:03:42.788 --> 07:03:42.798 align:start position:0%
out all other hours of the month
 
07:03:45.030 --> 07:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
there's no charge
 
07:03:47.110 --> 07:03:47.120 align:start position:0%
um either cost or savings with regard to
 
07:03:47.120 --> 07:03:48.310 align:start position:0%
um either cost or savings with regard to
transmission

07:03:48.310 --> 07:03:48.320 align:start position:0%
transmission
 
07:03:51.670 --> 07:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
and as long as the off taker is within
 
07:03:53.990 --> 07:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
the same state it's still a state
 
07:03:57.190 --> 07:03:57.200 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional transaction um and kind
 
07:03:58.788 --> 07:03:58.798 align:start position:0%
of going to the question of how does the
 
07:04:01.270 --> 07:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
credit work now in liberty utilities for
 
07:04:03.830 --> 07:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
instance they justified a
 
07:04:07.190 --> 07:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
utility sponsored battery pilot program
 
07:04:10.070 --> 07:04:10.080 align:start position:0%
um in their investment of it um
 
07:04:12.150 --> 07:04:12.160 align:start position:0%
and being able to put it in rate based
 
07:04:15.110 --> 07:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
based on the trends avoided transmission
 
07:04:19.190 --> 07:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
cost and capacity cost primarily
 
07:04:22.468 --> 07:04:22.478 align:start position:0%
and they simply said what they measure
 
07:04:23.830 --> 07:04:23.840 align:start position:0%
through interval meters what the
 
07:04:27.030 --> 07:04:27.040 align:start position:0%
batteries produce onto the grid at the
 
07:04:29.190 --> 07:04:29.200 align:start position:0%
time of the hourly monthly peak they try
 
07:04:31.350 --> 07:04:31.360 align:start position:0%
to manage them so that they dispatch
 
07:04:33.430 --> 07:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
them at those hours of coincident peak
 
07:04:35.750 --> 07:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
and if they measure a reduction in in
 
07:04:37.270 --> 07:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
07:04:39.510 --> 07:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
then they're giving credit for it in in
 
07:04:42.468 --> 07:04:42.478 align:start position:0%
the formula by which they justify it it
 
07:04:44.708 --> 07:04:44.718 align:start position:0%
is being added to rate base because it
 
07:04:46.948 --> 07:04:46.958 align:start position:0%
produces a lower transmission charges
 
07:04:49.030 --> 07:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
and a lower overall capacity take for
 
07:04:50.628 --> 07:04:50.638 align:start position:0%
liberty customers
 
07:04:52.548 --> 07:04:52.558 align:start position:0%
so this is just trying to say let the
 
07:04:54.708 --> 07:04:54.718 align:start position:0%
competitive market be able to compete
 
07:04:58.548 --> 07:04:58.558 align:start position:0%
with that kind of regulatory scheme
 
07:04:58.558 --> 07:04:59.350 align:start position:0%
with that kind of regulatory scheme
and

07:04:59.350 --> 07:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:05:01.590 --> 07:05:01.600 align:start position:0%
and this is also happening with
 
07:05:03.350 --> 07:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
you know the utilities in other states
 
07:05:05.830 --> 07:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
in new england as well using avoided
 
07:05:08.230 --> 07:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
transmission and capacity cost as as
 
07:05:10.628 --> 07:05:10.638 align:start position:0%
part of the financial justification
 
07:05:12.468 --> 07:05:12.478 align:start position:0%
for these programs
 
07:05:13.910 --> 07:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
07:05:15.590 --> 07:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
07:05:17.750 --> 07:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
if i were a utility
 
07:05:19.830 --> 07:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
billing system manager
 
07:05:21.430 --> 07:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
with something like that i'd be pulling
 
07:05:24.150 --> 07:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
my hair out is how do you keep track of
 
07:05:26.390 --> 07:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
the generation in one place and the
 
07:05:27.990 --> 07:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
credits in another place and make sure
 
07:05:30.070 --> 07:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
that the generation matches up with the
 
07:05:30.080 --> 07:05:31.270 align:start position:0%
that the generation matches up with the
credits

07:05:31.270 --> 07:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
credits
 
07:05:33.750 --> 07:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
and that's an added cost to the utility
 
07:05:35.270 --> 07:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
that i don't see being picked up by
 
07:05:37.430 --> 07:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
anybody in this bill well the utility
 
07:05:38.868 --> 07:05:38.878 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to do that accounting the
 
07:05:40.948 --> 07:05:40.958 align:start position:0%
bill uh calls for the load serving
 
07:05:43.350 --> 07:05:43.360 align:start position:0%
entity to um take care of that
 
07:05:45.910 --> 07:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
the the load serving entity would have
 
07:05:48.150 --> 07:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
to be the same entity for both the off
 
07:05:49.990 --> 07:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
takers and the supplier
 
07:05:51.670 --> 07:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
unless they made arrangements with other
 
07:05:53.510 --> 07:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
load-serving entities where they could
 
07:05:55.990 --> 07:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
you know kind of commingle um
 
07:05:59.030 --> 07:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh but um that that what what they do
 
07:06:01.590 --> 07:06:01.600 align:start position:0%
now and what they're required to do by
 
07:06:03.830 --> 07:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
law now i'll just take the net metering
 
07:06:06.230 --> 07:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
example if if you've got a net metered
 
07:06:09.830 --> 07:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
customer who's on competitive supply or
 
07:06:09.840 --> 07:06:10.788 align:start position:0%
customer who's on competitive supply or
um

07:06:10.788 --> 07:06:10.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:06:12.548 --> 07:06:12.558 align:start position:0%
with a with a municipal aggregation
 
07:06:14.548 --> 07:06:14.558 align:start position:0%
although none exists yet
 
07:06:16.708 --> 07:06:16.718 align:start position:0%
then the law currently requires the
 
07:06:19.030 --> 07:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
utility to take the negative exports to
 
07:06:21.270 --> 07:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
the grid for each hour if if they're
 
07:06:23.590 --> 07:06:23.600 align:start position:0%
measured and use those or even if
 
07:06:25.830 --> 07:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
they're not if they're estimated and use
 
07:06:28.628 --> 07:06:28.638 align:start position:0%
those to offset the power supply to
 
07:06:30.150 --> 07:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
customers of the same load serving
 
07:06:32.310 --> 07:06:32.320 align:start position:0%
entity so that the load serving entity
 
07:06:35.110 --> 07:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
pays for the net cost
 
07:06:35.120 --> 07:06:35.910 align:start position:0%
pays for the net cost
um

07:06:35.910 --> 07:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:06:38.310 --> 07:06:38.320 align:start position:0%
and that that so they're currently doing
 
07:06:40.230 --> 07:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
that accounting with regard to net meter
 
07:06:42.310 --> 07:06:42.320 align:start position:0%
facilities i might add eversource in
 
07:06:44.468 --> 07:06:44.478 align:start position:0%
particular their western mass utility
 
07:06:46.708 --> 07:06:46.718 align:start position:0%
which apparently uses the same billing
 
07:06:48.788 --> 07:06:48.798 align:start position:0%
system as their new hampshire public
 
07:06:50.708 --> 07:06:50.718 align:start position:0%
service of new hampshire they actually
 
07:06:53.270 --> 07:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
have this functionality already for
 
07:06:55.190 --> 07:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
transmission charges because some of
 
07:06:58.070 --> 07:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
their large industrial customers are
 
07:06:58.080 --> 07:06:59.830 align:start position:0%
their large industrial customers are
charged

07:06:59.830 --> 07:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
charged
 
07:07:02.070 --> 07:07:02.080 align:start position:0%
transmission charges directly not as
 
07:07:04.390 --> 07:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
part of a distribution utility charge
 
07:07:06.628 --> 07:07:06.638 align:start position:0%
and they actually do measure for those
 
07:07:08.708 --> 07:07:08.718 align:start position:0%
large customers in their current metered
 
07:07:11.110 --> 07:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
data system and their billing system
 
07:07:14.310 --> 07:07:14.320 align:start position:0%
when those customers are
 
07:07:16.390 --> 07:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
what their load is at the system
 
07:07:18.628 --> 07:07:18.638 align:start position:0%
coincident peaks in which transmission
 
07:07:20.788 --> 07:07:20.798 align:start position:0%
charges are allocated and then they pass
 
07:07:23.350 --> 07:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
those isola england charges over to
 
07:07:26.390 --> 07:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
their customers um
 
07:07:26.400 --> 07:07:27.110 align:start position:0%
their customers um
and

07:07:27.110 --> 07:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:07:28.948 --> 07:07:28.958 align:start position:0%
so so it's basically the same
 
07:07:30.788 --> 07:07:30.798 align:start position:0%
functionality that already exists at
 
07:07:32.868 --> 07:07:32.878 align:start position:0%
least in the eversource system in
 
07:07:37.510 --> 07:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:39.590 --> 07:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
07:07:41.350 --> 07:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
so you've heard me ask this question
 
07:07:44.868 --> 07:07:44.878 align:start position:0%
before i'll ask it again
 
07:07:47.430 --> 07:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
line 20 on page two
 
07:07:49.270 --> 07:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
the limited producer shall receive
 
07:07:51.590 --> 07:07:51.600 align:start position:0%
credit for actual avoided transmission
 
07:07:51.600 --> 07:07:53.830 align:start position:0%
credit for actual avoided transmission
charges

07:07:53.830 --> 07:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
charges
 
07:07:53.840 --> 07:07:56.948 align:start position:0%
charges
describe

07:07:56.948 --> 07:07:56.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:58.628 --> 07:07:58.638 align:start position:0%
how those credits
 
07:07:58.638 --> 07:08:00.150 align:start position:0%
how those credits
work

07:08:00.150 --> 07:08:00.160 align:start position:0%
work
 
07:08:02.390 --> 07:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
and the information you just revealed
 
07:08:04.548 --> 07:08:04.558 align:start position:0%
about the eversource uh
 
07:08:06.788 --> 07:08:06.798 align:start position:0%
system in massachusetts uh seems to
 
07:08:09.830 --> 07:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
maybe offer a clue there um describe how
 
07:08:11.270 --> 07:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
it could work
 
07:08:11.280 --> 07:08:12.468 align:start position:0%
it could work
and

07:08:12.468 --> 07:08:12.478 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:08:13.990 --> 07:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
tell us whether
 
07:08:16.868 --> 07:08:16.878 align:start position:0%
it would impose any charges whatsoever
 
07:08:16.878 --> 07:08:18.230 align:start position:0%
it would impose any charges whatsoever
on

07:08:18.230 --> 07:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
on
 
07:08:18.240 --> 07:08:20.310 align:start position:0%
on
non-limited

07:08:20.310 --> 07:08:20.320 align:start position:0%
non-limited
 
07:08:25.190 --> 07:08:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:28.628 --> 07:08:28.638 align:start position:0%
okay um well let's say take a
 
07:08:30.548 --> 07:08:30.558 align:start position:0%
hypothetical there's there's a limited
 
07:08:32.310 --> 07:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
producer of some sort
 
07:08:35.670 --> 07:08:35.680 align:start position:0%
that produces one megawatt of power
 
07:08:37.990 --> 07:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
at the monthly system peak
 
07:08:41.190 --> 07:08:41.200 align:start position:0%
um that will in liberty the co-op in
 
07:08:44.230 --> 07:08:44.240 align:start position:0%
unitil's case actually results in a
 
07:08:46.830 --> 07:08:46.840 align:start position:0%
little more than one megawatt maybe
 
07:08:46.840 --> 07:08:48.708 align:start position:0%
little more than one megawatt maybe
1.06

07:08:48.708 --> 07:08:48.718 align:start position:0%
1.06
 
07:08:51.670 --> 07:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
megawatts of reduced load at the meter
 
07:08:53.190 --> 07:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
point where the transmission grid
 
07:08:55.830 --> 07:08:55.840 align:start position:0%
interfaces with the distribution grid so
 
07:08:57.750 --> 07:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
if at that point say there's typically a
 
07:08:59.990 --> 07:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
20 megawatt load and you've got a
 
07:09:02.310 --> 07:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
limited producer that puts a megawatt
 
07:09:05.190 --> 07:09:05.200 align:start position:0%
onto the grid you'll actually measure 19
 
07:09:07.990 --> 07:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
megawatts at that hour of a system
 
07:09:09.990 --> 07:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
coincident peak and they'll be charged
 
07:09:12.310 --> 07:09:12.320 align:start position:0%
based on 19 megawatts times whatever the
 
07:09:14.628 --> 07:09:14.638 align:start position:0%
rate is uh for the month the whole month
 
07:09:17.030 --> 07:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
rate is embedded in that single hour
 
07:09:17.040 --> 07:09:17.830 align:start position:0%
rate is embedded in that single hour
um

07:09:17.830 --> 07:09:17.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:09:17.840 --> 07:09:18.948 align:start position:0%
um
so

07:09:18.948 --> 07:09:18.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:09:21.830 --> 07:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
in in the sort of simple math formula is
 
07:09:24.150 --> 07:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
but for this particular limited producer
 
07:09:25.990 --> 07:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
and what they put out at that hour of
 
07:09:28.310 --> 07:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
system peak um the charge would have
 
07:09:30.868 --> 07:09:30.878 align:start position:0%
been for 20 megawatts plus the line
 
07:09:33.510 --> 07:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
losses so you've got the rate so you
 
07:09:35.110 --> 07:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
just look at okay what's the delta it
 
07:09:37.510 --> 07:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
put one megawatt on at you know times
 
07:09:39.430 --> 07:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
that rate that's the credit they get
 
07:09:40.548 --> 07:09:40.558 align:start position:0%
because that's what we would have paid
 
07:09:42.628 --> 07:09:42.638 align:start position:0%
otherwise to get that power delivered
 
07:09:44.310 --> 07:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
over the transmission grid at the
 
07:09:46.868 --> 07:09:46.878 align:start position:0%
monthly system peak the the reverse way
 
07:09:48.390 --> 07:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
to think about this and i think this is
 
07:09:52.070 --> 07:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
one of the things that senate bill 321
 
07:09:53.910 --> 07:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
tries to offer as an alternative way of
 
07:09:55.990 --> 07:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
thinking of this which which is already
 
07:09:58.390 --> 07:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
reflected in in the transmission tariffs
 
07:10:00.310 --> 07:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
and isa new england
 
07:10:03.110 --> 07:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
policy is that the transmission charges
 
07:10:05.030 --> 07:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
could be directly allocated to the load
 
07:10:07.590 --> 07:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
serving entity rather than to the
 
07:10:10.868 --> 07:10:10.878 align:start position:0%
distribution utility and and so in that
 
07:10:12.788 --> 07:10:12.798 align:start position:0%
and several state tariffs actually
 
07:10:14.788 --> 07:10:14.798 align:start position:0%
provide for that national grids tariffs
 
07:10:17.110 --> 07:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
actually spell that out as an option i'm
 
07:10:18.788 --> 07:10:18.798 align:start position:0%
not sure it's actually been implemented
 
07:10:20.628 --> 07:10:20.638 align:start position:0%
in new england it is the way it works in
 
07:10:21.750 --> 07:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
some other
 
07:10:24.868 --> 07:10:24.878 align:start position:0%
areas i think in pjm uh they they pass
 
07:10:26.708 --> 07:10:26.718 align:start position:0%
transmission through to the load serving
 
07:10:28.708 --> 07:10:28.718 align:start position:0%
entity so let's just say there's a
 
07:10:31.030 --> 07:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
competitive electric supplier
 
07:10:32.390 --> 07:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
limited producer
 
07:10:34.708 --> 07:10:34.718 align:start position:0%
and normally they've got a 14 you know
 
07:10:36.628 --> 07:10:36.638 align:start position:0%
they'd have a 14 megawatt load from all
 
07:10:38.230 --> 07:10:38.240 align:start position:0%
their customers that are taking power
 
07:10:40.788 --> 07:10:40.798 align:start position:0%
but they got one megawatt being put onto
 
07:10:42.948 --> 07:10:42.958 align:start position:0%
the grid from one of their customer
 
07:10:44.468 --> 07:10:44.478 align:start position:0%
generators or i should say limited
 
07:10:46.788 --> 07:10:46.798 align:start position:0%
producers uh that sort of part of their
 
07:10:50.070 --> 07:10:50.080 align:start position:0%
portfolio uh then they would um
 
07:10:51.990 --> 07:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
be only charged for 13
 
07:10:54.628 --> 07:10:54.638 align:start position:0%
13 megawatts um because that that was
 
07:10:56.948 --> 07:10:56.958 align:start position:0%
their measured load the the the
 
07:10:58.708 --> 07:10:58.718 align:start position:0%
utilities already
 
07:11:01.430 --> 07:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
their hourly loads are
 
07:11:03.590 --> 07:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
and that's supposed to be net of exports
 
07:11:06.310 --> 07:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
to the grid by net meter generators um
 
07:11:07.990 --> 07:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
but it will you know you'd treat these
 
07:11:09.910 --> 07:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
in the same way
 
07:11:11.750 --> 07:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
so so they're already making those
 
07:11:13.910 --> 07:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
calculations for the load serving entity
 
07:11:15.830 --> 07:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
and if you just allocated transmission
 
07:11:18.628 --> 07:11:18.638 align:start position:0%
on the same basis then then that load
 
07:11:20.468 --> 07:11:20.478 align:start position:0%
serving entity could decide whether they
 
07:11:22.788 --> 07:11:22.798 align:start position:0%
give that where they charge everyone as
 
07:11:24.468 --> 07:11:24.478 align:start position:0%
if they bought 14 megawatts of
 
07:11:26.628 --> 07:11:26.638 align:start position:0%
transmission service at that coincident
 
07:11:29.590 --> 07:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
peak or whether they charge um um and
 
07:11:31.270 --> 07:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
give the the one megawatt credit to the
 
07:11:33.910 --> 07:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
producer or if they don't give the
 
07:11:35.590 --> 07:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
credit to the producer but they lower
 
07:11:38.628 --> 07:11:38.638 align:start position:0%
everyone else's charge um up as you know
 
07:11:39.750 --> 07:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
because they're only being charged for
 
07:11:41.990 --> 07:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
13 megawatts even though their customers
 
07:11:44.230 --> 07:11:44.240 align:start position:0%
consume 14 megawatts so it just depends
 
07:11:46.230 --> 07:11:46.240 align:start position:0%
on how they chose to do it but again
 
07:11:48.230 --> 07:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
that leaves it to sort of the market to
 
07:11:50.230 --> 07:11:50.240 align:start position:0%
decide actually how to structure those
 
07:11:50.240 --> 07:11:51.750 align:start position:0%
decide actually how to structure those
details

07:11:51.750 --> 07:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
details
 
07:11:53.350 --> 07:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
and now you know why i didn't answer
 
07:11:53.360 --> 07:11:57.910 align:start position:0%
and now you know why i didn't answer
that

07:11:57.910 --> 07:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:00.310 --> 07:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
so would it be correct then to to think
 
07:12:03.190 --> 07:12:03.200 align:start position:0%
of these credits as really just being
 
07:12:06.070 --> 07:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
lower rates yes for transmission so
 
07:12:08.548 --> 07:12:08.558 align:start position:0%
there there isn't really a credit in
 
07:12:10.390 --> 07:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
this in the sense of
 
07:12:12.788 --> 07:12:12.798 align:start position:0%
like a net metering credit it's just
 
07:12:12.798 --> 07:12:13.670 align:start position:0%
like a net metering credit it's just
that

07:12:13.670 --> 07:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:12:16.868 --> 07:12:16.878 align:start position:0%
the transmission rate charged would be a
 
07:12:18.868 --> 07:12:18.878 align:start position:0%
lower rate
 
07:12:20.390 --> 07:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
based on
 
07:12:20.400 --> 07:12:21.190 align:start position:0%
based on
the

07:12:21.190 --> 07:12:21.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:12:21.200 --> 07:12:22.310 align:start position:0%
the
uh

07:12:22.310 --> 07:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:12:25.190 --> 07:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
coincident peak
 
07:12:27.030 --> 07:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
determination right of what the rate
 
07:12:28.708 --> 07:12:28.718 align:start position:0%
should be right
 
07:12:30.868 --> 07:12:30.878 align:start position:0%
exactly and and so why do we use the
 
07:12:33.110 --> 07:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
word credit in the in the legislation
 
07:12:33.120 --> 07:12:33.990 align:start position:0%
word credit in the in the legislation
well

07:12:33.990 --> 07:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
well
 
07:12:35.750 --> 07:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
because um
 
07:12:37.350 --> 07:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
that that's another way to do it i mean
 
07:12:39.190 --> 07:12:39.200 align:start position:0%
that's what's happening in net metering
 
07:12:41.110 --> 07:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
now if you're under if you're up to
 
07:12:44.708 --> 07:12:44.718 align:start position:0%
100kw you get a credit when you export
 
07:12:46.708 --> 07:12:46.718 align:start position:0%
to the grid equal to the full
 
07:12:48.948 --> 07:12:48.958 align:start position:0%
transmission rate you know which whether
 
07:12:50.788 --> 07:12:50.798 align:start position:0%
you actually help reduce transmission
 
07:12:52.868 --> 07:12:52.878 align:start position:0%
charges or not um
 
07:12:55.110 --> 07:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
uh so but but that's that's a credit
 
07:12:56.628 --> 07:12:56.638 align:start position:0%
that's given now
 
07:12:59.830 --> 07:12:59.840 align:start position:0%
um in in net metering and and that
 
07:13:01.830 --> 07:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
that just might might be an easier way
 
07:13:03.030 --> 07:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
to do it than the other way because the
 
07:13:06.390 --> 07:13:06.400 align:start position:0%
other way would be new for new hampshire
 
07:13:08.788 --> 07:13:08.798 align:start position:0%
so but but it might you know but it's
 
07:13:11.030 --> 07:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
worth i think considering because i
 
07:13:12.548 --> 07:13:12.558 align:start position:0%
think part of the whole concept of
 
07:13:14.868 --> 07:13:14.878 align:start position:0%
restructuring was to have appropriate
 
07:13:17.510 --> 07:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
price signals that that reflected sort
 
07:13:20.390 --> 07:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
of underlying cost causation that
 
07:13:21.750 --> 07:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
would give
 
07:13:24.310 --> 07:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
both individual customers as well as
 
07:13:25.910 --> 07:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
sort of groups of customers where
 
07:13:28.868 --> 07:13:28.878 align:start position:0%
there's some some management support
 
07:13:31.990 --> 07:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
an ability to adjust their consumption
 
07:13:35.190 --> 07:13:35.200 align:start position:0%
to help minimize cost and and and this
 
07:13:37.390 --> 07:13:37.400 align:start position:0%
just tries to do the same thing you know
 
07:13:39.670 --> 07:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
representative harrington talked about
 
07:13:42.230 --> 07:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
the development in iso new england of
 
07:13:45.590 --> 07:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
sort of these demand response markets um
 
07:13:48.070 --> 07:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
which as he may recall he was working on
 
07:13:50.390 --> 07:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
that for the puc at the time the whole
 
07:13:52.150 --> 07:13:52.160 align:start position:0%
demand response was being developed i
 
07:13:54.788 --> 07:13:54.798 align:start position:0%
was a commissioner at at the time and
 
07:13:56.788 --> 07:13:56.798 align:start position:0%
and part of you know advocating for that
 
07:13:58.788 --> 07:13:58.798 align:start position:0%
to be part of the um interstate
 
07:14:01.110 --> 07:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
wholesale market but in large part only
 
07:14:02.948 --> 07:14:02.958 align:start position:0%
because we hadn't enabled it at the
 
07:14:05.110 --> 07:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
state level you know we just don't have
 
07:14:07.910 --> 07:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
the granularity of price signals at the
 
07:14:10.548 --> 07:14:10.558 align:start position:0%
at the distribution level that that
 
07:14:12.548 --> 07:14:12.558 align:start position:0%
businesses or generators could take
 
07:14:15.190 --> 07:14:15.200 align:start position:0%
advantage of the fact that if they
 
07:14:17.910 --> 07:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
produce or curtail load at particular
 
07:14:20.070 --> 07:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
hours there's there's particular value
 
07:14:21.110 --> 07:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
to that
 
07:14:23.670 --> 07:14:23.680 align:start position:0%
in terms of capacity if you're helping
 
07:14:26.468 --> 07:14:26.478 align:start position:0%
meet the peak demand then then the idea
 
07:14:28.468 --> 07:14:28.478 align:start position:0%
was here's a way to get credit for it
 
07:14:31.110 --> 07:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
but in doing so you sort of are forced
 
07:14:33.110 --> 07:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
to into a
 
07:14:35.830 --> 07:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
engineering or physics fiction which is
 
07:14:38.230 --> 07:14:38.240 align:start position:0%
the notion that a small generator that's
 
07:14:40.310 --> 07:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
offsetting load on the distribution grid
 
07:14:42.150 --> 07:14:42.160 align:start position:0%
actually sells up into a central
 
07:14:44.548 --> 07:14:44.558 align:start position:0%
clearinghouse you know out of state and
 
07:14:46.070 --> 07:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
resells the power back over the
 
07:14:47.830 --> 07:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
transmission grid so that's why they
 
07:14:49.430 --> 07:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
don't get credit for transmission
 
07:14:51.110 --> 07:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
because they're because they're part of
 
07:14:52.230 --> 07:14:52.240 align:start position:0%
the um
 
07:14:54.948 --> 07:14:54.958 align:start position:0%
regional market and and this bill says
 
07:14:56.948 --> 07:14:56.958 align:start position:0%
you can do one or the other you could
 
07:14:59.190 --> 07:14:59.200 align:start position:0%
participate in those programs in the
 
07:15:01.510 --> 07:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
interstate wholesale market or here's a
 
07:15:03.590 --> 07:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
way to do it locally on the distribution
 
07:15:05.430 --> 07:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
system and sort of get the same kind of
 
07:15:07.910 --> 07:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
price signals
 
07:15:07.920 --> 07:15:08.868 align:start position:0%
price signals
excellent

07:15:08.868 --> 07:15:08.878 align:start position:0%
excellent
 
07:15:11.270 --> 07:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
additional questions for
 
07:15:14.070 --> 07:15:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:16.390 --> 07:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for
 
07:15:18.150 --> 07:15:18.160 align:start position:0%
checking down here and i thank you for
 
07:15:21.270 --> 07:15:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:23.430 --> 07:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
study committee report hard copy for
 
07:15:25.830 --> 07:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
everyone thank you appreciate that all
 
07:15:27.190 --> 07:15:27.200 align:start position:0%
right we've got a couple more people who
 
07:15:29.750 --> 07:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
would like to testify including our
 
07:15:31.830 --> 07:15:31.840 align:start position:0%
good friend griffin roberge from the
 
07:15:48.628 --> 07:15:48.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:50.628 --> 07:15:50.638 align:start position:0%
good afternoon committee members uh for
 
07:15:53.030 --> 07:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
the record uh griffin roberts from the
 
07:15:54.708 --> 07:15:54.718 align:start position:0%
department of energy i have alongside me
 
07:15:57.270 --> 07:15:57.280 align:start position:0%
today david wiesner from the department
 
07:15:58.390 --> 07:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
as well
 
07:16:01.990 --> 07:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh legal counsel for the department um
 
07:16:04.708 --> 07:16:04.718 align:start position:0%
the department is neutral on this bill
 
07:16:06.230 --> 07:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
but we just wanted to
 
07:16:07.750 --> 07:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
express a few observations a few
 
07:16:10.708 --> 07:16:10.718 align:start position:0%
concerns um obviously as you
 
07:16:12.150 --> 07:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
already have and i do have coffees if
 
07:16:14.070 --> 07:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
needed but you should have a copy of the
 
07:16:16.150 --> 07:16:16.160 align:start position:0%
uh final report that was issued by the
 
07:16:18.070 --> 07:16:18.080 align:start position:0%
senate bill 91 study commission or the
 
07:16:19.910 --> 07:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
lepa study commission
 
07:16:19.920 --> 07:16:20.868 align:start position:0%
lepa study commission
um

07:16:20.868 --> 07:16:20.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:16:23.350 --> 07:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
as you'll identify on the report there
 
07:16:25.590 --> 07:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
were significant amount of complexities
 
07:16:27.430 --> 07:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
uncertainties and potential risks
 
07:16:29.590 --> 07:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
associated with the proposal to expand
 
07:16:32.230 --> 07:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
lipa retail sales
 
07:16:34.708 --> 07:16:34.718 align:start position:0%
and provide avoided transmission charge
 
07:16:37.030 --> 07:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
credits to participants in those
 
07:16:40.628 --> 07:16:40.638 align:start position:0%
transactions um the report had warned of
 
07:16:42.070 --> 07:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences and the
 
07:16:43.910 --> 07:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
potential for cost shifting from one
 
07:16:46.468 --> 07:16:46.478 align:start position:0%
class of electricity customer to another
 
07:16:46.478 --> 07:16:47.510 align:start position:0%
class of electricity customer to another
um

07:16:47.510 --> 07:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:16:48.708 --> 07:16:48.718 align:start position:0%
you'll note in the report that it
 
07:16:51.590 --> 07:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
concluded a wide range of recommended
 
07:16:54.388 --> 07:16:54.398 align:start position:0%
next steps all of which largely aimed on
 
07:16:57.030 --> 07:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
further study of the many complexity of
 
07:16:58.310 --> 07:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
these complex issues that were
 
07:17:00.310 --> 07:17:00.320 align:start position:0%
identified in the report whether by the
 
07:17:02.788 --> 07:17:02.798 align:start position:0%
legislature the department of energy or
 
07:17:05.670 --> 07:17:05.680 align:start position:0%
through a limited type of pilot program
 
07:17:07.990 --> 07:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
that would likely be approved by the
 
07:17:10.230 --> 07:17:10.240 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission
 
07:17:11.910 --> 07:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
none of the study committee's
 
07:17:14.150 --> 07:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
commission's recommendations involved in
 
07:17:16.868 --> 07:17:16.878 align:start position:0%
implementation through rulemaking by doe
 
07:17:18.628 --> 07:17:18.638 align:start position:0%
so in that regard this bill might be a
 
07:17:20.948 --> 07:17:20.958 align:start position:0%
little bit premature
 
07:17:23.190 --> 07:17:23.200 align:start position:0%
among the complex issues that would
 
07:17:24.788 --> 07:17:24.798 align:start position:0%
benefit from further clarification are
 
07:17:27.910 --> 07:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
the types and costs of necessary utility
 
07:17:30.070 --> 07:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
metering and system upgrades needed to
 
07:17:32.310 --> 07:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
facilitate these type of these types of
 
07:17:34.548 --> 07:17:34.558 align:start position:0%
lipa transactions and the allocations of
 
07:17:36.628 --> 07:17:36.638 align:start position:0%
those costs for recovery
 
07:17:38.628 --> 07:17:38.638 align:start position:0%
so for example should only customers
 
07:17:39.990 --> 07:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
participating in the covered
 
07:17:41.990 --> 07:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
transactions pay these costs or should
 
07:17:43.510 --> 07:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
they be covered by all the utility
 
07:17:45.990 --> 07:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
customers or should the cost be split in
 
07:17:48.150 --> 07:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
some way
 
07:17:49.910 --> 07:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
the role of competitive electric power
 
07:17:53.190 --> 07:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
suppliers and utility default energy uh
 
07:17:55.990 --> 07:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
service providers is also unclear
 
07:17:57.590 --> 07:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
those suppliers might need to provide
 
07:17:59.750 --> 07:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
backup or supplementary service if and
 
07:18:01.830 --> 07:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
when limited power producers many of
 
07:18:04.070 --> 07:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
which are intermittent generation
 
07:18:06.788 --> 07:18:06.798 align:start position:0%
resources uh may not be able to serve
 
07:18:09.110 --> 07:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
all the retail customers electricity
 
07:18:09.120 --> 07:18:10.230 align:start position:0%
all the retail customers electricity
requirements

07:18:10.230 --> 07:18:10.240 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
07:18:14.310 --> 07:18:14.320 align:start position:0%
um limited producers may be able to
 
07:18:16.708 --> 07:18:16.718 align:start position:0%
provide electric capacity and energy to
 
07:18:18.868 --> 07:18:18.878 align:start position:0%
retail customers at certain times and
 
07:18:21.590 --> 07:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
under certain uh circumstances but it's
 
07:18:22.868 --> 07:18:22.878 align:start position:0%
unlikely they'll be able to meet a
 
07:18:25.110 --> 07:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
retail customer's full demand for such
 
07:18:26.868 --> 07:18:26.878 align:start position:0%
products nor will they be able to
 
07:18:29.430 --> 07:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
provide the full requirements um load
 
07:18:31.110 --> 07:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
following service that retail customers
 
07:18:33.750 --> 07:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
require obviously at all times
 
07:18:36.788 --> 07:18:36.798 align:start position:0%
um the balance of a retail customer's
 
07:18:36.798 --> 07:18:37.910 align:start position:0%
um the balance of a retail customer's
electric

07:18:37.910 --> 07:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
electric
 
07:18:40.070 --> 07:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
supply requirements that can't be met by
 
07:18:42.070 --> 07:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
a leaper generator again whether at
 
07:18:44.548 --> 07:18:44.558 align:start position:0%
specific times or at all times will have
 
07:18:46.310 --> 07:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
to be covered by a competitive electric
 
07:18:48.708 --> 07:18:48.718 align:start position:0%
supplier or by the utility default
 
07:18:50.388 --> 07:18:50.398 align:start position:0%
service supplier
 
07:18:51.910 --> 07:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
the potential for additional costs
 
07:18:54.150 --> 07:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
associated with that backup service will
 
07:18:56.548 --> 07:18:56.558 align:start position:0%
either be have to be assessed to the
 
07:18:58.150 --> 07:18:58.160 align:start position:0%
limited generator
 
07:19:00.310 --> 07:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
or its retail customer or they'll have
 
07:19:01.990 --> 07:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
to be recovered from other utility
 
07:19:02.000 --> 07:19:03.030 align:start position:0%
to be recovered from other utility
customers

07:19:03.030 --> 07:19:03.040 align:start position:0%
customers
 
07:19:05.350 --> 07:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
if these backup costs are assessed to
 
07:19:07.750 --> 07:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
the leaper generator or a retail
 
07:19:09.670 --> 07:19:09.680 align:start position:0%
customer then the cost of such
 
07:19:11.670 --> 07:19:11.680 align:start position:0%
transactions will be increased and their
 
07:19:14.070 --> 07:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
financial justifications will likely be
 
07:19:15.910 --> 07:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
diminished on the other hand if those
 
07:19:17.590 --> 07:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
costs are instead recovered from the
 
07:19:19.350 --> 07:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
utility customers
 
07:19:21.510 --> 07:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
you would run into the potential of cost
 
07:19:23.230 --> 07:19:23.240 align:start position:0%
shifting from participating to
 
07:19:25.670 --> 07:19:25.680 align:start position:0%
non-participating customers
 
07:19:27.590 --> 07:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
with respect to the point you raised
 
07:19:28.788 --> 07:19:28.798 align:start position:0%
chairman votes about regional
 
07:19:30.788 --> 07:19:30.798 align:start position:0%
transmission charges it is likely that
 
07:19:33.110 --> 07:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
some portion of those charges
 
07:19:35.510 --> 07:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
is avoided by the electric output of
 
07:19:37.350 --> 07:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
limited power producers that are
 
07:19:39.110 --> 07:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
interconnected to the utility
 
07:19:41.110 --> 07:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
distribution system and those avoid
 
07:19:42.948 --> 07:19:42.958 align:start position:0%
costs would tend to benefit all utility
 
07:19:45.830 --> 07:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
customers however the scope and scale of
 
07:19:47.510 --> 07:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
these avoided transmission charges and
 
07:19:49.750 --> 07:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
how much cost savings should be
 
07:19:52.868 --> 07:19:52.878 align:start position:0%
allocated remain open questions
 
07:19:55.030 --> 07:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
as i'm sure the committee is well aware
 
07:19:57.510 --> 07:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
doe is currently looking at similar
 
07:19:57.520 --> 07:19:58.708 align:start position:0%
doe is currently looking at similar
issues

07:19:58.708 --> 07:19:58.718 align:start position:0%
issues
 
07:20:00.388 --> 07:20:00.398 align:start position:0%
and the value of distributed energy
 
07:20:02.388 --> 07:20:02.398 align:start position:0%
resources study that's being conducted
 
07:20:04.788 --> 07:20:04.798 align:start position:0%
through a docket at the puc
 
07:20:06.628 --> 07:20:06.638 align:start position:0%
that study is expected to be completed
 
07:20:08.708 --> 07:20:08.718 align:start position:0%
by late spring of this year and that
 
07:20:10.868 --> 07:20:10.878 align:start position:0%
will inform you know you guys as well as
 
07:20:13.110 --> 07:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
all other stakeholders at this point
 
07:20:13.120 --> 07:20:14.150 align:start position:0%
all other stakeholders at this point
um

07:20:14.150 --> 07:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:20:16.468 --> 07:20:16.478 align:start position:0%
there's also a potential disconnect in
 
07:20:17.430 --> 07:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
07:20:20.070 --> 07:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
um i'm looking at paragraph five which i
 
07:20:22.230 --> 07:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
believe is on page two i'm looking at
 
07:20:24.388 --> 07:20:24.398 align:start position:0%
lines twenty to thirty
 
07:20:24.398 --> 07:20:25.590 align:start position:0%
lines twenty to thirty
um

07:20:25.590 --> 07:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:20:27.190 --> 07:20:27.200 align:start position:0%
it would provide that the limited
 
07:20:29.750 --> 07:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
producer shall receive credit for actual
 
07:20:32.548 --> 07:20:32.558 align:start position:0%
avoided transmission charges um but
 
07:20:35.270 --> 07:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
paragraph six thirty one two three page
 
07:20:38.468 --> 07:20:38.478 align:start position:0%
uh sorry lines 31 to 34
 
07:20:40.150 --> 07:20:40.160 align:start position:0%
um seem to contemplate that the retail
 
07:20:41.670 --> 07:20:41.680 align:start position:0%
customer would also pay reduced
 
07:20:43.830 --> 07:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
transmission card charges based on that
 
07:20:46.070 --> 07:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
credit so these two provisions kind of
 
07:20:47.910 --> 07:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
taken together kind of result in a
 
07:20:47.920 --> 07:20:49.430 align:start position:0%
taken together kind of result in a
mismatch

07:20:49.430 --> 07:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
mismatch
 
07:20:51.110 --> 07:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
unless the producer is required to pass
 
07:20:52.868 --> 07:20:52.878 align:start position:0%
through the amount of the credit and its
 
07:20:55.030 --> 07:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
pricing and billing for the retail
 
07:20:58.468 --> 07:20:58.478 align:start position:0%
transactions i'm almost done last one
 
07:21:00.868 --> 07:21:00.878 align:start position:0%
i want to address the proposed
 
07:21:02.948 --> 07:21:02.958 align:start position:0%
bills consumer protection requirements
 
07:21:04.548 --> 07:21:04.558 align:start position:0%
for the department rulemaking again on
 
07:21:06.150 --> 07:21:06.160 align:start position:0%
page two
 
07:21:07.990 --> 07:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
the bill apparently requires the
 
07:21:10.150 --> 07:21:10.160 align:start position:0%
department um
 
07:21:11.590 --> 07:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
to create rules to provide for the
 
07:21:13.750 --> 07:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
filing or reporting on contracts for
 
07:21:16.948 --> 07:21:16.958 align:start position:0%
interstate and direct sales by limited
 
07:21:16.958 --> 07:21:18.070 align:start position:0%
interstate and direct sales by limited
producers

07:21:18.070 --> 07:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
producers
 
07:21:20.310 --> 07:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
and also to provide quote reasonable
 
07:21:23.750 --> 07:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
consumer protections for retail uh sales
 
07:21:26.708 --> 07:21:26.718 align:start position:0%
of electricity from limited producers
 
07:21:27.830 --> 07:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
which may
 
07:21:29.830 --> 07:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
include a requirement for prior approval
 
07:21:31.430 --> 07:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
and review and approval of such
 
07:21:33.830 --> 07:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
contracts before they go into effect
 
07:21:35.590 --> 07:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
while these protections seem well
 
07:21:35.600 --> 07:21:36.868 align:start position:0%
while these protections seem well
intended

07:21:36.868 --> 07:21:36.878 align:start position:0%
intended
 
07:21:38.150 --> 07:21:38.160 align:start position:0%
the committee should be aware that
 
07:21:40.310 --> 07:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
limited electric energy producers are
 
07:21:42.628 --> 07:21:42.638 align:start position:0%
not currently subject to regulation
 
07:21:45.270 --> 07:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
by the department or the puc
 
07:21:47.750 --> 07:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
they are not public utilities subject to
 
07:21:49.830 --> 07:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
obviously extensive regulation as you
 
07:21:51.990 --> 07:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
guys are aware nor are they competitive
 
07:21:53.990 --> 07:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
suppliers required to be registered with
 
07:21:56.150 --> 07:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
the department and to comply with price
 
07:21:58.310 --> 07:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
disclosure and other customer
 
07:22:00.310 --> 07:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
enrollment obligations set forth in the
 
07:22:02.948 --> 07:22:02.958 align:start position:0%
ministry of rule so in effect this bill
 
07:22:05.510 --> 07:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
would expand department regulator
 
07:22:07.270 --> 07:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
regulatory jurisdiction to a set of
 
07:22:09.030 --> 07:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
entities that are not currently
 
07:22:09.040 --> 07:22:10.788 align:start position:0%
entities that are not currently
regulated

07:22:10.788 --> 07:22:10.798 align:start position:0%
regulated
 
07:22:12.548 --> 07:22:12.558 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping you guys could all follow me
 
07:22:14.310 --> 07:22:14.320 align:start position:0%
through that and everything but uh if
 
07:22:17.270 --> 07:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
you have any questions i did bring david
 
07:22:18.628 --> 07:22:18.638 align:start position:0%
wiesner here with me today and he can
 
07:22:20.708 --> 07:22:20.718 align:start position:0%
certainly answer them more robustly than
 
07:22:23.990 --> 07:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:25.430 --> 07:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:22:28.310 --> 07:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
thank you uh mr robarge and mr wiesner
 
07:22:30.948 --> 07:22:30.958 align:start position:0%
for being here this afternoon to answer
 
07:22:34.070 --> 07:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
our questions on this legislation
 
07:22:36.468 --> 07:22:36.478 align:start position:0%
and uh representative plett would like
 
07:22:38.548 --> 07:22:38.558 align:start position:0%
to lead off i would just like to ask the
 
07:22:41.350 --> 07:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
spelling of mr wiesner's name so i can
 
07:22:43.590 --> 07:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
get the clerk's duties correctly thank
 
07:22:44.948 --> 07:22:44.958 align:start position:0%
you well that's an easy one and
 
07:22:48.388 --> 07:22:48.398 align:start position:0%
hopefully i can handle it w i e s
 
07:22:52.830 --> 07:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:55.270 --> 07:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
r i'm the legal director at the
 
07:22:56.868 --> 07:22:56.878 align:start position:0%
department of energy but i also have a
 
07:22:58.788 --> 07:22:58.798 align:start position:0%
lot of subject matter experience with
 
07:23:00.868 --> 07:23:00.878 align:start position:0%
net metering with the liberty battery
 
07:23:03.670 --> 07:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
pilot uh program that uh mr bilo
 
07:23:05.990 --> 07:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
referenced earlier and i think i've
 
07:23:08.230 --> 07:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
looked at this bill or versions of it
 
07:23:10.388 --> 07:23:10.398 align:start position:0%
over the past few years
 
07:23:12.388 --> 07:23:12.398 align:start position:0%
thank you representative harrington has
 
07:23:14.788 --> 07:23:14.798 align:start position:0%
a question uh more of a request thank
 
07:23:17.030 --> 07:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman it looked like you had
 
07:23:18.628 --> 07:23:18.638 align:start position:0%
written testimony could you make that
 
07:23:20.070 --> 07:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
available to us
 
07:23:21.750 --> 07:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
i can certainly submit via email thank
 
07:23:21.760 --> 07:23:24.230 align:start position:0%
i can certainly submit via email thank
you

07:23:24.230 --> 07:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:25.990 --> 07:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
okay additional questions mr
 
07:23:27.830 --> 07:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
representative luikee
 
07:23:30.948 --> 07:23:30.958 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you um i'm
 
07:23:33.430 --> 07:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
hearing mention of the coincident peak
 
07:23:35.670 --> 07:23:35.680 align:start position:0%
and intermittent producers doesn't this
 
07:23:37.270 --> 07:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
lead to somewhat of a crapshoot
 
07:23:39.030 --> 07:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
basically if somebody happens to be
 
07:23:41.590 --> 07:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
producing at the coincident peak then it
 
07:23:44.788 --> 07:23:44.798 align:start position:0%
goes one way if not then uh things can
 
07:23:46.948 --> 07:23:46.958 align:start position:0%
be completely different and if so would
 
07:23:48.310 --> 07:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
how would this
 
07:23:50.788 --> 07:23:50.798 align:start position:0%
might this actually increase rates to
 
07:23:53.030 --> 07:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
ratepayers well i believe the intent of
 
07:23:55.750 --> 07:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
the bill is that if a limited producer
 
07:23:58.070 --> 07:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
is exporting power to the distribution
 
07:23:59.670 --> 07:23:59.680 align:start position:0%
system at the time of the monthly
 
07:24:01.590 --> 07:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
coincidence system peak
 
07:24:03.990 --> 07:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
that there would be reduced transmission
 
07:24:06.468 --> 07:24:06.478 align:start position:0%
charges assessed to the utilities
 
07:24:09.270 --> 07:24:09.280 align:start position:0%
and that a portion of that would be
 
07:24:11.110 --> 07:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
made available as a credit to the
 
07:24:11.120 --> 07:24:13.510 align:start position:0%
made available as a credit to the
generator

07:24:13.510 --> 07:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
generator
 
07:24:15.910 --> 07:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
and and that is those types of avoided
 
07:24:18.070 --> 07:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
costs have been recognized by the puc
 
07:24:19.430 --> 07:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
and the doe
 
07:24:22.310 --> 07:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
and as mr roberge noted we are currently
 
07:24:23.590 --> 07:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
taking a close look at that in the
 
07:24:25.190 --> 07:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
context of the value of distributed
 
07:24:27.670 --> 07:24:27.680 align:start position:0%
energy resources study which is being
 
07:24:29.590 --> 07:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
conducted in the pucs net metering
 
07:24:32.468 --> 07:24:32.478 align:start position:0%
docket and it's also being tested real
 
07:24:35.110 --> 07:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
world if you will in the uh literally
 
07:24:38.788 --> 07:24:38.798 align:start position:0%
excuse me liberty battery pilot program
 
07:24:40.070 --> 07:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
one of the chief
 
07:24:41.990 --> 07:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
um sort of justifications for that
 
07:24:44.628 --> 07:24:44.638 align:start position:0%
battery pilot program is the uh
 
07:24:46.788 --> 07:24:46.798 align:start position:0%
potential to reduce
 
07:24:48.708 --> 07:24:48.718 align:start position:0%
what are called regional network service
 
07:24:50.548 --> 07:24:50.558 align:start position:0%
and local network service charges to
 
07:24:50.558 --> 07:24:51.750 align:start position:0%
and local network service charges to
utilities

07:24:51.750 --> 07:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
07:24:54.388 --> 07:24:54.398 align:start position:0%
based on the ability to reduce load on
 
07:24:56.230 --> 07:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
the distribution system at the time of
 
07:24:59.030 --> 07:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
that monthly coincidence system peak
 
07:25:00.548 --> 07:25:00.558 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that answered your question
 
07:25:00.558 --> 07:25:04.150 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that answered your question
but

07:25:04.150 --> 07:25:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:04.160 --> 07:25:05.350 align:start position:0%
 
okay

07:25:05.350 --> 07:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:25:07.590 --> 07:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
additional questions for
 
07:25:09.190 --> 07:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
the gentleman from the department of
 
07:25:09.200 --> 07:25:12.310 align:start position:0%
the gentleman from the department of
energy

07:25:12.310 --> 07:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:14.628 --> 07:25:14.638 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee you can
 
07:25:15.830 --> 07:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
ask a question it's a point of
 
07:25:18.708 --> 07:25:18.718 align:start position:0%
clarification actually okay um
 
07:25:20.548 --> 07:25:20.558 align:start position:0%
mr roberge when you testified you
 
07:25:23.030 --> 07:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh on line 20 where it's
 
07:25:25.190 --> 07:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
describing that the limited producer
 
07:25:26.948 --> 07:25:26.958 align:start position:0%
shall receive credit for avoided
 
07:25:28.868 --> 07:25:28.878 align:start position:0%
transmission charges
 
07:25:30.070 --> 07:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
and then you said that you thought that
 
07:25:33.270 --> 07:25:33.280 align:start position:0%
that was inconsistent with section 6
 
07:25:34.868 --> 07:25:34.878 align:start position:0%
on line 31
 
07:25:37.510 --> 07:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
and i think on line 31 it's basically
 
07:25:39.510 --> 07:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
saying the purchasers that would enter
 
07:25:42.070 --> 07:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
into that purchase power agreement would
 
07:25:42.080 --> 07:25:43.430 align:start position:0%
into that purchase power agreement would
have

07:25:43.430 --> 07:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
have
 
07:25:45.430 --> 07:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
the responsibility to pay and then it
 
07:25:47.350 --> 07:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
lists a bunch of things and
 
07:25:48.868 --> 07:25:48.878 align:start position:0%
basically it
 
07:25:50.868 --> 07:25:50.878 align:start position:0%
transmission charges as they may be
 
07:25:52.468 --> 07:25:52.478 align:start position:0%
adjusted so
 
07:25:55.110 --> 07:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
i think it's just really outlining whose
 
07:25:57.190 --> 07:25:57.200 align:start position:0%
responsibilities each of those things is
 
07:25:58.070 --> 07:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
i don't think they're actually
 
07:25:58.080 --> 07:25:59.270 align:start position:0%
i don't think they're actually
inconsistent

07:25:59.270 --> 07:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
inconsistent
 
07:26:00.788 --> 07:26:00.798 align:start position:0%
but i just
 
07:26:02.230 --> 07:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
thought i'd mention that because i i
 
07:26:03.910 --> 07:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
looked at it when you said it and read
 
07:26:06.708 --> 07:26:06.718 align:start position:0%
it a few times and i i don't think they
 
07:26:07.910 --> 07:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
i think they're talking about two
 
07:26:07.920 --> 07:26:09.110 align:start position:0%
i think they're talking about two
different

07:26:09.110 --> 07:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
different
 
07:26:09.120 --> 07:26:10.388 align:start position:0%
different
um

07:26:10.388 --> 07:26:10.398 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:26:13.190 --> 07:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
two different participants in the system
 
07:26:16.548 --> 07:26:16.558 align:start position:0%
and what they are responsible for
 
07:26:18.548 --> 07:26:18.558 align:start position:0%
so if there were no charges then they
 
07:26:20.150 --> 07:26:20.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be responsible for them but if
 
07:26:21.670 --> 07:26:21.680 align:start position:0%
there are any then they're the ones who
 
07:26:23.030 --> 07:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
are responsible at least that's how i
 
07:26:24.948 --> 07:26:24.958 align:start position:0%
read it i think we identified a
 
07:26:26.708 --> 07:26:26.718 align:start position:0%
potential mismatch because there are two
 
07:26:29.270 --> 07:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
different parties being referenced so if
 
07:26:31.750 --> 07:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
the credit is going to the generator
 
07:26:33.830 --> 07:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
but there's a reduction in the charges
 
07:26:37.030 --> 07:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
that would be paid by um by the customer
 
07:26:39.830 --> 07:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
to its interconnected utility
 
07:26:42.070 --> 07:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
then it's not clear that's a one-for-one
 
07:26:43.910 --> 07:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
trade-off and if it's not then
 
07:26:45.910 --> 07:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
somebody's either getting over-credited
 
07:26:47.750 --> 07:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
or not paying enough now it might be
 
07:26:49.830 --> 07:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
possible to solve that through rules
 
07:26:49.840 --> 07:26:50.788 align:start position:0%
possible to solve that through rules
but

07:26:50.788 --> 07:26:50.798 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:26:52.548 --> 07:26:52.558 align:start position:0%
the the legislation as written leaves
 
07:26:54.150 --> 07:26:54.160 align:start position:0%
that somewhat unclear and we just wanted
 
07:26:57.430 --> 07:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
to flag that okay thank you
 
07:26:59.590 --> 07:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
okay additional questions for the
 
07:27:04.628 --> 07:27:04.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:06.628 --> 07:27:06.638 align:start position:0%
okay uh i have a
 
07:27:09.830 --> 07:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
another question uh seeing none from the
 
07:27:14.310 --> 07:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:16.548 --> 07:27:16.558 align:start position:0%
rep uh the honorable clifton bilo
 
07:27:19.830 --> 07:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned senate bill 321 i don't know
 
07:27:21.590 --> 07:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
has that bill been heard before the
 
07:27:23.830 --> 07:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
senate as yet
 
07:27:25.590 --> 07:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
uh to the best of my knowledge it has
 
07:27:27.510 --> 07:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
not but it is obviously referred to the
 
07:27:28.868 --> 07:27:28.878 align:start position:0%
senate energy and natural resources
 
07:27:28.878 --> 07:27:29.910 align:start position:0%
senate energy and natural resources
committee

07:27:29.910 --> 07:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
committee
 
07:27:29.920 --> 07:27:30.788 align:start position:0%
committee
okay

07:27:30.788 --> 07:27:30.798 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:27:32.708 --> 07:27:32.718 align:start position:0%
so i guess it would not be jermaine to
 
07:27:34.468 --> 07:27:34.478 align:start position:0%
ask questions about it if it hasn't been
 
07:27:37.910 --> 07:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
heard so i'll just go read it and
 
07:27:39.910 --> 07:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
get my questions answered that way all
 
07:27:39.920 --> 07:27:40.628 align:start position:0%
get my questions answered that way all
right

07:27:40.628 --> 07:27:40.638 align:start position:0%
right
 
07:27:43.350 --> 07:27:43.360 align:start position:0%
further questions for the gentleman from
 
07:27:43.360 --> 07:27:47.430 align:start position:0%
further questions for the gentleman from
doe

07:27:47.430 --> 07:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:47.440 --> 07:27:48.388 align:start position:0%
 
none

07:27:48.388 --> 07:27:48.398 align:start position:0%
none
 
07:27:52.150 --> 07:27:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:52.160 --> 07:27:53.670 align:start position:0%
 
represented

07:27:53.670 --> 07:27:53.680 align:start position:0%
represented
 
07:27:55.350 --> 07:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
wiki thank you mr chairman this is more
 
07:27:57.110 --> 07:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
or less a follow-up to my previous
 
07:27:57.120 --> 07:27:58.468 align:start position:0%
or less a follow-up to my previous
question

07:27:58.468 --> 07:27:58.478 align:start position:0%
question
 
07:28:01.030 --> 07:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
is the coincident peak knowable other
 
07:28:02.708 --> 07:28:02.718 align:start position:0%
than in hindsight
 
07:28:04.388 --> 07:28:04.398 align:start position:0%
can you tell ahead of time that it's
 
07:28:06.310 --> 07:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
going to occur or
 
07:28:08.468 --> 07:28:08.478 align:start position:0%
does can you say oh it happened at such
 
07:28:10.868 --> 07:28:10.878 align:start position:0%
and such time on such and such day
 
07:28:12.468 --> 07:28:12.478 align:start position:0%
yeah you really don't know until it's
 
07:28:12.478 --> 07:28:13.750 align:start position:0%
yeah you really don't know until it's
happened

07:28:13.750 --> 07:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
happened
 
07:28:15.350 --> 07:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
so you can i mean for instance in the
 
07:28:17.190 --> 07:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
liberty battery pilot program they are
 
07:28:19.430 --> 07:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
targeting those peaks but it's
 
07:28:20.948 --> 07:28:20.958 align:start position:0%
particularly hard in some of what we
 
07:28:23.430 --> 07:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
call the shoulder months of the year
 
07:28:25.670 --> 07:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
in uh you know in april or in october
 
07:28:27.430 --> 07:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
you don't know exactly when the peak is
 
07:28:30.070 --> 07:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
going to occur and you don't have
 
07:28:31.830 --> 07:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
as good forecasting information about
 
07:28:33.910 --> 07:28:33.920 align:start position:0%
when it's going to be a hot day a cold
 
07:28:37.510 --> 07:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
day and that may drive electric demand
 
07:28:39.830 --> 07:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
you can probably guess the range of
 
07:28:41.910 --> 07:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
hours it's going to occur
 
07:28:43.910 --> 07:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
on average but given you know the
 
07:28:47.030 --> 07:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
participation specific day and hour is a
 
07:28:48.948 --> 07:28:48.958 align:start position:0%
hard thing to know so you really don't
 
07:28:50.468 --> 07:28:50.478 align:start position:0%
know until after the fact and it's
 
07:28:52.548 --> 07:28:52.558 align:start position:0%
really a billing mechanism
 
07:28:55.910 --> 07:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
for the uh for the iso and for some of
 
07:28:58.468 --> 07:28:58.478 align:start position:0%
the transmission providers to
 
07:29:00.628 --> 07:29:00.638 align:start position:0%
charge their trans their share of
 
07:29:02.548 --> 07:29:02.558 align:start position:0%
transmission charges to
 
07:29:04.070 --> 07:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
the distribution utilities which then
 
07:29:09.590 --> 07:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:09.600 --> 07:29:10.388 align:start position:0%
 
okay

07:29:10.388 --> 07:29:10.398 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:29:15.350 --> 07:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:16.868 --> 07:29:16.878 align:start position:0%
well seeing none
 
07:29:19.190 --> 07:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
i guess we'll move on and thank you both
 
07:29:21.590 --> 07:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
for uh being available to answer our
 
07:29:23.190 --> 07:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
questions we have one more person who
 
07:29:25.350 --> 07:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
would like to testify on this build
 
07:29:28.310 --> 07:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
and that is kelly buchanan from clean
 
07:29:31.750 --> 07:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
energy new hampshire so ms buchanan
 
07:29:35.990 --> 07:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
please uh have a seat and uh
 
07:29:40.310 --> 07:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:41.830 --> 07:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and members of the
 
07:29:43.510 --> 07:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
committee uh for the record my name is
 
07:29:45.670 --> 07:29:45.680 align:start position:0%
kelly buchanan director of legislative
 
07:29:47.670 --> 07:29:47.680 align:start position:0%
and regulatory affairs for clean energy
 
07:29:49.190 --> 07:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
07:29:51.750 --> 07:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
and i will be very brief today i
 
07:29:53.430 --> 07:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
submitted written testimony to you via
 
07:29:55.990 --> 07:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
email this afternoon around lunchtime
 
07:29:56.000 --> 07:29:57.030 align:start position:0%
email this afternoon around lunchtime
and

07:29:57.030 --> 07:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:29:59.190 --> 07:29:59.200 align:start position:0%
you know it's pretty short we see house
 
07:30:02.708 --> 07:30:02.718 align:start position:0%
bill 1635 as something that we support
 
07:30:04.788 --> 07:30:04.798 align:start position:0%
in terms of the goals but perhaps the
 
07:30:07.030 --> 07:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
committee would consider i'm holding on
 
07:30:08.868 --> 07:30:08.878 align:start position:0%
to this bill in some manner via interim
 
07:30:10.948 --> 07:30:10.958 align:start position:0%
study or another means to more fully
 
07:30:13.270 --> 07:30:13.280 align:start position:0%
consider senate bill 321 if it does
 
07:30:14.548 --> 07:30:14.558 align:start position:0%
cross over
 
07:30:14.558 --> 07:30:15.750 align:start position:0%
cross over
because

07:30:15.750 --> 07:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
because
 
07:30:17.910 --> 07:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
as the honorable mr bilo mentioned that
 
07:30:20.628 --> 07:30:20.638 align:start position:0%
bill considers the study committee's
 
07:30:22.468 --> 07:30:22.478 align:start position:0%
reports that you all have in your hands
 
07:30:22.478 --> 07:30:24.468 align:start position:0%
reports that you all have in your hands
today

07:30:24.468 --> 07:30:24.478 align:start position:0%
today
 
07:30:26.310 --> 07:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
clean energy new hampshire is certainly
 
07:30:29.190 --> 07:30:29.200 align:start position:0%
supportive of this reform in general and
 
07:30:30.868 --> 07:30:30.878 align:start position:0%
i won't repeat all the wonderful things
 
07:30:33.110 --> 07:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
that mr bilo shared with you today i
 
07:30:34.388 --> 07:30:34.398 align:start position:0%
find them all
 
07:30:36.708 --> 07:30:36.718 align:start position:0%
agreeable and we're supportive of that
 
07:30:38.150 --> 07:30:38.160 align:start position:0%
so i would be happy to take any
 
07:30:41.590 --> 07:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:30:43.430 --> 07:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
that was very brief you took me by
 
07:30:46.230 --> 07:30:46.240 align:start position:0%
surprise in fact
 
07:30:48.708 --> 07:30:48.718 align:start position:0%

uh being here but um
 
07:30:59.270 --> 07:30:59.280 align:start position:0%
in the future if you could submit it 24
 
07:31:00.868 --> 07:31:00.878 align:start position:0%
hours in advance that would give us a
 
07:31:02.868 --> 07:31:02.878 align:start position:0%
chance to take a quick peek at it i
 
07:31:05.110 --> 07:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
would be glad too of course i apologize
 
07:31:06.388 --> 07:31:06.398 align:start position:0%

yes uh representative partial thank you

committee or was it sent via the uh
our

07:31:19.670 --> 07:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
our
 
07:31:21.190 --> 07:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
house website
 
07:31:24.150 --> 07:31:24.160 align:start position:0%
i sent you an email via the email the
 
07:31:26.948 --> 07:31:26.958 align:start position:0%
entire committee listed under your
 
07:31:28.788 --> 07:31:28.798 align:start position:0%
your standing committee webpage i did
 
07:31:30.830 --> 07:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
not use the newly
 
07:31:34.230 --> 07:31:34.240 align:start position:0%
created testimony submission form if the
 
07:31:36.230 --> 07:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
committee has a preference it would be
 
07:31:37.750 --> 07:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
helpful to know if which one is
 
07:31:37.760 --> 07:31:42.150 align:start position:0%
helpful to know if which one is
preferred

07:31:42.150 --> 07:31:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:44.310 --> 07:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
i believe your general address is house
 
07:31:48.548 --> 07:31:48.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:51.190 --> 07:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
okay good to know
 
07:31:52.548 --> 07:31:52.558 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure but you may want to
 
07:31:54.628 --> 07:31:54.638 align:start position:0%
consider resubmitting that i apologize
 
07:31:57.030 --> 07:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
for speaking here but yes i i'm looking
 
07:32:00.388 --> 07:32:00.398 align:start position:0%
at my email now and i don't see it oh
 
07:32:02.310 --> 07:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
okay i will so you may want to double
 
07:32:04.070 --> 07:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
check to make sure that that it got
 
07:32:04.080 --> 07:32:05.110 align:start position:0%
check to make sure that that it got
through

07:32:05.110 --> 07:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
through
 
07:32:07.110 --> 07:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
i'll do that um
 
07:32:08.948 --> 07:32:08.958 align:start position:0%
but we appreciate you
 
07:32:11.190 --> 07:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
you sending it to us uh one way or the
 
07:32:13.670 --> 07:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
other of course thank you you're welcome
 
07:32:15.670 --> 07:32:15.680 align:start position:0%
any uh representative platt has a
 
07:32:15.680 --> 07:32:16.708 align:start position:0%
any uh representative platt has a
question

07:32:16.708 --> 07:32:16.718 align:start position:0%
question
 
07:32:18.628 --> 07:32:18.638 align:start position:0%
mr chairman she asked if the committee
 
07:32:20.868 --> 07:32:20.878 align:start position:0%
had any preference i i don't know about
 
07:32:22.548 --> 07:32:22.558 align:start position:0%
the committee but i like getting an
 
07:32:24.628 --> 07:32:24.638 align:start position:0%
email so i don't have to go chase
 
07:32:26.708 --> 07:32:26.718 align:start position:0%
another source
 
07:32:26.718 --> 07:32:29.030 align:start position:0%
another source
okay

07:32:29.030 --> 07:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:32:30.628 --> 07:32:30.638 align:start position:0%
anybody else have a preference they want
 
07:32:33.110 --> 07:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
to express
 
07:32:35.670 --> 07:32:35.680 align:start position:0%
uh representative pementel
 
07:32:36.788 --> 07:32:36.798 align:start position:0%
i agree
 
07:32:38.548 --> 07:32:38.558 align:start position:0%
okay good
 
07:32:41.110 --> 07:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
email it is so uh we'll look forward to
 
07:32:43.110 --> 07:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
seeing that all right thank you miss
 
07:32:45.190 --> 07:32:45.200 align:start position:0%
buchanan we appreciate you being here
 
07:32:47.510 --> 07:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
now i have a question for representative
 
07:32:47.520 --> 07:32:49.670 align:start position:0%
now i have a question for representative
mcgee

07:32:49.670 --> 07:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
mcgee
 
07:32:51.750 --> 07:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative mcgee the
 
07:32:51.760 --> 07:32:53.910 align:start position:0%
uh representative mcgee the
um

07:32:53.910 --> 07:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:32:57.510 --> 07:32:57.520 align:start position:0%
lipa study committee that met this fall
 
07:32:59.750 --> 07:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
came up with several recommendations and
 
07:33:01.030 --> 07:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
07:33:02.628 --> 07:33:02.638 align:start position:0%
matter of fact the first recommendation
 
07:33:04.388 --> 07:33:04.398 align:start position:0%
was create a new study commission to
 
07:33:07.110 --> 07:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
more closely examine how to calculate
 
07:33:09.270 --> 07:33:09.280 align:start position:0%
avoided transmission charges to provide
 
07:33:11.510 --> 07:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
a firm understanding of what's involved
 
07:33:13.430 --> 07:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
the second recommendation was submit
 
07:33:15.350 --> 07:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
legislation to require the department of
 
07:33:18.548 --> 07:33:18.558 align:start position:0%
energy and or the puc to conduct a study
 
07:33:20.868 --> 07:33:20.878 align:start position:0%
on the mechanics of computing and
 
07:33:23.350 --> 07:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
monetizing avoided transmission charges
 
07:33:26.230 --> 07:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
and intermittent load reduction
 
07:33:28.230 --> 07:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
so my question for you is would you have
 
07:33:31.270 --> 07:33:31.280 align:start position:0%
any objection to this to an amendment to
 
07:33:32.310 --> 07:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
07:33:34.628 --> 07:33:34.638 align:start position:0%
that implemented one or
 
07:33:37.190 --> 07:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
the other or maybe even both of those
 
07:33:37.200 --> 07:33:39.350 align:start position:0%
the other or maybe even both of those
recommendations

07:33:39.350 --> 07:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
07:33:41.750 --> 07:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh no i have no objection
 
07:33:41.760 --> 07:33:42.548 align:start position:0%
uh no i have no objection
um

07:33:42.548 --> 07:33:42.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:33:43.510 --> 07:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
i think
 
07:33:45.910 --> 07:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
to the second one it sounds like we
 
07:33:47.830 --> 07:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
don't know what the mechanism is but
 
07:33:50.150 --> 07:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
it's not that there isn't a mechanism
 
07:33:52.468 --> 07:33:52.478 align:start position:0%
it sounds like from the testimony
 
07:33:55.510 --> 07:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
um from the honorable clifton below that
 
07:33:57.910 --> 07:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
that there is actually a method already
 
07:33:59.830 --> 07:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
for that it's just not known to us but
 
07:34:03.350 --> 07:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
in the in the first um yeah certainly
 
07:34:05.590 --> 07:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
well based on the testimony of mr
 
07:34:08.230 --> 07:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
weisner i think that
 
07:34:10.230 --> 07:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
there may be some doubt about what the
 
07:34:11.590 --> 07:34:11.600 align:start position:0%
mechanics of
 
07:34:14.468 --> 07:34:14.478 align:start position:0%
computing and monetizing those
 
07:34:16.868 --> 07:34:16.878 align:start position:0%
credits would be so
 
07:34:19.990 --> 07:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
it might be worthwhile to to ask the puc
 
07:34:23.510 --> 07:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
to undertake a a docket to study that
 
07:34:25.590 --> 07:34:25.600 align:start position:0%
representative plett you have a comment
 
07:34:27.990 --> 07:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
yes i just wondered because neither of
 
07:34:29.670 --> 07:34:29.680 align:start position:0%
those steps have been done
 
07:34:31.750 --> 07:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
could this study go this bill go to
 
07:34:34.150 --> 07:34:34.160 align:start position:0%
interim study so to weight the results
 
07:34:35.910 --> 07:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
of those two studies
 
07:34:38.468 --> 07:34:38.478 align:start position:0%
well what i was thinking about was
 
07:34:42.070 --> 07:34:42.080 align:start position:0%
modifying this bill to ask to set up
 
07:34:45.110 --> 07:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
that study committee or to request that
 
07:34:48.468 --> 07:34:48.478 align:start position:0%
puc study to take place
 
07:34:51.030 --> 07:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
so rather than ising this bill
 
07:34:53.590 --> 07:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
i'm suggesting that we amend it
 
07:34:53.600 --> 07:34:55.510 align:start position:0%
i'm suggesting that we amend it
to

07:34:55.510 --> 07:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:34:55.520 --> 07:34:56.788 align:start position:0%
to
change

07:34:56.788 --> 07:34:56.798 align:start position:0%
change
 
07:34:59.350 --> 07:34:59.360 align:start position:0%
its charge if you would
 
07:35:03.510 --> 07:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:05.270 --> 07:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
i made my comment
 
07:35:06.948 --> 07:35:06.958 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
07:35:09.510 --> 07:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative harrington uh yeah i
 
07:35:10.948 --> 07:35:10.958 align:start position:0%
guess a couple quick comments chris if
 
07:35:12.708 --> 07:35:12.718 align:start position:0%
anyone came up with that coincident peek
 
07:35:14.070 --> 07:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
when it comes out let me know and we'll
 
07:35:16.868 --> 07:35:16.878 align:start position:0%
all get rich together because uh you can
 
07:35:18.548 --> 07:35:18.558 align:start position:0%
make a lot of money if you knew that uh
 
07:35:20.388 --> 07:35:20.398 align:start position:0%
second if we are going to look into this
 
07:35:21.670 --> 07:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
transmission cost savings of the
 
07:35:23.510 --> 07:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
coincidence piece i strongly recommend
 
07:35:25.750 --> 07:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
we get the iso involved or someone from
 
07:35:27.910 --> 07:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
there because first of all if you don't
 
07:35:29.590 --> 07:35:29.600 align:start position:0%
speak isonian there's no way you're
 
07:35:31.830 --> 07:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
going to be able to figure it out and uh
 
07:35:33.830 --> 07:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
i i think if whatever that committee
 
07:35:35.670 --> 07:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
goes forward we're going to need input
 
07:35:36.788 --> 07:35:36.798 align:start position:0%
from them because they're the real
 
07:35:38.708 --> 07:35:38.718 align:start position:0%
experts on it and be quite honest
 
07:35:40.150 --> 07:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
there's only a few people outside of
 
07:35:42.150 --> 07:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
that that really understand it and i
 
07:35:44.388 --> 07:35:44.398 align:start position:0%
don't think anyone in this room fully
 
07:35:47.430 --> 07:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:49.590 --> 07:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
that is probably a correct statement
 
07:35:51.510 --> 07:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
that lasts
 
07:35:53.190 --> 07:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
with the possible exception of the
 
07:35:55.990 --> 07:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
honorable clifton below all right so any
 
07:35:59.270 --> 07:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
more comments uh representative partial
 
07:36:00.868 --> 07:36:00.878 align:start position:0%
thank you chair votes my question is for
 
07:36:03.190 --> 07:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
you if we do uh uh amend this with a
 
07:36:04.788 --> 07:36:04.798 align:start position:0%
study commission of some nature or
 
07:36:04.798 --> 07:36:05.750 align:start position:0%
study commission of some nature or
another

07:36:05.750 --> 07:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
another
 
07:36:05.760 --> 07:36:07.030 align:start position:0%
another
um

07:36:07.030 --> 07:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:36:08.230 --> 07:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
would that preclude what we're gonna be
 
07:36:09.590 --> 07:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
looking at when we get the senate bill
 
07:36:11.430 --> 07:36:11.440 align:start position:0%
fee 21 come on over which i believe is
 
07:36:14.468 --> 07:36:14.478 align:start position:0%
being heard on thursday but i'm not sure
 
07:36:16.388 --> 07:36:16.398 align:start position:0%
no it would not preclude that
 
07:36:19.270 --> 07:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
it would just transform this bill from
 
07:36:22.388 --> 07:36:22.398 align:start position:0%
the bill that exists today to
 
07:36:25.590 --> 07:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
either a study committee or a puc docket
 
07:36:27.670 --> 07:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
request or both i'm fine with that
 
07:36:29.990 --> 07:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
second okay and could i ask could we
 
07:36:32.070 --> 07:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
discuss the recommendations in here just
 
07:36:33.830 --> 07:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
to make sure that if we're going to do a
 
07:36:35.670 --> 07:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
study committee that we
 
07:36:37.670 --> 07:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
we undertake whatever questions we
 
07:36:40.548 --> 07:36:40.558 align:start position:0%
actually need answered so can we
 
07:36:42.468 --> 07:36:42.478 align:start position:0%
it's just very quick that you put two
 
07:36:43.990 --> 07:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
bullets out there for me and i haven't
 
07:36:45.750 --> 07:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
had a chance to absorb
 
07:36:45.760 --> 07:36:46.788 align:start position:0%
had a chance to absorb
uh

07:36:46.788 --> 07:36:46.798 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:36:49.670 --> 07:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
what we might want to uncover if we
 
07:36:51.110 --> 07:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
well we're not going to do this today
 
07:36:53.110 --> 07:36:53.120 align:start position:0%
anyway so you'll have time to
 
07:36:55.910 --> 07:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
absorb that information
 
07:36:57.910 --> 07:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
and we could potentially form a
 
07:36:59.750 --> 07:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to
 
07:37:03.510 --> 07:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
work on an amendment for this bill
 
07:37:05.030 --> 07:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
we don't have to decide that right this
 
07:37:08.070 --> 07:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
minute but we'll need to decide it
 
07:37:10.468 --> 07:37:10.478 align:start position:0%
reasonably soon okay i just wanted to
 
07:37:12.628 --> 07:37:12.638 align:start position:0%
know if you were open to that i am
 
07:37:14.388 --> 07:37:14.398 align:start position:0%
that concept
