uh thank you Mr chair good morning Mr
 
00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:15.139 align:start position:0%
chair and honorable committee members
 
00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:17.960 align:start position:0%
hb506 is about anti-discrimination
 
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:20.100 align:start position:0%
nobody should be discriminated against
 
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
for any reason
 
00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:23.699 align:start position:0%
if it were up to me I would have one
 
00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:25.979 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination law but as we have
 
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:27.720 align:start position:0%
seen over the years we keep adding
 
00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:29.639 align:start position:0%
special classes because our world keeps
 
00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:31.010 align:start position:0%
special classes because our world keeps
changing

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 align:start position:0%
changing
 
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
it is too bad we cannot have a law that
 
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
says no one can be discriminated against
 
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:37.080 align:start position:0%
for any reason ever it would solve a lot
 
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
of our problems but let's be real if we
 
00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:40.919 align:start position:0%
all just practice what we learned in
 
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
kindergarten be kind give someone a
 
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:44.580 align:start position:0%
helping hand we would not need any of
 
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:46.380 align:start position:0%
these laws but that is not the case in
 
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:47.940 align:start position:0%
today's world
 
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:49.860 align:start position:0%
so today I come before you because
 
00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
people are being discriminated against
 
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
harass losing their jobs tattling on
 
00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:56.580 align:start position:0%
each other it is ridiculous and now we
 
00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
are seeing other states talking about
 
00:06:59.930 --> 00:06:59.940 align:start position:0%
implementing laws we need a car to
 
00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:01.740 align:start position:0%
access public places
 
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:03.900 align:start position:0%
since when do we need a card to act as a
 
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:06.300 align:start position:0%
public place we say no discrimination
 
00:07:08.689 --> 00:07:08.699 align:start position:0%
for anyone but today discrimination is
 
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
rampant and I am talking about families
 
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:13.620 align:start position:0%
turning on each other
 
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
parents turning on children children
 
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:18.660 align:start position:0%
turning on parents I have never seen
 
00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
anything like it in my life I have lived
 
00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:23.340 align:start position:0%
through discrimination I've seen it been
 
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:26.340 align:start position:0%
a victim of it and I understand it
 
00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:28.500 align:start position:0%
I have constituents who have been denied
 
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
access to a grocery store they went to
 
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
for over 20 years because of a severe
 
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:34.500 align:start position:0%
medical condition and now we look to
 
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:35.940 align:start position:0%
another state who is talking about a
 
00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:38.460 align:start position:0%
coveted passport to get into an arena a
 
00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:39.780 align:start position:0%
public place
 
00:07:42.529 --> 00:07:42.539 align:start position:0%
we hear terms all the time but really
 
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
show me your papers
 
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
we have the argument about requiring an
 
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:48.660 align:start position:0%
ID to vote but yet going into a public
 
00:07:50.689 --> 00:07:50.699 align:start position:0%
place you will need an ID
 
00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
we have people calling the police of the
 
00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
AG's office not knowing that the person
 
00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
may have the medical condition we're
 
00:07:58.850 --> 00:07:58.860 align:start position:0%
denying access to those people from
 
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
entering food and beverage
 
00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:01.860 align:start position:0%
establishments and to other public
 
00:08:04.249 --> 00:08:04.259 align:start position:0%
places because of a medical condition
 
00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:06.060 align:start position:0%
who are denying the owners of these
 
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
establishments the income they may
 
00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:08.940 align:start position:0%
receive from them if they were allowed
 
00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:10.010 align:start position:0%
receive from them if they were allowed
access

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:10.020 align:start position:0%
access
 
00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
these businesses are denying access
 
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
because they are afraid of the
 
00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:15.660 align:start position:0%
government shutting them down
 
00:08:17.089 --> 00:08:17.099 align:start position:0%
when we are afraid of what our
 
00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:18.780 align:start position:0%
government will do to us in Jeopardy of
 
00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:21.300 align:start position:0%
losing all of our liberties and Freedoms
 
00:08:23.089 --> 00:08:23.099 align:start position:0%
this flies in the face of our state
 
00:08:23.099 --> 00:08:24.170 align:start position:0%
this flies in the face of our state
motto

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:24.180 align:start position:0%
motto
 
00:08:27.469 --> 00:08:27.479 align:start position:0%
Live Free or Die because death is not
 
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
the worst of all evils
 
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:31.800 align:start position:0%
and yet here we are today we do not live
 
00:08:33.949 --> 00:08:33.959 align:start position:0%
free people are in constant fear people
 
00:08:35.389 --> 00:08:35.399 align:start position:0%
are tattling on each other talking
 
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
behind their back snickering
 
00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:39.419 align:start position:0%
some people are afraid to go out in
 
00:08:41.029 --> 00:08:41.039 align:start position:0%
public places because they cannot wear a
 
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:42.360 align:start position:0%
medical device or they're afraid they
 
00:08:43.969 --> 00:08:43.979 align:start position:0%
will be denied access because they do
 
00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
not take a mandated vaccine
 
00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:48.420 align:start position:0%
public health is very important and we
 
00:08:50.329 --> 00:08:50.339 align:start position:0%
need to be cognizant of that but
 
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
everybody should have a choice
 
00:08:54.949 --> 00:08:54.959 align:start position:0%
we have a choice of what of religion we
 
00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:56.700 align:start position:0%
have a choice of occupation we have a
 
00:08:59.090 --> 00:08:59.100 align:start position:0%
choice of sexual orientation we should
 
00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:00.959 align:start position:0%
not be denied access to public places
 
00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:03.240 align:start position:0%
because of our choices
 
00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
people should not be looking at people's
 
00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:07.380 align:start position:0%
medical conditions or disabilities and
 
00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:09.180 align:start position:0%
causing them psychological harm and
 
00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:11.580 align:start position:0%
making them feel less than human this is
 
00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:13.800 align:start position:0%
what discrimination is making someone
 
00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:16.380 align:start position:0%
feel less than
 
00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:18.180 align:start position:0%
the last time I checked we are all
 
00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:21.060 align:start position:0%
created equal and that means everyone
 
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
you will hear that this is creating a
 
00:09:24.769 --> 00:09:24.779 align:start position:0%
special class as Citizens unfortunately
 
00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:27.300 align:start position:0%
it is a road we have gone down as we
 
00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
keep updating our special class of
 
00:09:30.769 --> 00:09:30.779 align:start position:0%
detentions and it is a shame that we
 
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
have to do this so that people are not
 
00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
discriminated against so this is our
 
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.329 align:start position:0%
discriminated against so this is our
reality

00:09:35.329 --> 00:09:35.339 align:start position:0%
reality
 
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
it is not the way it should be but it is
 
00:09:39.949 --> 00:09:39.959 align:start position:0%
the way it is it is unfortunate that
 
00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:41.940 align:start position:0%
anyone discriminates against anyone for
 
00:09:44.269 --> 00:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
any reason
 
00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:47.220 align:start position:0%
so I please please ask you to pass this
 
00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:49.500 align:start position:0%
anti-discriminant law discrimination law
 
00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:51.540 align:start position:0%
so that everybody no matter who they are
 
00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:52.980 align:start position:0%
or what reason they have is not
 
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
discriminated against
 
00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:56.940 align:start position:0%
and thank you and I'm open for any
 
00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:00.769 align:start position:0%
and thank you and I'm open for any
questions

00:10:00.769 --> 00:10:00.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:04.009 --> 00:10:04.019 align:start position:0%
will you take questions yes I will
 
00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:07.860 align:start position:0%
anyone in the committee wishing to
 
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.170 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:18.180 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan uh thank you Mr
 
00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:22.980 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative
 
00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
Christ does this mean
 
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
that if a person comes to my store
 
00:10:35.389 --> 00:10:35.399 align:start position:0%
and has not been vaccinated
 
00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:39.660 align:start position:0%
and declines to wear a mask
 
00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:43.140 align:start position:0%
that I cannot request that they not
 
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
enter the store so that I can protect my
 
00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.069 align:start position:0%
enter the store so that I can protect my
employees

00:10:48.069 --> 00:10:48.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
is your store available for Public
 
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
Access yes
 
00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
then yes that would be the case because
 
00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
you were denying the public you are
 
00:10:59.090 --> 00:10:59.100 align:start position:0%
discriminated against those that cannot
 
00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
wear a mask that have a medical
 
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.470 align:start position:0%
wear a mask that have a medical
condition

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:13.730 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
Merchant

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:13.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:14.870 align:start position:0%
 
chairman

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:17.160 align:start position:0%
I'm representative salawway that's the
 
00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson
 
00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:27.540 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:31.140 align:start position:0%
if I own a business and a child comes in
 
00:11:33.829 --> 00:11:33.839 align:start position:0%
that's not well behaved and tearing the
 
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
place apart and the parent is oblivious
 
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
or could care less and they do it these
 
00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:40.980 align:start position:0%
people do exist do I have a right to put
 
00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:42.660 align:start position:0%
them out of the store or do I let the
 
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
child continue to be disruptive to
 
00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
buying business
 
00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
is what type of business is it a private
 
00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:51.540 align:start position:0%
business or a public business and what I
 
00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:54.180 align:start position:0%
mean by that is it open to the public
 
00:11:58.009 --> 00:11:58.019 align:start position:0%
yes it is it's a grocery store okay
 
00:11:58.019 --> 00:11:59.930 align:start position:0%
yes it is it's a grocery store okay
so

00:11:59.930 --> 00:11:59.940 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
this doesn't have anything to do with
 
00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
the child this has to do there are
 
00:12:08.449 --> 00:12:08.459 align:start position:0%
certain things where you cannot
 
00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
discriminate against somebody for
 
00:12:12.769 --> 00:12:12.779 align:start position:0%
and this is just adding one of those
 
00:12:12.779 --> 00:12:14.389 align:start position:0%
and this is just adding one of those
items

00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
items
 
00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
If I Were A store owner I would ask the
 
00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:18.300 align:start position:0%
parent to please
 
00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
get their child in check
 
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.069 align:start position:0%
get their child in check
um

00:12:22.069 --> 00:12:22.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:24.180 align:start position:0%
and if they're destroying being
 
00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
destructive to
 
00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
I would assume that you could ask them
 
00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:32.220 align:start position:0%
to leave but you didn't deny them access
 
00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:34.620 align:start position:0%
you let them come into the store but for
 
00:12:36.769 --> 00:12:36.779 align:start position:0%
other reasons for that because they were
 
00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
being destructive
 
00:12:41.509 --> 00:12:41.519 align:start position:0%
to your products
 
00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
you ask them to leave
 
00:12:45.769 --> 00:12:45.779 align:start position:0%
but this law this law has nothing to do
 
00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
representative Contour this is
 
00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson in the chair
 
00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:55.500 align:start position:0%
um what about something that is closer
 
00:12:58.490 --> 00:12:58.500 align:start position:0%
for example the signs that say no shirts
 
00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
no shoes no service
 
00:13:04.009 --> 00:13:04.019 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering if some people post
 
00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
that sign because no shirt no shoes is a
 
00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:09.060 align:start position:0%
health problem or are perceived as a
 
00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
health hazard
 
00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
um would this bill speak to that and if
 
00:13:14.329 --> 00:13:14.339 align:start position:0%
not shouldn't
 
00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
it does not speak to that this bill
 
00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
speaks specifically to medical devices
 
00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:27.769 --> 00:13:27.779 align:start position:0%
thank you representative knurk
 
00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:30.660 align:start position:0%
yes I would like to follow up on both
 
00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
representative saloways and
 
00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:33.540 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson's comments then
 
00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:37.500 align:start position:0%
if we uh about my initial question was
 
00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:40.260 align:start position:0%
the same but I'll come back if you feel
 
00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:42.420 align:start position:0%
that we cannot that sort of business
 
00:13:44.449 --> 00:13:44.459 align:start position:0%
that's open to the public does not have
 
00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
a right to set a rule to let's say
 
00:13:49.009 --> 00:13:49.019 align:start position:0%
prevent you coming in without a shirt or
 
00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
shoes or let's say even start naked
 
00:13:53.629 --> 00:13:53.639 align:start position:0%
where that's really more an issue of
 
00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
offending people's pretty sensibilities
 
00:13:59.750 --> 00:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
but you think though that they would not
 
00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
have the right to set a rule that would
 
00:14:04.069 --> 00:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
protect their employees health or their
 
00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:05.160 align:start position:0%
own health
 
00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:07.980 align:start position:0%
and if so I'm trying to understand why
 
00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:13.550 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:17.700 align:start position:0%
when you deny everyone access for not
 
00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
where you know your shirt shoes and um
 
00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
the shirt and shoes and I'm sure all
 
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
clothing because we don't we have
 
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
decency laws in this state which I
 
00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
believe that would be kind of covered
 
00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.030 align:start position:0%
believe that would be kind of covered
under

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
under
 
00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:35.720 align:start position:0%
um but this is regarding anti is
 
00:14:38.329 --> 00:14:38.339 align:start position:0%
discriminating against people with
 
00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:40.740 align:start position:0%
medical conditions and disabilities you
 
00:14:42.769 --> 00:14:42.779 align:start position:0%
are do they are just there's actual
 
00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:47.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:14:53.569 --> 00:14:53.579 align:start position:0%
follow up well wouldn't you consider
 
00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:55.740 align:start position:0%
your discriminating against a person who
 
00:14:59.629 --> 00:14:59.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't wish to wear clothing and if so
 
00:15:02.569 --> 00:15:02.579 align:start position:0%
again why would that be any different
 
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
than discriminating I mean you could
 
00:15:06.949 --> 00:15:06.959 align:start position:0%
almost like at a mask as a piece of
 
00:15:09.949 --> 00:15:09.959 align:start position:0%
clothing which it isn't but it's
 
00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:11.519 align:start position:0%
certainly similar and why would we have
 
00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:13.980 align:start position:0%
a special treatment for that over a
 
00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:20.389 --> 00:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
like uh thank you representative for the
 
00:15:22.189 --> 00:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
question but like I said uh we have
 
00:15:25.189 --> 00:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
decency laws in the state and a face
 
00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:27.300 align:start position:0%
mask under the FDA is considered a
 
00:15:29.449 --> 00:15:29.459 align:start position:0%
medical device
 
00:15:29.459 --> 00:15:31.250 align:start position:0%
medical device
so

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:31.260 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:32.940 align:start position:0%
um there are two you're talking you you
 
00:15:35.269 --> 00:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
can't compare the two
 
00:15:38.689 --> 00:15:38.699 align:start position:0%
and the people in the store
 
00:15:38.699 --> 00:15:40.310 align:start position:0%
and the people in the store
apparently

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
apparently
 
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
they're protecting themselves if they're
 
00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:44.240 align:start position:0%
wearing masks and we have there's
 
00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:46.380 align:start position:0%
plexiglasses there's all kinds of things
 
00:15:49.009 --> 00:15:49.019 align:start position:0%
in place but you're making it so that
 
00:15:51.949 --> 00:15:51.959 align:start position:0%
people cannot go to the grocery store
 
00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
or they cannot go to a food
 
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
establishment you're actually
 
00:15:57.889 --> 00:15:57.899 align:start position:0%
discriminating against them because they
 
00:15:59.810 --> 00:15:59.820 align:start position:0%
cannot wear a medical device
 
00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:09.069 align:start position:0%
cannot wear a medical device
foreign

00:16:09.069 --> 00:16:09.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:11.689 --> 00:16:11.699 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative Marsh
 
00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:14.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:16:16.129 --> 00:16:16.139 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
and as you may be aware I'm a hospital
 
00:16:20.689 --> 00:16:20.699 align:start position:0%
trustee and I felt a little concerned
 
00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:22.620 align:start position:0%
how this bill might affect the ability
 
00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
of my hospital to conduct its operations
 
00:16:29.329 --> 00:16:29.339 align:start position:0%
am I correct that if there's still were
 
00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:33.839 align:start position:0%
to become law if I had a nurse in my ICU
 
00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:36.540 align:start position:0%
would happen to have tuberculosis my
 
00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:39.180 align:start position:0%
hospital was up able to mandate that
 
00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:40.980 align:start position:0%
that nurse be treated before she could
 
00:16:43.069 --> 00:16:43.079 align:start position:0%
take care of pictures
 
00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:45.420 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry you broke up at the end there
 
00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:47.420 align:start position:0%
so could you please repeat your question
 
00:16:50.629 --> 00:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
yes it's my Hospital
 
00:16:53.509 --> 00:16:53.519 align:start position:0%
happens to have a nurse is acquired
 
00:16:53.519 --> 00:16:54.949 align:start position:0%
happens to have a nurse is acquired
tuberculosis

00:16:54.949 --> 00:16:54.959 align:start position:0%
tuberculosis
 
00:16:58.009 --> 00:16:58.019 align:start position:0%
if this still works would it be true
 
00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:00.300 align:start position:0%
that my Hospital could not mandate that
 
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
this nurse be treated for her
 
00:17:04.429 --> 00:17:04.439 align:start position:0%
tuberculosis before she took care of
 
00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:07.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:10.980 align:start position:0%
Les so let me thank you representative
 
00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:13.079 align:start position:0%
let me see if I understand you said you
 
00:17:17.809 --> 00:17:17.819 align:start position:0%
have a nurse with tuberculosis yes
 
00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:20.630 align:start position:0%
have a nurse with tuberculosis yes
and

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:21.770 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:21.780 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:17:24.789 --> 00:17:24.799 align:start position:0%
she could not be treated in the ICU
 
00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:27.480 align:start position:0%
she doesn't want to be treated
 
00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
she doesn't want to be treated yes would
 
00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:31.980 align:start position:0%
that mean that I as a hospital
 
00:17:34.909 --> 00:17:34.919 align:start position:0%
administrator would not be able to keep
 
00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
her from working and take care of
 
00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
patients in my ICU
 
00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:42.289 align:start position:0%
patients in my ICU
Les

00:17:42.289 --> 00:17:42.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:42.299 --> 00:17:45.169 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:17:45.169 --> 00:17:45.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
I don't believe because she is an
 
00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:49.500 align:start position:0%
employee of yours
 
00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:53.340 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that
 
00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:53.930 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that
um

00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:53.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
in the medical
 
00:17:58.549 --> 00:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
profession I mean and this has happened
 
00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:01.140 align:start position:0%
to me I actually applied for a job at a
 
00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
hospital and because of the mandates
 
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
they were going to require of me I chose
 
00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:08.820 align:start position:0%
to not take that job
 
00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:09.529 align:start position:0%
to not take that job
um

00:18:09.529 --> 00:18:09.539 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:12.049 --> 00:18:12.059 align:start position:0%
so I don't know we're talking about
 
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
public access we're I'm talking about
 
00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
patrons going into establishments into
 
00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:20.220 align:start position:0%
public housing you're an employee you're
 
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
talking in about an employer employee
 
00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.710 align:start position:0%
talking in about an employer employee
relationship

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:27.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
uh again this is representative Pearson
 
00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:34.860 align:start position:0%
as I read this no individual
 
00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
shall be denied benefits of Rights
 
00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:41.820 align:start position:0%
um what about children in going to
 
00:18:45.409 --> 00:18:45.419 align:start position:0%
school where there is a mandate for
 
00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:48.380 align:start position:0%
certain basic vaccines my own opinion is
 
00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
this can go way way too far but there
 
00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
are certain basic vaccines that
 
00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:55.860 align:start position:0%
virtually all school systems agree to as
 
00:18:58.730 --> 00:18:58.740 align:start position:0%
I read this bill uh if a parent did not
 
00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:00.900 align:start position:0%
want that the child could not be denied
 
00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:04.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:06.770 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:06.780 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:09.669 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:19:09.669 --> 00:19:09.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:13.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of people out there who
 
00:19:18.409 --> 00:19:18.419 align:start position:0%
are denied access and they actually have
 
00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:20.220 align:start position:0%
to end up homeschooling or going to
 
00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:22.500 align:start position:0%
other schools because they don't want
 
00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:26.100 align:start position:0%
they refuse mandated vaccines
 
00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:26.930 align:start position:0%
they refuse mandated vaccines
um

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:26.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
I can remember when my child when the
 
00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:32.580 align:start position:0%
chickenpox don't think about mice is my
 
00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:35.460 align:start position:0%
pediatrician actually told me not to
 
00:19:37.789 --> 00:19:37.799 align:start position:0%
give my son the vaccine but to infect
 
00:19:37.799 --> 00:19:39.350 align:start position:0%
give my son the vaccine but to infect
him

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
him
 
00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:40.740 align:start position:0%
um and now I know that's a normal
 
00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:44.340 align:start position:0%
vaccine that's required to go to school
 
00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:46.010 align:start position:0%
vaccine that's required to go to school
so

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:19:48.289 --> 00:19:48.299 align:start position:0%
um you know there's different
 
00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
even within the medical profession
 
00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:51.780 align:start position:0%
there's different
 
00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
um ideas of what should be mandated and
 
00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:56.460 align:start position:0%
what shouldn't be and I I know there's
 
00:20:00.529 --> 00:20:00.539 align:start position:0%
probably a set standard but if you base
 
00:20:00.539 --> 00:20:01.669 align:start position:0%
probably a set standard but if you base
it

00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:04.740 align:start position:0%
s parents should be allowed to make they
 
00:20:06.169 --> 00:20:06.179 align:start position:0%
know their children and they should know
 
00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:08.340 align:start position:0%
what's best for their children
 
00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:11.460 align:start position:0%
um I mean you know do we make an
 
00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
exception for schools I don't know
 
00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
um but I think everyone should have the
 
00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:19.510 align:start position:0%
um but I think everyone should have the
choice

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
let's grant that every parent has the
 
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
right to keep
 
00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
the children from being vaccinated if
 
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
this bill were to pass
 
00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.370 align:start position:0%
this bill were to pass
then

00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:34.380 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
Hempstead Middle School's policy of
 
00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:40.860 align:start position:0%
mandatory vaccines for a child to attend
 
00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
is now gone we're not talking about the
 
00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:44.820 align:start position:0%
parents rights here yeah we're talking
 
00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:46.620 align:start position:0%
about the school's right to set policy
 
00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:49.320 align:start position:0%
if you do not get these vaccines you may
 
00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:52.260 align:start position:0%
not attend this school this bill would
 
00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:58.210 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:20:58.210 --> 00:20:58.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:04.500 align:start position:0%
um honestly I didn't really think of
 
00:21:06.169 --> 00:21:06.179 align:start position:0%
schools when I was talking about this
 
00:21:07.789 --> 00:21:07.799 align:start position:0%
because I wasn't looking at the school
 
00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
as a public
 
00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:11.090 align:start position:0%
as a public
um

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:11.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:14.340 align:start position:0%
place because to me it's just like the
 
00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:17.460 align:start position:0%
public cannot go into that school they
 
00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:20.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:21.900 align:start position:0%
um it's just with children and if you
 
00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:23.460 align:start position:0%
actually want to go into that school you
 
00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:25.980 align:start position:0%
have to go sign in because not anyone
 
00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:27.780 align:start position:0%
can walk into that school
 
00:21:30.289 --> 00:21:30.299 align:start position:0%
and children can already be exempt from
 
00:21:33.649 --> 00:21:33.659 align:start position:0%
vaccine vaccines based on religion
 
00:21:37.549 --> 00:21:37.559 align:start position:0%
they can do religious exemptions already
 
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
yeah but is it not true then that you're
 
00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:43.919 align:start position:0%
broadening the exemption to everyone and
 
00:21:47.029 --> 00:21:47.039 align:start position:0%
in terms of public school being public
 
00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:48.780 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to guess by its title it
 
00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:50.100 align:start position:0%
probably is
 
00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:51.710 align:start position:0%
probably is
okay

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:51.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:53.750 align:start position:0%
okay
um

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:58.010 --> 00:21:58.020 align:start position:0%
then I guess uh you would need to put an
 
00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
exemption in that it doesn't apply to
 
00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:05.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
that's the only answer I have
 
00:22:11.169 --> 00:22:11.179 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for um answering
 
00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:19.789 --> 00:22:19.799 align:start position:0%
today's environment many
 
00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:22.380 align:start position:0%
people offer to go in other words you
 
00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:25.260 align:start position:0%
could order product online
 
00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:26.820 align:start position:0%
um and you could actually show up and
 
00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:28.860 align:start position:0%
have it delivered to your car without
 
00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
having to actually go into an
 
00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:32.390 align:start position:0%
having to actually go into an
establishment

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
establishment
 
00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:33.900 align:start position:0%
um would that not
 
00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:35.580 align:start position:0%
take care of a lot of the issue because
 
00:22:37.789 --> 00:22:37.799 align:start position:0%
it still allows the person to order
 
00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
something without having to physically
 
00:22:42.529 --> 00:22:42.539 align:start position:0%
go into the store yet they can still do
 
00:22:44.029 --> 00:22:44.039 align:start position:0%
their shopping they can still obtain
 
00:22:46.789 --> 00:22:46.799 align:start position:0%
things that they need without violating
 
00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:49.740 align:start position:0%
the the establishment's concerns about
 
00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:52.740 align:start position:0%
public health would that not be a way to
 
00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:54.780 align:start position:0%
allow people to still be able to shop
 
00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:56.700 align:start position:0%
and do things that they want in normal
 
00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:58.390 align:start position:0%
and do things that they want in normal
Commerce

00:22:58.390 --> 00:22:58.400 align:start position:0%
Commerce
 
00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:01.140 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question uh
 
00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:04.580 align:start position:0%
representative uh so I understand
 
00:23:07.909 --> 00:23:07.919 align:start position:0%
why you would say that but they are
 
00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:09.900 align:start position:0%
being denied access to food and beverage
 
00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:11.990 align:start position:0%
being denied access to food and beverage
establishments

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
establishments
 
00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
and that is part of everyday living and
 
00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:17.400 align:start position:0%
that is part of
 
00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:18.049 align:start position:0%
that is part of
um

00:23:18.049 --> 00:23:18.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:20.580 align:start position:0%
you know human connection is really
 
00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:22.010 align:start position:0%
you know human connection is really
important

00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:22.020 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:23:30.549 --> 00:23:30.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman
 
00:23:34.909 --> 00:23:34.919 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:36.780 align:start position:0%
representative control
 
00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:40.260 align:start position:0%
um wouldn't you agree that this is this
 
00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:41.580 align:start position:0%
practice of
 
00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:43.500 align:start position:0%
um to speak to representative Merchant's
 
00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:47.580 align:start position:0%
question of uh making people who have
 
00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
medical conditions or psychological
 
00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:50.580 align:start position:0%
conditions maybe developmental
 
00:23:54.289 --> 00:23:54.299 align:start position:0%
disabilities or religious objection to
 
00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:56.460 align:start position:0%
um say wearing a face mask or accepting
 
00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
a vaccination this practice of of you
 
00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
know having them do curbside pickup or
 
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
not allowing them into establishments is
 
00:24:09.649 --> 00:24:09.659 align:start position:0%
is marginalizing a subset of society
 
00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:13.020 align:start position:0%
it's a population group based on you
 
00:24:14.029 --> 00:24:14.039 align:start position:0%
know their rights of conscious
 
00:24:18.529 --> 00:24:18.539 align:start position:0%
conscience or or medical needs wouldn't
 
00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
you say that that is
 
00:24:22.549 --> 00:24:22.559 align:start position:0%
um that's what this bill is for it's to
 
00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're not setting up
 
00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
two-tiered society that
 
00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:30.900 align:start position:0%
um where people who can or won't can or
 
00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:32.810 align:start position:0%
um where people who can or won't can or
will

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:32.820 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
um or do not object to certain Medical
 
00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.669 align:start position:0%
um or do not object to certain Medical
Treatments

00:24:37.669 --> 00:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
Treatments
 
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
are allowed to participate and those who
 
00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:43.260 align:start position:0%
can't who do object or can't
 
00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:46.740 align:start position:0%
for medical reasons are then not allowed
 
00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:49.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:51.529 --> 00:24:51.539 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative for the
 
00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
question so yes I mean
 
00:24:56.029 --> 00:24:56.039 align:start position:0%
I am seeing
 
00:24:57.909 --> 00:24:57.919 align:start position:0%
even in healthy people
 
00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:01.340 align:start position:0%
the that we have created
 
00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
a class is already in society today I'm
 
00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:08.120 align:start position:0%
looking I see the psychological damages
 
00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:11.460 align:start position:0%
that's happening with children I mean
 
00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:15.169 align:start position:0%
that's happening with children I mean
children

00:25:15.169 --> 00:25:15.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:17.029 --> 00:25:17.039 align:start position:0%
deal with emotion
 
00:25:19.789 --> 00:25:19.799 align:start position:0%
through facial uh you can see what's
 
00:25:21.169 --> 00:25:21.179 align:start position:0%
going on with the child when you can see
 
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
their facial expressions by making
 
00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:26.580 align:start position:0%
everyone emotionless in this Society is
 
00:25:29.149 --> 00:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
doing great harm
 
00:25:33.049 --> 00:25:33.059 align:start position:0%
um but that's a separate issue so
 
00:25:36.289 --> 00:25:36.299 align:start position:0%
I would say that yes we have created two
 
00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:38.940 align:start position:0%
classes of citizens and not only that
 
00:25:41.289 --> 00:25:41.299 align:start position:0%
because you're making people who cannot
 
00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
wear one if they go into a place
 
00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:49.020 align:start position:0%
the looks the stairs I mean they're made
 
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
to feel like a second rate
 
00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:53.700 align:start position:0%
person and that they don't deserve to be
 
00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
out in public
 
00:25:59.029 --> 00:25:59.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:01.380 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:02.820 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
um to speak to the issue about schools I
 
00:26:07.789 --> 00:26:07.799 align:start position:0%
think that
 
00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
your bill is sort of extending the
 
00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
exemptions that we provide we provide a
 
00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:16.260 align:start position:0%
religious exemption and we provide
 
00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
medical exemption for the requirements
 
00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
for school children to be vaccinated
 
00:26:24.649 --> 00:26:24.659 align:start position:0%
um so there are already unvaccinated
 
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
children in schools with vaccinated
 
00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:28.669 align:start position:0%
children in schools with vaccinated
children

00:26:28.669 --> 00:26:28.679 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:31.500 align:start position:0%
and intermingling they are not required
 
00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:35.640 align:start position:0%
to be you know marginalized we allow for
 
00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:37.380 align:start position:0%
that so that they're not discriminated
 
00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:38.940 align:start position:0%
against would you say that this bill is
 
00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:42.900 align:start position:0%
just expanding on that to the public
 
00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative and yes it
 
00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:49.740 align:start position:0%
is it's like I said nobody ever
 
00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
should be discriminated against for any
 
00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
reason and we have done that and I'm
 
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
seeing it I'm watching families being
 
00:26:59.510 --> 00:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
torn apart over this
 
00:27:01.909 --> 00:27:01.919 align:start position:0%
it is so sad what we have done to our
 
00:27:01.919 --> 00:27:05.630 align:start position:0%
it is so sad what we have done to our
society

00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:08.100 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative Co
 
00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:11.029 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative Co
Falls

00:27:11.029 --> 00:27:11.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:13.210 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:13.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:15.890 --> 00:27:15.900 align:start position:0%
representative I I wanted to ask about
 
00:27:18.049 --> 00:27:18.059 align:start position:0%
the the question
 
00:27:20.269 --> 00:27:20.279 align:start position:0%
concerning tuberculosis or a medical
 
00:27:20.279 --> 00:27:21.529 align:start position:0%
concerning tuberculosis or a medical
worker

00:27:21.529 --> 00:27:21.539 align:start position:0%
worker
 
00:27:22.909 --> 00:27:22.919 align:start position:0%
um would
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
medical professionals potentially be
 
00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
covered under
 
00:27:31.669 --> 00:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
Federal Regulation 29 CFR 1630 which
 
00:27:31.679 --> 00:27:32.890 align:start position:0%
Federal Regulation 29 CFR 1630 which
does

00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:32.900 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
essentially carve out a uh
 
00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:38.700 align:start position:0%
a scenario in which there is a direct
 
00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:40.149 align:start position:0%
a scenario in which there is a direct
threat

00:27:40.149 --> 00:27:40.159 align:start position:0%
threat
 
00:27:44.149 --> 00:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
and can call upon the uh the the
 
00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:49.260 align:start position:0%
employer to either demand treatment or
 
00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:50.870 align:start position:0%
employer to either demand treatment or
um

00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
or or not perform their duties as normal
 
00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
if there is a direct threat as opposed
 
00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
as as a result of a medical condition
 
00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
um do you believe that this uh this
 
00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:05.460 align:start position:0%
Federal Regulation would apply under
 
00:28:08.169 --> 00:28:08.179 align:start position:0%
these circumstances
 
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative colfeld for
 
00:28:12.529 --> 00:28:12.539 align:start position:0%
that and I am not familiar with that CFR
 
00:28:12.539 --> 00:28:14.149 align:start position:0%
that and I am not familiar with that CFR
directly

00:28:14.149 --> 00:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
directly
 
00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:17.340 align:start position:0%
um but I would assume yes because
 
00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:21.480 align:start position:0%
um I deal with public policy uh over in
 
00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:23.340 align:start position:0%
the environmental Agriculture and there
 
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
are certain guidelines where you know we
 
00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:28.260 align:start position:0%
have to be cognizant of Public Health
 
00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:31.740 align:start position:0%
um and that's very important and this is
 
00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
not to take away from what's already
 
00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
mandated uh in certain sections of code
 
00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:40.860 align:start position:0%
this is just to say you can't
 
00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:43.140 align:start position:0%
discriminate against people for not
 
00:28:45.649 --> 00:28:45.659 align:start position:0%
doing something
 
00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
it's not saying uh if someone has
 
00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:52.440 align:start position:0%
tuberculosis or a uh you know like a
 
00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
zoonotic disease or something that you
 
00:28:56.269 --> 00:28:56.279 align:start position:0%
can't treat it or that you shouldn't
 
00:28:58.010 --> 00:28:58.020 align:start position:0%
treat it
 
00:29:01.549 --> 00:29:01.559 align:start position:0%
it's saying stop
 
00:29:01.559 --> 00:29:03.950 align:start position:0%
it's saying stop
discriminating

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
discriminating
 
00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:08.940 align:start position:0%
because people cannot where
 
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
a medical device or do not want to take
 
00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:14.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:18.610 --> 00:29:18.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:28.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question uh
 
00:29:33.409 --> 00:29:33.419 align:start position:0%
what you're doing what you're saying is
 
00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
that people who have certain beliefs
 
00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:38.820 align:start position:0%
have a right to make a choice and I
 
00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:41.460 align:start position:0%
think equally everybody else has a right
 
00:29:43.909 --> 00:29:43.919 align:start position:0%
to make a choice if you're a physically
 
00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:47.100 align:start position:0%
vulnerable person and you wear a mask
 
00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:49.260 align:start position:0%
and you choose to socially distance and
 
00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
you follow all the rules
 
00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:53.460 align:start position:0%
and this bill passes and I no longer
 
00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:55.620 align:start position:0%
have any guarantee that the rest of the
 
00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
people are not going to follow the rules
 
00:29:59.750 --> 00:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
that have been generally accepted
 
00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:02.100 align:start position:0%
doesn't that put me in a class that's
 
00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
being discriminated against I can Nola
 
00:30:07.810 --> 00:30:07.820 align:start position:0%
access a public uh
 
00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:10.500 align:start position:0%
building uh
 
00:30:12.529 --> 00:30:12.539 align:start position:0%
because I lack any guarantees I wouldn't
 
00:30:14.649 --> 00:30:14.659 align:start position:0%
be exposed to an extreme risk to myself
 
00:30:14.659 --> 00:30:16.269 align:start position:0%
be exposed to an extreme risk to myself
so

00:30:16.269 --> 00:30:16.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:19.620 align:start position:0%
your bill eliminates risk to one group
 
00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:22.200 align:start position:0%
of party but it creates discrimination
 
00:30:26.029 --> 00:30:26.039 align:start position:0%
against another whole group who you know
 
00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:28.140 align:start position:0%
really believe that they cannot access
 
00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
those buildings because it is no longer
 
00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:31.010 align:start position:0%
those buildings because it is no longer
safe

00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:31.020 align:start position:0%
safe
 
00:30:33.529 --> 00:30:33.539 align:start position:0%
and I'll add two words to that uh
 
00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you believe to make it a
 
00:30:39.409 --> 00:30:39.419 align:start position:0%
question Jubilee yes all right
 
00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
City representative I
 
00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:44.340 align:start position:0%
uh this bill has nothing to do with
 
00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
social distancing
 
00:30:48.289 --> 00:30:48.299 align:start position:0%
um so social distancing can stay in
 
00:30:48.299 --> 00:30:49.250 align:start position:0%
um so social distancing can stay in
place

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:49.260 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
but it does
 
00:30:54.889 --> 00:30:54.899 align:start position:0%
does have everything to do with equal
 
00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
access to a public place and I'm not
 
00:30:59.930 --> 00:30:59.940 align:start position:0%
saying that you cannot wear a mask I'm
 
00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:01.500 align:start position:0%
not saying that someone
 
00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:04.500 align:start position:0%
can't wear a medical device or take a
 
00:31:06.409 --> 00:31:06.419 align:start position:0%
vaccine I'm just saying that there are
 
00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
there are other people out there and
 
00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:10.669 align:start position:0%
there are other people out there and
that

00:31:10.669 --> 00:31:10.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:13.380 align:start position:0%
cannot wear a mat a medical device or do
 
00:31:15.409 --> 00:31:15.419 align:start position:0%
not want to take the mandated vaccine we
 
00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
should be eat we should be able to
 
00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:20.220 align:start position:0%
coexist if you choose to wear a mask
 
00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:22.559 align:start position:0%
you're protecting yourself and if you're
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
practicing social distancing because
 
00:31:25.669 --> 00:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
this has nothing to do with social
 
00:31:25.679 --> 00:31:26.990 align:start position:0%
this has nothing to do with social
distancing

00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
distancing
 
00:31:30.529 --> 00:31:30.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:33.289 --> 00:31:33.299 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:35.700 align:start position:0%
yes follow up
 
00:31:39.049 --> 00:31:39.059 align:start position:0%
I don't wear a mask to protect myself I
 
00:31:40.789 --> 00:31:40.799 align:start position:0%
wear a mask to protect everybody else
 
00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:42.260 align:start position:0%
around me
 
00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
and if I can't be sure that those people
 
00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
without a mask aren't ready to pass that
 
00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:49.740 align:start position:0%
illness on to me even if I am wearing a
 
00:31:51.529 --> 00:31:51.539 align:start position:0%
mask am I not being discriminated
 
00:31:51.539 --> 00:31:54.889 align:start position:0%
mask am I not being discriminated
against

00:31:54.889 --> 00:31:54.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:57.169 --> 00:31:57.179 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh for the
 
00:31:59.389 --> 00:31:59.399 align:start position:0%
question I don't believe that you're
 
00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
being discriminated against because no
 
00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
one's making you do one or the other or
 
00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:07.500 align:start position:0%
denying you access uh because you choose
 
00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:09.260 align:start position:0%
to wear a mask
 
00:32:11.389 --> 00:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
however you are being discriminated
 
00:32:13.549 --> 00:32:13.559 align:start position:0%
against if you choose not to
 
00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
and it is about discrimination and equal
 
00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.210 align:start position:0%
and it is about discrimination and equal
access

00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:17.220 align:start position:0%
access
 
00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:21.480 align:start position:0%
well I I must thank you that's that's an
 
00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:22.490 align:start position:0%
well I I must thank you that's that's an
answer

00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:22.500 align:start position:0%
answer
 
00:32:24.409 --> 00:32:24.419 align:start position:0%

00:32:26.029 --> 00:32:26.039 align:start position:0%
joined the meeting would you announce
 
00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:33.600 align:start position:0%

I'll get it

00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
okay this is representative Jim McCabe
 
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
I'm present in Concord and my office and

I just finished getting my

I just finished getting my
um

00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440 align:start position:0%

and I'm very pleased thank you very much
 
00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:21.240 align:start position:0%
welcome do you have a question
 
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:32.149 --> 00:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
no I lowered my hand Mr chairman
 
00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:34.740 align:start position:0%
then let me um ask another question this
 
00:33:36.549 --> 00:33:36.559 align:start position:0%
is representative Pearson and the chair
 
00:33:42.769 --> 00:33:42.779 align:start position:0%
my undergraduate degree was in uh
 
00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:46.500 align:start position:0%
and um so I'd like to recollect somebody
 
00:33:48.409 --> 00:33:48.419 align:start position:0%
in history about a hundred years ago
 
00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:50.820 align:start position:0%
named Mary Mallon
 
00:33:53.509 --> 00:33:53.519 align:start position:0%
we know her better it's Typhoid Mary
 
00:33:57.769 --> 00:33:57.779 align:start position:0%
and otm had three options as I see it
 
00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:01.500 align:start position:0%
maybe theoretically number one was to
 
00:34:04.549 --> 00:34:04.559 align:start position:0%
receive treatment until she was no
 
00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
longer contagious and in the meantime be
 
00:34:09.589 --> 00:34:09.599 align:start position:0%
quarantined or
 
00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
if she refused treatment she had the
 
00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:16.260 align:start position:0%
option to speak quarantined
 
00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:20.220 align:start position:0%
or third theoretical option
 
00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:25.800 align:start position:0%
she had the right to in fact we know at
 
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
least 53 people in typhoid and if this
 
00:34:32.629 --> 00:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
bill were to pass Typhoid Mary could
 
00:34:35.349 --> 00:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
have elected I think that third option
 
00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
and so my question to representative
 
00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
kantois is is this what you're intending
 
00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:44.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair for the question and
 
00:34:47.149 --> 00:34:47.159 align:start position:0%
no it is not what I'm intending I am not
 
00:34:50.869 --> 00:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
intending to say that if
 
00:34:53.329 --> 00:34:53.339 align:start position:0%
um you've been exposed to something or
 
00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:55.020 align:start position:0%
have a contagious disease that you
 
00:34:57.530 --> 00:34:57.540 align:start position:0%
should go out in public that is not what
 
00:34:58.910 --> 00:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
I am saying
 
00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:01.980 align:start position:0%
what I am saying is that a healthy human
 
00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:05.940 align:start position:0%
being should not be denied access
 
00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
because of their medical choice because
 
00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:09.780 align:start position:0%
of their choices
 
00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:14.460 align:start position:0%
now right now we have in place
 
00:35:16.849 --> 00:35:16.859 align:start position:0%
that if you are near
 
00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
somebody or have been in close contact
 
00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:22.140 align:start position:0%
with someone who has had uh tested
 
00:35:24.349 --> 00:35:24.359 align:start position:0%
positive for covid that you should
 
00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
quarantine or
 
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh or and not go out in public until you
 
00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
have had a have tested negative which I
 
00:35:35.329 --> 00:35:35.339 align:start position:0%
think is fair
 
00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
and no one is is denying that
 
00:35:41.450 --> 00:35:41.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
should you be in denied access to a
 
00:35:46.250 --> 00:35:46.260 align:start position:0%
public place a healthy human being
 
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
denied access
 
00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
follow-up I do not see the word healthy
 
00:35:56.329 --> 00:35:56.339 align:start position:0%
human the phrase healthy human being
 
00:35:58.790 --> 00:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
here what I do see on line eight is no
 
00:35:58.800 --> 00:35:59.930 align:start position:0%
here what I do see on line eight is no
individual

00:35:59.930 --> 00:35:59.940 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:03.780 align:start position:0%
shall be denied a right I refuse so so
 
00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
our friend here Mary Mallon could refuse
 
00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:10.079 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in here that says she
 
00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
has to be healthy coded to have these
 
00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:14.700 align:start position:0%
rights do you agree
 
00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:16.740 align:start position:0%
could you please
 
00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:19.609 align:start position:0%
could you please
sorry

00:36:19.609 --> 00:36:19.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:19.619 --> 00:36:20.630 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
that I need to I haven't I wasn't able
 
00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:27.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:29.460 align:start position:0%
she wasn't able to hear you all right
 
00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:33.780 align:start position:0%
let me continue or repeat it in line
 
00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:36.730 align:start position:0%
let me continue or repeat it in line
eight

00:36:36.730 --> 00:36:36.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:41.220 align:start position:0%
says no individuals shall be denied
 
00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:45.300 align:start position:0%
and I do not see the phrase no healthy
 
00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
human being or no individual who is
 
00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:51.660 align:start position:0%
tested negative it simply says no one
 
00:36:54.910 --> 00:36:54.920 align:start position:0%
shall be denied because they've refused
 
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
treatment so Mary Mallon AKA Typhoid
 
00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
Mary could be refused treatments and by
 
00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:07.020 align:start position:0%
this bill she's an individual who shall
 
00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:12.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:14.690 --> 00:37:14.700 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chair
 
00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:17.390 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chair
um

00:37:17.390 --> 00:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
I I guess I I can't really honestly
 
00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:22.440 align:start position:0%
answer that question because I mean
 
00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:23.940 align:start position:0%
we're talking about something in history
 
00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
and I don't I don't think that anybody
 
00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:28.980 align:start position:0%
and and this is my personal
 
00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:31.380 align:start position:0%
in good conscience would go out and
 
00:37:35.089 --> 00:37:35.099 align:start position:0%
infect people on purpose
 
00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
I just don't see that happening in
 
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
today's world but maybe I'm wrong
 
00:37:43.849 --> 00:37:43.859 align:start position:0%
I do believe that healthy people should
 
00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro thank you Mr
 
00:37:55.730 --> 00:37:55.740 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative
 
00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:56.630 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative
um

00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:58.670 --> 00:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
you've spoken
 
00:38:00.829 --> 00:38:00.839 align:start position:0%
um eloquently about the types of
 
00:38:03.770 --> 00:38:03.780 align:start position:0%
psychological and material harm done to
 
00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
people through
 
00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:08.280 align:start position:0%
um what you describe as discrimination
 
00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:09.710 align:start position:0%
um what you describe as discrimination
um

00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:09.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:11.829 --> 00:38:11.839 align:start position:0%
so I am wondering
 
00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
in order for us to better understand how
 
00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
much of a problem this is are you aware
 
00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:18.660 align:start position:0%
of any
 
00:38:21.470 --> 00:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
more objective collection of data about
 
00:38:23.329 --> 00:38:23.339 align:start position:0%
people who feel discriminated against
 
00:38:26.329 --> 00:38:26.339 align:start position:0%
because of this any kind of surveys that
 
00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:28.380 align:start position:0%
have been taken or places where
 
00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
complaints are made but any kind of
 
00:38:34.430 --> 00:38:34.440 align:start position:0%
information that we could have that
 
00:38:38.569 --> 00:38:38.579 align:start position:0%
would tell us how big a problem this is
 
00:38:41.210 --> 00:38:41.220 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:42.950 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
representative

00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:45.180 align:start position:0%
um I know of uh
 
00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:49.020 align:start position:0%
some establishments where
 
00:38:55.730 --> 00:38:55.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:57.650 --> 00:38:57.660 align:start position:0%
go in
 
00:39:01.490 --> 00:39:01.500 align:start position:0%
um with a disability and a food and
 
00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:03.660 align:start position:0%
beverage establishment
 
00:39:08.089 --> 00:39:08.099 align:start position:0%
um and the establishment uh called
 
00:39:08.099 --> 00:39:09.349 align:start position:0%
um and the establishment uh called
um

00:39:09.349 --> 00:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:12.589 --> 00:39:12.599 align:start position:0%
the AG's office on them
 
00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
um I know of an employee who had worked
 
00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:17.220 align:start position:0%
within a food and beverage establishment
 
00:39:19.370 --> 00:39:19.380 align:start position:0%
for over 20 years
 
00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:25.320 align:start position:0%
and uh the patrons uh she couldn't wear
 
00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
a cloth mask but worse shield and was
 
00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
discriminated against for that
 
00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:35.640 align:start position:0%
and had to cut her hours and I'm
 
00:39:37.310 --> 00:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
actually not sure if she is still
 
00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:40.380 align:start position:0%
employed because she was discriminated
 
00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
against because of a severe medical
 
00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:44.930 align:start position:0%
against because of a severe medical
condition

00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:44.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
um and this is an establishment that has
 
00:39:48.770 --> 00:39:48.780 align:start position:0%
been called on
 
00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:51.900 align:start position:0%
um if they saw one little infraction and
 
00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:54.720 align:start position:0%
there's not many because I've uh gone in
 
00:39:57.890 --> 00:39:57.900 align:start position:0%
there and almost I would say 99 of the
 
00:39:59.810 --> 00:39:59.820 align:start position:0%
people are complying as well as the
 
00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
workers but the Discrimination is
 
00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
happening and that is just in one
 
00:40:05.930 --> 00:40:05.940 align:start position:0%
establishment that I know of personally
 
00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
I also know personally uh the uh folks
 
00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:11.160 align:start position:0%
that were discriminated against going
 
00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:13.740 align:start position:0%
into a grocery store and I know that
 
00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
because of that they won't go to a food
 
00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
establishment places because they have
 
00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:19.260 align:start position:0%
that medical condition where they can't
 
00:40:22.730 --> 00:40:22.740 align:start position:0%
go from the door to their seat
 
00:40:26.270 --> 00:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
so it is happening and if I know of two
 
00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
places that that's happening in My
 
00:40:30.829 --> 00:40:30.839 align:start position:0%
Little Neck of the Woods
 
00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
how many other places and how many other
 
00:40:35.089 --> 00:40:35.099 align:start position:0%
people is this happening to would be my
 
00:40:35.099 --> 00:40:35.870 align:start position:0%
people is this happening to would be my
question

00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:39.420 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up that is what I'm
 
00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:40.370 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up that is what I'm
asking

00:40:40.370 --> 00:40:40.380 align:start position:0%
asking
 
00:40:42.410 --> 00:40:42.420 align:start position:0%
um when you say
 
00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
you know how many other places is it
 
00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:45.470 align:start position:0%
you know how many other places is it
happening

00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
happening
 
00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:46.430 align:start position:0%
happening
um

00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:48.170 --> 00:40:48.180 align:start position:0%
that's the question I'm asking because
 
00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to be asked to vote on this
 
00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:53.060 align:start position:0%
and weigh a certain kind of public good
 
00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:54.910 align:start position:0%
and weigh a certain kind of public good
versus

00:40:54.910 --> 00:40:54.920 align:start position:0%
versus
 
00:40:58.490 --> 00:40:58.500 align:start position:0%
individual freedom and
 
00:41:00.829 --> 00:41:00.839 align:start position:0%
um I'm trying to get a sense if we have
 
00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:03.720 align:start position:0%
an understanding of how much this is
 
00:41:05.569 --> 00:41:05.579 align:start position:0%
happening and how many people are
 
00:41:05.579 --> 00:41:07.069 align:start position:0%
happening and how many people are
affected

00:41:07.069 --> 00:41:07.079 align:start position:0%
affected
 
00:41:07.079 --> 00:41:08.210 align:start position:0%
affected
um

00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:08.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:09.829 --> 00:41:09.839 align:start position:0%
but I guess
 
00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
I would understand if there is no
 
00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
objective collection of that kind of
 
00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:16.200 align:start position:0%
data which it sounds like there isn't
 
00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:17.640 align:start position:0%
that you know of
 
00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Representative no I do not
 
00:41:23.569 --> 00:41:23.579 align:start position:0%
know of any uh data at this time
 
00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:26.700 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative gay
 
00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I actually have
 
00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
four questions so if you'll let me just
 
00:41:33.650 --> 00:41:33.660 align:start position:0%
say them all at once you can answer them
 
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
however you'd like would that be okay
 
00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:38.630 align:start position:0%
however you'd like would that be okay
yes

00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:41:40.730 --> 00:41:40.740 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
if I understand right this bill is not
 
00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:47.640 align:start position:0%
affecting rules on social distancing at
 
00:41:51.530 --> 00:41:51.540 align:start position:0%
all that's question one number two
 
00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
our employees who are sick
 
00:41:58.730 --> 00:41:58.740 align:start position:0%
already not permitted to work
 
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
again I don't think uh I oh and would
 
00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:05.460 align:start position:0%
you approve of um
 
00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
um an amendment that just added to or
 
00:42:12.069 --> 00:42:12.079 align:start position:0%
they have declined a medical treatment
 
00:42:15.109 --> 00:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
adding the words for an active
 
00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:17.720 align:start position:0%
communicable disease
 
00:42:21.109 --> 00:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
OLS is fast so would that be okay would
 
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
that cover the concerns of allowing
 
00:42:27.109 --> 00:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
someone to come in who's six
 
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh isn't it um non-discriminatory
 
00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:35.880 align:start position:0%
to allow no masks no vaccines
 
00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:40.380 align:start position:0%
because everyone else has the choice to
 
00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:43.260 align:start position:0%
wear a mask or have a vaccine and we've
 
00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:45.480 align:start position:0%
been told repeatedly that we should wear
 
00:42:48.829 --> 00:42:48.839 align:start position:0%
masks to protect ourselves as well as
 
00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:50.720 align:start position:0%
other people
 
00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:54.300 align:start position:0%
so I think that covers my four my four
 
00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:57.430 align:start position:0%
so I think that covers my four my four
questions

00:42:57.430 --> 00:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:59.870 --> 00:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
um and yes I would be amenable to the uh
 
00:43:08.809 --> 00:43:08.819 align:start position:0%
Amendment and it is true
 
00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
um on most on all your points that you
 
00:43:12.349 --> 00:43:12.359 align:start position:0%
spoke to
 
00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
um you know we have to understand that
 
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
there are people with disabilities that
 
00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:21.839 align:start position:0%
this mandate is doing harm to and
 
00:43:23.930 --> 00:43:23.940 align:start position:0%
although people say there are exemptions
 
00:43:26.930 --> 00:43:26.940 align:start position:0%
under the Ada there is not because
 
00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:29.720 align:start position:0%
the federal guidelines say that it
 
00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:34.200 align:start position:0%
disabilities are not uh Gone Away under
 
00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:35.210 align:start position:0%
disabilities are not uh Gone Away under
this

00:43:35.210 --> 00:43:35.220 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:37.800 align:start position:0%
so people are being discriminated all
 
00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:46.309 --> 00:43:46.319 align:start position:0%

or statutes that would nullify this bill
 
00:44:47.329 --> 00:44:47.339 align:start position:0%

um are you aware of the statute language
 
00:45:08.690 --> 00:45:08.700 align:start position:0%
and RSA 141c that requires those who are
 
00:45:12.410 --> 00:45:12.420 align:start position:0%
ill with a communicable disease to be
 
00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:15.470 align:start position:0%

thank you follow up follow up
 
00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
so with this this law then would not
 
00:45:31.309 --> 00:45:31.319 align:start position:0%
override that requirement for certain
 
00:45:34.430 --> 00:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
communical disease and
 
00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:36.060 align:start position:0%

00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:37.430 align:start position:0%
um the commissioner does have that
ability

00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
ability
 
00:45:39.109 --> 00:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
um to quarantine someone who they
 
00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:42.180 align:start position:0%
believe is a threat and
 
00:45:45.109 --> 00:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
um on that subject
 
00:45:47.210 --> 00:45:47.220 align:start position:0%
would you say that Society is kind of
 
00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:49.260 align:start position:0%
tilting into
 
00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:51.720 align:start position:0%
um a position where people are are
 
00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:55.310 align:start position:0%
deemed sick until proven healthy
 
00:45:55.310 --> 00:45:58.190 align:start position:0%

[Music]

00:45:58.190 --> 00:45:58.200 align:start position:0%

thank you representative for the
 
00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
question I wouldn't go
 
00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:02.170 align:start position:0%
question I wouldn't go
um

00:46:02.170 --> 00:46:02.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
yes the commission the HHS commissioner
 
00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:07.740 align:start position:0%
does have the ability to quarantine an
 
00:46:11.089 --> 00:46:11.099 align:start position:0%
individual that is true I don't know if
 
00:46:14.329 --> 00:46:14.339 align:start position:0%
Society has tilted that far yet
 
00:46:14.339 --> 00:46:15.890 align:start position:0%
Society has tilted that far yet
however

00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:15.900 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:46:18.770 --> 00:46:18.780 align:start position:0%
uh fear has been instilled into the
 
00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:20.030 align:start position:0%
uh fear has been instilled into the
populace

00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
populace
 
00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
um and I am very concerned of the
 
00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:25.260 align:start position:0%
psychological effects that it is having
 
00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
on our our populist
 
00:46:30.650 --> 00:46:30.660 align:start position:0%
um as we speak
 
00:46:33.770 --> 00:46:33.780 align:start position:0%
and I see what it is doing to uh
 
00:46:35.930 --> 00:46:35.940 align:start position:0%
children we see a rise in emergency room
 
00:46:39.550 --> 00:46:39.560 align:start position:0%
cases due to uh
 
00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
thoughts of suicide and depression for
 
00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:44.270 align:start position:0%
thoughts of suicide and depression for
kids

00:46:44.270 --> 00:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
kids
 
00:46:46.309 --> 00:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
um that is a fact that was reported in a
 
00:46:48.349 --> 00:46:48.359 align:start position:0%
local newspaper
 
00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
um so all of this is being that is
 
00:46:57.290 --> 00:46:57.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:59.390 --> 00:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
seeing no further hands up from the
 
00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:00.720 align:start position:0%

too many dizzying details really try to
 
00:48:36.530 --> 00:48:36.540 align:start position:0%
to sum up uh my testimony
 
00:48:38.030 --> 00:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
um I do need to go backwards a little
 
00:48:40.069 --> 00:48:40.079 align:start position:0%
bit to talk about the commission and
 
00:48:43.210 --> 00:48:43.220 align:start position:0%
then move as briskly as possible without
 
00:48:46.609 --> 00:48:46.619 align:start position:0%
moving too quickly into the topic I
 
00:48:48.589 --> 00:48:48.599 align:start position:0%
would pre-appreciate gravity please
 
00:48:48.599 --> 00:48:50.510 align:start position:0%
would pre-appreciate gravity please
absolutely

00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
00:48:52.490 --> 00:48:52.500 align:start position:0%
um for those of you who may not know the
 
00:48:54.170 --> 00:48:54.180 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Commission established in
 
00:48:59.390 --> 00:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
1965 is the enforcement agency for New
 
00:49:01.069 --> 00:49:01.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's laws against discrimination
 
00:49:04.210 --> 00:49:04.220 align:start position:0%
we cover employment public accommodation
 
00:49:06.970 --> 00:49:06.980 align:start position:0%
housing and education
 
00:49:11.050 --> 00:49:11.060 align:start position:0%
K-12 was added to our Statute in 2019.
 
00:49:13.849 --> 00:49:13.859 align:start position:0%
so just for the sake of the conversation
 
00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
I need to read to you two definitions
 
00:49:19.730 --> 00:49:19.740 align:start position:0%
for public accommodation and and then we
 
00:49:22.970 --> 00:49:22.980 align:start position:0%
can move forward so in our statute which
 
00:49:26.690 --> 00:49:26.700 align:start position:0%
is RSA 354-a
 
00:49:29.530 --> 00:49:29.540 align:start position:0%
and the definition that I'll be reading
 
00:49:34.609 --> 00:49:34.619 align:start position:0%

Public
 
00:50:22.609 --> 00:50:22.619 align:start position:0%
and then there's a carve out for private
 
00:50:25.069 --> 00:50:25.079 align:start position:0%
clubs so that's fine and then the one
 
00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
other thing because this if this passes
 
00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
this goes into
 
00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:32.170 align:start position:0%
this goes into
um

00:50:32.170 --> 00:50:32.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:35.809 --> 00:50:35.819 align:start position:0%
354a 16.
 
00:50:39.890 --> 00:50:39.900 align:start position:0%
and 16 deals with undiscriminatory
 
00:50:43.010 --> 00:50:43.020 align:start position:0%
practices so there's a quite a bit there
 
00:50:46.490 --> 00:50:46.500 align:start position:0%
but in a nutshell
 
00:50:49.210 --> 00:50:49.220 align:start position:0%
what this tends to do and I appreciate
 
00:50:52.329 --> 00:50:52.339 align:start position:0%
representative comtwa's very passionate
 
00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
testimony and her patiently taking
 
00:50:57.470 --> 00:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
questions and answering those and
 
00:50:59.210 --> 00:50:59.220 align:start position:0%
wanting to look after the constituents
 
00:51:01.730 --> 00:51:01.740 align:start position:0%
that have contacted her
 
00:51:04.250 --> 00:51:04.260 align:start position:0%
um ultimately what this does is based on
 
00:51:06.410 --> 00:51:06.420 align:start position:0%
the language that's there it creates
 
00:51:09.650 --> 00:51:09.660 align:start position:0%
another protected class so usually a
 
00:51:11.690 --> 00:51:11.700 align:start position:0%
protected class is based on immutable
 
00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:14.280 align:start position:0%
characteristics and that's where we go
 
00:51:17.530 --> 00:51:17.540 align:start position:0%
with age your sex your gender identity
 
00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:20.220 align:start position:0%
sexual orientation those two were added
 
00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
more recently race religion color
 
00:51:25.490 --> 00:51:25.500 align:start position:0%
marital status physical or mental
 
00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:28.680 align:start position:0%
disability national origin those things
 
00:51:32.109 --> 00:51:32.119 align:start position:0%
are covered under our
 
00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
laws against discrimination which are in
 
00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
line with the federal laws against
 
00:51:41.210 --> 00:51:41.220 align:start position:0%
discrimination the 1964 Civil Rights Act
 
00:51:43.849 --> 00:51:43.859 align:start position:0%
we are a little more restrictive with
 
00:51:46.250 --> 00:51:46.260 align:start position:0%
gender identity so
 
00:51:48.770 --> 00:51:48.780 align:start position:0%
when you have what's written here
 
00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
you are saying regardless of my physical
 
00:51:56.210 --> 00:51:56.220 align:start position:0%
disability because I think that was
 
00:51:58.849 --> 00:51:58.859 align:start position:0%
where the representative come to all was
 
00:52:02.690 --> 00:52:02.700 align:start position:0%
trying to go this says anyone at any
 
00:52:04.970 --> 00:52:04.980 align:start position:0%
point can say
 
00:52:07.549 --> 00:52:07.559 align:start position:0%
I can't be discriminated quote unquote
 
00:52:09.530 --> 00:52:09.540 align:start position:0%
discriminated against for not
 
00:52:12.109 --> 00:52:12.119 align:start position:0%
participating in in these requirements
 
00:52:15.530 --> 00:52:15.540 align:start position:0%
and we already have the Ada
 
00:52:17.930 --> 00:52:17.940 align:start position:0%
which provides for that
 
00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
um if it's an employment setting then
 
00:52:22.549 --> 00:52:22.559 align:start position:0%
the employee has to have some level of
 
00:52:25.549 --> 00:52:25.559 align:start position:0%
conversation with the employer to work
 
00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
through what's called a reasonable
 
00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
accommodation and there are businesses
 
00:52:31.010 --> 00:52:31.020 align:start position:0%
that have created reasonable
 
00:52:33.829 --> 00:52:33.839 align:start position:0%
accommodations for people who have not
 
00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
been able to wear a mask or can only
 
00:52:39.109 --> 00:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
wear a shield to meet them at the curb
 
00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
in some places it doesn't matter what
 
00:52:44.690 --> 00:52:44.700 align:start position:0%
your physical condition is they will do
 
00:52:48.170 --> 00:52:48.180 align:start position:0%
curbside pickup and so what this is
 
00:52:51.530 --> 00:52:51.540 align:start position:0%
doing is it won't just affect the number
 
00:52:53.829 --> 00:52:53.839 align:start position:0%
of people that may have a disability
 
00:52:57.710 --> 00:52:57.720 align:start position:0%
this is open to every single person who
 
00:53:00.109 --> 00:53:00.119 align:start position:0%
wants to refuse a medical treatment
 
00:53:03.170 --> 00:53:03.180 align:start position:0%
refuse a medical test or a vaccination
 
00:53:07.790 --> 00:53:07.800 align:start position:0%
or a medical device and I'm not sure how
 
00:53:10.549 --> 00:53:10.559 align:start position:0%
you would get into HIPAA to determine if
 
00:53:12.530 --> 00:53:12.540 align:start position:0%
I don't want to wear a mask because I
 
00:53:15.049 --> 00:53:15.059 align:start position:0%
just don't want to but someone else
 
00:53:17.349 --> 00:53:17.359 align:start position:0%
can't wear a mask
 
00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
because of a medical condition that's
 
00:53:23.089 --> 00:53:23.099 align:start position:0%
personal information so I'm not quite
 
00:53:26.049 --> 00:53:26.059 align:start position:0%
sure how we how we square that Circle
 
00:53:29.390 --> 00:53:29.400 align:start position:0%
my looking at this certainly it would be
 
00:53:31.010 --> 00:53:31.020 align:start position:0%
something that would have to play out in
 
00:53:32.329 --> 00:53:32.339 align:start position:0%
the courts
 
00:53:32.339 --> 00:53:32.930 align:start position:0%
the courts
um

00:53:32.930 --> 00:53:32.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:34.930 --> 00:53:34.940 align:start position:0%
and if there were someone that were
 
00:53:38.030 --> 00:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
suing us because we didn't take a case
 
00:53:40.309 --> 00:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
the AG's office would have to make a
 
00:53:42.770 --> 00:53:42.780 align:start position:0%
determination but many businesses that
 
00:53:44.450 --> 00:53:44.460 align:start position:0%
are following the guidelines that have
 
00:53:46.730 --> 00:53:46.740 align:start position:0%
been presented and have the signs posted
 
00:53:48.670 --> 00:53:48.680 align:start position:0%
you can't come in without a mask etc
 
00:53:52.250 --> 00:53:52.260 align:start position:0%
those are things that are the law of the
 
00:53:54.530 --> 00:53:54.540 align:start position:0%
land and so they are in constant
 
00:53:55.730 --> 00:53:55.740 align:start position:0%
communication with the Attorney
 
00:53:57.650 --> 00:53:57.660 align:start position:0%
General's office who would then make
 
00:54:00.829 --> 00:54:00.839 align:start position:0%
that determination so to make this law
 
00:54:03.530 --> 00:54:03.540 align:start position:0%
sort of goes around what the Attorney
 
00:54:05.630 --> 00:54:05.640 align:start position:0%
General's office is doing and I don't
 
00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:07.130 align:start position:0%
General's office is doing and I don't
know

00:54:07.130 --> 00:54:07.140 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:54:07.140 --> 00:54:07.910 align:start position:0%
know
um

00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:09.829 --> 00:54:09.839 align:start position:0%
that would be a conversation to have
 
00:54:12.770 --> 00:54:12.780 align:start position:0%
with with the AG's office I certainly
 
00:54:15.650 --> 00:54:15.660 align:start position:0%
have more to say but I will pause here
 
00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
and I am absolutely open to any
 
00:54:20.569 --> 00:54:20.579 align:start position:0%
questions or clarifications needed I
 
00:54:22.490 --> 00:54:22.500 align:start position:0%
thank you all for your time and your
 
00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:23.870 align:start position:0%
thank you all for your time and your
patience

00:54:23.870 --> 00:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
patience
 
00:54:26.109 --> 00:54:26.119 align:start position:0%
the chair will now entertain
 
00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
questions for Ani Malachi and the
 
00:54:33.650 --> 00:54:33.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:35.400 align:start position:0%
and I believe that would be
 
00:54:37.490 --> 00:54:37.500 align:start position:0%
representative Woods
 
00:54:40.309 --> 00:54:40.319 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair uh just as an
 
00:54:43.069 --> 00:54:43.079 align:start position:0%
aside um I had my hand up for some time
 
00:54:45.170 --> 00:54:45.180 align:start position:0%
uh is there another way that I should
 
00:54:48.290 --> 00:54:48.300 align:start position:0%
use other than uh just raising my hand
 
00:54:51.650 --> 00:54:51.660 align:start position:0%
on the side uh in the zoom uh is there a
 
00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
better way for me to raise my hand I
 
00:54:56.510 --> 00:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
think this was a little accident from
 
00:54:59.089 --> 00:54:59.099 align:start position:0%
our normal very good procedure so I
 
00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:00.720 align:start position:0%
can't think of anything okay I thought
 
00:55:02.329 --> 00:55:02.339 align:start position:0%
it might be something but uh thank you
 
00:55:04.370 --> 00:55:04.380 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
question and either I might be able to
 
00:55:09.589 --> 00:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
answer it uh I I too had questions about
 
00:55:13.549 --> 00:55:13.559 align:start position:0%
uh um uh Typhoid Mary and the healthy
 
00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:16.200 align:start position:0%
individual uh the question that remains
 
00:55:19.549 --> 00:55:19.559 align:start position:0%
is uh does this apply uh to the
 
00:55:22.450 --> 00:55:22.460 align:start position:0%
vaccination card to get on an airplane
 
00:55:26.329 --> 00:55:26.339 align:start position:0%
at Manchester Airport and the use of
 
00:55:30.170 --> 00:55:30.180 align:start position:0%
masks uh in in that venue
 
00:55:32.089 --> 00:55:32.099 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your question
 
00:55:32.099 --> 00:55:34.130 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your question
representative

00:55:34.130 --> 00:55:34.140 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:55:37.549 --> 00:55:37.559 align:start position:0%
um I would like to say yes on that
 
00:55:41.630 --> 00:55:41.640 align:start position:0%
but my guess is going to be because you
 
00:55:46.069 --> 00:55:46.079 align:start position:0%
are leading one States going to another
 
00:55:50.210 --> 00:55:50.220 align:start position:0%
um what we dictate here would also have
 
00:55:54.170 --> 00:55:54.180 align:start position:0%
to be applied in everything being flown
 
00:55:57.290 --> 00:55:57.300 align:start position:0%
over so I can't honestly say that that
 
00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
would apply uh
 
00:56:06.290 --> 00:56:06.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:10.089 --> 00:56:10.099 align:start position:0%
now any questions for Annie Malachi
 
00:56:12.589 --> 00:56:12.599 align:start position:0%
and because of this going and
 
00:56:17.510 --> 00:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:19.910 --> 00:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman Ms Malachi
 
00:56:22.849 --> 00:56:22.859 align:start position:0%
relative to the 354a
 
00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
law that you refer to
 
00:56:27.950 --> 00:56:27.960 align:start position:0%
and knowing it's uh the specifics that
 
00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
the bill is addressing relative to a
 
00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:31.970 align:start position:0%
the bill is addressing relative to a
medical

00:56:31.970 --> 00:56:31.980 align:start position:0%
medical
 
00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
effect on our fellow citizens does do we
 
00:56:39.349 --> 00:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
have a precedent that provides
 
00:56:43.790 --> 00:56:43.800 align:start position:0%
a doorway for adjustments in this bill
 
00:56:48.290 --> 00:56:48.300 align:start position:0%
that is reflected in 354 810 number six
 
00:56:51.589 --> 00:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
uh specifically what that refers to is
 
00:56:55.809 --> 00:56:55.819 align:start position:0%
AIDS and the medical
 
00:56:58.069 --> 00:56:58.079 align:start position:0%
exemption not an exemption but statement
 
00:57:00.109 --> 00:57:00.119 align:start position:0%
that you couldn't discriminate if an
 
00:57:02.089 --> 00:57:02.099 align:start position:0%
individual had AIDS in preventing them
 
00:57:03.470 --> 00:57:03.480 align:start position:0%
from entering
 
00:57:06.410 --> 00:57:06.420 align:start position:0%
a space does this not apply or would
 
00:57:08.349 --> 00:57:08.359 align:start position:0%
that be similar to what is being
 
00:57:12.290 --> 00:57:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
um representative McMahon McMahon thank
 
00:57:15.650 --> 00:57:15.660 align:start position:0%
you very much for your question
 
00:57:17.690 --> 00:57:17.700 align:start position:0%
um I would actually have to take that up
 
00:57:19.549 --> 00:57:19.559 align:start position:0%
with the Attorney General's office to
 
00:57:23.030 --> 00:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
see if there's a a similarity
 
00:57:24.549 --> 00:57:24.559 align:start position:0%
um however
 
00:57:28.329 --> 00:57:28.339 align:start position:0%
this is specific to people that have
 
00:57:32.450 --> 00:57:32.460 align:start position:0%
one issue so that would be AIDS
 
00:57:34.430 --> 00:57:34.440 align:start position:0%
um this the the bill that we're
 
00:57:38.089 --> 00:57:38.099 align:start position:0%
discussing HP 506 is relative to anyone
 
00:57:41.870 --> 00:57:41.880 align:start position:0%
anywhere that would refuse to wear a
 
00:57:45.349 --> 00:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
mask to have a medical test to have
 
00:57:47.109 --> 00:57:47.119 align:start position:0%
medical treatment
 
00:57:50.329 --> 00:57:50.339 align:start position:0%
and not be able to
 
00:57:52.309 --> 00:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
um quote unquote discriminate against
 
00:57:54.910 --> 00:57:54.920 align:start position:0%
them so
 
00:57:58.910 --> 00:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
relative to AIDS that's one segment of
 
00:58:00.549 --> 00:58:00.559 align:start position:0%
the population
 
00:58:04.309 --> 00:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
whereas this bill is available to the
 
00:58:07.609 --> 00:58:07.619 align:start position:0%
entire population and
 
00:58:09.829 --> 00:58:09.839 align:start position:0%
um and then the other piece of that
 
00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
would be there could be a self uh excuse
 
00:58:14.990 --> 00:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
me a health and safety issue so if I
 
00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:16.190 align:start position:0%
me a health and safety issue so if I
have

00:58:16.190 --> 00:58:16.200 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:58:19.150 --> 00:58:19.160 align:start position:0%
um you know and we're in a pandemic so
 
00:58:22.010 --> 00:58:22.020 align:start position:0%
however you feel about that if you're
 
00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
looking at the um the ability of this uh
 
00:58:28.730 --> 00:58:28.740 align:start position:0%
disease to be communicable and then
 
00:58:31.130 --> 00:58:31.140 align:start position:0%
whatever information we know now to
 
00:58:34.210 --> 00:58:34.220 align:start position:0%
attempt to slow that down or stop that
 
00:58:37.250 --> 00:58:37.260 align:start position:0%
if I choose not to participate
 
00:58:39.950 --> 00:58:39.960 align:start position:0%
certainly that would be my choice but
 
00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
then we're removing the choice of an of
 
00:58:46.370 --> 00:58:46.380 align:start position:0%
a business to keep other customers as
 
00:58:49.010 --> 00:58:49.020 align:start position:0%
well as their employees safe and so a
 
00:58:51.650 --> 00:58:51.660 align:start position:0%
health and safety concern would be a
 
00:58:55.190 --> 00:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
plausible defense for a business if it
 
00:58:57.910 --> 00:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
was an employee employer conversation
 
00:59:00.410 --> 00:59:00.420 align:start position:0%
that would be something if there was a
 
00:59:02.329 --> 00:59:02.339 align:start position:0%
charge of discrimination that we would
 
00:59:04.730 --> 00:59:04.740 align:start position:0%
take into consideration
 
00:59:06.890 --> 00:59:06.900 align:start position:0%
um so I'm not I'm hoping that I answered
 
00:59:11.630 --> 00:59:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:15.309 --> 00:59:15.319 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
00:59:18.589 --> 00:59:18.599 align:start position:0%
representative gay thank you Mr chairman
 
00:59:22.730 --> 00:59:22.740 align:start position:0%
uh Mrs malachite how do you feel about
 
00:59:27.049 --> 00:59:27.059 align:start position:0%
those of us who have hidden disabilities
 
00:59:29.150 --> 00:59:29.160 align:start position:0%
uh would that mean
 
00:59:31.250 --> 00:59:31.260 align:start position:0%
that in
 
00:59:33.589 --> 00:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
we would have to be card carrying
 
00:59:35.150 --> 00:59:35.160 align:start position:0%
disabled people
 
00:59:38.030 --> 00:59:38.040 align:start position:0%
in order to be covered and protected by
 
00:59:40.370 --> 00:59:40.380 align:start position:0%
bills like this
 
00:59:43.010 --> 00:59:43.020 align:start position:0%
um my allergies are hidden but they put
 
00:59:47.690 --> 00:59:47.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:50.569 --> 00:59:50.579 align:start position:0%
so I mean this sounds like to be proved
 
00:59:52.750 --> 00:59:52.760 align:start position:0%
to be considered protected by
 
00:59:55.430 --> 00:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
anti-discriminatory bills we would have
 
00:59:58.670 --> 00:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
to go get somebody to document that we
 
01:00:01.549 --> 01:00:01.559 align:start position:0%
are handicapped or disabled
 
01:00:04.010 --> 01:00:04.020 align:start position:0%
but if you're feeling about that
 
01:00:05.329 --> 01:00:05.339 align:start position:0%
um representative thank you for the
 
01:00:05.339 --> 01:00:06.589 align:start position:0%
um representative thank you for the
question

01:00:06.589 --> 01:00:06.599 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:00:09.829 --> 01:00:09.839 align:start position:0%
um to to be very transparent I I work
 
01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
really hard to leave my personal
 
01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
feelings out of the conversation and
 
01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
really look at the law as it stands to
 
01:00:20.329 --> 01:00:20.339 align:start position:0%
understand and interpret what the
 
01:00:23.089 --> 01:00:23.099 align:start position:0%
legislative body has instructed my
 
01:00:26.690 --> 01:00:26.700 align:start position:0%
agency to do and in so being I have to
 
01:00:29.150 --> 01:00:29.160 align:start position:0%
follow the rules that are here and we
 
01:00:31.010 --> 01:00:31.020 align:start position:0%
give guidance we have businesses that
 
01:00:33.170 --> 01:00:33.180 align:start position:0%
contact us we have individuals that
 
01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:35.160 align:start position:0%
contact us for guidance and we
 
01:00:37.370 --> 01:00:37.380 align:start position:0%
absolutely administer that guidance um
 
01:00:40.430 --> 01:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
not bearing on one side more so than the
 
01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
other to have to have a card of some
 
01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
sort to prove a disability based on your
 
01:00:49.309 --> 01:00:49.319 align:start position:0%
question that would be something that
 
01:00:51.109 --> 01:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
would be above my pay grade and would
 
01:00:52.730 --> 01:00:52.740 align:start position:0%
not at all be something that I would
 
01:00:54.829 --> 01:00:54.839 align:start position:0%
determine what I would do is if there
 
01:00:56.510 --> 01:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
was a law that stated one way or the
 
01:00:58.970 --> 01:00:58.980 align:start position:0%
other then we would follow that law and
 
01:01:01.549 --> 01:01:01.559 align:start position:0%
explain to individuals and businesses
 
01:01:04.549 --> 01:01:04.559 align:start position:0%
what their responsibility is to follow
 
01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
the law and and that is that is my that
 
01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:09.240 align:start position:0%
is my job that is my due diligence to
 
01:01:11.510 --> 01:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
make sure that that happens
 
01:01:13.970 --> 01:01:13.980 align:start position:0%
um the Ada is available for people and I
 
01:01:15.230 --> 01:01:15.240 align:start position:0%
do understand
 
01:01:18.430 --> 01:01:18.440 align:start position:0%
that some people's disabilities or
 
01:01:22.190 --> 01:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
illnesses are hidden but
 
01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that I can do to force
 
01:01:28.970 --> 01:01:28.980 align:start position:0%
someone to comply with the law I can
 
01:01:30.829 --> 01:01:30.839 align:start position:0%
explain what the law is make sure people
 
01:01:33.109 --> 01:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
understand what their rights are and for
 
01:01:35.030 --> 01:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
businesses to understand what their
 
01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
legal responsibilities are and then of
 
01:01:39.170 --> 01:01:39.180 align:start position:0%
course the Attorney General's office for
 
01:01:40.730 --> 01:01:40.740 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire will
 
01:01:43.730 --> 01:01:43.740 align:start position:0%
interpret those laws and further assist
 
01:01:46.130 --> 01:01:46.140 align:start position:0%
businesses and individuals in
 
01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
understanding what their
 
01:01:49.069 --> 01:01:49.079 align:start position:0%
responsibilities are and such has
 
01:01:51.589 --> 01:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
happened during this during this time as
 
01:01:53.630 --> 01:01:53.640 align:start position:0%
there were fines that were levied
 
01:01:55.730 --> 01:01:55.740 align:start position:0%
regarding businesses and and other
 
01:01:57.950 --> 01:01:57.960 align:start position:0%
issues so
 
01:01:57.960 --> 01:01:58.490 align:start position:0%
issues so
um

01:01:58.490 --> 01:01:58.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:02.089 --> 01:02:02.099 align:start position:0%
that would be the the most concise and
 
01:02:03.530 --> 01:02:03.540 align:start position:0%
most clear answer I could give you to
 
01:02:05.809 --> 01:02:05.819 align:start position:0%
that question thank you
 
01:02:08.030 --> 01:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
oh well
 
01:02:10.970 --> 01:02:10.980 align:start position:0%
I understand thank you for taking my
 
01:02:13.390 --> 01:02:13.400 align:start position:0%
question I I
 
01:02:16.370 --> 01:02:16.380 align:start position:0%
am trying to understand and accept that
 
01:02:19.069 --> 01:02:19.079 align:start position:0%
you are uh
 
01:02:22.130 --> 01:02:22.140 align:start position:0%
see what's the right word hindered uh
 
01:02:23.569 --> 01:02:23.579 align:start position:0%
you have
 
01:02:26.089 --> 01:02:26.099 align:start position:0%
strong responsibilities to follow the
 
01:02:26.099 --> 01:02:28.069 align:start position:0%
strong responsibilities to follow the
law

01:02:28.069 --> 01:02:28.079 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:02:30.349 --> 01:02:30.359 align:start position:0%
and yet they are
 
01:02:33.829 --> 01:02:33.839 align:start position:0%
putting you in a position are they not
 
01:02:37.970 --> 01:02:37.980 align:start position:0%
of commenting on a proposed law
 
01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
it sounds like it's kind of out of your
 
01:02:46.490 --> 01:02:46.500 align:start position:0%
uh area of responsibility and
 
01:02:49.309 --> 01:02:49.319 align:start position:0%
you know that I appreciate that you're
 
01:02:55.069 --> 01:02:55.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:58.670 --> 01:02:58.680 align:start position:0%
well that is that how how you feel that
 
01:03:02.210 --> 01:03:02.220 align:start position:0%
you must abide by the laws
 
01:03:05.690 --> 01:03:05.700 align:start position:0%
but yes this law is something different
 
01:03:08.690 --> 01:03:08.700 align:start position:0%
and so it's
 
01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:09.650 align:start position:0%
and so it's
it's

01:03:09.650 --> 01:03:09.660 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:03:13.789 --> 01:03:13.799 align:start position:0%
um not in your regular responsibility
 
01:03:17.030 --> 01:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:19.609 --> 01:03:19.619 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the follow-up question
 
01:03:22.849 --> 01:03:22.859 align:start position:0%
um anything relative to 354-a is my
 
01:03:24.650 --> 01:03:24.660 align:start position:0%
responsibility whether it's on the books
 
01:03:28.010 --> 01:03:28.020 align:start position:0%
or proposed and my duty here today is to
 
01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
advise or to inform the committee should
 
01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
this pass this is what we're looking at
 
01:03:37.970 --> 01:03:37.980 align:start position:0%
we're looking at everyone and anyone
 
01:03:42.170 --> 01:03:42.180 align:start position:0%
being able to refuse or decline medical
 
01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
treatment medical tests or vaccinations
 
01:03:48.289 --> 01:03:48.299 align:start position:0%
or medical devices it's not Rel it's not
 
01:03:50.349 --> 01:03:50.359 align:start position:0%
specific to people with disabilities
 
01:03:52.970 --> 01:03:52.980 align:start position:0%
whatever that disability is whether it's
 
01:03:56.569 --> 01:03:56.579 align:start position:0%
a physical disability so autism or
 
01:03:58.910 --> 01:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
someone that has a sensory issue whether
 
01:04:00.829 --> 01:04:00.839 align:start position:0%
it's someone that has a medical
 
01:04:03.170 --> 01:04:03.180 align:start position:0%
disability meaning allergies or
 
01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
emphysema Etc the CDC has guidance on on
 
01:04:10.270 --> 01:04:10.280 align:start position:0%
what businesses can do
 
01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
and so maybe there's a better way to
 
01:04:16.370 --> 01:04:16.380 align:start position:0%
communicate these things however there
 
01:04:18.829 --> 01:04:18.839 align:start position:0%
are competing interests so I'm the
 
01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
enforcer of the law well not me
 
01:04:23.569 --> 01:04:23.579 align:start position:0%
personally but my agency enforces the
 
01:04:25.730 --> 01:04:25.740 align:start position:0%
law as it is written
 
01:04:28.069 --> 01:04:28.079 align:start position:0%
the AG's office does their level of
 
01:04:30.589 --> 01:04:30.599 align:start position:0%
enforcement the CDC is providing
 
01:04:32.930 --> 01:04:32.940 align:start position:0%
information we have our Public Health
 
01:04:35.990 --> 01:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
officials providing information and I
 
01:04:37.309 --> 01:04:37.319 align:start position:0%
mean at the end of the day hopefully
 
01:04:39.650 --> 01:04:39.660 align:start position:0%
when however many people decide to
 
01:04:41.870 --> 01:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
become vaccinated or enough people have
 
01:04:43.970 --> 01:04:43.980 align:start position:0%
it and we have this herd immunity thing
 
01:04:46.970 --> 01:04:46.980 align:start position:0%
this is a non-issue but I look at this
 
01:04:50.569 --> 01:04:50.579 align:start position:0%
not relative to covid today but once the
 
01:04:53.270 --> 01:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
law is on the books what does this look
 
01:04:55.490 --> 01:04:55.500 align:start position:0%
like going forward
 
01:04:57.710 --> 01:04:57.720 align:start position:0%
um even though we're talking about a
 
01:04:59.589 --> 01:04:59.599 align:start position:0%
pandemic that is happening right now
 
01:05:02.030 --> 01:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
there are other things that may move
 
01:05:04.010 --> 01:05:04.020 align:start position:0%
forward and so
 
01:05:07.730 --> 01:05:07.740 align:start position:0%
if I have whatever I have I am not
 
01:05:11.030 --> 01:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
required to disclose that to anyone so I
 
01:05:13.549 --> 01:05:13.559 align:start position:0%
could have something else that's highly
 
01:05:16.069 --> 01:05:16.079 align:start position:0%
infectious and communicable and I decide
 
01:05:19.730 --> 01:05:19.740 align:start position:0%
that I don't want to wear a mask or
 
01:05:23.329 --> 01:05:23.339 align:start position:0%
um or or some other way to stop myself
 
01:05:26.930 --> 01:05:26.940 align:start position:0%
from spreading to others I could I could
 
01:05:31.069 --> 01:05:31.079 align:start position:0%
do that with the language as written the
 
01:05:34.069 --> 01:05:34.079 align:start position:0%
larger concern for me is making these
 
01:05:37.309 --> 01:05:37.319 align:start position:0%
individuals a protected class that adds
 
01:05:40.309 --> 01:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
another protected class to the list that
 
01:05:43.910 --> 01:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
we are currently responsible for where
 
01:05:46.490 --> 01:05:46.500 align:start position:0%
whereas there is the Ada that deals with
 
01:05:48.230 --> 01:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
people specifically with disabilities
 
01:05:50.690 --> 01:05:50.700 align:start position:0%
and the hope would be that businesses
 
01:05:53.210 --> 01:05:53.220 align:start position:0%
would work together with an individual
 
01:05:55.130 --> 01:05:55.140 align:start position:0%
that has a disability who cannot enter
 
01:05:58.250 --> 01:05:58.260 align:start position:0%
and find some common ground for that
 
01:06:00.950 --> 01:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
person to be able to participate with
 
01:06:04.670 --> 01:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
that restaurant or that business but you
 
01:06:07.250 --> 01:06:07.260 align:start position:0%
know as we know if people are staring
 
01:06:10.450 --> 01:06:10.460 align:start position:0%
and jeering or complaining about someone
 
01:06:13.370 --> 01:06:13.380 align:start position:0%
this bill does not stop
 
01:06:15.349 --> 01:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
the heart of someone
 
01:06:17.930 --> 01:06:17.940 align:start position:0%
so what we're looking at is entering
 
01:06:19.370 --> 01:06:19.380 align:start position:0%
public spaces
 
01:06:22.210 --> 01:06:22.220 align:start position:0%
and being charged with discrimination
 
01:06:25.130 --> 01:06:25.140 align:start position:0%
for the business potentially following
 
01:06:26.569 --> 01:06:26.579 align:start position:0%
the law
 
01:06:26.579 --> 01:06:28.690 align:start position:0%
the law
so

01:06:28.690 --> 01:06:28.700 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:06:33.049 --> 01:06:33.059 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:36.349 --> 01:06:36.359 align:start position:0%
anyone who hasn't spoken has a question
 
01:06:45.589 --> 01:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:47.390 --> 01:06:47.400 align:start position:0%
saying that I thank you for your
 
01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:49.010 align:start position:0%
saying that I thank you for your
testimony

01:06:49.010 --> 01:06:49.020 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:06:51.529 --> 01:06:51.539 align:start position:0%
and we do have a hearing at 10 o'clock
 
01:06:55.549 --> 01:06:55.559 align:start position:0%
and it is now 10 15. and the chair
 
01:06:55.559 --> 01:06:57.470 align:start position:0%
and it is now 10 15. and the chair
invokes

01:06:57.470 --> 01:06:57.480 align:start position:0%
invokes
 
01:06:59.870 --> 01:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
custom where there's numerous people
 
01:07:03.289 --> 01:07:03.299 align:start position:0%
willing to test or wanting to testify to
 
01:07:05.390 --> 01:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
put a time limit on that
 
01:07:07.789 --> 01:07:07.799 align:start position:0%
in the past when we've done this and it
 
01:07:10.849 --> 01:07:10.859 align:start position:0%
has been in the committee room it's
 
01:07:13.069 --> 01:07:13.079 align:start position:0%
quite easy for someone to hold up a sign
 
01:07:16.190 --> 01:07:16.200 align:start position:0%
saying you have half a minute left
 
01:07:20.569 --> 01:07:20.579 align:start position:0%
it's difficult to do it here and I've
 
01:07:22.549 --> 01:07:22.559 align:start position:0%
been wrestling with how to do it because
 
01:07:24.650 --> 01:07:24.660 align:start position:0%
the last time I did it we just simply
 
01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
had people's microphones cut off that
 
01:07:30.049 --> 01:07:30.059 align:start position:0%
left me unsatisfied and I'm sure left
 
01:07:32.329 --> 01:07:32.339 align:start position:0%
others even more so
 
01:07:35.450 --> 01:07:35.460 align:start position:0%
so I took counsel with people who've
 
01:07:37.789 --> 01:07:37.799 align:start position:0%
been here a long time and this is what
 
01:07:39.829 --> 01:07:39.839 align:start position:0%
they've suggested we do
 
01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
when we call on
 
01:07:43.789 --> 01:07:43.799 align:start position:0%
the people who have signed up indicating
 
01:07:45.770 --> 01:07:45.780 align:start position:0%
they wish to speak
 
01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
you will be given a certain time amounts
 
01:07:51.770 --> 01:07:51.780 align:start position:0%
and you'll be given a 15-minute warning
 
01:07:54.890 --> 01:07:54.900 align:start position:0%
so a 15 second warning so if you hear
 
01:07:58.430 --> 01:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
something that's spoken about as loudly
 
01:08:00.890 --> 01:08:00.900 align:start position:0%
as you're speaking that is your 15
 
01:08:04.130 --> 01:08:04.140 align:start position:0%
second warning which means you wrap it
 
01:08:07.069 --> 01:08:07.079 align:start position:0%
up and at two minutes your microphone
 
01:08:10.809 --> 01:08:10.819 align:start position:0%
goes off and you go to the next person
 
01:08:13.910 --> 01:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
we had a wonderful example last time of
 
01:08:17.269 --> 01:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
somebody who said three very powerful
 
01:08:20.570 --> 01:08:20.580 align:start position:0%
points in 38 seconds it can be done
 
01:08:23.209 --> 01:08:23.219 align:start position:0%
so with that understood
 
01:08:26.749 --> 01:08:26.759 align:start position:0%
um just to Christina are you uh watching
 
01:08:29.110 --> 01:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:32.090 --> 01:08:32.100 align:start position:0%
I am chairman I am also running two
 
01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
meetings though I'm sorry I can't hear
 
01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
you yes I am thank you so we're going to
 
01:08:41.689 --> 01:08:41.699 align:start position:0%
be giving each speaker two minutes
 
01:08:46.189 --> 01:08:46.199 align:start position:0%
and at a minute 45 if you could say 15
 
01:08:50.689 --> 01:08:50.699 align:start position:0%
seconds to go and then at two minutes uh
 
01:08:52.669 --> 01:08:52.679 align:start position:0%
we'll go on to the next person who's
 
01:08:55.010 --> 01:08:55.020 align:start position:0%
called would it be possible for
 
01:08:57.289 --> 01:08:57.299 align:start position:0%
representative Acton to do that only
 
01:08:59.090 --> 01:08:59.100 align:start position:0%
because I have two meetings going on at
 
01:09:01.070 --> 01:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
the same time and I I worry that I won't
 
01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
be able to uh to keep up
 
01:09:07.849 --> 01:09:07.859 align:start position:0%
my volunteer if you need a volunteer but
 
01:09:10.010 --> 01:09:10.020 align:start position:0%
if representative Acton is ready to go
 
01:09:13.189 --> 01:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
that's fine okay and we have you can go
 
01:09:16.610 --> 01:09:16.620 align:start position:0%

01:09:20.570 --> 01:09:20.580 align:start position:0%

01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:35.689 align:start position:0%

01:09:37.309 --> 01:09:37.319 align:start position:0%

01:09:48.050 --> 01:09:48.060 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm sorry if the next speaker could
 
01:09:50.749 --> 01:09:50.759 align:start position:0%
raise her hand uh we have uh 98 people
 
01:09:50.759 --> 01:09:51.910 align:start position:0%
raise her hand uh we have uh 98 people
in

01:09:51.910 --> 01:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:09:54.650 --> 01:09:54.660 align:start position:0%

01:09:57.229 --> 01:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
okay you're good thanks great thank you
 
01:09:59.870 --> 01:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
so much uh I appreciate this brief
 
01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:01.430 align:start position:0%
so much uh I appreciate this brief
opportunity

01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
01:10:02.930 --> 01:10:02.940 align:start position:0%
um I don't think there's any question
 
01:10:05.330 --> 01:10:05.340 align:start position:0%
that under Public Health laws state and
 
01:10:08.930 --> 01:10:08.940 align:start position:0%
federal one can isolate and one can um
 
01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
quarantine people who are proven to be
 
01:10:13.610 --> 01:10:13.620 align:start position:0%
infectious I think the issue really
 
01:10:16.970 --> 01:10:16.980 align:start position:0%
revolves around vaccines testing and
 
01:10:19.490 --> 01:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
masks all of which right now are
 
01:10:22.729 --> 01:10:22.739 align:start position:0%
considered emergency use authorization
 
01:10:26.330 --> 01:10:26.340 align:start position:0%
devices or products in other words none
 
01:10:29.090 --> 01:10:29.100 align:start position:0%
of those things for covid-19 have yet
 
01:10:31.669 --> 01:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
been proven to be effective they've been
 
01:10:33.470 --> 01:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
authorized and so I think the question
 
01:10:36.530 --> 01:10:36.540 align:start position:0%
to you as legislators is do you want to
 
01:10:39.649 --> 01:10:39.659 align:start position:0%
participate in creating a regime around
 
01:10:42.050 --> 01:10:42.060 align:start position:0%
separate but equal people who don't mask
 
01:10:44.390 --> 01:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
people who don't test people who don't
 
01:10:47.149 --> 01:10:47.159 align:start position:0%
vaccinate those regimes of separate but
 
01:10:49.550 --> 01:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
equal all are already being put in place
 
01:10:51.890 --> 01:10:51.900 align:start position:0%
around the world and even in New York
 
01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
City where I exist children who don't
 
01:10:56.689 --> 01:10:56.699 align:start position:0%
submit to testing which is not Urban to
 
01:10:58.669 --> 01:10:58.679 align:start position:0%
be correct or accurate for infectious
 
01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
status are being restricted from access
 
01:11:03.470 --> 01:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
to public school they must go into
 
01:11:05.870 --> 01:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
remote learning there's no question that
 
01:11:07.970 --> 01:11:07.980 align:start position:0%
remote learning is not equal to
 
01:11:10.010 --> 01:11:10.020 align:start position:0%
in-person learning and yet that is
 
01:11:12.169 --> 01:11:12.179 align:start position:0%
what's happening so I would urge you to
 
01:11:14.990 --> 01:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
consider very carefully do you want to
 
01:11:16.610 --> 01:11:16.620 align:start position:0%
create that kind of society where
 
01:11:18.649 --> 01:11:18.659 align:start position:0%
someone won't wear a mask or they won't
 
01:11:20.270 --> 01:11:20.280 align:start position:0%
submit to testing or they won't be
 
01:11:23.090 --> 01:11:23.100 align:start position:0%
vaccinated they are in effect put into
 
01:11:27.010 --> 01:11:27.020 align:start position:0%
internal Exile that's the issue
 
01:11:29.630 --> 01:11:29.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:11:31.970 --> 01:11:31.980 align:start position:0%

brief

01:12:05.570 --> 01:12:05.580 align:start position:0%
brief
 
01:12:07.850 --> 01:12:07.860 align:start position:0%
um growing up in this great nation and
 
01:12:09.709 --> 01:12:09.719 align:start position:0%
especially in New Hampshire I've always
 
01:12:12.350 --> 01:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
known that America is special The Beacon
 
01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
of Hope to the world I have taken for
 
01:12:16.910 --> 01:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
granted my freedom and my liberties
 
01:12:19.430 --> 01:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
now that I'm in my 50s time has taught
 
01:12:21.530 --> 01:12:21.540 align:start position:0%
me that when we give up freedoms and
 
01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
Liberties it's very hard if not
 
01:12:26.810 --> 01:12:26.820 align:start position:0%
impossible to get them back I'm an avid
 
01:12:28.550 --> 01:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
believer in the Constitution of the
 
01:12:30.649 --> 01:12:30.659 align:start position:0%
United States and the constitution of
 
01:12:33.290 --> 01:12:33.300 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire our countries are other
 
01:12:35.330 --> 01:12:35.340 align:start position:0%
countries are forcing their people to
 
01:12:37.189 --> 01:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
fall in line with this idea that in
 
01:12:39.470 --> 01:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
order to be free you must do what we say
 
01:12:42.229 --> 01:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
first that's not the way America does it
 
01:12:44.090 --> 01:12:44.100 align:start position:0%
and it's definitely not the way New
 
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does it you can look through
 
01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
the Constitution forever and you will
 
01:12:49.610 --> 01:12:49.620 align:start position:0%
never find anything that would oppose
 
01:12:51.770 --> 01:12:51.780 align:start position:0%
this bill it is right in line with our
 
01:12:53.990 --> 01:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
great Constitution when I think
 
01:12:55.669 --> 01:12:55.679 align:start position:0%
historically about the times where
 
01:12:57.770 --> 01:12:57.780 align:start position:0%
having Freedom relied on doing what
 
01:12:59.630 --> 01:12:59.640 align:start position:0%
you're told it was the beginning of the
 
01:13:02.390 --> 01:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
end for all freedoms we all know the
 
01:13:04.070 --> 01:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
countries and oppressed people I speak
 
01:13:06.530 --> 01:13:06.540 align:start position:0%
of thank you so much for this bill and
 
01:13:08.689 --> 01:13:08.699 align:start position:0%
this opportunity to support it Live Free
 
01:13:12.169 --> 01:13:12.179 align:start position:0%
or Die I only have a follow-up thing a
 
01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
couple of things for representative
 
01:13:16.610 --> 01:13:16.620 align:start position:0%
Shapiro because I happen to live in the
 
01:13:17.890 --> 01:13:17.900 align:start position:0%
king area
 
01:13:20.270 --> 01:13:20.280 align:start position:0%
in the Keen Sentinel there was an
 
01:13:22.189 --> 01:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
article about a mother who had her baby
 
01:13:24.110 --> 01:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
in a pack in front of her she went into
 
01:13:27.770 --> 01:13:27.780 align:start position:0%
the Monadnock food co-op and the baby
 
01:13:29.870 --> 01:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
was fussing she had to take down her
 
01:13:33.410 --> 01:13:33.420 align:start position:0%
mask briefly to speak to it and she took
 
01:13:35.149 --> 01:13:35.159 align:start position:0%
to try and calm the baby
 
01:13:39.290 --> 01:13:39.300 align:start position:0%
and she was followed harassed yelled at
 
01:13:41.630 --> 01:13:41.640 align:start position:0%
humiliated in public they called the
 
01:13:45.410 --> 01:13:45.420 align:start position:0%
police on her it was it was a horrific
 
01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
scene according to her
 
01:13:50.810 --> 01:13:50.820 align:start position:0%
um my last thing as a registered nurse
 
01:13:52.910 --> 01:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
who works in Massachusetts on a coven
 
01:13:55.550 --> 01:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
unit I can tell you that out in the
 
01:13:58.130 --> 01:13:58.140 align:start position:0%
public we should have a greater fear of
 
01:14:02.450 --> 01:14:02.460 align:start position:0%
picking up MRSA mssa C diff uh staff
 
01:14:05.030 --> 01:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
those sort of things then what a mask
 
01:14:08.990 --> 01:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
can protect us in the community
 
01:14:12.590 --> 01:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you the chair recognizes
 
01:14:15.169 --> 01:14:15.179 align:start position:0%

01:14:18.590 --> 01:14:18.600 align:start position:0%

01:14:36.130 --> 01:14:36.140 align:start position:0%
surveillance
 
01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
she said she's muted
 
01:14:43.570 --> 01:14:43.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:46.250 --> 01:14:46.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:14:48.229 --> 01:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
um an honorable representatives for
 
01:14:50.630 --> 01:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
offering me the opportunity to speak I'm
 
01:14:52.390 --> 01:14:52.400 align:start position:0%
here to share testimony to support
 
01:14:54.290 --> 01:14:54.300 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination on the basis of
 
01:14:55.910 --> 01:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
medical choice
 
01:14:57.709 --> 01:14:57.719 align:start position:0%
there are many reasons I am in support
 
01:14:59.750 --> 01:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
of non-discrimination but for today I
 
01:15:01.970 --> 01:15:01.980 align:start position:0%
would like to focus on two points first
 
01:15:03.590 --> 01:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
the importance of approaching medical
 
01:15:06.169 --> 01:15:06.179 align:start position:0%
Choice with cultural humility and
 
01:15:06.179 --> 01:15:07.610 align:start position:0%
Choice with cultural humility and
responsiveness

01:15:07.610 --> 01:15:07.620 align:start position:0%
responsiveness
 
01:15:09.649 --> 01:15:09.659 align:start position:0%
and second the need for True informed
 
01:15:09.659 --> 01:15:12.050 align:start position:0%
and second the need for True informed
consent

01:15:12.050 --> 01:15:12.060 align:start position:0%
consent
 
01:15:13.490 --> 01:15:13.500 align:start position:0%
first I'd like to speak to the
 
01:15:15.169 --> 01:15:15.179 align:start position:0%
importance of cultural humility and
 
01:15:16.910 --> 01:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
responsiveness as it relates to
 
01:15:18.950 --> 01:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
supporting individuals and making their
 
01:15:21.830 --> 01:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
own medical choices I stand with my
 
01:15:24.110 --> 01:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
peers who consistently advocate for the
 
01:15:26.270 --> 01:15:26.280 align:start position:0%
importance of self-reflection awareness
 
01:15:28.910 --> 01:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
of our own viewpoints and humble
 
01:15:30.890 --> 01:15:30.900 align:start position:0%
recognition that our ways of viewing the
 
01:15:33.830 --> 01:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
world are not shared by all and that is
 
01:15:36.410 --> 01:15:36.420 align:start position:0%
incumbent upon us to be responsive to
 
01:15:38.750 --> 01:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
those with cultural differences even
 
01:15:40.970 --> 01:15:40.980 align:start position:0%
when their voices may be few and even
 
01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
when we may not understand the
 
01:15:45.590 --> 01:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
perspectives they represent in the past
 
01:15:47.510 --> 01:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
year it has become obvious that there is
 
01:15:49.669 --> 01:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
a dominant Health ideology that is
 
01:15:52.130 --> 01:15:52.140 align:start position:0%
sought to eliminate all alternative ways
 
01:15:55.610 --> 01:15:55.620 align:start position:0%
of thinking and seeing Life Death health
 
01:15:58.550 --> 01:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
and well-being instead of responding to
 
01:16:00.890 --> 01:16:00.900 align:start position:0%
a novel situation with humility and
 
01:16:04.070 --> 01:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
openness to cultural religious
 
01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
an indigenous approaches to health we
 
01:16:08.630 --> 01:16:08.640 align:start position:0%
have instead entered a realm of
 
01:16:11.390 --> 01:16:11.400 align:start position:0%
centralized authoritarian Health
 
01:16:14.630 --> 01:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
dictates which seek to shame silence and
 
01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
marginalize all of those who disagree
 
01:16:19.490 --> 01:16:19.500 align:start position:0%
instead of responding to a novel
 
01:16:21.649 --> 01:16:21.659 align:start position:0%
situation by honoring the creative
 
01:16:24.350 --> 01:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
potential of our neighbors as fellow
 
01:16:27.169 --> 01:16:27.179 align:start position:0%
souls to come together to express and
 
01:16:29.689 --> 01:16:29.699 align:start position:0%
share their inherent Health wisdom
 
01:16:31.850 --> 01:16:31.860 align:start position:0%
the public health authorities have shut
 
01:16:34.490 --> 01:16:34.500 align:start position:0%
down channels of communication and
 
01:16:36.649 --> 01:16:36.659 align:start position:0%
minority perspectives who have dared to
 
01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
share hope optimism and encouragement
 
01:16:41.689 --> 01:16:41.699 align:start position:0%
I'll close by saying it is not in our
 
01:16:44.330 --> 01:16:44.340 align:start position:0%
true nature to coerce our neighbors to
 
01:16:46.729 --> 01:16:46.739 align:start position:0%
ignore their inherent Health wisdom nor
 
01:16:48.410 --> 01:16:48.420 align:start position:0%
should we insist they make specific
 
01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
Health choices to engage in society
 
01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much
 
01:16:57.410 --> 01:16:57.420 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes David Smith Esquire
 
01:17:10.910 --> 01:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:13.250 --> 01:17:13.260 align:start position:0%
good morning can you hear me yes okay
 
01:17:14.510 --> 01:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you so much I'm

good morning thank you so much I'm
representative

01:17:16.669 --> 01:17:16.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:17:19.870 --> 01:17:19.880 align:start position:0%
and uh in support of this legislation
 
01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
the genocide watch lists 10 signs of
 
01:17:25.790 --> 01:17:25.800 align:start position:0%
genocide including classifying people
 
01:17:28.430 --> 01:17:28.440 align:start position:0%
and limiting their rights to access to
 
01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
different things based on their
 
01:17:31.370 --> 01:17:31.380 align:start position:0%
classifications and the head of genocide
 
01:17:33.229 --> 01:17:33.239 align:start position:0%
watch when he was confronted with the
 
01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
issue of all these classifications
 
01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
occurring today said
 
01:17:39.229 --> 01:17:39.239 align:start position:0%
oh no this doesn't apply to our times
 
01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
because everything we're doing today is
 
01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
scientifically based and it's therefore
 
01:17:44.750 --> 01:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
Justified to classify people and
 
01:17:46.189 --> 01:17:46.199 align:start position:0%
therefore it's Justified to exclude
 
01:17:46.199 --> 01:17:46.970 align:start position:0%
therefore it's Justified to exclude
people

01:17:46.970 --> 01:17:46.980 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:17:49.370 --> 01:17:49.380 align:start position:0%
and this is the Fatal flaw of our times
 
01:17:51.410 --> 01:17:51.420 align:start position:0%
that we're putting ahead that science
 
01:17:53.390 --> 01:17:53.400 align:start position:0%
trumps everything trumps people's
 
01:17:55.490 --> 01:17:55.500 align:start position:0%
ability to choose Trump's ability to
 
01:17:58.669 --> 01:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
think for themselves and only one thread
 
01:18:01.130 --> 01:18:01.140 align:start position:0%
of scientific thinking is allowed what
 
01:18:02.810 --> 01:18:02.820 align:start position:0%
we have to recognize is making the
 
01:18:04.750 --> 01:18:04.760 align:start position:0%
distinctions of essential non
 
01:18:07.070 --> 01:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
non-essential healthy not healthy
 
01:18:09.110 --> 01:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
distinctions are the distinctions that
 
01:18:10.850 --> 01:18:10.860 align:start position:0%
were established in Germany as the
 
01:18:13.070 --> 01:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
public health ideology took Force in
 
01:18:14.870 --> 01:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
Germany in the 1920s in the Bible
 
01:18:16.430 --> 01:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
Republic and then it was taken with the
 
01:18:18.649 --> 01:18:18.659 align:start position:0%
most efficient execution of it through
 
01:18:19.910 --> 01:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
the Holocaust where people were
 
01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
identified as essential non-essential
 
01:18:25.189 --> 01:18:25.199 align:start position:0%
um and was not limited to the Jews it
 
01:18:27.169 --> 01:18:27.179 align:start position:0%
was limited it was attacking the people
 
01:18:28.669 --> 01:18:28.679 align:start position:0%
who were not healthy attacking the
 
01:18:30.350 --> 01:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
people who were considered disease
 
01:18:31.850 --> 01:18:31.860 align:start position:0%
bearers of which the Jews were then
 
01:18:34.790 --> 01:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
conveniently identified so death as John
 
01:18:36.830 --> 01:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
Stark said General Stark said John Stark
 
01:18:39.290 --> 01:18:39.300 align:start position:0%
said is not the worst of evils the fear
 
01:18:41.330 --> 01:18:41.340 align:start position:0%
in hysteria today is because that has
 
01:18:43.370 --> 01:18:43.380 align:start position:0%
been lost and as a result Live Free or
 
01:18:46.850 --> 01:18:46.860 align:start position:0%
Die cannot be kept in effect if people
 
01:18:48.709 --> 01:18:48.719 align:start position:0%
think that death is the worst of evils
 
01:18:52.669 --> 01:18:52.679 align:start position:0%
our job is to make sure that cruelty
 
01:18:55.130 --> 01:18:55.140 align:start position:0%
does not become the ruling Paradigm in
 
01:18:56.870 --> 01:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
the name of Public Health that will
 
01:18:59.390 --> 01:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
eliminate the rights of every person to
 
01:19:01.970 --> 01:19:01.980 align:start position:0%
investigate inquire and make their own
 
01:19:01.980 --> 01:19:03.110 align:start position:0%
investigate inquire and make their own
decisions

01:19:03.110 --> 01:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
01:19:11.870 --> 01:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
the chair made a mistake earlier when I
 
01:19:18.110 --> 01:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
said that um we call on people from the
 
01:19:21.350 --> 01:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
state agencies earlier I uh didn't turn
 
01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
the page over so the chair now calls
 
01:19:30.170 --> 01:19:30.180 align:start position:0%

01:19:44.810 --> 01:19:44.820 align:start position:0%
if she could just raise her hand it
 
01:19:50.709 --> 01:19:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:53.570 --> 01:19:53.580 align:start position:0%
thank you good morning good morning
 
01:19:55.669 --> 01:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
chairman and committee members thank you
 
01:19:57.050 --> 01:19:57.060 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity to provide
 
01:19:59.750 --> 01:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
information about the impact of HB 506
 
01:20:01.729 --> 01:20:01.739 align:start position:0%
again for the record my name is Patricia
 
01:20:03.470 --> 01:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
Tilley and I represent the New Hampshire
 
01:20:04.790 --> 01:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:20:07.490 --> 01:20:07.500 align:start position:0%
Division of Public Health as Miss
 
01:20:09.229 --> 01:20:09.239 align:start position:0%
Malachi and the Human Rights Commission
 
01:20:11.149 --> 01:20:11.159 align:start position:0%
noted the public accommodation
 
01:20:14.510 --> 01:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
definition is Broad in scope including
 
01:20:16.430 --> 01:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
not only retail stores but also food
 
01:20:19.490 --> 01:20:19.500 align:start position:0%
establishments and health care and as
 
01:20:20.510 --> 01:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
you know there are particular
 
01:20:22.490 --> 01:20:22.500 align:start position:0%
considerations that must be made when we
 
01:20:24.709 --> 01:20:24.719 align:start position:0%
think about health and safety in in
 
01:20:26.570 --> 01:20:26.580 align:start position:0%
these places in restaurants and
 
01:20:28.669 --> 01:20:28.679 align:start position:0%
healthcare provider offices and other
 
01:20:30.709 --> 01:20:30.719 align:start position:0%
areas that are included within that
 
01:20:32.870 --> 01:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
definition this committee has already
 
01:20:34.310 --> 01:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
thought through some of these questions
 
01:20:37.189 --> 01:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
as you considered HP 220 which stated
 
01:20:39.649 --> 01:20:39.659 align:start position:0%
that individuals had a right to bodily
 
01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
Integrity free from threat or compulsion
 
01:20:44.930 --> 01:20:44.940 align:start position:0%
and as you may recall that bill was
 
01:20:48.530 --> 01:20:48.540 align:start position:0%
amended to not not limit the ability for
 
01:20:51.169 --> 01:20:51.179 align:start position:0%
DHHS to order treatment or quarantine as
 
01:20:53.630 --> 01:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
has been discussed in this hearing it
 
01:20:56.570 --> 01:20:56.580 align:start position:0%
also was amended to not supersede the
 
01:20:58.550 --> 01:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
requirement for vaccination as a
 
01:21:00.649 --> 01:21:00.659 align:start position:0%
prerequisite for admission to a school
 
01:21:04.250 --> 01:21:04.260 align:start position:0%
or Child Care Agency the amended HB 220
 
01:21:05.870 --> 01:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
also considered that Health Care
 
01:21:07.850 --> 01:21:07.860 align:start position:0%
Providers or hospitals or even other
 
01:21:10.430 --> 01:21:10.440 align:start position:0%
employers were appropriate in limited
 
01:21:12.770 --> 01:21:12.780 align:start position:0%
scenarios in enforcing certain
 
01:21:15.050 --> 01:21:15.060 align:start position:0%
requirements for vaccine or Medical
 
01:21:17.149 --> 01:21:17.159 align:start position:0%
Treatments in order to protect the
 
01:21:19.070 --> 01:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
health of others and in very little
 
01:21:21.530 --> 01:21:21.540 align:start position:0%
limited cases to protect the health of
 
01:21:23.030 --> 01:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
the individual
 
01:21:25.130 --> 01:21:25.140 align:start position:0%
you know minimizing the transmission of
 
01:21:27.169 --> 01:21:27.179 align:start position:0%
infectious disease is a core function of
 
01:21:29.689 --> 01:21:29.699 align:start position:0%
public health law in general public
 
01:21:32.209 --> 01:21:32.219 align:start position:0%
health laws should authorize compulsory
 
01:21:34.490 --> 01:21:34.500 align:start position:0%
treatment only in circumstances where
 
01:21:36.770 --> 01:21:36.780 align:start position:0%
individual Behavior creates a
 
01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
significant risk of transmission of a
 
01:21:42.169 --> 01:21:42.179 align:start position:0%
serious disease as discussed if a
 
01:21:44.570 --> 01:21:44.580 align:start position:0%
medical device includes Master face
 
01:21:47.450 --> 01:21:47.460 align:start position:0%
covering HP 506 could limit Health Care
 
01:21:49.850 --> 01:21:49.860 align:start position:0%
Providers from requiring individuals to
 
01:21:52.250 --> 01:21:52.260 align:start position:0%
wear masks or maybe even gloves that
 
01:21:54.169 --> 01:21:54.179 align:start position:0%
protect the health of others in seeking
 
01:21:56.149 --> 01:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
care in the same environment
 
01:21:58.910 --> 01:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
as written and discussed hb506 may
 
01:22:01.189 --> 01:22:01.199 align:start position:0%
impact our ability to protect the
 
01:22:02.810 --> 01:22:02.820 align:start position:0%
Public's Health from communicable
 
01:22:04.669 --> 01:22:04.679 align:start position:0%
disease and the committee will have to
 
01:22:06.410 --> 01:22:06.420 align:start position:0%
balance private rights with the public
 
01:22:08.330 --> 01:22:08.340 align:start position:0%
health interests Public Health interest
 
01:22:10.550 --> 01:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
today and public health interest in the
 
01:22:12.649 --> 01:22:12.659 align:start position:0%
future thank you
 
01:22:14.630 --> 01:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
the chair calls Andrew mnuse from Derry
 
01:22:20.169 --> 01:22:20.179 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:22:31.550 --> 01:22:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:32.990 align:start position:0%
 
Maybe

01:22:32.990 --> 01:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
Maybe
 
01:22:34.970 --> 01:22:34.980 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the committee I've
 
01:22:38.390 --> 01:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
come before you in support of HB 506
 
01:22:40.070 --> 01:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that will clarify
 
01:22:42.350 --> 01:22:42.360 align:start position:0%
existing law but ensuring that bodily
 
01:22:44.510 --> 01:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
autonomy is always protected as a civil
 
01:22:47.030 --> 01:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
right in New Hampshire law arguably
 
01:22:50.390 --> 01:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
human immunity isn't immutable uh idea
 
01:22:53.090 --> 01:22:53.100 align:start position:0%
uh whereas gender identity or marital
 
01:22:55.669 --> 01:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
status may not be immutable so I would
 
01:22:57.530 --> 01:22:57.540 align:start position:0%
counter that argument in that way
 
01:23:00.050 --> 01:23:00.060 align:start position:0%
currently the law protects equal access
 
01:23:02.330 --> 01:23:02.340 align:start position:0%
to places of public accommodation for
 
01:23:04.550 --> 01:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
all people regardless of age sex gender
 
01:23:06.470 --> 01:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
identity race Creed color meritable
 
01:23:08.510 --> 01:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
status physical or mental disability
 
01:23:11.030 --> 01:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
national origin or sexual orientation
 
01:23:13.790 --> 01:23:13.800 align:start position:0%
arguably whether or not I wear a facial
 
01:23:15.890 --> 01:23:15.900 align:start position:0%
covering face shield take a covid-19
 
01:23:18.770 --> 01:23:18.780 align:start position:0%
test or show proof of vaccination I'm
 
01:23:21.709 --> 01:23:21.719 align:start position:0%
already protected under this law due to
 
01:23:22.870 --> 01:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
my faith
 
01:23:25.669 --> 01:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
or my physical or mental disability or
 
01:23:27.590 --> 01:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
all three those can certainly account
 
01:23:29.450 --> 01:23:29.460 align:start position:0%
for my protection under the law but I
 
01:23:32.630 --> 01:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
believe that because of violations of
 
01:23:35.149 --> 01:23:35.159 align:start position:0%
people's rights during this pandemic
 
01:23:37.850 --> 01:23:37.860 align:start position:0%
that the clarification in the law is
 
01:23:40.130 --> 01:23:40.140 align:start position:0%
absolutely necessary so that people like
 
01:23:42.830 --> 01:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
me whether or not I have a disability is
 
01:23:45.350 --> 01:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
irrelevant it this law should apply to
 
01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
everybody and I I feel that uh for me I
 
01:23:52.189 --> 01:23:52.199 align:start position:0%
it is a matter of faith and so I I guide
 
01:23:54.649 --> 01:23:54.659 align:start position:0%
you to my written testimony Which is far
 
01:23:56.870 --> 01:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
more voluminous than I can speak in two
 
01:23:59.510 --> 01:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
minutes but what I want to summarize and
 
01:24:01.490 --> 01:24:01.500 align:start position:0%
say is the language in this bill simply
 
01:24:03.169 --> 01:24:03.179 align:start position:0%
States I have a right to buy essential
 
01:24:05.870 --> 01:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
goods for my family which is a human
 
01:24:07.610 --> 01:24:07.620 align:start position:0%
right to be able to feed my family
 
01:24:10.010 --> 01:24:10.020 align:start position:0%
without having to be vaccinated or
 
01:24:12.169 --> 01:24:12.179 align:start position:0%
tested or wear a mask wearing a mask is
 
01:24:14.990 --> 01:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
ineffective masks do not work to prevent
 
01:24:16.370 --> 01:24:16.380 align:start position:0%
the spread of virus there have been
 
01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
multiple studies that show this I can I
 
01:24:22.810 --> 01:24:22.820 align:start position:0%
can show them to you if you would like
 
01:24:25.550 --> 01:24:25.560 align:start position:0%
but this bill is a clarifying act to
 
01:24:27.410 --> 01:24:27.420 align:start position:0%
protect my constitutional rights the
 
01:24:29.570 --> 01:24:29.580 align:start position:0%
government is instituted to protect
 
01:24:31.610 --> 01:24:31.620 align:start position:0%
individual rights and I would argue that
 
01:24:34.370 --> 01:24:34.380 align:start position:0%
this bill is simply uh codifying that
 
01:24:36.850 --> 01:24:36.860 align:start position:0%
thank you committee members
 
01:24:38.990 --> 01:24:39.000 align:start position:0%

Avera but I will take Hebert thank you
 
01:25:24.890 --> 01:25:24.900 align:start position:0%

01:25:24.900 --> 01:25:26.390 align:start position:0%
very much for the French pronunciation
yeah

yeah
 
01:25:28.850 --> 01:25:28.860 align:start position:0%
um I am definitely in support of this
 
01:25:31.250 --> 01:25:31.260 align:start position:0%
bill I really appreciate
 
01:25:34.790 --> 01:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
um this bring being brought forward uh
 
01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:35.689 align:start position:0%
um this bring being brought forward uh
yes

01:25:35.689 --> 01:25:35.699 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:25:38.090 --> 01:25:38.100 align:start position:0%
um with everything a follow-up and
 
01:25:39.649 --> 01:25:39.659 align:start position:0%
pretty much what everyone has been
 
01:25:42.229 --> 01:25:42.239 align:start position:0%
saying there really isn't any
 
01:25:45.110 --> 01:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
documentation supporting masks uh
 
01:25:47.810 --> 01:25:47.820 align:start position:0%
stopping the spread they had referenced
 
01:25:50.930 --> 01:25:50.940 align:start position:0%
tuberculosis you can ask most doctors
 
01:25:53.450 --> 01:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
masking up for tuberculosis is like
 
01:25:56.090 --> 01:25:56.100 align:start position:0%
trying to swat a mosquito with a chain
 
01:25:58.370 --> 01:25:58.380 align:start position:0%
link fence which is much like this virus
 
01:26:03.290 --> 01:26:03.300 align:start position:0%
this bill is needed I myself am tired of
 
01:26:04.790 --> 01:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
being asked
 
01:26:07.610 --> 01:26:07.620 align:start position:0%
for medical conditions or exemptions or
 
01:26:10.550 --> 01:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
anything to related to this in any place
 
01:26:12.950 --> 01:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
I go my HIPAA rights are continuously
 
01:26:15.890 --> 01:26:15.900 align:start position:0%
being violated I do not feel the need to
 
01:26:18.830 --> 01:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
have to explain myself to anybody in
 
01:26:20.450 --> 01:26:20.460 align:start position:0%
other states
 
01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
um you know basically
 
01:26:26.270 --> 01:26:26.280 align:start position:0%
um stores post the signs you read the
 
01:26:28.490 --> 01:26:28.500 align:start position:0%
signs no shoes no shirt no service
 
01:26:31.850 --> 01:26:31.860 align:start position:0%
that's for your safety as well but in
 
01:26:33.709 --> 01:26:33.719 align:start position:0%
addition to that
 
01:26:35.930 --> 01:26:35.940 align:start position:0%
if it is understood that someone is not
 
01:26:37.669 --> 01:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
wearing a mask
 
01:26:40.370 --> 01:26:40.380 align:start position:0%
it is their right to have their hip of
 
01:26:42.709 --> 01:26:42.719 align:start position:0%
Rights protected it is understood that
 
01:26:44.750 --> 01:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
if they have a mask that they are not
 
01:26:47.030 --> 01:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
wearing then they should probably have a
 
01:26:50.870 --> 01:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
a medical condition this is known other
 
01:26:53.450 --> 01:26:53.460 align:start position:0%
states that they do not harass people
 
01:26:54.590 --> 01:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
um and this is what's going on here
 
01:26:56.450 --> 01:26:56.460 align:start position:0%
people being torn apart out of the Shia
 
01:26:58.850 --> 01:26:58.860 align:start position:0%
fear of this the data that exists in
 
01:27:00.709 --> 01:27:00.719 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services non-existent
 
01:27:02.750 --> 01:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
you haven't even isolated this virus
 
01:27:05.030 --> 01:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
this virus is nowhere to be found in
 
01:27:07.490 --> 01:27:07.500 align:start position:0%
this state Health and Human Services has
 
01:27:09.830 --> 01:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
been requested for this information I've
 
01:27:12.110 --> 01:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
had 91a requests there's nothing
 
01:27:13.490 --> 01:27:13.500 align:start position:0%
supporting this
 
01:27:15.770 --> 01:27:15.780 align:start position:0%
and I strongly urge that this bill be
 
01:27:18.229 --> 01:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
passed for the sake of integrity and the
 
01:27:20.390 --> 01:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
sake of our privacy and for the sake of
 
01:27:22.669 --> 01:27:22.679 align:start position:0%
our own choice the government has the
 
01:27:25.070 --> 01:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
right to protect us but the government
 
01:27:26.629 --> 01:27:26.639 align:start position:0%
does not have the right to dictate
 
01:27:32.410 --> 01:27:32.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:40.129 --> 01:27:40.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:42.530 --> 01:27:42.540 align:start position:0%
and would you raise your hand please and
 
01:27:42.540 --> 01:27:44.090 align:start position:0%
and would you raise your hand please and
um

01:27:44.090 --> 01:27:44.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:46.910 --> 01:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
okay yes I speak in support of house
 
01:27:49.850 --> 01:27:49.860 align:start position:0%
bill 506.
 
01:27:51.530 --> 01:27:51.540 align:start position:0%
the mass mandate that we are living
 
01:27:54.229 --> 01:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
under currently does have exemptions for
 
01:27:55.850 --> 01:27:55.860 align:start position:0%
people with health conditions that make
 
01:27:58.310 --> 01:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
it unsafe for them to wear a mask and
 
01:28:00.770 --> 01:28:00.780 align:start position:0%
rightfully so the problem is those
 
01:28:03.050 --> 01:28:03.060 align:start position:0%
exemptions are not working
 
01:28:05.330 --> 01:28:05.340 align:start position:0%
not that I do have my hip or rights but
 
01:28:07.010 --> 01:28:07.020 align:start position:0%
I'll explain to you I have a disease
 
01:28:09.350 --> 01:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
called multiple sclerosis or Ms it has
 
01:28:11.810 --> 01:28:11.820 align:start position:0%
caused me many difficulties that I do
 
01:28:14.510 --> 01:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
not want repeated or exasperated I get
 
01:28:16.729 --> 01:28:16.739 align:start position:0%
an infusion that kills my B cells
 
01:28:20.030 --> 01:28:20.040 align:start position:0%
lowering my immune system my doctor who
 
01:28:22.390 --> 01:28:22.400 align:start position:0%
made me a lot better with this disease
 
01:28:25.790 --> 01:28:25.800 align:start position:0%
advises against me wearing a mask for my
 
01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:27.110 align:start position:0%
advises against me wearing a mask for my
health

01:28:27.110 --> 01:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
health
 
01:28:29.629 --> 01:28:29.639 align:start position:0%
I trust him implicitly with my health
 
01:28:32.990 --> 01:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
decisions he is a medical doctor not a
 
01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:34.129 align:start position:0%
decisions he is a medical doctor not a
politician

01:28:34.129 --> 01:28:34.139 align:start position:0%
politician
 
01:28:36.950 --> 01:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
he also says numerous Studies have shown
 
01:28:39.110 --> 01:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
I will not harm the health of anybody
 
01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
else by not wearing a mask is this virus
 
01:28:44.209 --> 01:28:44.219 align:start position:0%
aerosol is small enough to get through
 
01:28:45.470 --> 01:28:45.480 align:start position:0%
any mask
 
01:28:48.350 --> 01:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
I have been publicly harassed by store
 
01:28:50.810 --> 01:28:50.820 align:start position:0%
employees for not wearing a mask and
 
01:28:53.149 --> 01:28:53.159 align:start position:0%
have been refused service I have
 
01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
politely explained to them I cannot wear
 
01:28:57.709 --> 01:28:57.719 align:start position:0%
a mask for medical reasons and therefore
 
01:29:00.050 --> 01:29:00.060 align:start position:0%
I am exempt at two different stores
 
01:29:03.350 --> 01:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
employees told me they do not honor the
 
01:29:05.510 --> 01:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
governor's Health exemption I am very
 
01:29:07.970 --> 01:29:07.980 align:start position:0%
courteous I always keep my distance from
 
01:29:10.310 --> 01:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
fellow Shoppers and I shop at latest
 
01:29:12.770 --> 01:29:12.780 align:start position:0%
possible at night I have been yelled at
 
01:29:15.530 --> 01:29:15.540 align:start position:0%
across a store for not wearing a mask
 
01:29:18.350 --> 01:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
and again I have a health issue that
 
01:29:21.770 --> 01:29:21.780 align:start position:0%
does not allow me to wear one last do
 
01:29:25.070 --> 01:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
not compare no shirts no shoes and no
 
01:29:27.290 --> 01:29:27.300 align:start position:0%
service to wearing something over your
 
01:29:29.870 --> 01:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
mouth and nose that impedes your ability
 
01:29:32.750 --> 01:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
to breathe fresh air and oxygen they are
 
01:29:34.669 --> 01:29:34.679 align:start position:0%
not the same thing and as my doctor has
 
01:29:38.090 --> 01:29:38.100 align:start position:0%
told me I need oxygen to do well
 
01:29:42.410 --> 01:29:42.420 align:start position:0%
I hope you vote in support of this bill
 
01:29:45.649 --> 01:29:45.659 align:start position:0%

think it's very clear that we we have to
 
01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:23.410 align:start position:0%
think it's very clear that we we have to
Define

01:30:23.410 --> 01:30:23.420 align:start position:0%
Define
 
01:30:27.110 --> 01:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
mandates are not a law and everyone's
 
01:30:28.910 --> 01:30:28.920 align:start position:0%
talking about all of these things and
 
01:30:31.189 --> 01:30:31.199 align:start position:0%
and politicians are involved in this
 
01:30:36.290 --> 01:30:36.300 align:start position:0%
when you have a 14 or 15 or 16 year old
 
01:30:39.169 --> 01:30:39.179 align:start position:0%
person at a grocery store that is using
 
01:30:42.169 --> 01:30:42.179 align:start position:0%
their dirty hand to reach into a box to
 
01:30:43.970 --> 01:30:43.980 align:start position:0%
hand you a mask
 
01:30:46.070 --> 01:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
um there are many people that have in
 
01:30:49.070 --> 01:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
like just invisible disabilities
 
01:30:51.290 --> 01:30:51.300 align:start position:0%
um A girlfriend of mine her daughter has
 
01:30:53.570 --> 01:30:53.580 align:start position:0%
severe autism and can never put anything
 
01:30:56.209 --> 01:30:56.219 align:start position:0%
over her face the amount of
 
01:30:59.090 --> 01:30:59.100 align:start position:0%

01:31:10.370 --> 01:31:10.380 align:start position:0%

groups that are going on there's tons of
 
01:31:17.870 --> 01:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
them in the states we're talking
 
01:31:20.149 --> 01:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
thousands of people that are done with
 
01:31:23.270 --> 01:31:23.280 align:start position:0%

respiratory system I
 
01:34:13.970 --> 01:34:13.980 align:start position:0%
don't currently and will not wear a mask
 
01:34:18.970 --> 01:34:18.980 align:start position:0%

this this bill and I'd like to add a
 
01:49:40.189 --> 01:49:40.199 align:start position:0%
couple of thoughts first I want to note
 
01:49:42.410 --> 01:49:42.420 align:start position:0%
that since February 2nd
 
01:49:43.970 --> 01:49:43.980 align:start position:0%
um since the hearing was published we
 
01:49:45.709 --> 01:49:45.719 align:start position:0%
received a lot of
 
01:49:47.750 --> 01:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
inquiries from providers and concerns
 
01:49:50.209 --> 01:49:50.219 align:start position:0%
about House Bill 602 both as it was
 
01:49:52.609 --> 01:49:52.619 align:start position:0%
originally drafted and as amended
 
01:49:54.830 --> 01:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
in that vein I just want to note for the
 
01:49:57.169 --> 01:49:57.179 align:start position:0%
committee that Dartmouth Hitchcock has
 
01:49:59.510 --> 01:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
supported and helped providers and
 
01:50:01.790 --> 01:50:01.800 align:start position:0%
administrators submit testimony
 
01:50:03.530 --> 01:50:03.540 align:start position:0%
um you will find the written testimony
 
01:50:04.910 --> 01:50:04.920 align:start position:0%

I want to back up for just a second and
 
01:50:28.370 --> 01:50:28.380 align:start position:0%
remind the committee that there's been a
 
01:50:30.649 --> 01:50:30.659 align:start position:0%
lot of work done on Telehealth and that
 
01:50:32.270 --> 01:50:32.280 align:start position:0%
work was done last session
 
01:50:34.330 --> 01:50:34.340 align:start position:0%
as you know House Bill 6
 
01:50:37.430 --> 01:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
16 23 which was past last session
 
01:50:39.350 --> 01:50:39.360 align:start position:0%
shifted Telehealth reimbursement and
 
01:50:40.910 --> 01:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
coverage in New Hampshire
 
01:50:43.430 --> 01:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
and as originally drafted House Bill
 
01:50:46.729 --> 01:50:46.739 align:start position:0%
1623 was based on a premise that of
 
01:50:48.050 --> 01:50:48.060 align:start position:0%
providing necessary treatment to
 
01:50:49.669 --> 01:50:49.679 align:start position:0%
vulnerable populations
 
01:50:51.590 --> 01:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
representative Marsha's original Bill
 
01:50:54.050 --> 01:50:54.060 align:start position:0%
expanded Telehealth services for mental
 
01:50:57.410 --> 01:50:57.420 align:start position:0%
for mat to special populations
 
01:51:00.530 --> 01:51:00.540 align:start position:0%
however responding to a need and a
 
01:51:02.689 --> 01:51:02.699 align:start position:0%
um a group of bipartisan senators and
 
01:51:04.370 --> 01:51:04.380 align:start position:0%
representatives work to expand House
 
01:51:06.950 --> 01:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
Bill 1623 to make it the Innovative
 
01:51:08.689 --> 01:51:08.699 align:start position:0%
Telehealth bill that
 
01:51:11.149 --> 01:51:11.159 align:start position:0%
um that we saw last session
 
01:51:13.550 --> 01:51:13.560 align:start position:0%
thanks to representative Marsh Senator
 
01:51:15.649 --> 01:51:15.659 align:start position:0%
Bradley Senator Khan and others House
 
01:51:18.709 --> 01:51:18.719 align:start position:0%
Bill 1623 and shared access to for the
 
01:51:20.750 --> 01:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
most vulnerable populations in New

to name a few
 
01:51:29.689 --> 01:51:29.699 align:start position:0%
I was Bill 1623 also created a
 
01:51:31.010 --> 01:51:31.020 align:start position:0%
commission to study Telehealth services
 
01:51:33.169 --> 01:51:33.179 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and that commission was
 
01:51:34.609 --> 01:51:34.619 align:start position:0%
charged with collecting data from
 
01:51:36.470 --> 01:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
provider facilities the New Hampshire
 
01:51:38.030 --> 01:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
insurance department Department of
 
01:51:40.010 --> 01:51:40.020 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services and other
 
01:51:43.850 --> 01:51:43.860 align:start position:0%
sources to review that data and upon
 
01:51:46.310 --> 01:51:46.320 align:start position:0%
review the commission will recommend
 
01:51:48.649 --> 01:51:48.659 align:start position:0%
legislative changes if appropriate
 
01:51:50.629 --> 01:51:50.639 align:start position:0%
as DJ bang report the Deputy
 
01:51:52.070 --> 01:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of the insurance department
 
01:51:54.590 --> 01:51:54.600 align:start position:0%
testified in your February 2nd hearing
 
01:51:57.350 --> 01:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
there are many unknowns still it's still
 
01:51:59.090 --> 01:51:59.100 align:start position:0%
too soon to make policy changes for
 
01:52:00.950 --> 01:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
Telehealth in New Hampshire we must
 
01:52:02.750 --> 01:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
allow the commission to study the data
 
01:52:04.609 --> 01:52:04.619 align:start position:0%
that will be put forward and make policy
 
01:52:04.619 --> 01:52:05.750 align:start position:0%
that will be put forward and make policy
recommendations

01:52:05.750 --> 01:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
01:52:08.330 --> 01:52:08.340 align:start position:0%
House Bill 602 even as amended as a bit
 
01:52:10.550 --> 01:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
premature and and I think I'm informed
 
01:52:12.709 --> 01:52:12.719 align:start position:0%
at this point and so we recommend that
 
01:52:16.370 --> 01:52:16.380 align:start position:0%
the um the committee vote itl for this
 
01:52:18.169 --> 01:52:18.179 align:start position:0%
bill I'm happy to take any questions
 
01:52:20.149 --> 01:52:20.159 align:start position:0%

and we had uh I think Courtney mentioned
 
01:53:44.209 --> 01:53:44.219 align:start position:0%
but I would just reiterate we're happy
 
01:53:47.030 --> 01:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
to have Dr Curtis available but
 
01:53:48.649 --> 01:53:48.659 align:start position:0%
um we just wanted him to be a resource
 
01:53:50.510 --> 01:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
for the committee so
 
01:53:52.310 --> 01:53:52.320 align:start position:0%

01:53:56.750 --> 01:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
um and we and uh was shared with by
 
01:53:58.370 --> 01:53:58.380 align:start position:0%
Courtney Tanner and we're happy to
 
01:54:00.530 --> 01:54:00.540 align:start position:0%
Circle back with the committee should

you wish to hear from Dr Curtis but I
 
01:54:03.950 --> 01:54:03.960 align:start position:0%
don't I don't think he's available at
 
01:54:05.330 --> 01:54:05.340 align:start position:0%
the moment thank you very much
 
01:54:08.590 --> 01:54:08.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate that the chair recognizes
 
01:54:11.450 --> 01:54:11.460 align:start position:0%
Lindsey Staples if you would please put
 
01:54:18.189 --> 01:54:18.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:21.890 --> 01:54:21.900 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning
 
01:54:24.410 --> 01:54:24.420 align:start position:0%
so hello my name is Dr Lindsay Staples
 
01:54:26.450 --> 01:54:26.460 align:start position:0%
and I'm a licensed psychologist in the
 
01:54:28.370 --> 01:54:28.380 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire I appreciate the
 
01:54:30.290 --> 01:54:30.300 align:start position:0%
opportunity to share my experience and
 
01:54:31.970 --> 01:54:31.980 align:start position:0%
illustrate why in mental health
 
01:54:34.370 --> 01:54:34.380 align:start position:0%
Telehealth and phone services are equal
 
01:54:36.649 --> 01:54:36.659 align:start position:0%
to or greater in value than in-person
 
01:54:36.659 --> 01:54:38.090 align:start position:0%
to or greater in value than in-person
services

01:54:38.090 --> 01:54:38.100 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:54:40.790 --> 01:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
next week will be one year since with
 
01:54:43.189 --> 01:54:43.199 align:start position:0%
hesitation I transitioned all of my
 
01:54:45.530 --> 01:54:45.540 align:start position:0%
patients to Telehealth due to covid I
 
01:54:47.149 --> 01:54:47.159 align:start position:0%
believe that the video conference format
 
01:54:49.609 --> 01:54:49.619 align:start position:0%
would adversely affect quality of care
 
01:54:51.050 --> 01:54:51.060 align:start position:0%
it turns out it couldn't have been more
 
01:54:53.030 --> 01:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
mistaken because these tools have
 
01:54:55.010 --> 01:54:55.020 align:start position:0%
instead helped my patients get better
 
01:54:56.450 --> 01:54:56.460 align:start position:0%
faster than ever
 
01:54:58.010 --> 01:54:58.020 align:start position:0%
some people feel like you lose something
 
01:54:59.750 --> 01:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
over Telehealth and I get it I don't
 
01:55:01.189 --> 01:55:01.199 align:start position:0%
like spending time with friends over
 
01:55:02.870 --> 01:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
Zoom as much as I like spending time
 
01:55:05.090 --> 01:55:05.100 align:start position:0%
with them in person but therapy is not a
 
01:55:06.530 --> 01:55:06.540 align:start position:0%
chat over coffee it's a medical
 
01:55:06.540 --> 01:55:07.790 align:start position:0%
chat over coffee it's a medical
intervention

01:55:07.790 --> 01:55:07.800 align:start position:0%
intervention
 
01:55:09.470 --> 01:55:09.480 align:start position:0%
in the past year I've observed that
 
01:55:11.270 --> 01:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
Telehealth not only preserves the
 
01:55:12.830 --> 01:55:12.840 align:start position:0%
essential ingredients of effective
 
01:55:15.229 --> 01:55:15.239 align:start position:0%
mental health care but also has resulted
 
01:55:17.030 --> 01:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
in increased remission at the lowest
 
01:55:19.070 --> 01:55:19.080 align:start position:0%
ratio of hospitalizations among my own
 
01:55:20.930 --> 01:55:20.940 align:start position:0%
patients that I've ever seen
 
01:55:22.850 --> 01:55:22.860 align:start position:0%
I believe there are three main reasons
 
01:55:25.669 --> 01:55:25.679 align:start position:0%
for this accessibility customizability
 
01:55:27.530 --> 01:55:27.540 align:start position:0%
and generalizability
 
01:55:29.870 --> 01:55:29.880 align:start position:0%
first issue accessibility clinicians
 
01:55:31.669 --> 01:55:31.679 align:start position:0%
agree better access to outpatient
 
01:55:33.410 --> 01:55:33.420 align:start position:0%
services creates better outcomes and
 
01:55:35.209 --> 01:55:35.219 align:start position:0%
reduces hospitalizations which are a
 
01:55:37.609 --> 01:55:37.619 align:start position:0%
costly tool of Last Resort
 
01:55:40.310 --> 01:55:40.320 align:start position:0%
second Telehealth improves my ability to
 
01:55:42.169 --> 01:55:42.179 align:start position:0%
customize interventions to the needs of
 
01:55:44.629 --> 01:55:44.639 align:start position:0%
the patient most gold standard therapies
 
01:55:46.970 --> 01:55:46.980 align:start position:0%
involve behavioral exercises most
 
01:55:49.430 --> 01:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
exercises cannot be easily simulated in
 
01:55:51.709 --> 01:55:51.719 align:start position:0%
an office so clinicians end up assigning
 
01:55:53.390 --> 01:55:53.400 align:start position:0%
homework crossing their fingers the
 
01:55:54.950 --> 01:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
patient actually does it
 
01:55:56.689 --> 01:55:56.699 align:start position:0%
over Telehealth we just do it in the
 
01:55:58.250 --> 01:55:58.260 align:start position:0%
session it's not a simulation it's
 
01:55:58.260 --> 01:55:59.629 align:start position:0%
session it's not a simulation it's
reality

01:55:59.629 --> 01:55:59.639 align:start position:0%
reality
 
01:56:02.030 --> 01:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
third generalizability there's a
 
01:56:03.590 --> 01:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
principle of human learning that says
 
01:56:04.850 --> 01:56:04.860 align:start position:0%
when you learn something in one
 
01:56:06.649 --> 01:56:06.659 align:start position:0%
environment it's hard to carry that
 
01:56:09.169 --> 01:56:09.179 align:start position:0%
learning over to another environment in
 
01:56:10.669 --> 01:56:10.679 align:start position:0%
short therapy sticks when you do it at
 
01:56:10.679 --> 01:56:11.689 align:start position:0%
short therapy sticks when you do it at
home

01:56:11.689 --> 01:56:11.699 align:start position:0%
home
 
01:56:13.970 --> 01:56:13.980 align:start position:0%
I've learned firsthand why Telehealth is
 
01:56:15.890 --> 01:56:15.900 align:start position:0%
the future of mental health care and not
 
01:56:17.810 --> 01:56:17.820 align:start position:0%
just a substitute format during covid
 
01:56:20.209 --> 01:56:20.219 align:start position:0%
and it should be reimbursed accordingly
 
01:56:21.709 --> 01:56:21.719 align:start position:0%
with respect as a practicing
 
01:56:23.390 --> 01:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
psychologist I would ask that the
 
01:56:25.010 --> 01:56:25.020 align:start position:0%
government avoid creating interference
 
01:56:27.109 --> 01:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
in my clinical decision making and avoid
 
01:56:29.030 --> 01:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
restricting my ability to respond to
 
01:56:31.010 --> 01:56:31.020 align:start position:0%
Trends in an evolving Market
 
01:56:32.870 --> 01:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
the impact of this bill cannot possibly
 
01:56:34.669 --> 01:56:34.679 align:start position:0%
match the intentions of those proposing
 
01:56:37.310 --> 01:56:37.320 align:start position:0%
it it will harm patients add to cost of
 
01:56:39.830 --> 01:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
care take choices away from doctors and
 
01:56:41.510 --> 01:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
stifle the market if parity is not
 
01:56:44.450 --> 01:56:44.460 align:start position:0%
protected thank you
 
01:56:53.330 --> 01:56:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:56.689 --> 01:56:56.699 align:start position:0%

of New Hampshire
 
01:58:00.470 --> 01:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
uh you know as you all know we do have
 
01:58:02.810 --> 01:58:02.820 align:start position:0%
the Mental Health crisis nationally and
 
01:58:05.330 --> 01:58:05.340 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and with that a
 
01:58:07.850 --> 01:58:07.860 align:start position:0%
Workforce shortage of providers to meet
 
01:58:10.310 --> 01:58:10.320 align:start position:0%
the need and these issues weren't caused
 
01:58:11.629 --> 01:58:11.639 align:start position:0%
by the pandemic they're really only
 
01:58:13.669 --> 01:58:13.679 align:start position:0%
worsened and we expect the issues and
 
01:58:15.830 --> 01:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
the need to continue
 
01:58:17.450 --> 01:58:17.460 align:start position:0%
um we would like to be on record to
 
01:58:19.910 --> 01:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill we see it as
 
01:58:21.950 --> 01:58:21.960 align:start position:0%
detrimental to these long-standing
 
01:58:21.960 --> 01:58:23.149 align:start position:0%
detrimental to these long-standing
issues

01:58:23.149 --> 01:58:23.159 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:58:25.010 --> 01:58:25.020 align:start position:0%
um two words I really want to highlight
 
01:58:28.070 --> 01:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
access matters it should matter to all
 
01:58:29.330 --> 01:58:29.340 align:start position:0%
of us and we should be doing everything
 
01:58:31.370 --> 01:58:31.380 align:start position:0%
we can to promote and preserve people's
 
01:58:33.709 --> 01:58:33.719 align:start position:0%
access to care in whatever form that is
 
01:58:36.290 --> 01:58:36.300 align:start position:0%
and the provider's ability for that
 
01:58:36.300 --> 01:58:37.669 align:start position:0%
and the provider's ability for that
access

01:58:37.669 --> 01:58:37.679 align:start position:0%
access
 
01:58:39.470 --> 01:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
um quickly two parts the audio only
 
01:58:41.990 --> 01:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
Services of Telehealth in a recent
 
01:58:44.510 --> 01:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
survey to providers that we did we know
 
01:58:46.970 --> 01:58:46.980 align:start position:0%
that 73 percent of our providers use
 
01:58:48.950 --> 01:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
Audio Only services
 
01:58:51.050 --> 01:58:51.060 align:start position:0%
it's almost three out of every four
 
01:58:54.229 --> 01:58:54.239 align:start position:0%
providers and why well lack of Internet
 
01:58:56.750 --> 01:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
difficulties with internet visual
 
01:58:58.729 --> 01:58:58.739 align:start position:0%
impairment issues sometimes just due to
 
01:59:01.609 --> 01:59:01.619 align:start position:0%
privacy needs and as an example I would
 
01:59:03.109 --> 01:59:03.119 align:start position:0%
have a colleague with me here this
 
01:59:05.570 --> 01:59:05.580 align:start position:0%
morning Dr Atkins but he's actually
 
01:59:07.729 --> 01:59:07.739 align:start position:0%
doing an evaluation of a veteran in the
 
01:59:09.109 --> 01:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
Colebrook area
 
01:59:11.209 --> 01:59:11.219 align:start position:0%
he expects that that evaluation will be
 
01:59:14.089 --> 01:59:14.099 align:start position:0%
primarily audio only for the
 
01:59:16.850 --> 01:59:16.860 align:start position:0%
difficulties I just talked about
 
01:59:18.830 --> 01:59:18.840 align:start position:0%
um we want and need regulations at
 
01:59:21.350 --> 01:59:21.360 align:start position:0%
clearly State Audio Only is reimbursable
 
01:59:22.970 --> 01:59:22.980 align:start position:0%
and we feel the wording and this
 
01:59:24.709 --> 01:59:24.719 align:start position:0%
amendment is pretty vague
 
01:59:26.810 --> 01:59:26.820 align:start position:0%
lastly I just want to address the parody
 
01:59:28.370 --> 01:59:28.380 align:start position:0%
of the reimbursement
 
01:59:30.950 --> 01:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
really regulating parity is critical the
 
01:59:33.609 --> 01:59:33.619 align:start position:0%
services we provide regular regular
 
01:59:35.750 --> 01:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
regularly through in-person or
 
01:59:38.270 --> 01:59:38.280 align:start position:0%
Telehealth are really the same and the
 
01:59:41.810 --> 01:59:41.820 align:start position:0%
overhead cost is going to be the same if
 
01:59:43.609 --> 01:59:43.619 align:start position:0%
we get reimbursed at lower rates than
 
01:59:45.530 --> 01:59:45.540 align:start position:0%
in-person Services we're worried that
 
01:59:47.270 --> 01:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
providers and practices might be forced
 
01:59:49.669 --> 01:59:49.679 align:start position:0%
to limit the Telehealth offerings to not
 
01:59:52.129 --> 01:59:52.139 align:start position:0%
lose income and that could result in
 
01:59:54.109 --> 01:59:54.119 align:start position:0%
reduced access for our underserved
 
01:59:54.119 --> 01:59:55.609 align:start position:0%
reduced access for our underserved
populations

01:59:55.609 --> 01:59:55.619 align:start position:0%
populations
 
01:59:57.890 --> 01:59:57.900 align:start position:0%
and a negative economic impact because
 
01:59:59.450 --> 01:59:59.460 align:start position:0%
there's so many small businesses of
 
02:00:01.490 --> 02:00:01.500 align:start position:0%
mental health providers
 
02:00:03.169 --> 02:00:03.179 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for your attention we
 
02:00:04.669 --> 02:00:04.679 align:start position:0%
just really want to highlight that we
 
02:00:07.070 --> 02:00:07.080 align:start position:0%
want and work hard to meet the need and
 
02:00:09.290 --> 02:00:09.300 align:start position:0%
we really need to promote access and
 
02:00:11.990 --> 02:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
parity so that we can do it
 
02:00:18.050 --> 02:00:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:20.149 --> 02:00:20.159 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes and I'm going to make a
 
02:00:26.350 --> 02:00:26.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:37.129 --> 02:00:37.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:39.169 --> 02:00:39.179 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
02:00:40.609 --> 02:00:40.619 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is John
 
02:00:43.310 --> 02:00:43.320 align:start position:0%
Detroit I'm here representing the
 
02:00:45.950 --> 02:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
National Association of Social Workers
 
02:00:48.229 --> 02:00:48.239 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire chapter specifically
 
02:00:51.290 --> 02:00:51.300 align:start position:0%
the nesw New Hampshire is a membership
 
02:00:54.250 --> 02:00:54.260 align:start position:0%
organization which represents a license
 
02:00:56.330 --> 02:00:56.340 align:start position:0%
and I'm licensed social workers
 
02:00:58.370 --> 02:00:58.380 align:start position:0%
throughout the state of New Hampshire I
 
02:01:01.250 --> 02:01:01.260 align:start position:0%
rise on their behalf to oppose House
 
02:01:04.250 --> 02:01:04.260 align:start position:0%
Bill 602 for much of what you've heard
 
02:01:05.810 --> 02:01:05.820 align:start position:0%
today and I won't repeat what you've
 
02:01:09.589 --> 02:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
already heard what I will say is that we
 
02:01:11.510 --> 02:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
think that Telehealth has been vital
 
02:01:13.490 --> 02:01:13.500 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic and we agree that it
 
02:01:15.229 --> 02:01:15.239 align:start position:0%
will be vital moving forward for our
 
02:01:17.450 --> 02:01:17.460 align:start position:0%
clients and other clients across the
 
02:01:17.460 --> 02:01:18.350 align:start position:0%
clients and other clients across the
state

02:01:18.350 --> 02:01:18.360 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:01:20.270 --> 02:01:20.280 align:start position:0%
but even more importantly than that we
 
02:01:21.770 --> 02:01:21.780 align:start position:0%
think it's premature for this bill to
 
02:01:25.189 --> 02:01:25.199 align:start position:0%
come forward uh this uh the law was
 
02:01:27.709 --> 02:01:27.719 align:start position:0%
changed last year and as part of that
 
02:01:32.030 --> 02:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
this committee was used to use sorry for
 
02:01:35.209 --> 02:01:35.219 align:start position:0%
my puppy uh used significant foresight
 
02:01:37.129 --> 02:01:37.139 align:start position:0%
in creating a commission
 
02:01:40.310 --> 02:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
to review all of the questions that
 
02:01:41.870 --> 02:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
you've been hearing and others that we
 
02:01:44.570 --> 02:01:44.580 align:start position:0%
heard last year that commission is
 
02:01:46.550 --> 02:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
active and moving forward bringing
 
02:01:48.950 --> 02:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
people in to discuss these topics and is
 
02:01:51.589 --> 02:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
not even required to submit an interim
 
02:01:55.430 --> 02:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
report until 2022. we suggest that
 
02:01:57.050 --> 02:01:57.060 align:start position:0%
changing legislation at this point is
 
02:01:58.609 --> 02:01:58.619 align:start position:0%
premature until this commission is
 
02:02:00.589 --> 02:02:00.599 align:start position:0%
permitted to do their work and would
 
02:02:02.510 --> 02:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
respectfully ask the committee to allow
 
02:02:04.910 --> 02:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
that commission to move forward with
 
02:02:08.209 --> 02:02:08.219 align:start position:0%
that I will conclude my testimony thank
 
02:02:10.250 --> 02:02:10.260 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
02:02:14.229 --> 02:02:14.239 align:start position:0%

previously for the February 2nd hearing
 
02:03:19.390 --> 02:03:19.400 align:start position:0%

02:03:23.149 --> 02:03:23.159 align:start position:0%
Communications since then I did submit
 
02:03:26.149 --> 02:03:26.159 align:start position:0%
something yesterday and
 
02:03:30.109 --> 02:03:30.119 align:start position:0%
um as you know we are as psychologists
 
02:03:30.119 --> 02:03:31.250 align:start position:0%
um as you know we are as psychologists
um

02:03:31.250 --> 02:03:31.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:34.609 --> 02:03:34.619 align:start position:0%
having a quite a time dealing with Kelly
 
02:03:38.209 --> 02:03:38.219 align:start position:0%
medicine there's much to do and as Dr
 
02:03:42.169 --> 02:03:42.179 align:start position:0%
Lindsay pointed out uh there's a lot of
 
02:03:44.570 --> 02:03:44.580 align:start position:0%
application work that's done it's very
 
02:03:47.990 --> 02:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
fast moving and uh it really gets very
 
02:03:50.030 --> 02:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
very good for the patients we want to
 
02:03:53.149 --> 02:03:53.159 align:start position:0%
make sure that the fees that are able to
 
02:03:55.010 --> 02:03:55.020 align:start position:0%
be reimbursed by the insurance companies
 
02:03:58.490 --> 02:03:58.500 align:start position:0%
remain the same as in live in in person
 
02:04:01.310 --> 02:04:01.320 align:start position:0%
and in office sessions That's essential
 
02:04:04.970 --> 02:04:04.980 align:start position:0%
to this when it was lower uh before the
 
02:04:06.290 --> 02:04:06.300 align:start position:0%
previous bill
 
02:04:10.010 --> 02:04:10.020 align:start position:0%
that I am sure the parity
 
02:04:11.510 --> 02:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
um we got to a point where you could
 
02:04:14.330 --> 02:04:14.340 align:start position:0%
only afford to have a very few number of
 
02:04:17.450 --> 02:04:17.460 align:start position:0%
telemedicine patients and I would think
 
02:04:20.330 --> 02:04:20.340 align:start position:0%
that that's uh damaging to the access to
 
02:04:20.340 --> 02:04:21.229 align:start position:0%
that that's uh damaging to the access to
care

02:04:21.229 --> 02:04:21.239 align:start position:0%
care
 
02:04:23.750 --> 02:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
we also um I've been in communication
 
02:04:26.450 --> 02:04:26.460 align:start position:0%
with representative Edwards as you may
 
02:04:29.750 --> 02:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
be aware as I told you in my email but
 
02:04:31.550 --> 02:04:31.560 align:start position:0%
I'd like to let other people know that
 
02:04:33.669 --> 02:04:33.679 align:start position:0%
he does appreciate
 
02:04:37.129 --> 02:04:37.139 align:start position:0%
the negotiation problems that there are
 
02:04:39.410 --> 02:04:39.420 align:start position:0%
with the individual providers not being
 
02:04:43.910 --> 02:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
able to negotiate fairly in group with
 
02:04:47.149 --> 02:04:47.159 align:start position:0%
the insurance companies to bargain for
 
02:04:49.370 --> 02:04:49.380 align:start position:0%
these rates and reimbursements because
 
02:04:51.370 --> 02:04:51.380 align:start position:0%
of federal
 
02:04:54.290 --> 02:04:54.300 align:start position:0%
acts of the Sherman Act that does
 
02:04:57.530 --> 02:04:57.540 align:start position:0%
prohibit that assembly
 
02:04:59.450 --> 02:04:59.460 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:05:01.669 --> 02:05:01.679 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards is interested in
 
02:05:03.470 --> 02:05:03.480 align:start position:0%
finding out what can be done about that
 
02:05:05.510 --> 02:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
and we do realize it's a huge issue with
 
02:05:07.430 --> 02:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
the federal level and federal preemption
 
02:05:08.810 --> 02:05:08.820 align:start position:0%
is involved
 
02:05:12.350 --> 02:05:12.360 align:start position:0%
um but having brought that forward
 
02:05:12.360 --> 02:05:13.250 align:start position:0%
um but having brought that forward
um

02:05:13.250 --> 02:05:13.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:16.609 --> 02:05:16.619 align:start position:0%
I have contacted the chairman of the
 
02:05:19.129 --> 02:05:19.139 align:start position:0%
commission Senator Khan and he is
 
02:05:21.290 --> 02:05:21.300 align:start position:0%
interested in bringing that question to
 
02:05:23.750 --> 02:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
his commission and I'm very very happy
 
02:05:26.450 --> 02:05:26.460 align:start position:0%
about that and so I I think that we're
 
02:05:29.530 --> 02:05:29.540 align:start position:0%
on the right track I hope you will itl
 
02:05:33.229 --> 02:05:33.239 align:start position:0%
if this comes to a vote now or retain it
 
02:05:36.229 --> 02:05:36.239 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
02:07:32.570 --> 02:07:32.580 align:start position:0%
um an amendment does not have to be
 
02:07:36.350 --> 02:07:36.360 align:start position:0%
offered uh it just exists until somebody
 
02:07:38.629 --> 02:07:38.639 align:start position:0%
offers it
 
02:07:41.870 --> 02:07:41.880 align:start position:0%

anybody if people don't want to offer it
 
02:08:01.910 --> 02:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
I I my understanding from the chairman
 
02:08:04.910 --> 02:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
is it has been offered and seconded and
 
02:08:08.030 --> 02:08:08.040 align:start position:0%
I didn't see or hear representative
 
02:08:11.149 --> 02:08:11.159 align:start position:0%
Shapiro seconding it so if he wants to
 
02:08:12.709 --> 02:08:12.719 align:start position:0%
Second it that's fine I don't want to
 
02:08:14.629 --> 02:08:14.639 align:start position:0%
stand in his way but I also don't want
 
02:08:18.050 --> 02:08:18.060 align:start position:0%
him co-opted if he wasn't doing that I I
 
02:08:20.689 --> 02:08:20.699 align:start position:0%
did not second it thank you okay and
 
02:08:22.910 --> 02:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
representative Marsh which is no longer
 
02:08:24.830 --> 02:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
to move it
 
02:08:27.950 --> 02:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
so it will seem yes representative Marsh
 
02:08:30.770 --> 02:08:30.780 align:start position:0%
thanks Mr chairman I what I wanted to do
 
02:08:34.490 --> 02:08:34.500 align:start position:0%
was to move to retain House Bill 602 I
 
02:08:36.770 --> 02:08:36.780 align:start position:0%
would be happy to speak to that okay I
 
02:08:38.750 --> 02:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
had to give I believe I had to give the
 
02:08:40.669 --> 02:08:40.679 align:start position:0%
theoretical possibility that somebody
 
02:08:44.570 --> 02:08:44.580 align:start position:0%
would want zero two zero five H but I uh
 
02:08:47.450 --> 02:08:47.460 align:start position:0%
I don't see that anybody does so your
 
02:08:51.530 --> 02:08:51.540 align:start position:0%
motion to move 602 is in order
 
02:08:53.950 --> 02:08:53.960 align:start position:0%
and Mr chairman may I second
 
02:08:56.950 --> 02:08:56.960 align:start position:0%
representative Marsha's motion
 
02:09:00.890 --> 02:09:00.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:02.990 --> 02:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
and representative Marsh please speak to
 
02:09:05.870 --> 02:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
your motion uh thank you Mr chairs uh
 
02:09:08.450 --> 02:09:08.460 align:start position:0%
first of all we've had considered an
 
02:09:10.729 --> 02:09:10.739 align:start position:0%
amendment an amendment is in existence
 
02:09:13.430 --> 02:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
to do so
 
02:09:13.440 --> 02:09:15.310 align:start position:0%
to do so
um

02:09:15.310 --> 02:09:15.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:17.870 --> 02:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
to make this bill to the study committee
 
02:09:19.850 --> 02:09:19.860 align:start position:0%
but we already have a study committee to
 
02:09:22.250 --> 02:09:22.260 align:start position:0%
study Telehealth reimbursement and I in
 
02:09:23.870 --> 02:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
fact am the vice chairman of the
 
02:09:27.169 --> 02:09:27.179 align:start position:0%
Telehealth talk study exhibition so I
 
02:09:29.810 --> 02:09:29.820 align:start position:0%
know that this in fact happened
 
02:09:32.209 --> 02:09:32.219 align:start position:0%
um I we also heard an awful lot of
 
02:09:35.030 --> 02:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
testimony uh about assuming
 
02:09:36.850 --> 02:09:36.860 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for auditing only
 
02:09:40.550 --> 02:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
currently Audio Only is allowed on a
 
02:09:45.350 --> 02:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
temporary basis by a federal 1135 wait
 
02:09:48.589 --> 02:09:48.599 align:start position:0%
I contacted uh Chuck Henderson and
 
02:09:50.930 --> 02:09:50.940 align:start position:0%
Senator Shaheen's office and he has told
 
02:09:54.109 --> 02:09:54.119 align:start position:0%
me that the the president is committed
 
02:09:57.530 --> 02:09:57.540 align:start position:0%
to maintaining Audio Only reimbursement
 
02:10:00.229 --> 02:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
on a temporary basis at least to the end
 
02:10:02.570 --> 02:10:02.580 align:start position:0%
of the year and hopefully to the end of
 
02:10:03.850 --> 02:10:03.860 align:start position:0%
the program
 
02:10:06.830 --> 02:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
so there's no action needs about that
 
02:10:10.669 --> 02:10:10.679 align:start position:0%
immediately however we're that waiver to
 
02:10:13.370 --> 02:10:13.380 align:start position:0%
go away at the end of the year you may
 
02:10:15.589 --> 02:10:15.599 align:start position:0%
need to do something and this bill would
 
02:10:17.810 --> 02:10:17.820 align:start position:0%
provide a vehicle to the Telehealth
 
02:10:19.850 --> 02:10:19.860 align:start position:0%
commission that the vehicle is needed at
 
02:10:22.910 --> 02:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
the end of the year and therefore I
 
02:10:24.770 --> 02:10:24.780 align:start position:0%
think that retaining this bill at this
 
02:10:28.430 --> 02:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:33.410 --> 02:10:33.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:33.420 --> 02:10:35.390 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:10:35.390 --> 02:10:35.400 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:10:37.609 --> 02:10:37.619 align:start position:0%
yes representative snow
 
02:10:40.430 --> 02:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
yes I had a question my understanding is
 
02:10:40.440 --> 02:10:42.550 align:start position:0%
yes I had a question my understanding is
that

02:10:42.550 --> 02:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:10:45.890 --> 02:10:45.900 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards had added 180 day
 
02:10:48.350 --> 02:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
transition after the state of emergency
 
02:10:51.709 --> 02:10:51.719 align:start position:0%
ends which extends it a little bit uh
 
02:10:53.870 --> 02:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
but if that state of emergency ends say
 
02:10:55.970 --> 02:10:55.980 align:start position:0%
in September of this year that six
 
02:10:58.430 --> 02:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
months would run to February and it's my
 
02:11:02.089 --> 02:11:02.099 align:start position:0%
understanding that the final reporting
 
02:11:06.890 --> 02:11:06.900 align:start position:0%
on the bill is required until June of 22
 
02:11:09.530 --> 02:11:09.540 align:start position:0%
so there could be a gap where all of
 
02:11:11.450 --> 02:11:11.460 align:start position:0%
those Provisions would go away for a
 
02:11:13.669 --> 02:11:13.679 align:start position:0%
period of time am I correct about that
 
02:11:16.850 --> 02:11:16.860 align:start position:0%
or am I not correct about that
 
02:11:16.860 --> 02:11:19.030 align:start position:0%
or am I not correct about that
okay

02:11:19.030 --> 02:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:11:21.530 --> 02:11:21.540 align:start position:0%
representative Marsh yes I'll be glad to
 
02:11:23.570 --> 02:11:23.580 align:start position:0%
answer the question right now House Bill
 
02:11:26.570 --> 02:11:26.580 align:start position:0%
623 is signed into the law so nothing
 
02:11:29.930 --> 02:11:29.940 align:start position:0%
goes away until it unless we change it
 
02:11:32.510 --> 02:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
in the statutory lock with the exception
 
02:11:36.169 --> 02:11:36.179 align:start position:0%
of the federal uh uh waiver which is
 
02:11:38.750 --> 02:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
temporary and is really entirely out of
 
02:11:40.970 --> 02:11:40.980 align:start position:0%
our control so if the federal waiver
 
02:11:43.850 --> 02:11:43.860 align:start position:0%
does go away then that would create a
 
02:11:45.290 --> 02:11:45.300 align:start position:0%
problem you're permanently correct about
 
02:11:48.350 --> 02:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
that however I have received assurance
 
02:11:50.689 --> 02:11:50.699 align:start position:0%
that it will remain in place at least
 
02:11:52.550 --> 02:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
through the end of the year I understand
 
02:11:54.770 --> 02:11:54.780 align:start position:0%
that there are efforts undergoing on a
 
02:11:56.810 --> 02:11:56.820 align:start position:0%
federal level to continue it on a longer
 
02:11:59.510 --> 02:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
basis and perhaps permanently but at
 
02:12:01.550 --> 02:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
this point in time we have statutory law
 
02:12:03.770 --> 02:12:03.780 align:start position:0%
resting on a temporary Federal waiver
 
02:12:07.129 --> 02:12:07.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:10.070 --> 02:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
and I'll follow up
 
02:12:12.350 --> 02:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
and all of those include all of those
 
02:12:14.510 --> 02:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
include telephone only is that not
 
02:12:14.520 --> 02:12:15.770 align:start position:0%
include telephone only is that not
correct

02:12:15.770 --> 02:12:15.780 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:12:19.250 --> 02:12:19.260 align:start position:0%
the the federal 1135 waiver is spent
 
02:12:21.350 --> 02:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
allows reimbursement particularly from
 
02:12:24.649 --> 02:12:24.659 align:start position:0%
Medicare and Medicaid for audio only if
 
02:12:26.149 --> 02:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
that were to go away it would not matter
 
02:12:27.770 --> 02:12:27.780 align:start position:0%
what the state of New Hampshire does
 
02:12:32.930 --> 02:12:32.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:34.729 --> 02:12:34.739 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
02:12:37.490 --> 02:12:37.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
02:12:39.530 --> 02:12:39.540 align:start position:0%
does this mean that we
 
02:12:43.129 --> 02:12:43.139 align:start position:0%
we are safe in return retaining it or
 
02:12:45.950 --> 02:12:45.960 align:start position:0%
should we do a very simple
 
02:12:48.950 --> 02:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
um amendment that wipes out the wording
 
02:12:51.470 --> 02:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
of the wording that's currently in there
 
02:12:55.069 --> 02:12:55.079 align:start position:0%
and just say that it extends uh
 
02:12:55.079 --> 02:12:58.370 align:start position:0%
and just say that it extends uh
Telehealth

02:12:58.370 --> 02:12:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:00.649 --> 02:13:00.659 align:start position:0%
it is my opinion that you do not need to
 
02:13:03.410 --> 02:13:03.420 align:start position:0%
extend Telehealth because it's our Audio
 
02:13:04.970 --> 02:13:04.980 align:start position:0%
Only television because it's already
 
02:13:08.569 --> 02:13:08.579 align:start position:0%
it's Statewide at this point however the
 
02:13:10.250 --> 02:13:10.260 align:start position:0%
Telehealth commission might need a
 
02:13:12.290 --> 02:13:12.300 align:start position:0%
vehicle to address the change in the
 
02:13:14.450 --> 02:13:14.460 align:start position:0%
federal law if this waiver is not made
 
02:13:17.930 --> 02:13:17.940 align:start position:0%
permanent and if it were to go away
 
02:13:19.490 --> 02:13:19.500 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
02:13:22.729 --> 02:13:22.739 align:start position:0%
so so if I understand properly does this
 
02:13:25.669 --> 02:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
mean that you're recommending
 
02:13:30.470 --> 02:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
retention and as the time progresses by
 
02:13:31.550 --> 02:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
the end of the year we'll be in much
 
02:13:33.890 --> 02:13:33.900 align:start position:0%
better shape to figure out what to do
 
02:13:36.530 --> 02:13:36.540 align:start position:0%
to extend tell about someone my
 
02:13:38.030 --> 02:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
intention as the vice chair of the
 
02:13:39.649 --> 02:13:39.659 align:start position:0%
Telehealth commission would be to bring
 
02:13:41.089 --> 02:13:41.099 align:start position:0%
back to this committee any
 
02:13:43.430 --> 02:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
recommendations from the Telehealth
 
02:13:45.169 --> 02:13:45.179 align:start position:0%
commission including any recommendations
 
02:13:48.589 --> 02:13:48.599 align:start position:0%
for legislation which might include ICL
 
02:13:50.390 --> 02:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
in this bill come full once we have more
 
02:13:52.189 --> 02:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
information it depends upon what we
 
02:13:53.870 --> 02:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
learned over the course of the coming
 
02:13:56.870 --> 02:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
months however if we it out this bill
 
02:13:59.870 --> 02:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
right now we have no vehicle and if the
 
02:14:02.089 --> 02:14:02.099 align:start position:0%
attempt an amendment it must go through
 
02:14:04.250 --> 02:14:04.260 align:start position:0%
all the hopes it must be done brilliant
 
02:14:06.350 --> 02:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
and it's got to be out the door by
 
02:14:08.330 --> 02:14:08.340 align:start position:0%
Thursday afternoon I don't think there's
 
02:14:09.890 --> 02:14:09.900 align:start position:0%
the food is going to build this
 
02:14:13.069 --> 02:14:13.079 align:start position:0%
complicated so I would suggest also that
 
02:14:16.790 --> 02:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
we retain it to have it as a vehicle
 
02:14:19.669 --> 02:14:19.679 align:start position:0%
anyone else from the committee
 
02:14:21.229 --> 02:14:21.239 align:start position:0%
remember it doesn't have to be a
 
02:14:23.330 --> 02:14:23.340 align:start position:0%
question because this is an exact
 
02:14:26.270 --> 02:14:26.280 align:start position:0%
session I'm thinking I'm seeing
 
02:14:28.550 --> 02:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
I think I am seeing yes representative
 
02:14:28.560 --> 02:14:31.430 align:start position:0%
I think I am seeing yes representative
Shapiro

02:14:31.430 --> 02:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:34.069 --> 02:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
02:14:34.079 --> 02:14:34.669 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

02:14:34.669 --> 02:14:34.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:36.589 --> 02:14:36.599 align:start position:0%
I have a question and then I have a
 
02:14:40.490 --> 02:14:40.500 align:start position:0%
comment my question really is
 
02:14:42.229 --> 02:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
um to representative Marsh
 
02:14:46.189 --> 02:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
and my assumption and I could be wrong
 
02:14:49.430 --> 02:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
was that the federal waiver applied to
 
02:14:51.770 --> 02:14:51.780 align:start position:0%
Medicare only and that's so our state
 
02:14:53.990 --> 02:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
law really can't mandate what Medicare
 
02:14:55.850 --> 02:14:55.860 align:start position:0%
pays for
 
02:14:58.850 --> 02:14:58.860 align:start position:0%
um but are you saying that also
 
02:15:00.530 --> 02:15:00.540 align:start position:0%
um affects
 
02:15:04.370 --> 02:15:04.380 align:start position:0%
how we can reimburse for Medicaid
 
02:15:07.250 --> 02:15:07.260 align:start position:0%
uh it is my understanding that CMS is
 
02:15:08.990 --> 02:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
the center for Medicare and Medicaid
 
02:15:10.850 --> 02:15:10.860 align:start position:0%
services and therefore yes it would
 
02:15:13.129 --> 02:15:13.139 align:start position:0%
affect Medicaid I'm not sure that's
 
02:15:14.990 --> 02:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
accurate I don't know if we could get a
 
02:15:17.689 --> 02:15:17.699 align:start position:0%
you know if there's someone like from
 
02:15:19.850 --> 02:15:19.860 align:start position:0%
the insurance department or somebody who
 
02:15:19.860 --> 02:15:21.109 align:start position:0%
the insurance department or somebody who
knows

02:15:21.109 --> 02:15:21.119 align:start position:0%
knows
 
02:15:21.119 --> 02:15:22.250 align:start position:0%
knows
um

02:15:22.250 --> 02:15:22.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:24.649 --> 02:15:24.659 align:start position:0%
my second
 
02:15:27.290 --> 02:15:27.300 align:start position:0%
my second
 
02:15:30.950 --> 02:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
um points which is not a question is
 
02:15:34.310 --> 02:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
it's my feeling that the initial
 
02:15:34.320 --> 02:15:35.649 align:start position:0%
it's my feeling that the initial
um

02:15:35.649 --> 02:15:35.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:40.850 --> 02:15:40.860 align:start position:0%
hb602 was so skewed in terms of
 
02:15:40.860 --> 02:15:41.870 align:start position:0%
hb602 was so skewed in terms of
um

02:15:41.870 --> 02:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:46.010 --> 02:15:46.020 align:start position:0%
doing away with some of the parity and
 
02:15:48.770 --> 02:15:48.780 align:start position:0%
some of the um access to care that comes
 
02:15:50.270 --> 02:15:50.280 align:start position:0%
with Telehealth
 
02:15:53.390 --> 02:15:53.400 align:start position:0%
um that I would prefer to see at itl
 
02:15:56.569 --> 02:15:56.579 align:start position:0%
and um and to really
 
02:15:59.390 --> 02:15:59.400 align:start position:0%
um give respect and time and
 
02:15:59.400 --> 02:16:01.310 align:start position:0%
um give respect and time and
consideration

02:16:01.310 --> 02:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
02:16:04.129 --> 02:16:04.139 align:start position:0%
um to the commission which is I think
 
02:16:06.649 --> 02:16:06.659 align:start position:0%
um not skewed and would come at this
 
02:16:08.629 --> 02:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
with a more kind of independent
 
02:16:11.450 --> 02:16:11.460 align:start position:0%
objective look at what needs to change
 
02:16:13.850 --> 02:16:13.860 align:start position:0%
if something does need to change and
 
02:16:15.950 --> 02:16:15.960 align:start position:0%
that we start all over
 
02:16:17.510 --> 02:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
um you know I'd be okay with it being
 
02:16:19.790 --> 02:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
retained but I would prefer it being itl
 
02:16:21.290 --> 02:16:21.300 align:start position:0%
I don't know if at some point in this
 
02:16:24.470 --> 02:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
discussion if we could take a straw vote
 
02:16:28.250 --> 02:16:28.260 align:start position:0%
um to see how other people feel we could
 
02:16:29.810 --> 02:16:29.820 align:start position:0%
do that after a little bit the
 
02:16:31.910 --> 02:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
difficulty is if we start over from
 
02:16:34.310 --> 02:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
scratch it probably will not be signed
 
02:16:37.070 --> 02:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
into law until a year from this June
 
02:16:39.530 --> 02:16:39.540 align:start position:0%
whereas if we retain it and make an
 
02:16:44.110 --> 02:16:44.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:45.889 --> 02:16:45.899 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
02:16:48.110 --> 02:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
would be fine with me if it took longer
 
02:16:48.120 --> 02:16:50.810 align:start position:0%
would be fine with me if it took longer
okay

02:16:50.810 --> 02:16:50.820 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:16:54.290 --> 02:16:54.300 align:start position:0%
uh representative Weber
 
02:16:56.690 --> 02:16:56.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
02:16:59.089 --> 02:16:59.099 align:start position:0%
um a series of comments
 
02:17:01.310 --> 02:17:01.320 align:start position:0%
first of all there is nothing in the
 
02:17:04.310 --> 02:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
bill as it stands that I like I am
 
02:17:08.750 --> 02:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
firmly opposed to uh dropping the audio
 
02:17:12.049 --> 02:17:12.059 align:start position:0%
only option and I am firmly opposed to
 
02:17:14.450 --> 02:17:14.460 align:start position:0%
dropping parity so that's item number
 
02:17:14.460 --> 02:17:16.250 align:start position:0%
dropping parity so that's item number
one

02:17:16.250 --> 02:17:16.260 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:17:18.589 --> 02:17:18.599 align:start position:0%
um item number two is there's nothing in
 
02:17:20.690 --> 02:17:20.700 align:start position:0%
any of the Amendments that we have seen
 
02:17:22.629 --> 02:17:22.639 align:start position:0%
to date that I like
 
02:17:25.969 --> 02:17:25.979 align:start position:0%
so that's just my position my own
 
02:17:27.950 --> 02:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
personal feeling that I want on the
 
02:17:27.960 --> 02:17:28.790 align:start position:0%
personal feeling that I want on the
record

02:17:28.790 --> 02:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
record
 
02:17:31.849 --> 02:17:31.859 align:start position:0%
uh the third thing is that we have in
 
02:17:35.570 --> 02:17:35.580 align:start position:0%
front of us now a motion to retain and
 
02:17:40.190 --> 02:17:40.200 align:start position:0%
so having people testify about what the
 
02:17:40.200 --> 02:17:41.950 align:start position:0%
so having people testify about what the
federal

02:17:41.950 --> 02:17:41.960 align:start position:0%
federal
 
02:17:46.570 --> 02:17:46.580 align:start position:0%
mandate may or may not be is
 
02:17:50.290 --> 02:17:50.300 align:start position:0%
at least tangential
 
02:17:53.629 --> 02:17:53.639 align:start position:0%
and possibly interesting but we have a
 
02:17:55.669 --> 02:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
lot of work in front of us that I would
 
02:17:58.429 --> 02:17:58.439 align:start position:0%
like to get to so
 
02:18:02.450 --> 02:18:02.460 align:start position:0%
um my position is that I would be
 
02:18:05.870 --> 02:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
willing to retain with the thought that
 
02:18:09.950 --> 02:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
if we decide to amend this bill the only
 
02:18:12.290 --> 02:18:12.300 align:start position:0%
thing I would be voting for would be an
 
02:18:14.990 --> 02:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
amendment in its entirety that that
 
02:18:18.650 --> 02:18:18.660 align:start position:0%
addressed completely different aspects
 
02:18:21.110 --> 02:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
of Telehealth which will require new
 
02:18:23.870 --> 02:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
notice and new hearings but we can do
 
02:18:28.310 --> 02:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
that it will allow us to do some kind of
 
02:18:32.469 --> 02:18:32.479 align:start position:0%
necessary tweak on an expedited basis
 
02:18:36.349 --> 02:18:36.359 align:start position:0%
and my opinion is that
 
02:18:39.770 --> 02:18:39.780 align:start position:0%
it's okay to have the bill out there in
 
02:18:42.589 --> 02:18:42.599 align:start position:0%
case we need to do that and we can fight
 
02:18:45.230 --> 02:18:45.240 align:start position:0%
whether it's necessary to do it or not
 
02:18:49.370 --> 02:18:49.380 align:start position:0%
then rather than now but I will not be
 
02:18:50.870 --> 02:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
supporting either of the two major
 
02:18:53.509 --> 02:18:53.519 align:start position:0%
premises of this bill I will support
 
02:18:56.209 --> 02:18:56.219 align:start position:0%
retention because I think it gets us
 
02:18:59.990 --> 02:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
farther forward at least and might get
 
02:19:04.150 --> 02:19:04.160 align:start position:0%
us on to the next Bill thank you
 
02:19:08.389 --> 02:19:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:10.570 --> 02:19:10.580 align:start position:0%
the only time
 
02:19:12.910 --> 02:19:12.920 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards
 
02:19:15.650 --> 02:19:15.660 align:start position:0%
180 day extension
 
02:19:18.530 --> 02:19:18.540 align:start position:0%
or transition period comes into being is
 
02:19:20.750 --> 02:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
if the original bill passes it has
 
02:19:22.849 --> 02:19:22.859 align:start position:0%
absolutely no bearing if the bill is
 
02:19:24.950 --> 02:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
being retained or anything else I am
 
02:19:26.810 --> 02:19:26.820 align:start position:0%
assuming I correct about that is that
 
02:19:26.820 --> 02:19:27.709 align:start position:0%
assuming I correct about that is that
right

02:19:27.709 --> 02:19:27.719 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:19:31.190 --> 02:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
representative Marsh yes
 
02:19:34.929 --> 02:19:34.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:39.490 --> 02:19:39.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:43.490 --> 02:19:43.500 align:start position:0%
what how much time do we save by
 
02:19:46.250 --> 02:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
retaining the bill and working on it as
 
02:19:49.190 --> 02:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
opposed to starting fresh you said
 
02:19:51.830 --> 02:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
otherwise we would be a year and a
 
02:19:53.570 --> 02:19:53.580 align:start position:0%
couple months before it could be signed
 
02:19:56.570 --> 02:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
does it really save us any time if we're
 
02:19:58.730 --> 02:19:58.740 align:start position:0%
retain it that doesn't happen the same
 
02:20:02.450 --> 02:20:02.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:04.070 --> 02:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
representative whoever you've been here
 
02:20:06.170 --> 02:20:06.180 align:start position:0%
a few times
 
02:20:08.510 --> 02:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
what would you say to that question the
 
02:20:11.810 --> 02:20:11.820 align:start position:0%
time frame for retention is that we will
 
02:20:14.090 --> 02:20:14.100 align:start position:0%
have to as long as the deadlines aren't
 
02:20:16.310 --> 02:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
shifted again and let us all hope that
 
02:20:19.790 --> 02:20:19.800 align:start position:0%
we don't need to do that uh that the
 
02:20:22.310 --> 02:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
committee will have to report the bill
 
02:20:26.090 --> 02:20:26.100 align:start position:0%
out sometime around the end of uh
 
02:20:30.110 --> 02:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
October and the house will vote on it
 
02:20:33.710 --> 02:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
sometime uh at the very beginning of
 
02:20:35.570 --> 02:20:35.580 align:start position:0%
January and then it will go straight
 
02:20:39.050 --> 02:20:39.060 align:start position:0%
over to the Senate what the Senate does
 
02:20:41.929 --> 02:20:41.939 align:start position:0%
with it is the Senate's business so the
 
02:20:43.849 --> 02:20:43.859 align:start position:0%
Senate might decide it was a really
 
02:20:46.429 --> 02:20:46.439 align:start position:0%
important bill and they could pass it
 
02:20:48.830 --> 02:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
the third week in January and send it
 
02:20:51.650 --> 02:20:51.660 align:start position:0%
winging on to the governor's desk or the
 
02:20:54.710 --> 02:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
Senate could hold it and deal with it
 
02:20:58.429 --> 02:20:58.439 align:start position:0%
under their regular uh calendar which
 
02:21:00.530 --> 02:21:00.540 align:start position:0%
means that it wouldn't have saved any
 
02:21:03.290 --> 02:21:03.300 align:start position:0%
time at all but what we are doing is
 
02:21:06.590 --> 02:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
preserving the possibility that it would
 
02:21:09.950 --> 02:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
get acted on in an expedited fashion if
 
02:21:14.990 --> 02:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
that were necessary and agreed to buy
 
02:21:17.450 --> 02:21:17.460 align:start position:0%
pretty much everybody so we're just
 
02:21:19.550 --> 02:21:19.560 align:start position:0%
holding on to a possibility here there's
 
02:21:22.130 --> 02:21:22.140 align:start position:0%
no guarantees one way or the other if we
 
02:21:24.770 --> 02:21:24.780 align:start position:0%
started a new bill obviously it's not
 
02:21:26.450 --> 02:21:26.460 align:start position:0%
going to get to the governor before May
 
02:21:28.969 --> 02:21:28.979 align:start position:0%
or so unless somebody acts on it in a
 
02:21:31.309 --> 02:21:31.319 align:start position:0%
very expedited basis which we have done
 
02:21:31.319 --> 02:21:32.389 align:start position:0%
very expedited basis which we have done
but

02:21:32.389 --> 02:21:32.399 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:21:35.270 --> 02:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
unlikely in this case
 
02:21:40.370 --> 02:21:40.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:43.969 --> 02:21:43.979 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro has suggested
 
02:21:46.370 --> 02:21:46.380 align:start position:0%
a straw poll
 
02:21:50.389 --> 02:21:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:50.399 --> 02:21:52.190 align:start position:0%
 
why

02:21:52.190 --> 02:21:52.200 align:start position:0%
why
 
02:21:58.130 --> 02:21:58.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:04.490 --> 02:22:04.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:06.950 --> 02:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
my question was why would we do a straw
 
02:22:09.429 --> 02:22:09.439 align:start position:0%
poll why don't we just vote on retention
 
02:22:12.170 --> 02:22:12.180 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro had thought with
 
02:22:14.150 --> 02:22:14.160 align:start position:0%
Mike I don't want to retain and would
 
02:22:17.270 --> 02:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
prefer another motion such as itl they
 
02:22:18.950 --> 02:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
are certainly free to vote no on
 
02:22:18.960 --> 02:22:21.230 align:start position:0%
are certainly free to vote no on
retention

02:22:21.230 --> 02:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
retention
 
02:22:23.270 --> 02:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh well I wanted to give representative
 
02:22:25.010 --> 02:22:25.020 align:start position:0%
Shapiro the courtesy of what he had
 
02:22:27.469 --> 02:22:27.479 align:start position:0%
asked for and representative Shapiro do
 
02:22:29.210 --> 02:22:29.220 align:start position:0%
you still wish to ask for straw poll are
 
02:22:32.270 --> 02:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
you ready to vote
 
02:22:35.870 --> 02:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
well I guess I I wanted to find out if
 
02:22:38.929 --> 02:22:38.939 align:start position:0%
there was any sentiment for itl in it I
 
02:22:40.670 --> 02:22:40.680 align:start position:0%
would certainly go along with retaining
 
02:22:40.680 --> 02:22:41.870 align:start position:0%
would certainly go along with retaining
it

02:22:41.870 --> 02:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:22:41.880 --> 02:22:43.010 align:start position:0%
it
um

02:22:43.010 --> 02:22:43.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:46.790 --> 02:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that it seems to me that
 
02:22:46.800 --> 02:22:47.630 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that it seems to me that
um

02:22:47.630 --> 02:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:49.849 --> 02:22:49.859 align:start position:0%
a whole new bill could be brought if it
 
02:22:51.349 --> 02:22:51.359 align:start position:0%
addressed different issues about
 
02:22:55.190 --> 02:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
Telehealth for the next year and I think
 
02:22:57.410 --> 02:22:57.420 align:start position:0%
that this bill is
 
02:22:59.450 --> 02:22:59.460 align:start position:0%
um skewed and
 
02:22:59.460 --> 02:23:02.270 align:start position:0%
um skewed and
um

02:23:02.270 --> 02:23:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:04.849 --> 02:23:04.859 align:start position:0%
you know is not the bill to be passed
 
02:23:06.230 --> 02:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
and that we should give the time for the
 
02:23:08.270 --> 02:23:08.280 align:start position:0%
commission to do its work
 
02:23:12.110 --> 02:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
um I will certainly I would certainly
 
02:23:15.469 --> 02:23:15.479 align:start position:0%
if there's not a sentiment of wanting to
 
02:23:17.210 --> 02:23:17.220 align:start position:0%
itl it I would certainly go along with
 
02:23:17.220 --> 02:23:20.590 align:start position:0%
itl it I would certainly go along with
retention

02:23:20.590 --> 02:23:20.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:23.809 --> 02:23:23.819 align:start position:0%
I didn't hear a sentiment to itl and is
 
02:23:25.670 --> 02:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
there one
 
02:23:29.150 --> 02:23:29.160 align:start position:0%
I would if I may Mr chairman hey
 
02:23:31.610 --> 02:23:31.620 align:start position:0%
I have expressed my sentiment that the
 
02:23:35.389 --> 02:23:35.399 align:start position:0%
bill as it stands ought to be itl'd but
 
02:23:39.410 --> 02:23:39.420 align:start position:0%
given the time frames and other
 
02:23:42.050 --> 02:23:42.060 align:start position:0%
considerations I am willing to vote to
 
02:23:45.290 --> 02:23:45.300 align:start position:0%
retain so having given my word on that I
 
02:23:46.849 --> 02:23:46.859 align:start position:0%
will vote to retain
 
02:23:49.610 --> 02:23:49.620 align:start position:0%
it's not a question of my sentiment it's
 
02:23:53.870 --> 02:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
a question of of tactics and uh having a
 
02:23:57.349 --> 02:23:57.359 align:start position:0%
vehicle available in case we need one uh
 
02:23:58.910 --> 02:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
we've all seen bills that have been
 
02:24:01.670 --> 02:24:01.680 align:start position:0%
taken and changed to something very very
 
02:24:03.710 --> 02:24:03.720 align:start position:0%
different from what they were when they
 
02:24:05.690 --> 02:24:05.700 align:start position:0%
were filed and we've also seen bills
 
02:24:08.870 --> 02:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
that have been captive uh and changed
 
02:24:11.210 --> 02:24:11.220 align:start position:0%
into something diametrically opposed to
 
02:24:14.090 --> 02:24:14.100 align:start position:0%
what their original intent was that
 
02:24:17.150 --> 02:24:17.160 align:start position:0%
happens in the legislature and if that
 
02:24:19.490 --> 02:24:19.500 align:start position:0%
happens with this bill fine
 
02:24:19.500 --> 02:24:20.270 align:start position:0%
happens with this bill fine
um

02:24:20.270 --> 02:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:23.210 --> 02:24:23.220 align:start position:0%
I I I'm not in I just want to make it
 
02:24:24.650 --> 02:24:24.660 align:start position:0%
clear I'm not in favor of the bill as it
 
02:24:26.750 --> 02:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
is but I'm perfectly happy to go ahead
 
02:24:29.210 --> 02:24:29.220 align:start position:0%
with retention representative Weber I'm
 
02:24:31.790 --> 02:24:31.800 align:start position:0%
of the exact same sentiment uh what you
 
02:24:33.370 --> 02:24:33.380 align:start position:0%
just articulated
 
02:24:36.190 --> 02:24:36.200 align:start position:0%
representative gay I agree with y'all
 
02:24:38.929 --> 02:24:38.939 align:start position:0%
and so I was wondering would it make
 
02:24:41.510 --> 02:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
would it be more palatable if we first
 
02:24:43.790 --> 02:24:43.800 align:start position:0%
amended it to wipe out everything that's
 
02:24:46.370 --> 02:24:46.380 align:start position:0%
in it and just say something to the
 
02:24:49.429 --> 02:24:49.439 align:start position:0%
positive effect of Telehealth so that
 
02:24:52.610 --> 02:24:52.620 align:start position:0%
when we retain it it doesn't retain all
 
02:24:54.230 --> 02:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
this negative stuff
 
02:24:55.849 --> 02:24:55.859 align:start position:0%
well first of all I don't think that's
 
02:24:57.770 --> 02:24:57.780 align:start position:0%
necessary and secondly I don't want to
 
02:25:01.130 --> 02:25:01.140 align:start position:0%
do this on Thursday so probably no
 
02:25:05.230 --> 02:25:05.240 align:start position:0%
well I did not hear a great sentiment to
 
02:25:09.830 --> 02:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
itl as except as
 
02:25:12.770 --> 02:25:12.780 align:start position:0%
um a couple of us have said about at
 
02:25:14.570 --> 02:25:14.580 align:start position:0%
least it's a vehicle it might work and
 
02:25:16.510 --> 02:25:16.520 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't work we can ideal it later
 
02:25:20.450 --> 02:25:20.460 align:start position:0%
so without objection I would like to ask
 
02:25:22.429 --> 02:25:22.439 align:start position:0%
a question Mr chair you may ask a
 
02:25:22.439 --> 02:25:23.389 align:start position:0%
a question Mr chair you may ask a
question

02:25:23.389 --> 02:25:23.399 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:25:26.870 --> 02:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Marsh just to
 
02:25:29.330 --> 02:25:29.340 align:start position:0%
restore my confidence in the Commission
 
02:25:31.370 --> 02:25:31.380 align:start position:0%
in addition to you who I do have
 
02:25:34.370 --> 02:25:34.380 align:start position:0%
confidence in can you tell me who serves

the executive session on House Bill 506

which we occurred earlier

this morning
 
02:30:28.550 --> 02:30:28.560 align:start position:0%

thank you and the second second I'll
 
02:30:47.270 --> 02:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
second that I heard a soprano voice
 
02:30:47.280 --> 02:30:49.849 align:start position:0%
second that I heard a soprano voice
verse

02:30:49.849 --> 02:30:49.859 align:start position:0%
verse
 
02:30:52.670 --> 02:30:52.680 align:start position:0%

02:30:56.150 --> 02:30:56.160 align:start position:0%

02:30:59.349 --> 02:30:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:02.750 --> 02:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
no go ahead Weber you're fine hey to
 
02:31:04.670 --> 02:31:04.680 align:start position:0%
settle this uh representative Woods
 
02:31:07.010 --> 02:31:07.020 align:start position:0%
moved and representative snow gets to
 
02:31:10.370 --> 02:31:10.380 align:start position:0%
second on itl and representative Woods
 
02:31:13.010 --> 02:31:13.020 align:start position:0%
would you speak to this motion please
 
02:31:15.530 --> 02:31:15.540 align:start position:0%
uh well since we just heard this there's
 
02:31:18.309 --> 02:31:18.319 align:start position:0%
probably not much I can add
 
02:31:22.370 --> 02:31:22.380 align:start position:0%
my basic feeling is that uh there is a
 
02:31:26.270 --> 02:31:26.280 align:start position:0%
attempt to make a balance uh between the
 
02:31:28.490 --> 02:31:28.500 align:start position:0%
uh rights of the individual versus the
 
02:31:31.309 --> 02:31:31.319 align:start position:0%
rights of of the uh people of
 
02:31:33.710 --> 02:31:33.720 align:start position:0%
accommodating uh entities uh
 
02:31:36.530 --> 02:31:36.540 align:start position:0%
nevertheless I think this this bill uh
 
02:31:39.110 --> 02:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
clearly would allow someone like as you
 
02:31:42.230 --> 02:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
said Typhoid Mary uh would be go would
 
02:31:44.809 --> 02:31:44.819 align:start position:0%
go unchecked uh and there's a variety of
 
02:31:47.150 --> 02:31:47.160 align:start position:0%
other things which are imminently uh
 
02:31:49.070 --> 02:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
fresh on our minds so I won't go over
 
02:31:53.510 --> 02:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
them again uh but I'll leave it at that
 
02:31:59.210 --> 02:31:59.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:03.110 --> 02:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
German uh okay representative Solway
 
02:32:05.090 --> 02:32:05.100 align:start position:0%
then representative Cushman
 
02:32:08.330 --> 02:32:08.340 align:start position:0%
uh uh thank you Mr chairman
 
02:32:11.929 --> 02:32:11.939 align:start position:0%
um I I I'd like to borrow a custom from
 
02:32:14.570 --> 02:32:14.580 align:start position:0%
representative Woods who has on occasion
 
02:32:16.910 --> 02:32:16.920 align:start position:0%
said I will speak from 30 feet and I
 
02:32:19.370 --> 02:32:19.380 align:start position:0%
will speak from 30 000 feet uh an image
 
02:32:21.110 --> 02:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
which I rather like
 
02:32:21.120 --> 02:32:21.730 align:start position:0%
which I rather like
um

02:32:21.730 --> 02:32:21.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:25.490 --> 02:32:25.500 align:start position:0%
I have worked in uh government within
 
02:32:27.110 --> 02:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
this body and I have worked in public
 
02:32:32.870 --> 02:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
health and I will con confer I I excuse
 
02:32:36.290 --> 02:32:36.300 align:start position:0%
me I will agree with some in support of
 
02:32:39.790 --> 02:32:39.800 align:start position:0%
this bill in that public health is
 
02:32:42.469 --> 02:32:42.479 align:start position:0%
occasionally a science
 
02:32:45.469 --> 02:32:45.479 align:start position:0%
and occasionally it is a religion
 
02:32:49.670 --> 02:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
propounded by people who tell us we know
 
02:32:52.670 --> 02:32:52.680 align:start position:0%
uh what's good for you and if you only
 
02:32:55.610 --> 02:32:55.620 align:start position:0%
do what we tell you to do your life will
 
02:32:58.370 --> 02:32:58.380 align:start position:0%
be better uh the difficulty is that we
 
02:33:01.130 --> 02:33:01.140 align:start position:0%
really can't discriminate between the
 
02:33:04.849 --> 02:33:04.859 align:start position:0%
science of Public Health which has saved
 
02:33:08.090 --> 02:33:08.100 align:start position:0%
countless countless lives over the
 
02:33:10.910 --> 02:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
generations and those aspects of Public
 
02:33:13.849 --> 02:33:13.859 align:start position:0%
Health which are more realistic and
 
02:33:16.010 --> 02:33:16.020 align:start position:0%
religion and prescriptive but not
 
02:33:19.010 --> 02:33:19.020 align:start position:0%
necessarily terribly well founded in
 
02:33:20.870 --> 02:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
such circumstances
 
02:33:23.330 --> 02:33:23.340 align:start position:0%
what we do in response is to practice
 
02:33:27.170 --> 02:33:27.180 align:start position:0%
what we call the precautionary principle
 
02:33:30.170 --> 02:33:30.180 align:start position:0%
and it's vitally important if we do not
 
02:33:32.929 --> 02:33:32.939 align:start position:0%
know for certain
 
02:33:35.690 --> 02:33:35.700 align:start position:0%
however we suspect that there is a
 
02:33:35.700 --> 02:33:37.130 align:start position:0%
however we suspect that there is a
possibility

02:33:37.130 --> 02:33:37.140 align:start position:0%
possibility
 
02:33:40.070 --> 02:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
we behave as though we were certain
 
02:33:43.309 --> 02:33:43.319 align:start position:0%
knowing that we may be proven wrong but
 
02:33:46.030 --> 02:33:46.040 align:start position:0%
at least we will have avoided
 
02:33:48.710 --> 02:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
unnecessary disease and potentially
 
02:33:48.720 --> 02:33:49.849 align:start position:0%
unnecessary disease and potentially
death

02:33:49.849 --> 02:33:49.859 align:start position:0%
death
 
02:33:53.270 --> 02:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
I understand and appreciate the concerns
 
02:33:57.230 --> 02:33:57.240 align:start position:0%
for individual freedom I appreciate
 
02:34:01.190 --> 02:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh the concerns about whether masks are
 
02:34:03.650 --> 02:34:03.660 align:start position:0%
effective or not however
 
02:34:06.770 --> 02:34:06.780 align:start position:0%
I have read the literature going back to
 
02:34:09.290 --> 02:34:09.300 align:start position:0%
Julius Roberts
 
02:34:12.889 --> 02:34:12.899 align:start position:0%
uh seminal article called Magic and
 
02:34:15.410 --> 02:34:15.420 align:start position:0%
ritual in control of contagion in which
 
02:34:18.469 --> 02:34:18.479 align:start position:0%
he talks about the use of masks do we
 
02:34:20.750 --> 02:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
know absolutely for certain no we don't
 
02:34:24.170 --> 02:34:24.180 align:start position:0%
however it is imperative that we
 
02:34:26.870 --> 02:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
practice a precautionary principle and
 
02:34:29.510 --> 02:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
therefore I would support a motion to
 
02:34:34.429 --> 02:34:34.439 align:start position:0%
itl this bill uh with confidence thank
 
02:34:36.429 --> 02:34:36.439 align:start position:0%
you for your attention
 
02:34:38.870 --> 02:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman thank you Mr
 
02:34:38.880 --> 02:34:40.730 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman thank you Mr
chairman

02:34:40.730 --> 02:34:40.740 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
02:34:43.190 --> 02:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
um I would rather see this bill retain
 
02:34:45.170 --> 02:34:45.180 align:start position:0%
so it can be worked on
 
02:34:48.530 --> 02:34:48.540 align:start position:0%
um I I hear that we have some agreement
 
02:34:51.889 --> 02:34:51.899 align:start position:0%
that individual rights need to be
 
02:34:51.899 --> 02:34:53.570 align:start position:0%
that individual rights need to be
um protected

02:34:53.570 --> 02:34:53.580 align:start position:0%
um protected
 
02:34:56.270 --> 02:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
and perhaps there's some language here
 
02:34:58.610 --> 02:34:58.620 align:start position:0%
that could be worked out and we could
 
02:35:01.130 --> 02:35:01.140 align:start position:0%
come to an agreeable form of this bill
 
02:35:03.889 --> 02:35:03.899 align:start position:0%
that we could pass so that we are
 
02:35:07.849 --> 02:35:07.859 align:start position:0%
protecting the religious Medical
 
02:35:10.250 --> 02:35:10.260 align:start position:0%
rights of individuals
 
02:35:13.429 --> 02:35:13.439 align:start position:0%
so I would just like everyone to vote
 
02:35:16.370 --> 02:35:16.380 align:start position:0%
down this motion of itl and so that I
 
02:35:21.710 --> 02:35:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:25.490 --> 02:35:25.500 align:start position:0%
anyone else yes Mr chairman yes
 
02:35:27.410 --> 02:35:27.420 align:start position:0%
representative snow
 
02:35:30.710 --> 02:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
the reason why I vote for itl really is
 
02:35:32.570 --> 02:35:32.580 align:start position:0%
born out of what we call the Declaration
 
02:35:36.410 --> 02:35:36.420 align:start position:0%
of Independence from 1776 which Begins
 
02:35:38.330 --> 02:35:38.340 align:start position:0%
by saying that we hold these troops to
 
02:35:40.429 --> 02:35:40.439 align:start position:0%
be self-evident that all men are created
 
02:35:42.170 --> 02:35:42.180 align:start position:0%
equal and if they were endowed by their
 
02:35:44.510 --> 02:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
creator with certain inalienable rights
 
02:35:47.990 --> 02:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
that among these are life liberty and
 
02:35:50.750 --> 02:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
the pursuit of happiness if we assume
 
02:35:53.090 --> 02:35:53.100 align:start position:0%
their intent was to prioritize those
 
02:35:55.730 --> 02:35:55.740 align:start position:0%
three rights I think we'd have to agree
 
02:35:58.429 --> 02:35:58.439 align:start position:0%
that the right to life and to protect
 
02:36:01.070 --> 02:36:01.080 align:start position:0%
life is the first priority and that
 
02:36:04.370 --> 02:36:04.380 align:start position:0%
Liberty would include the the kind of
 
02:36:06.410 --> 02:36:06.420 align:start position:0%
freedoms that they're talking about not
 
02:36:08.450 --> 02:36:08.460 align:start position:0%
that they aren't important but our first
 
02:36:10.490 --> 02:36:10.500 align:start position:0%
obligation is to protect people's lives
 
02:36:12.110 --> 02:36:12.120 align:start position:0%
and I think that's what the intent of
 
02:36:14.870 --> 02:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
these bills are for and thank you for
 
02:36:17.870 --> 02:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
your thank you for listening
 
02:36:20.030 --> 02:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative snow is there
 
02:36:22.010 --> 02:36:22.020 align:start position:0%
anyone else in the committee that wishes
 
02:36:23.349 --> 02:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
to speak
 
02:36:26.270 --> 02:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
representative gay I submitted thank you
 
02:36:29.090 --> 02:36:29.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I submitted a
 
02:36:31.610 --> 02:36:31.620 align:start position:0%
an amendment that would have brought
 
02:36:34.670 --> 02:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
corrective wording to that that
 
02:36:38.090 --> 02:36:38.100 align:start position:0%
concerned people about sick people
 
02:36:39.889 --> 02:36:39.899 align:start position:0%
uh just
 
02:36:42.170 --> 02:36:42.180 align:start position:0%
pretending that it didn't matter that
 
02:36:44.030 --> 02:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
they would go anywhere they wanted to
 
02:36:48.290 --> 02:36:48.300 align:start position:0%
and uh so OLS is pretty fast so I just
 
02:36:50.750 --> 02:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to say that I did submit that
 
02:36:53.570 --> 02:36:53.580 align:start position:0%
a couple hours ago
 
02:36:56.450 --> 02:36:56.460 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
02:36:59.270 --> 02:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
yes representative King thank you Mr
 
02:37:02.870 --> 02:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
Speaker yeah Mr chairman didn't want to
 
02:37:03.950 --> 02:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
elevate you no
 
02:37:03.960 --> 02:37:06.050 align:start position:0%
elevate you no
[Music]

02:37:06.050 --> 02:37:06.060 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:37:09.410 --> 02:37:09.420 align:start position:0%
um so thank you Mr chair
 
02:37:11.570 --> 02:37:11.580 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm a little confused because
 
02:37:14.510 --> 02:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
the way I was reading where I was
 
02:37:15.770 --> 02:37:15.780 align:start position:0%
reading this bill
 
02:37:18.469 --> 02:37:18.479 align:start position:0%
is that it was about the Discrimination
 
02:37:20.929 --> 02:37:20.939 align:start position:0%
discrimination and yet I hear a lot of
 
02:37:23.270 --> 02:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
the discussion is about
 
02:37:25.490 --> 02:37:25.500 align:start position:0%
whether it's the right thing to wear a
 
02:37:27.650 --> 02:37:27.660 align:start position:0%
mask or not and
 
02:37:27.660 --> 02:37:28.429 align:start position:0%
mask or not and
um

02:37:28.429 --> 02:37:28.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:37:32.750 --> 02:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
I I'm with uh representative Cushman
 
02:37:35.270 --> 02:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
that we should take another look at the
 
02:37:37.610 --> 02:37:37.620 align:start position:0%
language because it's apparently
 
02:37:37.620 --> 02:37:44.210 align:start position:0%
language because it's apparently
confusing

02:37:44.210 --> 02:37:44.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:46.550 --> 02:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
representative canark
 
02:37:48.410 --> 02:37:48.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:37:51.770 --> 02:37:51.780 align:start position:0%
um basically my feeling is that this uh
 
02:37:56.210 --> 02:37:56.220 align:start position:0%
by accepting this we uh take away the
 
02:37:58.370 --> 02:37:58.380 align:start position:0%
right of the business
 
02:38:00.230 --> 02:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
um or the organ well the business I'll
 
02:38:02.450 --> 02:38:02.460 align:start position:0%
leave it that way to be able to set
 
02:38:05.330 --> 02:38:05.340 align:start position:0%
rules that they wish to enforce in terms
 
02:38:08.410 --> 02:38:08.420 align:start position:0%
of people in their establishment and
 
02:38:12.830 --> 02:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
we're not again we do as as the we spoke
 
02:38:14.990 --> 02:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
about with the person who testified
 
02:38:17.090 --> 02:38:17.100 align:start position:0%
earlier there are protected groups and
 
02:38:18.830 --> 02:38:18.840 align:start position:0%
they would be still protected so you
 
02:38:21.530 --> 02:38:21.540 align:start position:0%
can't discriminate because of
 
02:38:25.010 --> 02:38:25.020 align:start position:0%
um issues of of race or gender and so on
 
02:38:28.010 --> 02:38:28.020 align:start position:0%
but the issue is in public health we
 
02:38:31.070 --> 02:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes have to uh lessen some of our
 
02:38:32.450 --> 02:38:32.460 align:start position:0%
individual rights
 
02:38:35.090 --> 02:38:35.100 align:start position:0%
for the safety of the population as a
 
02:38:37.490 --> 02:38:37.500 align:start position:0%
whole and I think that if a business
 
02:38:40.250 --> 02:38:40.260 align:start position:0%
wishes to set up a rule that says that
 
02:38:42.889 --> 02:38:42.899 align:start position:0%
they want to protect their customers
 
02:38:45.590 --> 02:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
and their employees
 
02:38:48.889 --> 02:38:48.899 align:start position:0%
that the person who wishes to patronize
 
02:38:51.050 --> 02:38:51.060 align:start position:0%
without wearing a mask still has the
 
02:38:53.270 --> 02:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
perfect right to not wear a mask they
 
02:38:55.370 --> 02:38:55.380 align:start position:0%
just go somewhere else where they don't
 
02:38:56.330 --> 02:38:56.340 align:start position:0%
really care
 
02:38:58.969 --> 02:38:58.979 align:start position:0%
and so that freedom is still balanced
 
02:39:00.290 --> 02:39:00.300 align:start position:0%
they still have a freedom to go
 
02:39:02.870 --> 02:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
elsewhere if they choose to do so but we
 
02:39:04.790 --> 02:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
preserve the freedom of that business to
 
02:39:06.710 --> 02:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
protect their other customers and to
 
02:39:09.530 --> 02:39:09.540 align:start position:0%
protect their workers so I definitely
 
02:39:11.750 --> 02:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
vote itl
 
02:39:20.389 --> 02:39:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:22.370 --> 02:39:22.380 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else in the committee
 
02:39:24.230 --> 02:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
who wishes to speak there's two
 
02:39:26.690 --> 02:39:26.700 align:start position:0%
hands-ups yeah but I can't identify them
 
02:39:32.230 --> 02:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:37.070 --> 02:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
so uh hand number one can speak
 
02:39:39.469 --> 02:39:39.479 align:start position:0%
I thank you Mr chair and Don thank you
 
02:39:40.730 --> 02:39:40.740 align:start position:0%
everybody for your time
 
02:39:44.150 --> 02:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
obviously this is a a tough one we've
 
02:39:47.570 --> 02:39:47.580 align:start position:0%
been through the ringer on mask issues
 
02:39:50.150 --> 02:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
um it's hit really close to home with
 
02:39:51.590 --> 02:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
this body
 
02:39:54.290 --> 02:39:54.300 align:start position:0%
um it's important to remember that the
 
02:39:55.910 --> 02:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
the issue with mass has been highly
 
02:39:58.730 --> 02:39:58.740 align:start position:0%
politicized one year ago today is when
 
02:40:00.469 --> 02:40:00.479 align:start position:0%
Dr fauci made the statement that we
 
02:40:02.809 --> 02:40:02.819 align:start position:0%
didn't really have to wear masks then
 
02:40:05.030 --> 02:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
several months later he admitted he did
 
02:40:06.349 --> 02:40:06.359 align:start position:0%
that because he didn't want to create a
 
02:40:08.809 --> 02:40:08.819 align:start position:0%
run-on masks that would take them away
 
02:40:11.450 --> 02:40:11.460 align:start position:0%
from first responses responders and it
 
02:40:15.889 --> 02:40:15.899 align:start position:0%
wasn't until April of 2020 that the CDC
 
02:40:17.750 --> 02:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
finally came out and said yes we need to
 
02:40:20.389 --> 02:40:20.399 align:start position:0%
wear masks so this whole situation got
 
02:40:22.969 --> 02:40:22.979 align:start position:0%
off on a on a bad foot now
 
02:40:25.429 --> 02:40:25.439 align:start position:0%
having said that my wife leaves the
 
02:40:27.250 --> 02:40:27.260 align:start position:0%
house every single day
 
02:40:30.590 --> 02:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
and goes out into homes with people that
 
02:40:32.210 --> 02:40:32.220 align:start position:0%
are effective with covid and never got
 
02:40:34.389 --> 02:40:34.399 align:start position:0%
it because she wears her mask every day
 
02:40:37.190 --> 02:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot to this
 
02:40:41.510 --> 02:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
um ultimately I I'm I'm going to vote um
 
02:40:44.210 --> 02:40:44.220 align:start position:0%
to retain so that this this discussion
 
02:40:48.410 --> 02:40:48.420 align:start position:0%
can continue rather than just to itl
 
02:40:50.690 --> 02:40:50.700 align:start position:0%
But ultimately as it stands right now I
 
02:40:52.550 --> 02:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't um
 
02:40:54.590 --> 02:40:54.600 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't support putting this into law
 
02:40:56.330 --> 02:40:56.340 align:start position:0%
like if
 
02:40:59.990 --> 02:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you and hand number two
 
02:41:02.570 --> 02:41:02.580 align:start position:0%
other hand thank you thank you Mr
 
02:41:02.580 --> 02:41:04.130 align:start position:0%
other hand thank you thank you Mr
chairman

02:41:04.130 --> 02:41:04.140 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
02:41:07.370 --> 02:41:07.380 align:start position:0%
um I too would prefer strongly prefer to
 
02:41:10.330 --> 02:41:10.340 align:start position:0%
see this bill retained
 
02:41:14.030 --> 02:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
there are very valid differences of
 
02:41:17.570 --> 02:41:17.580 align:start position:0%
opinion in the medical community
 
02:41:19.969 --> 02:41:19.979 align:start position:0%
um there are uh there are valid
 
02:41:22.809 --> 02:41:22.819 align:start position:0%
differences opinion as to the wisdom of
 
02:41:25.550 --> 02:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
uh taking the the covid vaccine
 
02:41:27.590 --> 02:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
currently there are valid differences of
 
02:41:30.530 --> 02:41:30.540 align:start position:0%
opinion regarding masks
 
02:41:33.889 --> 02:41:33.899 align:start position:0%
um and certain medications that can help
 
02:41:37.370 --> 02:41:37.380 align:start position:0%
to treat people with covid
 
02:41:37.380 --> 02:41:38.389 align:start position:0%
to treat people with covid
um

02:41:38.389 --> 02:41:38.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:41.570 --> 02:41:41.580 align:start position:0%
you know I I hear the the concerns about
 
02:41:44.389 --> 02:41:44.399 align:start position:0%
the rights of businesses the problem is
 
02:41:47.450 --> 02:41:47.460 align:start position:0%
that when every business out there is is
 
02:41:49.570 --> 02:41:49.580 align:start position:0%
is Towing the party line
 
02:41:52.370 --> 02:41:52.380 align:start position:0%
there may very well not be another place
 
02:41:53.990 --> 02:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
to go
 
02:41:57.770 --> 02:41:57.780 align:start position:0%
um if uh if you want to uh I mean even
 
02:41:59.690 --> 02:41:59.700 align:start position:0%
before the mass mandate if you wanted to
 
02:42:02.690 --> 02:42:02.700 align:start position:0%
go somewhere and Shop without a mask you
 
02:42:04.130 --> 02:42:04.140 align:start position:0%
were suddenly starting to be very
 
02:42:06.889 --> 02:42:06.899 align:start position:0%
limited because the the all of the the
 
02:42:10.309 --> 02:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
bigger stores were uh were issuing their
 
02:42:12.110 --> 02:42:12.120 align:start position:0%
own kinds of mandates and that was
 
02:42:14.450 --> 02:42:14.460 align:start position:0%
quickly followed
 
02:42:16.670 --> 02:42:16.680 align:start position:0%
um you know there are a lot of people
 
02:42:19.490 --> 02:42:19.500 align:start position:0%
who for whatever reason cannot wear a
 
02:42:21.889 --> 02:42:21.899 align:start position:0%
mask I don't think that it is
 
02:42:25.610 --> 02:42:25.620 align:start position:0%
moral for us to force those people to
 
02:42:28.070 --> 02:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
constantly explain themselves I have an
 
02:42:30.290 --> 02:42:30.300 align:start position:0%
issue with that I know people who are
 
02:42:32.389 --> 02:42:32.399 align:start position:0%
very upset by this I have spoken to
 
02:42:34.610 --> 02:42:34.620 align:start position:0%
people in our state who have said they
 
02:42:37.010 --> 02:42:37.020 align:start position:0%
are thinking about moving out of New
 
02:42:39.770 --> 02:42:39.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because they are so upset by
 
02:42:42.290 --> 02:42:42.300 align:start position:0%
this they're also not sure
 
02:42:44.510 --> 02:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
what their other options are in terms of
 
02:42:46.130 --> 02:42:46.140 align:start position:0%
where they can go
 
02:42:49.969 --> 02:42:49.979 align:start position:0%
but this is a deeply held belief there
 
02:42:52.490 --> 02:42:52.500 align:start position:0%
are very valid differences of opinion in
 
02:42:55.190 --> 02:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh in in medicine
 
02:42:57.830 --> 02:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
um and you know I I think that
 
02:43:00.050 --> 02:43:00.060 align:start position:0%
representative Acton put it well which
 
02:43:02.030 --> 02:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
is that this is an important discussion
 
02:43:06.710 --> 02:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
and I think it is it is uh our our duty
 
02:43:09.290 --> 02:43:09.300 align:start position:0%
It's Our obligation to continue the
 
02:43:11.510 --> 02:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
conversation around this issue with
 
02:43:13.790 --> 02:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
whichever side of this issue you are on
 
02:43:16.190 --> 02:43:16.200 align:start position:0%
I think that we ought to be continuing
 
02:43:18.110 --> 02:43:18.120 align:start position:0%
this discussion
 
02:43:20.090 --> 02:43:20.100 align:start position:0%
um I I also will say that I think some
 
02:43:22.610 --> 02:43:22.620 align:start position:0%
of the concerns about
 
02:43:23.929 --> 02:43:23.939 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
02:43:26.690 --> 02:43:26.700 align:start position:0%
tuberculosis you know medical workers
 
02:43:29.929 --> 02:43:29.939 align:start position:0%
with tuberculosis or or typhoid are are
 
02:43:29.939 --> 02:43:31.370 align:start position:0%
with tuberculosis or or typhoid are are
overstated

02:43:31.370 --> 02:43:31.380 align:start position:0%
overstated
 
02:43:33.050 --> 02:43:33.060 align:start position:0%
um partially because I think most people
 
02:43:34.910 --> 02:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
are responsible and I just don't think
 
02:43:37.910 --> 02:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
that that is a is a likely scenario and
 
02:43:39.889 --> 02:43:39.899 align:start position:0%
partially because I think that there are
 
02:43:42.830 --> 02:43:42.840 align:start position:0%
other laws already in place that cover
 
02:43:46.370 --> 02:43:46.380 align:start position:0%
that we we amended HB I think it was 220
 
02:43:48.530 --> 02:43:48.540 align:start position:0%
or 221
 
02:43:51.410 --> 02:43:51.420 align:start position:0%
um to to call out some of those
 
02:43:55.190 --> 02:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
exemptions specifically so this bill can
 
02:43:57.590 --> 02:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
be made to work
 
02:43:59.809 --> 02:43:59.819 align:start position:0%
um it it does need some clarifying
 
02:44:02.929 --> 02:44:02.939 align:start position:0%
language and I think that it is an
 
02:44:05.929 --> 02:44:05.939 align:start position:0%
important issue that we as a committee
 
02:44:08.570 --> 02:44:08.580 align:start position:0%
ought to continue to stay engaged on and
 
02:44:10.370 --> 02:44:10.380 align:start position:0%
that's why I would prefer to see this
 
02:44:10.380 --> 02:44:11.690 align:start position:0%
that's why I would prefer to see this
retained

02:44:11.690 --> 02:44:11.700 align:start position:0%
retained
 
02:44:15.050 --> 02:44:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:18.050 --> 02:44:18.060 align:start position:0%
representative Marsh uh thank you Mr
 
02:44:21.889 --> 02:44:21.899 align:start position:0%
Turner as many of you know I spent some
 
02:44:23.570 --> 02:44:23.580 align:start position:0%
time over the last year on the
 
02:44:25.429 --> 02:44:25.439 align:start position:0%
governor's economic for the opening task
 
02:44:25.439 --> 02:44:26.450 align:start position:0%
governor's economic for the opening task
force

02:44:26.450 --> 02:44:26.460 align:start position:0%
force
 
02:44:28.550 --> 02:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
and one of the principles that we
 
02:44:31.370 --> 02:44:31.380 align:start position:0%
maintain throughout the year was that
 
02:44:34.330 --> 02:44:34.340 align:start position:0%
businesses had the right to put
 
02:44:36.710 --> 02:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
restrictions in place in their own
 
02:44:39.050 --> 02:44:39.060 align:start position:0%
business as they saw a fit to protect
 
02:44:42.349 --> 02:44:42.359 align:start position:0%
themselves and their employees
 
02:44:44.690 --> 02:44:44.700 align:start position:0%
to me it's fairly clear that the intent
 
02:44:48.710 --> 02:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
of this bill is to override that such
 
02:44:50.929 --> 02:44:50.939 align:start position:0%
that people who
 
02:44:53.270 --> 02:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
maintain a business that caters to the
 
02:44:55.070 --> 02:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
public would not be able to put such
 
02:44:56.990 --> 02:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
restrictions in place
 
02:44:59.990 --> 02:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh to me that's a step too far on the
 
02:45:03.050 --> 02:45:03.060 align:start position:0%
other hand I agree with several
 
02:45:04.250 --> 02:45:04.260 align:start position:0%
Representatives who said the
 
02:45:06.230 --> 02:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
conversation needs to continue I agree
 
02:45:07.849 --> 02:45:07.859 align:start position:0%
totally the conversation needs to
 
02:45:07.859 --> 02:45:08.870 align:start position:0%
totally the conversation needs to
continue

02:45:08.870 --> 02:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
continue
 
02:45:11.510 --> 02:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
I believe that we did take a step in
 
02:45:13.670 --> 02:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
this Direction with Hospital 220 which
 
02:45:16.010 --> 02:45:16.020 align:start position:0%
we amended and passed
 
02:45:17.870 --> 02:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
um but I think that we were very careful
 
02:45:20.809 --> 02:45:20.819 align:start position:0%
and wanted to do that not to remove from
 
02:45:22.790 --> 02:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
businesses the right to put whatever
 
02:45:24.950 --> 02:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
rules in place they thought they needed
 
02:45:26.870 --> 02:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
to in their business to protect their
 
02:45:29.270 --> 02:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
employees which is the line that I am
 
02:45:31.730 --> 02:45:31.740 align:start position:0%
not willing to cross and therefore I
 
02:45:35.630 --> 02:45:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:43.130 --> 02:45:43.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:44.690 --> 02:45:44.700 align:start position:0%
and we'll do a quick run to
 
02:45:47.330 --> 02:45:47.340 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman thank you Mr
 
02:45:50.830 --> 02:45:50.840 align:start position:0%
chairman yet oh Lucy
 
02:45:53.570 --> 02:45:53.580 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman okay
 
02:45:56.150 --> 02:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman I I just want
 
02:45:59.630 --> 02:45:59.640 align:start position:0%
to speak to representative Marsh's Point
 
02:46:02.570 --> 02:46:02.580 align:start position:0%
um about businesses I think that many
 
02:46:06.170 --> 02:46:06.180 align:start position:0%
many businesses are requiring masks for
 
02:46:08.710 --> 02:46:08.720 align:start position:0%
entry because they are facing pressure
 
02:46:11.809 --> 02:46:11.819 align:start position:0%
from local Health officers from the
 
02:46:14.150 --> 02:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office and they do
 
02:46:17.270 --> 02:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
not understand or feel that they cannot
 
02:46:20.210 --> 02:46:20.220 align:start position:0%
accommodate people who are exempt under
 
02:46:24.590 --> 02:46:24.600 align:start position:0%
emergency order 74. so I would I would
 
02:46:27.410 --> 02:46:27.420 align:start position:0%
suggest that this bill be retained and
 
02:46:29.809 --> 02:46:29.819 align:start position:0%
maybe we can put in a clause
 
02:46:34.010 --> 02:46:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:37.490 --> 02:46:37.500 align:start position:0%
or you know no one shall be forced you
 
02:46:40.250 --> 02:46:40.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:40.260 --> 02:46:41.990 align:start position:0%
 
unless

02:46:41.990 --> 02:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
unless
 
02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:42.650 align:start position:0%
unless
um

02:46:42.650 --> 02:46:42.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:46:45.650 --> 02:46:45.660 align:start position:0%
unless the owner of the business doesn't
 
02:46:48.410 --> 02:46:48.420 align:start position:0%
you know unless the business owner makes
 
02:46:51.190 --> 02:46:51.200 align:start position:0%
the policy for their business because
 
02:46:54.349 --> 02:46:54.359 align:start position:0%
then that would allow
 
02:46:57.349 --> 02:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
other businesses who don't want to force
 
02:46:59.630 --> 02:46:59.640 align:start position:0%
customers to wear masks to feel like
 
02:47:01.250 --> 02:47:01.260 align:start position:0%
they have the freedom to make that
 
02:47:03.650 --> 02:47:03.660 align:start position:0%
choice because right now with all the
 
02:47:06.530 --> 02:47:06.540 align:start position:0%
pressure coming from the AG and the
 
02:47:08.870 --> 02:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
health officers and the threats of fines
 
02:47:10.670 --> 02:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
that businesses are getting
 
02:47:13.790 --> 02:47:13.800 align:start position:0%
even though peop the public is exempt
 
02:47:15.290 --> 02:47:15.300 align:start position:0%
under certain conditions from wearing
 
02:47:15.300 --> 02:47:16.610 align:start position:0%
under certain conditions from wearing
masks

02:47:16.610 --> 02:47:16.620 align:start position:0%
masks
 
02:47:18.770 --> 02:47:18.780 align:start position:0%
they still feel that they have to force
 
02:47:20.389 --> 02:47:20.399 align:start position:0%
customers to wear masks and I've I've
 
02:47:23.570 --> 02:47:23.580 align:start position:0%
talked to many businesses about this so
 
02:47:26.630 --> 02:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
I I would really press that
 
02:47:28.730 --> 02:47:28.740 align:start position:0%
um that my fellow committee members
 
02:47:31.490 --> 02:47:31.500 align:start position:0%
would um vote no on the itl so that we
 
02:47:34.250 --> 02:47:34.260 align:start position:0%
can retain and work on this Bill thank
 
02:47:36.590 --> 02:47:36.600 align:start position:0%
you representative Weber
 
02:47:39.050 --> 02:47:39.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I have only two
 
02:47:42.410 --> 02:47:42.420 align:start position:0%
points that haven't been made to date uh
 
02:47:44.630 --> 02:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
the one is
 
02:47:47.330 --> 02:47:47.340 align:start position:0%
I very much understand the concern for
 
02:47:49.670 --> 02:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
the rights of the individuals that are
 
02:47:52.610 --> 02:47:52.620 align:start position:0%
trying to be addressed here uh but the
 
02:47:56.809 --> 02:47:56.819 align:start position:0%
other thing that I see is the equally
 
02:47:59.929 --> 02:47:59.939 align:start position:0%
important rights of individuals most of
 
02:48:03.349 --> 02:48:03.359 align:start position:0%
whom are either elderly or are medically
 
02:48:03.359 --> 02:48:04.809 align:start position:0%
whom are either elderly or are medically
fragile

02:48:04.809 --> 02:48:04.819 align:start position:0%
fragile
 
02:48:08.690 --> 02:48:08.700 align:start position:0%
and those are people who the coveted
 
02:48:12.770 --> 02:48:12.780 align:start position:0%
pandemic has particularly circumscribed
 
02:48:15.889 --> 02:48:15.899 align:start position:0%
their lives and
 
02:48:20.270 --> 02:48:20.280 align:start position:0%
both in this time of
 
02:48:22.429 --> 02:48:22.439 align:start position:0%
um you know right now we're operating
 
02:48:25.190 --> 02:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
under an emergency order which will go
 
02:48:30.349 --> 02:48:30.359 align:start position:0%
away when uh circumstances change
 
02:48:32.809 --> 02:48:32.819 align:start position:0%
um and my hope is that that will be
 
02:48:35.450 --> 02:48:35.460 align:start position:0%
sooner rather than later but we don't
 
02:48:38.210 --> 02:48:38.220 align:start position:0%
know so I'm comfortable with the way
 
02:48:40.090 --> 02:48:40.100 align:start position:0%
things are under the emergency order
 
02:48:42.830 --> 02:48:42.840 align:start position:0%
being aware that when the emergency
 
02:48:46.849 --> 02:48:46.859 align:start position:0%
order goes the mass mandate goes too and
 
02:48:50.090 --> 02:48:50.100 align:start position:0%
there will be no reason for anybody who
 
02:48:51.950 --> 02:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
owns a business to do anything other
 
02:48:54.650 --> 02:48:54.660 align:start position:0%
than State their own position and then
 
02:48:57.469 --> 02:48:57.479 align:start position:0%
people can vote either with their their
 
02:48:59.650 --> 02:48:59.660 align:start position:0%
feeder with their dollars
 
02:49:05.570 --> 02:49:05.580 align:start position:0%
but I do want to just remind people that
 
02:49:08.690 --> 02:49:08.700 align:start position:0%
um cloth masks don't protect
 
02:49:10.370 --> 02:49:10.380 align:start position:0%
the person who's wearing them
 
02:49:12.710 --> 02:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
particularly well they they do certainly
 
02:49:16.190 --> 02:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
protect them somewhat but
 
02:49:19.790 --> 02:49:19.800 align:start position:0%
um I I do want to remind people that
 
02:49:22.370 --> 02:49:22.380 align:start position:0%
we're balancing the rights of two
 
02:49:25.190 --> 02:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
different groups of individuals it's not
 
02:49:28.250 --> 02:49:28.260 align:start position:0%
just individuals versus the government
 
02:49:31.070 --> 02:49:31.080 align:start position:0%
and and that's a really tough balance
 
02:49:32.929 --> 02:49:32.939 align:start position:0%
and I I get it that it's a difficult
 
02:49:35.929 --> 02:49:35.939 align:start position:0%
question but I'll be voting for The itl
 
02:49:38.270 --> 02:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:49:41.150 --> 02:49:41.160 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant
 
02:49:44.150 --> 02:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
02:49:46.190 --> 02:49:46.200 align:start position:0%
um this is a I don't believe this issue
 
02:49:48.889 --> 02:49:48.899 align:start position:0%
has been raised but my concern is going
 
02:49:51.050 --> 02:49:51.060 align:start position:0%
to be the elderly particularly in the
 
02:49:53.090 --> 02:49:53.100 align:start position:0%
nursing homes the way this bill is
 
02:49:55.309 --> 02:49:55.319 align:start position:0%
written uh there's nothing to prevent a
 
02:49:57.590 --> 02:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
person from going into a nursing home if
 
02:49:59.690 --> 02:49:59.700 align:start position:0%
the nursing home is trying to
 
02:50:02.330 --> 02:50:02.340 align:start position:0%
protect their elderly we know of that
 
02:50:04.010 --> 02:50:04.020 align:start position:0%
Cove has been rampant in some of the
 
02:50:05.809 --> 02:50:05.819 align:start position:0%
nursing homes and so forth and the
 
02:50:08.750 --> 02:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
ability for them to shut down
 
02:50:10.550 --> 02:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
um the entrance into their establishment
 
02:50:11.929 --> 02:50:11.939 align:start position:0%
to protect the album they think it's
 
02:50:13.070 --> 02:50:13.080 align:start position:0%
important and the way this bill's
 
02:50:15.950 --> 02:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
written today that would not pertain
 
02:50:17.450 --> 02:50:17.460 align:start position:0%
they would actually have the right to go
 
02:50:19.429 --> 02:50:19.439 align:start position:0%
into the building whether a nursing home
 
02:50:22.130 --> 02:50:22.140 align:start position:0%
believed that was right Public Health
 
02:50:25.429 --> 02:50:25.439 align:start position:0%
policy so because of those reasons I
 
02:50:27.349 --> 02:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
would vote
 
02:50:30.290 --> 02:50:30.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:35.630 --> 02:50:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:39.050 --> 02:50:39.060 align:start position:0%
the motion by the way
 
02:50:41.330 --> 02:50:41.340 align:start position:0%
um I'm getting some what used to be
 
02:50:42.710 --> 02:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
called blue sheets
 
02:50:46.969 --> 02:50:46.979 align:start position:0%
uh people riding in with a physician
 
02:50:50.450 --> 02:50:50.460 align:start position:0%

much

02:53:44.510 --> 02:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:46.210 --> 02:53:46.220 align:start position:0%
I opened the
 
02:53:52.250 --> 02:53:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:54.590 --> 02:53:54.600 align:start position:0%
requiring Health Care Providers to
 
02:53:57.290 --> 02:53:57.300 align:start position:0%
furnish upon requests
 
02:54:00.230 --> 02:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
a list of ingredients contained in an
 
02:54:02.570 --> 02:54:02.580 align:start position:0%
injectable medication that is
 
02:54:06.590 --> 02:54:06.600 align:start position:0%
recommended or administered and we first
 
02:54:16.150 --> 02:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:19.370 --> 02:54:19.380 align:start position:0%
which is an amendment brought to us on
 
02:54:22.190 --> 02:54:22.200 align:start position:0%
February 25th by representative Marsh
 
02:54:25.670 --> 02:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
and representative Merchants would one
 
02:54:27.530 --> 02:54:27.540 align:start position:0%
of you like to speak to the amendment
 
02:54:31.550 --> 02:54:31.560 align:start position:0%
please yes Mr chairman I'll be left
 
02:54:34.969 --> 02:54:34.979 align:start position:0%
but the amendment does it clarifies what
 
02:54:38.090 --> 02:54:38.100 align:start position:0%
a list of experience is by federal law
 
02:54:40.490 --> 02:54:40.500 align:start position:0%
for injectable medications and active
 
02:54:42.830 --> 02:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
ingredients are required to be listed on
 
02:54:44.650 --> 02:54:44.660 align:start position:0%
this label
 
02:54:47.870 --> 02:54:47.880 align:start position:0%
for injectable medications and so
 
02:54:52.070 --> 02:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
therefore this allows the iconic label
 
02:54:56.330 --> 02:54:56.340 align:start position:0%
or a copy of the label which is on file
 
02:54:57.670 --> 02:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
on the
 
02:55:00.950 --> 02:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
archive of the medicine federal
 
02:55:03.650 --> 02:55:03.660 align:start position:0%
government to be printed out and given
 
02:55:06.790 --> 02:55:06.800 align:start position:0%
to someone who requests it as a list of
 
02:55:11.630 --> 02:55:11.640 align:start position:0%
the ingredients and the facility is a
 
02:55:14.030 --> 02:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
privilege it's actually important
 
02:55:16.610 --> 02:55:16.620 align:start position:0%
because we're moving the label from an
 
02:55:21.730 --> 02:55:21.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:26.809 --> 02:55:26.819 align:start position:0%
it also pays attention to what the FDA
 
02:55:28.790 --> 02:55:28.800 align:start position:0%
guidelines are what
 
02:55:31.070 --> 02:55:31.080 align:start position:0%
connect with ingredients must be listed
 
02:55:31.080 --> 02:55:34.910 align:start position:0%
connect with ingredients must be listed
uh

02:55:34.910 --> 02:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:40.429 --> 02:55:40.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:44.210 --> 02:55:44.220 align:start position:0%
thank you did we move and second this
 
02:55:46.070 --> 02:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
I don't believe something I don't think
 
02:55:48.410 --> 02:55:48.420 align:start position:0%
we did I will move uh Amendment zero
 
02:55:51.050 --> 02:55:51.060 align:start position:0%
five zero seven representative Merchant
 
02:55:52.849 --> 02:55:52.859 align:start position:0%
would you like to second I will second
 
02:56:03.349 --> 02:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:06.050 --> 02:56:06.060 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that the amendment keeps
 
02:56:09.230 --> 02:56:09.240 align:start position:0%
the hearts of what the original bill was
 
02:56:11.750 --> 02:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
about but makes it more practical or
 
02:56:15.230 --> 02:56:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:17.990 --> 02:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
02:56:21.170 --> 02:56:21.180 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman yes representative Merchant
 
02:56:24.710 --> 02:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I totally agree it
 
02:56:28.429 --> 02:56:28.439 align:start position:0%
retains the intent of the original bill
 
02:56:30.230 --> 02:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
um to provide the information to a
 
02:56:32.150 --> 02:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
patient or their caregiver
 
02:56:34.849 --> 02:56:34.859 align:start position:0%
that also does exclude
 
02:56:37.730 --> 02:56:37.740 align:start position:0%
situations in which we talk about with
 
02:56:39.889 --> 02:56:39.899 align:start position:0%
clinical trials and having to break the
 
02:56:41.450 --> 02:56:41.460 align:start position:0%
trial which would not be beneficial to
 
02:56:42.950 --> 02:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
the patient because they're the ones
 
02:56:46.309 --> 02:56:46.319 align:start position:0%
opting into a trial and number two it
 
02:56:48.769 --> 02:56:48.779 align:start position:0%
does exempt in emergency situation where
 
02:56:50.630 --> 02:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
the provider believes at that point in
 
02:56:53.349 --> 02:56:53.359 align:start position:0%
time the need to care for the patient
 
02:56:55.550 --> 02:56:55.560 align:start position:0%
trumps if you will the right to get the
 
02:56:55.560 --> 02:56:57.590 align:start position:0%
trumps if you will the right to get the
information

02:56:57.590 --> 02:56:57.600 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:56:57.600 --> 02:57:05.469 align:start position:0%
information
foreign

02:57:05.469 --> 02:57:05.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:08.450 --> 02:57:08.460 align:start position:0%
representative Weber thank you very much
 
02:57:10.550 --> 02:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question I
 
02:57:13.190 --> 02:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
seem to be on I I seem to have once
 
02:57:15.650 --> 02:57:15.660 align:start position:0%
again lost track of my Amendment so I
 
02:57:17.690 --> 02:57:17.700 align:start position:0%
can't find it and put it right in front
 
02:57:22.610 --> 02:57:22.620 align:start position:0%
of me but what I my question is is
 
02:57:25.790 --> 02:57:25.800 align:start position:0%
does the amendment address the problem
 
02:57:29.330 --> 02:57:29.340 align:start position:0%
that we were spoken to about the bill
 
02:57:33.469 --> 02:57:33.479 align:start position:0%
um it sounds to me like what you've done
 
02:57:35.929 --> 02:57:35.939 align:start position:0%
is just say the list of ingredients that
 
02:57:38.570 --> 02:57:38.580 align:start position:0%
would be on a label if if there were a
 
02:57:40.429 --> 02:57:40.439 align:start position:0%
label as opposed to somebody approaching
 
02:57:43.790 --> 02:57:43.800 align:start position:0%
your car with a with a shot
 
02:57:47.389 --> 02:57:47.399 align:start position:0%
um or sitting in your whatever
 
02:57:47.399 --> 02:57:48.050 align:start position:0%
um or sitting in your whatever
um

02:57:48.050 --> 02:57:48.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:57:51.410 --> 02:57:51.420 align:start position:0%
that the list of ingredients is going to
 
02:57:54.110 --> 02:57:54.120 align:start position:0%
be made available to them
 
02:57:56.590 --> 02:57:56.600 align:start position:0%
um but we're not going to require
 
02:58:00.290 --> 02:58:00.300 align:start position:0%
more than what is required currently
 
02:58:03.349 --> 02:58:03.359 align:start position:0%
federally in terms of labeling uh
 
02:58:05.630 --> 02:58:05.640 align:start position:0%
because my my concern here is making
 
02:58:09.530 --> 02:58:09.540 align:start position:0%
sure that we don't run a foul of uh
 
02:58:11.929 --> 02:58:11.939 align:start position:0%
Federal preemption or the Commerce
 
02:58:14.450 --> 02:58:14.460 align:start position:0%
Clause or all of those things that made
 
02:58:16.670 --> 02:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
my eyes glaze over in law school and
 
02:58:18.469 --> 02:58:18.479 align:start position:0%
that I haven't thought about as much as
 
02:58:22.010 --> 02:58:22.020 align:start position:0%
I ought to have since uh or maybe I'm
 
02:58:23.630 --> 02:58:23.640 align:start position:0%
very glad I haven't thought about them
 
02:58:26.269 --> 02:58:26.279 align:start position:0%
since uh so that that's the concern that
 
02:58:28.070 --> 02:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
I hope has been addressed and I'm
 
02:58:32.030 --> 02:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
willing to take your Assurance for it if
 
02:58:40.150 --> 02:58:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:43.610 --> 02:58:43.620 align:start position:0%
but if you look at the amendment and if
 
02:58:47.750 --> 02:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
you look online so 15 to 17 what it says
 
02:58:50.210 --> 02:58:50.220 align:start position:0%
is a list of the medications ingredients
 
02:58:52.490 --> 02:58:52.500 align:start position:0%
it's a copy of the label on the
 
02:58:54.530 --> 02:58:54.540 align:start position:0%
injectable medication that's regulated
 
02:58:57.429 --> 02:58:57.439 align:start position:0%
by 21 CFR section
 
02:59:00.830 --> 02:59:00.840 align:start position:0%
201.100 B5 whereas listed in the
 
02:59:02.809 --> 02:59:02.819 align:start position:0%
dailyvee database maintained by the
 
02:59:04.190 --> 02:59:04.200 align:start position:0%
United States National Library of
 
02:59:09.170 --> 02:59:09.180 align:start position:0%
Medicine uh to um 100 V5 it's exactly
 
02:59:11.750 --> 02:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
the exactly that you're referring to and
 
02:59:14.330 --> 02:59:14.340 align:start position:0%
so therefore it does not take any uh
 
02:59:14.340 --> 02:59:16.670 align:start position:0%
so therefore it does not take any uh
requirements

02:59:16.670 --> 02:59:16.680 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
02:59:19.490 --> 02:59:19.500 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I appreciate it
 
02:59:20.870 --> 02:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
what else
 
02:59:26.389 --> 02:59:26.399 align:start position:0%
yes uh Mr Mr chair representative yes I
 
02:59:28.190 --> 02:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
just wanted to ask a question regarding
 
02:59:30.110 --> 02:59:30.120 align:start position:0%
the mechanics then of how this would
 
02:59:30.120 --> 02:59:31.130 align:start position:0%
the mechanics then of how this would
work

02:59:31.130 --> 02:59:31.140 align:start position:0%
work
 
02:59:33.590 --> 02:59:33.600 align:start position:0%
so the prescription drug manufacturer
 
02:59:35.510 --> 02:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
provides this information
 
02:59:38.330 --> 02:59:38.340 align:start position:0%
uh you have a patient in the office they
 
02:59:40.550 --> 02:59:40.560 align:start position:0%
request this information
 
02:59:43.190 --> 02:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
as a provider
 
02:59:45.530 --> 02:59:45.540 align:start position:0%
um where are you going to as a provider
 
02:59:47.570 --> 02:59:47.580 align:start position:0%
be able to find this information quickly
 
02:59:49.730 --> 02:59:49.740 align:start position:0%
print it and give it to the patient just
 
02:59:52.190 --> 02:59:52.200 align:start position:0%
how does that work from a practical
 
02:59:55.849 --> 02:59:55.859 align:start position:0%
point of view either office or hospital
 
03:00:04.010 --> 03:00:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:06.769 --> 03:00:06.779 align:start position:0%
representative Martian
 
03:00:09.110 --> 03:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
another question uh you would be able to
 
03:00:11.210 --> 03:00:11.220 align:start position:0%
copy the information off the label which
 
03:00:13.070 --> 03:00:13.080 align:start position:0%
could be done simply by taking the label
 
03:00:15.349 --> 03:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
putting it in your copy machine or you
 
03:00:17.630 --> 03:00:17.640 align:start position:0%
can access the dailyved database which
 
03:00:19.790 --> 03:00:19.800 align:start position:0%
is a public database and turn out a copy
 
03:00:22.010 --> 03:00:22.020 align:start position:0%
of labels remove the label from the
 
03:00:22.020 --> 03:00:23.030 align:start position:0%
of labels remove the label from the
bottom

03:00:23.030 --> 03:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
bottom
 
03:00:25.690 --> 03:00:25.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:28.490 --> 03:00:28.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:00:32.950 --> 03:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
any other questions about the amendments
 
03:00:35.870 --> 03:00:35.880 align:start position:0%
representative I'm going to guess Woods
 
03:00:39.110 --> 03:00:39.120 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry just a comment uh also uh what
 
03:00:41.389 --> 03:00:41.399 align:start position:0%
we did in the office uh was if someone
 
03:00:44.750 --> 03:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
had a question uh oftentimes for uh side
 
03:00:46.670 --> 03:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
effects we just gave him the answer the
 
03:00:46.680 --> 03:00:47.830 align:start position:0%
effects we just gave him the answer the
package

03:00:47.830 --> 03:00:47.840 align:start position:0%
package
 
03:00:51.830 --> 03:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
and that's very simple uh and if uh you
 
03:00:55.010 --> 03:00:55.020 align:start position:0%
run you can photocopy that uh as well
 
03:00:59.690 --> 03:00:59.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:59.700 --> 03:01:04.070 align:start position:0%
 
because

03:01:04.070 --> 03:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:06.650 --> 03:01:06.660 align:start position:0%
here representative Shapiro I I wish
 
03:01:08.750 --> 03:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
first I I wish to apologize to the
 
03:01:11.090 --> 03:01:11.100 align:start position:0%
committee on fighting an optic migraine
 
03:01:13.190 --> 03:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
which is making the AC the screen less
 
03:01:15.769 --> 03:01:15.779 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be getting more confused than
 
03:01:19.130 --> 03:01:19.140 align:start position:0%
normal but representative Shapiro
 
03:01:20.929 --> 03:01:20.939 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
03:01:20.939 --> 03:01:21.650 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

03:01:21.650 --> 03:01:21.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:01:23.990 --> 03:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
I admit to also losing track of the
 
03:01:26.870 --> 03:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
Amendments and the original bill
 
03:01:30.530 --> 03:01:30.540 align:start position:0%
um so but my memory is that in the
 
03:01:34.070 --> 03:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
original bill this applied only to
 
03:01:37.790 --> 03:01:37.800 align:start position:0%
people who requested the information
 
03:01:39.590 --> 03:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
um spontaneously that it was not
 
03:01:40.969 --> 03:01:40.979 align:start position:0%
something that had to be offered to
 
03:01:43.550 --> 03:01:43.560 align:start position:0%
every patient yes that is that still in
 
03:01:45.309 --> 03:01:45.319 align:start position:0%
effect in the amendment
 
03:01:49.370 --> 03:01:49.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:49.380 --> 03:01:49.560 align:start position:0%

03:01:59.290 --> 03:01:59.300 align:start position:0%
seeing no further
 
03:02:02.690 --> 03:02:02.700 align:start position:0%
hands up to ask a question or make a
 
03:02:02.700 --> 03:02:05.870 align:start position:0%
hands up to ask a question or make a
statement

03:02:05.870 --> 03:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:08.929 --> 03:02:08.939 align:start position:0%
we are voting on the amendment may I
 
03:02:11.929 --> 03:02:11.939 align:start position:0%
just say one thing we're still trying to

find to find it
 
03:02:15.590 --> 03:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
um obviously if you have a search
 
03:02:17.210 --> 03:02:17.220 align:start position:0%
function you just search under Marsha's
 
03:02:20.450 --> 03:02:20.460 align:start position:0%
name because he sent it out but likewise
 
03:02:23.469 --> 03:02:23.479 align:start position:0%

amendment
 
03:02:39.710 --> 03:02:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:42.290 --> 03:02:42.300 align:start position:0%
would people like me to sort of what
 
03:02:44.150 --> 03:02:44.160 align:start position:0%

03:03:02.870 --> 03:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
just to kill time I'd like to ask a
 
03:03:04.570 --> 03:03:04.580 align:start position:0%
question Mr chairman yes we do
 
03:03:08.809 --> 03:03:08.819 align:start position:0%
representative how does that affect uh
 
03:03:12.530 --> 03:03:12.540 align:start position:0%
medications that are uh shots injections
 
03:03:15.050 --> 03:03:15.060 align:start position:0%
that are made out of the country they do
 
03:03:17.210 --> 03:03:17.220 align:start position:0%
this in uh China and they ship it over
 
03:03:19.610 --> 03:03:19.620 align:start position:0%
here because I have to provide the same
 
03:03:23.929 --> 03:03:23.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:23.939 --> 03:03:26.269 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:03:26.269 --> 03:03:26.279 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:03:28.309 --> 03:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
simple answer is yes representative
 
03:03:28.319 --> 03:03:29.389 align:start position:0%
simple answer is yes representative
Nelson

03:03:29.389 --> 03:03:29.399 align:start position:0%
Nelson
 
03:03:32.450 --> 03:03:32.460 align:start position:0%
um the manufacturing of the product is
 
03:03:34.490 --> 03:03:34.500 align:start position:0%
not what's driving what has to be
 
03:03:35.990 --> 03:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
provided it's what country is being
 
03:03:37.670 --> 03:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
shipped into so if it goes into the US
 
03:03:40.130 --> 03:03:40.140 align:start position:0%
has to comply with U.S laws if it goes
 
03:03:42.349 --> 03:03:42.359 align:start position:0%
into Canada complies with Canada law so
 
03:03:43.670 --> 03:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
in this case because the product came
 
03:03:46.250 --> 03:03:46.260 align:start position:0%
from India or China when it comes to the
 
03:03:55.030 --> 03:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:04.849 --> 03:04:04.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:06.410 --> 03:04:06.420 align:start position:0%
let's vote
 
03:04:08.950 --> 03:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
give folks a few minutes more to read
 
03:04:15.530 --> 03:04:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:19.429 --> 03:04:19.439 align:start position:0%
it's a short Amendment I'm good
 
03:04:20.870 --> 03:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to get caught up with

just wrote me a note about so we'll
 
03:10:17.389 --> 03:10:17.399 align:start position:0%
watch for it uh yes I tested out to the
 
03:10:19.550 --> 03:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
committee a new Amendment on House Bill
 
03:10:22.990 --> 03:10:23.000 align:start position:0%
503 uh this is the amendment that
 
03:10:25.550 --> 03:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro and I worked on
 
03:10:28.190 --> 03:10:28.200 align:start position:0%
last week to

commission that was discussed with us
 
03:10:40.070 --> 03:10:40.080 align:start position:0%

03:10:42.050 --> 03:10:42.060 align:start position:0%
executive order the new Amendment
 
03:10:44.269 --> 03:10:44.279 align:start position:0%
correct one word in the prior Amendment
 
03:10:47.150 --> 03:10:47.160 align:start position:0%
uh because we've learned that the
 
03:10:48.830 --> 03:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
community's Behavioral Health
 
03:10:50.750 --> 03:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
Organization was that and not the
 
03:10:52.610 --> 03:10:52.620 align:start position:0%
community mental muscle Association so
 
03:10:56.230 --> 03:10:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:59.190 --> 03:10:59.200 align:start position:0%
and what is its number

and what is its number
[Music]

03:11:05.530 --> 03:11:05.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:08.389 --> 03:11:08.399 align:start position:0%

just asking you to let us know what we
 
03:11:18.969 --> 03:11:18.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:21.410 --> 03:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
it's your turn
 
03:11:25.490 --> 03:11:25.500 align:start position:0%

03:11:37.490 --> 03:11:37.500 align:start position:0%
and uh representative Marsh you are
 
03:11:40.940 --> 03:11:40.950 align:start position:0%

03:11:43.210 --> 03:11:43.220 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:11:46.790 --> 03:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
and do we have a second
 
03:11:46.800 --> 03:11:48.050 align:start position:0%
and do we have a second
second

03:11:48.050 --> 03:11:48.060 align:start position:0%
second
 
03:11:51.950 --> 03:11:51.960 align:start position:0%
second from Merchants thank you and
 
03:11:54.830 --> 03:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
representative Marsh please speak to 381
 
03:12:00.650 --> 03:12:00.660 align:start position:0%
FM yes this is a bill to allow
 
03:12:03.889 --> 03:12:03.899 align:start position:0%
people to access Laboratories in the
 
03:12:06.170 --> 03:12:06.180 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire for testing for
 
03:12:07.630 --> 03:12:07.640 align:start position:0%
those positions
 
03:12:09.950 --> 03:12:09.960 align:start position:0%
this is similar to a bill we've had
 
03:12:12.530 --> 03:12:12.540 align:start position:0%
prior year one of the interesting things
 
03:12:15.950 --> 03:12:15.960 align:start position:0%
that has happened since last year is at
 
03:12:17.330 --> 03:12:17.340 align:start position:0%
least to my knowledge since last year
 
03:12:17.340 --> 03:12:19.630 align:start position:0%
least to my knowledge since last year
everybody

03:12:19.630 --> 03:12:19.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:22.250 --> 03:12:22.260 align:start position:0%
is there are numerous sites across the
 
03:12:24.230 --> 03:12:24.240 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire right now where
 
03:12:26.389 --> 03:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
people can go and get tested done
 
03:12:28.610 --> 03:12:28.620 align:start position:0%
without studying positions order but
 
03:12:30.830 --> 03:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
then those lab tests are then sent out
 
03:12:34.130 --> 03:12:34.140 align:start position:0%
of state because our labs are not able
 
03:12:36.670 --> 03:12:36.680 align:start position:0%
to perform this testing at this point
 
03:12:39.530 --> 03:12:39.540 align:start position:0%
this bill would allow our New Hampshire
 
03:12:41.389 --> 03:12:41.399 align:start position:0%
Laboratories to complete on a equal
 
03:12:43.910 --> 03:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
basis for the out-of-state labs and
 
03:12:47.050 --> 03:12:47.060 align:start position:0%
perform testing if they so desire
 
03:12:49.790 --> 03:12:49.800 align:start position:0%
and I believe that that is helpful I
 
03:12:53.150 --> 03:12:53.160 align:start position:0%
think it's very helpful if patients have
 
03:12:55.130 --> 03:12:55.140 align:start position:0%
a concern they want their lab tests done
 
03:12:58.330 --> 03:12:58.340 align:start position:0%
and the doctor doesn't particularly
 
03:13:01.250 --> 03:13:01.260 align:start position:0%
enthusiastic about the idea it's much
 
03:13:02.750 --> 03:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
better for them to be able to still get
 
03:13:04.550 --> 03:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
their lab test done and turn on expense
 
03:13:06.950 --> 03:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
and get them to a fight for their doctor
 
03:13:09.830 --> 03:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
the major argument against this bill was
 
03:13:13.309 --> 03:13:13.319 align:start position:0%
a argument that the public would be put
 
03:13:15.769 --> 03:13:15.779 align:start position:0%
at risk uh due to the fact that people
 
03:13:17.809 --> 03:13:17.819 align:start position:0%
might not be able to serve regular
 
03:13:20.630 --> 03:13:20.640 align:start position:0%
laboratory tests correct I would contend
 
03:13:22.670 --> 03:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
that this has been going on for some
 
03:13:24.769 --> 03:13:24.779 align:start position:0%
time that these sites are currently
 
03:13:27.290 --> 03:13:27.300 align:start position:0%
available and that has not happened and
 
03:13:30.670 --> 03:13:30.680 align:start position:0%
that is why I support this legislative
 
03:13:34.849 --> 03:13:34.859 align:start position:0%
any questions or yeah I have a problem I
 
03:13:37.070 --> 03:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
I cannot find that amendment I thought I
 
03:13:39.490 --> 03:13:39.500 align:start position:0%
had it now it's my turn not to have it
 
03:13:39.500 --> 03:13:42.250 align:start position:0%
had it now it's my turn not to have it
uh

03:13:42.250 --> 03:13:42.260 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:13:44.950 --> 03:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
is the one we're discussing right now no
 
03:13:49.610 --> 03:13:49.620 align:start position:0%
we're discussing Hospital 381.
 
03:13:51.170 --> 03:13:51.180 align:start position:0%
I thought he had an amendment on it no
 
03:13:53.210 --> 03:13:53.220 align:start position:0%
no Amendment amendment was on something
 
03:13:56.630 --> 03:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
else my apologies hey
 
03:13:56.640 --> 03:14:05.330 align:start position:0%
else my apologies hey
okay

03:14:05.330 --> 03:14:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:05.340 --> 03:14:06.110 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:14:06.110 --> 03:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:10.070 --> 03:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
I just understand that we do have Labs
 
03:14:11.450 --> 03:14:11.460 align:start position:0%
that will send it out of state and you
 
03:14:13.610 --> 03:14:13.620 align:start position:0%
can do that
 
03:14:15.290 --> 03:14:15.300 align:start position:0%
the problem I have I still have great
 
03:14:18.050 --> 03:14:18.060 align:start position:0%
reservations about allowing this
 
03:14:19.969 --> 03:14:19.979 align:start position:0%
and I view this as a little bit like
 
03:14:22.010 --> 03:14:22.020 align:start position:0%
your kid coming in and saying but all
 
03:14:24.110 --> 03:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
the other kids are doing it just because
 
03:14:25.849 --> 03:14:25.859 align:start position:0%
all the other kids are doing it doesn't
 
03:14:27.769 --> 03:14:27.779 align:start position:0%
mean you're going to condone them
 
03:14:29.870 --> 03:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
starting to smoke
 
03:14:31.849 --> 03:14:31.859 align:start position:0%
it's and I think the fact that other
 
03:14:33.710 --> 03:14:33.720 align:start position:0%
states may be doing this
 
03:14:36.170 --> 03:14:36.180 align:start position:0%
and we might lose business to those
 
03:14:38.510 --> 03:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
other states does not make it a good
 
03:14:40.849 --> 03:14:40.859 align:start position:0%
idea to condone that behavior because by
 
03:14:42.170 --> 03:14:42.180 align:start position:0%
so doing
 
03:14:44.630 --> 03:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
we will probably increase the amount of
 
03:14:47.030 --> 03:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
these tests that would be done
 
03:14:48.710 --> 03:14:48.720 align:start position:0%
um and I do not think that that's really
 
03:14:50.990 --> 03:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
necessary and I think not necessary
 
03:14:51.000 --> 03:14:52.070 align:start position:0%
necessary and I think not necessary
because

03:14:52.070 --> 03:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:14:55.730 --> 03:14:55.740 align:start position:0%
it there are very clear issues about the
 
03:14:57.650 --> 03:14:57.660 align:start position:0%
diagnostic Cascade and somebody made a
 
03:14:59.450 --> 03:14:59.460 align:start position:0%
comment well the patient would pay for
 
03:15:01.370 --> 03:15:01.380 align:start position:0%
it but no not necessarily when they come
 
03:15:03.349 --> 03:15:03.359 align:start position:0%
into their provider the diagnostic
 
03:15:04.969 --> 03:15:04.979 align:start position:0%
Cascade would start getting billed to
 
03:15:08.269 --> 03:15:08.279 align:start position:0%
the insurers the other thing is actually
 
03:15:12.410 --> 03:15:12.420 align:start position:0%
it's simply the patient perception of
 
03:15:14.870 --> 03:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
health and I have had patience with this
 
03:15:18.170 --> 03:15:18.180 align:start position:0%
we I know this is not covering Imaging
 
03:15:20.630 --> 03:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
but there was a very good Imaging study
 
03:15:23.889 --> 03:15:23.899 align:start position:0%
done uh studied on in imaging using MRIs
 
03:15:27.110 --> 03:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
on people who where the MRI was really
 
03:15:28.670 --> 03:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
not even relevant to their issue which
 
03:15:30.290 --> 03:15:30.300 align:start position:0%
showed degenerative change like having
 
03:15:32.450 --> 03:15:32.460 align:start position:0%
gray hair and wrinkles but when they
 
03:15:35.570 --> 03:15:35.580 align:start position:0%
read that if they were the study was you
 
03:15:37.130 --> 03:15:37.140 align:start position:0%
either got the report or you didn't get
 
03:15:39.349 --> 03:15:39.359 align:start position:0%
the report and the point is those who
 
03:15:41.690 --> 03:15:41.700 align:start position:0%
read these nasty words like degenerative
 
03:15:43.010 --> 03:15:43.020 align:start position:0%
and all those things which simply
 
03:15:45.830 --> 03:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
implied normal age-related changes and
 
03:15:47.389 --> 03:15:47.399 align:start position:0%
tested them later on their perceptions
 
03:15:49.969 --> 03:15:49.979 align:start position:0%
of Wellness they viewed themselves as
 
03:15:51.650 --> 03:15:51.660 align:start position:0%
not being well and I've had patients who
 
03:15:54.410 --> 03:15:54.420 align:start position:0%
came in and because of a test which was
 
03:15:54.420 --> 03:15:56.030 align:start position:0%
came in and because of a test which was
misinterpreted

03:15:56.030 --> 03:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
misinterpreted
 
03:15:59.030 --> 03:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
itself they had that disease and changed
 
03:16:00.710 --> 03:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
their behavior one was rheumatoid
 
03:16:02.870 --> 03:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
arthritis other ones are Lyme disease
 
03:16:07.190 --> 03:16:07.200 align:start position:0%
and so it is not a trivial issue in
 
03:16:10.610 --> 03:16:10.620 align:start position:0%
terms of people uh trying to use Dr
 
03:16:13.250 --> 03:16:13.260 align:start position:0%
Google for understanding the importance
 
03:16:16.250 --> 03:16:16.260 align:start position:0%
of the meeting of a
 
03:16:16.260 --> 03:16:16.969 align:start position:0%
of the meeting of a
um

03:16:16.969 --> 03:16:16.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:18.370 --> 03:16:18.380 align:start position:0%
of a test
 
03:16:22.190 --> 03:16:22.200 align:start position:0%
particularly the screening tests and in
 
03:16:23.630 --> 03:16:23.640 align:start position:0%
medical school we were taught you do a
 
03:16:25.429 --> 03:16:25.439 align:start position:0%
history that gives you a great deal of
 
03:16:26.330 --> 03:16:26.340 align:start position:0%
information that'll give you the
 
03:16:28.389 --> 03:16:28.399 align:start position:0%
diagnosis then a physical exam
 
03:16:30.650 --> 03:16:30.660 align:start position:0%
laboratory tests are almost always done
 
03:16:35.230 --> 03:16:35.240 align:start position:0%
purely as a confirmatory or monitoring
 
03:16:39.130 --> 03:16:39.140 align:start position:0%
or in some senses screening but we see
 
03:16:41.510 --> 03:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
incredible amount of disagreement on the
 
03:16:43.910 --> 03:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
United States preventative task force
 
03:16:45.830 --> 03:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
when we come to screening issues and it
 
03:16:47.450 --> 03:16:47.460 align:start position:0%
takes a lot of time to figure out what's
 
03:16:49.309 --> 03:16:49.319 align:start position:0%
appropriate what isn't appropriate as a
 
03:16:52.070 --> 03:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
screening test so I still see that there
 
03:16:54.889 --> 03:16:54.899 align:start position:0%
is more chance for harm we have a
 
03:16:56.510 --> 03:16:56.520 align:start position:0%
dysfunctional Health Care system I would
 
03:16:58.610 --> 03:16:58.620 align:start position:0%
agree uh for example representative
 
03:17:00.050 --> 03:17:00.060 align:start position:0%
Edwards should not have had that nine
 
03:17:01.250 --> 03:17:01.260 align:start position:0%
months he didn't have health insurance
 
03:17:03.769 --> 03:17:03.779 align:start position:0%
but this is a Band-Aid on a bad health
 
03:17:06.050 --> 03:17:06.060 align:start position:0%
system that I think makes it even worse
 
03:17:08.410 --> 03:17:08.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:17:11.450 --> 03:17:11.460 align:start position:0%
representative NADA Upham oh thank you
 
03:17:14.450 --> 03:17:14.460 align:start position:0%
thank you for listening to my comments
 
03:17:18.349 --> 03:17:18.359 align:start position:0%
so um a lot of tests have become
 
03:17:20.750 --> 03:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
available when I was a young woman you
 
03:17:22.610 --> 03:17:22.620 align:start position:0%
had to go through your doctor to get a
 
03:17:24.889 --> 03:17:24.899 align:start position:0%
pregnancy test you don't have to do that
 
03:17:27.710 --> 03:17:27.720 align:start position:0%
now you can go to the pharmacy there
 
03:17:30.349 --> 03:17:30.359 align:start position:0%
were several times I a mother of many
 
03:17:33.230 --> 03:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
kids you know you worried they had strep
 
03:17:35.690 --> 03:17:35.700 align:start position:0%
you had to go through the doctor's
 
03:17:38.150 --> 03:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
office you had to bundle all four of
 
03:17:39.830 --> 03:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
them up in the car to take the one
 
03:17:42.769 --> 03:17:42.779 align:start position:0%
whatever so I I think there's a lot of
 
03:17:45.830 --> 03:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
upside in people aiming being able to
 
03:17:50.330 --> 03:17:50.340 align:start position:0%
order A1C tests strep tests
 
03:17:52.370 --> 03:17:52.380 align:start position:0%
um I'm sure many of you could think of a
 
03:17:53.750 --> 03:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
bunch of other tests it's like either
 
03:17:55.849 --> 03:17:55.859 align:start position:0%
you've got it you're not so if I took my
 
03:17:57.889 --> 03:17:57.899 align:start position:0%
child and they had strep then I take
 
03:18:00.110 --> 03:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
them to the doctor to get medication
 
03:18:01.610 --> 03:18:01.620 align:start position:0%
I had
 
03:18:03.950 --> 03:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
uh a lot of time this weekend I called
 
03:18:06.530 --> 03:18:06.540 align:start position:0%
my medical Posse my many friends that
 
03:18:08.269 --> 03:18:08.279 align:start position:0%
are nurse practitioners and a few that
 
03:18:10.130 --> 03:18:10.140 align:start position:0%
were doctors
 
03:18:12.830 --> 03:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
um and they said yeah why not buyer
 
03:18:15.170 --> 03:18:15.180 align:start position:0%
beware so I'm going to vote in favor of
 
03:18:19.250 --> 03:18:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:21.070 --> 03:18:21.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:18:24.250 --> 03:18:24.260 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant
 
03:18:26.510 --> 03:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
03:18:28.910 --> 03:18:28.920 align:start position:0%
uh speak to the second of the motion on
 
03:18:30.590 --> 03:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
the uh at the pass
 
03:18:32.450 --> 03:18:32.460 align:start position:0%
initially when I saw this bill I was
 
03:18:33.889 --> 03:18:33.899 align:start position:0%
opposed to it
 
03:18:36.410 --> 03:18:36.420 align:start position:0%
um but upon research what I found out is
 
03:18:40.130 --> 03:18:40.140 align:start position:0%
that as representative Marsh said before
 
03:18:42.349 --> 03:18:42.359 align:start position:0%
patients today can go into many
 
03:18:44.150 --> 03:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
locations throughout New Hampshire
 
03:18:46.969 --> 03:18:46.979 align:start position:0%
and have the blood drawn and at that
 
03:18:49.370 --> 03:18:49.380 align:start position:0%
point in time the blood leaves the state
 
03:18:50.870 --> 03:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
and goes to another state that allows
 
03:18:52.550 --> 03:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
for it to be processed
 
03:18:55.250 --> 03:18:55.260 align:start position:0%
so this build is not really enfranchise
 
03:18:57.710 --> 03:18:57.720 align:start position:0%
the patient to get the blood work done
 
03:18:59.510 --> 03:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
it's just a question of where it gets
 
03:18:59.520 --> 03:19:00.650 align:start position:0%
it's just a question of where it gets
done

03:19:00.650 --> 03:19:00.660 align:start position:0%
done
 
03:19:02.150 --> 03:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
well basically at this point in time
 
03:19:04.670 --> 03:19:04.680 align:start position:0%
what changed my mind with the bill was
 
03:19:06.889 --> 03:19:06.899 align:start position:0%
saying wait a minute we have the ability
 
03:19:09.110 --> 03:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
for a patient today to go into a drawing
 
03:19:12.469 --> 03:19:12.479 align:start position:0%
Center have the blood withdrawn and then
 
03:19:14.630 --> 03:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
it has to leave the state and go to
 
03:19:17.510 --> 03:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
another facility outside the state so
 
03:19:19.190 --> 03:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
all we're doing fundamentally is taking
 
03:19:20.750 --> 03:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
the work that can be done here in New
 
03:19:22.250 --> 03:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and sending it to another
 
03:19:24.530 --> 03:19:24.540 align:start position:0%
state to get the work done so the
 
03:19:26.389 --> 03:19:26.399 align:start position:0%
ability for the patient to get the lab
 
03:19:28.309 --> 03:19:28.319 align:start position:0%
work and get the results and so forth
 
03:19:29.690 --> 03:19:29.700 align:start position:0%
this build is not
 
03:19:32.750 --> 03:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
Foster or does it basically um
 
03:19:35.389 --> 03:19:35.399 align:start position:0%
permit it's already there all this does
 
03:19:37.190 --> 03:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
is allow for the laboratory to be
 
03:19:38.929 --> 03:19:38.939 align:start position:0%
located in New Hampshire to process the
 
03:19:38.939 --> 03:19:41.990 align:start position:0%
located in New Hampshire to process the
work

03:19:41.990 --> 03:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:44.330 --> 03:19:44.340 align:start position:0%
thank you representative soloway
 
03:19:46.610 --> 03:19:46.620 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman
 
03:19:48.590 --> 03:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
um of the 400 members of the New
 
03:19:49.849 --> 03:19:49.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State House of Representatives
 
03:19:52.490 --> 03:19:52.500 align:start position:0%
I would have to guess that 380 of them
 
03:19:54.830 --> 03:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
have no medical expertise to speak of
 
03:19:54.840 --> 03:19:56.389 align:start position:0%
have no medical expertise to speak of
whatsoever

03:19:56.389 --> 03:19:56.399 align:start position:0%
whatsoever
 
03:19:58.610 --> 03:19:58.620 align:start position:0%
um it is therefore my suggestion that we
 
03:20:01.309 --> 03:20:01.319 align:start position:0%
keep our noses out of the practitioner
 
03:20:03.410 --> 03:20:03.420 align:start position:0%
patient relationship where it simply
 
03:20:06.290 --> 03:20:06.300 align:start position:0%
doesn't belong we have a system that
 
03:20:08.030 --> 03:20:08.040 align:start position:0%
works there were no catastrophes out
 
03:20:10.429 --> 03:20:10.439 align:start position:0%
there it seems to go along well
 
03:20:12.830 --> 03:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
um and I would suggest that we mind our
 
03:20:14.570 --> 03:20:14.580 align:start position:0%
own business and stay away from Bad
 
03:20:14.580 --> 03:20:17.330 align:start position:0%
own business and stay away from Bad
government

03:20:17.330 --> 03:20:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:22.090 --> 03:20:22.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:25.250 --> 03:20:25.260 align:start position:0%
I've taken my hand down representative
 
03:20:28.429 --> 03:20:28.439 align:start position:0%
Cushman thank you Mr chairman
 
03:20:30.170 --> 03:20:30.180 align:start position:0%
um I just want to say that what I'm
 
03:20:32.570 --> 03:20:32.580 align:start position:0%
hearing is patients don't know enough
 
03:20:35.150 --> 03:20:35.160 align:start position:0%
they can't order their own labs they
 
03:20:37.309 --> 03:20:37.319 align:start position:0%
don't have the expertise I I think we're
 
03:20:40.190 --> 03:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
selling patients short very much
 
03:20:42.650 --> 03:20:42.660 align:start position:0%
um I think patients especially those
 
03:20:44.690 --> 03:20:44.700 align:start position:0%
with chronic illness do become experts
 
03:20:47.750 --> 03:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
on their own conditions oftentimes
 
03:20:49.969 --> 03:20:49.979 align:start position:0%
um I have encountered patients who went
 
03:20:53.210 --> 03:20:53.220 align:start position:0%
misdiagnosed for years and I'm glad that
 
03:20:55.010 --> 03:20:55.020 align:start position:0%
representative canark brought up Lyme
 
03:20:56.269 --> 03:20:56.279 align:start position:0%
disease because that's one of the
 
03:20:58.670 --> 03:20:58.680 align:start position:0%
diseases that often goes undiagnosed or
 
03:21:02.150 --> 03:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
misdiagnosed because many Physicians are
 
03:21:05.929 --> 03:21:05.939 align:start position:0%
unwilling to order the lab testing
 
03:21:08.389 --> 03:21:08.399 align:start position:0%
um after a short course of antibiotics
 
03:21:10.070 --> 03:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
which doesn't always take care of the
 
03:21:12.590 --> 03:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
problem life can go and be chronic for
 
03:21:16.610 --> 03:21:16.620 align:start position:0%
years so there are other Physicians who
 
03:21:19.309 --> 03:21:19.319 align:start position:0%
will order these lab tests
 
03:21:22.969 --> 03:21:22.979 align:start position:0%
um but it may be cost prohibitive or you
 
03:21:24.830 --> 03:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
know maybe someone can't find a
 
03:21:27.110 --> 03:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
physician who will do it but I I've
 
03:21:29.330 --> 03:21:29.340 align:start position:0%
known patients who have had Lyme disease
 
03:21:31.190 --> 03:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
for years and
 
03:21:33.349 --> 03:21:33.359 align:start position:0%
um for chronic illness patients this
 
03:21:35.330 --> 03:21:35.340 align:start position:0%
will be very convenient you know
 
03:21:37.130 --> 03:21:37.140 align:start position:0%
especially those who have to have repeat
 
03:21:39.889 --> 03:21:39.899 align:start position:0%
Labs drawn who maybe can't afford to go
 
03:21:41.870 --> 03:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
in for a visit every time excuse me
 
03:21:44.990 --> 03:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
every time or go to a lab
 
03:21:45.000 --> 03:21:45.889 align:start position:0%
every time or go to a lab
um

03:21:45.889 --> 03:21:45.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:48.469 --> 03:21:48.479 align:start position:0%
you know and have sorry every time they
 
03:21:50.450 --> 03:21:50.460 align:start position:0%
have to go to the lab
 
03:21:52.309 --> 03:21:52.319 align:start position:0%
um and they also become very
 
03:21:54.830 --> 03:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable on their normal range
 
03:21:57.889 --> 03:21:57.899 align:start position:0%
um for their lab values uh sometimes
 
03:22:00.469 --> 03:22:00.479 align:start position:0%
Physicians will look at patient's lab
 
03:22:03.349 --> 03:22:03.359 align:start position:0%
values and not understand that there's
 
03:22:05.690 --> 03:22:05.700 align:start position:0%
something else going on I've had
 
03:22:07.730 --> 03:22:07.740 align:start position:0%
patients who you know they know where
 
03:22:09.769 --> 03:22:09.779 align:start position:0%
their normal lab range is and it may be
 
03:22:11.630 --> 03:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
a little bit below normal and they're
 
03:22:14.510 --> 03:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
getting over treated because their their
 
03:22:16.190 --> 03:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
physician doesn't
 
03:22:18.530 --> 03:22:18.540 align:start position:0%
um doesn't really acknowledge that
 
03:22:20.809 --> 03:22:20.819 align:start position:0%
that's normal for them
 
03:22:23.150 --> 03:22:23.160 align:start position:0%
um so I just think that we need to give
 
03:22:26.090 --> 03:22:26.100 align:start position:0%
patients the reins over their health as
 
03:22:28.130 --> 03:22:28.140 align:start position:0%
much as possible and nursing uh you know
 
03:22:31.010 --> 03:22:31.020 align:start position:0%
it's it's a value that we have that when
 
03:22:32.750 --> 03:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
patients are more responsible for their
 
03:22:35.269 --> 03:22:35.279 align:start position:0%
health their outcomes are better so I
 
03:22:36.410 --> 03:22:36.420 align:start position:0%
think we should give them as much
 
03:22:39.710 --> 03:22:39.720 align:start position:0%
economy over their health as we can
 
03:22:44.830 --> 03:22:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:47.389 --> 03:22:47.399 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair
 
03:22:50.030 --> 03:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
um a couple of points um I understand
 
03:22:53.510 --> 03:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
that the the specific tests uh ha1c and
 
03:22:56.450 --> 03:22:56.460 align:start position:0%
so forth uh the paintings really do get
 
03:23:00.170 --> 03:23:00.180 align:start position:0%
well attuned to monitoring it themselves
 
03:23:02.330 --> 03:23:02.340 align:start position:0%
um England was also an example of people
 
03:23:05.990 --> 03:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
on coumadin uh they established a home
 
03:23:09.290 --> 03:23:09.300 align:start position:0%
program and people had their blood uh
 
03:23:11.090 --> 03:23:11.100 align:start position:0%
were able to monitor themselves people
 
03:23:13.309 --> 03:23:13.319 align:start position:0%
on chronic coumadin and actually had
 
03:23:15.410 --> 03:23:15.420 align:start position:0%
better compliance and better end result
 
03:23:18.110 --> 03:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
and when patients did it themselves
 
03:23:20.630 --> 03:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
however this instance uh Bill does not
 
03:23:24.349 --> 03:23:24.359 align:start position:0%
identify any specific area this is
 
03:23:26.290 --> 03:23:26.300 align:start position:0%
basically carte blanche
 
03:23:29.750 --> 03:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
everything everything goes
 
03:23:33.170 --> 03:23:33.180 align:start position:0%
um and that's the problem I have with it
 
03:23:33.180 --> 03:23:34.910 align:start position:0%
um and that's the problem I have with it
um secondly

03:23:34.910 --> 03:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
um secondly
 
03:23:37.429 --> 03:23:37.439 align:start position:0%
um there's the legal aspect
 
03:23:41.269 --> 03:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
um they say well it says in here
 
03:23:45.110 --> 03:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
um that the uh individual physician or
 
03:23:46.910 --> 03:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
provider would not be held responsible
 
03:23:48.550 --> 03:23:48.560 align:start position:0%
if they didn't order it
 
03:23:52.130 --> 03:23:52.140 align:start position:0%
but if the patient calls the office and
 
03:23:55.610 --> 03:23:55.620 align:start position:0%
says I had a test drawn you are now
 
03:23:58.370 --> 03:23:58.380 align:start position:0%
obligated to respond
 
03:24:00.530 --> 03:24:00.540 align:start position:0%
um if you're in a Health Care System
 
03:24:02.570 --> 03:24:02.580 align:start position:0%
where that lab
 
03:24:06.530 --> 03:24:06.540 align:start position:0%
is within an overall Healthcare network
 
03:24:12.729 --> 03:24:12.739 align:start position:0%
with a common uh uh Health Care chart uh
 
03:24:16.429 --> 03:24:16.439 align:start position:0%
automatically if there's an aberrant lab
 
03:24:19.550 --> 03:24:19.560 align:start position:0%
it shows up and is addressed within
 
03:24:22.370 --> 03:24:22.380 align:start position:0%
whatever office uh that patient normally
 
03:24:22.380 --> 03:24:24.229 align:start position:0%
whatever office uh that patient normally
attends

03:24:24.229 --> 03:24:24.239 align:start position:0%
attends
 
03:24:27.950 --> 03:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
um and as therefore there is a legal
 
03:24:29.690 --> 03:24:29.700 align:start position:0%
obligation to respond
 
03:24:31.450 --> 03:24:31.460 align:start position:0%
and in fact
 
03:24:34.570 --> 03:24:34.580 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is one of the few
 
03:24:34.580 --> 03:24:36.130 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is one of the few
states

03:24:36.130 --> 03:24:36.140 align:start position:0%
states
 
03:24:39.410 --> 03:24:39.420 align:start position:0%
that mandate nrsa
 
03:24:42.070 --> 03:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
the standard to which Physicians and
 
03:24:44.650 --> 03:24:44.660 align:start position:0%
Physicians I don't know about nurses
 
03:24:47.690 --> 03:24:47.700 align:start position:0%
Physicians are held is the AMA guide to
 
03:24:49.130 --> 03:24:49.140 align:start position:0%
ethical Behavior
 
03:24:51.889 --> 03:24:51.899 align:start position:0%
and in that so that's the standard we're
 
03:24:55.010 --> 03:24:55.020 align:start position:0%
met that we have to meet and be board to
 
03:24:56.990 --> 03:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh to have our license
 
03:25:00.469 --> 03:25:00.479 align:start position:0%
uh and in that in there it specifically
 
03:25:03.830 --> 03:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
states that if you're aware of an
 
03:25:06.590 --> 03:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
aberrant situation it's your
 
03:25:06.600 --> 03:25:08.330 align:start position:0%
aberrant situation it's your
obligation

03:25:08.330 --> 03:25:08.340 align:start position:0%
obligation
 
03:25:12.469 --> 03:25:12.479 align:start position:0%
to respond that means you may call your
 
03:25:14.570 --> 03:25:14.580 align:start position:0%
partner and say can you handle this for
 
03:25:17.090 --> 03:25:17.100 align:start position:0%
me or call a consultant or whatever but
 
03:25:19.550 --> 03:25:19.560 align:start position:0%
you can't ignore it so that's the
 
03:25:20.990 --> 03:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
standard that we're held for our
 
03:25:24.849 --> 03:25:24.859 align:start position:0%
licenses so for those reasons I I I I
 
03:25:27.530 --> 03:25:27.540 align:start position:0%
kind of like the idea
 
03:25:29.929 --> 03:25:29.939 align:start position:0%
I'll be people be taking responsibility
 
03:25:33.290 --> 03:25:33.300 align:start position:0%
I love having patients that can do that
 
03:25:35.690 --> 03:25:35.700 align:start position:0%
but I think this is this is goes a
 
03:25:38.630 --> 03:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
little bit too far and just has some of
 
03:25:40.610 --> 03:25:40.620 align:start position:0%
the other intent unintended consequences
 
03:25:44.030 --> 03:25:44.040 align:start position:0%
that uh Dr konark has outlined as well
 
03:25:45.830 --> 03:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
as the uh other ones that I've just
 
03:25:47.570 --> 03:25:47.580 align:start position:0%
mentioned thank you
 
03:25:52.729 --> 03:25:52.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:55.429 --> 03:25:55.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I I agree with
 
03:25:57.170 --> 03:25:57.180 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman that I think
 
03:25:59.090 --> 03:25:59.100 align:start position:0%
we're we're selling patients a little
 
03:26:01.550 --> 03:26:01.560 align:start position:0%
short by assuming that they can't be
 
03:26:03.349 --> 03:26:03.359 align:start position:0%
responsible with information from test
 
03:26:05.750 --> 03:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
results having said that I think all of
 
03:26:08.750 --> 03:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
the discussion as to the wisdom of
 
03:26:12.110 --> 03:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
allowing patients to test to order their
 
03:26:15.410 --> 03:26:15.420 align:start position:0%
own tests or not is actually moot
 
03:26:18.650 --> 03:26:18.660 align:start position:0%
because they can as as representative
 
03:26:21.170 --> 03:26:21.180 align:start position:0%
Marsh said when he introduced this they
 
03:26:23.330 --> 03:26:23.340 align:start position:0%
already can so
 
03:26:26.690 --> 03:26:26.700 align:start position:0%
um the the only practical implication of
 
03:26:29.750 --> 03:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
this as I see it is whether or not we
 
03:26:31.849 --> 03:26:31.859 align:start position:0%
want more jobs in the state of New
 
03:26:33.830 --> 03:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or more jobs outside the state
 
03:26:34.969 --> 03:26:34.979 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire do we want to
 
03:26:36.650 --> 03:26:36.660 align:start position:0%
strengthen businesses in New Hampshire
 
03:26:38.450 --> 03:26:38.460 align:start position:0%
or not
 
03:26:40.790 --> 03:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
um you know and I'm I'm open to hearing
 
03:26:42.830 --> 03:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
uh why that might be wrong but that's
 
03:26:46.130 --> 03:26:46.140 align:start position:0%
that's how it occurs to me at the moment
 
03:26:48.889 --> 03:26:48.899 align:start position:0%
thank you the check calls on himself for
 
03:26:51.530 --> 03:26:51.540 align:start position:0%
a couple of comments I talked to the
 
03:26:54.889 --> 03:26:54.899 align:start position:0%
three pcps that are under my employee on
 
03:26:58.070 --> 03:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
this and one of the things they said is
 
03:27:02.450 --> 03:27:02.460 align:start position:0%
yes patients come in and present test
 
03:27:02.460 --> 03:27:03.710 align:start position:0%
yes patients come in and present test
data

03:27:03.710 --> 03:27:03.720 align:start position:0%
data
 
03:27:06.590 --> 03:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
from wherever and of course we respond
 
03:27:09.469 --> 03:27:09.479 align:start position:0%
to that and if we heard a patient call
 
03:27:11.750 --> 03:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
in and say oh I ordered a test and here
 
03:27:14.030 --> 03:27:14.040 align:start position:0%
it is would say make an appointment and
 
03:27:15.710 --> 03:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
bring it in of course we're responsible
 
03:27:16.969 --> 03:27:16.979 align:start position:0%
for that
 
03:27:19.309 --> 03:27:19.319 align:start position:0%
then the second thing is
 
03:27:23.389 --> 03:27:23.399 align:start position:0%
um numbers of our patients come in uh
 
03:27:28.130 --> 03:27:28.140 align:start position:0%
very well uh read many of them very well
 
03:27:28.140 --> 03:27:29.990 align:start position:0%
very well uh read many of them very well
educated

03:27:29.990 --> 03:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
educated
 
03:27:32.809 --> 03:27:32.819 align:start position:0%
um some of them get their education from
 
03:27:36.590 --> 03:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
Dr Google or it's um uh younger brother
 
03:27:39.769 --> 03:27:39.779 align:start position:0%
People magazine and so sure we've got a
 
03:27:41.389 --> 03:27:41.399 align:start position:0%
number of people who come in who have
 
03:27:41.399 --> 03:27:42.790 align:start position:0%
number of people who come in who have
researched

03:27:42.790 --> 03:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
researched
 
03:27:46.130 --> 03:27:46.140 align:start position:0%
what they believe or if they actually do
 
03:27:49.130 --> 03:27:49.140 align:start position:0%
have is a symptom many of them are very
 
03:27:52.429 --> 03:27:52.439 align:start position:0%
well educated and that can be helpful it
 
03:27:53.929 --> 03:27:53.939 align:start position:0%
certainly means the patient is taking
 
03:27:56.630 --> 03:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
responsibility for his or all her own
 
03:28:00.010 --> 03:28:00.020 align:start position:0%
Medical Care and the ones that come in
 
03:28:03.769 --> 03:28:03.779 align:start position:0%
uh who are have a lot of information
 
03:28:06.530 --> 03:28:06.540 align:start position:0%
much of which is bogus these are pretty
 
03:28:08.389 --> 03:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
much our patients who if they didn't
 
03:28:10.429 --> 03:28:10.439 align:start position:0%
research it they wouldn't believe what
 
03:28:11.990 --> 03:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
the doctor told them anyway
 
03:28:15.110 --> 03:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
so the conclusion that my three pcps
 
03:28:20.389 --> 03:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:22.849 --> 03:28:22.859 align:start position:0%
so I'm certainly going to be supporting
 
03:28:26.030 --> 03:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
the bill and the other comments or
 
03:28:28.969 --> 03:28:28.979 align:start position:0%
representative gay thank you for taking
 
03:28:31.969 --> 03:28:31.979 align:start position:0%
my comments I'm one of those I'm one of
 
03:28:34.309 --> 03:28:34.319 align:start position:0%
those patients like you describe it'll I
 
03:28:37.190 --> 03:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
read up everything I can and ultimately
 
03:28:40.670 --> 03:28:40.680 align:start position:0%
we patients have to decide who to go to
 
03:28:43.729 --> 03:28:43.739 align:start position:0%
I had to go to three spinal surgeons
 
03:28:46.250 --> 03:28:46.260 align:start position:0%
before I got one who actually believed
 
03:28:50.030 --> 03:28:50.040 align:start position:0%
the MRI report that was written by by a
 
03:28:52.990 --> 03:28:53.000 align:start position:0%
doctor at the uh
 
03:28:56.389 --> 03:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
Baptist Hospital you know very famous I
 
03:28:58.070 --> 03:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
had two doctors who didn't believe it
 
03:29:00.710 --> 03:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
and so I didn't feel comfortable I kept
 
03:29:04.190 --> 03:29:04.200 align:start position:0%
going I don't think I'm unique in that I
 
03:29:07.010 --> 03:29:07.020 align:start position:0%
feel I evaluate what that doctor tells
 
03:29:09.769 --> 03:29:09.779 align:start position:0%
me and there's no way that a person can
 
03:29:12.849 --> 03:29:12.859 align:start position:0%
go get a blood test or any kind of test
 
03:29:15.410 --> 03:29:15.420 align:start position:0%
and treat themselves they still have to
 
03:29:16.910 --> 03:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
go to a doctor
 
03:29:19.729 --> 03:29:19.739 align:start position:0%
if they want to get uh medications
 
03:29:22.790 --> 03:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
ordered or treatments ordered so it's
 
03:29:27.229 --> 03:29:27.239 align:start position:0%
still a partnership uh it's kind of um
 
03:29:29.870 --> 03:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
it's kind of paternalistic to be told
 
03:29:32.809 --> 03:29:32.819 align:start position:0%
that as patients we're not supposed to
 
03:29:35.030 --> 03:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
be uh
 
03:29:38.570 --> 03:29:38.580 align:start position:0%
kept as aware of possible of our own
 
03:29:41.210 --> 03:29:41.220 align:start position:0%
medical condition you know it is a
 
03:29:44.690 --> 03:29:44.700 align:start position:0%
partnership and uh we we have to hold
 
03:29:45.650 --> 03:29:45.660 align:start position:0%
our own
 
03:29:47.809 --> 03:29:47.819 align:start position:0%
so I certainly think this is a great
 
03:29:50.630 --> 03:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
deal I'm certain representative gay one
 
03:29:53.510 --> 03:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
of the spinal surgeons with whom you had
 
03:29:59.710 --> 03:29:59.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:02.389 --> 03:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
I thought he would really listen to that
 
03:30:05.690 --> 03:30:05.700 align:start position:0%
statement though that's so personal no
 
03:30:07.790 --> 03:30:07.800 align:start position:0%
they were down here from this end of the
 
03:30:09.229 --> 03:30:09.239 align:start position:0%

about 10 minutes wow because they said
 
03:59:45.050 --> 03:59:45.060 align:start position:0%
they had three and four hour Waits the
 
03:59:47.809 --> 03:59:47.819 align:start position:0%
first day well we went up to Sears we've

um and they were they were really well
 
04:00:02.389 --> 04:00:02.399 align:start position:0%
organized uh I mean I mean really very
 
04:00:05.150 --> 04:00:05.160 align:start position:0%
very efficient new everything got us
 
04:00:05.160 --> 04:00:06.349 align:start position:0%
very efficient new everything got us
through

04:00:06.349 --> 04:00:06.359 align:start position:0%
through
 
04:00:08.929 --> 04:00:08.939 align:start position:0%
um and neither one of us had any side
 
04:00:11.090 --> 04:00:11.100 align:start position:0%
effects for either one I was very
 
04:00:13.550 --> 04:00:13.560 align:start position:0%
impressed but so I've got my old number
 
04:00:15.650 --> 04:00:15.660 align:start position:0%

said was if they sent me to check on you
 
04:00:38.269 --> 04:00:38.279 align:start position:0%
the response would be that you're doing
 
04:00:40.870 --> 04:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
a wonderful job
 
04:00:44.469 --> 04:00:44.479 align:start position:0%
congratulations Jim yeah
 
04:00:47.389 --> 04:00:47.399 align:start position:0%

04:00:47.399 --> 04:00:48.530 align:start position:0%
you can probably put that in the paper
yeah

04:00:48.530 --> 04:00:48.540 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:00:51.349 --> 04:00:51.359 align:start position:0%

04:02:13.309 --> 04:02:13.319 align:start position:0%
all thank you all for your service to
 
04:02:15.530 --> 04:02:15.540 align:start position:0%
the state and representative McKay I'm
 
04:02:20.090 --> 04:02:20.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:22.969 --> 04:02:22.979 align:start position:0%
um I'm not I haven't yet gotten it but
 
04:02:25.490 --> 04:02:25.500 align:start position:0%
I'm sure it will be as good as you uh
 
04:02:28.309 --> 04:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
suggested so I'm Tom rafio president CEO
 
04:02:30.410 --> 04:02:30.420 align:start position:0%
of Northeast Dela Dental I know I know
 
04:02:32.689 --> 04:02:32.699 align:start position:0%
most of you and of course this bill is
 
04:02:35.689 --> 04:02:35.699 align:start position:0%
you know similar to HB 250 last session
 
04:02:38.150 --> 04:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
which like many things in 2020 didn't
 
04:02:39.530 --> 04:02:39.540 align:start position:0%
make it over
 
04:02:41.809 --> 04:02:41.819 align:start position:0%
um the Finish Line Northeast Delta
 
04:02:44.689 --> 04:02:44.699 align:start position:0%
Dental we are not non-profit but the
 
04:02:46.790 --> 04:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
largest dental benefits insurer in the
 
04:02:49.610 --> 04:02:49.620 align:start position:0%
state we have one Mission only and
 
04:02:51.290 --> 04:02:51.300 align:start position:0%
that's to improve the oral health and
 
04:02:53.210 --> 04:02:53.220 align:start position:0%
access to dental care
 
04:02:56.450 --> 04:02:56.460 align:start position:0%
for everyone so our new tagline is
 
04:02:59.570 --> 04:02:59.580 align:start position:0%
everybody deserves a healthy smile
 
04:03:02.450 --> 04:03:02.460 align:start position:0%
not just people with traditional dental
 
04:03:04.849 --> 04:03:04.859 align:start position:0%
coverage like yourself if you have it
 
04:03:07.309 --> 04:03:07.319 align:start position:0%
through Delta Dental and we have
 
04:03:09.469 --> 04:03:09.479 align:start position:0%
probably 60 to 70 percent of the
 
04:03:11.450 --> 04:03:11.460 align:start position:0%
Employers in this beautiful state have
 
04:03:13.370 --> 04:03:13.380 align:start position:0%
our coverage and many many
 
04:03:16.070 --> 04:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
individuals have it through our private
 
04:03:18.590 --> 04:03:18.600 align:start position:0%
exchange or healthcare.gov but everybody
 
04:03:23.750 --> 04:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
deserves a healthy smile and so
 
04:03:26.389 --> 04:03:26.399 align:start position:0%
um HB 103 Builds on the important work
 
04:03:28.729 --> 04:03:28.739 align:start position:0%
of the work group that was enacted in
 
04:03:31.790 --> 04:03:31.800 align:start position:0%
law in 2019 to create an implementation
 
04:03:35.689 --> 04:03:35.699 align:start position:0%
plan I of course understand that the
 
04:03:38.750 --> 04:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
Senate bill Senate Bill 150 which passed
 
04:03:41.389 --> 04:03:41.399 align:start position:0%
out of the Senate with a 5-0 vote and
 
04:03:43.189 --> 04:03:43.199 align:start position:0%
will be voted on by the full Senate this
 
04:03:43.199 --> 04:03:44.229 align:start position:0%
will be voted on by the full Senate this
Thursday

04:03:44.229 --> 04:03:44.239 align:start position:0%
Thursday
 
04:03:47.090 --> 04:03:47.100 align:start position:0%
this bill is consistent with that and I
 
04:03:48.349 --> 04:03:48.359 align:start position:0%
understand that there may be an
 
04:03:51.469 --> 04:03:51.479 align:start position:0%
amendment to uh you know make it even
 
04:03:55.010 --> 04:03:55.020 align:start position:0%
more can make the two bills even more
 
04:03:57.650 --> 04:03:57.660 align:start position:0%
consistent that's correct so
 
04:04:00.110 --> 04:04:00.120 align:start position:0%
implementation date I mean I've been uh
 
04:04:02.269 --> 04:04:02.279 align:start position:0%
I've been at this literally I came to
 
04:04:04.670 --> 04:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in 1995 and have been
 
04:04:07.429 --> 04:04:07.439 align:start position:0%
talking about this issue literally now
 
04:04:10.309 --> 04:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
for a quarter quarter or a century and I
 
04:04:12.530 --> 04:04:12.540 align:start position:0%
was hoping that in my professional
 
04:04:14.990 --> 04:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
lifetime that this could actually happen
 
04:04:16.729 --> 04:04:16.739 align:start position:0%
and I think it would have uh already
 
04:04:19.610 --> 04:04:19.620 align:start position:0%
perhaps you know short of the uh shorter
 
04:04:21.650 --> 04:04:21.660 align:start position:0%
of the pandemic but now it's uh now we
 
04:04:24.410 --> 04:04:24.420 align:start position:0%
have this a great opportunity
 
04:04:26.090 --> 04:04:26.100 align:start position:0%
um to make it happen even if it's not
 
04:04:28.849 --> 04:04:28.859 align:start position:0%
implemented until 2023 we have to keep
 
04:04:31.070 --> 04:04:31.080 align:start position:0%
the ball moving forward it'll increase
 
04:04:33.229 --> 04:04:33.239 align:start position:0%
the employability of many working New
 
04:04:35.269 --> 04:04:35.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire adults
 
04:04:37.070 --> 04:04:37.080 align:start position:0%
um and and we've given you all these
 
04:04:39.410 --> 04:04:39.420 align:start position:0%
stats but it will save on emergency room
 
04:04:39.420 --> 04:04:41.030 align:start position:0%
stats but it will save on emergency room
costs

04:04:41.030 --> 04:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
costs
 
04:04:43.070 --> 04:04:43.080 align:start position:0%
um there's there's a lot of studies out
 
04:04:44.929 --> 04:04:44.939 align:start position:0%
there which suggest and we're very
 
04:04:47.330 --> 04:04:47.340 align:start position:0%
conservative here but it'll also Save A
 
04:04:49.750 --> 04:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
Lot on the medical side there's so much
 
04:04:53.150 --> 04:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
interrelationship between a lot of
 
04:04:55.910 --> 04:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
conditions and so in the in the long run
 
04:04:58.849 --> 04:04:58.859 align:start position:0%
there'll probably be savings on on the
 
04:05:01.309 --> 04:05:01.319 align:start position:0%
medical side so we really need to
 
04:05:03.650 --> 04:05:03.660 align:start position:0%
continue the progress and then move this
 
04:05:06.590 --> 04:05:06.600 align:start position:0%
move this forward I want to urge the
 
04:05:08.750 --> 04:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
committee to pass HB 103 and that
 
04:05:10.429 --> 04:05:10.439 align:start position:0%
amendment that I I think will happen is
 
04:05:12.410 --> 04:05:12.420 align:start position:0%
fine with us we thank representative
 
04:05:14.210 --> 04:05:14.220 align:start position:0%

04:05:17.090 --> 04:05:17.100 align:start position:0%

04:05:20.570 --> 04:05:20.580 align:start position:0%
um the mouth is part of the body you
 
04:05:22.130 --> 04:05:22.140 align:start position:0%
can't have good overall health without
 
04:05:24.650 --> 04:05:24.660 align:start position:0%
good oral health well in the long run
 
04:05:27.290 --> 04:05:27.300 align:start position:0%
save the state money get more people
 
04:05:29.389 --> 04:05:29.399 align:start position:0%
employed and everybody deserves a
 
04:05:31.610 --> 04:05:31.620 align:start position:0%
healthy smile and let's make this happen
 
04:05:33.769 --> 04:05:33.779 align:start position:0%
we're we're in sync with the New
 
04:05:36.290 --> 04:05:36.300 align:start position:0%

[Music]

04:06:00.710 --> 04:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:06:02.689 --> 04:06:02.699 align:start position:0%
representative Woods
 
04:06:04.729 --> 04:06:04.739 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
04:06:07.429 --> 04:06:07.439 align:start position:0%
Raphael for taking my question uh do you
 
04:06:09.650 --> 04:06:09.660 align:start position:0%
have any studies uh from the dental
 
04:06:12.590 --> 04:06:12.600 align:start position:0%
perspective of the exact uh economic
 
04:06:16.490 --> 04:06:16.500 align:start position:0%
impact of improved oral health
 
04:06:20.290 --> 04:06:20.300 align:start position:0%
um uh um do you have anything available
 
04:06:23.030 --> 04:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
yeah we and we I mean the Department's
 
04:06:25.130 --> 04:06:25.140 align:start position:0%
had a lot of that my actuary Courtney
 
04:06:27.229 --> 04:06:27.239 align:start position:0%
Warren has been on the work group
 
04:06:29.929 --> 04:06:29.939 align:start position:0%
there's a famous study called the Wakely
 
04:06:32.210 --> 04:06:32.220 align:start position:0%
study which is relatively new which gets
 
04:06:34.849 --> 04:06:34.859 align:start position:0%
into the the bet the benefit of the
 
04:06:37.130 --> 04:06:37.140 align:start position:0%
value proposition so I think the
 
04:06:39.229 --> 04:06:39.239 align:start position:0%
committee representative Woods has all
 
04:06:41.450 --> 04:06:41.460 align:start position:0%
that but we can certainly uh send you
 
04:06:46.610 --> 04:06:46.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:50.090 --> 04:06:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:55.610 --> 04:06:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:55.620 --> 04:06:58.330 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:06:58.330 --> 04:06:58.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:01.490 --> 04:07:01.500 align:start position:0%
uh secondly uh this is sort of a signed
 
04:07:03.590 --> 04:07:03.600 align:start position:0%
question uh do you know if from the
 
04:07:05.330 --> 04:07:05.340 align:start position:0%
dental perspective that they're working
 
04:07:07.849 --> 04:07:07.859 align:start position:0%
uh with other agencies like the American
 
04:07:11.870 --> 04:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
Medical Association uh to collaborate in
 
04:07:14.809 --> 04:07:14.819 align:start position:0%

Plans

04:07:18.410 --> 04:07:18.420 align:start position:0%
Plans
 
04:07:20.689 --> 04:07:20.699 align:start position:0%
that's that's a a great question that's
 
04:07:23.030 --> 04:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
what that's what my life proposition is
 
04:07:25.189 --> 04:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
about more and more Physicians and
 
04:07:26.870 --> 04:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
dentists are cooperating there's more
 
04:07:29.870 --> 04:07:29.880 align:start position:0%
and more uh cooperation between medical
 
04:07:32.170 --> 04:07:32.180 align:start position:0%
schools and dental schools between
 
04:07:35.510 --> 04:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
pediatricians and dentists so we are we
 
04:07:37.670 --> 04:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
are working towards that
 
04:07:40.189 --> 04:07:40.199 align:start position:0%
um there's a great book called teeth by
 
04:07:42.410 --> 04:07:42.420 align:start position:0%
Mary Otto that I encourage you all if
 
04:07:44.689 --> 04:07:44.699 align:start position:0%
you get a chance to read and really gets
 
04:07:47.090 --> 04:07:47.100 align:start position:0%

country on this we've come a long way it
 
04:07:51.290 --> 04:07:51.300 align:start position:0%
explains why originally the head was
 
04:07:53.750 --> 04:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
separated from the body but we all now
 
04:07:53.760 --> 04:07:54.950 align:start position:0%
separated from the body but we all now
know

04:07:54.950 --> 04:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:07:56.570 --> 04:07:56.580 align:start position:0%
um that you that we have to connect
 
04:07:58.670 --> 04:07:58.680 align:start position:0%

overall health of our community
 
04:09:08.870 --> 04:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
we all know that good dental health and
 
04:09:10.790 --> 04:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
oral hygiene is of critical importance
 
04:09:14.510 --> 04:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
in fact many people often are surprised
 
04:09:17.269 --> 04:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
to learn that the number one cause
 
04:09:19.670 --> 04:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
other than a pandemic the number one
 
04:09:21.710 --> 04:09:21.720 align:start position:0%
cause for a young person to miss a day
 
04:09:23.750 --> 04:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
of school is still an untreated
 
04:09:23.760 --> 04:09:25.010 align:start position:0%
of school is still an untreated
toothache

04:09:25.010 --> 04:09:25.020 align:start position:0%
toothache
 
04:09:27.410 --> 04:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
as an adult you don't have to have good
 
04:09:29.389 --> 04:09:29.399 align:start position:0%
dental coverage if you don't have good
 
04:09:31.070 --> 04:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
dental coverage your muscle much less
 
04:09:33.170 --> 04:09:33.180 align:start position:0%
likely to undertake preventive care such
 
04:09:35.689 --> 04:09:35.699 align:start position:0%
as annual screenings and cleanings if
 
04:09:37.429 --> 04:09:37.439 align:start position:0%
you're also you're also much more likely
 
04:09:40.130 --> 04:09:40.140 align:start position:0%
to get have small issues such as routine
 
04:09:43.309 --> 04:09:43.319 align:start position:0%
carriers or periodontists periodontists
 
04:09:45.710 --> 04:09:45.720 align:start position:0%
become more serious issues requiring
 
04:09:48.349 --> 04:09:48.359 align:start position:0%
extensive procedures like extractions or
 
04:09:51.229 --> 04:09:51.239 align:start position:0%
gingivectomies oftentimes lacking dental
 
04:09:52.910 --> 04:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
insurance means that these procedures
 
04:09:55.490 --> 04:09:55.500 align:start position:0%
become emergency room procedures much
 
04:09:58.010 --> 04:09:58.020 align:start position:0%
more expensive to treat reactive Dental
 
04:09:59.870 --> 04:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
approaches can also lead to significant
 
04:10:01.849 --> 04:10:01.859 align:start position:0%
pain which in turn can result in
 
04:10:04.010 --> 04:10:04.020 align:start position:0%
addiction to pain medications
 
04:10:06.650 --> 04:10:06.660 align:start position:0%
poor oral health can easily result in
 
04:10:08.510 --> 04:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
other negative consequences affecting a
 
04:10:10.510 --> 04:10:10.520 align:start position:0%
person's employability and Mental Health
 
04:10:12.650 --> 04:10:12.660 align:start position:0%
Data shows that a strong Community
 
04:10:14.330 --> 04:10:14.340 align:start position:0%
return on investment for good dental
 
04:10:17.269 --> 04:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
care and demonstrates that dental health
 
04:10:19.429 --> 04:10:19.439 align:start position:0%
is a significant determinant in overall
 
04:10:21.650 --> 04:10:21.660 align:start position:0%
health for all of these reasons we would
 
04:10:23.809 --> 04:10:23.819 align:start position:0%
strongly endorse HP 103 and encourage
 
04:10:25.729 --> 04:10:25.739 align:start position:0%
you to pass it with a recommendation
 
04:10:27.769 --> 04:10:27.779 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:10:36.290 --> 04:10:36.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:40.250 --> 04:10:40.260 align:start position:0%
and that exhausts the list of people
 
04:10:42.290 --> 04:10:42.300 align:start position:0%
that I have who have signed up by the
 
04:10:45.490 --> 04:10:45.500 align:start position:0%
deadline to testify
 
04:10:52.150 --> 04:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:55.610 --> 04:10:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:57.889 --> 04:10:57.899 align:start position:0%
I didn't have my oh I'm sorry I didn't
 
04:11:02.570 --> 04:11:02.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:04.550 --> 04:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
not a problem
 
04:11:07.910 --> 04:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
I see no further people testifying and
 
04:11:11.450 --> 04:11:11.460 align:start position:0%
no questions and we are waiting
 
04:11:11.460 --> 04:11:12.229 align:start position:0%
no questions and we are waiting
um

04:11:12.229 --> 04:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:12.239 --> 04:11:14.990 align:start position:0%
um
sorry

04:11:14.990 --> 04:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:18.410 --> 04:11:18.420 align:start position:0%
an amendment has just been sent to the
 
04:11:21.229 --> 04:11:21.239 align:start position:0%
committee relevant to this bill and I'm
 
04:11:24.349 --> 04:11:24.359 align:start position:0%
hoping hard copy will come down to us on
 
04:11:39.050 --> 04:11:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:39.060 --> 04:11:46.670 align:start position:0%
 
ready

04:11:46.670 --> 04:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:48.950 --> 04:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
thank you may I suggest we take a
 
04:11:50.750 --> 04:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
five-minute recess of people to look at
 
04:11:52.610 --> 04:11:52.620 align:start position:0%
the amendment that we just sent out and
 
04:11:55.010 --> 04:11:55.020 align:start position:0%
that Betty representative
 
04:11:58.370 --> 04:11:58.380 align:start position:0%
sounds like a plan all around am I right
 
04:12:01.130 --> 04:12:01.140 align:start position:0%
in thinking that the amendment is
 
04:12:03.469 --> 04:12:03.479 align:start position:0%
just so we've got the right
 
04:12:07.309 --> 04:12:07.319 align:start position:0%
I didn't hear that zero the amendment is
 
04:12:13.729 --> 04:12:13.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:24.530 --> 04:12:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:24.540 --> 04:12:26.929 align:start position:0%
 
Adventure

04:12:26.929 --> 04:12:26.939 align:start position:0%
Adventure
 
04:12:29.210 --> 04:12:29.220 align:start position:0%
and we're just curious for that to come
 
04:12:29.220 --> 04:12:37.330 align:start position:0%
and we're just curious for that to come
down

04:12:37.330 --> 04:12:37.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:39.950 --> 04:12:39.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I don't think that's been
 
04:12:41.689 --> 04:12:41.699 align:start position:0%
sent out to the committee the last one I
 
04:12:44.530 --> 04:12:44.540 align:start position:0%
have from representative from Ms forcier
 
04:12:50.150 --> 04:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
is 0678 and that's house bill 503. it
 
04:12:51.769 --> 04:12:51.779 align:start position:0%
came from Bill Marsh
 
04:12:51.779 --> 04:12:53.689 align:start position:0%
came from Bill Marsh
it

04:12:53.689 --> 04:12:53.699 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:12:56.769 --> 04:12:56.779 align:start position:0%
115 from Bill Marsh who says forwarded
 
04:13:00.410 --> 04:13:00.420 align:start position:0%
okay I'll check I just received it about
 
04:13:03.410 --> 04:13:03.420 align:start position:0%
six minutes ago yeah I I have it in hand
 
04:13:06.590 --> 04:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
right here and printed wow could you cut
 
04:13:09.429 --> 04:13:09.439 align:start position:0%
could you hand me one
 
04:13:13.550 --> 04:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
now you ever have my copy thank you
 
04:13:15.790 --> 04:13:15.800 align:start position:0%
well I have 9
 
04:13:18.530 --> 04:13:18.540 align:start position:0%
684 amendments from representative Marsh
 
04:13:20.870 --> 04:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
but not this one but that probably means
 
04:13:25.309 --> 04:13:25.319 align:start position:0%
that Comcast has eaten it oh there it is
 
04:13:30.600 --> 04:13:30.610 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:30.610 --> 04:13:37.250 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:13:37.250 --> 04:13:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:46.150 --> 04:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:48.290 --> 04:13:48.300 align:start position:0%
can I ask a question though although we
 
04:13:49.910 --> 04:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
said we take time to look at it one
 
04:13:51.229 --> 04:13:51.239 align:start position:0%
thing that will guide us is if we know
 
04:13:52.490 --> 04:13:52.500 align:start position:0%
what things are different for example
 
04:13:55.250 --> 04:13:55.260 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at uh lines three through
 
04:13:56.990 --> 04:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
nine and there they seem to be quite
 
04:14:00.469 --> 04:14:00.479 align:start position:0%
similar if not the same as lines 13 to
 
04:14:02.330 --> 04:14:02.340 align:start position:0%
19 at the original bill could you
 
04:14:04.070 --> 04:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
identify what parts are different so we
 
04:14:05.450 --> 04:14:05.460 align:start position:0%
can focus our attention on the different
 
04:14:07.969 --> 04:14:07.979 align:start position:0%
parts and are we actually in the
 
04:14:10.309 --> 04:14:10.319 align:start position:0%
executive session yet we shouldn't we're
 
04:14:12.650 --> 04:14:12.660 align:start position:0%
moving that way no he has to open an
 
04:14:14.570 --> 04:14:14.580 align:start position:0%
executive session yet what this bill
 
04:14:17.030 --> 04:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
does is it makes the statutory
 
04:14:17.040 --> 04:14:20.050 align:start position:0%
does is it makes the statutory
Department

04:14:20.050 --> 04:14:20.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:23.870 --> 04:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
150 as amended by zero six one two s
 
04:14:26.150 --> 04:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
so the uh
 
04:14:28.250 --> 04:14:28.260 align:start position:0%
two final sections of the bill are where
 
04:14:31.010 --> 04:14:31.020 align:start position:0%
the changes are I'll go okay changes
 
04:14:34.070 --> 04:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
when we introduce the amendment
 
04:14:35.510 --> 04:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
but but since we're supposed to spend
 
04:14:36.950 --> 04:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
five minutes looking at it be helpful if
 
04:14:38.630 --> 04:14:38.640 align:start position:0%
we know where to look is it can you just
 
04:14:40.010 --> 04:14:40.020 align:start position:0%
tell us what page what lines are
 
04:14:40.020 --> 04:14:45.790 align:start position:0%
tell us what page what lines are
different

04:14:45.790 --> 04:14:45.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:48.410 --> 04:14:48.420 align:start position:0%
I think there are a few things one is
 
04:14:49.849 --> 04:14:49.859 align:start position:0%
that it changes the date of
 
04:14:52.370 --> 04:14:52.380 align:start position:0%
implementation which is on line 25 on
 
04:14:54.110 --> 04:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
the first page
 
04:14:58.670 --> 04:14:58.680 align:start position:0%
it also aligns the actual benefits
 
04:15:01.370 --> 04:15:01.380 align:start position:0%
on the second page the lower part of the
 
04:15:04.309 --> 04:15:04.319 align:start position:0%
second page to be aligned with Senate
 
04:15:07.610 --> 04:15:07.620 align:start position:0%
Bill 150 and the current um what what
 
04:15:11.950 --> 04:15:11.960 align:start position:0%
lines it helps much if I know what line
 
04:15:16.490 --> 04:15:16.500 align:start position:0%
14 on page two okay thank you
 
04:15:16.500 --> 04:15:17.990 align:start position:0%
14 on page two okay thank you
yep

04:15:17.990 --> 04:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
yep
 
04:15:21.170 --> 04:15:21.180 align:start position:0%
and um so it aligns the actual benefits
 
04:15:24.410 --> 04:15:24.420 align:start position:0%
it changes the implementation date and
 
04:15:26.870 --> 04:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
it makes clear that at some point this
 
04:15:29.870 --> 04:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
will be merged with the children's
 
04:15:29.880 --> 04:15:31.010 align:start position:0%
will be merged with the children's
um

04:15:31.010 --> 04:15:31.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:32.929 --> 04:15:32.939 align:start position:0%
schedule program
 
04:15:32.939 --> 04:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
schedule program
okay

04:15:50.400 --> 04:15:50.410 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:50.410 --> 04:16:08.809 align:start position:0%
 
[Applause]

04:16:08.809 --> 04:16:08.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:08.819 --> 04:16:17.630 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:16:17.630 --> 04:16:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:17.640 --> 04:16:19.030 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:16:19.030 --> 04:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:16:24.650 --> 04:16:24.660 align:start position:0%
on the amendment on page two
 
04:16:27.349 --> 04:16:27.359 align:start position:0%
on line six
 
04:16:30.410 --> 04:16:30.420 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have a deadline or time frame
 
04:16:33.590 --> 04:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
for the state to modify the state plan
 
04:16:36.590 --> 04:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
with Medicare medicide Medicaid
 
04:16:39.349 --> 04:16:39.359 align:start position:0%
which it refers back to the date of
 
04:16:41.210 --> 04:16:41.220 align:start position:0%
implementation it says within the
 
04:16:43.429 --> 04:16:43.439 align:start position:0%
quarter of the Year within the three
 
04:16:46.250 --> 04:16:46.260 align:start position:0%
months of the date of implementation
 
04:16:57.769 --> 04:16:57.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:00.349 --> 04:17:00.359 align:start position:0%
those of you in the room uh committee
 
04:17:01.969 --> 04:17:01.979 align:start position:0%
service just said the amendment's being
 
04:17:03.990 --> 04:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
run down here
 
04:17:04.000 --> 04:17:12.290 align:start position:0%
run down here
[Music]

04:17:12.290 --> 04:17:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:14.870 --> 04:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
no just to make it formal I'm going to
 
04:17:19.030 --> 04:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:26.510 --> 04:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:30.170 --> 04:17:30.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:33.830 --> 04:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
and Hospital 103.
 
04:17:36.650 --> 04:17:36.660 align:start position:0%
did you actually credit here
 
04:17:42.889 --> 04:17:42.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:44.689 --> 04:17:44.699 align:start position:0%
we can certainly discuss it I just
 
04:17:52.429 --> 04:17:52.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:52.439 --> 04:17:56.150 align:start position:0%
 
I

04:17:56.150 --> 04:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:56.160 --> 04:17:56.870 align:start position:0%
 
hope

04:17:56.870 --> 04:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
hope
 
04:17:59.990 --> 04:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
the exception on 103. so we can discuss
 
04:18:00.000 --> 04:18:01.490 align:start position:0%
the exception on 103. so we can discuss
this

04:18:01.490 --> 04:18:01.500 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:18:06.710 --> 04:18:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:10.010 --> 04:18:10.020 align:start position:0%
well I would move if we adopt Amendment
 
04:18:12.410 --> 04:18:12.420 align:start position:0%
zero six eight eight
 
04:18:14.870 --> 04:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
I will second that okay and we're going
 
04:18:17.030 --> 04:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
to wait we can discuss that while some
 
04:18:19.870 --> 04:18:19.880 align:start position:0%
of us are waiting for it
 
04:18:19.880 --> 04:18:22.309 align:start position:0%
of us are waiting for it
[Music]

04:18:22.309 --> 04:18:22.319 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:18:26.150 --> 04:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
so I think I already said this but
 
04:18:28.429 --> 04:18:28.439 align:start position:0%
um people didn't hear it or people
 
04:18:29.870 --> 04:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
didn't have the amendment in front of
 
04:18:32.090 --> 04:18:32.100 align:start position:0%
them I think this amendment does a few
 
04:18:32.100 --> 04:18:34.130 align:start position:0%
them I think this amendment does a few
things

04:18:34.130 --> 04:18:34.140 align:start position:0%
things
 
04:18:36.590 --> 04:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
um one it aligns
 
04:18:40.689 --> 04:18:40.699 align:start position:0%
House Bill 103 with Senate bill
 
04:18:44.150 --> 04:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
one five zero which has just been passed
 
04:18:45.830 --> 04:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
out of Health and Human Services in the
 
04:18:48.469 --> 04:18:48.479 align:start position:0%
Senate by uh five to zero vote ought to
 
04:18:48.479 --> 04:18:49.429 align:start position:0%
Senate by uh five to zero vote ought to
pass

04:18:49.429 --> 04:18:49.439 align:start position:0%
pass
 
04:18:52.849 --> 04:18:52.859 align:start position:0%
so it really makes these identical bills
 
04:18:55.250 --> 04:18:55.260 align:start position:0%
and one of the things it does is it
 
04:18:57.170 --> 04:18:57.180 align:start position:0%
changes the date of implementation to
 
04:19:01.189 --> 04:19:01.199 align:start position:0%
January 1st 2023
 
04:19:04.370 --> 04:19:04.380 align:start position:0%
it also takes the language about the
 
04:19:06.349 --> 04:19:06.359 align:start position:0%
actual benefits it doesn't really change
 
04:19:09.410 --> 04:19:09.420 align:start position:0%
what the benefits are but it takes the
 
04:19:12.590 --> 04:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
language about the actual benefits on
 
04:19:16.790 --> 04:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
page two line 14 to line 20 and makes
 
04:19:19.729 --> 04:19:19.739 align:start position:0%
those identical with the Senate bill and
 
04:19:22.010 --> 04:19:22.020 align:start position:0%
also aligns them with the working group
 
04:19:25.130 --> 04:19:25.140 align:start position:0%
in DHHS about what they've based their
 
04:19:26.630 --> 04:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
estimates on
 
04:19:29.809 --> 04:19:29.819 align:start position:0%
the other thing it does is makes clear
 
04:19:34.309 --> 04:19:34.319 align:start position:0%
that this will eventually be merged the
 
04:19:37.550 --> 04:19:37.560 align:start position:0%
Children's Dental benefit to try to put
 
04:19:41.150 --> 04:19:41.160 align:start position:0%
it all into one program to affect cost
 
04:19:41.160 --> 04:19:42.370 align:start position:0%
it all into one program to affect cost
savings

04:19:42.370 --> 04:19:42.380 align:start position:0%
savings
 
04:19:45.170 --> 04:19:45.180 align:start position:0%
so um representative Marsh can add
 
04:19:47.090 --> 04:19:47.100 align:start position:0%
something if there's more but I that
 
04:19:49.689 --> 04:19:49.699 align:start position:0%
those are the major changes that this
 
04:19:51.849 --> 04:19:51.859 align:start position:0%
amendment makes
 
04:19:55.010 --> 04:19:55.020 align:start position:0%
uh I would I would agree with that and I
 
04:19:56.210 --> 04:19:56.220 align:start position:0%
would point out that some of those
 
04:19:58.250 --> 04:19:58.260 align:start position:0%
changes were made so that we can
 
04:20:00.830 --> 04:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
actually do it for our physical
 
04:20:03.110 --> 04:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
environment and that is something that's
 
04:20:04.610 --> 04:20:04.620 align:start position:0%
important to me because I try to be
 
04:20:07.849 --> 04:20:07.859 align:start position:0%
responsible uh and so so that was my
 
04:20:10.490 --> 04:20:10.500 align:start position:0%
major objection before it didn't have an
 
04:20:12.830 --> 04:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
Actuarial note but now we have a good
 
04:20:14.929 --> 04:20:14.939 align:start position:0%
Actuarial data that we've received just
 
04:20:18.290 --> 04:20:18.300 align:start position:0%
for the last few days both from the
 
04:20:20.990 --> 04:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
state and fiscal note and from uh Delta
 
04:20:24.290 --> 04:20:24.300 align:start position:0%
Dental and the Actuarial nails and that
 
04:20:25.969 --> 04:20:25.979 align:start position:0%
persuades me that this is a reasonable
 
04:20:25.979 --> 04:20:27.950 align:start position:0%
persuades me that this is a reasonable
time

04:20:27.950 --> 04:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:20:30.650 --> 04:20:30.660 align:start position:0%
one additional thing about the amendment
 
04:20:32.750 --> 04:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
and pushing the data out further which
 
04:20:34.910 --> 04:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
pains me to tell you the truth January
 
04:20:38.510 --> 04:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
1st 2023 seems like a long ways away but
 
04:20:40.729 --> 04:20:40.739 align:start position:0%
the estimates that the
 
04:20:40.739 --> 04:20:41.750 align:start position:0%
the estimates that the
um

04:20:41.750 --> 04:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:44.510 --> 04:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
Dental benefit working group and DHHS
 
04:20:44.520 --> 04:20:46.130 align:start position:0%
Dental benefit working group and DHHS
made

04:20:46.130 --> 04:20:46.140 align:start position:0%
made
 
04:20:48.469 --> 04:20:48.479 align:start position:0%
um Were Meant to
 
04:20:51.490 --> 04:20:51.500 align:start position:0%
look forward to a time after
 
04:20:54.710 --> 04:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
covid so that the um
 
04:20:57.710 --> 04:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
that the numbers of people on a Medicaid
 
04:21:00.590 --> 04:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
which have been which have swollen
 
04:21:03.469 --> 04:21:03.479 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic would go back down
 
04:21:05.570 --> 04:21:05.580 align:start position:0%
to a more normal
 
04:21:08.750 --> 04:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
um numbers and therefore it would be
 
04:21:10.849 --> 04:21:10.859 align:start position:0%
more affordable to have the benefit
 
04:21:14.229 --> 04:21:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:17.330 --> 04:21:17.340 align:start position:0%
representative gay has something to
 
04:21:17.340 --> 04:21:19.189 align:start position:0%
representative gay has something to
share

04:21:19.189 --> 04:21:19.199 align:start position:0%
share
 
04:21:21.550 --> 04:21:21.560 align:start position:0%
well actually it was a question
 
04:21:23.689 --> 04:21:23.699 align:start position:0%
you probably both answered it
 
04:21:27.349 --> 04:21:27.359 align:start position:0%
financially you're afraid of adding this
 
04:21:32.809 --> 04:21:32.819 align:start position:0%
expense right now uh but 23 SM do you
 
04:21:38.030 --> 04:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
ever do it like six months before 23 or
 
04:21:40.189 --> 04:21:40.199 align:start position:0%
yeah I also don't want to make things
 
04:21:42.050 --> 04:21:42.060 align:start position:0%
super expensive but
 
04:21:44.330 --> 04:21:44.340 align:start position:0%
I'll bet you have cost analysis gonna
 
04:21:47.030 --> 04:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
Shuffle that we're paying out a lot for
 
04:21:50.210 --> 04:21:50.220 align:start position:0%
medical costs and dental care is not
 
04:21:50.220 --> 04:21:53.210 align:start position:0%
medical costs and dental care is not
provided

04:21:53.210 --> 04:21:53.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:55.309 --> 04:21:55.319 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming y'all did this painfully
 
04:21:57.229 --> 04:21:57.239 align:start position:0%
but I really don't like to have to wait
 
04:22:00.170 --> 04:22:00.180 align:start position:0%
till 23 January 23 either
 
04:22:03.769 --> 04:22:03.779 align:start position:0%
I can speak to that I am completely with
 
04:22:03.779 --> 04:22:04.729 align:start position:0%
I can speak to that I am completely with
you

04:22:04.729 --> 04:22:04.739 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:22:04.739 --> 04:22:05.570 align:start position:0%
you
um

04:22:05.570 --> 04:22:05.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:07.610 --> 04:22:07.620 align:start position:0%
however one of the things I've learned
 
04:22:10.309 --> 04:22:10.319 align:start position:0%
is that there's an awful lot of moving
 
04:22:13.490 --> 04:22:13.500 align:start position:0%
parts to anything but specifically to
 
04:22:14.990 --> 04:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
this and there's a lot of people
 
04:22:16.790 --> 04:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
involved and there's the Senate and
 
04:22:18.769 --> 04:22:18.779 align:start position:0%
there's the house and there's the
 
04:22:21.469 --> 04:22:21.479 align:start position:0%
working group and um
 
04:22:24.590 --> 04:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
you know my interest is in it eventually
 
04:22:28.010 --> 04:22:28.020 align:start position:0%
happening and I think this is what we
 
04:22:30.229 --> 04:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
had to do to work with all the other
 
04:22:31.969 --> 04:22:31.979 align:start position:0%
people who are working on this to make
 
04:22:51.229 --> 04:22:51.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:53.330 --> 04:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
we would rather not get in the way of

say the Senate just passed this five to
zero

04:23:25.010 --> 04:23:25.020 align:start position:0%

um on the fiscal note
 
04:23:49.610 --> 04:23:49.620 align:start position:0%
moving it out to 2023
 
04:23:51.950 --> 04:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
how does it impact a fiscal note is it
 
04:23:54.349 --> 04:23:54.359 align:start position:0%
favorable unfavorable or it doesn't make
 
04:23:56.990 --> 04:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:59.870 --> 04:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
I think it's I think it's favorable
 
04:24:02.389 --> 04:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
because the
 
04:24:05.630 --> 04:24:05.640 align:start position:0%
um the numbers of people on Medicaid
 
04:24:07.570 --> 04:24:07.580 align:start position:0%
right now are inflated due to the
 
04:24:11.510 --> 04:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
coronavirus and it is assumed although I
 
04:24:12.889 --> 04:24:12.899 align:start position:0%
learned that we can't assume anything
 
04:24:14.809 --> 04:24:14.819 align:start position:0%
about the virus
 
04:24:16.969 --> 04:24:16.979 align:start position:0%
um that those numbers will go down as
 
04:24:19.070 --> 04:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
the virus recedes and more people go to
 
04:24:21.650 --> 04:24:21.660 align:start position:0%
work and more people are insured in
 
04:24:23.150 --> 04:24:23.160 align:start position:0%
other ways
 
04:24:27.290 --> 04:24:27.300 align:start position:0%

04:26:56.870 --> 04:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
as much as it pains me to do this I am
 
04:26:59.410 --> 04:26:59.420 align:start position:0%
going to move that we retain House Bill
 
04:27:05.030 --> 04:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:05.040 --> 04:27:08.330 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:27:08.330 --> 04:27:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:10.490 --> 04:27:10.500 align:start position:0%
I don't know if there's a second
 
04:27:10.500 --> 04:27:11.630 align:start position:0%
I don't know if there's a second
second

04:27:11.630 --> 04:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
second
 
04:27:17.630 --> 04:27:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:22.189 --> 04:27:22.199 align:start position:0%
um can I speak to this yes you may okay
 
04:27:25.790 --> 04:27:25.800 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned before for our
 
04:27:28.550 --> 04:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
um an enormous number of people involved
 
04:27:31.490 --> 04:27:31.500 align:start position:0%
in this and a number of there's two
 
04:27:33.469 --> 04:27:33.479 align:start position:0%
different bills
 
04:27:36.889 --> 04:27:36.899 align:start position:0%
um and there are there's the fact that
 
04:27:38.929 --> 04:27:38.939 align:start position:0%
money has not
 
04:27:41.570 --> 04:27:41.580 align:start position:0%
was not in the governor's budget
 
04:27:41.580 --> 04:27:43.070 align:start position:0%
was not in the governor's budget
initially

04:27:43.070 --> 04:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
initially
 
04:27:45.349 --> 04:27:45.359 align:start position:0%
and so there are a lot of moving parts
 
04:27:47.929 --> 04:27:47.939 align:start position:0%
and I have done my best to be in touch
 
04:27:47.939 --> 04:27:49.790 align:start position:0%
and I have done my best to be in touch
with

04:27:49.790 --> 04:27:49.800 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:27:49.800 --> 04:27:50.750 align:start position:0%
with
um

04:27:50.750 --> 04:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:53.090 --> 04:27:53.100 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald who sponsored the bill
 
04:27:55.070 --> 04:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
in the Senate the people in the working
 
04:27:58.729 --> 04:27:58.739 align:start position:0%
group representative Marsh who's seems
 
04:28:00.530 --> 04:28:00.540 align:start position:0%
to be a conduit to representative
 
04:28:04.189 --> 04:28:04.199 align:start position:0%
Bradley and um Senators
 
04:28:06.769 --> 04:28:06.779 align:start position:0%
um in the majority
 
04:28:06.779 --> 04:28:07.490 align:start position:0%
um in the majority
um

04:28:07.490 --> 04:28:07.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:10.849 --> 04:28:10.859 align:start position:0%
and I think there are a lot of
 
04:28:13.429 --> 04:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
um positive signs at this point
 
04:28:15.229 --> 04:28:15.239 align:start position:0%
um the working group has come up with a
 
04:28:17.149 --> 04:28:17.159 align:start position:0%
list of benefits
 
04:28:17.159 --> 04:28:17.769 align:start position:0%
list of benefits
um

04:28:17.769 --> 04:28:17.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:20.750 --> 04:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
the um Financial
 
04:28:25.250 --> 04:28:25.260 align:start position:0%
um note was 7.4 million dollars per year
 
04:28:28.070 --> 04:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
and Delta Dental came in with an
 
04:28:29.929 --> 04:28:29.939 align:start position:0%
estimate that was
 
04:28:31.429 --> 04:28:31.439 align:start position:0%
um less than that although they weren't
 
04:28:34.429 --> 04:28:34.439 align:start position:0%
comparing exactly the same things
 
04:28:34.439 --> 04:28:36.429 align:start position:0%
comparing exactly the same things
um

04:28:36.429 --> 04:28:36.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:39.349 --> 04:28:39.359 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson has told me that
 
04:28:42.469 --> 04:28:42.479 align:start position:0%
the um house
 
04:28:42.479 --> 04:28:43.849 align:start position:0%
the um house
um

04:28:43.849 --> 04:28:43.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:46.370 --> 04:28:46.380 align:start position:0%
the house finance committee is looking
 
04:28:48.530 --> 04:28:48.540 align:start position:0%
for what our health care priorities and
 
04:28:51.050 --> 04:28:51.060 align:start position:0%
that he has informed them that a dental
 
04:28:53.929 --> 04:28:53.939 align:start position:0%
benefit is a priority
 
04:28:53.939 --> 04:28:54.590 align:start position:0%
benefit is a priority
um

04:28:54.590 --> 04:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:56.809 --> 04:28:56.819 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of things that are
 
04:28:59.269 --> 04:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
looking very positive but we all know
 
04:29:01.790 --> 04:29:01.800 align:start position:0%
that this has never really happened
 
04:29:07.550 --> 04:29:07.560 align:start position:0%
so the reason I am making a motion to
 
04:29:09.590 --> 04:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
retain this
 
04:29:12.170 --> 04:29:12.180 align:start position:0%
is that
 
04:29:15.170 --> 04:29:15.180 align:start position:0%
there seems to be a
 
04:29:17.389 --> 04:29:17.399 align:start position:0%
um there seems to be a group of people
 
04:29:19.670 --> 04:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
in the Senate who are coalescing around
 
04:29:22.370 --> 04:29:22.380 align:start position:0%
a plan to
 
04:29:22.380 --> 04:29:23.689 align:start position:0%
a plan to
um

04:29:23.689 --> 04:29:23.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:25.969 --> 04:29:25.979 align:start position:0%
put the money into the budget in the
 
04:29:28.490 --> 04:29:28.500 align:start position:0%
Senate and put the policy into the
 
04:29:30.649 --> 04:29:30.659 align:start position:0%
budget in the Senate maybe including
 
04:29:33.290 --> 04:29:33.300 align:start position:0%
table in the Senate bill but in any case
 
04:29:35.929 --> 04:29:35.939 align:start position:0%
making it a reality
 
04:29:39.170 --> 04:29:39.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:39.180 --> 04:29:47.450 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:29:47.450 --> 04:29:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:50.030 --> 04:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
second thing is that I've been informed
 
04:29:50.040 --> 04:29:50.990 align:start position:0%
second thing is that I've been informed
by

04:29:50.990 --> 04:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
by
 
04:29:51.000 --> 04:29:54.469 align:start position:0%
by
um

04:29:54.469 --> 04:29:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:58.630 --> 04:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
representative walner that
 
04:30:01.849 --> 04:30:01.859 align:start position:0%
if our bill goes to the house and gets
 
04:30:04.130 --> 04:30:04.140 align:start position:0%
defeated it will be very difficult for
 
04:30:05.570 --> 04:30:05.580 align:start position:0%
our party
 
04:30:09.050 --> 04:30:09.060 align:start position:0%
maybe both parties to advocate
 
04:30:11.149 --> 04:30:11.159 align:start position:0%
for putting this money in the budget in
 
04:30:12.910 --> 04:30:12.920 align:start position:0%
the finance committee
 
04:30:16.010 --> 04:30:16.020 align:start position:0%
it would make it much more difficult for
 
04:30:18.530 --> 04:30:18.540 align:start position:0%
them to say that the house endorses this
 
04:30:18.540 --> 04:30:21.050 align:start position:0%
them to say that the house endorses this
idea

04:30:21.050 --> 04:30:21.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:26.330 --> 04:30:26.340 align:start position:0%
um thirdly by retaining this bill if a
 
04:30:28.370 --> 04:30:28.380 align:start position:0%
dental benefit does not get put into the
 
04:30:31.189 --> 04:30:31.199 align:start position:0%
budget does not get put into the house
 
04:30:32.649 --> 04:30:32.659 align:start position:0%
bill too
 
04:30:36.530 --> 04:30:36.540 align:start position:0%
then we have a bill that's aligned with
 
04:30:38.269 --> 04:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
the work that's already been done and is
 
04:30:40.429 --> 04:30:40.439 align:start position:0%
ready to go for next year
 
04:30:42.769 --> 04:30:42.779 align:start position:0%
so I feel very
 
04:30:46.189 --> 04:30:46.199 align:start position:0%
um I feel very badly about asking you to
 
04:30:49.070 --> 04:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
retain this bill that I've worked really
 
04:30:50.929 --> 04:30:50.939 align:start position:0%
hard on and a lot of people have worked
 
04:30:53.210 --> 04:30:53.220 align:start position:0%
really hard on but I think it's the
 
04:30:57.889 --> 04:30:57.899 align:start position:0%
logical strategic choice for the moment
 
04:30:57.899 --> 04:31:00.590 align:start position:0%
logical strategic choice for the moment
foreign

04:31:00.590 --> 04:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:00.600 --> 04:31:04.750 align:start position:0%
 
response

04:31:04.750 --> 04:31:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:07.370 --> 04:31:07.380 align:start position:0%
representative Marsh yes I thank
 
04:31:09.410 --> 04:31:09.420 align:start position:0%
representative Senator Shapiro for that
 
04:31:12.590 --> 04:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
and uh uh I was thinking along those
 
04:31:15.950 --> 04:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
same lines until very recently
 
04:31:18.349 --> 04:31:18.359 align:start position:0%
at this point in time it does look to me
 
04:31:20.510 --> 04:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
like the stars are aligning and that the
 
04:31:22.610 --> 04:31:22.620 align:start position:0%
money is going to actually be there to
 
04:31:24.410 --> 04:31:24.420 align:start position:0%
get this done
 
04:31:26.750 --> 04:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
um and that our committee pessimists may
 
04:31:28.969 --> 04:31:28.979 align:start position:0%
be the emphasis to push the Senate bill
 
04:31:33.769 --> 04:31:33.779 align:start position:0%
over the finish line so uh I personally
 
04:31:37.070 --> 04:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
would like to see a motion uh not the
 
04:31:39.950 --> 04:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
passes amended motion before we retain
 
04:31:42.349 --> 04:31:42.359 align:start position:0%
Nation but if that's the world with many
 
04:31:44.870 --> 04:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
to otherwise I respect
 
04:31:47.210 --> 04:31:47.220 align:start position:0%
could I have a can I have a point of
 
04:31:50.330 --> 04:31:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:53.510 --> 04:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm I'm having a hard time
 
04:31:56.149 --> 04:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
hearing representative Marsh there's an
 
04:31:57.950 --> 04:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
echo so
 
04:31:57.960 --> 04:31:59.210 align:start position:0%
echo so
um

04:31:59.210 --> 04:31:59.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:02.510 --> 04:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
were you asking us to do a motion of
 
04:32:06.830 --> 04:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
ought to pass and then retain it no oh
 
04:32:09.530 --> 04:32:09.540 align:start position:0%
good because if we if we move on to pass
 
04:32:12.229 --> 04:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
and it passes it's it's out of our hands
 
04:32:14.809 --> 04:32:14.819 align:start position:0%
so unless somebody moves to reconsider
 
04:32:17.929 --> 04:32:17.939 align:start position:0%
uh so am I right in thinking that you
 
04:32:20.030 --> 04:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
are also in favor of retaining at this
 
04:32:22.969 --> 04:32:22.979 align:start position:0%
point uh no when I said is that I would
 
04:32:27.410 --> 04:32:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:29.630 --> 04:32:29.640 align:start position:0%
so you would like to pass it straight
 
04:32:31.550 --> 04:32:31.560 align:start position:0%
out onto the house floor
 
04:32:36.290 --> 04:32:36.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:40.729 --> 04:32:40.739 align:start position:0%
and what would be if that if the house
 
04:32:42.229 --> 04:32:42.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't go along with us what happens
 
04:32:45.410 --> 04:32:45.420 align:start position:0%
then that is the problem
 
04:32:45.420 --> 04:32:48.290 align:start position:0%
then that is the problem
yeah

04:32:48.290 --> 04:32:48.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:52.070 --> 04:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
I I'm I so what
 
04:32:54.290 --> 04:32:54.300 align:start position:0%
what was it that changed because I'm
 
04:32:56.630 --> 04:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
trying to get wrapped my mind around the
 
04:32:59.630 --> 04:32:59.640 align:start position:0%
fact that there have been a gazillion
 
04:33:02.570 --> 04:33:02.580 align:start position:0%
negotiations on this and a gazillion
 
04:33:05.209 --> 04:33:05.219 align:start position:0%
concessions made in all kinds of
 
04:33:08.810 --> 04:33:08.820 align:start position:0%
different directions and suddenly
 
04:33:10.789 --> 04:33:10.799 align:start position:0%
um we're getting
 
04:33:14.269 --> 04:33:14.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:16.369 --> 04:33:16.379 align:start position:0%
I understand that but I think we finally
 
04:33:18.830 --> 04:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
got the financial analysis that we asked
 
04:33:18.840 --> 04:33:19.789 align:start position:0%
got the financial analysis that we asked
for

04:33:19.789 --> 04:33:19.799 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:33:28.551 --> 04:33:28.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:31.369 --> 04:33:31.379 align:start position:0%
I mean I I I'd be delighted to pass the
 
04:33:35.269 --> 04:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
thing I'm just I'm just concerned about
 
04:33:37.429 --> 04:33:37.439 align:start position:0%
um representations that have been made
 
04:33:39.051 --> 04:33:39.061 align:start position:0%
to people who are not in this room
 
04:33:40.429 --> 04:33:40.439 align:start position:0%
that's all
 
04:33:40.439 --> 04:33:52.849 align:start position:0%
that's all
foreign

04:33:52.849 --> 04:33:52.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:55.670 --> 04:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:33:59.689 --> 04:33:59.699 align:start position:0%
um I I have uh listened with uh I dare I
 
04:34:01.670 --> 04:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
say some confusion to the representative
 
04:34:04.490 --> 04:34:04.500 align:start position:0%
from Keen for whom I have the highest
 
04:34:06.349 --> 04:34:06.359 align:start position:0%
highest respect
 
04:34:09.529 --> 04:34:09.539 align:start position:0%
um and I've heard his ambivalent
 
04:34:11.869 --> 04:34:11.879 align:start position:0%
feelings about
 
04:34:14.990 --> 04:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
um asking to retain this bill I also
 
04:34:16.910 --> 04:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
heard him indicate that there was
 
04:34:19.429 --> 04:34:19.439 align:start position:0%
movement in the Senate but he suggested
 
04:34:22.310 --> 04:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
that the Senate was likely to table this
 
04:34:25.670 --> 04:34:25.680 align:start position:0%
motion so I I have some confusion there
 
04:34:27.949 --> 04:34:27.959 align:start position:0%
I've also listened to the representative
 
04:34:30.529 --> 04:34:30.539 align:start position:0%
from Brookfield for whom I have equal
 
04:34:33.890 --> 04:34:33.900 align:start position:0%
respect uh who says that the numbers are
 
04:34:37.070 --> 04:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
now in place further looking at the
 
04:34:39.349 --> 04:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
state revenues that are coming in it is
 
04:34:42.529 --> 04:34:42.539 align:start position:0%
very likely that to my surprise we will
 
04:34:45.949 --> 04:34:45.959 align:start position:0%
have the budget available to fund this
 
04:34:49.789 --> 04:34:49.799 align:start position:0%
program we all agree that the program is
 
04:34:52.551 --> 04:34:52.561 align:start position:0%
of extraordinary value I must tell you
 
04:34:56.269 --> 04:34:56.279 align:start position:0%
I've worked on this topic for five years
 
04:35:00.349 --> 04:35:00.359 align:start position:0%
now it is time it's time to make this
 
04:35:03.410 --> 04:35:03.420 align:start position:0%
move forward and there's a cost savings
 
04:35:05.689 --> 04:35:05.699 align:start position:0%
built into it we need to take the leap
 
04:35:08.330 --> 04:35:08.340 align:start position:0%
it's an act of Courage please let us
 
04:35:11.330 --> 04:35:11.340 align:start position:0%
defeat uh the retention and pass this
 
04:35:11.340 --> 04:35:14.390 align:start position:0%
defeat uh the retention and pass this
bill

04:35:14.390 --> 04:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:17.689 --> 04:35:17.699 align:start position:0%
and if I may Mr Mr chairman just speak
 
04:35:18.949 --> 04:35:18.959 align:start position:0%
to the table
 
04:35:21.230 --> 04:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
in the Senate
 
04:35:21.240 --> 04:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
in the Senate
administer

04:35:22.240 --> 04:35:22.250 align:start position:0%
administer
 
04:35:22.250 --> 04:35:24.109 align:start position:0%
administer
[Music]

04:35:24.109 --> 04:35:24.119 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:35:25.670 --> 04:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
just go ahead
 
04:35:27.590 --> 04:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
go ahead represent Weber
 
04:35:31.369 --> 04:35:31.379 align:start position:0%
uh what the Senate usually does their
 
04:35:33.890 --> 04:35:33.900 align:start position:0%
their process on
 
04:35:36.650 --> 04:35:36.660 align:start position:0%
sometimes tracking ours but often not
 
04:35:39.890 --> 04:35:39.900 align:start position:0%
tracking ours with bills that contain a
 
04:35:43.609 --> 04:35:43.619 align:start position:0%
a fiscal impact is they will pass them
 
04:35:45.830 --> 04:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
on their floor and then they will table
 
04:35:48.709 --> 04:35:48.719 align:start position:0%
them and just leave them on the table uh
 
04:35:50.570 --> 04:35:50.580 align:start position:0%
but it's it's not the equivalent to
 
04:35:54.051 --> 04:35:54.061 align:start position:0%
retention but that is a procedure that
 
04:35:57.769 --> 04:35:57.779 align:start position:0%
they follow regularly with many many
 
04:36:00.949 --> 04:36:00.959 align:start position:0%
bills that's how they get things into
 
04:36:03.170 --> 04:36:03.180 align:start position:0%
the budget they don't they don't pass
 
04:36:06.429 --> 04:36:06.439 align:start position:0%
the Bill itself which would
 
04:36:08.990 --> 04:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely required gets into the budget
 
04:36:11.631 --> 04:36:11.641 align:start position:0%
they they view it more as a statement of
 
04:36:14.929 --> 04:36:14.939 align:start position:0%
policy that the the bodies adopted
 
04:36:17.510 --> 04:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
um that having been said if if it's the
 
04:36:18.949 --> 04:36:18.959 align:start position:0%
will of the committee to go ahead and
 
04:36:21.949 --> 04:36:21.959 align:start position:0%
vote this ought to pass I'm certainly
 
04:36:26.209 --> 04:36:26.219 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:28.609 --> 04:36:28.619 align:start position:0%
representative Canuck
 
04:36:31.310 --> 04:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
thank you yes I I very much want to see
 
04:36:34.070 --> 04:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
this past too but I I recognize the
 
04:36:36.890 --> 04:36:36.900 align:start position:0%
strategy and I if we do have things
 
04:36:38.689 --> 04:36:38.699 align:start position:0%
moving in the Senate including putting
 
04:36:42.051 --> 04:36:42.061 align:start position:0%
it into the uh budget I think keeping
 
04:36:45.289 --> 04:36:45.299 align:start position:0%
this in our back pocket as a bill which
 
04:36:47.929 --> 04:36:47.939 align:start position:0%
we will have retained gives us that
 
04:36:51.429 --> 04:36:51.439 align:start position:0%
ability to come back in the next uh year
 
04:36:54.590 --> 04:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
if perchance it somehow implodes and
 
04:36:56.929 --> 04:36:56.939 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen and I think that the
 
04:36:58.490 --> 04:36:58.500 align:start position:0%
arguments that were made by
 
04:37:01.551 --> 04:37:01.561 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro regarding the
 
04:37:04.369 --> 04:37:04.379 align:start position:0%
it might be more difficult to push it
 
04:37:07.010 --> 04:37:07.020 align:start position:0%
along if the if the house is taking a
 
04:37:09.529 --> 04:37:09.539 align:start position:0%
position against it makes it a little
 
04:37:11.990 --> 04:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
bit more difficult to
 
04:37:14.449 --> 04:37:14.459 align:start position:0%
to just move ahead with with a ought to
 
04:37:17.449 --> 04:37:17.459 align:start position:0%
pass because of the fact that it I can
 
04:37:19.609 --> 04:37:19.619 align:start position:0%
see some downsides of how it might cause
 
04:37:22.131 --> 04:37:22.141 align:start position:0%
trouble and I can't see any downside of
 
04:37:24.529 --> 04:37:24.539 align:start position:0%
holding back if the Senate is going full
 
04:37:27.349 --> 04:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
steam ahead including in the budget and
 
04:37:28.910 --> 04:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
there's an upside of holding it in
 
04:37:31.070 --> 04:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
retention to give us that fallback
 
04:37:33.890 --> 04:37:33.900 align:start position:0%
position should we need it so I kind of
 
04:37:38.390 --> 04:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:44.051 --> 04:37:44.061 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:48.349 --> 04:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman representative Merchant
 
04:37:48.359 --> 04:37:51.830 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman representative Merchant
Shakira

04:37:51.830 --> 04:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:54.051 --> 04:37:54.061 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the amendment that we
 
04:37:57.289 --> 04:37:57.299 align:start position:0%
just passed in the amendment
 
04:37:59.029 --> 04:37:59.039 align:start position:0%
the date of the contract to take effect
 
04:38:01.490 --> 04:38:01.500 align:start position:0%
is January 2023.
 
04:38:03.890 --> 04:38:03.900 align:start position:0%
so if we do retain this
 
04:38:06.051 --> 04:38:06.061 align:start position:0%
and we act on it next year
 
04:38:07.670 --> 04:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
we're still not going to impact the
 
04:38:13.010 --> 04:38:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:14.990 --> 04:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
that would be correct we could pass it
 
04:38:17.750 --> 04:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
in the exact form of the phone
 
04:38:20.929 --> 04:38:20.939 align:start position:0%
so again strategically speaking if
 
04:38:22.730 --> 04:38:22.740 align:start position:0%
things don't materialize either in the
 
04:38:25.429 --> 04:38:25.439 align:start position:0%
Senate are in House Bill 2 we can
 
04:38:28.189 --> 04:38:28.199 align:start position:0%
revisit this if we retain it instead of
 
04:38:39.470 --> 04:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:42.650 --> 04:38:42.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:44.990 --> 04:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
is that correct I didn't understand your
 
04:38:47.449 --> 04:38:47.459 align:start position:0%
question well basically if we we came
 
04:38:48.769 --> 04:38:48.779 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
04:38:52.070 --> 04:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
as as it's amended
 
04:38:54.890 --> 04:38:54.900 align:start position:0%
and the Senate doesn't act on it or
 
04:38:57.590 --> 04:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't go into House Bill 2 which is
 
04:38:59.631 --> 04:38:59.641 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
04:39:02.449 --> 04:39:02.459 align:start position:0%
we could next year pull it off the
 
04:39:05.631 --> 04:39:05.641 align:start position:0%
retaining act on the bill and still hit
 
04:39:10.189 --> 04:39:10.199 align:start position:0%
the January 2023 implementation date
 
04:39:12.230 --> 04:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
that's a very effective argument
 
04:39:14.631 --> 04:39:14.641 align:start position:0%
representative and it's not in the
 
04:39:16.670 --> 04:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
budget because the budget was passed
 
04:39:19.131 --> 04:39:19.141 align:start position:0%
this year correct
 
04:39:20.810 --> 04:39:20.820 align:start position:0%
I think that's I think that's
 
04:39:20.820 --> 04:39:22.429 align:start position:0%
I think that's I think that's
undetermined

04:39:22.429 --> 04:39:22.439 align:start position:0%
undetermined
 
04:39:24.590 --> 04:39:24.600 align:start position:0%
um because
 
04:39:27.349 --> 04:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
we don't know what will happen if we
 
04:39:29.990 --> 04:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
have to submit this bill again next year
 
04:39:32.570 --> 04:39:32.580 align:start position:0%
we don't know what the numbers will be
 
04:39:34.670 --> 04:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
we don't know what
 
04:39:36.650 --> 04:39:36.660 align:start position:0%
I think that it's possible that the
 
04:39:38.270 --> 04:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
implementation date could be the same
 
04:39:38.280 --> 04:39:40.430 align:start position:0%
implementation date could be the same
but

04:39:40.430 --> 04:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:39:43.490 --> 04:39:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:44.990 --> 04:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:39:47.270 --> 04:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
I had a nice chat with representative
 
04:39:49.690 --> 04:39:49.700 align:start position:0%
Weiler head of house finance and
 
04:39:52.368 --> 04:39:52.378 align:start position:0%
convinced him of the
 
04:39:55.190 --> 04:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
the wise economics and The Frugal
 
04:39:57.050 --> 04:39:57.060 align:start position:0%
economics of doing the right thing it's
 
04:39:59.630 --> 04:39:59.640 align:start position:0%
one of those occasions that we love when
 
04:40:02.090 --> 04:40:02.100 align:start position:0%
doing the right thing for people is also
 
04:40:04.310 --> 04:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
cost effective and he heard that
 
04:40:07.430 --> 04:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
argument he received that argument what
 
04:40:10.910 --> 04:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
he does next is up to him we've had a
 
04:40:13.490 --> 04:40:13.500 align:start position:0%
good discussion and he said he took my
 
04:40:17.270 --> 04:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
point representative Weber
 
04:40:19.490 --> 04:40:19.500 align:start position:0%
um that's a residual I'm sorry
 
04:40:24.170 --> 04:40:24.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:28.390 --> 04:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:30.000 --> 04:40:30.010 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
04:40:30.010 --> 04:40:31.550 align:start position:0%
yes um
[Music]

04:40:31.550 --> 04:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:40:34.850 --> 04:40:34.860 align:start position:0%
I am as I said I was extremely
 
04:40:37.368 --> 04:40:37.378 align:start position:0%
ambivalent about asking to retain this
 
04:40:39.590 --> 04:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
and now I'm a little bit
 
04:40:41.630 --> 04:40:41.640 align:start position:0%
I'm more than a little bit I'm surprised
 
04:40:44.150 --> 04:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
by representative Marsh's suggestion
 
04:40:46.910 --> 04:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
that we not retain it since
 
04:40:51.050 --> 04:40:51.060 align:start position:0%
um part of my decision only one part was
 
04:40:52.670 --> 04:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
came out of discussions with
 
04:40:55.310 --> 04:40:55.320 align:start position:0%
representative Marsh and um
 
04:40:57.590 --> 04:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
his suggestion that would retain it or
 
04:40:57.600 --> 04:40:58.610 align:start position:0%
his suggestion that would retain it or
his

04:40:58.610 --> 04:40:58.620 align:start position:0%
his
 
04:41:00.590 --> 04:41:00.600 align:start position:0%
um passing on suggestions from the
 
04:41:03.050 --> 04:41:03.060 align:start position:0%
Senate that we retain it so
 
04:41:06.288 --> 04:41:06.298 align:start position:0%
I am completely baffled
 
04:41:08.390 --> 04:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
um certainly emotionally I would like to
 
04:41:11.510 --> 04:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
see it go forward and pass
 
04:41:11.520 --> 04:41:12.708 align:start position:0%
see it go forward and pass
um

04:41:12.708 --> 04:41:12.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:12.718 --> 04:41:15.948 align:start position:0%
um
so

04:41:15.948 --> 04:41:15.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:18.288 --> 04:41:18.298 align:start position:0%
what am I trying to say besides that I'm
 
04:41:20.750 --> 04:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
confused I guess one thing that I don't
 
04:41:24.050 --> 04:41:24.060 align:start position:0%
know that there's an answer to but
 
04:41:24.060 --> 04:41:25.250 align:start position:0%
know that there's an answer to but
um

04:41:25.250 --> 04:41:25.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:27.288 --> 04:41:27.298 align:start position:0%
I would ask
 
04:41:28.850 --> 04:41:28.860 align:start position:0%
um representative Marsh and maybe
 
04:41:32.208 --> 04:41:32.218 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson as well what your
 
04:41:34.128 --> 04:41:34.138 align:start position:0%
thoughts are
 
04:41:34.138 --> 04:41:36.010 align:start position:0%
thoughts are
um

04:41:36.010 --> 04:41:36.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:38.810 --> 04:41:38.820 align:start position:0%
on what will happen if this goes to the
 
04:41:43.670 --> 04:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
house I mean it is I am certain that the
 
04:41:45.410 --> 04:41:45.420 align:start position:0%
Democratic caucus will support this
 
04:41:45.420 --> 04:41:47.448 align:start position:0%
Democratic caucus will support this
wholeheartedly

04:41:47.448 --> 04:41:47.458 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly
 
04:41:47.458 --> 04:41:48.230 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly
um

04:41:48.230 --> 04:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:51.170 --> 04:41:51.180 align:start position:0%
and so I'm really asking I don't know if
 
04:41:53.448 --> 04:41:53.458 align:start position:0%
this is exactly appropriate if you have
 
04:41:56.390 --> 04:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
any sense of what the Republican caucus
 
04:41:59.628 --> 04:41:59.638 align:start position:0%
will and Leadership will do in terms of
 
04:42:01.550 --> 04:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill should it go to the
 
04:42:06.050 --> 04:42:06.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:08.868 --> 04:42:08.878 align:start position:0%
all I know to answer that representative
 
04:42:13.970 --> 04:42:13.980 align:start position:0%
Shapiro is I have spoken to numbers of
 
04:42:17.030 --> 04:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
my Republican colleagues who
 
04:42:20.270 --> 04:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
listen to me at least
 
04:42:24.288 --> 04:42:24.298 align:start position:0%
and I believe I am making an effective
 
04:42:28.128 --> 04:42:28.138 align:start position:0%
case for this and would speak for it but
 
04:42:34.368 --> 04:42:34.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:36.170 --> 04:42:36.180 align:start position:0%
representative Marsh is not in
 
04:42:39.230 --> 04:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
affirmatively yeah how sessions seem to
 
04:42:41.090 --> 04:42:41.100 align:start position:0%
be attendance driven at this point in
 
04:42:43.430 --> 04:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
time and uh I don't think any of us know
 
04:42:46.190 --> 04:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
what the attendance hope is again uh
 
04:42:47.690 --> 04:42:47.700 align:start position:0%
it's one of those high risk higher
 
04:42:50.288 --> 04:42:50.298 align:start position:0%
rewards versus the safer situation we go
 
04:42:52.250 --> 04:42:52.260 align:start position:0%
debate a very effective argument
 
04:42:53.940 --> 04:42:53.950 align:start position:0%
representative yeah
 
04:42:53.950 --> 04:42:57.948 align:start position:0%
representative yeah
[Music]

04:42:57.948 --> 04:42:57.958 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:43:01.430 --> 04:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
so could I suggest a Way Forward
 
04:43:03.650 --> 04:43:03.660 align:start position:0%
calling the question
 
04:43:06.350 --> 04:43:06.360 align:start position:0%
could I suggest a Way Forward Mr Mr
 
04:43:06.360 --> 04:43:08.110 align:start position:0%
could I suggest a Way Forward Mr Mr
chairman

04:43:08.110 --> 04:43:08.120 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
04:43:11.530 --> 04:43:11.540 align:start position:0%
I would like to suggest
 
04:43:14.030 --> 04:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
please do
 
04:43:18.050 --> 04:43:18.060 align:start position:0%
it it seems to me on the basis of the
 
04:43:23.390 --> 04:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
current discussion that if the maker of
 
04:43:25.310 --> 04:43:25.320 align:start position:0%
the motion and the seconder of the
 
04:43:28.190 --> 04:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
motion wish to withdraw we could
 
04:43:30.410 --> 04:43:30.420 align:start position:0%
withdraw this motion and another motion
 
04:43:33.470 --> 04:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
could be made otherwise we are going to
 
04:43:37.490 --> 04:43:37.500 align:start position:0%
have to vote on the motion to retain and
 
04:43:39.470 --> 04:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
I I will just state that I have heard
 
04:43:41.750 --> 04:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
enough that I will I will now vote
 
04:43:43.670 --> 04:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
against the motion to retain so another
 
04:43:45.850 --> 04:43:45.860 align:start position:0%
motion can be brought
 
04:43:48.770 --> 04:43:48.780 align:start position:0%
this is a question that goes
 
04:43:50.750 --> 04:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
this is a question that goes to
 
04:43:53.448 --> 04:43:53.458 align:start position:0%
Representatives Shapiro and Cushman if
 
04:43:55.310 --> 04:43:55.320 align:start position:0%
they are willing to withdraw and if
 
04:43:56.690 --> 04:43:56.700 align:start position:0%
they're not that's perfectly their
 
04:44:03.590 --> 04:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:03.600 --> 04:44:06.128 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:44:06.128 --> 04:44:06.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:08.868 --> 04:44:08.878 align:start position:0%
I will withdraw the motion and let the
 
04:44:10.730 --> 04:44:10.740 align:start position:0%
committee decide on whether to send it
 
04:44:12.590 --> 04:44:12.600 align:start position:0%
to the house or not
 
04:44:16.730 --> 04:44:16.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:16.740 --> 04:44:20.150 align:start position:0%
 
well

04:44:20.150 --> 04:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:22.250 --> 04:44:22.260 align:start position:0%
it's going to be the same outcome either
 
04:44:22.260 --> 04:44:23.090 align:start position:0%
it's going to be the same outcome either
way

04:44:23.090 --> 04:44:23.100 align:start position:0%
way
 
04:44:25.610 --> 04:44:25.620 align:start position:0%
it's going to either be
 
04:44:27.110 --> 04:44:27.120 align:start position:0%
paid or
 
04:44:30.910 --> 04:44:30.920 align:start position:0%
attention yeah so so I'm fine with
 
04:44:33.590 --> 04:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
withdrawing okay representative Cushman
 
04:44:37.550 --> 04:44:37.560 align:start position:0%
withdraws and so there is now no motion
 
04:44:39.890 --> 04:44:39.900 align:start position:0%
on the floor representative Weber do you
 
04:44:42.650 --> 04:44:42.660 align:start position:0%
care to make a motion no I don't care to
 
04:44:44.448 --> 04:44:44.458 align:start position:0%
make a motion I I think that somebody
 
04:44:46.190 --> 04:44:46.200 align:start position:0%
who has worked on the bill should make a
 
04:44:46.200 --> 04:44:49.128 align:start position:0%
who has worked on the bill should make a
motion

04:44:49.128 --> 04:44:49.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:49.138 --> 04:44:52.190 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:44:52.190 --> 04:44:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:56.270 --> 04:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
sure my question what's the downside of
 
04:44:56.280 --> 04:44:57.530 align:start position:0%
sure my question what's the downside of
retention

04:44:57.530 --> 04:44:57.540 align:start position:0%
retention
 
04:45:02.690 --> 04:45:02.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:05.448 --> 04:45:05.458 align:start position:0%
yes you may uh
 
04:45:08.150 --> 04:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
I want to thank representative Alexander
 
04:45:13.250 --> 04:45:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:15.650 --> 04:45:15.660 align:start position:0%
in the realm of reality and he pointed
 
04:45:18.050 --> 04:45:18.060 align:start position:0%
out to me that a certain bill that we
 
04:45:20.590 --> 04:45:20.600 align:start position:0%
discussed at the last house session
 
04:45:23.390 --> 04:45:23.400 align:start position:0%
and this could very well go the same way
 
04:45:24.890 --> 04:45:24.900 align:start position:0%
and that could be distinctly
 
04:45:24.900 --> 04:45:26.990 align:start position:0%
and that could be distinctly
disadvantageous

04:45:26.990 --> 04:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
disadvantageous
 
04:45:29.448 --> 04:45:29.458 align:start position:0%
can't stop being this convinced me and
 
04:45:31.368 --> 04:45:31.378 align:start position:0%
therefore I will make a motion to retain
 
04:45:38.750 --> 04:45:38.760 align:start position:0%

um uh I would like to speak against the
 
04:54:29.930 --> 04:54:29.940 align:start position:0%
motion first of all I'd like to praise
 
04:54:31.930 --> 04:54:31.940 align:start position:0%
uh the representative from Manchester
 
04:54:35.690 --> 04:54:35.700 align:start position:0%
for his compassion in dealing with the
 
04:54:38.090 --> 04:54:38.100 align:start position:0%
issue of homelessness
 
04:54:40.128 --> 04:54:40.138 align:start position:0%
um I have spoken with him about this
 
04:54:44.930 --> 04:54:44.940 align:start position:0%
privately and I certainly feel that his
 
04:54:48.110 --> 04:54:48.120 align:start position:0%
heart and mind as usual are in the right
 
04:54:48.120 --> 04:54:49.010 align:start position:0%
heart and mind as usual are in the right
place

04:54:49.010 --> 04:54:49.020 align:start position:0%
place
 
04:54:52.628 --> 04:54:52.638 align:start position:0%
however I was warned by a previous
 
04:54:55.070 --> 04:54:55.080 align:start position:0%
chairman of this committee the
 
04:54:57.530 --> 04:54:57.540 align:start position:0%
representative from Walpole that the
 
04:55:00.610 --> 04:55:00.620 align:start position:0%
state has numerous numerous commissions
 
04:55:04.190 --> 04:55:04.200 align:start position:0%
which typically don't get an awful lot
 
04:55:04.200 --> 04:55:05.390 align:start position:0%
which typically don't get an awful lot
done

04:55:05.390 --> 04:55:05.400 align:start position:0%
done
 
04:55:09.170 --> 04:55:09.180 align:start position:0%
creating a new commission is going to
 
04:55:12.368 --> 04:55:12.378 align:start position:0%
pull together numbers of people
 
04:55:15.530 --> 04:55:15.540 align:start position:0%
representing political constituencies
 
04:55:18.470 --> 04:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
which is the manner of such commissions
 
04:55:22.070 --> 04:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
such as for example somebody from the
 
04:55:24.288 --> 04:55:24.298 align:start position:0%
medical society somebody from the
 
04:55:28.190 --> 04:55:28.200 align:start position:0%
nursing association somebody from ACLU
 
04:55:30.230 --> 04:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
oh no I take that away
 
04:55:33.110 --> 04:55:33.120 align:start position:0%
um legal defense I don't know uh numbers
 
04:55:35.570 --> 04:55:35.580 align:start position:0%
of political constituencies that will
 
04:55:38.628 --> 04:55:38.638 align:start position:0%
come together none of whom necessarily
 
04:55:42.770 --> 04:55:42.780 align:start position:0%
has substantial expertise in the area in
 
04:55:46.250 --> 04:55:46.260 align:start position:0%
question we have a commission on housing
 
04:55:49.490 --> 04:55:49.500 align:start position:0%
stability and my friends I would like to
 
04:55:51.590 --> 04:55:51.600 align:start position:0%
point out to you that within the state
 
04:55:55.490 --> 04:55:55.500 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire we have not one but two
 
04:55:59.510 --> 04:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
nationally recognized experts on
 
04:55:59.520 --> 04:56:00.970 align:start position:0%
nationally recognized experts on
homelessness

04:56:00.970 --> 04:56:00.980 align:start position:0%
homelessness
 
04:56:04.490 --> 04:56:04.500 align:start position:0%
homelessness in the urban communities
 
04:56:09.170 --> 04:56:09.180 align:start position:0%
is best represented by our own uh
 
04:56:12.050 --> 04:56:12.060 align:start position:0%
representative from New Market may I
 
04:56:14.208 --> 04:56:14.218 align:start position:0%
name her Mr chairman
 
04:56:17.750 --> 04:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
I know it's not uh normally done yes you
 
04:56:19.868 --> 04:56:19.878 align:start position:0%
may uh representative Charlotte

members of the Pine Street Inn in Boston
 
04:56:31.070 --> 04:56:31.080 align:start position:0%
and is extremely well versed in issues
 
04:56:34.010 --> 04:56:34.020 align:start position:0%
of urban homelessness at the same time
 
04:56:38.510 --> 04:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
at Salem State College is uh rep is uh
 
04:56:41.810 --> 04:56:41.820 align:start position:0%
Professor Yvonne missing a resident of
 
04:56:44.270 --> 04:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
Chester New Hampshire who was the author
 
04:56:47.090 --> 04:56:47.100 align:start position:0%
of the book out of sight out of mind
 
04:56:50.208 --> 04:56:50.218 align:start position:0%
homelessness in small town America which
 
04:56:52.970 --> 04:56:52.980 align:start position:0%
speaks to the issues of rural
 
04:56:55.690 --> 04:56:55.700 align:start position:0%
homelessness we have these two people
 
04:56:59.330 --> 04:56:59.340 align:start position:0%
just within our midst who would be who
 
04:57:01.550 --> 04:57:01.560 align:start position:0%
put together in the same room for two
 
04:57:04.070 --> 04:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
hours could write a report with an
 
04:57:06.110 --> 04:57:06.120 align:start position:0%
action statement appended that would
 
04:57:08.448 --> 04:57:08.458 align:start position:0%
make a great deal of sense I believe
 
04:57:11.270 --> 04:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
members of this committee that um
 
04:57:13.670 --> 04:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
created yet another commission is not
 
04:57:15.590 --> 04:57:15.600 align:start position:0%
the most effective way to deal with
 
04:57:17.330 --> 04:57:17.340 align:start position:0%
homelessness I believe that we should
 
04:57:19.910 --> 04:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
remand it to uh the the commission on
 
04:57:21.890 --> 04:57:21.900 align:start position:0%
housing stability with our instruction
 
04:57:24.650 --> 04:57:24.660 align:start position:0%
that they confer with uh professor
 
04:57:27.050 --> 04:57:27.060 align:start position:0%
vissing and representative De Lorenzo
 
04:57:29.208 --> 04:57:29.218 align:start position:0%
for their help in coming up with a plan
 
04:57:31.190 --> 04:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
for homelessness in New Hampshire and I
 
04:57:34.570 --> 04:57:34.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:37.128 --> 04:57:37.138 align:start position:0%
you may respond representative Marsh
 
04:57:39.830 --> 04:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Solomon
 
04:57:42.230 --> 04:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
um I want to say that I agree with you
 
04:57:44.448 --> 04:57:44.458 align:start position:0%
entirely and I will point out that the
 
04:57:46.730 --> 04:57:46.740 align:start position:0%
motion on the floor does not create a
 
04:57:49.910 --> 04:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
new commission what it does is it sends
 
04:57:52.250 --> 04:57:52.260 align:start position:0%
the issue of Housing and homelessness
 
04:57:54.850 --> 04:57:54.860 align:start position:0%
back to the Council on housing stability
 
04:57:59.150 --> 04:57:59.160 align:start position:0%
it expands their already existing duty
 
04:58:00.948 --> 04:58:00.958 align:start position:0%
to address the issue of homelessness
 
04:58:02.930 --> 04:58:02.940 align:start position:0%
with some of the concerns raised by the
 
04:58:05.330 --> 04:58:05.340 align:start position:0%
initial bill and adds a few members to
 
04:58:08.270 --> 04:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
the commission to uh were thought to be
 
04:58:11.510 --> 04:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh interested in an important in dealing
 
04:58:13.730 --> 04:58:13.740 align:start position:0%
with the problem so we are not creating
 
04:58:15.890 --> 04:58:15.900 align:start position:0%
a new commission by the motion currently
 
04:58:18.288 --> 04:58:18.298 align:start position:0%
on the poor we are remaining it to the
 
04:58:20.090 --> 04:58:20.100 align:start position:0%
new Council on housing stability which
 
04:58:24.350 --> 04:58:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:24.360 --> 04:58:30.550 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:58:30.550 --> 04:58:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:35.030 --> 04:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative gay uh yeah I
 
04:58:37.250 --> 04:58:37.260 align:start position:0%
guess thank you for taking my question
 
04:58:40.730 --> 04:58:40.740 align:start position:0%
it really is uh the problem with the
 
04:58:43.430 --> 04:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
wording is that on 14 line 14 of page
 
04:58:45.708 --> 04:58:45.718 align:start position:0%
one of the amendment that it says would
 
04:58:47.868 --> 04:58:47.878 align:start position:0%
count on housing stability established
 
04:58:50.990 --> 04:58:51.000 align:start position:0%
maybe established is it the word uh made
 
04:58:54.530 --> 04:58:54.540 align:start position:0%
permanent expanded uh might be more
 
04:58:58.430 --> 04:58:58.440 align:start position:0%
accurate and uh certainly we were some
 
04:59:00.830 --> 04:59:00.840 align:start position:0%
of us you can speak for himself another
 
04:59:02.930 --> 04:59:02.940 align:start position:0%
member on this committee we were very
 
04:59:05.090 --> 04:59:05.100 align:start position:0%
impressed with
 
04:59:07.070 --> 04:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
um Representatives
 
04:59:07.080 --> 04:59:07.730 align:start position:0%
um Representatives
um

04:59:07.730 --> 04:59:07.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:11.090 --> 04:59:11.100 align:start position:0%
I'll shoot down for long last
 
04:59:14.810 --> 04:59:14.820 align:start position:0%
he was commending organizations that
 
04:59:17.030 --> 04:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
have boots on the ground who have a
 
04:59:19.970 --> 04:59:19.980 align:start position:0%
track record it's not just higher-ups
 
04:59:22.970 --> 04:59:22.980 align:start position:0%
planning things it was that maybe you
 
04:59:25.368 --> 04:59:25.378 align:start position:0%
could finish this conversation could I
 
04:59:28.690 --> 04:59:28.700 align:start position:0%
give my time to him
 
04:59:33.410 --> 04:59:33.420 align:start position:0%
sure go ahead all right um yeah I was I
 
04:59:35.628 --> 04:59:35.638 align:start position:0%
was impressed with the presentation that
 
04:59:38.090 --> 04:59:38.100 align:start position:0%
was made last week
 
04:59:40.030 --> 04:59:40.040 align:start position:0%
um and
 
04:59:44.570 --> 04:59:44.580 align:start position:0%
the the people that are part of this uh
 
04:59:46.670 --> 04:59:46.680 align:start position:0%
this house bill
 
04:59:49.070 --> 04:59:49.080 align:start position:0%
are people that are involved in the
 
04:59:51.288 --> 04:59:51.298 align:start position:0%
community and they're involved in their
 
04:59:54.708 --> 04:59:54.718 align:start position:0%
areas and so I think that uh the boots
 
04:59:57.170 --> 04:59:57.180 align:start position:0%
on the ground is
 
05:00:00.050 --> 05:00:00.060 align:start position:0%
um is just what we need uh you know to
 
05:00:05.030 --> 05:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
to representative uh salaries we need we
 
05:00:07.550 --> 05:00:07.560 align:start position:0%
don't need another person or another
 
05:00:09.288 --> 05:00:09.298 align:start position:0%
um bureaucratic
 
05:00:12.410 --> 05:00:12.420 align:start position:0%
committee that's actually uh telling us
 
05:00:15.590 --> 05:00:15.600 align:start position:0%
what what to do without having any kind
 
05:00:18.470 --> 05:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
of representation out on the streets so
 
05:00:21.110 --> 05:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
I I that's one reason why I like this
 
05:00:21.120 --> 05:00:23.948 align:start position:0%
I I that's one reason why I like this
bill

05:00:23.948 --> 05:00:23.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:26.590 --> 05:00:26.600 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
05:00:29.510 --> 05:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
point of information Mr who's Mr
 
05:00:32.690 --> 05:00:32.700 align:start position:0%
chairman you are recognized
 
05:00:35.628 --> 05:00:35.638 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm wondering if we're my
 
05:00:38.750 --> 05:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
understanding oh we were talking the
 
05:00:40.510 --> 05:00:40.520 align:start position:0%
bill has been amended
 
05:00:45.590 --> 05:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
so the the bill is now my understanding
 
05:00:47.510 --> 05:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
is that the
 
05:00:47.520 --> 05:00:48.230 align:start position:0%
is that the
um

05:00:48.230 --> 05:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:50.448 --> 05:00:50.458 align:start position:0%
Amendment replaces the bill in its
 
05:00:53.150 --> 05:00:53.160 align:start position:0%
entirety is that correct yes
 
05:00:53.160 --> 05:00:54.470 align:start position:0%
entirety is that correct yes
okay

05:00:54.470 --> 05:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:00:56.270 --> 05:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
um I I just wanted to be sure that we
 
05:00:58.970 --> 05:00:58.980 align:start position:0%
were all in the same place and and it is
 
05:01:02.750 --> 05:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
a for my further understanding that what
 
05:01:06.410 --> 05:01:06.420 align:start position:0%
this has done is taken an existing
 
05:01:09.708 --> 05:01:09.718 align:start position:0%
Council which was established by the
 
05:01:09.718 --> 05:01:10.670 align:start position:0%
Council which was established by the
governor

05:01:10.670 --> 05:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
governor
 
05:01:13.970 --> 05:01:13.980 align:start position:0%
and is now giving it the authority of
 
05:01:16.670 --> 05:01:16.680 align:start position:0%
Statute and the
 
05:01:19.250 --> 05:01:19.260 align:start position:0%
um blessing of the legislature and is
 
05:01:23.948 --> 05:01:23.958 align:start position:0%
putting a few more members on it and is
 
05:01:26.868 --> 05:01:26.878 align:start position:0%
directing it to address the homelessness
 
05:01:30.050 --> 05:01:30.060 align:start position:0%
issue specifically instead of just
 
05:01:32.510 --> 05:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
peripherally is that correct that is
 
05:01:39.170 --> 05:01:39.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:42.470 --> 05:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant
 
05:01:45.230 --> 05:01:45.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman again I think
 
05:01:47.810 --> 05:01:47.820 align:start position:0%
representative Weber kind of spoke to it
 
05:01:50.690 --> 05:01:50.700 align:start position:0%
but looking at the additional members
 
05:01:53.208 --> 05:01:53.218 align:start position:0%
that are on page two
 
05:01:57.288 --> 05:01:57.298 align:start position:0%
line 31 on those are the members I
 
05:02:00.350 --> 05:02:00.360 align:start position:0%
believe that the represent LeBlanc spoke
 
05:02:02.930 --> 05:02:02.940 align:start position:0%
to and the other people who addressed
 
05:02:05.150 --> 05:02:05.160 align:start position:0%
this committee were talking about boots
 
05:02:06.230 --> 05:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
on the ground that's where they're
 
05:02:07.730 --> 05:02:07.740 align:start position:0%
coming from from those membership is
 
05:02:12.610 --> 05:02:12.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:14.990 --> 05:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
for me the amendment is set up the
 
05:02:16.970 --> 05:02:16.980 align:start position:0%
initial section are the ones that were
 
05:02:18.830 --> 05:02:18.840 align:start position:0%
originally put in by the governor's
 
05:02:21.470 --> 05:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
order and then the second section is the
 
05:02:23.990 --> 05:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
ones that we are adding uh which are not
 
05:02:26.390 --> 05:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
duplicative of members in the first
 
05:02:26.400 --> 05:02:29.708 align:start position:0%
duplicative of members in the first
section

05:02:29.708 --> 05:02:29.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:32.570 --> 05:02:32.580 align:start position:0%
so those would start on page two align
 
05:02:36.890 --> 05:02:36.900 align:start position:0%
31. correct thank you
 
05:02:39.230 --> 05:02:39.240 align:start position:0%
so we so we are basically adding what I
 
05:02:41.208 --> 05:02:41.218 align:start position:0%
call boots on the ground people who are
 
05:02:43.190 --> 05:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
in the homeless
 
05:02:46.250 --> 05:02:46.260 align:start position:0%
Arena added if you will to the existing
 
05:02:46.260 --> 05:02:47.448 align:start position:0%
Arena added if you will to the existing
Council

05:02:47.448 --> 05:02:47.458 align:start position:0%
Council
 
05:02:50.890 --> 05:02:50.900 align:start position:0%
that's correct thank you
 
05:02:56.208 --> 05:02:56.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:03.288 --> 05:03:03.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:05.270 --> 05:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
your muted can
 
05:03:11.208 --> 05:03:11.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:11.218 --> 05:03:12.910 align:start position:0%
 
hello

05:03:12.910 --> 05:03:12.920 align:start position:0%
hello
 
05:03:17.750 --> 05:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
how's that am I I'm muted now hey am I
 
05:03:17.760 --> 05:03:19.330 align:start position:0%
how's that am I I'm muted now hey am I
unmuted

05:03:19.330 --> 05:03:19.340 align:start position:0%
unmuted
 
05:03:20.990 --> 05:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:03:22.550 --> 05:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
I was hoping I could speak to
 
05:03:25.010 --> 05:03:25.020 align:start position:0%
representative long we did get a I did
 
05:03:26.510 --> 05:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
get a message from the mayor of
 
05:03:28.730 --> 05:03:28.740 align:start position:0%
Manchester who's quite concerned about
 
05:03:30.650 --> 05:03:30.660 align:start position:0%
the original construction of this
 
05:03:34.190 --> 05:03:34.200 align:start position:0%
Committee of Housing and because it was
 
05:03:37.250 --> 05:03:37.260 align:start position:0%
really a the original committee as set
 
05:03:38.868 --> 05:03:38.878 align:start position:0%
up by the governor was really not
 
05:03:41.030 --> 05:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
looking at homelessness at all it was
 
05:03:43.070 --> 05:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
looking at Workforce housing and having
 
05:03:45.170 --> 05:03:45.180 align:start position:0%
affordable housing for people with
 
05:03:47.990 --> 05:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
business and opportunities expanded and
 
05:03:50.510 --> 05:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
very little attention being given to
 
05:03:52.670 --> 05:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
homelessness had a strong feeling it was
 
05:03:54.050 --> 05:03:54.060 align:start position:0%
going to be swept under and I think this
 
05:03:56.090 --> 05:03:56.100 align:start position:0%
is a particular concern in certain
 
05:03:58.730 --> 05:03:58.740 align:start position:0%
communities at least Manchester and
 
05:04:00.470 --> 05:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
Nashville are the big cities where
 
05:04:02.750 --> 05:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
they've become kind of a magnet the
 
05:04:04.788 --> 05:04:04.798 align:start position:0%
large numbers of homeless people and
 
05:04:07.788 --> 05:04:07.798 align:start position:0%
during the covid-19
 
05:04:07.798 --> 05:04:09.708 align:start position:0%
during the covid-19
um event

05:04:09.708 --> 05:04:09.718 align:start position:0%
um event
 
05:04:12.230 --> 05:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
you know the restrictions on the
 
05:04:14.090 --> 05:04:14.100 align:start position:0%
existing shelters and so forth it's
 
05:04:16.128 --> 05:04:16.138 align:start position:0%
becoming a gigantic problem and you've
 
05:04:17.810 --> 05:04:17.820 align:start position:0%
seen it in the papers with tent cities
 
05:04:20.090 --> 05:04:20.100 align:start position:0%
having to be broken up and so forth and
 
05:04:22.670 --> 05:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
so on and we would just I think
 
05:04:24.430 --> 05:04:24.440 align:start position:0%
everybody was concerned that this
 
05:04:27.350 --> 05:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
committee is originally set up
 
05:04:29.868 --> 05:04:29.878 align:start position:0%
it had people from mental health and
 
05:04:31.368 --> 05:04:31.378 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services but they were
 
05:04:33.650 --> 05:04:33.660 align:start position:0%
all really bureaucrats that do not have
 
05:04:35.570 --> 05:04:35.580 align:start position:0%
their feet in the ground to doing it
 
05:04:37.788 --> 05:04:37.798 align:start position:0%
it's expanded unfortunately I don't have
 
05:04:40.128 --> 05:04:40.138 align:start position:0%
a recent version of the bill so I don't
 
05:04:41.810 --> 05:04:41.820 align:start position:0%
have a complete list of where it goes
 
05:04:43.788 --> 05:04:43.798 align:start position:0%
but I do remember seeing it and that
 
05:04:45.830 --> 05:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
certainly is better I would feel a lot
 
05:04:47.810 --> 05:04:47.820 align:start position:0%
more comfortable about it if it's like
 
05:04:50.270 --> 05:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
Finance was divided into two separate
 
05:04:53.470 --> 05:04:53.480 align:start position:0%
divisions one on housing
 
05:04:56.030 --> 05:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
you know one on housing stability is
 
05:04:58.310 --> 05:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
they said before in Workforce housing
 
05:05:00.350 --> 05:05:00.360 align:start position:0%
and the other on homelessness it could
 
05:05:02.990 --> 05:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
also be one committee but to have two
 
05:05:05.150 --> 05:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
divisions and I'm terribly afraid the
 
05:05:06.890 --> 05:05:06.900 align:start position:0%
way it's constructed right now the issue
 
05:05:08.750 --> 05:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
of homelessness is going to be an
 
05:05:10.970 --> 05:05:10.980 align:start position:0%
afterthought and not much attention is
 
05:05:13.970 --> 05:05:13.980 align:start position:0%
paid and I see it as a gigantic problem
 
05:05:17.390 --> 05:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
here in Manchester I wish is do you know
 
05:05:18.708 --> 05:05:18.718 align:start position:0%
as the sponsor of the bill is
 
05:05:21.230 --> 05:05:21.240 align:start position:0%
representative along on the list to
 
05:05:23.868 --> 05:05:23.878 align:start position:0%
testify today or not this is an
 
05:05:27.050 --> 05:05:27.060 align:start position:0%
executive session but did he sign in to
 
05:05:30.948 --> 05:05:30.958 align:start position:0%
be president for the executive session
 
05:05:33.350 --> 05:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
I'd love to find out if anything has
 
05:05:35.750 --> 05:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
changed with the mayor and others I was
 
05:05:37.190 --> 05:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
hoping to see him at this noon meeting
 
05:05:39.350 --> 05:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
and I didn't get a chance to leave on
 
05:05:41.090 --> 05:05:41.100 align:start position:0%
time to do it
 
05:05:43.250 --> 05:05:43.260 align:start position:0%
um but I have real concerns about this
 
05:05:46.190 --> 05:05:46.200 align:start position:0%
the the this bill is going to do very
 
05:05:47.868 --> 05:05:47.878 align:start position:0%
little about that other side and I think
 
05:05:52.208 --> 05:05:52.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:55.128 --> 05:05:55.138 align:start position:0%
representative long is not on this
 
05:05:57.230 --> 05:05:57.240 align:start position:0%
meeting in any way
 
05:06:00.110 --> 05:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
I understand but he's titled at 10. I
 
05:06:02.270 --> 05:06:02.280 align:start position:0%
mean he can sit in his apartment he is
 
05:06:07.310 --> 05:06:07.320 align:start position:0%
but he hasn't yeah he hasn't thank you
 
05:06:11.448 --> 05:06:11.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:11.458 --> 05:06:13.010 align:start position:0%
 
yes

05:06:13.010 --> 05:06:13.020 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:06:16.730 --> 05:06:16.740 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman I think
 
05:06:18.350 --> 05:06:18.360 align:start position:0%
I would agree with some of the
 
05:06:20.208 --> 05:06:20.218 align:start position:0%
sentiments that people have about this
 
05:06:20.218 --> 05:06:21.230 align:start position:0%
sentiments that people have about this
being

05:06:21.230 --> 05:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
being
 
05:06:24.708 --> 05:06:24.718 align:start position:0%
um less than an ideal solution
 
05:06:24.718 --> 05:06:25.628 align:start position:0%
um less than an ideal solution
um

05:06:25.628 --> 05:06:25.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:29.390 --> 05:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
305. I think that the Council on housing
 
05:06:32.150 --> 05:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
instability as it will be set up if this
 
05:06:34.670 --> 05:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
passes we'll have
 
05:06:34.680 --> 05:06:36.948 align:start position:0%
passes we'll have
um

05:06:36.948 --> 05:06:36.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:41.448 --> 05:06:41.458 align:start position:0%
any tasks and many many people including
 
05:06:43.070 --> 05:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
um the
 
05:06:45.350 --> 05:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
um membership which will be heavily
 
05:06:47.628 --> 05:06:47.638 align:start position:0%
weighted in terms of government
 
05:06:47.638 --> 05:06:50.750 align:start position:0%
weighted in terms of government
um

05:06:50.750 --> 05:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:53.208 --> 05:06:53.218 align:start position:0%
someone used the word bureaucrats that's
 
05:06:55.128 --> 05:06:55.138 align:start position:0%
um maybe got a negative connotation but
 
05:06:58.310 --> 05:06:58.320 align:start position:0%
it it's weighted in terms of people in
 
05:07:00.050 --> 05:07:00.060 align:start position:0%
state departments
 
05:07:03.470 --> 05:07:03.480 align:start position:0%
so I think it's got like that it's got
 
05:07:09.070 --> 05:07:09.080 align:start position:0%
it's far from ideal but when it's like
 
05:07:11.390 --> 05:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
DHHS said that
 
05:07:13.850 --> 05:07:13.860 align:start position:0%
um testified against
 
05:07:17.810 --> 05:07:17.820 align:start position:0%
having uh how uh hopelessness Commission
 
05:07:19.670 --> 05:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
I guess I thought that the commission
 
05:07:22.788 --> 05:07:22.798 align:start position:0%
was doomed and that this
 
05:07:25.570 --> 05:07:25.580 align:start position:0%
um was a compromise would at least
 
05:07:29.390 --> 05:07:29.400 align:start position:0%
increase the membership and
 
05:07:32.150 --> 05:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
to include the people that were in
 
05:07:35.270 --> 05:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
representative Long's initial bill
 
05:07:37.850 --> 05:07:37.860 align:start position:0%
so I hope that
 
05:07:41.810 --> 05:07:41.820 align:start position:0%
um on the council they will take the
 
05:07:44.090 --> 05:07:44.100 align:start position:0%
initiative to
 
05:07:44.100 --> 05:07:44.990 align:start position:0%
initiative to
um

05:07:44.990 --> 05:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:47.390 --> 05:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
give way to the homelessness problem and
 
05:07:50.208 --> 05:07:50.218 align:start position:0%
maybe divide themselves into
 
05:07:50.218 --> 05:07:55.610 align:start position:0%
maybe divide themselves into
um subgroups

05:07:55.610 --> 05:07:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:58.910 --> 05:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
representative soloway uh thank you Mr
 
05:07:58.920 --> 05:08:00.050 align:start position:0%
representative soloway uh thank you Mr
chairman

05:08:00.050 --> 05:08:00.060 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
05:08:04.128 --> 05:08:04.138 align:start position:0%
um I would like to amplify on uh the
 
05:08:05.628 --> 05:08:05.638 align:start position:0%
representative from Manchester's
 
05:08:08.470 --> 05:08:08.480 align:start position:0%
comments and the representatives from
 
05:08:10.730 --> 05:08:10.740 align:start position:0%
both of which I think are very well
 
05:08:13.610 --> 05:08:13.620 align:start position:0%
taken however if you look at the
 
05:08:15.948 --> 05:08:15.958 align:start position:0%
construction of such commissions they
 
05:08:20.448 --> 05:08:20.458 align:start position:0%
have a decidedly Urban Focus here in New
 
05:08:23.510 --> 05:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we also have a rural
 
05:08:26.030 --> 05:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
homelessness problem which I think is
 
05:08:28.490 --> 05:08:28.500 align:start position:0%
not being addressed in the legislation
 
05:08:33.350 --> 05:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
if you go back to uh the book out of
 
05:08:36.230 --> 05:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
sight out of mind and you go through
 
05:08:39.110 --> 05:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
there's a also a documentary film that
 
05:08:40.550 --> 05:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
accompanies it
 
05:08:40.560 --> 05:08:41.208 align:start position:0%
accompanies it
um

05:08:41.208 --> 05:08:41.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:43.368 --> 05:08:43.378 align:start position:0%
if any of you have had the opportunity
 
05:08:46.850 --> 05:08:46.860 align:start position:0%
to drive down a dirt road in New
 
05:08:46.860 --> 05:08:47.750 align:start position:0%
to drive down a dirt road in New
Hampshire

05:08:47.750 --> 05:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:08:51.470 --> 05:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
and at the end of that road you find a
 
05:08:53.390 --> 05:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
foundation of a home
 
05:08:57.230 --> 05:08:57.240 align:start position:0%
with no home on top of it plywood boards
 
05:09:01.010 --> 05:09:01.020 align:start position:0%
across the top and people living in the
 
05:09:03.288 --> 05:09:03.298 align:start position:0%
basement of what was supposed to be a
 
05:09:06.530 --> 05:09:06.540 align:start position:0%
home if you drive down that dirt road
 
05:09:11.570 --> 05:09:11.580 align:start position:0%
and you find an old RV and there's
 
05:09:13.490 --> 05:09:13.500 align:start position:0%
people living in it through the winter
 
05:09:16.610 --> 05:09:16.620 align:start position:0%
if you find a tent camper with people
 
05:09:18.948 --> 05:09:18.958 align:start position:0%
and their kids trying to survive the
 
05:09:23.750 --> 05:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
winter those people are not addressed in
 
05:09:28.208 --> 05:09:28.218 align:start position:0%
a commission that has an urban Focus
 
05:09:31.070 --> 05:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
this problem might be better addressed
 
05:09:33.890 --> 05:09:33.900 align:start position:0%
just by having DHHS
 
05:09:37.670 --> 05:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
write a Consulting contract for people
 
05:09:39.830 --> 05:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
like professor vissing and
 
05:09:42.470 --> 05:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
representative De Lorenzo I think that
 
05:09:44.208 --> 05:09:44.218 align:start position:0%
we're creating
 
05:09:47.628 --> 05:09:47.638 align:start position:0%
yes a bureaucratic morass that's not
 
05:09:50.270 --> 05:09:50.280 align:start position:0%
going to give us a concise directive
 
05:09:50.280 --> 05:09:52.788 align:start position:0%
going to give us a concise directive
solution

05:09:52.788 --> 05:09:52.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:55.610 --> 05:09:55.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
05:09:59.750 --> 05:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:04.368 --> 05:10:04.378 align:start position:0%
I'm withdrew but partly it was more of a
 
05:10:06.670 --> 05:10:06.680 align:start position:0%
complaint there was so much
 
05:10:11.090 --> 05:10:11.100 align:start position:0%
just like somebody else's voices is
 
05:10:12.850 --> 05:10:12.860 align:start position:0%
being broadcast
 
05:10:15.110 --> 05:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
simultaneously and I can hear it right
 
05:10:17.690 --> 05:10:17.700 align:start position:0%
now so I don't know what you can do
 
05:10:20.570 --> 05:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
about it but it was more of a complaint
 
05:10:23.628 --> 05:10:23.638 align:start position:0%
that it's hard to hear yeah it's it's
 
05:10:25.310 --> 05:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
somebody has a something in the
 
05:10:26.930 --> 05:10:26.940 align:start position:0%
background can it often comes from you
 
05:10:28.430 --> 05:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
could you mute yourself and see if it
 
05:10:31.128 --> 05:10:31.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:31.138 --> 05:10:33.368 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:10:33.368 --> 05:10:33.378 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
05:10:38.448 --> 05:10:38.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:40.490 --> 05:10:40.500 align:start position:0%
anyone else with a hand up
 
05:10:42.670 --> 05:10:42.680 align:start position:0%
thanks Ken
 
05:10:48.708 --> 05:10:48.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:52.250 --> 05:10:52.260 align:start position:0%
I don't think he ever took it down
 
05:10:55.610 --> 05:10:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:57.788 --> 05:10:57.798 align:start position:0%
representative guy
 
05:11:00.470 --> 05:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I
 
05:11:03.170 --> 05:11:03.180 align:start position:0%
really am in question mode now because
 
05:11:05.270 --> 05:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
it seems like we're all in agreement
 
05:11:07.670 --> 05:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
that there's a serious housing problem
 
05:11:11.708 --> 05:11:11.718 align:start position:0%
in the state both Rural and in uh cities
 
05:11:14.810 --> 05:11:14.820 align:start position:0%
that needs to be addressed and we just
 
05:11:18.350 --> 05:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
haven't found a way that we think is the
 
05:11:20.868 --> 05:11:20.878 align:start position:0%
best way to put a group together
 
05:11:24.288 --> 05:11:24.298 align:start position:0%
my my real question is that there could
 
05:11:25.850 --> 05:11:25.860 align:start position:0%
be an appointment
 
05:11:27.890 --> 05:11:27.900 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that's called ad hocs
 
05:11:30.288 --> 05:11:30.298 align:start position:0%
but an appointment of people who are
 
05:11:33.708 --> 05:11:33.718 align:start position:0%
experienced which would be named in the
 
05:11:37.970 --> 05:11:37.980 align:start position:0%
bill in the representative lost bill and
 
05:11:40.070 --> 05:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
if more people have been mentioned who
 
05:11:43.128 --> 05:11:43.138 align:start position:0%
have professional who have a long track
 
05:11:45.830 --> 05:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
record of addressing homelessness
 
05:11:49.970 --> 05:11:49.980 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm so sorry that we are up against
 
05:11:52.250 --> 05:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
the deadline because it sounds like
 
05:11:54.530 --> 05:11:54.540 align:start position:0%
we're all concerned we're all aware we
 
05:11:56.930 --> 05:11:56.940 align:start position:0%
have great ideas and how to put them
 
05:11:59.690 --> 05:11:59.700 align:start position:0%
together do we have to pass a bill to do
 
05:12:03.708 --> 05:12:03.718 align:start position:0%
that I also have serious reservations as
 
05:12:06.470 --> 05:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
soon as these two groups of people were
 
05:12:09.410 --> 05:12:09.420 align:start position:0%
combined into one because their their
 
05:12:12.650 --> 05:12:12.660 align:start position:0%
concerns really are Divergent yes they
 
05:12:14.150 --> 05:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
all need housing
 
05:12:17.570 --> 05:12:17.580 align:start position:0%
but just getting housing doesn't solve
 
05:12:19.970 --> 05:12:19.980 align:start position:0%
you know how do you get housing to
 
05:12:22.250 --> 05:12:22.260 align:start position:0%
people who don't have money or have
 
05:12:25.010 --> 05:12:25.020 align:start position:0%
mental issues it's not the same as
 
05:12:27.230 --> 05:12:27.240 align:start position:0%
making affordable housing for people who
 
05:12:28.190 --> 05:12:28.200 align:start position:0%
are working
 
05:12:28.200 --> 05:12:29.810 align:start position:0%
are working
so

05:12:29.810 --> 05:12:29.820 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:12:32.350 --> 05:12:32.360 align:start position:0%
you know again I want us to do something
 
05:12:38.690 --> 05:12:38.700 align:start position:0%
but what is the best way is this amended
 
05:12:38.700 --> 05:12:40.448 align:start position:0%
but what is the best way is this amended
um

05:12:40.448 --> 05:12:40.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:44.750 --> 05:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
Council gonna do it or should we be
 
05:12:51.708 --> 05:12:51.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:56.330 --> 05:12:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:57.830 --> 05:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
yeah sure
 
05:13:00.590 --> 05:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
um there are there are mechanisms for
 
05:13:03.350 --> 05:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
example the person who representative
 
05:13:05.690 --> 05:13:05.700 align:start position:0%
saloway has mentioned could be appointed
 
05:13:10.730 --> 05:13:10.740 align:start position:0%
under uh V on page two line 27. uh could
 
05:13:12.110 --> 05:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
be appointed by the governor to this
 
05:13:14.090 --> 05:13:14.100 align:start position:0%
Council that would certainly be
 
05:13:17.030 --> 05:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
reasonable we also have the statement in
 
05:13:19.010 --> 05:13:19.020 align:start position:0%
here of three mayors of their designees
 
05:13:20.930 --> 05:13:20.940 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't say that it has to be a
 
05:13:23.810 --> 05:13:23.820 align:start position:0%
mayor mayor of a major city uh except
 
05:13:24.830 --> 05:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
for the smallest don't really have
 
05:13:26.750 --> 05:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
Mayors never mind so that may not work
 
05:13:28.730 --> 05:13:28.740 align:start position:0%
but I think we could get some of these
 
05:13:30.050 --> 05:13:30.060 align:start position:0%
other experts in with the current
 
05:13:31.910 --> 05:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
structure that is in the amendment that
 
05:13:36.350 --> 05:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:38.530 --> 05:13:38.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:13:42.650 --> 05:13:42.660 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to share ask anyone
 
05:13:50.270 --> 05:13:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:55.090 --> 05:13:55.100 align:start position:0%
okay seeing well I've seen one
 
05:13:57.350 --> 05:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
representative snow
 
05:13:59.390 --> 05:13:59.400 align:start position:0%
I'd just like to clarify my position I
 
05:14:00.948 --> 05:14:00.958 align:start position:0%
was sounding terribly negative about it
 
05:14:03.350 --> 05:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
and I guess in a lot of ways I am but
 
05:14:05.810 --> 05:14:05.820 align:start position:0%
I'm also saying I think the new bill
 
05:14:08.570 --> 05:14:08.580 align:start position:0%
with additional people is an improvement
 
05:14:12.350 --> 05:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
over the previous bill which to me would
 
05:14:14.270 --> 05:14:14.280 align:start position:0%
end up only talking about affordable
 
05:14:16.850 --> 05:14:16.860 align:start position:0%
housing for people moving in for
 
05:14:18.590 --> 05:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
business expansion here in New Hampshire
 
05:14:21.590 --> 05:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
and would ignore all the people and even
 
05:14:23.510 --> 05:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
among the homeless we have a big
 
05:14:25.730 --> 05:14:25.740 align:start position:0%
difference between what happens in
 
05:14:28.128 --> 05:14:28.138 align:start position:0%
cities like Manchester National perhaps
 
05:14:30.708 --> 05:14:30.718 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth and some of the other largest
 
05:14:33.410 --> 05:14:33.420 align:start position:0%
cities and Rural communities where you
 
05:14:35.628 --> 05:14:35.638 align:start position:0%
have people doubled up living in
 
05:14:38.330 --> 05:14:38.340 align:start position:0%
basements as he said in other places
 
05:14:40.970 --> 05:14:40.980 align:start position:0%
even among those two restricted groups
 
05:14:43.368 --> 05:14:43.378 align:start position:0%
there's very different problems that go
 
05:14:46.430 --> 05:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
on this is a mammoth task I understand
 
05:14:49.250 --> 05:14:49.260 align:start position:0%
that trying to get two commissions set
 
05:14:52.368 --> 05:14:52.378 align:start position:0%
up and that's why I suggested if is
 
05:14:54.230 --> 05:14:54.240 align:start position:0%
there any way of making sure that it's
 
05:14:56.448 --> 05:14:56.458 align:start position:0%
understood that we didn't just add all
 
05:14:58.390 --> 05:14:58.400 align:start position:0%
these additional people onto this
 
05:15:01.190 --> 05:15:01.200 align:start position:0%
committee on housing stability
 
05:15:01.200 --> 05:15:02.690 align:start position:0%
committee on housing stability
to

05:15:02.690 --> 05:15:02.700 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:15:06.470 --> 05:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
make it look more generic I'd like to
 
05:15:08.150 --> 05:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
make sure that those people are at it
 
05:15:10.310 --> 05:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
are really going to have the power and
 
05:15:11.990 --> 05:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
the ability to address it and I know how
 
05:15:13.788 --> 05:15:13.798 align:start position:0%
you go about doing that I don't pretend
 
05:15:14.690 --> 05:15:14.700 align:start position:0%
to know
 
05:15:16.970 --> 05:15:16.980 align:start position:0%
but I don't I think this bill well it's
 
05:15:19.190 --> 05:15:19.200 align:start position:0%
an improvement is clearly going to leave
 
05:15:23.150 --> 05:15:23.160 align:start position:0%
the the homeless population that
 
05:15:25.330 --> 05:15:25.340 align:start position:0%
in a big disadvantage
 
05:15:27.410 --> 05:15:27.420 align:start position:0%
representative snow
 
05:15:30.470 --> 05:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
um May I make a parallel from work I do
 
05:15:33.230 --> 05:15:33.240 align:start position:0%
with the deaf and hard of hearing we get
 
05:15:34.970 --> 05:15:34.980 align:start position:0%
something in place that we thought we
 
05:15:37.490 --> 05:15:37.500 align:start position:0%
would it would do something and it did
 
05:15:39.110 --> 05:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
but it was it was good but it wasn't
 
05:15:41.628 --> 05:15:41.638 align:start position:0%
what we had wanted so now I'm coming
 
05:15:46.070 --> 05:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
back with a second try and and I think
 
05:15:47.810 --> 05:15:47.820 align:start position:0%
we'll now wind up with two good things
 
05:15:51.170 --> 05:15:51.180 align:start position:0%
so if it's the case going forward over
 
05:15:52.910 --> 05:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
the next several months that it doesn't
 
05:15:55.730 --> 05:15:55.740 align:start position:0%
seem that the Council on housing
 
05:15:58.610 --> 05:15:58.620 align:start position:0%
stability really addresses what some of
 
05:16:01.730 --> 05:16:01.740 align:start position:0%
us have been looking at the rural poor
 
05:16:03.530 --> 05:16:03.540 align:start position:0%
and so on
 
05:16:06.770 --> 05:16:06.780 align:start position:0%
um I've got several good folks can work
 
05:16:12.890 --> 05:16:12.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:14.628 --> 05:16:14.638 align:start position:0%
yes that's I guess that's the best we
 
05:16:17.990 --> 05:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
can do I think I did I think so that's
 
05:16:21.830 --> 05:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
what I had to face representative Nelson
 
05:16:23.208 --> 05:16:23.218 align:start position:0%
that's true
 
05:16:25.128 --> 05:16:25.138 align:start position:0%
hand down
 
05:16:29.030 --> 05:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
that's true representative Marsh uh yes
 
05:16:31.730 --> 05:16:31.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh I wanted to point
 
05:16:33.410 --> 05:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
out the people that this amendment does
 
05:16:35.510 --> 05:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
not just yet and people should be
 
05:16:38.570 --> 05:16:38.580 align:start position:0%
existing Council and also expands upon
 
05:16:46.370 --> 05:16:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:46.380 --> 05:16:52.070 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:16:52.070 --> 05:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:52.080 --> 05:17:10.190 align:start position:0%
 
homelessness

05:17:10.190 --> 05:17:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:13.070 --> 05:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
so I think that clearly we will be
 
05:17:14.990 --> 05:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
directing the council to pay more
 
05:17:16.730 --> 05:17:16.740 align:start position:0%
attention to the homelessness then they
 
05:17:18.830 --> 05:17:18.840 align:start position:0%
are doing at this point in time which I
 
05:17:22.850 --> 05:17:22.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:24.948 --> 05:17:24.958 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
05:17:29.868 --> 05:17:29.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:31.970 --> 05:17:31.980 align:start position:0%
I was I was really going to say the same
 
05:17:33.590 --> 05:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
thing that representative Marsh just
 
05:17:34.850 --> 05:17:34.860 align:start position:0%
said it does
 
05:17:37.150 --> 05:17:37.160 align:start position:0%
um it does add the charge from
 
05:17:39.770 --> 05:17:39.780 align:start position:0%
representative Longs bill as well as
 
05:17:39.780 --> 05:17:41.150 align:start position:0%
representative Longs bill as well as
adding

05:17:41.150 --> 05:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
adding
 
05:17:43.430 --> 05:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
um all the extra people
 
05:17:45.350 --> 05:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
um how long does it take once again it's
 
05:17:47.270 --> 05:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
far from ideal because it's a lot of
 
05:17:50.208 --> 05:17:50.218 align:start position:0%
people and it's a lot of tasks but
 
05:17:54.410 --> 05:17:54.420 align:start position:0%
um it is inclusive of the tasks and
 
05:17:58.990 --> 05:17:59.000 align:start position:0%
membership from the original bill yeah
 
05:17:59.000 --> 05:18:02.090 align:start position:0%
membership from the original bill yeah

thank you Mr chairman I just have a
 
05:18:11.090 --> 05:18:11.100 align:start position:0%
question do you think
 
05:18:14.150 --> 05:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
um that any of these
 
05:18:16.670 --> 05:18:16.680 align:start position:0%
members any of these Representatives who
 
05:18:18.830 --> 05:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
will be on this board
 
05:18:21.530 --> 05:18:21.540 align:start position:0%
um will be coming to the table and
 
05:18:24.530 --> 05:18:24.540 align:start position:0%
bringing the principles of uh perhaps
 
05:18:24.540 --> 05:18:27.170 align:start position:0%
bringing the principles of uh perhaps
reducing

05:18:27.170 --> 05:18:27.180 align:start position:0%
reducing
 
05:18:29.750 --> 05:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
um regulations to allow the free market
 
05:18:32.948 --> 05:18:32.958 align:start position:0%
to help meet the needs of the homeless
 
05:18:37.788 --> 05:18:37.798 align:start position:0%
to help with housing stability Etc
 
05:18:37.798 --> 05:18:39.230 align:start position:0%
to help with housing stability Etc

05:18:56.868 --> 05:18:56.878 align:start position:0%
can you repeat the question
 
05:18:58.270 --> 05:18:58.280 align:start position:0%
so I'm seeing
 
05:19:01.430 --> 05:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
yeah sorry I'm seeing um you know all of
 
05:19:08.150 --> 05:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
these bureaus and groups and my instinct
 
05:19:09.890 --> 05:19:09.900 align:start position:0%
is telling me that what will come out of
 
05:19:12.708 --> 05:19:12.718 align:start position:0%
this is some
 
05:19:16.430 --> 05:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
first of all it's a very large board
 
05:19:18.770 --> 05:19:18.780 align:start position:0%
um or commission
 
05:19:18.780 --> 05:19:20.330 align:start position:0%
um or commission
um

05:19:20.330 --> 05:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:22.368 --> 05:19:22.378 align:start position:0%
so sorry
 
05:19:25.310 --> 05:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
I see I foresee that there's going to be
 
05:19:27.948 --> 05:19:27.958 align:start position:0%
some recommendations for you know
 
05:19:31.670 --> 05:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
centralized control policy
 
05:19:31.680 --> 05:19:32.390 align:start position:0%
centralized control policy
um

05:19:32.390 --> 05:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:34.430 --> 05:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
it's probably similar to the governor's
 
05:19:37.610 --> 05:19:37.620 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing policy that he wanted
 
05:19:40.368 --> 05:19:40.378 align:start position:0%
to put into place uh and I was just
 
05:19:43.430 --> 05:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
wondering if any of these
 
05:19:43.440 --> 05:19:44.350 align:start position:0%
wondering if any of these
um

05:19:44.350 --> 05:19:44.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:47.090 --> 05:19:47.100 align:start position:0%
designees or executive directors or
 
05:19:50.288 --> 05:19:50.298 align:start position:0%
Commissioners if any of these positions
 
05:19:55.010 --> 05:19:55.020 align:start position:0%
do you see them coming at this with some
 
05:19:58.190 --> 05:19:58.200 align:start position:0%
suggestions for how the free market
 
05:20:02.170 --> 05:20:02.180 align:start position:0%
or reducing current regulations on safe
 
05:20:05.708 --> 05:20:05.718 align:start position:0%
zoning or building
 
05:20:09.410 --> 05:20:09.420 align:start position:0%
to deal with housing instability
 
05:20:12.050 --> 05:20:12.060 align:start position:0%
do you see any of these members bringing
 
05:20:16.670 --> 05:20:16.680 align:start position:0%
that kind of information to the table
 
05:20:17.990 --> 05:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:20:18.000 --> 05:20:20.030 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

05:20:20.030 --> 05:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:20:22.910 --> 05:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
I have not I had not thought about it I
 
05:20:25.250 --> 05:20:25.260 align:start position:0%
had not thought about it in that way
 
05:20:28.010 --> 05:20:28.020 align:start position:0%
there is a it does call from a
 
05:20:29.810 --> 05:20:29.820 align:start position:0%
representative from the business
 
05:20:29.820 --> 05:20:32.990 align:start position:0%
representative from the business
community

05:20:32.990 --> 05:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:33.000 --> 05:20:36.890 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:20:36.890 --> 05:20:36.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:39.770 --> 05:20:39.780 align:start position:0%
and there are well there are in the
 
05:20:43.910 --> 05:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:45.830 --> 05:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
I'm looking through this as I'm talking
 
05:20:46.850 --> 05:20:46.860 align:start position:0%
to you
 
05:20:46.860 --> 05:20:53.530 align:start position:0%
to you
um

05:20:53.530 --> 05:20:53.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:56.090 --> 05:20:56.100 align:start position:0%
there is one specific particular
 
05:20:57.530 --> 05:20:57.540 align:start position:0%
representative from the business
 
05:20:59.510 --> 05:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
Community with an interest in affordable
 
05:20:59.520 --> 05:21:00.948 align:start position:0%
Community with an interest in affordable
housing

05:21:00.948 --> 05:21:00.958 align:start position:0%
housing
 
05:21:02.810 --> 05:21:02.820 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if that point of view
 
05:21:05.810 --> 05:21:05.820 align:start position:0%
would be to what extent that point of
 
05:21:07.250 --> 05:21:07.260 align:start position:0%
view would be
 
05:21:09.670 --> 05:21:09.680 align:start position:0%
um represented
 
05:21:13.850 --> 05:21:13.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:15.970 --> 05:21:15.980 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
05:21:17.930 --> 05:21:17.940 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
05:21:19.850 --> 05:21:19.860 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
05:21:22.490 --> 05:21:22.500 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately representative snow oh
 
05:21:24.890 --> 05:21:24.900 align:start position:0%
yes he's behind the the piece of paper
 
05:21:28.208 --> 05:21:28.218 align:start position:0%
uh I have three things one is a point of
 
05:21:31.730 --> 05:21:31.740 align:start position:0%
just how the committee Works
 
05:21:34.490 --> 05:21:34.500 align:start position:0%
um it appears to me and I will ask this
 
05:21:37.730 --> 05:21:37.740 align:start position:0%
through the chair it appears to me that
 
05:21:41.690 --> 05:21:41.700 align:start position:0%
when representative snow is muted we do
 
05:21:45.110 --> 05:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
not get the voice in the background uh
 
05:21:48.470 --> 05:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
so I I am wondering if the chair would
 
05:21:51.650 --> 05:21:51.660 align:start position:0%
ask representative snow to mute himself
 
05:21:54.948 --> 05:21:54.958 align:start position:0%
when he is not speaking because we're
 
05:21:56.930 --> 05:21:56.940 align:start position:0%
getting this is a follow-up to what
 
05:21:59.150 --> 05:21:59.160 align:start position:0%
representative McKay said we're getting
 
05:22:01.448 --> 05:22:01.458 align:start position:0%
a huge amount of somebody else's voice
 
05:22:03.948 --> 05:22:03.958 align:start position:0%
and when you're muted we don't hear it
 
05:22:06.230 --> 05:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
but or I don't hear it but when you're
 
05:22:10.070 --> 05:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
not muted uh there is a noise coming in
 
05:22:13.368 --> 05:22:13.378 align:start position:0%
the background so most of us mute our
 
05:22:15.230 --> 05:22:15.240 align:start position:0%
computers when we're not directly
 
05:22:19.250 --> 05:22:19.260 align:start position:0%
speaking and that helps thank you so
 
05:22:23.270 --> 05:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
that's I'm number one item number two to
 
05:22:27.230 --> 05:22:27.240 align:start position:0%
respond to representative Cushman uh I
 
05:22:31.330 --> 05:22:31.340 align:start position:0%
see as members of the original uh group
 
05:22:34.128 --> 05:22:34.138 align:start position:0%
uh somebody from the Department of
 
05:22:36.470 --> 05:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
Business and economic Affairs and they
 
05:22:39.350 --> 05:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
may or may not have an interest in free
 
05:22:41.990 --> 05:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
market economics depending on who
 
05:22:43.610 --> 05:22:43.620 align:start position:0%
appointed them and what their background
 
05:22:47.930 --> 05:22:47.940 align:start position:0%
is but I also see a representative of
 
05:22:49.850 --> 05:22:49.860 align:start position:0%
the landlords Association a
 
05:22:51.170 --> 05:22:51.180 align:start position:0%
representative of the New Hampshire
 
05:22:54.530 --> 05:22:54.540 align:start position:0%
Builders Association
 
05:22:58.150 --> 05:22:58.160 align:start position:0%
um local providers of Housing Services
 
05:23:02.330 --> 05:23:02.340 align:start position:0%
so and a County Economic Development
 
05:23:05.810 --> 05:23:05.820 align:start position:0%
Council so it seems to me that there
 
05:23:08.030 --> 05:23:08.040 align:start position:0%
isn't a minimum and opportunity for
 
05:23:11.390 --> 05:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
those voices to be heard although not
 
05:23:14.208 --> 05:23:14.218 align:start position:0%
being in charge of appointing them I I
 
05:23:17.030 --> 05:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
can't make any promises but I think I
 
05:23:19.010 --> 05:23:19.020 align:start position:0%
think that there is a fair amount of
 
05:23:22.610 --> 05:23:22.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:25.670 --> 05:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative gay
 
05:23:28.250 --> 05:23:28.260 align:start position:0%
well I've come up with the sort of sort
 
05:23:31.550 --> 05:23:31.560 align:start position:0%
of a proposal one is that we pass the
 
05:23:31.560 --> 05:23:32.510 align:start position:0%
of a proposal one is that we pass the
amendment

05:23:32.510 --> 05:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:23:35.150 --> 05:23:35.160 align:start position:0%
oh with all this humongous group of
 
05:23:35.160 --> 05:23:36.110 align:start position:0%
oh with all this humongous group of
people

05:23:36.110 --> 05:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
people
 
05:23:39.890 --> 05:23:39.900 align:start position:0%
and that we make the suggestion to the
 
05:23:42.288 --> 05:23:42.298 align:start position:0%
people who are boots on the ground
 
05:23:45.110 --> 05:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
but they form their own
 
05:23:45.120 --> 05:23:46.730 align:start position:0%
but they form their own
committee

05:23:46.730 --> 05:23:46.740 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:23:48.650 --> 05:23:48.660 align:start position:0%
so that they can come up with the
 
05:23:52.788 --> 05:23:52.798 align:start position:0%
request things that they need money for
 
05:23:56.208 --> 05:23:56.218 align:start position:0%
things that they need approval for
 
05:23:58.670 --> 05:23:58.680 align:start position:0%
and present them it can be people who
 
05:24:01.070 --> 05:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
are on this you know who are proposed to
 
05:24:04.490 --> 05:24:04.500 align:start position:0%
be on this list on this committee but
 
05:24:06.590 --> 05:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
they can meet separately whether they're
 
05:24:08.868 --> 05:24:08.878 align:start position:0%
ordained to meet separately or which
 
05:24:11.330 --> 05:24:11.340 align:start position:0%
they just do on their own but then they
 
05:24:13.190 --> 05:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
come back to this truth and say this is
 
05:24:14.628 --> 05:24:14.638 align:start position:0%
what we need
 
05:24:17.150 --> 05:24:17.160 align:start position:0%
and so that then they have a big group
 
05:24:20.030 --> 05:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
of people who can advocate for them I am
 
05:24:21.948 --> 05:24:21.958 align:start position:0%
very concerned that if that doesn't
 
05:24:24.530 --> 05:24:24.540 align:start position:0%
happen when you have the commissioner of
 
05:24:26.270 --> 05:24:26.280 align:start position:0%
this and the head of this and the
 
05:24:27.830 --> 05:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
director of this
 
05:24:29.810 --> 05:24:29.820 align:start position:0%
I don't think that's going to be real
 
05:24:32.810 --> 05:24:32.820 align:start position:0%
effective they can vote on things but I
 
05:24:34.010 --> 05:24:34.020 align:start position:0%
don't think they're going to really be
 
05:24:36.650 --> 05:24:36.660 align:start position:0%
directing the actual boots on the ground
 
05:24:39.830 --> 05:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
work but maybe if they were a clearing
 
05:24:41.990 --> 05:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
house and an approval and an advocacy
 
05:24:45.650 --> 05:24:45.660 align:start position:0%
group then they might really lend their
 
05:24:48.288 --> 05:24:48.298 align:start position:0%
weight to making some things happen
 
05:24:48.298 --> 05:25:01.448 align:start position:0%
weight to making some things happen
foreign

05:25:01.448 --> 05:25:01.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:04.850 --> 05:25:04.860 align:start position:0%
representative snow go ahead yeah I I do
 
05:25:06.708 --> 05:25:06.718 align:start position:0%
want to apologize unfortunately I do
 
05:25:08.510 --> 05:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
believe I was at fault for that my wife
 
05:25:11.390 --> 05:25:11.400 align:start position:0%
had to take a phone call in a room down
 
05:25:13.550 --> 05:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
the hall and I she was trying to be very
 
05:25:14.990 --> 05:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
quiet but we're not successfully but
 
05:25:17.390 --> 05:25:17.400 align:start position:0%
I'll be very conscientious about muting
 
05:25:19.190 --> 05:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
when we can't this is a small apartment
 
05:25:22.250 --> 05:25:22.260 align:start position:0%
so uh but I'll be more careful in the
 
05:25:24.770 --> 05:25:24.780 align:start position:0%
future and secondly what I said when I
 
05:25:26.570 --> 05:25:26.580 align:start position:0%
was talking was very much the same as
 
05:25:29.628 --> 05:25:29.638 align:start position:0%
what uh representative it was a Cushman
 
05:25:31.788 --> 05:25:31.798 align:start position:0%
that just spoke that's what I was
 
05:25:33.708 --> 05:25:33.718 align:start position:0%
thinking if we could get this committee
 
05:25:35.868 --> 05:25:35.878 align:start position:0%
to operate the way Finance does into
 
05:25:38.390 --> 05:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
divisions where they work in divisions
 
05:25:40.010 --> 05:25:40.020 align:start position:0%
but then they have to come together as a
 
05:25:40.910 --> 05:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
whole committee to make their
 
05:25:44.530 --> 05:25:44.540 align:start position:0%
recommendations and there'd be some
 
05:25:47.448 --> 05:25:47.458 align:start position:0%
agreement that both sides would be
 
05:25:49.190 --> 05:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
represented in the final recommendations
 
05:25:50.990 --> 05:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
that would seem to work better I don't
 
05:25:52.010 --> 05:25:52.020 align:start position:0%
know whether you have to put that in the
 
05:25:54.170 --> 05:25:54.180 align:start position:0%
bill it does seem to me looking at the
 
05:25:56.628 --> 05:25:56.638 align:start position:0%
list that there's enough strong-minded
 
05:26:00.170 --> 05:26:00.180 align:start position:0%
people who of the group with boots on
 
05:26:01.670 --> 05:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
the ground that they're going to exist
 
05:26:04.368 --> 05:26:04.378 align:start position:0%
in this anyway Pat long doesn't sit
 
05:26:07.430 --> 05:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
quietly for anyone so I think he there's
 
05:26:10.430 --> 05:26:10.440 align:start position:0%
no concern about that but and I think on
 
05:26:11.628 --> 05:26:11.638 align:start position:0%
the other side we have a lot of
 
05:26:13.610 --> 05:26:13.620 align:start position:0%
high-ranking officials
 
05:26:15.590 --> 05:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
that are on the other side so I think
 
05:26:17.868 --> 05:26:17.878 align:start position:0%
the more I think about this it would
 
05:26:20.750 --> 05:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
work but I think we need to try to
 
05:26:22.850 --> 05:26:22.860 align:start position:0%
move people in the direction of seeing
 
05:26:24.708 --> 05:26:24.718 align:start position:0%
it as being two separate subcommittees
 
05:26:27.110 --> 05:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
that then come together and operate we
 
05:26:28.610 --> 05:26:28.620 align:start position:0%
did that with this committee last year
 
05:26:30.770 --> 05:26:30.780 align:start position:0%
Jim McKay and I added up a separate
 
05:26:32.470 --> 05:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
group of mental health substance abuse
 
05:26:37.430 --> 05:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
in marijuana and the other the remaining
 
05:26:38.930 --> 05:26:38.940 align:start position:0%
members did together and then we all
 
05:26:41.570 --> 05:26:41.580 align:start position:0%
came together in executive session to
 
05:26:43.610 --> 05:26:43.620 align:start position:0%
finalize it and I think that worked out
 
05:26:45.890 --> 05:26:45.900 align:start position:0%
reasonably well and if we could get this
 
05:26:47.810 --> 05:26:47.820 align:start position:0%
group to operate in very much the same
 
05:26:51.350 --> 05:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
way I think we have a better chance of
 
05:26:53.628 --> 05:26:53.638 align:start position:0%
not leaving the homeless
 
05:26:58.670 --> 05:26:58.680 align:start position:0%
way behind sorry and
 
05:27:01.670 --> 05:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
um if you could uh mute please and now
 
05:27:03.650 --> 05:27:03.660 align:start position:0%
representative knurk
 
05:27:05.628 --> 05:27:05.638 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um I'd just like to
 
05:27:09.590 --> 05:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
point out that on page 3 line 10 it says
 
05:27:11.628 --> 05:27:11.638 align:start position:0%
the council may form subcommittees as
 
05:27:13.970 --> 05:27:13.980 align:start position:0%
necessary in the course of its work so
 
05:27:16.788 --> 05:27:16.798 align:start position:0%
that uh ability is there to develop a
 
05:27:18.530 --> 05:27:18.540 align:start position:0%
subcommittee who might very explicitly
 
05:27:20.090 --> 05:27:20.100 align:start position:0%
work on the homelessness questions
 
05:27:22.610 --> 05:27:22.620 align:start position:0%
separately and I would think that would
 
05:27:24.770 --> 05:27:24.780 align:start position:0%
be likely and and also in response to
 
05:27:26.930 --> 05:27:26.940 align:start position:0%
representative cushman's comment one of
 
05:27:28.128 --> 05:27:28.138 align:start position:0%
the other things she commented on was
 
05:27:30.590 --> 05:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
zoning and a lot of the homeless
 
05:27:33.530 --> 05:27:33.540 align:start position:0%
organizations uh particularly the New
 
05:27:34.930 --> 05:27:34.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Coalition and homelessness
 
05:27:38.510 --> 05:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
they also have often um addressed the
 
05:27:40.490 --> 05:27:40.500 align:start position:0%
question of zoning and it's and then
 
05:27:42.708 --> 05:27:42.718 align:start position:0%
particularly the over 55 restrictions
 
05:27:45.110 --> 05:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
and you know large lot restrictions on
 
05:27:47.448 --> 05:27:47.458 align:start position:0%
how that interferes with housing
 
05:27:49.250 --> 05:27:49.260 align:start position:0%
availability which trickles down to
 
05:27:51.530 --> 05:27:51.540 align:start position:0%
interfere with uh to cause homelessness
 
05:27:53.448 --> 05:27:53.458 align:start position:0%
so I think that would be addressed as
 
05:27:57.770 --> 05:27:57.780 align:start position:0%
well on this Commission thank you
 
05:28:01.310 --> 05:28:01.320 align:start position:0%
anyone else if you're representative
 
05:28:01.320 --> 05:28:02.868 align:start position:0%
anyone else if you're representative
Shapiro

05:28:02.868 --> 05:28:02.878 align:start position:0%
Shapiro
 
05:28:05.208 --> 05:28:05.218 align:start position:0%
yes I think there's a lot of
 
05:28:07.910 --> 05:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
um understandably there's a lot of angst
 
05:28:11.330 --> 05:28:11.340 align:start position:0%
about whether this um idea of combining
 
05:28:13.368 --> 05:28:13.378 align:start position:0%
these two things will actually work or
 
05:28:15.530 --> 05:28:15.540 align:start position:0%
not and I understand that I think that
 
05:28:19.550 --> 05:28:19.560 align:start position:0%
that's um understandable I share that
 
05:28:21.890 --> 05:28:21.900 align:start position:0%
um on the other hand
 
05:28:24.410 --> 05:28:24.420 align:start position:0%
today we only have the power of passing
 
05:28:26.448 --> 05:28:26.458 align:start position:0%
this bill as amended or not passing it
 
05:28:28.610 --> 05:28:28.620 align:start position:0%
as amended unless we're going to recess
 
05:28:31.850 --> 05:28:31.860 align:start position:0%
and get in another amendment so I think
 
05:28:31.860 --> 05:28:33.010 align:start position:0%
and get in another amendment so I think
another

05:28:33.010 --> 05:28:33.020 align:start position:0%
another
 
05:28:35.750 --> 05:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
possibility is those people who really
 
05:28:37.910 --> 05:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
are concerned about this being too many
 
05:28:40.670 --> 05:28:40.680 align:start position:0%
members or not focused enough on
 
05:28:43.490 --> 05:28:43.500 align:start position:0%
homelessness make it their business to
 
05:28:45.650 --> 05:28:45.660 align:start position:0%
be in touch with people who serve on
 
05:28:48.288 --> 05:28:48.298 align:start position:0%
this Council
 
05:28:52.250 --> 05:28:52.260 align:start position:0%
um and come back in uh in a year if
 
05:28:54.410 --> 05:28:54.420 align:start position:0%
there are real problems with
 
05:28:56.030 --> 05:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
um a new bill that would solve those
 
05:28:56.040 --> 05:28:57.590 align:start position:0%
um a new bill that would solve those
problems

05:28:57.590 --> 05:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
problems
 
05:28:59.750 --> 05:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
but for today I think we can only pass
 
05:29:06.470 --> 05:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:15.970 --> 05:29:15.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:18.230 --> 05:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
I'm in the middle of a middle to
 
05:29:20.868 --> 05:29:20.878 align:start position:0%
upstairs that I have to finish up right
 
05:29:20.878 --> 05:29:21.948 align:start position:0%
upstairs that I have to finish up right
now

05:29:21.948 --> 05:29:21.958 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:29:21.958 --> 05:29:22.910 align:start position:0%
now
um

05:29:22.910 --> 05:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:25.340 --> 05:29:25.350 align:start position:0%
so hang in there for a second
 
05:29:25.350 --> 05:29:31.628 align:start position:0%
so hang in there for a second

and
 
05:35:34.490 --> 05:35:34.500 align:start position:0%
um it it really is admirable the job
 
05:35:37.310 --> 05:35:37.320 align:start position:0%
you're doing we appreciate it yes but
 
05:35:39.910 --> 05:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
the chair has quite a job
 
05:35:43.390 --> 05:35:43.400 align:start position:0%
proofreading all my stuff
 
05:35:47.448 --> 05:35:47.458 align:start position:0%
I had to read it I had to read a copy of
 
05:35:49.850 --> 05:35:49.860 align:start position:0%
the Chairman's speech this morning that
 
05:35:52.610 --> 05:35:52.620 align:start position:0%
was not my original my original had
 
05:35:55.788 --> 05:35:55.798 align:start position:0%
unsplit infinitives where there were
 
05:35:57.770 --> 05:35:57.780 align:start position:0%
split infinitives in the original I had
 
05:36:00.110 --> 05:36:00.120 align:start position:0%
to do it that's why I was a stumbled and
 
05:36:02.628 --> 05:36:02.638 align:start position:0%
throat and so I will try to go back to
 
05:36:04.788 --> 05:36:04.798 align:start position:0%
the more edited version next time other
 
05:36:06.230 --> 05:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
people don't know what a split is
 
05:36:09.110 --> 05:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
benefits okay we should form a study
 
05:36:11.448 --> 05:36:11.458 align:start position:0%
group on dangling participles but
 
05:36:14.270 --> 05:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
infinitives and proper reference and
 
05:36:17.208 --> 05:36:17.218 align:start position:0%
representative Weber I just I'm sure
 
05:36:18.948 --> 05:36:18.958 align:start position:0%
you're thinking of your third and fifth
 
05:36:21.590 --> 05:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
grade teacher I I am indeed but I will
 
05:36:23.810 --> 05:36:23.820 align:start position:0%
decline to be on that committee because
 
05:36:27.110 --> 05:36:27.120 align:start position:0%
as you all know my ability to proofread
 
05:36:30.110 --> 05:36:30.120 align:start position:0%
particularly my own stuff is not good
 
05:36:30.120 --> 05:36:32.150 align:start position:0%
particularly my own stuff is not good
so

05:36:32.150 --> 05:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:36:32.160 --> 05:36:35.690 align:start position:0%
so
well

05:36:35.690 --> 05:36:35.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:37.910 --> 05:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
I was very grateful in a couple of the
 
05:36:40.550 --> 05:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
books I wrote 20 years ago that
 
05:36:43.670 --> 05:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
I had is my external editor from the
 
05:36:46.190 --> 05:36:46.200 align:start position:0%
Publishing House a husband and wife team
 
05:36:49.128 --> 05:36:49.138 align:start position:0%
who would ghost written almost 100 books
 
05:36:52.070 --> 05:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
and anything I learned about writing I
 
05:36:53.810 --> 05:36:53.820 align:start position:0%
learned from them
 
05:36:56.270 --> 05:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
I highly recommend
 
05:36:56.280 --> 05:36:57.470 align:start position:0%
I highly recommend
um

05:36:57.470 --> 05:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:37:01.368 --> 05:37:01.378 align:start position:0%
um EB White's uh essay about William
 
05:37:01.378 --> 05:37:03.010 align:start position:0%
um EB White's uh essay about William
strunk's

05:37:03.010 --> 05:37:03.020 align:start position:0%
strunk's
 
05:37:05.570 --> 05:37:05.580 align:start position:0%
elements of style
 
05:37:09.530 --> 05:37:09.540 align:start position:0%
but the the Y EB white essay about omit
 
05:37:12.410 --> 05:37:12.420 align:start position:0%
needless words and then because he had
 
05:37:14.030 --> 05:37:14.040 align:start position:0%
omitted the needless words he said
 
05:37:16.850 --> 05:37:16.860 align:start position:0%
everything three times so in class he
 
05:37:18.590 --> 05:37:18.600 align:start position:0%
would go in and say omit needless words
 
05:37:23.030 --> 05:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:25.070 --> 05:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
um the worst kinds of redundancy is
 
05:37:28.460 --> 05:37:28.470 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:28.470 --> 05:37:32.810 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:37:32.810 --> 05:37:32.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:35.990 --> 05:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
it's a redundant tautology
 
05:37:37.910 --> 05:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
and representative Nutter Robin can
 
05:37:39.590 --> 05:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
actually locate the books in their
 
05:37:48.610 --> 05:37:48.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:52.128 --> 05:37:52.138 align:start position:0%
a rabbi friend of mine his favorite joke
 
05:37:55.640 --> 05:37:55.650 align:start position:0%

[Music]

I thought it was hilarious
 
05:38:02.330 --> 05:38:02.340 align:start position:0%
a thesaurus being the book of other
 
05:38:04.730 --> 05:38:04.740 align:start position:0%

um
 
05:43:20.090 --> 05:43:20.100 align:start position:0%
following up on this on the bill in our
 
05:43:22.250 --> 05:43:22.260 align:start position:0%
discussion one of the pieces I added
 
05:43:25.010 --> 05:43:25.020 align:start position:0%
it's a paragraph F which is on the
 
05:43:27.650 --> 05:43:27.660 align:start position:0%
bottom of the amendment which was to
 
05:43:30.770 --> 05:43:30.780 align:start position:0%
charge the secretary of state with
 
05:43:34.010 --> 05:43:34.020 align:start position:0%
creating the form that's needed to
 
05:43:37.610 --> 05:43:37.620 align:start position:0%
to go along with the application
 
05:43:41.270 --> 05:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
for gender change on the birth record
 
05:43:43.788 --> 05:43:43.798 align:start position:0%
um the one that's been overdue since
 
05:43:47.410 --> 05:43:47.420 align:start position:0%
2005 to essentially Define the process
 
05:43:50.330 --> 05:43:50.340 align:start position:0%
and the information required to make it
 
05:43:50.340 --> 05:43:52.490 align:start position:0%
and the information required to make it
reality

05:43:52.490 --> 05:43:52.500 align:start position:0%
reality
 
05:43:52.500 --> 05:43:53.628 align:start position:0%
reality
um

05:43:53.628 --> 05:43:53.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:43:56.270 --> 05:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
I I have also based based on
 
05:43:58.548 --> 05:43:58.558 align:start position:0%
conversations with others
 
05:44:02.510 --> 05:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
I have changed the requirement
 
05:44:02.520 --> 05:44:04.128 align:start position:0%
I have changed the requirement
for

05:44:04.128 --> 05:44:04.138 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:44:07.730 --> 05:44:07.740 align:start position:0%
when the information is submitted to the
 
05:44:09.048 --> 05:44:09.058 align:start position:0%
clerk's office
 
05:44:11.090 --> 05:44:11.100 align:start position:0%
that it should be sent to the Vital
 
05:44:13.730 --> 05:44:13.740 align:start position:0%
Records Office and
 
05:44:17.570 --> 05:44:17.580 align:start position:0%
and then the original birth certificate
 
05:44:20.448 --> 05:44:20.458 align:start position:0%
shall be retained in its original form
 
05:44:24.230 --> 05:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
and a copy will be issued without a
 
05:44:26.990 --> 05:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
marginal note
 
05:44:29.510 --> 05:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
um and that's for a couple of reasons
 
05:44:31.430 --> 05:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
first off one of the reasons that
 
05:44:34.070 --> 05:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
individual comes forward to request a
 
05:44:37.190 --> 05:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
new birth certificate is to not be
 
05:44:39.610 --> 05:44:39.620 align:start position:0%
called out for having
 
05:44:42.948 --> 05:44:42.958 align:start position:0%
a sex or gender change
 
05:44:44.930 --> 05:44:44.940 align:start position:0%
and to put it in a marginal note is
 
05:44:48.590 --> 05:44:48.600 align:start position:0%
pulling it out and by doing so we might
 
05:44:52.070 --> 05:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
actually be in the situation where that
 
05:44:54.110 --> 05:44:54.120 align:start position:0%
person is being discriminated against by
 
05:44:56.330 --> 05:44:56.340 align:start position:0%
providing that information
 
05:44:58.310 --> 05:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
or providing that information in a
 
05:45:00.830 --> 05:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
printed form on their birth certificate
 
05:45:04.190 --> 05:45:04.200 align:start position:0%
so I have changed
 
05:45:04.200 --> 05:45:05.330 align:start position:0%
so I have changed
um

05:45:05.330 --> 05:45:05.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:07.670 --> 05:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
05:45:16.310 --> 05:45:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:22.430 --> 05:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:28.850 --> 05:45:28.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:31.430 --> 05:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
part of the sentence indicating that the
 
05:45:33.708 --> 05:45:33.718 align:start position:0%
record has been amended in accordance
 
05:45:37.010 --> 05:45:37.020 align:start position:0%
with this paragraph essentially it's to
 
05:45:39.288 --> 05:45:39.298 align:start position:0%
the new birth record
 
05:45:44.150 --> 05:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:46.368 --> 05:45:46.378 align:start position:0%
then the birth record shall reflect the
 
05:45:51.170 --> 05:45:51.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:53.690 --> 05:45:53.700 align:start position:0%
Please be aware this is really doesn't
 
05:45:53.700 --> 05:45:55.190 align:start position:0%
Please be aware this is really doesn't
change

05:45:55.190 --> 05:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
change
 
05:45:58.490 --> 05:45:58.500 align:start position:0%
the original Statue What's Done in the
 
05:45:59.990 --> 05:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
original Statue
 
05:46:02.350 --> 05:46:02.360 align:start position:0%
in RSA
 
05:46:07.788 --> 05:46:07.798 align:start position:0%
5-c colon 87 comma Roman Nero five
 
05:46:09.830 --> 05:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
because this is what we actually do
 
05:46:11.990 --> 05:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
there is no marginal note
 
05:46:13.548 --> 05:46:13.558 align:start position:0%
on the on
 
05:46:15.890 --> 05:46:15.900 align:start position:0%
birth record that's issued then there
 
05:46:17.628 --> 05:46:17.638 align:start position:0%
will not be a marginal note on the one
 
05:46:20.868 --> 05:46:20.878 align:start position:0%
that's issued now the Secretary of
 
05:46:23.150 --> 05:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
State's Vital Records Office told me
 
05:46:25.010 --> 05:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
that this is what needed to be added to
 
05:46:27.230 --> 05:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
the paragraph to be consistent with the
 
05:46:29.650 --> 05:46:29.660 align:start position:0%
current statute
 
05:46:32.868 --> 05:46:32.878 align:start position:0%
and and that the um the original record
 
05:46:34.548 --> 05:46:34.558 align:start position:0%
birth record that people have been
 
05:46:36.830 --> 05:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
concerned about will be retained in its
 
05:46:39.470 --> 05:46:39.480 align:start position:0%
original format
 
05:46:42.288 --> 05:46:42.298 align:start position:0%
and that um instead of trying to figure
 
05:46:44.810 --> 05:46:44.820 align:start position:0%
out which multiple groups could produce
 
05:46:46.670 --> 05:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
an application for this we're just gonna
 
05:46:49.250 --> 05:46:49.260 align:start position:0%
toss it over to the Secretary of State's
 
05:46:50.510 --> 05:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
office and said you have the
 
05:46:53.510 --> 05:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility to do this
 
05:46:56.390 --> 05:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
um I I I did go out to the Secretary of
 
05:46:59.208 --> 05:46:59.218 align:start position:0%
State's website and they don't have any
 
05:47:01.010 --> 05:47:01.020 align:start position:0%
information about being able to change
 
05:47:03.048 --> 05:47:03.058 align:start position:0%
the record but the statute still does
 
05:47:07.730 --> 05:47:07.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:11.868 --> 05:47:11.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:14.330 --> 05:47:14.340 align:start position:0%

I likewise must have had my hand up from
 
05:48:03.708 --> 05:48:03.718 align:start position:0%
something previous
 
05:48:07.128 --> 05:48:07.138 align:start position:0%
uh okay Mr chairman do we need a second
 
05:48:09.770 --> 05:48:09.780 align:start position:0%
for the amendment
 
05:48:11.628 --> 05:48:11.638 align:start position:0%
yes we did
 
05:48:13.490 --> 05:48:13.500 align:start position:0%
we have it already is that correct
 
05:48:16.190 --> 05:48:16.200 align:start position:0%
that's correct representative Canon move
 
05:48:18.948 --> 05:48:18.958 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant seconded the
 
05:48:20.330 --> 05:48:20.340 align:start position:0%
chair and up calls representative
 
05:48:20.340 --> 05:48:21.770 align:start position:0%
chair and up calls representative
Alexander

05:48:21.770 --> 05:48:21.780 align:start position:0%
Alexander
 
05:48:23.330 --> 05:48:23.340 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair and my question is
 
05:48:25.788 --> 05:48:25.798 align:start position:0%
for the um Frank sponsor of the bill
 
05:48:27.410 --> 05:48:27.420 align:start position:0%
um I know it's just the amendment by yes
 
05:48:29.690 --> 05:48:29.700 align:start position:0%
my confusion is
 
05:48:32.690 --> 05:48:32.700 align:start position:0%
um the analysis of the bill talks about
 
05:48:36.170 --> 05:48:36.180 align:start position:0%
the uh the procedure to change
 
05:48:38.150 --> 05:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
um to reflect a sex designation at Birth
 
05:48:40.548 --> 05:48:40.558 align:start position:0%
but then the entire text the bill talks
 
05:48:42.890 --> 05:48:42.900 align:start position:0%
about the gender designation change and
 
05:48:44.930 --> 05:48:44.940 align:start position:0%
I want to know if you could help me
 
05:48:46.070 --> 05:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
um distinguish
 
05:48:48.350 --> 05:48:48.360 align:start position:0%
um the difference between the two and
 
05:48:49.970 --> 05:48:49.980 align:start position:0%
um if there needs to be like you know
 
05:48:52.610 --> 05:48:52.620 align:start position:0%
the change in something from OLS thank
 
05:48:52.620 --> 05:48:53.570 align:start position:0%
the change in something from OLS thank
you

05:48:53.570 --> 05:48:53.580 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:48:53.580 --> 05:48:54.948 align:start position:0%
you
um

05:48:54.948 --> 05:48:54.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:57.650 --> 05:48:57.660 align:start position:0%
I understand that there's references to
 
05:49:00.350 --> 05:49:00.360 align:start position:0%
gender in the in the document
 
05:49:02.930 --> 05:49:02.940 align:start position:0%
um where many of us are familiar with
 
05:49:06.230 --> 05:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
gender versus sex however
 
05:49:08.868 --> 05:49:08.878 align:start position:0%
on the document that's produced the
 
05:49:11.930 --> 05:49:11.940 align:start position:0%
birth record includes sex it doesn't
 
05:49:14.448 --> 05:49:14.458 align:start position:0%
identify gender we have the same issue
 
05:49:16.548 --> 05:49:16.558 align:start position:0%
actually when we worked on the driver's
 
05:49:19.030 --> 05:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
licenses the bill was was
 
05:49:23.150 --> 05:49:23.160 align:start position:0%
identified as gender but the uh the
 
05:49:26.330 --> 05:49:26.340 align:start position:0%
drivers uh the DMV prints out sex on our
 
05:49:28.190 --> 05:49:28.200 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses so that's what it is
 
05:49:31.670 --> 05:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
in this case it is sex that's actually
 
05:49:34.368 --> 05:49:34.378 align:start position:0%
printed on the birth certificate
 
05:49:36.470 --> 05:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
um although many of us identify with
 
05:49:39.590 --> 05:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
gender so it's it's written in this as
 
05:49:42.948 --> 05:49:42.958 align:start position:0%
gender but it's it is sex on the actual
 
05:49:42.958 --> 05:49:48.410 align:start position:0%
gender but it's it is sex on the actual
form

05:49:48.410 --> 05:49:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:52.010 --> 05:49:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:54.470 --> 05:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman thank you Mr
 
05:49:57.170 --> 05:49:57.180 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm just going to speak briefly
 
05:49:59.628 --> 05:49:59.638 align:start position:0%
to the amendment I
 
05:50:02.990 --> 05:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
I support the bill but I can't support
 
05:50:05.390 --> 05:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
this amendment simply for the fact that
 
05:50:08.330 --> 05:50:08.340 align:start position:0%
I think that the birth certificate needs
 
05:50:11.030 --> 05:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
to have a notation on it indicating that
 
05:50:13.250 --> 05:50:13.260 align:start position:0%
it's been amended
 
05:50:15.350 --> 05:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
um not just the original that's with the
 
05:50:18.650 --> 05:50:18.660 align:start position:0%
the town clerk I think that it needs to
 
05:50:18.660 --> 05:50:19.628 align:start position:0%
the town clerk I think that it needs to
be

05:50:19.628 --> 05:50:19.638 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:50:22.548 --> 05:50:22.558 align:start position:0%
acknowledged so that when
 
05:50:25.010 --> 05:50:25.020 align:start position:0%
procuring your birth certificate to
 
05:50:28.070 --> 05:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
whatever organization is asking for it
 
05:50:32.090 --> 05:50:32.100 align:start position:0%
they can see that it's been changed so I
 
05:50:34.190 --> 05:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
can't support the amendment and if it
 
05:50:35.930 --> 05:50:35.940 align:start position:0%
passes I won't be able to support the
 
05:50:38.350 --> 05:50:38.360 align:start position:0%
bill representative yeah
 
05:50:41.750 --> 05:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
I speak in our position because I think
 
05:50:44.750 --> 05:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
that it's correct to
 
05:50:47.930 --> 05:50:47.940 align:start position:0%
um well let's see I apologize for not
 
05:50:49.730 --> 05:50:49.740 align:start position:0%
being a very good speaker I'm better at
 
05:50:52.510 --> 05:50:52.520 align:start position:0%
writing because you can delete things
 
05:50:55.850 --> 05:50:55.860 align:start position:0%
the issue here that's in that's in the
 
05:50:58.548 --> 05:50:58.558 align:start position:0%
room that nobody say is that there's a
 
05:51:02.868 --> 05:51:02.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:04.850 --> 05:51:04.860 align:start position:0%
trans girls
 
05:51:09.230 --> 05:51:09.240 align:start position:0%
who have retained their uh
 
05:51:09.240 --> 05:51:11.708 align:start position:0%
who have retained their uh
male

05:51:11.708 --> 05:51:11.718 align:start position:0%
male
 
05:51:14.150 --> 05:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
Advantage physical Advantage for
 
05:51:16.970 --> 05:51:16.980 align:start position:0%
participating in girls Sports
 
05:51:20.270 --> 05:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
this is a very complicated issue that
 
05:51:23.628 --> 05:51:23.638 align:start position:0%
needs to be addressed separately because
 
05:51:26.330 --> 05:51:26.340 align:start position:0%
some trans girls you can look at and you
 
05:51:29.628 --> 05:51:29.638 align:start position:0%
would never ever guess that they have or
 
05:51:32.930 --> 05:51:32.940 align:start position:0%
trans and others that we've seen on TV
 
05:51:37.070 --> 05:51:37.080 align:start position:0%
who are excellent athletes really dudes
 
05:51:40.670 --> 05:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
look like boys and that's probably a
 
05:51:42.708 --> 05:51:42.718 align:start position:0%
medical thing about the treatment when
 
05:51:45.770 --> 05:51:45.780 align:start position:0%
it was done or if it's been done to so
 
05:51:48.530 --> 05:51:48.540 align:start position:0%
yes I think that is an issue
 
05:51:51.948 --> 05:51:51.958 align:start position:0%
but in this case most people are not
 
05:51:54.770 --> 05:51:54.780 align:start position:0%
trans girls trying to participate in
 
05:51:57.770 --> 05:51:57.780 align:start position:0%
sports that needs to be addressed but in
 
05:52:01.010 --> 05:52:01.020 align:start position:0%
this case I think it's important enough
 
05:52:04.510 --> 05:52:04.520 align:start position:0%
that the original birth certificate is
 
05:52:08.270 --> 05:52:08.280 align:start position:0%
uh is kept on record along with the new
 
05:52:08.280 --> 05:52:09.048 align:start position:0%
uh is kept on record along with the new
one

05:52:09.048 --> 05:52:09.058 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:52:11.868 --> 05:52:11.878 align:start position:0%
uh and that everybody has a right to
 
05:52:14.390 --> 05:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
their privacy when they need
 
05:52:16.970 --> 05:52:16.980 align:start position:0%
um to show a birth certificate for any
 
05:52:19.010 --> 05:52:19.020 align:start position:0%
number of reasons the few times in your
 
05:52:21.650 --> 05:52:21.660 align:start position:0%
life you really need it I don't think
 
05:52:23.750 --> 05:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
it's anybody else's business what you
 
05:52:27.650 --> 05:52:27.660 align:start position:0%
have gone through to change your sex
 
05:52:30.708 --> 05:52:30.718 align:start position:0%
it's not something casually done it
 
05:52:33.830 --> 05:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
takes years and it's it's just a really
 
05:52:36.650 --> 05:52:36.660 align:start position:0%
not only expensive but expensive in
 
05:52:39.170 --> 05:52:39.180 align:start position:0%
money but it's expensive in feelings and
 
05:52:41.810 --> 05:52:41.820 align:start position:0%
time and attorneys and it goes upon and
 
05:52:44.930 --> 05:52:44.940 align:start position:0%
on and on so I think that it's extremely
 
05:52:48.830 --> 05:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
important to allow people who are trans
 
05:52:50.930 --> 05:52:50.940 align:start position:0%
who have completed it
 
05:52:53.750 --> 05:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
just like to get a driver's license they
 
05:52:55.368 --> 05:52:55.378 align:start position:0%
ought to have a birth certificate that
 
05:52:57.590 --> 05:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't give away their private medical
 
05:53:00.110 --> 05:53:00.120 align:start position:0%
history to any stranger that they have
 
05:53:03.110 --> 05:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:07.310 --> 05:53:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:10.430 --> 05:53:10.440 align:start position:0%
see no more hands up
 
05:53:13.990 --> 05:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
but as before us is amendment
 
05:53:18.470 --> 05:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
0608h to House Bill 295 moved by
 
05:53:21.530 --> 05:53:21.540 align:start position:0%
representative Cannon and seconded by
 
05:53:24.288 --> 05:53:24.298 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant and before the
 
05:53:27.590 --> 05:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
clerk is asked to call the roll I'm
 
05:53:29.868 --> 05:53:29.878 align:start position:0%
going to vote Yes on the amendment
 
05:53:32.628 --> 05:53:32.638 align:start position:0%
because I believe as a general principle
 
05:53:35.448 --> 05:53:35.458 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of a bill should be able to
 
05:53:38.770 --> 05:53:38.780 align:start position:0%
present exactly the bill he or she wants
 
05:53:43.010 --> 05:53:43.020 align:start position:0%
so I believe that irrespective of what I
 
05:53:46.670 --> 05:53:46.680 align:start position:0%
believe in the amended bill I believe it
 
05:53:51.110 --> 05:53:51.120 align:start position:0%
is the sponsor's right to have exactly
 
05:53:54.230 --> 05:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
the bill the person wants so therefore
 
05:53:56.948 --> 05:53:56.958 align:start position:0%
for that reason I'm going to
 
05:54:01.010 --> 05:54:01.020 align:start position:0%
honor representative Canon and give the
 
05:54:04.070 --> 05:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
amendment a yes vote
 
05:54:06.470 --> 05:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
will the clerk call the roll please

are we all set to vote I mean also
 
05:56:08.048 --> 05:56:08.058 align:start position:0%
representative active
 
05:56:11.530 --> 05:56:11.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:14.390 --> 05:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh no I can okay thank you
 
05:56:16.548 --> 05:56:16.558 align:start position:0%
representative Cannon you are recognized
 
05:56:18.048 --> 05:56:18.058 align:start position:0%
for a motion
 
05:56:21.708 --> 05:56:21.718 align:start position:0%
yes I move out to pass on House Bill 295
 
05:56:25.548 --> 05:56:25.558 align:start position:0%
as amended with Amendment zero six zero
 
05:56:27.350 --> 05:56:27.360 align:start position:0%
eight h
 
05:56:31.788 --> 05:56:31.798 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative Weber is it
 
05:56:31.798 --> 05:56:33.110 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative Weber is it
yes

05:56:33.110 --> 05:56:33.120 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:56:36.948 --> 05:56:36.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:39.490 --> 05:56:39.500 align:start position:0%
I want to remind people with this bill
 
05:56:42.708 --> 05:56:42.718 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't change the intentions
 
05:56:45.948 --> 05:56:45.958 align:start position:0%
of the RSA that already exists and has
 
05:56:49.788 --> 05:56:49.798 align:start position:0%
existence existed since 2005 and that
 
05:56:57.350 --> 05:56:57.360 align:start position:0%
RSA was RSA 5-c 87 Roman numeral five
 
05:57:00.470 --> 05:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
um this this bill adds a process that
 
05:57:03.470 --> 05:57:03.480 align:start position:0%
didn't exist back back then and hasn't
 
05:57:07.430 --> 05:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
existed for 15 years it costs the state
 
05:57:09.010 --> 05:57:09.020 align:start position:0%
and our
 
05:57:11.930 --> 05:57:11.940 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions money to implement it
 
05:57:14.330 --> 05:57:14.340 align:start position:0%
currently this will reduce the burden
 
05:57:16.868 --> 05:57:16.878 align:start position:0%
and the cost associated with processing
 
05:57:20.810 --> 05:57:20.820 align:start position:0%
these birth record updates
 
05:57:20.820 --> 05:57:21.530 align:start position:0%
these birth record updates
um

05:57:21.530 --> 05:57:21.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:57:25.610 --> 05:57:25.620 align:start position:0%
that that RSA has already determined
 
05:57:25.620 --> 05:57:27.110 align:start position:0%
that that RSA has already determined
that

05:57:27.110 --> 05:57:27.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:57:29.810 --> 05:57:29.820 align:start position:0%
sex changes can be
 
05:57:32.510 --> 05:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
recorded on a birth record in New
 
05:57:36.110 --> 05:57:36.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it doesn't change that
 
05:57:39.708 --> 05:57:39.718 align:start position:0%
it does provide for a form
 
05:57:42.170 --> 05:57:42.180 align:start position:0%
to be used in the process to simplify
 
05:57:45.470 --> 05:57:45.480 align:start position:0%
that process for the clerks and the
 
05:57:47.930 --> 05:57:47.940 align:start position:0%
Vital Records Office as well as the
 
05:57:47.940 --> 05:57:49.430 align:start position:0%
Vital Records Office as well as the
individual

05:57:49.430 --> 05:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
individual
 
05:57:53.270 --> 05:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:54.650 --> 05:57:54.660 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:57:57.650 --> 05:57:57.660 align:start position:0%
what else representative Cushman thank
 
05:57:58.970 --> 05:57:58.980 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman
 
05:58:01.850 --> 05:58:01.860 align:start position:0%
um representative Cannon just a point of
 
05:58:04.670 --> 05:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
clarification so yes I understand that
 
05:58:07.610 --> 05:58:07.620 align:start position:0%
it is legal to change birth certificates
 
05:58:11.090 --> 05:58:11.100 align:start position:0%
to reflect a change of gender but am I
 
05:58:13.310 --> 05:58:13.320 align:start position:0%
correct in my understanding that that
 
05:58:16.430 --> 05:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
requires currently a court process and a
 
05:58:19.548 --> 05:58:19.558 align:start position:0%
judge ordering that change
 
05:58:23.570 --> 05:58:23.580 align:start position:0%
it it does and it requires a physician
 
05:58:26.390 --> 05:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
make the decision that a judge makes the
 
05:58:29.690 --> 05:58:29.700 align:start position:0%
Judgment upon the this this bill
 
05:58:33.530 --> 05:58:33.540 align:start position:0%
requires a physician to sign the form
 
05:58:35.628 --> 05:58:35.638 align:start position:0%
and have it
 
05:58:35.638 --> 05:58:37.810 align:start position:0%
and have it
um

05:58:37.810 --> 05:58:37.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:39.890 --> 05:58:39.900 align:start position:0%
have it uh
 
05:58:43.970 --> 05:58:43.980 align:start position:0%
annotated that that they are in fact uh
 
05:58:46.310 --> 05:58:46.320 align:start position:0%
signing it themselves and it would be
 
05:58:50.030 --> 05:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:53.280 --> 05:58:53.290 align:start position:0%
thank you if it was somebody else also
 
05:58:53.290 --> 05:58:54.650 align:start position:0%
thank you if it was somebody else also
[Music]

05:58:54.650 --> 05:58:54.660 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:58:54.660 --> 05:58:55.490 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

05:58:55.490 --> 05:58:55.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:58:58.128 --> 05:58:58.138 align:start position:0%
my feelings about birth certificates are
 
05:58:59.868 --> 05:58:59.878 align:start position:0%
is that they should stay the way they
 
05:58:59.878 --> 05:59:00.890 align:start position:0%
is that they should stay the way they
are

05:59:00.890 --> 05:59:00.900 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:59:00.900 --> 05:59:02.208 align:start position:0%
are
um

05:59:02.208 --> 05:59:02.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:59:04.070 --> 05:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't matter what the change is
 
05:59:07.788 --> 05:59:07.798 align:start position:0%
so this has nothing to do with why this
 
05:59:11.390 --> 05:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
bill particular bill has come forward I
 
05:59:14.930 --> 05:59:14.940 align:start position:0%
just believe that any change in a birth
 
05:59:17.750 --> 05:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
certificate should have a notation on
 
05:59:20.030 --> 05:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
the birth certificate that a change has
 
05:59:24.170 --> 05:59:24.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:26.390 --> 05:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
05:59:28.270 --> 05:59:28.280 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
05:59:31.010 --> 05:59:31.020 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant thank you Mr
 
05:59:33.170 --> 05:59:33.180 align:start position:0%
chairman I also want to point out with
 
05:59:34.628 --> 05:59:34.638 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
05:59:37.250 --> 05:59:37.260 align:start position:0%
by having the Secretary of State create
 
05:59:39.708 --> 05:59:39.718 align:start position:0%
a standardized form to be utilized
 
05:59:43.788 --> 05:59:43.798 align:start position:0%
across the state it minimizes the issue
 
05:59:46.610 --> 05:59:46.620 align:start position:0%
of city clerks or courts themselves and
 
05:59:49.310 --> 05:59:49.320 align:start position:0%
have multiple types of forms in the
 
05:59:52.070 --> 05:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
vital records so I think having a
 
05:59:54.350 --> 05:59:54.360 align:start position:0%
standardized form across the state is
 
05:59:57.948 --> 05:59:57.958 align:start position:0%
important and I also want to stress what
 
06:00:00.708 --> 06:00:00.718 align:start position:0%
sent uh representative Canon said
 
06:00:02.510 --> 06:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
it doesn't change
 
06:00:05.150 --> 06:00:05.160 align:start position:0%
the process it doesn't change the law it
 
06:00:08.030 --> 06:00:08.040 align:start position:0%
only provides a vehicle to a little lock
 
06:00:10.128 --> 06:00:10.138 align:start position:0%
and go forward this has been around
 
06:00:12.170 --> 06:00:12.180 align:start position:0%
since 2006 and sadly we have to actually
 
06:00:14.750 --> 06:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
have an amendment or a statute to uh
 
06:00:16.910 --> 06:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
create an application process that
 
06:00:18.410 --> 06:00:18.420 align:start position:0%
should have been done probably 14 years
 
06:00:18.420 --> 06:00:26.628 align:start position:0%
should have been done probably 14 years
ago

06:00:26.628 --> 06:00:26.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:31.250 --> 06:00:31.260 align:start position:0%
I see no more hands up that's more
 
06:00:31.260 --> 06:00:33.128 align:start position:0%
I see no more hands up that's more
first

06:00:33.128 --> 06:00:33.138 align:start position:0%
first
 
06:00:35.690 --> 06:00:35.700 align:start position:0%
rubber Merchant snow and Shapiro
 
06:00:37.788 --> 06:00:37.798 align:start position:0%
representative whoever sounds like a law
 
06:00:37.798 --> 06:00:40.730 align:start position:0%
representative whoever sounds like a law
firm

06:00:40.730 --> 06:00:40.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:42.650 --> 06:00:42.660 align:start position:0%
well I'm very glad that I got to be
 
06:00:45.610 --> 06:00:45.620 align:start position:0%
senior partner but um it's
 
06:00:48.410 --> 06:00:48.420 align:start position:0%
let me say it's a disadvantage to have
 
06:00:51.288 --> 06:00:51.298 align:start position:0%
your Law Firm start with a name with a W
 
06:00:54.830 --> 06:00:54.840 align:start position:0%
so uh always get the one who's first in
 
06:00:57.650 --> 06:00:57.660 align:start position:0%
the alphabet uh I just wanted to point
 
06:00:59.690 --> 06:00:59.700 align:start position:0%
out and I thank representative Cannon
 
06:01:02.750 --> 06:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
for her changes on this but we do
 
06:01:04.850 --> 06:01:04.860 align:start position:0%
actually amend birth certificates for
 
06:01:06.530 --> 06:01:06.540 align:start position:0%
all kinds of reasons
 
06:01:09.890 --> 06:01:09.900 align:start position:0%
um uh you can you can amend them
 
06:01:12.110 --> 06:01:12.120 align:start position:0%
um generally speaking I'm not sure that
 
06:01:13.788 --> 06:01:13.798 align:start position:0%
this is the case in New Hampshire but it
 
06:01:16.190 --> 06:01:16.200 align:start position:0%
certainly was in the case in Vermont you
 
06:01:19.070 --> 06:01:19.080 align:start position:0%
have a grace period of a couple of years
 
06:01:21.948 --> 06:01:21.958 align:start position:0%
to amend the name on a birth certificate
 
06:01:24.530 --> 06:01:24.540 align:start position:0%
we issue new birth certificates when a
 
06:01:26.350 --> 06:01:26.360 align:start position:0%
child is adopted
 
06:01:29.270 --> 06:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
there are other reasons and I they don't
 
06:01:31.368 --> 06:01:31.378 align:start position:0%
come immediately to my mind but you do
 
06:01:33.890 --> 06:01:33.900 align:start position:0%
we do change birth certificates I think
 
06:01:36.110 --> 06:01:36.120 align:start position:0%
that it is very important that we retain
 
06:01:38.930 --> 06:01:38.940 align:start position:0%
the original record and this bill has
 
06:01:42.048 --> 06:01:42.058 align:start position:0%
done that but I also think that the
 
06:01:43.310 --> 06:01:43.320 align:start position:0%
whole purpose
 
06:01:43.320 --> 06:01:44.690 align:start position:0%
whole purpose
of

06:01:44.690 --> 06:01:44.700 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:01:47.208 --> 06:01:47.218 align:start position:0%
what we issue and this is the way we do
 
06:01:50.448 --> 06:01:50.458 align:start position:0%
it now is that the individual get a new
 
06:01:52.430 --> 06:01:52.440 align:start position:0%
birth certificate that they can hand to
 
06:01:55.490 --> 06:01:55.500 align:start position:0%
somebody else uh that does not have a
 
06:01:58.250 --> 06:01:58.260 align:start position:0%
marginal note on it that affirms who
 
06:02:01.910 --> 06:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
they are and and is again you know this
 
06:02:04.070 --> 06:02:04.080 align:start position:0%
is not done lightly or easily even
 
06:02:06.410 --> 06:02:06.420 align:start position:0%
though we have the only thing we're
 
06:02:08.628 --> 06:02:08.638 align:start position:0%
doing here is taking the court process
 
06:02:11.868 --> 06:02:11.878 align:start position:0%
out of it thus saving money and time
 
06:02:15.288 --> 06:02:15.298 align:start position:0%
both for the individual involved and for
 
06:02:17.990 --> 06:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
our overburdened court system uh it's
 
06:02:20.330 --> 06:02:20.340 align:start position:0%
it's a thing that's better done with
 
06:02:23.208 --> 06:02:23.218 align:start position:0%
medical personnel and the people who
 
06:02:25.128 --> 06:02:25.138 align:start position:0%
keep the records so thank you I'm
 
06:02:27.230 --> 06:02:27.240 align:start position:0%
supporting it
 
06:02:32.090 --> 06:02:32.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:34.190 --> 06:02:34.200 align:start position:0%
I gotta take my hand down sorry for that
 
06:02:41.930 --> 06:02:41.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:44.750 --> 06:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
sorry I forgot to remove my
 
06:02:46.570 --> 06:02:46.580 align:start position:0%
last time no questions
 
06:02:49.610 --> 06:02:49.620 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
06:02:51.288 --> 06:02:51.298 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
06:02:53.448 --> 06:02:53.458 align:start position:0%
um and thank you representative Cannon
 
06:02:56.288 --> 06:02:56.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:00.170 --> 06:03:00.180 align:start position:0%
am I correct to think that as well as
 
06:03:03.288 --> 06:03:03.298 align:start position:0%
reducing the burden on courts that this
 
06:03:03.298 --> 06:03:05.030 align:start position:0%
reducing the burden on courts that this
bill

06:03:05.030 --> 06:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:03:07.730 --> 06:03:07.740 align:start position:0%
um when passed and signed will
 
06:03:10.250 --> 06:03:10.260 align:start position:0%
create more consistency for people who
 
06:03:11.868 --> 06:03:11.878 align:start position:0%
want to make this change in their birth
 
06:03:11.878 --> 06:03:13.310 align:start position:0%
want to make this change in their birth
record

06:03:13.310 --> 06:03:13.320 align:start position:0%
record
 
06:03:16.190 --> 06:03:16.200 align:start position:0%
um that when people go to the courts to
 
06:03:18.048 --> 06:03:18.058 align:start position:0%
do that that different judges might use
 
06:03:21.048 --> 06:03:21.058 align:start position:0%
different criteria to decide what
 
06:03:24.350 --> 06:03:24.360 align:start position:0%
constitutes a change in sex
 
06:03:26.208 --> 06:03:26.218 align:start position:0%
um for example whether there needs to be
 
06:03:29.030 --> 06:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
surgery or not but this will create a
 
06:03:30.830 --> 06:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
situation where there is consistency
 
06:03:34.070 --> 06:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
across the board that people can ask
 
06:03:36.548 --> 06:03:36.558 align:start position:0%
their health care provider
 
06:03:42.350 --> 06:03:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:45.410 --> 06:03:45.420 align:start position:0%
that's correct representative
 
06:03:45.420 --> 06:03:46.368 align:start position:0%
that's correct representative
um

06:03:46.368 --> 06:03:46.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:03:50.208 --> 06:03:50.218 align:start position:0%
currently our courts are given different
 
06:03:53.150 --> 06:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
information from different Physicians
 
06:03:55.430 --> 06:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
and different applications there is no
 
06:03:58.970 --> 06:03:58.980 align:start position:0%
consistency even the clerk's offices are
 
06:04:01.610 --> 06:04:01.620 align:start position:0%
handed handwritten letters or typed
 
06:04:03.770 --> 06:04:03.780 align:start position:0%
letters or whatever but it's all
 
06:04:05.330 --> 06:04:05.340 align:start position:0%
different information in all different
 
06:04:08.208 --> 06:04:08.218 align:start position:0%
forms and formats this what this bill
 
06:04:10.190 --> 06:04:10.200 align:start position:0%
would standardize the information that's
 
06:04:12.708 --> 06:04:12.718 align:start position:0%
provided so that the Vital Records
 
06:04:14.510 --> 06:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
Office will get the information they
 
06:04:17.628 --> 06:04:17.638 align:start position:0%
need and the local towns or cities will
 
06:04:19.910 --> 06:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
get the information they need to keep a
 
06:04:22.070 --> 06:04:22.080 align:start position:0%
standard record in format
 
06:04:25.490 --> 06:04:25.500 align:start position:0%
I do want to say that the
 
06:04:25.500 --> 06:04:27.110 align:start position:0%
I do want to say that the
currently

06:04:27.110 --> 06:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
currently
 
06:04:29.270 --> 06:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
people do this they have been doing this
 
06:04:31.190 --> 06:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
for 15 years
 
06:04:31.200 --> 06:04:33.770 align:start position:0%
for 15 years
the

06:04:33.770 --> 06:04:33.780 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:04:37.670 --> 06:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
the information is widely varied that's
 
06:04:40.010 --> 06:04:40.020 align:start position:0%
gone to different courts and courts may
 
06:04:42.530 --> 06:04:42.540 align:start position:0%
have two or three times that they have
 
06:04:45.048 --> 06:04:45.058 align:start position:0%
to bring the applicant and their medical
 
06:04:48.890 --> 06:04:48.900 align:start position:0%
professionals in to educate the court on
 
06:04:50.990 --> 06:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
how to make a decision on this
 
06:04:54.830 --> 06:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
uh so the court becomes
 
06:04:56.810 --> 06:04:56.820 align:start position:0%
completely dependent on the medical
 
06:04:58.250 --> 06:04:58.260 align:start position:0%
professionals that have been working
 
06:05:01.730 --> 06:05:01.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:01.740 --> 06:05:02.810 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:05:02.810 --> 06:05:02.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:05:07.548 --> 06:05:07.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:10.570 --> 06:05:10.580 align:start position:0%
they will continue to use this very
 
06:05:12.948 --> 06:05:12.958 align:start position:0%
confusing process
 
06:05:15.170 --> 06:05:15.180 align:start position:0%
it won't change what we're currently
 
06:05:18.110 --> 06:05:18.120 align:start position:0%
doing people will still continue to get
 
06:05:20.750 --> 06:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
their birth record changed
 
06:05:22.850 --> 06:05:22.860 align:start position:0%
without a marginal note on their birth
 
06:05:26.150 --> 06:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
certificate so this bill doesn't change
 
06:05:29.810 --> 06:05:29.820 align:start position:0%
that it does simplify the process and it
 
06:05:34.070 --> 06:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:37.250 --> 06:05:37.260 align:start position:0%
representative knurk thank you very much
 
06:05:40.730 --> 06:05:40.740 align:start position:0%
uh yes I and I think that it is
 
06:05:43.990 --> 06:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate to get the courts out of
 
06:05:46.850 --> 06:05:46.860 align:start position:0%
some perception which
 
06:05:50.090 --> 06:05:50.100 align:start position:0%
to me is a very strong reality
 
06:05:54.530 --> 06:05:54.540 align:start position:0%
but still perception laid parallel
 
06:05:54.540 --> 06:05:55.970 align:start position:0%
but still perception laid parallel
with

06:05:55.970 --> 06:05:55.980 align:start position:0%
with
 
06:05:58.070 --> 06:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
hard cold facts
 
06:05:58.080 --> 06:05:58.910 align:start position:0%
hard cold facts
um

06:05:58.910 --> 06:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:06:02.090 --> 06:06:02.100 align:start position:0%
the birth certificate has
 
06:06:06.650 --> 06:06:06.660 align:start position:0%
the wrong area of the country
 
06:06:10.448 --> 06:06:10.458 align:start position:0%
that has information that may impact
 
06:06:13.910 --> 06:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
diseases that are of more much more in
 
06:06:15.830 --> 06:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
one place than another the data gets a
 
06:06:16.788 --> 06:06:16.798 align:start position:0%
little off
 
06:06:19.190 --> 06:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
or representative Nelson's comment about
 
06:06:19.200 --> 06:06:20.890 align:start position:0%
or representative Nelson's comment about
65

06:06:20.890 --> 06:06:20.900 align:start position:0%
65
 
06:06:20.900 --> 06:06:21.048 align:start position:0%
65
[Music]

06:06:21.048 --> 06:06:21.058 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:06:21.058 --> 06:06:23.090 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

06:06:23.090 --> 06:06:23.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:26.650 --> 06:06:26.660 align:start position:0%
I'm 71 because I showed up in June of
 
06:06:30.288 --> 06:06:30.298 align:start position:0%
1949 irrespective of how I feel like I'm
 
06:06:32.990 --> 06:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
an extremely young 71 and I want
 
06:06:34.730 --> 06:06:34.740 align:start position:0%
everybody to know it
 
06:06:38.448 --> 06:06:38.458 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking of Alexander Hamilton who
 
06:06:40.730 --> 06:06:40.740 align:start position:0%
really wanted to be president but he
 
06:06:42.830 --> 06:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
could not be president because he was
 
06:06:45.470 --> 06:06:45.480 align:start position:0%
born in Saint Kitts and Nevis
 
06:06:47.510 --> 06:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
and if he said look I've been here in
 
06:06:49.850 --> 06:06:49.860 align:start position:0%
America for a long time I feel more
 
06:06:52.490 --> 06:06:52.500 align:start position:0%
American than you know Uncle Sam and
 
06:06:54.350 --> 06:06:54.360 align:start position:0%
anybody else you want to mention I
 
06:06:56.990 --> 06:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
really really feel myself to be an
 
06:06:58.670 --> 06:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
American the fact is he was born in
 
06:07:00.470 --> 06:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
Saint Kitts and Nevis
 
06:07:03.110 --> 06:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
and know his birth certificate shouldn't
 
06:07:07.610 --> 06:07:07.620 align:start position:0%
be changed or how about the woman who's
 
06:07:11.208 --> 06:07:11.218 align:start position:0%
so identified with black folks and loved
 
06:07:12.770 --> 06:07:12.780 align:start position:0%
them and loved that culture and so on
 
06:07:14.930 --> 06:07:14.940 align:start position:0%
and did various things and took various
 
06:07:18.110 --> 06:07:18.120 align:start position:0%
things and and passed for black and
 
06:07:21.830 --> 06:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
became head of an NAACP chapter
 
06:07:24.890 --> 06:07:24.900 align:start position:0%
until it was learned she was white
 
06:07:27.590 --> 06:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
and you know uh
 
06:07:30.708 --> 06:07:30.718 align:start position:0%
wonderful to identify with her black
 
06:07:33.650 --> 06:07:33.660 align:start position:0%
community and and whatnot you know
 
06:07:35.690 --> 06:07:35.700 align:start position:0%
cultural approach appropriation be
 
06:07:37.970 --> 06:07:37.980 align:start position:0%
damned she was happy to do that but the
 
06:07:40.310 --> 06:07:40.320 align:start position:0%
fact of the matter is she was not black
 
06:07:42.548 --> 06:07:42.558 align:start position:0%
and so for me
 
06:07:45.110 --> 06:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
documents that would say here is how I
 
06:07:47.750 --> 06:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
perceive myself to be here is what I
 
06:07:50.448 --> 06:07:50.458 align:start position:0%
wish people to know me as people call me
 
06:07:54.430 --> 06:07:54.440 align:start position:0%
as and all of that rock on but
 
06:07:56.930 --> 06:07:56.940 align:start position:0%
chromosomes were there at Birth
 
06:07:56.940 --> 06:07:58.548 align:start position:0%
chromosomes were there at Birth
and

06:07:58.548 --> 06:07:58.558 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:08:02.030 --> 06:08:02.040 align:start position:0%
if there is a document that
 
06:08:05.510 --> 06:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
is the I really believe myself to be
 
06:08:05.520 --> 06:08:07.128 align:start position:0%
is the I really believe myself to be
documented

06:08:07.128 --> 06:08:07.138 align:start position:0%
documented
 
06:08:10.490 --> 06:08:10.500 align:start position:0%
now becomes the birth certificate
 
06:08:14.030 --> 06:08:14.040 align:start position:0%
when a person goes to a coach
 
06:08:16.310 --> 06:08:16.320 align:start position:0%
of a girl sports team and say I want to
 
06:08:18.230 --> 06:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
play on this team
 
06:08:20.330 --> 06:08:20.340 align:start position:0%
and there's only 14 people on the team
 
06:08:21.890 --> 06:08:21.900 align:start position:0%
and not one of them is going to be
 
06:08:24.110 --> 06:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
bounced from the team and what is the
 
06:08:25.490 --> 06:08:25.500 align:start position:0%
proof that you should play on this team
 
06:08:26.868 --> 06:08:26.878 align:start position:0%
here's my birth certificate it
 
06:08:29.208 --> 06:08:29.218 align:start position:0%
unequivocally says I'm female
 
06:08:31.970 --> 06:08:31.980 align:start position:0%
and now somebody's been bombed
 
06:08:31.980 --> 06:08:32.868 align:start position:0%
and now somebody's been bombed
um

06:08:32.868 --> 06:08:32.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:08:34.670 --> 06:08:34.680 align:start position:0%
you know in terms of
 
06:08:34.680 --> 06:08:36.530 align:start position:0%
you know in terms of
celebrating

06:08:36.530 --> 06:08:36.540 align:start position:0%
celebrating
 
06:08:40.970 --> 06:08:40.980 align:start position:0%
who One Believes oneself to be
 
06:08:45.430 --> 06:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
you know yeah absolutely but in terms of
 
06:08:47.750 --> 06:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
documents that
 
06:08:50.030 --> 06:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
not only are supposed to be objective
 
06:08:52.970 --> 06:08:52.980 align:start position:0%
but are used to prove
 
06:08:54.890 --> 06:08:54.900 align:start position:0%
your age
 
06:08:56.868 --> 06:08:56.878 align:start position:0%
I'm over this age now
 
06:08:59.868 --> 06:08:59.878 align:start position:0%
I I really want to get Medicare
 
06:09:02.270 --> 06:09:02.280 align:start position:0%
or any other
 
06:09:02.280 --> 06:09:04.128 align:start position:0%
or any other
use

06:09:04.128 --> 06:09:04.138 align:start position:0%
use
 
06:09:06.890 --> 06:09:06.900 align:start position:0%
no to me that's not right
 
06:09:11.208 --> 06:09:11.218 align:start position:0%
so I will not be supporting the bill
 
06:09:17.510 --> 06:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:19.910 --> 06:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
I understand discomfort with certain
 
06:09:22.730 --> 06:09:22.740 align:start position:0%
changes enumerated by several people who
 
06:09:24.048 --> 06:09:24.058 align:start position:0%
have spoken
 
06:09:25.970 --> 06:09:25.980 align:start position:0%
but that's not the bill that's in front
 
06:09:27.770 --> 06:09:27.780 align:start position:0%
of us
 
06:09:30.948 --> 06:09:30.958 align:start position:0%
the bill that's in front of us
 
06:09:30.958 --> 06:09:33.190 align:start position:0%
the bill that's in front of us
simply

06:09:33.190 --> 06:09:33.200 align:start position:0%
simply
 
06:09:37.310 --> 06:09:37.320 align:start position:0%
makes easier a process which has already
 
06:09:42.770 --> 06:09:42.780 align:start position:0%
been the law in this state for 15 years
 
06:09:45.830 --> 06:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
that's all it does
 
06:09:48.770 --> 06:09:48.780 align:start position:0%
you can already do everything in this
 
06:09:53.030 --> 06:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
bill by going in front of a judge
 
06:09:53.040 --> 06:09:55.190 align:start position:0%
bill by going in front of a judge
so

06:09:55.190 --> 06:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:09:58.610 --> 06:09:58.620 align:start position:0%
you can't change your age you cannot
 
06:10:03.170 --> 06:10:03.180 align:start position:0%
change your race you cannot change the
 
06:10:06.410 --> 06:10:06.420 align:start position:0%
fact that you were born in Nevis
 
06:10:10.850 --> 06:10:10.860 align:start position:0%
um you can only change this one thing
 
06:10:17.770 --> 06:10:17.780 align:start position:0%
and with the amount of effort and pain
 
06:10:22.030 --> 06:10:22.040 align:start position:0%
and personal journey and medical
 
06:10:25.610 --> 06:10:25.620 align:start position:0%
interventions that go along with
 
06:10:25.620 --> 06:10:27.830 align:start position:0%
interventions that go along with
changing

06:10:27.830 --> 06:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
changing
 
06:10:29.750 --> 06:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
one's birth
 
06:10:34.430 --> 06:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
gender to one's real gender
 
06:10:38.030 --> 06:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
the idea that somebody would go through
 
06:10:40.970 --> 06:10:40.980 align:start position:0%
that for the privilege of being able to
 
06:10:43.970 --> 06:10:43.980 align:start position:0%
play on a girls sports team thereby
 
06:10:47.090 --> 06:10:47.100 align:start position:0%
bumping a girl with female chromosomes
 
06:10:49.788 --> 06:10:49.798 align:start position:0%
rather than a playing on a boy's team
 
06:10:52.310 --> 06:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
where they might not make the theme is
 
06:10:56.810 --> 06:10:56.820 align:start position:0%
just ridiculous the issues here are so
 
06:10:59.510 --> 06:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
much more complicated than that and the
 
06:11:02.030 --> 06:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
process is so much more complicated and
 
06:11:04.490 --> 06:11:04.500 align:start position:0%
so much more difficult but I can't
 
06:11:07.090 --> 06:11:07.100 align:start position:0%
imagine that anybody would go through it
 
06:11:10.430 --> 06:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
unless they had that voice inside of
 
06:11:12.530 --> 06:11:12.540 align:start position:0%
them saying
 
06:11:16.010 --> 06:11:16.020 align:start position:0%
I'm not a girl I'm a boy or I'm not a
 
06:11:17.570 --> 06:11:17.580 align:start position:0%
boy I'm a girl
 
06:11:23.150 --> 06:11:23.160 align:start position:0%
so for that reason this is only changing
 
06:11:26.510 --> 06:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
an administrative procedure it's not
 
06:11:29.628 --> 06:11:29.638 align:start position:0%
changing anything else and
 
06:11:32.990 --> 06:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
um I urge people to vote for it
 
06:11:35.330 --> 06:11:35.340 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Cannon
 
06:11:39.708 --> 06:11:39.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:42.230 --> 06:11:42.240 align:start position:0%
my health history
 
06:11:42.240 --> 06:11:43.788 align:start position:0%
my health history
in

06:11:43.788 --> 06:11:43.798 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:11:47.590 --> 06:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
in all of my records with my health care
 
06:11:50.990 --> 06:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
flags that I am a transgender individual
 
06:11:52.970 --> 06:11:52.980 align:start position:0%
male to female
 
06:11:55.430 --> 06:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
those records go with me wherever I go
 
06:11:58.010 --> 06:11:58.020 align:start position:0%
as far as an individual
 
06:12:00.530 --> 06:12:00.540 align:start position:0%
so people from a health care perspective
 
06:12:03.530 --> 06:12:03.540 align:start position:0%
know exactly who I am and what changes
 
06:12:06.830 --> 06:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
have been done to my body
 
06:12:06.840 --> 06:12:08.330 align:start position:0%
have been done to my body
um

06:12:08.330 --> 06:12:08.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:12:08.340 --> 06:12:10.250 align:start position:0%
um
I

06:12:10.250 --> 06:12:10.260 align:start position:0%
I
 
06:12:14.208 --> 06:12:14.218 align:start position:0%
my birth certificate exists down in
 
06:12:16.850 --> 06:12:16.860 align:start position:0%
Newton Massachusetts I have a new birth
 
06:12:21.048 --> 06:12:21.058 align:start position:0%
certificate that indicates my new name
 
06:12:23.030 --> 06:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
as well as
 
06:12:26.330 --> 06:12:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:28.970 --> 06:12:28.980 align:start position:0%
I haven't had the chance to have to use
 
06:12:30.770 --> 06:12:30.780 align:start position:0%
that birth certificate for anything
 
06:12:33.410 --> 06:12:33.420 align:start position:0%
except for updating information on my
 
06:12:35.270 --> 06:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
social security card
 
06:12:37.070 --> 06:12:37.080 align:start position:0%
and my
 
06:12:37.080 --> 06:12:38.510 align:start position:0%
and my
uh

06:12:38.510 --> 06:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:12:38.520 --> 06:12:39.890 align:start position:0%
uh
passport

06:12:39.890 --> 06:12:39.900 align:start position:0%
passport
 
06:12:42.048 --> 06:12:42.058 align:start position:0%
and even in the case of the passport I
 
06:12:45.288 --> 06:12:45.298 align:start position:0%
had to provide a doctor statement that I
 
06:12:49.250 --> 06:12:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:52.250 --> 06:12:52.260 align:start position:0%
I did change information on insurance
 
06:12:55.190 --> 06:12:55.200 align:start position:0%
policies there were no questions asked
 
06:12:59.390 --> 06:12:59.400 align:start position:0%
they just asked except for a copy of my
 
06:13:02.270 --> 06:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
revised birth certificate
 
06:13:04.368 --> 06:13:04.378 align:start position:0%
and name change
 
06:13:06.948 --> 06:13:06.958 align:start position:0%
and they just took it as this is the way
 
06:13:10.190 --> 06:13:10.200 align:start position:0%
it is and they updated the information
 
06:13:12.288 --> 06:13:12.298 align:start position:0%
there was no question
 
06:13:15.350 --> 06:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:18.010 --> 06:13:18.020 align:start position:0%
for me as an individual and my own
 
06:13:20.270 --> 06:13:20.280 align:start position:0%
Mental Health
 
06:13:21.650 --> 06:13:21.660 align:start position:0%
it was
 
06:13:23.750 --> 06:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
something that needed to happen in my
 
06:13:23.760 --> 06:13:25.430 align:start position:0%
something that needed to happen in my
life

06:13:25.430 --> 06:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
life
 
06:13:29.030 --> 06:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:31.788 --> 06:13:31.798 align:start position:0%
this didn't happen until I didn't have
 
06:13:34.250 --> 06:13:34.260 align:start position:0%
change my information until five years
 
06:13:34.260 --> 06:13:36.048 align:start position:0%
change my information until five years
ago

06:13:36.048 --> 06:13:36.058 align:start position:0%
ago
 
06:13:38.448 --> 06:13:38.458 align:start position:0%
I'm 68 years old now
 
06:13:40.490 --> 06:13:40.500 align:start position:0%
a lot of people go through this process
 
06:13:43.730 --> 06:13:43.740 align:start position:0%
and fight all their lives and that was
 
06:13:46.570 --> 06:13:46.580 align:start position:0%
an affirming thing for me
 
06:13:49.310 --> 06:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
I will probably never use my birth
 
06:13:51.948 --> 06:13:51.958 align:start position:0%
certificate again it will sit in the
 
06:13:54.410 --> 06:13:54.420 align:start position:0%
drawer or put it and it will stay on
 
06:13:57.948 --> 06:13:57.958 align:start position:0%
file with the city of Newton in
 
06:13:57.958 --> 06:13:59.690 align:start position:0%
file with the city of Newton in
Massachusetts

06:13:59.690 --> 06:13:59.700 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
06:14:02.270 --> 06:14:02.280 align:start position:0%
in case I ever need it
 
06:14:04.070 --> 06:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:14:08.230 --> 06:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Shapiro
 
06:14:11.448 --> 06:14:11.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:14.208 --> 06:14:14.218 align:start position:0%
um I completely understand people's
 
06:14:16.368 --> 06:14:16.378 align:start position:0%
discomfort with changing a birth
 
06:14:18.288 --> 06:14:18.298 align:start position:0%
certificate that
 
06:14:22.070 --> 06:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
um just doesn't seem logical
 
06:14:24.110 --> 06:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
um and for logical people like me it
 
06:14:26.150 --> 06:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
06:14:29.690 --> 06:14:29.700 align:start position:0%
sticks in my craw and likewise recently
 
06:14:31.670 --> 06:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
in the last couple of years somebody in
 
06:14:33.948 --> 06:14:33.958 align:start position:0%
my extended family
 
06:14:36.770 --> 06:14:36.780 align:start position:0%
um asked all of us to start calling them
 
06:14:40.310 --> 06:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
by a different pronoun by they them
 
06:14:42.948 --> 06:14:42.958 align:start position:0%
and it was incredibly difficult for me
 
06:14:46.010 --> 06:14:46.020 align:start position:0%
um at first I could do it maybe one in
 
06:14:47.708 --> 06:14:47.718 align:start position:0%
ten times
 
06:14:49.970 --> 06:14:49.980 align:start position:0%
over the last couple of years I've
 
06:14:53.090 --> 06:14:53.100 align:start position:0%
gotten better I can do it maybe
 
06:14:55.250 --> 06:14:55.260 align:start position:0%
seventy percent of the time but I often
 
06:14:58.070 --> 06:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
get it wrong and somehow it makes me
 
06:15:01.430 --> 06:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable in terms of just my
 
06:15:04.070 --> 06:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
you know the grammar that I learned my
 
06:15:05.810 --> 06:15:05.820 align:start position:0%
whole life it just doesn't make sense to
 
06:15:05.820 --> 06:15:06.470 align:start position:0%
whole life it just doesn't make sense to
me

06:15:06.470 --> 06:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
me
 
06:15:06.480 --> 06:15:08.208 align:start position:0%
me
but

06:15:08.208 --> 06:15:08.218 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:15:10.788 --> 06:15:10.798 align:start position:0%
I thought about this a lot and I can
 
06:15:14.628 --> 06:15:14.638 align:start position:0%
compare my discomfort
 
06:15:14.638 --> 06:15:16.310 align:start position:0%
compare my discomfort
um

06:15:16.310 --> 06:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:15:18.650 --> 06:15:18.660 align:start position:0%
with something that seems
 
06:15:22.430 --> 06:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
off grammatically to me I can't compare
 
06:15:26.750 --> 06:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
my comfort to the healing
 
06:15:29.150 --> 06:15:29.160 align:start position:0%
um that this means to somebody and I
 
06:15:31.368 --> 06:15:31.378 align:start position:0%
can't really I could never really
 
06:15:33.410 --> 06:15:33.420 align:start position:0%
um articulate it better than
 
06:15:36.190 --> 06:15:36.200 align:start position:0%
representative Cannon just articulated
 
06:15:39.350 --> 06:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
so I'm very willing to have my
 
06:15:41.628 --> 06:15:41.638 align:start position:0%
discomfort with these things so that
 
06:15:43.970 --> 06:15:43.980 align:start position:0%
people who are
 
06:15:46.310 --> 06:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
um who struggled their whole lives and
 
06:15:50.750 --> 06:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:52.788 --> 06:15:52.798 align:start position:0%
come to grips with who they really are
 
06:15:55.430 --> 06:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
and have the courage to make changes out
 
06:15:57.110 --> 06:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
in the world
 
06:15:59.510 --> 06:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
um to feel more like themselves I can't
 
06:16:02.090 --> 06:16:02.100 align:start position:0%
compare my discomfort with a birth
 
06:16:04.970 --> 06:16:04.980 align:start position:0%
certificate or with trying to get the
 
06:16:06.170 --> 06:16:06.180 align:start position:0%
grammar right
 
06:16:06.180 --> 06:16:07.070 align:start position:0%
grammar right
um

06:16:07.070 --> 06:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:16:10.368 --> 06:16:10.378 align:start position:0%
I'm the one that has to get over it and
 
06:16:12.770 --> 06:16:12.780 align:start position:0%
um it's well worth getting over it so I
 
06:16:15.970 --> 06:16:15.980 align:start position:0%
will vote Yes for this
 
06:16:20.330 --> 06:16:20.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:22.190 --> 06:16:22.200 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson didn't take the
 
06:16:24.530 --> 06:16:24.540 align:start position:0%
hand down I guess
 
06:16:27.948 --> 06:16:27.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:29.930 --> 06:16:29.940 align:start position:0%
representative guy
 
06:16:33.350 --> 06:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
I think uh this is kind of like a
 
06:16:33.360 --> 06:16:34.430 align:start position:0%
I think uh this is kind of like a
compromise

06:16:34.430 --> 06:16:34.440 align:start position:0%
compromise
 
06:16:37.430 --> 06:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
because if you're like me you thought
 
06:16:39.708 --> 06:16:39.718 align:start position:0%
you thought that in the past in the past
 
06:16:43.190 --> 06:16:43.200 align:start position:0%
15 years you thought that the original
 
06:16:46.850 --> 06:16:46.860 align:start position:0%
birth certificate was retained
 
06:16:50.208 --> 06:16:50.218 align:start position:0%
it turns out there were two paths uh
 
06:16:51.530 --> 06:16:51.540 align:start position:0%
representative Cannon I'll have to
 
06:16:53.570 --> 06:16:53.580 align:start position:0%
explain if you want to know but there
 
06:16:55.970 --> 06:16:55.980 align:start position:0%
were two paths to get your birth
 
06:16:59.448 --> 06:16:59.458 align:start position:0%
certificate changed and one of them when
 
06:17:01.970 --> 06:17:01.980 align:start position:0%
the judge did it your original birth
 
06:17:05.030 --> 06:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
certificate was destroyed
 
06:17:07.310 --> 06:17:07.320 align:start position:0%
so this is the step for everybody who
 
06:17:09.948 --> 06:17:09.958 align:start position:0%
really wants records kept this is a step
 
06:17:12.830 --> 06:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
in the right direction to retain the
 
06:17:16.010 --> 06:17:16.020 align:start position:0%
original to keep the history
 
06:17:18.490 --> 06:17:18.500 align:start position:0%
so that does not
 
06:17:22.430 --> 06:17:22.440 align:start position:0%
this this bill does not deal with the
 
06:17:23.868 --> 06:17:23.878 align:start position:0%
issue of
 
06:17:26.330 --> 06:17:26.340 align:start position:0%
how how much is someone's sex change
 
06:17:28.610 --> 06:17:28.620 align:start position:0%
when they're a kid in high school should
 
06:17:32.030 --> 06:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
should trans boys trans girls get to
 
06:17:35.510 --> 06:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
play that's that affects some people and
 
06:17:38.150 --> 06:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
it is an issue but it's not this one
 
06:17:40.910 --> 06:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
and that if you really want the records
 
06:17:42.170 --> 06:17:42.180 align:start position:0%
to be right
 
06:17:45.530 --> 06:17:45.540 align:start position:0%
this bill makes them more correct than
 
06:17:56.948 --> 06:17:56.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:59.810 --> 06:17:59.820 align:start position:0%
see nothing further the chair calls on
 
06:18:02.150 --> 06:18:02.160 align:start position:0%

of recipients that can be searched by a
 
06:22:27.110 --> 06:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
network of providers and the goal is to
 
06:22:28.850 --> 06:22:28.860 align:start position:0%
treat the whole person
 
06:22:31.850 --> 06:22:31.860 align:start position:0%

06:22:44.868 --> 06:22:44.878 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
06:22:44.878 --> 06:22:45.708 align:start position:0%
the amendment
um

06:22:45.708 --> 06:22:45.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:22:48.650 --> 06:22:48.660 align:start position:0%
puts a pause on this system
 
06:22:53.090 --> 06:22:53.100 align:start position:0%
um so it will not be able to be used on
 
06:22:54.948 --> 06:22:54.958 align:start position:0%
the general public as I understand it
 
06:22:56.410 --> 06:22:56.420 align:start position:0%
the protection
 
06:22:58.788 --> 06:22:58.798 align:start position:0%
of personal private information is
 
06:23:00.530 --> 06:23:00.540 align:start position:0%
critical of critical importance to New
 
06:23:05.030 --> 06:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizen citizens and um
 
06:23:09.230 --> 06:23:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:10.910 --> 06:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
um basically says it shall not be put
 
06:23:12.650 --> 06:23:12.660 align:start position:0%
into operation for members of the
 
06:23:17.030 --> 06:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
general public before July 1st 2022 this
 
06:23:19.548 --> 06:23:19.558 align:start position:0%
will give the legislature
 
06:23:23.690 --> 06:23:23.700 align:start position:0%
um a chance to look into the system and
 
06:23:26.448 --> 06:23:26.458 align:start position:0%
um you know make some decisions on
 
06:23:29.030 --> 06:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
on it and if it needs work before it can
 
06:23:29.040 --> 06:23:29.690 align:start position:0%
on it and if it needs work before it can
be

06:23:29.690 --> 06:23:29.700 align:start position:0%
be
 
06:23:32.390 --> 06:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
broadly applied before I call on
 
06:23:34.368 --> 06:23:34.378 align:start position:0%
representative Marsh I hope everybody
 
06:23:37.690 --> 06:23:37.700 align:start position:0%
got the letter from house counsel James
 
06:23:44.150 --> 06:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
cnc's CNC relative to this and uh some
 
06:23:46.368 --> 06:23:46.378 align:start position:0%
of us from both parties raised a
 
06:23:49.670 --> 06:23:49.680 align:start position:0%
question of constitutionality with uh
 
06:23:52.128 --> 06:23:52.138 align:start position:0%
House Council CNC does not make a final
 
06:23:54.650 --> 06:23:54.660 align:start position:0%
ruling but agrees that there's there
 
06:23:57.350 --> 06:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
could well be some difficulty with this
 
06:23:59.510 --> 06:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
representative Marshalls
 
06:24:02.208 --> 06:24:02.218 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:24:05.470 --> 06:24:05.480 align:start position:0%
I I'm uh of the understanding because of
 
06:24:07.970 --> 06:24:07.980 align:start position:0%
communications between myself and the
 
06:24:09.410 --> 06:24:09.420 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
06:24:11.930 --> 06:24:11.940 align:start position:0%
and because I personally reviewed the
 
06:24:14.330 --> 06:24:14.340 align:start position:0%
contract which I downloaded from the
 
06:24:16.910 --> 06:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
executive Council website that in fact
 
06:24:20.990 --> 06:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
this data sharing rolled out and became
 
06:24:24.948 --> 06:24:24.958 align:start position:0%
effective in December 2020. I personally
 
06:24:27.410 --> 06:24:27.420 align:start position:0%
believe that it is a constitutional to
 
06:24:30.230 --> 06:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
pass drug laws and while I totally
 
06:24:32.810 --> 06:24:32.820 align:start position:0%
support the idea of the privacy and I do
 
06:24:34.250 --> 06:24:34.260 align:start position:0%
feel the department could have done a
 
06:24:36.530 --> 06:24:36.540 align:start position:0%
better job of protecting for our state I
 
06:24:38.270 --> 06:24:38.280 align:start position:0%
don't believe it's the purview of this
 
06:24:41.390 --> 06:24:41.400 align:start position:0%
legislature the password and therefore I
 
06:24:42.948 --> 06:24:42.958 align:start position:0%
unfortunately will have to vote against
 
06:24:48.230 --> 06:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:51.170 --> 06:24:51.180 align:start position:0%
anyone else yes please
 
06:24:53.690 --> 06:24:53.700 align:start position:0%
and the chair calls on the person who
 
06:24:55.250 --> 06:24:55.260 align:start position:0%
said yes please
 
06:24:57.230 --> 06:24:57.240 align:start position:0%
yes please person was representative
 
06:25:00.170 --> 06:25:00.180 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
06:25:01.430 --> 06:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
um and
 
06:25:04.430 --> 06:25:04.440 align:start position:0%
um I agree
 
06:25:07.310 --> 06:25:07.320 align:start position:0%
I agree with everything well almost
 
06:25:09.110 --> 06:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
everything that everybody said I'm very
 
06:25:11.628 --> 06:25:11.638 align:start position:0%
concerned about this process and how
 
06:25:14.030 --> 06:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
it's rolling out and I do think we ought
 
06:25:16.490 --> 06:25:16.500 align:start position:0%
to look into it more and that is
 
06:25:18.230 --> 06:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
something that both this committee could
 
06:25:20.930 --> 06:25:20.940 align:start position:0%
do either by creating an ad hoc
 
06:25:22.670 --> 06:25:22.680 align:start position:0%
committee to look into it or some
 
06:25:25.368 --> 06:25:25.378 align:start position:0%
members of the committee less than a
 
06:25:27.288 --> 06:25:27.298 align:start position:0%
majority could look into it entirely on
 
06:25:29.930 --> 06:25:29.940 align:start position:0%
their own or we could refer it to the
 
06:25:31.610 --> 06:25:31.620 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services oversight
 
06:25:32.930 --> 06:25:32.940 align:start position:0%
committee and I think all of those
 
06:25:36.890 --> 06:25:36.900 align:start position:0%
things should be done but I
 
06:25:39.948 --> 06:25:39.958 align:start position:0%
um agree with representative Marsh that
 
06:25:42.410 --> 06:25:42.420 align:start position:0%
I am concerned enough about interference
 
06:25:47.030 --> 06:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
with contract that although I agree with
 
06:25:49.910 --> 06:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
the sentiment in the amendment and I
 
06:25:52.368 --> 06:25:52.378 align:start position:0%
think it is a better way of going than
 
06:25:55.430 --> 06:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
the original bill I cannot vote for this
 
06:25:57.230 --> 06:25:57.240 align:start position:0%
amendment and I cannot vote for the bill
 
06:25:59.690 --> 06:25:59.700 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much
 
06:26:02.650 --> 06:26:02.660 align:start position:0%
thank you representative anyone else

06:26:08.628 --> 06:26:08.638 align:start position:0%
intrigued by
 
06:26:12.128 --> 06:26:12.138 align:start position:0%
um the offering that there could be a
 
06:26:15.770 --> 06:26:15.780 align:start position:0%
meeting of times to discuss it
 
06:26:19.150 --> 06:26:19.160 align:start position:0%
is there any action that could be taken
 
06:26:23.410 --> 06:26:23.420 align:start position:0%
post passing this bill are not
 
06:26:25.610 --> 06:26:25.620 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman
 
06:26:28.670 --> 06:26:28.680 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that mission to
 
06:26:30.590 --> 06:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
protect people's
 
06:26:30.600 --> 06:26:31.970 align:start position:0%
protect people's
um

06:26:31.970 --> 06:26:31.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:26:35.810 --> 06:26:35.820 align:start position:0%
medical history just by some tests the
 
06:26:38.390 --> 06:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
whole state past the um
 
06:26:41.270 --> 06:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
the Privacy at addendum to our
 
06:26:41.280 --> 06:26:43.390 align:start position:0%
the Privacy at addendum to our
constitution

06:26:43.390 --> 06:26:43.400 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
06:26:46.910 --> 06:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a change let let it
 
06:26:49.670 --> 06:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
come out but not not us just say oh it's
 
06:26:52.788 --> 06:26:52.798 align:start position:0%
fine it's okay we can't do anything so I
 
06:26:54.948 --> 06:26:54.958 align:start position:0%
would definitely support this amendment
 
06:27:00.230 --> 06:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:00.240 --> 06:27:02.090 align:start position:0%
 
representative

06:27:02.090 --> 06:27:02.100 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:27:02.100 --> 06:27:05.990 align:start position:0%
representative
[Music]

06:27:05.990 --> 06:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:08.448 --> 06:27:08.458 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so I I support the
 
06:27:11.090 --> 06:27:11.100 align:start position:0%
amendment and I support the bill and
 
06:27:13.548 --> 06:27:13.558 align:start position:0%
um yeah I I thank representative Cushman
 
06:27:15.110 --> 06:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
for pointing out the fact that this was
 
06:27:15.120 --> 06:27:15.830 align:start position:0%
for pointing out the fact that this was
not

06:27:15.830 --> 06:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
not
 
06:27:17.690 --> 06:27:17.700 align:start position:0%
a contract that was approved by the
 
06:27:17.700 --> 06:27:19.368 align:start position:0%
a contract that was approved by the
council

06:27:19.368 --> 06:27:19.378 align:start position:0%
council
 
06:27:23.150 --> 06:27:23.160 align:start position:0%
um my concern is that there is not
 
06:27:26.150 --> 06:27:26.160 align:start position:0%
uh there there really has not been any
 
06:27:28.910 --> 06:27:28.920 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight for this contract
 
06:27:32.390 --> 06:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned that you know we have a
 
06:27:36.410 --> 06:27:36.420 align:start position:0%
duty to to protect the privacy
 
06:27:38.708 --> 06:27:38.718 align:start position:0%
um in the security of information of of
 
06:27:42.590 --> 06:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residence information and
 
06:27:44.390 --> 06:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
you know a lot of the people who are
 
06:27:48.230 --> 06:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
served by social service agencies are uh
 
06:27:50.510 --> 06:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
you know may not may not necessarily be
 
06:27:53.090 --> 06:27:53.100 align:start position:0%
understanding what they're signing
 
06:27:53.100 --> 06:27:53.690 align:start position:0%
understanding what they're signing
um

06:27:53.690 --> 06:27:53.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:27:55.010 --> 06:27:55.020 align:start position:0%
who are understanding what they're
 
06:27:57.110 --> 06:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
opting into so
 
06:27:59.690 --> 06:27:59.700 align:start position:0%
um as it is right now if I go into the
 
06:28:01.910 --> 06:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
doctor's office they're going to ask me
 
06:28:03.948 --> 06:28:03.958 align:start position:0%
to sign a form
 
06:28:06.650 --> 06:28:06.660 align:start position:0%
um and that's going to be pretty
 
06:28:09.170 --> 06:28:09.180 align:start position:0%
specific as to
 
06:28:10.490 --> 06:28:10.500 align:start position:0%
who and for you know what information
 
06:28:12.410 --> 06:28:12.420 align:start position:0%
can be shared or who it can be shared
 
06:28:14.150 --> 06:28:14.160 align:start position:0%
with and when
 
06:28:16.490 --> 06:28:16.500 align:start position:0%
um and my concern is that under this
 
06:28:18.890 --> 06:28:18.900 align:start position:0%
closed-loop referral system there is
 
06:28:20.890 --> 06:28:20.900 align:start position:0%
kind of a wide open door in fact
 
06:28:23.448 --> 06:28:23.458 align:start position:0%
additional agencies could join I could
 
06:28:25.310 --> 06:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
be sharing my information sort of on a
 
06:28:27.470 --> 06:28:27.480 align:start position:0%
blanket basis
 
06:28:27.480 --> 06:28:28.390 align:start position:0%
blanket basis
um

06:28:28.390 --> 06:28:28.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:28:31.490 --> 06:28:31.500 align:start position:0%
with lots and lots of agencies sort of
 
06:28:35.030 --> 06:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
whoever whoever comes uh in into the
 
06:28:37.610 --> 06:28:37.620 align:start position:0%
closed-loop system in the future and in
 
06:28:39.170 --> 06:28:39.180 align:start position:0%
that respect it's kind of a blank check
 
06:28:42.650 --> 06:28:42.660 align:start position:0%
so you know if if somebody who is
 
06:28:44.530 --> 06:28:44.540 align:start position:0%
dealing with a substance abuse problem
 
06:28:48.948 --> 06:28:48.958 align:start position:0%
uh comes in for help and is you know is
 
06:28:50.990 --> 06:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
06:28:53.330 --> 06:28:53.340 align:start position:0%
essentially giving you know giving
 
06:28:54.830 --> 06:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
consent to
 
06:28:56.390 --> 06:28:56.400 align:start position:0%
to have their name entered into this
 
06:28:59.150 --> 06:28:59.160 align:start position:0%
closed or Loop referral system it seems
 
06:29:01.730 --> 06:29:01.740 align:start position:0%
to me that we're we're asking them to to
 
06:29:04.970 --> 06:29:04.980 align:start position:0%
to sign a blank check so to speak and I
 
06:29:06.830 --> 06:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
I think that's a dangerous precedent for
 
06:29:09.230 --> 06:29:09.240 align:start position:0%
us to be setting the concern I have is
 
06:29:10.548 --> 06:29:10.558 align:start position:0%
that there needs to be legislative
 
06:29:13.150 --> 06:29:13.160 align:start position:0%
oversight so if something like
 
06:29:19.190 --> 06:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
it fails so the amendment fails 15 to 5.
 
06:29:22.490 --> 06:29:22.500 align:start position:0%
now we go to the original bill which the
 
06:29:25.070 --> 06:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
amendment was to replace all other
 
06:29:27.770 --> 06:29:27.780 align:start position:0%
amendments have been withdrawn
 
06:29:30.708 --> 06:29:30.718 align:start position:0%
would uh representative Marsh have a
 
06:29:37.208 --> 06:29:37.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:39.708 --> 06:29:39.718 align:start position:0%
the reports of somebody else wants to
 
06:29:42.048 --> 06:29:42.058 align:start position:0%
make a motions
 
06:29:44.810 --> 06:29:44.820 align:start position:0%
where somebody else I don't see anybody
 
06:29:47.590 --> 06:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
else making a thank you representative
 
06:29:50.208 --> 06:29:50.218 align:start position:0%
representative representative web or
 
06:29:50.218 --> 06:29:53.270 align:start position:0%
representative representative web or
emotion

06:29:53.270 --> 06:29:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:55.810 --> 06:29:55.820 align:start position:0%
um I would move itl on the bill
 
06:29:59.868 --> 06:29:59.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:05.208 --> 06:30:05.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:07.430 --> 06:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
um I don't think we need to discuss it a
 
06:30:10.628 --> 06:30:10.638 align:start position:0%
lot I I think the concerns that we have
 
06:30:13.490 --> 06:30:13.500 align:start position:0%
are present in the original Bill only
 
06:30:15.170 --> 06:30:15.180 align:start position:0%
more so so
 
06:30:18.410 --> 06:30:18.420 align:start position:0%
um it interferes with contract and I
 
06:30:20.150 --> 06:30:20.160 align:start position:0%
think that that's a bad place for us to
 
06:30:22.128 --> 06:30:22.138 align:start position:0%
be going so
 
06:30:22.138 --> 06:30:23.208 align:start position:0%
be going so
um

06:30:23.208 --> 06:30:23.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:30:26.170 --> 06:30:26.180 align:start position:0%
that's really all I have to say about it
 
06:30:27.948 --> 06:30:27.958 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:30:35.390 --> 06:30:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:39.708 --> 06:30:39.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:42.708 --> 06:30:42.718 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is House Bill 601

found one this morning good thing too
 
06:33:50.520 --> 06:33:51.590 align:start position:0%
found one this morning good thing too
yeah

06:33:51.590 --> 06:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:33:54.650 --> 06:33:54.660 align:start position:0%
um we are now opening the consecutive
 
06:33:58.610 --> 06:33:58.620 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill
 
06:33:58.620 --> 06:34:02.410 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill
605

06:34:02.410 --> 06:34:02.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:05.890 --> 06:34:05.900 align:start position:0%
we've got a plethora
 
06:34:11.270 --> 06:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
multitude of amendments here that sends
 
06:34:13.670 --> 06:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
information gives us a lot of latitude
 
06:34:16.368 --> 06:34:16.378 align:start position:0%
we can take up all four of these
 
06:34:16.378 --> 06:34:17.750 align:start position:0%
we can take up all four of these
amendments

06:34:17.750 --> 06:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
06:34:17.760 --> 06:34:19.910 align:start position:0%
amendments
together

06:34:19.910 --> 06:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
together
 
06:34:22.610 --> 06:34:22.620 align:start position:0%
and they would be representative marshes
 
06:34:25.548 --> 06:34:25.558 align:start position:0%
the second part had to do with visiting
 
06:34:27.350 --> 06:34:27.360 align:start position:0%
qualifying patients
 
06:34:29.030 --> 06:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
it's important to realize that I was
 
06:34:30.470 --> 06:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
asked a question which I couldn't answer
 
06:34:33.170 --> 06:34:33.180 align:start position:0%
the visiting patient access was not a
 
06:34:36.350 --> 06:34:36.360 align:start position:0%
DHHS request however Michael Holt had
 
06:34:38.390 --> 06:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
worked very hard on the language with
 
06:34:41.570 --> 06:34:41.580 align:start position:0%
the sponsor last year uh which uh passed
 
06:34:43.910 --> 06:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
our committee and the house
 
06:34:46.010 --> 06:34:46.020 align:start position:0%
um there were also concerns raised about
 
06:34:50.150 --> 06:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
this uh Proviso uh having to do with any
 
06:34:52.970 --> 06:34:52.980 align:start position:0%
country and the question is how would we
 
06:34:54.590 --> 06:34:54.600 align:start position:0%
know what a card looks like and so on
 
06:34:57.170 --> 06:34:57.180 align:start position:0%
regard to verifying out of state cards
 
06:35:00.350 --> 06:35:00.360 align:start position:0%
it is actually the therapeutic cannabis
 
06:35:02.628 --> 06:35:02.638 align:start position:0%
program already has been dealing with
 
06:35:02.638 --> 06:35:03.890 align:start position:0%
program already has been dealing with
this

06:35:03.890 --> 06:35:03.900 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:35:06.590 --> 06:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
um they have they've shared their card
 
06:35:08.448 --> 06:35:08.458 align:start position:0%
design with many other states and those
 
06:35:10.548 --> 06:35:10.558 align:start position:0%
other states share it with ours for that
 
06:35:13.128 --> 06:35:13.138 align:start position:0%
exact purpose many states allow this
 
06:35:15.590 --> 06:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
kind of reciprocity some have formal
 
06:35:18.048 --> 06:35:18.058 align:start position:0%
reciprocity agreements with other states
 
06:35:21.110 --> 06:35:21.120 align:start position:0%
for that purpose others simply need just
 
06:35:23.330 --> 06:35:23.340 align:start position:0%
simply share that card template with the
 
06:35:25.190 --> 06:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
other state dispensaries
 
06:35:27.410 --> 06:35:27.420 align:start position:0%
so the dispensaries can verify what an
 
06:35:29.270 --> 06:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
out-of-state card looks like and that's
 
06:35:30.890 --> 06:35:30.900 align:start position:0%
rather similar to sharing a state
 
06:35:35.030 --> 06:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
license design state to a another state
 
06:35:38.330 --> 06:35:38.340 align:start position:0%
to incur underage drinking
 
06:35:40.730 --> 06:35:40.740 align:start position:0%
um the goal we we felt would be probably
 
06:35:42.410 --> 06:35:42.420 align:start position:0%
reasonable for
 
06:35:44.270 --> 06:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
um therapeutic cannabis program to
 
06:35:47.930 --> 06:35:47.940 align:start position:0%
develop a nice simple system for the
 
06:35:51.590 --> 06:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
atcs it might be like a little uh almost
 
06:35:53.570 --> 06:35:53.580 align:start position:0%
like a scrapbook with the copy of the
 
06:35:56.510 --> 06:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
cards from the various States and uh so
 
06:35:59.150 --> 06:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
we added in rule making Authority for
 
06:36:00.590 --> 06:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
them to do that
 
06:36:02.208 --> 06:36:02.218 align:start position:0%
in addition it's important to realize
 
06:36:04.730 --> 06:36:04.740 align:start position:0%
that the initial aspect of this Bill had
 
06:36:08.030 --> 06:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
to do primarily with other States and
 
06:36:10.430 --> 06:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
Canada and the reason is we border
 
06:36:12.590 --> 06:36:12.600 align:start position:0%
Canada and just as we have many people
 
06:36:14.628 --> 06:36:14.638 align:start position:0%
who come to our uh our state for an
 
06:36:15.948 --> 06:36:15.958 align:start position:0%
extended period of time from either
 
06:36:18.048 --> 06:36:18.058 align:start position:0%
Maine or Vermont or Massachusetts or
 
06:36:19.490 --> 06:36:19.500 align:start position:0%
perhaps even other states either
 
06:36:21.530 --> 06:36:21.540 align:start position:0%
students or people who have second homes
 
06:36:23.330 --> 06:36:23.340 align:start position:0%
we do have a significant number of
 
06:36:25.970 --> 06:36:25.980 align:start position:0%
Canadians who come here to stay for an
 
06:36:28.730 --> 06:36:28.740 align:start position:0%
extended period of time again to realize
 
06:36:30.650 --> 06:36:30.660 align:start position:0%
that if they are a qualifying patient in
 
06:36:32.208 --> 06:36:32.218 align:start position:0%
their home jurisdiction
 
06:36:34.010 --> 06:36:34.020 align:start position:0%
to wander across state lines with
 
06:36:36.590 --> 06:36:36.600 align:start position:0%
cannabis is illegal to wander across
 
06:36:38.750 --> 06:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
International boundaries is even more
 
06:36:41.510 --> 06:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
illegal and so if you have a patient who
 
06:36:43.788 --> 06:36:43.798 align:start position:0%
is a qualified patient in Canada and by
 
06:36:45.890 --> 06:36:45.900 align:start position:0%
the way Canada has a nationwide program
 
06:36:49.128 --> 06:36:49.138 align:start position:0%
not province-wide Nationwide so they
 
06:36:51.530 --> 06:36:51.540 align:start position:0%
want to come down from Quebec and uh
 
06:36:54.110 --> 06:36:54.120 align:start position:0%
stay at a place for a few weeks down in
 
06:36:56.810 --> 06:36:56.820 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and go hiking they don't
 
06:36:58.850 --> 06:36:58.860 align:start position:0%
have to carry it they would be able to
 
06:37:02.270 --> 06:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
uh have their get their cannabis here
 
06:37:05.030 --> 06:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
that's the whole point of this so we
 
06:37:06.948 --> 06:37:06.958 align:start position:0%
currently have in statute the authority
 
06:37:08.930 --> 06:37:08.940 align:start position:0%
to allow other states other qualified
 
06:37:10.910 --> 06:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
patients from other states to be able to
 
06:37:14.930 --> 06:37:14.940 align:start position:0%
be protected in the same fashion as our
 
06:37:16.310 --> 06:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
patients are protected meaning they
 
06:37:19.670 --> 06:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
won't be arrested for possession this
 
06:37:21.548 --> 06:37:21.558 align:start position:0%
just simply allows them to be able to
 
06:37:25.788 --> 06:37:25.798 align:start position:0%
purchase so again please pull out zero
 
06:37:28.610 --> 06:37:28.620 align:start position:0%
six four six because I'll use that as a
 
06:37:30.410 --> 06:37:30.420 align:start position:0%
template to go over the aspects of the
 
06:37:31.788 --> 06:37:31.798 align:start position:0%
amendment so you understand all the
 
06:37:31.798 --> 06:37:33.350 align:start position:0%
amendment so you understand all the
details

06:37:33.350 --> 06:37:33.360 align:start position:0%
details
 
06:37:36.350 --> 06:37:36.360 align:start position:0%
um the first lines three
 
06:37:40.128 --> 06:37:40.138 align:start position:0%
through eight uh has to do with the oud
 
06:37:41.570 --> 06:37:41.580 align:start position:0%
and that's the one that just simply
 
06:37:42.948 --> 06:37:42.958 align:start position:0%
makes it much more stringent we already
 
06:37:44.390 --> 06:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
covered that
 
06:37:49.310 --> 06:37:49.320 align:start position:0%
the next lines nine through 14.
 
06:37:52.788 --> 06:37:52.798 align:start position:0%
what that does is it simply allows the
 
06:37:56.868 --> 06:37:56.878 align:start position:0%
uh the ATC to be able to convey to a
 
06:37:59.390 --> 06:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
visiting qualifying patient
 
06:38:04.070 --> 06:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
lines 15 through 18 actually is a
 
06:38:06.830 --> 06:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
Prohibition statement it is in the uh
 
06:38:09.350 --> 06:38:09.360 align:start position:0%
it's in the statute where it says it
 
06:38:11.510 --> 06:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
includes all except the following and
 
06:38:14.030 --> 06:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
what it says here is that the
 
06:38:15.948 --> 06:38:15.958 align:start position:0%
cultivation or purchase from a
 
06:38:17.570 --> 06:38:17.580 align:start position:0%
qualifying patient or designated
 
06:38:19.788 --> 06:38:19.798 align:start position:0%
caregiver is not covered in other words
 
06:38:22.128 --> 06:38:22.138 align:start position:0%
you can purchase from an ATC but you
 
06:38:24.170 --> 06:38:24.180 align:start position:0%
can't purchase from another qualified
 
06:38:26.270 --> 06:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
patient or a designated caregiver in
 
06:38:28.070 --> 06:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
this state so again that though that
 
06:38:29.570 --> 06:38:29.580 align:start position:0%
looks like it's allowing it it's not
 
06:38:32.390 --> 06:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
it's saying it is not covered by the
 
06:38:32.400 --> 06:38:33.288 align:start position:0%
it's saying it is not covered by the
card

06:38:33.288 --> 06:38:33.298 align:start position:0%
card
 
06:38:37.788 --> 06:38:37.798 align:start position:0%
then if we go to lines 19 through 29
 
06:38:40.970 --> 06:38:40.980 align:start position:0%
that is the part that allows the patient
 
06:38:43.250 --> 06:38:43.260 align:start position:0%
uh who is a qualifying patient in
 
06:38:45.288 --> 06:38:45.298 align:start position:0%
another jurisdiction to be able to
 
06:38:47.868 --> 06:38:47.878 align:start position:0%
possess and again narrowed it from all
 
06:38:50.750 --> 06:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
countries to only Canada
 
06:38:55.010 --> 06:38:55.020 align:start position:0%
and then if we go to lines 30 uh for
 
06:38:58.548 --> 06:38:58.558 align:start position:0%
sorry 30 to the second page
 
06:39:00.350 --> 06:39:00.360 align:start position:0%
um that is the one that once again takes
 
06:39:03.770 --> 06:39:03.780 align:start position:0%
away all countries goes to Canada only
 
06:39:07.070 --> 06:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
and then there was a very interesting
 
06:39:08.750 --> 06:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
thing which I found
 
06:39:10.910 --> 06:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
um when doing a deep dive in this that
 
06:39:12.890 --> 06:39:12.900 align:start position:0%
there was a drafting error that if we
 
06:39:13.910 --> 06:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
look at
 
06:39:17.330 --> 06:39:17.340 align:start position:0%
um lines page two lines nine through
 
06:39:19.730 --> 06:39:19.740 align:start position:0%
eleven it actually had been worded
 
06:39:21.590 --> 06:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
incorrectly and said you couldn't
 
06:39:24.230 --> 06:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
purchase from the ATC we tidied that up
 
06:39:26.090 --> 06:39:26.100 align:start position:0%
so now it just says that visiting
 
06:39:28.730 --> 06:39:28.740 align:start position:0%
patient shall not cultivate
 
06:39:32.030 --> 06:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
and they also cannot purchase from a
 
06:39:33.470 --> 06:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
qualifying patient or designated
 
06:39:35.330 --> 06:39:35.340 align:start position:0%
caregiver a redundancy was what was
 
06:39:37.910 --> 06:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
there before but it does not say they
 
06:39:39.470 --> 06:39:39.480 align:start position:0%
can't purchase from an ATC because that
 
06:39:40.850 --> 06:39:40.860 align:start position:0%
was the whole point of this
 
06:39:43.070 --> 06:39:43.080 align:start position:0%
and then the last one is the new uh
 
06:39:44.810 --> 06:39:44.820 align:start position:0%
section which just gives the rules for
 
06:39:48.048 --> 06:39:48.058 align:start position:0%
the cards so the idea is that the
 
06:39:49.910 --> 06:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program will
 
06:39:53.150 --> 06:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
develop a system for the atc's verifying
 
06:39:55.310 --> 06:39:55.320 align:start position:0%
cards so that they're all using the same
 
06:39:58.430 --> 06:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
method to do verification so basically
 
06:40:01.730 --> 06:40:01.740 align:start position:0%
again six four six is the one that
 
06:40:04.310 --> 06:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
includes both oud
 
06:40:08.530 --> 06:40:08.540 align:start position:0%
and the visiting patient provides us
 
06:40:12.430 --> 06:40:12.440 align:start position:0%
allowing them to purchase from an ATC
 
06:40:12.440 --> 06:40:14.208 align:start position:0%
allowing them to purchase from an ATC
0644

06:40:14.208 --> 06:40:14.218 align:start position:0%
0644
 
06:40:16.128 --> 06:40:16.138 align:start position:0%
allows oud
 
06:40:18.830 --> 06:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
only does not address the visiting
 
06:40:20.990 --> 06:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
patient question
 
06:40:23.690 --> 06:40:23.700 align:start position:0%
oh six four five addresses the visiting
 
06:40:25.730 --> 06:40:25.740 align:start position:0%
patient only
 
06:40:29.510 --> 06:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
does not include the oud question so
 
06:40:31.730 --> 06:40:31.740 align:start position:0%
that way we can decide which one we want
 
06:40:33.948 --> 06:40:33.958 align:start position:0%
to go with we can then vote on that and
 
06:40:36.548 --> 06:40:36.558 align:start position:0%
not have to do a whole lot of time I had
 
06:40:39.048 --> 06:40:39.058 align:start position:0%
the chair and I discussed perhaps doing
 
06:40:41.690 --> 06:40:41.700 align:start position:0%
a quick straw vote because it seems like
 
06:40:43.128 --> 06:40:43.138 align:start position:0%
everybody is pretty comfortable with
 
06:40:46.850 --> 06:40:46.860 align:start position:0%
both then we could just move 0646 and
 
06:40:48.470 --> 06:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
not have to go through Amendment after
 
06:40:53.948 --> 06:40:53.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:56.868 --> 06:40:56.878 align:start position:0%
it gets it more complicated because
 
06:40:59.868 --> 06:40:59.878 align:start position:0%
representative Marsh in this amendathon
 
06:41:02.930 --> 06:41:02.940 align:start position:0%
has zero four a two who would do
 
06:41:04.788 --> 06:41:04.798 align:start position:0%
something quite different yet and
 
06:41:07.610 --> 06:41:07.620 align:start position:0%
representative Marsh yes thank you Mr
 
06:41:09.770 --> 06:41:09.780 align:start position:0%
chair in the event none of these
 
06:41:13.490 --> 06:41:13.500 align:start position:0%
amendments are adopted before but I
 
06:41:15.530 --> 06:41:15.540 align:start position:0%
believe I could support them at zero six
 
06:41:17.690 --> 06:41:17.700 align:start position:0%
four five eight which allows out of
 
06:41:19.970 --> 06:41:19.980 align:start position:0%
state cases from the United States and
 
06:41:22.970 --> 06:41:22.980 align:start position:0%
Canada to utilize our atcs for the valid
 
06:41:22.980 --> 06:41:24.110 align:start position:0%
Canada to utilize our atcs for the valid
process

06:41:24.110 --> 06:41:24.120 align:start position:0%
process
 
06:41:25.788 --> 06:41:25.798 align:start position:0%
um I don't believe I can support the
 
06:41:27.410 --> 06:41:27.420 align:start position:0%
other two amendments because I think the
 
06:41:31.670 --> 06:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
data hopefully a use disorder is full of
 
06:41:33.650 --> 06:41:33.660 align:start position:0%
discipline and that there is at least
 
06:41:35.690 --> 06:41:35.700 align:start position:0%
some data that would lead me to believe
 
06:41:37.670 --> 06:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
that they actually made profiling use
 
06:41:42.470 --> 06:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:44.570 --> 06:41:44.580 align:start position:0%
may I actually speak to that for a
 
06:41:46.610 --> 06:41:46.620 align:start position:0%
moment too I actually speak
 
06:41:49.730 --> 06:41:49.740 align:start position:0%
okay yes and I the the board really does
 
06:41:51.230 --> 06:41:51.240 align:start position:0%
agree with what representative Marsh
 
06:41:54.288 --> 06:41:54.298 align:start position:0%
just said the whole point is that THC is
 
06:41:56.810 --> 06:41:56.820 align:start position:0%
a gives reward therefore it will in
 
06:41:59.930 --> 06:41:59.940 align:start position:0%
increase issues of
 
06:42:04.010 --> 06:42:04.020 align:start position:0%
um use disorder it's the CBD which has
 
06:42:07.910 --> 06:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
the ability to work on withdrawal and
 
06:42:10.850 --> 06:42:10.860 align:start position:0%
the craving issue and that is why we set
 
06:42:13.970 --> 06:42:13.980 align:start position:0%
up such tight guard rails so that you
 
06:42:16.310 --> 06:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
have a person who is aware of that
 
06:42:18.830 --> 06:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
because we were pretty convinced that
 
06:42:20.390 --> 06:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
your average practitioner your average
 
06:42:23.150 --> 06:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
PCP even a medication assisted treatment
 
06:42:25.788 --> 06:42:25.798 align:start position:0%
PCP is not going to have enough
 
06:42:28.368 --> 06:42:28.378 align:start position:0%
knowledge base to be able to make that
 
06:42:30.650 --> 06:42:30.660 align:start position:0%
distinction because remember a provider
 
06:42:31.730 --> 06:42:31.740 align:start position:0%
which in this case should be an
 
06:42:33.470 --> 06:42:33.480 align:start position:0%
addiction psychiatrist or addiction
 
06:42:36.170 --> 06:42:36.180 align:start position:0%
medicine specialist has the authority
 
06:42:38.868 --> 06:42:38.878 align:start position:0%
and the ATC must follow it they have the
 
06:42:42.230 --> 06:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
authority to request a CBD predominant
 
06:42:46.010 --> 06:42:46.020 align:start position:0%
or CBD only preparation
 
06:42:47.628 --> 06:42:47.638 align:start position:0%
um in other words it isn't that they
 
06:42:49.430 --> 06:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
just go in the ATC decides what they
 
06:42:52.250 --> 06:42:52.260 align:start position:0%
want they can request CBD only and that
 
06:42:54.410 --> 06:42:54.420 align:start position:0%
must be followed
 
06:42:56.868 --> 06:42:56.878 align:start position:0%
and this is the chair speaking
 
06:42:59.030 --> 06:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
um remind me please you said there was a
 
06:43:03.470 --> 06:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
drafting era that is not in Amendment
 
06:43:07.368 --> 06:43:07.378 align:start position:0%
6458 correct no the the drafting error
 
06:43:09.850 --> 06:43:09.860 align:start position:0%
was in the original bill
 
06:43:12.590 --> 06:43:12.600 align:start position:0%
yeah and I we fixed that I just simply
 
06:43:14.330 --> 06:43:14.340 align:start position:0%
found the inconsistency checked it with
 
06:43:16.430 --> 06:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
Mike Holt he agreed there was that was
 
06:43:19.190 --> 06:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
incorrect and we corrected that thank
 
06:43:20.270 --> 06:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
06:43:23.090 --> 06:43:23.100 align:start position:0%
um representative Shapiro
 
06:43:25.310 --> 06:43:25.320 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman
 
06:43:27.590 --> 06:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
um representative canark
 
06:43:30.830 --> 06:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
in Amendment zero six four six which
 
06:43:33.410 --> 06:43:33.420 align:start position:0%
includes the opioid use disorder and the
 
06:43:33.420 --> 06:43:34.610 align:start position:0%
includes the opioid use disorder and the
visiting

06:43:34.610 --> 06:43:34.620 align:start position:0%
visiting
 
06:43:37.368 --> 06:43:37.378 align:start position:0%
um Canadians
 
06:43:40.548 --> 06:43:40.558 align:start position:0%
um I'm concerned about the
 
06:43:43.190 --> 06:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
um kind of strict guard rails or
 
06:43:46.190 --> 06:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
guidance around who can qualify that
 
06:43:49.490 --> 06:43:49.500 align:start position:0%
person and I wonder if um Michael Holt
 
06:43:52.430 --> 06:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
has chimed in or whether he can chime in
 
06:43:55.070 --> 06:43:55.080 align:start position:0%
right now about will that create
 
06:43:58.070 --> 06:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
problems in administrating
 
06:44:01.368 --> 06:44:01.378 align:start position:0%
um the atcs and following that strict
 
06:44:04.310 --> 06:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
guidance if Mr Holt has been a meeting
 
06:44:04.320 --> 06:44:06.310 align:start position:0%
guidance if Mr Holt has been a meeting
um

06:44:06.310 --> 06:44:06.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:44:10.850 --> 06:44:10.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:13.070 --> 06:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
uh hello uh thank you for the
 
06:44:15.230 --> 06:44:15.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity my name is Michael Holt I'm
 
06:44:16.490 --> 06:44:16.500 align:start position:0%
the administrator of the therapeutic
 
06:44:18.230 --> 06:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
cannabis program
 
06:44:20.030 --> 06:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
um representative Shapiro can you repeat
 
06:44:21.470 --> 06:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
your question are you concerned about
 
06:44:25.910 --> 06:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
the atc's verifying out-of-state cards
 
06:44:27.530 --> 06:44:27.540 align:start position:0%
or is your question about the
 
06:44:30.170 --> 06:44:30.180 align:start position:0%
Department's ability to
 
06:44:33.170 --> 06:44:33.180 align:start position:0%
um enforce the provider type guard rails
 
06:44:35.750 --> 06:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
for the certification for oud
 
06:44:38.090 --> 06:44:38.100 align:start position:0%
my concern is in regards to somebody
 
06:44:41.510 --> 06:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
being qualified with an opioid use
 
06:44:46.548 --> 06:44:46.558 align:start position:0%
disorder there's a lot of conditions
 
06:44:48.708 --> 06:44:48.718 align:start position:0%
about who can be the qualifying
 
06:44:48.718 --> 06:44:50.890 align:start position:0%
about who can be the qualifying
physician

06:44:50.890 --> 06:44:50.900 align:start position:0%
physician
 
06:44:54.410 --> 06:44:54.420 align:start position:0%
excuse me products can be used and I'm
 
06:44:56.048 --> 06:44:56.058 align:start position:0%
wondering if that's going to create
 
06:45:00.230 --> 06:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
problems for the aatc in atcs in in
 
06:45:02.510 --> 06:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
terms of being able to follow all those
 
06:45:04.490 --> 06:45:04.500 align:start position:0%
different conditions
 
06:45:06.110 --> 06:45:06.120 align:start position:0%
okay I understand thank you for the
 
06:45:07.368 --> 06:45:07.378 align:start position:0%
questions but there's two elements here
 
06:45:09.770 --> 06:45:09.780 align:start position:0%
the first is uh the Department's ability
 
06:45:09.780 --> 06:45:11.150 align:start position:0%
the first is uh the Department's ability
to

06:45:11.150 --> 06:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:45:15.650 --> 06:45:15.660 align:start position:0%
um enforce the provider qualifications
 
06:45:17.090 --> 06:45:17.100 align:start position:0%
um that's not an issue for us we would
 
06:45:20.030 --> 06:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
establish those uh um documentation or
 
06:45:22.610 --> 06:45:22.620 align:start position:0%
verification protocols so that we can be
 
06:45:24.948 --> 06:45:24.958 align:start position:0%
assured that the provider is certifying
 
06:45:28.910 --> 06:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
for oud are in fact board certified in
 
06:45:33.048 --> 06:45:33.058 align:start position:0%
addictions Psychiatry or a medicine it's
 
06:45:35.330 --> 06:45:35.340 align:start position:0%
not an issue for us at all
 
06:45:37.090 --> 06:45:37.100 align:start position:0%
um regarding the second piece about the
 
06:45:40.610 --> 06:45:40.620 align:start position:0%
atc's uh
 
06:45:40.620 --> 06:45:41.410 align:start position:0%
atc's uh
um

06:45:41.410 --> 06:45:41.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:45:44.510 --> 06:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
enforcing or implementing a provider's
 
06:45:46.788 --> 06:45:46.798 align:start position:0%
instruction on dispensing that's a
 
06:45:47.990 --> 06:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
process that we already have in place
 
06:45:51.470 --> 06:45:51.480 align:start position:0%
right now where providers can send
 
06:45:55.910 --> 06:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
instructions to the ATC and then the ATC
 
06:45:58.490 --> 06:45:58.500 align:start position:0%
um our atcs are required to follow those
 
06:46:00.410 --> 06:46:00.420 align:start position:0%
instructions when they dispense to that
 
06:46:02.510 --> 06:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
particular patient so that that was
 
06:46:04.310 --> 06:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
that's something that we could uh that
 
06:46:06.230 --> 06:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't have an issue with enforcing
 
06:46:06.240 --> 06:46:07.850 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't have an issue with enforcing
either

06:46:07.850 --> 06:46:07.860 align:start position:0%
either
 
06:46:10.010 --> 06:46:10.020 align:start position:0%
thank you

put my hand up you're always welcome

when you want to come back
 
06:46:32.448 --> 06:46:32.458 align:start position:0%
representative Folsom
 
06:46:35.270 --> 06:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
um I I think I'm agreeing with
 
06:46:38.510 --> 06:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
um representative Marsh on this one I am
 
06:46:40.610 --> 06:46:40.620 align:start position:0%
really happy that they made the changes
 
06:46:43.208 --> 06:46:43.218 align:start position:0%
to just Canada I feel like big shots
 
06:46:45.770 --> 06:46:45.780 align:start position:0%
that whole ID kind of program under
 
06:46:48.468 --> 06:46:48.478 align:start position:0%
control as far as the medical marijuana
 
06:46:48.478 --> 06:46:49.910 align:start position:0%
control as far as the medical marijuana
cards

06:46:49.910 --> 06:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
cards
 
06:46:51.948 --> 06:46:51.958 align:start position:0%
um but I just don't feel comfortable
 
06:46:55.548 --> 06:46:55.558 align:start position:0%
with the opioid right now
 
06:47:00.110 --> 06:47:00.120 align:start position:0%
um I think that science uh the science
 
06:47:03.890 --> 06:47:03.900 align:start position:0%
isn't totally there yet
 
06:47:06.048 --> 06:47:06.058 align:start position:0%
um and that's due you know to the ball
 
06:47:10.010 --> 06:47:10.020 align:start position:0%
fit nobody can do a lot of the research
 
06:47:10.020 --> 06:47:11.270 align:start position:0%
fit nobody can do a lot of the research
yet

06:47:11.270 --> 06:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
yet
 
06:47:12.830 --> 06:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
um until the federal government makes up
 
06:47:15.468 --> 06:47:15.478 align:start position:0%
its mind what it's going to do but I'm
 
06:47:17.330 --> 06:47:17.340 align:start position:0%
just not feeling comfortable with the
 
06:47:20.448 --> 06:47:20.458 align:start position:0%
opioid but I would definitely feel
 
06:47:23.330 --> 06:47:23.340 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the
 
06:47:26.150 --> 06:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
um sharing of medical marijuana cards
 
06:47:28.930 --> 06:47:28.940 align:start position:0%
from and purchasing from state to state
 
06:47:31.250 --> 06:47:31.260 align:start position:0%
and with
 
06:47:31.260 --> 06:47:32.530 align:start position:0%
and with
um

06:47:32.530 --> 06:47:32.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:47:36.350 --> 06:47:36.360 align:start position:0%
the Cannabis protections
 
06:47:36.360 --> 06:47:37.128 align:start position:0%
the Cannabis protections
um

06:47:37.128 --> 06:47:37.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:47:42.410 --> 06:47:42.420 align:start position:0%

thank you anyone else

um I am
 
06:47:56.330 --> 06:47:56.340 align:start position:0%
I I think with the guard rails which are
 
06:47:59.750 --> 06:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
pretty steep guard rails I'm okay with
 
06:48:03.110 --> 06:48:03.120 align:start position:0%
the opioid use disorder treatment
 
06:48:03.120 --> 06:48:05.628 align:start position:0%
the opioid use disorder treatment
provision

06:48:05.628 --> 06:48:05.638 align:start position:0%
provision
 
06:48:10.610 --> 06:48:10.620 align:start position:0%
um and I am very much in support of the
 
06:48:12.708 --> 06:48:12.718 align:start position:0%
visiting patient Provisions with the
 
06:48:16.430 --> 06:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
addition of of patients from Canada I
 
06:48:19.850 --> 06:48:19.860 align:start position:0%
wonder if perhaps a way to proceed would
 
06:48:23.830 --> 06:48:23.840 align:start position:0%
be to offer
 
06:48:28.490 --> 06:48:28.500 align:start position:0%
uh six and if that's voted down then to
 
06:48:30.548 --> 06:48:30.558 align:start position:0%
offer 45
 
06:48:34.730 --> 06:48:34.740 align:start position:0%
uh because that way we would have the
 
06:48:34.740 --> 06:48:35.570 align:start position:0%
uh because that way we would have the
the

06:48:35.570 --> 06:48:35.580 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:48:38.750 --> 06:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
we'd have both of both pass but if both
 
06:48:41.150 --> 06:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
don't pass it's very clear which
 
06:48:43.190 --> 06:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
direction I think we're the committee is
 
06:48:45.650 --> 06:48:45.660 align:start position:0%
going in unless other people have
 
06:48:47.868 --> 06:48:47.878 align:start position:0%
something to say if you'd prefer to do
 
06:48:50.090 --> 06:48:50.100 align:start position:0%
it via straw poll I'm I'm glad to do
 
06:48:53.270 --> 06:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
that too but I I think sounds to me like
 
06:48:54.948 --> 06:48:54.958 align:start position:0%
those are the decisions we're making is
 
06:48:57.048 --> 06:48:57.058 align:start position:0%
whether the the
 
06:48:59.868 --> 06:48:59.878 align:start position:0%
um uh opioid use disorder treatment is
 
06:49:01.250 --> 06:49:01.260 align:start position:0%
in or out
 
06:49:03.770 --> 06:49:03.780 align:start position:0%
I'm leaning towards doing a hybrid of
 
06:49:07.968 --> 06:49:07.978 align:start position:0%
both and that is a strong Paul uh just
 
06:49:09.410 --> 06:49:09.420 align:start position:0%
kind of see where the room is because
 
06:49:11.270 --> 06:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
the body language we can't do that so
 
06:49:12.890 --> 06:49:12.900 align:start position:0%
easily here
 
06:49:15.770 --> 06:49:15.780 align:start position:0%
um and and then do that descending order
 
06:49:18.830 --> 06:49:18.840 align:start position:0%
of voting on amendments uh
 
06:49:20.628 --> 06:49:20.638 align:start position:0%
representative Woods
 
06:49:22.548 --> 06:49:22.558 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair
 
06:49:26.030 --> 06:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
um uh I'm in favor of of both uh going
 
06:49:28.250 --> 06:49:28.260 align:start position:0%
with I guess it's six
 
06:49:31.270 --> 06:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the oud
 
06:49:35.270 --> 06:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm very uh pleased to get the
 
06:49:38.208 --> 06:49:38.218 align:start position:0%
result from the oversight committee
 
06:49:40.548 --> 06:49:40.558 align:start position:0%
um uh knowing the people that are on
 
06:49:41.930 --> 06:49:41.940 align:start position:0%
there and I know a lot of them
 
06:49:45.310 --> 06:49:45.320 align:start position:0%
personally uh if this came out unanimous
 
06:49:49.850 --> 06:49:49.860 align:start position:0%
uh knowing the the general flavor and
 
06:49:52.548 --> 06:49:52.558 align:start position:0%
the strictness with which these
 
06:49:54.590 --> 06:49:54.600 align:start position:0%
individuals and I said I know many of
 
06:49:54.600 --> 06:49:55.850 align:start position:0%
individuals and I said I know many of
them

06:49:55.850 --> 06:49:55.860 align:start position:0%
them
 
06:49:58.250 --> 06:49:58.260 align:start position:0%
um I'm very surprised
 
06:50:01.930 --> 06:50:01.940 align:start position:0%
to say it unanimous support for oud
 
06:50:04.910 --> 06:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
knowing these folks and the fact that it
 
06:50:06.170 --> 06:50:06.180 align:start position:0%
did come out
 
06:50:10.310 --> 06:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
as unanimous uh means that it passed
 
06:50:13.150 --> 06:50:13.160 align:start position:0%
very stringent you know
 
06:50:17.628 --> 06:50:17.638 align:start position:0%
standards uh so I have I I'm in favor of
 
06:50:21.948 --> 06:50:21.958 align:start position:0%
of doing that and moving ahead with six
 
06:50:23.930 --> 06:50:23.940 align:start position:0%
may I respond to representative Woods
 
06:50:26.868 --> 06:50:26.878 align:start position:0%
for a moment yes you may yes and indeed
 
06:50:29.270 --> 06:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
Molly Rossignol Ed and said and Savage
 
06:50:31.850 --> 06:50:31.860 align:start position:0%
were both there and did vote for it and
 
06:50:33.770 --> 06:50:33.780 align:start position:0%
uh yes you're you're so right sudden
 
06:50:35.628 --> 06:50:35.638 align:start position:0%
totally opposed therapeutic cannabis in
 
06:50:37.610 --> 06:50:37.620 align:start position:0%
the beginning and they are extremely
 
06:50:40.850 --> 06:50:40.860 align:start position:0%
strict so that was uh that's why I was
 
06:50:42.650 --> 06:50:42.660 align:start position:0%
amazed I didn't expect this outcome at
 
06:50:43.850 --> 06:50:43.860 align:start position:0%
all thank you
 
06:50:47.270 --> 06:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
I know they're both on there and the
 
06:50:49.430 --> 06:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
fact that it was 9-0 means they had to
 
06:50:53.390 --> 06:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:55.850 --> 06:50:55.860 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
06:50:58.430 --> 06:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
let's see how we can wrestle this thing
 
06:50:58.440 --> 06:51:01.128 align:start position:0%
let's see how we can wrestle this thing
um

06:51:01.128 --> 06:51:01.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:04.390 --> 06:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:06.590 --> 06:51:06.600 align:start position:0%
by the way I think that representative
 
06:51:08.930 --> 06:51:08.940 align:start position:0%
Weber's idea is pretty good if we if we
 
06:51:10.730 --> 06:51:10.740 align:start position:0%
vote for the one with both and it passes
 
06:51:13.010 --> 06:51:13.020 align:start position:0%
we're done if it doesn't I think she's
 
06:51:15.350 --> 06:51:15.360 align:start position:0%
right oud seems to be the one people are
 
06:51:17.570 --> 06:51:17.580 align:start position:0%
stuck on more so than the visiting
 
06:51:19.788 --> 06:51:19.798 align:start position:0%
patient that we could then we would know
 
06:51:21.890 --> 06:51:21.900 align:start position:0%
that it died because of oud so I'm
 
06:51:23.330 --> 06:51:23.340 align:start position:0%
comfortable with either a straw poll or
 
06:51:26.270 --> 06:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
just going to 646 and then six four five
 
06:51:28.430 --> 06:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
six four six is you're comfortable with
 
06:51:30.430 --> 06:51:30.440 align:start position:0%
opiates and Canadians
 
06:51:33.410 --> 06:51:33.420 align:start position:0%
exits for five you're uncomfortable with
 
06:51:35.650 --> 06:51:35.660 align:start position:0%
opioids but comfortable with Canadians
 
06:51:38.030 --> 06:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
and all right I'm going to stop talking
 
06:51:38.040 --> 06:51:38.990 align:start position:0%
and all right I'm going to stop talking
now

06:51:38.990 --> 06:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
now
 
06:51:44.390 --> 06:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
um when somebody moves 646 amendments
 
06:51:44.400 --> 06:51:47.930 align:start position:0%
um when somebody moves 646 amendments

I'm going to ask my predecessor for some
 
06:54:41.150 --> 06:54:41.160 align:start position:0%
wisdom here would it be possible to
 
06:54:44.390 --> 06:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
accept both the uh Amendment we just
 
06:54:47.810 --> 06:54:47.820 align:start position:0%
looked at and representative Marsha's
 
06:54:51.948 --> 06:54:51.958 align:start position:0%
amendments and have uh OLS melt them
 
06:54:51.958 --> 06:54:56.810 align:start position:0%
amendments and have uh OLS melt them
no

06:54:56.810 --> 06:54:56.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:58.910 --> 06:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
yeah you're muted
 
06:55:02.448 --> 06:55:02.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:05.448 --> 06:55:05.458 align:start position:0%
sorry I can't offer an opinion on that
 
06:55:07.368 --> 06:55:07.378 align:start position:0%
because I can't remember what was in
 
06:55:09.948 --> 06:55:09.958 align:start position:0%
representative Marsh's Amendment uh I
 
06:55:13.430 --> 06:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
think that in the past and to be really
 
06:55:15.350 --> 06:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
safe you'd need to check this with the
 
06:55:15.360 --> 06:55:16.850 align:start position:0%
safe you'd need to check this with the
clerk

06:55:16.850 --> 06:55:16.860 align:start position:0%
clerk
 
06:55:16.860 --> 06:55:18.230 align:start position:0%
clerk
um

06:55:18.230 --> 06:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:55:20.810 --> 06:55:20.820 align:start position:0%
because I might be remembering from a
 
06:55:23.090 --> 06:55:23.100 align:start position:0%
previous clerk
 
06:55:26.350 --> 06:55:26.360 align:start position:0%
um when two amendments were not
 
06:55:28.968 --> 06:55:28.978 align:start position:0%
conflicting with each other you could
 
06:55:31.310 --> 06:55:31.320 align:start position:0%
adopt both
 
06:55:36.590 --> 06:55:36.600 align:start position:0%
um and the uh OLS would produce a third
 
06:55:39.530 --> 06:55:39.540 align:start position:0%
Amendment which combined the two
 
06:55:41.810 --> 06:55:41.820 align:start position:0%
for ease of dealing with the calendar
 
06:55:43.788 --> 06:55:43.798 align:start position:0%
because I think we only do one committee
 
06:55:47.510 --> 06:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment for the calendar uh but I I
 
06:55:48.948 --> 06:55:48.958 align:start position:0%
don't know what the subject of
 
06:55:52.010 --> 06:55:52.020 align:start position:0%
Representative Marsh's amendment is
 
06:55:55.250 --> 06:55:55.260 align:start position:0%
um if if representative Marsh wants to
 
06:55:58.490 --> 06:55:58.500 align:start position:0%
offer his Amendment that's one thing but
 
06:56:00.288 --> 06:56:00.298 align:start position:0%
we don't have to actually do anything
 
06:56:03.230 --> 06:56:03.240 align:start position:0%
with Representatives Amendment unless he
 
06:56:06.890 --> 06:56:06.900 align:start position:0%
chooses to offer it it just correct I
 
06:56:09.048 --> 06:56:09.058 align:start position:0%
just wanted to see this
 
06:56:11.868 --> 06:56:11.878 align:start position:0%
and may I speak to that too no I think
 
06:56:13.610 --> 06:56:13.620 align:start position:0%
representative Marsha is going to speak
 
06:56:15.890 --> 06:56:15.900 align:start position:0%
to his Amendment next right the the
 
06:56:18.410 --> 06:56:18.420 align:start position:0%
issue in my amendment was the issue of
 
06:56:20.270 --> 06:56:20.280 align:start position:0%
employees being protected for their
 
06:56:21.708 --> 06:56:21.718 align:start position:0%
transported candidates between
 
06:56:23.690 --> 06:56:23.700 align:start position:0%
Communications while they're on the job
 
06:56:25.730 --> 06:56:25.740 align:start position:0%
and it's my understanding that that is
 
06:56:27.948 --> 06:56:27.958 align:start position:0%
being addressed by another bill and so I
 
06:56:29.690 --> 06:56:29.700 align:start position:0%
didn't feel confused to bring its goals
 
06:56:32.990 --> 06:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
so the question is moot now
 
06:56:35.868 --> 06:56:35.878 align:start position:0%
Representative no that was all I wanted
 
06:56:38.208 --> 06:56:38.218 align:start position:0%
to say it's an SB 162 that the Senate
 
06:56:39.830 --> 06:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
Omnibus Bill it's already in there so we
 
06:56:41.690 --> 06:56:41.700 align:start position:0%
don't need 482 because it's covered in
 
06:56:44.990 --> 06:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
the Senate Bill thank you now let's see
 
06:56:47.330 --> 06:56:47.340 align:start position:0%
we've got this uh wonderful Amendment
 
06:56:51.010 --> 06:56:51.020 align:start position:0%
here to House Bill 601
 
06:56:54.288 --> 06:56:54.298 align:start position:0%
that is oh wait wait we haven't voted on
 
06:56:58.610 --> 06:56:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:00.390 --> 06:57:00.400 align:start position:0%
so we're up to an um
 
06:57:00.400 --> 06:57:02.810 align:start position:0%
so we're up to an um
[Music]

06:57:02.810 --> 06:57:02.820 align:start position:0%

07:03:06.590 --> 07:03:06.600 align:start position:0%
disagree about things but we're not
 
07:03:08.868 --> 07:03:08.878 align:start position:0%
disagreeable to each other so it's been
 
07:03:10.490 --> 07:03:10.500 align:start position:0%
an honor I've chaired committees before
 
07:03:12.590 --> 07:03:12.600 align:start position:0%

07:03:14.830 --> 07:03:14.840 align:start position:0%

07:03:17.030 --> 07:03:17.040 align:start position:0%

it's like the sheriff I'd like to share
 
07:03:29.208 --> 07:03:29.218 align:start position:0%
a story about our esteemed chairman that
 
07:03:31.310 --> 07:03:31.320 align:start position:0%
might improve his headache a little bit
 
07:03:33.948 --> 07:03:33.958 align:start position:0%
three years ago when I was hospitalized
 
07:03:36.350 --> 07:03:36.360 align:start position:0%
for an extended period of time
 
07:03:38.628 --> 07:03:38.638 align:start position:0%
and my wife was informed that they had
 
07:03:40.548 --> 07:03:40.558 align:start position:0%
to reserve the number of visitors that
 
07:03:43.788 --> 07:03:43.798 align:start position:0%
came into my room and they so they put
 
07:03:45.650 --> 07:03:45.660 align:start position:0%
you had to have a password in order to
 
07:03:47.030 --> 07:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
get into the room and all the rest of it
 
07:03:49.730 --> 07:03:49.740 align:start position:0%
and all of a sudden Mark suddenly
 
07:03:52.190 --> 07:03:52.200 align:start position:0%
appeared in the room and I said oh did
 
07:03:54.410 --> 07:03:54.420 align:start position:0%
you get the password no no no why would
 
07:03:57.830 --> 07:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
a man in a clerical caller need a
 
07:04:00.048 --> 07:04:00.058 align:start position:0%
password to get into a room at the
 
07:04:02.690 --> 07:04:02.700 align:start position:0%
Catholic Medical Center and there's a
 
07:04:04.190 --> 07:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
regular visitor to me while I was in
 
07:04:06.770 --> 07:04:06.780 align:start position:0%
hospital and always Warriors clerical
 
07:04:09.048 --> 07:04:09.058 align:start position:0%
call he does know how to get around the
 
07:04:11.350 --> 07:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
tough nurses
 
07:04:18.670 --> 07:04:18.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:21.288 --> 07:04:21.298 align:start position:0%
didn't matter they don't make that
 
07:04:23.090 --> 07:04:23.100 align:start position:0%
distinction no they don't look that
 
07:04:25.730 --> 07:04:25.740 align:start position:0%
close but I believe the representative
 
07:04:27.890 --> 07:04:27.900 align:start position:0%
snow said I'm not Catholic and I looked
 
07:04:30.530 --> 07:04:30.540 align:start position:0%
at him and I said I'm not either and
 
07:04:33.170 --> 07:04:33.180 align:start position:0%
then and after I get over being scared I
 
07:04:35.030 --> 07:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
prayed with them and we were both quite
 
07:04:37.010 --> 07:04:37.020 align:start position:0%
happy after that lo and behold he's back
 
07:04:39.548 --> 07:04:39.558 align:start position:0%
so here we are yeah
 
07:04:44.150 --> 07:04:44.160 align:start position:0%

07:04:47.030 --> 07:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
priest yeah I know that and respect that
 
07:04:50.390 --> 07:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
I I did not see it was an appropriate
 
07:04:52.670 --> 07:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
time to get into a long historical
 
07:04:55.010 --> 07:04:55.020 align:start position:0%
discussion with the
 
07:04:57.830 --> 07:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
