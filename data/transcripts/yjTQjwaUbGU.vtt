Senate Bill 311 um this is um this bill
 
00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 align:start position:0%
makes an appropriation to the Department
 
00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services and the
 
00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 align:start position:0%
town of Hamstead to offset the reduction
 
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 align:start position:0%
in taxes uh from the state's acquisition
 
00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 align:start position:0%
of Hamstead hospital um it appropriates
 
00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 align:start position:0%
154,000 in fiscal year 2025 for the
 
00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
purpose of Distributing funds to the
 
00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 align:start position:0%
town of Hamstead to offset the impacts
 
00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:30.439 align:start position:0%
on that Town's tax base from the state's
 
00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 align:start position:0%
purchase of Hamstead
 
00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 align:start position:0%
hospital um the bill requires uh DHHS uh
 
00:03:40.149 --> 00:03:40.159 align:start position:0%
to make a total payment to hset of
 
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 align:start position:0%
191,0 in fiscal year
 
00:03:46.429 --> 00:03:46.439 align:start position:0%
2025 and the remaining
 
00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 align:start position:0%
37166 would need to be allocated from
 
00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 align:start position:0%
the Department's existing Appropriations
 
00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:53.159 align:start position:0%
I would say we
 
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 align:start position:0%
um uh it was supposed to be in the
 
00:03:57.149 --> 00:03:57.159 align:start position:0%
budget otherwise I wouldn't have to be
 
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
here but it got missed out of the budget
 
00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:04.599 align:start position:0%
so um I I'm here uh submitting Senate
 
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
Bill 311 so if you have any questions I
 
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 align:start position:0%
know Nathan is back here from DHHS he
 
00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
can kind of go into a little bit more of
 
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 align:start position:0%
detail and he will come and testify to
 
00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
us any questions for Senator
 
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 align:start position:0%
birdell representative papovich Muer
 
00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you senator
 
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
for taking questions um obviously the
 
00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
bill only allocates the funds for the uh
 
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
current budget uh year is is it the
 
00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 align:start position:0%
intent to have this as a one-time
 
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 align:start position:0%
appropriation to ease the
 
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 align:start position:0%
unexpected transition of the state to
 
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 align:start position:0%
state property or is there a thought
 
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 align:start position:0%
that this should be a more long-term
 
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 align:start position:0%
appropriation I think every year it has
 
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 align:start position:0%
to like I said it was supposed to go
 
00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 align:start position:0%
into the budget um for a two-year period
 
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
so for the next um this year and I
 
00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
believe next year I will be submitting
 
00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 align:start position:0%
submitting it and then next year it'll
 
00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
go into the budget for um but we have to
 
00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:02.199 align:start position:0%
recertify it I believe every two years
 
00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions from
 
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 align:start position:0%

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 align:start position:0%

Services good morning members of the
 
00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 align:start position:0%
committee Nathan white CFO with the
 
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to provide a little bit of
 
00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
context and background just for the
 
00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
members uh on June 8th uh
 
00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:58.479 align:start position:0%
202022 the department acquired Hamstead
 
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
hospital um um in state fiscal year 2022
 
00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 align:start position:0%
the department with Governor executive
 
00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:08.039 align:start position:0%
Council approval previously made
 
00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:09.309 align:start position:0%
Council approval previously made
approximately

00:06:09.309 --> 00:06:09.319 align:start position:0%
approximately
 
00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 align:start position:0%
$176,000 payment to the town of Hamstead
 
00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
um to address the increased costs and
 
00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.080 align:start position:0%
also the loss of property tax revenue um
 
00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:21.880 align:start position:0%
I think it's important to understand
 
00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:25.759 align:start position:0%
that a town um cannot tax the state um
 
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
we the state is exempt from that in
 
00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
state fiscal year 23 we also made
 
00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.230 align:start position:0%
state fiscal year 23 we also made
another

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
$178,000 payment to the town of Hamstead
 
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
with executive Council approval and um
 
00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
the amount that you see here within the
 
00:06:59.629 --> 00:06:59.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:02.720 align:start position:0%
budget for Hamstead General funds um and
 
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
that's the difference between the
 
00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:07.479 align:start position:0%
$154,000 that's being appropriated here
 
00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:09.639 align:start position:0%
versus the total amount that the
 
00:07:12.589 --> 00:07:12.599 align:start position:0%
department will pay which is the
 
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:14.840 align:start position:0%
$191,000 to the town of Hamstead through
 
00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:16.840 align:start position:0%
an unencumbered payment
 
00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
request thank you for that explanation
 
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
representative tki for a question thank
 
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:24.120 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you Mr White we
 
00:07:26.189 --> 00:07:26.199 align:start position:0%
just heard that the state does this for
 
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
other um buildings or pieces of land
 
00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:31.919 align:start position:0%
they own um two-part question can you
 
00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
give us an example of one of those and
 
00:07:38.749 --> 00:07:38.759 align:start position:0%
number two um is that just an ongoing um
 
00:07:40.469 --> 00:07:40.479 align:start position:0%
payment that goes into the budget and
 
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
maybe it's sort of not that it's buried
 
00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:45.039 align:start position:0%
but we just don't see it as a normal um
 
00:07:48.869 --> 00:07:48.879 align:start position:0%
budgeting cycle sure so to answer your
 
00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:52.120 align:start position:0%
first question um I I would probably
 
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:53.080 align:start position:0%
defer to the Department of
 
00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:55.120 align:start position:0%
administrative services on other
 
00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:56.560 align:start position:0%
agencies that make these type of
 
00:07:58.830 --> 00:07:58.840 align:start position:0%
payments um this is the only type of
 
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
payment Within the Department of Health
 
00:08:03.309 --> 00:08:03.319 align:start position:0%
and Human Services budget um but but
 
00:08:04.309 --> 00:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
ultimately I would defer to the
 
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:06.080 align:start position:0%
Department administrative Services they
 
00:08:07.589 --> 00:08:07.599 align:start position:0%
have much better awareness what other
 
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
agencies are paying
 
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:13.560 align:start position:0%
for um when it comes to the budget uh we
 
00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:17.039 align:start position:0%
did at during the Senate phase um the
 
00:08:18.749 --> 00:08:18.759 align:start position:0%
the the Senate finance committee had
 
00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:21.560 align:start position:0%
approved an appropriation um that would
 
00:08:23.869 --> 00:08:23.879 align:start position:0%
have shown up in the current operating
 
00:08:26.029 --> 00:08:26.039 align:start position:0%
budget um that is not in the operating
 
00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
budget when we submit this when we
 
00:08:30.309 --> 00:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
submit the state agency budget for State
 
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:33.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal years 26 and 27 that will not
 
00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
necessarily be part of the efficiency
 
00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:37.880 align:start position:0%
expenditure budget or the base budget um
 
00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
that if if that was included that would
 
00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:43.919 align:start position:0%
be a prioritized need um but ultimately
 
00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:46.120 align:start position:0%
that is a a policy decision that I will
 
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
defer to all of the members of Finance
 
00:08:52.269 --> 00:08:52.279 align:start position:0%
on representative Heath for a question
 
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:54.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Cher and thank you for
 
00:08:57.269 --> 00:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
um I find it somewhat precedent setting
 
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
um I would ask does the city of
 
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
Manchester get re reimbursed for YDC
 
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:10.360 align:start position:0%
being in the city of
 
00:09:14.069 --> 00:09:14.079 align:start position:0%
Manchester do you know no
 
00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:17.480 align:start position:0%
um the city of Berlin they have a state
 
00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:20.680 align:start position:0%
prison do they get reimbursed no thank
 
00:09:22.269 --> 00:09:22.279 align:start position:0%
you very
 
00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
much F questions from committee members
 
00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:27.320 align:start position:0%
represent Petri and then represent
 
00:09:31.269 --> 00:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
Stringham thank you Mr
 
00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:33.160 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chairman and why not
 
00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:34.959 align:start position:0%
why why do you know that would be the
 
00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:37.000 align:start position:0%
next question why why doesn't those
 
00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:41.000 align:start position:0%
cities get well I I I think you have to
 
00:09:43.509 --> 00:09:43.519 align:start position:0%
look at the history uh associated with
 
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:46.240 align:start position:0%
this so um the Department of Health and
 
00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
Human Services and the state acquired
 
00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:51.640 align:start position:0%
the organization the Hamet Hospital uh
 
00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:52.670 align:start position:0%
the organization the Hamet Hospital uh
in

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:54.350 align:start position:0%
in
2022

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
2022
 
00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
um at that point in time there were
 
00:09:58.710 --> 00:09:58.720 align:start position:0%
discussions with the town during the
 
00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:01.160 align:start position:0%
acquisition process relative to the
 
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
impacts because ultimately you know this
 
00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
is going to have some impact on the on
 
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
the local Town finances um and there
 
00:10:10.069 --> 00:10:10.079 align:start position:0%
were discussions at that point in time
 
00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:12.680 align:start position:0%
um to address that through uh these
 
00:10:15.069 --> 00:10:15.079 align:start position:0%
payments um and as Senator burel
 
00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:17.720 align:start position:0%
indicated before um this payment would
 
00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:21.200 align:start position:0%
be for uh State fiscal year 25 uh for
 
00:10:24.069 --> 00:10:24.079 align:start position:0%
the remainder of this Bia um after that
 
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:25.240 align:start position:0%
point in time I think it would
 
00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:27.560 align:start position:0%
ultimately be a policy decision that the
 
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
legislature would need to decide on
 
00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:33.880 align:start position:0%
thank representative stringam for would
 
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
it be fair to call this somewhat
 
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
analogous to a payment in Le of taxes a
 
00:10:40.269 --> 00:10:40.279 align:start position:0%
pilot payment yes some people have
 
00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:42.440 align:start position:0%
referred to it as the pilot um for the
 
00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:45.160 align:start position:0%
acronym relative to that yes okay and
 
00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
and um You referred to some things
 
00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
outside of Health and Human Services uh
 
00:10:51.509 --> 00:10:51.519 align:start position:0%
since some of us just went to Glen Cliff
 
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
to the town of Warren or Benson get any
 
00:10:56.629 --> 00:10:56.639 align:start position:0%
pilot uh type payments uh for the Glen
 
00:10:58.829 --> 00:10:58.839 align:start position:0%
Cliff facility and anything for New
 
00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital for where that is uh
 
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
no not for glencliffe there's obviously
 
00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
a very long history there um dating back
 
00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:08.440 align:start position:0%
many decades um so I don't know what
 
00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:10.240 align:start position:0%
discussions occurred at that point in
 
00:11:14.069 --> 00:11:14.079 align:start position:0%
time okay and New Hampshire hospital is
 
00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if that would be
 
00:11:17.949 --> 00:11:17.959 align:start position:0%
analogous or
 
00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:20.600 align:start position:0%
not uh no New Hampshire hospital is a
 
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:22.720 align:start position:0%
little unique in the sense that our
 
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
first responder Services we have State
 
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh police um through the department of
 
00:11:28.949 --> 00:11:28.959 align:start position:0%
safety through anou with the Department
 
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
of safy
 
00:11:32.069 --> 00:11:32.079 align:start position:0%
uh through which we compensate State
 
00:11:37.829 --> 00:11:37.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
campus okay um followup followup do you
 
00:11:45.069 --> 00:11:45.079 align:start position:0%
have any um uh comments on why it's in
 
00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:47.800 align:start position:0%
the overall State interest to uh to make
 
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:55.509 --> 00:11:55.519 align:start position:0%
Hamstead you I think that question is
 
00:11:58.590 --> 00:11:58.600 align:start position:0%
starting to delve into policy and um
 
00:11:59.750 --> 00:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
again I would kind of look at the
 
00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
history here where the state acquired a
 
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:08.240 align:start position:0%
hospital um with uh not a sign acquired
 
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
a hospital midyear that has a
 
00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:11.720 align:start position:0%
significant impact on the on the local
 
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
Town's finances um and ultimately what
 
00:12:18.629 --> 00:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
what had been decided and through
 
00:12:20.389 --> 00:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
negotiations at that point in time was
 
00:12:22.389 --> 00:12:22.399 align:start position:0%
we would be we would make those payments
 
00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:23.800 align:start position:0%
which we have done for the past two
 
00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
years and as Senator burel had indicated
 
00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:29.480 align:start position:0%
Senate Finance had voted to approve this
 
00:12:30.829 --> 00:12:30.839 align:start position:0%
um into the budget obviously there's no
 
00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:33.240 align:start position:0%
committee at conference this past year
 
00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:35.800 align:start position:0%
um so there was no discussion between
 
00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:38.600 align:start position:0%
the house and the Senate on that topic
 
00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:41.000 align:start position:0%
uh but again this would this would be a
 
00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
decision for for the members thank
 
00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:46.720 align:start position:0%
you further questions for this witness
 
00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
from committee
 
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:50.720 align:start position:0%
members represent Maguire thank you Mr
 
00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:51.880 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
question what was the condition of the
 
00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
hospital when the state acquired it was
 
00:12:58.350 --> 00:12:58.360 align:start position:0%
it was it an ongoing business was it
 
00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:01.720 align:start position:0%
empty was it something sure it was owned
 
00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
and operated by a private organization
 
00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:09.629 --> 00:13:09.639 align:start position:0%
it followup so it it was full of
 
00:13:11.829 --> 00:13:11.839 align:start position:0%
patience and so on so now the the
 
00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:14.440 align:start position:0%
residents of Hampton have to go even
 
00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:15.839 align:start position:0%
further when they want to need a
 
00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
hospital is that it was a children's
 
00:13:21.629 --> 00:13:21.639 align:start position:0%
psychiatric hospital so so the the the
 
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
major difference which I believe um the
 
00:13:25.629 --> 00:13:25.639 align:start position:0%
commissioner and our Deputy Commissioner
 
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
have uh discussed with a number of
 
00:13:29.829 --> 00:13:29.839 align:start position:0%
members of various committees has been
 
00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:32.680 align:start position:0%
we we've seen a change in uh the the
 
00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
census relative to Acuity uh we are
 
00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:37.480 align:start position:0%
rather than um some of the children that
 
00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:39.160 align:start position:0%
are there now rather than being sent out
 
00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:41.519 align:start position:0%
of state um they're now being treated at
 
00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
Hamstead Hospital rather than being
 
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.069 align:start position:0%
Hamstead Hospital rather than being
moved

00:13:45.069 --> 00:13:45.079 align:start position:0%
moved
 
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
elsewhere thank
 
00:13:49.389 --> 00:13:49.399 align:start position:0%
you further for this witness then the
 
00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
next witness will probably Enlighten us
 
00:13:54.269 --> 00:13:54.279 align:start position:0%
a little more because representative
 
00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
Guthrie is also a selectman might have
 
00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
been in on some of this negotiation so
 
00:13:59.910 --> 00:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
there's no further questions for Mr
 
00:14:02.629 --> 00:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
White I'll call on representative
 
00:14:07.629 --> 00:14:07.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
Guthrie probably should have taken you
 
00:14:11.269 --> 00:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
in different
 
00:14:11.279 --> 00:14:14.670 align:start position:0%
in different
order

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:14.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:18.069 --> 00:14:18.079 align:start position:0%
morning get your red light on there you
 
00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
go thank you uh just for the record I'm
 
00:14:25.189 --> 00:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
Joe Guri uh uh representative uh from
 
00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:28.120 align:start position:0%
Hamstead and I'm here really with the
 
00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
other hat which is that I'm a selectman
 
00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:34.360 align:start position:0%
in Hamstead have been for a long time
 
00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
and I'm also a member of the planning
 
00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
board so our understanding is this is
 
00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
the only uh uh way that we can get any
 
00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
money in lure of taxes and when we
 
00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
started out that's the way we were
 
00:14:51.949 --> 00:14:51.959 align:start position:0%
were're trying to present them to the uh
 
00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
executive committee and when at the
 
00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
first time we had a payment which thank
 
00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
you very much by the way uh and this is
 
00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:04.120 align:start position:0%
a facility coming into our community uh
 
00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
in that they although they purchased the
 
00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
Hamstead Hospital in the in the very
 
00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:12.839 align:start position:0%
near future they're going to expand that
 
00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
so we see a real impact on our uh town
 
00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
and as I say this the only vehicle we
 
00:15:25.949 --> 00:15:25.959 align:start position:0%
have to uh get uh uh the the funds as a
 
00:15:29.629 --> 00:15:29.639 align:start position:0%
a tax offset if you will so uh we
 
00:15:31.829 --> 00:15:31.839 align:start position:0%
appreciate very much that you're taking
 
00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:34.240 align:start position:0%
this under consideration it came through
 
00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
the process with unanimous support uh we
 
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
think that uh it's fair that this
 
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
facility coming into our community uh
 
00:15:47.069 --> 00:15:47.079 align:start position:0%
should participate in uh assisting the
 
00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
town in the cost of uh services that we
 
00:15:54.509 --> 00:15:54.519 align:start position:0%
will provide for them having represented
 
00:15:56.189 --> 00:15:56.199 align:start position:0%
uh Hamstead at the time I believe there
 
00:15:56.199 --> 00:15:57.110 align:start position:0%
uh Hamstead at the time I believe there
was

00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:00.920 align:start position:0%
negotiations with the town by the the
 
00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:04.360 align:start position:0%
HHS to see see if it would be supported
 
00:16:06.269 --> 00:16:06.279 align:start position:0%
by the town because that's correct if it
 
00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
had not been supported by the town they
 
00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
may have gone elsewhere but one of the
 
00:16:12.069 --> 00:16:12.079 align:start position:0%
reasons the town supported it was
 
00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
because you've got a lot of acreage
 
00:16:17.069 --> 00:16:17.079 align:start position:0%
there to to do fire protection on and
 
00:16:19.189 --> 00:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
and police yes it's an it's an ideal
 
00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:21.839 align:start position:0%
place for the hospital I personally
 
00:16:24.749 --> 00:16:24.759 align:start position:0%
think the selection was good uh the only
 
00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:27.240 align:start position:0%
concern we had was the impact it was
 
00:16:29.629 --> 00:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
going to have on our community
 
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
right so I'm glad you're here with the
 
00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:35.800 align:start position:0%
experience of that negotiation any
 
00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
questions representative papich M thank
 
00:16:39.949 --> 00:16:39.959 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:16:42.829 --> 00:16:42.839 align:start position:0%
representative gri for taking questions
 
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
same question that I had for uh Senator
 
00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:47.720 align:start position:0%
berel is this meant to be a one-time
 
00:16:49.949 --> 00:16:49.959 align:start position:0%
payment to ease into the transition or
 
00:16:51.509 --> 00:16:51.519 align:start position:0%
do you see this as a permanent
 
00:16:54.069 --> 00:16:54.079 align:start position:0%
replacement for the property taxes that
 
00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
you you know would no longer be able to
 
00:16:58.949 --> 00:16:58.959 align:start position:0%
charge well because of the process
 
00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:01.240 align:start position:0%
pretty hard to forecast what's going to
 
00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:04.240 align:start position:0%
happen but my understanding is this is
 
00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:07.400 align:start position:0%
for uh a two year like a two for two
 
00:17:09.549 --> 00:17:09.559 align:start position:0%
years and then we have to go through the
 
00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:12.760 align:start position:0%
process again asking this is the only
 
00:17:15.029 --> 00:17:15.039 align:start position:0%
vehicle we have for funds and the town
 
00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:16.839 align:start position:0%
will be making that request to our
 
00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
Senator at that time thank you so just
 
00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
to confirm that I understand correctly
 
00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:23.480 align:start position:0%
it is your intent to continue seeking
 
00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:26.600 align:start position:0%
such uh Appropriations on a ongoing
 
00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:29.559 align:start position:0%
basis we hope to make the request
 
00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
thank you and hopefully it would be uh
 
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
be done if uh this goes forward thanks
 
00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:38.360 align:start position:0%
representative Petry for a question
 
00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:40.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh do you think
 
00:17:42.029 --> 00:17:42.039 align:start position:0%
that this is going to attract any other
 
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
ancillary businesses uh because of the
 
00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
facility Well that's pretty hard
 
00:17:54.029 --> 00:17:54.039 align:start position:0%
to uh to say I would say maybe it could
 
00:17:58.710 --> 00:17:58.720 align:start position:0%
very well uh we have the uh we the where
 
00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
the all to provide any Services uh
 
00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
particularly Commercial Services that
 
00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
the hospital might need but uh what will
 
00:18:09.909 --> 00:18:09.919 align:start position:0%
happen in the future if this will I
 
00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:13.320 align:start position:0%
don't see this impacting on uh any
 
00:18:17.669 --> 00:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
commercial uh interest in the in the
 
00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
town I do recall at one of the hearings
 
00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
there was a a woman that was in a butter
 
00:18:25.549 --> 00:18:25.559 align:start position:0%
that was also had the contract for
 
00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
landscaping I don't know whether that
 
00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
would continue or whether state would
 
00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
have their own employees doing care
 
00:18:33.789 --> 00:18:33.799 align:start position:0%
doing that so that that was one area
 
00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
that she was fear fearful of losing that
 
00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
contract and I guess she probably has
 
00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
yeah well I I can understand that she
 
00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:46.520 align:start position:0%
she is an a butter and uh you know it's
 
00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
a she talking about a business concern
 
00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
concern but she had a number of concerns
 
00:18:54.669 --> 00:18:54.679 align:start position:0%
being in a butter and she had
 
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
a opportunity to voice those as we went
 
00:18:59.750 --> 00:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
through the process
 
00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
y I remember that representa hacken
 
00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:04.200 align:start position:0%
Phillips thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
you representative for taking my
 
00:19:08.789 --> 00:19:08.799 align:start position:0%
question um I just want to clarify uh
 
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
one of your earlier statements about the
 
00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
negotiation period leading up to the
 
00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:16.200 align:start position:0%
acquisition by the state uh was it is it
 
00:19:17.789 --> 00:19:17.799 align:start position:0%
am I correct in understanding that you
 
00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:20.200 align:start position:0%
said the condition to
 
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
sell was um Reliant upon the state's
 
00:19:26.789 --> 00:19:26.799 align:start position:0%
ongoing commitment to to make these
 
00:19:26.799 --> 00:19:29.070 align:start position:0%
ongoing commitment to to make these
payments

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:29.080 align:start position:0%
payments
 
00:19:31.909 --> 00:19:31.919 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I don't understand was it a
 
00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:33.320 align:start position:0%
condition of the
 
00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:36.400 align:start position:0%
sale that the town would be relying upon
 
00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:40.120 align:start position:0%
the state's continued tax payments not
 
00:19:41.909 --> 00:19:41.919 align:start position:0%
my understanding it was something we had
 
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
to negotiate we had to go through the
 
00:19:47.029 --> 00:19:47.039 align:start position:0%
executive councel uh with the help of
 
00:19:48.909 --> 00:19:48.919 align:start position:0%
the Health and Human Services
 
00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner who at that time would uh
 
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
supported the request uh but uh that was
 
00:19:58.350 --> 00:19:58.360 align:start position:0%
the only vehicle we had so just a quick
 
00:19:58.360 --> 00:19:59.270 align:start position:0%
the only vehicle we had so just a quick
follow

00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
follow
 
00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:03.080 align:start position:0%
um so then the town did not make the
 
00:20:06.669 --> 00:20:06.679 align:start position:0%
decision to sell the location based on
 
00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:07.720 align:start position:0%
the understanding they would be
 
00:20:09.549 --> 00:20:09.559 align:start position:0%
reimbursed for these tax
 
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
payments uh no in fact you know it was
 
00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:16.360 align:start position:0%
just pretty almost a taking and the town
 
00:20:21.149 --> 00:20:21.159 align:start position:0%
was not involved except that we uh went
 
00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
through the Health and Human Services as
 
00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
as a as a negotiation uh after the fact
 
00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
after it was purchased but there was
 
00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
investigation as to the site and there
 
00:20:35.669 --> 00:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
was a lot of discussion about that was
 
00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
determine he hampson was the best
 
00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
location but there was no
 
00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:43.400 align:start position:0%
commitment uh in fact to tell you the
 
00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:47.080 align:start position:0%
truth we were sort of mad as hell uh if
 
00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
I could say as a town know here comes
 
00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:53.480 align:start position:0%
something uh and uh we had no way of
 
00:20:56.789 --> 00:20:56.799 align:start position:0%
reimbursing uh for we all of a sudden we
 
00:20:59.149 --> 00:20:59.159 align:start position:0%
found out we couldn't tax
 
00:21:02.149 --> 00:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
at the state so sure and just a quick
 
00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:05.720 align:start position:0%
followup Mr chair um so it's fair to say
 
00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:07.400 align:start position:0%
that the town was not a party to the
 
00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
transaction so that this contemplated
 
00:21:13.149 --> 00:21:13.159 align:start position:0%
future payment of tax reimbursement kind
 
00:21:16.789 --> 00:21:16.799 align:start position:0%
of making the town hle was not within
 
00:21:18.549 --> 00:21:18.559 align:start position:0%
the arms length negotiation of the
 
00:21:21.789 --> 00:21:21.799 align:start position:0%
actual sale itself you not the sale so
 
00:21:21.799 --> 00:21:23.230 align:start position:0%
actual sale itself you not the sale so
thank

00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:23.240 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:25.919 align:start position:0%
you representative tersi thank you Mr
 
00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative for
 
00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:29.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question can you speak briefly
 
00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:32.840 align:start position:0%
as a member of the local board um about
 
00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
the impact um of recent um necessary um
 
00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
visits to the property um by emergency
 
00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
response um and town response by police
 
00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:51.320 align:start position:0%
or ambulance I I think I heard that um
 
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
the city has had to respond to a number
 
00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
of incidents and I'm just curious if
 
00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
there is a uh price tag you might have
 
00:21:58.950 --> 00:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
for any of those
 
00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:01.720 align:start position:0%
well there have been some incidents and
 
00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:04.520 align:start position:0%
and you have to realize they just the
 
00:22:06.789 --> 00:22:06.799 align:start position:0%
state has just purchased a hospital
 
00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:08.440 align:start position:0%
that's a small part of what it's going
 
00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:11.960 align:start position:0%
to be there's going to be another large
 
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
of uh facility there uh so it's going to
 
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
expand uh and uh the state uh my
 
00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:22.600 align:start position:0%
understanding the state nearest State
 
00:22:26.909 --> 00:22:26.919 align:start position:0%
Troopers uh uh station is in eeping
 
00:22:28.789 --> 00:22:28.799 align:start position:0%
that's sometime
 
00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:31.480 align:start position:0%
you know talking about maybe a 20 minute
 
00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:33.110 align:start position:0%
you know talking about maybe a 20 minute
uh

00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh time frame to get to the hospital uh
 
00:22:44.149 --> 00:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
so in all Essences uh our own fats and
 
00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
and Fire have to have had to perform any
 
00:22:51.269 --> 00:22:51.279 align:start position:0%
services so it's almost it's a local
 
00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:54.200 align:start position:0%
facility being serviced by the local
 
00:22:57.909 --> 00:22:57.919 align:start position:0%
police and fire and followup follow up
 
00:22:59.390 --> 00:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
so just to Conn the dots though if
 
00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:01.480 align:start position:0%
there's an incident at this property
 
00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
local First Responders need to respond
 
00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:06.360 align:start position:0%
for the safety of everybody and someone
 
00:23:10.909 --> 00:23:10.919 align:start position:0%
has to pay for that I.E the town and um
 
00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:14.120 align:start position:0%
this bill would help provide NE some
 
00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:17.200 align:start position:0%
necessary funds that you know don't have
 
00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
at this point in time well I don't as
 
00:23:22.269 --> 00:23:22.279 align:start position:0%
far as I know on the time Town side
 
00:23:25.549 --> 00:23:25.559 align:start position:0%
that's has yet to be a an evaluation of
 
00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
what the impact is going to be but we
 
00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
know we've already had to put additional
 
00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
police on staff okay we've had a two
 
00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:35.480 align:start position:0%
police officers which we probably would
 
00:23:37.789 --> 00:23:37.799 align:start position:0%
not have Okay uh you know it's kind of a
 
00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
back door thing you you do something you
 
00:23:43.269 --> 00:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
say that's why you did it uh
 
00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
but they are together that we did add at
 
00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:49.880 align:start position:0%
least two police officers and we our
 
00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:51.880 align:start position:0%
rambulance servic is going to be
 
00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
stressed think the contract we have now
 
00:23:59.390 --> 00:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
went up to something like 300,000
 
00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:03.880 align:start position:0%
for ambulance service not just for for
 
00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:06.520 align:start position:0%
hamon hospital but for the town thank
 
00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:09.320 align:start position:0%
you all right thank you representa lean
 
00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
for a
 
00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:12.440 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thanks
 
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so I had served
 
00:24:17.669 --> 00:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
on a nonprofit board and we used to pay
 
00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
the municipal share of the taxes to the
 
00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
town it's like a good faith effort
 
00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
because of the impact that this uh
 
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
organization I served on had on the town
 
00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:29.640 align:start position:0%
you know if that
 
00:24:33.269 --> 00:24:33.279 align:start position:0%
$150,000 is that the entire loss of
 
00:24:36.789 --> 00:24:36.799 align:start position:0%
taxes or is it the municipal share or
 
00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:39.480 align:start position:0%
both the school and Municipal assessment
 
00:24:43.269 --> 00:24:43.279 align:start position:0%
of that property my understanding was a
 
00:24:48.549 --> 00:24:48.559 align:start position:0%
calculation of the tax rate and the uh
 
00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:51.240 align:start position:0%
uh what we were getting what what the
 
00:24:53.389 --> 00:24:53.399 align:start position:0%
value of the property was was like a
 
00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
back door thing and it was was an
 
00:24:59.669 --> 00:24:59.679 align:start position:0%
estimate uh I I can't uh really thought
 
00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:02.440 align:start position:0%
it was low I think it was when we
 
00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:05.240 align:start position:0%
originally were looking at it was over
 
00:25:08.389 --> 00:25:08.399 align:start position:0%
$200,000 but it was just a calculation
 
00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
that was made based on our tax rate and
 
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
what the impact would have been if we
 
00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
could tax it which we couldn't okay and
 
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
we have other like there's a
 
00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
organization T NOA is in our town and
 
00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:28.120 align:start position:0%
they pay us a in lure of taxes that we
 
00:25:30.789 --> 00:25:30.799 align:start position:0%
could can do that with a uh that kind of
 
00:25:33.269 --> 00:25:33.279 align:start position:0%
a concern with the state this is the
 
00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:35.960 align:start position:0%
only vehicle we have okay thanks thanks
 
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:39.360 align:start position:0%

it was uh Hamstead Hospital the largest
property

00:25:46.029 --> 00:25:46.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:46.039 --> 00:25:47.590 align:start position:0%
 
taxpayer

00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
taxpayer
 
00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
oh I know they're not they're not so but
 
00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
I don't know what the rating is but they
 
00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:55.960 align:start position:0%
would not the largest taxpayer in town
 
00:25:58.510 --> 00:25:58.520 align:start position:0%

00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:00.750 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions from
committee

00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:00.760 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:26:03.909 --> 00:26:03.919 align:start position:0%
members represent Heath thank you Mr
 
00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:07.320 align:start position:0%
chair just a quick one um do you know if
 
00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
um the New Hampshire State Police have
 
00:26:12.789 --> 00:26:12.799 align:start position:0%
you set up an agreement with them to
 
00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
help out in terms of the needs that um
 
00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
occur at Hamstead because there have
 
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
been many it seems just watching the
 
00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:23.720 align:start position:0%
television it seems like they're always
 
00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:25.640 align:start position:0%
um your local police or the state police
 
00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:27.720 align:start position:0%
are going is there an agreement with the
 
00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
state police
 
00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
to help out to mitigate your issues well
 
00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
it's in their District so I it's their
 
00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:37.480 align:start position:0%
responsibility but I there is if far
 
00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:40.480 align:start position:0%
there's no no you do one thing we'll do
 
00:26:42.389 --> 00:26:42.399 align:start position:0%
something else for you it's nothing not
 
00:26:44.389 --> 00:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
like that it's their responsibility is
 
00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
in their
 
00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
District I think there's also the
 
00:26:50.549 --> 00:26:50.559 align:start position:0%
likelihood the sheriff might be called
 
00:26:52.389 --> 00:26:52.399 align:start position:0%
Sheriff's a little closer than the state
 
00:26:53.909 --> 00:26:53.919 align:start position:0%
police but not
 
00:26:58.470 --> 00:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
much but both of them are fairly distant
 
00:27:01.149 --> 00:27:01.159 align:start position:0%
they're not in the same town three four
 
00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
towns away so further questions from
 
00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159 align:start position:0%

00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
public hear anything
 
00:34:47.829 --> 00:34:47.839 align:start position:0%
significant oh you want me to read it
 
00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
we've got time all right so this is
 
00:34:52.109 --> 00:34:52.119 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang's
 
00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
testimony this bill would use $3 million
 
00:34:56.589 --> 00:34:56.599 align:start position:0%
from the sale price of the lonia state
 
00:34:58.750 --> 00:34:58.760 align:start position:0%
school project to offset infrastructure
 
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
costs for the City of Laconia as needed
 
00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:03.240 align:start position:0%
to develop the project the project is
 
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
slated for 1,000 homes 400 of which will
 
00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
be affordable housing the goal is to
 
00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:11.560 align:start position:0%
reduce potential impact fees normally
 
00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:13.160 align:start position:0%
the city would charge the infrastructure
 
00:35:15.829 --> 00:35:15.839 align:start position:0%
costs as impact fees to the developer
 
00:35:18.349 --> 00:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
that cost in turn would be added to the
 
00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
price of the new homes the anticipated
 
00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
infrastructure cost will be both Water
 
00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:24.190 align:start position:0%
infrastructure cost will be both Water
and

00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:24.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:26.720 align:start position:0%
Sewer this is a step we can take as new
 
00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
money coming to the state currently not
 
00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:30.920 align:start position:0%
earmarked for anything in particular
 
00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
one SB 347 FN does not write a check to
 
00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
the city of lonia for $3 million instead
 
00:35:42.349 --> 00:35:42.359 align:start position:0%
the Department of administrated Services
 
00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
would hold the amount in escro the city
 
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
would then submit invoices to the
 
00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:48.040 align:start position:0%
department up to the $3 million for
 
00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:50.280 align:start position:0%
those infrastructure
 
00:35:54.750 --> 00:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
costs that's from sen langing Andrew
 
00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
Hosmer the I hope I have that pronounced
 
00:35:59.309 --> 00:35:59.319 align:start position:0%
correctly is the mayor the city of lonia
 
00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:01.240 align:start position:0%
and he testified in
 
00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:04.200 align:start position:0%
favor this is a significant project the
 
00:36:05.950 --> 00:36:05.960 align:start position:0%
parcel of land has been under State
 
00:36:09.069 --> 00:36:09.079 align:start position:0%
control for over 100 Years hopefully the
 
00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:10.760 align:start position:0%
sale will close within the next couple
 
00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:11.470 align:start position:0%
sale will close within the next couple
of

00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:11.480 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
months These funds will support over 400
 
00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
units of affordable housing similar to a
 
00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
TIF district and I don't know what that
 
00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:23.240 align:start position:0%
is tax increment funding okay it will
 
00:36:25.309 --> 00:36:25.319 align:start position:0%
only be funded once properties have been
 
00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
built and you've been able to segregate
 
00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:31.160 align:start position:0%
some funds I assume by UV he means State
 
00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:32.720 align:start position:0%
been able to segregate some funds and
 
00:36:35.349 --> 00:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
put it into the Tiff account this bill
 
00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
allows the city to do so they will
 
00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:40.720 align:start position:0%
partner with the developer and upon the
 
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
sale the proceeds would go to the
 
00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:46.520 align:start position:0%
state probably we need him here to
 
00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
really explain this this will enable the
 
00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
start of some of that infrastructure
 
00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:52.640 align:start position:0%
work that needs to be done to be done
 
00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:55.160 align:start position:0%
early the city council lonia city
 
00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
council submitted written testimony to
 
00:36:58.470 --> 00:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
members of the Comm committee I don't
 
00:37:01.109 --> 00:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
have that Senator gray inquired as of
 
00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
the state's asking price Mr Homer
 
00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
indicated it was an open bid the winning
 
00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
bid was 21.5 million state will receive
 
00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
a net of 20 million 16 million was
 
00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:13.800 align:start position:0%
allocated for another project last year
 
00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:15.560 align:start position:0%
in the budget maybe that's where Senator
 
00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
Lang is talking about the $2 million
 
00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:17.960 align:start position:0%
that they haven't figured out how to
 
00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:21.240 align:start position:0%
spend yet comes from uh Senator delandro
 
00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
stressed his concern for this project
 
00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
the closing date on the sale has been
 
00:37:27.109 --> 00:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
pushed off numerous times as we all know
 
00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:29.960 align:start position:0%
I think the bidder needs to deliver on
 
00:37:32.470 --> 00:37:32.480 align:start position:0%
what it bid it is a very valuable piece
 
00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:35.200 align:start position:0%
of property and Senator Lang again
 
00:37:36.589 --> 00:37:36.599 align:start position:0%
stated the governor and executive
 
00:37:38.109 --> 00:37:38.119 align:start position:0%
Council expect the sale to close by the
 
00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:40.280 align:start position:0%
end of January well they obviously miss
 
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
that um and they're still working on it
 
00:37:45.349 --> 00:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
in case you're not aware of this mayor
 
00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
Hosmer offered the closing was postponed
 
00:37:49.589 --> 00:37:49.599 align:start position:0%
to January 15th it's been postponed I
 
00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
think two or three times since which was
 
00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
sort of a drop dead date where they kept
 
00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
it alive from the governor executive
 
00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
councel he understands the state is not
 
00:37:59.190 --> 00:37:59.200 align:start position:0%
completed some of their obligations
 
00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:01.000 align:start position:0%
regarding due diligence the closing may
 
00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:03.400 align:start position:0%
very well get pushed into February and
 
00:38:05.589 --> 00:38:05.599 align:start position:0%
now we're here we are in April so that
 
00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
was it for the testimony there was no
 
00:38:10.829 --> 00:38:10.839 align:start position:0%
testimony opposed or or neutral thank
 
00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:12.640 align:start position:0%
you very much we now know a lot more
 
00:38:14.349 --> 00:38:14.359 align:start position:0%
than we did when we first introduce the
 
00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you um what I'll do is uh
 
00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:22.520 align:start position:0%
we'll go into recess on this bill and if
 
00:38:24.349 --> 00:38:24.359 align:start position:0%
anybody shows up that says oh oh I'm
 
00:38:26.589 --> 00:38:26.599 align:start position:0%
here for 347 we'll open that bill again
 
00:38:28.109 --> 00:38:28.119 align:start position:0%
if there's
 
00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
this time what's
 
00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:33.829 align:start position:0%
this time what's
that

00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:38:37.069 --> 00:38:37.079 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman so um I just
 
00:38:39.829 --> 00:38:39.839 align:start position:0%
wanted to briefly uh talk to the
 
00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:43.480 align:start position:0%
committee um I I handed out
 
00:38:47.069 --> 00:38:47.079 align:start position:0%
uh this piece of paper um house bills
 
00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:48.760 align:start position:0%
with significant General and education
 
00:38:52.349 --> 00:38:52.359 align:start position:0%
fund costs this is um just a subset of
 
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
of what uh Mike Kane sent you uh he had
 
00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
a more detailed spreadsheet but this
 
00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
this is sort of the big ticket items I
 
00:39:02.990 --> 00:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
believe there is one big ticket Senate
 
00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
bill yet to come which with like a $60
 
00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
million allocation for
 
00:39:14.069 --> 00:39:14.079 align:start position:0%
YDC uh for the lawsuit ass thing so um
 
00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:15.400 align:start position:0%
but the main thing I wanted to talk
 
00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:16.910 align:start position:0%
but the main thing I wanted to talk
about

00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:20.920 align:start position:0%
is how should we proceed from now
 
00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:23.720 align:start position:0%
forward because if we just sort of pass
 
00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
bills willy-nilly and not uh um and not
 
00:39:30.990 --> 00:39:31.000 align:start position:0%
have some kind of grand total I mean the
 
00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
the reason the budget
 
00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
Works to the extent it does is is we
 
00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
both pass it but then we get together
 
00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
normally and and work out the
 
00:39:43.589 --> 00:39:43.599 align:start position:0%
differences so that so that the amount
 
00:39:47.069 --> 00:39:47.079 align:start position:0%
we have meets the amount we spend but
 
00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
these are all individual bills and so we
 
00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
don't really have a mechanism for saying
 
00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
okay our you know the grand total we
 
00:39:58.470 --> 00:39:58.480 align:start position:0%
have to spend is X and and the amount of
 
00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:00.920 align:start position:0%
these bills has to be X or something
 
00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
less than x right so so my suggestion to
 
00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
the Senate and I'm not sure they've
 
00:40:10.069 --> 00:40:10.079 align:start position:0%
taken me up on it yet but is that for
 
00:40:13.109 --> 00:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
any Senate Bill we pass or any house
 
00:40:16.829 --> 00:40:16.839 align:start position:0%
bill they pass we should never pass it
 
00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:20.200 align:start position:0%
OTP we should always pass it
 
00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:24.040 align:start position:0%
otpa with some kind of an amendment and
 
00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
then um the other body should say okay
 
00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
we want a committee of conference on
 
00:40:32.829 --> 00:40:32.839 align:start position:0%
this and then in it we could have a kind
 
00:40:36.589 --> 00:40:36.599 align:start position:0%
of joint committee of conference for put
 
00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
together all the bills and talk about
 
00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
them as a group if you see what I mean
 
00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
so that that's my suggestion is if it's
 
00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
a really trivial bill right I mean if
 
00:40:49.349 --> 00:40:49.359 align:start position:0%
it's $100,000 or something that's fine
 
00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:52.720 align:start position:0%
to OTP but if it's one of these or or
 
00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:55.400 align:start position:0%
something big like that Millions then I
 
00:40:58.870 --> 00:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
think we should always OTP a you know
 
00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:01.000 align:start position:0%
obviously if we want itl that's no big
 
00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:03.880 align:start position:0%
deal right but but if we want
 
00:41:06.589 --> 00:41:06.599 align:start position:0%
OTP my suggestion is find some kind of
 
00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
an amendment and that way it it allows
 
00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:11.480 align:start position:0%
the process to continue and it allows us
 
00:41:14.910 --> 00:41:14.920 align:start position:0%
to get together with the Senate um and
 
00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:17.480 align:start position:0%
and look at the Grand totals thank you
 
00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:20.680 align:start position:0%
good good suggestion when we uh got
 
00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:23.240 align:start position:0%
finished with all the bills last
 
00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
Thursday um and that's why I was trying
 
00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
to get the uh
 
00:41:32.069 --> 00:41:32.079 align:start position:0%
the 1560 off the table so we could fund
 
00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
the ones that needed general fund which
 
00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
most of those were 25 to Zer that we
 
00:41:38.109 --> 00:41:38.119 align:start position:0%
passed out of the
 
00:41:41.309 --> 00:41:41.319 align:start position:0%
house there was 70 million that were
 
00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:43.480 align:start position:0%
only could be funded with general fund
 
00:41:45.349 --> 00:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
79 million that could be funded with
 
00:41:49.109 --> 00:41:49.119 align:start position:0%
education trust fund or general funds so
 
00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
there's 149 million there in those 40
 
00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:55.240 align:start position:0%
bills now we're looking at 22 bills of
 
00:41:58.550 --> 00:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
the 100 so I think we sent 300 107 to
 
00:41:59.790 --> 00:41:59.800 align:start position:0%
the Senate and do you remember the
 
00:42:01.829 --> 00:42:01.839 align:start position:0%
number coming back over 10
 
00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
something7 was it that high the number
 
00:42:06.430 --> 00:42:06.440 align:start position:0%
of Senate bills now in the house
 
00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
committees is 177 177 so they're you
 
00:42:12.309 --> 00:42:12.319 align:start position:0%
know somewhere around
 
00:42:16.390 --> 00:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
half so obviously if we add up all these
 
00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
bills when we get done and see what the
 
00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
uh what the totals come to and take
 
00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
another look at what is actually in in
 
00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:28.280 align:start position:0%
the Surplus and the surus us may be more
 
00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
or less than what we what we heard of a
 
00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
couple of months
 
00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:36.200 align:start position:0%
ago so we should not spend more than
 
00:42:39.829 --> 00:42:39.839 align:start position:0%
what what is there and then I suppose
 
00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:41.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to hear in fiscal on
 
00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:46.760 align:start position:0%
Friday that the spend thrifts in the
 
00:42:50.589 --> 00:42:50.599 align:start position:0%
sonunu um suit want another 60 or 70
 
00:42:50.599 --> 00:42:52.030 align:start position:0%
sonunu um suit want another 60 or 70
million

00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:52.040 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:42:56.510 --> 00:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
which unless it's coming in other fiscal
 
00:42:59.829 --> 00:42:59.839 align:start position:0%
years I don't think we can give them
 
00:43:04.270 --> 00:43:04.280 align:start position:0%
um so we got one 347 yet oh we do okay
 
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
good that was
 
00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
you thank you for filling that out so
 
00:43:12.349 --> 00:43:12.359 align:start position:0%
anyway those are the issues as I see if
 
00:43:14.829 --> 00:43:14.839 align:start position:0%
any anybody else sees any other issues I
 
00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:16.200 align:start position:0%
appreciate you bringing all that up
 
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
these are the things we're going to have
 
00:43:19.069 --> 00:43:19.079 align:start position:0%
to keep in mind as we look at these
 
00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:21.400 align:start position:0%
various bills and think of ways they
 
00:43:24.190 --> 00:43:24.200 align:start position:0%
could be reduced or could be put off
 
00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
until the next budget those are things
 
00:43:28.990 --> 00:43:29.000 align:start position:0%
we'll have to keep in mind as we go
 
00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
through all these demands for money Mr
 
00:43:33.589 --> 00:43:33.599 align:start position:0%
chairman we've already passed several
 
00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
representative member yes uh uh
 
00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:38.990 align:start position:0%
representative member yes uh uh
546

00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
546
 
00:43:42.510 --> 00:43:42.520 align:start position:0%
1583 and 1656 would be coming out of the
 
00:43:45.630 --> 00:43:45.640 align:start position:0%
educational trust fund so there there
 
00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:47.240 align:start position:0%
there are funds available for those
 
00:43:50.910 --> 00:43:50.920 align:start position:0%
three out outside of General funds the
 
00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
money will be coming in from them yes
 
00:43:55.630 --> 00:43:55.640 align:start position:0%
where's it coming from it's just trust
 
00:43:58.109 --> 00:43:58.119 align:start position:0%
fund uh the trust fund oh oh well the
 
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
education trust fund yeah that's all the
 
00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
money is that's what I say 79
 
00:44:05.069 --> 00:44:05.079 align:start position:0%
million was from education trust fund of
 
00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
the bills we passed Thursday but 70
 
00:44:09.470 --> 00:44:09.480 align:start position:0%
million was from the general fund right
 
00:44:11.349 --> 00:44:11.359 align:start position:0%
I when when we began all that
 
00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
anticipation we were going as high as
 
00:44:16.109 --> 00:44:16.119 align:start position:0%
200 million because we believed that was
 
00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:19.160 align:start position:0%
the Surplus and so we were kind of
 
00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
massaging all those bills to get it
 
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
under that 200 million and uh we were
 
00:44:26.069 --> 00:44:26.079 align:start position:0%
successful but now we've got to be faced
 
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
with what's coming up next and as
 
00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire points out these
 
00:44:33.109 --> 00:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
are all going to be negotiated things
 
00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:35.720 align:start position:0%
and uh we're going to go over to the
 
00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
senate make sure that they don't just
 
00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
because I had a brief conversation with
 
00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:41.800 align:start position:0%
with the chairman of the Senate Finance
 
00:44:43.309 --> 00:44:43.319 align:start position:0%
which was unsatisfactory I don't know if
 
00:44:46.109 --> 00:44:46.119 align:start position:0%
he serious I said we're sending you a
 
00:44:47.470 --> 00:44:47.480 align:start position:0%
bunch of bills you want to discuss them
 
00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
we'll just kill them
 
00:44:52.549 --> 00:44:52.559 align:start position:0%
all that's the kind of reaction we have
 
00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
then we can do the same over here we
 
00:44:55.630 --> 00:44:55.640 align:start position:0%
could do the
 
00:44:58.750 --> 00:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
same but
 
00:45:01.349 --> 00:45:01.359 align:start position:0%
all right if there's nothing further on
 
00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
347 or on the process going forward
 
00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
we'll take a break until 11:00 when
 
00:45:10.549 --> 00:45:10.559 align:start position:0%
we'll be looking for Senate's Bill
 
00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
393 again I I'll put out one call for
 
00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 347 anybody wishes to
 
00:45:18.349 --> 00:45:18.359 align:start position:0%
testify on that otherwise we'll recess
 
00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
it until sometime later today and if
 
00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:25.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:55.910 align:start position:0%

22 serving the communities of pelum
 
01:02:19.710 --> 01:02:19.720 align:start position:0%
Salem ACC and plastow I'm I'm here as
 
01:02:21.430 --> 01:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor to introduce Senate
 
01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:23.109 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor to introduce Senate
Bill

01:02:23.109 --> 01:02:23.119 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:02:25.549 --> 01:02:25.559 align:start position:0%
393 many of you may be familiar with the
 
01:02:25.559 --> 01:02:26.349 align:start position:0%
393 many of you may be familiar with the
water

01:02:26.349 --> 01:02:26.359 align:start position:0%
water
 
01:02:28.150 --> 01:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
you know infrastructure projects that
 
01:02:30.349 --> 01:02:30.359 align:start position:0%
been done in Southern New Hampshire over
 
01:02:33.109 --> 01:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
the last few years uh as written it's
 
01:02:35.789 --> 01:02:35.799 align:start position:0%
really this is for phase two of that
 
01:02:38.349 --> 01:02:38.359 align:start position:0%
project uh phase one and to the credit
 
01:02:41.069 --> 01:02:41.079 align:start position:0%
of when phase one was done a lot of the
 
01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh piping that was laid was done in
 
01:02:44.910 --> 01:02:44.920 align:start position:0%
anticipation of phase two you really
 
01:02:46.190 --> 01:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have had a phase one without a
 
01:02:49.349 --> 01:02:49.359 align:start position:0%
two so a we did there was a lot of cost
 
01:02:52.230 --> 01:02:52.240 align:start position:0%
savings there but right now what uh I
 
01:02:54.309 --> 01:02:54.319 align:start position:0%
know for at least Salem the water rights
 
01:02:55.910 --> 01:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
have already been purchased uh it's
 
01:02:56.990 --> 01:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
really just completing the
 
01:02:58.950 --> 01:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
infrastructure uh that would deliver to
 
01:03:00.789 --> 01:03:00.799 align:start position:0%
that Community 1.2 million gallons of
 
01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
water per day uh this could also service
 
01:03:06.549 --> 01:03:06.559 align:start position:0%
Hamstead ainson plasta would benefit
 
01:03:09.109 --> 01:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
obviously Dairy would have benefits as
 
01:03:13.029 --> 01:03:13.039 align:start position:0%
well and there's a lot wind HX would uh
 
01:03:14.670 --> 01:03:14.680 align:start position:0%
could potentially receive benefits too I
 
01:03:17.029 --> 01:03:17.039 align:start position:0%
know they weren't as receptive of the
 
01:03:20.470 --> 01:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
potential of water in initially but I
 
01:03:23.269 --> 01:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
hear they're warming up to it but when
 
01:03:26.269 --> 01:03:26.279 align:start position:0%
it comes to water supply you know you
 
01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
hear a lot about housing and you hear a
 
01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
lot about ways we can improve our
 
01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
infrastructure you can't do that without
 
01:03:34.190 --> 01:03:34.200 align:start position:0%
utilities you can't do without energy
 
01:03:37.630 --> 01:03:37.640 align:start position:0%
you can't do without water you it it's a
 
01:03:41.910 --> 01:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
necessary uh part of the the future so
 
01:03:44.309 --> 01:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
in Salem I you we take a lot of pride in
 
01:03:46.750 --> 01:03:46.760 align:start position:0%
saying this we led the way in Housing
 
01:03:48.510 --> 01:03:48.520 align:start position:0%
Development throughout the state but
 
01:03:50.390 --> 01:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
part of it is is to continue those
 
01:03:53.390 --> 01:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
efforts you do need utilities uh right
 
01:03:56.190 --> 01:03:56.200 align:start position:0%
now uh our two main water sour forces
 
01:03:59.029 --> 01:03:59.039 align:start position:0%
are cany Lake and Arlington Pond you
 
01:04:01.390 --> 01:04:01.400 align:start position:0%
know in the summertime is when Cy lake
 
01:04:03.470 --> 01:04:03.480 align:start position:0%
is drawn from that's a that's a natural
 
01:04:05.750 --> 01:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
spring Fred Lake and then Arlington pond
 
01:04:07.309 --> 01:04:07.319 align:start position:0%
it's a man-made lake normally in the
 
01:04:09.589 --> 01:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
winter time switch over uh there's been
 
01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
some contamination issues with um
 
01:04:15.230 --> 01:04:15.240 align:start position:0%
Arlington Pond the new guidelines from
 
01:04:17.269 --> 01:04:17.279 align:start position:0%
the federal government with with pasas
 
01:04:19.430 --> 01:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
aside which my understanding is the
 
01:04:21.029 --> 01:04:21.039 align:start position:0%
levels are around six to eight parts per
 
01:04:23.950 --> 01:04:23.960 align:start position:0%
trillion they just came out with a um
 
01:04:25.710 --> 01:04:25.720 align:start position:0%
saying otherwi that four parts per
 
01:04:27.789 --> 01:04:27.799 align:start position:0%
trillions is a problem but that issue
 
01:04:30.069 --> 01:04:30.079 align:start position:0%
aside you had a cal bacteria problem as
 
01:04:32.670 --> 01:04:32.680 align:start position:0%
well uh residents could not swim in that
 
01:04:35.069 --> 01:04:35.079 align:start position:0%
Lake for most of the summer and I
 
01:04:36.630 --> 01:04:36.640 align:start position:0%
believe they were delayed when we
 
01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
switched over to that water supply and
 
01:04:42.190 --> 01:04:42.200 align:start position:0%
we normally would do that around mid
 
01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
October we actually delayed it and the
 
01:04:45.990 --> 01:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
reason for that we were able to delay
 
01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
the switching over because of the Heavy
 
01:04:50.190 --> 01:04:50.200 align:start position:0%
Rain Cy Blake's levels were at a
 
01:04:53.269 --> 01:04:53.279 align:start position:0%
sufficient level um however one of the
 
01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
concerns was is whether there was even
 
01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
an ability to filter something that
 
01:04:57.630 --> 01:04:57.640 align:start position:0%
water now the cause of the sin bacteria
 
01:05:00.190 --> 01:05:00.200 align:start position:0%
problem there's a several factors that
 
01:05:03.069 --> 01:05:03.079 align:start position:0%
contribute to that one of them uh I
 
01:05:05.309 --> 01:05:05.319 align:start position:0%
understand there's no uh Municipal uh
 
01:05:07.309 --> 01:05:07.319 align:start position:0%
services in respect to water or sore up
 
01:05:09.230 --> 01:05:09.240 align:start position:0%
in that part of town we call that North
 
01:05:11.150 --> 01:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
Salem where I live and I'm not saying
 
01:05:13.269 --> 01:05:13.279 align:start position:0%
that there an appetite to you know put
 
01:05:15.710 --> 01:05:15.720 align:start position:0%
those Services there however we don't
 
01:05:17.430 --> 01:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
have a sufficient Supply to even do that
 
01:05:19.230 --> 01:05:19.240 align:start position:0%
if we wanted to it's not even a
 
01:05:22.430 --> 01:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
conversation to have you can't do it um
 
01:05:24.430 --> 01:05:24.440 align:start position:0%
I know with some of the development
 
01:05:27.109 --> 01:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
we've done we been very fortunate but to
 
01:05:29.230 --> 01:05:29.240 align:start position:0%
continue and finish off a lot of this
 
01:05:31.309 --> 01:05:31.319 align:start position:0%
having a sufficient water supply is
 
01:05:33.470 --> 01:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
necessary um if anything ever happened
 
01:05:35.589 --> 01:05:35.599 align:start position:0%
with cany Lake which my understanding is
 
01:05:38.029 --> 01:05:38.039 align:start position:0%
the uh pest levels in there again when
 
01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
they're not alarmingly high but they're
 
01:05:41.670 --> 01:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
over that four part per trillion and
 
01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
that's the main main water supply uh for
 
01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:46.520 align:start position:0%
the summer months but again you know
 
01:05:48.470 --> 01:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
living I live on that body of water I
 
01:05:50.750 --> 01:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
see how low it can get drawn down if you
 
01:05:53.510 --> 01:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
have a drought season so there
 
01:05:55.950 --> 01:05:55.960 align:start position:0%
are as there water short shortage I
 
01:05:58.430 --> 01:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
would say no but it wouldn't take much
 
01:05:59.829 --> 01:05:59.839 align:start position:0%
for for that to really come to a
 
01:06:02.230 --> 01:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
realization but I think when it comes to
 
01:06:03.670 --> 01:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
Future developments really in Southern
 
01:06:05.829 --> 01:06:05.839 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire you can't we cannot
 
01:06:07.589 --> 01:06:07.599 align:start position:0%
continue to do it without the water now
 
01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
there is a uh I did email the committee
 
01:06:13.630 --> 01:06:13.640 align:start position:0%
last night of a suggested Amendment uh
 
01:06:15.950 --> 01:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
so phase two there's a lot of in some
 
01:06:17.150 --> 01:06:17.160 align:start position:0%
brighter Minds we'll talk about the
 
01:06:19.829 --> 01:06:19.839 align:start position:0%
price tags of how that phase could be
 
01:06:22.069 --> 01:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
done there was some thought of perhaps
 
01:06:25.069 --> 01:06:25.079 align:start position:0%
breaking phase two into you know 2 a 2 B
 
01:06:27.390 --> 01:06:27.400 align:start position:0%
and 2C to break it up over time this
 
01:06:28.990 --> 01:06:29.000 align:start position:0%
project is going to take several years
 
01:06:31.230 --> 01:06:31.240 align:start position:0%
so perhaps we what we don't want to have
 
01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
it happen is we sit here in kind of as
 
01:06:35.710 --> 01:06:35.720 align:start position:0%
stalemate waiting around and not doing
 
01:06:38.109 --> 01:06:38.119 align:start position:0%
anything while meanwhile when you have a
 
01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:39.839 align:start position:0%
problem you can't say we didn't know
 
01:06:42.750 --> 01:06:42.760 align:start position:0%
about it so we have an opportunity now
 
01:06:44.789 --> 01:06:44.799 align:start position:0%
to get ahead of things and make sure
 
01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
that there's a sufficient water for
 
01:06:48.829 --> 01:06:48.839 align:start position:0%
everyone uh there's some talks about
 
01:06:50.150 --> 01:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
some raising the lake level in
 
01:06:51.630 --> 01:06:51.640 align:start position:0%
Manchester I know there's a lot of lot
 
01:06:53.470 --> 01:06:53.480 align:start position:0%
of moving Parts here and there's some
 
01:06:55.109 --> 01:06:55.119 align:start position:0%
better Minds that can speak on this than
 
01:06:55.119 --> 01:06:56.190 align:start position:0%
better Minds that can speak on this than
myself

01:06:56.190 --> 01:06:56.200 align:start position:0%
myself
 
01:06:58.990 --> 01:06:59.000 align:start position:0%
but I will say that uh when it comes to
 
01:07:00.430 --> 01:07:00.440 align:start position:0%
Future developments at least in Southern
 
01:07:02.910 --> 01:07:02.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I think investing in
 
01:07:04.670 --> 01:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that includes clean
 
01:07:06.589 --> 01:07:06.599 align:start position:0%
drinking water is a necessity so and
 
01:07:07.829 --> 01:07:07.839 align:start position:0%
I'll take any
 
01:07:10.589 --> 01:07:10.599 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Senator questions
 
01:07:14.589 --> 01:07:14.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:17.390 --> 01:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
abbis Senator Petri then representative
 
01:07:19.710 --> 01:07:19.720 align:start position:0%
Petri then representative Emer you
 
01:07:22.750 --> 01:07:22.760 align:start position:0%
go good morning thank you Mr chairman uh
 
01:07:24.990 --> 01:07:25.000 align:start position:0%
good morning Senator nais my old
 
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.750 align:start position:0%
good morning Senator nais my old
seatmate

01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
seatmate
 
01:07:30.109 --> 01:07:30.119 align:start position:0%
and uh is there already a program to
 
01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
help uh municipalities to uh take care
 
01:07:36.710 --> 01:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
of the water
 
01:07:39.190 --> 01:07:39.200 align:start position:0%
situations so there's some when it comes
 
01:07:41.069 --> 01:07:41.079 align:start position:0%
to now just to clarify you talk about
 
01:07:44.029 --> 01:07:44.039 align:start position:0%
cleaning contaminated water or no this
 
01:07:47.309 --> 01:07:47.319 align:start position:0%
is this is Municipal Water new new
 
01:07:48.910 --> 01:07:48.920 align:start position:0%
sources when when
 
01:07:53.349 --> 01:07:53.359 align:start position:0%
it well goes dry they you know they uh
 
01:07:55.670 --> 01:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
have to find a new well and the whole I
 
01:07:58.510 --> 01:07:58.520 align:start position:0%
our our town is going through the same
 
01:08:00.589 --> 01:08:00.599 align:start position:0%
thing right now and we I don't think we
 
01:08:03.230 --> 01:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
got $25 million from the state to help
 
01:08:05.230 --> 01:08:05.240 align:start position:0%
us out
 
01:08:08.430 --> 01:08:08.440 align:start position:0%
so the issues is is when this project
 
01:08:11.230 --> 01:08:11.240 align:start position:0%
was done in the first place uh you had
 
01:08:13.150 --> 01:08:13.160 align:start position:0%
several you two phases to it the first
 
01:08:15.390 --> 01:08:15.400 align:start position:0%
phase was already done and the water
 
01:08:18.149 --> 01:08:18.159 align:start position:0%
rights were purchased by each community
 
01:08:20.550 --> 01:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
that choose that was part of the project
 
01:08:22.630 --> 01:08:22.640 align:start position:0%
so that was paid for at the local level
 
01:08:24.709 --> 01:08:24.719 align:start position:0%
and then a lot of the money that went
 
01:08:26.910 --> 01:08:26.920 align:start position:0%
into this it was was Federal funding and
 
01:08:29.030 --> 01:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
the suggested Amendment does divide it
 
01:08:31.070 --> 01:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
up between the general fund and some
 
01:08:32.709 --> 01:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
Chan uh some opportunities for federal
 
01:08:34.590 --> 01:08:34.600 align:start position:0%
money as well that we're trying to work
 
01:08:36.590 --> 01:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
out here but this is a when I said
 
01:08:38.070 --> 01:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
there's an opportunity not because
 
01:08:40.070 --> 01:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
you're well went dry that we're not
 
01:08:41.630 --> 01:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
talking about one or two properties here
 
01:08:44.110 --> 01:08:44.120 align:start position:0%
we're talking about an entire region the
 
01:08:46.829 --> 01:08:46.839 align:start position:0%
water supply and not just the wells
 
01:08:49.149 --> 01:08:49.159 align:start position:0%
going dry it's we're talking about
 
01:08:51.510 --> 01:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
future developments future housing to
 
01:08:53.390 --> 01:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
really get into that and to really make
 
01:08:55.470 --> 01:08:55.480 align:start position:0%
a commitment to that it's really hard to
 
01:08:57.510 --> 01:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
to have that conversation without a
 
01:08:59.309 --> 01:08:59.319 align:start position:0%
guarantee that those resources will be
 
01:09:01.309 --> 01:09:01.319 align:start position:0%
available I understand not every
 
01:09:03.950 --> 01:09:03.960 align:start position:0%
Community has an appetite for housing
 
01:09:06.070 --> 01:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
developments and all that Southern New
 
01:09:08.070 --> 01:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Salem where I live has shown
 
01:09:10.349 --> 01:09:10.359 align:start position:0%
that appetite but to continue that
 
01:09:13.870 --> 01:09:13.880 align:start position:0%
progress forward without uh Assurance of
 
01:09:16.149 --> 01:09:16.159 align:start position:0%
having the resources available would be
 
01:09:18.309 --> 01:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
irresponsible there would be some you
 
01:09:20.229 --> 01:09:20.239 align:start position:0%
would eventually hit a wall there so
 
01:09:22.070 --> 01:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
there's also you know contamination
 
01:09:24.430 --> 01:09:24.440 align:start position:0%
issues there's there's funds right now
 
01:09:27.470 --> 01:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
set up um at the state level where you
 
01:09:28.789 --> 01:09:28.799 align:start position:0%
can get some money through some
 
01:09:30.749 --> 01:09:30.759 align:start position:0%
contamination issues but the total Phase
 
01:09:33.630 --> 01:09:33.640 align:start position:0%
2 project we're talking can be around 30
 
01:09:36.309 --> 01:09:36.319 align:start position:0%
to $40 million uh that's why breaking up
 
01:09:39.829 --> 01:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
over several um several installment uh
 
01:09:41.470 --> 01:09:41.480 align:start position:0%
making phase two basically three parts
 
01:09:43.709 --> 01:09:43.719 align:start position:0%
might be the best way to go followup
 
01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
follow up all right um yeah now I lost
 
01:09:49.590 --> 01:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
my train of thought boy that's that's
 
01:09:50.910 --> 01:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
bad that was my
 
01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
goal keep talking to you
 
01:09:56.790 --> 01:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
forget that that was a goal
 
01:10:00.910 --> 01:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
okay uh okay I'll pass representative
 
01:10:03.830 --> 01:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
Emer for a question yes uh Mike my
 
01:10:07.630 --> 01:10:07.640 align:start position:0%
community is serviced by a private water
 
01:10:10.550 --> 01:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
provider are these grants Andor loans
 
01:10:14.350 --> 01:10:14.360 align:start position:0%
available to private water
 
01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
suppliers I'm not sure to the answer
 
01:10:17.830 --> 01:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
answer to that but I can I can look in
 
01:10:21.030 --> 01:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
and try to get a I I think what what it
 
01:10:22.910 --> 01:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
the overall is really for the it's the
 
01:10:24.750 --> 01:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
infrastructure as a whole I don't I
 
01:10:26.189 --> 01:10:26.199 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
01:10:28.669 --> 01:10:28.679 align:start position:0%
if the private developer can apply for
 
01:10:30.790 --> 01:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
that that's that I can't
 
01:10:34.790 --> 01:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
answer thank you do you remember I
 
01:10:37.470 --> 01:10:37.480 align:start position:0%
remember Mr chairman uh where's this
 
01:10:40.630 --> 01:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
money coming from so the suggested
 
01:10:43.669 --> 01:10:43.679 align:start position:0%
Amendment does leave some money uh it's
 
01:10:44.830 --> 01:10:44.840 align:start position:0%
for some federal funding It's a
 
01:10:46.750 --> 01:10:46.760 align:start position:0%
combination of that and then you have
 
01:10:48.950 --> 01:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
the uh trust fund already that's set up
 
01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
with some of the M relating to Pas
 
01:10:53.189 --> 01:10:53.199 align:start position:0%
contamination which I will say just
 
01:10:55.470 --> 01:10:55.480 align:start position:0%
recently the guidelines that came out by
 
01:10:58.030 --> 01:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
the feds would put both of Salem's Water
 
01:11:00.630 --> 01:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
Supplies over that four parts per
 
01:11:03.590 --> 01:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
trillion uh we are asking for some some
 
01:11:08.350 --> 01:11:08.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:11.390 --> 01:11:11.400 align:start position:0%
well representative Abel yes thank you
 
01:11:13.590 --> 01:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Senator I could you
 
01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
clarify how phase one was
 
01:11:20.110 --> 01:11:20.120 align:start position:0%
funded of the project I think I think
 
01:11:22.270 --> 01:11:22.280 align:start position:0%
most of that came from the the trust
 
01:11:24.750 --> 01:11:24.760 align:start position:0%
fund in the first place I'm not 100% on
 
01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
where it all came from um this was
 
01:11:28.830 --> 01:11:28.840 align:start position:0%
something that uh Senator Morris really
 
01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
championed as when he was in the Senate
 
01:11:33.830 --> 01:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
and got this going and now this is the
 
01:11:36.870 --> 01:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
next phase so to me I think it's a an
 
01:11:38.950 --> 01:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
obligation to carry that through but I
 
01:11:42.110 --> 01:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
know when that trust fund that we have
 
01:11:45.790 --> 01:11:45.800 align:start position:0%
now with a lot of the PS U money goes I
 
01:11:47.110 --> 01:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
believe some of it came from there is
 
01:11:48.669 --> 01:11:48.679 align:start position:0%
that it's the commission that uh
 
01:11:53.350 --> 01:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:56.229 --> 01:11:56.239 align:start position:0%
of Representative camell for question
 
01:11:57.790 --> 01:11:57.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you Senator
 
01:11:59.790 --> 01:11:59.800 align:start position:0%
abis for taking the question um the
 
01:12:01.629 --> 01:12:01.639 align:start position:0%
federal funds that you mentioned that
 
01:12:04.990 --> 01:12:05.000 align:start position:0%
may be available are they tied to or
 
01:12:07.390 --> 01:12:07.400 align:start position:0%
dependent upon us giving you money from
 
01:12:10.709 --> 01:12:10.719 align:start position:0%
the state so thank you for the question
 
01:12:11.950 --> 01:12:11.960 align:start position:0%
I think it's the other way around I
 
01:12:14.070 --> 01:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
think we actually have to pass this
 
01:12:16.510 --> 01:12:16.520 align:start position:0%
first they go to them and ask them for
 
01:12:18.750 --> 01:12:18.760 align:start position:0%
money to set it aside on the condition
 
01:12:21.550 --> 01:12:21.560 align:start position:0%
that we pass legislation that's not how
 
01:12:24.030 --> 01:12:24.040 align:start position:0%
it would work I know there's been a lot
 
01:12:26.030 --> 01:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
of effort on on from a lot of different
 
01:12:27.709 --> 01:12:27.719 align:start position:0%
individuals contacting our federal
 
01:12:30.070 --> 01:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
delegation to try to get some commitment
 
01:12:32.470 --> 01:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
on what can be done because again we
 
01:12:34.110 --> 01:12:34.120 align:start position:0%
hear about housing we keep hearing about
 
01:12:35.270 --> 01:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
this and they keep talking about how
 
01:12:37.310 --> 01:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
everyone wants to help and and I'm
 
01:12:40.669 --> 01:12:40.679 align:start position:0%
telling you one way to to do that we
 
01:12:42.990 --> 01:12:43.000 align:start position:0%
need to have the municipal Services the
 
01:12:45.149 --> 01:12:45.159 align:start position:0%
communities that aren't interested in
 
01:12:46.629 --> 01:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
putting these housing developments there
 
01:12:48.229 --> 01:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
I mean that's that's a local control
 
01:12:50.590 --> 01:12:50.600 align:start position:0%
issue that they make that choice but
 
01:12:51.790 --> 01:12:51.800 align:start position:0%
when you have communities that are
 
01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
buying into that and are actually
 
01:12:55.990 --> 01:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
contributing towards making more housing
 
01:12:58.750 --> 01:12:58.760 align:start position:0%
I mean Salem Alone um I can't give you
 
01:13:00.030 --> 01:13:00.040 align:start position:0%
the exact amount but we you know they're
 
01:13:01.990 --> 01:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
building 300 units right now they've
 
01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
already built I would say close to a
 
01:13:07.229 --> 01:13:07.239 align:start position:0%
thousand units on top of single family
 
01:13:09.310 --> 01:13:09.320 align:start position:0%
homes you know they just approved the
 
01:13:11.149 --> 01:13:11.159 align:start position:0%
planning board just approved another six
 
01:13:12.629 --> 01:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
units to go across the street from the
 
01:13:14.510 --> 01:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
Tuscan Village so we're doing our end in
 
01:13:17.270 --> 01:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
that Community but at the same time I
 
01:13:19.470 --> 01:13:19.480 align:start position:0%
think keeping those Municipal Services
 
01:13:21.590 --> 01:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
is is needed and there's a lot of
 
01:13:24.189 --> 01:13:24.199 align:start position:0%
benefit that the state as a whole gets
 
01:13:26.310 --> 01:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
from that I mean the increased in
 
01:13:28.910 --> 01:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
economic activity that leads to more
 
01:13:30.590 --> 01:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
revenue from all whether it's rooms and
 
01:13:32.709 --> 01:13:32.719 align:start position:0%
meals tax whether it's people coming
 
01:13:34.390 --> 01:13:34.400 align:start position:0%
here for you know business profits tax
 
01:13:35.950 --> 01:13:35.960 align:start position:0%
there's a lot that goes into that
 
01:13:38.590 --> 01:13:38.600 align:start position:0%
obviously the property taxes both at the
 
01:13:40.790 --> 01:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
state and federal uh state and local
 
01:13:42.590 --> 01:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
level there's a lot of different
 
01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
benefits the state has but to continue
 
01:13:47.310 --> 01:13:47.320 align:start position:0%
to ask communities to do it without
 
01:13:48.910 --> 01:13:48.920 align:start position:0%
without sufficient resources I I don't
 
01:13:50.350 --> 01:13:50.360 align:start position:0%
know I don't see that going forward
 
01:13:53.790 --> 01:13:53.800 align:start position:0%
anymore thank you representative papich
 
01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
M thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:13:57.750 --> 01:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
senator for uh answering questions and
 
01:13:57.760 --> 01:13:58.750 align:start position:0%
senator for uh answering questions and
for

01:13:58.750 --> 01:13:58.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:14:02.669 --> 01:14:02.679 align:start position:0%
testifying um I'm trying to better
 
01:14:04.310 --> 01:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
understand the equity right investments
 
01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:05.110 align:start position:0%
understand the equity right investments
in

01:14:05.110 --> 01:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:14:07.470 --> 01:14:07.480 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that are paid from State
 
01:14:09.669 --> 01:14:09.679 align:start position:0%
money should try to you know benefit the
 
01:14:12.030 --> 01:14:12.040 align:start position:0%
state overall and obviously building a
 
01:14:15.189 --> 01:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
water pipeline is a you know Regional
 
01:14:15.199 --> 01:14:16.550 align:start position:0%
water pipeline is a you know Regional
project

01:14:16.550 --> 01:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
project
 
01:14:19.229 --> 01:14:19.239 align:start position:0%
right in terms of community support you
 
01:14:20.990 --> 01:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
know being from wiam I haven't really
 
01:14:23.270 --> 01:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
monitored this closely but yeah I would
 
01:14:25.669 --> 01:14:25.679 align:start position:0%
probably bet that as the low standards
 
01:14:28.430 --> 01:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
on pasas come lower and lower there will
 
01:14:31.070 --> 01:14:31.080 align:start position:0%
be more of an appetite but I'm trying to
 
01:14:32.709 --> 01:14:32.719 align:start position:0%
understand communities like that have
 
01:14:34.550 --> 01:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
been hugely affected you know like in
 
01:14:37.510 --> 01:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
the merac area do they have access to
 
01:14:39.590 --> 01:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
the same resources you know what what
 
01:14:41.430 --> 01:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
can we do for other parts of the state
 
01:14:44.189 --> 01:14:44.199 align:start position:0%
so that everybody has you know similar
 
01:14:46.950 --> 01:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
opportunities there is a way to argue
 
01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
that you know higher density communities
 
01:14:50.430 --> 01:14:50.440 align:start position:0%
need water first because they are more
 
01:14:52.910 --> 01:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
likely to strain their local Water
 
01:14:54.709 --> 01:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
Supplies but just what are your thoughts
 
01:14:54.719 --> 01:14:55.550 align:start position:0%
Supplies but just what are your thoughts
on

01:14:55.550 --> 01:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:14:59.070 --> 01:14:59.080 align:start position:0%
this whole picture for the state so you
 
01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
said it well when you said it's a
 
01:15:02.510 --> 01:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
regional project meaning if you're
 
01:15:03.910 --> 01:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
asking let's say you want Salem OR
 
01:15:06.270 --> 01:15:06.280 align:start position:0%
Windham or one town to really pay into
 
01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
it the problem is this pipeline it
 
01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
coming out from Manchester it's going
 
01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
all the way down comes through dairy uh
 
01:15:16.350 --> 01:15:16.360 align:start position:0%
you need the communities to buy into it
 
01:15:19.629 --> 01:15:19.639 align:start position:0%
which is one part of it so when it comes
 
01:15:21.910 --> 01:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
to where that this should go I know
 
01:15:25.030 --> 01:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
right now when it comes you know Hudson
 
01:15:27.870 --> 01:15:27.880 align:start position:0%
London der also had some issues you know
 
01:15:29.950 --> 01:15:29.960 align:start position:0%
there this project and I think some
 
01:15:31.590 --> 01:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
other people that will testify after me
 
01:15:33.669 --> 01:15:33.679 align:start position:0%
can talk really about the details of
 
01:15:36.110 --> 01:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
this but there's not a single community
 
01:15:38.870 --> 01:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have the opportunity to get
 
01:15:41.709 --> 01:15:41.719 align:start position:0%
relief from the state in trying to deal
 
01:15:44.070 --> 01:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
with their water supply issues but again
 
01:15:46.229 --> 01:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
this takes a commitment from a lot of
 
01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
different uh people and entities because
 
01:15:51.590 --> 01:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
it you you need the water supply you
 
01:15:53.270 --> 01:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
need the developers you need the
 
01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
community appetite and then also people
 
01:15:56.470 --> 01:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
want to know what the what's the water
 
01:15:58.030 --> 01:15:58.040 align:start position:0%
going to be used for people aren't going
 
01:15:59.950 --> 01:15:59.960 align:start position:0%
to just send a water supply without any
 
01:16:02.229 --> 01:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
direction what's happening with that
 
01:16:03.790 --> 01:16:03.800 align:start position:0%
water I mean so I think they're trying
 
01:16:06.310 --> 01:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
to Target and balance that out uh Salem
 
01:16:09.070 --> 01:16:09.080 align:start position:0%
we we have a population of over 30,000
 
01:16:11.310 --> 01:16:11.320 align:start position:0%
people all right and we're we're still
 
01:16:13.189 --> 01:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
growing I mean I said 300 units are
 
01:16:15.310 --> 01:16:15.320 align:start position:0%
being uh they're building that as as we
 
01:16:18.149 --> 01:16:18.159 align:start position:0%
speak now so again we're we're we're
 
01:16:20.590 --> 01:16:20.600 align:start position:0%
growing as a town but I mean wind him's
 
01:16:22.910 --> 01:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
grown a lot significantly um I know
 
01:16:25.910 --> 01:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
Dairy is grown and not not quite the
 
01:16:28.629 --> 01:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
same rate as Salem um now Hamet and
 
01:16:30.510 --> 01:16:30.520 align:start position:0%
ainson in plasa they have some
 
01:16:34.189 --> 01:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
contamination issues as well so again uh
 
01:16:36.430 --> 01:16:36.440 align:start position:0%
it's really tough on for some parts some
 
01:16:39.110 --> 01:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
places to improve or do any type of
 
01:16:41.189 --> 01:16:41.199 align:start position:0%
development without having the resources
 
01:16:43.629 --> 01:16:43.639 align:start position:0%
I know Windham they were not necessarily
 
01:16:45.790 --> 01:16:45.800 align:start position:0%
supportive of the water there's no we're
 
01:16:47.550 --> 01:16:47.560 align:start position:0%
not putting any strings to this that you
 
01:16:49.629 --> 01:16:49.639 align:start position:0%
have to have lot size requirements or
 
01:16:51.990 --> 01:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
you have to do this we're just saying
 
01:16:53.790 --> 01:16:53.800 align:start position:0%
this is the water supply if we want to
 
01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
trust the uh communities to use that
 
01:16:59.070 --> 01:16:59.080 align:start position:0%
water uh in the right way and they're
 
01:17:01.510 --> 01:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
GNA buy into it so that's that's how
 
01:17:03.189 --> 01:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
that works thank you I just want to
 
01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
point out that wiam did not approve the
 
01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
warrants when they asked to actually
 
01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
build a pipeline but we did uh pay for
 
01:17:12.070 --> 01:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
water rights through the system I
 
01:17:14.350 --> 01:17:14.360 align:start position:0%
remember personally dropping that check
 
01:17:16.870 --> 01:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
off because it was too big to mail in my
 
01:17:19.470 --> 01:17:19.480 align:start position:0%
personal opinion so uh that was a fun
 
01:17:22.189 --> 01:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
card trip with you know few Millions
 
01:17:24.709 --> 01:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
what's a few Millions between friends um
 
01:17:27.229 --> 01:17:27.239 align:start position:0%
and I do appreciate the willingness of
 
01:17:29.110 --> 01:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
Salem to build I know that a lot of the
 
01:17:31.669 --> 01:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
times people U Want housing build just
 
01:17:33.350 --> 01:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
not in their communities it's kind of
 
01:17:35.149 --> 01:17:35.159 align:start position:0%
refreshing to see Salem build it in
 
01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
their own town and maybe people won give
 
01:17:39.870 --> 01:17:39.880 align:start position:0%
wind him such a hard time if you if
 
01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
Salem had some water to build some more
 
01:17:43.270 --> 01:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
housing committee members good luck
 
01:17:45.470 --> 01:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
thank you we're halfway through our a
 
01:17:47.070 --> 01:17:47.080 align:start position:0%
lot of time and we have three more
 
01:17:50.709 --> 01:17:50.719 align:start position:0%
people to speak you may hear the answers
 
01:17:52.229 --> 01:17:52.239 align:start position:0%
that you might have looked for if we can
 
01:17:54.229 --> 01:17:54.239 align:start position:0%
just move on to the other the experts
 
01:17:57.350 --> 01:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
are behind me that's right thank you
 
01:18:00.070 --> 01:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
Senator next call on commissioner Robert
 
01:18:13.430 --> 01:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:15.669 --> 01:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
security thank you uh for the record my
 
01:18:17.910 --> 01:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
name is Bob Scott again I'm commissioner
 
01:18:20.030 --> 01:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
with the Department of rml Services I've
 
01:18:22.990 --> 01:18:23.000 align:start position:0%
asked uh the engineer who's responsible
 
01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:24.910 align:start position:0%
asked uh the engineer who's responsible
for

01:18:24.910 --> 01:18:24.920 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
the dees engineer who's responsible for
 
01:18:29.430 --> 01:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
the phase one as uh project as we were
 
01:18:31.590 --> 01:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
discussing uh to sit up with me he's
 
01:18:34.709 --> 01:18:34.719 align:start position:0%
passing out our testimony lter uh so
 
01:18:37.310 --> 01:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
really quickly again just to ground
 
01:18:39.830 --> 01:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
everybody uh the Southern New Hampshire
 
01:18:42.189 --> 01:18:42.199 align:start position:0%
uh Regional water uh connection project
 
01:18:45.070 --> 01:18:45.080 align:start position:0%
or the phase one part of that again is
 
01:18:46.950 --> 01:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
moving water from Manchester Waterworks
 
01:18:50.629 --> 01:18:50.639 align:start position:0%
as a participant through da a portion of
 
01:18:55.510 --> 01:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
Windam uh with pachuk uh Waterworks uh s
 
01:18:57.910 --> 01:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh in Hampstead area water company uh
 
01:18:57.920 --> 01:18:58.790 align:start position:0%
uh in Hampstead area water company uh
with

01:18:58.790 --> 01:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:19:02.030 --> 01:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
ainson uh going into plastow that
 
01:19:04.629 --> 01:19:04.639 align:start position:0%
initial phase was for roughly a million
 
01:19:07.510 --> 01:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
gallons a day uh that was funded
 
01:19:09.430 --> 01:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
primarily through the drinking water
 
01:19:12.750 --> 01:19:12.760 align:start position:0%
groundwater trust fund the communities
 
01:19:15.229 --> 01:19:15.239 align:start position:0%
themselves uh and in a lot of in kind
 
01:19:17.030 --> 01:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
work with the communities so you know
 
01:19:19.310 --> 01:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
Salem's a good example uh you know they
 
01:19:21.990 --> 01:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
were actually doing a lot of managing a
 
01:19:24.149 --> 01:19:24.159 align:start position:0%
lot of that work uh to to have the the
 
01:19:26.629 --> 01:19:26.639 align:start position:0%
the upsizing the pipes and and uh put
 
01:19:29.910 --> 01:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
new pipes in uh and again going with a
 
01:19:33.590 --> 01:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
franchise into uh Windom uh the project
 
01:19:38.030 --> 01:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
as mentioned phase one was sized for for
 
01:19:40.229 --> 01:19:40.239 align:start position:0%
a future flow we had identified before
 
01:19:42.870 --> 01:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
we started what the long-term needs were
 
01:19:45.790 --> 01:19:45.800 align:start position:0%
for that area of over 3 million gallons
 
01:19:48.830 --> 01:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
per day uh we we approached this with
 
01:19:50.990 --> 01:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
what's what I would call a no regrets
 
01:19:52.669 --> 01:19:52.679 align:start position:0%
policy so what we did not want to see is
 
01:19:55.030 --> 01:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
during phase one we put pipe in and then
 
01:19:56.790 --> 01:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
a couple years later we're digging it up
 
01:20:00.229 --> 01:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
again uh so we you know we intentionally
 
01:20:02.110 --> 01:20:02.120 align:start position:0%
I think we're being smart to to
 
01:20:07.590 --> 01:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:10.669 --> 01:20:10.679 align:start position:0%
the some some questions regarding phase
 
01:20:12.070 --> 01:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
uh regarding
 
01:20:15.310 --> 01:20:15.320 align:start position:0%
pasas uh obviously last week EPA
 
01:20:17.149 --> 01:20:17.159 align:start position:0%
announced new more stringent standards
 
01:20:19.629 --> 01:20:19.639 align:start position:0%
than we currently have in the State uh
 
01:20:22.910 --> 01:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
that puts that whole area of the state
 
01:20:25.149 --> 01:20:25.159 align:start position:0%
uh in Jeopardy because a lot of Water
 
01:20:28.110 --> 01:20:28.120 align:start position:0%
Supplies are now not not going to meet
 
01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
that standard so that was envisioned uh
 
01:20:32.669 --> 01:20:32.679 align:start position:0%
we weren't always on the same page as
 
01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
EPA to be blunt but they were signaling
 
01:20:37.910 --> 01:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
four parts per trillion for a long time
 
01:20:41.270 --> 01:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
so as far as water needs there was the
 
01:20:43.110 --> 01:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
General ask to these communities what do
 
01:20:45.310 --> 01:20:45.320 align:start position:0%
you think you need in the future and
 
01:20:48.229 --> 01:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
with added with our G we we we can see
 
01:20:49.510 --> 01:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
that you're going to need more because
 
01:20:51.189 --> 01:20:51.199 align:start position:0%
of your water supplies are
 
01:20:53.709 --> 01:20:53.719 align:start position:0%
contaminated uh so so there's a couple
 
01:20:57.430 --> 01:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
aspects to what's talked about and I'm
 
01:20:59.629 --> 01:20:59.639 align:start position:0%
I'm talking now to Senator abb's uh
 
01:21:02.310 --> 01:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment uh and that's
 
01:21:03.950 --> 01:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
important because we were asked in the
 
01:21:06.350 --> 01:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
Senate I'm providing information to be
 
01:21:07.910 --> 01:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
blunt the Department's not taking a
 
01:21:09.870 --> 01:21:09.880 align:start position:0%
position on this but we we do think it
 
01:21:11.590 --> 01:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
could be definitely would be
 
01:21:13.790 --> 01:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
beneficial uh to the to the southern
 
01:21:17.510 --> 01:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
part of the state is the the ask by
 
01:21:19.110 --> 01:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
phasing it we were asking the Senate can
 
01:21:21.590 --> 01:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
you phase this give us some information
 
01:21:24.229 --> 01:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
to phase this uh we provided in what we
 
01:21:26.470 --> 01:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
just handed out with with three phases
 
01:21:30.550 --> 01:21:30.560 align:start position:0%
Senator abis uh referred to a b and c uh
 
01:21:33.590 --> 01:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
so that so talking to that the the first
 
01:21:36.790 --> 01:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
page of that handout indicates what we
 
01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
would potentially do if we did a phased
 
01:21:42.149 --> 01:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
approach and that would call for
 
01:21:44.870 --> 01:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
notionally 7 million from General funds
 
01:21:47.430 --> 01:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
and 6.5 million from a combination of
 
01:21:49.390 --> 01:21:49.400 align:start position:0%
the trust fund and other federal funds
 
01:21:52.470 --> 01:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to secure um so so to
 
01:21:54.030 --> 01:21:54.040 align:start position:0%
answer some of those questions I'm hope
 
01:21:55.950 --> 01:21:55.960 align:start position:0%
hopeful that that helps and what that
 
01:21:59.430 --> 01:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
involves is basically debottlenecking
 
01:22:01.430 --> 01:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
Upstream of many of the communities to
 
01:22:03.709 --> 01:22:03.719 align:start position:0%
allow that greater flow so you know
 
01:22:06.110 --> 01:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
things like
 
01:22:09.350 --> 01:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
um addressing pumping addressing uh
 
01:22:11.669 --> 01:22:11.679 align:start position:0%
storage tanks
 
01:22:14.030 --> 01:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
addressing uh needs for the the
 
01:22:17.270 --> 01:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
chemistry as as you increase the flow
 
01:22:19.229 --> 01:22:19.239 align:start position:0%
and one of the other issues uh and we're
 
01:22:21.350 --> 01:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
trying to trying to uh secure federal
 
01:22:23.950 --> 01:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
funds for as part of that greater need
 
01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:25.229 align:start position:0%
funds for as part of that greater need
mostly

01:22:25.229 --> 01:22:25.239 align:start position:0%
mostly
 
01:22:28.110 --> 01:22:28.120 align:start position:0%
mostly because of past contamination is
 
01:22:29.910 --> 01:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
U Lake Massa basic so we're trying to
 
01:22:32.910 --> 01:22:32.920 align:start position:0%
secure federal funds uh to raise Lake
 
01:22:35.910 --> 01:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
Mass ofic uh if if we raise it a foot
 
01:22:38.550 --> 01:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
that's one of the storage one of the
 
01:22:41.750 --> 01:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
primary uh feeds for for Manchester
 
01:22:43.350 --> 01:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
Waterworks who's feeding this whole
 
01:22:45.870 --> 01:22:45.880 align:start position:0%
system right now uh that would provide 1
 
01:22:47.990 --> 01:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
billion cubic feet of water additionally
 
01:22:51.229 --> 01:22:51.239 align:start position:0%
by raising that for for a foot uh that's
 
01:22:53.750 --> 01:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
probably at least in my experience for a
 
01:22:55.510 --> 01:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
couple million that's probably the best
 
01:22:57.110 --> 01:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
bang for the buck we're going to get
 
01:22:59.470 --> 01:22:59.480 align:start position:0%
anywhere so that's part of the project
 
01:23:01.110 --> 01:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
where the Southern New Hampshire project
 
01:23:03.030 --> 01:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily feed lonary raising
 
01:23:05.430 --> 01:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
Lake Massabesic would secure more water
 
01:23:07.750 --> 01:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
for Londoner who's very heavily impacted
 
01:23:11.910 --> 01:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
by by uh past contamination so with that
 
01:23:14.149 --> 01:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly here to answer questions
 
01:23:15.350 --> 01:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
again we're not the Department's not
 
01:23:16.750 --> 01:23:16.760 align:start position:0%
taking a position on where this money
 
01:23:19.270 --> 01:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
should come from uh I would argue that
 
01:23:21.310 --> 01:23:21.320 align:start position:0%
we have a good track record of putting
 
01:23:22.870 --> 01:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
to the extent we do get money I think we
 
01:23:26.830 --> 01:23:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:29.430 --> 01:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
represent papich M thank you Mr chairman
 
01:23:32.030 --> 01:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
and thank you for being here to testify
 
01:23:33.990 --> 01:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
um I was looking through the handout
 
01:23:36.110 --> 01:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
that was just distributed and one of the
 
01:23:39.070 --> 01:23:39.080 align:start position:0%
things I noticed is that while most of
 
01:23:41.550 --> 01:23:41.560 align:start position:0%
the pipeline new pipes would be laid in
 
01:23:44.189 --> 01:23:44.199 align:start position:0%
der by providing a second path to Der
 
01:23:45.590 --> 01:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
you would make you would be able to make
 
01:23:47.750 --> 01:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
more water available to the communities
 
01:23:50.590 --> 01:23:50.600 align:start position:0%
Downstream obviously again being from a
 
01:23:52.310 --> 01:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
town that already purchased the rights
 
01:23:54.750 --> 01:23:54.760 align:start position:0%
to a certain allocation does does that
 
01:23:56.310 --> 01:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
mean that there will be a future
 
01:23:59.790 --> 01:23:59.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity to reserve more you know
 
01:24:02.669 --> 01:24:02.679 align:start position:0%
rights to water in the future as the
 
01:24:04.590 --> 01:24:04.600 align:start position:0%
project gets completed and the
 
01:24:06.629 --> 01:24:06.639 align:start position:0%
availability increases and if so what
 
01:24:09.030 --> 01:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
would be the timeline so that I can let
 
01:24:11.510 --> 01:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
my town know when to prepare to consider
 
01:24:14.070 --> 01:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
such issues sure that's a great question
 
01:24:16.390 --> 01:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
so so I'm gonna answer you and then my
 
01:24:17.910 --> 01:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
experts going to correct me if I get
 
01:24:21.430 --> 01:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
this wrong so so the allocation so what
 
01:24:22.629 --> 01:24:22.639 align:start position:0%
the representative is talking about is
 
01:24:24.950 --> 01:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
Manchester Waterworks has a has a
 
01:24:26.550 --> 01:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
capacity fee so if you want to reserve
 
01:24:29.189 --> 01:24:29.199 align:start position:0%
their capacity you make a payment and
 
01:24:30.870 --> 01:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
effectively they use that to then get
 
01:24:33.950 --> 01:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
more sources of water eventually uh and
 
01:24:36.950 --> 01:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
and Windam has paid for a certain amount
 
01:24:40.270 --> 01:24:40.280 align:start position:0%
my recollection is as we did this those
 
01:24:42.910 --> 01:24:42.920 align:start position:0%
that msdc it's called for Manchester
 
01:24:46.390 --> 01:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
what you purchased was assuming the 3.1
 
01:24:48.510 --> 01:24:48.520 align:start position:0%
million of the buildout of phase two is
 
01:24:50.590 --> 01:24:50.600 align:start position:0%
that correct Mike not quite not quite
 
01:24:51.830 --> 01:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
all right I knew I wasn't going to get
 
01:24:55.430 --> 01:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
there so um yeah Windam all the partners
 
01:24:57.310 --> 01:24:57.320 align:start position:0%
have purchased the water rights for
 
01:24:59.990 --> 01:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
phase one and then there is an agreement
 
01:25:02.550 --> 01:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
in place called The Sia Southern
 
01:25:05.550 --> 01:25:05.560 align:start position:0%
interconnect agreement that lays out the
 
01:25:08.510 --> 01:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
allocations for phase two if and when
 
01:25:10.990 --> 01:25:11.000 align:start position:0%
it's constructed and that would be the
 
01:25:12.629 --> 01:25:12.639 align:start position:0%
time when the partners would have the
 
01:25:15.669 --> 01:25:15.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity to purchase that additional
 
01:25:18.390 --> 01:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
capacity so the timeline really depends
 
01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:19.280 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:25:22.590 --> 01:25:22.600 align:start position:0%
funding if I may follow up follow up
 
01:25:24.870 --> 01:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
very briefly assuming the funding goes
 
01:25:26.310 --> 01:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
through as planned which is an
 
01:25:28.189 --> 01:25:28.199 align:start position:0%
optimistic assumption always but let's
 
01:25:30.510 --> 01:25:30.520 align:start position:0%
assume that what kind of timeline are we
 
01:25:32.070 --> 01:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
looking at what's the most optimistic
 
01:25:34.870 --> 01:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
timeline for those decisions to be to
 
01:25:37.910 --> 01:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
have to be made by the towns can design
 
01:25:40.470 --> 01:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
and constructions at least two years two
 
01:25:43.669 --> 01:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
to three years so in that time frame and
 
01:25:46.510 --> 01:25:46.520 align:start position:0%
and certainly the partners would convene
 
01:25:49.390 --> 01:25:49.400 align:start position:0%
there's a board that meets on a somewhat
 
01:25:52.310 --> 01:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
regular basis um that all of the towns
 
01:25:55.470 --> 01:25:55.480 align:start position:0%
and water suppliers are part of and they
 
01:25:57.750 --> 01:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
would definitely be convening that group
 
01:26:00.870 --> 01:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
to start that discussion thank you can
 
01:26:02.790 --> 01:26:02.800 align:start position:0%
we have that witness fill out a card
 
01:26:05.629 --> 01:26:05.639 align:start position:0%
before you leave one of these pink cards
 
01:26:07.629 --> 01:26:07.639 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards for question uh
 
01:26:10.350 --> 01:26:10.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so one of the towns I
 
01:26:12.750 --> 01:26:12.760 align:start position:0%
represent is Auburn and Auburn basically
 
01:26:16.030 --> 01:26:16.040 align:start position:0%
has Lake Massabesic surrounded and uh of
 
01:26:18.430 --> 01:26:18.440 align:start position:0%
course the the lake belongs to the
 
01:26:21.430 --> 01:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
Manchester Waterworks but as a as a
 
01:26:23.390 --> 01:26:23.400 align:start position:0%
courtesy in the past it seems like
 
01:26:26.910 --> 01:26:26.920 align:start position:0%
there's been really good coordination
 
01:26:29.669 --> 01:26:29.679 align:start position:0%
between the the Waterworks and the town
 
01:26:33.709 --> 01:26:33.719 align:start position:0%
of Auburn do do you know if um if anyone
 
01:26:35.669 --> 01:26:35.679 align:start position:0%
has been talking to the Auburn selectman
 
01:26:37.590 --> 01:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
or or would this be a surprise to them
 
01:26:39.350 --> 01:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
if I were to talk to
 
01:26:41.350 --> 01:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
them I can't answer that directly I
 
01:26:43.070 --> 01:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
don't know what Communications has been
 
01:26:46.390 --> 01:26:46.400 align:start position:0%
I know the only act activity right now
 
01:26:49.550 --> 01:26:49.560 align:start position:0%
for Lake Massabesic is uh Manchester
 
01:26:51.510 --> 01:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
Waterworks is under is going through a
 
01:26:53.950 --> 01:26:53.960 align:start position:0%
study to to make sure to kind of nail
 
01:26:55.669 --> 01:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
down if we were to do this or if they
 
01:26:57.750 --> 01:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
were to do this to be blunt uh what
 
01:26:59.510 --> 01:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
would that look like what would be the
 
01:27:02.070 --> 01:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
cost uh so we have some notional costs
 
01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
so and also easements and what would be
 
01:27:07.270 --> 01:27:07.280 align:start position:0%
the impacts and you know so I would I
 
01:27:08.950 --> 01:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
would trust and hope that Manchester
 
01:27:10.430 --> 01:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
Waterworks if they have in the past
 
01:27:12.149 --> 01:27:12.159 align:start position:0%
which I assume is communicated with the
 
01:27:13.390 --> 01:27:13.400 align:start position:0%
community I don't know why they wouldn't
 
01:27:15.910 --> 01:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
be doing that now but I I long answer to
 
01:27:17.109 --> 01:27:17.119 align:start position:0%
say I don't know the answer if they've
 
01:27:19.030 --> 01:27:19.040 align:start position:0%
communicated that yet all right thank
 
01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:19.870 align:start position:0%
communicated that yet all right thank
you

01:27:19.870 --> 01:27:19.880 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:27:23.709 --> 01:27:23.719 align:start position:0%
follow have followup okay and and and U
 
01:27:26.669 --> 01:27:26.679 align:start position:0%
because um the residents of Auburn are
 
01:27:28.510 --> 01:27:28.520 align:start position:0%
so protective and so concerned about
 
01:27:32.229 --> 01:27:32.239 align:start position:0%
Lake Massabesic it's the center of our
 
01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
town um uh anything that has to do with
 
01:27:38.470 --> 01:27:38.480 align:start position:0%
that it gets to be um of of high
 
01:27:41.229 --> 01:27:41.239 align:start position:0%
interest what what I had been told last
 
01:27:45.310 --> 01:27:45.320 align:start position:0%
time I looked into this was that um uh
 
01:27:49.070 --> 01:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
we had completed a water supply line
 
01:27:53.910 --> 01:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
that fed from the the river and that our
 
01:27:57.870 --> 01:27:57.880 align:start position:0%
uh uh need or ability to meet the needs
 
01:28:00.189 --> 01:28:00.199 align:start position:0%
of the communities of Salem and
 
01:28:04.470 --> 01:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
elsewhere were um more than more than
 
01:28:06.830 --> 01:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
adequate for as far into the future as
 
01:28:07.830 --> 01:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
we could
 
01:28:11.470 --> 01:28:11.480 align:start position:0%
look is this I must have heard something
 
01:28:13.109 --> 01:28:13.119 align:start position:0%
wrong because I I already thought that
 
01:28:15.669 --> 01:28:15.679 align:start position:0%
we had a water supply secured for
 
01:28:19.310 --> 01:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
anything we want to do in the Southern
 
01:28:22.149 --> 01:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
Tier so the answer to that is yes and no
 
01:28:23.470 --> 01:28:23.480 align:start position:0%
first of all we other think to your
 
01:28:24.669 --> 01:28:24.679 align:start position:0%
earlier question the other thing we can
 
01:28:27.390 --> 01:28:27.400 align:start position:0%
do certainly is the department can make
 
01:28:31.310 --> 01:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
sure that we can request that Manchester
 
01:28:33.390 --> 01:28:33.400 align:start position:0%
is is coordinating so we will certainly
 
01:28:36.149 --> 01:28:36.159 align:start position:0%
do that uh I'm not sure I can make them
 
01:28:39.070 --> 01:28:39.080 align:start position:0%
but I I'm can't imagine they wouldn't uh
 
01:28:42.590 --> 01:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
and second of all so yes the the you're
 
01:28:45.910 --> 01:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
talking the uh water withdrawal uh they
 
01:28:47.270 --> 01:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
have a radial well they they
 
01:28:48.790 --> 01:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
commissioned Manchester Waterworks
 
01:28:50.830 --> 01:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
commissioned in hookit uh from the
 
01:28:53.790 --> 01:28:53.800 align:start position:0%
meramac river and that was sized in
 
01:28:56.709 --> 01:28:56.719 align:start position:0%
order to to make in because people like
 
01:28:59.149 --> 01:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
Windam have bought that capacity that
 
01:29:01.990 --> 01:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
was sized to meet that projected 3.1
 
01:29:04.910 --> 01:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
million um for those communities what
 
01:29:09.390 --> 01:29:09.400 align:start position:0%
we've seen since is uh communities like
 
01:29:12.229 --> 01:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
uh again the past issue is really thrown
 
01:29:13.910 --> 01:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
a Mikey wrench into a lot of this so we
 
01:29:15.430 --> 01:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
have communities like londondary who
 
01:29:17.830 --> 01:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
have a greater need than we expected uh
 
01:29:19.910 --> 01:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
We've also commissioned study study in
 
01:29:22.390 --> 01:29:22.400 align:start position:0%
the last year looking
 
01:29:25.390 --> 01:29:25.400 align:start position:0%
at just general water needs going Beyond
 
01:29:28.109 --> 01:29:28.119 align:start position:0%
those communities and again probably not
 
01:29:30.030 --> 01:29:30.040 align:start position:0%
surprising we're finding the needs are
 
01:29:32.310 --> 01:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
are are greater even than we expected so
 
01:29:36.669 --> 01:29:36.679 align:start position:0%
this adding Lake Massabesic is is uh
 
01:29:38.390 --> 01:29:38.400 align:start position:0%
does a couple things but one of them is
 
01:29:41.390 --> 01:29:41.400 align:start position:0%
it provides a little bit more redundancy
 
01:29:44.550 --> 01:29:44.560 align:start position:0%
uh again you're correct that that uh
 
01:29:47.629 --> 01:29:47.639 align:start position:0%
withdrawal effectively from the meramac
 
01:29:49.229 --> 01:29:49.239 align:start position:0%
does provide a lot more capacity for
 
01:29:51.510 --> 01:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
Manchester Waterworks but what we're
 
01:29:53.030 --> 01:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
finding is the trend is there's even
 
01:29:55.990 --> 01:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
more demand for for good clean
 
01:29:59.149 --> 01:29:59.159 align:start position:0%
water represent Heath for a question um
 
01:30:00.910 --> 01:30:00.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:30:03.550 --> 01:30:03.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question um the Manchester of
 
01:30:06.310 --> 01:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
Waterworks is I'm from Manchester I just
 
01:30:09.229 --> 01:30:09.239 align:start position:0%
a former Alderman so I'm familiar with a
 
01:30:11.350 --> 01:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
lot of this um and the work they're
 
01:30:13.790 --> 01:30:13.800 align:start position:0%
doing is absolutely extraordinary my
 
01:30:15.830 --> 01:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
question is kind of simple I just don't
 
01:30:17.109 --> 01:30:17.119 align:start position:0%
understand how are you going to raise
 
01:30:20.990 --> 01:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
Massabesic level a foot or raise what
 
01:30:22.270 --> 01:30:22.280 align:start position:0%
how how are you going to do that it's
 
01:30:24.629 --> 01:30:24.639 align:start position:0%
pretty full right now
 
01:30:26.070 --> 01:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
correct and sometimes it gets there
 
01:30:29.950 --> 01:30:29.960 align:start position:0%
anyways I think um so so they they use
 
01:30:33.189 --> 01:30:33.199 align:start position:0%
dams to to control the water level and
 
01:30:35.510 --> 01:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
it would be an upgrade to those dams and
 
01:30:37.709 --> 01:30:37.719 align:start position:0%
then obviously you look at what happens
 
01:30:39.270 --> 01:30:39.280 align:start position:0%
if you do
 
01:30:42.189 --> 01:30:42.199 align:start position:0%
that represent Maguire for question
 
01:30:43.550 --> 01:30:43.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:30:46.030 --> 01:30:46.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner a key consideration for our
 
01:30:49.669 --> 01:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
committee is the source of funds and all
 
01:30:51.590 --> 01:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
the paper I see in front of me is
 
01:30:55.910 --> 01:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
extremely vague in that regard um the
 
01:30:58.470 --> 01:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal note says drinking water and
 
01:31:01.430 --> 01:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
groundwater trust fund which I assume
 
01:31:05.590 --> 01:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
comes originally from uh um the general
 
01:31:07.709 --> 01:31:07.719 align:start position:0%
fund or maybe it's revolving funds on
 
01:31:10.149 --> 01:31:10.159 align:start position:0%
projects that get paid back I'm not sure
 
01:31:12.510 --> 01:31:12.520 align:start position:0%
there's the P remediation loan and Grant
 
01:31:14.669 --> 01:31:14.679 align:start position:0%
fund there's federal funds and local
 
01:31:17.229 --> 01:31:17.239 align:start position:0%
contributions but there's no specifics
 
01:31:19.229 --> 01:31:19.239 align:start position:0%
and then the one you just handed out is
 
01:31:22.910 --> 01:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
an additional 7 million of General funds
 
01:31:26.350 --> 01:31:26.360 align:start position:0%
so can you give us a better idea of
 
01:31:27.750 --> 01:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
what's coming from
 
01:31:30.189 --> 01:31:30.199 align:start position:0%
where uh I'll I'll attempt to do that
 
01:31:33.189 --> 01:31:33.199 align:start position:0%
again I think it's it's it's so the the
 
01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
trust fund just really quickly that was
 
01:31:38.350 --> 01:31:38.360 align:start position:0%
monies that were obtained by the state
 
01:31:43.430 --> 01:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
for mtbe lawsuits and the the monies
 
01:31:45.790 --> 01:31:45.800 align:start position:0%
that were there two sets of monies but
 
01:31:47.470 --> 01:31:47.480 align:start position:0%
in this case the monies went to the
 
01:31:49.390 --> 01:31:49.400 align:start position:0%
state a certain amount went to the rainy
 
01:31:51.310 --> 01:31:51.320 align:start position:0%
day fund and the rest went by Statute
 
01:31:53.470 --> 01:31:53.480 align:start position:0%
you guys passed you all passed the law
 
01:31:55.350 --> 01:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
to to establish the drinking water
 
01:31:58.109 --> 01:31:58.119 align:start position:0%
groundwater trust fund so that's not
 
01:31:59.470 --> 01:31:59.480 align:start position:0%
there's no back and forth between the
 
01:32:01.350 --> 01:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
general fund and that uh just just to be
 
01:32:04.629 --> 01:32:04.639 align:start position:0%
clear so that's a that that commission
 
01:32:08.310 --> 01:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
is is a 17 I forget I'm on it uh 17 or
 
01:32:10.430 --> 01:32:10.440 align:start position:0%
19 person commission that makes those
 
01:32:13.669 --> 01:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
decisions uh for that um so for the
 
01:32:15.590 --> 01:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
funding again my understanding and and
 
01:32:17.350 --> 01:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
the senator would be better on the
 
01:32:20.189 --> 01:32:20.199 align:start position:0%
answer I I I think you're talking about
 
01:32:22.629 --> 01:32:22.639 align:start position:0%
a combination of funds because that
 
01:32:24.870 --> 01:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
that's that's how we've done things so
 
01:32:27.070 --> 01:32:27.080 align:start position:0%
there's not been an Ask yet to the trust
 
01:32:29.870 --> 01:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
fund uh but being on the commission I
 
01:32:32.590 --> 01:32:32.600 align:start position:0%
know there's just like you look for the
 
01:32:35.390 --> 01:32:35.400 align:start position:0%
general fund gee there's not there's not
 
01:32:37.270 --> 01:32:37.280 align:start position:0%
unlimited resources here and we need to
 
01:32:40.550 --> 01:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
be careful how we spend it so again my
 
01:32:43.870 --> 01:32:43.880 align:start position:0%
understanding was at least notionally uh
 
01:32:46.830 --> 01:32:46.840 align:start position:0%
it was it was to be a total for this one
 
01:32:49.629 --> 01:32:49.639 align:start position:0%
phase of 7 million in asked to general
 
01:32:51.390 --> 01:32:51.400 align:start position:0%
fund was the ask but that that'd be a
 
01:32:53.669 --> 01:32:53.679 align:start position:0%
better question for the senator and then
 
01:32:56.790 --> 01:32:56.800 align:start position:0%
the the trust fund would make up um of
 
01:32:56.800 --> 01:32:57.790 align:start position:0%
the the trust fund would make up um of
the

01:32:57.790 --> 01:32:57.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:33:00.390 --> 01:33:00.400 align:start position:0%
13.5 that you see in the handout on the
 
01:33:05.149 --> 01:33:05.159 align:start position:0%
top block would likely uh be the the the
 
01:33:07.229 --> 01:33:07.239 align:start position:0%
remainder of that and I know the trust
 
01:33:10.270 --> 01:33:10.280 align:start position:0%
fund commission chair is is aware and
 
01:33:12.669 --> 01:33:12.679 align:start position:0%
generally agreeable to that out with the
 
01:33:14.229 --> 01:33:14.239 align:start position:0%
caveat that the whole trust fund needs
 
01:33:16.870 --> 01:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
to commission needs to vote on that and
 
01:33:19.109 --> 01:33:19.119 align:start position:0%
then as I mentioned the lake Massabesic
 
01:33:21.390 --> 01:33:21.400 align:start position:0%
was another 3 million we're looking at
 
01:33:22.870 --> 01:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
not General funds for that we were
 
01:33:25.350 --> 01:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
looking at uh federal funds for that uh
 
01:33:27.510 --> 01:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
we're still trying to arrange that and
 
01:33:30.669 --> 01:33:30.679 align:start position:0%
then uh on our handout on the the next
 
01:33:34.390 --> 01:33:34.400 align:start position:0%
block below not D not directly part of
 
01:33:38.709 --> 01:33:38.719 align:start position:0%
providing the the extra flow but being
 
01:33:42.229 --> 01:33:42.239 align:start position:0%
writing on that is a uh developer funded
 
01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
project at the Hamstead area water
 
01:33:46.470 --> 01:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
company for another four million so what
 
01:33:48.189 --> 01:33:48.199 align:start position:0%
we've been trying to do just like for
 
01:33:51.030 --> 01:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
the trust fund is leverage uh you know
 
01:33:54.030 --> 01:33:54.040 align:start position:0%
other people's money if you will OPM uh
 
01:33:56.750 --> 01:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
of to to get as much bang for the buck
 
01:33:59.189 --> 01:33:59.199 align:start position:0%
as we can but this was the my
 
01:34:00.430 --> 01:34:00.440 align:start position:0%
understanding that's the general fund
 
01:34:03.669 --> 01:34:03.679 align:start position:0%
ask for that phase if that if that
 
01:34:07.430 --> 01:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
helps thank you Mr chairman so um are
 
01:34:10.790 --> 01:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
any of these structured as loans
 
01:34:13.629 --> 01:34:13.639 align:start position:0%
because because often with water
 
01:34:16.030 --> 01:34:16.040 align:start position:0%
projects they're they're like a loan
 
01:34:18.510 --> 01:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
that gets paid back to the trust or to
 
01:34:22.470 --> 01:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
to the fund when the water gets used by
 
01:34:24.750 --> 01:34:24.760 align:start position:0%
the by the users and their fees for
 
01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:26.390 align:start position:0%
the by the users and their fees for
water

01:34:26.390 --> 01:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
water
 
01:34:29.270 --> 01:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
yeah so I think so certainly the
 
01:34:30.790 --> 01:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
appropriation you're talking about would
 
01:34:32.229 --> 01:34:32.239 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a loan if you were to do
 
01:34:34.430 --> 01:34:34.440 align:start position:0%
that with the with the general fund the
 
01:34:35.910 --> 01:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
trust fund
 
01:34:38.229 --> 01:34:38.239 align:start position:0%
typically but not always is a
 
01:34:41.430 --> 01:34:41.440 align:start position:0%
combination of uh grants and Loans are
 
01:34:43.790 --> 01:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
are paid back so that' be a discussion
 
01:34:45.590 --> 01:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
most likely though this would be a grant
 
01:34:49.270 --> 01:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
from the trust fund uh in the as I
 
01:34:50.870 --> 01:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned to the the federal money for
 
01:34:52.950 --> 01:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
Lake Massabesic that would that would be
 
01:34:55.149 --> 01:34:55.159 align:start position:0%
effectively a Grant and the developers
 
01:34:57.950 --> 01:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
putting money in directly so that's he
 
01:34:59.950 --> 01:34:59.960 align:start position:0%
may be taking out a loan to cover that
 
01:35:02.510 --> 01:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
but that's effectively there so that's
 
01:35:03.910 --> 01:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
short answer is most of that is
 
01:35:06.350 --> 01:35:06.360 align:start position:0%
envisioned as as a
 
01:35:10.189 --> 01:35:10.199 align:start position:0%
grant I have a question that uh a dozen
 
01:35:13.669 --> 01:35:13.679 align:start position:0%
years I've been tracking this
 
01:35:18.910 --> 01:35:18.920 align:start position:0%
P we seem to keep reducing 70 parts per
 
01:35:21.430 --> 01:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
trillion eight parts per trillion four
 
01:35:23.229 --> 01:35:23.239 align:start position:0%
parts per trillion when you go from
 
01:35:24.669 --> 01:35:24.679 align:start position:0%
eight parts parts per trillion to four
 
01:35:26.910 --> 01:35:26.920 align:start position:0%
parts per trillion you don't just double
 
01:35:28.870 --> 01:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
the amount of money it's quite likely 10
 
01:35:33.390 --> 01:35:33.400 align:start position:0%
times as much but yet I seen no human
 
01:35:36.669 --> 01:35:36.679 align:start position:0%
testing to justify all this have you
 
01:35:36.679 --> 01:35:37.709 align:start position:0%
testing to justify all this have you
seen

01:35:37.709 --> 01:35:37.719 align:start position:0%
seen
 
01:35:40.510 --> 01:35:40.520 align:start position:0%
any as you're aware uh representative
 
01:35:42.590 --> 01:35:42.600 align:start position:0%
you know the state you know my agency
 
01:35:45.790 --> 01:35:45.800 align:start position:0%
did did promate a standard uh got it's
 
01:35:47.149 --> 01:35:47.159 align:start position:0%
been a while now I forget how many years
 
01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
seven years ago I think on on P and and
 
01:35:52.950 --> 01:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
we were in the teen teens for four of
 
01:35:54.430 --> 01:35:54.440 align:start position:0%
the components
 
01:35:56.870 --> 01:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh and that was based on we had our own
 
01:35:59.510 --> 01:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh we hired a toxicologist and a health
 
01:36:01.790 --> 01:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
risk assessor and we work with h Health
 
01:36:04.790 --> 01:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
and Human Services EPA standard
 
01:36:06.910 --> 01:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
obviously they have their own science in
 
01:36:09.629 --> 01:36:09.639 align:start position:0%
that to be blunt we weren't there we
 
01:36:11.510 --> 01:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
would have put it at four if we thought
 
01:36:14.430 --> 01:36:14.440 align:start position:0%
it should have been at four uh they have
 
01:36:15.910 --> 01:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
but we did what we did with the best
 
01:36:17.590 --> 01:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
science we had available at the time so
 
01:36:19.709 --> 01:36:19.719 align:start position:0%
EPA believes they
 
01:36:22.830 --> 01:36:22.840 align:start position:0%
have uh for pfos and pfoa I don't want
 
01:36:25.550 --> 01:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
to get too t for everybody they believe
 
01:36:27.910 --> 01:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
it's a likely carcinogen based on their
 
01:36:30.830 --> 01:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
studies and their their experts that
 
01:36:32.910 --> 01:36:32.920 align:start position:0%
drives the Clean Water Act to say you
 
01:36:35.310 --> 01:36:35.320 align:start position:0%
need to make the standard as low as
 
01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:36.590 align:start position:0%
need to make the standard as low as
economically

01:36:36.590 --> 01:36:36.600 align:start position:0%
economically
 
01:36:39.590 --> 01:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
feasible uh you may have heard me
 
01:36:41.750 --> 01:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
talking about that in the Press uh I was
 
01:36:43.590 --> 01:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
on the front page of the union leader I
 
01:36:45.830 --> 01:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
think the
 
01:36:48.229 --> 01:36:48.239 align:start position:0%
costs collectively are are being
 
01:36:50.030 --> 01:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
underestimated based on our experience
 
01:36:51.430 --> 01:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire and that would
 
01:36:53.790 --> 01:36:53.800 align:start position:0%
feed into that standard but short sure
 
01:36:56.590 --> 01:36:56.600 align:start position:0%
is EPA feels that they have that that
 
01:37:00.350 --> 01:37:00.360 align:start position:0%
data I haven't my people haven't said g
 
01:37:01.950 --> 01:37:01.960 align:start position:0%
it should be four it needs to be before
 
01:37:03.390 --> 01:37:03.400 align:start position:0%
if we had we would have changed our own
 
01:37:05.310 --> 01:37:05.320 align:start position:0%
standard but again it's a much larger
 
01:37:07.510 --> 01:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
agency the EPA than than we are but
 
01:37:10.790 --> 01:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
again no human studies to support that
 
01:37:13.430 --> 01:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
number sure that um that's what I'm
 
01:37:14.550 --> 01:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
aware of I I understand what you're
 
01:37:17.149 --> 01:37:17.159 align:start position:0%
saying there there is some they did use
 
01:37:18.550 --> 01:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
again I don't want to get too wonky here
 
01:37:21.189 --> 01:37:21.199 align:start position:0%
for the for everybody there's some
 
01:37:24.229 --> 01:37:24.239 align:start position:0%
studies that EPA is is human studies
 
01:37:26.109 --> 01:37:26.119 align:start position:0%
that they are now quoting in Pharaoh
 
01:37:28.510 --> 01:37:28.520 align:start position:0%
Islands uh and different things like
 
01:37:31.669 --> 01:37:31.679 align:start position:0%
that again that's not data that we used
 
01:37:33.629 --> 01:37:33.639 align:start position:0%
I would think that before we spend
 
01:37:35.470 --> 01:37:35.480 align:start position:0%
multi-billions trying to get down to
 
01:37:38.030 --> 01:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
four parts per trillion that we ought to
 
01:37:41.070 --> 01:37:41.080 align:start position:0%
spend a few million doing human studies
 
01:37:43.229 --> 01:37:43.239 align:start position:0%
and that so I think it's the tail
 
01:37:45.390 --> 01:37:45.400 align:start position:0%
wagging the dog and and we're getting
 
01:37:47.229 --> 01:37:47.239 align:start position:0%
ahead of ourselves finally we're
 
01:37:49.350 --> 01:37:49.360 align:start position:0%
spending some money in maram that's the
 
01:37:52.430 --> 01:37:52.440 align:start position:0%
first human study I've heard of and you
 
01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
know and we ought to be doing widespread
 
01:37:58.149 --> 01:37:58.159 align:start position:0%
testing among the population to see what
 
01:38:01.790 --> 01:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
each of us has already for parts per
 
01:38:04.310 --> 01:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
trillion in New Hampshire there there is
 
01:38:06.430 --> 01:38:06.440 align:start position:0%
uh there has been uh blood testing at
 
01:38:09.669 --> 01:38:09.679 align:start position:0%
around the P Air Force base area also
 
01:38:11.229 --> 01:38:11.239 align:start position:0%
have you got the results published
 
01:38:13.589 --> 01:38:13.599 align:start position:0%
anywhere uh heal Health un Services has
 
01:38:16.790 --> 01:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
that information thank you further
 
01:38:18.950 --> 01:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:38:22.790 --> 01:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
hle thank you Mr chair in addition to
 
01:38:25.350 --> 01:38:25.360 align:start position:0%
the ch change of capacity at Massabesic
 
01:38:29.470 --> 01:38:29.480 align:start position:0%
lake is there any other large um
 
01:38:31.830 --> 01:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
capacity storage facilities invisioned
 
01:38:34.229 --> 01:38:34.239 align:start position:0%
in the plan so so there is daily draw
 
01:38:36.790 --> 01:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
limits right but Having excess capacity
 
01:38:38.629 --> 01:38:38.639 align:start position:0%
is what mitigates the days where there's
 
01:38:41.149 --> 01:38:41.159 align:start position:0%
peaks in terms of draw and I wasn't sure
 
01:38:43.030 --> 01:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
besides Massabesic Lake does the plan
 
01:38:46.390 --> 01:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
include anything else in terms of bulk
 
01:38:48.589 --> 01:38:48.599 align:start position:0%
storage Mike if you
 
01:38:48.599 --> 01:38:50.270 align:start position:0%
storage Mike if you
want

01:38:50.270 --> 01:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
want
 
01:38:54.310 --> 01:38:54.320 align:start position:0%
so few of the systems da uh say
 
01:38:57.669 --> 01:38:57.679 align:start position:0%
have ainson have existing storage and
 
01:39:00.070 --> 01:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
then as part of phase two there's one
 
01:39:03.270 --> 01:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
proposed storage tank uh and dairy that
 
01:39:05.030 --> 01:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
would be the only
 
01:39:07.990 --> 01:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
additional follow up follow up so of
 
01:39:11.629 --> 01:39:11.639 align:start position:0%
those that are currently in use where is
 
01:39:13.910 --> 01:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
the capacity level typically at and are
 
01:39:17.030 --> 01:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
we fully use utilizing those now or
 
01:39:20.390 --> 01:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
not um so the biggest one well
 
01:39:22.669 --> 01:39:22.679 align:start position:0%
Manchester has 5 million gallons of
 
01:39:24.870 --> 01:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
storage in London Dairy and then Dairy
 
01:39:28.030 --> 01:39:28.040 align:start position:0%
has four in their main service Zone
 
01:39:31.470 --> 01:39:31.480 align:start position:0%
Salem has I think 4 million gallons and
 
01:39:33.870 --> 01:39:33.880 align:start position:0%
the way they're fully utilized they
 
01:39:35.870 --> 01:39:35.880 align:start position:0%
always fill those tanks to the top and
 
01:39:39.030 --> 01:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
it's really an operational decision uh
 
01:39:42.189 --> 01:39:42.199 align:start position:0%
during High usage days they'll draw the
 
01:39:47.589 --> 01:39:47.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:50.030 --> 01:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
average all right we've got one more
 
01:39:53.390 --> 01:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
witness members uh finish this up thank
 
01:39:56.270 --> 01:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
thank you gentlemen U we have Roy
 
01:39:59.990 --> 01:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:02.950 --> 01:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
Salem that's for the next
 
01:40:05.350 --> 01:40:05.360 align:start position:0%
one good good afternoon everyone my name
 
01:40:07.430 --> 01:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
is Roy senson I'm with the town of Salem
 
01:40:09.149 --> 01:40:09.159 align:start position:0%
I'm also here representing the uh
 
01:40:10.950 --> 01:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire Regional water
 
01:40:13.390 --> 01:40:13.400 align:start position:0%
Partners um Mike Anger from Das
 
01:40:14.669 --> 01:40:14.679 align:start position:0%
mentioned that that's the group he was
 
01:40:17.030 --> 01:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
talking about and those are the folks
 
01:40:20.149 --> 01:40:20.159 align:start position:0%
that are uh Affiliated through the sea
 
01:40:22.030 --> 01:40:22.040 align:start position:0%
which is the southern interconnection
 
01:40:24.430 --> 01:40:24.440 align:start position:0%
agreement which was the the premise of
 
01:40:26.550 --> 01:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
this project from uh the beginning back
 
01:40:30.229 --> 01:40:30.239 align:start position:0%
in 2017 18 uh he had to testify on a
 
01:40:33.350 --> 01:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
couple things so this project itself is
 
01:40:34.950 --> 01:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
unprecedented when you look at the
 
01:40:36.589 --> 01:40:36.599 align:start position:0%
relationships between the
 
01:40:38.950 --> 01:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
communities and our relationships with
 
01:40:40.310 --> 01:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
the private water suppliers that would
 
01:40:42.390 --> 01:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
be the penu of the world the Manchester
 
01:40:44.870 --> 01:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
Waterworks and the uh Hamstead area
 
01:40:46.830 --> 01:40:46.840 align:start position:0%
water company
 
01:40:50.790 --> 01:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
hawc uh we also uh service a section of
 
01:40:53.070 --> 01:40:53.080 align:start position:0%
Windom we took a section of Windom as
 
01:40:55.229 --> 01:40:55.239 align:start position:0%
our franchise area so the town of Salem
 
01:40:57.669 --> 01:40:57.679 align:start position:0%
actually controls and services that
 
01:40:59.990 --> 01:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
section of Windham I don't believe that
 
01:41:02.310 --> 01:41:02.320 align:start position:0%
is the case anywhere else in the state
 
01:41:05.189 --> 01:41:05.199 align:start position:0%
as far as a public water supplier uh
 
01:41:08.030 --> 01:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
servicing another community so we talked
 
01:41:09.510 --> 01:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
a about a lot of things here today we
 
01:41:11.270 --> 01:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
talked about capacity I'll just come
 
01:41:13.790 --> 01:41:13.800 align:start position:0%
back to the question on capacity storage
 
01:41:17.990 --> 01:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
wise in Salem we have on hand any day 5
 
01:41:19.390 --> 01:41:19.400 align:start position:0%
million gallons that's in our water
 
01:41:21.109 --> 01:41:21.119 align:start position:0%
tanks that's our additional storage
 
01:41:23.390 --> 01:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
capacity the question becomes the
 
01:41:25.070 --> 01:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
overall capacity of our current water
 
01:41:27.910 --> 01:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
supplies canaby Lake and Arlington Pond
 
01:41:30.430 --> 01:41:30.440 align:start position:0%
and that's why we entered into this um
 
01:41:31.910 --> 01:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
project in the first place because we
 
01:41:34.030 --> 01:41:34.040 align:start position:0%
had capacity issues and we also had
 
01:41:35.709 --> 01:41:35.719 align:start position:0%
contamination issues at the time the
 
01:41:38.510 --> 01:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
spirit of that project was based on MTB
 
01:41:41.589 --> 01:41:41.599 align:start position:0%
contamination since that time mtb's kind
 
01:41:44.510 --> 01:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
of taking a back seat and now posos and
 
01:41:47.510 --> 01:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
P or I should say p and then in
 
01:41:52.109 --> 01:41:52.119 align:start position:0%
particular POA and uh P fos pfos have
 
01:41:55.149 --> 01:41:55.159 align:start position:0%
taken uh the primary seat the Southern
 
01:41:57.550 --> 01:41:57.560 align:start position:0%
Tier itself as as you've heard today is
 
01:42:00.669 --> 01:42:00.679 align:start position:0%
growing uh we obviously are keen on that
 
01:42:03.709 --> 01:42:03.719 align:start position:0%
and we keep an eye on that uh we also
 
01:42:05.430 --> 01:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
have demand that we're looking at
 
01:42:07.070 --> 01:42:07.080 align:start position:0%
throughout that southern portion or that
 
01:42:08.750 --> 01:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
southern part of the state which we
 
01:42:10.910 --> 01:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
looked at initially through the studies
 
01:42:13.990 --> 01:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
the overall capacity was 3.13 for that
 
01:42:16.990 --> 01:42:17.000 align:start position:0%
project uh to date roughly 1 million as
 
01:42:19.149 --> 01:42:19.159 align:start position:0%
commissioner Scott said is coming over
 
01:42:22.589 --> 01:42:22.599 align:start position:0%
the dairy line and and that that is
 
01:42:24.350 --> 01:42:24.360 align:start position:0%
built the issue we're having right now
 
01:42:26.470 --> 01:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
is the ability to pump more through the
 
01:42:28.950 --> 01:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
system to get us to that
 
01:42:31.870 --> 01:42:31.880 align:start position:0%
3.13 the communities have bought in by
 
01:42:33.950 --> 01:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
purchasing their water rights Salem
 
01:42:35.790 --> 01:42:35.800 align:start position:0%
itself we had a warrant article four or
 
01:42:39.470 --> 01:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
five years back where we uh levied $5
 
01:42:42.629 --> 01:42:42.639 align:start position:0%
million uh of public money to buy our
 
01:42:46.350 --> 01:42:46.360 align:start position:0%
water rights from Manchester so um I'm
 
01:42:48.550 --> 01:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
here to say that this is a unprecedented
 
01:42:50.430 --> 01:42:50.440 align:start position:0%
project in the beginning if you asked me
 
01:42:52.430 --> 01:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
10 years ago if this was even plausible
 
01:42:54.430 --> 01:42:54.440 align:start position:0%
I would say absolutely abolutely not so
 
01:42:56.390 --> 01:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
what is the benefit of that right now I
 
01:42:58.270 --> 01:42:58.280 align:start position:0%
think you have needs throughout the
 
01:42:59.990 --> 01:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
state and you're going to see a lot of
 
01:43:01.910 --> 01:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
contamination and if you're going to
 
01:43:04.990 --> 01:43:05.000 align:start position:0%
continue to follow this model this is a
 
01:43:07.030 --> 01:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
model project to these other communities
 
01:43:09.470 --> 01:43:09.480 align:start position:0%
to say this can be done you can have
 
01:43:10.950 --> 01:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
Public Water Supplies you can have
 
01:43:13.109 --> 01:43:13.119 align:start position:0%
private Water Supplies you can enter
 
01:43:14.990 --> 01:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
into uh agreements including
 
01:43:16.870 --> 01:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
intermunicipal agreements an example we
 
01:43:18.870 --> 01:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
have three different agreements we're in
 
01:43:21.350 --> 01:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
right now whether it's with penchuk with
 
01:43:23.830 --> 01:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
the town of Windham and the southern
 
01:43:26.189 --> 01:43:26.199 align:start position:0%
inter interconnection agreement
 
01:43:29.149 --> 01:43:29.159 align:start position:0%
so um I'm here to say that again when
 
01:43:31.270 --> 01:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
you when you look at the need and the
 
01:43:33.350 --> 01:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
funding to put forward for this and to
 
01:43:35.350 --> 01:43:35.360 align:start position:0%
finish this project off it's certainly
 
01:43:38.030 --> 01:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
going to benefit uh the Southern Tier
 
01:43:39.830 --> 01:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
and it sets the model for the rest of
 
01:43:42.790 --> 01:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
the state thank you representative f for
 
01:43:42.800 --> 01:43:44.870 align:start position:0%
the state thank you representative f for
a

01:43:44.870 --> 01:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:43:46.750 --> 01:43:46.760 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:43:49.310 --> 01:43:49.320 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so why would this
 
01:43:51.990 --> 01:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
not be considered as part of the next
 
01:43:54.229 --> 01:43:54.239 align:start position:0%
capital budget so that it could be cons
 
01:43:56.070 --> 01:43:56.080 align:start position:0%
state's capital budget so that it could
 
01:43:57.709 --> 01:43:57.719 align:start position:0%
be considered in light of all the other
 
01:44:01.109 --> 01:44:01.119 align:start position:0%
needs Capital needs of the state um I
 
01:44:01.790 --> 01:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:44:04.030 --> 01:44:04.040 align:start position:0%
representative I can't I'm not I'm not I
 
01:44:05.390 --> 01:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
can't answer that question I mean that
 
01:44:06.709 --> 01:44:06.719 align:start position:0%
would be a question for either uh
 
01:44:06.719 --> 01:44:09.270 align:start position:0%
would be a question for either uh
Senator

01:44:09.270 --> 01:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:11.430 --> 01:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
abbis any other questions from the
 
01:44:11.440 --> 01:44:12.350 align:start position:0%
abbis any other questions from the
committee

01:44:12.350 --> 01:44:12.360 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:44:15.030 --> 01:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
members represent papichi Muller thank
 
01:44:17.310 --> 01:44:17.320 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair not a question really just
 
01:44:19.910 --> 01:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
a quick comment I just wanted to um
 
01:44:22.149 --> 01:44:22.159 align:start position:0%
thank the town of Salem you know for
 
01:44:23.950 --> 01:44:23.960 align:start position:0%
having the flexibility to accommodate
 
01:44:27.790 --> 01:44:27.800 align:start position:0%
wiam because that was a win-win and you
 
01:44:30.830 --> 01:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
know I wish we would see more situations
 
01:44:32.709 --> 01:44:32.719 align:start position:0%
in the state where towns would work
 
01:44:34.669 --> 01:44:34.679 align:start position:0%
together like that because both of them
 
01:44:36.510 --> 01:44:36.520 align:start position:0%
benefited from the agreement but being
 
01:44:38.430 --> 01:44:38.440 align:start position:0%
unprecedented I did want to express my
 
01:44:40.750 --> 01:44:40.760 align:start position:0%
appreciation for the willingness of uh
 
01:44:42.589 --> 01:44:42.599 align:start position:0%
the town of Salem to consider that
 
01:44:44.510 --> 01:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
agreement yeah thank you absolutely so
 
01:44:46.229 --> 01:44:46.239 align:start position:0%
yeah we did and part of that was the
 
01:44:48.910 --> 01:44:48.920 align:start position:0%
inter Municipal I spoken with him at
 
01:44:51.910 --> 01:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
some meetings as well um and you have
 
01:44:53.149 --> 01:44:53.159 align:start position:0%
some really good leadership over over
 
01:44:54.550 --> 01:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
there right now your Town Administrator
 
01:44:57.149 --> 01:44:57.159 align:start position:0%
Brian mccy and and and looking forward
 
01:44:59.030 --> 01:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
so thank
 
01:45:01.229 --> 01:45:01.239 align:start position:0%
you any further questions for the

the culinary arts programs teaching
 
01:46:51.669 --> 01:46:51.679 align:start position:0%
system um I'd also like to say that
 
01:46:54.229 --> 01:46:54.239 align:start position:0%
there has been
 
01:46:57.470 --> 01:46:57.480 align:start position:0%
a I guess um it would best to be called
 
01:47:00.350 --> 01:47:00.360 align:start position:0%
it some sort of mixup and
 
01:47:03.350 --> 01:47:03.360 align:start position:0%
miscommunication between uh the school
 
01:47:05.629 --> 01:47:05.639 align:start position:0%
district in Hudson and the Department of
 
01:47:09.030 --> 01:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
Education a few years ago we had
 
01:47:13.070 --> 01:47:13.080 align:start position:0%
authorized um the financing of a new CTE
 
01:47:17.030 --> 01:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
Center at HUD at alurn high school and
 
01:47:19.669 --> 01:47:19.679 align:start position:0%
there was some money left over
 
01:47:23.669 --> 01:47:23.679 align:start position:0%
approximately between 600 and $700,000
 
01:47:26.550 --> 01:47:26.560 align:start position:0%
um the school district made the request
 
01:47:28.790 --> 01:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Education not once
 
01:47:31.910 --> 01:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
but twice if they could spend that money
 
01:47:34.870 --> 01:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
on getting these new hoods and the
 
01:47:37.270 --> 01:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Education told them yes
 
01:47:39.950 --> 01:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
you can use that money so they went
 
01:47:41.790 --> 01:47:41.800 align:start position:0%
ahead and they spent the money and they
 
01:47:44.350 --> 01:47:44.360 align:start position:0%
got the new hoods and installed them but
 
01:47:46.390 --> 01:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
in the meantime the state went and
 
01:47:47.589 --> 01:47:47.599 align:start position:0%
clawed it
 
01:47:52.430 --> 01:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
back so now um they have these hoods
 
01:47:54.030 --> 01:47:54.040 align:start position:0%
they had had expected to use the
 
01:47:57.070 --> 01:47:57.080 align:start position:0%
leftover money um it was not a line item
 
01:48:00.270 --> 01:48:00.280 align:start position:0%
in the budget and they were given um
 
01:48:01.350 --> 01:48:01.360 align:start position:0%
some bad
 
01:48:03.589 --> 01:48:03.599 align:start position:0%
information and so now what we're
 
01:48:05.830 --> 01:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
looking to do is to make the town of
 
01:48:09.149 --> 01:48:09.159 align:start position:0%
Hudson whole um this was a mistake on
 
01:48:11.709 --> 01:48:11.719 align:start position:0%
the part of the Department of Education
 
01:48:14.070 --> 01:48:14.080 align:start position:0%
and it should not fall on the taxpayers
 
01:48:17.070 --> 01:48:17.080 align:start position:0%
of Hudson to make up that difference
 
01:48:19.750 --> 01:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
because that's if you choose not to do
 
01:48:21.790 --> 01:48:21.800 align:start position:0%
that that's exactly what's going to
 
01:48:24.310 --> 01:48:24.320 align:start position:0%
happen because the vendor of course
 
01:48:25.550 --> 01:48:25.560 align:start position:0%
needs to be
 
01:48:29.109 --> 01:48:29.119 align:start position:0%
paid um and I just like to add a couple
 
01:48:30.750 --> 01:48:30.760 align:start position:0%
more things the repair and the
 
01:48:32.390 --> 01:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
replacement will provide a learning
 
01:48:34.589 --> 01:48:34.599 align:start position:0%
space for students to prepare for
 
01:48:36.109 --> 01:48:36.119 align:start position:0%
careers in the hospitality and
 
01:48:38.830 --> 01:48:38.840 align:start position:0%
restaurant industry and I hope all of
 
01:48:42.109 --> 01:48:42.119 align:start position:0%
you have the opportunity to go to uh
 
01:48:44.470 --> 01:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
their in school restaurant a lot of
 
01:48:47.070 --> 01:48:47.080 align:start position:0%
events are held there the students do a
 
01:48:50.750 --> 01:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
fabulous job and many of them leave and
 
01:48:53.310 --> 01:48:53.320 align:start position:0%
they will go on to a culinary Arts
 
01:48:56.070 --> 01:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
Advanced program and they're working in
 
01:48:57.589 --> 01:48:57.599 align:start position:0%
our state's
 
01:48:57.599 --> 01:48:59.270 align:start position:0%
our state's
restaurants

01:48:59.270 --> 01:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
restaurants
 
01:49:02.310 --> 01:49:02.320 align:start position:0%
um in its present State the students can
 
01:49:04.870 --> 01:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
observe a teacher demonstrating but not
 
01:49:07.830 --> 01:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
really some of those essential skills
 
01:49:09.510 --> 01:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
the appropriation will allow them to
 
01:49:11.149 --> 01:49:11.159 align:start position:0%
become skilled and knowledgeable and
 
01:49:14.470 --> 01:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
good paying jobs and I'm just going to
 
01:49:18.629 --> 01:49:18.639 align:start position:0%
leave that here I'm hoping that um that
 
01:49:21.070 --> 01:49:21.080 align:start position:0%
the finance committee can support this
 
01:49:24.750 --> 01:49:24.760 align:start position:0%
and rectify I'm mistake that was made um
 
01:49:27.950 --> 01:49:27.960 align:start position:0%
to the school district in Hudson and I
 
01:49:29.550 --> 01:49:29.560 align:start position:0%
believe there are folks here who could
 
01:49:31.669 --> 01:49:31.679 align:start position:0%
probably give you a lot more detail than
 
01:49:33.629 --> 01:49:33.639 align:start position:0%

01:50:39.910 --> 01:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:50:42.750 --> 01:50:42.760 align:start position:0%
for coming I was a little unclear from
 
01:50:46.470 --> 01:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
Senator Carson's testimony as to whether
 
01:50:49.229 --> 01:50:49.239 align:start position:0%
this project is already complete already
 
01:50:53.030 --> 01:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
in in use and therefore this is just
 
01:50:55.550 --> 01:50:55.560 align:start position:0%
paying due to the mistake and how it was
 
01:50:59.790 --> 01:50:59.800 align:start position:0%
going to be paid or is if we ex allocate
 
01:51:03.109 --> 01:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
These funds then the project can go
 
01:51:05.870 --> 01:51:05.880 align:start position:0%
forward superintendent mulis from Hudson
 
01:51:07.229 --> 01:51:07.239 align:start position:0%
is here he can provide a little more
 
01:51:09.669 --> 01:51:09.679 align:start position:0%
detail when he speaks but I I believe
 
01:51:12.350 --> 01:51:12.360 align:start position:0%
that it is has been completed and that
 
01:51:14.149 --> 01:51:14.159 align:start position:0%
the uh the vendor is asking for invoices
 
01:51:18.510 --> 01:51:18.520 align:start position:0%
to be paid at this point Thank follow up
 
01:51:21.390 --> 01:51:21.400 align:start position:0%
is this um facility only used by
 
01:51:25.430 --> 01:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
students in um HUD from Hudson or from
 
01:51:27.390 --> 01:51:27.400 align:start position:0%
many other places I'm so glad you asked
 
01:51:29.470 --> 01:51:29.480 align:start position:0%
representative um Career Technical
 
01:51:31.390 --> 01:51:31.400 align:start position:0%
education programs in this across the
 
01:51:33.910 --> 01:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
state are Regional in nature uh Hudson
 
01:51:36.750 --> 01:51:36.760 align:start position:0%
has um students that are coming from um
 
01:51:40.069 --> 01:51:40.079 align:start position:0%
the Milford area the emerest area um the
 
01:51:42.870 --> 01:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh London are Manchester uh there are
 
01:51:45.510 --> 01:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
students coming from all over the region
 
01:51:48.990 --> 01:51:49.000 align:start position:0%
uh for CTE at at Hudson um so it really
 
01:51:51.310 --> 01:51:51.320 align:start position:0%
serves above and beyond uh just the
 
01:51:54.430 --> 01:51:54.440 align:start position:0%
students that are at Al High School
 
01:51:56.189 --> 01:51:56.199 align:start position:0%
another thing that I will always uh
 
01:51:58.030 --> 01:51:58.040 align:start position:0%
whenever I'm given an opportunity to to
 
01:52:01.790 --> 01:52:01.800 align:start position:0%
speak CTE is a powerful uh economic uh
 
01:52:04.030 --> 01:52:04.040 align:start position:0%
driver for our state uh Career and
 
01:52:06.069 --> 01:52:06.079 align:start position:0%
Technical education students are skilled
 
01:52:07.589 --> 01:52:07.599 align:start position:0%
and knowledgeable they're the next
 
01:52:09.750 --> 01:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
generation of workers and small business
 
01:52:12.430 --> 01:52:12.440 align:start position:0%
owners uh in the state so whenever we
 
01:52:14.470 --> 01:52:14.480 align:start position:0%
think about the regional nature of CT I
 
01:52:15.510 --> 01:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
think it's important to keep that in
 
01:52:18.189 --> 01:52:18.199 align:start position:0%
mind that it also is a really powerful
 
01:52:20.990 --> 01:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
economic uh engine for all the regions
 
01:52:23.470 --> 01:52:23.480 align:start position:0%
of the state
 
01:52:25.990 --> 01:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
I believe there's 16
 
01:52:28.709 --> 01:52:28.719 align:start position:0%
CTE uh representative wer at this uh
 
01:52:32.310 --> 01:52:32.320 align:start position:0%
point there are 28 28 yep going from the
 
01:52:33.270 --> 01:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
the southern part of the state all the
 
01:52:35.629 --> 01:52:35.639 align:start position:0%
way up to C Brook yeah and these are all
 
01:52:37.910 --> 01:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
Partnerships between the department of
 
01:52:40.870 --> 01:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
Ed and the local community that hosts
 
01:52:43.709 --> 01:52:43.719 align:start position:0%
them correct they're eligible to take in
 
01:52:47.669 --> 01:52:47.679 align:start position:0%
students from all around and every two
 
01:52:50.629 --> 01:52:50.639 align:start position:0%
years in the capital budget there's a
 
01:52:53.470 --> 01:52:53.480 align:start position:0%
definite appropriation to ensure that at
 
01:52:58.069 --> 01:52:58.079 align:start position:0%
least two CTE get some money every every
 
01:53:00.709 --> 01:53:00.719 align:start position:0%
time there's a rotation so thank you we
 
01:53:02.830 --> 01:53:02.840 align:start position:0%
appr something we've worked on in this
 
01:53:05.470 --> 01:53:05.480 align:start position:0%
committee did you have a followup I did
 
01:53:08.830 --> 01:53:08.840 align:start position:0%
one so when a student comes from another
 
01:53:11.069 --> 01:53:11.079 align:start position:0%
District does money come with the
 
01:53:14.669 --> 01:53:14.679 align:start position:0%
student or and and to what ex how many
 
01:53:16.270 --> 01:53:16.280 align:start position:0%
students are we talking about and to
 
01:53:19.470 --> 01:53:19.480 align:start position:0%
what fraction is are they state
 
01:53:22.270 --> 01:53:22.280 align:start position:0%
funded uh great question so the uh the
 
01:53:25.830 --> 01:53:25.840 align:start position:0%
the State covers 75% of tuition uh for
 
01:53:28.310 --> 01:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
regional CTE students so the the
 
01:53:30.830 --> 01:53:30.840 align:start position:0%
receiving high school or the CTE Center
 
01:53:34.390 --> 01:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
will charge a uh a tuition uh to the
 
01:53:37.589 --> 01:53:37.599 align:start position:0%
sending high school students uh then the
 
01:53:39.510 --> 01:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
department uh does an annual payment
 
01:53:42.390 --> 01:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
every December that covers 75% of that
 
01:53:45.470 --> 01:53:45.480 align:start position:0%
cost this is the line that's see Comm
 
01:53:47.830 --> 01:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
tuition and transportation in the school
 
01:53:50.910 --> 01:53:50.920 align:start position:0%
budget this is what covers for the CTE
 
01:53:54.629 --> 01:53:54.639 align:start position:0%
and students coming from surrounding
 
01:53:58.229 --> 01:53:58.239 align:start position:0%
towns did you want to say
 
01:54:01.069 --> 01:54:01.079 align:start position:0%
further represent Heath thank you Mr
 
01:54:03.310 --> 01:54:03.320 align:start position:0%
chair um my question is about the
 
01:54:07.990 --> 01:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
process um normally the CTE is an kind
 
01:54:11.470 --> 01:54:11.480 align:start position:0%
of like a queue um just as uh the chair
 
01:54:13.669 --> 01:54:13.679 align:start position:0%
described and the money comes from the
 
01:54:17.430 --> 01:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
capital budget and um the project goes
 
01:54:20.709 --> 01:54:20.719 align:start position:0%
on now what I'm what I think I heard
 
01:54:23.950 --> 01:54:23.960 align:start position:0%
from the senator is that that's how the
 
01:54:25.910 --> 01:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
project was funded but there was a
 
01:54:27.870 --> 01:54:27.880 align:start position:0%
remaining amount of money that was left
 
01:54:31.430 --> 01:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
and for that Alver was told that they
 
01:54:33.910 --> 01:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
could go forward and then the department
 
01:54:37.910 --> 01:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
of Ed reneged is that true uh I can give
 
01:54:40.270 --> 01:54:40.280 align:start position:0%
a little bit more context so the uh the
 
01:54:41.830 --> 01:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
miscommunication that Senator Carson
 
01:54:43.950 --> 01:54:43.960 align:start position:0%
referred to that did come out of my
 
01:54:45.589 --> 01:54:45.599 align:start position:0%
office uh that is something that I will
 
01:54:47.870 --> 01:54:47.880 align:start position:0%
will own and take responsibility for um
 
01:54:49.910 --> 01:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
a former employee was asked will these
 
01:54:53.069 --> 01:54:53.079 align:start position:0%
funds be available um her
 
01:54:55.589 --> 01:54:55.599 align:start position:0%
interpretation of that question was
 
01:54:57.950 --> 01:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
should they be brought forward they
 
01:54:59.990 --> 01:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
would be available the the funds of
 
01:55:01.589 --> 01:55:01.599 align:start position:0%
course as you all well know are not
 
01:55:04.790 --> 01:55:04.800 align:start position:0%
available until the budget is is enacted
 
01:55:07.310 --> 01:55:07.320 align:start position:0%
uh so when when she heard that question
 
01:55:09.709 --> 01:55:09.719 align:start position:0%
what she heard was These funds will be
 
01:55:12.310 --> 01:55:12.320 align:start position:0%
available if uh and that was
 
01:55:14.910 --> 01:55:14.920 align:start position:0%
misunderstood on the other end so um
 
01:55:17.550 --> 01:55:17.560 align:start position:0%
strictly speaking the department did not
 
01:55:19.430 --> 01:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
clawback the funds the department there
 
01:55:21.430 --> 01:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
was some funds were unexpended the
 
01:55:23.629 --> 01:55:23.639 align:start position:0%
department uh chose to not bring those
 
01:55:27.470 --> 01:55:27.480 align:start position:0%
forward and return them uh to the
 
01:55:33.510 --> 01:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
state now this money was budgeted for
 
01:55:37.709 --> 01:55:37.719 align:start position:0%
Elburn the funds there were remaining
 
01:55:43.470 --> 01:55:43.480 align:start position:0%
funds and this local Center was told by
 
01:55:45.589 --> 01:55:45.599 align:start position:0%
someone at the department that they were
 
01:55:47.510 --> 01:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
approved and they went ahead and they
 
01:55:49.470 --> 01:55:49.480 align:start position:0%
did the
 
01:55:52.550 --> 01:55:52.560 align:start position:0%
project and it was money that had had
 
01:55:55.870 --> 01:55:55.880 align:start position:0%
been budgeted for them originally am I
 
01:55:58.629 --> 01:55:58.639 align:start position:0%
correct to a certain extent the the yes
 
01:56:00.510 --> 01:56:00.520 align:start position:0%
or no
 
01:56:03.310 --> 01:56:03.320 align:start position:0%
please yes but not for the purpose of of
 
01:56:06.669 --> 01:56:06.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:09.750 --> 01:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
item so to clarify the funds were going
 
01:56:12.109 --> 01:56:12.119 align:start position:0%
to be spent after the fiscal year we
 
01:56:13.830 --> 01:56:13.840 align:start position:0%
didn't feel like we had the authority to
 
01:56:16.390 --> 01:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
go ahead and approve that and so the
 
01:56:18.030 --> 01:56:18.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner had said no we will not be
 
01:56:20.669 --> 01:56:20.679 align:start position:0%
bringing those funds forward and I think
 
01:56:22.750 --> 01:56:22.760 align:start position:0%
that that was the misunderstanding that
 
01:56:25.709 --> 01:56:25.719 align:start position:0%
was communicated by uh one of our
 
01:56:29.310 --> 01:56:29.320 align:start position:0%
staff followup but this was past the
 
01:56:33.270 --> 01:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
process to approve an extension correct
 
01:56:36.310 --> 01:56:36.320 align:start position:0%
was Alver alerted to the need to do that
 
01:56:40.149 --> 01:56:40.159 align:start position:0%
correct yes and did they follow through
 
01:56:41.589 --> 01:56:41.599 align:start position:0%
that's where the miscommunication
 
01:56:42.790 --> 01:56:42.800 align:start position:0%
because they felt that they had
 
01:56:44.589 --> 01:56:44.599 align:start position:0%
communicated it to our office and our
 
01:56:46.390 --> 01:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
office felt that they had communicated
 
01:56:48.229 --> 01:56:48.239 align:start position:0%
that it would not be going forward that
 
01:56:50.510 --> 01:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
we were not requesting that
 
01:56:53.229 --> 01:56:53.239 align:start position:0%
extension th alleg ative
 
01:56:55.750 --> 01:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
fix I understand the frustration and we
 
01:56:58.669 --> 01:56:58.679 align:start position:0%
are working to or we have corrected
 
01:57:00.510 --> 01:57:00.520 align:start position:0%
those internal processes and procedures
 
01:57:02.189 --> 01:57:02.199 align:start position:0%
to make sure going forward that nothing
 
01:57:04.229 --> 01:57:04.239 align:start position:0%
like this happens again representative
 
01:57:06.470 --> 01:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
Petri for a question yeah thank you Mr
 
01:57:08.589 --> 01:57:08.599 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank you for taking my
 
01:57:08.599 --> 01:57:10.390 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank you for taking my
question

01:57:10.390 --> 01:57:10.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:57:12.669 --> 01:57:12.679 align:start position:0%
um how come this wasn't part of the
 
01:57:15.510 --> 01:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
original proposal you know to do I mean
 
01:57:19.589 --> 01:57:19.599 align:start position:0%
hoods is is a normal part of culinary
 
01:57:21.669 --> 01:57:21.679 align:start position:0%
arts thank you for the question that's a
 
01:57:23.390 --> 01:57:23.400 align:start position:0%
great question
 
01:57:26.790 --> 01:57:26.800 align:start position:0%
the Ser the additional Services were
 
01:57:28.629 --> 01:57:28.639 align:start position:0%
outside of the scope of the original
 
01:57:31.069 --> 01:57:31.079 align:start position:0%
project and I'll just add this is a
 
01:57:32.990 --> 01:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
really in the weed so forgive me I won't
 
01:57:35.550 --> 01:57:35.560 align:start position:0%
go too too far into it there are two uh
 
01:57:37.390 --> 01:57:37.400 align:start position:0%
separate sections in the colonary arts
 
01:57:41.310 --> 01:57:41.320 align:start position:0%
program space uh at at the Palmer Center
 
01:57:43.270 --> 01:57:43.280 align:start position:0%
there is a commercial kitchen which uh
 
01:57:45.189 --> 01:57:45.199 align:start position:0%
serves the restaurant that commercial
 
01:57:48.229 --> 01:57:48.239 align:start position:0%
kitchen has adequate ventilation there's
 
01:57:49.870 --> 01:57:49.880 align:start position:0%
also a teaching kitchen the teaching
 
01:57:51.830 --> 01:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
kitchen has a set of induction cook
 
01:57:53.790 --> 01:57:53.800 align:start position:0%
service so that the teacher can
 
01:57:56.550 --> 01:57:56.560 align:start position:0%
demonstrate cooking techniques students
 
01:57:59.550 --> 01:57:59.560 align:start position:0%
can then uh mirror those techniques
 
01:58:01.109 --> 01:58:01.119 align:start position:0%
that's the area that was lacking proper
 
01:58:02.910 --> 01:58:02.920 align:start position:0%
ventilation so if they were ever going
 
01:58:06.069 --> 01:58:06.079 align:start position:0%
to use oil um shortening any kind of
 
01:58:07.910 --> 01:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
thing that needed ventilation they
 
01:58:09.310 --> 01:58:09.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to they would only be
 
01:58:12.589 --> 01:58:12.599 align:start position:0%
able to do chopping um boiling things of
 
01:58:15.470 --> 01:58:15.480 align:start position:0%
that nature but no sautéing or brazing
 
01:58:19.310 --> 01:58:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:21.470 --> 01:58:21.480 align:start position:0%
techniques represented string for a
 
01:58:22.669 --> 01:58:22.679 align:start position:0%
question and repres
 
01:58:25.229 --> 01:58:25.239 align:start position:0%
Edwards uh yes thank you for taking my
 
01:58:28.430 --> 01:58:28.440 align:start position:0%
question uh so uh given that this this
 
01:58:31.109 --> 01:58:31.119 align:start position:0%
money uh has been authorized and and
 
01:58:34.310 --> 01:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
spent but I guess not paid uh assuming
 
01:58:37.109 --> 01:58:37.119 align:start position:0%
the state uh doesn't and Department of
 
01:58:39.390 --> 01:58:39.400 align:start position:0%
Ed doesn't come in am I correct to
 
01:58:41.950 --> 01:58:41.960 align:start position:0%
assume that the Hudson property
 
01:58:43.910 --> 01:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
taxpayers or local taxpayers are going
 
01:58:45.510 --> 01:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
to have to come up with this money or is
 
01:58:47.870 --> 01:58:47.880 align:start position:0%
it going to be subject to a court case
 
01:58:49.790 --> 01:58:49.800 align:start position:0%
or you know where are we going if if we
 
01:58:53.109 --> 01:58:53.119 align:start position:0%
don't uh uh come up with some time based
 
01:58:55.750 --> 01:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
payment to pay
 
01:58:58.870 --> 01:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
this if you know thank you for the
 
01:59:01.870 --> 01:59:01.880 align:start position:0%
question I think that um that might be
 
01:59:03.870 --> 01:59:03.880 align:start position:0%
something we would want to talk with
 
01:59:09.550 --> 01:59:09.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:11.709 --> 01:59:11.719 align:start position:0%
about representative Edwards for a
 
01:59:14.270 --> 01:59:14.280 align:start position:0%
question yeah thank you there there are
 
01:59:15.870 --> 01:59:15.880 align:start position:0%
other members of this committee that
 
01:59:18.750 --> 01:59:18.760 align:start position:0%
have uh have sat on the finance or the
 
01:59:21.629 --> 01:59:21.639 align:start position:0%
education subcommittee finance and
 
01:59:23.510 --> 01:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
they're they're more expert at this I
 
01:59:25.830 --> 01:59:25.840 align:start position:0%
I'm just telling you my my reaction to
 
01:59:29.629 --> 01:59:29.639 align:start position:0%
this is that um if there wasn't a a
 
01:59:34.510 --> 01:59:34.520 align:start position:0%
clear paper trail on the questions and
 
01:59:37.030 --> 01:59:37.040 align:start position:0%
the approvals and the
 
01:59:40.990 --> 01:59:41.000 align:start position:0%
decisions uh and the spending decision
 
01:59:43.750 --> 01:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
was made without clear
 
01:59:46.430 --> 01:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
documentation I I would hope and I don't
 
01:59:48.629 --> 01:59:48.639 align:start position:0%
want to get into it in a public hearing
 
01:59:50.830 --> 01:59:50.840 align:start position:0%
whever really but I would just want to
 
01:59:53.709 --> 01:59:53.719 align:start position:0%
know that from a personnel management
 
01:59:55.149 --> 01:59:55.159 align:start position:0%
perspective it's good to hear the
 
01:59:57.189 --> 01:59:57.199 align:start position:0%
processes have been cleaned up but I'd
 
01:59:58.350 --> 01:59:58.360 align:start position:0%
like to know that there was some
 
01:59:59.990 --> 02:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
accountability because this doesn't
 
02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:01.589 align:start position:0%
accountability because this doesn't
sound

02:00:01.589 --> 02:00:01.599 align:start position:0%

weed it's our job to you know go all the
 
02:00:27.350 --> 02:00:27.360 align:start position:0%
way down there and I'm just trying to
 
02:00:29.109 --> 02:00:29.119 align:start position:0%
summarize what happened just to make
 
02:00:30.470 --> 02:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
sure I understood it correctly and I
 
02:00:32.430 --> 02:00:32.440 align:start position:0%
would appreciate it if you would correct
 
02:00:35.830 --> 02:00:35.840 align:start position:0%
any misunderstanding I may have that the
 
02:00:38.990 --> 02:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
original project scope was completed
 
02:00:41.430 --> 02:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
there was money left over then we had
 
02:00:44.950 --> 02:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
that cross communication where people
 
02:00:46.990 --> 02:00:47.000 align:start position:0%
misunderstood each other or basically
 
02:00:48.709 --> 02:00:48.719 align:start position:0%
there was a misunderstanding between the
 
02:00:51.470 --> 02:00:51.480 align:start position:0%
doe and Hudson as a result of which
 
02:00:53.350 --> 02:00:53.360 align:start position:0%
Hudson in good faith proceeded to
 
02:00:55.910 --> 02:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
complete the project and you know foot
 
02:00:57.629 --> 02:00:57.639 align:start position:0%
the bills with a full expectation they
 
02:00:59.709 --> 02:00:59.719 align:start position:0%
will be repaid by the doe but because of
 
02:01:01.790 --> 02:01:01.800 align:start position:0%
the miscommunication do we found
 
02:01:05.390 --> 02:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
themselves without the Appropriations to
 
02:01:07.310 --> 02:01:07.320 align:start position:0%
refund them and this is why this bill is
 
02:01:10.990 --> 02:01:11.000 align:start position:0%
fulfilled to write that wrong do I
 
02:01:12.510 --> 02:01:12.520 align:start position:0%
understand everything correctly I'm just
 
02:01:14.470 --> 02:01:14.480 align:start position:0%
correct thank you I just honestly there
 
02:01:15.709 --> 02:01:15.719 align:start position:0%
are a lot of moving parts and I don't
 
02:01:18.669 --> 02:01:18.679 align:start position:0%
want to get something wrong thank
 
02:01:21.109 --> 02:01:21.119 align:start position:0%

good to see you um again I want to thank
 
02:02:05.189 --> 02:02:05.199 align:start position:0%
Senator Carson for uh sponsoring this uh
 
02:02:08.030 --> 02:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 396
 
02:02:10.750 --> 02:02:10.760 align:start position:0%
fn- um I want to speak to the importance
 
02:02:22.109 --> 02:02:22.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:24.790 --> 02:02:24.800 align:start position:0%
the culinary arts program in classroom
 
02:02:26.550 --> 02:02:26.560 align:start position:0%
um to be clear there was a question on
 
02:02:29.229 --> 02:02:29.239 align:start position:0%
this side of the room as far as uh have
 
02:02:30.950 --> 02:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
these these expenditures these bills
 
02:02:33.189 --> 02:02:33.199 align:start position:0%
been paid um we did have to pay those
 
02:02:36.030 --> 02:02:36.040 align:start position:0%
bills the vendor expected the work to be
 
02:02:39.510 --> 02:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
done uh the work was well underway um by
 
02:02:42.790 --> 02:02:42.800 align:start position:0%
the time we were notified um that that
 
02:02:45.510 --> 02:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
work had already started um so for the
 
02:02:47.589 --> 02:02:47.599 align:start position:0%
record I did want to clarify that the
 
02:02:49.510 --> 02:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
project was well under construction well
 
02:02:52.470 --> 02:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
underway when we we were notified of
 
02:02:55.709 --> 02:02:55.719 align:start position:0%
that um again uh you know I think
 
02:02:57.990 --> 02:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
working with the Department of Education
 
02:03:00.270 --> 02:03:00.280 align:start position:0%
um we're just looking to uh make sure
 
02:03:02.470 --> 02:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
that that's not going to be paid from
 
02:03:05.629 --> 02:03:05.639 align:start position:0%
local property taxes and and uh just
 
02:03:07.990 --> 02:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
correct that but we as a district did
 
02:03:11.709 --> 02:03:11.719 align:start position:0%
have to pay for pay for that bill um to
 
02:03:13.790 --> 02:03:13.800 align:start position:0%
to the vendor um as mentioned the
 
02:03:15.910 --> 02:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
specialized ventilation program by Mr
 
02:03:17.350 --> 02:03:17.360 align:start position:0%
beard is on the classroom side of the
 
02:03:20.430 --> 02:03:20.440 align:start position:0%
culinary arts um it is specifically for
 
02:03:22.589 --> 02:03:22.599 align:start position:0%
uh specialized cooking so such as grease
 
02:03:24.990 --> 02:03:25.000 align:start position:0%
cooking um for the students and as
 
02:03:27.430 --> 02:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned by Senator Carson um that
 
02:03:28.870 --> 02:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
helps support students going into
 
02:03:30.109 --> 02:03:30.119 align:start position:0%
multiple different fields in The
 
02:03:32.550 --> 02:03:32.560 align:start position:0%
Culinary in The Culinary and hospitality
 
02:03:35.510 --> 02:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
industry um so that is why those uh
 
02:03:37.669 --> 02:03:37.679 align:start position:0%
those uh specific hoods are needed from
 
02:03:40.470 --> 02:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
a ventilation standpoint and also from a
 
02:03:43.470 --> 02:03:43.480 align:start position:0%
fire safety fire code standpoint um so
 
02:03:46.109 --> 02:03:46.119 align:start position:0%
that is that is why that that was that
 
02:03:48.709 --> 02:03:48.719 align:start position:0%
was needed uh I'm going to pause there
 
02:03:50.430 --> 02:03:50.440 align:start position:0%
um to see if there's questions from the
 
02:03:50.440 --> 02:03:52.390 align:start position:0%
um to see if there's questions from the
committee

02:03:52.390 --> 02:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:03:54.270 --> 02:03:54.280 align:start position:0%
any questions from the
 
02:03:56.669 --> 02:03:56.679 align:start position:0%
committee representative Maguire thank
 
02:03:58.790 --> 02:03:58.800 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thanks for coming
 
02:04:01.790 --> 02:04:01.800 align:start position:0%
superintendent how many uh cook stations
 
02:04:03.629 --> 02:04:03.639 align:start position:0%
are there in this
 
02:04:05.189 --> 02:04:05.199 align:start position:0%
classroom all right I'm going to
 
02:04:06.390 --> 02:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
estimate it I don't have the exact
 
02:04:07.629 --> 02:04:07.639 align:start position:0%
number right in front of me and I would
 
02:04:09.149 --> 02:04:09.159 align:start position:0%
be more than willing to follow up on
 
02:04:12.430 --> 02:04:12.440 align:start position:0%
that I believe there are at a minimum I
 
02:04:15.629 --> 02:04:15.639 align:start position:0%
want to say 12 or 14 but I I want to I
 
02:04:17.750 --> 02:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
can get you a specific number but at a
 
02:04:19.750 --> 02:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
minimum there's 14 what happens is
 
02:04:22.149 --> 02:04:22.159 align:start position:0%
students work at those cooking stations
 
02:04:23.750 --> 02:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
there'll be multiple State uh students
 
02:04:25.229 --> 02:04:25.239 align:start position:0%
working at that station but they they
 
02:04:27.149 --> 02:04:27.159 align:start position:0%
try to minimize at least two two to
 
02:04:29.549 --> 02:04:29.559 align:start position:0%
three students per station follow up
 
02:04:31.990 --> 02:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
thank you do you think it's a wise use
 
02:04:34.350 --> 02:04:34.360 align:start position:0%
of public funds to spend
 
02:04:37.709 --> 02:04:37.719 align:start position:0%
$50,000 per cook station for something
 
02:04:40.270 --> 02:04:40.280 align:start position:0%
that's being used relatively
 
02:04:43.069 --> 02:04:43.079 align:start position:0%
infrequently well we do have um uh
 
02:04:45.430 --> 02:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
multiple classes for The Culinary and as
 
02:04:48.510 --> 02:04:48.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh it's not just one class um
 
02:04:50.750 --> 02:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
and we also have students from Hudson
 
02:04:53.030 --> 02:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
but also as believe has mentioned Mr
 
02:04:54.270 --> 02:04:54.280 align:start position:0%
Maguire in one of your comments
 
02:04:56.069 --> 02:04:56.079 align:start position:0%
surrounding school districts also are
 
02:04:57.709 --> 02:04:57.719 align:start position:0%
part of our Career Technical education
 
02:05:00.149 --> 02:05:00.159 align:start position:0%
center for regional for the region um
 
02:05:01.910 --> 02:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
that were in um and most of those were
 
02:05:03.950 --> 02:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned but I I'd be remissed to say
 
02:05:05.390 --> 02:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
that one of those that wasn't mentioned
 
02:05:07.790 --> 02:05:07.800 align:start position:0%
was also Lichfield so Lichfield marac
 
02:05:09.990 --> 02:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
London der uh we do have some students
 
02:05:12.910 --> 02:05:12.920 align:start position:0%
from NASA Milford um and surrounding
 
02:05:14.830 --> 02:05:14.840 align:start position:0%
communities that utilize that so it's
 
02:05:16.910 --> 02:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
it's multiple classes not just one class
 
02:05:16.920 --> 02:05:18.669 align:start position:0%
it's multiple classes not just one class
per

02:05:18.669 --> 02:05:18.679 align:start position:0%
per
 
02:05:22.990 --> 02:05:23.000 align:start position:0%
day follow thank you
 
02:05:26.069 --> 02:05:26.079 align:start position:0%
so you know I I took such a class when I
 
02:05:28.510 --> 02:05:28.520 align:start position:0%
was in Middle School so I I sort of
 
02:05:30.830 --> 02:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate it but it it just seems like
 
02:05:31.990 --> 02:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
like a
 
02:05:34.990 --> 02:05:35.000 align:start position:0%
ridiculously large amount of money per
 
02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:36.709 align:start position:0%
ridiculously large amount of money per
student

02:05:36.709 --> 02:05:36.719 align:start position:0%
student
 
02:05:41.229 --> 02:05:41.239 align:start position:0%
um now one other question we heard that
 
02:05:43.870 --> 02:05:43.880 align:start position:0%
in general the state pays three4 of the
 
02:05:46.470 --> 02:05:46.480 align:start position:0%
costs of these programs would it make
 
02:05:48.910 --> 02:05:48.920 align:start position:0%
sense then for the state to pay three4
 
02:05:50.350 --> 02:05:50.360 align:start position:0%
of this
 
02:05:53.350 --> 02:05:53.360 align:start position:0%
cost again that's uh that's based upon I
 
02:05:56.470 --> 02:05:56.480 align:start position:0%
believe the how the formula Works um and
 
02:05:58.310 --> 02:05:58.320 align:start position:0%
again I would defer to the Department of
 
02:06:00.109 --> 02:06:00.119 align:start position:0%
Education they would understand that
 
02:06:02.750 --> 02:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
much more so uh than myself um to your
 
02:06:05.030 --> 02:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
other comment though Mr Maguire uh we do
 
02:06:06.830 --> 02:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
have other programs such as our welding
 
02:06:09.430 --> 02:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
program and uh engine repair program
 
02:06:12.589 --> 02:06:12.599 align:start position:0%
large uh auto automotive um there's a
 
02:06:14.069 --> 02:06:14.079 align:start position:0%
lot of equipment a lot of teaching
 
02:06:15.669 --> 02:06:15.679 align:start position:0%
equipment that is needed in those
 
02:06:19.709 --> 02:06:19.719 align:start position:0%
programs uh that are are costly um and I
 
02:06:21.310 --> 02:06:21.320 align:start position:0%
my question with a question back would
 
02:06:21.320 --> 02:06:22.310 align:start position:0%
my question with a question back would
be

02:06:22.310 --> 02:06:22.320 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:06:23.990 --> 02:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
I I would hope that this
 
02:06:26.390 --> 02:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
committee uh would would support
 
02:06:27.830 --> 02:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
students that are entering multiple
 
02:06:30.430 --> 02:06:30.440 align:start position:0%
different career Pathways uh going
 
02:06:32.709 --> 02:06:32.719 align:start position:0%
forward and and recognizing that yes
 
02:06:34.950 --> 02:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
some of those programs do cost a bit of
 
02:06:37.270 --> 02:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
money uh for students to access those
 
02:06:41.830 --> 02:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:45.470 --> 02:06:45.480 align:start position:0%
paths represent papich M thank you Mr
 
02:06:47.830 --> 02:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
chair and nice seeing you Mr Mullis
 
02:06:51.390 --> 02:06:51.400 align:start position:0%
after quite a few years um I will start
 
02:06:53.270 --> 02:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
by instead of asking a question just
 
02:06:56.510 --> 02:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
saying that I uh love seeing your career
 
02:06:58.830 --> 02:06:58.840 align:start position:0%
growth and I wish uh the district would
 
02:07:00.910 --> 02:07:00.920 align:start position:0%
have been able to retain your services
 
02:07:05.189 --> 02:07:05.199 align:start position:0%
but we were not you know able to and uh
 
02:07:07.390 --> 02:07:07.400 align:start position:0%
you know it's our loss but in terms of
 
02:07:09.430 --> 02:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
this particular question what's the
 
02:07:13.109 --> 02:07:13.119 align:start position:0%
expected uh you know lifetime of this
 
02:07:16.510 --> 02:07:16.520 align:start position:0%
equipment yeah great question um at a
 
02:07:18.990 --> 02:07:19.000 align:start position:0%
minimum it would be at a minimum I would
 
02:07:20.910 --> 02:07:20.920 align:start position:0%
say 20 to 25 years and they could last
 
02:07:23.549 --> 02:07:23.559 align:start position:0%
longer again um with any any facilities
 
02:07:24.950 --> 02:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
project I think back to our time in
 
02:07:27.709 --> 02:07:27.719 align:start position:0%
Windom with the preventative maintenance
 
02:07:29.990 --> 02:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
making sure you do the the PM work on
 
02:07:32.069 --> 02:07:32.079 align:start position:0%
those systems they can last well beyond
 
02:07:34.069 --> 02:07:34.079 align:start position:0%
20 25 years if you look at ventilation
 
02:07:36.629 --> 02:07:36.639 align:start position:0%
systems at a minimum you can get a good
 
02:07:38.549 --> 02:07:38.559 align:start position:0%
20 25 years I remember in my time in
 
02:07:40.870 --> 02:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
Windom we had ventilation systems were
 
02:07:43.510 --> 02:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
were a bit older and uh with the proper
 
02:07:45.470 --> 02:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
preventative maintenance they can extend
 
02:07:48.189 --> 02:07:48.199 align:start position:0%
that life and uh just uh one quick
 
02:07:50.390 --> 02:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
followup would you say that a
 
02:07:52.870 --> 02:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
significant reason of why these items
 
02:07:55.430 --> 02:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
are so expensive is that there are a lot
 
02:07:57.910 --> 02:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
of code and safety regulations that
 
02:08:00.549 --> 02:08:00.559 align:start position:0%
require certain capabilities of the
 
02:08:03.870 --> 02:08:03.880 align:start position:0%
equipment that is correct sir yes thank
 
02:08:06.470 --> 02:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
you you're welcome
 
02:08:09.470 --> 02:08:09.480 align:start position:0%
okay hack and Phillips thank you Mr
 
02:08:12.149 --> 02:08:12.159 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you Mr Mullis is that
 
02:08:15.470 --> 02:08:15.480 align:start position:0%
right y um for taking my question um we
 
02:08:16.990 --> 02:08:17.000 align:start position:0%
heard a lot from the Department of
 
02:08:20.270 --> 02:08:20.280 align:start position:0%
Education about the you know process
 
02:08:22.470 --> 02:08:22.480 align:start position:0%
miscommunication and their efforts to
 
02:08:24.870 --> 02:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
resolve that moving forward um I'm just
 
02:08:27.350 --> 02:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
wondering if Hudson's district has also
 
02:08:30.350 --> 02:08:30.360 align:start position:0%
done an internal review of um their
 
02:08:32.189 --> 02:08:32.199 align:start position:0%
administrative processes and try to
 
02:08:33.990 --> 02:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
prevent this kind of miscommunication
 
02:08:36.549 --> 02:08:36.559 align:start position:0%
again in the future well uh to speak
 
02:08:40.669 --> 02:08:40.679 align:start position:0%
very frankly um we had emails and
 
02:08:42.510 --> 02:08:42.520 align:start position:0%
correspondents that showed that we could
 
02:08:44.629 --> 02:08:44.639 align:start position:0%
move forward with that process I I do
 
02:08:47.669 --> 02:08:47.679 align:start position:0%
not believe anyone in our district uh
 
02:08:49.990 --> 02:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
misinterpreted that or misconstrued that
 
02:08:51.910 --> 02:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
um again I do think to Mr Mr Beard's
 
02:08:53.830 --> 02:08:53.840 align:start position:0%
Point um Miss White's point there was a
 
02:08:55.750 --> 02:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
miscommunication but we had every reason
 
02:08:57.669 --> 02:08:57.679 align:start position:0%
to believe to move forward and from an
 
02:08:59.510 --> 02:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
internal standpoint I I don't believe
 
02:09:00.910 --> 02:09:00.920 align:start position:0%
the district has done anything wrong we
 
02:09:03.030 --> 02:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
move forward based upon the information
 
02:09:03.040 --> 02:09:05.430 align:start position:0%
move forward based upon the information
we

02:09:05.430 --> 02:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:08.149 --> 02:09:08.159 align:start position:0%
had further from the
 
02:09:10.350 --> 02:09:10.360 align:start position:0%
committee there being none we'll close
 
02:09:12.950 --> 02:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
the hearing and I have the sign up sheet
 
02:09:17.790 --> 02:09:17.800 align:start position:0%
and only contains Dr mullis's signature
 
02:09:20.589 --> 02:09:20.599 align:start position:0%
in favor so that's thank you that's all
 
02:09:22.589 --> 02:09:22.599 align:start position:0%
we have in this commit comme I believe
 
02:09:25.589 --> 02:09:25.599 align:start position:0%
it'll be scheduled in division two when
 
02:09:28.109 --> 02:09:28.119 align:start position:0%
they get a chance after this I'd like to
 
02:09:31.350 --> 02:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a a uh a recess
 
02:09:32.990 --> 02:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
until one o'clock but I'd like to have a
 
02:09:35.189 --> 02:09:35.199 align:start position:0%
quick meeting with the three division
 
02:09:37.669 --> 02:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
chairs so we can talk about what we want
 
02:09:41.830 --> 02:09:41.840 align:start position:0%
to set up for um schedule for the next
 
02:09:44.030 --> 02:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
week because the deadline is at about
 
02:09:45.990 --> 02:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
one o'cl today so if you want to
 
02:09:47.270 --> 02:09:47.280 align:start position:0%
schedule something for next week
 
02:09:49.229 --> 02:09:49.239 align:start position:0%
probably division one might be the only
 
02:09:50.870 --> 02:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
one that has an division two is already
 
02:09:53.229 --> 02:09:53.239 align:start position:0%
scheduled for 11:00 next Tuesday next
 
02:09:56.589 --> 02:09:56.599 align:start position:0%

03:03:03.229 --> 03:03:03.239 align:start position:0%
order and at 1 o' we are scheduled to

hear Senate Bill 453 I'll call on the
 
03:03:13.429 --> 03:03:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:17.269 --> 03:03:17.279 align:start position:0%
gray thank you uh my name is James Gray
 
03:03:19.710 --> 03:03:19.720 align:start position:0%
I repres present Senate District 6 which
 
03:03:21.750 --> 03:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
starts up in Alton and gilon comes down
 
03:03:25.469 --> 03:03:25.479 align:start position:0%
Route 11 to the great City of Rochester
 
03:03:27.269 --> 03:03:27.279 align:start position:0%
and we don't want to miss Farmington you
 
03:03:29.110 --> 03:03:29.120 align:start position:0%
know you don't want to mess they don't
 
03:03:32.550 --> 03:03:32.560 align:start position:0%
want all mess with them and miss them so
 
03:03:34.990 --> 03:03:35.000 align:start position:0%
uh this bill uh
 
03:03:35.000 --> 03:03:37.429 align:start position:0%
uh this bill uh
certainly

03:03:37.429 --> 03:03:37.439 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
03:03:42.389 --> 03:03:42.399 align:start position:0%
uh it is to ensure that the efforts that
 
03:03:44.469 --> 03:03:44.479 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state is doing to
 
03:03:47.510 --> 03:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
update the database uh provides for the
 
03:03:51.110 --> 03:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
things that we do um many many many
 
03:03:54.070 --> 03:03:54.080 align:start position:0%
constituents tell me how hard it is to
 
03:03:57.950 --> 03:03:57.960 align:start position:0%
get to the town clerk how hard it is to
 
03:03:59.990 --> 03:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
be able to actually sit and meet with
 
03:04:03.229 --> 03:04:03.239 align:start position:0%
them and that they don't understand the
 
03:04:05.670 --> 03:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
process who do I go to when I want to
 
03:04:08.870 --> 03:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
change my party affiliation who do I go
 
03:04:12.309 --> 03:04:12.319 align:start position:0%
to when now I'm I'm recently married and
 
03:04:14.349 --> 03:04:14.359 align:start position:0%
I you know my name has changed and I
 
03:04:16.750 --> 03:04:16.760 align:start position:0%
want to do that and I've moved and all
 
03:04:18.670 --> 03:04:18.680 align:start position:0%
of this other thing
 
03:04:20.790 --> 03:04:20.800 align:start position:0%
well a lot of that
 
03:04:23.269 --> 03:04:23.279 align:start position:0%
information yeah you can do it on
 
03:04:25.990 --> 03:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
Election Day uh but sometimes it makes
 
03:04:28.710 --> 03:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
it more difficult uh especially if
 
03:04:32.550 --> 03:04:32.560 align:start position:0%
you've moved uh because right now if
 
03:04:35.349 --> 03:04:35.359 align:start position:0%
you've recently moved and you go to the
 
03:04:38.910 --> 03:04:38.920 align:start position:0%
town clerk and they can log into the
 
03:04:40.910 --> 03:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
database and they can see you're
 
03:04:43.469 --> 03:04:43.479 align:start position:0%
previously registered you don't have to
 
03:04:46.670 --> 03:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
prove age you don't have to prove
 
03:04:48.870 --> 03:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
citizenship what you need to prove is
 
03:04:51.349 --> 03:04:51.359 align:start position:0%
domicile and of course any of those
 
03:04:53.830 --> 03:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
proofs you need to prove identity along
 
03:04:57.750 --> 03:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
the way so the original bills that have
 
03:05:00.070 --> 03:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
been in here for the last two or three
 
03:05:04.110 --> 03:05:04.120 align:start position:0%
years uh in the house and in the Senate
 
03:05:07.389 --> 03:05:07.399 align:start position:0%
um specified all of the rsas that it
 
03:05:09.309 --> 03:05:09.319 align:start position:0%
didn't change and those are the ones
 
03:05:11.670 --> 03:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
that require a person who is registering
 
03:05:14.190 --> 03:05:14.200 align:start position:0%
to vote to meet with the supervisor the
 
03:05:16.990 --> 03:05:17.000 align:start position:0%
checklist or the so all of that is
 
03:05:19.950 --> 03:05:19.960 align:start position:0%
already really really in statute and all
 
03:05:21.990 --> 03:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
of the emails that I got when I got your
 
03:05:25.309 --> 03:05:25.319 align:start position:0%
house bill back on the portal that said
 
03:05:27.190 --> 03:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
oh this is going to allow people just to
 
03:05:31.269 --> 03:05:31.279 align:start position:0%
go register that's not the not the case
 
03:05:33.550 --> 03:05:33.560 align:start position:0%
and in the Senate I can tell you I will
 
03:05:35.469 --> 03:05:35.479 align:start position:0%
be writing an amendment to the house
 
03:05:39.309 --> 03:05:39.319 align:start position:0%
bill that came over uh that will specify
 
03:05:41.030 --> 03:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
that they can't complete the
 
03:05:44.510 --> 03:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
registration process without you know
 
03:05:46.630 --> 03:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
presenting their documents to either the
 
03:05:49.229 --> 03:05:49.239 align:start position:0%
clerk or or to the supervisor of the
 
03:05:52.229 --> 03:05:52.239 align:start position:0%
checklist uh it will go in and specify
 
03:05:53.750 --> 03:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
that the portal will have to have
 
03:05:56.910 --> 03:05:56.920 align:start position:0%
certain fields in there and among those
 
03:05:59.429 --> 03:05:59.439 align:start position:0%
fields will be the last four digits of
 
03:06:02.309 --> 03:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
the social security number and the
 
03:06:05.349 --> 03:06:05.359 align:start position:0%
driver's license number voter ID number
 
03:06:07.790 --> 03:06:07.800 align:start position:0%
or a box that says I don't have either
 
03:06:11.590 --> 03:06:11.600 align:start position:0%
one okay and again um in a different
 
03:06:13.950 --> 03:06:13.960 align:start position:0%
Bill probably I'm actually going to go
 
03:06:16.070 --> 03:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
in and and specify that those are
 
03:06:19.469 --> 03:06:19.479 align:start position:0%
mandatory fields for registering okay
 
03:06:22.469 --> 03:06:22.479 align:start position:0%
again trying to get us closer to the
 
03:06:25.990 --> 03:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
situation where you know uh people can
 
03:06:28.910 --> 03:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
go in and take care of as much of this
 
03:06:30.590 --> 03:06:30.600 align:start position:0%
and then just either have to drop the
 
03:06:33.269 --> 03:06:33.279 align:start position:0%
document off and say hey I am who I am
 
03:06:36.110 --> 03:06:36.120 align:start position:0%
here's my license uh there's no reason
 
03:06:38.710 --> 03:06:38.720 align:start position:0%
why a person if there's a long line to
 
03:06:41.110 --> 03:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
register on Election Day that if they
 
03:06:43.670 --> 03:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
could go into the portal and the portal
 
03:06:46.510 --> 03:06:46.520 align:start position:0%
say Hey you know your number is
 
03:06:49.469 --> 03:06:49.479 align:start position:0%
ab123 and you go up and say hey I just
 
03:06:51.229 --> 03:06:51.239 align:start position:0%
logged in I'm
 
03:06:55.229 --> 03:06:55.239 align:start position:0%
ab123 and then the person look at that
 
03:06:57.830 --> 03:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
look at the online not have to fill out
 
03:06:59.990 --> 03:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
any more forms except for something that
 
03:07:02.429 --> 03:07:02.439 align:start position:0%
just says you know you provided your
 
03:07:04.389 --> 03:07:04.399 align:start position:0%
documentation sign here that all the
 
03:07:07.429 --> 03:07:07.439 align:start position:0%
stuff is accurate so again we can get
 
03:07:08.990 --> 03:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
there and people
 
03:07:12.070 --> 03:07:12.080 align:start position:0%
now especially the younger Generations
 
03:07:15.309 --> 03:07:15.319 align:start position:0%
younger than I sh will say uh you know
 
03:07:17.309 --> 03:07:17.319 align:start position:0%
are expecting some of these things to be
 
03:07:19.630 --> 03:07:19.640 align:start position:0%
on online but we're not going to
 
03:07:22.110 --> 03:07:22.120 align:start position:0%
sacrifice our security of the system
 
03:07:24.389 --> 03:07:24.399 align:start position:0%
we're not going to sacrifice the other
 
03:07:27.309 --> 03:07:27.319 align:start position:0%
things but we want to give them place if
 
03:07:28.750 --> 03:07:28.760 align:start position:0%
you want to change your voter
 
03:07:31.269 --> 03:07:31.279 align:start position:0%
registration you know your your address
 
03:07:32.670 --> 03:07:32.680 align:start position:0%
your name
 
03:07:36.030 --> 03:07:36.040 align:start position:0%
whatever log on here and what'll happen
 
03:07:38.309 --> 03:07:38.319 align:start position:0%
is the system will take that information
 
03:07:41.910 --> 03:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
and it will provide it to the clerk and
 
03:07:44.590 --> 03:07:44.600 align:start position:0%
to the supervisor of the checklist as
 
03:07:47.950 --> 03:07:47.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate and for that information now
 
03:07:52.229 --> 03:07:52.239 align:start position:0%
change of address okay right now the uh
 
03:07:54.429 --> 03:07:54.439 align:start position:0%
change of address database that the post
 
03:07:57.710 --> 03:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
office has uh the permanent change of
 
03:08:00.070 --> 03:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
address if I've got that and I've got
 
03:08:02.790 --> 03:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
the person coming in saying this is my
 
03:08:05.110 --> 03:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
change of address is that sufficient
 
03:08:07.389 --> 03:08:07.399 align:start position:0%
well that's a question we need to answer
 
03:08:10.269 --> 03:08:10.279 align:start position:0%
if I've got a marriage record you know
 
03:08:12.269 --> 03:08:12.279 align:start position:0%
you come in and you say yeah I recently
 
03:08:14.229 --> 03:08:14.239 align:start position:0%
got married oh where did you get married
 
03:08:15.990 --> 03:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
I got married in New Hampshire you know
 
03:08:18.429 --> 03:08:18.439 align:start position:0%
what the clerks have got those records
 
03:08:20.229 --> 03:08:20.239 align:start position:0%
they've got all the vital records they
 
03:08:23.750 --> 03:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
can go look you up okay uh again so
 
03:08:25.550 --> 03:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of things that we can do
 
03:08:29.590 --> 03:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
and have actual records and documents to
 
03:08:31.830 --> 03:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
allow this process to go through and go
 
03:08:34.590 --> 03:08:34.600 align:start position:0%
through smoothly we just need to make
 
03:08:36.389 --> 03:08:36.399 align:start position:0%
sure that the
 
03:08:38.990 --> 03:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
database in the upgrades that we're
 
03:08:41.990 --> 03:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
doing to it are properly funded I do
 
03:08:44.229 --> 03:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
know that one of our our Representatives
 
03:08:47.150 --> 03:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
asked about the difference between 550
 
03:08:51.469 --> 03:08:51.479 align:start position:0%
million ion and 450 million uh thousand
 
03:08:55.269 --> 03:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
excuse me excuse me I I I you know I
 
03:08:57.510 --> 03:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
just came from fiscal you know and we
 
03:08:59.670 --> 03:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
we've been talking big big numbers so
 
03:09:03.229 --> 03:09:03.239 align:start position:0%
anyway and the thousands excuse my my my
 
03:09:07.790 --> 03:09:07.800 align:start position:0%
misspeak uh but uh one of the uh the
 
03:09:12.750 --> 03:09:12.760 align:start position:0%
Senators um uh has uh convinced the
 
03:09:15.269 --> 03:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
secretary of state that he can use uh
 
03:09:17.550 --> 03:09:17.560 align:start position:0%
some other funds uh to pay for that that
 
03:09:21.429 --> 03:09:21.439 align:start position:0%
extra 100,000 and again this is
 
03:09:24.229 --> 03:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
not there there are other changes in the
 
03:09:28.710 --> 03:09:28.720 align:start position:0%
database that you and I want uh and we
 
03:09:31.349 --> 03:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
also need to make sure that whatever we
 
03:09:33.550 --> 03:09:33.560 align:start position:0%
do that proper training is given to
 
03:09:35.950 --> 03:09:35.960 align:start position:0%
these officials so that they can
 
03:09:39.469 --> 03:09:39.479 align:start position:0%
understand what they can do uh and again
 
03:09:42.229 --> 03:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that the statute has to
 
03:09:44.870 --> 03:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
change uh but because you've sent me a
 
03:09:47.830 --> 03:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
bill that specifies certain things on
 
03:09:51.550 --> 03:09:51.560 align:start position:0%
the portal uh I am going to update that
 
03:09:54.469 --> 03:09:54.479 align:start position:0%
as I should say I'm going to write the
 
03:09:57.190 --> 03:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
amendment to update it and I believe it
 
03:09:59.870 --> 03:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
will pass the Senate to come back to you
 
03:10:02.030 --> 03:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
uh to make sure that we do maintain
 
03:10:05.510 --> 03:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
Integrity we do maintain uh control over
 
03:10:08.550 --> 03:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
that database and that people uh who are
 
03:10:10.150 --> 03:10:10.160 align:start position:0%
registering have
 
03:10:12.349 --> 03:10:12.359 align:start position:0%
presented uh in accordance with the
 
03:10:15.190 --> 03:10:15.200 align:start position:0%
existing statute uh remember that right
 
03:10:17.750 --> 03:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
now you can do all those things that we
 
03:10:19.630 --> 03:10:19.640 align:start position:0%
talked about in the portal you can send
 
03:10:21.990 --> 03:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
them an email you can write them a
 
03:10:25.750 --> 03:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
letter okay you can do all of those
 
03:10:29.030 --> 03:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
things by other means the portal just
 
03:10:31.190 --> 03:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
gives them that one place and you say
 
03:10:36.070 --> 03:10:36.080 align:start position:0%
hey go to NH dot dot dot and you can
 
03:10:38.229 --> 03:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
start the process and then they will
 
03:10:40.790 --> 03:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
converse with you either by email or
 
03:10:45.550 --> 03:10:45.560 align:start position:0%
whatever and uh right now the only place
 
03:10:47.710 --> 03:10:47.720 align:start position:0%
that you can actually go with without
 
03:10:51.469 --> 03:10:51.479 align:start position:0%
showing your documentation is if you're
 
03:10:54.030 --> 03:10:54.040 align:start position:0%
an absentee voter and you don't have
 
03:10:57.550 --> 03:10:57.560 align:start position:0%
time to register before the election um
 
03:11:00.229 --> 03:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
and that's the only time and certainly
 
03:11:03.229 --> 03:11:03.239 align:start position:0%
in that I also want to add in in their
 
03:11:05.550 --> 03:11:05.560 align:start position:0%
request they will also need to put in
 
03:11:07.309 --> 03:11:07.319 align:start position:0%
the last four digits of the social
 
03:11:09.710 --> 03:11:09.720 align:start position:0%
security number and either driver's
 
03:11:13.070 --> 03:11:13.080 align:start position:0%
license uh voter a non-driver ID or
 
03:11:14.710 --> 03:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
check a box that said they don't have
 
03:11:17.510 --> 03:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
either uh so again we're we're trying to
 
03:11:20.750 --> 03:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
make all of these things match up one
 
03:11:23.750 --> 03:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
problem I heard in the last
 
03:11:27.950 --> 03:11:27.960 align:start position:0%
election is same day registrant yep 20
 
03:11:29.790 --> 03:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
of them use an address that was an empty
 
03:11:33.510 --> 03:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
lot would this have caught that um I'm
 
03:11:35.229 --> 03:11:35.239 align:start position:0%
addressing that in a different way I had
 
03:11:37.190 --> 03:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
a meeting in my office yesterday with
 
03:11:40.110 --> 03:11:40.120 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office and their
 
03:11:43.550 --> 03:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
investigator uh Mr Tracy uh and the
 
03:11:45.750 --> 03:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State and what we're
 
03:11:48.229 --> 03:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
looking at is taking that investigating
 
03:11:51.550 --> 03:11:51.560 align:start position:0%
part and moving it to election day
 
03:11:54.670 --> 03:11:54.680 align:start position:0%
creating a group that can sit there uh
 
03:11:58.910 --> 03:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
right now uh Mr Tracy says that he has
 
03:12:02.550 --> 03:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
access to the TransUnion database and if
 
03:12:05.030 --> 03:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
any of your familiar TransUnion is one
 
03:12:07.750 --> 03:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
of the three major credit uh
 
03:12:10.110 --> 03:12:10.120 align:start position:0%
organizations and in that database they
 
03:12:13.630 --> 03:12:13.640 align:start position:0%
have lots of information so if I type in
 
03:12:17.710 --> 03:12:17.720 align:start position:0%
we'll say uh you know Jess Edwards uh
 
03:12:20.990 --> 03:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
okay and I say uh that he was born on
 
03:12:25.910 --> 03:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
this day okay um and then an added bodus
 
03:12:27.510 --> 03:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
would be the last four digits of the
 
03:12:29.750 --> 03:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
social security number I can pretty much
 
03:12:32.110 --> 03:12:32.120 align:start position:0%
confirm that Jess Edwards does live at a
 
03:12:33.990 --> 03:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
particular place it will give me at
 
03:12:36.269 --> 03:12:36.279 align:start position:0%
least a a previous address if not the
 
03:12:39.550 --> 03:12:39.560 align:start position:0%
current address uh because of moving but
 
03:12:43.070 --> 03:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
then remember I also have access um
 
03:12:45.349 --> 03:12:45.359 align:start position:0%
through the uh permanent change of
 
03:12:47.429 --> 03:12:47.439 align:start position:0%
address database from the United States
 
03:12:49.990 --> 03:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
post office and we're also looking at
 
03:12:51.790 --> 03:12:51.800 align:start position:0%
what information that I can get from the
 
03:12:54.790 --> 03:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
Social Security again so so this is not
 
03:12:58.110 --> 03:12:58.120 align:start position:0%
done in a vacuum okay we need to make
 
03:13:00.750 --> 03:13:00.760 align:start position:0%
sure that each one of these parts of the
 
03:13:05.110 --> 03:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
law you know can uh request the same
 
03:13:08.269 --> 03:13:08.279 align:start position:0%
information and uh that we consistently
 
03:13:10.870 --> 03:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
do it and that when I once I provided
 
03:13:12.830 --> 03:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
that information through one of these
 
03:13:15.830 --> 03:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
things that I've copied that information
 
03:13:17.590 --> 03:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
into the database in the the proper
 
03:13:20.269 --> 03:13:20.279 align:start position:0%
fields which already exist the proper
 
03:13:22.630 --> 03:13:22.640 align:start position:0%
Fields they're just optional right now
 
03:13:23.870 --> 03:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
instead of being
 
03:13:26.550 --> 03:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
mandatory would you take any
 
03:13:28.590 --> 03:13:28.600 align:start position:0%
questions I'm here for you
 
03:13:30.070 --> 03:13:30.080 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham for a question
 
03:13:31.950 --> 03:13:31.960 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for your testimony and
 
03:13:34.070 --> 03:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question uh this
 
03:13:36.030 --> 03:13:36.040 align:start position:0%
bill seems to principally deal with an
 
03:13:38.070 --> 03:13:38.080 align:start position:0%
appropriation for the Statewide voter
 
03:13:40.429 --> 03:13:40.439 align:start position:0%
registration system uh without really
 
03:13:42.910 --> 03:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
talking about where the appropriation
 
03:13:45.030 --> 03:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
other than being directed in that
 
03:13:48.030 --> 03:13:48.040 align:start position:0%
direction uh is um
 
03:13:51.910 --> 03:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh is to be used but um uh I'm kind of
 
03:13:54.590 --> 03:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
curious why uh you know this kind of
 
03:13:57.150 --> 03:13:57.160 align:start position:0%
Standalone Financial bill is required
 
03:13:59.030 --> 03:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
now in the middle of the bium rather
 
03:14:01.070 --> 03:14:01.080 align:start position:0%
than being included in the budget what
 
03:14:04.070 --> 03:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
has changed uh to require a special
 
03:14:07.110 --> 03:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
appropriation outside of cycle well the
 
03:14:09.389 --> 03:14:09.399 align:start position:0%
Senate did include it in there and then
 
03:14:12.750 --> 03:14:12.760 align:start position:0%
there was a meeting uh between certain
 
03:14:14.590 --> 03:14:14.600 align:start position:0%
factions both in the house and the
 
03:14:18.190 --> 03:14:18.200 align:start position:0%
Senate uh that decided to take it out of
 
03:14:22.110 --> 03:14:22.120 align:start position:0%
the budget at that time uh and uh there
 
03:14:25.389 --> 03:14:25.399 align:start position:0%
were other things that were going on uh
 
03:14:28.229 --> 03:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
there was legislation in the house that
 
03:14:30.830 --> 03:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
uh uh certainly we would like to have
 
03:14:33.870 --> 03:14:33.880 align:start position:0%
seen passed that didn't pass uh and all
 
03:14:36.550 --> 03:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
of those things come together uh but
 
03:14:39.670 --> 03:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
right now uh the reason that I want to
 
03:14:41.950 --> 03:14:41.960 align:start position:0%
push it Forward is because they are
 
03:14:44.630 --> 03:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
right now uh updating that database and
 
03:14:46.830 --> 03:14:46.840 align:start position:0%
the secretary's office I'm sure will
 
03:14:49.830 --> 03:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
talk talk more about that uh but uh the
 
03:14:51.870 --> 03:14:51.880 align:start position:0%
sooner I can get that and the more you
 
03:14:53.670 --> 03:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
know I can get it combined together with
 
03:14:56.190 --> 03:14:56.200 align:start position:0%
the other things that you're doing uh I
 
03:14:58.429 --> 03:14:58.439 align:start position:0%
don't know you know I I did some
 
03:15:00.750 --> 03:15:00.760 align:start position:0%
programming when I was an engineer down
 
03:15:02.990 --> 03:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
at the ports Naval Shipyard and The
 
03:15:05.349 --> 03:15:05.359 align:start position:0%
Closer I Get get to the time that I
 
03:15:07.309 --> 03:15:07.319 align:start position:0%
actually wrote the code in the beginning
 
03:15:09.790 --> 03:15:09.800 align:start position:0%
the quicker it was for me to modify it
 
03:15:11.790 --> 03:15:11.800 align:start position:0%
because you know I'd forget this and I'd
 
03:15:14.070 --> 03:15:14.080 align:start position:0%
forget that and then that wouldn't work
 
03:15:17.110 --> 03:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
right you know so again you getting this
 
03:15:19.070 --> 03:15:19.080 align:start position:0%
stuff getting it into the database
 
03:15:22.030 --> 03:15:22.040 align:start position:0%
getting it all you know is the reason to
 
03:15:25.030 --> 03:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
push it Forward um and it's not that it
 
03:15:27.630 --> 03:15:27.640 align:start position:0%
wasn't considered last time uh there
 
03:15:31.510 --> 03:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
were things that were agreed to uh that
 
03:15:34.030 --> 03:15:34.040 align:start position:0%
didn't happen and therefore the funding
 
03:15:37.030 --> 03:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
was taken out of the the the bill the
 
03:15:39.750 --> 03:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
last time uh as you remember that the
 
03:15:42.710 --> 03:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
bill that you sent to the house finance
 
03:15:45.550 --> 03:15:45.560 align:start position:0%
uh that uh as chair of Finance we cut
 
03:15:45.560 --> 03:15:47.110 align:start position:0%
uh that uh as chair of Finance we cut
750

03:15:47.110 --> 03:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
750
 
03:15:49.429 --> 03:15:49.439 align:start position:0%
million do and I did get the million
 
03:15:53.030 --> 03:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
right that time representative H uh out
 
03:15:55.510 --> 03:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
of that budget and and you guys passed
 
03:15:58.309 --> 03:15:58.319 align:start position:0%
it with an overwhelming majority thank
 
03:16:01.750 --> 03:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
you questions represent tki thank you Mr
 
03:16:03.309 --> 03:16:03.319 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you senator for taking my
 
03:16:06.070 --> 03:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
question um I apologize I entered while
 
03:16:07.990 --> 03:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
you were um presenting the bill however
 
03:16:10.070 --> 03:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
you made a comment that I think I heard
 
03:16:13.070 --> 03:16:13.080 align:start position:0%
correctly that there was some discussion
 
03:16:15.349 --> 03:16:15.359 align:start position:0%
um in Senate election law about using
 
03:16:17.550 --> 03:16:17.560 align:start position:0%
alternative funds I assume
 
03:16:20.269 --> 03:16:20.279 align:start position:0%
you were referring to Hava funds or am I
 
03:16:21.510 --> 03:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
mistaken on that and did that go
 
03:16:23.830 --> 03:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
anywhere with an amendment uh because
 
03:16:25.990 --> 03:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
the bill doesn't specify where the
 
03:16:29.030 --> 03:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
secretary gets the money from uh he has
 
03:16:33.590 --> 03:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
money that is um possibly Hava money you
 
03:16:36.389 --> 03:16:36.399 align:start position:0%
know possibly other funds so where he
 
03:16:39.550 --> 03:16:39.560 align:start position:0%
takes the money from um is not one of
 
03:16:41.750 --> 03:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
the decisions I have to make and
 
03:16:44.469 --> 03:16:44.479 align:start position:0%
certainly when he comes up to testify or
 
03:16:47.309 --> 03:16:47.319 align:start position:0%
the deputy comes up to testify um he or
 
03:16:51.150 --> 03:16:51.160 align:start position:0%
she can can Enlighten you more on that
 
03:16:55.710 --> 03:16:55.720 align:start position:0%
uh but again you know it's they have an
 
03:16:58.590 --> 03:16:58.600 align:start position:0%
an appropriation okay and the way they
 
03:17:00.670 --> 03:17:00.680 align:start position:0%
spend that appropriation and the way
 
03:17:03.830 --> 03:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
they spend Hava money is all controlled
 
03:17:07.389 --> 03:17:07.399 align:start position:0%
by other things and so if I were to say
 
03:17:09.309 --> 03:17:09.319 align:start position:0%
he's going to take it out of Hava I
 
03:17:11.349 --> 03:17:11.359 align:start position:0%
could be wrong because he may take it
 
03:17:13.870 --> 03:17:13.880 align:start position:0%
out of a different uh account that he
 
03:17:17.070 --> 03:17:17.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't need that money in or he may may
 
03:17:19.790 --> 03:17:19.800 align:start position:0%
take it out of hav money again it's not
 
03:17:21.910 --> 03:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
not anything we need to control thank
 
03:17:23.309 --> 03:17:23.319 align:start position:0%
you I just wanted to clarify that it
 
03:17:24.550 --> 03:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
what there was no discussion of an
 
03:17:26.150 --> 03:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
amendment for it thank you very much
 
03:17:28.950 --> 03:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
yeah further questions from committee
 
03:17:31.469 --> 03:17:31.479 align:start position:0%
members seeing none thank you Senator I
 
03:17:33.910 --> 03:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
would like to stay but I've understood
 
03:17:36.670 --> 03:17:36.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:38.750 --> 03:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
street then we'll next hear from the
 
03:17:48.990 --> 03:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:50.389 --> 03:17:50.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
03:17:52.950 --> 03:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
committee I'm David scandin Secretary of
 
03:17:56.189 --> 03:17:56.199 align:start position:0%
State and I'm here in support uh of this
 
03:18:01.349 --> 03:18:01.359 align:start position:0%
bill um over the last two years uh my
 
03:18:03.510 --> 03:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
office has been very aggressively
 
03:18:05.950 --> 03:18:05.960 align:start position:0%
upgrading the electronic systems that we
 
03:18:08.990 --> 03:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
have really across the department but
 
03:18:12.550 --> 03:18:12.560 align:start position:0%
specifically elections related systems
 
03:18:14.630 --> 03:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
and last week we had our new campaign
 
03:18:17.389 --> 03:18:17.399 align:start position:0%
Finance system uh go online
 
03:18:19.950 --> 03:18:19.960 align:start position:0%
uh we had the help of some of you and
 
03:18:22.309 --> 03:18:22.319 align:start position:0%
other members of the legislature testing
 
03:18:24.870 --> 03:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
that system out to make sure that it was
 
03:18:27.070 --> 03:18:27.080 align:start position:0%
going to be functional and and you know
 
03:18:30.030 --> 03:18:30.040 align:start position:0%
work well and it was a successful roll
 
03:18:32.870 --> 03:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
out and uh looks like it's going to work
 
03:18:35.750 --> 03:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
well for the upcoming election uh in the
 
03:18:38.590 --> 03:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
next two weeks uh we plan to roll out
 
03:18:41.550 --> 03:18:41.560 align:start position:0%
the uh brand new voter registration
 
03:18:44.150 --> 03:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
database which is going to replace the
 
03:18:48.030 --> 03:18:48.040 align:start position:0%
20 plus year old Legacy system and uh
 
03:18:50.950 --> 03:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
you know we expect that that is going to
 
03:18:54.150 --> 03:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
uh have a lot of functionality and be a
 
03:18:56.349 --> 03:18:56.359 align:start position:0%
major Improvement to our local election
 
03:18:59.550 --> 03:18:59.560 align:start position:0%
officials who are actually the ones that
 
03:19:01.870 --> 03:19:01.880 align:start position:0%
put the information into the database
 
03:19:03.469 --> 03:19:03.479 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist are the
 
03:19:06.269 --> 03:19:06.279 align:start position:0%
only ones that can remove names uh from
 
03:19:08.510 --> 03:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
the voter checklist and you know it's
 
03:19:11.309 --> 03:19:11.319 align:start position:0%
our hope that uh we will save them quite
 
03:19:12.870 --> 03:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
a bit of
 
03:19:16.429 --> 03:19:16.439 align:start position:0%
time in doing their jobs uh the bow law
 
03:19:19.150 --> 03:19:19.160 align:start position:0%
Commission after a fairly lengthy uh
 
03:19:22.510 --> 03:19:22.520 align:start position:0%
review and testing process has approved
 
03:19:25.349 --> 03:19:25.359 align:start position:0%
two new electronic ballot counting
 
03:19:30.070 --> 03:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
devices uh one has met the uh the
 
03:19:31.670 --> 03:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
conditional approval and and the
 
03:19:34.150 --> 03:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
certification requirements a company
 
03:19:36.110 --> 03:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
called voting Works which uses open-
 
03:19:39.710 --> 03:19:39.720 align:start position:0%
Source software code uh uh in the
 
03:19:42.150 --> 03:19:42.160 align:start position:0%
programming of that device uh that was
 
03:19:44.710 --> 03:19:44.720 align:start position:0%
used in five towns during the local
 
03:19:47.189 --> 03:19:47.199 align:start position:0%
elections this past March
 
03:19:49.630 --> 03:19:49.640 align:start position:0%
and we expect expanded use with that
 
03:19:53.070 --> 03:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
device for the upcoming fall elections
 
03:19:54.990 --> 03:19:55.000 align:start position:0%
the second device is one that's
 
03:19:57.189 --> 03:19:57.199 align:start position:0%
manufactured by Dominion a name that I'm
 
03:19:59.910 --> 03:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
sure all of you have heard uh the
 
03:20:02.710 --> 03:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
certification is not expected on that
 
03:20:06.229 --> 03:20:06.239 align:start position:0%
until sometime this fall which puts it
 
03:20:08.750 --> 03:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
beyond the ability to use for the fall
 
03:20:10.710 --> 03:20:10.720 align:start position:0%
elections but most likely will be
 
03:20:14.469 --> 03:20:14.479 align:start position:0%
available for Town elections in the
 
03:20:17.309 --> 03:20:17.319 align:start position:0%
spring and then the
 
03:20:19.950 --> 03:20:19.960 align:start position:0%
uh at least once a week we're getting
 
03:20:22.070 --> 03:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
requests from towns to be to be approved
 
03:20:26.269 --> 03:20:26.279 align:start position:0%
for the use of electronic Pole books um
 
03:20:29.510 --> 03:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
which is a way to keep track of
 
03:20:32.670 --> 03:20:32.680 align:start position:0%
check-ins and uh and collecting the data
 
03:20:34.550 --> 03:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
needed to file the return of votes at
 
03:20:37.389 --> 03:20:37.399 align:start position:0%
the end of the day uh they still have to
 
03:20:39.630 --> 03:20:39.640 align:start position:0%
do it in parallel with a paper checklist
 
03:20:41.510 --> 03:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
but it is saving the local election
 
03:20:45.189 --> 03:20:45.199 align:start position:0%
officials a tremendous amount of time uh
 
03:20:47.630 --> 03:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
in terms of V voters being able to check
 
03:20:50.309 --> 03:20:50.319 align:start position:0%
in getting results uh that they need to
 
03:20:52.469 --> 03:20:52.479 align:start position:0%
report at the end of the night and then
 
03:20:55.110 --> 03:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
the transfer of the electronic data they
 
03:20:57.429 --> 03:20:57.439 align:start position:0%
that they collected directly into the
 
03:20:58.710 --> 03:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
Statewide voter
 
03:21:02.429 --> 03:21:02.439 align:start position:0%
database so this bill uh calling for a
 
03:21:06.630 --> 03:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
voter portal is uh is timely uh
 
03:21:08.110 --> 03:21:08.120 align:start position:0%
especially because of the new voter
 
03:21:10.150 --> 03:21:10.160 align:start position:0%
registration database I'm not going to
 
03:21:12.870 --> 03:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
repeat the testimony of Senator gray but
 
03:21:16.950 --> 03:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
I would just add uh a couple of items on
 
03:21:19.790 --> 03:21:19.800 align:start position:0%
that first uh I was clear from the
 
03:21:21.910 --> 03:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
beginning in terms of a voter portal
 
03:21:23.790 --> 03:21:23.800 align:start position:0%
that the only way that I would support
 
03:21:26.710 --> 03:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
it if it maintains the
 
03:21:30.189 --> 03:21:30.199 align:start position:0%
current processes uh and statutory
 
03:21:32.830 --> 03:21:32.840 align:start position:0%
requirements for a voter registering to
 
03:21:36.550 --> 03:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
vote which means that a voter has to
 
03:21:36.560 --> 03:21:38.590 align:start position:0%
vote which means that a voter has to
provide

03:21:38.590 --> 03:21:38.600 align:start position:0%
provide
 
03:21:41.670 --> 03:21:41.680 align:start position:0%
uh information showing their
 
03:21:45.349 --> 03:21:45.359 align:start position:0%
qualifications of age identity domicile
 
03:21:48.309 --> 03:21:48.319 align:start position:0%
and citizenship
 
03:21:50.790 --> 03:21:50.800 align:start position:0%
uh and that when they show up either for
 
03:21:52.750 --> 03:21:52.760 align:start position:0%
the first time to vote on Election Day
 
03:21:54.670 --> 03:21:54.680 align:start position:0%
or they make a visit to the clerk's
 
03:21:56.590 --> 03:21:56.600 align:start position:0%
office they have to sign the voter
 
03:21:58.870 --> 03:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
registration form and show their
 
03:22:00.590 --> 03:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
documentation whether it's an actual
 
03:22:03.910 --> 03:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
document or uh a an affidavit that is
 
03:22:07.830 --> 03:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
currently allowed uh for them to
 
03:22:12.070 --> 03:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
participate the advantage that I see is
 
03:22:14.349 --> 03:22:14.359 align:start position:0%
that this will really help local
 
03:22:17.070 --> 03:22:17.080 align:start position:0%
election officials uh especially
 
03:22:19.950 --> 03:22:19.960 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist who now
 
03:22:23.389 --> 03:22:23.399 align:start position:0%
have to take data that is sometimes not
 
03:22:26.429 --> 03:22:26.439 align:start position:0%
legibly written on voter registration
 
03:22:28.630 --> 03:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
application forms and then having to
 
03:22:32.070 --> 03:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
read that and then hand key it into the
 
03:22:34.349 --> 03:22:34.359 align:start position:0%
uh voter database which creates the
 
03:22:37.389 --> 03:22:37.399 align:start position:0%
checklist is certainly prone to error
 
03:22:39.229 --> 03:22:39.239 align:start position:0%
and to the extent that we now have the
 
03:22:42.469 --> 03:22:42.479 align:start position:0%
voters have the ability to provide that
 
03:22:46.910 --> 03:22:46.920 align:start position:0%
data already uh typed out on the form
 
03:22:49.269 --> 03:22:49.279 align:start position:0%
it's an electronic format so that the
 
03:22:52.189 --> 03:22:52.199 align:start position:0%
supervisors can review it they can
 
03:22:54.150 --> 03:22:54.160 align:start position:0%
approve it after they get all the
 
03:22:56.469 --> 03:22:56.479 align:start position:0%
signatures and the documentation and
 
03:22:57.990 --> 03:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
then they can simply transfer that
 
03:23:00.389 --> 03:23:00.399 align:start position:0%
electronic data uh to the voter
 
03:23:03.189 --> 03:23:03.199 align:start position:0%
registration database which means that
 
03:23:06.550 --> 03:23:06.560 align:start position:0%
overall our the data in the database is
 
03:23:08.710 --> 03:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
going to be much cleaner than it has
 
03:23:13.150 --> 03:23:13.160 align:start position:0%
been uh uh before so uh those are the
 
03:23:16.510 --> 03:23:16.520 align:start position:0%
significant improvements that I see uh
 
03:23:17.389 --> 03:23:17.399 align:start position:0%
because of
 
03:23:22.429 --> 03:23:22.439 align:start position:0%
this um in terms of the funding uh the
 
03:23:25.710 --> 03:23:25.720 align:start position:0%
original appropriation was
 
03:23:28.429 --> 03:23:28.439 align:start position:0%
$550,000 uh in the Senate I committed to
 
03:23:31.150 --> 03:23:31.160 align:start position:0%
the committee that we could use $100,000
 
03:23:34.229 --> 03:23:34.239 align:start position:0%
in Hava funds uh to help cover the cost
 
03:23:38.950 --> 03:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
of that um and so the appropriation as
 
03:23:41.229 --> 03:23:41.239 align:start position:0%
amended now is
 
03:23:43.349 --> 03:23:43.359 align:start position:0%
$450,000 with that Mr chairman I'd be
 
03:23:45.790 --> 03:23:45.800 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions thank you
 
03:23:47.429 --> 03:23:47.439 align:start position:0%
questions from committee members
 
03:23:49.710 --> 03:23:49.720 align:start position:0%
represent representative Edwards uh
 
03:23:51.590 --> 03:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr
 
03:23:54.670 --> 03:23:54.680 align:start position:0%
secretary I I I know how important
 
03:23:57.630 --> 03:23:57.640 align:start position:0%
election Integrity is to you and and I
 
03:23:59.550 --> 03:23:59.560 align:start position:0%
and and I hear what you're saying from
 
03:24:02.030 --> 03:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
the perspective of this is going to make
 
03:24:04.710 --> 03:24:04.720 align:start position:0%
uh all of our U Town
 
03:24:07.510 --> 03:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
functionaries more productive and have
 
03:24:10.590 --> 03:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
less errors I get all of that but uh I
 
03:24:14.070 --> 03:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
think you've heard and felt the concerns
 
03:24:17.990 --> 03:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
in the state over uh election integrity
 
03:24:21.950 --> 03:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
and the fear that this is going to be
 
03:24:26.110 --> 03:24:26.120 align:start position:0%
just a a portal into online registration
 
03:24:28.590 --> 03:24:28.600 align:start position:0%
and so if you could could you just make
 
03:24:32.510 --> 03:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
the best succinct argument you can why
 
03:24:34.349 --> 03:24:34.359 align:start position:0%
this is going to actually improve
 
03:24:36.349 --> 03:24:36.359 align:start position:0%
election Integrity if if there is an
 
03:24:39.349 --> 03:24:39.359 align:start position:0%
argument for that and and maybe the flip
 
03:24:41.229 --> 03:24:41.239 align:start position:0%
side of it from an academic perspective
 
03:24:43.510 --> 03:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
what are your greatest concerns
 
03:24:45.510 --> 03:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
regarding election Integrity with this
 
03:24:48.830 --> 03:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:52.309 --> 03:24:52.319 align:start position:0%
the benefit is going to be the ability
 
03:24:55.229 --> 03:24:55.239 align:start position:0%
to have more accurate data going into
 
03:24:57.630 --> 03:24:57.640 align:start position:0%
the voter registration database itself
 
03:25:00.389 --> 03:25:00.399 align:start position:0%
so that we don't have the clerical
 
03:25:03.510 --> 03:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
errors that are made by volunteers who
 
03:25:06.110 --> 03:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
are taking hundreds and thousands of
 
03:25:07.910 --> 03:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
voter registration
 
03:25:11.150 --> 03:25:11.160 align:start position:0%
applications uh that are handwritten uh
 
03:25:13.990 --> 03:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
currently and then having to read that
 
03:25:17.030 --> 03:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
and then uh enter that data
 
03:25:19.349 --> 03:25:19.359 align:start position:0%
manually into the voter registration
 
03:25:21.510 --> 03:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
database to the extent that it's the
 
03:25:23.710 --> 03:25:23.720 align:start position:0%
voter providing the data and the
 
03:25:25.790 --> 03:25:25.800 align:start position:0%
expectation is that you know it would be
 
03:25:27.990 --> 03:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
accurate in the first
 
03:25:31.910 --> 03:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
instance uh there would be no changes
 
03:25:34.670 --> 03:25:34.680 align:start position:0%
along the way you know from that data
 
03:25:40.990 --> 03:25:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:44.150 --> 03:25:44.160 align:start position:0%
eventually New Hampshire is unique among
 
03:25:48.870 --> 03:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
the states and and our systems are very
 
03:25:51.630 --> 03:25:51.640 align:start position:0%
different than most every other state in
 
03:25:53.830 --> 03:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
the country I'm sure all of you have
 
03:25:55.309 --> 03:25:55.319 align:start position:0%
heard of Motor Voter and the national
 
03:25:59.389 --> 03:25:59.399 align:start position:0%
voter registration act uh of 1992 or
 
03:25:59.399 --> 03:26:00.990 align:start position:0%
voter registration act uh of 1992 or
93

03:26:00.990 --> 03:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
93
 
03:26:06.349 --> 03:26:06.359 align:start position:0%
um that system allowed for uh actually
 
03:26:11.269 --> 03:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
required uh state
 
03:26:14.389 --> 03:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
agencies uh focusing on Motor Vehicles
 
03:26:16.830 --> 03:26:16.840 align:start position:0%
to collect a voter Reg
 
03:26:21.870 --> 03:26:21.880 align:start position:0%
ations uh and uh you know and and enter
 
03:26:24.189 --> 03:26:24.199 align:start position:0%
voters into the system in addition to
 
03:26:26.429 --> 03:26:26.439 align:start position:0%
motor vehicles uh Departments of
 
03:26:28.189 --> 03:26:28.199 align:start position:0%
Education Departments of Health and
 
03:26:28.199 --> 03:26:29.070 align:start position:0%
Education Departments of Health and
Human

03:26:29.070 --> 03:26:29.080 align:start position:0%
Human
 
03:26:31.830 --> 03:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
Services uh or agencies where there is
 
03:26:31.840 --> 03:26:33.269 align:start position:0%
Services uh or agencies where there is
public

03:26:33.269 --> 03:26:33.279 align:start position:0%
public
 
03:26:37.150 --> 03:26:37.160 align:start position:0%
Outreach uh where uh federal government
 
03:26:39.750 --> 03:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
requires that you know those be voter
 
03:26:39.760 --> 03:26:41.229 align:start position:0%
requires that you know those be voter
registration

03:26:41.229 --> 03:26:41.239 align:start position:0%
registration
 
03:26:44.590 --> 03:26:44.600 align:start position:0%
agencies any member of the public in one
 
03:26:46.349 --> 03:26:46.359 align:start position:0%
of these states with Motor Voter can
 
03:26:48.990 --> 03:26:49.000 align:start position:0%
walk down the street and collect voter
 
03:26:51.349 --> 03:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
registrations simply by having
 
03:26:54.030 --> 03:26:54.040 align:start position:0%
individuals fill out registration cards
 
03:26:56.469 --> 03:26:56.479 align:start position:0%
and you may have heard of a situation
 
03:26:59.349 --> 03:26:59.359 align:start position:0%
with a organization called Acorn some
 
03:27:02.630 --> 03:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
years ago uh who were they were paid to
 
03:27:05.469 --> 03:27:05.479 align:start position:0%
go out and collect signatures and
 
03:27:07.590 --> 03:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
because of the money involved I mean
 
03:27:10.469 --> 03:27:10.479 align:start position:0%
some of the sign some of the collections
 
03:27:11.750 --> 03:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
were not
 
03:27:14.030 --> 03:27:14.040 align:start position:0%
actual individuals they were just filled
 
03:27:16.550 --> 03:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
out to collect the money um and so real
 
03:27:18.950 --> 03:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
problems with
 
03:27:22.750 --> 03:27:22.760 align:start position:0%
that what is special with New Hampshire
 
03:27:27.309 --> 03:27:27.319 align:start position:0%
is that a voter has to appear before a
 
03:27:28.950 --> 03:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
local election official somebody from
 
03:27:32.150 --> 03:27:32.160 align:start position:0%
their Community one of their neighbors
 
03:27:37.790 --> 03:27:37.800 align:start position:0%
to apply for uh being a voter um and
 
03:27:39.150 --> 03:27:39.160 align:start position:0%
they do that when they sign the
 
03:27:41.910 --> 03:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
application form uh and and the
 
03:27:44.229 --> 03:27:44.239 align:start position:0%
affidavits that might be involved and
 
03:27:45.910 --> 03:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
usually they do it on Election Day when
 
03:27:45.920 --> 03:27:46.710 align:start position:0%
usually they do it on Election Day when
they

03:27:46.710 --> 03:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
they
 
03:27:48.309 --> 03:27:48.319 align:start position:0%
go to vote for the first time and they
 
03:27:50.990 --> 03:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
register at the polling place but they
 
03:27:53.510 --> 03:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
can also go into a clerk's office and do
 
03:27:56.750 --> 03:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
it or they can go to a session of uh the
 
03:27:59.030 --> 03:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist I'm not
 
03:28:01.229 --> 03:28:01.239 align:start position:0%
aware that that actually happens in any
 
03:28:03.189 --> 03:28:03.199 align:start position:0%
other state in the country and that's
 
03:28:07.150 --> 03:28:07.160 align:start position:0%
one of the strengths of our system
 
03:28:11.110 --> 03:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
um uh because we have people that know
 
03:28:12.870 --> 03:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
the community and and know the people in
 
03:28:15.189 --> 03:28:15.199 align:start position:0%
it that are responsible for this and not
 
03:28:18.150 --> 03:28:18.160 align:start position:0%
just some bureaucrat in a in a city that
 
03:28:21.870 --> 03:28:21.880 align:start position:0%
is 100 miles away uh doing that same
 
03:28:25.229 --> 03:28:25.239 align:start position:0%
job what is my biggest fear in in
 
03:28:26.590 --> 03:28:26.600 align:start position:0%
maintaining the Integrity of the
 
03:28:28.990 --> 03:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
election process
 
03:28:33.469 --> 03:28:33.479 align:start position:0%
um any electronic system is vulnerable
 
03:28:35.110 --> 03:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
uh to being hap
 
03:28:39.670 --> 03:28:39.680 align:start position:0%
hacked and and we have to be vigilant
 
03:28:42.389 --> 03:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
about that you know that danger can be
 
03:28:45.790 --> 03:28:45.800 align:start position:0%
mitigated quite a bit and I can tell you
 
03:28:45.800 --> 03:28:47.070 align:start position:0%
mitigated quite a bit and I can tell you
uh

03:28:47.070 --> 03:28:47.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:28:48.990 --> 03:28:49.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is
 
03:28:51.670 --> 03:28:51.680 align:start position:0%
probably uh one of the strongest States
 
03:28:53.349 --> 03:28:53.359 align:start position:0%
currently in the steps that we are
 
03:28:57.750 --> 03:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
taking to protect our uh elections
 
03:29:01.110 --> 03:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
systems and we're doing that by having
 
03:29:04.229 --> 03:29:04.239 align:start position:0%
third-party vendors uh uh that are
 
03:29:06.349 --> 03:29:06.359 align:start position:0%
experts in this field some of them are
 
03:29:11.349 --> 03:29:11.359 align:start position:0%
are former military um uh technology uh
 
03:29:13.910 --> 03:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
experts um and we're doing a number of
 
03:29:16.389 --> 03:29:16.399 align:start position:0%
things one is when we are having
 
03:29:18.950 --> 03:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
software developed as we are for the
 
03:29:21.309 --> 03:29:21.319 align:start position:0%
voter registration database as we would
 
03:29:24.110 --> 03:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
for this voter portal um as we did for
 
03:29:26.229 --> 03:29:26.239 align:start position:0%
the campaign Finance
 
03:29:30.469 --> 03:29:30.479 align:start position:0%
system we are having the code uh heavily
 
03:29:34.590 --> 03:29:34.600 align:start position:0%
scrutinized and reviewed uh even when
 
03:29:36.670 --> 03:29:36.680 align:start position:0%
the vendors that are providing the
 
03:29:40.429 --> 03:29:40.439 align:start position:0%
software are using uh third-party boiler
 
03:29:43.309 --> 03:29:43.319 align:start position:0%
prate software like from Microsoft or
 
03:29:44.830 --> 03:29:44.840 align:start position:0%
something like that we're having them
 
03:29:48.790 --> 03:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
thoroughly go through it looking for
 
03:29:51.710 --> 03:29:51.720 align:start position:0%
um uh issues that we you know that that
 
03:29:53.510 --> 03:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
that might be there that nobody else is
 
03:29:56.110 --> 03:29:56.120 align:start position:0%
aware of and I can tell you that in the
 
03:30:00.830 --> 03:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
process of reviewing the um uh code that
 
03:30:03.110 --> 03:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
is going into the voter registration
 
03:30:06.630 --> 03:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
database uh there was
 
03:30:10.990 --> 03:30:11.000 align:start position:0%
some code that was found uh in a I call
 
03:30:13.070 --> 03:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
it a boilerplate
 
03:30:16.070 --> 03:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
software that had
 
03:30:20.510 --> 03:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
little code in there that uh uh when
 
03:30:23.870 --> 03:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
executed would play the Ukrainian Anthem
 
03:30:26.510 --> 03:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
and show a picture of the Ukrainian flag
 
03:30:28.150 --> 03:30:28.160 align:start position:0%
you know obviously that was you know
 
03:30:30.189 --> 03:30:30.199 align:start position:0%
that was removed from the software but
 
03:30:31.870 --> 03:30:31.880 align:start position:0%
we're making sure that the software is
 
03:30:34.150 --> 03:30:34.160 align:start position:0%
just clean right from the beginning and
 
03:30:36.269 --> 03:30:36.279 align:start position:0%
then we are hire excuse me
 
03:30:39.150 --> 03:30:39.160 align:start position:0%
hiring companies that can do penetration
 
03:30:41.870 --> 03:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
testing from time to time uh that are re
 
03:30:44.110 --> 03:30:44.120 align:start position:0%
reviewing the activity in and out who's
 
03:30:46.750 --> 03:30:46.760 align:start position:0%
trying to access uh these databases and
 
03:30:49.030 --> 03:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
things like that and I think at this
 
03:30:50.229 --> 03:30:50.239 align:start position:0%
point New Hampshire really is on the
 
03:30:52.790 --> 03:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
Forefront of what other states are doing
 
03:30:54.950 --> 03:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
in that
 
03:30:58.870 --> 03:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
regard the latest thing uh uh that is
 
03:31:01.510 --> 03:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
surfacing this year now is artificial
 
03:31:04.309 --> 03:31:04.319 align:start position:0%
intelligence um and that could be a real
 
03:31:05.990 --> 03:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
potential problem in fact I appeared
 
03:31:09.110 --> 03:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
before United States uh Senate uh
 
03:31:10.990 --> 03:31:11.000 align:start position:0%
committee yesterday this group is far
 
03:31:14.469 --> 03:31:14.479 align:start position:0%
more intimidating by the way
 
03:31:16.429 --> 03:31:16.439 align:start position:0%
so um
 
03:31:18.180 --> 03:31:18.190 align:start position:0%
but everybody
 
03:31:18.190 --> 03:31:19.870 align:start position:0%
but everybody
[Laughter]

03:31:19.870 --> 03:31:19.880 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
03:31:26.269 --> 03:31:26.279 align:start position:0%
smile um the ability now for anybody to
 
03:31:30.469 --> 03:31:30.479 align:start position:0%
access a program through an app that can
 
03:31:34.910 --> 03:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
take an image of anybody else and their
 
03:31:40.269 --> 03:31:40.279 align:start position:0%
voice recording and create uh video an
 
03:31:43.469 --> 03:31:43.479 align:start position:0%
audio of that person saying and doing
 
03:31:46.550 --> 03:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
things that simply never happened is
 
03:31:47.950 --> 03:31:47.960 align:start position:0%
incredible I mean it's
 
03:31:52.229 --> 03:31:52.239 align:start position:0%
frightening and so you know the the uh
 
03:31:54.950 --> 03:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
the trick there is being able to
 
03:31:58.750 --> 03:31:58.760 align:start position:0%
identify you know what is a deep
 
03:32:02.389 --> 03:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
fake and uh and making people aware of
 
03:32:04.630 --> 03:32:04.640 align:start position:0%
it and if it's malicious Prosecuting
 
03:32:06.389 --> 03:32:06.399 align:start position:0%
people that are you know that are
 
03:32:08.349 --> 03:32:08.359 align:start position:0%
engaged in being you know really
 
03:32:12.469 --> 03:32:12.479 align:start position:0%
deceptive uh in a disruptive way um so
 
03:32:14.110 --> 03:32:14.120 align:start position:0%
you know I think that's that's the
 
03:32:16.070 --> 03:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
biggest danger to our election process
 
03:32:18.349 --> 03:32:18.359 align:start position:0%
is just staying on top of uh the
 
03:32:20.670 --> 03:32:20.680 align:start position:0%
electronic systems that we do have and
 
03:32:23.910 --> 03:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
making sure that they're safe thank you
 
03:32:25.550 --> 03:32:25.560 align:start position:0%
all right I got two questions I want
 
03:32:27.750 --> 03:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
just a quick followup um he's I
 
03:32:29.510 --> 03:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate you bringing up the issue of
 
03:32:32.429 --> 03:32:32.439 align:start position:0%
deep fakes but is it is it relates to
 
03:32:34.910 --> 03:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
this particular system there's there's
 
03:32:37.110 --> 03:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
nothing in our system this system that
 
03:32:42.309 --> 03:32:42.319 align:start position:0%
relies on video or a virtual action it's
 
03:32:46.349 --> 03:32:46.359 align:start position:0%
all the validation is all human to Human
 
03:32:48.990 --> 03:32:49.000 align:start position:0%
um at at a designated location right
 
03:32:52.990 --> 03:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
that's correct so the Deep fake um the
 
03:32:56.550 --> 03:32:56.560 align:start position:0%
awareness is is not related to this uh
 
03:32:58.750 --> 03:32:58.760 align:start position:0%
system that's right all right thank you
 
03:33:00.189 --> 03:33:00.199 align:start position:0%
excellent answer we using up the
 
03:33:02.510 --> 03:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
allotted time still got two more people
 
03:33:04.670 --> 03:33:04.680 align:start position:0%
like to speak please limit the questions
 
03:33:07.309 --> 03:33:07.319 align:start position:0%
and the answers representative tersi
 
03:33:08.550 --> 03:33:08.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
03:33:10.030 --> 03:33:10.040 align:start position:0%
secretary scanland for taking my
 
03:33:13.550 --> 03:33:13.560 align:start position:0%
question um it's my understanding that
 
03:33:16.070 --> 03:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
the DMV and the voter fileer are already
 
03:33:17.790 --> 03:33:17.800 align:start position:0%
talking to each other and I know when I
 
03:33:20.550 --> 03:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
get a license I have to um bring forth
 
03:33:22.469 --> 03:33:22.479 align:start position:0%
proof of identity proof of age proof of
 
03:33:24.750 --> 03:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
residency which is three of the four
 
03:33:26.950 --> 03:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
items needed for voter registration it
 
03:33:29.229 --> 03:33:29.239 align:start position:0%
would seem to me that a portal could be
 
03:33:31.550 --> 03:33:31.560 align:start position:0%
very efficient in terms of instant
 
03:33:33.710 --> 03:33:33.720 align:start position:0%
verification um with those items that
 
03:33:36.030 --> 03:33:36.040 align:start position:0%
have already been verified by the DMV is
 
03:33:38.389 --> 03:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
that something that could be worked out
 
03:33:41.269 --> 03:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
so that um that process could be um
 
03:33:43.110 --> 03:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
integrated in a safe and protected
 
03:33:45.309 --> 03:33:45.319 align:start position:0%
manner for voter registration I
 
03:33:46.630 --> 03:33:46.640 align:start position:0%
certainly think think that's possible
 
03:33:48.910 --> 03:33:48.920 align:start position:0%
down the road and you know I I I
 
03:33:50.910 --> 03:33:50.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned about the Motor Voter law and
 
03:33:53.070 --> 03:33:53.080 align:start position:0%
the national voter registration act in
 
03:33:55.070 --> 03:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
the other states the the other states
 
03:33:57.510 --> 03:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
have that because of the federal
 
03:33:59.150 --> 03:33:59.160 align:start position:0%
requirement New Hampshire I didn't
 
03:34:01.070 --> 03:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
mention this is exempt from that
 
03:34:03.710 --> 03:34:03.720 align:start position:0%
law because at the time it was created
 
03:34:06.910 --> 03:34:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:06.920 --> 03:34:10.229 align:start position:0%
 
registration

03:34:10.229 --> 03:34:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:13.550 --> 03:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
um I think that the information that
 
03:34:16.870 --> 03:34:16.880 align:start position:0%
could be provided uh
 
03:34:19.389 --> 03:34:19.399 align:start position:0%
electronically uh through a voter
 
03:34:21.510 --> 03:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
portable portal could be
 
03:34:25.150 --> 03:34:25.160 align:start position:0%
verified uh certainly provided the voter
 
03:34:28.110 --> 03:34:28.120 align:start position:0%
was already in the system uh they may
 
03:34:30.189 --> 03:34:30.199 align:start position:0%
have been registered in another town
 
03:34:32.229 --> 03:34:32.239 align:start position:0%
Senator Grace said you know that data
 
03:34:35.870 --> 03:34:35.880 align:start position:0%
already exists in the database it can be
 
03:34:38.510 --> 03:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
prepared uh at this point the portal is
 
03:34:41.469 --> 03:34:41.479 align:start position:0%
not being built to match information
 
03:34:44.309 --> 03:34:44.319 align:start position:0%
with motor vehicles but uh if at some
 
03:34:46.590 --> 03:34:46.600 align:start position:0%
point in the future you know that was
 
03:34:48.630 --> 03:34:48.640 align:start position:0%
felt to be a good policy decision and we
 
03:34:50.750 --> 03:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
could uh we could do that very quick
 
03:34:52.750 --> 03:34:52.760 align:start position:0%
followup followup I guess I'm just
 
03:34:54.710 --> 03:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
trying to understand because the way um
 
03:34:57.269 --> 03:34:57.279 align:start position:0%
you were describing what you envision um
 
03:34:58.630 --> 03:34:58.640 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the voter putting
 
03:35:00.429 --> 03:35:00.439 align:start position:0%
their information in but then it sounded
 
03:35:02.229 --> 03:35:02.239 align:start position:0%
like it's almost like they're printing
 
03:35:04.349 --> 03:35:04.359 align:start position:0%
out a form with it pre-filled that you
 
03:35:06.229 --> 03:35:06.239 align:start position:0%
then hand to a clerk that they have to
 
03:35:07.950 --> 03:35:07.960 align:start position:0%
type it in that seems
 
03:35:10.670 --> 03:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
like you're not taking advantage of the
 
03:35:12.910 --> 03:35:12.920 align:start position:0%
electronic information as it comes in it
 
03:35:15.150 --> 03:35:15.160 align:start position:0%
seems like we're just so close but not
 
03:35:17.070 --> 03:35:17.080 align:start position:0%
quite getting there can you just expand
 
03:35:20.429 --> 03:35:20.439 align:start position:0%
on what you're seeing this is what the
 
03:35:22.429 --> 03:35:22.439 align:start position:0%
way I envisioned it is that the voter
 
03:35:24.309 --> 03:35:24.319 align:start position:0%
would provide the data
 
03:35:26.469 --> 03:35:26.479 align:start position:0%
electronically the clerk or the
 
03:35:28.389 --> 03:35:28.399 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist would print
 
03:35:29.990 --> 03:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
out the
 
03:35:33.229 --> 03:35:33.239 align:start position:0%
form that would have to be signed by the
 
03:35:36.070 --> 03:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
voter there would be no other reentering
 
03:35:38.229 --> 03:35:38.239 align:start position:0%
data it's just that there would be a wet
 
03:35:40.710 --> 03:35:40.720 align:start position:0%
signature of the voter that applied for
 
03:35:43.030 --> 03:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
that voter registration when they show
 
03:35:45.110 --> 03:35:45.120 align:start position:0%
up to either vote for the first time at
 
03:35:48.429 --> 03:35:48.439 align:start position:0%
the polling place or go to the clerk's
 
03:35:51.269 --> 03:35:51.279 align:start position:0%
office uh to show their documentation to
 
03:35:53.870 --> 03:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
back up their
 
03:35:55.950 --> 03:35:55.960 align:start position:0%
application thank you if there's no
 
03:35:59.550 --> 03:35:59.560 align:start position:0%
further questions please keep it
 
03:36:02.150 --> 03:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
short thank you Mr chair I will be as
 
03:36:06.630 --> 03:36:06.640 align:start position:0%
short as I can humanly be um two very
 
03:36:09.349 --> 03:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
quick questions one in terms of the open
 
03:36:11.790 --> 03:36:11.800 align:start position:0%
source versus the Dominion
 
03:36:14.790 --> 03:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
machines you talked about reviewing the
 
03:36:16.590 --> 03:36:16.600 align:start position:0%
code earlier do you have the same degree
 
03:36:18.469 --> 03:36:18.479 align:start position:0%
of confidence in your the ability of
 
03:36:20.349 --> 03:36:20.359 align:start position:0%
your tech people to review the code for
 
03:36:23.150 --> 03:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
those two different
 
03:36:26.469 --> 03:36:26.479 align:start position:0%
systems the the voting Works code
 
03:36:28.790 --> 03:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
because it's open source uh is
 
03:36:32.389 --> 03:36:32.399 align:start position:0%
reviewable by by anybody the Dominion
 
03:36:35.510 --> 03:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
however is uh is proprietary they use
 
03:36:35.520 --> 03:36:36.950 align:start position:0%
however is uh is proprietary they use
proprietary

03:36:36.950 --> 03:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
proprietary
 
03:36:39.950 --> 03:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
software the towns would be acquiring
 
03:36:39.960 --> 03:36:40.910 align:start position:0%
software the towns would be acquiring
their

03:36:40.910 --> 03:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
their
 
03:36:43.030 --> 03:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
product if the town decides that they
 
03:36:46.070 --> 03:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
want to use a machine
 
03:36:51.030 --> 03:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
the the review that takes place is not
 
03:36:53.630 --> 03:36:53.640 align:start position:0%
the vendors that I mentioned that that
 
03:36:56.070 --> 03:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
review the New Hampshire specific code
 
03:36:59.630 --> 03:36:59.640 align:start position:0%
when we're building it uh the review is
 
03:37:04.110 --> 03:37:04.120 align:start position:0%
done by a thirdparty nationally
 
03:37:07.790 --> 03:37:07.800 align:start position:0%
recognized uh Tech technological
 
03:37:10.229 --> 03:37:10.239 align:start position:0%
laboratory uh looking for the
 
03:37:12.590 --> 03:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
requirements that have been put in place
 
03:37:15.189 --> 03:37:15.199 align:start position:0%
by the federal election assistance
 
03:37:15.199 --> 03:37:17.229 align:start position:0%
by the federal election assistance
Commission

03:37:17.229 --> 03:37:17.239 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
03:37:20.349 --> 03:37:20.359 align:start position:0%
and those standards are uniform uh you
 
03:37:23.790 --> 03:37:23.800 align:start position:0%
know for those types of devices and uh
 
03:37:25.670 --> 03:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
we have to trust them that you know that
 
03:37:28.269 --> 03:37:28.279 align:start position:0%
they've done their job making sure that
 
03:37:31.070 --> 03:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
the code of those various vendors is
 
03:37:33.309 --> 03:37:33.319 align:start position:0%
clean thank you Mr secretary in the
 
03:37:34.910 --> 03:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
interest of time I'll skip the second
 
03:37:36.830 --> 03:37:36.840 align:start position:0%

03:37:43.510 --> 03:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
secretary next person we call on is Liz
 
03:37:53.070 --> 03:37:53.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:54.070 --> 03:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
welcome to
 
03:37:57.269 --> 03:37:57.279 align:start position:0%
finance thank you representative Wier uh
 
03:37:58.910 --> 03:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the committee my name is
 
03:38:01.469 --> 03:38:01.479 align:start position:0%
Liz tentarelli I'm president of the
 
03:38:04.189 --> 03:38:04.199 align:start position:0%
League of Women Voters of New Hampshire
 
03:38:07.150 --> 03:38:07.160 align:start position:0%
we're a nonpartisan organization and our
 
03:38:11.030 --> 03:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
mission is to empower voters and I can
 
03:38:14.150 --> 03:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
think of no better way to empower voters
 
03:38:17.630 --> 03:38:17.640 align:start position:0%
than to make the regist rtion process
 
03:38:19.950 --> 03:38:19.960 align:start position:0%
something that voters in the 21st
 
03:38:22.070 --> 03:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
century can actually
 
03:38:25.790 --> 03:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
recognize so instead of the trip to the
 
03:38:29.550 --> 03:38:29.560 align:start position:0%
town clerk's office uh you can start
 
03:38:32.830 --> 03:38:32.840 align:start position:0%
that process online if this bill passes
 
03:38:34.790 --> 03:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
and the portal bill
 
03:38:37.910 --> 03:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
passes um this is a funding
 
03:38:41.150 --> 03:38:41.160 align:start position:0%
mechanism it seems like a very logical
 
03:38:44.830 --> 03:38:44.840 align:start position:0%
use of State funds to encourage the Next
 
03:38:47.870 --> 03:38:47.880 align:start position:0%
Generation of Voters beyond that it
 
03:38:50.429 --> 03:38:50.439 align:start position:0%
Services the present generation of
 
03:38:53.870 --> 03:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
Voters that is anybody Among Us who
 
03:38:56.229 --> 03:38:56.239 align:start position:0%
moves from one town to another could
 
03:38:59.990 --> 03:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
change address online rather than to
 
03:39:03.429 --> 03:39:03.439 align:start position:0%
traes to another uh building in another
 
03:39:07.269 --> 03:39:07.279 align:start position:0%
town with documents and so on so I very
 
03:39:10.110 --> 03:39:10.120 align:start position:0%
much encourage this committee to support
 
03:39:12.790 --> 03:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
this bill I hope you notice the list of
 
03:39:15.670 --> 03:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
sponsors on the Senate bill it is a
 
03:39:19.670 --> 03:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
bipartisan list voting should not be a
 
03:39:23.469 --> 03:39:23.479 align:start position:0%
partisan issue we should all agree that
 
03:39:25.830 --> 03:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
eligible voters should be able to
 
03:39:29.670 --> 03:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
register to vote in the most logical and
 
03:39:32.830 --> 03:39:32.840 align:start position:0%
convenient way possible and I think this
 
03:39:36.229 --> 03:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
bill facilitates that so I urge my your
 
03:39:38.790 --> 03:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
support of this bill on behalf of my
 
03:39:40.910 --> 03:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
organization thank you thank you for
 
03:39:42.429 --> 03:39:42.439 align:start position:0%
your testimony questions from the
 
03:39:44.830 --> 03:39:44.840 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none well next call on
 
03:39:53.309 --> 03:39:53.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:57.110 --> 03:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
action welcome to finance thank
 
03:39:59.910 --> 03:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
you all right I'm gonna keep this short
 
03:40:01.229 --> 03:40:01.239 align:start position:0%
because I know we're
 
03:40:03.590 --> 03:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
over uh for the record my name is Autumn
 
03:40:05.870 --> 03:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
rashik Goodwin I am a Manchester voter
 
03:40:07.630 --> 03:40:07.640 align:start position:0%
and the program coordinator for open
 
03:40:12.110 --> 03:40:12.120 align:start position:0%
democracy action uh we are a nonprofit
 
03:40:14.389 --> 03:40:14.399 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan organization that focuses on
 
03:40:16.830 --> 03:40:16.840 align:start position:0%
advocating for campaign Finance reform
 
03:40:19.710 --> 03:40:19.720 align:start position:0%
and for voter rights really I just want
 
03:40:23.269 --> 03:40:23.279 align:start position:0%
to emphasize the importance of this bill
 
03:40:26.309 --> 03:40:26.319 align:start position:0%
for the convenience for people
 
03:40:28.349 --> 03:40:28.359 align:start position:0%
registering to vote a lot of people
 
03:40:30.070 --> 03:40:30.080 align:start position:0%
aren't available during the typical
 
03:40:33.630 --> 03:40:33.640 align:start position:0%
hours of the town clerk's offices so
 
03:40:36.469 --> 03:40:36.479 align:start position:0%
being able to do all of this populating
 
03:40:39.309 --> 03:40:39.319 align:start position:0%
of the forms ahead of time is just
 
03:40:40.870 --> 03:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
extremely convenient makes it so that
 
03:40:42.950 --> 03:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
they just have to pop in with documents
 
03:40:45.910 --> 03:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
sign off good to go
 
03:40:49.030 --> 03:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
additionally it will increase the
 
03:40:50.510 --> 03:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
accuracy which we've already talked
 
03:40:53.710 --> 03:40:53.720 align:start position:0%
about extensively today and it will save
 
03:40:56.389 --> 03:40:56.399 align:start position:0%
funds for the different towns because we
 
03:40:58.389 --> 03:40:58.399 align:start position:0%
don't have to spend as much time going
 
03:40:59.950 --> 03:40:59.960 align:start position:0%
back and forth trying to decipher what
 
03:41:01.750 --> 03:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
someone wrote on a paper
 
03:41:05.389 --> 03:41:05.399 align:start position:0%
form um I do also have the testimony of
 
03:41:07.630 --> 03:41:07.640 align:start position:0%

03:41:09.910 --> 03:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
which I'll hand out with mine as well

delandro to introduce Senate Bill
 
03:43:15.750 --> 03:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
604 this bill provides a death benefit
 
03:43:19.469 --> 03:43:19.479 align:start position:0%
to the family of a security officer who
 
03:43:22.670 --> 03:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
was killed in the line of duty last
 
03:43:26.070 --> 03:43:26.080 align:start position:0%
November at New New Hampshire
 
03:43:29.830 --> 03:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
hospital several years ago the state
 
03:43:34.790 --> 03:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
enacted a law to provide a
 
03:43:38.590 --> 03:43:38.600 align:start position:0%
$100,000 death benefit to the surviving
 
03:43:41.510 --> 03:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
family members of law enforcement
 
03:43:44.469 --> 03:43:44.479 align:start position:0%
officers and firefighters killed in the
 
03:43:48.990 --> 03:43:49.000 align:start position:0%
line of Duty the individual who was gone
 
03:43:53.670 --> 03:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
down in this terrible case was providing
 
03:43:57.189 --> 03:43:57.199 align:start position:0%
security for New Hampshire hospital and
 
03:44:00.830 --> 03:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
had been a sworn law enforcement officer
 
03:44:04.229 --> 03:44:04.239 align:start position:0%
for his entire adult life including
 
03:44:08.750 --> 03:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
serving as a police chief but he was not
 
03:44:12.590 --> 03:44:12.600 align:start position:0%
a sworn law enforcement officer at the
 
03:44:15.630 --> 03:44:15.640 align:start position:0%
time of his um
 
03:44:19.950 --> 03:44:19.960 align:start position:0%
line of duty death so his family was not
 
03:44:22.349 --> 03:44:22.359 align:start position:0%
eligible for the death
 
03:44:24.550 --> 03:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
benefit to be
 
03:44:28.710 --> 03:44:28.720 align:start position:0%
clear his family did not request this
 
03:44:31.110 --> 03:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
legislation the Senate felt it was
 
03:44:33.070 --> 03:44:33.080 align:start position:0%
simply the right thing to
 
03:44:36.429 --> 03:44:36.439 align:start position:0%
do um for someone who dedicated his life
 
03:44:39.590 --> 03:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
to law enforcement and protecting and
 
03:44:43.429 --> 03:44:43.439 align:start position:0%
serving his community and who continued
 
03:44:47.710 --> 03:44:47.720 align:start position:0%
to Serve and Protect after retirement in
 
03:44:50.510 --> 03:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
his security role at New Hampshire
 
03:44:54.429 --> 03:44:54.439 align:start position:0%
hospital he literally gave his life to
 
03:44:57.189 --> 03:44:57.199 align:start position:0%
protect the staff and the patients of
 
03:45:00.990 --> 03:45:01.000 align:start position:0%
the state hospital and the Senate felt
 
03:45:03.990 --> 03:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
that ex extending this benefit to his
 
03:45:07.110 --> 03:45:07.120 align:start position:0%
family was the proper thing to do and we
 
03:45:11.030 --> 03:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
hope the house will agree thank you
 
03:45:13.550 --> 03:45:13.560 align:start position:0%

03:45:20.229 --> 03:45:20.239 align:start position:0%
conversation in the senate about
 
03:45:24.309 --> 03:45:24.319 align:start position:0%
extending this benefit to any in the
 
03:45:26.469 --> 03:45:26.479 align:start position:0%
unfortunate case the situation happens
 
03:45:29.590 --> 03:45:29.600 align:start position:0%
again uh to other security officers in
 
03:45:32.590 --> 03:45:32.600 align:start position:0%
the future or is it just retroactive to
 
03:45:33.990 --> 03:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
officer H's
 
03:45:37.030 --> 03:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
family there was a lot of discussion
 
03:45:40.590 --> 03:45:40.600 align:start position:0%
about that I was not privy to any of it
 
03:45:43.870 --> 03:45:43.880 align:start position:0%
but I know there was a lot this
 
03:45:45.750 --> 03:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
particular bill
 
03:45:48.710 --> 03:45:48.720 align:start position:0%
has the support of all of the
 
03:45:48.720 --> 03:45:50.149 align:start position:0%

stakeholder

03:45:50.149 --> 03:45:50.159 align:start position:0%
stakeholder
 
03:45:54.469 --> 03:45:54.479 align:start position:0%
organizations it was a simple thing to
 
03:45:57.670 --> 03:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
do what you're suggesting would be
 
03:46:00.550 --> 03:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
probably um something that would need
 
03:46:02.070 --> 03:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
work and
 
03:46:05.590 --> 03:46:05.600 align:start position:0%
conversation this was a late filed
 
03:46:07.870 --> 03:46:07.880 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you I appreciate that thank
 
03:46:07.880 --> 03:46:16.670 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you I appreciate that thank
you

03:46:16.670 --> 03:46:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:16.680 --> 03:46:18.710 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:46:18.710 --> 03:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:46:21.630 --> 03:46:21.640 align:start position:0%
yes questions from the committee members
 
03:46:23.990 --> 03:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
Edward thank you Mr chair and to follow
 
03:46:26.950 --> 03:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
up on that very thing I I was thinking
 
03:46:28.910 --> 03:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
pretty much the same thing if there if
 
03:46:31.429 --> 03:46:31.439 align:start position:0%
there is any language that was floated
 
03:46:34.469 --> 03:46:34.479 align:start position:0%
around on an amendment to this so that
 
03:46:37.189 --> 03:46:37.199 align:start position:0%
we're making a categorical distinction
 
03:46:39.469 --> 03:46:39.479 align:start position:0%
in the law as opposed to a oneoff
 
03:46:41.670 --> 03:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
individual I I would be much more
 
03:46:44.910 --> 03:46:44.920 align:start position:0%
comfortable about that being just good
 
03:46:47.110 --> 03:46:47.120 align:start position:0%
legislative work to to not be
 
03:46:50.510 --> 03:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
pinpointing individual benefits but to
 
03:46:54.750 --> 03:46:54.760 align:start position:0%
to determine as policy what categories
 
03:46:57.550 --> 03:46:57.560 align:start position:0%
we want to have covered by this benefit
 
03:46:59.790 --> 03:46:59.800 align:start position:0%
do do are you aware of any language
 
03:47:02.429 --> 03:47:02.439 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm not aware that there was
 
03:47:05.070 --> 03:47:05.080 align:start position:0%
language floated this bill was not
 
03:47:08.389 --> 03:47:08.399 align:start position:0%
amended in the Senate I just know there
 
03:47:12.189 --> 03:47:12.199 align:start position:0%
were discussions about whether it should
 
03:47:16.830 --> 03:47:16.840 align:start position:0%
be really narrow or whether it should be
 
03:47:20.389 --> 03:47:20.399 align:start position:0%
more extensive and I think the decision
 
03:47:23.510 --> 03:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
was that would be a longer
 
03:47:25.870 --> 03:47:25.880 align:start position:0%
conversation perhaps for the next
 
03:47:28.870 --> 03:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
legislative session as I said to rep
 
03:47:32.990 --> 03:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
weeny this was a late filed Bill
 
03:47:37.110 --> 03:47:37.120 align:start position:0%
and uh there was simply not a huge
 
03:47:41.790 --> 03:47:41.800 align:start position:0%
amount of time to get it to get that
 
03:47:45.389 --> 03:47:45.399 align:start position:0%
extension right and have the support
 
03:47:49.710 --> 03:47:49.720 align:start position:0%
of the state troopers the police the
 
03:47:52.429 --> 03:47:52.439 align:start position:0%
firefighters um this bill does have
 
03:47:54.630 --> 03:47:54.640 align:start position:0%
broad support thank you Senator
 
03:47:56.710 --> 03:47:56.720 align:start position:0%
appreciate the answer thank you Mr
 
03:47:59.149 --> 03:47:59.159 align:start position:0%
chair any other questions from committee
 
03:48:07.469 --> 03:48:07.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:11.990 --> 03:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
Senator Senator 6 Senate Bill
 
03:48:26.950 --> 03:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:28.389 --> 03:48:28.399 align:start position:0%
thank you members of finance
 
03:48:30.870 --> 03:48:30.880 align:start position:0%
representative hle serving the towns of
 
03:48:32.990 --> 03:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
dun Martin hooks at Allenstown and fum
 
03:48:36.070 --> 03:48:36.080 align:start position:0%
here um in favor of this even as a
 
03:48:40.030 --> 03:48:40.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal conservative um part of what went
 
03:48:44.070 --> 03:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
on I think we also need to understand um
 
03:48:45.910 --> 03:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
from the news reports CU I have not seen
 
03:48:47.990 --> 03:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
firsthand information relative to
 
03:48:50.189 --> 03:48:50.199 align:start position:0%
official sources but from what I've read
 
03:48:53.110 --> 03:48:53.120 align:start position:0%
in the news the person serving the job
 
03:48:57.469 --> 03:48:57.479 align:start position:0%
of security that night officer hos um
 
03:49:00.910 --> 03:49:00.920 align:start position:0%
was in fact at the metal detector being
 
03:49:03.389 --> 03:49:03.399 align:start position:0%
the security agent it it's my
 
03:49:05.189 --> 03:49:05.199 align:start position:0%
understanding also that he was unarmed
 
03:49:07.670 --> 03:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
at the time and that that was done by
 
03:49:12.030 --> 03:49:12.040 align:start position:0%
Department policy or rule or contract or
 
03:49:15.229 --> 03:49:15.239 align:start position:0%
something I believe
 
03:49:17.269 --> 03:49:17.279 align:start position:0%
um the questions to the earlier speaker
 
03:49:19.349 --> 03:49:19.359 align:start position:0%
about a broad benefit are definitely
 
03:49:21.269 --> 03:49:21.279 align:start position:0%
worth discussing but if
 
03:49:23.510 --> 03:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
we via our
 
03:49:26.149 --> 03:49:26.159 align:start position:0%
policies disarm the security guard I
 
03:49:28.710 --> 03:49:28.720 align:start position:0%
believe we owe that family this I think
 
03:49:31.030 --> 03:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
there is right we own we own some
 
03:49:32.750 --> 03:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility in that action I
 
03:49:34.389 --> 03:49:34.399 align:start position:0%
testified to that on the floor when we
 
03:49:36.429 --> 03:49:36.439 align:start position:0%
were talking about House Bill 1711 which
 
03:49:39.429 --> 03:49:39.439 align:start position:0%
was also tied to officer
 
03:49:41.710 --> 03:49:41.720 align:start position:0%
hos I think there is some level of
 
03:49:44.750 --> 03:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
culpability for us as a state if we are
 
03:49:46.990 --> 03:49:47.000 align:start position:0%
asking people to be security guards at
 
03:49:49.790 --> 03:49:49.800 align:start position:0%
metal detectors at institutions where
 
03:49:51.510 --> 03:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
there might be
 
03:49:53.590 --> 03:49:53.600 align:start position:0%
problems and then we tell them they
 
03:49:57.110 --> 03:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
can't have their own personal carry
 
03:49:59.590 --> 03:49:59.600 align:start position:0%
device um he may or may not have been
 
03:50:02.830 --> 03:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
wearing um a bulletproof vest we don't
 
03:50:04.349 --> 03:50:04.359 align:start position:0%
have those details I think it's
 
03:50:06.070 --> 03:50:06.080 align:start position:0%
worthwhile for us to figure out what
 
03:50:08.070 --> 03:50:08.080 align:start position:0%
happened there as part of this in
 
03:50:10.590 --> 03:50:10.600 align:start position:0%
addition to Simply making sure that the
 
03:50:13.630 --> 03:50:13.640 align:start position:0%
family um is compensated for the loss of
 
03:50:16.070 --> 03:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
someone they care for and quite frankly
 
03:50:18.870 --> 03:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
$100,000 for someone who is murdered on
 
03:50:20.950 --> 03:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
the job seems inadequate in my opinion
 
03:50:23.710 --> 03:50:23.720 align:start position:0%
with that I'll close my
 
03:50:26.030 --> 03:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you any questions from
 
03:50:27.149 --> 03:50:27.159 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
03:50:29.229 --> 03:50:29.239 align:start position:0%
members seeing
 
03:50:29.239 --> 03:50:31.550 align:start position:0%
members seeing

03:50:56.469 --> 03:50:56.479 align:start position:0%
favor there's no further action on that
 
03:50:59.149 --> 03:50:59.159 align:start position:0%
bill representative
 
03:51:02.309 --> 03:51:02.319 align:start position:0%
lean thank you Mr chairman um I don't
 
03:51:04.429 --> 03:51:04.439 align:start position:0%
see any need of this going on to the
 
03:51:09.030 --> 03:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
division on May 7th so I'd like the move
 
03:51:11.309 --> 03:51:11.319 align:start position:0%
passage is there a
 
03:51:11.319 --> 03:51:12.830 align:start position:0%
passage is there a
second

03:51:12.830 --> 03:51:12.840 align:start position:0%
second
 
03:51:16.429 --> 03:51:16.439 align:start position:0%
oh there any objection to to executing
 
03:51:18.910 --> 03:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:51:22.349 --> 03:51:22.359 align:start position:0%
today represented my my objection would
 
03:51:26.990 --> 03:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
would just be around process I I I'm I'm
 
03:51:30.110 --> 03:51:30.120 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable obviously the state owes
 
03:51:32.070 --> 03:51:32.080 align:start position:0%
it to the family to help in this
 
03:51:34.110 --> 03:51:34.120 align:start position:0%
instance I have no issue with that my
 
03:51:36.990 --> 03:51:37.000 align:start position:0%
issue is establishing a precedent where
 
03:51:41.429 --> 03:51:41.439 align:start position:0%
we're in law identifying a an individual
 
03:51:44.670 --> 03:51:44.680 align:start position:0%
for a particular benefit and I if we did
 
03:51:47.269 --> 03:51:47.279 align:start position:0%
a work session on this I I would love to
 
03:51:49.750 --> 03:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
work with somebody on an amendment that
 
03:51:53.149 --> 03:51:53.159 align:start position:0%
would make this a categorical benefit
 
03:51:55.630 --> 03:51:55.640 align:start position:0%
and make it retroactive so that this
 
03:51:57.950 --> 03:51:57.960 align:start position:0%
individual family can benefit from it
 
03:52:00.349 --> 03:52:00.359 align:start position:0%
but we're not kind of you know choosing
 
03:52:03.510 --> 03:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
winners and losers on a legislative
 
03:52:06.830 --> 03:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
basis so so that would be my objection
 
03:52:08.110 --> 03:52:08.120 align:start position:0%
represent whole did you have an
 
03:52:10.750 --> 03:52:10.760 align:start position:0%
amendment you wanted to present I do not
 
03:52:12.910 --> 03:52:12.920 align:start position:0%
and for that reason I think it makes
 
03:52:15.229 --> 03:52:15.239 align:start position:0%
sense to not EXA this today day but have
 
03:52:17.710 --> 03:52:17.720 align:start position:0%
enough time to have an amendment drafted
 
03:52:19.590 --> 03:52:19.600 align:start position:0%
I will get that done prior to an exec
 
03:52:22.469 --> 03:52:22.479 align:start position:0%
session all right seeing the objection
 
03:52:26.189 --> 03:52:26.199 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll wait to have further so that
 
03:52:29.110 --> 03:52:29.120 align:start position:0%
this can be thoroughly worked on and
 
03:52:30.870 --> 03:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
obviously there's members that want to
 
03:52:34.229 --> 03:52:34.239 align:start position:0%
uh bring in amendments and ensure that
 
03:52:37.990 --> 03:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
this carries forward so that this
 
03:52:42.349 --> 03:52:42.359 align:start position:0%
example can be repeated if needed so I
 
03:52:44.550 --> 03:52:44.560 align:start position:0%
just say
 
03:52:46.950 --> 03:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
so so thank you Mr chair I just as a
 
03:52:48.950 --> 03:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
point of personal privilege on this I I
 
03:52:51.110 --> 03:52:51.120 align:start position:0%
just anyone who has heard my words I
 
03:52:54.349 --> 03:52:54.359 align:start position:0%
want you to know I I care deeply about
 
03:52:57.229 --> 03:52:57.239 align:start position:0%
making the family whole and and having
 
03:52:59.710 --> 03:52:59.720 align:start position:0%
the legislature step into this I just
 
03:53:02.030 --> 03:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
want to do it in a way in which it's
 
03:53:05.790 --> 03:53:05.800 align:start position:0%
predictable for any future scenarios and
 
03:53:07.590 --> 03:53:07.600 align:start position:0%
and I I I I think we're going to get
 
03:53:09.670 --> 03:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
there I just don't I I just don't want
 
03:53:13.229 --> 03:53:13.239 align:start position:0%
to get there directly so so thank you Mr
 
03:53:16.149 --> 03:53:16.159 align:start position:0%
chair okay any further discussion on
 
03:53:20.830 --> 03:53:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:24.349 --> 03:53:24.359 align:start position:0%
604 all right seeing none the next bill
 
03:53:27.710 --> 03:53:27.720 align:start position:0%
on the schedule at 2 o'clock is Senate
 
03:53:27.720 --> 03:53:29.630 align:start position:0%
on the schedule at 2 o'clock is Senate
Bill

03:53:29.630 --> 03:53:29.640 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
03:53:32.110 --> 03:53:32.120 align:start position:0%
553 we've only allotted a half an hour
 
03:53:33.630 --> 03:53:33.640 align:start position:0%
for that and I can see we're going to
 
03:53:36.950 --> 03:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
exceed that but I'd like to say to those
 
03:53:39.189 --> 03:53:39.199 align:start position:0%
of you that have signed up for
 
03:53:42.510 --> 03:53:42.520 align:start position:0%
it since there is a large number of
 
03:53:44.910 --> 03:53:44.920 align:start position:0%
people that all want to say something
 
03:53:47.070 --> 03:53:47.080 align:start position:0%
about this if you have nothing new to
 
03:53:50.469 --> 03:53:50.479 align:start position:0%
add and a other person has said the same
 
03:53:53.110 --> 03:53:53.120 align:start position:0%
comments that you would like to
 
03:53:55.950 --> 03:53:55.960 align:start position:0%
reproduce if you could just get up and
 
03:54:00.189 --> 03:54:00.199 align:start position:0%
say I I am in favor and I support the
 
03:54:01.870 --> 03:54:01.880 align:start position:0%
the uh comments that have been further
 
03:54:03.910 --> 03:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
made that will help us get through that
 
03:54:05.389 --> 03:54:05.399 align:start position:0%
in a more timely way if there's
 
03:54:08.630 --> 03:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
something really new then say I not only
 
03:54:11.030 --> 03:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
agree with the further with the former
 
03:54:14.189 --> 03:54:14.199 align:start position:0%
comments but I'd like to add this so
 
03:54:15.830 --> 03:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
that's what we're going to have to do
 
03:54:19.550 --> 03:54:19.560 align:start position:0%
when we start at at 2:00 and uh I'll
 
03:54:21.189 --> 03:54:21.199 align:start position:0%
probably have these sponsors Senator
 
03:54:23.910 --> 03:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
rosenal is here have her introduce the
 
03:54:27.229 --> 03:54:27.239 align:start position:0%
bill I think she's still yeah there she
 
03:54:30.710 --> 03:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
so we'll take a uh a brief intermission
 
03:54:32.630 --> 03:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
here because we cannot start before the
 
03:54:36.510 --> 03:54:36.520 align:start position:0%
schedule time so we start at 2
 
03:54:36.520 --> 03:54:39.110 align:start position:0%
schedule time so we start at 2
o'clock

03:54:39.110 --> 03:54:39.120 align:start position:0%
o'clock
 
03:54:42.830 --> 03:54:42.840 align:start position:0%

hearing of Senate Bill 553 and call upon
 
04:01:20.830 --> 04:01:20.840 align:start position:0%
the sponsor Senator rosenwall welcome to
 
04:01:22.790 --> 04:01:22.800 align:start position:0%
finance committee thank you I'm pleased
 
04:01:25.870 --> 04:01:25.880 align:start position:0%
to be back here for the record I'm
 
04:01:29.670 --> 04:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
Senator Cindy rosenal from District 13
 
04:01:32.670 --> 04:01:32.680 align:start position:0%
in nashwa and I'm pleased to be here to
 
04:01:35.070 --> 04:01:35.080 align:start position:0%
introduce Senate Bill
 
04:01:39.309 --> 04:01:39.319 align:start position:0%
553 following its 24 to zero ought to
 
04:01:43.510 --> 04:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
pass vote out of the Senate this bill is
 
04:01:47.149 --> 04:01:47.159 align:start position:0%
both an economic stimulus Bill and a
 
04:01:50.790 --> 04:01:50.800 align:start position:0%
property tax relief bill that is because
 
04:01:54.349 --> 04:01:54.359 align:start position:0%
it will lead to job growth economic
 
04:01:57.349 --> 04:01:57.359 align:start position:0%
expansion more small small business
 
04:02:00.790 --> 04:02:00.800 align:start position:0%
lending and increased local and state
 
04:02:00.800 --> 04:02:02.950 align:start position:0%
lending and increased local and state
revenues

04:02:02.950 --> 04:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
04:02:05.990 --> 04:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
significantly so the public deposit
 
04:02:10.030 --> 04:02:10.040 align:start position:0%
investment pool affectionately known as
 
04:02:14.349 --> 04:02:14.359 align:start position:0%
P dip was created by Statute
 
04:02:14.359 --> 04:02:15.950 align:start position:0%
P dip was created by Statute
in

04:02:15.950 --> 04:02:15.960 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:02:20.990 --> 04:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
1993 as a way for cities and towns to
 
04:02:24.269 --> 04:02:24.279 align:start position:0%
collectively invest their cash
 
04:02:28.830 --> 04:02:28.840 align:start position:0%
reserves and this pool was pretty small
 
04:02:31.870 --> 04:02:31.880 align:start position:0%
until a couple of years ago it was worth
 
04:02:34.349 --> 04:02:34.359 align:start position:0%
around $200
 
04:02:37.910 --> 04:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
million but it now totals over
 
04:02:37.920 --> 04:02:40.229 align:start position:0%
million but it now totals over
$650

04:02:40.229 --> 04:02:40.239 align:start position:0%
$650
 
04:02:43.910 --> 04:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
million These funds which are mostly tax
 
04:02:48.110 --> 04:02:48.120 align:start position:0%
pay funds none of them are currently
 
04:02:51.750 --> 04:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
invested in New Hampshire and some of
 
04:02:55.229 --> 04:02:55.239 align:start position:0%
them are held
 
04:02:59.269 --> 04:02:59.279 align:start position:0%
overseas by Statute the state treasurer
 
04:02:59.279 --> 04:03:00.269 align:start position:0%
overseas by Statute the state treasurer
is

04:03:00.269 --> 04:03:00.279 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:03:06.309 --> 04:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
responsible and has to hire a managing
 
04:03:10.269 --> 04:03:10.279 align:start position:0%
Organization for this for the
 
04:03:14.309 --> 04:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
p and the state treasurer also sets the
 
04:03:18.950 --> 04:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
investment standards for PF so how much
 
04:03:22.790 --> 04:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
in treasury notes how much in
 
04:03:28.070 --> 04:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
CDs that that sort of thing and that has
 
04:03:31.750 --> 04:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
um been the case since Creation with the
 
04:03:34.910 --> 04:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
exception of a couple of years ago we
 
04:03:39.149 --> 04:03:39.159 align:start position:0%
moved oversight of the fund itself from
 
04:03:43.830 --> 04:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
the banking commission to the treasurer
 
04:03:47.870 --> 04:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
this bill does not change these
 
04:03:50.830 --> 04:03:50.840 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of the
 
04:03:54.189 --> 04:03:54.199 align:start position:0%
treasurer she will still have to hire a
 
04:03:57.349 --> 04:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
management company she will still set
 
04:04:01.950 --> 04:04:01.960 align:start position:0%
the investment standards for the pool no
 
04:04:05.469 --> 04:04:05.479 align:start position:0%
city or town is required to join the
 
04:04:10.269 --> 04:04:10.279 align:start position:0%
pool and some of them don't what this
 
04:04:13.750 --> 04:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
bill does require is that these funds
 
04:04:17.710 --> 04:04:17.720 align:start position:0%
funds be invested in financial
 
04:04:21.229 --> 04:04:21.239 align:start position:0%
institutions with a presence in New
 
04:04:25.550 --> 04:04:25.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and it also requires that all
 
04:04:28.870 --> 04:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
funds be secured or
 
04:04:32.429 --> 04:04:32.439 align:start position:0%
collateralized this is I think important
 
04:04:36.469 --> 04:04:36.479 align:start position:0%
because the top priority of the pp is
 
04:04:38.910 --> 04:04:38.920 align:start position:0%
the safety of these
 
04:04:41.910 --> 04:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
funds however up until now there has
 
04:04:44.309 --> 04:04:44.319 align:start position:0%
never been insurance
 
04:04:44.319 --> 04:04:45.229 align:start position:0%
never been insurance
or

04:04:45.229 --> 04:04:45.239 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:04:48.149 --> 04:04:48.159 align:start position:0%
collateralization of the
 
04:04:52.510 --> 04:04:52.520 align:start position:0%
Investments and in fact last fall S&amp;P
 
04:04:56.710 --> 04:04:56.720 align:start position:0%
Global issued an analysis of of New
 
04:05:00.349 --> 04:05:00.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's PP and mentioned that with
 
04:05:04.750 --> 04:05:04.760 align:start position:0%
the daily liquidity set by the manager
 
04:05:08.269 --> 04:05:08.279 align:start position:0%
at 10% of the total if there were a
 
04:05:12.710 --> 04:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
large Redemption by a single investing
 
04:05:14.990 --> 04:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
city or town or the
 
04:05:19.030 --> 04:05:19.040 align:start position:0%
state um redemptions by other cities and
 
04:05:22.630 --> 04:05:22.640 align:start position:0%
towns might be paused for up to five
 
04:05:26.710 --> 04:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
days and could be redeemed in kind
 
04:05:28.830 --> 04:05:28.840 align:start position:0%
instead of in
 
04:05:31.670 --> 04:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
cash I think you'll probably hear that
 
04:05:33.910 --> 04:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
this bill will kill the
 
04:05:37.830 --> 04:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
pp I don't believe this is true and I
 
04:05:40.510 --> 04:05:40.520 align:start position:0%
think it's based on a misunderstanding
 
04:05:44.229 --> 04:05:44.239 align:start position:0%
of how it would work the treasurer as I
 
04:05:46.389 --> 04:05:46.399 align:start position:0%
said will still have to hire a
 
04:05:49.710 --> 04:05:49.720 align:start position:0%
management company just like she has to
 
04:05:54.750 --> 04:05:54.760 align:start position:0%
do now and that company will negotiate
 
04:05:59.790 --> 04:05:59.800 align:start position:0%
relationships and rates with some number
 
04:06:04.830 --> 04:06:04.840 align:start position:0%
of banks that have a presence in New
 
04:06:07.590 --> 04:06:07.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I think it clearly would not
 
04:06:12.590 --> 04:06:12.600 align:start position:0%
be every bank but it would be some in
 
04:06:16.510 --> 04:06:16.520 align:start position:0%
order to get the high yield that is
 
04:06:19.750 --> 04:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
possible with a significant
 
04:06:25.349 --> 04:06:25.359 align:start position:0%
investment and this would be and um a
 
04:06:25.359 --> 04:06:27.830 align:start position:0%
investment and this would be and um a
strong

04:06:27.830 --> 04:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:30.590 --> 04:06:30.600 align:start position:0%
relationship it won't be every city in
 
04:06:33.309 --> 04:06:33.319 align:start position:0%
town is what I'm trying to say going out
 
04:06:36.189 --> 04:06:36.199 align:start position:0%
on their own and talking to their local
 
04:06:40.110 --> 04:06:40.120 align:start position:0%
bank the management company will do this
 
04:06:43.990 --> 04:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
and at least two local I'm sorry not
 
04:06:47.110 --> 04:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
local at least two management companies
 
04:06:51.870 --> 04:06:51.880 align:start position:0%
have already indicated interest in
 
04:06:55.990 --> 04:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
seeking this business now I said at the
 
04:06:59.710 --> 04:06:59.720 align:start position:0%
outset that Senate Bill 553 is both an
 
04:07:03.070 --> 04:07:03.080 align:start position:0%
economic stimulus and a property tax
 
04:07:07.030 --> 04:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
relief bill I say that because we know
 
04:07:10.630 --> 04:07:10.640 align:start position:0%
from a study conducted last Fall by New
 
04:07:13.550 --> 04:07:13.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Economist Brian gotab was here
 
04:07:16.670 --> 04:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
here today what the impact of bringing
 
04:07:20.950 --> 04:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
this over $600 million back to New
 
04:07:24.630 --> 04:07:24.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and investing it with our
 
04:07:29.670 --> 04:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
financial institutions would be Mr golob
 
04:07:33.950 --> 04:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
was able to evaluate the effect just on
 
04:07:36.950 --> 04:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
the commercial banking side which is
 
04:07:36.960 --> 04:07:38.269 align:start position:0%
the commercial banking side which is
only

04:07:38.269 --> 04:07:38.279 align:start position:0%
only
 
04:07:42.710 --> 04:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
onethird of the total banking sector so
 
04:07:46.590 --> 04:07:46.600 align:start position:0%
therefore his projections and models are
 
04:07:46.600 --> 04:07:47.590 align:start position:0%
therefore his projections and models are
very

04:07:47.590 --> 04:07:47.600 align:start position:0%
very
 
04:07:50.790 --> 04:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
conservative but what they tell us is
 
04:07:53.429 --> 04:07:53.439 align:start position:0%
that more than $200
 
04:07:57.189 --> 04:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
million would be available for business
 
04:08:00.070 --> 04:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
lending that would be particularly
 
04:08:02.030 --> 04:08:02.040 align:start position:0%
helpful for small
 
04:08:05.229 --> 04:08:05.239 align:start position:0%
businesses his study tells us that over
 
04:08:09.710 --> 04:08:09.720 align:start position:0%
2500 jobs would be created and household
 
04:08:13.189 --> 04:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
income would grow along with the state's
 
04:08:14.910 --> 04:08:14.920 align:start position:0%
Dem domestic
 
04:08:18.670 --> 04:08:18.680 align:start position:0%
product in addition we know and I think
 
04:08:21.309 --> 04:08:21.319 align:start position:0%
you'll hear it that negotiated
 
04:08:24.550 --> 04:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
relationships with banks are providing
 
04:08:29.469 --> 04:08:29.479 align:start position:0%
nearly the same rate as the pp currently
 
04:08:32.950 --> 04:08:32.960 align:start position:0%
generates and in fact we see this in
 
04:08:38.429 --> 04:08:38.439 align:start position:0%
Maine which doesn't even have a PP and
 
04:08:43.149 --> 04:08:43.159 align:start position:0%
negotiates almost the same rate so all
 
04:08:46.429 --> 04:08:46.439 align:start position:0%
of this economic activity would
 
04:08:50.429 --> 04:08:50.439 align:start position:0%
translate to Municipal Revenue growth of
 
04:08:55.229 --> 04:08:55.239 align:start position:0%
67 million do over five years or at
 
04:08:58.750 --> 04:08:58.760 align:start position:0%
least double the return our cities and
 
04:09:01.950 --> 04:09:01.960 align:start position:0%
towns are getting now on the yield rate
 
04:09:05.109 --> 04:09:05.119 align:start position:0%
from the current investment strategy
 
04:09:08.710 --> 04:09:08.720 align:start position:0%
State revenues would grow by almost the
 
04:09:11.910 --> 04:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
same amount when all of the revenues
 
04:09:15.189 --> 04:09:15.199 align:start position:0%
from our various tax sources are
 
04:09:18.269 --> 04:09:18.279 align:start position:0%
considered and when the consumer Landing
 
04:09:22.189 --> 04:09:22.199 align:start position:0%
side 2third of the banking sector is
 
04:09:25.189 --> 04:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
added the revenue impact would be even
 
04:09:28.030 --> 04:09:28.040 align:start position:0%
greater and these Revenue impacts would
 
04:09:29.309 --> 04:09:29.319 align:start position:0%
continue to
 
04:09:33.070 --> 04:09:33.080 align:start position:0%
multiply over time as businesses and
 
04:09:38.109 --> 04:09:38.119 align:start position:0%
jobs grow and household wealth
 
04:09:42.269 --> 04:09:42.279 align:start position:0%
accumulates I um I'm not an economist
 
04:09:45.429 --> 04:09:45.439 align:start position:0%
I'm not a scientist I'm not an engineer
 
04:09:47.830 --> 04:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
but I like to think in
 
04:09:50.870 --> 04:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
metaphor and some of you know I'm
 
04:09:52.229 --> 04:09:52.239 align:start position:0%
married to a
 
04:09:57.630 --> 04:09:57.640 align:start position:0%
Cardiologist so I imagine the P dip as a
 
04:09:57.640 --> 04:09:59.189 align:start position:0%
Cardiologist so I imagine the P dip as a
circulatory

04:09:59.189 --> 04:09:59.199 align:start position:0%
circulatory
 
04:10:03.630 --> 04:10:03.640 align:start position:0%
system if we look only at the yield
 
04:10:07.030 --> 04:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
which is what we currently do we are
 
04:10:12.229 --> 04:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
only seeing the aorta of the heart
 
04:10:14.109 --> 04:10:14.119 align:start position:0%
receiving blood
 
04:10:17.269 --> 04:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
that's just pumped out of the heart but
 
04:10:20.429 --> 04:10:20.439 align:start position:0%
if we invest this money in New Hampshire
 
04:10:23.349 --> 04:10:23.359 align:start position:0%
we will see the entire circulatory
 
04:10:27.750 --> 04:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
system with oxygen rich blood flowing
 
04:10:30.550 --> 04:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
throughout the body of New Hampshire's
 
04:10:33.429 --> 04:10:33.439 align:start position:0%
economy down even to its fingers and
 
04:10:36.790 --> 04:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
toes and that's what this bill I believe
 
04:10:41.590 --> 04:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
will do it will put our money to work in
 
04:10:45.990 --> 04:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
our communities and P pump more money
 
04:10:49.469 --> 04:10:49.479 align:start position:0%
throughout New Hampshire while also
 
04:10:52.750 --> 04:10:52.760 align:start position:0%
serving as a way to provide tap property
 
04:10:57.269 --> 04:10:57.279 align:start position:0%
tax relief and do so in a way that is
 
04:11:00.950 --> 04:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
safe and liquid I'm happy to answer
 
04:11:03.670 --> 04:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr chairman
 
04:11:06.269 --> 04:11:06.279 align:start position:0%
representative Petri for a question
 
04:11:07.910 --> 04:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank and welcome
 
04:11:10.830 --> 04:11:10.840 align:start position:0%
back to uh fin thank you I'm happy to be
 
04:11:13.030 --> 04:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
here right who is the current manager of
 
04:11:13.040 --> 04:11:13.750 align:start position:0%
here right who is the current manager of
the

04:11:13.750 --> 04:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:11:18.309 --> 04:11:18.319 align:start position:0%
pool now it's a company called pfm and I
 
04:11:21.750 --> 04:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
believe they're here today thank
 
04:11:24.030 --> 04:11:24.040 align:start position:0%
you okay further questions from the
 
04:11:25.870 --> 04:11:25.880 align:start position:0%
committee representative Heath thank you
 
04:11:28.070 --> 04:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you senator for taking my
 
04:11:31.109 --> 04:11:31.119 align:start position:0%
question um just um I didn't see it
 
04:11:34.349 --> 04:11:34.359 align:start position:0%
anywhere in the bill when if the state
 
04:11:37.109 --> 04:11:37.119 align:start position:0%
takes over kind of coordination of all
 
04:11:39.870 --> 04:11:39.880 align:start position:0%
of this out of the treasurer's office
 
04:11:42.830 --> 04:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
will at any point in time the state have
 
04:11:45.590 --> 04:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
access to any of the interest dollars at
 
04:11:50.349 --> 04:11:50.359 align:start position:0%
all so the state already is responsible
 
04:11:55.269 --> 04:11:55.279 align:start position:0%
for managing this the state is allowed
 
04:11:59.389 --> 04:11:59.399 align:start position:0%
by Statute to put some money into the BP
 
04:12:01.790 --> 04:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
I believe we have
 
04:12:05.149 --> 04:12:05.159 align:start position:0%
some um and so that will
 
04:12:09.590 --> 04:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
generate interest or yield right
 
04:12:12.950 --> 04:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
now um what I think you'll hear from Mr
 
04:12:12.960 --> 04:12:14.670 align:start position:0%
now um what I think you'll hear from Mr
G

04:12:14.670 --> 04:12:14.680 align:start position:0%
G
 
04:12:18.990 --> 04:12:19.000 align:start position:0%
is what the state revenue impacts would
 
04:12:21.830 --> 04:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
be from the various business taxes
 
04:12:25.950 --> 04:12:25.960 align:start position:0%
property taxes rooms and Mills because
 
04:12:28.469 --> 04:12:28.479 align:start position:0%
of the economic expansion all right
 
04:12:30.990 --> 04:12:31.000 align:start position:0%
thank you all right let's keep things
 
04:12:34.349 --> 04:12:34.359 align:start position:0%
short representative papichi M thank you
 
04:12:36.429 --> 04:12:36.439 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you senator for taking
 
04:12:39.870 --> 04:12:39.880 align:start position:0%
my question um it seems that the purpose
 
04:12:43.389 --> 04:12:43.399 align:start position:0%
of the legislation is to obviously
 
04:12:45.710 --> 04:12:45.720 align:start position:0%
require that all the Investments be made
 
04:12:46.910 --> 04:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
in New
 
04:12:49.229 --> 04:12:49.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has there been an analysis
 
04:12:51.950 --> 04:12:51.960 align:start position:0%
done over the fact that this will likely
 
04:12:55.349 --> 04:12:55.359 align:start position:0%
result in lesser yields and it will make
 
04:12:58.309 --> 04:12:58.319 align:start position:0%
the PDP less attractive to the towns and
 
04:13:01.830 --> 04:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
cities that are using it so you will
 
04:13:01.840 --> 04:13:02.870 align:start position:0%
cities that are using it so you will
hear

04:13:02.870 --> 04:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
hear
 
04:13:07.790 --> 04:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
from um other people what kind of rates
 
04:13:09.710 --> 04:13:09.720 align:start position:0%
will be
 
04:13:13.149 --> 04:13:13.159 align:start position:0%
generated based on the relationship
 
04:13:16.870 --> 04:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
ships they they currently have and
 
04:13:20.790 --> 04:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
probably based on what states like Maine
 
04:13:25.870 --> 04:13:25.880 align:start position:0%
have but in addition we will get um the
 
04:13:29.109 --> 04:13:29.119 align:start position:0%
cities and towns will get the
 
04:13:33.149 --> 04:13:33.159 align:start position:0%
added money from property
 
04:13:37.710 --> 04:13:37.720 align:start position:0%
taxes the additional rooms and meals tax
 
04:13:40.790 --> 04:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
distributions remember they get
 
04:13:43.750 --> 04:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
30% so as that
 
04:13:43.760 --> 04:13:46.070 align:start position:0%
30% so as that
Pi

04:13:46.070 --> 04:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
Pi
 
04:13:48.590 --> 04:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
expands got it thank you it will be
 
04:13:52.389 --> 04:13:52.399 align:start position:0%
calculated Mr gam I think will tell you
 
04:13:55.710 --> 04:13:55.720 align:start position:0%
that the cities and towns will generate
 
04:14:00.750 --> 04:14:00.760 align:start position:0%
an extra $67 million over five years
 
04:14:04.630 --> 04:14:04.640 align:start position:0%
looking only at onethird of the banking
 
04:14:07.990 --> 04:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
sector all right no further questions
 
04:14:10.630 --> 04:14:10.640 align:start position:0%
from committee thank you
 
04:14:13.750 --> 04:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
Senator next call on
 
04:14:26.750 --> 04:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:30.229 --> 04:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
mentioned oh sorry I am for the record
 
04:14:32.389 --> 04:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
I'm Brian golop principal of polycon
 
04:14:34.870 --> 04:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
research and economic research firm
 
04:14:36.670 --> 04:14:36.680 align:start position:0%
located in Dober New Hampshire some of
 
04:14:39.590 --> 04:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
you may also know me um in my other role
 
04:14:40.950 --> 04:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
which is the director of the state's
 
04:14:42.670 --> 04:14:42.680 align:start position:0%
economic and labor market information
 
04:14:42.680 --> 04:14:43.790 align:start position:0%
economic and labor market information
Bureau

04:14:43.790 --> 04:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
Bureau
 
04:14:46.469 --> 04:14:46.479 align:start position:0%
here to say that I am um taking leave
 
04:14:49.229 --> 04:14:49.239 align:start position:0%
time to come and testify in support of
 
04:14:52.830 --> 04:14:52.840 align:start position:0%
this particular bill um I believe and
 
04:14:54.870 --> 04:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald referenc the study I
 
04:14:56.229 --> 04:14:56.239 align:start position:0%
conducted I'm not going to take you
 
04:14:58.229 --> 04:14:58.239 align:start position:0%
through it is very long exhaustive I
 
04:15:00.630 --> 04:15:00.640 align:start position:0%
believe you'll all have copies of it um
 
04:15:02.189 --> 04:15:02.199 align:start position:0%
I will talk a little bit about some of
 
04:15:03.870 --> 04:15:03.880 align:start position:0%
the data in there and some of the
 
04:15:05.910 --> 04:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
updates because when I did that analysis
 
04:15:10.710 --> 04:15:10.720 align:start position:0%
it was based on data U from June of 20
 
04:15:14.229 --> 04:15:14.239 align:start position:0%
uh 23 when there was 500 $30 million in
 
04:15:16.630 --> 04:15:16.640 align:start position:0%
the pool and now there is as mentioned
 
04:15:19.710 --> 04:15:19.720 align:start position:0%
over $600 million um I think the report
 
04:15:22.870 --> 04:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
makes a compelling economic case for
 
04:15:26.149 --> 04:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
investing those funds in New Hampshire
 
04:15:28.149 --> 04:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
um I think you will see that when you
 
04:15:30.670 --> 04:15:30.680 align:start position:0%
look at the report but I'm also here to
 
04:15:32.630 --> 04:15:32.640 align:start position:0%
talk about what I think is the ethical
 
04:15:36.189 --> 04:15:36.199 align:start position:0%
reasons for doing that um the dollars
 
04:15:39.870 --> 04:15:39.880 align:start position:0%
that we obtain cities towns and state
 
04:15:43.870 --> 04:15:43.880 align:start position:0%
from taxpayers households and businesses
 
04:15:46.229 --> 04:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
I think ought to be deployed uh to
 
04:15:49.309 --> 04:15:49.319 align:start position:0%
benefit those households individuals and
 
04:15:52.189 --> 04:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
businesses and the state's economy um
 
04:15:55.189 --> 04:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
currently um I was surprised when I
 
04:15:58.309 --> 04:15:58.319 align:start position:0%
first started doing my research to learn
 
04:16:01.750 --> 04:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
that over $600 million is not going to
 
04:16:04.670 --> 04:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
benefit um households businesses and the
 
04:16:07.950 --> 04:16:07.960 align:start position:0%
state economy and in fact is going um
 
04:16:10.030 --> 04:16:10.040 align:start position:0%
largely to
 
04:16:12.070 --> 04:16:12.080 align:start position:0%
organizations um throughout the country
 
04:16:14.790 --> 04:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
and in importantly throughout the world
 
04:16:17.349 --> 04:16:17.359 align:start position:0%
um people that I talked to households
 
04:16:20.309 --> 04:16:20.319 align:start position:0%
businesses were largely unaware of this
 
04:16:23.790 --> 04:16:23.800 align:start position:0%
um I think they shared in large numbers
 
04:16:26.149 --> 04:16:26.159 align:start position:0%
the uh view that I shared that that
 
04:16:29.389 --> 04:16:29.399 align:start position:0%
money that we give to the state we give
 
04:16:32.670 --> 04:16:32.680 align:start position:0%
to the towns ought to be used to benefit
 
04:16:34.950 --> 04:16:34.960 align:start position:0%
towns and the state of New Hampshire and
 
04:16:37.910 --> 04:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
its economy I do believe in free markets
 
04:16:40.349 --> 04:16:40.359 align:start position:0%
I'm a business person I believe in free
 
04:16:44.510 --> 04:16:44.520 align:start position:0%
markets Senate Bill 550 three does not
 
04:16:47.309 --> 04:16:47.319 align:start position:0%
mandate that any Community where it
 
04:16:49.269 --> 04:16:49.279 align:start position:0%
should invest its
 
04:16:51.950 --> 04:16:51.960 align:start position:0%
funds but if they choose to invest those
 
04:16:54.950 --> 04:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
funds in the
 
04:16:57.790 --> 04:16:57.800 align:start position:0%
pitp I believe that's an organization
 
04:17:00.630 --> 04:17:00.640 align:start position:0%
that was established by this legislature
 
04:17:03.389 --> 04:17:03.399 align:start position:0%
and sanctioned by this
 
04:17:05.950 --> 04:17:05.960 align:start position:0%
legislature and as a result of that I
 
04:17:07.830 --> 04:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
think it ought to support the goals and
 
04:17:11.030 --> 04:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
objectives and policies of this body and
 
04:17:13.630 --> 04:17:13.640 align:start position:0%
I believe the primary polic policy
 
04:17:15.510 --> 04:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
objective of the New Hampshire
 
04:17:17.469 --> 04:17:17.479 align:start position:0%
legislature is to increase the
 
04:17:20.229 --> 04:17:20.239 align:start position:0%
well-being the prosperity of
 
04:17:22.670 --> 04:17:22.680 align:start position:0%
individuals businesses and the state
 
04:17:22.680 --> 04:17:24.229 align:start position:0%
individuals businesses and the state
economy

04:17:24.229 --> 04:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
economy
 
04:17:27.590 --> 04:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
overall currently $600 million of
 
04:17:31.790 --> 04:17:31.800 align:start position:0%
taxpayer funds does not go to meet that
 
04:17:34.630 --> 04:17:34.640 align:start position:0%
objective keeping public funds in New
 
04:17:37.149 --> 04:17:37.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will increase access to
 
04:17:39.670 --> 04:17:39.680 align:start position:0%
business credit that is really the focus
 
04:17:41.349 --> 04:17:41.359 align:start position:0%
of the research Senator rosenal
 
04:17:43.910 --> 04:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned I did not Factor in the
 
04:17:45.910 --> 04:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
increase in credit availability that
 
04:17:49.309 --> 04:17:49.319 align:start position:0%
would occur as a result of lending to
 
04:17:51.550 --> 04:17:51.560 align:start position:0%
households I did that for a particular
 
04:17:55.590 --> 04:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
reason small businesses really rely on
 
04:17:59.030 --> 04:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
credit from local banking institutions
 
04:18:00.950 --> 04:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
for their lifeblood they do not for the
 
04:18:03.469 --> 04:18:03.479 align:start position:0%
most part have access to credit
 
04:18:06.389 --> 04:18:06.399 align:start position:0%
Nationwide households to a large extent
 
04:18:08.710 --> 04:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
do there's fintech there's opportunities
 
04:18:10.590 --> 04:18:10.600 align:start position:0%
to to borrow from organizations
 
04:18:12.950 --> 04:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
throughout throughout the country over
 
04:18:16.269 --> 04:18:16.279 align:start position:0%
90% of the deposits in in New Hampshire
 
04:18:20.109 --> 04:18:20.119 align:start position:0%
banks are lent out 34% based on the last
 
04:18:23.790 --> 04:18:23.800 align:start position:0%
10 years Senator rosewald mentioned is
 
04:18:26.590 --> 04:18:26.600 align:start position:0%
for businesses largely for small
 
04:18:28.229 --> 04:18:28.239 align:start position:0%
businesses in the
 
04:18:31.109 --> 04:18:31.119 align:start position:0%
state there are organizations throughout
 
04:18:34.269 --> 04:18:34.279 align:start position:0%
this state that seek and understand the
 
04:18:36.950 --> 04:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
importance of business credit and look
 
04:18:39.229 --> 04:18:39.239 align:start position:0%
to expand access to credit for small
 
04:18:40.870 --> 04:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
business we have the small business
 
04:18:42.830 --> 04:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
administration we have the New Hampshire
 
04:18:45.189 --> 04:18:45.199 align:start position:0%
business Finance Authority and we have
 
04:18:47.269 --> 04:18:47.279 align:start position:0%
Regional economic development
 
04:18:49.349 --> 04:18:49.359 align:start position:0%
organizations throughout the state with
 
04:18:52.109 --> 04:18:52.119 align:start position:0%
lending pools all with one objective and
 
04:18:54.830 --> 04:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
that's to increase credit to small
 
04:18:59.389 --> 04:18:59.399 align:start position:0%
businesses SB 553 is a way to do that
 
04:19:02.269 --> 04:19:02.279 align:start position:0%
does not establish a new organization
 
04:19:05.750 --> 04:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
and it does not require any public funds
 
04:19:07.590 --> 04:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
it's the easiest and simplest way you
 
04:19:10.429 --> 04:19:10.439 align:start position:0%
can increase credit to businesses and
 
04:19:15.309 --> 04:19:15.319 align:start position:0%
expand the the New Hampshire economy
 
04:19:18.510 --> 04:19:18.520 align:start position:0%
so what are the impacts based on the
 
04:19:21.830 --> 04:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
updated information that I have first
 
04:19:24.710 --> 04:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
that two 200 over $200 million of
 
04:19:27.309 --> 04:19:27.319 align:start position:0%
additional business credit largely small
 
04:19:29.309 --> 04:19:29.319 align:start position:0%
businesses will increase the state's
 
04:19:31.990 --> 04:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
gross domestic product there's a strong
 
04:19:34.389 --> 04:19:34.399 align:start position:0%
relationship between growth in state
 
04:19:36.710 --> 04:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
Gross State product and growth in state
 
04:19:39.349 --> 04:19:39.359 align:start position:0%
and local revenues very strong
 
04:19:39.359 --> 04:19:40.870 align:start position:0%
and local revenues very strong
statistical

04:19:40.870 --> 04:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
statistical
 
04:19:43.910 --> 04:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
relationship so 200 over $200 million
 
04:19:46.070 --> 04:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
increase in Gross State product over
 
04:19:49.670 --> 04:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
2,000 more jobs
 
04:19:52.030 --> 04:19:52.040 align:start position:0%
combined state and local Revenue
 
04:19:55.510 --> 04:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
increases just in year 2024 I estimated
 
04:20:00.429 --> 04:20:00.439 align:start position:0%
about $26 million but over and over a
 
04:20:03.750 --> 04:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
fiveyear period $129 million split
 
04:20:05.750 --> 04:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
fairly evenly between state and local
 
04:20:07.830 --> 04:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
and and is outlined in the report where
 
04:20:10.830 --> 04:20:10.840 align:start position:0%
I detail the individual tax revenues
 
04:20:13.229 --> 04:20:13.239 align:start position:0%
state tax revenues that I that I believe
 
04:20:16.590 --> 04:20:16.600 align:start position:0%
will be increased but $129 million over
 
04:20:18.910 --> 04:20:18.920 align:start position:0%
5 years there will also be additional
 
04:20:21.109 --> 04:20:21.119 align:start position:0%
because there'll be additional economic
 
04:20:24.550 --> 04:20:24.560 align:start position:0%
opportunities be increase of I estimate
 
04:20:27.309 --> 04:20:27.319 align:start position:0%
2100 individuals population in New
 
04:20:30.349 --> 04:20:30.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and 1,300 over 1300
 
04:20:32.630 --> 04:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
individuals in our labor force and
 
04:20:34.710 --> 04:20:34.720 align:start position:0%
that's all while providing interest
 
04:20:39.189 --> 04:20:39.199 align:start position:0%
income at about the same rate as is
 
04:20:39.199 --> 04:20:40.469 align:start position:0%
income at about the same rate as is
currently

04:20:40.469 --> 04:20:40.479 align:start position:0%
currently
 
04:20:43.269 --> 04:20:43.279 align:start position:0%
being achieved through investment in the
 
04:20:45.229 --> 04:20:45.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Public deposit investment
 
04:20:47.950 --> 04:20:47.960 align:start position:0%
pool there was a question asked earlier
 
04:20:49.469 --> 04:20:49.479 align:start position:0%
what is the current rate well there is
 
04:20:51.630 --> 04:20:51.640 align:start position:0%
no one current rate because communities
 
04:20:54.030 --> 04:20:54.040 align:start position:0%
negotiate individually with banks I
 
04:20:55.710 --> 04:20:55.720 align:start position:0%
spoke to a number of Banks and asked
 
04:20:57.469 --> 04:20:57.479 align:start position:0%
them what their rate was I spoke to a
 
04:20:58.630 --> 04:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
number of of
 
04:21:01.030 --> 04:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
organizations that had the choice of
 
04:21:03.750 --> 04:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
going into the public deposit investment
 
04:21:06.950 --> 04:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
pool and the reality is the rates are
 
04:21:09.510 --> 04:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
very very close but what tips the
 
04:21:11.790 --> 04:21:11.800 align:start position:0%
balance is when you add the revenue and
 
04:21:14.550 --> 04:21:14.560 align:start position:0%
the economic gains from investing in New
 
04:21:16.750 --> 04:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's not even close the
 
04:21:18.990 --> 04:21:19.000 align:start position:0%
combined yield is approximately double
 
04:21:20.990 --> 04:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
what is achieved through investment in
 
04:21:23.750 --> 04:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
the public deposit investment pool for
 
04:21:26.590 --> 04:21:26.600 align:start position:0%
all of these reasons um I ask your
 
04:21:29.670 --> 04:21:29.680 align:start position:0%
support for Senate Bill 553 and with
 
04:21:31.790 --> 04:21:31.800 align:start position:0%
that I'll take questions could you
 
04:21:33.710 --> 04:21:33.720 align:start position:0%
ensure that we all get a copy of your
 
04:21:35.630 --> 04:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
report I don't think I've seen it yet
 
04:21:39.750 --> 04:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:42.309 --> 04:21:42.319 align:start position:0%
is if you've given it to well we will
 
04:21:44.870 --> 04:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
get report a copy of the report I was I
 
04:21:47.510 --> 04:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
didn't realize you so the key to my mind
 
04:21:50.229 --> 04:21:50.239 align:start position:0%
is what is the total lending from all
 
04:21:52.630 --> 04:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
the banks in the state at this
 
04:21:59.670 --> 04:21:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:04.550 --> 04:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
of it's 15 16 billion more I it's really
 
04:22:09.269 --> 04:22:09.279 align:start position:0%
hard for me to to to say um I I I know
 
04:22:10.870 --> 04:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
what the deposits are I don't really
 
04:22:12.590 --> 04:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe we'll hear that from some
 
04:22:14.189 --> 04:22:14.199 align:start position:0%
okay some other person because to me
 
04:22:15.830 --> 04:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
it's critical whether you're talking
 
04:22:18.990 --> 04:22:19.000 align:start position:0%
about the 685 million getting added to a
 
04:22:22.189 --> 04:22:22.199 align:start position:0%
billion or add to 10 billion either is a
 
04:22:25.590 --> 04:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
little piece or it overcomes it briefly
 
04:22:28.189 --> 04:22:28.199 align:start position:0%
so those are those are key figures in My
 
04:22:30.750 --> 04:22:30.760 align:start position:0%
Mind questions from committee Members
 
04:22:31.950 --> 04:22:31.960 align:start position:0%
First representative McGuire then
 
04:22:31.960 --> 04:22:33.070 align:start position:0%
First representative McGuire then
representative

04:22:33.070 --> 04:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:22:35.590 --> 04:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
string thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
04:22:37.630 --> 04:22:37.640 align:start position:0%
you for coming and I I really like the
 
04:22:40.630 --> 04:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
elme uh Community profile section I've
 
04:22:43.670 --> 04:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
used those for years they're great
 
04:22:48.269 --> 04:22:48.279 align:start position:0%
um so aren't there some downsides here
 
04:22:51.349 --> 04:22:51.359 align:start position:0%
in this in both in risk and and in
 
04:22:55.950 --> 04:22:55.960 align:start position:0%
reward in the sense that um this would
 
04:22:58.710 --> 04:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
concentrate um all these Savings in the
 
04:23:01.389 --> 04:23:01.399 align:start position:0%
state and should the state God forbid
 
04:23:04.550 --> 04:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
have some kind of a regional or local
 
04:23:08.189 --> 04:23:08.199 align:start position:0%
disaster wouldn't that put these funds
 
04:23:09.950 --> 04:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
at risk in a way that if they were
 
04:23:14.149 --> 04:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
elsewhere would not and and secondly at
 
04:23:15.710 --> 04:23:15.720 align:start position:0%
a time when it you know they might be
 
04:23:20.469 --> 04:23:20.479 align:start position:0%
very needed and then in reward um if we
 
04:23:22.990 --> 04:23:23.000 align:start position:0%
guarantee that these funds can only be
 
04:23:26.790 --> 04:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
invested in the state wouldn't that make
 
04:23:30.550 --> 04:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
the um the banks and so on in the
 
04:23:32.990 --> 04:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
State uh because they have this
 
04:23:34.910 --> 04:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
guaranteed sort of investment they
 
04:23:37.149 --> 04:23:37.159 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to be quite as competitive
 
04:23:39.750 --> 04:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
as they do now yeah one thing I would
 
04:23:41.189 --> 04:23:41.199 align:start position:0%
say is that they're not guaranteed
 
04:23:43.830 --> 04:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
anything because because communities are
 
04:23:47.550 --> 04:23:47.560 align:start position:0%
not required to invest if there became
 
04:23:50.229 --> 04:23:50.239 align:start position:0%
if Senate Bill 553 passed there's
 
04:23:53.910 --> 04:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
nothing arguing that a community has to
 
04:23:56.550 --> 04:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
continue or would have to invest in in
 
04:23:58.590 --> 04:23:58.600 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire it could invest choose
 
04:24:00.510 --> 04:24:00.520 align:start position:0%
another investment advisor and go
 
04:24:02.910 --> 04:24:02.920 align:start position:0%
wherever it chose to go so there's no
 
04:24:05.109 --> 04:24:05.119 align:start position:0%
guarantee of any money I also do think
 
04:24:07.229 --> 04:24:07.239 align:start position:0%
that there is a real competition among
 
04:24:10.030 --> 04:24:10.040 align:start position:0%
banks for those funds you
 
04:24:12.990 --> 04:24:13.000 align:start position:0%
know local banks
 
04:24:15.469 --> 04:24:15.479 align:start position:0%
acquiring deposits is key it's key to
 
04:24:17.389 --> 04:24:17.399 align:start position:0%
their growth it's key to their ability
 
04:24:19.750 --> 04:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
to lend and so there will be pretty
 
04:24:22.550 --> 04:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
significant competition for those funds
 
04:24:24.990 --> 04:24:25.000 align:start position:0%
because it's a way of
 
04:24:28.349 --> 04:24:28.359 align:start position:0%
adding adding deposits and increasing
 
04:24:30.189 --> 04:24:30.199 align:start position:0%
the potential for profitability so I
 
04:24:32.030 --> 04:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
think there'll be plenty of competition
 
04:24:34.070 --> 04:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
as far as the risk goes there's risks
 
04:24:36.469 --> 04:24:36.479 align:start position:0%
there is no collateralization required
 
04:24:39.389 --> 04:24:39.399 align:start position:0%
of the P pitp funds which means there is
 
04:24:42.030 --> 04:24:42.040 align:start position:0%
no guarantee deposits in New Hampshire
 
04:24:44.469 --> 04:24:44.479 align:start position:0%
Banks are required to have collateral so
 
04:24:47.109 --> 04:24:47.119 align:start position:0%
there is a guarantee offered there so I
 
04:24:48.870 --> 04:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
would argue it reduces
 
04:24:52.670 --> 04:24:52.680 align:start position:0%
risk thank you so one one followup so is
 
04:24:55.550 --> 04:24:55.560 align:start position:0%
there any particular reason why we
 
04:24:58.510 --> 04:24:58.520 align:start position:0%
couldn't do both right why why can't we
 
04:25:02.030 --> 04:25:02.040 align:start position:0%
have two funds one is is can be invested
 
04:25:04.349 --> 04:25:04.359 align:start position:0%
anywhere one that's invested only in New
 
04:25:06.990 --> 04:25:07.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and allow the municipalities
 
04:25:08.469 --> 04:25:08.479 align:start position:0%
to decide do they want to put all their
 
04:25:10.630 --> 04:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
money in one all in the other some
 
04:25:13.269 --> 04:25:13.279 align:start position:0%
combination Etc what's wrong with that
 
04:25:15.189 --> 04:25:15.199 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire that's well
 
04:25:17.510 --> 04:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
beyond my payg grade to me that's a
 
04:25:20.349 --> 04:25:20.359 align:start position:0%
that's a policy decision and and not was
 
04:25:22.309 --> 04:25:22.319 align:start position:0%
outside the realm of my research so I
 
04:25:24.070 --> 04:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
really can't speak to that
 
04:25:25.710 --> 04:25:25.720 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham for a question
 
04:25:27.429 --> 04:25:27.439 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your testimony and
 
04:25:29.070 --> 04:25:29.080 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question the
 
04:25:31.870 --> 04:25:31.880 align:start position:0%
question I have is uh um you kind of
 
04:25:35.990 --> 04:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
following the uh econometric logic is if
 
04:25:39.109 --> 04:25:39.119 align:start position:0%
uh um say you're required to invest in
 
04:25:41.349 --> 04:25:41.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh you put the Money in
 
04:25:42.750 --> 04:25:42.760 align:start position:0%
the Bank of New Hampshire
 
04:25:45.750 --> 04:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
or Citizens Bank uh that are doing lots
 
04:25:48.990 --> 04:25:49.000 align:start position:0%
of local lending now uh wouldn't they
 
04:25:50.950 --> 04:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
just decrease the amount of money
 
04:25:54.429 --> 04:25:54.439 align:start position:0%
they're getting from from outside of of
 
04:25:57.070 --> 04:25:57.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire s most most banks operate
 
04:25:59.950 --> 04:25:59.960 align:start position:0%
in more than one state um I assume we're
 
04:26:01.870 --> 04:26:01.880 align:start position:0%
not going to be investing in a Jenkins
 
04:26:04.750 --> 04:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
Bike Shop directly uh our investments
 
04:26:06.590 --> 04:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
will go through local financial
 
04:26:08.550 --> 04:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
institutions who will then just change
 
04:26:10.630 --> 04:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
the mix of where their funds come from
 
04:26:12.510 --> 04:26:12.520 align:start position:0%
and where they go I think the the the
 
04:26:14.429 --> 04:26:14.439 align:start position:0%
protection there uh and I've heard this
 
04:26:16.030 --> 04:26:16.040 align:start position:0%
before well if the money goes to New
 
04:26:17.550 --> 04:26:17.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Bay there's no guarantee that
 
04:26:19.109 --> 04:26:19.119 align:start position:0%
they lend in New Hampshire well there is
 
04:26:21.389 --> 04:26:21.399 align:start position:0%
a guarantee there's a requirement called
 
04:26:23.670 --> 04:26:23.680 align:start position:0%
this community reinvestment act that
 
04:26:26.550 --> 04:26:26.560 align:start position:0%
looks at Banks
 
04:26:30.750 --> 04:26:30.760 align:start position:0%
and looks at their um their their
 
04:26:32.830 --> 04:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
practices and meeting the credit needs
 
04:26:35.229 --> 04:26:35.239 align:start position:0%
of households and individuals in their
 
04:26:37.550 --> 04:26:37.560 align:start position:0%
operating regions and they're graded on
 
04:26:40.469 --> 04:26:40.479 align:start position:0%
that so there is an expectation that
 
04:26:43.309 --> 04:26:43.319 align:start position:0%
money that is obtained locally and
 
04:26:45.790 --> 04:26:45.800 align:start position:0%
deposited in local banks will be
 
04:26:49.070 --> 04:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
invested in the local Regional economy
 
04:26:50.830 --> 04:26:50.840 align:start position:0%
either through household or business
 
04:26:52.870 --> 04:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
Ling or in other way so there is some
 
04:26:55.590 --> 04:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
there is some guarantee there quick
 
04:26:58.590 --> 04:26:58.600 align:start position:0%
followup follow but don't they also get
 
04:27:00.670 --> 04:27:00.680 align:start position:0%
money from out of
 
04:27:04.109 --> 04:27:04.119 align:start position:0%
state it you know I think that would
 
04:27:08.030 --> 04:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
really depend on on uh particular Banks
 
04:27:11.189 --> 04:27:11.199 align:start position:0%
I my and I I'm not a banker and I
 
04:27:12.670 --> 04:27:12.680 align:start position:0%
apologize to all the bank Bankers in
 
04:27:15.550 --> 04:27:15.560 align:start position:0%
this room I'm assuming that most local
 
04:27:18.349 --> 04:27:18.359 align:start position:0%
banks Community Banks primarily receive
 
04:27:21.070 --> 04:27:21.080 align:start position:0%
their deposits from local organizations
 
04:27:23.109 --> 04:27:23.119 align:start position:0%
and individuals but I could be wrong and
 
04:27:24.990 --> 04:27:25.000 align:start position:0%
they'd have to address that why don't we
 
04:27:26.510 --> 04:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
wait until we have Bankers there's going
 
04:27:27.710 --> 04:27:27.720 align:start position:0%
to be several of them if you have
 
04:27:27.720 --> 04:27:29.109 align:start position:0%
to be several of them if you have
banking

04:27:29.109 --> 04:27:29.119 align:start position:0%
banking
 
04:27:31.149 --> 04:27:31.159 align:start position:0%
questions let's hear from the people who
 
04:27:32.590 --> 04:27:32.600 align:start position:0%
are the
 
04:27:35.349 --> 04:27:35.359 align:start position:0%
bankers represent Edwards uh uh thank
 
04:27:38.950 --> 04:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um so I'm I'm I'm not
 
04:27:42.670 --> 04:27:42.680 align:start position:0%
particularly familiar with RSA 645 so I
 
04:27:44.710 --> 04:27:44.720 align:start position:0%
just Googled it it's the one that sets
 
04:27:47.630 --> 04:27:47.640 align:start position:0%
up the public depos deposit investment
 
04:27:50.590 --> 04:27:50.600 align:start position:0%
pool and what I was looking for as I was
 
04:27:52.870 --> 04:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
looking in there was to determine
 
04:27:56.269 --> 04:27:56.279 align:start position:0%
whether or not uh the law established a
 
04:27:59.189 --> 04:27:59.199 align:start position:0%
clear fiduciary responsibility within
 
04:28:04.990 --> 04:28:05.000 align:start position:0%
this fund to uh optimize a risk reward
 
04:28:07.990 --> 04:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
balance uh which is typical of most
 
04:28:10.070 --> 04:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
investment funds they have a fiduciary
 
04:28:12.790 --> 04:28:12.800 align:start position:0%
responsibility of maximizing a return on
 
04:28:15.389 --> 04:28:15.399 align:start position:0%
investment within safety
 
04:28:18.070 --> 04:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
criteria is is that sort of language
 
04:28:21.750 --> 04:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
already in 645 and I'm just missing it
 
04:28:24.349 --> 04:28:24.359 align:start position:0%
again um not I'm not a lawyer I'm an
 
04:28:27.389 --> 04:28:27.399 align:start position:0%
economist so I I can't uh really so my
 
04:28:30.109 --> 04:28:30.119 align:start position:0%
followup though is would wouldn't that
 
04:28:32.429 --> 04:28:32.439 align:start position:0%
actually maybe be a better way to go is
 
04:28:34.670 --> 04:28:34.680 align:start position:0%
to make sure that this fund is set up
 
04:28:36.109 --> 04:28:36.119 align:start position:0%
with the right fiduciary
 
04:28:38.389 --> 04:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and the proper
 
04:28:42.309 --> 04:28:42.319 align:start position:0%
investment objective uh and to delegate
 
04:28:45.469 --> 04:28:45.479 align:start position:0%
to them the option of where they invest
 
04:28:47.349 --> 04:28:47.359 align:start position:0%
as long as they're making a proper risk
 
04:28:51.189 --> 04:28:51.199 align:start position:0%
reward benefit analysis I there's a
 
04:28:54.030 --> 04:28:54.040 align:start position:0%
number of ways to measure reward um I'm
 
04:28:56.309 --> 04:28:56.319 align:start position:0%
an economist I look at economic uh
 
04:28:58.550 --> 04:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
rewards and that means what's happening
 
04:29:00.269 --> 04:29:00.279 align:start position:0%
to the state's GDP what's happening to
 
04:29:02.349 --> 04:29:02.359 align:start position:0%
personal income which by the way I
 
04:29:04.349 --> 04:29:04.359 align:start position:0%
estimate would increase by about $ 1.7
 
04:29:06.990 --> 04:29:07.000 align:start position:0%
billion dollar out till
 
04:29:09.429 --> 04:29:09.439 align:start position:0%
2030 um if those funds were invested in
 
04:29:13.990 --> 04:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh but it you know risk
 
04:29:16.550 --> 04:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
reward if you're looking at a simple
 
04:29:19.790 --> 04:29:19.800 align:start position:0%
return in terms of interest income or a
 
04:29:22.590 --> 04:29:22.600 align:start position:0%
yield on an investment is one way of
 
04:29:25.630 --> 04:29:25.640 align:start position:0%
maximizing returns I take a broader View
 
04:29:30.670 --> 04:29:30.680 align:start position:0%
and I think based on the you my belief
 
04:29:32.870 --> 04:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
that funds in New Hampshire ought to
 
04:29:35.229 --> 04:29:35.239 align:start position:0%
benefit New Hampshire there's many ways
 
04:29:37.349 --> 04:29:37.359 align:start position:0%
that that can occur and one way is to
 
04:29:41.109 --> 04:29:41.119 align:start position:0%
create more job opportunities and more
 
04:29:43.510 --> 04:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr sure so I I do think
 
04:29:45.950 --> 04:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
that all right we don't have I can't
 
04:29:47.630 --> 04:29:47.640 align:start position:0%
really speak to that I'm sorry
 
04:29:51.670 --> 04:29:51.680 align:start position:0%
representative papichi M just a very
 
04:29:54.990 --> 04:29:55.000 align:start position:0%
quick question uh besides I I assume
 
04:29:57.229 --> 04:29:57.239 align:start position:0%
that you'd be uh here to testify during
 
04:29:59.950 --> 04:29:59.960 align:start position:0%
the work session on this bill would that
 
04:30:03.109 --> 04:30:03.119 align:start position:0%
be something I should assume um I will
 
04:30:05.429 --> 04:30:05.439 align:start position:0%
make myself available I would appreciate
 
04:30:08.429 --> 04:30:08.439 align:start position:0%
that and my question is when
 
04:30:12.030 --> 04:30:12.040 align:start position:0%
you created your model right did you
 
04:30:15.229 --> 04:30:15.239 align:start position:0%
assume that for example the
 
04:30:17.550 --> 04:30:17.560 align:start position:0%
interest Return of the investments will
 
04:30:19.710 --> 04:30:19.720 align:start position:0%
be the same regardless of the change in
 
04:30:21.790 --> 04:30:21.800 align:start position:0%
the legislation did you assume that
 
04:30:23.910 --> 04:30:23.920 align:start position:0%
every dollar now that's now invested out
 
04:30:26.309 --> 04:30:26.319 align:start position:0%
of state will now be invested in state
 
04:30:27.990 --> 04:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
could you talk about those assumptions
 
04:30:30.670 --> 04:30:30.680 align:start position:0%
yeah and those are all in the report um
 
04:30:33.269 --> 04:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
my analys yeah the my analysis used a
 
04:30:36.870 --> 04:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
range of uh possible returns from local
 
04:30:40.630 --> 04:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
banks um ranging from a low of 3% up to
 
04:30:40.640 --> 04:30:42.189 align:start position:0%
banks um ranging from a low of 3% up to
5.5%

04:30:42.189 --> 04:30:42.199 align:start position:0%
5.5%
 
04:30:45.710 --> 04:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
currently the pitp is something over 5%
 
04:30:48.910 --> 04:30:48.920 align:start position:0%
so I I didn't go above really go above
 
04:30:51.269 --> 04:30:51.279 align:start position:0%
that but looked at what the combined
 
04:30:53.990 --> 04:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
return would be in terms of tax revenue
 
04:30:56.189 --> 04:30:56.199 align:start position:0%
for the state state and local
 
04:30:58.830 --> 04:30:58.840 align:start position:0%
communities plus the interest income
 
04:31:01.309 --> 04:31:01.319 align:start position:0%
earned on that money at 3% three and a
 
04:31:03.389 --> 04:31:03.399 align:start position:0%
half% all the way through and made those
 
04:31:05.030 --> 04:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
assumptions also made the same
 
04:31:07.750 --> 04:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
assumptions on the economic returns
 
04:31:10.550 --> 04:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
depending on what the yield or what the
 
04:31:12.590 --> 04:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
interest income would be so there's a
 
04:31:15.710 --> 04:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
full range uh of of those kinds of
 
04:31:18.030 --> 04:31:18.040 align:start position:0%
analysis thank you members if you could
 
04:31:19.389 --> 04:31:19.399 align:start position:0%
hold your questions you'll be hearing
 
04:31:20.990 --> 04:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
from Bankers you'll be hearing from the
 
04:31:22.990 --> 04:31:23.000 align:start position:0%
people who invest the money you'll be
 
04:31:24.750 --> 04:31:24.760 align:start position:0%
hearing from many people who oppose the
 
04:31:26.670 --> 04:31:26.680 align:start position:0%
bill and we want to be hearing from them
 
04:31:30.030 --> 04:31:30.040 align:start position:0%
as well so thank you Mr godb thank you
 
04:31:32.630 --> 04:31:32.640 align:start position:0%

04:32:22.189 --> 04:32:22.199 align:start position:0%
legislation for two main
 
04:32:24.950 --> 04:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
reasons as you heard earlier this
 
04:32:26.429 --> 04:32:26.439 align:start position:0%
legislation grows New Hampshire's
 
04:32:29.030 --> 04:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
economy and second it levels the playing
 
04:32:31.710 --> 04:32:31.720 align:start position:0%
field for public funds since the state
 
04:32:34.750 --> 04:32:34.760 align:start position:0%
created The Entity known as PB it
 
04:32:36.309 --> 04:32:36.319 align:start position:0%
competes against a private banking
 
04:32:38.469 --> 04:32:38.479 align:start position:0%
industry and is not currently required
 
04:32:42.070 --> 04:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
to secure or collateralize funds um we
 
04:32:44.910 --> 04:32:44.920 align:start position:0%
in I have my testimony for each of you
 
04:32:47.790 --> 04:32:47.800 align:start position:0%
um we have a one-pager of Brian's study
 
04:32:49.790 --> 04:32:49.800 align:start position:0%
but we can get you the full study and
 
04:32:51.429 --> 04:32:51.439 align:start position:0%
you've heard the results um in his
 
04:32:53.870 --> 04:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
update so I won't get into that but I do
 
04:32:55.630 --> 04:32:55.640 align:start position:0%
want to just expound a little bit on the
 
04:32:57.550 --> 04:32:57.560 align:start position:0%
point that he made about the results
 
04:32:59.910 --> 04:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
being conservative um Senator Rosenwald
 
04:33:02.149 --> 04:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
mentioned that um so what we know is
 
04:33:04.830 --> 04:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
according to the FDIC in New Hampshire
 
04:33:07.150 --> 04:33:07.160 align:start position:0%
um the loan to deposit ratio is
 
04:33:09.750 --> 04:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
90% And so what that means is for every
 
04:33:13.109 --> 04:33:13.119 align:start position:0%
dollar a bank takes in deposits 90 cents
 
04:33:15.150 --> 04:33:15.160 align:start position:0%
um is Lent back out into the community
 
04:33:16.910 --> 04:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
sorry apparently it's my alarm to not
 
04:33:22.189 --> 04:33:22.199 align:start position:0%
fall asleep um so uh sorry about that
 
04:33:25.349 --> 04:33:25.359 align:start position:0%
um so when Brian conducted his study
 
04:33:27.189 --> 04:33:27.199 align:start position:0%
what he did look at he mentioned that he
 
04:33:28.830 --> 04:33:28.840 align:start position:0%
focused on the commercial lending
 
04:33:31.070 --> 04:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
landscape and he said commercial lending
 
04:33:33.709 --> 04:33:33.719 align:start position:0%
makes up 34% of that entire lending
 
04:33:35.869 --> 04:33:35.879 align:start position:0%
picture so what what is lending include
 
04:33:38.189 --> 04:33:38.199 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that includes mortgages
 
04:33:40.709 --> 04:33:40.719 align:start position:0%
that conses uh includes Consumer loans
 
04:33:42.910 --> 04:33:42.920 align:start position:0%
auto loans those types of things that
 
04:33:45.510 --> 04:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
was not included in his analysis so
 
04:33:47.990 --> 04:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
although um the numbers are pretty
 
04:33:49.830 --> 04:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
impressive they are still conservative
 
04:33:50.910 --> 04:33:50.920 align:start position:0%
it's about a third of the lending
 
04:33:52.590 --> 04:33:52.600 align:start position:0%
picture so I just want to just highlight
 
04:33:55.269 --> 04:33:55.279 align:start position:0%
that point um so what does the economic
 
04:33:58.670 --> 04:33:58.680 align:start position:0%
study mean in Practical terms um you can
 
04:33:59.949 --> 04:33:59.959 align:start position:0%
you'll probably hear more about this
 
04:34:02.789 --> 04:34:02.799 align:start position:0%
later on but Banks because the loan to
 
04:34:05.510 --> 04:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
deposit ratio is 90% a lot of banks are
 
04:34:07.109 --> 04:34:07.119 align:start position:0%
lent out and they would like to lend
 
04:34:09.230 --> 04:34:09.240 align:start position:0%
more into the communities and they can't
 
04:34:11.029 --> 04:34:11.039 align:start position:0%
do that unless they have additional
 
04:34:13.429 --> 04:34:13.439 align:start position:0%
deposits and so this legislation would
 
04:34:15.629 --> 04:34:15.639 align:start position:0%
allow 600 million in PP to be put to
 
04:34:17.750 --> 04:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
work through additional forms of
 
04:34:20.029 --> 04:34:20.039 align:start position:0%
lending we've heard a little bit about
 
04:34:22.189 --> 04:34:22.199 align:start position:0%
how access to credit by small businesses
 
04:34:24.910 --> 04:34:24.920 align:start position:0%
is an issue and this will address that
 
04:34:27.109 --> 04:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
Brian mentions it's an additional 209
 
04:34:29.670 --> 04:34:29.680 align:start position:0%
million increased credit and that would
 
04:34:31.789 --> 04:34:31.799 align:start position:0%
um be available to small businesses and
 
04:34:33.750 --> 04:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
families allowing them to expand their
 
04:34:36.709 --> 04:34:36.719 align:start position:0%
operations and hire more people and this
 
04:34:38.830 --> 04:34:38.840 align:start position:0%
could also mean additional financing for
 
04:34:41.109 --> 04:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
developers um including for affordable
 
04:34:43.789 --> 04:34:43.799 align:start position:0%
housing project projects conversely
 
04:34:46.390 --> 04:34:46.400 align:start position:0%
funds invested in PIP are not kept
 
04:34:48.869 --> 04:34:48.879 align:start position:0%
locally at the Senate Finance hearing on
 
04:34:52.551 --> 04:34:52.561 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 553 um the fund managers
 
04:34:54.789 --> 04:34:54.799 align:start position:0%
testified that zero New Hampshire
 
04:34:58.510 --> 04:34:58.520 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars remain in New Hampshire
 
04:35:00.629 --> 04:35:00.639 align:start position:0%
you can look at the list of where the
 
04:35:02.470 --> 04:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
funds are invested but three that I'll
 
04:35:04.910 --> 04:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
just highlight for you uh National
 
04:35:09.230 --> 04:35:09.240 align:start position:0%
Australia Bank scandinava incal bankin
 
04:35:12.510 --> 04:35:12.520 align:start position:0%
in Sweden uh Sumit Tomo sui Bank in
 
04:35:14.349 --> 04:35:14.359 align:start position:0%
Japan sorry I can't pronounce those very
 
04:35:16.789 --> 04:35:16.799 align:start position:0%
well um so the other reason that we
 
04:35:18.429 --> 04:35:18.439 align:start position:0%
support this legislation is because it
 
04:35:20.029 --> 04:35:20.039 align:start position:0%
levels the playing field and so what do
 
04:35:23.390 --> 04:35:23.400 align:start position:0%
we mean by that taxpayer funds in PIP
 
04:35:25.709 --> 04:35:25.719 align:start position:0%
are not required to be secured or
 
04:35:27.990 --> 04:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
collateralized Banks however are
 
04:35:29.510 --> 04:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
required to offer
 
04:35:32.470 --> 04:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
collateralization through FDIC Insurance
 
04:35:34.590 --> 04:35:34.600 align:start position:0%
taxpayer funds are backed by the full
 
04:35:36.789 --> 04:35:36.799 align:start position:0%
faith and credit of the US government up
 
04:35:36.799 --> 04:35:38.070 align:start position:0%
faith and credit of the US government up
to

04:35:38.070 --> 04:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:35:41.070 --> 04:35:41.080 align:start position:0%
$250,000 and Banks can um ensure funds
 
04:35:43.709 --> 04:35:43.719 align:start position:0%
beyond that through various products in
 
04:35:47.070 --> 04:35:47.080 align:start position:0%
addition to Insurance Banks can offer
 
04:35:48.830 --> 04:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
collateralization through a letter of
 
04:35:51.029 --> 04:35:51.039 align:start position:0%
credit from the federal Home Loan Bank a
 
04:35:52.629 --> 04:35:52.639 align:start position:0%
repurchase agreement with the Federal
 
04:35:54.750 --> 04:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
Reserve or pledging of other high
 
04:35:57.869 --> 04:35:57.879 align:start position:0%
quality Securities and assets while it
 
04:36:00.629 --> 04:36:00.639 align:start position:0%
is prudent to secure taxpayer funds
 
04:36:03.230 --> 04:36:03.240 align:start position:0%
there is a cost to that and this is not
 
04:36:05.990 --> 04:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
a cost that pip is required to
 
04:36:08.750 --> 04:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
Bear uh the requirement to collateralize
 
04:36:11.670 --> 04:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
is is common around the country and just
 
04:36:13.990 --> 04:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
a few states that do that as an example
 
04:36:17.510 --> 04:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
Louisiana New Jersey Mississippi Oregon
 
04:36:20.629 --> 04:36:20.639 align:start position:0%
Texas and New York cities and towns have
 
04:36:23.349 --> 04:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
the ability to invest outside the pool
 
04:36:24.949 --> 04:36:24.959 align:start position:0%
however the investment of funds is
 
04:36:26.830 --> 04:36:26.840 align:start position:0%
required to be in obligations fully
 
04:36:28.429 --> 04:36:28.439 align:start position:0%
backed by the US government and
 
04:36:30.029 --> 04:36:30.039 align:start position:0%
repurchase agreements fully
 
04:36:32.629 --> 04:36:32.639 align:start position:0%
collateralized by S such options um the
 
04:36:36.349 --> 04:36:36.359 align:start position:0%
RSA for that is RSA 4816 and so while
 
04:36:38.510 --> 04:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
Finance officers have multiple options
 
04:36:40.390 --> 04:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
they can they can Finance directly with
 
04:36:42.750 --> 04:36:42.760 align:start position:0%
banks that has to be collateralized they
 
04:36:44.470 --> 04:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
can Finance through directly with other
 
04:36:46.551 --> 04:36:46.561 align:start position:0%
investment options that has to be
 
04:36:48.429 --> 04:36:48.439 align:start position:0%
collateralized but when they put funds
 
04:36:51.551 --> 04:36:51.561 align:start position:0%
in PP it does not so why do we need to
 
04:36:54.189 --> 04:36:54.199 align:start position:0%
change now a lot has happened since the
 
04:36:56.629 --> 04:36:56.639 align:start position:0%
creation of pup over 30 years ago
 
04:36:58.830 --> 04:36:58.840 align:start position:0%
especially when it comes to how funds
 
04:37:01.150 --> 04:37:01.160 align:start position:0%
are managed I'm guessing 30 years ago
 
04:37:03.150 --> 04:37:03.160 align:start position:0%
you probably rote a lot more checks you
 
04:37:04.910 --> 04:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
probably kept up your check register and
 
04:37:07.269 --> 04:37:07.279 align:start position:0%
you probably saved all of your receipts
 
04:37:08.551 --> 04:37:08.561 align:start position:0%
most people don't do that as much
 
04:37:10.949 --> 04:37:10.959 align:start position:0%
anymore personal finances changed a lot
 
04:37:13.869 --> 04:37:13.879 align:start position:0%
and so has Municipal Finance um today
 
04:37:16.349 --> 04:37:16.359 align:start position:0%
the tools to secure and collateralize
 
04:37:18.429 --> 04:37:18.439 align:start position:0%
funds are available simply did not exist
 
04:37:21.109 --> 04:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
and were not as available 30 years
 
04:37:24.310 --> 04:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
ago um so one of the things that we have
 
04:37:26.670 --> 04:37:26.680 align:start position:0%
heard in this discussion um and you may
 
04:37:28.789 --> 04:37:28.799 align:start position:0%
hear later today is that there is no
 
04:37:30.949 --> 04:37:30.959 align:start position:0%
requirement for banks to keep funds
 
04:37:33.150 --> 04:37:33.160 align:start position:0%
local and how do we know that fund that
 
04:37:34.910 --> 04:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
banks are actually keeping uh funds
 
04:37:37.269 --> 04:37:37.279 align:start position:0%
local uh you you folks are very close to
 
04:37:38.429 --> 04:37:38.439 align:start position:0%
your communities and you're out and
 
04:37:40.670 --> 04:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
about and I would just encourage you
 
04:37:42.629 --> 04:37:42.639 align:start position:0%
when you see a project when you see a
 
04:37:44.709 --> 04:37:44.719 align:start position:0%
development take a look at the financing
 
04:37:47.070 --> 04:37:47.080 align:start position:0%
and the odds are one of the banks that
 
04:37:49.150 --> 04:37:49.160 align:start position:0%
has a presence here in New Hampshire did
 
04:37:52.390 --> 04:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
that project but as was mentioned banks
 
04:37:53.750 --> 04:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
are subject to the community
 
04:37:56.551 --> 04:37:56.561 align:start position:0%
reinvestment act and they are regularly
 
04:37:58.551 --> 04:37:58.561 align:start position:0%
examined every few years on their
 
04:38:00.750 --> 04:38:00.760 align:start position:0%
compliance and what does that mean that
 
04:38:02.869 --> 04:38:02.879 align:start position:0%
means the bank is expected to meet the
 
04:38:04.990 --> 04:38:05.000 align:start position:0%
needs of the communities which it serves
 
04:38:07.470 --> 04:38:07.480 align:start position:0%
through Investments services and lending
 
04:38:09.390 --> 04:38:09.400 align:start position:0%
so and this is required in each market
 
04:38:11.990 --> 04:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
so if there's out of State Banks um but
 
04:38:13.470 --> 04:38:13.480 align:start position:0%
they they are in New Hampshire they have
 
04:38:14.869 --> 04:38:14.879 align:start position:0%
a presence in New Hampshire they're
 
04:38:17.470 --> 04:38:17.480 align:start position:0%
expected to comply in New Hampshire each
 
04:38:19.551 --> 04:38:19.561 align:start position:0%
Bank receives a rating which is public
 
04:38:21.470 --> 04:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
it's either outstanding satisfactory
 
04:38:23.709 --> 04:38:23.719 align:start position:0%
needs to improve or substantial
 
04:38:25.869 --> 04:38:25.879 align:start position:0%
non-compliance and I want to emphasize
 
04:38:28.510 --> 04:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
this point each bank that has a rating
 
04:38:31.189 --> 04:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
lower than satisfactory they must cure
 
04:38:33.429 --> 04:38:33.439 align:start position:0%
that rating in a certain period of time
 
04:38:35.510 --> 04:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
if they failed to do so there will be
 
04:38:38.189 --> 04:38:38.199 align:start position:0%
corrective action there is no tolerance
 
04:38:41.629 --> 04:38:41.639 align:start position:0%
for failing to comply with the CRA
 
04:38:43.189 --> 04:38:43.199 align:start position:0%
all banks all of our member banks
 
04:38:44.949 --> 04:38:44.959 align:start position:0%
located here have either outstanding or
 
04:38:47.230 --> 04:38:47.240 align:start position:0%
satisfactory ratings and it shows that
 
04:38:49.869 --> 04:38:49.879 align:start position:0%
they meet the spirit of the CRA and they
 
04:38:51.990 --> 04:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
support the communities they serve um
 
04:38:53.510 --> 04:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
and here's just really quickly this is
 
04:38:57.109 --> 04:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
how the FDIC explains the CRA the law is
 
04:38:59.109 --> 04:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
intended to encourage depository
 
04:39:01.070 --> 04:39:01.080 align:start position:0%
institutions to help meet the credit
 
04:39:02.830 --> 04:39:02.840 align:start position:0%
needs of the communities in which they
 
04:39:04.789 --> 04:39:04.799 align:start position:0%
operate including low and moderate
 
04:39:06.429 --> 04:39:06.439 align:start position:0%
income neighborhoods consistent with
 
04:39:08.189 --> 04:39:08.199 align:start position:0%
safe and sound banking
 
04:39:10.709 --> 04:39:10.719 align:start position:0%
operations additionally New Hampshire
 
04:39:13.150 --> 04:39:13.160 align:start position:0%
laws require that out of-state banks
 
04:39:15.429 --> 04:39:15.439 align:start position:0%
that do business with public funds they
 
04:39:17.269 --> 04:39:17.279 align:start position:0%
have to have a presence here they have
 
04:39:19.551 --> 04:39:19.561 align:start position:0%
to pay taxes here and they have to lend
 
04:39:21.590 --> 04:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
into the community approximately as much
 
04:39:22.910 --> 04:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
as they take in
 
04:39:25.869 --> 04:39:25.879 align:start position:0%
deposits finally um many of you are
 
04:39:27.070 --> 04:39:27.080 align:start position:0%
familiar with the small business
 
04:39:29.670 --> 04:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
administration and they put out regular
 
04:39:31.670 --> 04:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
reports on their loan activity for their
 
04:39:34.029 --> 04:39:34.039 align:start position:0%
products um and we've included a few of
 
04:39:35.910 --> 04:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
those reports and you will you can look
 
04:39:37.670 --> 04:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
at those I encourage you to do so and
 
04:39:39.590 --> 04:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
you'll see that the Lion Share of those
 
04:39:42.190 --> 04:39:42.200 align:start position:0%
loans are done by banks with presence
 
04:39:44.510 --> 04:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
here um so I think we're going to hear a
 
04:39:45.948 --> 04:39:45.958 align:start position:0%
little bit more about rates today so
 
04:39:48.270 --> 04:39:48.280 align:start position:0%
just really quickly I want to mention um
 
04:39:50.150 --> 04:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
we've got a handout that shows the bank
 
04:39:52.670 --> 04:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
versus PP rate if you look back five
 
04:39:55.430 --> 04:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
years the 30-day treasury is very close
 
04:39:58.030 --> 04:39:58.040 align:start position:0%
in some cases higher um I would love to
 
04:39:59.550 --> 04:39:59.560 align:start position:0%
be able to list every bank and what
 
04:40:01.550 --> 04:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
their rates are but we're not allowed to
 
04:40:02.990 --> 04:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
do that um we can get in trouble for
 
04:40:05.190 --> 04:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
doing so so we use the 30-day treasury
 
04:40:07.628 --> 04:40:07.638 align:start position:0%
as a guide and the 30-day treasury um is
 
04:40:09.390 --> 04:40:09.400 align:start position:0%
something Banks use to be an indicator
 
04:40:11.910 --> 04:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
for how to set their rates um um during
 
04:40:13.590 --> 04:40:13.600 align:start position:0%
the Senate hearing the treasurer also
 
04:40:15.310 --> 04:40:15.320 align:start position:0%
testified that she's getting as much as
 
04:40:20.110 --> 04:40:20.120 align:start position:0%
5.25% at of Bank in 2020 when the pp
 
04:40:23.030 --> 04:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
rate was close to 0% the asset manager
 
04:40:26.270 --> 04:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
started waving its fees to show positive
 
04:40:28.628 --> 04:40:28.638 align:start position:0%
returns and that's also included a copy
 
04:40:30.948 --> 04:40:30.958 align:start position:0%
of that is in your packet we've heard
 
04:40:33.150 --> 04:40:33.160 align:start position:0%
about how the pool creates competition
 
04:40:34.708 --> 04:40:34.718 align:start position:0%
and that's why banks are able to offer
 
04:40:37.190 --> 04:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
the rates that they do um as was pointed
 
04:40:39.030 --> 04:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
out though in Maine and Vermont neither
 
04:40:40.350 --> 04:40:40.360 align:start position:0%
state has a pool and they have
 
04:40:42.990 --> 04:40:43.000 align:start position:0%
competitive rates there
 
04:40:44.430 --> 04:40:44.440 align:start position:0%
um I do want to talk a little bit about
 
04:40:46.310 --> 04:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
safety um we've heard this elsewhere you
 
04:40:48.910 --> 04:40:48.920 align:start position:0%
may hear it later today um you'll hear
 
04:40:51.830 --> 04:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
that petp offers AAA rated Investments
 
04:40:54.230 --> 04:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
and they've never lost money in 31 years
 
04:40:55.628 --> 04:40:55.638 align:start position:0%
and we are not arguing that these are
 
04:40:58.628 --> 04:40:58.638 align:start position:0%
not safe Investments um but what we are
 
04:41:01.788 --> 04:41:01.798 align:start position:0%
arguing is pup funds are not insured
 
04:41:04.350 --> 04:41:04.360 align:start position:0%
they are not secured and they are not
 
04:41:06.350 --> 04:41:06.360 align:start position:0%
collateralized Banks however through
 
04:41:09.470 --> 04:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
FDIC Insurance um taxpayer funds are
 
04:41:10.750 --> 04:41:10.760 align:start position:0%
backed by the full faith and credit of
 
04:41:13.628 --> 04:41:13.638 align:start position:0%
the US government up to 250 and Beyond
 
04:41:15.430 --> 04:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
um and bank secure funds and Banks
 
04:41:18.788 --> 04:41:18.798 align:start position:0%
collateralized funds while pip funds are
 
04:41:22.430 --> 04:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
safe Investments there is still risk in
 
04:41:25.150 --> 04:41:25.160 align:start position:0%
1994 Orange County California they filed
 
04:41:27.788 --> 04:41:27.798 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy after its pool experien large
 
04:41:31.868 --> 04:41:31.878 align:start position:0%
losses in 2007 a Florida pool which was
 
04:41:33.868 --> 04:41:33.878 align:start position:0%
the largest pool in the country at that
 
04:41:36.070 --> 04:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
time had about a th000 participants and
 
04:41:38.948 --> 04:41:38.958 align:start position:0%
27 billion in assets they had to pause
 
04:41:40.830 --> 04:41:40.840 align:start position:0%
redemptions due to a high volume of
 
04:41:42.590 --> 04:41:42.600 align:start position:0%
requests exhausting the liquid assets
 
04:41:45.350 --> 04:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
during the financial CR crisis their
 
04:41:48.310 --> 04:41:48.320 align:start position:0%
pool was created into two funds fund a
 
04:41:50.110 --> 04:41:50.120 align:start position:0%
allowed redemptions but put a limit on
 
04:41:53.070 --> 04:41:53.080 align:start position:0%
the request and participants faced a 2%
 
04:41:54.788 --> 04:41:54.798 align:start position:0%
penalty if the reduction I'm sorry if
 
04:41:57.310 --> 04:41:57.320 align:start position:0%
the Redemption was above that limit fund
 
04:41:59.590 --> 04:41:59.600 align:start position:0%
B did not allow withdrawals until the
 
04:42:01.628 --> 04:42:01.638 align:start position:0%
assets matured and the money was
 
04:42:03.910 --> 04:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
eventually paid back by
 
04:42:06.868 --> 04:42:06.878 align:start position:0%
2014 uh more recently in 2015 a similar
 
04:42:09.110 --> 04:42:09.120 align:start position:0%
government pool in Chicago experienced
 
04:42:11.550 --> 04:42:11.560 align:start position:0%
losses um you were probably a going to
 
04:42:13.430 --> 04:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
hear and we've heard elsewhere that
 
04:42:15.708 --> 04:42:15.718 align:start position:0%
there are only three AAA rated banks in
 
04:42:18.230 --> 04:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um but we'd like to point
 
04:42:19.750 --> 04:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
out that this is really an apples and
 
04:42:22.550 --> 04:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
oranges comparison ratings are only
 
04:42:24.590 --> 04:42:24.600 align:start position:0%
required for debt issuances that are
 
04:42:27.030 --> 04:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
widely traded where the risk uh sorry
 
04:42:29.150 --> 04:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
where the risk of loss is present
 
04:42:30.750 --> 04:42:30.760 align:start position:0%
generally speaking Community Banks do
 
04:42:32.990 --> 04:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
not issue these type of debt Securities
 
04:42:36.190 --> 04:42:36.200 align:start position:0%
therefore most are not rated and as
 
04:42:37.390 --> 04:42:37.400 align:start position:0%
we've said earlier Banks provide
 
04:42:38.868 --> 04:42:38.878 align:start position:0%
insurance and collateralization which
 
04:42:41.628 --> 04:42:41.638 align:start position:0%
protect taxpayer funds uh you may be
 
04:42:43.590 --> 04:42:43.600 align:start position:0%
familiar with the state's annual
 
04:42:45.910 --> 04:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
comprehensive financial report and in
 
04:42:48.470 --> 04:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
that document it explains that all banks
 
04:42:50.830 --> 04:42:50.840 align:start position:0%
where the state has active accounts are
 
04:42:52.708 --> 04:42:52.718 align:start position:0%
monitored on the Financial Health using
 
04:42:55.470 --> 04:42:55.480 align:start position:0%
the Vera Bank rating system um in which
 
04:42:57.830 --> 04:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
verab bank is A Bank rating firm and the
 
04:42:59.628 --> 04:42:59.638 align:start position:0%
institution is expected to have the
 
04:43:02.070 --> 04:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
highest rating of green if you look at
 
04:43:04.190 --> 04:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
the verbank ratings for banks in New
 
04:43:07.708 --> 04:43:07.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you will find that 37 are
 
04:43:10.550 --> 04:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
green um finally I'd like to just point
 
04:43:13.070 --> 04:43:13.080 align:start position:0%
out um um that there are there are those
 
04:43:15.190 --> 04:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
that say that this legislation will end
 
04:43:18.190 --> 04:43:18.200 align:start position:0%
the pool um and this legislation is not
 
04:43:19.948 --> 04:43:19.958 align:start position:0%
intended for that it's intended to level
 
04:43:22.470 --> 04:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
the playing field um it was amended in
 
04:43:24.788 --> 04:43:24.798 align:start position:0%
the Senate so it would not impact the
 
04:43:26.110 --> 04:43:26.120 align:start position:0%
relationship the state has with the
 
04:43:28.350 --> 04:43:28.360 align:start position:0%
current fund manager and as was
 
04:43:30.750 --> 04:43:30.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier there are two fund uh
 
04:43:32.670 --> 04:43:32.680 align:start position:0%
management companies around the country
 
04:43:34.310 --> 04:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
that have expressed interest in this
 
04:43:36.750 --> 04:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
legislation that they are monitoring it
 
04:43:38.868 --> 04:43:38.878 align:start position:0%
and we understand um at least for one of
 
04:43:40.628 --> 04:43:40.638 align:start position:0%
those companies their model is to
 
04:43:42.550 --> 04:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
partner with with banks and so they
 
04:43:44.590 --> 04:43:44.600 align:start position:0%
would take public funds and place them
 
04:43:49.910 --> 04:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
in local banks um and um and yes did you
 
04:43:51.230 --> 04:43:51.240 align:start position:0%
have a question Mr chair is that my
 
04:43:55.670 --> 04:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
signal to I'm hoping since at this
 
04:43:58.670 --> 04:43:58.680 align:start position:0%
moment I will open the hearing on Senate
 
04:43:58.680 --> 04:43:59.670 align:start position:0%
moment I will open the hearing on Senate
Bill

04:43:59.670 --> 04:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
04:44:04.270 --> 04:44:04.280 align:start position:0%
499 and recess it till
 
04:44:06.670 --> 04:44:06.680 align:start position:0%
3:30 so those of you that have come in
 
04:44:10.110 --> 04:44:10.120 align:start position:0%
here for Senate Bill 499 we won't get to
 
04:44:14.830 --> 04:44:14.840 align:start position:0%
that till at least 330 i' also since you
 
04:44:17.110 --> 04:44:17.120 align:start position:0%
hopefully have the big picture yes as
 
04:44:19.230 --> 04:44:19.240 align:start position:0%
the banking Association I've never heard
 
04:44:22.708 --> 04:44:22.718 align:start position:0%
the figure I'm always seeking yes to add
 
04:44:25.510 --> 04:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
650 million to the loans that are
 
04:44:27.670 --> 04:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
already being made yes what are what is
 
04:44:29.788 --> 04:44:29.798 align:start position:0%
the size of the loan already being made
 
04:44:31.788 --> 04:44:31.798 align:start position:0%
are you doubling the available funds are
 
04:44:34.628 --> 04:44:34.638 align:start position:0%
you adding 10% are you tripling it this
 
04:44:37.310 --> 04:44:37.320 align:start position:0%
these all have a big effect on what the
 
04:44:39.670 --> 04:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
what would happen so what is the present
 
04:44:42.150 --> 04:44:42.160 align:start position:0%
loan from all the banks now yes
 
04:44:43.390 --> 04:44:43.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely do you want to do that or do
 
04:44:45.070 --> 04:44:45.080 align:start position:0%
you so I don't have the exact number I
 
04:44:46.310 --> 04:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
don't want to pretend I know this number
 
04:44:47.550 --> 04:44:47.560 align:start position:0%
off top of my head but roughly there's
 
04:44:49.590 --> 04:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
$50 billion worth of deposits in the
 
04:44:51.708 --> 04:44:51.718 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and if I would
 
04:44:53.868 --> 04:44:53.878 align:start position:0%
say for certainly for main Charter Banks
 
04:44:55.948 --> 04:44:55.958 align:start position:0%
we're loaned up at 90% National Banks
 
04:44:57.670 --> 04:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
not as much so I'm gon to say it's a
 
04:45:00.510 --> 04:45:00.520 align:start position:0%
range between 40 and 44 million billion
 
04:45:02.350 --> 04:45:02.360 align:start position:0%
dollars in loans okay that that's
 
04:45:04.990 --> 04:45:05.000 align:start position:0%
significant because I don't want this
 
04:45:08.750 --> 04:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
600 million overcoming the market that
 
04:45:11.030 --> 04:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
it will not happen so you know we're
 
04:45:12.910 --> 04:45:12.920 align:start position:0%
maybe risks would be taken that wouldn't
 
04:45:14.430 --> 04:45:14.440 align:start position:0%
be otherwise thank you very much for
 
04:45:17.110 --> 04:45:17.120 align:start position:0%
that figure uh and do you have further
 
04:45:20.190 --> 04:45:20.200 align:start position:0%
Mr Logan if uh for brevity for time I
 
04:45:21.788 --> 04:45:21.798 align:start position:0%
would just like to answer a few
 
04:45:24.230 --> 04:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
statements that have been said that um
 
04:45:25.910 --> 04:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
will probably come out in this so one of
 
04:45:28.470 --> 04:45:28.480 align:start position:0%
the comments um about this bill and the
 
04:45:30.190 --> 04:45:30.200 align:start position:0%
concern is about the rate and we've
 
04:45:32.830 --> 04:45:32.840 align:start position:0%
heard Brian and and uh talk about the
 
04:45:34.470 --> 04:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
rate and I won't get into a lot of facts
 
04:45:36.708 --> 04:45:36.718 align:start position:0%
but I did work at a Maine Community Bank
 
04:45:38.390 --> 04:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
for 15 years before I was in New
 
04:45:40.990 --> 04:45:41.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I can assure you that the
 
04:45:42.868 --> 04:45:42.878 align:start position:0%
competition in Maine for municipal
 
04:45:45.030 --> 04:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
deposits is very strong and the rates
 
04:45:48.350 --> 04:45:48.360 align:start position:0%
are very similar um secondly I think
 
04:45:51.310 --> 04:45:51.320 align:start position:0%
when we look at what Brian's uh study
 
04:45:53.708 --> 04:45:53.718 align:start position:0%
said I thought it was logical that if we
 
04:45:55.310 --> 04:45:55.320 align:start position:0%
invested our dollars in New Hampshire it
 
04:45:56.470 --> 04:45:56.480 align:start position:0%
was going to provide a greater return
 
04:45:58.788 --> 04:45:58.798 align:start position:0%
for our communities we commissioned a
 
04:46:00.430 --> 04:46:00.440 align:start position:0%
study so we could prove that fact for
 
04:46:02.910 --> 04:46:02.920 align:start position:0%
someone just to say they think the facts
 
04:46:04.788 --> 04:46:04.798 align:start position:0%
and figures around it are not logical
 
04:46:06.910 --> 04:46:06.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure is a is a just
 
04:46:10.350 --> 04:46:10.360 align:start position:0%
response thank um two two other op so
 
04:46:11.708 --> 04:46:11.718 align:start position:0%
open market maret so there's there's
 
04:46:13.390 --> 04:46:13.400 align:start position:0%
questions about whether or not this is
 
04:46:15.590 --> 04:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh not allowing a free market or open
 
04:46:19.430 --> 04:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
market Senate Bill 102 in 1992 built
 
04:46:21.990 --> 04:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
this fund that is not an open market so
 
04:46:23.510 --> 04:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
initially it was built by the government
 
04:46:25.470 --> 04:46:25.480 align:start position:0%
so if the fund wasn't there it would be
 
04:46:28.350 --> 04:46:28.360 align:start position:0%
an open market and lastly I would just
 
04:46:31.750 --> 04:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh um talk about CRA lots of questions
 
04:46:32.990 --> 04:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
about whether or not the dollars will be
 
04:46:35.390 --> 04:46:35.400 align:start position:0%
spent here in New Hampshire I'm going to
 
04:46:36.708 --> 04:46:36.718 align:start position:0%
extrapolate banking New Hampshire
 
04:46:39.548 --> 04:46:39.558 align:start position:0%
numbers for CRA if I extrapolate what we
 
04:46:42.310 --> 04:46:42.320 align:start position:0%
have for business loans donations and
 
04:46:44.830 --> 04:46:44.840 align:start position:0%
volunteer hours over the last two years
 
04:46:47.190 --> 04:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
we would do $1.1 billion in commercial
 
04:46:50.470 --> 04:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
loans we'd have 13 million in donations
 
04:46:54.150 --> 04:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
and at 33,000 volunteer hours so my
 
04:46:56.110 --> 04:46:56.120 align:start position:0%
question to you would be what has pfm
 
04:46:58.070 --> 04:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
done for our
 
04:47:01.070 --> 04:47:01.080 align:start position:0%
communities thank you questions from the
 
04:47:03.470 --> 04:47:03.480 align:start position:0%
committee representative papich Mueller
 
04:47:05.510 --> 04:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'll be very
 
04:47:09.030 --> 04:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
brief what um are you saying right now
 
04:47:11.788 --> 04:47:11.798 align:start position:0%
that uh you have uh
 
04:47:13.230 --> 04:47:13.240 align:start position:0%
high quality loans that you'd like to
 
04:47:14.830 --> 04:47:14.840 align:start position:0%
make and you do not have the funds to
 
04:47:17.590 --> 04:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
make I think today with where Community
 
04:47:19.548 --> 04:47:19.558 align:start position:0%
Banks are with the leverage ratios loan
 
04:47:21.910 --> 04:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
deposit ratios people have to decide how
 
04:47:24.030 --> 04:47:24.040 align:start position:0%
to use their resources A bank's raw
 
04:47:26.750 --> 04:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
materials are deposits we take our raw
 
04:47:28.150 --> 04:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
materials to make loans right for
 
04:47:29.990 --> 04:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
manufacturing company so when we have
 
04:47:32.350 --> 04:47:32.360 align:start position:0%
fewer deposits it's harder to make loans
 
04:47:34.990 --> 04:47:35.000 align:start position:0%
so it it forces you to make more choices
 
04:47:38.628 --> 04:47:38.638 align:start position:0%
so at this point you are saying that you
 
04:47:41.390 --> 04:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
would need more Capital to
 
04:47:44.990 --> 04:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
make more loans of the same quality that
 
04:47:46.430 --> 04:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
you are making today or not I'm just
 
04:47:47.910 --> 04:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
trying to understand I I can only
 
04:47:50.390 --> 04:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
comment on Bing New Hampshire yes on you
 
04:47:51.628 --> 04:47:51.638 align:start position:0%
for Bank in New Hampshire yes I can make
 
04:47:53.868 --> 04:47:53.878 align:start position:0%
more loans at the same quality and not
 
04:47:57.628 --> 04:47:57.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:00.190 --> 04:48:00.200 align:start position:0%
bank represent hacken
 
04:48:03.470 --> 04:48:03.480 align:start position:0%
Phillips thank you Mr chair um thank you
 
04:48:06.270 --> 04:48:06.280 align:start position:0%
both for taking my question um first I
 
04:48:08.070 --> 04:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
just wanted to say as someone who sat
 
04:48:10.150 --> 04:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
inside a financial institutions
 
04:48:12.788 --> 04:48:12.798 align:start position:0%
boardroom during the 0809 financial
 
04:48:15.590 --> 04:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
crisis in Chicago I can tell you the
 
04:48:17.110 --> 04:48:17.120 align:start position:0%
importantance importance of the
 
04:48:19.628 --> 04:48:19.638 align:start position:0%
community reinvestment Act and the real
 
04:48:21.708 --> 04:48:21.718 align:start position:0%
positive impact it can make on a
 
04:48:24.150 --> 04:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
community um so I appreciate all the
 
04:48:26.788 --> 04:48:26.798 align:start position:0%
hard work that your lending institutions
 
04:48:27.910 --> 04:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
and member
 
04:48:30.590 --> 04:48:30.600 align:start position:0%
organizations um contribute to our state
 
04:48:33.190 --> 04:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
um through that work um I was wondering
 
04:48:34.430 --> 04:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
if you could just take a moment to
 
04:48:37.070 --> 04:48:37.080 align:start position:0%
explain the IC in a little bit more
 
04:48:39.350 --> 04:48:39.360 align:start position:0%
detail to help uh folks here on the
 
04:48:41.230 --> 04:48:41.240 align:start position:0%
committee who may have some concerned
 
04:48:45.390 --> 04:48:45.400 align:start position:0%
about um potential risk-taking above the
 
04:48:50.750 --> 04:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:53.350 --> 04:48:53.360 align:start position:0%
limits so IC is a program that was
 
04:48:55.750 --> 04:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
developed I'm guessing 20 years ago give
 
04:48:57.910 --> 04:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
or take it wasn't around in
 
04:49:00.310 --> 04:49:00.320 align:start position:0%
1990 and I I'll break it down to real
 
04:49:02.390 --> 04:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
simple terms so FDIC insurance is
 
04:49:04.948 --> 04:49:04.958 align:start position:0%
250,000 so if there was a million dollar
 
04:49:04.958 --> 04:49:06.548 align:start position:0%
250,000 so if there was a million dollar
deposit

04:49:06.548 --> 04:49:06.558 align:start position:0%
deposit
 
04:49:09.070 --> 04:49:09.080 align:start position:0%
$750,000 or three chunks of 250 would be
 
04:49:10.750 --> 04:49:10.760 align:start position:0%
shipped out to other banks that have
 
04:49:13.788 --> 04:49:13.798 align:start position:0%
have FDIC insurance that they would then
 
04:49:14.910 --> 04:49:14.920 align:start position:0%
send back
 
04:49:17.110 --> 04:49:17.120 align:start position:0%
$750,000 to Bank of New Hampshire so
 
04:49:18.230 --> 04:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
Bank of New Hampshire would still have
 
04:49:20.150 --> 04:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
the millionar but it would have full
 
04:49:21.788 --> 04:49:21.798 align:start position:0%
insurance because it would be split up
 
04:49:23.548 --> 04:49:23.558 align:start position:0%
amongst four different banks I won't go
 
04:49:25.110 --> 04:49:25.120 align:start position:0%
into a lot of detail but if that if that
 
04:49:26.910 --> 04:49:26.920 align:start position:0%
suffices for
 
04:49:29.110 --> 04:49:29.120 align:start position:0%
time further questions from Committee
 
04:49:31.030 --> 04:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
Member representative Edwards thank you
 
04:49:33.910 --> 04:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I'm I'm I'm looking at the bill
 
04:49:35.750 --> 04:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
and the and the bill basically would
 
04:49:37.910 --> 04:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
mandate that all funds held by the
 
04:49:39.830 --> 04:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
public deposit investment pool be
 
04:49:41.628 --> 04:49:41.638 align:start position:0%
invested or depos deposited within the
 
04:49:45.110 --> 04:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
state of of New Hampshire and that all
 
04:49:47.310 --> 04:49:47.320 align:start position:0%
funds held by a public deposit
 
04:49:50.110 --> 04:49:50.120 align:start position:0%
investment pool are insured or
 
04:49:52.190 --> 04:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
collateralized the second part of that
 
04:49:54.830 --> 04:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
makes eminent sense to me insurance and
 
04:49:59.030 --> 04:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
collateralization makes perfect sense um
 
04:50:01.430 --> 04:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
would would would this bill still be
 
04:50:03.750 --> 04:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
effective and useful in your opinion if
 
04:50:06.590 --> 04:50:06.600 align:start position:0%
we struck the requirement that
 
04:50:08.750 --> 04:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
everything be invested or deposited
 
04:50:10.788 --> 04:50:10.798 align:start position:0%
within the state of New Hampshire that
 
04:50:14.310 --> 04:50:14.320 align:start position:0%
that's what sounds anti-competitive to
 
04:50:17.670 --> 04:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
me yeah um I I mean I would say that um
 
04:50:19.430 --> 04:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
I I don't think we see it as as being
 
04:50:20.990 --> 04:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
anti-competitive but understand that
 
04:50:23.230 --> 04:50:23.240 align:start position:0%
your perspective representative um the
 
04:50:25.230 --> 04:50:25.240 align:start position:0%
collateralization piece is really the
 
04:50:27.430 --> 04:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
one that contributes to the unlevel
 
04:50:30.510 --> 04:50:30.520 align:start position:0%
playing field um I think it would be
 
04:50:32.590 --> 04:50:32.600 align:start position:0%
preferred to see some of the funds stay
 
04:50:34.830 --> 04:50:34.840 align:start position:0%
within New Hampshire um but we
 
04:50:37.190 --> 04:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
understand that um that legislation this
 
04:50:38.910 --> 04:50:38.920 align:start position:0%
legislation is in your possession to do
 
04:50:40.830 --> 04:50:40.840 align:start position:0%
with what you will so um the
 
04:50:42.548 --> 04:50:42.558 align:start position:0%
collateralization is really import
 
04:50:44.470 --> 04:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
important um and of course we'd like to
 
04:50:46.310 --> 04:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
see some funds work in New Hampshire and
 
04:50:48.350 --> 04:50:48.360 align:start position:0%
there are are other models I mentioned
 
04:50:50.708 --> 04:50:50.718 align:start position:0%
one of the fund managers and uh that's
 
04:50:52.190 --> 04:50:52.200 align:start position:0%
interested in this legislation and they
 
04:50:54.070 --> 04:50:54.080 align:start position:0%
have a presence in other states where
 
04:50:56.270 --> 04:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
there is a instate requirement not at
 
04:50:58.990 --> 04:50:59.000 align:start position:0%
100% but there is an instate
 
04:51:01.030 --> 04:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
requirement representative AEL for a
 
04:51:03.070 --> 04:51:03.080 align:start position:0%
question then representative mire yes
 
04:51:04.830 --> 04:51:04.840 align:start position:0%
very quick one um I don't know if you
 
04:51:06.310 --> 04:51:06.320 align:start position:0%
can answer this question and thank you
 
04:51:09.350 --> 04:51:09.360 align:start position:0%
for being here of the uh states in the
 
04:51:12.830 --> 04:51:12.840 align:start position:0%
country that have dips is how many of
 
04:51:14.708 --> 04:51:14.718 align:start position:0%
them would you say restrict the
 
04:51:19.350 --> 04:51:19.360 align:start position:0%
Investments to instate Banks I really I
 
04:51:21.628 --> 04:51:21.638 align:start position:0%
I don't know I couldn't answer that um I
 
04:51:23.030 --> 04:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
know that there are states that have
 
04:51:25.510 --> 04:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
some limitations um a handful I've
 
04:51:27.670 --> 04:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
learned that there is uh New York and
 
04:51:30.190 --> 04:51:30.200 align:start position:0%
Iowa um and my understanding is Indiana
 
04:51:33.230 --> 04:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
they have some requirement to have um a
 
04:51:35.230 --> 04:51:35.240 align:start position:0%
presence with that that the funds have
 
04:51:37.590 --> 04:51:37.600 align:start position:0%
to stay in state um my understanding is
 
04:51:39.350 --> 04:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
that there are also different types of
 
04:51:41.830 --> 04:51:41.840 align:start position:0%
funds meaning there's a prime funds
 
04:51:43.750 --> 04:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
where commercial paper is an acceptable
 
04:51:45.670 --> 04:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
type of investment in other funds and
 
04:51:47.350 --> 04:51:47.360 align:start position:0%
then there are what's known as govy
 
04:51:50.788 --> 04:51:50.798 align:start position:0%
funds um which would be Securities
 
04:51:53.510 --> 04:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
repurchase agreements and and Bank
 
04:51:55.470 --> 04:51:55.480 align:start position:0%
products so there are probably others
 
04:51:57.390 --> 04:51:57.400 align:start position:0%
that can speak better to
 
04:51:59.990 --> 04:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
that represent Maguire for question
 
04:52:02.590 --> 04:52:02.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman you said that when
 
04:52:05.830 --> 04:52:05.840 align:start position:0%
a a dollar is deposited 90 cents gets Lo
 
04:52:08.628 --> 04:52:08.638 align:start position:0%
lent out but my understanding of
 
04:52:10.750 --> 04:52:10.760 align:start position:0%
fractional Reserve banking is is
 
04:52:13.110 --> 04:52:13.120 align:start position:0%
different that that when a dollar is
 
04:52:16.830 --> 04:52:16.840 align:start position:0%
deposited the FED lets Banks loan out $2
 
04:52:19.670 --> 04:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
or $150 or something else isn't that
 
04:52:21.430 --> 04:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
right I I think what you're talking is
 
04:52:23.030 --> 04:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
about the money multiplier that won't be
 
04:52:24.150 --> 04:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be on the bank's balance sheet
 
04:52:25.390 --> 04:52:25.400 align:start position:0%
but the money multiplier would be is
 
04:52:26.750 --> 04:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
once this gets lend out and then that
 
04:52:30.310 --> 04:52:30.320 align:start position:0%
company gets it they then reinvest it no
 
04:52:30.320 --> 04:52:32.110 align:start position:0%
company gets it they then reinvest it no
I'm

04:52:32.110 --> 04:52:32.120 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
04:52:35.270 --> 04:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
sorry I guess I I mean we certainly for
 
04:52:37.830 --> 04:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
a bank the loan deposit ratios are not
 
04:52:41.350 --> 04:52:41.360 align:start position:0%
multiples above 100%
 
04:52:44.868 --> 04:52:44.878 align:start position:0%
thank you and may I follow yeah so I I
 
04:52:47.708 --> 04:52:47.718 align:start position:0%
want to um um push back a little on your
 
04:52:50.350 --> 04:52:50.360 align:start position:0%
answer to representative papovich Müller
 
04:52:53.830 --> 04:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
and that is you're currently lending out
 
04:52:57.910 --> 04:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
say 15 $50 billion some some amount
 
04:53:00.830 --> 04:53:00.840 align:start position:0%
right and presumably those are to the
 
04:53:04.750 --> 04:53:04.760 align:start position:0%
most creditworthy B borrowers and so if
 
04:53:08.070 --> 04:53:08.080 align:start position:0%
you add extra money to be lent out
 
04:53:11.190 --> 04:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't those necessarily go to people
 
04:53:14.190 --> 04:53:14.200 align:start position:0%
that did not qualify for the money
 
04:53:16.150 --> 04:53:16.160 align:start position:0%
you're currently lending out namely the
 
04:53:18.350 --> 04:53:18.360 align:start position:0%
worst borrowers so wouldn't the net
 
04:53:22.670 --> 04:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
effect of this be to um increase the
 
04:53:25.070 --> 04:53:25.080 align:start position:0%
fraction of your loans that are
 
04:53:26.990 --> 04:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
non-performing I I would disagree with
 
04:53:28.628 --> 04:53:28.638 align:start position:0%
that statement because of the fact that
 
04:53:30.150 --> 04:53:30.160 align:start position:0%
there's there's been a limit on deposit
 
04:53:32.310 --> 04:53:32.320 align:start position:0%
so banks have had to make choices over
 
04:53:33.788 --> 04:53:33.798 align:start position:0%
certainly over the past several years as
 
04:53:35.110 --> 04:53:35.120 align:start position:0%
liquidity has gotten tighter in the
 
04:53:38.310 --> 04:53:38.320 align:start position:0%
market so there has been there has been
 
04:53:40.430 --> 04:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
well qualified borrowers that have
 
04:53:42.788 --> 04:53:42.798 align:start position:0%
struggled to get the capital they wanted
 
04:53:43.948 --> 04:53:43.958 align:start position:0%
so I don't believe it's going to
 
04:53:47.788 --> 04:53:47.798 align:start position:0%
Downstream to less worthy
 
04:53:49.670 --> 04:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
borrowers further questions from
 
04:53:51.750 --> 04:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
committee members seeing none thank you
 
04:53:54.470 --> 04:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
very much for your testimony thank you
 
04:53:57.750 --> 04:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
now we're going to hear from many of the
 
04:54:01.750 --> 04:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
opposed people we first call on Chuck
 
04:54:04.510 --> 04:54:04.520 align:start position:0%
Nickerson from New Hampshire Association
 
04:54:04.520 --> 04:54:06.868 align:start position:0%
Nickerson from New Hampshire Association
of

04:54:06.868 --> 04:54:06.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:18.670 --> 04:54:18.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:21.310 --> 04:54:21.320 align:start position:0%
there you gok thank you good afternoon
 
04:54:23.070 --> 04:54:23.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for having me uh my name is
 
04:54:24.788 --> 04:54:24.798 align:start position:0%
Chuck Nickerson I'm the finance instor
 
04:54:27.270 --> 04:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
for rockim County and I'm representing
 
04:54:29.788 --> 04:54:29.798 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Association of
 
04:54:32.830 --> 04:54:32.840 align:start position:0%
counties and I guess uh contrary to what
 
04:54:35.270 --> 04:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
um testimony we've already had so far I
 
04:54:38.110 --> 04:54:38.120 align:start position:0%
would actually disagree that this bill
 
04:54:41.190 --> 04:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
as written to me will indeed mean the
 
04:54:45.590 --> 04:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
end of the PDP the reason is that if I'm
 
04:54:47.910 --> 04:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
investing funds and there's going to be
 
04:54:52.990 --> 04:54:53.000 align:start position:0%
a fee for a fund manager why would I go
 
04:54:57.670 --> 04:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
to the PDP if I'm gonna you know unless
 
04:55:00.708 --> 04:55:00.718 align:start position:0%
I'm going to go to you know you know T
 
04:55:03.070 --> 04:55:03.080 align:start position:0%
bills or whatever I'm just going to put
 
04:55:05.708 --> 04:55:05.718 align:start position:0%
the money directly in the bank so to me
 
04:55:08.230 --> 04:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
this would mean the end of the
 
04:55:11.750 --> 04:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
pool I'm Rockham County we have only a
 
04:55:14.230 --> 04:55:14.240 align:start position:0%
relatively small amount but I can say
 
04:55:16.470 --> 04:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
that if this bill goes through then I'd
 
04:55:17.548 --> 04:55:17.558 align:start position:0%
be recommending to my Board of
 
04:55:20.070 --> 04:55:20.080 align:start position:0%
Commissioners into the treasurer for us
 
04:55:22.628 --> 04:55:22.638 align:start position:0%
to pull our money out and go elsewhere
 
04:55:25.110 --> 04:55:25.120 align:start position:0%
because I have a finary responsibility
 
04:55:28.310 --> 04:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
to my County to my County's taxpayers
 
04:55:29.628 --> 04:55:29.638 align:start position:0%
and just like all the other nine
 
04:55:32.430 --> 04:55:32.440 align:start position:0%
counties do as well so again why would I
 
04:55:34.150 --> 04:55:34.160 align:start position:0%
put money in the pool if it's going to
 
04:55:36.948 --> 04:55:36.958 align:start position:0%
be mean less of a net return versus just
 
04:55:38.670 --> 04:55:38.680 align:start position:0%
going to the bank
 
04:55:42.910 --> 04:55:42.920 align:start position:0%
directly so that's a primary reason why
 
04:55:45.190 --> 04:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
the association with couny is opposed to
 
04:55:48.470 --> 04:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
this also again just from a general you
 
04:55:51.948 --> 04:55:51.958 align:start position:0%
know Fu shary for the county you know
 
04:55:53.548 --> 04:55:53.558 align:start position:0%
this does limit
 
04:55:57.030 --> 04:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
diversification it does and as far as
 
04:55:59.990 --> 04:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
the money's going outside the state I
 
04:56:02.548 --> 04:56:02.558 align:start position:0%
mean I'm using any little B of excess
 
04:56:03.910 --> 04:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
you know return that the count is
 
04:56:07.470 --> 04:56:07.480 align:start position:0%
getting to actually not have to as much
 
04:56:10.590 --> 04:56:10.600 align:start position:0%
raised in taxes so while it's not Direct
 
04:56:12.910 --> 04:56:12.920 align:start position:0%
directly benefiting it cre be said
 
04:56:14.868 --> 04:56:14.878 align:start position:0%
that's not directly benefiting the
 
04:56:16.788 --> 04:56:16.798 align:start position:0%
taxpayers in a way it is because I'm
 
04:56:20.070 --> 04:56:20.080 align:start position:0%
using any B ex return to not ask press
 
04:56:22.548 --> 04:56:22.558 align:start position:0%
much in taxes from the Commissioners
 
04:56:24.110 --> 04:56:24.120 align:start position:0%
from the
 
04:56:26.590 --> 04:56:26.600 align:start position:0%
delegation so that's you know those are
 
04:56:28.270 --> 04:56:28.280 align:start position:0%
key points and again just from the
 
04:56:30.190 --> 04:56:30.200 align:start position:0%
standpoint of diversification that's
 
04:56:33.910 --> 04:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
always a good rule if you can but this
 
04:56:36.670 --> 04:56:36.680 align:start position:0%
again takes out fully one option that is
 
04:56:39.230 --> 04:56:39.240 align:start position:0%
currently available to the counties to
 
04:56:41.390 --> 04:56:41.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities I know for akam County
 
04:56:44.470 --> 04:56:44.480 align:start position:0%
alone it'd be you know it is a less
 
04:56:47.230 --> 04:56:47.240 align:start position:0%
lesser rate of return it is as far as if
 
04:56:49.830 --> 04:56:49.840 align:start position:0%
it was fully in Banks versus the current
 
04:56:53.910 --> 04:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
PF rate uh for our 2 million roughly
 
04:56:56.270 --> 04:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
investment it'd mean like $40,000 annual
 
04:56:58.310 --> 04:56:58.320 align:start position:0%
decrease from when I was able to compare
 
04:57:01.070 --> 04:57:01.080 align:start position:0%
to the existing regular depository rates
 
04:57:03.350 --> 04:57:03.360 align:start position:0%
that we have uh currently or at least
 
04:57:05.230 --> 04:57:05.240 align:start position:0%
During the period of time that I
 
04:57:07.030 --> 04:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
analyzed this for the last year and a
 
04:57:10.310 --> 04:57:10.320 align:start position:0%
half so those are the primary reasons
 
04:57:12.270 --> 04:57:12.280 align:start position:0%
why uh the Hampshire Association of
 
04:57:15.270 --> 04:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
counties is against this uh bill and I
 
04:57:17.548 --> 04:57:17.558 align:start position:0%
welcome any questions questions from
 
04:57:19.868 --> 04:57:19.878 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
04:57:21.910 --> 04:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney thank you Mr
 
04:57:23.670 --> 04:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for being here it was
 
04:57:26.030 --> 04:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
suggested an amendment to this bill that
 
04:57:29.548 --> 04:57:29.558 align:start position:0%
the portion regarding being within New
 
04:57:31.910 --> 04:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire be removed but the rest of
 
04:57:33.990 --> 04:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
that sentence remain would the New
 
04:57:36.190 --> 04:57:36.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of counties
 
04:57:38.868 --> 04:57:38.878 align:start position:0%
support that Amendment again it comes
 
04:57:42.708 --> 04:57:42.718 align:start position:0%
down to if we're being restricted again
 
04:57:44.670 --> 04:57:44.680 align:start position:0%
diversification wise if it's going to
 
04:57:47.868 --> 04:57:47.878 align:start position:0%
have to go into Banks per se because I
 
04:57:50.590 --> 04:57:50.600 align:start position:0%
believe it still basically says banks
 
04:57:52.670 --> 04:57:52.680 align:start position:0%
that if it's going to mean less of a
 
04:57:54.868 --> 04:57:54.878 align:start position:0%
return and I'm paying a fee basically to
 
04:57:56.430 --> 04:57:56.440 align:start position:0%
a middle person I'm going to pull the
 
04:57:59.670 --> 04:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
money out so not necessarily would that
 
04:58:01.868 --> 04:58:01.878 align:start position:0%
make enough of a
 
04:58:04.910 --> 04:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
difference thank you representative Papa
 
04:58:06.910 --> 04:58:06.920 align:start position:0%
I'm a bit confused so I want to clarify
 
04:58:08.708 --> 04:58:08.718 align:start position:0%
the previous question the question was
 
04:58:10.670 --> 04:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
about whether the only only thing that
 
04:58:13.070 --> 04:58:13.080 align:start position:0%
the bill does says that funds have to be
 
04:58:15.868 --> 04:58:15.878 align:start position:0%
insured or collateralized nothing else
 
04:58:18.110 --> 04:58:18.120 align:start position:0%
would you then still be opposed well the
 
04:58:21.470 --> 04:58:21.480 align:start position:0%
way that almost implies investment in
 
04:58:23.830 --> 04:58:23.840 align:start position:0%
banks that almost impli as far as being
 
04:58:25.830 --> 04:58:25.840 align:start position:0%
fully collateralized that almost implies
 
04:58:28.788 --> 04:58:28.798 align:start position:0%
invest insured or collateralized there
 
04:58:30.670 --> 04:58:30.680 align:start position:0%
are ways to guarantee the you know
 
04:58:32.390 --> 04:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
basically there would be a small cost
 
04:58:33.948 --> 04:58:33.958 align:start position:0%
involved but you would have a lesser
 
04:58:36.230 --> 04:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
risk of losing funds in the event of a
 
04:58:39.350 --> 04:58:39.360 align:start position:0%
meltdown again is that just by just that
 
04:58:40.830 --> 04:58:40.840 align:start position:0%
by itself something that you would
 
04:58:43.830 --> 04:58:43.840 align:start position:0%
oppose or not it would be a again it' be
 
04:58:45.910 --> 04:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's it's enough I mean
 
04:58:48.230 --> 04:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
thank you and one thing I would like to
 
04:58:51.670 --> 04:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
say as well if I could um is that as far
 
04:58:53.750 --> 04:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
as you know there're being risk as far
 
04:58:56.150 --> 04:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
as yes the pp Investments right now
 
04:58:57.350 --> 04:58:57.360 align:start position:0%
obviously they're not collateralized
 
04:58:58.350 --> 04:58:58.360 align:start position:0%
just by the nature of what the
 
04:59:01.390 --> 04:59:01.400 align:start position:0%
Investments are however to my knowledge
 
04:59:04.070 --> 04:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
there has not been an issue with any
 
04:59:07.948 --> 04:59:07.958 align:start position:0%
town city county having issues
 
04:59:10.350 --> 04:59:10.360 align:start position:0%
withdrawing their funds as they have
 
04:59:12.390 --> 04:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
required or not required have requested
 
04:59:14.750 --> 04:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
of the pool that's my understanding
 
04:59:16.830 --> 04:59:16.840 align:start position:0%
since its
 
04:59:19.390 --> 04:59:19.400 align:start position:0%
creation represent hole for a question
 
04:59:21.990 --> 04:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair earlier um the
 
04:59:23.910 --> 04:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
question was asked what if this policy
 
04:59:27.310 --> 04:59:27.320 align:start position:0%
was one that allowed for two concurrent
 
04:59:29.750 --> 04:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
funds that were administered right one
 
04:59:32.230 --> 04:59:32.240 align:start position:0%
that was New Hampshire Centric within
 
04:59:34.948 --> 04:59:34.958 align:start position:0%
and one that was our current traditional
 
04:59:37.868 --> 04:59:37.878 align:start position:0%
fund Administration would you as the
 
04:59:40.830 --> 04:59:40.840 align:start position:0%
Comm the committee sorry the county
 
04:59:43.110 --> 04:59:43.120 align:start position:0%
representative have the same concerns if
 
04:59:45.390 --> 04:59:45.400 align:start position:0%
there were people had the choice which
 
04:59:47.628 --> 04:59:47.638 align:start position:0%
fund to put money into I mean if there
 
04:59:50.548 --> 04:59:50.558 align:start position:0%
was a choice but again if if the
 
04:59:52.470 --> 04:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
allegation is being made that well then
 
04:59:54.628 --> 04:59:54.638 align:start position:0%
that still allows for not to be a fair
 
04:59:56.750 --> 04:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
playing field then we might be back here
 
04:59:59.548 --> 04:59:59.558 align:start position:0%
again with another bill to follow up
 
05:00:02.030 --> 05:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
again request right but if you had a say
 
05:00:04.270 --> 05:00:04.280 align:start position:0%
in how that money was right it it would
 
05:00:06.470 --> 05:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
still allow for the current option yes
 
05:00:09.190 --> 05:00:09.200 align:start position:0%
to invest you know whether it's it's in
 
05:00:10.830 --> 05:00:10.840 align:start position:0%
state or out of state
 
05:00:12.230 --> 05:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
you know whether or not you know not
 
05:00:12.240 --> 05:00:13.070 align:start position:0%
you know whether or not you know not
fully

05:00:13.070 --> 05:00:13.080 align:start position:0%
fully
 
05:00:15.470 --> 05:00:15.480 align:start position:0%
collateralized um so obviously if the an
 
05:00:17.350 --> 05:00:17.360 align:start position:0%
ex the existing option is still
 
05:00:19.390 --> 05:00:19.400 align:start position:0%
available then yes that would have an
 
05:00:21.708 --> 05:00:21.718 align:start position:0%
effect okay I
 
05:00:24.510 --> 05:00:24.520 align:start position:0%
feel thank you further questions from
 
05:00:27.070 --> 05:00:27.080 align:start position:0%

05:00:48.788 --> 05:00:48.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:50.910 --> 05:00:50.920 align:start position:0%
together uh good afternoon Mr chairman
 
05:00:52.708 --> 05:00:52.718 align:start position:0%
and members of Comm it's Mike mlof I'm a
 
05:00:54.390 --> 05:00:54.400 align:start position:0%
lawyer in lobbies and cin with kacha
 
05:00:56.628 --> 05:00:56.638 align:start position:0%
frock who is a director of pfm who was
 
05:00:59.190 --> 05:00:59.200 align:start position:0%
the administrator of the fund uh quick
 
05:01:01.070 --> 05:01:01.080 align:start position:0%
history on the fund the fund was created
 
05:01:04.628 --> 05:01:04.638 align:start position:0%
years ago because cities towns uh
 
05:01:06.750 --> 05:01:06.760 align:start position:0%
trustees and trust funds could not
 
05:01:09.628 --> 05:01:09.638 align:start position:0%
invest in the instruments that being
 
05:01:11.628 --> 05:01:11.638 align:start position:0%
invested Ed by the state or by the en
 
05:01:13.750 --> 05:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system so before
 
05:01:16.590 --> 05:01:16.600 align:start position:0%
the PIP came into position the cities
 
05:01:17.868 --> 05:01:17.878 align:start position:0%
and towns had nowhere to go with the
 
05:01:20.430 --> 05:01:20.440 align:start position:0%
money but to Banks and at that time the
 
05:01:22.750 --> 05:01:22.760 align:start position:0%
banks were faltering and the PIP was put
 
05:01:24.510 --> 05:01:24.520 align:start position:0%
together to help get the cities and
 
05:01:26.230 --> 05:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
towns some opportunities there were
 
05:01:30.110 --> 05:01:30.120 align:start position:0%
240 uh individual investors in the PIP
 
05:01:31.750 --> 05:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
and the thing that I think needs to be
 
05:01:34.270 --> 05:01:34.280 align:start position:0%
remembered is well we're talking about
 
05:01:36.430 --> 05:01:36.440 align:start position:0%
global terms where a Manchester asash
 
05:01:38.270 --> 05:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
can walk into a bank with $20 million
 
05:01:40.868 --> 05:01:40.878 align:start position:0%
and say what kind of a deal can I get
 
05:01:43.548 --> 05:01:43.558 align:start position:0%
Wilton or wolfb or Warner comes in with
 
05:01:44.868 --> 05:01:44.878 align:start position:0%
their 50 or
 
05:01:46.830 --> 05:01:46.840 align:start position:0%
$100,000 and they don't have the same
 
05:01:49.590 --> 05:01:49.600 align:start position:0%
power the public deposit investment pool
 
05:01:51.628 --> 05:01:51.638 align:start position:0%
provides every single investor with the
 
05:01:54.430 --> 05:01:54.440 align:start position:0%
same return the return is available
 
05:01:57.788 --> 05:01:57.798 align:start position:0%
publicly uh and they're shareholders so
 
05:01:59.030 --> 05:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
what we have here is really our own
 
05:02:01.830 --> 05:02:01.840 align:start position:0%
mutual fund created by by this by the
 
05:02:04.910 --> 05:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
legislature uh the shareholders own
 
05:02:07.868 --> 05:02:07.878 align:start position:0%
those Securities the diversification is
 
05:02:10.190 --> 05:02:10.200 align:start position:0%
where the protection comes in uh I'll
 
05:02:11.990 --> 05:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
let ker talk a little bit about the
 
05:02:13.590 --> 05:02:13.600 align:start position:0%
technicalities of the fund but we need
 
05:02:15.590 --> 05:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
to remember it's the small towns and
 
05:02:18.310 --> 05:02:18.320 align:start position:0%
cities the trustees of cemeteries the
 
05:02:20.470 --> 05:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
libraries uh the Water commissions who
 
05:02:22.910 --> 05:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
are putting money to work uh one who
 
05:02:25.390 --> 05:02:25.400 align:start position:0%
need the PIP more than the large cities
 
05:02:26.750 --> 05:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
uh there was some comments about the
 
05:02:29.150 --> 05:02:29.160 align:start position:0%
money's not working New Hampshire if you
 
05:02:31.788 --> 05:02:31.798 align:start position:0%
put $100,000 into the PIP and you pick
 
05:02:33.830 --> 05:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
up 20,000 or five whatever you get in
 
05:02:35.670 --> 05:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
the industry back to your city that
 
05:02:37.708 --> 05:02:37.718 align:start position:0%
money goes right to your town it works
 
05:02:40.070 --> 05:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
directly in the town if you take that
 
05:02:42.070 --> 05:02:42.080 align:start position:0%
money away every dollar that's taken
 
05:02:44.190 --> 05:02:44.200 align:start position:0%
away is a dollar would replaced by
 
05:02:46.750 --> 05:02:46.760 align:start position:0%
property taxes or reduction Services
 
05:02:48.070 --> 05:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
there's no other alternative for the
 
05:02:49.670 --> 05:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
city of town or the trustees of the
 
05:02:51.510 --> 05:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
library or the Water Commission they'll
 
05:02:54.948 --> 05:02:54.958 align:start position:0%
have to reduce Services um there is a a
 
05:02:57.430 --> 05:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
little bit of a uh a myth here about
 
05:02:59.430 --> 05:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
Banks and my wife was a banker for 30
 
05:03:02.628 --> 05:03:02.638 align:start position:0%
years small businesses if you give the
 
05:03:05.708 --> 05:03:05.718 align:start position:0%
bank $600 million or even $60 million
 
05:03:07.030 --> 05:03:07.040 align:start position:0%
there's a process they have to go
 
05:03:08.990 --> 05:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
through to qualify that credit this
 
05:03:11.190 --> 05:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
isn't mean they're going to make loans
 
05:03:13.230 --> 05:03:13.240 align:start position:0%
to uh bad credit they're just not going
 
05:03:17.830 --> 05:03:17.840 align:start position:0%
to get through the system um it's a um
 
05:03:19.750 --> 05:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
situation that in
 
05:03:22.750 --> 05:03:22.760 align:start position:0%
553 there's absolutely no requirement to
 
05:03:26.110 --> 05:03:26.120 align:start position:0%
make those commercial loans or the the
 
05:03:28.670 --> 05:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
retail loans there's no metric in this
 
05:03:31.070 --> 05:03:31.080 align:start position:0%
bill to ever find out what happened
 
05:03:32.548 --> 05:03:32.558 align:start position:0%
there's no reporting back you'll never
 
05:03:35.708 --> 05:03:35.718 align:start position:0%
know what happened and the reality uh of
 
05:03:39.310 --> 05:03:39.320 align:start position:0%
the loss of of return uh measured to the
 
05:03:41.750 --> 05:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
promise of an economic report I think
 
05:03:43.270 --> 05:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
way in the favor of the cities and towns
 
05:03:46.788 --> 05:03:46.798 align:start position:0%
who get the money uh the economic report
 
05:03:49.670 --> 05:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
is intellectually sound it was paid for
 
05:03:51.990 --> 05:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
by the bankers the numbers extrapolate
 
05:03:53.868 --> 05:03:53.878 align:start position:0%
but we'll never know what happened so if
 
05:03:57.270 --> 05:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
you want to put that money out under 553
 
05:03:58.990 --> 05:03:59.000 align:start position:0%
you will as a finance committee have no
 
05:04:01.788 --> 05:04:01.798 align:start position:0%
idea where it went or what happened uh
 
05:04:03.868 --> 05:04:03.878 align:start position:0%
so we think that the bill the pup is
 
05:04:06.948 --> 05:04:06.958 align:start position:0%
done a great job diversification is the
 
05:04:09.310 --> 05:04:09.320 align:start position:0%
safety there was comments about fail
 
05:04:11.510 --> 05:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
pools by the bankers which is very um
 
05:04:13.270 --> 05:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
you know Works in their favor but here
 
05:04:16.150 --> 05:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that pool has never
 
05:04:19.150 --> 05:04:19.160 align:start position:0%
lost one cent even in 2008 and even
 
05:04:20.430 --> 05:04:20.440 align:start position:0%
during the covid crisis where they
 
05:04:22.548 --> 05:04:22.558 align:start position:0%
continue to make returns now I will let
 
05:04:24.670 --> 05:04:24.680 align:start position:0%
kha take over as a director of of the
 
05:04:27.670 --> 05:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
fund uh and give you some of the uh the
 
05:04:31.830 --> 05:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
details and quickly appreciate all right
 
05:04:33.230 --> 05:04:33.240 align:start position:0%
thank you everyone for having me here
 
05:04:36.030 --> 05:04:36.040 align:start position:0%
today so I I just want to answer a
 
05:04:37.868 --> 05:04:37.878 align:start position:0%
couple of questions so pfm Asset
 
05:04:40.708 --> 05:04:40.718 align:start position:0%
Management we're in SEC red registered
 
05:04:43.190 --> 05:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh investment advisor and what that
 
05:04:45.350 --> 05:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
means is is through our contract with
 
05:04:47.830 --> 05:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
the state to manage the New Hampshire
 
05:04:50.070 --> 05:04:50.080 align:start position:0%
Public deposit investment pool we do
 
05:04:52.788 --> 05:04:52.798 align:start position:0%
have a fiduciary uh responsibility to
 
05:04:55.390 --> 05:04:55.400 align:start position:0%
the beneficiaries of the pool um
 
05:04:57.030 --> 05:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
additionally there have been a lot of
 
05:04:59.788 --> 05:04:59.798 align:start position:0%
questions today about collateral and
 
05:05:02.390 --> 05:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
collateral and FDIC insurance as Mr
 
05:05:04.910 --> 05:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
Nickerson was just trying to describe
 
05:05:07.590 --> 05:05:07.600 align:start position:0%
are things that apply to Banks so the
 
05:05:09.270 --> 05:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Public deposit investment
 
05:05:12.948 --> 05:05:12.958 align:start position:0%
pool P dip the pool um it's not a bank
 
05:05:15.270 --> 05:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't operate like a bank uh and it
 
05:05:17.830 --> 05:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be treated like a bank so
 
05:05:20.830 --> 05:05:20.840 align:start position:0%
collateral in the state of New Hampshire
 
05:05:23.190 --> 05:05:23.200 align:start position:0%
can be a variety of things one of those
 
05:05:25.150 --> 05:05:25.160 align:start position:0%
things that collateral can be is a
 
05:05:28.350 --> 05:05:28.360 align:start position:0%
portfolio of Securities when you look at
 
05:05:31.230 --> 05:05:31.240 align:start position:0%
what the pool is investing directly in
 
05:05:34.470 --> 05:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
and so as as Mr mlin just mentioned when
 
05:05:36.910 --> 05:05:36.920 align:start position:0%
you invest a dollar into the pool you
 
05:05:40.030 --> 05:05:40.040 align:start position:0%
become a shareholder and by that way way
 
05:05:43.030 --> 05:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
you directly invest into Securities so
 
05:05:46.110 --> 05:05:46.120 align:start position:0%
the pool itself follows not only state
 
05:05:48.150 --> 05:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
statutes State investment statute but
 
05:05:50.628 --> 05:05:50.638 align:start position:0%
also the investment policy uh that's
 
05:05:53.390 --> 05:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
been established through the banking
 
05:05:54.948 --> 05:05:54.958 align:start position:0%
commissioner originally the state
 
05:05:57.070 --> 05:05:57.080 align:start position:0%
treasurer currently and an advisory
 
05:05:58.830 --> 05:05:58.840 align:start position:0%
committee so all of those folks have
 
05:06:01.190 --> 05:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
input on what the fund can actually
 
05:06:04.310 --> 05:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
invest in so what those include are all
 
05:06:06.750 --> 05:06:06.760 align:start position:0%
the same Securities virtually the same
 
05:06:09.350 --> 05:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
Securities that the banks can today post
 
05:06:12.070 --> 05:06:12.080 align:start position:0%
the collateral for the account uh so
 
05:06:13.948 --> 05:06:13.958 align:start position:0%
when you're looking at it from a risk
 
05:06:16.270 --> 05:06:16.280 align:start position:0%
perspective they're very similar you
 
05:06:18.868 --> 05:06:18.878 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily so in the pool's
 
05:06:21.430 --> 05:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
case what you'd be asking if you still
 
05:06:23.628 --> 05:06:23.638 align:start position:0%
allowed the investment policy to exist
 
05:06:26.590 --> 05:06:26.600 align:start position:0%
is for the pool to buy a treasury to
 
05:06:28.948 --> 05:06:28.958 align:start position:0%
secure a treasury uh just simply
 
05:06:31.310 --> 05:06:31.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be the case so I think there's
 
05:06:33.948 --> 05:06:33.958 align:start position:0%
a couple of unintended consequences of
 
05:06:36.510 --> 05:06:36.520 align:start position:0%
this bill I don't think the intent of
 
05:06:38.990 --> 05:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald was necessarily to try
 
05:06:41.310 --> 05:06:41.320 align:start position:0%
to put the pool out of business as folks
 
05:06:44.310 --> 05:06:44.320 align:start position:0%
have said uh today but I think it's a
 
05:06:46.470 --> 05:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
possibility it's a real possibility
 
05:06:48.750 --> 05:06:48.760 align:start position:0%
because of what Mr Nickerson just said
 
05:06:50.510 --> 05:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
so when you hire an investment manager
 
05:06:52.750 --> 05:06:52.760 align:start position:0%
you pay them a fee and that investment
 
05:06:54.670 --> 05:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
manager can and will go out and
 
05:06:56.510 --> 05:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
negotiate rates based on what the
 
05:06:59.430 --> 05:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
investment policy is with those Banks
 
05:07:01.270 --> 05:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
but the question then becomes is does
 
05:07:03.390 --> 05:07:03.400 align:start position:0%
that fee additional fee that's paid on
 
05:07:05.590 --> 05:07:05.600 align:start position:0%
top of that make the pool less
 
05:07:07.750 --> 05:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
competitive does it in inhibit its
 
05:07:10.150 --> 05:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
ability to be competitive and we do
 
05:07:12.708 --> 05:07:12.718 align:start position:0%
think that it will another unintended
 
05:07:15.110 --> 05:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
consequence here of this bill is that
 
05:07:17.590 --> 05:07:17.600 align:start position:0%
rather than allowing local towns to
 
05:07:20.230 --> 05:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
choose you know choose what kind of risk
 
05:07:22.150 --> 05:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
they're comfortable with uh with their
 
05:07:24.868 --> 05:07:24.878 align:start position:0%
Investments you're actually imposing
 
05:07:27.270 --> 05:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
investment restrictions and limitations
 
05:07:30.190 --> 05:07:30.200 align:start position:0%
on them and additional risks that the
 
05:07:33.070 --> 05:07:33.080 align:start position:0%
state itself doesn't currently take on
 
05:07:34.350 --> 05:07:34.360 align:start position:0%
um so those are a couple of the
 
05:07:36.390 --> 05:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences of this bill as
 
05:07:39.110 --> 05:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
well so I'd be happy to answer any
 
05:07:40.788 --> 05:07:40.798 align:start position:0%
questions I'll jump in for one sec one
 
05:07:42.708 --> 05:07:42.718 align:start position:0%
of the ironies sitting here today is
 
05:07:44.708 --> 05:07:44.718 align:start position:0%
several weeks ago the bankers and the
 
05:07:47.070 --> 05:07:47.080 align:start position:0%
baa came in and test of it against House
 
05:07:50.350 --> 05:07:50.360 align:start position:0%
Bill 1267 which was against diversity in
 
05:07:51.868 --> 05:07:51.878 align:start position:0%
in the Investments of the of the New
 
05:07:53.788 --> 05:07:53.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system so on that
 
05:07:56.150 --> 05:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
day they were for diversity and here
 
05:07:57.868 --> 05:07:57.878 align:start position:0%
they're creating less diversity I think
 
05:08:00.510 --> 05:08:00.520 align:start position:0%
it's somewhat ironic thank you
 
05:08:02.510 --> 05:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
representative papovich meller thank you
 
05:08:04.270 --> 05:08:04.280 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you for being here
 
05:08:05.990 --> 05:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
and taking
 
05:08:08.830 --> 05:08:08.840 align:start position:0%
questions a question about the cost of
 
05:08:10.190 --> 05:08:10.200 align:start position:0%
the potential
 
05:08:11.548 --> 05:08:11.558 align:start position:0%
you know the potential cost that would
 
05:08:13.628 --> 05:08:13.638 align:start position:0%
be imposed on you if we decide to
 
05:08:16.230 --> 05:08:16.240 align:start position:0%
require you to collateralize or ensure
 
05:08:18.868 --> 05:08:18.878 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at your uh you know pull of
 
05:08:20.270 --> 05:08:20.280 align:start position:0%
Investments and it seems that it
 
05:08:22.030 --> 05:08:22.040 align:start position:0%
Securities with a maximum weight average
 
05:08:24.628 --> 05:08:24.638 align:start position:0%
maturity to reset of 60 days or less
 
05:08:27.830 --> 05:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
correct given the very short time you
 
05:08:30.830 --> 05:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
know the very short age of the portfolio
 
05:08:32.788 --> 05:08:32.798 align:start position:0%
it doesn't look like that
 
05:08:34.990 --> 05:08:35.000 align:start position:0%
collateralization should be particularly
 
05:08:36.628 --> 05:08:36.638 align:start position:0%
expensive for you guys what are your
 
05:08:38.628 --> 05:08:38.638 align:start position:0%
thoughts on that so again as an
 
05:08:40.788 --> 05:08:40.798 align:start position:0%
investment Pro product collateralization
 
05:08:42.830 --> 05:08:42.840 align:start position:0%
is not applicable you're invested
 
05:08:44.628 --> 05:08:44.638 align:start position:0%
directly into those Securities fly
 
05:08:46.830 --> 05:08:46.840 align:start position:0%
understood but if the state decided that
 
05:08:48.830 --> 05:08:48.840 align:start position:0%
its policy is that everything that the
 
05:08:50.430 --> 05:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
municipality invested has to be
 
05:08:52.910 --> 05:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
collateralized I'm asking about that you
 
05:08:55.110 --> 05:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
know if we decide to do that how much of
 
05:08:57.070 --> 05:08:57.080 align:start position:0%
a cost burden would be that to you in
 
05:08:59.430 --> 05:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
terms of your ability to secure the type
 
05:09:02.230 --> 05:09:02.240 align:start position:0%
of collateralization if we required it
 
05:09:05.708 --> 05:09:05.718 align:start position:0%
so in order to purchase a treasury to
 
05:09:07.948 --> 05:09:07.958 align:start position:0%
secure a treasury we'd basically have
 
05:09:09.910 --> 05:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
twice the cost there
 
05:09:11.510 --> 05:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
because you'd have to buy that same
 
05:09:14.470 --> 05:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
treasury to secure that same treasury in
 
05:09:17.030 --> 05:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
that circumstance okay thank
 
05:09:19.470 --> 05:09:19.480 align:start position:0%
you further questions from committee we
 
05:09:22.470 --> 05:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
have 12 more people waiting to speak on
 
05:09:23.990 --> 05:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
this if you're all going to spend two
 
05:09:25.868 --> 05:09:25.878 align:start position:0%
minutes asking questions we'll be here
 
05:09:28.670 --> 05:09:28.680 align:start position:0%
two hours more especially when you've
 
05:09:30.430 --> 05:09:30.440 align:start position:0%
heard some of the questions answered
 
05:09:30.440 --> 05:09:32.470 align:start position:0%
heard some of the questions answered
before

05:09:32.470 --> 05:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
before
 
05:09:36.270 --> 05:09:36.280 align:start position:0%
so and right now there's 13 opposed and
 
05:09:41.110 --> 05:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
five for so thank you very much
 
05:09:42.510 --> 05:09:42.520 align:start position:0%
and we'll next
 
05:09:51.310 --> 05:09:51.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:54.708 --> 05:09:54.718 align:start position:0%
funds so I'm going to wave my time as my
 
05:09:57.150 --> 05:09:57.160 align:start position:0%
issues have been addressed thank you
 
05:10:00.628 --> 05:10:00.638 align:start position:0%
appreciate it very much Carrie CLE from
 
05:10:17.788 --> 05:10:17.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:20.190 --> 05:10:20.200 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman Wier and
 
05:10:22.430 --> 05:10:22.440 align:start position:0%
representatives uh my name is Carrie CLE
 
05:10:23.868 --> 05:10:23.878 align:start position:0%
and I am the Director of Finance for
 
05:10:26.430 --> 05:10:26.440 align:start position:0%
Coos County for the past 11 years and
 
05:10:28.230 --> 05:10:28.240 align:start position:0%
the treasurer for the town of Colombia
 
05:10:31.030 --> 05:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
for 5 years the county in Colombia
 
05:10:33.590 --> 05:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
oppose SB 553 as
 
05:10:36.350 --> 05:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
amended most of the municipalities and
 
05:10:38.590 --> 05:10:38.600 align:start position:0%
Coos use a mixture of Investments with
 
05:10:42.070 --> 05:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire P dip and local banks this
 
05:10:43.948 --> 05:10:43.958 align:start position:0%
combination works well for our
 
05:10:46.830 --> 05:10:46.840 align:start position:0%
investment needs in rural New Hampshire
 
05:10:48.150 --> 05:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
I would like to refer to the
 
05:10:49.788 --> 05:10:49.798 align:start position:0%
commissioner's letter and highlight a
 
05:10:52.670 --> 05:10:52.680 align:start position:0%
few points we have a a letter that was
 
05:10:55.430 --> 05:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
written by our County
 
05:10:58.150 --> 05:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
Commissioners I I believe it was
 
05:11:01.030 --> 05:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
submitted a cursory review of earned
 
05:11:02.628 --> 05:11:02.638 align:start position:0%

05:11:42.270 --> 05:11:42.280 align:start position:0%
um the those are not inconsequential
 
05:11:43.990 --> 05:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
amounts for small rural towns in
 
05:11:45.548 --> 05:11:45.558 align:start position:0%
northern New Hampshire which
 
05:11:47.270 --> 05:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
unfortunately has the highest poverty
 
05:11:49.310 --> 05:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
rate in the state of in the state at
 
05:11:52.030 --> 05:11:52.040 align:start position:0%
133% and a much more challenging tax
 
05:11:54.830 --> 05:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
base than downstate and this is by no
 
05:11:56.788 --> 05:11:56.798 align:start position:0%
means allinclusive since this only
 
05:11:58.788 --> 05:11:58.798 align:start position:0%
includes interest income from some of
 
05:12:00.110 --> 05:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
the towns and does not include the
 
05:12:02.670 --> 05:12:02.680 align:start position:0%
school districts but the point of this
 
05:12:06.310 --> 05:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
is that SB 553 isn't Market oriented it
 
05:12:08.270 --> 05:12:08.280 align:start position:0%
is anti-competitive and certainly not
 
05:12:09.948 --> 05:12:09.958 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire way
 
05:12:11.868 --> 05:12:11.878 align:start position:0%
if it passes it will in effect neuter
 
05:12:14.230 --> 05:12:14.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire P dip and make it obsolete
 
05:12:16.230 --> 05:12:16.240 align:start position:0%
in return we are very concerned it will
 
05:12:18.230 --> 05:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
severely impact the finances of the
 
05:12:20.548 --> 05:12:20.558 align:start position:0%
county in virtually all the
 
05:12:22.910 --> 05:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
towns thank you very much I have a
 
05:12:24.590 --> 05:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
couple more I'll be try to be really
 
05:12:26.868 --> 05:12:26.878 align:start position:0%
quick make no mistake this was will have
 
05:12:28.628 --> 05:12:28.638 align:start position:0%
ramifications to
 
05:12:30.548 --> 05:12:30.558 align:start position:0%
taxpayers there was a clear
 
05:12:32.350 --> 05:12:32.360 align:start position:0%
rationalization for the establishment of
 
05:12:34.390 --> 05:12:34.400 align:start position:0%
the P dip and it was proven to work very
 
05:12:36.430 --> 05:12:36.440 align:start position:0%
effectively for many municipalities
 
05:12:36.440 --> 05:12:37.590 align:start position:0%
effectively for many municipalities
since

05:12:37.590 --> 05:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
since
 
05:12:40.868 --> 05:12:40.878 align:start position:0%
1993 if it's not broken why fix it the
 
05:12:41.990 --> 05:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
Commissioners want to know if the
 
05:12:44.430 --> 05:12:44.440 align:start position:0%
bankers associ Association or the
 
05:12:46.708 --> 05:12:46.718 align:start position:0%
legislature will guarantee C County and
 
05:12:48.590 --> 05:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
its towns a revenue neutral return on
 
05:12:50.150 --> 05:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
its Investments for the next three years
 
05:12:52.350 --> 05:12:52.360 align:start position:0%
based on the last three years returns
 
05:12:54.030 --> 05:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
further there will be a guarantee that
 
05:12:56.230 --> 05:12:56.240 align:start position:0%
small businesses business loans in Coos
 
05:12:58.030 --> 05:12:58.040 align:start position:0%
County will increase from this
 
05:13:00.230 --> 05:13:00.240 align:start position:0%
legislation and how much of the 24
 
05:13:01.910 --> 05:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
million in increase state and local
 
05:13:06.030 --> 05:13:06.040 align:start position:0%
revenues in 2025 will be for Coos than
 
05:13:07.830 --> 05:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
we urge legislation to bring the various
 
05:13:09.548 --> 05:13:09.558 align:start position:0%
stakeholders together to in study to
 
05:13:11.548 --> 05:13:11.558 align:start position:0%
committee to determine the efficacy of
 
05:13:13.548 --> 05:13:13.558 align:start position:0%
the Banker's economic you could leave us
 
05:13:15.548 --> 05:13:15.558 align:start position:0%
the copies of the written testimony I'll
 
05:13:17.548 --> 05:13:17.558 align:start position:0%
be sure that everybody sees it thank
 
05:13:23.708 --> 05:13:23.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:25.868 --> 05:13:25.878 align:start position:0%
Derry good afternoon thank you for your
 
05:13:28.990 --> 05:13:29.000 align:start position:0%
time I did uh email my testimony
 
05:13:30.670 --> 05:13:30.680 align:start position:0%
committee before noon time I'll just a
 
05:13:33.070 --> 05:13:33.080 align:start position:0%
couple highlights is that town of der
 
05:13:37.750 --> 05:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
invest about 25% of its assets in PIP
 
05:13:41.230 --> 05:13:41.240 align:start position:0%
and the remaining 75 5% stays with six
 
05:13:43.910 --> 05:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
various Banks either in New Hampshire or
 
05:13:46.190 --> 05:13:46.200 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and that bank in mass is
 
05:13:49.310 --> 05:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
licensed to business in New Hampshire
 
05:13:51.270 --> 05:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
with pdip rate is about
 
05:13:53.590 --> 05:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
5.5% the rates we get from the Hampshire
 
05:13:56.310 --> 05:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
Banks range from 2.92 to
 
05:13:59.708 --> 05:13:59.718 align:start position:0%
5.37 our weighted average for the other
 
05:14:04.230 --> 05:14:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:07.310 --> 05:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
3.98% if p no longer be able to be give
 
05:14:09.750 --> 05:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
us a competitive rate it would result in
 
05:14:11.628 --> 05:14:11.638 align:start position:0%
Dairy losing depending upon how you
 
05:14:13.350 --> 05:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
measure it the next highest bank they
 
05:14:15.590 --> 05:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
could accept all our deposits or our
 
05:14:17.510 --> 05:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
weighted average Dairy would lose
 
05:14:20.350 --> 05:14:20.360 align:start position:0%
between 75,000 and
 
05:14:23.628 --> 05:14:23.638 align:start position:0%
$521,000 a year based on this
 
05:14:26.590 --> 05:14:26.600 align:start position:0%
legislation now I understand the study
 
05:14:29.390 --> 05:14:29.400 align:start position:0%
which was conducted exhorts a a uh a
 
05:14:31.670 --> 05:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
large return Statewide and that's why
 
05:14:34.310 --> 05:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
it's fundamentally flawed because what
 
05:14:35.910 --> 05:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
you have is you have different
 
05:14:38.470 --> 05:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
communities with different asset size of
 
05:14:39.590 --> 05:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
through peda
 
05:14:42.270 --> 05:14:42.280 align:start position:0%
being required to deposit an instate
 
05:14:44.628 --> 05:14:44.638 align:start position:0%
bank and I'm not an economist what I
 
05:14:46.868 --> 05:14:46.878 align:start position:0%
know is that when you have over Supply
 
05:14:48.510 --> 05:14:48.520 align:start position:0%
the price goes down when you have over
 
05:14:52.150 --> 05:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
demand the price goes up and what our
 
05:14:56.150 --> 05:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
concern is is that Dairy is a tax cap
 
05:14:58.230 --> 05:14:58.240 align:start position:0%
and as a town as opposed to the school
 
05:15:01.948 --> 05:15:01.958 align:start position:0%
in the county I receive 30 I the town
 
05:15:04.470 --> 05:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
receives 33 cents of every dollar which
 
05:15:08.350 --> 05:15:08.360 align:start position:0%
we generate so in order to recover my
 
05:15:10.990 --> 05:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
losses of 75 to
 
05:15:13.270 --> 05:15:13.280 align:start position:0%
$521,000 we would have to generate an
 
05:15:16.390 --> 05:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
additional 11 million to $75 million in
 
05:15:18.390 --> 05:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
property development and just to put
 
05:15:20.628 --> 05:15:20.638 align:start position:0%
that in perspective when we build our
 
05:15:23.708 --> 05:15:23.718 align:start position:0%
budget every year we anticipate $20
 
05:15:26.548 --> 05:15:26.558 align:start position:0%
million in additional development so
 
05:15:29.070 --> 05:15:29.080 align:start position:0%
therefore our new development to hold
 
05:15:31.350 --> 05:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
Dairy harmless by having PP no longer
 
05:15:33.310 --> 05:15:33.320 align:start position:0%
being competitive we'd have to increase
 
05:15:36.430 --> 05:15:36.440 align:start position:0%
our development by between 50% and
 
05:15:38.708 --> 05:15:38.718 align:start position:0%
fourfold and so you know again I've got
 
05:15:40.510 --> 05:15:40.520 align:start position:0%
a more information but you folks can
 
05:15:43.190 --> 05:15:43.200 align:start position:0%
read and you know I just think that this
 
05:15:46.150 --> 05:15:46.160 align:start position:0%
legislation is ill advised the process
 
05:15:48.470 --> 05:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
has worked great for 30 years uh it is
 
05:15:50.868 --> 05:15:50.878 align:start position:0%
not ceriz we are very comfortable with
 
05:15:52.590 --> 05:15:52.600 align:start position:0%
that because it is overseen by the state
 
05:15:54.390 --> 05:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
treasurer and a committee of folks
 
05:15:55.708 --> 05:15:55.718 align:start position:0%
including members of the bankers
 
05:15:58.150 --> 05:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
Association as a very conservative uh
 
05:16:00.548 --> 05:16:00.558 align:start position:0%
conservative investment vehicle uh one
 
05:16:02.670 --> 05:16:02.680 align:start position:0%
additional request this is a very
 
05:16:04.910 --> 05:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
important issue and and I appreciate
 
05:16:06.548 --> 05:16:06.558 align:start position:0%
everybody's Crea creativity talking
 
05:16:06.558 --> 05:16:07.510 align:start position:0%
everybody's Crea creativity talking
about

05:16:07.510 --> 05:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:16:09.708 --> 05:16:09.718 align:start position:0%
amendments my
 
05:16:12.430 --> 05:16:12.440 align:start position:0%
request is that you vote to in expedient
 
05:16:14.868 --> 05:16:14.878 align:start position:0%
legislate if you don't then please send
 
05:16:16.510 --> 05:16:16.520 align:start position:0%
it the interim study it's way too
 
05:16:19.110 --> 05:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
important to with all due respect do
 
05:16:21.230 --> 05:16:21.240 align:start position:0%
amendments on the Fly not knowing the
 
05:16:23.548 --> 05:16:23.558 align:start position:0%
total fiscal consequences to our
 
05:16:25.230 --> 05:16:25.240 align:start position:0%
community thank you for your time thank
 
05:16:27.910 --> 05:16:27.920 align:start position:0%

fill out a separate one since we're
 
05:17:01.430 --> 05:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
speaking at the same time thank you
 
05:17:02.470 --> 05:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much members of the
 
05:17:04.230 --> 05:17:04.240 align:start position:0%
committee I've submitted testimony uh
 
05:17:05.830 --> 05:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
you have the yellow copies here I
 
05:17:07.190 --> 05:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
emailed them to as well and I won't
 
05:17:09.030 --> 05:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
repeat what I've already sent you but I
 
05:17:10.510 --> 05:17:10.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to just indicate that the town of
 
05:17:12.868 --> 05:17:12.878 align:start position:0%
durm is very much against this bill we
 
05:17:14.310 --> 05:17:14.320 align:start position:0%
would agree with my colleague David
 
05:17:16.430 --> 05:17:16.440 align:start position:0%
Karen from the town of dairy that this
 
05:17:18.470 --> 05:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
is too important issue to try to adjust
 
05:17:20.510 --> 05:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
on the fly if there's a desire to do
 
05:17:21.830 --> 05:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
that we'd recommend you send it to
 
05:17:25.270 --> 05:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
interim study I want to just paint for
 
05:17:27.910 --> 05:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
you a picture of what it's like at the
 
05:17:30.110 --> 05:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
local level many many communities are
 
05:17:32.150 --> 05:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
very small they have limited resources
 
05:17:34.230 --> 05:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
they have limited expertise and it's
 
05:17:36.190 --> 05:17:36.200 align:start position:0%
challenging for them to shop around for
 
05:17:39.310 --> 05:17:39.320 align:start position:0%
the best interest rate often they also
 
05:17:42.670 --> 05:17:42.680 align:start position:0%
don't have the size of deposits that are
 
05:17:45.510 --> 05:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
needed to Garner a high rate unlike the
 
05:17:47.590 --> 05:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
city of Manchester or nashille perhaps
 
05:17:49.430 --> 05:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
the city of conquer where you have the
 
05:17:51.430 --> 05:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
resources and you have the dollars you
 
05:17:53.868 --> 05:17:53.878 align:start position:0%
can walk into Citizens Bank and say I'd
 
05:17:55.390 --> 05:17:55.400 align:start position:0%
like a good rate and if you can't you
 
05:17:57.548 --> 05:17:57.558 align:start position:0%
find a better rate somewhere else for
 
05:18:00.150 --> 05:18:00.160 align:start position:0%
many of our 234 towns and cities that's
 
05:18:02.270 --> 05:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
just not the case so the New Hampshire
 
05:18:04.868 --> 05:18:04.878 align:start position:0%
Public deposit investment pool allows
 
05:18:07.150 --> 05:18:07.160 align:start position:0%
for a very easy transaction between
 
05:18:09.030 --> 05:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
inexperienced local officials looking
 
05:18:11.190 --> 05:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
for a safe place to invest their money
 
05:18:13.590 --> 05:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
at a high rate of return you heard
 
05:18:15.470 --> 05:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
earlier from one of the speakers that
 
05:18:18.030 --> 05:18:18.040 align:start position:0%
there's a moral argument in play here to
 
05:18:19.510 --> 05:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
invest money in the state of New
 
05:18:21.788 --> 05:18:21.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I would argue on behalf of
 
05:18:24.150 --> 05:18:24.160 align:start position:0%
localities that the moral argument is to
 
05:18:28.110 --> 05:18:28.120 align:start position:0%
invest local dollars some are tax uh tax
 
05:18:30.110 --> 05:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
receipts some are donations the town
 
05:18:32.868 --> 05:18:32.878 align:start position:0%
might receive some are bequests the town
 
05:18:35.150 --> 05:18:35.160 align:start position:0%
has received for the Perpetual care of
 
05:18:38.788 --> 05:18:38.798 align:start position:0%
grave sites cemeteries scholarships some
 
05:18:40.548 --> 05:18:40.558 align:start position:0%
our Capital Improvement project monies
 
05:18:43.150 --> 05:18:43.160 align:start position:0%
that have been put aside the fiduciary
 
05:18:45.510 --> 05:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility is to find the highest
 
05:18:48.310 --> 05:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
rate of return in a prudent way and
 
05:18:50.150 --> 05:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
that's what communities try to do and to
 
05:18:52.430 --> 05:18:52.440 align:start position:0%
limit that by forcing the communities to
 
05:18:54.868 --> 05:18:54.878 align:start position:0%
only be able to deal with the banks is a
 
05:18:57.430 --> 05:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
challenge I think the P dip allows the
 
05:18:59.470 --> 05:18:59.480 align:start position:0%
performance of that goal to maximize
 
05:19:02.430 --> 05:19:02.440 align:start position:0%
those local dollars now in terms of the
 
05:19:05.150 --> 05:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
U projections within the uh Golab study
 
05:19:06.948 --> 05:19:06.958 align:start position:0%
I have a lot of respect for Brian gotab
 
05:19:10.310 --> 05:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
he's outstanding I believe that much of
 
05:19:12.788 --> 05:19:12.798 align:start position:0%
what he's outlined is highly speculative
 
05:19:16.948 --> 05:19:16.958 align:start position:0%
and I wanted to um read to you an email
 
05:19:20.230 --> 05:19:20.240 align:start position:0%
that I received today from a uh select
 
05:19:23.510 --> 05:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
person in the town of uh newfields uh
 
05:19:28.830 --> 05:19:28.840 align:start position:0%
this is from uh um hold on a
 
05:19:34.070 --> 05:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
moment I'm sorry Michael sonunu
 
05:19:37.230 --> 05:19:37.240 align:start position:0%
um right can what what is this
 
05:19:39.030 --> 05:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
legislation intended to do can it really
 
05:19:40.830 --> 05:19:40.840 align:start position:0%
be based on a speculative notion that
 
05:19:42.548 --> 05:19:42.558 align:start position:0%
the banks would reinvest the funds in
 
05:19:44.470 --> 05:19:44.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire businesses and therefore
 
05:19:46.390 --> 05:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
provide economic benefits beyond the
 
05:19:48.670 --> 05:19:48.680 align:start position:0%
returns provided by the pool if this was
 
05:19:50.948 --> 05:19:50.958 align:start position:0%
the case then why do many of the banks
 
05:19:52.788 --> 05:19:52.798 align:start position:0%
in the state park their excess reserves
 
05:19:54.910 --> 05:19:54.920 align:start position:0%
in the Federal Reserve System providing
 
05:19:57.590 --> 05:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
no economic benefit for the state and
 
05:19:59.030 --> 05:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
why would anyone believe that providing
 
05:20:00.350 --> 05:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
them with hundreds of millions of
 
05:20:02.390 --> 05:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
dollars in deposits taken from the pool
 
05:20:03.788 --> 05:20:03.798 align:start position:0%
wouldn't result in those Banks
 
05:20:06.310 --> 05:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
evaluating the risk return on investing
 
05:20:08.150 --> 05:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
those funds and doing what they do with
 
05:20:10.590 --> 05:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
their excess funds now in fact as
 
05:20:12.910 --> 05:20:12.920 align:start position:0%
fiduciaries the bank managers and board
 
05:20:15.548 --> 05:20:15.558 align:start position:0%
members have capital letters to take
 
05:20:17.110 --> 05:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
that into consideration and won't
 
05:20:19.070 --> 05:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
automatically just open the spigots for
 
05:20:21.310 --> 05:20:21.320 align:start position:0%
local businesses and if there are better
 
05:20:23.230 --> 05:20:23.240 align:start position:0%
ways to put those funds to work they
 
05:20:25.948 --> 05:20:25.958 align:start position:0%
will buy MBS as us treasuries or deposit
 
05:20:27.990 --> 05:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
the funds in a bank in another state
 
05:20:30.470 --> 05:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
that is providing an excellent interest
 
05:20:32.670 --> 05:20:32.680 align:start position:0%
rate remember too that these funds are
 
05:20:34.590 --> 05:20:34.600 align:start position:0%
fungible and that once put into the
 
05:20:36.510 --> 05:20:36.520 align:start position:0%
banks you'll have no way of ensuring
 
05:20:38.990 --> 05:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
that the pool funds are turned into the
 
05:20:41.670 --> 05:20:41.680 align:start position:0%
local loans or if they are the deposits
 
05:20:44.548 --> 05:20:44.558 align:start position:0%
used to buy more us treasuries I'd also
 
05:20:46.270 --> 05:20:46.280 align:start position:0%
note that to the extent that
 
05:20:48.350 --> 05:20:48.360 align:start position:0%
municipalities are able to maximize the
 
05:20:50.590 --> 05:20:50.600 align:start position:0%
rate of return that's all money we put
 
05:20:52.470 --> 05:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
back into our local communities so if
 
05:20:55.430 --> 05:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
you allow the pool to maximize the rate
 
05:20:57.948 --> 05:20:57.958 align:start position:0%
it empowers municipalities school
 
05:21:00.510 --> 05:21:00.520 align:start position:0%
districts uh Trustees of the trust funds
 
05:21:02.910 --> 05:21:02.920 align:start position:0%
Etc to reinvest back in their local
 
05:21:04.948 --> 05:21:04.958 align:start position:0%
communities and that I anticipate would
 
05:21:07.990 --> 05:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
drive the same level of business um if
 
05:21:09.070 --> 05:21:09.080 align:start position:0%
you have any question questions I'd be
 
05:21:11.830 --> 05:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
happy to answer them thank you very much
 
05:21:13.670 --> 05:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate you
 
05:21:16.150 --> 05:21:16.160 align:start position:0%
coming representative Edwards thank you
 
05:21:18.590 --> 05:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I I I want to come back around
 
05:21:21.310 --> 05:21:21.320 align:start position:0%
to your comfort level professionally
 
05:21:24.910 --> 05:21:24.920 align:start position:0%
with um the risk that's uh that that
 
05:21:26.990 --> 05:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
this fund is currently exposed to are
 
05:21:30.990 --> 05:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
you satisfied that uh that the the the
 
05:21:33.310 --> 05:21:33.320 align:start position:0%
riskiness of the Investments of these
 
05:21:37.030 --> 05:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
funds um let you sleep at night or or is
 
05:21:39.708 --> 05:21:39.718 align:start position:0%
it does it exceed your risk tolerance
 
05:21:42.190 --> 05:21:42.200 align:start position:0%
they they allow us to sleep at night the
 
05:21:43.910 --> 05:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
the it was the banking commissioner
 
05:21:45.948 --> 05:21:45.958 align:start position:0%
until a year ago I believe and now the
 
05:21:48.548 --> 05:21:48.558 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire treasure assisted by other
 
05:21:50.390 --> 05:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
board members established by Statute who
 
05:21:52.628 --> 05:21:52.638 align:start position:0%
manage that pool they do a very good job
 
05:21:55.310 --> 05:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
and I actually wrote to uh the fund
 
05:21:57.390 --> 05:21:57.400 align:start position:0%
manager who you heard from earlier today
 
05:21:59.350 --> 05:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
with a series of questions and I have
 
05:22:01.708 --> 05:22:01.718 align:start position:0%
her responses in the yellow packet that
 
05:22:03.430 --> 05:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
I've provided but thank you very much I
 
05:22:04.510 --> 05:22:04.520 align:start position:0%
I asked about this issue of
 
05:22:06.830 --> 05:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
collateralization and her answer was
 
05:22:08.628 --> 05:22:08.638 align:start position:0%
there's no requirement nor should there
 
05:22:10.670 --> 05:22:10.680 align:start position:0%
be to collateralize investments in the
 
05:22:12.548 --> 05:22:12.558 align:start position:0%
in the pool simply because of the direct
 
05:22:14.628 --> 05:22:14.638 align:start position:0%
nature of the Investments a purchase of
 
05:22:16.708 --> 05:22:16.718 align:start position:0%
securities issued by the United States a
 
05:22:19.230 --> 05:22:19.240 align:start position:0%
federal agency commercial paper Etc
 
05:22:21.830 --> 05:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
differs from Bank deposits and that nhp
 
05:22:24.230 --> 05:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
dip and investors by way of the pool the
 
05:22:27.150 --> 05:22:27.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities own the security itself
 
05:22:29.030 --> 05:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
collateralization of Bank deposits are
 
05:22:30.990 --> 05:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
required because of the uncertainty
 
05:22:33.150 --> 05:22:33.160 align:start position:0%
regarding the ability of the banks to
 
05:22:36.030 --> 05:22:36.040 align:start position:0%
always have cash on hand or the ability
 
05:22:37.590 --> 05:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
to make cash available for your
 
05:22:40.110 --> 05:22:40.120 align:start position:0%
withdrawals funds deposited into the
 
05:22:43.030 --> 05:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
banks are either loaned out or invested
 
05:22:45.150 --> 05:22:45.160 align:start position:0%
in the bank's own accounts the
 
05:22:47.430 --> 05:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
Securities Banks invest in are the same
 
05:22:49.070 --> 05:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
generally kinds of Securities that the
 
05:22:52.510 --> 05:22:52.520 align:start position:0%
pool invests in thank you thank you
 
05:22:54.470 --> 05:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
thank you no further questions we'll
 
05:22:57.708 --> 05:22:57.718 align:start position:0%
next call on representative Jim I think
 
05:23:02.788 --> 05:23:02.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:05.230 --> 05:23:05.240 align:start position:0%
Ron sorry I didn't realize there was a
 
05:23:10.868 --> 05:23:10.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:12.868 --> 05:23:12.878 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you members
 
05:23:15.110 --> 05:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
for hearing my testimony I would like
 
05:23:19.030 --> 05:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
first to correct one thing that uh the
 
05:23:21.110 --> 05:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
treasurer from or the finance officer
 
05:23:25.670 --> 05:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
from Coos County said uh gron
 
05:23:28.230 --> 05:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
Northumberland uh on one account made
 
05:23:28.240 --> 05:23:28.830 align:start position:0%
Northumberland uh on one account made
that

05:23:28.830 --> 05:23:28.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:23:33.350 --> 05:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
$14,600 figure she said the total amount
 
05:23:36.430 --> 05:23:36.440 align:start position:0%
on all funds invested in PIP exceeded
 
05:23:36.440 --> 05:23:38.590 align:start position:0%
on all funds invested in PIP exceeded
$100,000

05:23:38.590 --> 05:23:38.600 align:start position:0%
$100,000
 
05:23:40.310 --> 05:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
that the town
 
05:23:45.310 --> 05:23:45.320 align:start position:0%
made okay uh as far as P dip goes it's
 
05:23:47.430 --> 05:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
an investment just like any investment
 
05:23:50.070 --> 05:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
any of youve got in mutual funds it is
 
05:23:52.910 --> 05:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
perfectly safe at this time yes if
 
05:23:55.708 --> 05:23:55.718 align:start position:0%
there's a meltdown in the stock market
 
05:23:57.708 --> 05:23:57.718 align:start position:0%
around the world yep we will suffer a
 
05:24:00.548 --> 05:24:00.558 align:start position:0%
loss but so will everybody else uh we
 
05:24:03.990 --> 05:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
have no problems with this at all and I
 
05:24:06.868 --> 05:24:06.878 align:start position:0%
liked car's uh statement if it ain't
 
05:24:09.030 --> 05:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
broke don't fix it
 
05:24:12.070 --> 05:24:12.080 align:start position:0%

05:24:19.430 --> 05:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
from Kean school district and if I said
 
05:24:21.628 --> 05:24:21.638 align:start position:0%

05:24:25.990 --> 05:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
Wayman and all the representatives I'm
 
05:24:30.390 --> 05:24:30.400 align:start position:0%
Tim Tim Roar um handwriting Is Not Great
 
05:24:33.070 --> 05:24:33.080 align:start position:0%
uh but I've been doing I'm so I'm a CFO
 
05:24:34.868 --> 05:24:34.878 align:start position:0%
at uh keing School District I represent
 
05:24:36.270 --> 05:24:36.280 align:start position:0%
a number of districts I'll try to be
 
05:24:38.110 --> 05:24:38.120 align:start position:0%
brief and not go over what everybody has
 
05:24:39.310 --> 05:24:39.320 align:start position:0%
said there's been a number of good
 
05:24:41.230 --> 05:24:41.240 align:start position:0%
points but I think I have a perspective
 
05:24:43.470 --> 05:24:43.480 align:start position:0%
that will help one of the things that
 
05:24:46.110 --> 05:24:46.120 align:start position:0%
that make the information that's coming
 
05:24:50.910 --> 05:24:50.920 align:start position:0%
out suspect to me is that in reality I
 
05:24:53.190 --> 05:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
used the I've used the pool on and off
 
05:24:55.350 --> 05:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
since uh
 
05:24:58.708 --> 05:24:58.718 align:start position:0%
2001 um five years ago you would have
 
05:25:02.030 --> 05:25:02.040 align:start position:0%
seen my balance at zero their rates were
 
05:25:04.548 --> 05:25:04.558 align:start position:0%
terrible now you'll see my balance is
 
05:25:07.590 --> 05:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
about $7 million rates are pretty good
 
05:25:09.548 --> 05:25:09.558 align:start position:0%
uh my balance for one of the school
 
05:25:11.670 --> 05:25:11.680 align:start position:0%
districts that I uh
 
05:25:14.830 --> 05:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
oversee um but every dime that goes
 
05:25:17.590 --> 05:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
through P dip eventually goes through my
 
05:25:22.110 --> 05:25:22.120 align:start position:0%
bank so there's not 600 million extra
 
05:25:24.788 --> 05:25:24.798 align:start position:0%
there's 600 million currently but most
 
05:25:26.628 --> 05:25:26.638 align:start position:0%
of those funds will eventually run
 
05:25:28.868 --> 05:25:28.878 align:start position:0%
through a bank to be spent and become
 
05:25:31.150 --> 05:25:31.160 align:start position:0%
part of the deposits in a bank so this
 
05:25:33.230 --> 05:25:33.240 align:start position:0%
assumption that it's an additional 600
 
05:25:37.548 --> 05:25:37.558 align:start position:0%
million is not true it it there are some
 
05:25:39.310 --> 05:25:39.320 align:start position:0%
funds I leave in there you know people
 
05:25:40.788 --> 05:25:40.798 align:start position:0%
have Cemetery funds that stay in there
 
05:25:42.590 --> 05:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
for a long time but to spend them it's
 
05:25:44.548 --> 05:25:44.558 align:start position:0%
not a bank they're all going through
 
05:25:46.350 --> 05:25:46.360 align:start position:0%
they're they're reaping the rewards from
 
05:25:49.750 --> 05:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
those deposits eventually but also that
 
05:25:51.390 --> 05:25:51.400 align:start position:0%
interest rates are the same I have a lot
 
05:25:53.190 --> 05:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
of bargaining power I have districts
 
05:25:55.628 --> 05:25:55.638 align:start position:0%
with no bargaining power this was
 
05:25:58.590 --> 05:25:58.600 align:start position:0%
created to give us we don't have a Level
 
05:26:01.030 --> 05:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
Playing Field if this was your money if
 
05:26:03.270 --> 05:26:03.280 align:start position:0%
you were putting 75 million through your
 
05:26:05.270 --> 05:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
personal account would you like New
 
05:26:06.948 --> 05:26:06.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to tell you you can only use a
 
05:26:06.958 --> 05:26:08.548 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to tell you you can only use a
bank

05:26:08.548 --> 05:26:08.558 align:start position:0%
bank
 
05:26:11.390 --> 05:26:11.400 align:start position:0%
you would lose out on lots of money and
 
05:26:13.430 --> 05:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
in this case that's what we're talking
 
05:26:16.628 --> 05:26:16.638 align:start position:0%
about they created a small little
 
05:26:21.150 --> 05:26:21.160 align:start position:0%
riskier pool so that we can get returns
 
05:26:24.430 --> 05:26:24.440 align:start position:0%
of taxpayers money for taxpayers for us
 
05:26:27.708 --> 05:26:27.718 align:start position:0%
it means for Keen alone this year no
 
05:26:31.030 --> 05:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
projections I would lose
 
05:26:33.910 --> 05:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
$300,000 that would directly go to
 
05:26:36.510 --> 05:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
taxpayers through property tax I was
 
05:26:39.548 --> 05:26:39.558 align:start position:0%
able to lower the property tax ask by
 
05:26:42.110 --> 05:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
$300,000 of tax rate setting that I
 
05:26:44.390 --> 05:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
would not and I'm going to go tell them
 
05:26:46.190 --> 05:26:46.200 align:start position:0%
but don't worry you're going to have I'm
 
05:26:47.990 --> 05:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
raising that next year but don't worry
 
05:26:49.390 --> 05:26:49.400 align:start position:0%
it's going to be vested in New Hampshire
 
05:26:53.030 --> 05:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
you'll be fine I mean this is this pool
 
05:26:55.150 --> 05:26:55.160 align:start position:0%
was created by a very smart body like
 
05:26:58.150 --> 05:26:58.160 align:start position:0%
yourselves to help us to help the
 
05:27:00.390 --> 05:27:00.400 align:start position:0%
taxpayer and to shoot ourselves in the
 
05:27:03.948 --> 05:27:03.958 align:start position:0%
foot for the name of helping New
 
05:27:07.948 --> 05:27:07.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is not smart that's all I have
 
05:27:09.350 --> 05:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
to say thank you thank you very much for
 
05:27:09.360 --> 05:27:10.470 align:start position:0%
to say thank you thank you very much for
your

05:27:10.470 --> 05:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
your
 
05:27:12.948 --> 05:27:12.958 align:start position:0%
brevity all right next call Annette
 
05:27:20.868 --> 05:27:20.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:24.430 --> 05:27:24.440 align:start position:0%
Carol thank you for your time um I lot
 
05:27:27.070 --> 05:27:27.080 align:start position:0%
of my testimony has already been given
 
05:27:29.270 --> 05:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
but I'm Anette Marquee from the town of
 
05:27:32.430 --> 05:27:32.440 align:start position:0%
Carol I'm the treasurer um and I'm
 
05:27:34.470 --> 05:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
speaking on behalf of myself and our
 
05:27:37.948 --> 05:27:37.958 align:start position:0%
three Selectmen that we oppose this bill
 
05:27:40.470 --> 05:27:40.480 align:start position:0%
um um I won't reiterate a lot of what's
 
05:27:42.990 --> 05:27:43.000 align:start position:0%
said I certainly agree but I'm here to
 
05:27:47.230 --> 05:27:47.240 align:start position:0%
give a reality check on the first item
 
05:27:49.708 --> 05:27:49.718 align:start position:0%
we heard them talk about IC accounts
 
05:27:53.910 --> 05:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
where they sweep money out over the
 
05:27:56.750 --> 05:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
250,000 when I look at my bank statement
 
05:27:59.430 --> 05:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
every month and they sweep our excess
 
05:28:02.548 --> 05:28:02.558 align:start position:0%
money out it goes to about 20 different
 
05:28:05.470 --> 05:28:05.480 align:start position:0%
banks not one of those Banks is located
 
05:28:10.708 --> 05:28:10.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:12.708 --> 05:28:12.718 align:start position:0%
the second thing that I want to testify
 
05:28:16.510 --> 05:28:16.520 align:start position:0%
to is we talk about the leverage that
 
05:28:19.990 --> 05:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
the pool gives us to negotiate loans and
 
05:28:22.030 --> 05:28:22.040 align:start position:0%
to negotiate interest
 
05:28:25.708 --> 05:28:25.718 align:start position:0%
rates well our school has a $24 million
 
05:28:27.830 --> 05:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
budget that goes through one
 
05:28:31.390 --> 05:28:31.400 align:start position:0%
account my town has a budget of $7
 
05:28:35.190 --> 05:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
million I used the pool and I received
 
05:28:36.510 --> 05:28:36.520 align:start position:0%
for the town
 
05:28:39.628 --> 05:28:39.638 align:start position:0%
$150,000 in interest this year the
 
05:28:42.390 --> 05:28:42.400 align:start position:0%
school does not use the pool they use
 
05:28:46.430 --> 05:28:46.440 align:start position:0%
one bank and they got
 
05:28:51.510 --> 05:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:54.750 --> 05:28:54.760 align:start position:0%
$2,200 it gives us leverage please don't
 
05:28:57.150 --> 05:28:57.160 align:start position:0%
take away our leverage thank you very
 
05:28:59.190 --> 05:28:59.200 align:start position:0%
much all right let's hear from a couple
 
05:29:02.110 --> 05:29:02.120 align:start position:0%
of people who support the bill Dave juv
 
05:29:16.150 --> 05:29:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:17.788 --> 05:29:17.798 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair for the record my
 
05:29:19.470 --> 05:29:19.480 align:start position:0%
name is Dave juv I'm a senior vice
 
05:29:21.430 --> 05:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
president with the business and industry
 
05:29:23.788 --> 05:29:23.798 align:start position:0%
Association we represent uh State
 
05:29:25.788 --> 05:29:25.798 align:start position:0%
employers here at the legislature we are
 
05:29:30.310 --> 05:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
here in favor of this bill um there's
 
05:29:32.310 --> 05:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
been a lot of comments uh from those
 
05:29:34.230 --> 05:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
opposing it saying if it ain't broke
 
05:29:37.110 --> 05:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
don't fix it those of us who support
 
05:29:39.150 --> 05:29:39.160 align:start position:0%
this legislation are not suggesting
 
05:29:41.628 --> 05:29:41.638 align:start position:0%
something's broken and needs to be fixed
 
05:29:44.030 --> 05:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
we're suggesting that there's a lot of
 
05:29:47.030 --> 05:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
money that would be available to uh
 
05:29:49.310 --> 05:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
create economic development in New
 
05:29:53.110 --> 05:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that is not currently doing so
 
05:29:55.310 --> 05:29:55.320 align:start position:0%
uh that's my simple Point you'll be
 
05:29:57.190 --> 05:29:57.200 align:start position:0%
happy to hear I have written testimony
 
05:30:00.270 --> 05:30:00.280 align:start position:0%
that I will leave with the assistant
 
05:30:02.430 --> 05:30:02.440 align:start position:0%
thank you you testified often enough to
 
05:30:04.430 --> 05:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
know how it
 
05:30:11.948 --> 05:30:11.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:13.390 --> 05:30:13.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I will I have
 
05:30:14.868 --> 05:30:14.878 align:start position:0%
submitted written testimony and I will
 
05:30:16.708 --> 05:30:16.718 align:start position:0%
not read it uh but I will just make a
 
05:30:18.230 --> 05:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
few points based on the conversation
 
05:30:20.548 --> 05:30:20.558 align:start position:0%
that's happened here today uh Mascoma is
 
05:30:22.030 --> 05:30:22.040 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire chartered institution
 
05:30:24.390 --> 05:30:24.400 align:start position:0%
based in Lebanon we $3 billion do in
 
05:30:26.350 --> 05:30:26.360 align:start position:0%
assets with over 400 people and most of
 
05:30:28.628 --> 05:30:28.638 align:start position:0%
our operations are in New Hampshire but
 
05:30:30.990 --> 05:30:31.000 align:start position:0%
we also operate in Vermont and Maine and
 
05:30:32.110 --> 05:30:32.120 align:start position:0%
I think that gives me a unique
 
05:30:34.310 --> 05:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
perspective to be able to offer that the
 
05:30:36.190 --> 05:30:36.200 align:start position:0%
deposit environment in those states that
 
05:30:37.990 --> 05:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
do not have investment pools is high
 
05:30:40.670 --> 05:30:40.680 align:start position:0%
highly competitive uh we see that even
 
05:30:42.390 --> 05:30:42.400 align:start position:0%
more so in some of those States in
 
05:30:45.510 --> 05:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
certain places uh even uh more so paying
 
05:30:47.070 --> 05:30:47.080 align:start position:0%
rates higher than the than the pool is
 
05:30:49.150 --> 05:30:49.160 align:start position:0%
currently offering in New Hampshire so I
 
05:30:51.310 --> 05:30:51.320 align:start position:0%
think the fair market works very well
 
05:30:53.310 --> 05:30:53.320 align:start position:0%
even in the absence of of a pool which
 
05:30:55.190 --> 05:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
is not what the bankers Association is
 
05:30:58.350 --> 05:30:58.360 align:start position:0%
saying should happen um and so therefore
 
05:31:00.868 --> 05:31:00.878 align:start position:0%
what I would argue is that given that
 
05:31:03.310 --> 05:31:03.320 align:start position:0%
competitiveness the the numbers you were
 
05:31:04.948 --> 05:31:04.958 align:start position:0%
hearing cited from municipalities are
 
05:31:07.270 --> 05:31:07.280 align:start position:0%
not going to drop to zero the return is
 
05:31:10.190 --> 05:31:10.200 align:start position:0%
still going to be be there uh and it and
 
05:31:12.110 --> 05:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
in addition to that return it will allow
 
05:31:15.230 --> 05:31:15.240 align:start position:0%
us as Banks to continue funding very
 
05:31:17.628 --> 05:31:17.638 align:start position:0%
solid loans as representative Maguire
 
05:31:19.830 --> 05:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
inquired not the that there is more
 
05:31:22.030 --> 05:31:22.040 align:start position:0%
demand for than there is capital today
 
05:31:24.390 --> 05:31:24.400 align:start position:0%
and not marginal loans uh we see that
 
05:31:27.070 --> 05:31:27.080 align:start position:0%
throughout our market and uh I I can I
 
05:31:28.548 --> 05:31:28.558 align:start position:0%
can attest that that is critically
 
05:31:31.708 --> 05:31:31.718 align:start position:0%
important on the matter of IC um we are
 
05:31:34.470 --> 05:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
a big uh uh user of that service it it
 
05:31:36.230 --> 05:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
was created by a gentleman named Jane
 
05:31:38.190 --> 05:31:38.200 align:start position:0%
lwig who was the former comp troller of
 
05:31:41.430 --> 05:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
the currency for the US uh it is I would
 
05:31:44.788 --> 05:31:44.798 align:start position:0%
say a sophisticated product that allows
 
05:31:47.990 --> 05:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
us to um participate in these reciprocal
 
05:31:50.628 --> 05:31:50.638 align:start position:0%
deposits so yes they are held by Banks
 
05:31:52.590 --> 05:31:52.600 align:start position:0%
from around the country but we hold
 
05:31:54.868 --> 05:31:54.878 align:start position:0%
their reciprocating deposits with us
 
05:31:56.868 --> 05:31:56.878 align:start position:0%
which allows us to put those dollars to
 
05:31:59.470 --> 05:31:59.480 align:start position:0%
work in New Hampshire they are not being
 
05:32:00.868 --> 05:32:00.878 align:start position:0%
held by someone else and invested
 
05:32:03.590 --> 05:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
elsewhere they're being invested locally
 
05:32:05.548 --> 05:32:05.558 align:start position:0%
um that I think is critically important
 
05:32:07.390 --> 05:32:07.400 align:start position:0%
to understand the other thing that I
 
05:32:08.990 --> 05:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
think is an important point and we have
 
05:32:11.190 --> 05:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
dozens and dozens of Municipal customers
 
05:32:12.868 --> 05:32:12.878 align:start position:0%
and hundreds of millions of dollars on
 
05:32:15.750 --> 05:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
deposit with them we as a Community Bank
 
05:32:18.750 --> 05:32:18.760 align:start position:0%
operate and compete on on price but also
 
05:32:21.350 --> 05:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
service and what we find with many of
 
05:32:23.910 --> 05:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
those municipalities of all varieties
 
05:32:26.070 --> 05:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
and levels of government is that some
 
05:32:28.110 --> 05:32:28.120 align:start position:0%
are are absolutely rate seeking
 
05:32:30.350 --> 05:32:30.360 align:start position:0%
maximizing people others need it for
 
05:32:32.270 --> 05:32:32.280 align:start position:0%
other reasons they need flexibility so
 
05:32:34.628 --> 05:32:34.638 align:start position:0%
there are municipalities or or levels of
 
05:32:36.230 --> 05:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
government that want to have operating
 
05:32:38.270 --> 05:32:38.280 align:start position:0%
accounts where there's quick access that
 
05:32:41.590 --> 05:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
is not a high rate in uh uh uh fund just
 
05:32:43.070 --> 05:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
as we as consumers wouldn't you would
 
05:32:44.708 --> 05:32:44.718 align:start position:0%
have a checking account and a savings
 
05:32:47.030 --> 05:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
account those that are more rate seeking
 
05:32:48.910 --> 05:32:48.920 align:start position:0%
work with us and their local banks to
 
05:32:51.708 --> 05:32:51.718 align:start position:0%
find how do I maximize my rate and PP is
 
05:32:54.110 --> 05:32:54.120 align:start position:0%
always out there and that is hanging
 
05:32:56.590 --> 05:32:56.600 align:start position:0%
right over our heads less the cost of
 
05:32:59.230 --> 05:32:59.240 align:start position:0%
what it cost us to ensure these deposits
 
05:33:02.310 --> 05:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
uh to make sure that they are safe um so
 
05:33:03.750 --> 05:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
I think those are some of the points
 
05:33:05.110 --> 05:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
that that I would like to make and I
 
05:33:06.708 --> 05:33:06.718 align:start position:0%
just want to thank you for your time
 
05:33:10.430 --> 05:33:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:12.190 --> 05:33:12.200 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair thank you
 
05:33:13.868 --> 05:33:13.878 align:start position:0%
for the question just to clarify what
 
05:33:16.548 --> 05:33:16.558 align:start position:0%
you first said are you suggesting that
 
05:33:20.030 --> 05:33:20.040 align:start position:0%
the non-time deposit interest rates paid
 
05:33:23.948 --> 05:33:23.958 align:start position:0%
in Maine and Vermont exceed the rates
 
05:33:26.230 --> 05:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
paid by the we see that in some places
 
05:33:27.830 --> 05:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
yes so those are those are states
 
05:33:30.150 --> 05:33:30.160 align:start position:0%
without pools when you say some places
 
05:33:32.070 --> 05:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
can you be more specific I think you
 
05:33:33.788 --> 05:33:33.798 align:start position:0%
might see it in more urban areas like a
 
05:33:35.788 --> 05:33:35.798 align:start position:0%
Portland or a Burlington than you would
 
05:33:37.470 --> 05:33:37.480 align:start position:0%
in in other areas where there are just
 
05:33:39.510 --> 05:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
more financial institutions that's not
 
05:33:42.070 --> 05:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
to say that we're not serving our other
 
05:33:44.948 --> 05:33:44.958 align:start position:0%
smaller communities uh equally as well
 
05:33:47.948 --> 05:33:47.958 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you sir y further
 
05:33:50.548 --> 05:33:50.558 align:start position:0%

bill good afternoon arm chairman wer
 
05:34:10.310 --> 05:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
it's been a little bit of time since
 
05:34:11.990 --> 05:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
I've testified in front of you and
 
05:34:14.350 --> 05:34:14.360 align:start position:0%
members of the house finance committee
 
05:34:16.868 --> 05:34:16.878 align:start position:0%
I'm Dan Lynch I currently have 32 years
 
05:34:18.590 --> 05:34:18.600 align:start position:0%
of combined experience in New Hampshire
 
05:34:21.070 --> 05:34:21.080 align:start position:0%
Municipal and government Finance I was
 
05:34:23.628 --> 05:34:23.638 align:start position:0%
working in the town of marac I started
 
05:34:25.470 --> 05:34:25.480 align:start position:0%
in February
 
05:34:28.510 --> 05:34:28.520 align:start position:0%
1992 so I've been using the pool since
 
05:34:31.430 --> 05:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
its Inception I've used it in marac I've
 
05:34:33.788 --> 05:34:33.798 align:start position:0%
used it in Raymond and currently I'm the
 
05:34:35.510 --> 05:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
finance director in the city of do and
 
05:34:38.190 --> 05:34:38.200 align:start position:0%
we use it there through the pool last
 
05:34:41.270 --> 05:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
year our fiscal year 2023 we generated
 
05:34:44.070 --> 05:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
almost a million dollars from our
 
05:34:47.150 --> 05:34:47.160 align:start position:0%
investments in the pool that's about 33
 
05:34:50.350 --> 05:34:50.360 align:start position:0%
cents on our tax rate if you're in favor
 
05:34:52.868 --> 05:34:52.878 align:start position:0%
of increasing property tax at the local
 
05:34:55.350 --> 05:34:55.360 align:start position:0%
level then vote for this
 
05:34:57.590 --> 05:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
bill because that's what's going to
 
05:35:00.110 --> 05:35:00.120 align:start position:0%
happen I don't know any other way to
 
05:35:02.830 --> 05:35:02.840 align:start position:0%
look at it the pred benefits of the
 
05:35:04.830 --> 05:35:04.840 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation are speculative at
 
05:35:07.990 --> 05:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
best to my knowledge the report by
 
05:35:10.070 --> 05:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
polyon has never been vetted by a
 
05:35:12.430 --> 05:35:12.440 align:start position:0%
municipality County School District to
 
05:35:15.150 --> 05:35:15.160 align:start position:0%
say hey what's the offsetting impact of
 
05:35:15.160 --> 05:35:16.470 align:start position:0%
say hey what's the offsetting impact of
doing

05:35:16.470 --> 05:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
doing
 
05:35:20.030 --> 05:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
this there's no obligations noted in 553
 
05:35:23.390 --> 05:35:23.400 align:start position:0%
to require the banks to make loans spur
 
05:35:26.708 --> 05:35:26.718 align:start position:0%
this supposed economic benefit that the
 
05:35:29.390 --> 05:35:29.400 align:start position:0%
polycon report
 
05:35:31.628 --> 05:35:31.638 align:start position:0%
perpetuates the likelihood is that
 
05:35:34.470 --> 05:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities the bigger municipalities
 
05:35:37.628 --> 05:35:37.638 align:start position:0%
like do Manchester and ASA will seek to
 
05:35:40.070 --> 05:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
Direct Banking relationships in Louis
 
05:35:42.510 --> 05:35:42.520 align:start position:0%
pet and over we were already talking
 
05:35:45.070 --> 05:35:45.080 align:start position:0%
about that before this bill came forward
 
05:35:46.510 --> 05:35:46.520 align:start position:0%
and once the bill came forward we said
 
05:35:47.708 --> 05:35:47.718 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to hold off and see
 
05:35:48.708 --> 05:35:48.718 align:start position:0%
what's going
 
05:35:51.990 --> 05:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
on once the Corpus of the pp becomes too
 
05:35:54.590 --> 05:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
small the pool will cease to exist
 
05:35:56.470 --> 05:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
economically it just won't be
 
05:35:59.788 --> 05:35:59.798 align:start position:0%
viable you have to note that there's 10
 
05:36:02.430 --> 05:36:02.440 align:start position:0%
depositors in the pool that represent
 
05:36:04.548 --> 05:36:04.558 align:start position:0%
close to 50% of the
 
05:36:08.628 --> 05:36:08.638 align:start position:0%
pool one of those I can pretty guarantee
 
05:36:11.470 --> 05:36:11.480 align:start position:0%
is the state and I can tell you a second
 
05:36:13.948 --> 05:36:13.958 align:start position:0%
one is the city of
 
05:36:16.868 --> 05:36:16.878 align:start position:0%
Dover so if this if this passes the city
 
05:36:18.628 --> 05:36:18.638 align:start position:0%
of do I'm recommending to the city
 
05:36:21.030 --> 05:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
manager and the council we go out on our
 
05:36:24.110 --> 05:36:24.120 align:start position:0%
own again and we maybe we pull with a
 
05:36:26.948 --> 05:36:26.958 align:start position:0%
couple other communities to get better
 
05:36:30.548 --> 05:36:30.558 align:start position:0%
rates so now what happens the pools
 
05:36:32.910 --> 05:36:32.920 align:start position:0%
cease to
 
05:36:34.910 --> 05:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
exist what's the impact of State
 
05:36:34.920 --> 05:36:35.990 align:start position:0%
exist what's the impact of State
Treasury

05:36:35.990 --> 05:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
Treasury
 
05:36:38.628 --> 05:36:38.638 align:start position:0%
operations state treasur
 
05:36:40.948 --> 05:36:40.958 align:start position:0%
provides almost all of the money from
 
05:36:42.868 --> 05:36:42.878 align:start position:0%
the state to municipalities through the
 
05:36:46.830 --> 05:36:46.840 align:start position:0%
P di so almost every Community was
 
05:36:49.948 --> 05:36:49.958 align:start position:0%
required to set up a pip account there's
 
05:36:52.670 --> 05:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
no checks generated anymore it's all
 
05:36:54.788 --> 05:36:54.798 align:start position:0%
electronically done what would be the
 
05:36:58.030 --> 05:36:58.040 align:start position:0%
fees to go back to issuing checks or the
 
05:37:00.270 --> 05:37:00.280 align:start position:0%
fees that would be generated in a
 
05:37:02.310 --> 05:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
regular banking relationship for wire
 
05:37:04.788 --> 05:37:04.798 align:start position:0%
transfers there are no fees in
 
05:37:07.230 --> 05:37:07.240 align:start position:0%
pedp let's take a few seconds because I
 
05:37:09.910 --> 05:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
know times of the essence how do we go
 
05:37:12.868 --> 05:37:12.878 align:start position:0%
from 250 million in the pool all of a
 
05:37:15.030 --> 05:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
sudden to 600 million well in the last
 
05:37:17.390 --> 05:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
two years there's been a huge influx of
 
05:37:19.868 --> 05:37:19.878 align:start position:0%
what everybody calls Opa money
 
05:37:21.628 --> 05:37:21.638 align:start position:0%
communities don't have to rush out the
 
05:37:24.110 --> 05:37:24.120 align:start position:0%
door to spend that they have to obligate
 
05:37:26.990 --> 05:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
it by this December 31st and then they
 
05:37:30.788 --> 05:37:30.798 align:start position:0%
have two more years to spend that so
 
05:37:33.390 --> 05:37:33.400 align:start position:0%
let's take ARA out of the equation that
 
05:37:36.390 --> 05:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
drops that 600 million let's talk about
 
05:37:37.990 --> 05:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
Trustees of trust fund
 
05:37:39.788 --> 05:37:39.798 align:start position:0%
what they can invest in they have
 
05:37:41.750 --> 05:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
capital reserve funds and they have
 
05:37:45.270 --> 05:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
trust funds they can invest with a bank
 
05:37:48.590 --> 05:37:48.600 align:start position:0%
or brokerage firm to establish their own
 
05:37:52.470 --> 05:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
little investment direct buyings and and
 
05:37:55.110 --> 05:37:55.120 align:start position:0%
and results so that further arose that
 
05:37:57.990 --> 05:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
600 million and in the scheme of things
 
05:38:00.150 --> 05:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
if this bill was to pass you'd probably
 
05:38:03.590 --> 05:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
be back to about that $250 million range
 
05:38:06.030 --> 05:38:06.040 align:start position:0%
maybe even less what's what's the
 
05:38:09.150 --> 05:38:09.160 align:start position:0%
economic benefit
 
05:38:10.868 --> 05:38:10.878 align:start position:0%
I will provide my written comments to
 
05:38:13.990 --> 05:38:14.000 align:start position:0%

by the banking Department uh in 2020
 
05:39:21.990 --> 05:39:22.000 align:start position:0%

cards I think I
 
05:41:28.468 --> 05:41:28.478 align:start position:0%
counted um five for and 12
 
05:41:33.030 --> 05:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
against with the signup sheet it was 23
 
05:41:35.750 --> 05:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
for and 12
 
05:41:37.990 --> 05:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
against so we're about where we were
 
05:41:41.030 --> 05:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
before this is a very
 
05:41:43.868 --> 05:41:43.878 align:start position:0%
puzzling proposal I thank you all for
 
05:41:45.990 --> 05:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
your attendance we'll close the hearing
 
05:41:48.628 --> 05:41:48.638 align:start position:0%
and and uh it will be be going again I
 
05:41:52.990 --> 05:41:53.000 align:start position:0%
think May 7th to division 1 for further
 
05:41:53.000 --> 05:41:54.910 align:start position:0%
think May 7th to division 1 for further
testimony

05:41:54.910 --> 05:41:54.920 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
05:42:00.430 --> 05:42:00.440 align:start position:0%
okay so now um as soon as we clear out a
 
05:42:02.830 --> 05:42:02.840 align:start position:0%
little bit we have Senate Bill
 
05:42:05.868 --> 05:42:05.878 align:start position:0%
499 which I said I'd begin at 3:30 but
 
05:42:07.948 --> 05:42:07.958 align:start position:0%
it's a little later than that
 
05:42:09.628 --> 05:42:09.638 align:start position:0%
so Senate Bill
 
05:42:13.948 --> 05:42:13.958 align:start position:0%
499 has Senator Whitley come back yes
 
05:42:20.030 --> 05:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:22.510 --> 05:42:22.520 align:start position:0%
right so we'll open the hearing on
 
05:42:25.868 --> 05:42:25.878 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 499 and recognize Senator
 
05:42:30.070 --> 05:42:30.080 align:start position:0%

district 15 which you're sitting in
 
05:42:40.390 --> 05:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
right now the wonderful city of
 
05:42:41.708 --> 05:42:41.718 align:start position:0%
conquered and the surrounding towns of
 
05:42:44.070 --> 05:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
bow and hackington today I'm proud to
 
05:42:46.310 --> 05:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
introduce to you the bipartisan
 
05:42:48.270 --> 05:42:48.280 align:start position:0%
hunger-free New Hampshire act Senate
 
05:42:48.280 --> 05:42:49.750 align:start position:0%
hunger-free New Hampshire act Senate
Bill

05:42:49.750 --> 05:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
05:42:53.150 --> 05:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
499 so um I'm also passing around sort
 
05:42:56.190 --> 05:42:56.200 align:start position:0%
of a a cheat sheet for you this is a
 
05:42:58.590 --> 05:42:58.600 align:start position:0%
comprehensive Bill to address hunger in
 
05:43:00.430 --> 05:43:00.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so I wanted to you to have
 
05:43:01.910 --> 05:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
this cheat
 
05:43:04.628 --> 05:43:04.638 align:start position:0%
sheet so just to put this bill into
 
05:43:07.830 --> 05:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
context I would say on equivocally that
 
05:43:09.628 --> 05:43:09.638 align:start position:0%
there are a few issues that keep me up
 
05:43:12.350 --> 05:43:12.360 align:start position:0%
at night more than food insecurity in
 
05:43:14.590 --> 05:43:14.600 align:start position:0%
our state it really does seem
 
05:43:17.868 --> 05:43:17.878 align:start position:0%
unimaginable to me in a state like ours
 
05:43:20.548 --> 05:43:20.558 align:start position:0%
but far too many people in New Hampshire
 
05:43:22.708 --> 05:43:22.718 align:start position:0%
just do not have enough food for
 
05:43:25.230 --> 05:43:25.240 align:start position:0%
themselves or their families in October
 
05:43:27.788 --> 05:43:27.798 align:start position:0%
2023 over half of New Hampshire family
 
05:43:30.390 --> 05:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire children and 44% of
 
05:43:32.230 --> 05:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
adults living in households that
 
05:43:34.830 --> 05:43:34.840 align:start position:0%
reported having insufficient Foods
 
05:43:37.788 --> 05:43:37.798 align:start position:0%
that's staggering no one have to wonder
 
05:43:40.590 --> 05:43:40.600 align:start position:0%
where their next meal will come from yet
 
05:43:42.150 --> 05:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
far too many Granite Staters have to
 
05:43:44.310 --> 05:43:44.320 align:start position:0%
choose between food and other critical
 
05:43:48.468 --> 05:43:48.478 align:start position:0%
needs like medicine electricity or even
 
05:43:51.868 --> 05:43:51.878 align:start position:0%
child care I would ask that for a moment
 
05:43:53.590 --> 05:43:53.600 align:start position:0%
you put yourselves in the shoes of a
 
05:43:56.468 --> 05:43:56.478 align:start position:0%
parent who has to put their children to
 
05:43:56.478 --> 05:43:57.430 align:start position:0%
parent who has to put their children to
bed

05:43:57.430 --> 05:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
bed
 
05:43:59.948 --> 05:43:59.958 align:start position:0%
hungry as the parent of a 10-year-old I
 
05:44:01.628 --> 05:44:01.638 align:start position:0%
can't even imagine that
 
05:44:03.868 --> 05:44:03.878 align:start position:0%
feeling or put yourselves in the shoes
 
05:44:05.788 --> 05:44:05.798 align:start position:0%
of an elderly parent or grandparent who
 
05:44:07.628 --> 05:44:07.638 align:start position:0%
has worked their entire life
 
05:44:09.510 --> 05:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
yet struggles to make ends meet and has
 
05:44:11.830 --> 05:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
to choose between a roof over their head
 
05:44:11.840 --> 05:44:12.750 align:start position:0%
to choose between a roof over their head
and

05:44:12.750 --> 05:44:12.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:44:15.190 --> 05:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
groceries we simply can't ignore that
 
05:44:18.270 --> 05:44:18.280 align:start position:0%
hunger is happening in New
 
05:44:21.310 --> 05:44:21.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but I would say that we are
 
05:44:23.868 --> 05:44:23.878 align:start position:0%
not helpless to solve this problem we
 
05:44:25.868 --> 05:44:25.878 align:start position:0%
know how to fix the problem of hunger
 
05:44:28.390 --> 05:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
and food insecurity we just need the
 
05:44:31.150 --> 05:44:31.160 align:start position:0%
political will to make that happen the
 
05:44:33.110 --> 05:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
bill before you today includes a
 
05:44:36.110 --> 05:44:36.120 align:start position:0%
comprehensive set of measures to reduce
 
05:44:39.270 --> 05:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
food insecurity for children people with
 
05:44:41.750 --> 05:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
disabilities and older adults in New
 
05:44:44.430 --> 05:44:44.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and this is smart policy
 
05:44:46.350 --> 05:44:46.360 align:start position:0%
because it will support our schools
 
05:44:48.230 --> 05:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
leverage federal dollars which support
 
05:44:49.788 --> 05:44:49.798 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's local
 
05:44:51.990 --> 05:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
economy and invest in New Hampshire's
 
05:44:52.000 --> 05:44:53.190 align:start position:0%
economy and invest in New Hampshire's
economic

05:44:53.190 --> 05:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
economic
 
05:44:56.190 --> 05:44:56.200 align:start position:0%
future the first step in this process is
 
05:44:58.468 --> 05:44:58.478 align:start position:0%
ensuring that everyone who is eligible
 
05:45:01.468 --> 05:45:01.478 align:start position:0%
for existing Federal nutrition programs
 
05:45:04.510 --> 05:45:04.520 align:start position:0%
is actually enrolled unfortunately the
 
05:45:06.590 --> 05:45:06.600 align:start position:0%
way we're doing things in New Hampshire
 
05:45:09.350 --> 05:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
now is leaving too many of our neighbors
 
05:45:11.510 --> 05:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
including children older adults people
 
05:45:14.070 --> 05:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
with disabilities just disconnected from
 
05:45:16.430 --> 05:45:16.440 align:start position:0%
the resources that already exists to
 
05:45:19.150 --> 05:45:19.160 align:start position:0%
help them this bill before you the
 
05:45:21.150 --> 05:45:21.160 align:start position:0%
hunger-free New Hampshire act would help
 
05:45:24.230 --> 05:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
to feed more children meals in school
 
05:45:25.670 --> 05:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
and help to ensure that they are not
 
05:45:27.030 --> 05:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
hungry during the
 
05:45:29.510 --> 05:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
summer it would also help more older
 
05:45:31.590 --> 05:45:31.600 align:start position:0%
adults and people with disabilities to
 
05:45:33.868 --> 05:45:33.878 align:start position:0%
connect to programs that help them avoid
 
05:45:33.878 --> 05:45:34.990 align:start position:0%
connect to programs that help them avoid
food

05:45:34.990 --> 05:45:35.000 align:start position:0%
food
 
05:45:37.910 --> 05:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
insecurity by making mod Investments to
 
05:45:40.150 --> 05:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
leverage federal dollars and by removing
 
05:45:43.750 --> 05:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
barriers we absolutely can end Hunger in
 
05:45:46.270 --> 05:45:46.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire this comprehensive
 
05:45:48.788 --> 05:45:48.798 align:start position:0%
anti-hunger legislation was crafted to
 
05:45:51.868 --> 05:45:51.878 align:start position:0%
remove barriers to streamline program
 
05:45:53.708 --> 05:45:53.718 align:start position:0%
Administration and increased
 
05:45:55.868 --> 05:45:55.878 align:start position:0%
participation in this critical n
 
05:45:58.390 --> 05:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
nutrition program I want to thank the
 
05:46:00.110 --> 05:46:00.120 align:start position:0%
Departments of education and health and
 
05:46:02.750 --> 05:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
human services for all of their work on
 
05:46:04.948 --> 05:46:04.958 align:start position:0%
behalf of New Hampshire children and
 
05:46:07.310 --> 05:46:07.320 align:start position:0%
families and adults with disabilities
 
05:46:10.468 --> 05:46:10.478 align:start position:0%
and for their partnership in this work
 
05:46:13.350 --> 05:46:13.360 align:start position:0%
this bill has gone through extensive
 
05:46:15.468 --> 05:46:15.478 align:start position:0%
work in the Senate you will see that is
 
05:46:18.030 --> 05:46:18.040 align:start position:0%
very different than as introduced we
 
05:46:20.070 --> 05:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
were we were very thoughtful about
 
05:46:22.868 --> 05:46:22.878 align:start position:0%
prioritizing those areas that were most
 
05:46:25.430 --> 05:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
critical and identifying the sources of
 
05:46:28.510 --> 05:46:28.520 align:start position:0%
funding for those particular programs I
 
05:46:30.430 --> 05:46:30.440 align:start position:0%
am not the expert in these various
 
05:46:32.628 --> 05:46:32.638 align:start position:0%
programs there are certainly folks
 
05:46:35.590 --> 05:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
behind me that can speak to the
 
05:46:38.350 --> 05:46:38.360 align:start position:0%
importance and impact of these programs
 
05:46:41.230 --> 05:46:41.240 align:start position:0%
and why these some additional modest
 
05:46:43.070 --> 05:46:43.080 align:start position:0%
funds are necessary to leverage the
 
05:46:45.070 --> 05:46:45.080 align:start position:0%
additional dollars with that said I am
 
05:46:46.948 --> 05:46:46.958 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions and look forward
 
05:46:48.708 --> 05:46:48.718 align:start position:0%
to a continued conversation on Senate
 
05:46:51.708 --> 05:46:51.718 align:start position:0%
Bill 499 thank you thank you Senator
 
05:46:54.190 --> 05:46:54.200 align:start position:0%
representative papichi M thank you Mr
 
05:46:55.830 --> 05:46:55.840 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you Senator Whitley
 
05:46:59.350 --> 05:46:59.360 align:start position:0%
for being here um I just am trying to
 
05:47:01.430 --> 05:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
understand the lifl let in front of me
 
05:47:03.510 --> 05:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
States a certain number of children in
 
05:47:05.830 --> 05:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
our state that face hunger is that the
 
05:47:08.150 --> 05:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
number of children that that are um
 
05:47:09.788 --> 05:47:09.798 align:start position:0%
considered to be food
 
05:47:12.868 --> 05:47:12.878 align:start position:0%
insufficient so that is data that um was
 
05:47:15.070 --> 05:47:15.080 align:start position:0%
T you're talking about the over half of
 
05:47:18.190 --> 05:47:18.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:21.510 --> 05:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
children one in 12 so that is data that
 
05:47:24.590 --> 05:47:24.600 align:start position:0%
is data that um has been provided by the
 
05:47:26.788 --> 05:47:26.798 align:start position:0%
by various surveys at the federal level
 
05:47:28.788 --> 05:47:28.798 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hunger Solutions is here
 
05:47:31.070 --> 05:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
and they they are the ones that do a lot
 
05:47:32.868 --> 05:47:32.878 align:start position:0%
of that collection of that data and they
 
05:47:34.990 --> 05:47:35.000 align:start position:0%
have on their website sort of I will
 
05:47:36.990 --> 05:47:37.000 align:start position:0%
then reserve my so I think with them
 
05:47:38.590 --> 05:47:38.600 align:start position:0%
better to speak to the data thank you
 
05:47:40.468 --> 05:47:40.478 align:start position:0%
very much for that thank you
 
05:47:42.548 --> 05:47:42.558 align:start position:0%
yeah further questions from the
 
05:47:45.468 --> 05:47:45.478 align:start position:0%
committee repres representative Edwards
 
05:47:47.270 --> 05:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh it's good seeing
 
05:47:50.390 --> 05:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
you again Senator um so I I wonder if
 
05:47:52.350 --> 05:47:52.360 align:start position:0%
you think your bill goes far enough
 
05:47:54.788 --> 05:47:54.798 align:start position:0%
because you've identified one of the
 
05:47:58.310 --> 05:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
social determinants of of Health uh food
 
05:48:01.150 --> 05:48:01.160 align:start position:0%
which is vital there are other social
 
05:48:03.030 --> 05:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
determinants of Health too you mentioned
 
05:48:05.830 --> 05:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
electricity as as a tradeoff families
 
05:48:08.990 --> 05:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
are making MH there's uh prescriptions
 
05:48:12.310 --> 05:48:12.320 align:start position:0%
housing clothing Transportation
 
05:48:14.310 --> 05:48:14.320 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we be doing those things also
 
05:48:17.030 --> 05:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
if we're going to be responsible for
 
05:48:19.390 --> 05:48:19.400 align:start position:0%
feeding everyone during the summer
 
05:48:21.468 --> 05:48:21.478 align:start position:0%
through the school system thank you I
 
05:48:23.708 --> 05:48:23.718 align:start position:0%
mean you know of course there are
 
05:48:25.270 --> 05:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
priorities that families have to make
 
05:48:27.150 --> 05:48:27.160 align:start position:0%
and there are priorities that this legis
 
05:48:29.270 --> 05:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
legislature has to make and to me you
 
05:48:31.270 --> 05:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
know making sure that children are fed
 
05:48:34.750 --> 05:48:34.760 align:start position:0%
seems like a basic need in my
 
05:48:37.030 --> 05:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
opinion thank you for the question
 
05:48:39.070 --> 05:48:39.080 align:start position:0%
further questions from
 
05:48:41.310 --> 05:48:41.320 align:start position:0%
committee thank you Senator thank you
 
05:48:47.708 --> 05:48:47.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:50.670 --> 05:48:50.680 align:start position:0%
BridgeWalk how that I read your number
 
05:48:53.670 --> 05:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
right Mr chairman committee members uh
 
05:48:56.310 --> 05:48:56.320 align:start position:0%
Aubrey Friedman from Bridgewater I speak
 
05:48:59.948 --> 05:48:59.958 align:start position:0%
in opposition to this bill uh my main a
 
05:49:04.270 --> 05:49:04.280 align:start position:0%
few reasons but my main thing is this is
 
05:49:06.948 --> 05:49:06.958 align:start position:0%
parents when you are responsible for for
 
05:49:11.708 --> 05:49:11.718 align:start position:0%
kids providing food is one of your basic
 
05:49:14.590 --> 05:49:14.600 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and we already have the
 
05:49:16.270 --> 05:49:16.280 align:start position:0%
and the problem with these government
 
05:49:18.270 --> 05:49:18.280 align:start position:0%
programs is when you start them it
 
05:49:21.390 --> 05:49:21.400 align:start position:0%
started off the lunch program then it's
 
05:49:23.868 --> 05:49:23.878 align:start position:0%
breakfast and the co they kind of you
 
05:49:25.590 --> 05:49:25.600 align:start position:0%
know gave it to everybody so that's a
 
05:49:28.310 --> 05:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
different thing now we're going into the
 
05:49:31.948 --> 05:49:31.958 align:start position:0%
summer adding the summer they expand and
 
05:49:34.868 --> 05:49:34.878 align:start position:0%
expand do parents not need I'm surprised
 
05:49:37.150 --> 05:49:37.160 align:start position:0%
they don't have dinner maybe that'll be
 
05:49:38.990 --> 05:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
coming next if you think about it
 
05:49:42.230 --> 05:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
there's no end to it parents if you are
 
05:49:44.110 --> 05:49:44.120 align:start position:0%
taking Char if you choose to have
 
05:49:47.628 --> 05:49:47.638 align:start position:0%
children or maybe some family situation
 
05:49:50.270 --> 05:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
occurs where you are U you're going to
 
05:49:52.990 --> 05:49:53.000 align:start position:0%
be guardians or whatever it's your
 
05:49:55.788 --> 05:49:55.798 align:start position:0%
responsibility to provide for the needs
 
05:49:58.868 --> 05:49:58.878 align:start position:0%
of your family and you've taken that on
 
05:50:00.510 --> 05:50:00.520 align:start position:0%
and that's your response not your
 
05:50:03.990 --> 05:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
neighbors it's not taxpayers it's yours
 
05:50:07.310 --> 05:50:07.320 align:start position:0%
this bill expands on
 
05:50:10.590 --> 05:50:10.600 align:start position:0%
uh it's making people it would would
 
05:50:12.910 --> 05:50:12.920 align:start position:0%
make uh families more dependent on
 
05:50:14.548 --> 05:50:14.558 align:start position:0%
government we should be working the
 
05:50:17.390 --> 05:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
opposite to have people to be more
 
05:50:19.910 --> 05:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
independent more self-sufficient and to
 
05:50:23.030 --> 05:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
be able to be Su successful enough to
 
05:50:25.548 --> 05:50:25.558 align:start position:0%
provide for your family so it moves in
 
05:50:27.430 --> 05:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
the wrong direction that's the first
 
05:50:30.948 --> 05:50:30.958 align:start position:0%
thing now as far as cost the state part
 
05:50:32.990 --> 05:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
of it there's a state part and a federal
 
05:50:35.468 --> 05:50:35.478 align:start position:0%
part the state part it's coming from
 
05:50:38.510 --> 05:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
taxes so tax tax other tax taxpayers are
 
05:50:41.230 --> 05:50:41.240 align:start position:0%
going to be paying for it which makes it
 
05:50:43.548 --> 05:50:43.558 align:start position:0%
it more expensive for everybody the
 
05:50:43.558 --> 05:50:44.670 align:start position:0%
it more expensive for everybody the
federal

05:50:44.670 --> 05:50:44.680 align:start position:0%
federal
 
05:50:47.150 --> 05:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
part that's the inflation tax the
 
05:50:49.628 --> 05:50:49.638 align:start position:0%
federal government is is pushing 35
 
05:50:51.948 --> 05:50:51.958 align:start position:0%
trillion in the negative and and
 
05:50:54.990 --> 05:50:55.000 align:start position:0%
increasing all the time so if it's
 
05:50:58.548 --> 05:50:58.558 align:start position:0%
federal dollars they're not free it's
 
05:51:00.868 --> 05:51:00.878 align:start position:0%
taxpayer it's actually all the citizens
 
05:51:03.070 --> 05:51:03.080 align:start position:0%
of the United States are contributing to
 
05:51:07.230 --> 05:51:07.240 align:start position:0%
that there's not nothing free here uh
 
05:51:07.240 --> 05:51:08.350 align:start position:0%
that there's not nothing free here uh
okay

05:51:08.350 --> 05:51:08.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:51:11.548 --> 05:51:11.558 align:start position:0%
now the thing with the school uh lunches
 
05:51:13.548 --> 05:51:13.558 align:start position:0%
and all that from what I've heard
 
05:51:16.670 --> 05:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
there's actually a lot of food is
 
05:51:18.230 --> 05:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
actually thrown away because the kids
 
05:51:20.910 --> 05:51:20.920 align:start position:0%
don't like it so the thing is if you pay
 
05:51:23.750 --> 05:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
for it your parents pay for it you are
 
05:51:26.030 --> 05:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
going to be more responsible and less
 
05:51:28.270 --> 05:51:28.280 align:start position:0%
likely to waste it it makes me think of
 
05:51:30.670 --> 05:51:30.680 align:start position:0%
like going to a buffet you don't pay
 
05:51:33.310 --> 05:51:33.320 align:start position:0%
anymore if you fill up your plates so
 
05:51:36.230 --> 05:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
people tend to kind of leave some but if
 
05:51:38.150 --> 05:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
if you're paying for it exactly you're
 
05:51:40.230 --> 05:51:40.240 align:start position:0%
not going to waste it so that's how I
 
05:51:42.990 --> 05:51:43.000 align:start position:0%
see the expansion of this program it's
 
05:51:44.350 --> 05:51:44.360 align:start position:0%
going there's going to be a lot of waste
 
05:51:45.830 --> 05:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
and from what I've heard of our like our
 
05:51:48.030 --> 05:51:48.040 align:start position:0%
student rep at the school board meetings
 
05:51:49.830 --> 05:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
she complained about our the school
 
05:51:51.548 --> 05:51:51.558 align:start position:0%
meals there and that the kids don't like
 
05:51:53.150 --> 05:51:53.160 align:start position:0%
it and they're throwing it away not all
 
05:51:54.948 --> 05:51:54.958 align:start position:0%
the time but I think there would this
 
05:51:58.670 --> 05:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
would be encouraging waste and lastly I
 
05:52:00.830 --> 05:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
think actually childhood obesity is a
 
05:52:03.270 --> 05:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
bigger problem than hunger yes there is
 
05:52:05.270 --> 05:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
hunger in New Hampshire there's poverty
 
05:52:08.430 --> 05:52:08.440 align:start position:0%
there's no question but we have churches
 
05:52:11.750 --> 05:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
we have food banks where uh people can
 
05:52:14.590 --> 05:52:14.600 align:start position:0%
go and that's voluntarily
 
05:52:17.350 --> 05:52:17.360 align:start position:0%
given uh you know donations that's the
 
05:52:20.750 --> 05:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
better way people feel more grateful and
 
05:52:22.628 --> 05:52:22.638 align:start position:0%
not like when it becomes a government
 
05:52:24.590 --> 05:52:24.600 align:start position:0%
benefit then it becomes like an
 
05:52:28.030 --> 05:52:28.040 align:start position:0%
entitlement or eventually a right it's a
 
05:52:31.110 --> 05:52:31.120 align:start position:0%
right to food so those are the problems
 
05:52:33.230 --> 05:52:33.240 align:start position:0%
I see with this bill and that's why I I
 
05:52:35.910 --> 05:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
oppose it thank you Mr fredman are there
 
05:52:38.548 --> 05:52:38.558 align:start position:0%

today representing the thousands of save
 
05:53:01.350 --> 05:53:01.360 align:start position:0%
the children Action Network supporters
 
05:53:04.468 --> 05:53:04.478 align:start position:0%

arm of save the children and we are are
 
05:53:08.548 --> 05:53:08.558 align:start position:0%
building bipartisan support to make sure
 
05:53:10.390 --> 05:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
that every child has a strong start in
 
05:53:12.430 --> 05:53:12.440 align:start position:0%
life and that includes working to end
 
05:53:13.910 --> 05:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
Hunger right here in New Hampshire and
 
05:53:15.110 --> 05:53:15.120 align:start position:0%
across the
 
05:53:17.830 --> 05:53:17.840 align:start position:0%
country I think we all agree that no
 
05:53:20.750 --> 05:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
child should go hungry in our state and
 
05:53:24.150 --> 05:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
voters agree with that as well in 2022
 
05:53:26.830 --> 05:53:26.840 align:start position:0%
scan conducted polls of rural voters in
 
05:53:28.390 --> 05:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
which they shared that food prices are
 
05:53:30.230 --> 05:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest problems facing their
 
05:53:32.510 --> 05:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
families um and in the written testimony
 
05:53:34.030 --> 05:53:34.040 align:start position:0%
I've linked to that poll so you can see
 
05:53:36.708 --> 05:53:36.718 align:start position:0%
that in more depth online
 
05:53:38.510 --> 05:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
um half of all of the parents pulled
 
05:53:40.070 --> 05:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
said that they are struggling to afford
 
05:53:41.628 --> 05:53:41.638 align:start position:0%
food for their family and a majority of
 
05:53:43.310 --> 05:53:43.320 align:start position:0%
the voters pulled stated that they are
 
05:53:44.990 --> 05:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
worried that they might not be able to
 
05:53:46.990 --> 05:53:47.000 align:start position:0%
afford enough food to feed themselves
 
05:53:49.548 --> 05:53:49.558 align:start position:0%
and their family over the next year and
 
05:53:51.830 --> 05:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
census data that has been mentioned um
 
05:53:53.548 --> 05:53:53.558 align:start position:0%
that's been shared by uh New Hampshire
 
05:53:55.468 --> 05:53:55.478 align:start position:0%
hunger Solutions shows the same story
 
05:53:57.990 --> 05:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
finding that 42% of New Hampshire
 
05:53:59.510 --> 05:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
children lived in households that
 
05:54:02.070 --> 05:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
reported having insufficient
 
05:54:05.190 --> 05:54:05.200 align:start position:0%
food hunger is devastating for growing
 
05:54:06.990 --> 05:54:07.000 align:start position:0%
minds and bodies
 
05:54:09.110 --> 05:54:09.120 align:start position:0%
malnutrition stunts more than kids
 
05:54:11.230 --> 05:54:11.240 align:start position:0%
development it stunts their Futures as
 
05:54:13.868 --> 05:54:13.878 align:start position:0%
well hungry children are more likely to
 
05:54:15.990 --> 05:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
struggle in class repeat a grade or miss
 
05:54:18.390 --> 05:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
school entirely without enough to eat
 
05:54:19.548 --> 05:54:19.558 align:start position:0%
they may never reach their full
 
05:54:21.270 --> 05:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
potential when children can grow up
 
05:54:22.910 --> 05:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
healthier and stronger our economy and
 
05:54:24.468 --> 05:54:24.478 align:start position:0%
our nation grow healthier and stronger
 
05:54:28.548 --> 05:54:28.558 align:start position:0%
as well s SP 499 is a comprehensive and
 
05:54:30.708 --> 05:54:30.718 align:start position:0%
bipartisan anti-hunger legislation that
 
05:54:33.110 --> 05:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
will benefit folks across the state I'm
 
05:54:34.548 --> 05:54:34.558 align:start position:0%
here to advocate for the granite state
 
05:54:35.830 --> 05:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
kids who will be impacted by the
 
05:54:35.840 --> 05:54:37.868 align:start position:0%
kids who will be impacted by the
legislation

05:54:37.868 --> 05:54:37.878 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
05:54:39.310 --> 05:54:39.320 align:start position:0%
firstly this bill will improve
 
05:54:40.830 --> 05:54:40.840 align:start position:0%
participation in school breakfast
 
05:54:43.788 --> 05:54:43.798 align:start position:0%
programs according to a 2023 report from
 
05:54:47.110 --> 05:54:47.120 align:start position:0%
the food research and action center
 
05:54:50.270 --> 05:54:50.280 align:start position:0%
95,3 37 New Hampshire students ate
 
05:54:52.788 --> 05:54:52.798 align:start position:0%
School provided lunch in the 2122 school
 
05:54:54.628 --> 05:54:54.638 align:start position:0%
year but fewer than half of those
 
05:54:56.868 --> 05:54:56.878 align:start position:0%
students also participated in a school
 
05:54:59.110 --> 05:54:59.120 align:start position:0%
breakfast which puts us in the bottom 16
 
05:55:01.030 --> 05:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
states in the country for
 
05:55:03.468 --> 05:55:03.478 align:start position:0%
this this bill will address the issue by
 
05:55:05.350 --> 05:55:05.360 align:start position:0%
requiring schools with free and reduced
 
05:55:07.788 --> 05:55:07.798 align:start position:0%
percentages above 10% to offer breakfast
 
05:55:10.310 --> 05:55:10.320 align:start position:0%
at school it also incentivizes the
 
05:55:12.030 --> 05:55:12.040 align:start position:0%
breakfast after the Bell program which
 
05:55:13.750 --> 05:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
allows kids to pick up breakfast and eat
 
05:55:15.430 --> 05:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
it during their first class giving them
 
05:55:17.390 --> 05:55:17.400 align:start position:0%
more time to eat increasing
 
05:55:19.030 --> 05:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
participation in school breakfast brings
 
05:55:20.548 --> 05:55:20.558 align:start position:0%
in more federal dollars to support
 
05:55:20.558 --> 05:55:21.868 align:start position:0%
in more federal dollars to support
feeding

05:55:21.868 --> 05:55:21.878 align:start position:0%
feeding
 
05:55:24.270 --> 05:55:24.280 align:start position:0%
kids the second way this bill approaches
 
05:55:26.190 --> 05:55:26.200 align:start position:0%
child hunger is by ensuring access to
 
05:55:28.030 --> 05:55:28.040 align:start position:0%
school meals it requires schools to
 
05:55:30.070 --> 05:55:30.080 align:start position:0%
allow online applications which is
 
05:55:33.430 --> 05:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
helpful for busy parents it also uses
 
05:55:34.868 --> 05:55:34.878 align:start position:0%
additional reimbursements as an
 
05:55:36.590 --> 05:55:36.600 align:start position:0%
incentive for schools to partip in the
 
05:55:38.430 --> 05:55:38.440 align:start position:0%
federal reimbursement programs making it
 
05:55:40.750 --> 05:55:40.760 align:start position:0%
really an investment in childhood uh
 
05:55:43.868 --> 05:55:43.878 align:start position:0%
nutrition and lastly as mentioned uh it
 
05:55:45.230 --> 05:55:45.240 align:start position:0%
would require the state to participate
 
05:55:47.670 --> 05:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
in summer EBT which enhances access to
 
05:55:50.270 --> 05:55:50.280 align:start position:0%
food in between school years please vote
 
05:55:52.590 --> 05:55:52.600 align:start position:0%
a to pass if you agree that every child
 
05:55:54.830 --> 05:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
deserves access to nutritious meals
 
05:55:56.270 --> 05:55:56.280 align:start position:0%
Granite State kids are worth the
 
05:55:58.310 --> 05:55:58.320 align:start position:0%
investment I'm happy to take questions
 
05:55:59.350 --> 05:55:59.360 align:start position:0%
although I do think some of my
 
05:56:00.868 --> 05:56:00.878 align:start position:0%
colleagues in the back may be able to
 
05:56:02.110 --> 05:56:02.120 align:start position:0%
answer more of the specifics
 
05:56:03.990 --> 05:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire for a question
 
05:56:05.468 --> 05:56:05.478 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
05:56:07.868 --> 05:56:07.878 align:start position:0%
coming can you describe the summer
 
05:56:10.070 --> 05:56:10.080 align:start position:0%
program a little bit more exactly how
 
05:56:13.150 --> 05:56:13.160 align:start position:0%
does that get food to students um I'm
 
05:56:14.990 --> 05:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
going to defer that to some of my
 
05:56:16.548 --> 05:56:16.558 align:start position:0%
colleagues who are more familiar with
 
05:56:17.628 --> 05:56:17.638 align:start position:0%
the the nuances of the different
 
05:56:19.670 --> 05:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
programs sorry I'm happy to look it up
 
05:56:21.788 --> 05:56:21.798 align:start position:0%
though if if they can't
 
05:56:24.270 --> 05:56:24.280 align:start position:0%
answer thank you for your testimony

my name is Sam Hawkins I'm the public

through support education and advocacy
 
05:56:52.510 --> 05:56:52.520 align:start position:0%
on behalf of Nami New Hampshire I'm here
 
05:56:54.628 --> 05:56:54.638 align:start position:0%
today to speak in support of Senate Bill
 
05:56:57.150 --> 05:56:57.160 align:start position:0%
499 a variety of complex factors
 
05:56:58.670 --> 05:56:58.680 align:start position:0%
contribute to an individual's mental
 
05:57:00.750 --> 05:57:00.760 align:start position:0%
health but one key determinant is food
 
05:57:02.990 --> 05:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
security and hunger when our basic needs
 
05:57:04.948 --> 05:57:04.958 align:start position:0%
are not met it makes it more difficult
 
05:57:06.830 --> 05:57:06.840 align:start position:0%
to maintain all aspects of our health
 
05:57:09.190 --> 05:57:09.200 align:start position:0%
including our mental health in children
 
05:57:10.788 --> 05:57:10.798 align:start position:0%
especially the connection between hunger
 
05:57:12.868 --> 05:57:12.878 align:start position:0%
and mental health is clear a study
 
05:57:14.390 --> 05:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
published by the American Academy of
 
05:57:16.310 --> 05:57:16.320 align:start position:0%
Pediatrics found that severe hunger is
 
05:57:18.310 --> 05:57:18.320 align:start position:0%
associated with higher reported anxiety
 
05:57:19.750 --> 05:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
and depression among school-aged
 
05:57:21.750 --> 05:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
children including reported rates of
 
05:57:23.510 --> 05:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
anxiety nearly double of that of
 
05:57:26.310 --> 05:57:26.320 align:start position:0%
children with no hunger just as food's
 
05:57:28.150 --> 05:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
insecurity may affect mental health
 
05:57:29.788 --> 05:57:29.798 align:start position:0%
one's mental health can also impact
 
05:57:31.590 --> 05:57:31.600 align:start position:0%
their ability to work and afford food
 
05:57:33.830 --> 05:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
for themselves and their families
 
05:57:35.110 --> 05:57:35.120 align:start position:0%
research by the Department of
 
05:57:36.708 --> 05:57:36.718 align:start position:0%
Agriculture found that adults with a
 
05:57:38.628 --> 05:57:38.638 align:start position:0%
mental health disability are up to five
 
05:57:40.430 --> 05:57:40.440 align:start position:0%
times more likely to live in a household
 
05:57:41.628 --> 05:57:41.638 align:start position:0%
that is food
 
05:57:43.910 --> 05:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
insecure by addressing food insecurity
 
05:57:45.788 --> 05:57:45.798 align:start position:0%
and other social determinants of Health
 
05:57:47.750 --> 05:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
we have the opportunity to ensure that
 
05:57:49.150 --> 05:57:49.160 align:start position:0%
individuals and their families have the
 
05:57:52.670 --> 05:57:52.680 align:start position:0%
chance to get and stay well s499 does
 
05:57:54.590 --> 05:57:54.600 align:start position:0%
just that for these reasons nomin New

hunger and for

05:58:48.430 --> 05:58:48.440 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um my name is
 
05:58:50.310 --> 05:58:50.320 align:start position:0%
Laura milikin I am the executive
 
05:58:51.830 --> 05:58:51.840 align:start position:0%
director of New Hampshire hunger
 
05:58:54.708 --> 05:58:54.718 align:start position:0%
solution we're a nonpartisan nonprofit
 
05:58:56.750 --> 05:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
uh organization advocating to end Hunger
 
05:59:00.910 --> 05:59:00.920 align:start position:0%
in the state um and uh I think that
 
05:59:03.070 --> 05:59:03.080 align:start position:0%
you've heard from others here that um
 
05:59:04.830 --> 05:59:04.840 align:start position:0%
hunger is high in the state right now
 
05:59:07.948 --> 05:59:07.958 align:start position:0%
Rising food housing and child care costs
 
05:59:09.510 --> 05:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
and many other costs are straining
 
05:59:11.468 --> 05:59:11.478 align:start position:0%
budgets of granite sters and making too
 
05:59:12.750 --> 05:59:12.760 align:start position:0%
many people food
 
05:59:17.030 --> 05:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
insecure s499 invests General funds to
 
05:59:18.910 --> 05:59:18.920 align:start position:0%
leverage a high number of federal
 
05:59:23.070 --> 05:59:23.080 align:start position:0%
dollars to uh try to solve hunger and
 
05:59:25.070 --> 05:59:25.080 align:start position:0%
they'll have a positive effect on New
 
05:59:29.750 --> 05:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's economy because uh
 
05:59:32.628 --> 05:59:32.638 align:start position:0%
the particularly for snap the dollars
 
05:59:32.638 --> 05:59:34.390 align:start position:0%
the particularly for snap the dollars
are

05:59:34.390 --> 05:59:34.400 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:59:37.390 --> 05:59:37.400 align:start position:0%
provided they can only be spent for food
 
05:59:39.590 --> 05:59:39.600 align:start position:0%
they're spent in the local economy the
 
05:59:42.910 --> 05:59:42.920 align:start position:0%
return on investment is high there are
 
05:59:45.190 --> 05:59:45.200 align:start position:0%
three pieces that are currently funded
 
05:59:47.548 --> 05:59:47.558 align:start position:0%
in the bill so the first is enabling
 
05:59:49.548 --> 05:59:49.558 align:start position:0%
children currently in the federal
 
05:59:52.590 --> 05:59:52.600 align:start position:0%
reduced price lunch category those are
 
05:59:55.070 --> 05:59:55.080 align:start position:0%
children with whose families incomes are
 
05:59:57.990 --> 05:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
between 130 and 185% of the federal
 
06:00:00.310 --> 06:00:00.320 align:start position:0%
poverty level those children would eat
 
06:00:04.910 --> 06:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
free meals so for context 185% of the
 
06:00:06.910 --> 06:00:06.920 align:start position:0%
federal poverty level means a family of
 
06:00:11.070 --> 06:00:11.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:13.948 --> 06:00:13.958 align:start position:0%
$3,833 right now at New Hampshire the
 
06:00:16.350 --> 06:00:16.360 align:start position:0%
median rent for a two-bedroom apartment
 
06:00:16.360 --> 06:00:17.910 align:start position:0%
median rent for a two-bedroom apartment
is

06:00:17.910 --> 06:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:00:22.430 --> 06:00:22.440 align:start position:0%
$1,764 or 46% of that income the median
 
06:00:24.948 --> 06:00:24.958 align:start position:0%
cost of child care for a family uh with
 
06:00:26.670 --> 06:00:26.680 align:start position:0%
an infant is
 
06:00:30.350 --> 06:00:30.360 align:start position:0%
$1,140 a month and that's 29% of the
 
06:00:33.708 --> 06:00:33.718 align:start position:0%
income of somebody who's uh at 185% of
 
06:00:36.468 --> 06:00:36.478 align:start position:0%
poverty so you can see how am might have
 
06:00:39.190 --> 06:00:39.200 align:start position:0%
a hard time paying for meals that leaves
 
06:00:41.190 --> 06:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
very little of their income for things
 
06:00:45.310 --> 06:00:45.320 align:start position:0%
like Transportation utilities internet
 
06:00:45.320 --> 06:00:46.910 align:start position:0%
like Transportation utilities internet
clothes

06:00:46.910 --> 06:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
clothes
 
06:00:50.468 --> 06:00:50.478 align:start position:0%
um so this bill in uh invests a
 
06:00:53.110 --> 06:00:53.120 align:start position:0%
relatively small amount to be sure that
 
06:00:56.230 --> 06:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
folks under 185% of poverty their
 
06:00:58.670 --> 06:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
children can eat free meals at
 
06:01:01.110 --> 06:01:01.120 align:start position:0%
school the second part is enabling the
 
06:01:03.190 --> 06:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
state's participation in summer EVT and
 
06:01:04.430 --> 06:01:04.440 align:start position:0%
there was a question about how that
 
06:01:07.990 --> 06:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
works so uh it's a new federal program
 
06:01:10.430 --> 06:01:10.440 align:start position:0%
the way that it works is that families
 
06:01:12.788 --> 06:01:12.798 align:start position:0%
whose children are eligible for free and
 
06:01:16.510 --> 06:01:16.520 align:start position:0%
reduced meals which is also under 185%
 
06:01:16.520 --> 06:01:17.310 align:start position:0%
reduced meals which is also under 185%
of

06:01:17.310 --> 06:01:17.320 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:01:20.310 --> 06:01:20.320 align:start position:0%
poverty um the federal poverty level
 
06:01:23.948 --> 06:01:23.958 align:start position:0%
would get a an EBT card just like
 
06:01:27.590 --> 06:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
snap um they could use those benefits
 
06:01:32.430 --> 06:01:32.440 align:start position:0%
only to buy food it's $40 per child per
 
06:01:34.110 --> 06:01:34.120 align:start position:0%
month for each of the three summer
 
06:01:39.110 --> 06:01:39.120 align:start position:0%
months so it's 20 uh dollars per child
 
06:01:39.120 --> 06:01:39.990 align:start position:0%
months so it's 20 uh dollars per child
per

06:01:39.990 --> 06:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
per
 
06:01:44.030 --> 06:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
summer um and those are just like Snap
 
06:01:45.868 --> 06:01:45.878 align:start position:0%
those are dollars that are immediately
 
06:01:47.830 --> 06:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
reinvested in the local economy they're
 
06:01:51.430 --> 06:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
spent only on food at the grocery store
 
06:01:53.150 --> 06:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
or other other local
 
06:01:53.160 --> 06:01:54.670 align:start position:0%
or other other local
stores

06:01:54.670 --> 06:01:54.680 align:start position:0%
stores
 
06:01:59.750 --> 06:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
um the uh um just skipping over things
 
06:02:03.070 --> 06:02:03.080 align:start position:0%
that have already been said so um and
 
06:02:05.230 --> 06:02:05.240 align:start position:0%
I've provided in the uh information that
 
06:02:07.990 --> 06:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
I've passed out um some estimates on the
 
06:02:11.990 --> 06:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
likely return on investment um based on
 
06:02:14.990 --> 06:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
the new dollars coming in on summer EBT
 
06:02:18.070 --> 06:02:18.080 align:start position:0%
um so we're talking about4 a. half
 
06:02:19.830 --> 06:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
million dollar based on the number of
 
06:02:20.990 --> 06:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
kids who are currently in free and
 
06:02:22.830 --> 06:02:22.840 align:start position:0%
reduced price meals we're talking about4
 
06:02:24.948 --> 06:02:24.958 align:start position:0%
and a. half million dollars of federal
 
06:02:26.868 --> 06:02:26.878 align:start position:0%
dollars that new federal dollars that
 
06:02:29.910 --> 06:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
would come into the state um and the
 
06:02:32.350 --> 06:02:32.360 align:start position:0%
USDA estimates a return on investment on
 
06:02:35.350 --> 06:02:35.360 align:start position:0%
those dollars of between one and a half
 
06:02:35.360 --> 06:02:36.350 align:start position:0%
those dollars of between one and a half
and

06:02:36.350 --> 06:02:36.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:02:39.390 --> 06:02:39.400 align:start position:0%
$180 per dollar invested in snap and
 
06:02:41.270 --> 06:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
summer EBT would be the
 
06:02:44.030 --> 06:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
same the third piece that is funded in
 
06:02:46.430 --> 06:02:46.440 align:start position:0%
this in the amendment is enabling New
 
06:02:48.868 --> 06:02:48.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's participation in the usda's
 
06:02:52.070 --> 06:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
elderly simplified application project
 
06:02:53.788 --> 06:02:53.798 align:start position:0%
and this would make it easier for people
 
06:02:56.070 --> 06:02:56.080 align:start position:0%
over 60 or people living with
 
06:02:58.990 --> 06:02:59.000 align:start position:0%
disabilities on fixed incomes to connect
 
06:03:01.830 --> 06:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
to the snap program it has very low
 
06:03:03.910 --> 06:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
administrative costs and in fact other
 
06:03:05.830 --> 06:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
states report that it that it actually
 
06:03:08.190 --> 06:03:08.200 align:start position:0%
reduces State administrative costs once
 
06:03:10.590 --> 06:03:10.600 align:start position:0%
implemented because people have to uh
 
06:03:12.548 --> 06:03:12.558 align:start position:0%
recertify less frequently people on
 
06:03:15.708 --> 06:03:15.718 align:start position:0%
fixed incomes incomes don't change so
 
06:03:18.868 --> 06:03:18.878 align:start position:0%
they can recertify less frequently and
 
06:03:22.430 --> 06:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
less administrative cost also um other
 
06:03:25.750 --> 06:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
states have told us that when uh they
 
06:03:28.310 --> 06:03:28.320 align:start position:0%
started the program more folks who are
 
06:03:30.430 --> 06:03:30.440 align:start position:0%
eligible for SNAP but not currently
 
06:03:33.468 --> 06:03:33.478 align:start position:0%
enrolled enroll in the program so that
 
06:03:35.350 --> 06:03:35.360 align:start position:0%
also brings additional federal dollars
 
06:03:37.030 --> 06:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
into the State and I provided some
 
06:03:39.350 --> 06:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
estimates about what the return on
 
06:03:41.110 --> 06:03:41.120 align:start position:0%
investment would
 
06:03:43.868 --> 06:03:43.878 align:start position:0%
be um so there are some other pieces in
 
06:03:46.628 --> 06:03:46.638 align:start position:0%
the bill that are not funded at uh at
 
06:03:48.510 --> 06:03:48.520 align:start position:0%
currently they they you can see that
 
06:03:51.830 --> 06:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
they're funded at um $1 un less federal
 
06:03:52.990 --> 06:03:53.000 align:start position:0%
dollars are
 
06:03:56.430 --> 06:03:56.440 align:start position:0%
available um so the bill really is about
 
06:03:59.230 --> 06:03:59.240 align:start position:0%
connecting eligible people to snap
 
06:04:02.270 --> 06:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
bringing in federal dollars um and and
 
06:04:04.830 --> 06:04:04.840 align:start position:0%
sumary EBT which works just the same as
 
06:04:09.030 --> 06:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
snap um and uh helping folks who are
 
06:04:12.190 --> 06:04:12.200 align:start position:0%
having a very tough time uh under 185%
 
06:04:14.628 --> 06:04:14.638 align:start position:0%
of poverty uh feed their
 
06:04:18.788 --> 06:04:18.798 align:start position:0%
kids so um again every dollar spent on
 
06:04:21.788 --> 06:04:21.798 align:start position:0%
SNAP benefits generates a150 to A180 and
 
06:04:23.948 --> 06:04:23.958 align:start position:0%
economic activity and every dollar spent
 
06:04:26.150 --> 06:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
on School meals is estimated to have a
 
06:04:28.110 --> 06:04:28.120 align:start position:0%
return of
 
06:04:30.830 --> 06:04:30.840 align:start position:0%
$2 uh the bill makes modest Investments
 
06:04:33.110 --> 06:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
to leverage substantial federal dollars
 
06:04:35.230 --> 06:04:35.240 align:start position:0%
and provide a high return on investment
 
06:04:38.830 --> 06:04:38.840 align:start position:0%
so I urge you to vote on to pass on 499
 
06:04:40.190 --> 06:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
and I'll take questions thank you sir
 
06:04:42.230 --> 06:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
much repres papichi M for you already
 
06:04:44.910 --> 06:04:44.920 align:start position:0%
know what I want to ask I can't wait
 
06:04:47.390 --> 06:04:47.400 align:start position:0%
thank you I mean I already asked it I
 
06:04:48.868 --> 06:04:48.878 align:start position:0%
thought you were listening but for the
 
06:04:50.750 --> 06:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
record could you explain the difference
 
06:04:52.390 --> 06:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
between people who are dealing with
 
06:04:54.468 --> 06:04:54.478 align:start position:0%
hunger and people who are categorized as
 
06:04:56.548 --> 06:04:56.558 align:start position:0%
food insufficient
 
06:05:00.510 --> 06:05:00.520 align:start position:0%
please So Hunger is uh and these are not
 
06:05:03.110 --> 06:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
you know I I'm not making these up um
 
06:05:07.190 --> 06:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
people there are lots they're REM of of
 
06:05:10.150 --> 06:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
uh writing on the subject hunger is
 
06:05:13.788 --> 06:05:13.798 align:start position:0%
generally thought to be a feeling that
 
06:05:16.830 --> 06:05:16.840 align:start position:0%
that all of us have had at some time
 
06:05:19.468 --> 06:05:19.478 align:start position:0%
food insecurity is the sense that you're
 
06:05:21.868 --> 06:05:21.878 align:start position:0%
not going to be able to have enough food
 
06:05:26.030 --> 06:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
or enough uh nutritious food I um am
 
06:05:27.750 --> 06:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
happy to provide and I think you've been
 
06:05:30.548 --> 06:05:30.558 align:start position:0%
sent the our explanation of the census
 
06:05:32.310 --> 06:05:32.320 align:start position:0%
household pulse data which is what we
 
06:05:35.390 --> 06:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
report on our website which uh ask
 
06:05:37.310 --> 06:05:37.320 align:start position:0%
people people whether they've had enough
 
06:05:39.430 --> 06:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
to eat in the last seven days or enough
 
06:05:42.868 --> 06:05:42.878 align:start position:0%
of the right kinds of food if I may
 
06:05:44.670 --> 06:05:44.680 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
06:05:47.070 --> 06:05:47.080 align:start position:0%
follow as I expressed in previous
 
06:05:50.750 --> 06:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
hearings on the topic while dealing
 
06:05:53.190 --> 06:05:53.200 align:start position:0%
dealing with not having enough food is a
 
06:05:54.670 --> 06:05:54.680 align:start position:0%
serious issue the state should
 
06:05:57.708 --> 06:05:57.718 align:start position:0%
absolutely absolutely you know do what
 
06:06:00.270 --> 06:06:00.280 align:start position:0%
it can to make sure that we do not have
 
06:06:03.670 --> 06:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
those issues food insufficiency seems to
 
06:06:05.628 --> 06:06:05.638 align:start position:0%
be a category that includes people who
 
06:06:07.868 --> 06:06:07.878 align:start position:0%
are dealing with not enough food and
 
06:06:10.110 --> 06:06:10.120 align:start position:0%
people who and I quote Loosely because I
 
06:06:11.910 --> 06:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
don't have it in front of me the federal
 
06:06:14.750 --> 06:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
definition used by the census people to
 
06:06:17.788 --> 06:06:17.798 align:start position:0%
be people who may have enough food but
 
06:06:19.390 --> 06:06:19.400 align:start position:0%
they just don't have the kinds of food
 
06:06:21.948 --> 06:06:21.958 align:start position:0%
they like would that be a reasonable
 
06:06:23.708 --> 06:06:23.718 align:start position:0%
representation of that definition so we
 
06:06:26.230 --> 06:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
don't have to go to the website I I
 
06:06:28.190 --> 06:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
don't think that that is a reasonable I
 
06:06:30.190 --> 06:06:30.200 align:start position:0%
I think that it's true that the question
 
06:06:32.390 --> 06:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
is enough of the but it's not the kinds
 
06:06:35.628 --> 06:06:35.638 align:start position:0%
of foods they like it's the kinds of of
 
06:06:37.670 --> 06:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
food that meet their nutritional needs
 
06:06:39.510 --> 06:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
so you know I mean I think we're talking
 
06:06:41.788 --> 06:06:41.798 align:start position:0%
about the there are follow-up questions
 
06:06:44.270 --> 06:06:44.280 align:start position:0%
on the census pulse they ask people why
 
06:06:45.750 --> 06:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
they didn't have enough of the right
 
06:06:48.230 --> 06:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
kinds of food and they said and many of
 
06:06:50.548 --> 06:06:50.558 align:start position:0%
them say that it's because they couldn't
 
06:06:53.510 --> 06:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
afford to buy more food so I think what
 
06:06:56.708 --> 06:06:56.718 align:start position:0%
is meant by that is that they're eating
 
06:06:58.788 --> 06:06:58.798 align:start position:0%
instant Ramen instead of fruits and
 
06:07:01.310 --> 06:07:01.320 align:start position:0%
vegetables we're talking about people's
 
06:07:03.190 --> 06:07:03.200 align:start position:0%
uh nutritional well-being across the
 
06:07:05.910 --> 06:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
board and not just whether they actually
 
06:07:09.910 --> 06:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:12.670 --> 06:07:12.680 align:start position:0%
mouths I will yield the floor for a
 
06:07:14.468 --> 06:07:14.478 align:start position:0%
little bit while I go to the proper
 
06:07:16.590 --> 06:07:16.600 align:start position:0%
website so we have the accurate language
 
06:07:19.310 --> 06:07:19.320 align:start position:0%
in front of us thank you represent Hull
 
06:07:21.990 --> 06:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
for a question thank you madam chair
 
06:07:26.110 --> 06:07:26.120 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you Mr chair I apologize so
 
06:07:27.468 --> 06:07:27.478 align:start position:0%
someone handed out this sheet here
 
06:07:28.910 --> 06:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
relative to
 
06:07:31.590 --> 06:07:31.600 align:start position:0%
s499 um and it makes the claim that
 
06:07:33.990 --> 06:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
almost 22,000 children currently are
 
06:07:37.830 --> 06:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
facing hunger is do you rep is that an
 
06:07:40.070 --> 06:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
an accurate number thank you for the
 
06:07:42.190 --> 06:07:42.200 align:start position:0%
question I believe that that was passed
 
06:07:45.788 --> 06:07:45.798 align:start position:0%
out by Senator Whitley um and she uh
 
06:07:47.788 --> 06:07:47.798 align:start position:0%
told me that that is from feeding
 
06:07:50.830 --> 06:07:50.840 align:start position:0%
America they have a a map the meal Gap
 
06:07:57.030 --> 06:07:57.040 align:start position:0%
site um those those uh that shows what
 
06:08:00.230 --> 06:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
the okay the numbers are those are I and
 
06:08:02.230 --> 06:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
I'm G to get this wrong because um I'm
 
06:08:02.240 --> 06:08:03.868 align:start position:0%
I'm G to get this wrong because um I'm
not

06:08:03.868 --> 06:08:03.878 align:start position:0%
not
 
06:08:05.990 --> 06:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
06:08:07.788 --> 06:08:07.798 align:start position:0%
that's I think that's based on the
 
06:08:10.430 --> 06:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
official food insecurity measure that's
 
06:08:13.270 --> 06:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
um and I'll I'll send the committee the
 
06:08:15.150 --> 06:08:15.160 align:start position:0%
the explanation that explains the
 
06:08:17.548 --> 06:08:17.558 align:start position:0%
difference between food insufficiency
 
06:08:19.110 --> 06:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
and food insecurity because it is
 
06:08:20.990 --> 06:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
confusing it is that would be helpful
 
06:08:23.948 --> 06:08:23.958 align:start position:0%
because being hungry right is a feeling
 
06:08:26.350 --> 06:08:26.360 align:start position:0%
food insecurity still might be in some
 
06:08:30.070 --> 06:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
part a feeling but insufficient food
 
06:08:33.628 --> 06:08:33.638 align:start position:0%
meaning bmis that are below 15 or below
 
06:08:35.670 --> 06:08:35.680 align:start position:0%
for right 16 somewhere in that range
 
06:08:37.350 --> 06:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
where the person is is
 
06:08:40.510 --> 06:08:40.520 align:start position:0%
clearly malnourished is a very different
 
06:08:42.788 --> 06:08:42.798 align:start position:0%
metric and I want to if we have 22,000
 
06:08:44.670 --> 06:08:44.680 align:start position:0%
kids in the state that are malnourished
 
06:08:46.548 --> 06:08:46.558 align:start position:0%
I we should know about that and you guys
 
06:08:47.868 --> 06:08:47.878 align:start position:0%
should provide that
 
06:08:52.548 --> 06:08:52.558 align:start position:0%
data sure yeah um so we have been
 
06:08:56.110 --> 06:08:56.120 align:start position:0%
tracking the census household pulse data
 
06:08:57.708 --> 06:08:57.718 align:start position:0%
which uh asked the questions that I
 
06:08:59.868 --> 06:08:59.878 align:start position:0%
talked about with um representative
 
06:09:03.350 --> 06:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
papuchi Muller because um because those
 
06:09:06.990 --> 06:09:07.000 align:start position:0%
are almost real time data people are uh
 
06:09:09.708 --> 06:09:09.718 align:start position:0%
it's an an online survey that is done
 
06:09:12.270 --> 06:09:12.280 align:start position:0%
monthly um there was a gap this winter
 
06:09:14.190 --> 06:09:14.200 align:start position:0%
when the census was revamping it but it
 
06:09:17.628 --> 06:09:17.638 align:start position:0%
started up again in February um and so
 
06:09:19.270 --> 06:09:19.280 align:start position:0%
that's what we've been tracking it's not
 
06:09:20.948 --> 06:09:20.958 align:start position:0%
that the other data aren't useful they
 
06:09:23.230 --> 06:09:23.240 align:start position:0%
are but they tend to be time
 
06:09:28.070 --> 06:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
lagged so so back to this large group or
 
06:09:29.670 --> 06:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
potentially large group we're talking
 
06:09:32.948 --> 06:09:32.958 align:start position:0%
roughly 17th or thereabouts of the
 
06:09:35.430 --> 06:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
current School population in the state
 
06:09:39.270 --> 06:09:39.280 align:start position:0%
got about 165,000 kids so uh roughly
 
06:09:42.590 --> 06:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
17th 1/8 that's one out of every eight I
 
06:09:44.070 --> 06:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
would be very concerned if one out of
 
06:09:46.350 --> 06:09:46.360 align:start position:0%
every eight kids is lacking lacking
 
06:09:48.948 --> 06:09:48.958 align:start position:0%
lacking substance and are is
 
06:09:51.548 --> 06:09:51.558 align:start position:0%
malnourished so let's use terms that are
 
06:09:53.230 --> 06:09:53.240 align:start position:0%
like definitive in nature right
 
06:09:55.990 --> 06:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
malnourished is a is a real category
 
06:09:57.750 --> 06:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
right feeling hungry is a is a real
 
06:10:00.788 --> 06:10:00.798 align:start position:0%
category but one requires interaction
 
06:10:04.030 --> 06:10:04.040 align:start position:0%
one might not yeah I mean I think that
 
06:10:07.270 --> 06:10:07.280 align:start position:0%
you know I I I wish we had a way of G of
 
06:10:09.350 --> 06:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
reaching out to families and finding out
 
06:10:11.430 --> 06:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
you know who's hungry who's being uh
 
06:10:14.070 --> 06:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
turned away at school who's uh you know
 
06:10:15.708 --> 06:10:15.718 align:start position:0%
having a hard time concentrating at
 
06:10:18.670 --> 06:10:18.680 align:start position:0%
school because they can't eat and we
 
06:10:21.788 --> 06:10:21.798 align:start position:0%
don't have those data what we have is
 
06:10:25.150 --> 06:10:25.160 align:start position:0%
the census pulse household pulse data
 
06:10:28.110 --> 06:10:28.120 align:start position:0%
and then we have the um the American
 
06:10:30.030 --> 06:10:30.040 align:start position:0%
Community survey data which is a little
 
06:10:32.270 --> 06:10:32.280 align:start position:0%
bit lagged which is I think what is the
 
06:10:35.430 --> 06:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
basis for um feeding America's uh uh
 
06:10:38.270 --> 06:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
food insecurity numbers so I mean we do
 
06:10:40.590 --> 06:10:40.600 align:start position:0%
have data that shows that there are
 
06:10:42.230 --> 06:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
hungry children in New Hampshire that
 
06:10:43.590 --> 06:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
there are families that are having a
 
06:10:45.310 --> 06:10:45.320 align:start position:0%
hard time making ends
 
06:10:48.270 --> 06:10:48.280 align:start position:0%
meet so that's what I would
 
06:10:48.280 --> 06:10:50.468 align:start position:0%
meet so that's what I would
say

06:10:50.468 --> 06:10:50.478 align:start position:0%
say
 
06:10:53.548 --> 06:10:53.558 align:start position:0%
okay oh
 
06:10:58.868 --> 06:10:58.878 align:start position:0%
I I I was after reper
 
06:11:03.430 --> 06:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
ski see I think I've got represent wner
 
06:11:08.830 --> 06:11:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:12.510 --> 06:11:12.520 align:start position:0%
okay I'll be very quick I'll be very
 
06:11:15.948 --> 06:11:15.958 align:start position:0%
quick I guess just to Branch off of what
 
06:11:18.150 --> 06:11:18.160 align:start position:0%
representative H said wouldn't you say
 
06:11:20.708 --> 06:11:20.718 align:start position:0%
the point of this legislation is to meet
 
06:11:23.190 --> 06:11:23.200 align:start position:0%
children before they are malnourished
 
06:11:25.750 --> 06:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
and before they get to that point of
 
06:11:28.868 --> 06:11:28.878 align:start position:0%
major Health crisis and that's what the
 
06:11:33.310 --> 06:11:33.320 align:start position:0%
point of this is I would thank you thank
 
06:11:38.070 --> 06:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
you represent wner question thank you
 
06:11:41.310 --> 06:11:41.320 align:start position:0%
could you talk a little bit about um the
 
06:11:43.190 --> 06:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
part of this bill that deals with the
 
06:11:46.948 --> 06:11:46.958 align:start position:0%
elderly and the SNAP benefit um how many
 
06:11:49.868 --> 06:11:49.878 align:start position:0%
adults now elderly adults now or
 
06:11:53.548 --> 06:11:53.558 align:start position:0%
disabled adults now or on Snap uh what
 
06:11:56.468 --> 06:11:56.478 align:start position:0%
do we anticipate this might do and what
 
06:11:58.750 --> 06:11:58.760 align:start position:0%
does it mean that the department shall
 
06:11:58.760 --> 06:12:00.070 align:start position:0%
does it mean that the department shall
apply

06:12:00.070 --> 06:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
apply
 
06:12:03.110 --> 06:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
for so the elderly simple thank you for
 
06:12:05.190 --> 06:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
the question representative um the
 
06:12:07.350 --> 06:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
elderly simplified application project
 
06:12:09.788 --> 06:12:09.798 align:start position:0%
is a set of waivers through the the US
 
06:12:12.990 --> 06:12:13.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture um that uh
 
06:12:16.190 --> 06:12:16.200 align:start position:0%
allow for a different recertification
 
06:12:20.590 --> 06:12:20.600 align:start position:0%
timing a different um for for people on
 
06:12:25.788 --> 06:12:25.798 align:start position:0%
fixed incomes who are uh over 60 or are
 
06:12:29.350 --> 06:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
living with disabilities so the thinking
 
06:12:32.868 --> 06:12:32.878 align:start position:0%
is that because those folks uh incomes
 
06:12:34.708 --> 06:12:34.718 align:start position:0%
don't change they shouldn't have to
 
06:12:36.830 --> 06:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
research certify as often as other
 
06:12:40.510 --> 06:12:40.520 align:start position:0%
people on snap that makes it easier for
 
06:12:43.830 --> 06:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
the the uh the state to administer the
 
06:12:46.548 --> 06:12:46.558 align:start position:0%
program um they still have to report if
 
06:12:49.510 --> 06:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
their income does change by the way they
 
06:12:52.510 --> 06:12:52.520 align:start position:0%
um but assuming that it does not change
 
06:12:54.708 --> 06:12:54.718 align:start position:0%
then they recertify less frequently
 
06:12:58.390 --> 06:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
every three years so that uh both makes
 
06:13:00.510 --> 06:13:00.520 align:start position:0%
it easier for administration for the
 
06:13:03.628 --> 06:13:03.638 align:start position:0%
state and it makes it easier for people
 
06:13:05.548 --> 06:13:05.558 align:start position:0%
who are living with fixed income comes
 
06:13:09.390 --> 06:13:09.400 align:start position:0%
to stay on the program if if uh as they
 
06:13:09.400 --> 06:13:10.590 align:start position:0%
to stay on the program if if uh as they
need

06:13:10.590 --> 06:13:10.600 align:start position:0%
need
 
06:13:14.070 --> 06:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
to a followup so uh we have to get a
 
06:13:16.830 --> 06:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
waiver from um Health and Human Services
 
06:13:16.840 --> 06:13:17.468 align:start position:0%
waiver from um Health and Human Services
the

06:13:17.468 --> 06:13:17.478 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:13:19.788 --> 06:13:19.798 align:start position:0%
federal my understanding is that it's an
 
06:13:23.708 --> 06:13:23.718 align:start position:0%
application for the program um that that
 
06:13:26.310 --> 06:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire would uh would have to but
 
06:13:28.150 --> 06:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
I but I assume that my colleagues from
 
06:13:30.150 --> 06:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
DHHS would would be able to answer that
 
06:13:31.670 --> 06:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
question better than
 
06:13:31.680 --> 06:13:33.590 align:start position:0%
question better than
I

06:13:33.590 --> 06:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
I
 
06:13:36.548 --> 06:13:36.558 align:start position:0%
okay represent
 
06:13:39.830 --> 06:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair this legislation is
 
06:13:41.230 --> 06:13:41.240 align:start position:0%
really important for my city of
 
06:13:41.240 --> 06:13:43.030 align:start position:0%
really important for my city of
Manchester

06:13:43.030 --> 06:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
Manchester
 
06:13:47.310 --> 06:13:47.320 align:start position:0%
um we have growing numbers of elderly
 
06:13:49.548 --> 06:13:49.558 align:start position:0%
citizens who are finding their way
 
06:13:51.830 --> 06:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
actually into homeless shelters because
 
06:13:54.590 --> 06:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
the cost of rent is so high and for them
 
06:13:58.270 --> 06:13:58.280 align:start position:0%
it's almost impossible for them to U try
 
06:14:03.750 --> 06:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
and and negotiate rents and try and pay
 
06:14:05.548 --> 06:14:05.558 align:start position:0%
for any kind of food
 
06:14:08.230 --> 06:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
so again this would be absolutely
 
06:14:10.788 --> 06:14:10.798 align:start position:0%
necessary in terms of what's most near
 
06:14:12.910 --> 06:14:12.920 align:start position:0%
and de of my heart are my schools in
 
06:14:15.750 --> 06:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
Meester and the number of schools who
 
06:14:20.468 --> 06:14:20.478 align:start position:0%
pretty much reach um about between 95
 
06:14:23.590 --> 06:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
and almost 100% um children who are
 
06:14:25.350 --> 06:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
eligible for free and reduced lunch
 
06:14:28.190 --> 06:14:28.200 align:start position:0%
meals and this bill would be so
 
06:14:30.510 --> 06:14:30.520 align:start position:0%
important because it would bring to them
 
06:14:33.110 --> 06:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
possibility of something to eat during
 
06:14:36.190 --> 06:14:36.200 align:start position:0%
the summer and it's so critical because
 
06:14:37.750 --> 06:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
one of the things as an educator we
 
06:14:39.390 --> 06:14:39.400 align:start position:0%
always worried about the most was what
 
06:14:41.548 --> 06:14:41.558 align:start position:0%
happens to these children in the summer
 
06:14:43.628 --> 06:14:43.638 align:start position:0%
because there's nobody to bring them
 
06:14:46.750 --> 06:14:46.760 align:start position:0%
food but from what I in from the
 
06:14:49.990 --> 06:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
research um if we don't pass this bill
 
06:14:53.990 --> 06:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
is it true that we'd leave
 
06:14:57.430 --> 06:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
37,325 children on free and reduced
 
06:14:59.230 --> 06:14:59.240 align:start position:0%
lunch meals in New Hampshire without
 
06:15:02.110 --> 06:15:02.120 align:start position:0%
food during the summer months thank you
 
06:15:04.708 --> 06:15:04.718 align:start position:0%
for the question that is the number of
 
06:15:06.708 --> 06:15:06.718 align:start position:0%
children children currently uh on the
 
06:15:10.830 --> 06:15:10.840 align:start position:0%
free and reduced meals um and there
 
06:15:13.230 --> 06:15:13.240 align:start position:0%
isn't currently a program that that
 
06:15:16.788 --> 06:15:16.798 align:start position:0%
meets their needs directly um there are
 
06:15:18.910 --> 06:15:18.920 align:start position:0%
some summer meal programs throughout the
 
06:15:21.468 --> 06:15:21.478 align:start position:0%
state um but they are there are
 
06:15:24.590 --> 06:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
definitely Geographic gaps um this
 
06:15:27.030 --> 06:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
program because it would uh send an EVT
 
06:15:29.750 --> 06:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
card directly to the family um would
 
06:15:32.830 --> 06:15:32.840 align:start position:0%
would more directly ensure that families
 
06:15:34.468 --> 06:15:34.478 align:start position:0%
are able to feed their kids in the
 
06:15:36.270 --> 06:15:36.280 align:start position:0%
summer just want to thank you and
 
06:15:38.468 --> 06:15:38.478 align:start position:0%
Senator Whitley for working on this bill
 
06:15:41.030 --> 06:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
together I think it's just so important
 
06:15:43.190 --> 06:15:43.200 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure the city of nashar is has
 
06:15:44.910 --> 06:15:44.920 align:start position:0%
many of the same circumstances that we
 
06:15:47.270 --> 06:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
see in the city of Manchester thank you
 
06:15:49.270 --> 06:15:49.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator Edwards for a question
 
06:15:50.788 --> 06:15:50.798 align:start position:0%
then we're waiting to hear from the food
 
06:15:52.510 --> 06:15:52.520 align:start position:0%
bank and also from the Department of
 
06:15:55.030 --> 06:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
Health and Human thank you Mr chair I I
 
06:15:57.830 --> 06:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
just I I just want to uh let people know
 
06:16:00.548 --> 06:16:00.558 align:start position:0%
that on April 23rd at 1:00 we're going
 
06:16:02.868 --> 06:16:02.878 align:start position:0%
to have a working session on this it's
 
06:16:04.948 --> 06:16:04.958 align:start position:0%
going to be a combined session with the
 
06:16:08.830 --> 06:16:08.840 align:start position:0%
division 3 and div division 2 uh and and
 
06:16:11.750 --> 06:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
and Mr Ripple I I propose that we do the
 
06:16:14.990 --> 06:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
first 30 minutes of it um just looking
 
06:16:16.910 --> 06:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
at this fiscal note because this fiscal
 
06:16:19.390 --> 06:16:19.400 align:start position:0%
note just confuses me I cannot interpret
 
06:16:22.510 --> 06:16:22.520 align:start position:0%
it and so before we get into the rust of
 
06:16:25.510 --> 06:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
the bill and the value of the bill I I I
 
06:16:27.708 --> 06:16:27.718 align:start position:0%
just want to understand the money that's
 
06:16:29.990 --> 06:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
here and I don't think this witness is
 
06:16:31.788 --> 06:16:31.798 align:start position:0%
here to tell us about the money or if
 
06:16:33.990 --> 06:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
there's anyone here but I'm really
 
06:16:36.990 --> 06:16:37.000 align:start position:0%
confused by this fcal note so so that
 
06:16:39.070 --> 06:16:39.080 align:start position:0%
that's for the committee and that's for
 
06:16:40.390 --> 06:16:40.400 align:start position:0%
you know what I think we're going to we
 
06:16:42.990 --> 06:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
need to do to break this
 
06:16:45.110 --> 06:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
down sure and just so the committee
 
06:16:46.468 --> 06:16:46.478 align:start position:0%
knows there will be yet another version
 
06:16:48.110 --> 06:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
of the fiscal Note coming out because it
 
06:16:50.270 --> 06:16:50.280 align:start position:0%
was amended by the Senate twice and the
 
06:16:51.910 --> 06:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
one you had before you only reflects the
 
06:16:53.430 --> 06:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
first of those amendments so there'll be
 
06:16:55.230 --> 06:16:55.240 align:start position:0%
a new version coming out this afternoon
 
06:16:59.670 --> 06:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
or tomorrow morning thank and Mr chair
 
06:17:02.750 --> 06:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
um I would be perfectly happy to defer
 
06:17:05.150 --> 06:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
some of these questions for that uh you
 
06:17:07.948 --> 06:17:07.958 align:start position:0%
know work session if a New Hampshire
 
06:17:09.708 --> 06:17:09.718 align:start position:0%
hunger solution will be there just to
 
06:17:11.868 --> 06:17:11.878 align:start position:0%
respect how late it is in the day and
 
06:17:13.590 --> 06:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
the fact that we do and plus I want to
 
06:17:15.350 --> 06:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
give you a fair heads up of exactly what
 
06:17:16.910 --> 06:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
I'm looking to ask so we have plenty of
 
06:17:19.390 --> 06:17:19.400 align:start position:0%
time to prepare and you know we can get
 
06:17:21.270 --> 06:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
everything answered and you know
 
06:17:23.430 --> 06:17:23.440 align:start position:0%
clarified so I'll you know I'll be happy
 
06:17:26.830 --> 06:17:26.840 align:start position:0%
to defer until then thank you all right

culinary and nutrition programs director

at the New Hampshire Food Bank thank you
 
06:17:53.830 --> 06:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity to speak today in
 
06:17:57.070 --> 06:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
support of SB 499 the New Hampshire food
 
06:17:58.990 --> 06:17:59.000 align:start position:0%
bank as many of you are probably aware
 
06:18:00.868 --> 06:18:00.878 align:start position:0%
is a program of Catholic Charities New
 
06:18:03.030 --> 06:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and is the only food bank in
 
06:18:05.468 --> 06:18:05.478 align:start position:0%
the state we work with more than 400
 
06:18:08.150 --> 06:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
partner agencies to provide food and
 
06:18:10.830 --> 06:18:10.840 align:start position:0%
resources to our neighbors facing food
 
06:18:13.390 --> 06:18:13.400 align:start position:0%
insecurity over the years I've seen or
 
06:18:15.110 --> 06:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
we've seen at the food bank a growing
 
06:18:17.468 --> 06:18:17.478 align:start position:0%
number of partner agencies looking to
 
06:18:19.708 --> 06:18:19.718 align:start position:0%
meet the increasing demand for emergency
 
06:18:22.230 --> 06:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
food resources in their community in
 
06:18:25.708 --> 06:18:25.718 align:start position:0%
2023 we distributed 16.3 million pounds
 
06:18:27.708 --> 06:18:27.718 align:start position:0%
of food throughout the state a number
 
06:18:30.628 --> 06:18:30.638 align:start position:0%
that continues to grow each year as part
 
06:18:33.590 --> 06:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
of the charitable food system we rely on
 
06:18:35.230 --> 06:18:35.240 align:start position:0%
generous private donation
 
06:18:38.310 --> 06:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
and grant funding um in order to operate
 
06:18:40.310 --> 06:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
which poses limitations to the growing
 
06:18:42.948 --> 06:18:42.958 align:start position:0%
need that we're seeing in the state
 
06:18:44.708 --> 06:18:44.718 align:start position:0%
according to feeding America I'm going
 
06:18:47.110 --> 06:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
to throw out a couple statistics too
 
06:18:49.628 --> 06:18:49.638 align:start position:0%
sorry some of them you've heard um but
 
06:18:53.310 --> 06:18:53.320 align:start position:0%
feeding America's map the meal gap 88.5%
 
06:18:55.390 --> 06:18:55.400 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire's children are food
 
06:18:58.150 --> 06:18:58.160 align:start position:0%
insecure meaning that these children
 
06:19:00.430 --> 06:19:00.440 align:start position:0%
don't have reliable access to
 
06:19:02.910 --> 06:19:02.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate quantities and quality of
 
06:19:05.150 --> 06:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
food that they need to meet meet their
 
06:19:05.160 --> 06:19:06.270 align:start position:0%
food that they need to meet meet their
basic

06:19:06.270 --> 06:19:06.280 align:start position:0%
basic
 
06:19:09.868 --> 06:19:09.878 align:start position:0%
needs this equates to more than 21,000
 
06:19:12.788 --> 06:19:12.798 align:start position:0%
kids in New Hampshire these numbers are
 
06:19:14.670 --> 06:19:14.680 align:start position:0%
based on data from
 
06:19:17.190 --> 06:19:17.200 align:start position:0%
2021 um and we suspect that current
 
06:19:19.948 --> 06:19:19.958 align:start position:0%
numbers are much higher after support
 
06:19:22.390 --> 06:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
ended that was in that was in place
 
06:19:25.548 --> 06:19:25.558 align:start position:0%
during covid the increasing number of
 
06:19:27.948 --> 06:19:27.958 align:start position:0%
school pantries and backpack programs
 
06:19:29.948 --> 06:19:29.958 align:start position:0%
being established throughout the state
 
06:19:32.230 --> 06:19:32.240 align:start position:0%
exemplifies the need for increased
 
06:19:35.150 --> 06:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
access to food for those 21,00 th000
 
06:19:37.788 --> 06:19:37.798 align:start position:0%
plus children currently the food bank
 
06:19:41.468 --> 06:19:41.478 align:start position:0%
partners with 59 School pantries and
 
06:19:44.070 --> 06:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
backpack programs more than
 
06:19:47.390 --> 06:19:47.400 align:start position:0%
675,000 pounds of food has been
 
06:19:49.830 --> 06:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
distributed through these programs in
 
06:19:55.110 --> 06:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
2023 and that's a 37% increase from
 
06:19:58.670 --> 06:19:58.680 align:start position:0%
2022 adequate access to food positively
 
06:20:00.590 --> 06:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
impacts a child's health there's
 
06:20:02.948 --> 06:20:02.958 align:start position:0%
research that shows that it decreases
 
06:20:02.958 --> 06:20:05.030 align:start position:0%
research that shows that it decreases
obesity

06:20:05.030 --> 06:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
obesity
 
06:20:06.750 --> 06:20:06.760 align:start position:0%
um it leads to a Better Learning
 
06:20:10.788 --> 06:20:10.798 align:start position:0%
environment improves dietary intake and
 
06:20:13.310 --> 06:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
ultimately reduces food
 
06:20:15.510 --> 06:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
insecurity our New Hampshire children
 
06:20:18.150 --> 06:20:18.160 align:start position:0%
are the future of our state investing in
 
06:20:20.190 --> 06:20:20.200 align:start position:0%
the expansion of federal nutrition
 
06:20:23.150 --> 06:20:23.160 align:start position:0%
programs including summer EBT and free
 
06:20:25.788 --> 06:20:25.798 align:start position:0%
and reduced meals at school is not only
 
06:20:27.910 --> 06:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
an invest an investment in the future of
 
06:20:30.110 --> 06:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
our children but also their communities
 
06:20:31.590 --> 06:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
and our state as a
 
06:20:34.110 --> 06:20:34.120 align:start position:0%
whole in addition to expanding these
 
06:20:35.708 --> 06:20:35.718 align:start position:0%
Federal nut nutrition programs for
 
06:20:39.070 --> 06:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
children within s SP 499 I don't want to
 
06:20:41.310 --> 06:20:41.320 align:start position:0%
leave out the major impact that adopting
 
06:20:45.110 --> 06:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
the elderly simplified application would
 
06:20:47.390 --> 06:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
have on our New Hampshire seniors with
 
06:20:50.110 --> 06:20:50.120 align:start position:0%
fixed incomes this application could
 
06:20:52.350 --> 06:20:52.360 align:start position:0%
reduce some of the administrative burden
 
06:20:54.270 --> 06:20:54.280 align:start position:0%
on New Hampshire's Department of Health
 
06:20:56.788 --> 06:20:56.798 align:start position:0%
and Human Services and simplify the
 
06:20:59.070 --> 06:20:59.080 align:start position:0%
process for older adults to apply for
 
06:21:02.868 --> 06:21:02.878 align:start position:0%
SNAP benefits which we know is a barrier
 
06:21:04.670 --> 06:21:04.680 align:start position:0%
by funding these programs we'll be
 
06:21:06.390 --> 06:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
improving the infrastructure that
 
06:21:09.310 --> 06:21:09.320 align:start position:0%
provides our most vulnerable populations
 
06:21:12.030 --> 06:21:12.040 align:start position:0%
with access to sufficient safe
 
06:21:14.150 --> 06:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
nutritious food that they need in order
 
06:21:17.548 --> 06:21:17.558 align:start position:0%
to maintain a healthy and active life
 
06:21:19.510 --> 06:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
please join me in reducing food
 
06:21:23.190 --> 06:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
insecurity by passing SB 499 happy to
 
06:21:24.788 --> 06:21:24.798 align:start position:0%

Services good
 
06:21:59.548 --> 06:21:59.558 align:start position:0%
afternoon my name is Karen Hebert I'm
 
06:22:00.788 --> 06:22:00.798 align:start position:0%
the director for the division of
 
06:22:03.190 --> 06:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
economic stability at the Department of
 
06:22:05.230 --> 06:22:05.240 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services
 
06:22:07.468 --> 06:22:07.478 align:start position:0%
and I'm Brian Clark general counsel for
 
06:22:10.190 --> 06:22:10.200 align:start position:0%
the division of economic stability and
 
06:22:12.110 --> 06:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
Mr Clark would you fill out a pink card
 
06:22:15.910 --> 06:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
when you finished not right now okay I
 
06:22:17.788 --> 06:22:17.798 align:start position:0%
apologize I should have added his name
 
06:22:17.798 --> 06:22:19.590 align:start position:0%
apologize I should have added his name
to

06:22:19.590 --> 06:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:22:23.230 --> 06:22:23.240 align:start position:0%
it so I can certainly answer questions
 
06:22:24.708 --> 06:22:24.718 align:start position:0%
that any of the members of the committee
 
06:22:27.708 --> 06:22:27.718 align:start position:0%
have with respect to either the elderly
 
06:22:31.310 --> 06:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
simplified application process or summer
 
06:22:33.430 --> 06:22:33.440 align:start position:0%
EBT I will leave the rest of the
 
06:22:35.910 --> 06:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
provisions of the bill to my colleagues
 
06:22:37.948 --> 06:22:37.958 align:start position:0%
from the Department of
 
06:22:40.548 --> 06:22:40.558 align:start position:0%
Education questions Miss Hebert
 
06:22:43.590 --> 06:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
representative walner then represent
 
06:22:46.548 --> 06:22:46.558 align:start position:0%
mire so I would like to know what what
 
06:22:50.270 --> 06:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
the process is for New Hampshire to be
 
06:22:53.708 --> 06:22:53.718 align:start position:0%
able to um do the simplified
 
06:22:57.948 --> 06:22:57.958 align:start position:0%
application and do we know now how
 
06:23:02.990 --> 06:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
many elderly and disabled fall in that c
 
06:23:06.830 --> 06:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
how many do we have presently on um
 
06:23:09.708 --> 06:23:09.718 align:start position:0%
receiving SNAP benefits and would you
 
06:23:12.190 --> 06:23:12.200 align:start position:0%
see this as a way of incre that there
 
06:23:14.948 --> 06:23:14.958 align:start position:0%
would be increased participation and
 
06:23:17.390 --> 06:23:17.400 align:start position:0%
this is all federal the benefit is all
 
06:23:20.030 --> 06:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
federal is that correct that is correct
 
06:23:22.270 --> 06:23:22.280 align:start position:0%
it is a federal benefit the elderly
 
06:23:24.590 --> 06:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
simplified application program is a
 
06:23:26.430 --> 06:23:26.440 align:start position:0%
program that states can essentially be
 
06:23:28.390 --> 06:23:28.400 align:start position:0%
requesting from the US Department of
 
06:23:31.310 --> 06:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
Agriculture uh as a waiver uh to
 
06:23:33.548 --> 06:23:33.558 align:start position:0%
implement this program specifically for
 
06:23:35.468 --> 06:23:35.478 align:start position:0%
older adults and people with
 
06:23:38.070 --> 06:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
disabilities who have no earned
 
06:23:41.150 --> 06:23:41.160 align:start position:0%
income that ballpark uh estimate number
 
06:23:43.390 --> 06:23:43.400 align:start position:0%
of individuals who may qualify for that
 
06:23:45.750 --> 06:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
would be about 7,000
 
06:23:48.310 --> 06:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
people this would allow the state to
 
06:23:51.150 --> 06:23:51.160 align:start position:0%
streamline the application process and
 
06:23:54.548 --> 06:23:54.558 align:start position:0%
help more people to benefit from snap uh
 
06:23:54.558 --> 06:23:55.548 align:start position:0%
help more people to benefit from snap uh
snap

06:23:55.548 --> 06:23:55.558 align:start position:0%
snap
 
06:23:58.070 --> 06:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
assistance uh it would ease their access
 
06:24:01.430 --> 06:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
in applying for uh those services for
 
06:24:03.548 --> 06:24:03.558 align:start position:0%
older adults uh who and people with
 
06:24:06.070 --> 06:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
disabilities who have may have Mobility
 
06:24:09.510 --> 06:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh or difficulty uh accessing online
 
06:24:12.708 --> 06:24:12.718 align:start position:0%
applications so essentially one of the
 
06:24:15.510 --> 06:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
the the uh features of this particular
 
06:24:20.030 --> 06:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
program would enable a longer duration
 
06:24:22.150 --> 06:24:22.160 align:start position:0%
of time for a benefit before it needs to
 
06:24:25.430 --> 06:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
be re a redetermination needs to be
 
06:24:28.190 --> 06:24:28.200 align:start position:0%
made so that they don't have to every
 
06:24:31.110 --> 06:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
year reapply with the same verification
 
06:24:33.468 --> 06:24:33.478 align:start position:0%
forms and obtain verification
 
06:24:35.868 --> 06:24:35.878 align:start position:0%
documentation to show that they're still
 
06:24:38.830 --> 06:24:38.840 align:start position:0%
eligible so the benefit duration would
 
06:24:41.468 --> 06:24:41.478 align:start position:0%
be longer that would also save the state
 
06:24:44.670 --> 06:24:44.680 align:start position:0%
from having to process those as
 
06:24:47.548 --> 06:24:47.558 align:start position:0%
well we do believe that it would uh
 
06:24:51.310 --> 06:24:51.320 align:start position:0%
provide for an increase in participation
 
06:24:52.708 --> 06:24:52.718 align:start position:0%
uh because it would eliminate some of
 
06:24:57.110 --> 06:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:00.750 --> 06:25:00.760 align:start position:0%
program the question no thank you
 
06:25:03.110 --> 06:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
represent MCU thank you Mr chairman
 
06:25:05.670 --> 06:25:05.680 align:start position:0%
thanks for coming um I've always thought
 
06:25:08.310 --> 06:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
that food stamps are 100% Federal
 
06:25:12.350 --> 06:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
program but this bill has a $12 million
 
06:25:15.788 --> 06:25:15.798 align:start position:0%
general fund cost and what part of that
 
06:25:15.798 --> 06:25:18.070 align:start position:0%
general fund cost and what part of that
is

06:25:18.070 --> 06:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:21.510 --> 06:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
wrong so the the yes the snap program
 
06:25:24.350 --> 06:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
the benefit itself is 100% federally
 
06:25:28.070 --> 06:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
funded uh so but I believe that there
 
06:25:30.468 --> 06:25:30.478 align:start position:0%
are other uh cost associated with this
 
06:25:33.190 --> 06:25:33.200 align:start position:0%
bill that are part of the provisions for
 
06:25:34.910 --> 06:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
the uh New Hampshire education
 
06:25:37.390 --> 06:25:37.400 align:start position:0%
department and not ones that I can speak
 
06:25:41.590 --> 06:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
to I'm happy to speak to um the cost
 
06:25:44.788 --> 06:25:44.798 align:start position:0%
associated with the summer EBT program
 
06:25:47.150 --> 06:25:47.160 align:start position:0%
or the simplified
 
06:25:49.990 --> 06:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
application thank you
 
06:25:53.390 --> 06:25:53.400 align:start position:0%
may you want to answer my question no no
 
06:25:58.750 --> 06:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
okay all right um so along those lines
 
06:26:03.788 --> 06:26:03.798 align:start position:0%
um we heard that this raises the um the
 
06:26:05.548 --> 06:26:05.558 align:start position:0%
elig ility to
 
06:26:10.750 --> 06:26:10.760 align:start position:0%
185% of poverty what is it
 
06:26:14.310 --> 06:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
now so for the summer EBT program is
 
06:26:16.230 --> 06:26:16.240 align:start position:0%
that what you're referring to or either
 
06:26:19.270 --> 06:26:19.280 align:start position:0%
one of them yeah um how about just for
 
06:26:22.270 --> 06:26:22.280 align:start position:0%
for snap in general for snap in general
 
06:26:25.150 --> 06:26:25.160 align:start position:0%
for for the the PO general population
 
06:26:28.150 --> 06:26:28.160 align:start position:0%
the eligibility uh goes up to 200% of
 
06:26:30.868 --> 06:26:30.878 align:start position:0%
federal property level okay so however
 
06:26:34.350 --> 06:26:34.360 align:start position:0%
for the summer EBT program uh the eligib
 
06:26:36.750 --> 06:26:36.760 align:start position:0%
ility is for children who are also
 
06:26:38.990 --> 06:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
eligible for the National School meals
 
06:26:41.430 --> 06:26:41.440 align:start position:0%
program that income limit as I
 
06:26:44.468 --> 06:26:44.478 align:start position:0%
understand it is 18 185% federal poverty
 
06:26:48.310 --> 06:26:48.320 align:start position:0%
level the summer EBT program is
 
06:26:51.708 --> 06:26:51.718 align:start position:0%
purposely a separate program from snap
 
06:26:54.350 --> 06:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
there are similarities there are similar
 
06:26:56.788 --> 06:26:56.798 align:start position:0%
objectives however to administer the
 
06:26:59.350 --> 06:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
program it is a very separate program
 
06:26:59.360 --> 06:27:00.830 align:start position:0%
program it is a very separate program
from

06:27:00.830 --> 06:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
from
 
06:27:04.990 --> 06:27:05.000 align:start position:0%
snap just one more so so then anybody
 
06:27:09.350 --> 06:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
who is eligible for summer EBT is also
 
06:27:12.150 --> 06:27:12.160 align:start position:0%
eligible for SNAP is that right they
 
06:27:14.110 --> 06:27:14.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely could apply for SNAP and be
 
06:27:16.390 --> 06:27:16.400 align:start position:0%
eligible for SNAP as well so we see this
 
06:27:20.350 --> 06:27:20.360 align:start position:0%
as a as certainly uh the possibility of
 
06:27:23.590 --> 06:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
increasing the um utilization of SNAP
 
06:27:26.350 --> 06:27:26.360 align:start position:0%
benefits if we were to attract others by
 
06:27:30.070 --> 06:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
way of the summer EBT program thank you
 
06:27:31.190 --> 06:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
have further
 
06:27:33.590 --> 06:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
Ron well I know we're getting another
 
06:27:37.868 --> 06:27:37.878 align:start position:0%
fiscal note yet yet another one um but
 
06:27:41.350 --> 06:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
does the department know what kinds of
 
06:27:45.070 --> 06:27:45.080 align:start position:0%
onetime expenditures you would need um
 
06:27:49.310 --> 06:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
to do the EBT card yes would you like me
 
06:27:51.830 --> 06:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
to review that yes that'd be great okay
 
06:27:54.868 --> 06:27:54.878 align:start position:0%
so for one time uh standup I'll refer to
 
06:27:57.868 --> 06:27:57.878 align:start position:0%
it as standup costs uh there are cost
 
06:28:01.030 --> 06:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
associated with the electronic benefit
 
06:28:04.270 --> 06:28:04.280 align:start position:0%
transfer vendor they are in charge of
 
06:28:07.310 --> 06:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
the the card basically uh so they would
 
06:28:10.070 --> 06:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
need to make a system change uh and as I
 
06:28:11.788 --> 06:28:11.798 align:start position:0%
understand it that is a one-time expense
 
06:28:14.230 --> 06:28:14.240 align:start position:0%
of 233,000
 
06:28:17.868 --> 06:28:17.878 align:start position:0%
we would also need to change our random
 
06:28:21.468 --> 06:28:21.478 align:start position:0%
moment sample uh system with respect to
 
06:28:24.510 --> 06:28:24.520 align:start position:0%
the allocation of time that staff spend
 
06:28:26.948 --> 06:28:26.958 align:start position:0%
on administering the summer EBT program
 
06:28:28.990 --> 06:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
versus a snap program because it would
 
06:28:31.910 --> 06:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
be the same eligibility staff uh so
 
06:28:34.628 --> 06:28:34.638 align:start position:0%
there's a $115,000 onetime fee
 
06:28:37.830 --> 06:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
for changes to that particular system
 
06:28:42.510 --> 06:28:42.520 align:start position:0%
there is also a um one-time system
 
06:28:46.070 --> 06:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
change well there actually two um for
 
06:28:48.150 --> 06:28:48.160 align:start position:0%
the eligibility and enrollment
 
06:28:50.430 --> 06:28:50.440 align:start position:0%
integrated eligibility system known as
 
06:28:53.468 --> 06:28:53.478 align:start position:0%
New Heights that particular system in
 
06:28:58.788 --> 06:28:58.798 align:start position:0%
order to stand up a program that would
 
06:29:01.468 --> 06:29:01.478 align:start position:0%
distribute a benefit for the summer of
 
06:29:04.948 --> 06:29:04.958 align:start position:0%
24 because it is the summer of 2 for
 
06:29:07.190 --> 06:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
that the US Department of Agriculture
 
06:29:10.270 --> 06:29:10.280 align:start position:0%
has has established this program to
 
06:29:13.548 --> 06:29:13.558 align:start position:0%
begin that we would be looking at a
 
06:29:16.310 --> 06:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
one-time cost of
 
06:29:19.708 --> 06:29:19.718 align:start position:0%
$110,000 just to for system changes that
 
06:29:22.070 --> 06:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
would support a distribution of that
 
06:29:25.510 --> 06:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
benefit for the summer of
 
06:29:28.110 --> 06:29:28.120 align:start position:0%
24 however there
 
06:29:30.590 --> 06:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
are that being said there are a number
 
06:29:32.430 --> 06:29:32.440 align:start position:0%
of flexibilities that the federal
 
06:29:35.788 --> 06:29:35.798 align:start position:0%
government is is offering to States in
 
06:29:38.310 --> 06:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
order to stand up a program for a summer
 
06:29:43.030 --> 06:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
of 24 benefit so they're allowing states
 
06:29:46.030 --> 06:29:46.040 align:start position:0%
to apply for waivers for certain
 
06:29:48.628 --> 06:29:48.638 align:start position:0%
flexibilities of a number of the
 
06:29:51.310 --> 06:29:51.320 align:start position:0%
requirements they have in order to uh
 
06:29:54.110 --> 06:29:54.120 align:start position:0%
stand up this program but those
 
06:29:57.190 --> 06:29:57.200 align:start position:0%
requirements will end up being in place
 
06:29:59.070 --> 06:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
for the summer of
 
06:30:04.110 --> 06:30:04.120 align:start position:0%
25 distribution benefit so the requir
 
06:30:06.990 --> 06:30:07.000 align:start position:0%
ments to to meet those requirements
 
06:30:09.230 --> 06:30:09.240 align:start position:0%
there are system changes that need to be
 
06:30:11.430 --> 06:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
made those system
 
06:30:15.670 --> 06:30:15.680 align:start position:0%
changes uh just look at
 
06:30:18.590 --> 06:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
the total for
 
06:30:20.628 --> 06:30:20.638 align:start position:0%
that is
 
06:30:20.638 --> 06:30:24.468 align:start position:0%
that is
$1,320

06:30:24.468 --> 06:30:24.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:27.868 --> 06:30:27.878 align:start position:0%
th000 so for a summer of 24
 
06:30:30.948 --> 06:30:30.958 align:start position:0%
benefit the state would be seeking
 
06:30:33.350 --> 06:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
$110,000 just to be able to implement
 
06:30:34.750 --> 06:30:34.760 align:start position:0%
that benefit
 
06:30:36.548 --> 06:30:36.558 align:start position:0%
we are asking the federal government
 
06:30:38.868 --> 06:30:38.878 align:start position:0%
that we utilize an already uh
 
06:30:40.788 --> 06:30:40.798 align:start position:0%
established program that is in place in
 
06:30:44.468 --> 06:30:44.478 align:start position:0%
which we distributed the pandemic EBT
 
06:30:48.110 --> 06:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
benefit you may remember that as long as
 
06:30:51.230 --> 06:30:51.240 align:start position:0%
we're able to use that particular
 
06:30:54.590 --> 06:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
process that we already had built we can
 
06:30:57.948 --> 06:30:57.958 align:start position:0%
distribute a summer of 24 benefit we are
 
06:31:00.070 --> 06:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
asking the food nutrition services to
 
06:31:01.590 --> 06:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
approve that
 
06:31:04.190 --> 06:31:04.200 align:start position:0%
plan however we will not have have the
 
06:31:08.670 --> 06:31:08.680 align:start position:0%
same waivers for a summer of 25 benefit
 
06:31:10.708 --> 06:31:10.718 align:start position:0%
we will be expected to meet all of the
 
06:31:13.388 --> 06:31:13.398 align:start position:0%
requirements for this particular program
 
06:31:16.230 --> 06:31:16.240 align:start position:0%
which come with additional system
 
06:31:20.430 --> 06:31:20.440 align:start position:0%
changes also one time but at a higher a
 
06:31:22.708 --> 06:31:22.718 align:start position:0%
higher price that being the
 
06:31:22.718 --> 06:31:27.110 align:start position:0%
higher price that being the
$1,320

06:31:27.110 --> 06:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:30.070 --> 06:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
th000 I just had a question do you see
 
06:31:32.230 --> 06:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
this as a program that will continue on
 
06:31:33.910 --> 06:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
so that if New Hampshire made that
 
06:31:35.708 --> 06:31:35.718 align:start position:0%
investment it would be something that
 
06:31:38.430 --> 06:31:38.440 align:start position:0%
would be many year it would cover us for
 
06:31:40.830 --> 06:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
many years that that would be the intent
 
06:31:42.708 --> 06:31:42.718 align:start position:0%
yes thank
 
06:31:44.990 --> 06:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
you further questions from committee
 
06:31:46.708 --> 06:31:46.718 align:start position:0%
members representative tersi thank you
 
06:31:50.270 --> 06:31:50.280 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you that I'll the
 
06:31:51.910 --> 06:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
figures you just outlaid is that the
 
06:31:53.830 --> 06:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
bulk of the changes in the new fiscal
 
06:31:56.230 --> 06:31:56.240 align:start position:0%
Noe or do you anticipate anything else I
 
06:31:58.868 --> 06:31:58.878 align:start position:0%
don't know if Mr Ripple can answer
 
06:32:02.788 --> 06:32:02.798 align:start position:0%
that oh no feel free um the HHS
 
06:32:04.430 --> 06:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
component of the new fiscal isn't going
 
06:32:06.150 --> 06:32:06.160 align:start position:0%
to change it's really the doe part
 
06:32:08.110 --> 06:32:08.120 align:start position:0%
that'll change as a result of the second
 
06:32:10.548 --> 06:32:10.558 align:start position:0%
Senate Amendment so the table that you
 
06:32:12.310 --> 06:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
see at the end of the fiscal note is
 
06:32:13.830 --> 06:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
still accurate and I believe I think
 
06:32:15.110 --> 06:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
some of the numbers that you just
 
06:32:17.430 --> 06:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
referenced include the federal component
 
06:32:19.468 --> 06:32:19.478 align:start position:0%
as well so that's the total share the
 
06:32:21.590 --> 06:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
state share is reflected here in the
 
06:32:23.990 --> 06:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal note thank you that's a very
 
06:32:26.670 --> 06:32:26.680 align:start position:0%
important Point uh yes s so my numbers
 
06:32:29.670 --> 06:32:29.680 align:start position:0%
are really the total cost of that but
 
06:32:32.708 --> 06:32:32.718 align:start position:0%
the uh federal government will uh pay
 
06:32:34.670 --> 06:32:34.680 align:start position:0%
for 50%
 
06:32:39.270 --> 06:32:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:41.628 --> 06:32:41.638 align:start position:0%
expenses anything
 
06:32:44.628 --> 06:32:44.638 align:start position:0%

06:32:50.070 --> 06:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um because of this
 
06:32:52.868 --> 06:32:52.878 align:start position:0%
investment what do you anticipate will
 
06:32:55.948 --> 06:32:55.958 align:start position:0%
be the return in monetary services for
 
06:32:57.868 --> 06:32:57.878 align:start position:0%
people in our
 
06:33:00.388 --> 06:33:00.398 align:start position:0%
state so if I understand your question
 
06:33:02.868 --> 06:33:02.878 align:start position:0%
thank you we are anticipating that this
 
06:33:06.388 --> 06:33:06.398 align:start position:0%
will benefit over 30,000 children in the
 
06:33:10.310 --> 06:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
state so you know for a benefit of
 
06:33:14.910 --> 06:33:14.920 align:start position:0%
$120 for a summer period uh for for over
 
06:33:18.910 --> 06:33:18.920 align:start position:0%
30,000 children that is basically the
 
06:33:21.628 --> 06:33:21.638 align:start position:0%
the intent of that benefit does that
