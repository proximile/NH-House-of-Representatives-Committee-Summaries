00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:43.990 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 align:start position:0%
it's 10 o' we can get started
 
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 align:start position:0%
so my goal for to for today and and
 
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
possibly tomorrow is to finish house
 
00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 align:start position:0%
build to as given to us by the governor
 
00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 align:start position:0%
obviously there's going to be plenty of
 
00:01:00.029 --> 00:01:00.039 align:start position:0%
additions and other things um or at
 
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
least get as close to that as we can in
 
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
particular Melissa do we have um the
 
00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice coming at some
 
00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:10.759 align:start position:0%
point to talk about their sections I
 
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 align:start position:0%
have an email out to them I gave them
 
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 align:start position:0%
the option for today or tomorrow but I
 
00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 align:start position:0%
did message them this morning
 
00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 align:start position:0%
so I do not have a response back so I
 
00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 align:start position:0%
would assume that will be probably
 
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 align:start position:0%
tomorrow okay all right so so we may
 
00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 align:start position:0%
have to skip over those particulars ones
 
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
why don't we sort of just go you know
 
00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 align:start position:0%
start at at page one and um talk about
 
00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 align:start position:0%
you know go through the list of House
 
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 align:start position:0%
Bill two um so the first one is bail now
 
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 align:start position:0%
we know there's a big Bill coming uh to
 
00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 align:start position:0%
the house Thursday so I was tending to
 
00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 align:start position:0%
think we just take this out and put that
 
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 align:start position:0%
in or or or talk about it when we get
 
00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 align:start position:0%
that bill does that make sense yeah yeah
 
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
I don't think that bill is all that
 
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 align:start position:0%
different from this one but the the
 
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 align:start position:0%
problem with the bill um as I understand
 
00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
it that's being voted on on Thursday
 
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 align:start position:0%
with the committee amendment is that it
 
00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
does balloon
 
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 align:start position:0%
costs um and and
 
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
mostly um costs for counties right
 
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
because basically that bill says it
 
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
lowers the um the the threshold for
 
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
keeping somebody in jail without bail so
 
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
they they they would stay in jail longer
 
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
and and the um criteria for keeping them
 
00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
is lowered so
 
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
therefore probably a lot more people
 
00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:46.159 align:start position:0%
would be in jail that's that's more you
 
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
know County costs so uh so there is a
 
00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 align:start position:0%
cost element to that bill that we will
 
00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
want to talk about okay any other
 
00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 align:start position:0%
thoughts on bail anybody want say
 
00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
anything we're happy okay so we're going
 
00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 align:start position:0%
to wait on that one um all this um
 
00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 align:start position:0%
fishing game move move things
 
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
around um between you know shuffle the
 
00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 align:start position:0%
the the chairs between fishing game and
 
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
um uh dncr and and and Department of
 
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.270 align:start position:0%
um uh dncr and and and Department of
Environmental

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 align:start position:0%
Environmental
 
00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 align:start position:0%
Services I'm generally okay with that I
 
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 align:start position:0%
mean I don't any any objections um well
 
00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 align:start position:0%
I mean I think I'm generally okay with
 
00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 align:start position:0%
their proposal um I think you know we're
 
00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 align:start position:0%
going to have a public I mean I I'm not
 
00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:38.439 align:start position:0%
sure you're proposing to vote on it
 
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 align:start position:0%
today but yeah I was I'm well because we
 
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
haven't even had a public hearing on
 
00:03:46.429 --> 00:03:46.439 align:start position:0%
this and I think a lot of people are be
 
00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 align:start position:0%
really interested in this and um I I
 
00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 align:start position:0%
just feel like you want to wait till
 
00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
Friday I would yes Mr chair I think that
 
00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
would considering it's a huge uh
 
00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 align:start position:0%
portion it's Wednesday we're having a
 
00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 align:start position:0%
regular house bill yeah Wednesday
 
00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 align:start position:0%
afternoon I mean I I will I'll I'll
 
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 align:start position:0%
mention one thing that I had a thought
 
00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:10.879 align:start position:0%
about um and that is that all the with
 
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
all the uh I'll call it rig rolling
 
00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
around I believe this section is
 
00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 align:start position:0%
supposed to be effective upon signature
 
00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 align:start position:0%
by the governor and um it just seems to
 
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
me that pushing it out to December 31st
 
00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
or something like that would make sense
 
00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 align:start position:0%
because I don't know how they can have
 
00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:33.639 align:start position:0%
everything like up and running by the
 
00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
day that she signs it so that was my
 
00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 align:start position:0%
thought yeah my my general impression is
 
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
all these people are working together
 
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
anyways right it's it's just one happens
 
00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
to be sitting here but when they move
 
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 align:start position:0%
they're still going to be doing their
 
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
same job so well we can ask Dees too
 
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 align:start position:0%
about that I mean sometimes those sorts
 
00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 align:start position:0%
of things don't make it in here because
 
00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 align:start position:0%
people are watching the substance and I
 
00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
also I was just going to say I think the
 
00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 align:start position:0%
fishing game positions were funded
 
00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:04.639 align:start position:0%
through December 31st I don't know but
 
00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 align:start position:0%
we can we can talk about that's accurate
 
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
they funded with arpa funds through uh
 
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
December 31st and then they'll switch
 
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 align:start position:0%
over to General General funds in January
 
00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:16.639 align:start position:0%
okay okay all right so uh Melissa do you
 
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
want to prepare an amendment maybe to to
 
00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
to uh change that effective date for all
 
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 align:start position:0%
of these sections sure would you that we
 
00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
can consider yep um and I believe our
 
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 align:start position:0%
the Amendment would also include
 
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 align:start position:0%
removing the
 
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 align:start position:0%
$275,000 appropriation for that
 
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
scientist position because that's in hb1
 
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 align:start position:0%
already so it's a double appropriation
 
00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 align:start position:0%
on that one oh yes yeah that's a good
 
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
idea but that could be right away right
 
00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:49.039 align:start position:0%
I figure I would do one big Amendment to
 
00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:51.319 align:start position:0%
the section if that's what you wanted
 
00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
and and and generally include the their
 
00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:55.639 align:start position:0%
red line and that was going to be my
 
00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 align:start position:0%
second question and include their Red
 
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 align:start position:0%
Line because I didn't so the main so
 
00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:03.160 align:start position:0%
we're talking about sections two through
 
00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
five I guess right yeah and I didn't see
 
00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 align:start position:0%
anything else um specifically
 
00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.000 align:start position:0%
objectionable the one thing the one
 
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
thing that I one concern I had with you
 
00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.000 align:start position:0%
know what Dees was shared with us um and
 
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
it's in their red line that I think is
 
00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
related to all of this is the fact that
 
00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:25.759 align:start position:0%
they say they need 180 days to do the
 
00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:29.720 align:start position:0%
rule making MH seemed really long
 
00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:31.720 align:start position:0%
I mean they changed it from 30 to 180
 
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
days I mean I think I'm sorry go ahead
 
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
representative evil yeah um I just I I
 
00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:41.240 align:start position:0%
agree with you it seems long but I think
 
00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
that when um Mr kpo was here he said
 
00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:46.520 align:start position:0%
that they didn't intend it to take that
 
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
long I think what they were trying to do
 
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
was give themselves a little space so
 
00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
and I and I there's a middle ground I
 
00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:55.360 align:start position:0%
heard that and I guess yeah that's what
 
00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:57.560 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking is you know let's let let's
 
00:07:02.869 --> 00:07:02.879 align:start position:0%
make it let's set I say so so let me
 
00:07:05.869 --> 00:07:05.879 align:start position:0%
point out the actual sentence here is
 
00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:09.479 align:start position:0%
such rule making shall begin within such
 
00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:11.800 align:start position:0%
and such so it's not that it has to be
 
00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:14.639 align:start position:0%
accomplished by by so it's even worse
 
00:07:18.589 --> 00:07:18.599 align:start position:0%
exactly right I think what he said was
 
00:07:21.749 --> 00:07:21.759 align:start position:0%
the whole jel car process so the the I
 
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
think the the problem is that they were
 
00:07:27.309 --> 00:07:27.319 align:start position:0%
interpreting it when they were talking
 
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
like they had to have everything done
 
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
within the 180 days and Jael car is a
 
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
very there's a long process for adopting
 
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
rules I don't know Melissa yes they
 
00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
spoke on two parts they said one
 
00:07:41.309 --> 00:07:41.319 align:start position:0%
Gathering all the entities that would be
 
00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:43.720 align:start position:0%
involved to make sure that the ru making
 
00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
is what is expected from the public so
 
00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:49.720 align:start position:0%
all the um uh stakeholders would need to
 
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
be included and then the second part I
 
00:07:52.909 --> 00:07:52.919 align:start position:0%
do think they were concerned of just
 
00:07:55.469 --> 00:07:55.479 align:start position:0%
hitting the to have the rules effective
 
00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
but I do agree it does read a little bit
 
00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
different in here that it said shall
 
00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
begin it doesn't they shall be completed
 
00:08:04.589 --> 00:08:04.599 align:start position:0%
yeah so yeah so maybe complete or I
 
00:08:08.629 --> 00:08:08.639 align:start position:0%
don't know maybe um we begin within 90
 
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:11.000 align:start position:0%
days or something like begin within 30
 
00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:13.720 align:start position:0%
and end within 90 or something or well
 
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
ending is tough CU ending is tough or
 
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:18.360 align:start position:0%
maybe well I would say begin at least
 
00:08:21.629 --> 00:08:21.639 align:start position:0%
within 60 I think I think yeah well the
 
00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
question is if we think of begin as when
 
00:08:26.149 --> 00:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
they hold the public hearing for these
 
00:08:28.029 --> 00:08:28.039 align:start position:0%
rules yeah they're not going to do it
 
00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
within 30 days that that wouldn't happen
 
00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:32.919 align:start position:0%
within 30 I mean I'm a fan of 90
 
00:08:36.589 --> 00:08:36.599 align:start position:0%
honestly 90 okay all right let's
 
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:39.200 align:start position:0%
let's a completion date as well and say
 
00:08:40.949 --> 00:08:40.959 align:start position:0%
maybe the completion is 180 because
 
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
that's not under their control really is
 
00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:45.800 align:start position:0%
the problem so so yeah so let's let's
 
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
make the N 180 to 90 Melissa and um and
 
00:08:52.269 --> 00:08:52.279 align:start position:0%
we'll just have the understanding that
 
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
begin means the public hearing for those
 
00:08:58.949 --> 00:08:58.959 align:start position:0%
rules right because you know sometimes
 
00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
they have a public hearing then they go
 
00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:02.360 align:start position:0%
back and make changes and all kinds of
 
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
stuff okay um other comments on these
 
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
sections okay good all right so now we
 
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
can go on
 
00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
to um that was section two through five
 
00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:20.440 align:start position:0%
right so now we have this native plant
 
00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:25.000 align:start position:0%
stuff uh six through eight I guess it is
 
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
well let's
 
00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:43.509 align:start position:0%
 
eight

00:09:43.509 --> 00:09:43.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:46.120 align:start position:0%
yeah no I don't I don't have a problem
 
00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:49.030 align:start position:0%
yeah no I don't I don't have a problem
with

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
this just a
 
00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
definition right yeah is this a new fee
 
00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.389 align:start position:0%
definition right yeah is this a new fee
here

00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
for charge a fee for um screen the
 
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
database no that's existing Lang Melissa
 
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
on so on page nine uh Roman one I think
 
00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:11.079 align:start position:0%
that's just a deletion from the existing
 
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
statute isn't
 
00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.630 align:start position:0%
statute isn't
it

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
P I'm looking at page eight oh I
 
00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:25.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
30 I know that's a new fee yeah but I
 
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
think it's okay
 
00:10:33.269 --> 00:10:33.279 align:start position:0%
just I think it's the it's the fee that
 
00:10:35.949 --> 00:10:35.959 align:start position:0%
was being charged by dncr and now
 
00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
they're allowing it to be
 
00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:39.800 align:start position:0%
charged because they're switching
 
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:41.680 align:start position:0%
because they're moving them around I see
 
00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:45.880 align:start position:0%
so this is more of moving people this
 
00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
section it looks that way because the
 
00:10:52.069 --> 00:10:52.079 align:start position:0%
reason I thought it was different was
 
00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
the the red line thing was changes to
 
00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
sections 2 through five but maybe maybe
 
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:00.160 align:start position:0%
they're just not changing this is more
 
00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:04.160 align:start position:0%
of the same yeah okay yes so their their
 
00:11:07.069 --> 00:11:07.079 align:start position:0%
notes say that um it's just to help move
 
00:11:08.949 --> 00:11:08.959 align:start position:0%
the functions um of Performing the
 
00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:12.760 align:start position:0%
environmental review to Dees okay so so
 
00:11:15.069 --> 00:11:15.079 align:start position:0%
it's really two through eight that's
 
00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
moving those people and yeah Mr chair um
 
00:11:22.829 --> 00:11:22.839 align:start position:0%
represent thank you um so th because
 
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
right now I the uh revenue from those
 
00:11:27.829 --> 00:11:27.839 align:start position:0%
fees is going to be in hb1 under New
 
00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire native uh uh the natural and
 
00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
cultural resources correct so will this
 
00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
amendment change hb1 so that that
 
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
revenue from fees is now with Dees and
 
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
not an
 
00:11:44.069 --> 00:11:44.079 align:start position:0%
hgr is that what we yes I I would think
 
00:11:46.069 --> 00:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
so right because it's going to
 
00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services so
 
00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
is in hb1 are the the fee revenues which
 
00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:53.320 align:start position:0%
department is that under now because
 
00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
that hb1 would have to be amended to
 
00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
reflect the revenue being received in
 
00:11:59.230 --> 00:11:59.240 align:start position:0%
Dees so the fees don't necess
 
00:12:03.069 --> 00:12:03.079 align:start position:0%
necessarily tie to the payment um and
 
00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
what's in hb1 is those positions will be
 
00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
moved in this section from
 
00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:11.560 align:start position:0%
dncr to uh Dees and then it will be
 
00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:14.920 align:start position:0%
funded with the other agency um the
 
00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
other agency funding so on a high level
 
00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
it doesn't work exactly the way you said
 
00:12:23.189 --> 00:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
but yes those you'll have a a reduction
 
00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:27.320 align:start position:0%
in other agency income in dncr and
 
00:12:29.629 --> 00:12:29.639 align:start position:0%
you'll have an increase in other agency
 
00:12:32.629 --> 00:12:32.639 align:start position:0%
income in Dees so they'll offset each
 
00:12:35.269 --> 00:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
other in the budget so at the end it's a
 
00:12:40.189 --> 00:12:40.199 align:start position:0%
zero okay so Net Zero um so but right
 
00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
now if I were to go into hb1 I would see
 
00:12:46.829 --> 00:12:46.839 align:start position:0%
those positions not in Dees so hb2 would
 
00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:48.160 align:start position:0%
then change
 
00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:50.440 align:start position:0%
hb1 for the positions not for the
 
00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
revenues that's what I was making this
 
00:12:54.389 --> 00:12:54.399 align:start position:0%
for the expenditures it would change the
 
00:12:58.790 --> 00:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
expenditures from um dncr will have a
 
00:13:01.629 --> 00:13:01.639 align:start position:0%
reduction and expenditures when we want
 
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
you guys to vote vote on the hb1
 
00:13:05.509 --> 00:13:05.519 align:start position:0%
adjustments because there's a couple of
 
00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
changes and we can talk about that next
 
00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
week because what is in hb1 currently
 
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
does not reflect what dncr and Dees
 
00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
asked I think the governor moved um
 
00:13:18.829 --> 00:13:18.839 align:start position:0%
three positions and there should have
 
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:20.720 align:start position:0%
only been one position that moved so
 
00:13:24.509 --> 00:13:24.519 align:start position:0%
there's some me moving parts for hb1
 
00:13:26.069 --> 00:13:26.079 align:start position:0%
okay I got it thank you and the other
 
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
thing is line 32 on page eight makes it
 
00:13:31.949 --> 00:13:31.959 align:start position:0%
clear that these fees are there to cover
 
00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:34.760 align:start position:0%
this particular cost yeah right so
 
00:13:36.269 --> 00:13:36.279 align:start position:0%
they're connected they do cover just in
 
00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
hb1 you're not going to see those fees
 
00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:39.720 align:start position:0%
in the line is what I was saying that's
 
00:13:44.509 --> 00:13:44.519 align:start position:0%
fine okay so now we are through number
 
00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
eight I guess it is right y so let's go
 
00:13:49.509 --> 00:13:49.519 align:start position:0%
to number are you okay with their red
 
00:13:50.949 --> 00:13:50.959 align:start position:0%
lines you want me to do the amendment do
 
00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:52.600 align:start position:0%
you want that to be do you want me to
 
00:13:54.269 --> 00:13:54.279 align:start position:0%
push out the effective dat and change it
 
00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:58.160 align:start position:0%
to 90 days yes except for the double
 
00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
counting part
 
00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:02.920 align:start position:0%
yes six through
 
00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:06.040 align:start position:0%
eight six through eight yes so six
 
00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
through eight their red line just wants
 
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
to chain the rules on that section as
 
00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
well from 30 to 180 would you like that
 
00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
to be 0 that should be 90 and the
 
00:14:17.749 --> 00:14:17.759 align:start position:0%
effective date bumped out on that one as
 
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:20.720 align:start position:0%
well um
 
00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:23.480 align:start position:0%
yes it's all part of the thing okay are
 
00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
we voting to approve or just I think
 
00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:28.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to be informed we we decided
 
00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
to listen to in case somebody comes to
 
00:14:33.389 --> 00:14:33.399 align:start position:0%
the public hearing and gives gives us
 
00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
new information we're going to wait till
 
00:14:37.269 --> 00:14:37.279 align:start position:0%
Friday okay all right and what I'll do
 
00:14:39.069 --> 00:14:39.079 align:start position:0%
if it's fine with you Mr chair based on
 
00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
this we'll get the Amendments ready so
 
00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
then when we go and vote on Friday
 
00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
you'll have the Amendments language in
 
00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
front of you okay good all right now
 
00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:51.560 align:start position:0%
boat house so
 
00:14:53.389 --> 00:14:53.399 align:start position:0%
um there are
 
00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:56.240 align:start position:0%
two two sections I guess or more there's
 
00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
a few sections here um
 
00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:09.160 align:start position:0%
minute section n nine okay yeah so it's
 
00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.749 align:start position:0%
minute section n nine okay yeah so it's
9

00:15:11.749 --> 00:15:11.759 align:start position:0%
9
 
00:15:16.949 --> 00:15:16.959 align:start position:0%
through um N9 and 10 and
 
00:15:21.069 --> 00:15:21.079 align:start position:0%
11 well nine and 10 is the defition 15
 
00:15:24.269 --> 00:15:24.279 align:start position:0%
and 16 yeah it's it's kind of two places
 
00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:27.160 align:start position:0%
I guess it's pull it out 9 10 15 and 16
 
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
is a little hard to do on the okay
 
00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
so right so this is about Boat House
 
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
let's talk about boat houses right so
 
00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:40.600 align:start position:0%
right now um so I looked in one thing he
 
00:15:43.189 --> 00:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
said to us was they're currently only
 
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
permitting boat houses dug in right
 
00:15:48.509 --> 00:15:48.519 align:start position:0%
they're not permitting them
 
00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
overwat but they lost a lawsuit related
 
00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
to it and that's why they want to add
 
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
this stuff right okay so I searched the
 
00:15:59.350 --> 00:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
rsas for the word Boat House it appears
 
00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:02.600 align:start position:0%
exactly once okay and in the definition
 
00:16:06.269 --> 00:16:06.279 align:start position:0%
of Boat House well it's it's it's part
 
00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:10.040 align:start position:0%
of a definition of of a water related
 
00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:12.040 align:start position:0%
structure or something like that right
 
00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
so it's only in a definition and that
 
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
particular definition says that the
 
00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:21.720 align:start position:0%
structure can be over water right so it
 
00:16:24.189 --> 00:16:24.199 align:start position:0%
has it doesn't say anything about dug in
 
00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
or or not dug in or whatever so it's
 
00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
clear why they lost this lawsuit because
 
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:32.920 align:start position:0%
law making that distinction it must be
 
00:16:37.389 --> 00:16:37.399 align:start position:0%
just their rules right so
 
00:16:40.629 --> 00:16:40.639 align:start position:0%
um anyways and and there's nothing about
 
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
as far as I can tell there's nothing
 
00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:44.920 align:start position:0%
about height in that section that
 
00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
current law so putting this stuff in is
 
00:16:52.949 --> 00:16:52.959 align:start position:0%
is definitely new law um maybe it's
 
00:16:54.749 --> 00:16:54.759 align:start position:0%
reasonable because it's you know a big
 
00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
new practice but it's anyways we should
 
00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:00.040 align:start position:0%
be aware of it I guess
 
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yes M representative Griffin
 
00:17:04.909 --> 00:17:04.919 align:start position:0%
this is stuff that clearly should be a
 
00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
separate bill it's there's no reason for
 
00:17:10.429 --> 00:17:10.439 align:start position:0%
it to be an hb2 it isn't really
 
00:17:13.429 --> 00:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
supporting the budget it's changing the
 
00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
law yeah you know I I would tend to
 
00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
agree with you with the one exception
 
00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:23.720 align:start position:0%
that it's urgent because because um they
 
00:17:25.429 --> 00:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
lost this lawsuit their current
 
00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:29.559 align:start position:0%
practices are changing Etc so
 
00:17:32.789 --> 00:17:32.799 align:start position:0%
um I did ask for uh the resources
 
00:17:35.909 --> 00:17:35.919 align:start position:0%
committee to give us feedback and um
 
00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:39.640 align:start position:0%
haven't quite gotten it yet but um in
 
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
general the only thing I I spoke to the
 
00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:45.320 align:start position:0%
chair of resources he had looked it over
 
00:17:47.789 --> 00:17:47.799 align:start position:0%
he had his his vice chair had not yet
 
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
looked it over and they said uh they
 
00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
didn't highlight this this section yet
 
00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
so I don't know representative evil I
 
00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:00.799 align:start position:0%
mean I I would I agree with both you and
 
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin but I I think the
 
00:18:08.789 --> 00:18:08.799 align:start position:0%
more persuasive issue is that they
 
00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:11.000 align:start position:0%
really feel that need that needs to be
 
00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
done because of this lawsuit I mean the
 
00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:15.080 align:start position:0%
only other thing we'll see what the
 
00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:18.280 align:start position:0%
public hearing uh produces but I don't
 
00:18:21.149 --> 00:18:21.159 align:start position:0%
know about you representative the other
 
00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
I haven't heard from a Lakes Association
 
00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
about this to express any concern um and
 
00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
they're aware of HB to and the various
 
00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:33.400 align:start position:0%
Provisions so okay I mean I'm I'm okay
 
00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
with this I think it's I think it's
 
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
needed okay so represent C yes uh thank
 
00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I agree because it's an
 
00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:43.799 align:start position:0%
urgent matter I am I am on uh one of the
 
00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:47.480 align:start position:0%
uh uh Lake Conservation groups and this
 
00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
would be a disaster if people started
 
00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:52.440 align:start position:0%
building hotels you know so on the water
 
00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
on the water since they they lost the
 
00:18:57.669 --> 00:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
lawsuit and since there's currently no
 
00:18:59.350 --> 00:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
guard rails around
 
00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
what you can build this needs to go in
 
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
and it needs to go in immediately okay
 
00:19:05.909 --> 00:19:05.919 align:start position:0%
all right so nine and 10 are just
 
00:19:09.149 --> 00:19:09.159 align:start position:0%
definitions right so
 
00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
um can we can we maybe approve nine and
 
00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
10 is
 
00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
that and I'll second it or all those in
 
00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:23.480 align:start position:0%
favor yes against what give a chance to
 
00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:29.200 align:start position:0%
catch okay all right um
 
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
so we'll get back to boat house or do we
 
00:19:33.909 --> 00:19:33.919 align:start position:0%
want us as long as we're here on boat
 
00:19:36.669 --> 00:19:36.679 align:start position:0%
houses where's the second part of it
 
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
15 okay yeah so this is the boat house
 
00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
requirements so there's a number of
 
00:20:00.029 --> 00:20:00.039 align:start position:0%
things in here that bothered me
 
00:20:02.909 --> 00:20:02.919 align:start position:0%
um first of all the effective date
 
00:20:05.909 --> 00:20:05.919 align:start position:0%
February 20th 2025 so this feels like
 
00:20:05.919 --> 00:20:07.390 align:start position:0%
February 20th 2025 so this feels like
Expos

00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:07.400 align:start position:0%
Expos
 
00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:09.720 align:start position:0%
facto law
 
00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
right so I tend to think that should be
 
00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:17.400 align:start position:0%
July 1 no I agree yeah anyone
 
00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.149 align:start position:0%
July 1 no I agree yeah anyone
else

00:20:19.149 --> 00:20:19.159 align:start position:0%
else
 
00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
yeah I would agree except you've got to
 
00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
assume that they worked this out with
 
00:20:26.669 --> 00:20:26.679 align:start position:0%
the attorney general and based on the
 
00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
lawsuit maybe they feel like this the
 
00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
date they needed I'd be I'd have
 
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
some anxiety about changing that without
 
00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
Melissa you asked the question right or
 
00:20:41.789 --> 00:20:41.799 align:start position:0%
Jack I mean I would just say that it's a
 
00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
very specific date yeah it is but but
 
00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:48.280 align:start position:0%
can you p is it legal to pass law that
 
00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
happens in the past I don't think so I
 
00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:53.320 align:start position:0%
don't think so either I don't but all
 
00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
right well Melissa ask the question okay
 
00:20:58.029 --> 00:20:58.039 align:start position:0%
and the other question I would ask about
 
00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:00.760 align:start position:0%
this is is the sentence describing this
 
00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
thing minimize storage to accommodate
 
00:21:07.669 --> 00:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
only life jackets paddles Etc I mean
 
00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
this seems way too detailed right I mean
 
00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
why are we you know what we care about
 
00:21:15.789 --> 00:21:15.799 align:start position:0%
is this building size right the height
 
00:21:19.269 --> 00:21:19.279 align:start position:0%
uh the one story Etc right but but
 
00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:22.600 align:start position:0%
what's in the building I mean you
 
00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
know represent c yeah the
 
00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:28.200 align:start position:0%
unfortunately um people could start
 
00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:31.480 align:start position:0%
parking cars in there and you know and
 
00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
there off-road vehicles and stuff like
 
00:21:38.269 --> 00:21:38.279 align:start position:0%
and then um so the intent is to only for
 
00:21:40.669 --> 00:21:40.679 align:start position:0%
boating equipment or anything associated
 
00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
with boating and being or or lake
 
00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
activities like swimming fishing boating
 
00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh so that's the intent so that's why
 
00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:50.320 align:start position:0%
they throw a little bit of detail in
 
00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
there so I wouldn't get too picky on it
 
00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
I see I have another representative
 
00:21:59.870 --> 00:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
Griffin I have another issue with u 6
 
00:22:04.029 --> 00:22:04.039 align:start position:0%
and that's the U raising the fees
 
00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
annually I I don't think it's a good
 
00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:09.880 align:start position:0%
policy for us to turn the raising of the
 
00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
fees over to to
 
00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:16.520 align:start position:0%
bment yes and but I don't see that where
 
00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
am I where are you looking well I'm
 
00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
looking at hb2 no no but what line of
 
00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
page 12 we're doing
 
00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:27.240 align:start position:0%
this well we're on boat houses yeah
 
00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:29.000 align:start position:0%
we're still on boat house yes well but
 
00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:30.440 align:start position:0%
we I agree with you and we'll come back
 
00:22:34.549 --> 00:22:34.559 align:start position:0%
to that okay yes repres one more comment
 
00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:37.000 align:start position:0%
about the dates there could be some
 
00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
people who already have contracts
 
00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
ongoing with contractors for
 
00:22:43.029 --> 00:22:43.039 align:start position:0%
construction of a boat house they would
 
00:22:46.269 --> 00:22:46.279 align:start position:0%
have already paid the $400 whatever so
 
00:22:49.029 --> 00:22:49.039 align:start position:0%
that I think that I I realize what
 
00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
representative eel said that this may
 
00:22:53.149 --> 00:22:53.159 align:start position:0%
have been uh legally required to put the
 
00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:56.440 align:start position:0%
state in but i' I'd also want to have an
 
00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
exception if we could for people who
 
00:23:01.269 --> 00:23:01.279 align:start position:0%
have ongoing contracts signed before
 
00:23:01.279 --> 00:23:02.830 align:start position:0%
have ongoing contracts signed before
February

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:02.840 align:start position:0%
February
 
00:23:06.269 --> 00:23:06.279 align:start position:0%
21st because they may have already
 
00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
expended a lot of money for a project to
 
00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
find out that it's not going to be um
 
00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:15.480 align:start position:0%
legally yeah constructed represent I
 
00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
would say they're in a well I I don't
 
00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:19.710 align:start position:0%
would say they're in a well I I don't
know

00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:19.720 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:22.120 align:start position:0%
but seems like they're pursuing an
 
00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
illegal action because of the because of
 
00:23:27.669 --> 00:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
the um I don't know and just going along
 
00:23:30.029 --> 00:23:30.039 align:start position:0%
with what represent of camell said if
 
00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:31.720 align:start position:0%
you don't limit it in some way people
 
00:23:33.909 --> 00:23:33.919 align:start position:0%
are going to build houses and put in
 
00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
apartments and um I mean that's another
 
00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:40.600 align:start position:0%
thing when those guys are talking to the
 
00:23:42.669 --> 00:23:42.679 align:start position:0%
attorney general they might raise
 
00:23:42.679 --> 00:23:44.310 align:start position:0%
attorney general they might raise
existing

00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
existing
 
00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:46.600 align:start position:0%
contracts yeah I think it's I think we
 
00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:55.720 align:start position:0%
that page
 
00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
12 yes um anyone else like to wa on all
 
00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:04.240 align:start position:0%
right why don't we just ask the question
 
00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:07.320 align:start position:0%
um number one why is why is that
 
00:24:10.029 --> 00:24:10.039 align:start position:0%
particular date in there number two is
 
00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
it actually legal
 
00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:16.799 align:start position:0%
because and and
 
00:24:20.029 --> 00:24:20.039 align:start position:0%
maybe what's in no it's not law yet
 
00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
can't it's they can't go retroactively
 
00:24:24.269 --> 00:24:24.279 align:start position:0%
after someone who's already started to
 
00:24:28.789 --> 00:24:28.799 align:start position:0%
do something so yeah on the other hand
 
00:24:31.549 --> 00:24:31.559 align:start position:0%
so representative rung is
 
00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:35.720 align:start position:0%
somewhat um correct I think because
 
00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:38.870 align:start position:0%
somewhat um correct I think because
um

00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
nobody if you're going to start
 
00:24:43.029 --> 00:24:43.039 align:start position:0%
construction so this is about starting
 
00:24:45.389 --> 00:24:45.399 align:start position:0%
constructed after right there's a whole
 
00:24:47.470 --> 00:24:47.480 align:start position:0%
bunch of things that lead into
 
00:24:50.269 --> 00:24:50.279 align:start position:0%
construction getting the permit and
 
00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:52.360 align:start position:0%
making your plans and and going to the
 
00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:53.720 align:start position:0%
planning board and all these kind of
 
00:24:59.510 --> 00:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:03.029 --> 00:25:03.039 align:start position:0%
so if we made it constructed after July
 
00:25:06.669 --> 00:25:06.679 align:start position:0%
1st right then we're not necessarily
 
00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:07.880 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:25:09.669 --> 00:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
interrupt the the things that are
 
00:25:11.789 --> 00:25:11.799 align:start position:0%
happening now are kind of the planning
 
00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
stage right and so you know there
 
00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
probably won't be any such thing built
 
00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:22.440 align:start position:0%
unless it's already
 
00:25:24.789 --> 00:25:24.799 align:start position:0%
today you know they've started
 
00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
anyways let's ask the question Melissa
 
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
and we'll find out okay all right so
 
00:25:36.789 --> 00:25:36.799 align:start position:0%
that's enough about boat houses um let's
 
00:25:38.029 --> 00:25:38.039 align:start position:0%
go back
 
00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:40.120 align:start position:0%
to where were
 
00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
we page n page
 
00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
10 fees oh the fees penalty the penalty
 
00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:51.320 align:start position:0%
that one's okay I think because because
 
00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
basically we're adding a new thing you
 
00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
can't do so this is saying the penalty
 
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
also applies to this new thing right
 
00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:02.840 align:start position:0%
because there's already a penalty in law
 
00:26:04.029 --> 00:26:04.039 align:start position:0%
in for something else you're not
 
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
supposed to be doing right so yeah that
 
00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
that's just these two things go together
 
00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:16.029 --> 00:26:16.039 align:start position:0%
16 let's do the whole boat house as one
 
00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
big unit I guess okay all right back to
 
00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
page I think we're page nine at the
 
00:26:27.029 --> 00:26:27.039 align:start position:0%
bottom section 11
 
00:26:32.789 --> 00:26:32.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:37.549 --> 00:26:37.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:41.200 align:start position:0%
so right so this
 
00:26:44.909 --> 00:26:44.919 align:start position:0%
is uh so this is a big fee increase but
 
00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
that's one of the things we're going to
 
00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:50.120 align:start position:0%
be doing to um to balance the
 
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
budget and the governor did it ahead of
 
00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:54.320 align:start position:0%
time in this
 
00:26:57.549 --> 00:26:57.559 align:start position:0%
one so yeah I go ahead and represent
 
00:26:57.559 --> 00:26:59.350 align:start position:0%
one so yeah I go ahead and represent
around

00:26:59.350 --> 00:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:27:03.149 --> 00:27:03.159 align:start position:0%
do have an issue with raising fees for
 
00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
individual homeowners that are working
 
00:27:07.269 --> 00:27:07.279 align:start position:0%
on a project for instance if you look at
 
00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:10.360 align:start position:0%
a seasonal dock there's no disruption in
 
00:27:12.389 --> 00:27:12.399 align:start position:0%
the in the the bottom of the Waterway
 
00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:15.200 align:start position:0%
it's just setting something on top of it
 
00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:17.320 align:start position:0%
or could even be a floating seasonal
 
00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:21.080 align:start position:0%
Dock and um sometimes people do that on
 
00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
their own and if we increase the fees by
 
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
50% I'm concerned that 's going to be
 
00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:30.640 align:start position:0%
people that are going to be working off
 
00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
permit and I don't want to have the the
 
00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
the the increase in the fees discourage
 
00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:38.120 align:start position:0%
people from going through that
 
00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:40.360 align:start position:0%
permitting process and just doing
 
00:27:43.669 --> 00:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
something on their own I see uh do we
 
00:27:45.909 --> 00:27:45.919 align:start position:0%
know when these fees were set in this
 
00:27:45.919 --> 00:27:47.269 align:start position:0%
know when these fees were set in this
particular

00:27:47.269 --> 00:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
particular
 
00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
section I don't have the answer to that
 
00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:53.240 align:start position:0%
I do know when we spoke about this last
 
00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:55.480 align:start position:0%
time um representative wer said he's
 
00:27:57.029 --> 00:27:57.039 align:start position:0%
kicking this section to Ways and Means
 
00:27:59.310 --> 00:27:59.320 align:start position:0%
to get their input on it
 
00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:01.640 align:start position:0%
okay okay and I certainly haven't heard
 
00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:04.200 align:start position:0%
back from them he said he just said that
 
00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:05.880 align:start position:0%
on Friday he had forgotten to send this
 
00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
section over to them oh I see I mean I
 
00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:10.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have a problem with the fee
 
00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
increase if it applies to um contractors
 
00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:17.320 align:start position:0%
or developers because those are
 
00:28:19.789 --> 00:28:19.799 align:start position:0%
typically going to be larger projects
 
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
that um an individual homeowner wouldn't
 
00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:23.720 align:start position:0%
be doing on their
 
00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
own well and they're going to probably
 
00:28:28.909 --> 00:28:28.919 align:start position:0%
make sure that they comply with all the
 
00:28:32.269 --> 00:28:32.279 align:start position:0%
permitting requirements okay so so
 
00:28:34.549 --> 00:28:34.559 align:start position:0%
there's two parts to the fee right one
 
00:28:36.909 --> 00:28:36.919 align:start position:0%
is there's a flat rate but then there's
 
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
an additional so much per square foot
 
00:28:43.149 --> 00:28:43.159 align:start position:0%
right um and so I guess what you're
 
00:28:46.029 --> 00:28:46.039 align:start position:0%
saying is you want to have smaller
 
00:28:48.389 --> 00:28:48.399 align:start position:0%
projects have a lower flat
 
00:28:52.909 --> 00:28:52.919 align:start position:0%
rate correct or something like that um
 
00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
all right well what we'll look into the
 
00:28:58.430 --> 00:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
history of this and and um if you want
 
00:29:01.149 --> 00:29:01.159 align:start position:0%
to prepare a possible Amendment we can
 
00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
consider it okay um this is for fixed
 
00:29:07.149 --> 00:29:07.159 align:start position:0%
docks only no
 
00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
no no for permanent dos it's not for
 
00:29:13.029 --> 00:29:13.039 align:start position:0%
like floating ones or temporary ones
 
00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:19.640 align:start position:0%
or I don't know it's dredge Phil and do
 
00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
well if you look at on page uh excuse me
 
00:29:26.029 --> 00:29:26.039 align:start position:0%
Mr chair if you look at page 10 line two
 
00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
it does include seasonal docks or area
 
00:29:32.509 --> 00:29:32.519 align:start position:0%
M that could just be a floating do yeah
 
00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:35.000 align:start position:0%
if but if you read the
 
00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:38.200 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
00:29:40.029 --> 00:29:40.039 align:start position:0%
application based on the amount of
 
00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
dredge fill or dock
 
00:29:44.669 --> 00:29:44.679 align:start position:0%
surface so you could have a dock surface
 
00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:47.960 align:start position:0%
with no need to dredge and fill in fact
 
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:50.480 align:start position:0%
all I would argue that all seasonal
 
00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
docks don't require dredge
 
00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
enill they either float on the water or
 
00:29:58.950 --> 00:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
they may just have some pilings that
 
00:30:01.669 --> 00:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
that sit on top of the
 
00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
sediment well go ahead I mean we can
 
00:30:08.909 --> 00:30:08.919 align:start position:0%
talk to them again I guess I I uh I just
 
00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:12.200 align:start position:0%
feel like they're trying to uh increase
 
00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
fees to try to compensate for the work
 
00:30:16.909 --> 00:30:16.919 align:start position:0%
that's being done in the department and
 
00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:19.000 align:start position:0%
this is all part of that broader
 
00:30:20.789 --> 00:30:20.799 align:start position:0%
discussion I mean I don't I don't know
 
00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
if other people have heard from Lakes
 
00:30:26.029 --> 00:30:26.039 align:start position:0%
associations or anything about this I I
 
00:30:29.149 --> 00:30:29.159 align:start position:0%
have not and I you know maybe we maybe
 
00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
they'll talk about it at the public
 
00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
hearing but um I don't think they did
 
00:30:38.669 --> 00:30:38.679 align:start position:0%
this lightly anyway yeah it may it may
 
00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
also be excuse me Mr chair but yes go
 
00:30:44.509 --> 00:30:44.519 align:start position:0%
ahead you know maybe if um projects that
 
00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:46.200 align:start position:0%
are approved through a permit by
 
00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
notification could be Exempted because
 
00:30:50.509 --> 00:30:50.519 align:start position:0%
usually those are just replacement
 
00:30:50.519 --> 00:30:52.110 align:start position:0%
usually those are just replacement
projects

00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:52.120 align:start position:0%
projects
 
00:30:55.669 --> 00:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
or you know they're more defined as not
 
00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
having a imp an enir enal impact so I
 
00:31:02.629 --> 00:31:02.639 align:start position:0%
think representative eil has a good
 
00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:05.960 align:start position:0%
point here because these fees however
 
00:31:08.669 --> 00:31:08.679 align:start position:0%
they're charged go into paying for the
 
00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:11.000 align:start position:0%
expenses of the people doing the work
 
00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:14.360 align:start position:0%
right and so those expenses have been ra
 
00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
you know going up over time right so um
 
00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
let's find out when these when the $400
 
00:31:24.269 --> 00:31:24.279 align:start position:0%
was set and then we'll we'll go from
 
00:31:24.279 --> 00:31:26.350 align:start position:0%
was set and then we'll we'll go from
there

00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:26.360 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:31:31.269 --> 00:31:31.279 align:start position:0%
okay I'll I'll I'll try to look that up
 
00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
okay just one more thing not to you know
 
00:31:37.149 --> 00:31:37.159 align:start position:0%
but when I did bring this up with Dees
 
00:31:37.159 --> 00:31:38.230 align:start position:0%
but when I did bring this up with Dees
on

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
Friday um my recollection is is that
 
00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:43.880 align:start position:0%
they did recognize that there are
 
00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:45.880 align:start position:0%
different tiers to projects like there
 
00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:49.320 align:start position:0%
could be smaller you know more homeowner
 
00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:53.080 align:start position:0%
type Improvement or replacement projects
 
00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
compared to the larger projects where
 
00:31:56.509 --> 00:31:56.519 align:start position:0%
somebody might be putting in a
 
00:31:59.789 --> 00:31:59.799 align:start position:0%
commercial dock or commercial structure
 
00:32:02.629 --> 00:32:02.639 align:start position:0%
so um I I can pursue it with them Mr
 
00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:05.200 align:start position:0%
chair but I'm where I'm thinking now is
 
00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:08.360 align:start position:0%
having a two tiered fee system because I
 
00:32:10.549 --> 00:32:10.559 align:start position:0%
think they did say just the I think it
 
00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
was 30% of their permits are those
 
00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:16.120 align:start position:0%
smaller projects homeowner driven
 
00:32:19.629 --> 00:32:19.639 align:start position:0%
projects right but but presumably
 
00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:22.840 align:start position:0%
somebody comes out and inspects it and
 
00:32:24.269 --> 00:32:24.279 align:start position:0%
whatever I mean there's there's certain
 
00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:27.240 align:start position:0%
amount of expense that is unrelated to
 
00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
the size of project um not for permit by
 
00:32:31.509 --> 00:32:31.519 align:start position:0%
notification though oh okay I'm speaking
 
00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:34.840 align:start position:0%
from experience here okay you have a DOT
 
00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:37.480 align:start position:0%
yes I I can give you my Saab story
 
00:32:40.669 --> 00:32:40.679 align:start position:0%
sometime yeah all right we'll we'll wait
 
00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
and if you want to propose a change
 
00:32:45.909 --> 00:32:45.919 align:start position:0%
there we'll okay now the next one is the
 
00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
one that representative Griffin objects
 
00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
to and I do too um so this is something
 
00:32:53.509 --> 00:32:53.519 align:start position:0%
I was originally okay with but I've been
 
00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:55.960 align:start position:0%
thinking about and that is these
 
00:32:58.269 --> 00:32:58.279 align:start position:0%
automatic increases
 
00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
right so
 
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
um I tend to think um that it's
 
00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
it's you know we have to change fees to
 
00:33:13.789 --> 00:33:13.799 align:start position:0%
meet our budget today but just putting
 
00:33:18.029 --> 00:33:18.039 align:start position:0%
in program spending over time I don't
 
00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
like that idea I think the legislature
 
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
should look at things as they go um and
 
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
um so this is
 
00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:30.440 align:start position:0%
there's no particular urgency I guess is
 
00:33:33.909 --> 00:33:33.919 align:start position:0%
my point in in putting this in now I
 
00:33:37.029 --> 00:33:37.039 align:start position:0%
mean it's it's
 
00:33:39.549 --> 00:33:39.559 align:start position:0%
um we'll make this B we'll make this
 
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
bium work as far as these fees go but to
 
00:33:46.629 --> 00:33:46.639 align:start position:0%
to sort of make it automatic in the
 
00:33:48.509 --> 00:33:48.519 align:start position:0%
future I'm not that comfortable with
 
00:33:51.389 --> 00:33:51.399 align:start position:0%
this represent does it I mean this
 
00:33:53.669 --> 00:33:53.679 align:start position:0%
actually says right in there that the
 
00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee would be required to
 
00:33:58.509 --> 00:33:58.519 align:start position:0%
repo approve or deny
 
00:34:02.789 --> 00:34:02.799 align:start position:0%
the increase I mean I think what and and
 
00:34:05.149 --> 00:34:05.159 align:start position:0%
as you observed this is all throughout
 
00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
hb2 and I think the governor and the
 
00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
Commissioners felt like it would make
 
00:34:14.669 --> 00:34:14.679 align:start position:0%
the whole fee situation less Herky jerky
 
00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:16.760 align:start position:0%
if they put something like this in and
 
00:34:19.950 --> 00:34:19.960 align:start position:0%
then had the fiscal committee review
 
00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:24.280 align:start position:0%
it yeah I I guess I would like like I
 
00:34:26.909 --> 00:34:26.919 align:start position:0%
said somebody who wants to help them out
 
00:34:30.069 --> 00:34:30.079 align:start position:0%
could put this in as a bill right and
 
00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
and it it's not going to affect this
 
00:34:34.669 --> 00:34:34.679 align:start position:0%
bium in our budget and the whole
 
00:34:37.109 --> 00:34:37.119 align:start position:0%
legislature could consider if they want
 
00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:39.320 align:start position:0%
to do this kind of thing with fees or
 
00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:41.800 align:start position:0%
not right I mean I I I guess I just
 
00:34:47.669 --> 00:34:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
now I'm I'm assuming represent of
 
00:34:52.109 --> 00:34:52.119 align:start position:0%
Griffin would
 
00:34:56.629 --> 00:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
agree yeah representative run I mean I I
 
00:34:58.109 --> 00:34:58.119 align:start position:0%
understand where you're coming from and
 
00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:01.400 align:start position:0%
and in a way I agree with you but when I
 
00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
look at some of the fees that are in
 
00:35:05.589 --> 00:35:05.599 align:start position:0%
statute it can take decades for them to
 
00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:07.400 align:start position:0%
be adjusted it's not as though someone
 
00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
just going to oh this V is 20 years old
 
00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:13.160 align:start position:0%
let me put in a bill to increase it so I
 
00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
kind of like the fact that they have an
 
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
annual review um I actually think it
 
00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
might be better to make it by anual to
 
00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:21.880 align:start position:0%
be timed with the
 
00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
budget um but I I don't think it's a bad
 
00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
idea to have it in statute that fees do
 
00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
have have a reoccurring review every two
 
00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
years to be adjusted if necessary right
 
00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:37.480 align:start position:0%
but but see my point is this is starting
 
00:35:40.990 --> 00:35:41.000 align:start position:0%
July 1st 2027 right so you're perfectly
 
00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:43.480 align:start position:0%
welcome to put in a bill that bill could
 
00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
pass it could start July 1st
 
00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
2027 right oh for all fees you're saying
 
00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
for all fees this fee some other fees
 
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to do right you know
 
00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
and then and then it'll go to whatever
 
00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
the right committee is right like Edna
 
00:36:03.109 --> 00:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
or resources or whatever and and it'll
 
00:36:05.069 --> 00:36:05.079 align:start position:0%
be considered right just like you know
 
00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
and people will talk about it and all
 
00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
that stuff but to sort of hide it like
 
00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:11.480 align:start position:0%
this in house not hide it but I mean put
 
00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:14.240 align:start position:0%
it as you know one giant part of House
 
00:36:17.069 --> 00:36:17.079 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 it's sort of unnecessary in my
 
00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:19.000 align:start position:0%
opinion anyways representative camell
 
00:36:20.589 --> 00:36:20.599 align:start position:0%
and then representative Griffin yeah
 
00:36:23.309 --> 00:36:23.319 align:start position:0%
plus it says shall be increased doesn't
 
00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
have any allowance for decreasing should
 
00:36:28.309 --> 00:36:28.319 align:start position:0%
things happen I don't like the idea of
 
00:36:31.109 --> 00:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
an automatic increase it's better that
 
00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:33.480 align:start position:0%
we we we the legislature review these
 
00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
things all the time and sometimes we
 
00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
don't increase for 20 years sometimes
 
00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
we'll have to increase every every year
 
00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:43.000 align:start position:0%
but I think it should be reviewed by the
 
00:36:45.309 --> 00:36:45.319 align:start position:0%
legislature and not be
 
00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
automatic M representative
 
00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
Griffin yeah in the interest of
 
00:36:54.829 --> 00:36:54.839 align:start position:0%
transparency I would like to state that
 
00:36:58.069 --> 00:36:58.079 align:start position:0%
I do not have a boat house
 
00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
I do not have a lake house I have a
 
00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:04.040 align:start position:0%
house in Mon and up in the hill there's
 
00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:06.280 align:start position:0%
no water anywhere near me so I don't
 
00:37:09.309 --> 00:37:09.319 align:start position:0%
claim to be an expert but I it would be
 
00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
interesting for the sake of transparency
 
00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
to know how many of the members here do
 
00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:18.040 align:start position:0%
have lakefront
 
00:37:20.829 --> 00:37:20.839 align:start position:0%
property if they want to volunteer it
 
00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
okay I do not so I'm I'm up on a hill as
 
00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:28.200 align:start position:0%
well I have a um a former river behind
 
00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:29.030 align:start position:0%
well I have a um a former river behind
my

00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
house but there's no uh there's no dock
 
00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
there's there's very little water in it
 
00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:40.280 align:start position:0%
yeah represent um we have a a dock on um
 
00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
Lake sunap that's part of a big uh dock
 
00:37:49.150 --> 00:37:49.160 align:start position:0%
owning operation but I mean I'm sort of
 
00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:52.440 align:start position:0%
uh arguing in against my interest in
 
00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
this so it's not really
 
00:37:59.390 --> 00:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
yeah okay I we have a right away tolu
 
00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:02.680 align:start position:0%
Pond and we have a uh seasonal dock that
 
00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
we that we have out on the pond so
 
00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:12.680 align:start position:0%
okay um I I live a half mile from the
 
00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:15.160 align:start position:0%
ocean there you
 
00:38:18.349 --> 00:38:18.359 align:start position:0%
go okay depending on the storms I have
 
00:38:20.349 --> 00:38:20.359 align:start position:0%
some you know o I have a little bit of
 
00:38:21.829 --> 00:38:21.839 align:start position:0%
ocean front in my
 
00:38:25.349 --> 00:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
backyard and I have a seasonal Cottage I
 
00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
call it a cottage my husband calls it a
 
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:27.990 align:start position:0%
call it a cottage my husband calls it a
camp

00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
camp
 
00:38:30.589 --> 00:38:30.599 align:start position:0%
but it's uh some in some rooms you can
 
00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
actually see the outside from it so it's
 
00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:35.560 align:start position:0%
but we do have waterfront on Lake
 
00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:38.200 align:start position:0%
hanasaka where's that Leake um it's in
 
00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
molteno it actually feeds
 
00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:45.440 align:start position:0%
into Blackie Cove in um in Center Harbor
 
00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
got yeah okay for whatever that's worth
 
00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
yeah any other comments represent
 
00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
Griff no you're okay all right
 
00:38:54.510 --> 00:38:54.520 align:start position:0%
representative EV I'm trying there's
 
00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
there's so many things to remember in
 
00:38:58.550 --> 00:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
this process but I swear when Dees was
 
00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
in here before on Friday we talked about
 
00:39:04.109 --> 00:39:04.119 align:start position:0%
a banial review of fees and we took the
 
00:39:04.119 --> 00:39:05.390 align:start position:0%
a banial review of fees and we took the
word

00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
word
 
00:39:09.349 --> 00:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
increases out it said that it was to
 
00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
reflect the CPI and it was a biannual
 
00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
review and I think representative Lehman
 
00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to add in something there about
 
00:39:19.829 --> 00:39:19.839 align:start position:0%
making sure there was fiscal committee
 
00:39:19.839 --> 00:39:21.710 align:start position:0%
making sure there was fiscal committee
review

00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:21.720 align:start position:0%
review
 
00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
didn't remember go ahead yeah that was
 
00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
what we talked about yeah and I think
 
00:39:28.069 --> 00:39:28.079 align:start position:0%
Melissa was going to talk to to the
 
00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
chair about the cost of living
 
00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:34.720 align:start position:0%
adjustment being like Regional not us
 
00:39:37.069 --> 00:39:37.079 align:start position:0%
but more I think about it I'm beginning
 
00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
to agree with representative cells on
 
00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:42.440 align:start position:0%
this there's no reason A legislature
 
00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
couldn't just review the fees every year
 
00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
um versus putting it in because the
 
00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
chair is correct this will get buried
 
00:39:52.589 --> 00:39:52.599 align:start position:0%
and people will forget all about it but
 
00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
we're increasing the Fe well we're
 
00:39:57.550 --> 00:39:57.560 align:start position:0%
increasing the fees substantially if we
 
00:39:59.710 --> 00:39:59.720 align:start position:0%
agree with that this time and that's the
 
00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:01.400 align:start position:0%
first step I don't think these fees have
 
00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
been increased since if my memory stirs
 
00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
me right like 2005 perhaps we
 
00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:09.720 align:start position:0%
just Jack was just able to find it and
 
00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
in 2019 is when these fees were
 
00:40:14.069 --> 00:40:14.079 align:start position:0%
increased okay so that's not that long
 
00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
right yeah so just for information
 
00:40:19.349 --> 00:40:19.359 align:start position:0%
inflation since 2019 has been about
 
00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
25% so
 
00:40:24.589 --> 00:40:24.599 align:start position:0%
um so this is more we're doubling some
 
00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
of the feed yes right well we're we're
 
00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:29.000 align:start position:0%
50% percenting them I think is what
 
00:40:31.309 --> 00:40:31.319 align:start position:0%
we're doing some of them are doubling
 
00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
represented months um I I don't I think
 
00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
if we included this provision and maybe
 
00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
we changed it to BU anually I don't
 
00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
think it gets lost in the shuffle
 
00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
particularly if we have the requirement
 
00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
that it has to be reviewed by fiscal
 
00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
committee I mean what would happen every
 
00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:50.720 align:start position:0%
two years is every every agency that has
 
00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:52.640 align:start position:0%
a fee would have to update their fees
 
00:40:54.069 --> 00:40:54.079 align:start position:0%
they'd present it to the fiscal
 
00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:55.640 align:start position:0%
committee and the fiscal committee could
 
00:40:58.390 --> 00:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
then make a decision mean like the idea
 
00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:01.480 align:start position:0%
of I mean I I I like the idea of there
 
00:41:03.309 --> 00:41:03.319 align:start position:0%
being a regular
 
00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
review um that happens automatically as
 
00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
opposed to hoping that some legislature
 
00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
legislature thinks about oh let me
 
00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
introduce a bill to address fees because
 
00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
um otherwise we're going to you know
 
00:41:19.109 --> 00:41:19.119 align:start position:0%
continually get into the jam that we're
 
00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:21.640 align:start position:0%
in now where fees haven't been increased
 
00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:25.160 align:start position:0%
for many years sure but but my point
 
00:41:28.309 --> 00:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
is why should we make this decision
 
00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
about automatic stuff among just us
 
00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:35.400 align:start position:0%
rather than let the whole legislative
 
00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:39.560 align:start position:0%
process work on that aspect of it right
 
00:41:43.349 --> 00:41:43.359 align:start position:0%
so representative run um if you remember
 
00:41:45.550 --> 00:41:45.560 align:start position:0%
Friday did recommend changing the word
 
00:41:46.829 --> 00:41:46.839 align:start position:0%
increase to
 
00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:51.560 align:start position:0%
change and adjustment so um but we would
 
00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:53.560 align:start position:0%
not be setting president at all by
 
00:41:55.349 --> 00:41:55.359 align:start position:0%
putting something in hb2 that should
 
00:41:57.270 --> 00:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
have been a separate bill no of of
 
00:41:58.910 --> 00:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
course not no and I'm sure we're going
 
00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
to do it this time you know there's no
 
00:42:03.309 --> 00:42:03.319 align:start position:0%
question about that but on this
 
00:42:06.109 --> 00:42:06.119 align:start position:0%
particular item I'm I'm slightly
 
00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:08.440 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable representative Kell yeah
 
00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um no we we're we're
 
00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
not shouldn't be in the business of
 
00:42:14.589 --> 00:42:14.599 align:start position:0%
raising fees automatically the reason
 
00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
we're doing it this by this bium is
 
00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:20.200 align:start position:0%
because we are in a serious deficit um
 
00:42:22.990 --> 00:42:23.000 align:start position:0%
if we let this happen automatically fees
 
00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
could be raised automatically every year
 
00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
and it could be unnecessary we could
 
00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
have surpluses in the coming years
 
00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:31.640 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll have surpluses so I
 
00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:33.400 align:start position:0%
believe that this is something that
 
00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:34.760 align:start position:0%
that's why we're here we're the finance
 
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
committee that's why we review these
 
00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
things and if necessary we increase fees
 
00:42:41.349 --> 00:42:41.359 align:start position:0%
but shouldn't be
 
00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
automatic all right
 
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
so um should we should we take a vote on
 
00:42:50.109 --> 00:42:50.119 align:start position:0%
removing section 12 you want to do it
 
00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
that way I make a motion that we remove
 
00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
section to section okay and I'll I'll
 
00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:00.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:04.990 --> 00:43:05.000 align:start position:0%
favor okay we got four opposed three
 
00:43:11.109 --> 00:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
okay so we can remove section 12 okay um
 
00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:12.640 align:start position:0%
at least I can cross it
 
00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:25.710 align:start position:0%
 
13

00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:25.720 align:start position:0%
13
 
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
yeah Commission gr
 
00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
extension this is trying to speed things
 
00:43:34.109 --> 00:43:34.119 align:start position:0%
up I think is that what it is yeah and
 
00:43:37.309 --> 00:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
just and and just removing the specific
 
00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh Rivers Council provision okay and um
 
00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:43.960 align:start position:0%
so we're okay with
 
00:43:49.309 --> 00:43:49.319 align:start position:0%
13 okay all right um so representative
 
00:43:53.790 --> 00:43:53.800 align:start position:0%
eil moves and represent cell seconds we
 
00:43:57.470 --> 00:43:57.480 align:start position:0%
move section we keep section 13
 
00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:09.349 --> 00:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
so um where are we here section 13
 
00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
gotcha okay now section
 
00:44:17.470 --> 00:44:17.480 align:start position:0%
14 so this is also an automatic increase
 
00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
thing right so I'd want to take that
 
00:44:22.109 --> 00:44:22.119 align:start position:0%
part out so we're going to need an
 
00:44:28.109 --> 00:44:28.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:30.309 --> 00:44:30.319 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire yes give some a
 
00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
little bit Melissa yeah backg so um the
 
00:44:35.829 --> 00:44:35.839 align:start position:0%
requested Amendment for the section 14
 
00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
is sen is a Senate Bill 110 as amended
 
00:44:41.710 --> 00:44:41.720 align:start position:0%
by the Senate is what they requested so
 
00:44:43.309 --> 00:44:43.319 align:start position:0%
their language I verified their
 
00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
languages exactly um as what's been
 
00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:48.760 align:start position:0%
amended by the senate for S SP 110
 
00:44:51.069 --> 00:44:51.079 align:start position:0%
that's currently on its way to finance
 
00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
maybe heard tomorrow but just for uh
 
00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
some background that is what their
 
00:44:59.030 --> 00:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
amendment is requesting in so there so
 
00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
with the automatic increase is in the
 
00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
automatic increase is not in the Senate
 
00:45:06.309 --> 00:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
version oh I see but the other stuff is
 
00:45:08.829 --> 00:45:08.839 align:start position:0%
the 150,000 Square ft and all this kind
 
00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
of stuff okay correct y
 
00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
so so maybe we'll end up replacing this
 
00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
with Senate Bill 110 is that the that
 
00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
was their that was de's um ask gotcha
 
00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
okay well that's good because then we
 
00:45:26.069 --> 00:45:26.079 align:start position:0%
don't have to think about it all right
 
00:45:26.079 --> 00:45:27.670 align:start position:0%
don't have to think about it all right
um

00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:30.829 --> 00:45:30.839 align:start position:0%
y 110 as amended but it's here or it's
 
00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
not quite it's in Senate it's referred
 
00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:36.200 align:start position:0%
to Senate Finance oh I see it's a Senate
 
00:45:38.910 --> 00:45:38.920 align:start position:0%
Bill gotcha so maybe we should take this
 
00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
out all together or but but then there's
 
00:45:44.990 --> 00:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
money changes yeah go ahead represent if
 
00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
if in fact this is identical to sb10
 
00:45:52.069 --> 00:45:52.079 align:start position:0%
except for the automatic language their
 
00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
requested amendment is identical okay
 
00:45:56.549 --> 00:45:56.559 align:start position:0%
the requested Amendment the red line the
 
00:45:58.910 --> 00:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
red line do their requested Amendment
 
00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:02.240 align:start position:0%
and take out the automatic part I that's
 
00:46:05.109 --> 00:46:05.119 align:start position:0%
what you were saying in the red line yes
 
00:46:07.470 --> 00:46:07.480 align:start position:0%
yes so we're talking about in the
 
00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
redline document section
 
00:46:18.030 --> 00:46:18.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:19.710 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:19.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:22.670 align:start position:0%
okay
right

00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:46:26.030 --> 00:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
okay no but see the redline version does
 
00:46:28.309 --> 00:46:28.319 align:start position:0%
have the automatic thing yeah that's
 
00:46:30.309 --> 00:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying so we take that out and
 
00:46:33.349 --> 00:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
then it would be the same I think as
 
00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
amended is right that's correct okay all
 
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
right so should we be okay with
 
00:46:46.829 --> 00:46:46.839 align:start position:0%
that yes yes okay all right so why don't
 
00:46:49.549 --> 00:46:49.559 align:start position:0%
uh who wants to move this you
 
00:46:50.990 --> 00:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin wants to speak I
 
00:46:53.069 --> 00:46:53.079 align:start position:0%
have a question maybe maybe I missed it
 
00:46:59.109 --> 00:46:59.119 align:start position:0%
last time we met um or Dees was here are
 
00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
all these changes been run through the
 
00:47:06.670 --> 00:47:06.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:09.960 align:start position:0%
budget oh if you're asking about the red
 
00:47:12.270 --> 00:47:12.280 align:start position:0%
line versus House Bill two clearly House
 
00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
Bill two has yeah clearly House Bill two
 
00:47:18.589 --> 00:47:18.599 align:start position:0%
has but they're making major changes to
 
00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
House Bill two here and it's a
 
00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
Governor's bill it would seemed to me
 
00:47:27.390 --> 00:47:27.400 align:start position:0%
that it would start with her
 
00:47:29.670 --> 00:47:29.680 align:start position:0%
and then come to us
 
00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
but and and I failed to ask that
 
00:47:42.430 --> 00:47:42.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:45.870 --> 00:47:45.880 align:start position:0%
mind yeah I mean I guess I tend to think
 
00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:49.400 align:start position:0%
that this is a level of detail that
 
00:47:52.589 --> 00:47:52.599 align:start position:0%
maybe the governor herself would not uh
 
00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
no but I mean it's tracking here and
 
00:47:58.069 --> 00:47:58.079 align:start position:0%
it's in her hb2 I mean the the Chang are
 
00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
pretty yeah I understand but it looks
 
00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit this stuff looks
 
00:48:05.790 --> 00:48:05.800 align:start position:0%
slightly new right so the 50,000 square
 
00:48:12.069 --> 00:48:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:17.109 --> 00:48:17.119 align:start position:0%
new we're okay with it okay and and if
 
00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
and when we get cabill 110 we can
 
00:48:23.870 --> 00:48:23.880 align:start position:0%
reconsider it if necessary okay or they
 
00:48:28.309 --> 00:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
will or something like that so um
 
00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:31.000 align:start position:0%
you okay with this yeah
 
00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:33.720 align:start position:0%
okay all right so when don't we have
 
00:48:36.589 --> 00:48:36.599 align:start position:0%
representative cells will move that we
 
00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:40.280 align:start position:0%
accept the redline version of section 14
 
00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
to replace the existing section 14 with
 
00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
the exception of removing the paragraph
 
00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
that the sentence that starts starting
 
00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
July 1st
 
00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
2027 so moved okay good and
 
00:48:59.069 --> 00:48:59.079 align:start position:0%
representative eil that any qu more
 
00:49:00.750 --> 00:49:00.760 align:start position:0%
questions what we're voting on all those
 
00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:02.109 align:start position:0%
questions what we're voting on all those
in

00:49:02.109 --> 00:49:02.119 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
favor okay
 
00:49:09.150 --> 00:49:09.160 align:start position:0%
opposed okay one opposed yes okay good
 
00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:13.880 align:start position:0%
all right so we're now done with
 
00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:15.470 align:start position:0%
all right so we're now done with
14

00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
14
 
00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:16.990 align:start position:0%
14
okay

00:49:16.990 --> 00:49:17.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:49:20.910 --> 00:49:20.920 align:start position:0%
good um and now we're back to
 
00:49:24.030 --> 00:49:24.040 align:start position:0%
boathouses so or we we decided to we
 
00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
decided to wait on both houses okay
 
00:49:28.309 --> 00:49:28.319 align:start position:0%
because that is the sort of thing that
 
00:49:30.789 --> 00:49:30.799 align:start position:0%
people come to public hearings to talk
 
00:49:33.630 --> 00:49:33.640 align:start position:0%
about I mean In fairness and we might I
 
00:49:37.950 --> 00:49:37.960 align:start position:0%
mean we might have yeah okay um all
 
00:49:41.470 --> 00:49:41.480 align:start position:0%
right so that's 15 and 16 now we're down
 
00:49:46.030 --> 00:49:46.040 align:start position:0%
to um 19 and 20 so there's a bill about
 
00:49:48.750 --> 00:49:48.760 align:start position:0%
this right so I can I just summarize go
 
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
ahead so I'm just going to say that um
 
00:49:54.190 --> 00:49:54.200 align:start position:0%
there is a lot of interest in this
 
00:49:57.510 --> 00:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
section um and there's a bill that has
 
00:49:59.510 --> 00:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
passed HB
 
00:50:03.710 --> 00:50:03.720 align:start position:0%
215 which I gave to you at the last um
 
00:50:08.910 --> 00:50:08.920 align:start position:0%
on Friday there's a bill coming HB 171
 
00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
that has moratorium language in it and
 
00:50:14.030 --> 00:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
then there's another bill I believe
 
00:50:17.069 --> 00:50:17.079 align:start position:0%
hb77 that's coming that they're working
 
00:50:21.470 --> 00:50:21.480 align:start position:0%
on the amendment right now um and then
 
00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
there's going to be the public hearing I
 
00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:26.240 align:start position:0%
mean there's a lot of moving pieces to
 
00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:27.390 align:start position:0%
mean there's a lot of moving pieces to
this

00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:27.400 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
so I think we can see what happens on
 
00:50:33.670 --> 00:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
Thursday I don't think we've really had
 
00:50:37.150 --> 00:50:37.160 align:start position:0%
a chance to talk at any length to the
 
00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:40.280 align:start position:0%
ENA Folks at all because nobody was able
 
00:50:45.870 --> 00:50:45.880 align:start position:0%
to come here um on Friday so I think um
 
00:50:47.549 --> 00:50:47.559 align:start position:0%
I mean I really think we have to wait
 
00:50:50.030 --> 00:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
and Mr chair you may recall I won't be
 
00:50:53.190 --> 00:50:53.200 align:start position:0%
here on Friday so it would I would
 
00:50:56.829 --> 00:50:56.839 align:start position:0%
greatly appreciate uh delaying I I on
 
00:51:01.589 --> 00:51:01.599 align:start position:0%
Monday well or Tuesday I mean the the
 
00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
thing is this has a lot of moving pieces
 
00:51:06.910 --> 00:51:06.920 align:start position:0%
and and you know that this is a real Hot
 
00:51:09.390 --> 00:51:09.400 align:start position:0%
Topic yes and and at what point will we
 
00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:13.880 align:start position:0%
have all possible bills from the house
 
00:51:17.309 --> 00:51:17.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
don't uh I'm notel by the 20th yeah I
 
00:51:21.870 --> 00:51:21.880 align:start position:0%
was just going to say think we get them
 
00:51:24.510 --> 00:51:24.520 align:start position:0%
we'll have them for we'll have our set
 
00:51:25.789 --> 00:51:25.799 align:start position:0%
this week and then the next week we'll
 
00:51:27.390 --> 00:51:27.400 align:start position:0%
get the last set last
 
00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:29.390 align:start position:0%
get the last set last
right

00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:29.400 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:51:33.109 --> 00:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
right okay but we'll Mr chair I mean
 
00:51:36.430 --> 00:51:36.440 align:start position:0%
we'll know what the amendment is by the
 
00:51:40.230 --> 00:51:40.240 align:start position:0%
calendar coming Thursday and and the the
 
00:51:42.430 --> 00:51:42.440 align:start position:0%
one on uh the
 
00:51:45.549 --> 00:51:45.559 align:start position:0%
moratorium I know is three three years
 
00:51:47.630 --> 00:51:47.640 align:start position:0%
because they already decided it so I
 
00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
know what that is I just don't know in
 
00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
detail about
 
00:51:55.150 --> 00:51:55.160 align:start position:0%
707 I just don't know gotcha but we'll
 
00:51:58.190 --> 00:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
have it okay
 
00:52:01.950 --> 00:52:01.960 align:start position:0%
um all right
 
00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
so the other question that I have is to
 
00:52:10.589 --> 00:52:10.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:13.069 --> 00:52:13.079 align:start position:0%
budget I mean this looks like a lot of
 
00:52:16.829 --> 00:52:16.839 align:start position:0%
changes to a committee and other I guess
 
00:52:18.309 --> 00:52:18.319 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit of fee stuff in
 
00:52:20.109 --> 00:52:20.119 align:start position:0%
here yeah there's fee stuff in here it
 
00:52:22.390 --> 00:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
does affect the budget because part of
 
00:52:26.190 --> 00:52:26.200 align:start position:0%
this uh landfill review is now going to
 
00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
be transferred from Dees over to this
 
00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
SEC and the SEC costs will be based on
 
00:52:38.069 --> 00:52:38.079 align:start position:0%
fees so um I it will affect the budget
 
00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:41.160 align:start position:0%
and I know it's something that um the
 
00:52:43.589 --> 00:52:43.599 align:start position:0%
governor I've been told feels pretty
 
00:52:45.870 --> 00:52:45.880 align:start position:0%
strongly about so to the extent it's
 
00:52:48.990 --> 00:52:49.000 align:start position:0%
reflecting her desires
 
00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
um and and the houses I think okay we'll
 
00:52:55.870 --> 00:52:55.880 align:start position:0%
find out I guess yeah I mean I I really
 
00:52:57.910 --> 00:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
think this is a good thing to move
 
00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
forward with considering everything
 
00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
that's going on there does there is some
 
00:53:04.150 --> 00:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
urgency to this well all right and to
 
00:53:05.829 --> 00:53:05.839 align:start position:0%
the extent we move forward we do it with
 
00:53:08.069 --> 00:53:08.079 align:start position:0%
the house version and not with the
 
00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
governor's version right well the thing
 
00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
is that the that's what we're going to
 
00:53:15.069 --> 00:53:15.079 align:start position:0%
have to talk about because the house
 
00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
version does not establish an SEC but
 
00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure they even really considered
 
00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
it that's why it's really but so the but
 
00:53:28.950 --> 00:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
the all en compassing approach is an
 
00:53:32.349 --> 00:53:32.359 align:start position:0%
approach that is already adopted by the
 
00:53:35.829 --> 00:53:35.839 align:start position:0%
house so my idea was to look at the
 
00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:38.240 align:start position:0%
house version of the bill to look at
 
00:53:40.789 --> 00:53:40.799 align:start position:0%
their comprehensive approach and just
 
00:53:44.910 --> 00:53:44.920 align:start position:0%
try to see how make it financially and I
 
00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:47.640 align:start position:0%
actually was planning on talking to the
 
00:53:49.750 --> 00:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner about it at some
 
00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:52.720 align:start position:0%
point all right so why don't we task you
 
00:53:54.589 --> 00:53:54.599 align:start position:0%
with coming up with a house bill two
 
00:53:57.230 --> 00:53:57.240 align:start position:0%
Amendment okay in the this area all
 
00:53:58.829 --> 00:53:58.839 align:start position:0%
right representative eel I just want to
 
00:54:01.549 --> 00:54:01.559 align:start position:0%
let you know they um they being Dees is
 
00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
also putting together sort of a
 
00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
comparison and a side by thed for us so
 
00:54:07.349 --> 00:54:07.359 align:start position:0%
I requested that because they I to tell
 
00:54:09.030 --> 00:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
you the truth I did chat with them just
 
00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
briefly afterwards and I said you know
 
00:54:13.190 --> 00:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
we've got to reconcile these these
 
00:54:16.069 --> 00:54:16.079 align:start position:0%
different things okay great they're on
 
00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
it okay um but that won't be ready by
 
00:54:23.990 --> 00:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
Monday right this is a big okay well as
 
00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
soon as possible okay we'll we'll play
 
00:54:27.069 --> 00:54:27.079 align:start position:0%
it like that
 
00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
okay uh retirement system I okay
 
00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
so now that we've heard from the
 
00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:36.069 align:start position:0%
so now that we've heard from the
retirement

00:54:36.069 --> 00:54:36.079 align:start position:0%
retirement
 
00:54:36.079 --> 00:54:37.670 align:start position:0%
retirement
um

00:54:37.670 --> 00:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:40.309 --> 00:54:40.319 align:start position:0%
uh the retirement system about this
 
00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
group two stu
 
00:54:46.309 --> 00:54:46.319 align:start position:0%
um I'm I can't vote for what's in the
 
00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
governor's budget because
 
00:54:53.349 --> 00:54:53.359 align:start position:0%
basically um between the groups a b and
 
00:54:55.270 --> 00:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
c that well not groups what are they
 
00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:57.270 align:start position:0%
c that well not groups what are they
tiers

00:54:57.270 --> 00:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
tiers
 
00:55:00.910 --> 00:55:00.920 align:start position:0%
between the tiers ab and C do maybe I
 
00:55:03.870 --> 00:55:03.880 align:start position:0%
should recap because maybe I understand
 
00:55:07.309 --> 00:55:07.319 align:start position:0%
all this stuff now quite well but others
 
00:55:12.510 --> 00:55:12.520 align:start position:0%
probably don't remember so um so the key
 
00:55:14.990 --> 00:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
date in in the group two retirement
 
00:55:17.589 --> 00:55:17.599 align:start position:0%
system is July 1st
 
00:55:22.510 --> 00:55:22.520 align:start position:0%
2011 okay so they had a retirement plan
 
00:55:24.829 --> 00:55:24.839 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
allowed um that was fairly you know
 
00:55:30.589 --> 00:55:30.599 align:start position:0%
moderately generous I guess at the time
 
00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
and um and and allowed what is now
 
00:55:38.549 --> 00:55:38.559 align:start position:0%
called spiking which meant that you
 
00:55:40.910 --> 00:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
could work a lot of overtime toward the
 
00:55:43.589 --> 00:55:43.599 align:start position:0%
end of your career and significantly
 
00:55:44.910 --> 00:55:44.920 align:start position:0%
boost your
 
00:55:49.029 --> 00:55:49.039 align:start position:0%
retirement um uh payments in such a way
 
00:55:51.349 --> 00:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
that the retirement system hadn't
 
00:55:55.190 --> 00:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
necessarily saved for that uh payments
 
00:55:59.309 --> 00:55:59.319 align:start position:0%
because it all happened at the end so so
 
00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
there were two major changes well maybe
 
00:56:03.829 --> 00:56:03.839 align:start position:0%
more than two but there were some major
 
00:56:07.950 --> 00:56:07.960 align:start position:0%
changes made on July 1st uh 2011 in the
 
00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:10.160 align:start position:0%
budget because that was a year like this
 
00:56:13.710 --> 00:56:13.720 align:start position:0%
one where we were very short of funds
 
00:56:16.309 --> 00:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
and so a number of things happened one
 
00:56:19.750 --> 00:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
was put more of the cost of the group
 
00:56:22.029 --> 00:56:22.039 align:start position:0%
two retirement and really of all
 
00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
retirement on the employees portion and
 
00:56:28.549 --> 00:56:28.559 align:start position:0%
less on the employ EMP portion another
 
00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
change that was made was to the
 
00:56:36.349 --> 00:56:36.359 align:start position:0%
definition of compensation of of
 
00:56:39.430 --> 00:56:39.440 align:start position:0%
um average compensation right so so
 
00:56:41.710 --> 00:56:41.720 align:start position:0%
basically somebody's retirement the
 
00:56:45.309 --> 00:56:45.319 align:start position:0%
payment they get is a is a multiply
 
00:56:49.270 --> 00:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
multiple of three things one is uh their
 
00:56:53.150 --> 00:56:53.160 align:start position:0%
average compensation over their final
 
00:56:55.870 --> 00:56:55.880 align:start position:0%
some number of years right so so there's
 
00:56:59.190 --> 00:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
a definition of that one is the number
 
00:57:02.109 --> 00:57:02.119 align:start position:0%
of years they worked and one is just a
 
00:57:05.390 --> 00:57:05.400 align:start position:0%
factor a multip multiplic multiplicative
 
00:57:07.990 --> 00:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
factor and that multiplicative factor is
 
00:57:09.950 --> 00:57:09.960 align:start position:0%
quite different for group ones and group
 
00:57:12.750 --> 00:57:12.760 align:start position:0%
twos because group ones are expected to
 
00:57:15.470 --> 00:57:15.480 align:start position:0%
have a 40-year career and group twos are
 
00:57:17.589 --> 00:57:17.599 align:start position:0%
expected to have a 20-year career or
 
00:57:20.670 --> 00:57:20.680 align:start position:0%
something like that right so 25e career
 
00:57:24.029 --> 00:57:24.039 align:start position:0%
now so so the the the multiplier for
 
00:57:26.549 --> 00:57:26.559 align:start position:0%
group two is much higher than the
 
00:57:28.270 --> 00:57:28.280 align:start position:0%
multiplier for group
 
00:57:31.069 --> 00:57:31.079 align:start position:0%
one um but they're but what they're
 
00:57:33.029 --> 00:57:33.039 align:start position:0%
putting into the system what they're
 
00:57:36.549 --> 00:57:36.559 align:start position:0%
saving over time is also much bigger um
 
00:57:38.349 --> 00:57:38.359 align:start position:0%
to make it all make the numbers all work
 
00:57:40.470 --> 00:57:40.480 align:start position:0%
out okay
 
00:57:44.910 --> 00:57:44.920 align:start position:0%
so um but the big thing that changed one
 
00:57:46.789 --> 00:57:46.799 align:start position:0%
of the big so one of the big things that
 
00:57:46.799 --> 00:57:48.309 align:start position:0%
of the big so one of the big things that
changed

00:57:48.309 --> 00:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
changed
 
00:57:52.309 --> 00:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
was on that date was was the employees
 
00:57:54.510 --> 00:57:54.520 align:start position:0%
were divided into these three
 
00:57:58.390 --> 00:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
tiers tier a was the people who were who
 
00:58:00.950 --> 00:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
were vested already in that date so on
 
00:58:02.670 --> 00:58:02.680 align:start position:0%
that date they had already worked 10
 
00:58:05.029 --> 00:58:05.039 align:start position:0%
years and essentially their retirement
 
00:58:08.910 --> 00:58:08.920 align:start position:0%
system didn't change okay tier B was the
 
00:58:11.589 --> 00:58:11.599 align:start position:0%
people who were working on that date but
 
00:58:13.670 --> 00:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
had not yet vested so those are the
 
00:58:17.190 --> 00:58:17.200 align:start position:0%
younger ones um now they're older right
 
00:58:19.789 --> 00:58:19.799 align:start position:0%
but but but for those there was
 
00:58:21.910 --> 00:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
significant changes to their retirement
 
00:58:26.349 --> 00:58:26.359 align:start position:0%
system and we call those tier B and then
 
00:58:28.349 --> 00:58:28.359 align:start position:0%
tier C is the ones who were not yet
 
00:58:32.029 --> 00:58:32.039 align:start position:0%
hired on that date but you know that's
 
00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:34.240 align:start position:0%
you know that's 14 years in the past so
 
00:58:37.870 --> 00:58:37.880 align:start position:0%
now we have some right and I suppose you
 
00:58:39.270 --> 00:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
know if you wanted to you could think of
 
00:58:42.349 --> 00:58:42.359 align:start position:0%
a tier D which is people not yet hired
 
00:58:47.349 --> 00:58:47.359 align:start position:0%
now all right um and so over the years
 
00:58:49.109 --> 00:58:49.119 align:start position:0%
there have been complaints about what we
 
00:58:52.870 --> 00:58:52.880 align:start position:0%
did at that time and we have enhanced
 
00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
the retirement of tier B's
 
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
twice once was about four years ago and
 
00:59:04.750 --> 00:59:04.760 align:start position:0%
once was last year and um but we have
 
00:59:08.829 --> 00:59:08.839 align:start position:0%
not made any changes to tier C's at all
 
00:59:13.270 --> 00:59:13.280 align:start position:0%
and tier C's and and d right and newer
 
00:59:14.549 --> 00:59:14.559 align:start position:0%
people coming
 
00:59:14.559 --> 00:59:16.230 align:start position:0%
people coming
in

00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:16.240 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:59:19.390 --> 00:59:19.400 align:start position:0%
um considerably affect what we're trying
 
00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
to accomplish with these improvements
 
00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
which is retention and
 
00:59:26.750 --> 00:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
recruitment right tier B these are the
 
00:59:29.829 --> 00:59:29.839 align:start position:0%
people who are now have been working at
 
00:59:34.109 --> 00:59:34.119 align:start position:0%
least 14 years right so and they're
 
00:59:36.829 --> 00:59:36.839 align:start position:0%
group twos so you know they're toward
 
00:59:39.549 --> 00:59:39.559 align:start position:0%
the end of their careers right so and
 
00:59:40.950 --> 00:59:40.960 align:start position:0%
some of them have been
 
00:59:44.069 --> 00:59:44.079 align:start position:0%
working uh what is it if you know they
 
00:59:45.750 --> 00:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
could have been working nine years at
 
00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:48.160 align:start position:0%
the time so 9 and 14 so some of them
 
00:59:50.309 --> 00:59:50.319 align:start position:0%
have been working 23 years right so
 
00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
they're definitely getting toward
 
00:59:55.430 --> 00:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
retirement okay what we are told by the
 
00:59:57.670 --> 00:59:57.680 align:start position:0%
retirement system is that the stuff in
 
01:00:02.190 --> 01:00:02.200 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 strictly helps tier B and
 
01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
does not help tier C and in my mind
 
01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
there's two things wrong with that
 
01:00:10.630 --> 01:00:10.640 align:start position:0%
number one is the ones who need help and
 
01:00:13.549 --> 01:00:13.559 align:start position:0%
would would most help our goal of
 
01:00:16.950 --> 01:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
retention and recruitment is tier c
 
01:00:21.789 --> 01:00:21.799 align:start position:0%
number two is this stuff in House Bill 2
 
01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
is a give back in a lot of ways on
 
01:00:28.069 --> 01:00:28.079 align:start position:0%
spiking all right and that's one place I
 
01:00:32.069 --> 01:00:32.079 align:start position:0%
am absolutely not willing to go okay so
 
01:00:34.789 --> 01:00:34.799 align:start position:0%
because I think that what we changed on
 
01:00:38.349 --> 01:00:38.359 align:start position:0%
July 1st 2011 with regard to
 
01:00:41.190 --> 01:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
spiking was correct regardless of the
 
01:00:43.630 --> 01:00:43.640 align:start position:0%
financial situation right it's just
 
01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
something that that made the retirement
 
01:00:50.670 --> 01:00:50.680 align:start position:0%
system allowing spiking means the
 
01:00:52.510 --> 01:00:52.520 align:start position:0%
retirement system is somehow out of
 
01:00:56.990 --> 01:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
whack you're not saving for the eventual
 
01:01:00.069 --> 01:01:00.079 align:start position:0%
benefit as you go along right so it's
 
01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
wrong it's you know it's it's that
 
01:01:05.630 --> 01:01:05.640 align:start position:0%
simple so so I can't support what's in
 
01:01:09.870 --> 01:01:09.880 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 but what I could support is
 
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
what we had in house bill 14 1467 is
 
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
that it 16 16
 
01:01:20.789 --> 01:01:20.799 align:start position:0%
1647 what whatever there was uh from
 
01:01:24.549 --> 01:01:24.559 align:start position:0%
last year which was removed from
 
01:01:27.349 --> 01:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh by the Senate right so that Bill had
 
01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:33.599 align:start position:0%
had had improvements similar
 
01:01:38.950 --> 01:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
improvements for group tier B and tier C
 
01:01:41.789 --> 01:01:41.799 align:start position:0%
okay but the Senate removed the tier C
 
01:01:45.829 --> 01:01:45.839 align:start position:0%
portion and and left the TB portion so
 
01:01:48.870 --> 01:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
what we could do is take this stuff out
 
01:01:53.069 --> 01:01:53.079 align:start position:0%
and put back in the tier C stuff okay
 
01:01:55.309 --> 01:01:55.319 align:start position:0%
assuming and and all this is assuming we
 
01:01:58.470 --> 01:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
can afford it right because because all
 
01:02:00.789 --> 01:02:00.799 align:start position:0%
of this is new money right you know it's
 
01:02:03.630 --> 01:02:03.640 align:start position:0%
new spending and we're trying you know
 
01:02:06.430 --> 01:02:06.440 align:start position:0%
we have hard enough time meeting the old
 
01:02:09.029 --> 01:02:09.039 align:start position:0%
spending and now we and now this is an
 
01:02:11.630 --> 01:02:11.640 align:start position:0%
ask for new spending
 
01:02:13.829 --> 01:02:13.839 align:start position:0%
so anyways that's what I have to say
 
01:02:15.349 --> 01:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
about this whole thing and I asked
 
01:02:18.269 --> 01:02:18.279 align:start position:0%
Melissa to prepare an amendment to House
 
01:02:20.269 --> 01:02:20.279 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 that would do just what I just
 
01:02:23.269 --> 01:02:23.279 align:start position:0%
described which is change this stuff to
 
01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:26.920 align:start position:0%
the tierc stuff right and so
 
01:02:28.430 --> 01:02:28.440 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that what stage that's
 
01:02:31.069 --> 01:02:31.079 align:start position:0%
in if that's ready or not ready it's
 
01:02:33.870 --> 01:02:33.880 align:start position:0%
still pending in all us okay yes
 
01:02:35.510 --> 01:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
representative Camrose thank you Mr
 
01:02:38.589 --> 01:02:38.599 align:start position:0%
chair yeah I like that plan because uh
 
01:02:40.470 --> 01:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
the fact is is that over the last four
 
01:02:42.829 --> 01:02:42.839 align:start position:0%
years if you as you stated we've made a
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
good faith effort to make reparations
 
01:02:48.109 --> 01:02:48.119 align:start position:0%
for the tier B people for what was done
 
01:02:52.549 --> 01:02:52.559 align:start position:0%
to them back in 2011 but right now if we
 
01:02:54.190 --> 01:02:54.200 align:start position:0%
have any money that we can't spend as
 
01:02:55.549 --> 01:02:55.559 align:start position:0%
you said we don't even know if we have
 
01:02:57.950 --> 01:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
the money money but if we do I believe
 
01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:00.640 align:start position:0%
that is better spent uh going toward
 
01:03:03.309 --> 01:03:03.319 align:start position:0%
tier C so that we can have retainment
 
01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:06.160 align:start position:0%
and recruit and recruiting uh improve
 
01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:07.960 align:start position:0%
our recruiting for these essential
 
01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
services so okay represent Ms um thank
 
01:03:16.150 --> 01:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
you um since this is such a big part of
 
01:03:20.069 --> 01:03:20.079 align:start position:0%
hb2 and one of the major um points of
 
01:03:22.470 --> 01:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
emphasis by the governor before we make
 
01:03:23.910 --> 01:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
any changes I'm wondering if we
 
01:03:25.349 --> 01:03:25.359 align:start position:0%
shouldn't invite the governor's office
 
01:03:27.789 --> 01:03:27.799 align:start position:0%
to come in and talk to us and just you
 
01:03:29.390 --> 01:03:29.400 align:start position:0%
know and give us a chance to talk to
 
01:03:32.910 --> 01:03:32.920 align:start position:0%
them directly about you know what what
 
01:03:34.829 --> 01:03:34.839 align:start position:0%
you know what they're doing why and why
 
01:03:35.870 --> 01:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
they're doing it the way they're
 
01:03:39.710 --> 01:03:39.720 align:start position:0%
proposing so Mr Jerry yeah is that yeah
 
01:03:42.390 --> 01:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
represent a run yeah I don't disagree
 
01:03:45.069 --> 01:03:45.079 align:start position:0%
with you Mr chair but one point you made
 
01:03:47.630 --> 01:03:47.640 align:start position:0%
that I I I want to add some comment to
 
01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
is regarding the tier B employees
 
01:03:51.789 --> 01:03:51.799 align:start position:0%
because even though they may have been
 
01:03:55.470 --> 01:03:55.480 align:start position:0%
working for 9 to 12 years we've invested
 
01:03:57.510 --> 01:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
a lot lot of money and their training
 
01:03:59.670 --> 01:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
and their experience and they're
 
01:04:03.230 --> 01:04:03.240 align:start position:0%
probably in their 30s maybe late 30s and
 
01:04:05.950 --> 01:04:05.960 align:start position:0%
what um at least from what I've read um
 
01:04:08.029 --> 01:04:08.039 align:start position:0%
lately the changes in the whole labor
 
01:04:10.109 --> 01:04:10.119 align:start position:0%
market and labor Dynamics is those are
 
01:04:11.589 --> 01:04:11.599 align:start position:0%
the people that get cherry-picked by
 
01:04:13.829 --> 01:04:13.839 align:start position:0%
other companies because they can usually
 
01:04:15.390 --> 01:04:15.400 align:start position:0%
go into another company and hit the
 
01:04:18.549 --> 01:04:18.559 align:start position:0%
ground running um I don't know how that
 
01:04:21.630 --> 01:04:21.640 align:start position:0%
translates with government service but
 
01:04:25.190 --> 01:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
um I just want us to just be wary we may
 
01:04:27.029 --> 01:04:27.039 align:start position:0%
be be care careful what we ask for
 
01:04:30.349 --> 01:04:30.359 align:start position:0%
because if we can't retain those tier B
 
01:04:33.630 --> 01:04:33.640 align:start position:0%
employees we may find a brain drain that
 
01:04:36.390 --> 01:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
happens um if they if they do happen to
 
01:04:38.789 --> 01:04:38.799 align:start position:0%
leave I think retaining people in their
 
01:04:40.950 --> 01:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
late 30s is as important as retaining
 
01:04:43.510 --> 01:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
people in their 20s I understand but I
 
01:04:45.510 --> 01:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
I'll respond to that which
 
01:04:48.990 --> 01:04:49.000 align:start position:0%
is somebody it's it's it's harder for
 
01:04:51.910 --> 01:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
somebody in that situation to leave the
 
01:04:55.710 --> 01:04:55.720 align:start position:0%
job than it is for a younger one because
 
01:04:57.710 --> 01:04:57.720 align:start position:0%
every year they continue to work is
 
01:04:59.990 --> 01:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
another year on the multiplier for the
 
01:05:03.950 --> 01:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
pension right and and we've already
 
01:05:06.510 --> 01:05:06.520 align:start position:0%
increased uh the number that gets
 
01:05:08.789 --> 01:05:08.799 align:start position:0%
multiplied by and I think we did it in a
 
01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
way that's tiered so that the longer you
 
01:05:14.430 --> 01:05:14.440 align:start position:0%
work the bigger the multiplier gets as
 
01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:15.630 align:start position:0%
work the bigger the multiplier gets as
well

01:05:15.630 --> 01:05:15.640 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
as the number of years going bigger so
 
01:05:20.430 --> 01:05:20.440 align:start position:0%
there's kind of a double there's a
 
01:05:24.390 --> 01:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
there's already in law I I believe a uh
 
01:05:27.150 --> 01:05:27.160 align:start position:0%
an incentive to work long ER basically
 
01:05:30.510 --> 01:05:30.520 align:start position:0%
okay represent run it it's it's an
 
01:05:33.230 --> 01:05:33.240 align:start position:0%
interesting discussion to have because
 
01:05:35.549 --> 01:05:35.559 align:start position:0%
if they do leave at that point in their
 
01:05:37.670 --> 01:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
career they may be getting substantially
 
01:05:39.789 --> 01:05:39.799 align:start position:0%
better income so do they consider that a
 
01:05:43.150 --> 01:05:43.160 align:start position:0%
tradeoff with their retirement benefits
 
01:05:46.950 --> 01:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
and many times I mean it it could be um
 
01:05:48.750 --> 01:05:48.760 align:start position:0%
what you're saying just because many
 
01:05:52.190 --> 01:05:52.200 align:start position:0%
companies don't offer pension program so
 
01:05:54.109 --> 01:05:54.119 align:start position:0%
um so remember we're talking here about
 
01:05:56.390 --> 01:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
group two these are policemen
 
01:05:59.750 --> 01:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
Corrections Officers and firemen so so
 
01:06:01.870 --> 01:06:01.880 align:start position:0%
we are not talking about companies
 
01:06:03.630 --> 01:06:03.640 align:start position:0%
unless you know maybe there's some kind
 
01:06:05.430 --> 01:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
of security company or something like
 
01:06:07.789 --> 01:06:07.799 align:start position:0%
that right but generally
 
01:06:11.029 --> 01:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
speaking point Thank you represent MTH
 
01:06:12.510 --> 01:06:12.520 align:start position:0%
you know the other the other I guess
 
01:06:15.510 --> 01:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
other concern I have is
 
01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
um you know we're we're focusing on the
 
01:06:22.150 --> 01:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
tier the tier B um individuals and as
 
01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
you mentioned there are some individuals
 
01:06:28.309 --> 01:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
in that group that had nine years of
 
01:06:32.710 --> 01:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
service prior to this change um that was
 
01:06:38.990 --> 01:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
made in um in in um uh in in
 
01:06:43.309 --> 01:06:43.319 align:start position:0%
2011 um and they were hired with the
 
01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
understanding that their pensions would
 
01:06:47.829 --> 01:06:47.839 align:start position:0%
be based on the formula that was in
 
01:06:51.430 --> 01:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
effect prior to 71 and that formula
 
01:06:54.029 --> 01:06:54.039 align:start position:0%
allowed their average compens final
 
01:06:56.549 --> 01:06:56.559 align:start position:0%
average compensation to to
 
01:07:00.269 --> 01:07:00.279 align:start position:0%
include things like overtime Etc um if
 
01:07:02.190 --> 01:07:02.200 align:start position:0%
the goal is to
 
01:07:06.870 --> 01:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
restore um the benefits that they
 
01:07:12.150 --> 01:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
lost then you know we we we should we
 
01:07:14.670 --> 01:07:14.680 align:start position:0%
should we should also restore the
 
01:07:16.670 --> 01:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
language around average compensation I
 
01:07:18.470 --> 01:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
mean if we're if you know I think it's a
 
01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
it's a question of equity and and and
 
01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
fairness um and um you know kind of
 
01:07:28.190 --> 01:07:28.200 align:start position:0%
restoring something that that was taken
 
01:07:29.990 --> 01:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
away from them after they were
 
01:07:32.750 --> 01:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
hired yeah and I think that kind of
 
01:07:35.069 --> 01:07:35.079 align:start position:0%
argument was what was persuasive to the
 
01:07:38.430 --> 01:07:38.440 align:start position:0%
legislature to do what we've done the
 
01:07:41.829 --> 01:07:41.839 align:start position:0%
last four years right but but not the
 
01:07:45.230 --> 01:07:45.240 align:start position:0%
specifics about changing the definition
 
01:07:49.870 --> 01:07:49.880 align:start position:0%
of income um so I can I can yeah not
 
01:07:51.470 --> 01:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
changing the definition we're restoring
 
01:07:55.750 --> 01:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
the definition okay but but
 
01:07:58.750 --> 01:07:58.760 align:start position:0%
there's strong reason to to to why that
 
01:08:01.870 --> 01:08:01.880 align:start position:0%
change was made and it and it wasn't
 
01:08:04.670 --> 01:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
just to save money at the time right it
 
01:08:06.230 --> 01:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
it was
 
01:08:11.950 --> 01:08:11.960 align:start position:0%
to make the retirement system save for
 
01:08:16.309 --> 01:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
as you go along for for the eventual um
 
01:08:18.829 --> 01:08:18.839 align:start position:0%
for the the eventual pension yes
 
01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
representative well two things I
 
01:08:23.749 --> 01:08:23.759 align:start position:0%
wondered if you had calculated the
 
01:08:26.829 --> 01:08:26.839 align:start position:0%
fiscal effect of your proposal versus
 
01:08:29.669 --> 01:08:29.679 align:start position:0%
what the governor has and then the
 
01:08:31.910 --> 01:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
second question was how that aligned
 
01:08:37.030 --> 01:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
with um the Edna recommendations or yeah
 
01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
that were provided and to tell you the
 
01:08:43.470 --> 01:08:43.480 align:start position:0%
truth I I just I don't remember spe
 
01:08:45.749 --> 01:08:45.759 align:start position:0%
answer to the second question the the
 
01:08:47.950 --> 01:08:47.960 align:start position:0%
and we could look but the answer to the
 
01:08:50.269 --> 01:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
first question is we think it's roughly
 
01:08:54.149 --> 01:08:54.159 align:start position:0%
half I think um is that right Melissa we
 
01:08:56.430 --> 01:08:56.440 align:start position:0%
think this is a 28 million instead of a
 
01:08:58.309 --> 01:08:58.319 align:start position:0%
28 two it's probably going to come in
 
01:09:01.269 --> 01:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
somewhere between 25 and 27 million or a
 
01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
one time a one time as opposed to what
 
01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
two times yeah or 10 yeah two time in
 
01:09:08.829 --> 01:09:08.839 align:start position:0%
this budget 10 year total I also want to
 
01:09:11.749 --> 01:09:11.759 align:start position:0%
make one one clarification um for hb1
 
01:09:13.950 --> 01:09:13.960 align:start position:0%
1647 that was passed by the house but
 
01:09:18.749 --> 01:09:18.759 align:start position:0%
not passed by um the Senate and that is
 
01:09:22.749 --> 01:09:22.759 align:start position:0%
there is a a gain for um tier B group
 
01:09:22.759 --> 01:09:23.630 align:start position:0%
there is a a gain for um tier B group
two

01:09:23.630 --> 01:09:23.640 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:09:25.749 --> 01:09:25.759 align:start position:0%
members because what passed the Senate
 
01:09:27.390 --> 01:09:27.400 align:start position:0%
was 15 years they had to work at least
 
01:09:28.630 --> 01:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
15 years to get the two and a half
 
01:09:31.590 --> 01:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
multiplier the house version is 10 years
 
01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
so group two tier B would pick up five
 
01:09:36.189 --> 01:09:36.199 align:start position:0%
they would have to work so it does a
 
01:09:38.430 --> 01:09:38.440 align:start position:0%
little fores I just want to point that
 
01:09:41.269 --> 01:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
understand would beand but C's yeah and
 
01:09:43.309 --> 01:09:43.319 align:start position:0%
and it probably I mean it's probably a
 
01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
little more expensive because we're
 
01:09:48.630 --> 01:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
talking about doing it a year later
 
01:09:51.309 --> 01:09:51.319 align:start position:0%
right so the the longer you wait I would
 
01:09:53.709 --> 01:09:53.719 align:start position:0%
probably you know I would think that we
 
01:09:57.270 --> 01:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
may have to add like six half% to the C
 
01:10:00.350 --> 01:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
to what was in the fiscal note last time
 
01:10:02.189 --> 01:10:02.199 align:start position:0%
if you see what I mean
 
01:10:04.390 --> 01:10:04.400 align:start position:0%
right I can see that point and I think
 
01:10:07.189 --> 01:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
it may be offset by any people who have
 
01:10:10.189 --> 01:10:10.199 align:start position:0%
left sure since then I don't know what
 
01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
the numbers are but I mean this is a
 
01:10:14.669 --> 01:10:14.679 align:start position:0%
detail but
 
01:10:17.950 --> 01:10:17.960 align:start position:0%
basically the the unfunded liability
 
01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
Grows by 6 and a half per cent per year
 
01:10:23.149 --> 01:10:23.159 align:start position:0%
essentially right it's it's it's there's
 
01:10:26.189 --> 01:10:26.199 align:start position:0%
an assumed rate of return in in in
 
01:10:28.709 --> 01:10:28.719 align:start position:0%
giving them a dollar today if you don't
 
01:10:30.790 --> 01:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
do it you have to give them a doar six
 
01:10:31.950 --> 01:10:31.960 align:start position:0%
and a
 
01:10:36.310 --> 01:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
half next year right and so uh because
 
01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:36.950 align:start position:0%
half next year right and so uh because
we

01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:10:40.430 --> 01:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
didn't uh fund this benefit last year it
 
01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
makes it times 1.06 5 this year kind of
 
01:10:48.189 --> 01:10:48.199 align:start position:0%
but anybody in group b who would have
 
01:10:50.550 --> 01:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
gotten their pension improved by this
 
01:10:52.270 --> 01:10:52.280 align:start position:0%
and retired in the
 
01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:54.719 align:start position:0%
meantime once you retire your pension
 
01:10:55.950 --> 01:10:55.960 align:start position:0%
never Chang
 
01:10:58.910 --> 01:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
right and so uh they would not count and
 
01:11:00.149 --> 01:11:00.159 align:start position:0%
therefore there's some saving yes
 
01:11:01.910 --> 01:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
represent mon I I you know I think
 
01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
another thing just following up on what
 
01:11:07.669 --> 01:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
representative eel said I mean um I
 
01:11:08.910 --> 01:11:08.920 align:start position:0%
think before
 
01:11:12.630 --> 01:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
we you know before we we start making
 
01:11:14.990 --> 01:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
changes to language that's in hb2 I
 
01:11:17.110 --> 01:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
think it's important that we understand
 
01:11:18.910 --> 01:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
exactly what that language is going to
 
01:11:20.990 --> 01:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
cost I mean when the people from the New
 
01:11:24.070 --> 01:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system were in they
 
01:11:28.390 --> 01:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
indicated or implied that what's that
 
01:11:30.630 --> 01:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
what's the language in
 
01:11:34.030 --> 01:11:34.040 align:start position:0%
hb2 will not cost as much as it as the
 
01:11:36.590 --> 01:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
money that's in hb1 you're right about
 
01:11:38.189 --> 01:11:38.199 align:start position:0%
that by about I think it was like about
 
01:11:40.229 --> 01:11:40.239 align:start position:0%
$10 million if I'm not mistaken but
 
01:11:42.470 --> 01:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
don't hold me to that so I think it
 
01:11:45.270 --> 01:11:45.280 align:start position:0%
would be important to kind of know again
 
01:11:46.629 --> 01:11:46.639 align:start position:0%
I think it's important that we
 
01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
understand from the governor's office
 
01:11:50.229 --> 01:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
directly what it is that they were you
 
01:11:52.750 --> 01:11:52.760 align:start position:0%
know what they you know their their
 
01:11:54.990 --> 01:11:55.000 align:start position:0%
their perspective on things but then
 
01:11:57.229 --> 01:11:57.239 align:start position:0%
understand what's that going to cost and
 
01:11:59.430 --> 01:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
then if there's an alternative that you
 
01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
or others want to suggest what's the
 
01:12:03.070 --> 01:12:03.080 align:start position:0%
cost of that okay so we can we can
 
01:12:05.310 --> 01:12:05.320 align:start position:0%
compare the two of them yeah Apples to
 
01:12:10.030 --> 01:12:10.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
so so to what degree do we know the cost
 
01:12:17.110 --> 01:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
of these sections Melissa do we I mean
 
01:12:19.110 --> 01:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
did the retirement system give
 
01:12:22.830 --> 01:12:22.840 align:start position:0%
us like a fiscal note type I'm in talks
 
01:12:24.510 --> 01:12:24.520 align:start position:0%
with them right now so they have not yet
 
01:12:26.149 --> 01:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
but they're listening now and they will
 
01:12:30.229 --> 01:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
get that b but for H but for
 
01:12:32.750 --> 01:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
hb2 we they they did the analysis on
 
01:12:35.470 --> 01:12:35.480 align:start position:0%
27.5 million and that was overpaid over
 
01:12:36.990 --> 01:12:37.000 align:start position:0%
10 years because it does reduce the
 
01:12:40.390 --> 01:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability um I think it was by
 
01:12:42.669 --> 01:12:42.679 align:start position:0%
like $100 million or something right
 
01:12:45.070 --> 01:12:45.080 align:start position:0%
right so with that being said though
 
01:12:46.990 --> 01:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
that's a 10year provision I don't know
 
01:12:50.430 --> 01:12:50.440 align:start position:0%
how much of an impact it would be if you
 
01:12:53.189 --> 01:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
funded it to the actual cost so there's
 
01:12:57.270 --> 01:12:57.280 align:start position:0%
two options either 26 and 27 that 27.5
 
01:12:59.550 --> 01:12:59.560 align:start position:0%
million would either go down or maybe
 
01:13:01.950 --> 01:13:01.960 align:start position:0%
you'd pay it for eight years versus 10
 
01:13:04.510 --> 01:13:04.520 align:start position:0%
years which in turn wouldn't impact the
 
01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
budget okay maybe you can ask them not
 
01:13:11.629 --> 01:13:11.639 align:start position:0%
as a tenear thing but as a all at once
 
01:13:13.830 --> 01:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
type of thing right what's the actual
 
01:13:17.830 --> 01:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
number and do that for both both sides
 
01:13:20.350 --> 01:13:20.360 align:start position:0%
so yes represent month and I I think
 
01:13:22.629 --> 01:13:22.639 align:start position:0%
what's important in in in in the in the
 
01:13:25.350 --> 01:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
ask is that we ask them to to to C cost
 
01:13:28.550 --> 01:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
it out you know without there being any
 
01:13:30.669 --> 01:13:30.679 align:start position:0%
change in the unfunded liability because
 
01:13:32.470 --> 01:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
apparently what what they what they
 
01:13:34.390 --> 01:13:34.400 align:start position:0%
indicated was with the at the funding
 
01:13:37.030 --> 01:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
levels that are in hb1 it would reduce
 
01:13:39.149 --> 01:13:39.159 align:start position:0%
the unfunded liability by $100 million
 
01:13:41.550 --> 01:13:41.560 align:start position:0%
well that's not what we're asking but
 
01:13:45.390 --> 01:13:45.400 align:start position:0%
that's assuming whatever we put into the
 
01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
they were assuming that we actually were
 
01:13:50.990 --> 01:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
going to spend in the next four
 
01:13:53.510 --> 01:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
bienniums the same that we're spending
 
01:13:56.830 --> 01:13:56.840 align:start position:0%
now you see what I me I mean so that may
 
01:13:59.910 --> 01:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
not be quite fair either
 
01:14:03.229 --> 01:14:03.239 align:start position:0%
right yeah okay representative I'm sorry
 
01:14:05.629 --> 01:14:05.639 align:start position:0%
Melissa yeah so one other thing to think
 
01:14:07.790 --> 01:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
about so when you're working with the
 
01:14:10.030 --> 01:14:10.040 align:start position:0%
retirement and funding you have two
 
01:14:13.110 --> 01:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
costs that you have to pay for one are
 
01:14:15.270 --> 01:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
restoring the benefits so I look at it
 
01:14:18.229 --> 01:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
as like the backfill of the cost so when
 
01:14:20.229 --> 01:14:20.239 align:start position:0%
you say the onetime P what would the
 
01:14:22.709 --> 01:14:22.719 align:start position:0%
onetime payment be I assume that would
 
01:14:26.110 --> 01:14:26.120 align:start position:0%
to be to backfill all the costs yes the
 
01:14:28.669 --> 01:14:28.679 align:start position:0%
next payment would be your future cost
 
01:14:30.830 --> 01:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
which is included when you have 10 years
 
01:14:32.910 --> 01:14:32.920 align:start position:0%
of payments municipalities aren't going
 
01:14:35.550 --> 01:14:35.560 align:start position:0%
to increase any um of their contribution
 
01:14:37.629 --> 01:14:37.639 align:start position:0%
rates because we're paying those with a
 
01:14:39.669 --> 01:14:39.679 align:start position:0%
general fund appropriation for 10 years
 
01:14:42.149 --> 01:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
so if you do fund it at a one-year
 
01:14:44.669 --> 01:14:44.679 align:start position:0%
backfill cost there will be a cost for
 
01:14:46.830 --> 01:14:46.840 align:start position:0%
future years because those are a new
 
01:14:49.149 --> 01:14:49.159 align:start position:0%
benefit ad and new benefit ads cost
 
01:14:51.470 --> 01:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
money every single year yeah and it's
 
01:14:55.310 --> 01:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
not possible well it's because we have
 
01:14:58.910 --> 01:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
no idea how many police fire Corrections
 
01:15:01.550 --> 01:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
people will be hired from now to the end
 
01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
of time right it's not possible to sort
 
01:15:08.189 --> 01:15:08.199 align:start position:0%
of cover all those costs
 
01:15:11.470 --> 01:15:11.480 align:start position:0%
today right so so at least some of an
 
01:15:13.950 --> 01:15:13.960 align:start position:0%
increased benefit
 
01:15:18.229 --> 01:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
does go on the employers taxpayers later
 
01:15:20.629 --> 01:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
right I mean it's just impossible okay
 
01:15:21.709 --> 01:15:21.719 align:start position:0%
yes that's correct whenever you're
 
01:15:23.430 --> 01:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
making a change to the retirement and
 
01:15:26.030 --> 01:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
giving a new benefit
 
01:15:27.470 --> 01:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
right even if it's restored and then
 
01:15:29.350 --> 01:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
it's continued to be new that is always
 
01:15:31.750 --> 01:15:31.760 align:start position:0%
an increased cost that will if not paid
 
01:15:33.910 --> 01:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
for Forever by the state it will be paid
 
01:15:36.790 --> 01:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
for by but we can pay for it for those
 
01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
people who are now hired and we know
 
01:15:41.510 --> 01:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
what they're going to be doing right so
 
01:15:44.070 --> 01:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
we or we have a reasonable idea okay all
 
01:15:46.110 --> 01:15:46.120 align:start position:0%
right so we're going to wait on on this
 
01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
stuff but I I just wanted to be make it
 
01:15:50.189 --> 01:15:50.199 align:start position:0%
clear where I'm I'm standing
 
01:15:53.310 --> 01:15:53.320 align:start position:0%
on on these sections but but this is a
 
01:15:56.870 --> 01:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
big deal um because it spends more money
 
01:16:00.110 --> 01:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
anybody else want to make any comments
 
01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:01.070 align:start position:0%
anybody else want to make any comments
representative

01:16:01.070 --> 01:16:01.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:16:03.629 --> 01:16:03.639 align:start position:0%
Lehman and it was represent of Lehman's
 
01:16:07.310 --> 01:16:07.320 align:start position:0%
bill which was House Bill 16 yes I want
 
01:16:08.910 --> 01:16:08.920 align:start position:0%
to thank you for all your help because
 
01:16:12.229 --> 01:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
you are a co-signer to that bill no I
 
01:16:14.110 --> 01:16:14.120 align:start position:0%
would just agree with you Mr chairman I
 
01:16:17.350 --> 01:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
think we need to focus on the tier C
 
01:16:18.950 --> 01:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
that's what we're trying to do to bring
 
01:16:21.390 --> 01:16:21.400 align:start position:0%
parody If you will to the retirement
 
01:16:23.910 --> 01:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
system uh a lot of work went into that
 
01:16:27.870 --> 01:16:27.880 align:start position:0%
bill by both Edna finance committee it
 
01:16:30.189 --> 01:16:30.199 align:start position:0%
was the house position to do that as
 
01:16:33.910 --> 01:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
well so I it's going to be at least half
 
01:16:36.110 --> 01:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
the cost of the governor what I've
 
01:16:38.910 --> 01:16:38.920 align:start position:0%
quickly figured on my napkin over here
 
01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
so I think it's a way to go we we may
 
01:16:43.830 --> 01:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
not be able to afford even that that's
 
01:16:45.750 --> 01:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
right but I think at least takes care of
 
01:16:47.470 --> 01:16:47.480 align:start position:0%
those people that have been left off
 
01:16:49.950 --> 01:16:49.960 align:start position:0%
that we try to take care of last year so
 
01:16:52.950 --> 01:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
okay very simple thank you so now we can
 
01:16:56.350 --> 01:16:56.360 align:start position:0%
go to page two of our little
 
01:16:58.390 --> 01:16:58.400 align:start position:0%
does everybody have this by the way this
 
01:17:05.189 --> 01:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
is the uh the updated um so Melissa puts
 
01:17:07.390 --> 01:17:07.400 align:start position:0%
this online by the way if you if you go
 
01:17:10.390 --> 01:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
to the LBA website in the division one
 
01:17:13.310 --> 01:17:13.320 align:start position:0%
section um you can always get this this
 
01:17:17.790 --> 01:17:17.800 align:start position:0%
updated list so okay um but it it's
 
01:17:20.310 --> 01:17:20.320 align:start position:0%
what's nice about it is the the sections
 
01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
we've T been taken care of are grayed
 
01:17:24.430 --> 01:17:24.440 align:start position:0%
out so we can know kind of where we
 
01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:25.750 align:start position:0%
out so we can know kind of where we
stand

01:17:25.750 --> 01:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
stand
 
01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:27.350 align:start position:0%
stand
okay

01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:28.950 align:start position:0%
okay
um

01:17:28.950 --> 01:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:52.629 --> 01:17:52.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:57.270 --> 01:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
43 and section 72 and
 
01:17:57.280 --> 01:17:58.870 align:start position:0%
43 and section 72 and
73

01:17:58.870 --> 01:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
73
 
01:18:02.629 --> 01:18:02.639 align:start position:0%
so um what we put in the budget two
 
01:18:02.639 --> 01:18:03.590 align:start position:0%
so um what we put in the budget two
years

01:18:03.590 --> 01:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:18:08.870 --> 01:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
ago um said that uh we we allocated $5
 
01:18:15.270 --> 01:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:16.790 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:18:16.790 --> 01:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:20.750 --> 01:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
so we said it shall not lapse until July
 
01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:22.430 align:start position:0%
so we said it shall not lapse until July
30th

01:18:22.430 --> 01:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
30th
 
01:18:26.830 --> 01:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
2025 Okay so some of this money if not
 
01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
all is unspent and so the governor wants
 
01:18:32.229 --> 01:18:32.239 align:start position:0%
this program to continue for another
 
01:18:35.470 --> 01:18:35.480 align:start position:0%
year okay personally I'd rather have the
 
01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:37.910 align:start position:0%
year okay personally I'd rather have the
money

01:18:37.910 --> 01:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:18:41.350 --> 01:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
so so um you know I would propose to
 
01:18:43.310 --> 01:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
remove this section but I don't know
 
01:18:47.430 --> 01:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
what others think about it yes um do we
 
01:18:49.990 --> 01:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
know what the balance of that is in that
 
01:18:55.030 --> 01:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
fund Melissa so I spoke with Bea earlier
 
01:18:58.350 --> 01:18:58.360 align:start position:0%
this week I believe about 112,000 has
 
01:19:01.149 --> 01:19:01.159 align:start position:0%
already been 112,000 is has already been
 
01:19:02.790 --> 01:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
expended from the fund for a position
 
01:19:05.990 --> 01:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
that was um created to handle this they
 
01:19:09.590 --> 01:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
do anti anticipate that they will be
 
01:19:10.750 --> 01:19:10.760 align:start position:0%
going to
 
01:19:15.950 --> 01:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
GNC in June uh to obligate the bulk of
 
01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:16.830 align:start position:0%
GNC in June uh to obligate the bulk of
this

01:19:16.830 --> 01:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:19:19.510 --> 01:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
money and then I think the beginning of
 
01:19:22.790 --> 01:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
July it will actually be um
 
01:19:25.110 --> 01:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
expended but as of right now for any
 
01:19:26.830 --> 01:19:26.840 align:start position:0%
grants there has been zero grants that
 
01:19:28.350 --> 01:19:28.360 align:start position:0%
have been approved as they've been
 
01:19:30.750 --> 01:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
getting the program up and running okay
 
01:19:33.470 --> 01:19:33.480 align:start position:0%
so the point is if we took this out it
 
01:19:36.070 --> 01:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
would be up to GNC to
 
01:19:40.990 --> 01:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
decide whether to spend this or not okay
 
01:19:44.229 --> 01:19:44.239 align:start position:0%
um all right represent month so it
 
01:19:46.030 --> 01:19:46.040 align:start position:0%
sounds Melissa like if I heard you
 
01:19:49.870 --> 01:19:49.880 align:start position:0%
correctly that um while the bulk of that
 
01:19:52.830 --> 01:19:52.840 align:start position:0%
money hasn't been spent they have
 
01:19:56.110 --> 01:19:56.120 align:start position:0%
identified potential
 
01:19:58.950 --> 01:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
Grant Awards recipients Etc yes they
 
01:20:00.790 --> 01:20:00.800 align:start position:0%
have exceeded the five million in
 
01:20:04.149 --> 01:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
requests for Grant Awards okay so if we
 
01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
took this money
 
01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:07.310 align:start position:0%
took this money
away

01:20:07.310 --> 01:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
away
 
01:20:10.390 --> 01:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
then those people would be um anybody
 
01:20:14.229 --> 01:20:14.239 align:start position:0%
who came in later than July 30th 2025
 
01:20:16.709 --> 01:20:16.719 align:start position:0%
would be out of luck but but it would be
 
01:20:20.189 --> 01:20:20.199 align:start position:0%
up to GN GNC could simply refuse this
 
01:20:23.470 --> 01:20:23.480 align:start position:0%
item right that's also correct yeah so
 
01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:26.470 align:start position:0%
item right that's also correct yeah so
um

01:20:26.470 --> 01:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:28.709 --> 01:20:28.719 align:start position:0%
anyways I just don't feel like extending
 
01:20:30.669 --> 01:20:30.679 align:start position:0%
it let's put it that way
 
01:20:33.430 --> 01:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
represent i' have a hard time voting
 
01:20:36.629 --> 01:20:36.639 align:start position:0%
against the removal even though I feel
 
01:20:39.510 --> 01:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
like a lot of this money is going to be
 
01:20:43.790 --> 01:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
all seed up by you know by by the date I
 
01:20:46.189 --> 01:20:46.199 align:start position:0%
mean just knowing how everyone feels
 
01:20:49.430 --> 01:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
about um about housing I guess the other
 
01:20:52.310 --> 01:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
thing I'd observe is this is I think
 
01:20:55.550 --> 01:20:55.560 align:start position:0%
this is really the only financial nod to
 
01:20:58.709 --> 01:20:58.719 align:start position:0%
housing that's in this budget because
 
01:21:02.149 --> 01:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
she hasn't put any other money in it
 
01:21:06.229 --> 01:21:06.239 align:start position:0%
so okay represent R and uh this 5
 
01:21:08.189 --> 01:21:08.199 align:start position:0%
million it's not like we're going to be
 
01:21:10.629 --> 01:21:10.639 align:start position:0%
spending five million more it's just
 
01:21:13.590 --> 01:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
really it would be getting taking money
 
01:21:15.550 --> 01:21:15.560 align:start position:0%
out of that fund to go to the general
 
01:21:20.270 --> 01:21:20.280 align:start position:0%
fund if it is not spent by the end of
 
01:21:22.830 --> 01:21:22.840 align:start position:0%
June so essentially what I've heard from
 
01:21:25.229 --> 01:21:25.239 align:start position:0%
Alissa is that we there are
 
01:21:28.070 --> 01:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
applications that would consume all if
 
01:21:31.110 --> 01:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
not most of this grant already with the
 
01:21:34.070 --> 01:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
money that's in there it's not a new
 
01:21:36.030 --> 01:21:36.040 align:start position:0%
appropriation it's money that's already
 
01:21:39.629 --> 01:21:39.639 align:start position:0%
there so I I would and I I also think I
 
01:21:42.629 --> 01:21:42.639 align:start position:0%
mean but but bear in mind that the
 
01:21:46.030 --> 01:21:46.040 align:start position:0%
general fund is $160 million short for
 
01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
the current
 
01:21:51.110 --> 01:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
Bia so personally if I were the governor
 
01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
I would recommend to the council not to
 
01:21:56.270 --> 01:21:56.280 align:start position:0%
approve these things right because
 
01:21:59.510 --> 01:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
because it's her responsibility to make
 
01:22:03.470 --> 01:22:03.480 align:start position:0%
every bium come out and and
 
01:22:05.870 --> 01:22:05.880 align:start position:0%
not I mean what she did in the in the
 
01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:07.149 align:start position:0%
not I mean what she did in the in the
budget

01:22:07.149 --> 01:22:07.159 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:22:11.350 --> 01:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
of uh taking 81 million from the rainy
 
01:22:13.870 --> 01:22:13.880 align:start position:0%
day fund and from our point of view 160
 
01:22:15.669 --> 01:22:15.679 align:start position:0%
million from the rainy day
 
01:22:18.110 --> 01:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
fund you know that shouldn't happen
 
01:22:19.709 --> 01:22:19.719 align:start position:0%
right so yes
 
01:22:22.709 --> 01:22:22.719 align:start position:0%
represent yeah but I I I agree with
 
01:22:25.149 --> 01:22:25.159 align:start position:0%
representative evil I mean if I would
 
01:22:26.550 --> 01:22:26.560 align:start position:0%
if I was the governor I'd certainly want
 
01:22:28.390 --> 01:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
to spend this because other than this
 
01:22:31.870 --> 01:22:31.880 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in in your budget for
 
01:22:35.270 --> 01:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
housing okay anybody else want to talk
 
01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:37.030 align:start position:0%
housing okay anybody else want to talk
about

01:22:37.030 --> 01:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:22:41.310 --> 01:22:41.320 align:start position:0%
this represent GFF is $5 million we got
 
01:22:43.629 --> 01:22:43.639 align:start position:0%
to put that in perspective it's it's
 
01:22:45.629 --> 01:22:45.639 align:start position:0%
hard to come by $5
 
01:22:48.189 --> 01:22:48.199 align:start position:0%
million we're scratching to get our
 
01:22:50.950 --> 01:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
share yeah of what we got to come up
 
01:22:55.229 --> 01:22:55.239 align:start position:0%
with yeah and it's it's probably
 
01:22:58.189 --> 01:22:58.199 align:start position:0%
the least painful piece we can take
 
01:23:01.550 --> 01:23:01.560 align:start position:0%
away yeah representative c yeah and this
 
01:23:03.390 --> 01:23:03.400 align:start position:0%
is housing is not a new issue it's been
 
01:23:06.709 --> 01:23:06.719 align:start position:0%
going on for the last you know uh six
 
01:23:09.110 --> 01:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
seven eight years and they fact is they
 
01:23:10.510 --> 01:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
had the opportunity and they didn't
 
01:23:12.870 --> 01:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
spend it and uh and now we're in a
 
01:23:15.030 --> 01:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
position where we need this money for
 
01:23:17.750 --> 01:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
other important things so I believe we
 
01:23:20.910 --> 01:23:20.920 align:start position:0%
need to take this money all right so why
 
01:23:23.430 --> 01:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
don't we try a vote and see what
 
01:23:27.189 --> 01:23:27.199 align:start position:0%
happens all right um so I think it's
 
01:23:30.910 --> 01:23:30.920 align:start position:0%
representative cell Mr Mr chairman just
 
01:23:33.310 --> 01:23:33.320 align:start position:0%
just leaned over and asked Alyssa if she
 
01:23:35.629 --> 01:23:35.639 align:start position:0%
could check but we had money for invest
 
01:23:39.070 --> 01:23:39.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to last time which was 10
 
01:23:41.629 --> 01:23:41.639 align:start position:0%
or 20 million so she's going to double
 
01:23:43.390 --> 01:23:43.400 align:start position:0%
check on what that amount is because
 
01:23:45.750 --> 01:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
that was to go to housing as well right
 
01:23:47.669 --> 01:23:47.679 align:start position:0%
yeah my my recollection was that we had
 
01:23:49.750 --> 01:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
two one was for like 20 million and one
 
01:23:52.189 --> 01:23:52.199 align:start position:0%
was for 15 million but there was money
 
01:23:53.830 --> 01:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
that was appropriated for and this isn't
 
01:23:56.310 --> 01:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
even different yeah this is different I
 
01:23:58.870 --> 01:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
mean that's all correct yeah but Mr
 
01:24:02.790 --> 01:24:02.800 align:start position:0%
chair thank you um but it's not 5
 
01:24:04.270 --> 01:24:04.280 align:start position:0%
million anymore because they've already
 
01:24:07.189 --> 01:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
expended some for the Personnel you're
 
01:24:10.669 --> 01:24:10.679 align:start position:0%
right so if we took this action it would
 
01:24:13.550 --> 01:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
be up to the LBA to figure out what's
 
01:24:15.950 --> 01:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
likely to happen and put that in our
 
01:24:18.110 --> 01:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
Surplus State okay and then and also
 
01:24:21.110 --> 01:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
just to clarify this isn't 5 million a
 
01:24:22.669 --> 01:24:22.679 align:start position:0%
new appropriation right it's money
 
01:24:24.750 --> 01:24:24.760 align:start position:0%
that's already in the fund it's it's
 
01:24:26.910 --> 01:24:26.920 align:start position:0%
money that was appropriated in the
 
01:24:31.229 --> 01:24:31.239 align:start position:0%
current bium okay okay the current bium
 
01:24:34.629 --> 01:24:34.639 align:start position:0%
is short the revenues have not come in
 
01:24:41.430 --> 01:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
as as planned so so um this among many
 
01:24:43.669 --> 01:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
other items could be something that
 
01:24:45.950 --> 01:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
helps close that Gap okay representative
 
01:24:47.990 --> 01:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
evil I mean the only thing I would say
 
01:24:51.510 --> 01:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
is if there is a vote in favor of
 
01:24:55.030 --> 01:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
repealing this provision the real effect
 
01:24:57.030 --> 01:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
is that everybody just has got to get
 
01:24:59.750 --> 01:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
their act together and get to G and C by
 
01:25:03.189 --> 01:25:03.199 align:start position:0%
Jan June 30th of 2025 and then it'll be
 
01:25:05.830 --> 01:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
up to the executive counsel yes I mean
 
01:25:08.990 --> 01:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
so it's not like the money is going to
 
01:25:11.550 --> 01:25:11.560 align:start position:0%
disappear it's just that it has to be
 
01:25:15.030 --> 01:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
expended by the end of June yeah and and
 
01:25:17.910 --> 01:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
in fact I mean the the executive Council
 
01:25:19.990 --> 01:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
has the authority even if we left this
 
01:25:22.870 --> 01:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
in to just say no to all these things
 
01:25:26.109 --> 01:25:26.119 align:start position:0%
and you know so it's not
 
01:25:28.109 --> 01:25:28.119 align:start position:0%
it's not an end of the world kind of
 
01:25:30.149 --> 01:25:30.159 align:start position:0%
thing you know but but maybe we would
 
01:25:32.669 --> 01:25:32.679 align:start position:0%
signal to the executive Council that we
 
01:25:34.910 --> 01:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
think they might consider not approving
 
01:25:37.030 --> 01:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
these things right I mean that's I guess
 
01:25:38.790 --> 01:25:38.800 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
01:25:43.470 --> 01:25:43.480 align:start position:0%
um yeah if you read this we're changing
 
01:25:45.870 --> 01:25:45.880 align:start position:0%
the date that it's going to
 
01:25:49.590 --> 01:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
lapse that's what we need to
 
01:25:53.149 --> 01:25:53.159 align:start position:0%
remove right so that that right so if we
 
01:25:55.990 --> 01:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
if we if we just let it
 
01:26:00.310 --> 01:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:03.709 --> 01:26:03.719 align:start position:0%
so exactly right if we remove section 72
 
01:26:06.990 --> 01:26:07.000 align:start position:0%
and 73 then any money in this area would
 
01:26:09.470 --> 01:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
lapse at the end of the B yes the
 
01:26:11.510 --> 01:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
current B and that's what we needed to
 
01:26:15.229 --> 01:26:15.239 align:start position:0%
do because Miss yes I would agree with
 
01:26:18.669 --> 01:26:18.679 align:start position:0%
you all right so back to this Melissa I
 
01:26:19.990 --> 01:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make two clarifying
 
01:26:23.070 --> 01:26:23.080 align:start position:0%
points one um there was 10 million for
 
01:26:25.149 --> 01:26:25.159 align:start position:0%
invest New Hampshire and then there was
 
01:26:26.669 --> 01:26:26.679 align:start position:0%
this five million the house did have
 
01:26:27.830 --> 01:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
more but they dialed it back
 
01:26:29.189 --> 01:26:29.199 align:start position:0%
representative C Bry were talking about
 
01:26:31.510 --> 01:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
the 15 million Senate dialed it dialed
 
01:26:34.070 --> 01:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
that back so 10 million for invest New
 
01:26:36.550 --> 01:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire 5 million for this program I
 
01:26:38.990 --> 01:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
also forgot to put one point that there
 
01:26:42.030 --> 01:26:42.040 align:start position:0%
was also s sp45 that was incorporated in
 
01:26:45.590 --> 01:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
hb2 on the Senate side that gave 250,000
 
01:26:48.590 --> 01:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
for administrative costs so the 5
 
01:26:51.390 --> 01:26:51.400 align:start position:0%
million would still be available for
 
01:26:53.790 --> 01:26:53.800 align:start position:0%
grants that full amount that 250 would
 
01:26:57.629 --> 01:26:57.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:00.189 --> 01:27:00.199 align:start position:0%
112 is it wasn't there also money given
 
01:27:01.670 --> 01:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
to the New Hampshire Housing
 
01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:03.470 align:start position:0%
to the New Hampshire Housing
[Music]

01:27:03.470 --> 01:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:27:07.270 --> 01:27:07.280 align:start position:0%
Authority I thought that was another one
 
01:27:09.830 --> 01:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
anyway if your point is that there's
 
01:27:14.030 --> 01:27:14.040 align:start position:0%
money that's there I'm that part is true
 
01:27:16.350 --> 01:27:16.360 align:start position:0%
yeah I
 
01:27:20.350 --> 01:27:20.360 align:start position:0%
mean just in general unspent money from
 
01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
this current bium is like the easiest
 
01:27:25.550 --> 01:27:25.560 align:start position:0%
possible cut right it doesn't lay off
 
01:27:30.070 --> 01:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
somebody it doesn't you know so okay um
 
01:27:33.070 --> 01:27:33.080 align:start position:0%
are we ready to vote yeah make a I'll
 
01:27:37.390 --> 01:27:37.400 align:start position:0%
make a motion to um to remove the are we
 
01:27:39.310 --> 01:27:39.320 align:start position:0%
just going to remove the DAT sections 72
 
01:27:41.390 --> 01:27:41.400 align:start position:0%
and 73 yeah make a motion to remove
 
01:27:44.750 --> 01:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
those sections okay who's seconding
 
01:27:47.149 --> 01:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin seconds okay all
 
01:27:48.109 --> 01:27:48.119 align:start position:0%
those in
 
01:27:52.950 --> 01:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
favor okay what do we got four against
 
01:27:55.910 --> 01:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
four to three okay okay motion carries
 
01:27:58.790 --> 01:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
good all right now let's go to all right
 
01:28:00.270 --> 01:28:00.280 align:start position:0%
so those are
 
01:28:03.189 --> 01:28:03.199 align:start position:0%
done okay
 
01:28:08.870 --> 01:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
now planning so this is um sections 74
 
01:28:12.550 --> 01:28:12.560 align:start position:0%
to 77 and I wanted to ask the question
 
01:28:15.950 --> 01:28:15.960 align:start position:0%
how much money is in these sections if
 
01:28:19.310 --> 01:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
any are we allocating money are we
 
01:28:21.629 --> 01:28:21.639 align:start position:0%
moving money what's going on there there
 
01:28:24.790 --> 01:28:24.800 align:start position:0%
is no cost to these sections so so the
 
01:28:28.030 --> 01:28:28.040 align:start position:0%
this is just allowing sort of a reorg um
 
01:28:29.189 --> 01:28:29.199 align:start position:0%
for the division of planning and
 
01:28:31.390 --> 01:28:31.400 align:start position:0%
Community Development they already had
 
01:28:32.950 --> 01:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
someone in a position in another
 
01:28:35.109 --> 01:28:35.119 align:start position:0%
division they're moving them over so the
 
01:28:38.390 --> 01:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:40.470 align:start position:0%
 
changing

01:28:40.470 --> 01:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
changing
 
01:28:42.990 --> 01:28:43.000 align:start position:0%
oh no additional position representative
 
01:28:44.870 --> 01:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
EV I mean I just remember this
 
01:28:47.270 --> 01:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
discussion and they just thought for
 
01:28:50.149 --> 01:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
efficiencies within the agency they were
 
01:28:51.990 --> 01:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
I don't know if they were moving a
 
01:28:54.350 --> 01:28:54.360 align:start position:0%
office to a division or a division to a
 
01:28:56.550 --> 01:28:56.560 align:start position:0%
department or it was just sort of
 
01:28:58.669 --> 01:28:58.679 align:start position:0%
reorganizing things in a way that made
 
01:29:01.229 --> 01:29:01.239 align:start position:0%
more sense and I didn't recall that it
 
01:29:04.950 --> 01:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
had a financial hit to it it's just okay
 
01:29:09.550 --> 01:29:09.560 align:start position:0%
they think it's a efficiency move okay
 
01:29:12.669 --> 01:29:12.679 align:start position:0%
so I guess we can approve that does that
 
01:29:14.870 --> 01:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
sound yeah I mean is it is it just it's
 
01:29:17.189 --> 01:29:17.199 align:start position:0%
a non-financial I I believe it's
 
01:29:22.149 --> 01:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
sections 7 uh 4 through
 
01:29:26.270 --> 01:29:26.280 align:start position:0%
77 77 is is just a cleanup um it removes
 
01:29:27.910 --> 01:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
a reference to a job training program
 
01:29:30.550 --> 01:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
that no longer exists okay okay within
 
01:29:32.950 --> 01:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
the agency I'll make the motion to
 
01:29:36.550 --> 01:29:36.560 align:start position:0%
approve uh section 74 to
 
01:29:39.229 --> 01:29:39.239 align:start position:0%
77 or is
 
01:29:41.830 --> 01:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
767 7 it say
 
01:29:45.750 --> 01:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
74 you tell me I'll make the motion 74
 
01:29:48.510 --> 01:29:48.520 align:start position:0%
to 77 74 to
 
01:29:51.229 --> 01:29:51.239 align:start position:0%
77 okay okay all right so it's been
 
01:29:52.870 --> 01:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
moved by representative evil and second
 
01:29:55.149 --> 01:29:55.159 align:start position:0%
by representative rung to to keep
 
01:29:57.830 --> 01:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
sections 74 through
 
01:30:02.310 --> 01:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
77 all those in favor yes okay unanimous
 
01:30:06.430 --> 01:30:06.440 align:start position:0%
very good okay 74 through
 
01:30:09.990 --> 01:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
77 we got that I mean that's not to say
 
01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:10.830 align:start position:0%
77 we got that I mean that's not to say
we

01:30:10.830 --> 01:30:10.840 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:30:13.830 --> 01:30:13.840 align:start position:0%
don't make changes in house bill one to
 
01:30:15.990 --> 01:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
to the planning department for example
 
01:30:19.229 --> 01:30:19.239 align:start position:0%
yes okay feeling that was on right so
 
01:30:21.390 --> 01:30:21.400 align:start position:0%
now we have
 
01:30:24.870 --> 01:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
78 uh Workforce Development Innovation
 
01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
fund that's the one I just spoke to
 
01:30:29.070 --> 01:30:29.080 align:start position:0%
sorry I referen the wrong section that
 
01:30:30.669 --> 01:30:30.679 align:start position:0%
one it just removes a reference to a job
 
01:30:32.470 --> 01:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
training program that no longer exists
 
01:30:34.350 --> 01:30:34.360 align:start position:0%
within the right it looked like some
 
01:30:38.430 --> 01:30:38.440 align:start position:0%
renaming kind of stuff just
 
01:30:43.870 --> 01:30:43.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:48.830 --> 01:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll move that we approve 78 and 79
 
01:30:52.830 --> 01:30:52.840 align:start position:0%
okay let let me let me read 79 just for
 
01:30:55.669 --> 01:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
Grants here
 
01:30:58.390 --> 01:30:58.400 align:start position:0%
um inserting because this is a new
 
01:30:58.400 --> 01:31:00.990 align:start position:0%
um inserting because this is a new
section

01:31:00.990 --> 01:31:01.000 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:31:04.109 --> 01:31:04.119 align:start position:0%
right is
 
01:31:06.669 --> 01:31:06.679 align:start position:0%
it um
 
01:31:09.310 --> 01:31:09.320 align:start position:0%
yeah 79 is on page
 
01:31:12.550 --> 01:31:12.560 align:start position:0%
46 so it's putting in this new
 
01:31:16.270 --> 01:31:16.280 align:start position:0%
section oh that does does it have
 
01:31:19.629 --> 01:31:19.639 align:start position:0%
money can I just change my motion to 78
 
01:31:22.149 --> 01:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
and then we can talk about 79 all right
 
01:31:24.070 --> 01:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
so representative evil moves and
 
01:31:27.709 --> 01:31:27.719 align:start position:0%
represent rung seconds to keep section
 
01:31:31.189 --> 01:31:31.199 align:start position:0%
78 okay all right all those in
 
01:31:39.830 --> 01:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:43.750 --> 01:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
79 yeah I read it and it looked
 
01:31:46.149 --> 01:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
generally okay to me but I I'm going to
 
01:32:01.950 --> 01:32:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:03.709 --> 01:32:03.719 align:start position:0%
okay so this seems to just give governor
 
01:32:06.870 --> 01:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
and Council a little more input on these
 
01:32:08.550 --> 01:32:08.560 align:start position:0%
grants yeah right because they're
 
01:32:10.070 --> 01:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
already making the grants and they
 
01:32:12.790 --> 01:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
already there's no new money to this I
 
01:32:15.229 --> 01:32:15.239 align:start position:0%
don't think I don't think so either we
 
01:32:18.709 --> 01:32:18.719 align:start position:0%
okay with that okay changing
 
01:32:22.350 --> 01:32:22.360 align:start position:0%
ter terms of
 
01:32:28.350 --> 01:32:28.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:33.189 --> 01:32:33.199 align:start position:0%
78 okay yeah I mean I 79 I'm sorry s SE
 
01:32:35.030 --> 01:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
I don't think there's money to this I'm
 
01:32:37.229 --> 01:32:37.239 align:start position:0%
looking at the um our LBA friends
 
01:32:39.590 --> 01:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
there's no money new money or anything
 
01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:40.310 align:start position:0%
there's no money new money or anything
on

01:32:40.310 --> 01:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:32:43.229 --> 01:32:43.239 align:start position:0%
this no okay so all right I'll make the
 
01:32:46.510 --> 01:32:46.520 align:start position:0%
motion to approve section 79 okay I'll
 
01:32:48.270 --> 01:32:48.280 align:start position:0%
second the motion all right so
 
01:32:49.709 --> 01:32:49.719 align:start position:0%
representative evil moves and
 
01:32:53.430 --> 01:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
representative cell second to um keep
 
01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:55.149 align:start position:0%
representative cell second to um keep
section

01:32:55.149 --> 01:32:55.159 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:32:58.189 --> 01:32:58.199 align:start position:0%
79 um all those in
 
01:33:02.550 --> 01:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
favor okay good all right
 
01:33:05.229 --> 01:33:05.239 align:start position:0%
now this is just membership
 
01:33:10.229 --> 01:33:10.239 align:start position:0%
terms section uh 80 yeah but I was
 
01:33:11.350 --> 01:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
thinking of getting rid of this
 
01:33:12.629 --> 01:33:12.639 align:start position:0%
Commission on
 
01:33:15.590 --> 01:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
Aging well can we just approve there I
 
01:33:17.430 --> 01:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
mean why don't we just do this and then
 
01:33:20.470 --> 01:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
you can then later maybe undo you can do
 
01:33:24.310 --> 01:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
what you want okay well not exactly not
 
01:33:26.149 --> 01:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
exactly I'll make a motion to approve
 
01:33:28.149 --> 01:33:28.159 align:start position:0%
section 80 all
 
01:33:31.310 --> 01:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
right all right representative eil moves
 
01:33:33.430 --> 01:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
and represent rung
 
01:33:37.990 --> 01:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
sections moves to uh retain section 80
 
01:33:41.510 --> 01:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
subject to possible change later um all
 
01:33:45.430 --> 01:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
those in favor yes okay unanimous good
 
01:33:46.950 --> 01:33:46.960 align:start position:0%
yeah because there's nothing there's not
 
01:33:51.910 --> 01:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
money there okay okay 82 all right now
 
01:33:54.669 --> 01:33:54.679 align:start position:0%
this is just allowing them what other
 
01:33:59.310 --> 01:33:59.320 align:start position:0%
people do so this one I wanted to maybe
 
01:34:02.669 --> 01:34:02.679 align:start position:0%
um finesse okay so where is
 
01:34:07.709 --> 01:34:07.719 align:start position:0%
this 82 82 the next page okay um by the
 
01:34:11.070 --> 01:34:11.080 align:start position:0%
way did we tell division two to to
 
01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:12.830 align:start position:0%
way did we tell division two to to
remove

01:34:12.830 --> 01:34:12.840 align:start position:0%
remove
 
01:34:16.629 --> 01:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
81 are they are they aware of that so
 
01:34:20.590 --> 01:34:20.600 align:start position:0%
section 81 is the same as House Bill
 
01:34:26.550 --> 01:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
193 so um or similar too so I have a
 
01:34:29.229 --> 01:34:29.239 align:start position:0%
feeling that house it's not needed in
 
01:34:30.990 --> 01:34:31.000 align:start position:0%
house build too yeah I'm sure Mickey's
 
01:34:33.109 --> 01:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
tracking that but I'll let him know he's
 
01:34:34.430 --> 01:34:34.440 align:start position:0%
been following the Comm make sure he
 
01:34:36.910 --> 01:34:36.920 align:start position:0%
knows about House Bill 193 so because it
 
01:34:39.510 --> 01:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
may not come to finance because it's
 
01:34:42.109 --> 01:34:42.119 align:start position:0%
it's not a money thing
 
01:34:45.149 --> 01:34:45.159 align:start position:0%
so they may want to take that out okay
 
01:34:48.510 --> 01:34:48.520 align:start position:0%
thank you all right section 82
 
01:34:52.229 --> 01:34:52.239 align:start position:0%
so what this says is that this is
 
01:34:54.830 --> 01:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
basically the thing that Ena Ables them
 
01:34:57.910 --> 01:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
to not what they did in their budget and
 
01:35:00.550 --> 01:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not thrilled with it and we may
 
01:35:02.990 --> 01:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
probably make changes is that they they
 
01:35:08.030 --> 01:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
didn't budget any overtime even though
 
01:35:10.390 --> 01:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh almost all the correctional officers
 
01:35:14.310 --> 01:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
are working serious overtime like like
 
01:35:16.270 --> 01:35:16.280 align:start position:0%
they have five regular shifts a week and
 
01:35:17.870 --> 01:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
three overtime shifts a week or
 
01:35:20.189 --> 01:35:20.199 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
01:35:24.510 --> 01:35:24.520 align:start position:0%
so so but instead they they
 
01:35:28.350 --> 01:35:28.360 align:start position:0%
um budgeted many unfunded correctional
 
01:35:31.229 --> 01:35:31.239 align:start position:0%
officer positions right and so what this
 
01:35:34.669 --> 01:35:34.679 align:start position:0%
says is you can take the salary money
 
01:35:36.590 --> 01:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
and the benefits money and all that
 
01:35:39.109 --> 01:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
stuff and move it into overtime you can
 
01:35:42.189 --> 01:35:42.199 align:start position:0%
shift shift money around what I'm
 
01:35:48.709 --> 01:35:48.719 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable with about this is that it
 
01:35:51.109 --> 01:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
allows movement
 
01:35:53.910 --> 01:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
among different types of employees
 
01:35:58.070 --> 01:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
employes right so so we we want to
 
01:35:59.870 --> 01:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
budget a certain amount of money for
 
01:36:03.030 --> 01:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
correctional officers right and some
 
01:36:06.229 --> 01:36:06.239 align:start position:0%
other amount of money for secretaries or
 
01:36:11.189 --> 01:36:11.199 align:start position:0%
cooks or you know whatever else and this
 
01:36:14.750 --> 01:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
might allow movement of money from the
 
01:36:18.629 --> 01:36:18.639 align:start position:0%
correctional officer salary position not
 
01:36:20.950 --> 01:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
to overtime of other correctional
 
01:36:24.350 --> 01:36:24.360 align:start position:0%
officers but over to the Cook and the
 
01:36:27.229 --> 01:36:27.239 align:start position:0%
secretaries and and the other things and
 
01:36:31.629 --> 01:36:31.639 align:start position:0%
so that what makes me uncomfortable
 
01:36:35.590 --> 01:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
here um and so I was thinking
 
01:36:38.470 --> 01:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
possibly making it
 
01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:40.149 align:start position:0%
possibly making it
within

01:36:40.149 --> 01:36:40.159 align:start position:0%
within
 
01:36:43.149 --> 01:36:43.159 align:start position:0%
um similar jobs right
 
01:36:46.030 --> 01:36:46.040 align:start position:0%
somehow within the same job you could do
 
01:36:48.629 --> 01:36:48.639 align:start position:0%
this anyways representive camroll thank
 
01:36:51.109 --> 01:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I see what you're saying
 
01:36:54.510 --> 01:36:54.520 align:start position:0%
but based on the fact that the majority
 
01:36:56.229 --> 01:36:56.239 align:start position:0%
of the openings over there are for
 
01:36:58.430 --> 01:36:58.440 align:start position:0%
correctional officers and that the
 
01:37:00.310 --> 01:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
majority of the overtime being worked is
 
01:37:02.750 --> 01:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
by the correctional officers as opposed
 
01:37:06.109 --> 01:37:06.119 align:start position:0%
to Cooks and cleaners I I don't see a
 
01:37:08.629 --> 01:37:08.639 align:start position:0%
lot of that happening so I I recognize
 
01:37:12.189 --> 01:37:12.199 align:start position:0%
your point but I don't see that and um
 
01:37:13.470 --> 01:37:13.480 align:start position:0%
this is the way they've been operating
 
01:37:14.990 --> 01:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
for the last few years where it gives
 
01:37:18.109 --> 01:37:18.119 align:start position:0%
the warden the maximum flexibility to
 
01:37:20.070 --> 01:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
both be able to hire and fill positions
 
01:37:22.750 --> 01:37:22.760 align:start position:0%
when the opportunity occurs and also to
 
01:37:25.189 --> 01:37:25.199 align:start position:0%
be able to keep the place staffed with
 
01:37:29.629 --> 01:37:29.639 align:start position:0%
overtime so I wouldn't mess with it okay
 
01:37:32.750 --> 01:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
anybody else representative R um I agree
 
01:37:35.830 --> 01:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
with representative Camas I also um I
 
01:37:37.550 --> 01:37:37.560 align:start position:0%
have a question though but doesn't it
 
01:37:39.709 --> 01:37:39.719 align:start position:0%
work the other way around too so if
 
01:37:42.629 --> 01:37:42.639 align:start position:0%
there's uh funding and secretaries and
 
01:37:44.350 --> 01:37:44.360 align:start position:0%
cooks and stuff they can and that's not
 
01:37:46.149 --> 01:37:46.159 align:start position:0%
being used they can use that for
 
01:37:51.070 --> 01:37:51.080 align:start position:0%
overtime yeah okay yeah um okay yeah we
 
01:37:53.510 --> 01:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
we'll we're going to do things with this
 
01:37:56.310 --> 01:37:56.320 align:start position:0%
Department I think but um when we get to
 
01:38:01.430 --> 01:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
House Bill one so yeah so um okay I
 
01:38:03.629 --> 01:38:03.639 align:start position:0%
mean you guys are probably right that
 
01:38:05.589 --> 01:38:05.599 align:start position:0%
it's not the end of the world
 
01:38:08.629 --> 01:38:08.639 align:start position:0%
representative muts I'm I'm I'm gonna
 
01:38:11.709 --> 01:38:11.719 align:start position:0%
I'm going to pile on and um agree with
 
01:38:14.470 --> 01:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
representative C and uh representative
 
01:38:17.510 --> 01:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
rung I think in a in a in a period when
 
01:38:19.629 --> 01:38:19.639 align:start position:0%
um you know Staffing is such an issue I
 
01:38:21.390 --> 01:38:21.400 align:start position:0%
think providing the maximum amount of
 
01:38:24.990 --> 01:38:25.000 align:start position:0%
operational flexibility is important
 
01:38:28.390 --> 01:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
okay all right so uh representative
 
01:38:31.070 --> 01:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
cell's moves and and representative M
 
01:38:35.990 --> 01:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
seconds that we retain that we accept um
 
01:38:41.709 --> 01:38:41.719 align:start position:0%
section 82 of House Bill 2 okay and uh
 
01:38:43.070 --> 01:38:43.080 align:start position:0%
all those in
 
01:38:47.629 --> 01:38:47.639 align:start position:0%
favor okay I'll be against okay so fine
 
01:38:52.109 --> 01:38:52.119 align:start position:0%
we we accept that one okay
 
01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:54.770 align:start position:0%
good all right all right
 
01:38:54.770 --> 01:38:56.189 align:start position:0%
good all right all right
[Music]

01:38:56.189 --> 01:38:56.199 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:39:00.070 --> 01:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
um yeah now section
 
01:39:03.430 --> 01:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
83 um I'm wondering if there's money
 
01:39:05.070 --> 01:39:05.080 align:start position:0%
here in
 
01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:06.669 align:start position:0%
here in
that

01:39:06.669 --> 01:39:06.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:39:09.790 --> 01:39:09.800 align:start position:0%
um we're CH giving people is there any
 
01:39:12.629 --> 01:39:12.639 align:start position:0%
raises or something in doing
 
01:39:15.350 --> 01:39:15.360 align:start position:0%
this because it says compensation so
 
01:39:18.830 --> 01:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:21.350 --> 01:39:21.360 align:start position:0%
that no I think this is just clean up
 
01:39:25.950 --> 01:39:25.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:28.709 --> 01:39:28.719 align:start position:0%
okay all right so somebody want on to
 
01:39:31.350 --> 01:39:31.360 align:start position:0%
move to keep it all right represent rung
 
01:39:34.790 --> 01:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
moves that we uh accept uh section 83
 
01:39:37.470 --> 01:39:37.480 align:start position:0%
representative evil seconds all those in
 
01:39:43.990 --> 01:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:45.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:39:45.750 --> 01:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:39:49.350 --> 01:39:49.360 align:start position:0%
um uh prison
 
01:39:52.669 --> 01:39:52.679 align:start position:0%
Industries okay this is another cleanup
 
01:39:55.669 --> 01:39:55.679 align:start position:0%
section with no cost um well not quite
 
01:39:58.870 --> 01:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
CU what it's saying is and and if you
 
01:40:00.950 --> 01:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
looked at the uh House Bill one I think
 
01:40:02.990 --> 01:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
you would see this is that they're
 
01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:04.310 align:start position:0%
you would see this is that they're
moving

01:40:04.310 --> 01:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
moving
 
01:40:08.470 --> 01:40:08.480 align:start position:0%
the um the cost of the employees in this
 
01:40:12.790 --> 01:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
area to the funds received from prison
 
01:40:15.109 --> 01:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
Industries right as opposed to from the
 
01:40:19.149 --> 01:40:19.159 align:start position:0%
general fund so um CU it because it it
 
01:40:21.510 --> 01:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
says it's taking out except for and
 
01:40:24.870 --> 01:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
putting in all right right so those
 
01:40:27.830 --> 01:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
permanent Personnel are now going to be
 
01:40:31.030 --> 01:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
paid for out of this account okay I'm
 
01:40:34.629 --> 01:40:34.639 align:start position:0%
okay with it assuming they are but um it
 
01:40:36.470 --> 01:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
is a
 
01:40:40.589 --> 01:40:40.599 align:start position:0%
change it is a money thing okay are we
 
01:40:44.870 --> 01:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
happy with that yeah any think they're
 
01:40:47.030 --> 01:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
trying to save money yeah right but
 
01:40:50.030 --> 01:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
aren't Mr chair aren't like the
 
01:40:52.350 --> 01:40:52.360 align:start position:0%
Personnel all that isn't that charge to
 
01:40:54.870 --> 01:40:54.880 align:start position:0%
that account cuz I'm looking at line 34
 
01:40:56.390 --> 01:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
it says charges for the sale of goods
 
01:40:58.790 --> 01:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
and services produced by the industry's
 
01:41:01.109 --> 01:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
program shall be sufficient to defay the
 
01:41:03.149 --> 01:41:03.159 align:start position:0%
expenditures charged against this
 
01:41:04.870 --> 01:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
account so it seems like everything
 
01:41:07.830 --> 01:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
charged against that account would have
 
01:41:11.790 --> 01:41:11.800 align:start position:0%
to be provided by the sale Revenue right
 
01:41:14.709 --> 01:41:14.719 align:start position:0%
but look at look at line 31 so the key
 
01:41:17.990 --> 01:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
thing is we're changing except for to
 
01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:19.550 align:start position:0%
thing is we're changing except for to
all

01:41:19.550 --> 01:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:41:23.589 --> 01:41:23.599 align:start position:0%
okay okay so right now it says except
 
01:41:26.430 --> 01:41:26.440 align:start position:0%
for permanent Personnel all operating
 
01:41:28.669 --> 01:41:28.679 align:start position:0%
expenses da da da is charged to this
 
01:41:30.790 --> 01:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
account okay so now so now we're going
 
01:41:32.830 --> 01:41:32.840 align:start position:0%
to charge all permanent Personnel
 
01:41:34.629 --> 01:41:34.639 align:start position:0%
operating expenses all these other
 
01:41:36.589 --> 01:41:36.599 align:start position:0%
things so we're adding permanent
 
01:41:39.109 --> 01:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
Personnel to this account okay do you
 
01:41:41.070 --> 01:41:41.080 align:start position:0%
see what I mean but but those expenses
 
01:41:43.070 --> 01:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
have to be covered Anyway by the Sal the
 
01:41:45.189 --> 01:41:45.199 align:start position:0%
expenses aren't changing right right
 
01:41:47.430 --> 01:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
they're already part of this account and
 
01:41:52.470 --> 01:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
so on it's the Personnel costs and so I
 
01:41:54.750 --> 01:41:54.760 align:start position:0%
question them whether this account has
 
01:41:57.390 --> 01:41:57.400 align:start position:0%
enough money to cover those Personnel
 
01:42:00.510 --> 01:42:00.520 align:start position:0%
they said yes so yeah you know but yeah
 
01:42:02.149 --> 01:42:02.159 align:start position:0%
it's a great store if you ever it's a
 
01:42:04.910 --> 01:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
great I love going there I do too
 
01:42:08.189 --> 01:42:08.199 align:start position:0%
yeah okay all right yeah so
 
01:42:10.709 --> 01:42:10.719 align:start position:0%
so representative rang will move to
 
01:42:12.790 --> 01:42:12.800 align:start position:0%

01:42:50.270 --> 01:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
oh I'm wondering about that because in
 
01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:53.470 align:start position:0%
oh I'm wondering about that because in
section

01:42:53.470 --> 01:42:53.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:55.669 --> 01:42:55.679 align:start position:0%
we're moving some people into
 
01:42:59.709 --> 01:42:59.719 align:start position:0%
hh's right from ggs or no it's only
 
01:43:01.470 --> 01:43:01.480 align:start position:0%
adding in business relationship
 
01:43:03.030 --> 01:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
management division so it's just
 
01:43:05.870 --> 01:43:05.880 align:start position:0%
clarifying by division so that person is
 
01:43:08.310 --> 01:43:08.320 align:start position:0%
already in HH that person's already in
 
01:43:10.830 --> 01:43:10.840 align:start position:0%
HH yeah and the other one's already in
 
01:43:13.950 --> 01:43:13.960 align:start position:0%
HH the other one's already GG and other
 
01:43:18.629 --> 01:43:18.639 align:start position:0%
is HH yeah yeah um because I'm wondering
 
01:43:24.229 --> 01:43:24.239 align:start position:0%
why is it that this particular division
 
01:43:26.950 --> 01:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
um their director is an HH when somebody
 
01:43:30.709 --> 01:43:30.719 align:start position:0%
else is is a is a GG do we know are is
 
01:43:33.390 --> 01:43:33.400 align:start position:0%
this more important somehow or I do not
 
01:43:34.709 --> 01:43:34.719 align:start position:0%
know off the St in my head but I can
 
01:43:38.109 --> 01:43:38.119 align:start position:0%
find that out yeah maybe maybe there's
 
01:43:40.430 --> 01:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
no real change we should just approve
 
01:43:44.510 --> 01:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
this yeah Mr chair represent run um I
 
01:43:47.750 --> 01:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
have a rookie question so is GG and
 
01:43:53.189 --> 01:43:53.199 align:start position:0%
HH um salary grades yes okay for for um
 
01:43:55.229 --> 01:43:55.239 align:start position:0%
unclassified I believe right yeah these
 
01:43:57.629 --> 01:43:57.639 align:start position:0%
are for unclassified workers so so these
 
01:44:00.270 --> 01:44:00.280 align:start position:0%
are the managers of these divisions and
 
01:44:03.189 --> 01:44:03.199 align:start position:0%
HHS are paid a little more than ggs
 
01:44:03.199 --> 01:44:05.589 align:start position:0%
HHS are paid a little more than ggs
basically

01:44:05.589 --> 01:44:05.599 align:start position:0%
basically
 
01:44:09.550 --> 01:44:09.560 align:start position:0%
so okay all right all right so we we
 
01:44:12.070 --> 01:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
happy with this yeah motion to accept
 
01:44:14.750 --> 01:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
okay all right so representative cell's
 
01:44:17.910 --> 01:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
moves and representative rung seconds uh
 
01:44:19.629 --> 01:44:19.639 align:start position:0%
that we accept Section
 
01:44:21.870 --> 01:44:21.880 align:start position:0%
113 all those in
 
01:44:23.629 --> 01:44:23.639 align:start position:0%
favor okay
 
01:44:27.149 --> 01:44:27.159 align:start position:0%
okay good unanimous
 
01:44:29.270 --> 01:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
good all
 
01:44:32.950 --> 01:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
right um now we have a bunch of
 
01:44:34.830 --> 01:44:34.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice things and I'd
 
01:44:37.350 --> 01:44:37.360 align:start position:0%
kind of like somebody to come and talk
 
01:44:39.070 --> 01:44:39.080 align:start position:0%
to us about this because there's a whole
 
01:44:40.109 --> 01:44:40.119 align:start position:0%
bunch of
 
01:44:43.510 --> 01:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
these um I've reached out they did
 
01:44:44.830 --> 01:44:44.840 align:start position:0%
respond so I think they'll probably be
 
01:44:46.910 --> 01:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
able to be here tomorrow is the Hope
 
01:44:48.910 --> 01:44:48.920 align:start position:0%
okay going to hold those till tomorrow
 
01:44:50.910 --> 01:44:50.920 align:start position:0%
okay and I'm wondering by the way
 
01:44:55.470 --> 01:44:55.480 align:start position:0%
Melissa on line 34 four this page 52 it
 
01:44:57.350 --> 01:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
looks to me like there's a
 
01:45:01.750 --> 01:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
typo um I kind of think that this a
 
01:45:05.030 --> 01:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
civil rights unit should be section
 
01:45:08.430 --> 01:45:08.440 align:start position:0%
D or you know should be a new
 
01:45:11.709 --> 01:45:11.719 align:start position:0%
section right because this is a list of
 
01:45:13.830 --> 01:45:13.840 align:start position:0%
things that the division of legal
 
01:45:18.589 --> 01:45:18.599 align:start position:0%
council has and a civil rights unit is
 
01:45:20.390 --> 01:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
one of those things on the list if you
 
01:45:22.390 --> 01:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
see what I mean see what you're saying
 
01:45:25.790 --> 01:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
yeah yes so go talk to the drafter that
 
01:45:27.390 --> 01:45:27.400 align:start position:0%
unfortunately there already is a d and
 
01:45:30.550 --> 01:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
an e right so so I think there needs to
 
01:45:32.910 --> 01:45:32.920 align:start position:0%
be an F basically I see what you're
 
01:45:35.910 --> 01:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
saying yeah okay all right but when when
 
01:45:37.709 --> 01:45:37.719 align:start position:0%
we see them we'll maybe have an
 
01:45:40.910 --> 01:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
amendment for that okay so now that
 
01:45:41.940 --> 01:45:41.950 align:start position:0%
takes us
 
01:45:41.950 --> 01:45:44.750 align:start position:0%
takes us
[Music]

01:45:44.750 --> 01:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:45:49.510 --> 01:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
through um maybe now back to section 124
 
01:45:51.629 --> 01:45:51.639 align:start position:0%
on page
 
01:46:08.270 --> 01:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:12.030 --> 01:46:12.040 align:start position:0%
thing so this is an exception to
 
01:46:14.830 --> 01:46:14.840 align:start position:0%
91a um that
 
01:46:17.750 --> 01:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
says uh you can keep confidential
 
01:46:20.109 --> 01:46:20.119 align:start position:0%
records held by the executive branch
 
01:46:24.270 --> 01:46:24.280 align:start position:0%
under seal in conf in a court file
 
01:46:27.990 --> 01:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
or in a confidential court file so that
 
01:46:31.589 --> 01:46:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:31.599 --> 01:46:33.589 align:start position:0%
 
me

01:46:33.589 --> 01:46:33.599 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:46:44.070 --> 01:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:44.080 --> 01:46:47.270 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:46:47.270 --> 01:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:50.510 --> 01:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
okay so 91a has whole bunch of
 
01:46:53.270 --> 01:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
exceptions right of things you don't
 
01:46:54.870 --> 01:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
have to
 
01:46:58.870 --> 01:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
disclose and so under seal court stuff
 
01:47:00.830 --> 01:47:00.840 align:start position:0%
sounds like things that shouldn't be
 
01:47:03.750 --> 01:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
disclosed I have I have a real problem
 
01:47:07.390 --> 01:47:07.400 align:start position:0%
with weakening anything in 91a okay I
 
01:47:10.270 --> 01:47:10.280 align:start position:0%
would like to strengthen it and get more
 
01:47:13.109 --> 01:47:13.119 align:start position:0%
of the exceptions out of there okay
 
01:47:14.910 --> 01:47:14.920 align:start position:0%
rather than add them so you want to wait
 
01:47:16.990 --> 01:47:17.000 align:start position:0%
and ask the Department of Justice about
 
01:47:20.510 --> 01:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
this one yeah okay all right well we can
 
01:47:22.650 --> 01:47:22.660 align:start position:0%
do that yes
 
01:47:22.660 --> 01:47:24.990 align:start position:0%
do that yes
[Music]

01:47:24.990 --> 01:47:25.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:47:29.270 --> 01:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:33.030 --> 01:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
91a um or the process for getting
 
01:47:34.310 --> 01:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
something under
 
01:47:37.750 --> 01:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
seal probably not right but I mean you
 
01:47:39.030 --> 01:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
would you would think they would have to
 
01:47:41.589 --> 01:47:41.599 align:start position:0%
add a definition if they if that was the
 
01:47:45.310 --> 01:47:45.320 align:start position:0%
case but yeah I guess my my my thought
 
01:47:46.950 --> 01:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
on that as well was who determines
 
01:47:48.790 --> 01:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
whether it goes under
 
01:47:52.109 --> 01:47:52.119 align:start position:0%
seal I would assume the judge but I
 
01:47:53.629 --> 01:47:53.639 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
01:47:56.229 --> 01:47:56.239 align:start position:0%
yeah all right we we we'll ask more
 
01:48:00.750 --> 01:48:00.760 align:start position:0%
about that okay very good so let's next
 
01:48:04.030 --> 01:48:04.040 align:start position:0%
is where are we I guess we're still in
 
01:48:06.390 --> 01:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
attorney general stuff
 
01:48:09.709 --> 01:48:09.719 align:start position:0%
right 12 section
 
01:48:13.870 --> 01:48:13.880 align:start position:0%
125 yeah so this is oh now we're in um
 
01:48:17.189 --> 01:48:17.199 align:start position:0%
judicial council is that what we
 
01:48:17.199 --> 01:48:19.510 align:start position:0%
judicial council is that what we
are

01:48:19.510 --> 01:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:48:23.189 --> 01:48:23.199 align:start position:0%
right um
 
01:48:24.510 --> 01:48:24.520 align:start position:0%
do we know what the change is there
 
01:48:26.070 --> 01:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
money in this
 
01:48:29.790 --> 01:48:29.800 align:start position:0%
change are we because I I looked at this
 
01:48:33.310 --> 01:48:33.320 align:start position:0%
section and and the $1,500 seemed to me
 
01:48:36.470 --> 01:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
it was like $300
 
01:48:36.480 --> 01:48:37.990 align:start position:0%
it was like $300
currently

01:48:37.990 --> 01:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:48:40.070 --> 01:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
um yeah I don't know a whole lot about
 
01:48:41.790 --> 01:48:41.800 align:start position:0%
this section I can get some more
 
01:48:44.310 --> 01:48:44.320 align:start position:0%
information on this one all right thank
 
01:48:47.030 --> 01:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
you yeah so then so now we have a whole
 
01:48:50.589 --> 01:48:50.599 align:start position:0%
bunch of judicial Council type sections
 
01:48:53.350 --> 01:48:53.360 align:start position:0%
here um
 
01:48:55.350 --> 01:48:55.360 align:start position:0%
and I don't remember them talking about
 
01:48:56.950 --> 01:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
their yeah I looked in their
 
01:48:58.189 --> 01:48:58.199 align:start position:0%
presentation it was in there and they
 
01:48:59.750 --> 01:48:59.760 align:start position:0%

01:49:03.430 --> 01:49:03.440 align:start position:0%

judicial now
 
01:49:23.350 --> 01:49:23.360 align:start position:0%
um yes representive Griffin I think this
 
01:49:25.550 --> 01:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
is a I hate to
 
01:49:28.589 --> 01:49:28.599 align:start position:0%
keep eating the same old drum but this
 
01:49:30.510 --> 01:49:30.520 align:start position:0%
looks like it should be a separate build
 
01:49:30.520 --> 01:49:31.750 align:start position:0%
looks like it should be a separate build
of

01:49:31.750 --> 01:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:37.669 align:start position:0%
of
me

01:49:37.669 --> 01:49:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:40.270 --> 01:49:40.280 align:start position:0%
okay well it's
 
01:49:40.280 --> 01:49:43.910 align:start position:0%
okay well it's
repealing

01:49:43.910 --> 01:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:48.270 align:start position:0%
 
repealing

01:49:48.270 --> 01:49:48.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:53.350 --> 01:49:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:55.629 --> 01:49:55.639 align:start position:0%
right repealing an
 
01:49:59.030 --> 01:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
irsa and reenacting replacing replacing
 
01:50:03.430 --> 01:50:03.440 align:start position:0%
BEP bill I think yeah I don't know why
 
01:50:04.709 --> 01:50:04.719 align:start position:0%
it's tied
 
01:50:10.270 --> 01:50:10.280 align:start position:0%
to it's tied to to money yeah excuse me
 
01:50:12.910 --> 01:50:12.920 align:start position:0%
um representative Griffin are you on 128
 
01:50:16.310 --> 01:50:16.320 align:start position:0%
no 125 he's still talking about these
 
01:50:19.510 --> 01:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
sections right so we we'll get some
 
01:50:21.790 --> 01:50:21.800 align:start position:0%
right and it looks like on 126 for
 
01:50:23.350 --> 01:50:23.360 align:start position:0%
example we're add adding a bunch of
 
01:50:27.709 --> 01:50:27.719 align:start position:0%
things that we can pay for right
 
01:50:33.510 --> 01:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
so um and um 127 maybe we're paying
 
01:50:37.030 --> 01:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
people a little more so yeah
 
01:50:40.109 --> 01:50:40.119 align:start position:0%
so we'll get some answers to to these
 
01:50:43.950 --> 01:50:43.960 align:start position:0%
sections okay all right wage wage claim
 
01:50:46.589 --> 01:50:46.599 align:start position:0%
settlement account P 128 starts at the
 
01:50:48.470 --> 01:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
bottom of page
 
01:50:56.189 --> 01:50:56.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:59.950 --> 01:50:59.960 align:start position:0%
special administer this
 
01:51:02.589 --> 01:51:02.599 align:start position:0%
one okay
 
01:51:02.599 --> 01:51:05.830 align:start position:0%
one okay
so

01:51:05.830 --> 01:51:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:09.430 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:51:09.430 --> 01:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:12.149 --> 01:51:12.159 align:start position:0%
this this looks to me like it's it's
 
01:51:16.189 --> 01:51:16.199 align:start position:0%
reasonable because um we already
 
01:51:20.149 --> 01:51:20.159 align:start position:0%
have a law RSA
 
01:51:26.270 --> 01:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
275 colon 53 part too um
 
01:51:30.270 --> 01:51:30.280 align:start position:0%
which uh this is where somebody has a
 
01:51:32.669 --> 01:51:32.679 align:start position:0%
has a claim against you know their
 
01:51:34.390 --> 01:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
employer didn't pay them enough or
 
01:51:36.629 --> 01:51:36.639 align:start position:0%
something like that and and and it's
 
01:51:41.750 --> 01:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
getting adjudicated and so this is um to
 
01:51:45.430 --> 01:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
make a a a dedicated fund for that
 
01:51:48.390 --> 01:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
purpose right and and already they're
 
01:51:52.790 --> 01:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
collecting money and distributing it but
 
01:51:54.550 --> 01:51:54.560 align:start position:0%
but it seems like something that should
 
01:51:57.310 --> 01:51:57.320 align:start position:0%
be separate from other government
 
01:52:00.950 --> 01:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
accounts so it's a it's um creating this
 
01:52:03.950 --> 01:52:03.960 align:start position:0%
wage claim settlement account are the
 
01:52:06.189 --> 01:52:06.199 align:start position:0%
are these are these
 
01:52:09.790 --> 01:52:09.800 align:start position:0%
situations where a government employee
 
01:52:11.470 --> 01:52:11.480 align:start position:0%
is claiming they weren't paid or is it
 
01:52:13.990 --> 01:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
private I think it's for everybody so
 
01:52:17.030 --> 01:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
and and then I guess is it is it money
 
01:52:19.109 --> 01:52:19.119 align:start position:0%
that you know pending the resolution of
 
01:52:21.510 --> 01:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
the issue does the employer deposit the
 
01:52:24.830 --> 01:52:24.840 align:start position:0%
money in here so so that if it gets
 
01:52:27.069 --> 01:52:27.079 align:start position:0%
ruled yeah I think it's this is one of
 
01:52:29.589 --> 01:52:29.599 align:start position:0%
those I believe this is labor department
 
01:52:32.470 --> 01:52:32.480 align:start position:0%
right so it's
 
01:52:35.069 --> 01:52:35.079 align:start position:0%
where you know somebody makes a claim
 
01:52:36.830 --> 01:52:36.840 align:start position:0%
makes a complaint and the labor
 
01:52:39.430 --> 01:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
department adjudicates it and then they
 
01:52:41.550 --> 01:52:41.560 align:start position:0%
collect the money from the employer and
 
01:52:43.830 --> 01:52:43.840 align:start position:0%
they pass it off to the employee and
 
01:52:46.470 --> 01:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
maybe it takes some time you know so you
 
01:52:51.629 --> 01:52:51.639 align:start position:0%
know I I tend to think this is okay um
 
01:52:51.639 --> 01:52:53.069 align:start position:0%
know I I tend to think this is okay um
yeah

01:52:53.069 --> 01:52:53.079 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:52:56.550 --> 01:52:56.560 align:start position:0%
but we can let me look it up just to um
 
01:52:59.229 --> 01:52:59.239 align:start position:0%
and Mr chair I would it it should be
 
01:53:01.709 --> 01:53:01.719 align:start position:0%
Revenue neutral because the fund would
 
01:53:03.709 --> 01:53:03.719 align:start position:0%
disperse funds that would eventually be
 
01:53:06.390 --> 01:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
collected from the employer right okay
 
01:53:09.310 --> 01:53:09.320 align:start position:0%
right but that's correct this was a
 
01:53:12.109 --> 01:53:12.119 align:start position:0%
request by uh the Department of Labor to
 
01:53:13.990 --> 01:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
hold the funds they already do this
 
01:53:15.510 --> 01:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
process but it was just to carve out
 
01:53:17.069 --> 01:53:17.079 align:start position:0%
those funds and keep them into a
 
01:53:20.589 --> 01:53:20.599 align:start position:0%
dedicated account yeah it it helps their
 
01:53:22.950 --> 01:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
accounting I think yeah
 
01:53:28.589 --> 01:53:28.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:32.669 --> 01:53:32.679 align:start position:0%
129 I'll second it all right um so
 
01:53:34.310 --> 01:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
representative rung moves and
 
01:53:36.629 --> 01:53:36.639 align:start position:0%
representative camell seconds that we
 
01:53:40.510 --> 01:53:40.520 align:start position:0%
accept sections 128 and9 all those in
 
01:53:46.270 --> 01:53:46.280 align:start position:0%
favor yes okay good unanimous very good
 
01:53:50.910 --> 01:53:50.920 align:start position:0%
now 128 12 all right so these are okay
 
01:53:53.629 --> 01:53:53.639 align:start position:0%
now we're on
 
01:53:57.350 --> 01:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
um 130 to
 
01:53:57.360 --> 01:54:00.830 align:start position:0%
um 130 to
131

01:54:00.830 --> 01:54:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:00.840 --> 01:54:03.350 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:54:03.350 --> 01:54:03.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:06.350 --> 01:54:06.360 align:start position:0%
so it's not the same RSA I don't really
 
01:54:09.229 --> 01:54:09.239 align:start position:0%
know what yes so this is a different
 
01:54:12.069 --> 01:54:12.079 align:start position:0%
fund and I I'm guessing it's no longer
 
01:54:14.109 --> 01:54:14.119 align:start position:0%
in use right this
 
01:54:17.589 --> 01:54:17.599 align:start position:0%
is uh special fund for Active cases
 
01:54:19.350 --> 01:54:19.360 align:start position:0%
probably I can give you an update on
 
01:54:21.189 --> 01:54:21.199 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead okay so this account is no
 
01:54:23.310 --> 01:54:23.320 align:start position:0%
longer in used the lap last recipient
 
01:54:25.270 --> 01:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
who was pulling from this has account
 
01:54:27.270 --> 01:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
from this account has passed away so
 
01:54:28.990 --> 01:54:29.000 align:start position:0%
this fund is no longer
 
01:54:32.990 --> 01:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
needed yeah yeah this was some
 
01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:34.589 align:start position:0%
needed yeah yeah this was some
historical

01:54:34.589 --> 01:54:34.599 align:start position:0%
historical
 
01:54:38.470 --> 01:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
thing okay I'll I'll move that we accept
 
01:54:40.990 --> 01:54:41.000 align:start position:0%
13031 okay all right so it's moved by
 
01:54:42.709 --> 01:54:42.719 align:start position:0%
representative rung and seconded by
 
01:54:45.589 --> 01:54:45.599 align:start position:0%
representative Ms to accept sections 130
 
01:54:47.870 --> 01:54:47.880 align:start position:0%
and 131 all those in
 
01:54:52.990 --> 01:54:53.000 align:start position:0%
favor okay any oppos no Okay so here we
 
01:54:57.629 --> 01:54:57.639 align:start position:0%
go 13 131 we got that
 
01:55:05.830 --> 01:55:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:05.840 --> 01:55:12.870 align:start position:0%
 
132

01:55:12.870 --> 01:55:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:15.669 --> 01:55:15.679 align:start position:0%
um oh interesting all right so this just
 
01:55:17.510 --> 01:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
looks like a cleanup
 
01:55:26.709 --> 01:55:26.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:26.719 --> 01:55:29.910 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:55:29.910 --> 01:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:33.950 --> 01:55:33.960 align:start position:0%
um what's that I think it does expedite
 
01:55:37.310 --> 01:55:37.320 align:start position:0%
payment because it says five days that
 
01:55:39.189 --> 01:55:39.199 align:start position:0%
the payment will start five days after
 
01:55:41.830 --> 01:55:41.840 align:start position:0%
the decision is made as opposed to the
 
01:55:45.149 --> 01:55:45.159 align:start position:0%
decisions effective date I mean they
 
01:55:46.550 --> 01:55:46.560 align:start position:0%
decisions effective date could have been
 
01:55:50.550 --> 01:55:50.560 align:start position:0%
sometime in the future I suppose
 
01:55:54.229 --> 01:55:54.239 align:start position:0%
but um yeah
 
01:55:56.669 --> 01:55:56.679 align:start position:0%
I guess I don't really see real
 
01:56:00.750 --> 01:56:00.760 align:start position:0%
difference issue yeah but but I I would
 
01:56:02.350 --> 01:56:02.360 align:start position:0%
assume that they know what they're
 
01:56:06.069 --> 01:56:06.079 align:start position:0%
asking for here seems very minor I I'll
 
01:56:08.629 --> 01:56:08.639 align:start position:0%
move to accept it all right why don't we
 
01:56:10.310 --> 01:56:10.320 align:start position:0%
let's oh yeah that's different than the
 
01:56:12.069 --> 01:56:12.079 align:start position:0%
next one okay all right so
 
01:56:14.109 --> 01:56:14.119 align:start position:0%
representative Ms moves to accept
 
01:56:14.119 --> 01:56:15.270 align:start position:0%
representative Ms moves to accept
Section

01:56:15.270 --> 01:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
Section
 
01:56:18.470 --> 01:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
132 I'm second by representative rung do
 
01:56:21.270 --> 01:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
we know representative Griffin yeah do
 
01:56:23.470 --> 01:56:23.480 align:start position:0%
we know what the cost of this is going
 
01:56:23.480 --> 01:56:25.030 align:start position:0%
we know what the cost of this is going
to

01:56:25.030 --> 01:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:56:28.910 --> 01:56:28.920 align:start position:0%
be well it's it's not a a a state budget
 
01:56:33.629 --> 01:56:33.639 align:start position:0%
type of item right this is workers comp
 
01:56:36.030 --> 01:56:36.040 align:start position:0%
right and so the question is when does
 
01:56:38.990 --> 01:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
the employer we selfemployed
 
01:56:41.910 --> 01:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
aren't we self
 
01:56:45.629 --> 01:56:45.639 align:start position:0%
funded for workers comp for workman's
 
01:56:49.229 --> 01:56:49.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:49.239 --> 01:56:51.069 align:start position:0%
 
self-funded

01:56:51.069 --> 01:56:51.079 align:start position:0%
self-funded
 
01:56:53.830 --> 01:56:53.840 align:start position:0%
um yeah yes but there is no cost to this
 
01:56:55.510 --> 01:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
this is just moving the payment I'm
 
01:56:59.189 --> 01:56:59.199 align:start position:0%
pretty sure we s funded yeah if it
 
01:57:03.030 --> 01:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
relates to us and not not people outside
 
01:57:04.350 --> 01:57:04.360 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:57:07.950 --> 01:57:07.960 align:start position:0%
board outside of the
 
01:57:10.550 --> 01:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
state I'd like to know a little bit more
 
01:57:14.990 --> 01:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:18.310 --> 01:57:18.320 align:start position:0%
okay what information would you like
 
01:57:20.310 --> 01:57:20.320 align:start position:0%
because every this is just changing the
 
01:57:24.750 --> 01:57:24.760 align:start position:0%
payment to be we're still on a it I
 
01:57:27.069 --> 01:57:27.079 align:start position:0%
think it's just clarifying this is just
 
01:57:31.669 --> 01:57:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:31.679 --> 01:57:33.470 align:start position:0%
 
cuz

01:57:33.470 --> 01:57:33.480 align:start position:0%
cuz
 
01:57:36.589 --> 01:57:36.599 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:57:40.589 --> 01:57:40.599 align:start position:0%
date yeah the date of the decision right
 
01:57:43.910 --> 01:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
so it makes it clearer that that the
 
01:57:47.310 --> 01:57:47.320 align:start position:0%
date the decision comes out is the key
 
01:57:50.910 --> 01:57:50.920 align:start position:0%
date um and maybe there's some other
 
01:57:53.310 --> 01:57:53.320 align:start position:0%
places in law where effective date or
 
01:57:55.390 --> 01:57:55.400 align:start position:0%
some other date I don't know I think
 
01:57:57.030 --> 01:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
they wanted the actual documentation the
 
01:57:58.550 --> 01:57:58.560 align:start position:0%
issuance of the decision before the
 
01:58:00.390 --> 01:58:00.400 align:start position:0%
payment was
 
01:58:03.069 --> 01:58:03.079 align:start position:0%
made so it doesn't adjust how much
 
01:58:05.149 --> 01:58:05.159 align:start position:0%
payments are made where the payments are
 
01:58:07.790 --> 01:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
made from so I see what you're saying
 
01:58:10.950 --> 01:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
we're just changing what exists yeah
 
01:58:13.990 --> 01:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
yeah okay yeah I mean possibly it's
 
01:58:17.030 --> 01:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
later than rather than earlier yeah I
 
01:58:19.270 --> 01:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
think he answered my question okay good
 
01:58:23.149 --> 01:58:23.159 align:start position:0%
all right so uh
 
01:58:25.990 --> 01:58:26.000 align:start position:0%
so we're moving to we're still moving to
 
01:58:30.310 --> 01:58:30.320 align:start position:0%
accept um uh section 132 right are we
 
01:58:33.350 --> 01:58:33.360 align:start position:0%
ready to vote okay all those in favor
 
01:58:35.390 --> 01:58:35.400 align:start position:0%
yes somebody move and somebody second
 
01:58:38.709 --> 01:58:38.719 align:start position:0%
yes representative Ms and R Ms and rung
 
01:58:40.990 --> 01:58:41.000 align:start position:0%
okay all right so all right so we
 
01:58:42.790 --> 01:58:42.800 align:start position:0%
accepted section
 
01:58:45.629 --> 01:58:45.639 align:start position:0%
132 sounds a little sh so representative
 
01:58:48.510 --> 01:58:48.520 align:start position:0%
Sweeney we're now going through the
 
01:58:50.189 --> 01:58:50.199 align:start position:0%
house bill two and we're about to talk
 
01:58:52.390 --> 01:58:52.400 align:start position:0%
about Section 133
 
01:58:54.589 --> 01:58:54.599 align:start position:0%
on page
 
01:58:57.790 --> 01:58:57.800 align:start position:0%
58 okay uh representa McGuire do you
 
01:58:59.430 --> 01:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
want to give a little what's that do you
 
01:59:00.870 --> 01:59:00.880 align:start position:0%
want me to tell you what this one does
 
01:59:03.109 --> 01:59:03.119 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead okay so this one um the
 
01:59:04.350 --> 01:59:04.360 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor states that it's
 
01:59:07.030 --> 01:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
just ex um it's clarifying the existing
 
01:59:09.189 --> 01:59:09.199 align:start position:0%
existing composition of the compensation
 
01:59:12.189 --> 01:59:12.199 align:start position:0%
appeal board that includes 27 members so
 
01:59:13.910 --> 01:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
it's changing it to make up what the
 
01:59:16.589 --> 01:59:16.599 align:start position:0%
actual board is right now because they
 
01:59:19.189 --> 01:59:19.199 align:start position:0%
can't find the other other six members
 
01:59:19.199 --> 01:59:20.550 align:start position:0%
can't find the other other six members
is

01:59:20.550 --> 01:59:20.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:59:23.550 --> 01:59:23.560 align:start position:0%
that yeah okay okay nobody wants to be
 
01:59:27.069 --> 01:59:27.079 align:start position:0%
on this board okay well only 27 price
 
01:59:31.189 --> 01:59:31.199 align:start position:0%
money are quite PID are they paid yeah
 
01:59:33.270 --> 01:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
all right so this seems reasonable right
 
01:59:36.709 --> 01:59:36.719 align:start position:0%
yeah okay make a motion to accept
 
01:59:36.719 --> 01:59:38.430 align:start position:0%
yeah okay make a motion to accept
Section

01:59:38.430 --> 01:59:38.440 align:start position:0%
Section
 
01:59:42.390 --> 01:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
1333 all right second it second it by
 
01:59:43.629 --> 01:59:43.639 align:start position:0%
representative cell's moves
 
01:59:45.870 --> 01:59:45.880 align:start position:0%
representative run seconds that we
 
01:59:49.510 --> 01:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
accept Section 133 of House Bill 2 any
 
01:59:52.270 --> 01:59:52.280 align:start position:0%
discussion all those in favor
 
01:59:57.149 --> 01:59:57.159 align:start position:0%
okay unanimous good okay
 
02:00:01.350 --> 02:00:01.360 align:start position:0%
132 all right 133 good now we're on page
 
02:00:03.990 --> 02:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
three of our
 
02:00:10.430 --> 02:00:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:14.750 --> 02:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
134 same oh it's it's
 
02:00:16.629 --> 02:00:16.639 align:start position:0%
confidentiality all right so you want to
 
02:00:19.910 --> 02:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
ask why do they want this is that
 
02:00:22.589 --> 02:00:22.599 align:start position:0%
it so their response is this is their
 
02:00:24.510 --> 02:00:24.520 align:start position:0%
extending the existing work workers
 
02:00:26.270 --> 02:00:26.280 align:start position:0%
compensation claim confidentiality
 
02:00:28.950 --> 02:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
protection to records and perceiving of
 
02:00:31.149 --> 02:00:31.159 align:start position:0%
the compensation appeals board which are
 
02:00:36.510 --> 02:00:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:39.870 --> 02:00:39.880 align:start position:0%
covered so I
 
02:00:42.990 --> 02:00:43.000 align:start position:0%
guess the compensation appeals board is
 
02:00:44.910 --> 02:00:44.920 align:start position:0%
somehow separate from the Department of
 
02:00:48.270 --> 02:00:48.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:50.589 --> 02:00:50.599 align:start position:0%
idea I don't know the answer to that I
 
02:00:54.830 --> 02:00:54.840 align:start position:0%
can look because I I I would bet that
 
02:00:58.589 --> 02:00:58.599 align:start position:0%
whoever um put in this RSA in the first
 
02:01:01.709 --> 02:01:01.719 align:start position:0%
place kind of thought if they thought
 
02:01:03.629 --> 02:01:03.639 align:start position:0%
about the compensation appeals board
 
02:01:05.629 --> 02:01:05.639 align:start position:0%
that it was just you know one of the
 
02:01:07.669 --> 02:01:07.679 align:start position:0%
sections of the Department of Labor
 
02:01:07.679 --> 02:01:09.149 align:start position:0%
sections of the Department of Labor
right

02:01:09.149 --> 02:01:09.159 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:01:12.830 --> 02:01:12.840 align:start position:0%
so but maybe not it seems like it's a
 
02:01:15.310 --> 02:01:15.320 align:start position:0%
cleanup to me Mr chair that information
 
02:01:17.870 --> 02:01:17.880 align:start position:0%
that the Department of Labor has they're
 
02:01:20.310 --> 02:01:20.320 align:start position:0%
Bound by confidentiality rules but that
 
02:01:23.310 --> 02:01:23.320 align:start position:0%
same information may be shared with the
 
02:01:25.790 --> 02:01:25.800 align:start position:0%
workers compensation comp the
 
02:01:28.390 --> 02:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
compensation appeals board so I'm I
 
02:01:34.589 --> 02:01:34.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:38.030 --> 02:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
okay okay good yeah so we this will be
 
02:01:40.270 --> 02:01:40.280 align:start position:0%
all right so any other points anybody
 
02:01:44.149 --> 02:01:44.159 align:start position:0%
want to object to this no we're okay all
 
02:01:47.229 --> 02:01:47.239 align:start position:0%
right so representative uh rang moves
 
02:01:50.589 --> 02:01:50.599 align:start position:0%
that we accept Section uh 134
 
02:01:52.830 --> 02:01:52.840 align:start position:0%
representative M second
 
02:01:57.350 --> 02:01:57.360 align:start position:0%
anyone yeah all of them in favor I okay
 
02:02:00.149 --> 02:02:00.159 align:start position:0%
unanimous all right we are going to
 
02:02:01.830 --> 02:02:01.840 align:start position:0%

well there's two parts so no it's just
 
03:21:10.229 --> 03:21:10.239 align:start position:0%
this it's just about um can you send
 
03:21:14.150 --> 03:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
somebody an email notice and it's it's
 
03:21:17.790 --> 03:21:17.800 align:start position:0%
um whenever somebody agrees why am I so
 
03:21:21.309 --> 03:21:21.319 align:start position:0%
loud look at where you are 60 am I so
 
03:21:26.309 --> 03:21:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:29.790 --> 03:21:29.800 align:start position:0%
um so this is just a change on line 23
 
03:21:34.830 --> 03:21:34.840 align:start position:0%
and 24 to say um you can send
 
03:21:39.030 --> 03:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
individuals an email as opposed to as
 
03:21:43.309 --> 03:21:43.319 align:start position:0%
long as they consent rather than send
 
03:21:45.950 --> 03:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
these emails as long as everybody cons
 
03:21:45.960 --> 03:21:47.349 align:start position:0%
these emails as long as everybody cons
sents

03:21:47.349 --> 03:21:47.359 align:start position:0%
sents
 
03:21:50.110 --> 03:21:50.120 align:start position:0%
if you see what I mean so this this is a
 
03:21:52.110 --> 03:21:52.120 align:start position:0%
nothing thing
 
03:21:54.950 --> 03:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
okay okay represent rang moves we accept
 
03:21:54.960 --> 03:21:56.110 align:start position:0%
okay okay represent rang moves we accept
Section

03:21:56.110 --> 03:21:56.120 align:start position:0%
Section
 
03:21:58.750 --> 03:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
136 all right set representative Sweeny
 
03:22:00.950 --> 03:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
seconds all those in
 
03:22:05.229 --> 03:22:05.239 align:start position:0%
favor okay opposed okay no unanimous
 
03:22:08.990 --> 03:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
okay that's that one now
 
03:22:12.710 --> 03:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
137 ah this is the elevator fee so we
 
03:22:15.349 --> 03:22:15.359 align:start position:0%
were thinking about raising this
 
03:22:18.309 --> 03:22:18.319 align:start position:0%
one right
 
03:22:21.750 --> 03:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
did we hear from him I have not do we
 
03:22:21.760 --> 03:22:22.910 align:start position:0%
did we hear from him I have not do we
ask

03:22:22.910 --> 03:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
ask
 
03:22:25.510 --> 03:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
um commissioner Maryfield about yes
 
03:22:27.630 --> 03:22:27.640 align:start position:0%
represent R yeah I don't think this is
 
03:22:29.630 --> 03:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
raising the fee what it's doing is it's
 
03:22:31.910 --> 03:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
requiring the fee before the certificate
 
03:22:34.870 --> 03:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
is issued yes right no problem with this
 
03:22:37.070 --> 03:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
but it's just we had talked about
 
03:22:38.950 --> 03:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
raising the elevator
 
03:22:43.030 --> 03:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
fee at the time right and so but but we
 
03:22:45.349 --> 03:22:45.359 align:start position:0%
were going to get a a confirmation from
 
03:22:49.110 --> 03:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
the oh that's right I will follow up on
 
03:22:51.309 --> 03:22:51.319 align:start position:0%
that request they did say that but I'll
 
03:22:53.710 --> 03:22:53.720 align:start position:0%
check in with them okay find out yeah
 
03:22:55.750 --> 03:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
and and you can check or Jack can check
 
03:22:58.349 --> 03:22:58.359 align:start position:0%
when was this changed right
 
03:23:02.870 --> 03:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
so um all right let's move on to
 
03:23:05.990 --> 03:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
138 so we'll leave this open for the
 
03:23:09.429 --> 03:23:09.439 align:start position:0%
moment um civil
 
03:23:09.439 --> 03:23:11.309 align:start position:0%
moment um civil
penalties

03:23:11.309 --> 03:23:11.319 align:start position:0%
penalties
 
03:23:15.830 --> 03:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
um which seems pretty normal right all
 
03:23:18.550 --> 03:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
right now the next one
 
03:23:18.560 --> 03:23:20.550 align:start position:0%
right now the next one
139

03:23:20.550 --> 03:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
139
 
03:23:24.229 --> 03:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
um failure to
 
03:23:27.189 --> 03:23:27.199 align:start position:0%
comply um oh things that could result in
 
03:23:30.150 --> 03:23:30.160 align:start position:0%
a civil penalty is that what this list
 
03:23:34.630 --> 03:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
is um inj adding to right they're adding
 
03:23:36.510 --> 03:23:36.520 align:start position:0%
two things that could could result in a
 
03:23:42.870 --> 03:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
civil penalty failure to comply with RSA
 
03:23:48.750 --> 03:23:48.760 align:start position:0%
281a and violations pursuant to 27 6-
 
03:23:52.349 --> 03:23:52.359 align:start position:0%
a so this is adding disputes related to
 
03:23:53.950 --> 03:23:53.960 align:start position:0%
application for reimbursement from the
 
03:23:56.189 --> 03:23:56.199 align:start position:0%
special fund for second
 
03:24:00.429 --> 03:24:00.439 align:start position:0%
injuries oh this is second injury stuff
 
03:24:03.590 --> 03:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:06.309 --> 03:24:06.319 align:start position:0%
yes yeah that's 140 we're talking about
 
03:24:06.319 --> 03:24:08.030 align:start position:0%
yes yeah that's 140 we're talking about
section

03:24:08.030 --> 03:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
section
 
03:24:08.040 --> 03:24:10.349 align:start position:0%
section
139

03:24:10.349 --> 03:24:10.359 align:start position:0%
139
 
03:24:15.150 --> 03:24:15.160 align:start position:0%
yep RSA 281 a a colon
 
03:24:17.550 --> 03:24:17.560 align:start position:0%
54 no no
 
03:24:22.309 --> 03:24:22.319 align:start position:0%
no 139 which is L9 31 RSA
 
03:24:26.750 --> 03:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
273 col 11a yeah but they're
 
03:24:26.760 --> 03:24:29.070 align:start position:0%
273 col 11a yeah but they're
adding

03:24:29.070 --> 03:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
adding
 
03:24:31.150 --> 03:24:31.160 align:start position:0%
281a all right I'm I'm going to look
 
03:24:32.590 --> 03:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
that one
 
03:24:35.670 --> 03:24:35.680 align:start position:0%
281a is
 
03:25:00.150 --> 03:25:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:05.750 --> 03:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
oh okay so this is the section that says
 
03:25:08.910 --> 03:25:08.920 align:start position:0%
um first you give a warning to to an
 
03:25:10.510 --> 03:25:10.520 align:start position:0%
employer and
 
03:25:14.229 --> 03:25:14.239 align:start position:0%
then uh if if the defect is still at
 
03:25:17.550 --> 03:25:17.560 align:start position:0%
30-day become still still gone still
 
03:25:20.750 --> 03:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
there for 30 days then you can issue a
 
03:25:23.349 --> 03:25:23.359 align:start position:0%
fine right so this is something we did
 
03:25:27.630 --> 03:25:27.640 align:start position:0%
years ago to to give employers warning
 
03:25:29.670 --> 03:25:29.680 align:start position:0%
that we're about to give them a fine
 
03:25:34.630 --> 03:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
okay and so the list is things that
 
03:25:36.630 --> 03:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
don't need a
 
03:25:41.670 --> 03:25:41.680 align:start position:0%
warning okay so for example um failure
 
03:25:45.030 --> 03:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
to pay an employee in full and on
 
03:25:47.110 --> 03:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
time you you don't have to be warned
 
03:25:48.150 --> 03:25:48.160 align:start position:0%
about that because you know you're
 
03:25:50.670 --> 03:25:50.680 align:start position:0%
supposed to do that right things like
 
03:25:54.990 --> 03:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
that so so this adds to the list things
 
03:25:58.070 --> 03:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
you can find right away without giving a
 
03:25:58.080 --> 03:26:02.630 align:start position:0%
you can find right away without giving a
warning

03:26:02.630 --> 03:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:02.640 --> 03:26:04.550 align:start position:0%
 
first

03:26:04.550 --> 03:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
first
 
03:26:08.469 --> 03:26:08.479 align:start position:0%
okay so and and they they look fairly
 
03:26:11.750 --> 03:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
broad right they're they're
 
03:26:17.150 --> 03:26:17.160 align:start position:0%
about um whole chapters right 276 - a is
 
03:26:22.710 --> 03:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:24.870 --> 03:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
chapter they probably feel like they
 
03:26:26.950 --> 03:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
have to act they probably feel like they
 
03:26:30.189 --> 03:26:30.199 align:start position:0%
have to act quickly in that
 
03:26:34.070 --> 03:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
case he didn't speak about this to did
 
03:26:37.870 --> 03:26:37.880 align:start position:0%
yeah Mr chair I have a question yes it's
 
03:26:40.070 --> 03:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
probably for Melissa or Jack um do we
 
03:26:42.349 --> 03:26:42.359 align:start position:0%
know what the fund balance is of the
 
03:26:44.429 --> 03:26:44.439 align:start position:0%
labor restricted
 
03:26:48.110 --> 03:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
fund that was established in 273 colon 1
 
03:26:50.910 --> 03:26:50.920 align:start position:0%
a b
 
03:26:53.590 --> 03:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
1B what are you looking at uh I'm
 
03:26:56.950 --> 03:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
looking at line 29 it says all monies
 
03:26:58.750 --> 03:26:58.760 align:start position:0%
collected under this section shall be
 
03:27:00.710 --> 03:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
deposited into the Department of Labor
 
03:27:03.710 --> 03:27:03.720 align:start position:0%
restricted fund oh I see MH I was just
 
03:27:05.510 --> 03:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
wondering what is the balance of that
 
03:27:08.429 --> 03:27:08.439 align:start position:0%
have we been collecting a lot of
 
03:27:12.469 --> 03:27:12.479 align:start position:0%
fines and what is it used for right is
 
03:27:17.269 --> 03:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
it I'm assuming it's non-lps yeah
 
03:27:19.870 --> 03:27:19.880 align:start position:0%
um it's unclear that could be their
 
03:27:22.309 --> 03:27:22.319 align:start position:0%
their whole budget fund right oh that's
 
03:27:24.030 --> 03:27:24.040 align:start position:0%
true like because they're they're an off
 
03:27:25.710 --> 03:27:25.720 align:start position:0%
books kind of you know they're not in
 
03:27:27.630 --> 03:27:27.640 align:start position:0%
the general fund they're on they're
 
03:27:29.510 --> 03:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
they're in their own stuff so I have a
 
03:27:32.150 --> 03:27:32.160 align:start position:0%
feeling that's probably their whole okay
 
03:27:34.110 --> 03:27:34.120 align:start position:0%
their whole budget it's actually a small
 
03:27:37.269 --> 03:27:37.279 align:start position:0%
fund it only has $68,000 in it the end
 
03:27:53.590 --> 03:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:55.750 --> 03:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
it's funded from fees license
 
03:28:07.790 --> 03:28:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:10.910 --> 03:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
penalties and then the
 
03:28:14.150 --> 03:28:14.160 align:start position:0%
expenses so it receives about $400,000 a
 
03:28:14.160 --> 03:28:16.870 align:start position:0%
expenses so it receives about $400,000 a
year

03:28:16.870 --> 03:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:28:18.630 --> 03:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
with a little bit of a carryover the
 
03:28:21.790 --> 03:28:21.800 align:start position:0%
expenses in 24 or 400,000 and that is to
 
03:28:24.510 --> 03:28:24.520 align:start position:0%
fund the administrative Administration
 
03:28:29.229 --> 03:28:29.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:31.469 --> 03:28:31.479 align:start position:0%
Division so the fund is required to
 
03:28:32.990 --> 03:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
finance the operations of the Department
 
03:28:38.950 --> 03:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:41.910 --> 03:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
compensation so question represent thank
 
03:28:44.429 --> 03:28:44.439 align:start position:0%
you so Melissa so you're saying it it it
 
03:28:47.550 --> 03:28:47.560 align:start position:0%
just has a $68,000
 
03:28:50.510 --> 03:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
$68,000 balance yes because it looks
 
03:28:52.870 --> 03:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
like whatever the fees and fines and
 
03:28:54.550 --> 03:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
penalties that are coming in those are
 
03:28:57.550 --> 03:28:57.560 align:start position:0%
then expended to pay for um the
 
03:28:59.110 --> 03:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
operations of the labor department not
 
03:29:01.790 --> 03:29:01.800 align:start position:0%
association with workers comp okay so
 
03:29:03.910 --> 03:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
whatever's coming in it's funding so
 
03:29:06.590 --> 03:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
it's pretty close to being flat funed
 
03:29:08.150 --> 03:29:08.160 align:start position:0%
with a little bit of a carry forward
 
03:29:09.790 --> 03:29:09.800 align:start position:0%
every year I got it thank you you're
 
03:29:11.429 --> 03:29:11.439 align:start position:0%
welcome all right but in any case
 
03:29:16.229 --> 03:29:16.239 align:start position:0%
section 138 is strictly a um
 
03:29:18.229 --> 03:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
technical type of Correction right I
 
03:29:20.469 --> 03:29:20.479 align:start position:0%
mean if some other part of law says you
 
03:29:24.189 --> 03:29:24.199 align:start position:0%
can do this this says okay right so it's
 
03:29:24.199 --> 03:29:26.590 align:start position:0%
can do this this says okay right so it's
like

03:29:26.590 --> 03:29:26.600 align:start position:0%
like
 
03:29:29.309 --> 03:29:29.319 align:start position:0%
yeah all right second all right so we're
 
03:29:32.710 --> 03:29:32.720 align:start position:0%
still okay just we'll just vote on 138
 
03:29:35.550 --> 03:29:35.560 align:start position:0%
only okay so representative rung moves
 
03:29:37.309 --> 03:29:37.319 align:start position:0%
and representative evil seconds that we
 
03:29:40.269 --> 03:29:40.279 align:start position:0%
accept Section 138 of House Bill 2 all
 
03:29:41.269 --> 03:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
those in
 
03:29:44.750 --> 03:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
favor yes okay so that one is done but
 
03:29:44.760 --> 03:29:47.030 align:start position:0%
favor yes okay so that one is done but
139

03:29:47.030 --> 03:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
139
 
03:29:49.990 --> 03:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
that one's more of a
 
03:29:50.000 --> 03:29:51.910 align:start position:0%
that one's more of a
question

03:29:51.910 --> 03:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:29:57.110 --> 03:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
right so Mr yes re it seems to me that
 
03:29:59.750 --> 03:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
if there are misgivings about it maybe
 
03:30:02.309 --> 03:30:02.319 align:start position:0%
we could at least give the commissioner
 
03:30:05.510 --> 03:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
of Labor an opportunity to say why why
 
03:30:07.590 --> 03:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
if we're touching base on the fee issue
 
03:30:09.790 --> 03:30:09.800 align:start position:0%
anyway yes ask about
 
03:30:12.910 --> 03:30:12.920 align:start position:0%
139 she she says ask the commissioner of
 
03:30:16.429 --> 03:30:16.439 align:start position:0%
Labor to comment on why section 139 is
 
03:30:18.469 --> 03:30:18.479 align:start position:0%
there why do they not want to give a
 
03:30:23.110 --> 03:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:26.349 --> 03:30:26.359 align:start position:0%
cases yep I can do that okay thank you
 
03:30:28.389 --> 03:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
all right so we're GNA wait on that
 
03:30:31.349 --> 03:30:31.359 align:start position:0%
one all right
 
03:30:35.349 --> 03:30:35.359 align:start position:0%
wait okay now
 
03:30:40.030 --> 03:30:40.040 align:start position:0%
140 second oh second injury fund
 
03:30:42.670 --> 03:30:42.680 align:start position:0%
now we had this whole thing to get rid
 
03:30:44.830 --> 03:30:44.840 align:start position:0%
of the second injury fund and we ended
 
03:30:49.389 --> 03:30:49.399 align:start position:0%
up not doing it but I'm wondering if um
 
03:30:52.830 --> 03:30:52.840 align:start position:0%
we might want to reconsider that um
 
03:30:54.910 --> 03:30:54.920 align:start position:0%
because it's it seems like it's it's a
 
03:30:57.110 --> 03:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
huge amount of work
 
03:31:01.510 --> 03:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
for for not much benefit right it's um
 
03:31:04.429 --> 03:31:04.439 align:start position:0%
did we have a well we had one last time
 
03:31:08.710 --> 03:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
last two years ago chair yeah I yes
 
03:31:12.309 --> 03:31:12.319 align:start position:0%
represented mon so for us newbies um so
 
03:31:14.510 --> 03:31:14.520 align:start position:0%
is there there's a separate fund for
 
03:31:18.630 --> 03:31:18.640 align:start position:0%
second injuries what it has to do with
 
03:31:22.429 --> 03:31:22.439 align:start position:0%
is if somebody's getting workman's comp
 
03:31:24.910 --> 03:31:24.920 align:start position:0%
for an injury and then they later get
 
03:31:29.630 --> 03:31:29.640 align:start position:0%
hired by somebody else and then um they
 
03:31:33.110 --> 03:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
have like a second injury okay um the
 
03:31:36.950 --> 03:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
question is does the does the cost of
 
03:31:39.469 --> 03:31:39.479 align:start position:0%
that apply strictly to the second
 
03:31:42.269 --> 03:31:42.279 align:start position:0%
employer or maybe should some of it be
 
03:31:44.429 --> 03:31:44.439 align:start position:0%
collected from the original employer
 
03:31:46.269 --> 03:31:46.279 align:start position:0%
because maybe
 
03:31:50.630 --> 03:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
you you know what I mean and and so um
 
03:31:53.910 --> 03:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
it it tends to be a wash for any
 
03:31:56.309 --> 03:31:56.319 align:start position:0%
employer of any size right like the
 
03:32:00.590 --> 03:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
state for example right but but the main
 
03:32:04.309 --> 03:32:04.319 align:start position:0%
problem with it was that people have to
 
03:32:07.670 --> 03:32:07.680 align:start position:0%
apply for for taking money from this
 
03:32:09.910 --> 03:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
fund right taking money from the second
 
03:32:12.550 --> 03:32:12.560 align:start position:0%
injury fund everybody pays into it kind
 
03:32:16.150 --> 03:32:16.160 align:start position:0%
of automatically but but when the circum
 
03:32:19.830 --> 03:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
an happens then the the employer has to
 
03:32:23.030 --> 03:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
apply to be reimbursed from this fund
 
03:32:25.469 --> 03:32:25.479 align:start position:0%
and generally speaking the bigger
 
03:32:27.349 --> 03:32:27.359 align:start position:0%
employers are better at that than the
 
03:32:31.389 --> 03:32:31.399 align:start position:0%
little employers right and so it that
 
03:32:33.670 --> 03:32:33.680 align:start position:0%
was the reason for getting rid of it but
 
03:32:35.070 --> 03:32:35.080 align:start position:0%
but we ended up not doing it for
 
03:32:36.710 --> 03:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
whatever reason so I'm I'm just trying
 
03:32:38.990 --> 03:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
to understand
 
03:32:43.150 --> 03:32:43.160 align:start position:0%
so so so workers come money that's
 
03:32:45.990 --> 03:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
collected from workers for workers come
 
03:32:48.309 --> 03:32:48.319 align:start position:0%
some of it gets deposited into a first
 
03:32:50.269 --> 03:32:50.279 align:start position:0%
injury fund and some of it gets
 
03:32:53.349 --> 03:32:53.359 align:start position:0%
deposited into a secondary injury fund I
 
03:32:55.830 --> 03:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
think so I mean it's it's it's in
 
03:32:58.150 --> 03:32:58.160 align:start position:0%
general I mean the first injury F the
 
03:33:00.990 --> 03:33:01.000 align:start position:0%
main fund of workers comp is huge right
 
03:33:04.670 --> 03:33:04.680 align:start position:0%
it's it's a lot of money um but the
 
03:33:07.429 --> 03:33:07.439 align:start position:0%
second injury fund is there to cover
 
03:33:10.429 --> 03:33:10.439 align:start position:0%
these circumstances and it may be it
 
03:33:13.070 --> 03:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
could be one of these things where you
 
03:33:15.389 --> 03:33:15.399 align:start position:0%
know if the if the amount in the second
 
03:33:17.710 --> 03:33:17.720 align:start position:0%
injury fund isn't enough to cover its
 
03:33:19.590 --> 03:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
expenses then it automatically draws
 
03:33:21.830 --> 03:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
from the other fund or something like
 
03:33:23.950 --> 03:33:23.960 align:start position:0%
that right so
 
03:33:27.229 --> 03:33:27.239 align:start position:0%
so the rate of workman's comp the the
 
03:33:29.910 --> 03:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
cost to employers of workman's comp is
 
03:33:32.389 --> 03:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
based on experience right so when the
 
03:33:35.510 --> 03:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
fund gets to be some limit like $400
 
03:33:38.590 --> 03:33:38.600 align:start position:0%
million then the rates go down right and
 
03:33:40.550 --> 03:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
then when the fund starts to drop then
 
03:33:42.269 --> 03:33:42.279 align:start position:0%
the rates go back up you know it's one
 
03:33:46.830 --> 03:33:46.840 align:start position:0%
of those kind of things so um
 
03:33:50.950 --> 03:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
anyway um why don't
 
03:33:54.550 --> 03:33:54.560 align:start position:0%
we yeah why don't we ask about that and
 
03:33:56.590 --> 03:33:56.600 align:start position:0%
and because at various times I've talked
 
03:33:58.110 --> 03:33:58.120 align:start position:0%
to the Department of Labor and the
 
03:34:00.469 --> 03:34:00.479 align:start position:0%
department of administrative services do
 
03:34:02.229 --> 03:34:02.239 align:start position:0%
you like the second industry fund do you
 
03:34:05.030 --> 03:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
not like those and generally speaking it
 
03:34:07.309 --> 03:34:07.319 align:start position:0%
seems like the Department of Labor
 
03:34:10.710 --> 03:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
thinks it's um it's it's just extra
 
03:34:13.950 --> 03:34:13.960 align:start position:0%
complication that's not needed right and
 
03:34:15.790 --> 03:34:15.800 align:start position:0%
because they have to implement it right
 
03:34:19.030 --> 03:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
right and but um Department of
 
03:34:22.429 --> 03:34:22.439 align:start position:0%
administrative Services tends to say get
 
03:34:25.910 --> 03:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
rid of it or keep it based on last year
 
03:34:28.710 --> 03:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
did I did I get more than I
 
03:34:33.030 --> 03:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
spent right and so um I don't know it
 
03:34:36.990 --> 03:34:37.000 align:start position:0%
it's um I to me I would I would simplify
 
03:34:40.030 --> 03:34:40.040 align:start position:0%
the world and and get rid of it but um
 
03:34:41.830 --> 03:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
why don't we why don't we ask a question
 
03:34:44.750 --> 03:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Labor to see if
 
03:34:46.950 --> 03:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
they can send somebody to really explain
 
03:34:51.389 --> 03:34:51.399 align:start position:0%
the the second injury fund okay um and
 
03:34:54.950 --> 03:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
and see if you can re get back the the
 
03:34:56.710 --> 03:34:56.720 align:start position:0%
bill that would would have gotten rid of
 
03:35:01.070 --> 03:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
it and um present it as a possible House
 
03:35:04.429 --> 03:35:04.439 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 Amendment okay and and find out
 
03:35:07.070 --> 03:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
the history of it and all that okay good
 
03:35:09.590 --> 03:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
so let's wait on this one
 
03:35:17.550 --> 03:35:17.560 align:start position:0%
um so where was it uh okay so we are
 
03:35:20.750 --> 03:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
on um
 
03:35:20.760 --> 03:35:25.790 align:start position:0%
on um
141

03:35:25.790 --> 03:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:29.030 --> 03:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
now oh is it the same
 
03:35:31.950 --> 03:35:31.960 align:start position:0%
RSA 281a
 
03:35:35.590 --> 03:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
54 281 a55 yeah so this is probably more
 
03:35:38.950 --> 03:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
of the same right
 
03:35:38.960 --> 03:35:40.510 align:start position:0%
of the same right
okay

03:35:40.510 --> 03:35:40.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:35:46.349 --> 03:35:46.359 align:start position:0%
um now um so section 142
 
03:35:50.389 --> 03:35:50.399 align:start position:0%
okay so 140 and 141 are together okay
 
03:35:53.790 --> 03:35:53.800 align:start position:0%
142 this one is there because it's
 
03:35:58.349 --> 03:35:58.359 align:start position:0%
paying for the um that's the that's the
 
03:36:00.269 --> 03:36:00.279 align:start position:0%
line in house bill one that has 5
 
03:36:02.429 --> 03:36:02.439 align:start position:0%
million the first year in 28 million the
 
03:36:05.910 --> 03:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
second year yeah Melissa I'm only going
 
03:36:07.269 --> 03:36:07.279 align:start position:0%
to pause you on that because you are
 
03:36:08.630 --> 03:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
correct and that's what we heard but
 
03:36:10.790 --> 03:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
then we did get follow-up information
 
03:36:13.710 --> 03:36:13.720 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire retirement system um
 
03:36:16.150 --> 03:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
the business office versus what mark had
 
03:36:19.630 --> 03:36:19.640 align:start position:0%
spoke about so do you want to
 
03:36:23.550 --> 03:36:23.560 align:start position:0%
talk so okay so what what this is
 
03:36:25.590 --> 03:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
actually requests from retirement system
 
03:36:27.070 --> 03:36:27.080 align:start position:0%
it is in that same unit that the
 
03:36:28.630 --> 03:36:28.640 align:start position:0%
retirement funds are in but it has
 
03:36:30.550 --> 03:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
nothing to it has nothing to do with the
 
03:36:32.910 --> 03:36:32.920 align:start position:0%
re I okay so they're just trying to
 
03:36:35.070 --> 03:36:35.080 align:start position:0%
clarify that their funds are
 
03:36:38.030 --> 03:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
non-aps um apparently there was some
 
03:36:39.750 --> 03:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
miscommunication back and forth they
 
03:36:41.469 --> 03:36:41.479 align:start position:0%
used to be considered non-aps and then
 
03:36:45.150 --> 03:36:45.160 align:start position:0%
over the last year or two Das wasn't
 
03:36:46.510 --> 03:36:46.520 align:start position:0%
sure if they were supposed to be lapsing
 
03:36:47.910 --> 03:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
or not so they were lapsing it so it's
 
03:36:50.309 --> 03:36:50.319 align:start position:0%
causing issues in retirements budget so
 
03:36:51.590 --> 03:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
they're asking to put it in there that
 
03:36:54.870 --> 03:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
they're non-aps funds
 
03:36:56.469 --> 03:36:56.479 align:start position:0%
okay I
 
03:36:59.070 --> 03:36:59.080 align:start position:0%
mean seems reasonable I guess I don't
 
03:37:03.469 --> 03:37:03.479 align:start position:0%
know yes yeah um the main thing
 
03:37:07.750 --> 03:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
is so I've I've gotten some feedback
 
03:37:11.550 --> 03:37:11.560 align:start position:0%
just from constituent types that that um
 
03:37:13.550 --> 03:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
we're we're letting the retirement
 
03:37:15.550 --> 03:37:15.560 align:start position:0%
system grow too much right they they're
 
03:37:17.389 --> 03:37:17.399 align:start position:0%
asking for like six or seven more
 
03:37:20.030 --> 03:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
employees out of you know they have 78
 
03:37:22.229 --> 03:37:22.239 align:start position:0%
or something right now and they think
 
03:37:26.110 --> 03:37:26.120 align:start position:0%
the expenses of the system are too high
 
03:37:26.120 --> 03:37:28.790 align:start position:0%
the expenses of the system are too high
so

03:37:28.790 --> 03:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:37:32.269 --> 03:37:32.279 align:start position:0%
um you know this
 
03:37:34.750 --> 03:37:34.760 align:start position:0%
uh there's a question as to whether we
 
03:37:36.510 --> 03:37:36.520 align:start position:0%
want to allow that number of new
 
03:37:38.590 --> 03:37:38.600 align:start position:0%
employees because it just basically goes
 
03:37:43.670 --> 03:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
on everybody's um you know 80% of their
 
03:37:47.750 --> 03:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
costs are property tax right so
 
03:37:52.469 --> 03:37:52.479 align:start position:0%
um it it's uh something we might want to
 
03:37:55.870 --> 03:37:55.880 align:start position:0%
not allow that to happen
 
03:37:59.590 --> 03:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
Okay um but do we want to approve this
 
03:38:02.830 --> 03:38:02.840 align:start position:0%
one thing yes are we happy with this
 
03:38:08.790 --> 03:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
okay I move to approve section uh 142 of
 
03:38:12.229 --> 03:38:12.239 align:start position:0%
hb2 okay repres do we have a second
 
03:38:14.830 --> 03:38:14.840 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney so representative
 
03:38:17.990 --> 03:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
evil moves that we accept section 142 of
 
03:38:19.910 --> 03:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
of the House Bill 2 representative
 
03:38:22.710 --> 03:38:22.720 align:start position:0%
Sweeney seconds all those in
 
03:38:28.030 --> 03:38:28.040 align:start position:0%
favor all right unanimous okay so 142 is
 
03:38:31.070 --> 03:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
done but we we'll come back to the
 
03:38:33.870 --> 03:38:33.880 align:start position:0%
budget of the retirement system okay
 
03:38:41.189 --> 03:38:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:44.150 --> 03:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
65 oh that's the one you
 
03:38:45.990 --> 03:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
won yes
 
03:38:49.229 --> 03:38:49.239 align:start position:0%
okay so I have I have now so this is
 
03:38:52.950 --> 03:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
about RSA 31a suspending it I have now
 
03:38:57.429 --> 03:38:57.439 align:start position:0%
read RSA 31a it's completely obsolete
 
03:39:00.389 --> 03:39:00.399 align:start position:0%
it's full of stuff like in
 
03:39:03.269 --> 03:39:03.279 align:start position:0%
1970 we're going to send so much to this
 
03:39:06.750 --> 03:39:06.760 align:start position:0%
place and you know it it it is way out
 
03:39:09.750 --> 03:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
of date so my recommendation here is
 
03:39:11.790 --> 03:39:11.800 align:start position:0%
rather than put this in the budget year
 
03:39:14.269 --> 03:39:14.279 align:start position:0%
after year after year why don't we just
 
03:39:18.469 --> 03:39:18.479 align:start position:0%
repeal ours a 31a okay CU it's it's been
 
03:39:21.750 --> 03:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
suspended for I don't know how long um
 
03:39:25.469 --> 03:39:25.479 align:start position:0%
but it's it's not as far as I can tell
 
03:39:27.110 --> 03:39:27.120 align:start position:0%
it's it's completely
 
03:39:31.150 --> 03:39:31.160 align:start position:0%
unworkable um so my suggestion would be
 
03:39:33.309 --> 03:39:33.319 align:start position:0%
replace this with something that just
 
03:39:35.950 --> 03:39:35.960 align:start position:0%
says repeal RSA
 
03:39:40.229 --> 03:39:40.239 align:start position:0%
31a represent MTH is there is there any
 
03:39:44.349 --> 03:39:44.359 align:start position:0%
language in that RSA that um you know
 
03:39:46.189 --> 03:39:46.199 align:start position:0%
enabling language
 
03:39:49.429 --> 03:39:49.439 align:start position:0%
that for some kind of a program where
 
03:39:50.510 --> 03:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
you know what you have to do is just
 
03:39:51.550 --> 03:39:51.560 align:start position:0%
change the
 
03:39:54.870 --> 03:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
date or is it just really really it's
 
03:39:57.990 --> 03:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
similar it's similar in concept to what
 
03:39:59.990 --> 03:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
we currently do with the rooms of meals
 
03:40:03.070 --> 03:40:03.080 align:start position:0%
tax right sending money back to towns
 
03:40:06.229 --> 03:40:06.239 align:start position:0%
based on a formula okay okay the problem
 
03:40:09.030 --> 03:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
is it's full of it's one of these things
 
03:40:11.910 --> 03:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
where it's like full of exceptions right
 
03:40:15.830 --> 03:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
you know in this in 1989 do this and in
 
03:40:19.469 --> 03:40:19.479 align:start position:0%
1970 do that and in 19 you know because
 
03:40:21.750 --> 03:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
every year they decided you know for
 
03:40:23.590 --> 03:40:23.600 align:start position:0%
whatever reason to give a little more to
 
03:40:25.309 --> 03:40:25.319 align:start position:0%
this town and you know it's it's like
 
03:40:27.670 --> 03:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
the the stuff that happened with
 
03:40:29.790 --> 03:40:29.800 align:start position:0%
adequate Ed right and the spreadsheets
 
03:40:31.550 --> 03:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
and all that stuff right they decided to
 
03:40:34.110 --> 03:40:34.120 align:start position:0%
change the formula this year that year
 
03:40:36.110 --> 03:40:36.120 align:start position:0%
and the other year and and like I said
 
03:40:40.389 --> 03:40:40.399 align:start position:0%
it's it's been um it's been suspended
 
03:40:43.309 --> 03:40:43.319 align:start position:0%
for for a very long time um Let me let
 
03:40:45.670 --> 03:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
me show you where the source of fund is
 
03:40:48.630 --> 03:40:48.640 align:start position:0%
because it's not the rooms of meal's tax
 
03:40:53.269 --> 03:40:53.279 align:start position:0%
um it's other taxes can I go ahead so I
 
03:40:56.070 --> 03:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
mean I I understand that we consistently
 
03:40:58.189 --> 03:40:58.199 align:start position:0%
suspend it but it's kind of a big move
 
03:41:00.269 --> 03:41:00.279 align:start position:0%
to repeal it I guess I'd feel more
 
03:41:02.710 --> 03:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
comfortable agreeing to that if I saw
 
03:41:05.990 --> 03:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
what your proposal was to replace it
 
03:41:10.070 --> 03:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
okay well so the last time anything in
 
03:41:10.080 --> 03:41:10.830 align:start position:0%
okay well so the last time anything in
this

03:41:10.830 --> 03:41:10.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:41:12.950 --> 03:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
chapter was
 
03:41:15.830 --> 03:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
changed is 1999
 
03:41:17.189 --> 03:41:17.199 align:start position:0%
26 years
 
03:41:21.349 --> 03:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
ago um I suppose uh Melissa could
 
03:41:24.229 --> 03:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
research the last time it was a anything
 
03:41:26.070 --> 03:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
was paid under this
 
03:41:30.030 --> 03:41:30.040 align:start position:0%
chapter um but but you have an idea for
 
03:41:33.510 --> 03:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
an alternative right only to no my
 
03:41:36.149 --> 03:41:36.159 align:start position:0%
alternative is change the way we
 
03:41:39.670 --> 03:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
distribute rooms of meals tax oh okay so
 
03:41:42.389 --> 03:41:42.399 align:start position:0%
that one is elsewhere
 
03:41:42.399 --> 03:41:44.070 align:start position:0%
that one is elsewhere
right

03:41:44.070 --> 03:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:41:48.149 --> 03:41:48.159 align:start position:0%
um and and um I mean we could take that
 
03:41:51.309 --> 03:41:51.319 align:start position:0%
from elsewhere make it a new RS what you
 
03:41:54.070 --> 03:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
were thinking it is yeah I mean it it
 
03:42:00.110 --> 03:42:00.120 align:start position:0%
it's reasonable um but anyways
 
03:42:00.120 --> 03:42:03.309 align:start position:0%
it's reasonable um but anyways
so

03:42:03.309 --> 03:42:03.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:06.309 --> 03:42:06.319 align:start position:0%
um so so
 
03:42:11.110 --> 03:42:11.120 align:start position:0%
um here's the the taxes that go into the
 
03:42:13.990 --> 03:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
this thing there's the tax on Machinery
 
03:42:16.830 --> 03:42:16.840 align:start position:0%
the tax on stock and trade the tax on
 
03:42:20.710 --> 03:42:20.720 align:start position:0%
neat stock the tax on poultry the tax on
 
03:42:24.149 --> 03:42:24.159 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle fuel pumps and tanks the
 
03:42:26.870 --> 03:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
tax on certain Machinery the tax on
 
03:42:30.030 --> 03:42:30.040 align:start position:0%
domestic rabbits the tax on fur bearing
 
03:42:33.349 --> 03:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
animals the tax on portable Mills the
 
03:42:36.870 --> 03:42:36.880 align:start position:0%
tax on stud horses and
 
03:42:40.429 --> 03:42:40.439 align:start position:0%
jackasses the the the tax on Forest
 
03:42:44.389 --> 03:42:44.399 align:start position:0%
Products okay so you know what I mean
 
03:42:47.510 --> 03:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's obsolete okay well don't
 
03:42:49.349 --> 03:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
you think it feels like a ways and means
 
03:42:51.269 --> 03:42:51.279 align:start position:0%
kind of a thing though
 
03:42:55.710 --> 03:42:55.720 align:start position:0%
yeah language I'm looking there is
 
03:42:58.269 --> 03:42:58.279 align:start position:0%
language in 31
 
03:43:01.189 --> 03:43:01.199 align:start position:0%
A4 that says under no circumstances
 
03:43:02.870 --> 03:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
shall the amount appropriated under this
 
03:43:05.630 --> 03:43:05.640 align:start position:0%
section be less than $47 million I know
 
03:43:07.950 --> 03:43:07.960 align:start position:0%
that's why they always suspend it so
 
03:43:11.149 --> 03:43:11.159 align:start position:0%
that's kind of that's a big deal right
 
03:43:13.790 --> 03:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
right I mean if you can eliminate that
 
03:43:15.269 --> 03:43:15.279 align:start position:0%
well it is and it isn't because because
 
03:43:16.710 --> 03:43:16.720 align:start position:0%
the amount we send back under room's
 
03:43:21.750 --> 03:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
meals tax is $140 million okay so you
 
03:43:26.110 --> 03:43:26.120 align:start position:0%
know that's a big deal this is not quite
 
03:43:28.229 --> 03:43:28.239 align:start position:0%
can we just think this is really big to
 
03:43:30.670 --> 03:43:30.680 align:start position:0%
repeal this I think from a New Hampshire
 
03:43:33.710 --> 03:43:33.720 align:start position:0%
municiple association thing I'd be I
 
03:43:36.750 --> 03:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
mean i' why don't I would like to
 
03:43:39.550 --> 03:43:39.560 align:start position:0%
suggest we talk about it after you
 
03:43:41.110 --> 03:43:41.120 align:start position:0%
because you're thinking about all these
 
03:43:43.110 --> 03:43:43.120 align:start position:0%
things I know you had an alternative in
 
03:43:45.990 --> 03:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
rooms and meals and thought at one point
 
03:43:48.030 --> 03:43:48.040 align:start position:0%
you had this concept of moving it over
 
03:43:50.229 --> 03:43:50.239 align:start position:0%
here yeah because I thought I thought
 
03:43:52.630 --> 03:43:52.640 align:start position:0%
that the way this had a formula it was a
 
03:43:54.990 --> 03:43:55.000 align:start position:0%
similar formula to what I was thinking
 
03:43:58.429 --> 03:43:58.439 align:start position:0%
about but it turns out so the formula is
 
03:44:01.030 --> 03:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
in I don't know where it is
 
03:44:01.040 --> 03:44:02.990 align:start position:0%
in I don't know where it is
but

03:44:02.990 --> 03:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:44:05.870 --> 03:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
31a 4 but it's not quite the same it's
 
03:44:07.710 --> 03:44:07.720 align:start position:0%
not really relevant I don't think I'd
 
03:44:09.830 --> 03:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
want to go back to my constituents and
 
03:44:12.429 --> 03:44:12.439 align:start position:0%
say that I repealed the revenue sharing
 
03:44:14.590 --> 03:44:14.600 align:start position:0%
portion of the statute I don't know how
 
03:44:16.349 --> 03:44:16.359 align:start position:0%
others feel but I don't think that would
 
03:44:17.550 --> 03:44:17.560 align:start position:0%
get a good
 
03:44:21.910 --> 03:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
reaction yes if we haven't used it since
 
03:44:25.229 --> 03:44:25.239 align:start position:0%
1996 yeah yeah but it's it takes away
 
03:44:27.790 --> 03:44:27.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:30.349 --> 03:44:30.359 align:start position:0%
option yeah you want to collect the tax
 
03:44:33.309 --> 03:44:33.319 align:start position:0%
on forbearing rabbits I it's my favorite
 
03:44:36.110 --> 03:44:36.120 align:start position:0%
thing well Dead or Alive to me it's
 
03:44:41.309 --> 03:44:41.319 align:start position:0%
right for for uh uh a second look but to
 
03:44:44.149 --> 03:44:44.159 align:start position:0%
just sit here and repeal it entirely as
 
03:44:46.630 --> 03:44:46.640 align:start position:0%
a little Ang inducing all right
 
03:44:49.070 --> 03:44:49.080 align:start position:0%
representative R um I I agree with
 
03:44:51.389 --> 03:44:51.399 align:start position:0%
representative evil but when I'm reading
 
03:44:54.469 --> 03:44:54.479 align:start position:0%
155 it just says suspension not repeal
 
03:44:56.590 --> 03:44:56.600 align:start position:0%
yeah it is but what he's saying is just
 
03:45:01.030 --> 03:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
to repeal it no no I I would accept 155
 
03:45:04.389 --> 03:45:04.399 align:start position:0%
the suspension but not not to change not
 
03:45:07.670 --> 03:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
to amend this to make it a
 
03:45:11.750 --> 03:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
repeal all right how does other people
 
03:45:11.760 --> 03:45:13.389 align:start position:0%
repeal all right how does other people
feel

03:45:13.389 --> 03:45:13.399 align:start position:0%
feel
 
03:45:15.710 --> 03:45:15.720 align:start position:0%
okay anybody else
 
03:45:18.630 --> 03:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
I would be okay with repealing it
 
03:45:21.950 --> 03:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
okay no repeal
 
03:45:21.960 --> 03:45:24.269 align:start position:0%
okay no repeal
repeal

03:45:24.269 --> 03:45:24.279 align:start position:0%
repeal
 
03:45:28.590 --> 03:45:28.600 align:start position:0%
huh Mr selectman okay yeah Mr selectman
 
03:45:31.429 --> 03:45:31.439 align:start position:0%
all right um now let me let me check
 
03:45:35.030 --> 03:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
something here because um the I wanted
 
03:45:38.149 --> 03:45:38.159 align:start position:0%
to look up whether some of these taxes
 
03:45:41.110 --> 03:45:41.120 align:start position:0%
it refers to are themselves
 
03:45:44.990 --> 03:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
repealed right because I think they are
 
03:45:47.790 --> 03:45:47.800 align:start position:0%
rabbit said I never pay a tax
 
03:45:51.990 --> 03:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
yeah so soct RSA I mean I had a lot of
 
03:45:53.189 --> 03:45:53.199 align:start position:0%
all right so let me write down a couple
 
03:45:56.389 --> 03:45:56.399 align:start position:0%
of these things right so it's um 73
 
03:45:56.399 --> 03:45:57.990 align:start position:0%
of these things right so it's um 73
colon

03:45:57.990 --> 03:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
colon
 
03:46:03.149 --> 03:46:03.159 align:start position:0%
26 all right um 72 colon
 
03:46:06.389 --> 03:46:06.399 align:start position:0%
17 72 colon
 
03:46:08.670 --> 03:46:08.680 align:start position:0%
16 all right because You' think they'd
 
03:46:10.349 --> 03:46:10.359 align:start position:0%
have to if they repeal that they'd have
 
03:46:12.590 --> 03:46:12.600 align:start position:0%
to repeal all the references to that
 
03:46:14.710 --> 03:46:14.720 align:start position:0%
right but it doesn't seem I feel like
 
03:46:18.590 --> 03:46:18.600 align:start position:0%
we're doing this on the FL Mr yeah well
 
03:46:21.070 --> 03:46:21.080 align:start position:0%
um we got a little time if we just
 
03:46:23.149 --> 03:46:23.159 align:start position:0%
suspend it it's suspending the revenue
 
03:46:25.309 --> 03:46:25.319 align:start position:0%
sharing there's nothing that doesn't say
 
03:46:29.030 --> 03:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
in the future yes if we keep it we could
 
03:46:33.070 --> 03:46:33.080 align:start position:0%
you know maybe Revenue share another tax
 
03:46:36.510 --> 03:46:36.520 align:start position:0%
okay so for example it refers to RSA 72
 
03:46:41.830 --> 03:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
colon 16 that was repealed on March 31st
 
03:46:45.309 --> 03:46:45.319 align:start position:0%
1970 I mean you know
 
03:46:45.319 --> 03:46:46.790 align:start position:0%
1970 I mean you know
tax

03:46:46.790 --> 03:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
tax
 
03:46:49.630 --> 03:46:49.640 align:start position:0%
yeah the the yeah
 
03:46:52.110 --> 03:46:52.120 align:start position:0%
the could we just like pause the
 
03:46:54.510 --> 03:46:54.520 align:start position:0%
decision for so we all would have an
 
03:46:56.830 --> 03:46:56.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to look at the statutes go
 
03:47:00.149 --> 03:47:00.159 align:start position:0%
Ahad that I mean it's kind of a big deal
 
03:47:02.550 --> 03:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
I think even though it hasn't been paid
 
03:47:04.510 --> 03:47:04.520 align:start position:0%
all right all right we will wait we'll
 
03:47:07.990 --> 03:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
come back that's fine all right now
 
03:47:13.469 --> 03:47:13.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:17.110 --> 03:47:17.120 align:start position:0%
uh oh okay so that was
 
03:47:21.469 --> 03:47:21.479 align:start position:0%
155 this is way
 
03:47:24.030 --> 03:47:24.040 align:start position:0%
156 oh this one's
 
03:47:28.670 --> 03:47:28.680 align:start position:0%
important so if we don't leave this
 
03:47:32.710 --> 03:47:32.720 align:start position:0%
in it will cost us another 30 million I
 
03:47:37.550 --> 03:47:37.560 align:start position:0%
think is the way it works because this
 
03:47:40.469 --> 03:47:40.479 align:start position:0%
it was Alec it was put in the budget a
 
03:47:46.630 --> 03:47:46.640 align:start position:0%
year ago to say in 20 f year 26 and 27
 
03:47:49.030 --> 03:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
you will spend you will allocate this so
 
03:47:51.830 --> 03:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
it's not like they set we set aside
 
03:47:54.990 --> 03:47:55.000 align:start position:0%
money for this it's it's a program spend
 
03:47:57.229 --> 03:47:57.239 align:start position:0%
right so so it's like it's a spend that
 
03:48:00.309 --> 03:48:00.319 align:start position:0%
will occur on such and such a date so
 
03:48:02.950 --> 03:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
this is a big deal
 
03:48:05.750 --> 03:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
um okay can we can somebody want to make
 
03:48:08.990 --> 03:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
a motion to accept section 156 I have a
 
03:48:12.590 --> 03:48:12.600 align:start position:0%
question we had a a public hearing on a
 
03:48:16.550 --> 03:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
bill to to fund
 
03:48:20.189 --> 03:48:20.199 align:start position:0%
so how how does that work well I don't I
 
03:48:22.269 --> 03:48:22.279 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to repeal this if that
 
03:48:25.189 --> 03:48:25.199 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't pass because I know in
 
03:48:28.070 --> 03:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
marac we we have a significant
 
03:48:31.030 --> 03:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plant we take we
 
03:48:33.630 --> 03:48:33.640 align:start position:0%
take waste from over a dozen communities
 
03:48:37.229 --> 03:48:37.239 align:start position:0%
and the state um to process and we rely
 
03:48:39.389 --> 03:48:39.399 align:start position:0%
on these state aid grants to help fund
 
03:48:42.349 --> 03:48:42.359 align:start position:0%
that if if this goes away the cost to
 
03:48:44.030 --> 03:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
those other communities is going to
 
03:48:45.910 --> 03:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
really jump
 
03:48:49.750 --> 03:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
this is adding money to The Loan Fund
 
03:48:55.030 --> 03:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
right so the Loan Fund is large and and
 
03:48:58.110 --> 03:48:58.120 align:start position:0%
we add a little bit every time right but
 
03:49:00.830 --> 03:49:00.840 align:start position:0%
but it keeps it can still make loans it
 
03:49:03.910 --> 03:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
just won't necessarily make the last few
 
03:49:06.790 --> 03:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
loans that that people ask for so
 
03:49:09.389 --> 03:49:09.399 align:start position:0%
representative evil um I actually had a
 
03:49:13.510 --> 03:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
very brief conversation with um bro sh
 
03:49:15.269 --> 03:49:15.279 align:start position:0%
or somebody from the Municipal
 
03:49:17.309 --> 03:49:17.319 align:start position:0%
Association there apparently is a
 
03:49:19.630 --> 03:49:19.640 align:start position:0%
backlog even though the grants haven't
 
03:49:21.990 --> 03:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
been made there is quite a substantial
 
03:49:25.349 --> 03:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
backlog for these grants but it didn't
 
03:49:27.790 --> 03:49:27.800 align:start position:0%
sound to me like it was this amount of
 
03:49:31.469 --> 03:49:31.479 align:start position:0%
money so if we greatly reduced it and
 
03:49:35.469 --> 03:49:35.479 align:start position:0%
maybe put 5 million in instead of 30
 
03:49:38.670 --> 03:49:38.680 align:start position:0%
maybe this backlog could be worked off
 
03:49:41.469 --> 03:49:41.479 align:start position:0%
or make a sub make some kind of effort
 
03:49:41.479 --> 03:49:42.670 align:start position:0%
or make a sub make some kind of effort
toward

03:49:42.670 --> 03:49:42.680 align:start position:0%
toward
 
03:49:45.309 --> 03:49:45.319 align:start position:0%
it other thoughts
 
03:49:46.990 --> 03:49:47.000 align:start position:0%
no he didn't like that thought yeah I
 
03:49:51.070 --> 03:49:51.080 align:start position:0%
don't because to me this this if you
 
03:49:53.349 --> 03:49:53.359 align:start position:0%
take this out or change it it's new
 
03:49:56.870 --> 03:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
spending right and so in my big list of
 
03:50:01.269 --> 03:50:01.279 align:start position:0%
new spending the thing at the top is the
 
03:50:05.950 --> 03:50:05.960 align:start position:0%
YDC uh settlement fund okay not
 
03:50:10.309 --> 03:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
this so um you
 
03:50:13.790 --> 03:50:13.800 align:start position:0%
know this isn't this is an easy cut it's
 
03:50:16.030 --> 03:50:16.040 align:start position:0%
not even really a cut because it's just
 
03:50:18.630 --> 03:50:18.640 align:start position:0%
don't spend don't don't appropriate
 
03:50:20.550 --> 03:50:20.560 align:start position:0%
right there's already existing funds
 
03:50:23.870 --> 03:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
there is a fund and uh and they also get
 
03:50:27.269 --> 03:50:27.279 align:start position:0%
money paid back so they into the fund so
 
03:50:29.349 --> 03:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
yeah they I think they can go without
 
03:50:32.990 --> 03:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
for two years okay all right can we vote
 
03:50:35.790 --> 03:50:35.800 align:start position:0%
on this yeah representative months but I
 
03:50:37.229 --> 03:50:37.239 align:start position:0%
I and I think this is what
 
03:50:38.990 --> 03:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
representative evil was getting at I
 
03:50:43.389 --> 03:50:43.399 align:start position:0%
mean I'm assuming that knowing that this
 
03:50:45.590 --> 03:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
would be available
 
03:50:49.110 --> 03:50:49.120 align:start position:0%
that there are projects in
 
03:50:53.670 --> 03:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
development um that um will not be able
 
03:50:55.269 --> 03:50:55.279 align:start position:0%
to go forward if we eliminate this
 
03:50:57.189 --> 03:50:57.199 align:start position:0%
source of
 
03:51:01.309 --> 03:51:01.319 align:start position:0%
funding so it would be good to know you
 
03:51:03.469 --> 03:51:03.479 align:start position:0%
know what's what is the backlog of
 
03:51:07.189 --> 03:51:07.199 align:start position:0%
projects yeah all right representative
 
03:51:09.870 --> 03:51:09.880 align:start position:0%
Campbell no I don't agree the grants
 
03:51:12.710 --> 03:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
haven't been made yet so nobody is
 
03:51:14.710 --> 03:51:14.720 align:start position:0%
counting on this money the only people
 
03:51:16.469 --> 03:51:16.479 align:start position:0%
that are counting on money are the ones
 
03:51:18.710 --> 03:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
that have already uh put in their
 
03:51:21.349 --> 03:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
applications where uh money was already
 
03:51:24.110 --> 03:51:24.120 align:start position:0%
available this is this money never got
 
03:51:26.189 --> 03:51:26.199 align:start position:0%
there so it shouldn't even be
 
03:51:30.030 --> 03:51:30.040 align:start position:0%
considered okay so rep all right one
 
03:51:33.110 --> 03:51:33.120 align:start position:0%
more um the reason I want to keep this
 
03:51:36.030 --> 03:51:36.040 align:start position:0%
in is there are pending EPA regulations
 
03:51:39.630 --> 03:51:39.640 align:start position:0%
on surface water discharge that will let
 
03:51:41.070 --> 03:51:41.080 align:start position:0%
I I know they're going to require
 
03:51:43.510 --> 03:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
upgrades to any Wastewater dis discharge
 
03:51:46.429 --> 03:51:46.439 align:start position:0%
plant that goes into public
 
03:51:48.990 --> 03:51:49.000 align:start position:0%
waterways and I'm thinking of the maram
 
03:51:51.830 --> 03:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
river I'd hate to put municipalities in
 
03:51:53.750 --> 03:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
the real bind that they have to comply
 
03:51:55.550 --> 03:51:55.560 align:start position:0%
with those regulations and there's no
 
03:51:58.269 --> 03:51:58.279 align:start position:0%
funding that they could tap to help out
 
03:52:00.830 --> 03:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:03.870 --> 03:52:03.880 align:start position:0%
expense represent evil yes sorry I mean
 
03:52:07.070 --> 03:52:07.080 align:start position:0%
I just want to say have it on the so
 
03:52:09.269 --> 03:52:09.279 align:start position:0%
I'll be opposing this uh motion to
 
03:52:12.030 --> 03:52:12.040 align:start position:0%
repeal it I understand 100% why you're
 
03:52:14.149 --> 03:52:14.159 align:start position:0%
moving ahead with it but I'm recalling
 
03:52:17.309 --> 03:52:17.319 align:start position:0%
the discussion that we had with Dees the
 
03:52:19.990 --> 03:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
testimony on the bugo buck bill whatever
 
03:52:22.830 --> 03:52:22.840 align:start position:0%
it was and I asked her very specifically
 
03:52:25.830 --> 03:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
if the ability to upgrade wastewater
 
03:52:28.950 --> 03:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
treatment plants uh related to housing
 
03:52:31.830 --> 03:52:31.840 align:start position:0%
expansion and she said very directly so
 
03:52:35.189 --> 03:52:35.199 align:start position:0%
there is a relationship from from that
 
03:52:37.429 --> 03:52:37.439 align:start position:0%
standpoint because if these uh treatment
 
03:52:39.950 --> 03:52:39.960 align:start position:0%
plants can't be repaired or upgraded
 
03:52:42.670 --> 03:52:42.680 align:start position:0%
their ability to take on more customers
 
03:52:45.550 --> 03:52:45.560 align:start position:0%
is affected so there's a there is
 
03:52:48.269 --> 03:52:48.279 align:start position:0%
another alternative to do like a much
 
03:52:51.710 --> 03:52:51.720 align:start position:0%
maybe five million instead of 30 but if
 
03:52:53.990 --> 03:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
you know I just wanted to put that out
 
03:52:57.149 --> 03:52:57.159 align:start position:0%
there okay anybody else like to speak on
 
03:53:01.110 --> 03:53:01.120 align:start position:0%
this no all right representative leean
 
03:53:03.309 --> 03:53:03.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman as much as I'd
 
03:53:06.149 --> 03:53:06.159 align:start position:0%
like to support the $15 million a year
 
03:53:08.990 --> 03:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
for 26 and 27 we just don't have the
 
03:53:11.990 --> 03:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
money we really don't we've got Buco
 
03:53:14.870 --> 03:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
bucks that bills is sitting in our pain
 
03:53:17.110 --> 03:53:17.120 align:start position:0%
pile so we could go back and pull on
 
03:53:20.309 --> 03:53:20.319 align:start position:0%
that but I'm concerned that we keep
 
03:53:21.950 --> 03:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
putting money there and giving false
 
03:53:23.510 --> 03:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
hope to people that we're going to fund
 
03:53:25.269 --> 03:53:25.279 align:start position:0%
these programs and we just don't have
 
03:53:29.870 --> 03:53:29.880 align:start position:0%
the money yeah okay so let's say
 
03:53:31.910 --> 03:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
representative Cambell's moves to accept
 
03:53:33.269 --> 03:53:33.279 align:start position:0%
want make sure I got the motion correct
 
03:53:37.750 --> 03:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
so would be um we want to repeal so that
 
03:53:40.229 --> 03:53:40.239 align:start position:0%
we get we accept
 
03:53:42.670 --> 03:53:42.680 align:start position:0%
Section yes make a motion to accept
 
03:53:44.870 --> 03:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
section 156
 
03:53:47.110 --> 03:53:47.120 align:start position:0%
okay so represent cell's moves that
 
03:53:49.429 --> 03:53:49.439 align:start position:0%
accept Section 156 seconded by represent
 
03:53:51.510 --> 03:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
Sweeny all those in favor please raise
 
03:53:56.269 --> 03:53:56.279 align:start position:0%
your hands all right four against three
 
03:53:59.630 --> 03:53:59.640 align:start position:0%
okay good five five to three sorry five
 
03:54:03.189 --> 03:54:03.199 align:start position:0%
and three am I not counting okay
 
03:54:06.469 --> 03:54:06.479 align:start position:0%
somebody somebody new showed
 
03:54:10.950 --> 03:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
up oh very good okay
 
03:54:10.960 --> 03:54:12.790 align:start position:0%
up oh very good okay
now

03:54:12.790 --> 03:54:12.800 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:54:18.830 --> 03:54:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:21.670 --> 03:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
158 is that right I think we accepted
 
03:54:25.550 --> 03:54:25.560 align:start position:0%
already 157 okay so
 
03:54:28.110 --> 03:54:28.120 align:start position:0%
158 so this one I'm concerned about
 
03:54:32.149 --> 03:54:32.159 align:start position:0%
because it it removes a fee I think
 
03:54:34.950 --> 03:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
these few section this
 
03:54:38.910 --> 03:54:38.920 align:start position:0%
section um and the 160 both seem to
 
03:54:38.920 --> 03:54:40.349 align:start position:0%
section um and the 160 both seem to
remove

03:54:40.349 --> 03:54:40.359 align:start position:0%
remove
 
03:54:42.590 --> 03:54:42.600 align:start position:0%
fees do you know how much money is
 
03:54:44.990 --> 03:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
involved no
 
03:54:47.469 --> 03:54:47.479 align:start position:0%
I don't know why Melissa no I don't on
 
03:54:47.479 --> 03:54:48.309 align:start position:0%
I don't know why Melissa no I don't on
this

03:54:48.309 --> 03:54:48.319 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:54:51.630 --> 03:54:51.640 align:start position:0%
one right maybe you can find out for 158
 
03:54:55.389 --> 03:54:55.399 align:start position:0%
and 160 now
 
03:54:59.510 --> 03:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
159 we were told that the decal program
 
03:55:02.070 --> 03:55:02.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't pay for itself right so that's
 
03:55:03.590 --> 03:55:03.600 align:start position:0%
that's this
 
03:55:06.910 --> 03:55:06.920 align:start position:0%
one but Mr chair I know that um there is
 
03:55:09.990 --> 03:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
a conversation going on between Dees and
 
03:55:12.229 --> 03:55:12.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire lakes and we had asked
 
03:55:14.630 --> 03:55:14.640 align:start position:0%
Dees specifically to get back to to us
 
03:55:17.990 --> 03:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
on that so I would not want to repeal it
 
03:55:20.830 --> 03:55:20.840 align:start position:0%
right now okay because there was but I I
 
03:55:23.030 --> 03:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
don't think we really want to repeal it
 
03:55:25.870 --> 03:55:25.880 align:start position:0%
D wanted to yeah they do want to repeal
 
03:55:27.990 --> 03:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
it but New Hampshire Lakes is saying
 
03:55:29.670 --> 03:55:29.680 align:start position:0%
that it's about to turn a corner and
 
03:55:31.750 --> 03:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
make money and they were going to have a
 
03:55:34.550 --> 03:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
conversation Adam agreed to speak with
 
03:55:37.670 --> 03:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
them and I I know that that is happening
 
03:55:39.550 --> 03:55:39.560 align:start position:0%
so it just seems like since we already
 
03:55:42.229 --> 03:55:42.239 align:start position:0%
said but I don't remember them even
 
03:55:46.469 --> 03:55:46.479 align:start position:0%
talking about 158 and 160 repeal I don't
 
03:55:48.870 --> 03:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
really understand exactly what's going
 
03:55:53.110 --> 03:55:53.120 align:start position:0%
on talked about 160 I don't have a recol
 
03:55:54.510 --> 03:55:54.520 align:start position:0%
recollection of
 
03:55:57.950 --> 03:55:57.960 align:start position:0%
158 yeah I just I don't know why they're
 
03:56:01.309 --> 03:56:01.319 align:start position:0%
doing that okay so we'll get a we'll get
 
03:56:04.790 --> 03:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
some I just more information I guess
 
03:56:07.510 --> 03:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
okay 161 so we're going to wait slightly
 
03:56:15.229 --> 03:56:15.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:18.149 --> 03:56:18.159 align:start position:0%
Mr yes um
 
03:56:18.159 --> 03:56:19.750 align:start position:0%
Mr yes um
regarding

03:56:19.750 --> 03:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
03:56:22.990 --> 03:56:23.000 align:start position:0%
159 um that did make money last year and
 
03:56:25.229 --> 03:56:25.239 align:start position:0%
I think to represent I mean I don't
 
03:56:27.710 --> 03:56:27.720 align:start position:0%
think we should if it's making money
 
03:56:29.750 --> 03:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
even if it's 4,000 I don't believe we
 
03:56:34.550 --> 03:56:34.560 align:start position:0%
should repeal it and I I I did talk to
 
03:56:36.910 --> 03:56:36.920 align:start position:0%
um Andrea Lomo about this from New
 
03:56:38.990 --> 03:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire lakes and she said the cost of
 
03:56:41.229 --> 03:56:41.239 align:start position:0%
administrating it has gone down greatly
 
03:56:43.590 --> 03:56:43.600 align:start position:0%
because they have the ability to accept
 
03:56:45.149 --> 03:56:45.159 align:start position:0%
credit cards
 
03:56:47.429 --> 03:56:47.439 align:start position:0%
and I guess not accepting credit cards
 
03:56:50.189 --> 03:56:50.199 align:start position:0%
add a lot to the cost so even if it's uh
 
03:56:53.510 --> 03:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:57.990 --> 03:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
$4,200 um that's why would we you know
 
03:56:59.750 --> 03:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
get rid of that if we don't have to it
 
03:57:01.550 --> 03:57:01.560 align:start position:0%
seem like it didn't really do much
 
03:57:03.149 --> 03:57:03.159 align:start position:0%
except sell people
 
03:57:05.990 --> 03:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
decals right I mean yeah but in the
 
03:57:08.590 --> 03:57:08.600 align:start position:0%
selling it raised money anyway I I just
 
03:57:11.149 --> 03:57:11.159 align:start position:0%
feel In fairness do Adam said he was
 
03:57:12.790 --> 03:57:12.800 align:start position:0%
going to talk to New Hampshire lakes and
 
03:57:15.110 --> 03:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
come back to us so all right
 
03:57:16.590 --> 03:57:16.600 align:start position:0%
um I don't I don't want to have a
 
03:57:18.309 --> 03:57:18.319 align:start position:0%
program that costs them money either
 
03:57:22.070 --> 03:57:22.080 align:start position:0%
Dees so we'll just um represent if New
 
03:57:23.630 --> 03:57:23.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legs can prove that they're
 
03:57:26.110 --> 03:57:26.120 align:start position:0%
making money I'm good with that and we
 
03:57:29.790 --> 03:57:29.800 align:start position:0%
but again I'm just curious what you know
 
03:57:31.950 --> 03:57:31.960 align:start position:0%
Dees was so adamant that they're not
 
03:57:34.950 --> 03:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
making money so and again I know Andrea
 
03:57:36.670 --> 03:57:36.680 align:start position:0%
very well from New Hampshire Lakes I'll
 
03:57:39.110 --> 03:57:39.120 align:start position:0%
trust her opinion so hope hopefully
 
03:57:40.510 --> 03:57:40.520 align:start position:0%
they'll come back to us pretty soon with
 
03:57:45.229 --> 03:57:45.239 align:start position:0%
that with that answer all right 160
 
03:57:48.269 --> 03:57:48.279 align:start position:0%
acquisition Maguire yes
 
03:57:50.830 --> 03:57:50.840 align:start position:0%
16 the department did speak of this one
 
03:57:53.469 --> 03:57:53.479 align:start position:0%
and they requested that to be
 
03:57:56.110 --> 03:57:56.120 align:start position:0%
deleted out of the section they put it
 
03:57:57.790 --> 03:57:57.800 align:start position:0%
they originally talked about putting it
 
03:57:59.349 --> 03:57:59.359 align:start position:0%
in and then there was a change in the
 
03:58:01.590 --> 03:58:01.600 align:start position:0%
federal funding so they were worried
 
03:58:02.950 --> 03:58:02.960 align:start position:0%
about receiving that Federal funding
 
03:58:04.309 --> 03:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
anymore and recommended that the
 
03:58:06.510 --> 03:58:06.520 align:start position:0%
language be deleted oh deleted is that
 
03:58:09.590 --> 03:58:09.600 align:start position:0%
in the um that's in the the long sheet
 
03:58:12.389 --> 03:58:12.399 align:start position:0%
that they the red line thing um no I
 
03:58:14.750 --> 03:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
think it's in the
 
03:58:17.910 --> 03:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
so they just want it deleted from
 
03:58:22.349 --> 03:58:22.359 align:start position:0%
hb2 okay well I'll make that motion okay
 
03:58:27.110 --> 03:58:27.120 align:start position:0%
160 yeah that we we remove um 160 from
 
03:58:28.830 --> 03:58:28.840 align:start position:0%
hb2 all
 
03:58:30.710 --> 03:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
right all right so move by
 
03:58:32.269 --> 03:58:32.279 align:start position:0%
representative evil second by
 
03:58:35.149 --> 03:58:35.159 align:start position:0%
representative rung to remove section
 
03:58:37.590 --> 03:58:37.600 align:start position:0%
160 all those in
 
03:58:42.269 --> 03:58:42.279 align:start position:0%
favor okay good all right that one's
 
03:58:44.870 --> 03:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
done all right so this one was crossed
 
03:58:49.710 --> 03:58:49.720 align:start position:0%
down okay um now 161 there's a different
 
03:58:52.590 --> 03:58:52.600 align:start position:0%
language on the red line form oh they're
 
03:58:54.790 --> 03:58:54.800 align:start position:0%

04:00:18.510 --> 04:00:18.520 align:start position:0%
okay there we go all right so I see so
 
04:00:25.790 --> 04:00:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:29.110 --> 04:00:29.120 align:start position:0%
167 okay so this is another one that has
 
04:00:31.429 --> 04:00:31.439 align:start position:0%
Auto automatic fee
 
04:00:39.830 --> 04:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:45.630 --> 04:00:45.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:48.950 --> 04:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
right so the sections it's starting July
 
04:00:51.590 --> 04:00:51.600 align:start position:0%
1st and so
 
04:00:55.870 --> 04:00:55.880 align:start position:0%
on Mr chair yes I wonder if if it would
 
04:00:59.149 --> 04:00:59.159 align:start position:0%
be more palatable to you because
 
04:01:02.630 --> 04:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
I I I do not like the idea of having
 
04:01:05.670 --> 04:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
bills come forth to do fee adjustments
 
04:01:07.309 --> 04:01:07.319 align:start position:0%
because it it takes a lot of time and
 
04:01:09.269 --> 04:01:09.279 align:start position:0%
energy on behalf of staff and
 
04:01:12.269 --> 04:01:12.279 align:start position:0%
representatives and whatever to have
 
04:01:14.389 --> 04:01:14.399 align:start position:0%
bills for fee increases so I'm wondering
 
04:01:20.149 --> 04:01:20.159 align:start position:0%
if like on line 12 on page 68 if we take
 
04:01:22.349 --> 04:01:22.359 align:start position:0%
out the word sh and put
 
04:01:26.149 --> 04:01:26.159 align:start position:0%
May would you be more satisfied with
 
04:01:32.070 --> 04:01:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:35.149 --> 04:01:35.159 align:start position:0%
will I thought I'd throw it out there
 
04:01:36.950 --> 04:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
okay I think we should be consistent we
 
04:01:39.269 --> 04:01:39.279 align:start position:0%
already killed it in another area and I
 
04:01:40.910 --> 04:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
would K I would vote I would move to
 
04:01:40.920 --> 04:01:41.790 align:start position:0%
would K I would vote I would move to
kill

04:01:41.790 --> 04:01:41.800 align:start position:0%
kill
 
04:01:46.189 --> 04:01:46.199 align:start position:0%
this second okay so does goad I'm sorry
 
04:01:48.710 --> 04:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
more discussion yes well no not I'm I
 
04:01:51.070 --> 04:01:51.080 align:start position:0%
think I'm afraid that ship is sailed so
 
04:01:52.950 --> 04:01:52.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to bark but the the the
 
04:01:54.189 --> 04:01:54.199 align:start position:0%
thing where it says the commissioner
 
04:01:57.710 --> 04:01:57.720 align:start position:0%
shall adopt rules does that relate to
 
04:02:00.149 --> 04:02:00.159 align:start position:0%
the whole paragraph or just where are we
 
04:02:02.630 --> 04:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
talking about it's the last bolded line
 
04:02:05.189 --> 04:02:05.199 align:start position:0%
it's line 16 it says the commissioner
 
04:02:07.830 --> 04:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
shall adopt rules to implement this
 
04:02:10.670 --> 04:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
paragraph So if we're deleting maybe we
 
04:02:12.030 --> 04:02:12.040 align:start position:0%
should just delete through the word
 
04:02:12.040 --> 04:02:14.110 align:start position:0%
should just delete through the word
dollar

04:02:14.110 --> 04:02:14.120 align:start position:0%
dollar
 
04:02:20.030 --> 04:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:22.590 --> 04:02:22.600 align:start position:0%
paragraph no no but the it has fee
 
04:02:24.910 --> 04:02:24.920 align:start position:0%
increases which presumably we're okay
 
04:02:27.110 --> 04:02:27.120 align:start position:0%
with yeah so I feel like the last
 
04:02:29.910 --> 04:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
sentence of the bolded language on 16
 
04:02:32.670 --> 04:02:32.680 align:start position:0%
and 17 we need to retain and the only
 
04:02:34.870 --> 04:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
thing we're deleting is the section that
 
04:02:38.710 --> 04:02:38.720 align:start position:0%
allows the increase CP I I sort of
 
04:02:42.510 --> 04:02:42.520 align:start position:0%
wonder why that sentence is necessary
 
04:02:45.030 --> 04:02:45.040 align:start position:0%
because in general Commissioners adopt
 
04:02:47.429 --> 04:02:47.439 align:start position:0%
rules when we make Law changes right I
 
04:02:50.110 --> 04:02:50.120 align:start position:0%
mean so do we really need to say so Here
 
04:02:51.389 --> 04:02:51.399 align:start position:0%
There and
 
04:02:54.910 --> 04:02:54.920 align:start position:0%
Everywhere yeah so I think it's I think
 
04:02:56.830 --> 04:02:56.840 align:start position:0%
that is just they put in this
 
04:02:59.590 --> 04:02:59.600 align:start position:0%
boilerplate for the Consumer Price thing
 
04:03:00.950 --> 04:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
right because all of them are reading
 
04:03:00.960 --> 04:03:01.710 align:start position:0%
right because all of them are reading
that

04:03:01.710 --> 04:03:01.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:03:06.309 --> 04:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
way um just K starting well and the same
 
04:03:08.229 --> 04:03:08.239 align:start position:0%
thing is true
 
04:03:10.830 --> 04:03:10.840 align:start position:0%
for uh the next one on
 
04:03:16.070 --> 04:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
page uh 168 section 168 exactly the same
 
04:03:17.550 --> 04:03:17.560 align:start position:0%
well presumably they're going to watch
 
04:03:19.550 --> 04:03:19.560 align:start position:0%
the live stream if they've got heartburn
 
04:03:21.389 --> 04:03:21.399 align:start position:0%
over it I'm sure they'll let us know we
 
04:03:24.590 --> 04:03:24.600 align:start position:0%
can change okay all right so so on
 
04:03:27.830 --> 04:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
Section 167 representative campell's
 
04:03:31.630 --> 04:03:31.640 align:start position:0%
moves that we accept this section but
 
04:03:35.750 --> 04:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
eliminate uh the um bolded langage the
 
04:03:38.830 --> 04:03:38.840 align:start position:0%
bolded language the two sentences uh
 
04:03:41.990 --> 04:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
starting on line 11 of of page 68
 
04:03:45.830 --> 04:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
starting July 1st and so on down through
 
04:03:49.510 --> 04:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
this paragraph right line 17 yes through
 
04:03:52.830 --> 04:03:52.840 align:start position:0%
line 17 yeah everybody clear what we're
 
04:03:55.870 --> 04:03:55.880 align:start position:0%
voting on oh who seconded this I second
 
04:03:58.110 --> 04:03:58.120 align:start position:0%
okay representative Griffin second all
 
04:04:03.670 --> 04:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
right all those in favor yes okay we got
 
04:04:08.950 --> 04:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
five and against opposed opposed opposed
 
04:04:11.070 --> 04:04:11.080 align:start position:0%
no I'm I'll I'll you're in favor I'll go
 
04:04:14.590 --> 04:04:14.600 align:start position:0%
six to two okay very good so
 
04:04:17.030 --> 04:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
now this was
 
04:04:17.040 --> 04:04:18.590 align:start position:0%
now this was
section

04:04:18.590 --> 04:04:18.600 align:start position:0%
section
 
04:04:25.030 --> 04:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
167 okay 167 so now we have same thing
 
04:04:25.040 --> 04:04:27.030 align:start position:0%
167 okay 167 so now we have same thing
in

04:04:27.030 --> 04:04:27.040 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:04:27.040 --> 04:04:29.110 align:start position:0%
in
168

04:04:29.110 --> 04:04:29.120 align:start position:0%
168
 
04:04:33.550 --> 04:04:33.560 align:start position:0%
right so do you want to make your same
 
04:04:37.309 --> 04:04:37.319 align:start position:0%
motion make I'll make the same motion to
 
04:04:43.070 --> 04:04:43.080 align:start position:0%
uh on Section 168 okay so all right so
 
04:04:45.189 --> 04:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
moved uh by representative cell second
 
04:04:47.349 --> 04:04:47.359 align:start position:0%
by representative Sweeney to accept
 
04:04:52.710 --> 04:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
Section 168 uh after removing paragraph
 
04:04:52.720 --> 04:04:57.990 align:start position:0%
Section 168 uh after removing paragraph
Roman

04:04:57.990 --> 04:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:01.910 --> 04:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
2-a okay and I will just wage my
 
04:05:04.870 --> 04:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
opposition to removing that paragraph I
 
04:05:07.070 --> 04:05:07.080 align:start position:0%
I mean with some you know I suggested
 
04:05:09.389 --> 04:05:09.399 align:start position:0%
language changes like adjusting and
 
04:05:12.950 --> 04:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
changing but I just think it makes sense
 
04:05:14.309 --> 04:05:14.319 align:start position:0%
to have
 
04:05:15.950 --> 04:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
and I think it was fiscal committee was
 
04:05:17.990 --> 04:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
going to be reviewing these too so it
 
04:05:20.349 --> 04:05:20.359 align:start position:0%
wasn't as though we there it was out of
 
04:05:22.910 --> 04:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
the legislative process but to have
 
04:05:25.990 --> 04:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
separate bills to adjust fees for
 
04:05:28.110 --> 04:05:28.120 align:start position:0%
inflation when we could have the fiscal
 
04:05:30.710 --> 04:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
committee do it to me it's it's just a
 
04:05:34.269 --> 04:05:34.279 align:start position:0%
waste of time and money um for us to go
 
04:05:36.229 --> 04:05:36.239 align:start position:0%
through the bill process to make those
 
04:05:38.750 --> 04:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
types of adjustments I just have to say
 
04:05:40.590 --> 04:05:40.600 align:start position:0%
my piece Mr
 
04:05:43.469 --> 04:05:43.479 align:start position:0%
chair I disagree with that because I
 
04:05:45.990 --> 04:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
think think of the state's running a
 
04:05:48.229 --> 04:05:48.239 align:start position:0%
surplus we should be trying to give the
 
04:05:50.149 --> 04:05:50.159 align:start position:0%
money back to the people in the state
 
04:05:52.030 --> 04:05:52.040 align:start position:0%
and one way to give it back is not
 
04:05:56.750 --> 04:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
increase fees or lower fees
 
04:05:56.760 --> 04:05:58.269 align:start position:0%
increase fees or lower fees
even

04:05:58.269 --> 04:05:58.279 align:start position:0%
even
 
04:06:01.469 --> 04:06:01.479 align:start position:0%
yeah represent yeah um representative
 
04:06:03.830 --> 04:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
Griffin that's why I suggested that
 
04:06:06.030 --> 04:06:06.040 align:start position:0%
language change it wouldn't necessarily
 
04:06:07.790 --> 04:06:07.800 align:start position:0%
increase I was just saying that they'd
 
04:06:12.189 --> 04:06:12.199 align:start position:0%
be adjusted so if if costs go down then
 
04:06:14.670 --> 04:06:14.680 align:start position:0%
the fees would go down but every two
 
04:06:17.070 --> 04:06:17.080 align:start position:0%
years it we we would look at that
 
04:06:20.429 --> 04:06:20.439 align:start position:0%
Consumer Price Index and make should do
 
04:06:22.670 --> 04:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
that bees would okay and that's just a
 
04:06:24.309 --> 04:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
difference of opinion can all right one
 
04:06:27.189 --> 04:06:27.199 align:start position:0%
at a time representative evil I know a
 
04:06:29.349 --> 04:06:29.359 align:start position:0%
motion is already on the floor but
 
04:06:31.110 --> 04:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
another alternative is that
 
04:06:33.149 --> 04:06:33.159 align:start position:0%
representative rung could make a motion
 
04:06:35.030 --> 04:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
for an amendment to the language
 
04:06:37.590 --> 04:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
reflecting what you're saying and then
 
04:06:39.590 --> 04:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
we could vote on that and if that goes
 
04:06:42.870 --> 04:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
down then we could you know whatever it
 
04:06:45.510 --> 04:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
was an idea representative
 
04:06:47.710 --> 04:06:47.720 align:start position:0%
leean well thank you Mr chairman it's
 
04:06:50.950 --> 04:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
someone that's been on fiscal for years
 
04:06:53.830 --> 04:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
it's a big responsibility for just 10
 
04:06:56.110 --> 04:06:56.120 align:start position:0%
people that try to track every
 
04:06:58.750 --> 04:06:58.760 align:start position:0%
legislative intent that may come forward
 
04:07:01.229 --> 04:07:01.239 align:start position:0%
I think putting the process before full
 
04:07:03.710 --> 04:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
legislative review makes a lot more
 
04:07:06.670 --> 04:07:06.680 align:start position:0%
sense and putting something like this
 
04:07:08.469 --> 04:07:08.479 align:start position:0%
again before fisal because we have a
 
04:07:12.469 --> 04:07:12.479 align:start position:0%
pretty full agenda every month okay all
 
04:07:15.389 --> 04:07:15.399 align:start position:0%
right why don't we vote on this motion
 
04:07:18.990 --> 04:07:19.000 align:start position:0%
okay um so again we're we're accepting
 
04:07:23.830 --> 04:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
section uh 168 accept for paragraph 2-a
 
04:07:25.750 --> 04:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
okay all those in
 
04:07:29.469 --> 04:07:29.479 align:start position:0%
favor I'm going to be inconsistent okay
 
04:07:33.950 --> 04:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
all right and opposed okay five to three
 
04:07:38.870 --> 04:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
thank you okay next proga
 
04:07:41.030 --> 04:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
yeah all right and we have the same
 
04:07:44.790 --> 04:07:44.800 align:start position:0%
thing in 169 or very
 
04:07:44.800 --> 04:07:46.830 align:start position:0%
thing in 169 or very
similar

04:07:46.830 --> 04:07:46.840 align:start position:0%
similar
 
04:07:51.830 --> 04:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
um yeah it's basically the same thing
 
04:07:54.229 --> 04:07:54.239 align:start position:0%
and except that the appending paragraph
 
04:07:57.550 --> 04:07:57.560 align:start position:0%
is still called paragraph
 
04:08:02.429 --> 04:08:02.439 align:start position:0%
2- strangely enough okay
 
04:08:08.910 --> 04:08:08.920 align:start position:0%
um so make a motion to to accept Section
 
04:08:17.269 --> 04:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:19.389 --> 04:08:19.399 align:start position:0%
okay more discussion all right
 
04:08:21.070 --> 04:08:21.080 align:start position:0%
representative I'm going to give I'm
 
04:08:22.830 --> 04:08:22.840 align:start position:0%
going to give representative rung a
 
04:08:25.590 --> 04:08:25.600 align:start position:0%
break in expressing her
 
04:08:28.309 --> 04:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
opposition I'll express it I'll Express
 
04:08:31.030 --> 04:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
mine um okay uh for all the reasons that
 
04:08:33.950 --> 04:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
she's mentioned previously I think it um
 
04:08:36.670 --> 04:08:36.680 align:start position:0%
it makes perfect sense to um have these
 
04:08:39.389 --> 04:08:39.399 align:start position:0%
reviewed annually and um and then give
 
04:08:41.109 --> 04:08:41.119 align:start position:0%
to the fiscal committee for their final
 
04:08:44.149 --> 04:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
review right but I I would say
 
04:08:46.510 --> 04:08:46.520 align:start position:0%
feel free to put in a bill to add these
 
04:08:50.349 --> 04:08:50.359 align:start position:0%
sections back in next year right okay
 
04:08:51.670 --> 04:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
because they wouldn't take a fact
 
04:08:54.670 --> 04:08:54.680 align:start position:0%
anyways all right all those in favor of
 
04:08:58.309 --> 04:08:58.319 align:start position:0%
this motion raise your hands all right
 
04:09:01.910 --> 04:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
we got five against three okay five to
 
04:09:05.510 --> 04:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
three all right that's
 
04:09:10.109 --> 04:09:10.119 align:start position:0%
169 good all right 170 we're getting for
 
04:09:10.119 --> 04:09:12.070 align:start position:0%
169 good all right 170 we're getting for
the

04:09:12.070 --> 04:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:09:14.469 --> 04:09:14.479 align:start position:0%
here all right
 
04:09:17.630 --> 04:09:17.640 align:start position:0%
right what's that
 
04:09:19.950 --> 04:09:19.960 align:start position:0%
170 we accepted
 
04:09:23.630 --> 04:09:23.640 align:start position:0%
170 did we accept 171 no
 
04:09:27.269 --> 04:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
no is that us no we did accept 1 yeah we
 
04:09:29.990 --> 04:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
did one yeah I'm talking about
 
04:09:32.670 --> 04:09:32.680 align:start position:0%
171 I have it says the word hold what
 
04:09:34.149 --> 04:09:34.159 align:start position:0%
does that mean we're looking for an
 
04:09:36.389 --> 04:09:36.399 align:start position:0%
amendment no we were I think we were
 
04:09:39.109 --> 04:09:39.119 align:start position:0%
looking to see when the last time once
 
04:09:41.389 --> 04:09:41.399 align:start position:0%
was this was amended but the other
 
04:09:43.109 --> 04:09:43.119 align:start position:0%
discussion we had correct me if I'm
 
04:09:43.119 --> 04:09:43.990 align:start position:0%
discussion we had correct me if I'm
wrong

04:09:43.990 --> 04:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
04:09:45.870 --> 04:09:45.880 align:start position:0%
was that the standard for the fiscal
 
04:09:48.750 --> 04:09:48.760 align:start position:0%
committee was $100,000 and this was
 
04:09:52.710 --> 04:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
confirming conforming this for for GN C
 
04:09:55.910 --> 04:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
which to me made sense I would that's
 
04:09:58.070 --> 04:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
exactly right it's just CLE it was just
 
04:10:01.750 --> 04:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
cleaning up it's just clean up pursu I'd
 
04:10:04.269 --> 04:10:04.279 align:start position:0%
like to make a motion to accept
 
04:10:07.349 --> 04:10:07.359 align:start position:0%
171 okay we have a second I'll second
 
04:10:09.149 --> 04:10:09.159 align:start position:0%
not second all right motion made by
 
04:10:10.389 --> 04:10:10.399 align:start position:0%
representative evil second by
 
04:10:12.469 --> 04:10:12.479 align:start position:0%
representative cambrell to accept House
 
04:10:16.109 --> 04:10:16.119 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 Section 1 171 all those in
 
04:10:19.750 --> 04:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
favor okay any post all right unanimous
 
04:10:24.349 --> 04:10:24.359 align:start position:0%
good now all right so this one's
 
04:10:30.030 --> 04:10:30.040 align:start position:0%
okay so that one's okay and
 
04:10:35.469 --> 04:10:35.479 align:start position:0%
172 oh I I said I would ask so I did so
 
04:10:38.830 --> 04:10:38.840 align:start position:0%
um this is the one that on the face
 
04:10:40.750 --> 04:10:40.760 align:start position:0%
looks like we're creating all kinds of
 
04:10:42.389 --> 04:10:42.399 align:start position:0%
work for the Department of
 
04:10:44.630 --> 04:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
administrative service Services because
 
04:10:46.109 --> 04:10:46.119 align:start position:0%
they would have to
 
04:10:49.590 --> 04:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
approve um all transfers of funds within
 
04:10:52.149 --> 04:10:52.159 align:start position:0%
and among all accounting
 
04:10:54.630 --> 04:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
units in every
 
04:10:57.630 --> 04:10:57.640 align:start position:0%
department so um so I asked him about it
 
04:10:59.070 --> 04:10:59.080 align:start position:0%
and he says well we're already doing
 
04:11:01.469 --> 04:11:01.479 align:start position:0%
that anyway so it's
 
04:11:04.349 --> 04:11:04.359 align:start position:0%
like they like this and they and they
 
04:11:06.550 --> 04:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
have somebody who does this this is
 
04:11:10.109 --> 04:11:10.119 align:start position:0%
their job right to uh to handle all
 
04:11:13.389 --> 04:11:13.399 align:start position:0%
these these transfers and I think it's
 
04:11:16.630 --> 04:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
just part of it's kind of a double check
 
04:11:18.830 --> 04:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
to make sure that when they say I want
 
04:11:20.830 --> 04:11:20.840 align:start position:0%
to move from here to there that person
 
04:11:23.630 --> 04:11:23.640 align:start position:0%
is is in charge of making sure that
 
04:11:25.830 --> 04:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
there is money here and you know and
 
04:11:27.590 --> 04:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
there is space there and you know that
 
04:11:30.550 --> 04:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
kind of thing so he was happy with it I
 
04:11:32.990 --> 04:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
guess I'm okay with it motion to accept
 
04:11:36.870 --> 04:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
section 172 okay I'll second it okay so
 
04:11:38.630 --> 04:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
a motion by representative cell and
 
04:11:40.670 --> 04:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative eil to accept
 
04:11:44.790 --> 04:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
section 172 of House Bill 2 all those in
 
04:11:50.189 --> 04:11:50.199 align:start position:0%
favor okay unanimous okay good so that
 
04:11:53.229 --> 04:11:53.239 align:start position:0%
one's done next one Capital project
 
04:11:56.550 --> 04:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
overview committee okay page 17 number
 
04:12:01.109 --> 04:12:01.119 align:start position:0%
175 right um so represent representative
 
04:12:03.389 --> 04:12:03.399 align:start position:0%
Wier and I are on the capital project
 
04:12:07.710 --> 04:12:07.720 align:start position:0%
overview committee so um we met recently
 
04:12:09.670 --> 04:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
and I raised this section with the
 
04:12:11.830 --> 04:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
committee the thing is that the
 
04:12:14.510 --> 04:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
committee is responsible for reviewing
 
04:12:16.910 --> 04:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
capital projects and there's a quarterly
 
04:12:21.229 --> 04:12:21.239 align:start position:0%
report prepared by Dees Das presently
 
04:12:23.389 --> 04:12:23.399 align:start position:0%
and this would change the quarterly
 
04:12:26.109 --> 04:12:26.119 align:start position:0%
report to an annual report and the
 
04:12:30.670 --> 04:12:30.680 align:start position:0%
members of the cpoc opposed that change
 
04:12:34.070 --> 04:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
so they want to leave it as quarterly
 
04:12:37.790 --> 04:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
but the thing that has to be fixed in
 
04:12:40.590 --> 04:12:40.600 align:start position:0%
this is that on line
 
04:12:43.429 --> 04:12:43.439 align:start position:0%
nine there's still the word budget on
 
04:12:46.630 --> 04:12:46.640 align:start position:0%
line 20 there's still the word budget
 
04:12:50.429 --> 04:12:50.439 align:start position:0%
and on 27 there's still the word budget
 
04:12:54.229 --> 04:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
and if you keep it as the capital budget
 
04:12:57.870 --> 04:12:57.880 align:start position:0%
project then you undermine the purpose
 
04:13:00.309 --> 04:13:00.319 align:start position:0%
for the change that we made in this in
 
04:13:03.030 --> 04:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
the last bium and that is that all
 
04:13:04.990 --> 04:13:05.000 align:start position:0%
capital projects should be reviewed
 
04:13:07.229 --> 04:13:07.239 align:start position:0%
whether they come through the capital
 
04:13:08.950 --> 04:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
budget or they come through the
 
04:13:12.710 --> 04:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
operating budget so and I've talked to
 
04:13:15.870 --> 04:13:15.880 align:start position:0%
Mr about it and I mean it shouldn't give
 
04:13:18.750 --> 04:13:18.760 align:start position:0%
anybody any heartburn it's basically
 
04:13:20.510 --> 04:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
corrective right right right so you want
 
04:13:22.750 --> 04:13:22.760 align:start position:0%
to take just say the word Capital
 
04:13:25.349 --> 04:13:25.359 align:start position:0%
project as opposed to capital budget
 
04:13:27.670 --> 04:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
project gotcha and I had talked to
 
04:13:30.269 --> 04:13:30.279 align:start position:0%
meliss about it okay so basically this
 
04:13:33.070 --> 04:13:33.080 align:start position:0%
is a a replacement the only the only
 
04:13:35.389 --> 04:13:35.399 align:start position:0%
change in this is that we're removing
 
04:13:38.950 --> 04:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
the word project in the three place or
 
04:13:41.030 --> 04:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
budget in the places I mentioned so
 
04:13:42.349 --> 04:13:42.359 align:start position:0%
what's the advantage of doing this
 
04:13:44.269 --> 04:13:44.279 align:start position:0%
quarterly in instead of
 
04:13:47.630 --> 04:13:47.640 align:start position:0%
annually the well it's the same thing
 
04:13:49.630 --> 04:13:49.640 align:start position:0%
like fiscal committee or anything like
 
04:13:52.950 --> 04:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
this this is a this is a committee that
 
04:13:57.109 --> 04:13:57.119 align:start position:0%
reviews capital projects and you know
 
04:13:59.790 --> 04:13:59.800 align:start position:0%
it's a certain amount of responsibility
 
04:14:04.109 --> 04:14:04.119 align:start position:0%
and work for das to prepare this list
 
04:14:05.870 --> 04:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
but if you don't have the list then you
 
04:14:10.750 --> 04:14:10.760 align:start position:0%
can't really um review it I did say to
 
04:14:13.950 --> 04:14:13.960 align:start position:0%
the members there which it's a joint
 
04:14:16.550 --> 04:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
committee maybe we could go to semi
 
04:14:20.070 --> 04:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
annually and people just weren't for it
 
04:14:23.990 --> 04:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
so I'm I mean oh speaking for myself so
 
04:14:27.309 --> 04:14:27.319 align:start position:0%
in some sense we're making more we're
 
04:14:31.070 --> 04:14:31.080 align:start position:0%
we're not this as as written would make
 
04:14:32.590 --> 04:14:32.600 align:start position:0%
less work for the Department of
 
04:14:34.030 --> 04:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
administrative Services yeah because
 
04:14:36.269 --> 04:14:36.279 align:start position:0%
they'd only have to do it annually as
 
04:14:39.950 --> 04:14:39.960 align:start position:0%
opposed to quarterly okay which is what
 
04:14:42.590 --> 04:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
so it's basically leaving the status quo
 
04:14:44.630 --> 04:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
I'm just cleaning up The Language by
 
04:14:46.910 --> 04:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
removing the word project which we did
 
04:14:49.389 --> 04:14:49.399 align:start position:0%
in different sections but we forgot to
 
04:14:53.950 --> 04:14:53.960 align:start position:0%
do it here right so how do people feel
 
04:14:55.710 --> 04:14:55.720 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm happy with the cross out of
 
04:14:58.750 --> 04:14:58.760 align:start position:0%
budget but how do people feel about the
 
04:15:00.710 --> 04:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
annual versus
 
04:15:04.149 --> 04:15:04.159 align:start position:0%
quarterly aspect of it are we it's
 
04:15:06.269 --> 04:15:06.279 align:start position:0%
probably not a big deal or what yeah I
 
04:15:08.830 --> 04:15:08.840 align:start position:0%
think I think representative evil
 
04:15:11.590 --> 04:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
explained it well okay that the board
 
04:15:14.630 --> 04:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
probably needs it they want it let give
 
04:15:17.790 --> 04:15:17.800 align:start position:0%
okay all right it's no it's no new work
 
04:15:20.389 --> 04:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
I guess no no it's no new work I mean if
 
04:15:23.389 --> 04:15:23.399 align:start position:0%
people wanted I mean I the thing is I I
 
04:15:26.070 --> 04:15:26.080 align:start position:0%
would have a hard time voting against
 
04:15:28.790 --> 04:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
what the people on that committee really
 
04:15:31.630 --> 04:15:31.640 align:start position:0%
want the but as I say the there's a
 
04:15:33.830 --> 04:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
halfway measure here you could do it se
 
04:15:37.910 --> 04:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
you know semiannually but I I think
 
04:15:42.149 --> 04:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
um and chair Wier is on that with me I
 
04:15:44.750 --> 04:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
think they would be upset if we change
 
04:15:46.630 --> 04:15:46.640 align:start position:0%
it oh was he there when you talked to
 
04:15:48.950 --> 04:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
about oh yes he I was sitting right next
 
04:15:51.790 --> 04:15:51.800 align:start position:0%
to him and I said remember this and hb2
 
04:15:54.670 --> 04:15:54.680 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and we talked about it okay so
 
04:15:56.550 --> 04:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
everybody wanted everybody liked it all
 
04:15:59.309 --> 04:15:59.319 align:start position:0%
right so um so
 
04:16:04.349 --> 04:16:04.359 align:start position:0%
representative evil moves uh Amendment
 
04:16:10.349 --> 04:16:10.359 align:start position:0%
808h yes um to replace section 175 in
 
04:16:13.269 --> 04:16:13.279 align:start position:0%

04:16:53.439 --> 04:16:56.670 align:start position:0%
 
176

04:16:56.670 --> 04:16:56.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:00.790 --> 04:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
um oh changing uh a little bit less
 
04:17:03.750 --> 04:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
money in this fund here so the first
 
04:17:07.189 --> 04:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
section a um is just changing from 6
 
04:17:09.710 --> 04:17:09.720 align:start position:0%
months to 3 months and operationally uh
 
04:17:12.349 --> 04:17:12.359 align:start position:0%
Das says that they think three is
 
04:17:15.590 --> 04:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
sufficient so that was that change okay
 
04:17:18.070 --> 04:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
and then in Part B was making it
 
04:17:18.080 --> 04:17:40.470 align:start position:0%
and then in Part B was making it
non-linguist

04:17:40.470 --> 04:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:40.480 --> 04:17:43.469 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:17:43.469 --> 04:17:43.479 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:17:51.469 --> 04:17:51.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:51.479 --> 04:17:56.469 align:start position:0%
 
177

04:17:56.469 --> 04:17:56.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:59.109 --> 04:17:59.119 align:start position:0%
um after
 
04:17:59.119 --> 04:18:03.349 align:start position:0%
um after
ex

04:18:03.349 --> 04:18:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:06.030 --> 04:18:06.040 align:start position:0%
oh I have a note on that Mr chair yes go
 
04:18:08.070 --> 04:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
ahead find out why it's needed did
 
04:18:15.830 --> 04:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:18.309 --> 04:18:18.319 align:start position:0%
still pending still pending all right we
 
04:18:21.109 --> 04:18:21.119 align:start position:0%
will wait then yeah it seems kind of
 
04:18:28.630 --> 04:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:31.830 --> 04:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
wait by the retirement
 
04:18:33.710 --> 04:18:33.720 align:start position:0%
system oh yeah we talked to the
 
04:18:36.030 --> 04:18:36.040 align:start position:0%
retirement system about this didn't
 
04:18:36.040 --> 04:18:38.269 align:start position:0%
retirement system about this didn't
we

04:18:38.269 --> 04:18:38.279 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:18:41.349 --> 04:18:41.359 align:start position:0%
yeah all right
 
04:18:44.349 --> 04:18:44.359 align:start position:0%
um Okay so we're going to wait on this
 
04:18:48.429 --> 04:18:48.439 align:start position:0%
one yes sir represent Griffin I'm
 
04:18:51.910 --> 04:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
wondering how this changes what we do
 
04:18:55.030 --> 04:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
currently is anybody aware
 
04:19:01.790 --> 04:19:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:03.750 --> 04:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
penalties that's the question that we
 
04:19:05.910 --> 04:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
have out to das New Hampshire retirement
 
04:19:07.830 --> 04:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
wasn't familiar as to why this was in
 
04:19:11.070 --> 04:19:11.080 align:start position:0%
their Das we asked those questions to
 
04:19:12.910 --> 04:19:12.920 align:start position:0%
them so we're still waiting on an answer
 
04:19:13.990 --> 04:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
we think it just got missed because they
 
04:19:15.670 --> 04:19:15.680 align:start position:0%
said maybe it's it just come from the
 
04:19:18.229 --> 04:19:18.239 align:start position:0%
general fund probably it's probably a
 
04:19:20.389 --> 04:19:20.399 align:start position:0%
transfer but we'd like to confirm one
 
04:19:23.349 --> 04:19:23.359 align:start position:0%
okay all right we'll find out all right
 
04:19:25.469 --> 04:19:25.479 align:start position:0%
now we're down to
 
04:19:25.479 --> 04:19:28.469 align:start position:0%
now we're down to
section

04:19:28.469 --> 04:19:28.479 align:start position:0%
section
 
04:19:34.590 --> 04:19:34.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:37.429 --> 04:19:37.439 align:start position:0%
73 all right
 
04:19:42.349 --> 04:19:42.359 align:start position:0%
um okay so this one I didn't care for
 
04:19:45.710 --> 04:19:45.720 align:start position:0%
with notify I think I think the fiscal
 
04:19:48.229 --> 04:19:48.239 align:start position:0%
committee should weigh in on doing
 
04:19:48.239 --> 04:19:51.550 align:start position:0%
committee should weigh in on doing
this

04:19:51.550 --> 04:19:51.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:53.630 --> 04:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
right this is
 
04:19:58.030 --> 04:19:58.040 align:start position:0%
allowing um the state comproller to
 
04:20:00.710 --> 04:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
Simply take money from the rainy day
 
04:20:04.670 --> 04:20:04.680 align:start position:0%
fund Mr chair speak with Mike Kane about
 
04:20:05.830 --> 04:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
that and you do have an amendment
 
04:20:07.630 --> 04:20:07.640 align:start position:0%
drafted if you want great yeah let's
 
04:20:13.269 --> 04:20:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:14.750 --> 04:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
I can give you a little background on
 
04:20:16.590 --> 04:20:16.600 align:start position:0%
this if you would
 
04:20:19.349 --> 04:20:19.359 align:start position:0%
prefer go ahead would that be
 
04:20:21.590 --> 04:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
helpful so the amendment that you're
 
04:20:22.790 --> 04:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
receiving right
 
04:20:25.189 --> 04:20:25.199 align:start position:0%
now um represent McGuire can speak to it
 
04:20:26.590 --> 04:20:26.600 align:start position:0%
if you want but I did want you to know
 
04:20:29.950 --> 04:20:29.960 align:start position:0%
that that does match the language for
 
04:20:32.550 --> 04:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
the approval going to fiscal committee
 
04:20:35.109 --> 04:20:35.119 align:start position:0%
prior that does match what is currently
 
04:20:40.109 --> 04:20:40.119 align:start position:0%
in RSA 9 colon 13 what this amendment
 
04:20:43.070 --> 04:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
does versus what the current range day
 
04:20:45.590 --> 04:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
funding does is there's a situation
 
04:20:47.670 --> 04:20:47.680 align:start position:0%
that's going to probably occur this year
 
04:20:50.229 --> 04:20:50.239 align:start position:0%
that doesn't fit into what is currently
 
04:20:53.229 --> 04:20:53.239 align:start position:0%
in uh RSA 9 colon
 
04:20:56.670 --> 04:20:56.680 align:start position:0%
13 so that is that when you have a de
 
04:20:59.469 --> 04:20:59.479 align:start position:0%
deficit one of the requirements is
 
04:21:01.550 --> 04:21:01.560 align:start position:0%
unrestricted General general fund
 
04:21:04.389 --> 04:21:04.399 align:start position:0%
revenues in the most recently completed
 
04:21:06.590 --> 04:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
fiscal bium were less than budgeted
 
04:21:09.469 --> 04:21:09.479 align:start position:0%
forecast so you have to have a deficit
 
04:21:12.990 --> 04:21:13.000 align:start position:0%
and it has to be revenues or less than
 
04:21:15.349 --> 04:21:15.359 align:start position:0%
budgeted forecast for the whole bium in
 
04:21:17.990 --> 04:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
order to transfer money out of the rainy
 
04:21:22.189 --> 04:21:22.199 align:start position:0%
day fund this year the revenues over the
 
04:21:24.910 --> 04:21:24.920 align:start position:0%
bium will not be less than what was
 
04:21:26.830 --> 04:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
forecasted over the bium however there
 
04:21:29.910 --> 04:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
will be a deficit due to spending so
 
04:21:33.030 --> 04:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
this what was put into hb2
 
04:21:35.590 --> 04:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
allows the comp troller to transfer
 
04:21:37.990 --> 04:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
money to cover the deficit however it
 
04:21:40.469 --> 04:21:40.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't put any restrictions on that it
 
04:21:43.309 --> 04:21:43.319 align:start position:0%
just allows them to trans the funds
 
04:21:46.670 --> 04:21:46.680 align:start position:0%
without going to fiscal the rest of 913
 
04:21:48.030 --> 04:21:48.040 align:start position:0%
typically if they're transferring any
 
04:21:49.950 --> 04:21:49.960 align:start position:0%
money from a deficit they have to get
 
04:21:51.790 --> 04:21:51.800 align:start position:0%
approval from fiscal before they
 
04:21:54.030 --> 04:21:54.040 align:start position:0%
transfer that so this amendment is
 
04:21:56.429 --> 04:21:56.439 align:start position:0%
allowing just excuse me just for fiscal
 
04:21:56.439 --> 04:21:57.229 align:start position:0%
allowing just excuse me just for fiscal
year

04:21:57.229 --> 04:21:57.239 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:21:59.670 --> 04:21:59.680 align:start position:0%
25 with the deficit for the com
 
04:22:02.590 --> 04:22:02.600 align:start position:0%
controller to transfer the funds non
 
04:22:06.109 --> 04:22:06.119 align:start position:0%
withstanding the provisions of 9 col
 
04:22:10.149 --> 04:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
13e with the approval of fiscal versus
 
04:22:10.159 --> 04:22:11.510 align:start position:0%
13e with the approval of fiscal versus
in

04:22:11.510 --> 04:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:22:15.590 --> 04:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
hb2 it's indefinitely and it is the com
 
04:22:15.600 --> 04:22:17.349 align:start position:0%
hb2 it's indefinitely and it is the com
controller

04:22:17.349 --> 04:22:17.359 align:start position:0%
controller
 
04:22:21.030 --> 04:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
only so what she's saying is the $160
 
04:22:23.630 --> 04:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
million problem that we have in fiscal
 
04:22:28.269 --> 04:22:28.279 align:start position:0%
year 2025 right now is not due to the
 
04:22:30.550 --> 04:22:30.560 align:start position:0%
the finance committee's budget from two
 
04:22:34.109 --> 04:22:34.119 align:start position:0%
years ago it is due to either the
 
04:22:36.510 --> 04:22:36.520 align:start position:0%
legislator or the fiscal committees
 
04:22:40.370 --> 04:22:40.380 align:start position:0%
extra spending over the last biennium
 
04:22:40.380 --> 04:22:43.389 align:start position:0%
extra spending over the last biennium
[Laughter]

04:22:43.389 --> 04:22:43.399 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:22:45.630 --> 04:22:45.640 align:start position:0%
and that's something that wasn't
 
04:22:48.389 --> 04:22:48.399 align:start position:0%
anticipated in the current law because
 
04:22:50.469 --> 04:22:50.479 align:start position:0%
the current law says you can only take
 
04:22:53.990 --> 04:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
from the rainy day fund if your expected
 
04:22:57.469 --> 04:22:57.479 align:start position:0%
revenue is less your actual revenue is
 
04:22:59.870 --> 04:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
less than expected and that's not true
 
04:23:02.229 --> 04:23:02.239 align:start position:0%
we our Revenue was fine and our budget
 
04:23:02.239 --> 04:23:03.109 align:start position:0%
we our Revenue was fine and our budget
was

04:23:03.109 --> 04:23:03.119 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:23:07.030 --> 04:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
fine but we spent too much on top of
 
04:23:10.630 --> 04:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
right so that was the problem okay um
 
04:23:13.269 --> 04:23:13.279 align:start position:0%
anybody I I would like to move this
 
04:23:16.950 --> 04:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
amendment um to section whatever it is
 
04:23:19.790 --> 04:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
second 186 all right seconded by
 
04:23:23.109 --> 04:23:23.119 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin uh representa Ms
 
04:23:24.950 --> 04:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
I think it's it's worth noting if I'm
 
04:23:27.149 --> 04:23:27.159 align:start position:0%
reading this correctly that one of the
 
04:23:29.109 --> 04:23:29.119 align:start position:0%
things this amendment also does is it
 
04:23:30.990 --> 04:23:31.000 align:start position:0%
says that the
 
04:23:33.670 --> 04:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
um the controller just can't move the
 
04:23:35.830 --> 04:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
money they have to request approval to
 
04:23:37.670 --> 04:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
move the money right that's the main
 
04:23:40.109 --> 04:23:40.119 align:start position:0%
point of this but that that but that
 
04:23:42.790 --> 04:23:42.800 align:start position:0%
wasn't in the uh the the language
 
04:23:44.990 --> 04:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
exactly that's right that's why the what
 
04:23:46.990 --> 04:23:47.000 align:start position:0%
the existing language is is
 
04:23:50.790 --> 04:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
objectionable right okay um because the
 
04:23:53.710 --> 04:23:53.720 align:start position:0%
existing languages says control or move
 
04:23:56.670 --> 04:23:56.680 align:start position:0%
the money all on your own right so you
 
04:23:58.790 --> 04:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
know this is to get a little more
 
04:24:01.630 --> 04:24:01.640 align:start position:0%
publicity for what's gone wrong you know
 
04:24:04.790 --> 04:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
all right yes yeah I have a question Mr
 
04:24:10.389 --> 04:24:10.399 align:start position:0%
chair so if our revenues were accurate
 
04:24:14.349 --> 04:24:14.359 align:start position:0%
if the budget was accurate but we
 
04:24:16.750 --> 04:24:16.760 align:start position:0%
overspent how did that is that because
 
04:24:19.429 --> 04:24:19.439 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee approved spending
 
04:24:21.389 --> 04:24:21.399 align:start position:0%
with without the revenues well and or
 
04:24:23.469 --> 04:24:23.479 align:start position:0%
the legislature just passed bills that
 
04:24:26.670 --> 04:24:26.680 align:start position:0%
said spend this and allocate that and
 
04:24:28.309 --> 04:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
there you go right okay all right thank
 
04:24:30.710 --> 04:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
you you know that's why we tend to
 
04:24:33.710 --> 04:24:33.720 align:start position:0%
discourage such bills in the second year
 
04:24:35.910 --> 04:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
of the
 
04:24:38.990 --> 04:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
B but sometimes we can't resist you know
 
04:24:42.389 --> 04:24:42.399 align:start position:0%
it's like Ms to a flamee yeah exactly
 
04:24:47.149 --> 04:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:50.030 --> 04:24:50.040 align:start position:0%
represent that's true so you and I are
 
04:24:53.349 --> 04:24:53.359 align:start position:0%
the responsible okay so so question
 
04:24:54.910 --> 04:24:54.920 align:start position:0%
representative camp that being the case
 
04:24:57.750 --> 04:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
where you just explained so they
 
04:25:00.149 --> 04:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
overspent can they will she be able the
 
04:25:01.349 --> 04:25:01.359 align:start position:0%
governor be able to take money out of
 
04:25:03.670 --> 04:25:03.680 align:start position:0%
the rainy day fund to to cover the
 
04:25:03.680 --> 04:25:04.790 align:start position:0%
the rainy day fund to to cover the
deficit

04:25:04.790 --> 04:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
deficit
 
04:25:07.349 --> 04:25:07.359 align:start position:0%
since apparently she's violating the
 
04:25:10.910 --> 04:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
rules or because we I see what you're
 
04:25:12.710 --> 04:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
saying we met the revenue we had the
 
04:25:16.550 --> 04:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
right budget so um this was not a case
 
04:25:18.710 --> 04:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
where we didn't get the anticipated
 
04:25:20.510 --> 04:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
revenue is she still allowed to take
 
04:25:21.830 --> 04:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
money out of the raid and day fund to
 
04:25:25.910 --> 04:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
make 2025 a whole so that's what this
 
04:25:29.630 --> 04:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
does is not it's not the governor it's
 
04:25:33.910 --> 04:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee um can move money
 
04:25:38.550 --> 04:25:38.560 align:start position:0%
from the r yes representative G um I
 
04:25:40.630 --> 04:25:40.640 align:start position:0%
think most of the bills in the second
 
04:25:42.750 --> 04:25:42.760 align:start position:0%
year usually say
 
04:25:47.870 --> 04:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
the governor can draw out of any funds
 
04:25:47.880 --> 04:25:49.469 align:start position:0%
the governor can draw out of any funds
available

04:25:49.469 --> 04:25:49.479 align:start position:0%
available
 
04:25:53.750 --> 04:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
so this by requesting the
 
04:25:55.910 --> 04:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal uh
 
04:25:59.030 --> 04:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
committee uh approve the transfer this
 
04:25:59.040 --> 04:26:00.550 align:start position:0%
committee uh approve the transfer this
might

04:26:00.550 --> 04:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
might
 
04:26:03.910 --> 04:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
prevent it might prevent uh spending on
 
04:26:09.990 --> 04:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
those bills that that otherwise might be
 
04:26:13.469 --> 04:26:13.479 align:start position:0%
spent I'm sounding like a
 
04:26:17.670 --> 04:26:17.680 align:start position:0%
a word salad yeah I understand
 
04:26:21.189 --> 04:26:21.199 align:start position:0%
law okay
 
04:26:21.199 --> 04:26:23.309 align:start position:0%
law okay
um

04:26:23.309 --> 04:26:23.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:26.630 --> 04:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
so yeah right so we're all set with the
 
04:26:28.670 --> 04:26:28.680 align:start position:0%
motion everybody knows what we're doing
 
04:26:31.269 --> 04:26:31.279 align:start position:0%
okay so all those in favor please raise
 
04:26:34.950 --> 04:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
your hands okay unanimous very good all
 
04:26:37.670 --> 04:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
right so Mr CH have a question before we
 
04:26:40.790 --> 04:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
move on go ahead I'm just curious why um
 
04:26:42.790 --> 04:26:42.800 align:start position:0%
there are changes in Section 8 5 but we
 
04:26:45.389 --> 04:26:45.399 align:start position:0%
don't review that section 85 is there
 
04:26:47.590 --> 04:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
any reason in particular why we don't
 
04:26:49.109 --> 04:26:49.119 align:start position:0%
get involved with that uh that's a
 
04:26:51.510 --> 04:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
division three bill with the division
 
04:26:53.830 --> 04:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
three bill for DHHS yeah got it thank
 
04:26:56.870 --> 04:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
you you're welcome
 
04:27:01.429 --> 04:27:01.439 align:start position:0%
yeah 185 185 185 the thing they're
 
04:27:04.269 --> 04:27:04.279 align:start position:0%
talking about there is probably Medicaid
 
04:27:08.229 --> 04:27:08.239 align:start position:0%
related or something like that yeah okay
 
04:27:10.149 --> 04:27:10.159 align:start position:0%
by the way
 
04:27:14.429 --> 04:27:14.439 align:start position:0%
um there was a Medicaid bill from
 
04:27:19.269 --> 04:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
um from um Municipal and County 20 22
 
04:27:21.670 --> 04:27:21.680 align:start position:0%
million or 23 million or something that
 
04:27:26.389 --> 04:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
passed on consent uh last last week
 
04:27:29.510 --> 04:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
so uh that was a mistake you know was
 
04:27:33.389 --> 04:27:33.399 align:start position:0%
with the wow that was a
 
04:27:36.790 --> 04:27:36.800 align:start position:0%
mistake so anyways um somebody didn't
 
04:27:38.670 --> 04:27:38.680 align:start position:0%
catch that all
 
04:27:40.870 --> 04:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
right yeah it should have been on the
 
04:27:43.750 --> 04:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
regular calar okay okay so now we
 
04:27:47.030 --> 04:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
amended this right so let me write that
 
04:27:47.040 --> 04:27:50.070 align:start position:0%
amended this right so let me write that
now

04:27:50.070 --> 04:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:53.670 --> 04:27:53.680 align:start position:0%
amended okay good we're done with that
 
04:27:53.680 --> 04:27:56.109 align:start position:0%
amended okay good we're done with that
Granite

04:27:56.109 --> 04:27:56.119 align:start position:0%
Granite
 
04:27:59.389 --> 04:27:59.399 align:start position:0%
Place uh the next one so I have some
 
04:28:01.189 --> 04:28:01.199 align:start position:0%
information on this one as well if you'd
 
04:28:03.830 --> 04:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
like me to speak to it so we we
 
04:28:07.790 --> 04:28:07.800 align:start position:0%
discussed this one last week in hb2 in
 
04:28:11.189 --> 04:28:11.199 align:start position:0%
2023 there was a provision to take the
 
04:28:14.630 --> 04:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
funding f from the sale of the lonia um
 
04:28:17.710 --> 04:28:17.720 align:start position:0%
the Laconia School in by Granite Place
 
04:28:20.830 --> 04:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
one that funding and those parameters
 
04:28:23.389 --> 04:28:23.399 align:start position:0%
only goes through this current bium so
 
04:28:26.309 --> 04:28:26.319 align:start position:0%
this language essentially extends that
 
04:28:28.309 --> 04:28:28.319 align:start position:0%
as it looks like the sale is going to be
 
04:28:33.109 --> 04:28:33.119 align:start position:0%
late 26 to 27 if it happens so there's
 
04:28:35.269 --> 04:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
two options with this you could keep it
 
04:28:39.389 --> 04:28:39.399 align:start position:0%
as is which takes the sale um proceeds
 
04:28:41.630 --> 04:28:41.640 align:start position:0%
which is about 10.5 million and it
 
04:28:44.070 --> 04:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
purchas is this property or you can
 
04:28:46.990 --> 04:28:47.000 align:start position:0%
delete the section and the sale of the
 
04:28:49.429 --> 04:28:49.439 align:start position:0%
property would revert to the general
 
04:28:53.109 --> 04:28:53.119 align:start position:0%
fund okay but we what about the payment
 
04:28:55.149 --> 04:28:55.159 align:start position:0%
to the owner of granite
 
04:28:57.750 --> 04:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
place the lease payments you mean
 
04:29:00.510 --> 04:29:00.520 align:start position:0%
currently well this says we're going to
 
04:29:03.950 --> 04:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
buy granite place right but currently
 
04:29:07.309 --> 04:29:07.319 align:start position:0%
we're leasing it correct right so are we
 
04:29:12.229 --> 04:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
obligated on whatever date to buy it or
 
04:29:14.550 --> 04:29:14.560 align:start position:0%
we are not it's just an option if we
 
04:29:16.630 --> 04:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
would like do you know what the lease is
 
04:29:16.640 --> 04:29:22.070 align:start position:0%
would like do you know what the lease is
per

04:29:22.070 --> 04:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:25.030 --> 04:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
year we can dig for that a little bit I
 
04:29:26.750 --> 04:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
looked at quick quick glance but it is
 
04:29:28.750 --> 04:29:28.760 align:start position:0%
already budgeted represent Griffin in
 
04:29:31.070 --> 04:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
the current budget um the only thing
 
04:29:33.070 --> 04:29:33.080 align:start position:0%
that bothers me about this
 
04:29:36.550 --> 04:29:36.560 align:start position:0%
is uh the language in
 
04:29:40.309 --> 04:29:40.319 align:start position:0%
it let me see if I can find it here it
 
04:29:43.109 --> 04:29:43.119 align:start position:0%
says it'll be used for state government
 
04:29:43.119 --> 04:29:44.189 align:start position:0%
says it'll be used for state government
office

04:29:44.189 --> 04:29:44.199 align:start position:0%
office
 
04:29:46.910 --> 04:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
space that almost
 
04:29:50.030 --> 04:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
precludes leasing any of it if there was
 
04:29:50.040 --> 04:29:51.550 align:start position:0%
precludes leasing any of it if there was
excess

04:29:51.550 --> 04:29:51.560 align:start position:0%
excess
 
04:29:54.790 --> 04:29:54.800 align:start position:0%
space and I think that should be
 
04:29:58.830 --> 04:29:58.840 align:start position:0%
corrected Mr chair I'd like to give Das
 
04:30:01.269 --> 04:30:01.279 align:start position:0%
an opportunity just to comment on this
 
04:30:03.349 --> 04:30:03.359 align:start position:0%
because we don't know about the lease if
 
04:30:03.359 --> 04:30:05.149 align:start position:0%
because we don't know about the lease if
they

04:30:05.149 --> 04:30:05.159 align:start position:0%
they
 
04:30:07.550 --> 04:30:07.560 align:start position:0%
obviously and then but that's a good
 
04:30:09.670 --> 04:30:09.680 align:start position:0%
point I mean because I remember in
 
04:30:12.109 --> 04:30:12.119 align:start position:0%
discussions we talked about the possib
 
04:30:13.950 --> 04:30:13.960 align:start position:0%
ility of leasing part of it if they
 
04:30:17.750 --> 04:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
didn't use it all absolutely so maybe we
 
04:30:20.670 --> 04:30:20.680 align:start position:0%
could just have Charlie yes we have a
 
04:30:23.469 --> 04:30:23.479 align:start position:0%
response from him on this that's what
 
04:30:25.910 --> 04:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
we're so yeah he said the state is a
 
04:30:27.630 --> 04:30:27.640 align:start position:0%
purchase and sales agreement to sell the
 
04:30:29.590 --> 04:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
lonia property I believe the governor's
 
04:30:31.309 --> 04:30:31.319 align:start position:0%
draft of the budget calls for using the
 
04:30:35.349 --> 04:30:35.359 align:start position:0%
potential expected proceeds he assumed
 
04:30:38.630 --> 04:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
9975 million as General Revenue a year
 
04:30:40.149 --> 04:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
ago the state bought one of the two
 
04:30:42.189 --> 04:30:42.199 align:start position:0%
towers at Granite place where current
 
04:30:44.030 --> 04:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
Justice Agriculture and the judicial
 
04:30:45.750 --> 04:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
Council are housed we do not own the
 
04:30:47.830 --> 04:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
other Tower and that's where the
 
04:30:49.389 --> 04:30:49.399 align:start position:0%
administrative office of the courts
 
04:30:51.550 --> 04:30:51.560 align:start position:0%
currently is I believe there's an option
 
04:30:54.510 --> 04:30:54.520 align:start position:0%
to buy it which Melissa stated in the
 
04:30:57.109 --> 04:30:57.119 align:start position:0%
lease I suspect the cost to purchase and
 
04:30:58.990 --> 04:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
necessary mechanical improvements will
 
04:31:00.389 --> 04:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
exceed his
 
04:31:02.910 --> 04:31:02.920 align:start position:0%
9975 million he mentioned
 
04:31:05.590 --> 04:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
earlier um and it's not a request nor
 
04:31:10.030 --> 04:31:10.040 align:start position:0%
recommendation of Das he just that's his
 
04:31:11.910 --> 04:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
General State yeah it's a request from
 
04:31:15.830 --> 04:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
from the governor's office not D so so
 
04:31:18.910 --> 04:31:18.920 align:start position:0%
the point is we could delete this pay
 
04:31:22.550 --> 04:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
some lease payment and and gain Three N
 
04:31:24.229 --> 04:31:24.239 align:start position:0%
million or something and at least
 
04:31:25.469 --> 04:31:25.479 align:start position:0%
payments are already in the budget
 
04:31:27.870 --> 04:31:27.880 align:start position:0%
because the judicial the the judicial
 
04:31:29.309 --> 04:31:29.319 align:start position:0%
branch part of the courts are already
 
04:31:30.750 --> 04:31:30.760 align:start position:0%
there so they're already paying the
 
04:31:32.750 --> 04:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
lease to the Granite one but this is to
 
04:31:34.950 --> 04:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
buy the other building right there's two
 
04:31:38.309 --> 04:31:38.319 align:start position:0%
buildings right so we own one already
 
04:31:41.109 --> 04:31:41.119 align:start position:0%
that's the doj agriculture Etc the
 
04:31:43.189 --> 04:31:43.199 align:start position:0%
judicial branch is in the other one
 
04:31:45.109 --> 04:31:45.119 align:start position:0%
currently and it's being leased right
 
04:31:46.790 --> 04:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
now which the lease payments are already
 
04:31:49.070 --> 04:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
in hb1 there was no adjustment for the
 
04:31:52.510 --> 04:31:52.520 align:start position:0%
purchase of this building when all right
 
04:31:54.189 --> 04:31:54.199 align:start position:0%
representative eil first and then well I
 
04:31:55.790 --> 04:31:55.800 align:start position:0%
was just going to ask do we know whether
 
04:31:58.109 --> 04:31:58.119 align:start position:0%
the whole building is being used now for
 
04:31:58.119 --> 04:31:59.990 align:start position:0%
the whole building is being used now for
government

04:31:59.990 --> 04:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
government
 
04:32:02.550 --> 04:32:02.560 align:start position:0%
purposes didn't I didn't hear that in
 
04:32:02.560 --> 04:32:04.429 align:start position:0%
purposes didn't I didn't hear that in
that

04:32:04.429 --> 04:32:04.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:32:07.269 --> 04:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
response because I I just
 
04:32:09.710 --> 04:32:09.720 align:start position:0%
I I think that's a good point you want
 
04:32:12.830 --> 04:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
to give them the option to lose to
 
04:32:15.469 --> 04:32:15.479 align:start position:0%
yeah all right why don't uh what can we
 
04:32:17.630 --> 04:32:17.640 align:start position:0%
ask someone from Das to come by and talk
 
04:32:21.309 --> 04:32:21.319 align:start position:0%
to us who knows all the details of this
 
04:32:25.149 --> 04:32:25.159 align:start position:0%
and um what our possible options are
 
04:32:26.590 --> 04:32:26.600 align:start position:0%
because if this is a source of 10
 
04:32:29.510 --> 04:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
million bucks uh I think we want to
 
04:32:31.269 --> 04:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
strongly consider
 
04:32:35.630 --> 04:32:35.640 align:start position:0%
it representative mons as the the the
 
04:32:38.990 --> 04:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
sale of the lonia site and completed so
 
04:32:41.469 --> 04:32:41.479 align:start position:0%
it's under contract right now uh they
 
04:32:43.189 --> 04:32:43.199 align:start position:0%
have to meet some stipulations before
 
04:32:44.790 --> 04:32:44.800 align:start position:0%
they go any for further so I think
 
04:32:46.269 --> 04:32:46.279 align:start position:0%
they're hoping to close within the next
 
04:32:46.279 --> 04:32:47.990 align:start position:0%
they're hoping to close within the next
18

04:32:47.990 --> 04:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
18
 
04:32:51.590 --> 04:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
months representative run
 
04:32:54.429 --> 04:32:54.439 align:start position:0%
Mone yeah I was at that building I think
 
04:32:56.229 --> 04:32:56.239 align:start position:0%
it's a North Tower we're talking about I
 
04:32:58.790 --> 04:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
was there last week and they are doing a
 
04:33:00.710 --> 04:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
lot of renovation I think in preparation
 
04:33:02.750 --> 04:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
of some committees working out of there
 
04:33:06.390 --> 04:33:06.400 align:start position:0%
but also if we delete this um it doesn't
 
04:33:09.429 --> 04:33:09.439 align:start position:0%
preclude us from using the proceeds for
 
04:33:12.429 --> 04:33:12.439 align:start position:0%
one Granite place in the future
 
04:33:14.109 --> 04:33:14.119 align:start position:0%
does it that money would just go into
 
04:33:18.869 --> 04:33:18.879 align:start position:0%
the general fund so this isn't like pre
 
04:33:20.949 --> 04:33:20.959 align:start position:0%
preventing us from buying one Grant a
 
04:33:22.949 --> 04:33:22.959 align:start position:0%
place when the sale goes through it just
 
04:33:25.189 --> 04:33:25.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't put it into statute well we
 
04:33:28.109 --> 04:33:28.119 align:start position:0%
won't have allocated any money for it
 
04:33:28.119 --> 04:33:29.230 align:start position:0%
won't have allocated any money for it
and

04:33:29.230 --> 04:33:29.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:33:31.470 --> 04:33:31.480 align:start position:0%
therefore yeah I don't know what happens
 
04:33:33.470 --> 04:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
to the contract but but I do agree it's
 
04:33:33.480 --> 04:33:34.310 align:start position:0%
to the contract but but I do agree it's
$10

04:33:34.310 --> 04:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
$10
 
04:33:37.029 --> 04:33:37.039 align:start position:0%
million that we'd have and also I do
 
04:33:38.869 --> 04:33:38.879 align:start position:0%
agree and I think I raised this in the
 
04:33:41.390 --> 04:33:41.400 align:start position:0%
in the when we previously talked about
 
04:33:44.029 --> 04:33:44.039 align:start position:0%
this is I don't like it being restricted
 
04:33:45.830 --> 04:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
that only for government because we may
 
04:33:47.470 --> 04:33:47.480 align:start position:0%
want a cafeteria in there and we might
 
04:33:50.310 --> 04:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
want to lease it to a vendor represent
 
04:33:52.310 --> 04:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
yeah that was my whole point I mean we
 
04:33:53.510 --> 04:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
as a
 
04:33:55.949 --> 04:33:55.959 align:start position:0%
legislative office are going to move
 
04:33:59.070 --> 04:33:59.080 align:start position:0%
down there and when we vacate it there
 
04:34:02.189 --> 04:34:02.199 align:start position:0%
may not be other people available move
 
04:34:03.629 --> 04:34:03.639 align:start position:0%
in we shouldn't
 
04:34:08.189 --> 04:34:08.199 align:start position:0%
preclude the ability to uh to lease it
 
04:34:12.150 --> 04:34:12.160 align:start position:0%
right so I won't take much change in we
 
04:34:15.269 --> 04:34:15.279 align:start position:0%
here but but that assum as we buy it
 
04:34:17.349 --> 04:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
right yeah and and something sounds sort
 
04:34:19.910 --> 04:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
of weird is in the sense that it sounds
 
04:34:21.590 --> 04:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
like we bought the one that we're not
 
04:34:25.830 --> 04:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
using no we are using it we have doj
 
04:34:28.629 --> 04:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture and judicial
 
04:34:31.310 --> 04:34:31.320 align:start position:0%
Council are in the one that we bought oh
 
04:34:33.109 --> 04:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
okay so the other portion there's a
 
04:34:34.709 --> 04:34:34.719 align:start position:0%
there's like an Atri room that connects
 
04:34:37.070 --> 04:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
the two or some sort walkway we don't
 
04:34:38.949 --> 04:34:38.959 align:start position:0%
own that walkway over to the next
 
04:34:42.429 --> 04:34:42.439 align:start position:0%
building we lease that from um
 
04:34:45.109 --> 04:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
from a from a real estate person right
 
04:34:47.310 --> 04:34:47.320 align:start position:0%
right and in that section we have the
 
04:34:49.470 --> 04:34:49.480 align:start position:0%
office of the quartzer and it says part
 
04:34:51.990 --> 04:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
of that building okay so currently we're
 
04:34:55.670 --> 04:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
using a one plus buildings right okay
 
04:34:57.750 --> 04:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
correct and we own one but we own one
 
04:35:00.150 --> 04:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
and leas some of the other and and some
 
04:35:02.029 --> 04:35:02.039 align:start position:0%
of further space in that going to be
 
04:35:03.189 --> 04:35:03.199 align:start position:0%
used for the
 
04:35:07.150 --> 04:35:07.160 align:start position:0%
legislature next year correct okay but
 
04:35:09.990 --> 04:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
but after that maybe not right so well
 
04:35:11.709 --> 04:35:11.719 align:start position:0%
we have a long-term Le we have a lease
 
04:35:15.070 --> 04:35:15.080 align:start position:0%
so I believe there's no
 
04:35:17.390 --> 04:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
um the courts is not planning on moving
 
04:35:19.349 --> 04:35:19.359 align:start position:0%
out anytime soon there's just an option
 
04:35:21.949 --> 04:35:21.959 align:start position:0%
at least a buy option I and they can
 
04:35:23.910 --> 04:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
pursue that if they would like so if you
 
04:35:26.990 --> 04:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
do here's the money set aside for it but
 
04:35:29.310 --> 04:35:29.320 align:start position:0%
we have there's no agreement signed I
 
04:35:30.949 --> 04:35:30.959 align:start position:0%
understand to buy it we would just
 
04:35:32.990 --> 04:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
continue to lease it if we didn't buy it
 
04:35:37.109 --> 04:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
gotcha um or put it in the capital L
 
04:35:39.670 --> 04:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
good buy I remember we talked all
 
04:35:42.189 --> 04:35:42.199 align:start position:0%
through this in facilities too I mean I
 
04:35:44.070 --> 04:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
think the the big thing is whether as
 
04:35:46.029 --> 04:35:46.039 align:start position:0%
you say we're going to say we're going
 
04:35:48.390 --> 04:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
to buy it with the lonia state school
 
04:35:51.551 --> 04:35:51.561 align:start position:0%
money or we're just going to figure it
 
04:35:54.789 --> 04:35:54.799 align:start position:0%
out separately if you want to buy it and
 
04:35:56.629 --> 04:35:56.639 align:start position:0%
who knows I mean the way things go with
 
04:35:58.869 --> 04:35:58.879 align:start position:0%
the lonia state school it might not sell
 
04:36:03.189 --> 04:36:03.199 align:start position:0%
anyway might not sell any all right
 
04:36:07.830 --> 04:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
so let's get more specific numbers from
 
04:36:09.070 --> 04:36:09.080 align:start position:0%
what what is
 
04:36:11.551 --> 04:36:11.561 align:start position:0%
the what are the terms of the of the
 
04:36:14.109 --> 04:36:14.119 align:start position:0%
purchase agreement end up the lease okay
 
04:36:16.470 --> 04:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
can make an intelligent decision yeah
 
04:36:21.029 --> 04:36:21.039 align:start position:0%
exactly sort of so you know once
 
04:36:24.789 --> 04:36:24.799 align:start position:0%
again on my list of things to spend on
 
04:36:30.470 --> 04:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
this would not bubble to the top right
 
04:36:34.830 --> 04:36:34.840 align:start position:0%
right toil in trouble yes right okay all
 
04:36:38.029 --> 04:36:38.039 align:start position:0%
right so um that's Granite place we're
 
04:36:39.590 --> 04:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
doing a weit on
 
04:36:43.349 --> 04:36:43.359 align:start position:0%
that um what's next
 
04:36:46.510 --> 04:36:46.520 align:start position:0%
188 oh renewable ener all right so this
 
04:36:48.510 --> 04:36:48.520 align:start position:0%
is a raid on the renewable energy fund
 
04:36:52.590 --> 04:36:52.600 align:start position:0%
yes a raid an unconstitutional rate well
 
04:36:54.269 --> 04:36:54.279 align:start position:0%
I don't know about
 
04:36:56.629 --> 04:36:56.639 align:start position:0%
that um I don't think the Constitution
 
04:36:59.070 --> 04:36:59.080 align:start position:0%
mentions the renewable
 
04:37:02.390 --> 04:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
energy it's it more has to do with
 
04:37:05.150 --> 04:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds I think that comment but
 
04:37:05.160 --> 04:37:10.310 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds I think that comment but
okay

04:37:10.310 --> 04:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:14.670 --> 04:37:14.680 align:start position:0%
um yeah or some of it or something yeah
 
04:37:17.670 --> 04:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
yeah all right so oh well that was a
 
04:37:19.510 --> 04:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
house maybe we
 
04:37:22.109 --> 04:37:22.119 align:start position:0%
should wait for an amendment that raids
 
04:37:25.750 --> 04:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
all the funds and put it here in section
 
04:37:29.269 --> 04:37:29.279 align:start position:0%
188 and therefore we can wait on talk
 
04:37:31.750 --> 04:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
about Toil and
 
04:37:33.590 --> 04:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
Trouble Mr
 
04:37:38.349 --> 04:37:38.359 align:start position:0%
chair all right um yes represent um
 
04:37:40.830 --> 04:37:40.840 align:start position:0%
considering the vote the house took last
 
04:37:40.840 --> 04:37:42.230 align:start position:0%
considering the vote the house took last
week

04:37:42.230 --> 04:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
week
 
04:37:44.510 --> 04:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
to raid well I don't want to use the
 
04:37:47.629 --> 04:37:47.639 align:start position:0%
word raid deplete this fund um I would
 
04:37:49.750 --> 04:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
much rather have the proceeds go to the
 
04:37:52.269 --> 04:37:52.279 align:start position:0%
general fund than what was outlined in
 
04:37:54.789 --> 04:37:54.799 align:start position:0%
that bill because some of it was going
 
04:37:56.390 --> 04:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
to rate payers it would be enough to
 
04:37:59.150 --> 04:37:59.160 align:start position:0%
maybe buy a cup of coffee a year I think
 
04:38:02.470 --> 04:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
we could use that money better to yeah
 
04:38:04.510 --> 04:38:04.520 align:start position:0%
you you can make that argument on
 
04:38:07.789 --> 04:38:07.799 align:start position:0%
anything but all right I understand now
 
04:38:13.230 --> 04:38:13.240 align:start position:0%
um did where was the we heard back from
 
04:38:16.949 --> 04:38:16.959 align:start position:0%
um Edna about barbering and com
 
04:38:19.029 --> 04:38:19.039 align:start position:0%
cosmetology right oh what was in that
 
04:38:21.269 --> 04:38:21.279 align:start position:0%
memo which was in that
 
04:38:25.189 --> 04:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
memo 18 188 we're waiting to we're g to
 
04:38:26.869 --> 04:38:26.879 align:start position:0%
wait on that wait to hear what else
 
04:38:28.349 --> 04:38:28.359 align:start position:0%
you're going to steal what other fund
 
04:38:30.470 --> 04:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
you going to raid that's right okay it's
 
04:38:32.670 --> 04:38:32.680 align:start position:0%
like the Viking
 
04:38:35.789 --> 04:38:35.799 align:start position:0%
hordes orever you well as or I says
 
04:38:38.189 --> 04:38:38.199 align:start position:0%
dancing through the field of dedicated

04:38:49.230 --> 04:38:49.240 align:start position:0%
okay okay I like that idea all right so
 
04:38:49.240 --> 04:38:49.990 align:start position:0%
okay okay I like that idea all right so
has

04:38:49.990 --> 04:38:50.000 align:start position:0%

04:39:05.709 --> 04:39:05.719 align:start position:0%
that oplc is going to provide better
 
04:39:14.830 --> 04:39:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:21.070 --> 04:39:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:24.949 --> 04:39:24.959 align:start position:0%
not old sections now some of
 
04:39:28.349 --> 04:39:28.359 align:start position:0%
this oh some of this is not ours right
 
04:39:31.429 --> 04:39:31.439 align:start position:0%
190 is that's division to oh yeah we're
 
04:39:39.708 --> 04:39:39.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:41.948 --> 04:39:41.958 align:start position:0%
very I can't find
 
04:40:04.190 --> 04:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:07.510 --> 04:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
a you shall receive
 
04:40:09.910 --> 04:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
hi are you here to talk about Granite
 
04:40:09.920 --> 04:40:16.550 align:start position:0%
hi are you here to talk about Granite
place

04:40:16.550 --> 04:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:26.830 --> 04:40:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:30.670 --> 04:40:30.680 align:start position:0%
on so thank you for coming um
 
04:40:33.708 --> 04:40:33.718 align:start position:0%
commissioner so do you know what the
 
04:40:35.750 --> 04:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
terms are first of all how much we're
 
04:40:38.150 --> 04:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
paying per year in leasing uh versus
 
04:40:40.030 --> 04:40:40.040 align:start position:0%
what it would cost us to buy and we're
 
04:40:41.830 --> 04:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
not paying one red Cent to lease
 
04:40:44.628 --> 04:40:44.638 align:start position:0%
anything on that campus wow there are
 
04:40:46.430 --> 04:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
two towers why would we want to change
 
04:40:49.030 --> 04:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
that there are two towers on on the
 
04:40:51.830 --> 04:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
campus okay
 
04:40:54.708 --> 04:40:54.718 align:start position:0%
um I presume this is section 187 of
 
04:40:57.590 --> 04:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
pable 2 yes which was not my idea and
 
04:40:59.948 --> 04:40:59.958 align:start position:0%
it's not a request to the department
 
04:41:02.510 --> 04:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
okay just for the record so if you pass
 
04:41:04.270 --> 04:41:04.280 align:start position:0%
it or kill it you're neither doing me a
 
04:41:06.590 --> 04:41:06.600 align:start position:0%
favor or hurting me okay um I have no
 
04:41:08.190 --> 04:41:08.200 align:start position:0%
interest how about the
 
04:41:08.200 --> 04:41:09.990 align:start position:0%
interest how about the
state

04:41:09.990 --> 04:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:41:12.510 --> 04:41:12.520 align:start position:0%
um so so there's two towers right
 
04:41:14.110 --> 04:41:14.120 align:start position:0%
there's a slightly older one slightly
 
04:41:15.948 --> 04:41:15.958 align:start position:0%
newer one they look kind of the same
 
04:41:18.708 --> 04:41:18.718 align:start position:0%
with a with a thing in between a
 
04:41:21.590 --> 04:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
vestibule if you will we bought one we
 
04:41:23.910 --> 04:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
leased it for a bit and then bought it
 
04:41:25.948 --> 04:41:25.958 align:start position:0%
we bought it from a local developer in
 
04:41:28.110 --> 04:41:28.120 align:start position:0%
town whose name is Steve dupry who some
 
04:41:32.830 --> 04:41:32.840 align:start position:0%
people have met um and it currently
 
04:41:34.628 --> 04:41:34.638 align:start position:0%
houses doj and
 
04:41:37.750 --> 04:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
Agriculture and judicial councel part of
 
04:41:39.628 --> 04:41:39.638 align:start position:0%
it is going to be renovated that's not
 
04:41:41.948 --> 04:41:41.958 align:start position:0%
being used for use
 
04:41:43.708 --> 04:41:43.718 align:start position:0%
temporarily for the
 
04:41:47.708 --> 04:41:47.718 align:start position:0%
legislature that Tower we own the state
 
04:41:51.788 --> 04:41:51.798 align:start position:0%
owns um we bought
 
04:41:55.430 --> 04:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
it a year ago is um we leased it for
 
04:41:56.948 --> 04:41:56.958 align:start position:0%
about a year then bought it and that has
 
04:41:58.430 --> 04:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
something to do with the terms under
 
04:42:00.948 --> 04:42:00.958 align:start position:0%
which the previous owner had bought it
 
04:42:03.708 --> 04:42:03.718 align:start position:0%
um so we own that either way some people
 
04:42:05.830 --> 04:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
would like to buy the other Tower um
 
04:42:08.350 --> 04:42:08.360 align:start position:0%
it's older it needs a lot of work we
 
04:42:10.270 --> 04:42:10.280 align:start position:0%
have a we have an engineering study I
 
04:42:12.110 --> 04:42:12.120 align:start position:0%
can show you which tells you how much
 
04:42:14.350 --> 04:42:14.360 align:start position:0%
work it needs it currently houses on one
 
04:42:15.948 --> 04:42:15.958 align:start position:0%
of its floors the administrative office
 
04:42:17.990 --> 04:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
of the courts I don't know who else is
 
04:42:20.030 --> 04:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
in it last I knew there was a pharmacy
 
04:42:22.788 --> 04:42:22.798 align:start position:0%
maybe I don't know but um there's no
 
04:42:24.670 --> 04:42:24.680 align:start position:0%
state agencies other than the courts in
 
04:42:27.670 --> 04:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
that building we don't own it today what
 
04:42:29.350 --> 04:42:29.360 align:start position:0%
fraction of the building is used by the
 
04:42:31.868 --> 04:42:31.878 align:start position:0%
court a good good question if I were
 
04:42:33.628 --> 04:42:33.638 align:start position:0%
guessing I'd guess they have a floor and
 
04:42:35.510 --> 04:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
a half out of four but I don't know that
 
04:42:38.990 --> 04:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
for sure um I've been to meetings there
 
04:42:42.830 --> 04:42:42.840 align:start position:0%
but I didn't get a tour so
 
04:42:46.110 --> 04:42:46.120 align:start position:0%
um um I think their lease goes up or
 
04:42:48.070 --> 04:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
something anyway the developer has
 
04:42:49.708 --> 04:42:49.718 align:start position:0%
wanted us to buy it and has pitched us
 
04:42:51.150 --> 04:42:51.160 align:start position:0%
on it we don't currently have a use for
 
04:42:53.990 --> 04:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
it um so we wouldn't buy it um we
 
04:42:56.510 --> 04:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily buy it but um
 
04:42:58.310 --> 04:42:58.320 align:start position:0%
although if you pass this we would
 
04:43:00.150 --> 04:43:00.160 align:start position:0%
obviously um although probably not for
 
04:43:02.590 --> 04:43:02.600 align:start position:0%
that price
 
04:43:05.030 --> 04:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
um that's sort of it
 
04:43:07.150 --> 04:43:07.160 align:start position:0%
right so we don't currently have an
 
04:43:09.990 --> 04:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
agreement with the developer that we're
 
04:43:11.948 --> 04:43:11.958 align:start position:0%
going to pay x million ion dollar for
 
04:43:14.628 --> 04:43:14.638 align:start position:0%
this building or something no okay right
 
04:43:16.470 --> 04:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
representative mon thank you Mr
 
04:43:18.990 --> 04:43:19.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner for coming in um so we're
 
04:43:22.590 --> 04:43:22.600 align:start position:0%
not paying any rent for the the the
 
04:43:25.470 --> 04:43:25.480 align:start position:0%
judicial branch they are they I'm sorry
 
04:43:28.110 --> 04:43:28.120 align:start position:0%
yes we are they are they are paying rent
 
04:43:29.550 --> 04:43:29.560 align:start position:0%
for their piece of the building I don't
 
04:43:31.470 --> 04:43:31.480 align:start position:0%
I don't know how much okay um they're
 
04:43:32.948 --> 04:43:32.958 align:start position:0%
that piece of it and that is a piece of
 
04:43:34.670 --> 04:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
their budget that is not within my
 
04:43:36.708 --> 04:43:36.718 align:start position:0%
department so I don't know the price and
 
04:43:39.030 --> 04:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
then a followup I
 
04:43:42.190 --> 04:43:42.200 align:start position:0%
mean um well I guess they could stay
 
04:43:44.110 --> 04:43:44.120 align:start position:0%
there if we didn't buy it mean I'm
 
04:43:46.390 --> 04:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
wondering where they would go if uh we
 
04:43:48.948 --> 04:43:48.958 align:start position:0%
decided not to buy it so just for the
 
04:43:51.550 --> 04:43:51.560 align:start position:0%
record we have no intention of buying it
 
04:43:53.868 --> 04:43:53.878 align:start position:0%
right now um there's not we're not in
 
04:43:55.590 --> 04:43:55.600 align:start position:0%
discussions about buying it we've not
 
04:43:58.788 --> 04:43:58.798 align:start position:0%
negotiated buying it my understanding of
 
04:44:01.830 --> 04:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
their lease which I don't have a copy of
 
04:44:03.430 --> 04:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
which was negotiated between the
 
04:44:06.670 --> 04:44:06.680 align:start position:0%
developer and um I think one of the
 
04:44:09.628 --> 04:44:09.638 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court Justices um and it might
 
04:44:12.350 --> 04:44:12.360 align:start position:0%
be the one who lives in my town um the
 
04:44:12.360 --> 04:44:14.030 align:start position:0%
be the one who lives in my town um the
um

04:44:14.030 --> 04:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:14.040 --> 04:44:16.270 align:start position:0%
um
coincidentally

04:44:16.270 --> 04:44:16.280 align:start position:0%
coincidentally
 
04:44:19.990 --> 04:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
um uh I think it has a clause in it I
 
04:44:22.390 --> 04:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
have been told though I have not read it
 
04:44:25.390 --> 04:44:25.400 align:start position:0%
that has the rent go up at some point
 
04:44:27.470 --> 04:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
and there are some people who think that
 
04:44:29.030 --> 04:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
the state should buy it at that point
 
04:44:30.910 --> 04:44:30.920 align:start position:0%
the legislature two years ago made us do
 
04:44:32.270 --> 04:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
an engineering
 
04:44:35.788 --> 04:44:35.798 align:start position:0%
study on I mean engineering we hired
 
04:44:38.190 --> 04:44:38.200 align:start position:0%
smrt to do a study of the building like
 
04:44:40.550 --> 04:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
a kind of like a home inspection if you
 
04:44:42.150 --> 04:44:42.160 align:start position:0%
will to tell us everything that we
 
04:44:44.670 --> 04:44:44.680 align:start position:0%
should fix and I I don't have in front
 
04:44:46.190 --> 04:44:46.200 align:start position:0%
of me that study but I can get it for
 
04:44:48.350 --> 04:44:48.360 align:start position:0%
you and it would something like 7 or $8
 
04:44:50.990 --> 04:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
million of stuff that should be fixed
 
04:44:52.708 --> 04:44:52.718 align:start position:0%
it's the older
 
04:44:56.590 --> 04:44:56.600 align:start position:0%
Tower but um but no we other than the
 
04:44:59.270 --> 04:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
the branch nobody nobody's in that
 
04:45:02.230 --> 04:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
side uh representative evil I mean are
 
04:45:06.230 --> 04:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
there from your uh knowledge are there
 
04:45:09.708 --> 04:45:09.718 align:start position:0%
agencies who would be good to move over
 
04:45:09.718 --> 04:45:11.628 align:start position:0%
agencies who would be good to move over
there

04:45:11.628 --> 04:45:11.638 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:45:14.990 --> 04:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
um based on the status of the buildings
 
04:45:16.788 --> 04:45:16.798 align:start position:0%
they are
 
04:45:20.628 --> 04:45:20.638 align:start position:0%
in I don't know
 
04:45:24.030 --> 04:45:24.040 align:start position:0%
that let me put it this way I in in part
 
04:45:25.430 --> 04:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
of our planning process we're not
 
04:45:27.670 --> 04:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
looking around going oh I I wish we had
 
04:45:29.590 --> 04:45:29.600 align:start position:0%
a building we could dump people
 
04:45:33.550 --> 04:45:33.560 align:start position:0%
into um so if we own the building we
 
04:45:35.190 --> 04:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
would use it because that's sort of a
 
04:45:37.190 --> 04:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
thing if we didn't own the building we
 
04:45:39.310 --> 04:45:39.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't need it and so so I don't want
 
04:45:41.350 --> 04:45:41.360 align:start position:0%
to tell you this would make somebody's
 
04:45:42.708 --> 04:45:42.718 align:start position:0%
life easier a lot of people would like
 
04:45:45.670 --> 04:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
to go moving is really expensive and for
 
04:45:47.270 --> 04:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
them for people to move you would have
 
04:45:49.230 --> 04:45:49.240 align:start position:0%
to appropriate money for them to
 
04:45:52.150 --> 04:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
move um if we bought the building you
 
04:45:53.708 --> 04:45:53.718 align:start position:0%
would also need to appropriate money to
 
04:45:53.718 --> 04:45:55.350 align:start position:0%
would also need to appropriate money to
fix

04:45:55.350 --> 04:45:55.360 align:start position:0%
fix
 
04:45:58.628 --> 04:45:58.638 align:start position:0%
it represent I mean so but the the
 
04:46:01.150 --> 04:46:01.160 align:start position:0%
acquisition of the first building was
 
04:46:03.868 --> 04:46:03.878 align:start position:0%
necessitated because we destroyed we
 
04:46:06.310 --> 04:46:06.320 align:start position:0%
were putting up the parking garage right
 
04:46:09.270 --> 04:46:09.280 align:start position:0%
yes so that's why we had to do something
 
04:46:11.628 --> 04:46:11.638 align:start position:0%
with those people yeah OJ was in a
 
04:46:14.750 --> 04:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
building and and they objected to us um
 
04:46:16.910 --> 04:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
destroying the building they were in
 
04:46:18.708 --> 04:46:18.718 align:start position:0%
while they were in it and not moving
 
04:46:21.590 --> 04:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
them somewhere and and it was hard to
 
04:46:23.350 --> 04:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
find the second choice was I think we
 
04:46:24.670 --> 04:46:24.680 align:start position:0%
were going to we were looking at buying
 
04:46:27.070 --> 04:46:27.080 align:start position:0%
half a Marshals and renovating it but
 
04:46:29.190 --> 04:46:29.200 align:start position:0%
the judges I think were less or the
 
04:46:32.350 --> 04:46:32.360 align:start position:0%
lawyers were less ecstatic about that
 
04:46:35.830 --> 04:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
idea okay all right now why is
 
04:46:38.628 --> 04:46:38.638 align:start position:0%
it so do we have a deal with them for
 
04:46:41.590 --> 04:46:41.600 align:start position:0%
the space that the legislature will be
 
04:46:44.390 --> 04:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
using to the space the legislature will
 
04:46:47.990 --> 04:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
be using is in the building we own oh so
 
04:46:50.750 --> 04:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
that building itself has a lot of empty
 
04:46:55.470 --> 04:46:55.480 align:start position:0%
space it has the the the uh doj has I
 
04:46:57.270 --> 04:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
want to say two floors and part it's
 
04:47:00.070 --> 04:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
like three and four and part of one uh
 
04:47:02.868 --> 04:47:02.878 align:start position:0%
so part of one is still open part of two
 
04:47:04.548 --> 04:47:04.558 align:start position:0%
is still open and two also has
 
04:47:06.270 --> 04:47:06.280 align:start position:0%
agriculture which is a much smaller
 
04:47:10.070 --> 04:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
40ish agency and um judicial Council
 
04:47:12.350 --> 04:47:12.360 align:start position:0%
which has for employees so it's a
 
04:47:14.150 --> 04:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
smaller they don't take a up a lot of
 
04:47:17.190 --> 04:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
office space and and the reason we don't
 
04:47:20.270 --> 04:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
put the Judiciary in this all this space
 
04:47:22.788 --> 04:47:22.798 align:start position:0%
it's not quite enough for them is
 
04:47:25.470 --> 04:47:25.480 align:start position:0%
that you know I've not looked into this
 
04:47:26.868 --> 04:47:26.878 align:start position:0%
I mean first of all because I wouldn't
 
04:47:29.510 --> 04:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
dare suggest moving to Judiciary um I
 
04:47:31.350 --> 04:47:31.360 align:start position:0%
think that wouldn't be good for my for
 
04:47:34.548 --> 04:47:34.558 align:start position:0%
me politically um
 
04:47:37.350 --> 04:47:37.360 align:start position:0%
the if we don't buy the building and
 
04:47:39.110 --> 04:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
when the legislature's done with the
 
04:47:41.270 --> 04:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
space that it uses I imagine the space
 
04:47:46.390 --> 04:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
will be in nice shape for stuff and uh I
 
04:47:47.910 --> 04:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
don't have a sense of square footage
 
04:47:49.948 --> 04:47:49.958 align:start position:0%
though so I suppose I will look into
 
04:47:51.470 --> 04:47:51.480 align:start position:0%
that okay and I'm sure they wouldn't
 
04:47:54.150 --> 04:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
mind me looking into it either so right
 
04:47:57.390 --> 04:47:57.400 align:start position:0%
all right um any other questions for
 
04:47:59.788 --> 04:47:59.798 align:start position:0%
commissioner do we have some other Das
 
04:48:01.670 --> 04:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
related things we want oh before we
 
04:48:03.830 --> 04:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
leave the granite Place one thing I I
 
04:48:05.670 --> 04:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
should say
 
04:48:09.230 --> 04:48:09.240 align:start position:0%
this the sale of the lonia state school
 
04:48:12.430 --> 04:48:12.440 align:start position:0%
property is
 
04:48:13.948 --> 04:48:13.958 align:start position:0%
I want to be careful not to say it's
 
04:48:18.190 --> 04:48:18.200 align:start position:0%
certain I feel very optimistic about it
 
04:48:20.868 --> 04:48:20.878 align:start position:0%
it's a really good developer
 
04:48:23.990 --> 04:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
um um with a lot of experience and I
 
04:48:26.270 --> 04:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
think they like the property but they do
 
04:48:28.470 --> 04:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
have the ability to walk away for for
 
04:48:30.070 --> 04:48:30.080 align:start position:0%
almost they would lose some money but
 
04:48:34.030 --> 04:48:34.040 align:start position:0%
not not not a ton um at any time so I
 
04:48:35.310 --> 04:48:35.320 align:start position:0%
would say there's a really good chance
 
04:48:41.150 --> 04:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
of that property closing in fiscal 2
 
04:48:45.350 --> 04:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
seven okay and it's 9.9 million okay
 
04:48:45.360 --> 04:48:46.510 align:start position:0%
seven okay and it's 9.9 million okay
representative

04:48:46.510 --> 04:48:46.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:48:49.788 --> 04:48:49.798 align:start position:0%
Griffin so this whole discussion started
 
04:48:54.190 --> 04:48:54.200 align:start position:0%
based on my question of of why the
 
04:48:59.110 --> 04:48:59.120 align:start position:0%
language in um in hb2 seems to preclude
 
04:49:02.310 --> 04:49:02.320 align:start position:0%
the state's ability to lease space there
 
04:49:06.110 --> 04:49:06.120 align:start position:0%
by saying it will be used for State
 
04:49:08.910 --> 04:49:08.920 align:start position:0%
offices and that kind of implies that it
 
04:49:11.390 --> 04:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
won't be used for anything else
 
04:49:14.150 --> 04:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
and I could foresee situation like when
 
04:49:14.160 --> 04:49:15.310 align:start position:0%
and I could foresee situation like when
the

04:49:15.310 --> 04:49:15.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:49:18.708 --> 04:49:18.718 align:start position:0%
legislative uh function leaves there
 
04:49:21.070 --> 04:49:21.080 align:start position:0%
there was vacant space and it might come
 
04:49:24.390 --> 04:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
down to to needing to lease it and I
 
04:49:27.548 --> 04:49:27.558 align:start position:0%
wondered why the language in here seem
 
04:49:32.590 --> 04:49:32.600 align:start position:0%
to preclude that I I don't think um so I
 
04:49:33.948 --> 04:49:33.958 align:start position:0%
haven't discussed it with with whoever
 
04:49:35.830 --> 04:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
wrote the precise words and somebody in
 
04:49:39.750 --> 04:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
the governor's office I think um but my
 
04:49:41.430 --> 04:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
understanding is that let's say for the
 
04:49:43.510 --> 04:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
sake of argument we didn't buy the
 
04:49:45.830 --> 04:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
building and this passes I don't think
 
04:49:48.390 --> 04:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
the language would make us buy the
 
04:49:50.030 --> 04:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
building especially if we had to spend
 
04:49:51.310 --> 04:49:51.320 align:start position:0%
more than $9
 
04:49:55.590 --> 04:49:55.600 align:start position:0%
million um I think we could still lease
 
04:49:57.948 --> 04:49:57.958 align:start position:0%
I think the language about State offices
 
04:50:00.628 --> 04:50:00.638 align:start position:0%
is to Pro uh is to keep it from being
 
04:50:04.350 --> 04:50:04.360 align:start position:0%
used for other random state uses it
 
04:50:06.548 --> 04:50:06.558 align:start position:0%
would say that the state can't own the
 
04:50:08.150 --> 04:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
building and then lease it out or the
 
04:50:10.030 --> 04:50:10.040 align:start position:0%
state can't own the building and then
 
04:50:12.548 --> 04:50:12.558 align:start position:0%
turn it into something else but my my
 
04:50:14.910 --> 04:50:14.920 align:start position:0%
take on State offices is that's there's
 
04:50:18.830 --> 04:50:18.840 align:start position:0%
some broadness to that so that um you
 
04:50:20.110 --> 04:50:20.120 align:start position:0%
can't look at something and go well
 
04:50:21.628 --> 04:50:21.638 align:start position:0%
that's not an office that's more of a
 
04:50:23.948 --> 04:50:23.958 align:start position:0%
hearing room I think that would be okay
 
04:50:25.788 --> 04:50:25.798 align:start position:0%
and but we probably couldn't turn it
 
04:50:25.798 --> 04:50:26.948 align:start position:0%
and but we probably couldn't turn it
into

04:50:26.948 --> 04:50:26.958 align:start position:0%
into
 
04:50:29.070 --> 04:50:29.080 align:start position:0%
um like a
 
04:50:31.708 --> 04:50:31.718 align:start position:0%
DMV does the state lease any of our
 
04:50:34.788 --> 04:50:34.798 align:start position:0%
property to private uh companies or
 
04:50:38.548 --> 04:50:38.558 align:start position:0%
individuals we we do not um there are a
 
04:50:40.190 --> 04:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
couple things that are almost exceptions
 
04:50:42.510 --> 04:50:42.520 align:start position:0%
to that um we bought Hall Street the old
 
04:50:45.030 --> 04:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
Bear right where where education is now
 
04:50:48.548 --> 04:50:48.558 align:start position:0%
and on the site there's an existing Mar
 
04:50:52.708 --> 04:50:52.718 align:start position:0%
County Savings Bank ATM it's a kiosk and
 
04:50:54.510 --> 04:50:54.520 align:start position:0%
because it existed we have a sort of
 
04:50:56.708 --> 04:50:56.718 align:start position:0%
unique language about that and some of
 
04:50:59.310 --> 04:50:59.320 align:start position:0%
the court buildings are leased uh
 
04:51:02.830 --> 04:51:02.840 align:start position:0%
typically to like the county attorney or
 
04:51:05.030 --> 04:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
something similar to that but we don't
 
04:51:06.670 --> 04:51:06.680 align:start position:0%
lease a private entities the state is
 
04:51:09.270 --> 04:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
not only in lordon other questions or
 
04:51:11.470 --> 04:51:11.480 align:start position:0%
meant to be we're happy uh was there
 
04:51:13.590 --> 04:51:13.600 align:start position:0%
other Das sections that we want to talk
 
04:51:16.270 --> 04:51:16.280 align:start position:0%
about uh section 177 you guys had
 
04:51:18.868 --> 04:51:18.878 align:start position:0%
questions about state agencies using
 
04:51:21.510 --> 04:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
funds in existing class 60 or other
 
04:51:23.350 --> 04:51:23.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate budget classes to pay fines
 
04:51:25.628 --> 04:51:25.638 align:start position:0%
and penalties from retirement system or
 
04:51:28.548 --> 04:51:28.558 align:start position:0%
the IRS do you have that in front of you
 
04:51:30.390 --> 04:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner I I don't have it in front
 
04:51:32.230 --> 04:51:32.240 align:start position:0%
of me but I know the Genesis of it don't
 
04:51:33.990 --> 04:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
don't ask me about about a word here or
 
04:51:37.230 --> 04:51:37.240 align:start position:0%
a word there but um we so we
 
04:51:39.310 --> 04:51:39.320 align:start position:0%
occasionally pay fines for things and
 
04:51:42.230 --> 04:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
like uh recently independent contractor
 
04:51:43.990 --> 04:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
violation of independent contractor laws
 
04:51:46.788 --> 04:51:46.798 align:start position:0%
and agencies pay fines to the IRS for
 
04:51:49.948 --> 04:51:49.958 align:start position:0%
that um and it's not clear where you pay
 
04:51:53.948 --> 04:51:53.958 align:start position:0%
them out of right and for similar fines
 
04:51:57.150 --> 04:51:57.160 align:start position:0%
that are paid on violations of the the
 
04:52:00.350 --> 04:52:00.360 align:start position:0%
the ACA for example on Healthcare um
 
04:52:02.470 --> 04:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
they're paid out of class 60 and risk
 
04:52:04.430 --> 04:52:04.440 align:start position:0%
and benefits has language related to the
 
04:52:07.948 --> 04:52:07.958 align:start position:0%
health plan that this mimics and and
 
04:52:10.670 --> 04:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
it's it's to identify the finds have to
 
04:52:12.670 --> 04:52:12.680 align:start position:0%
be paid and basically the state
 
04:52:14.510 --> 04:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
controller said to me one day can we
 
04:52:17.190 --> 04:52:17.200 align:start position:0%
dump something in House Bill 2 and I
 
04:52:19.430 --> 04:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
said if we're doing something else maybe
 
04:52:21.190 --> 04:52:21.200 align:start position:0%
um where we can just say this is the
 
04:52:22.708 --> 04:52:22.718 align:start position:0%
line that should be paid out of so we
 
04:52:25.270 --> 04:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
don't make random judgment calls on that
 
04:52:28.430 --> 04:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
gotcha okay other questions any other
 
04:52:31.470 --> 04:52:31.480 align:start position:0%
sections no no okay good I have a whole
 
04:52:33.310 --> 04:52:33.320 align:start position:0%
bunch of email traffic with Jack though
 
04:52:35.830 --> 04:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
that you might want to look at I suspect
 
04:52:38.310 --> 04:52:38.320 align:start position:0%
he shares yes representative evil I
 
04:52:39.750 --> 04:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
actually have a question but it's a it's
 
04:52:41.868 --> 04:52:41.878 align:start position:0%
a section we already approved so there's
 
04:52:44.230 --> 04:52:44.240 align:start position:0%
a section in here that for the capital
 
04:52:46.628 --> 04:52:46.638 align:start position:0%
project overview committee the reporting
 
04:52:49.830 --> 04:52:49.840 align:start position:0%
requirements go from quarterly to
 
04:52:52.990 --> 04:52:53.000 align:start position:0%
annually um the the committee wanted to
 
04:52:54.788 --> 04:52:54.798 align:start position:0%
leave it as quarterly and that's
 
04:52:57.230 --> 04:52:57.240 align:start position:0%
basically what we just did but is it a
 
04:53:00.868 --> 04:53:00.878 align:start position:0%
really onerous report to prepare on a
 
04:53:04.150 --> 04:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
quarterly basis no and and I I think
 
04:53:06.390 --> 04:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
that's fine we just we're we're you know
 
04:53:08.548 --> 04:53:08.558 align:start position:0%
we're in the process of identifying
 
04:53:12.310 --> 04:53:12.320 align:start position:0%
things that we can not do yeah because
 
04:53:14.270 --> 04:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
we are going to have fewer people to not
 
04:53:16.750 --> 04:53:16.760 align:start position:0%
do them with um and um that was one
 
04:53:18.510 --> 04:53:18.520 align:start position:0%
thing we identified it it we didn't have
 
04:53:22.350 --> 04:53:22.360 align:start position:0%
a sense of how widely read that is and a
 
04:53:24.628 --> 04:53:24.638 align:start position:0%
lot of the a lot of it is compiling
 
04:53:27.150 --> 04:53:27.160 align:start position:0%
reports from agencies right and some of
 
04:53:29.270 --> 04:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
the data in that is great if the
 
04:53:31.910 --> 04:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
agency's great in reporting the data
 
04:53:36.350 --> 04:53:36.360 align:start position:0%
other people basically write yeah still
 
04:53:39.030 --> 04:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
building and I've seen that and so we
 
04:53:40.948 --> 04:53:40.958 align:start position:0%
thought you know maybe that but
 
04:53:43.948 --> 04:53:43.958 align:start position:0%
quarterly is fine just I I had suggested
 
04:53:45.470 --> 04:53:45.480 align:start position:0%
to the committee maybe we go
 
04:53:47.788 --> 04:53:47.798 align:start position:0%
semiannually and they didn't go for it
 
04:53:50.070 --> 04:53:50.080 align:start position:0%
so I tried thank you for trying I
 
04:53:52.150 --> 04:53:52.160 align:start position:0%
appreciate that all right thank you very
 
04:53:55.670 --> 04:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
much commissioner okay let's I can't
 
04:53:59.020 --> 04:53:59.030 align:start position:0%
guarantee that someone will always be
 
04:53:59.030 --> 04:54:03.628 align:start position:0%
guarantee that someone will always be
[Laughter]

04:54:03.628 --> 04:54:03.638 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:54:06.628 --> 04:54:06.638 align:start position:0%
watching perfect yeah it's it's amazing
 
04:54:08.708 --> 04:54:08.718 align:start position:0%
how many people watch this stuff but
 
04:54:10.948 --> 04:54:10.958 align:start position:0%
anyway all right represent
 
04:54:12.948 --> 04:54:12.958 align:start position:0%
say you need any more information
 
04:54:17.670 --> 04:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
on M you ask them okay all right thank
 
04:54:20.430 --> 04:54:20.440 align:start position:0%
you for coming uh General from
 
04:54:20.440 --> 04:54:21.990 align:start position:0%
you for coming uh General from
Amala

04:54:21.990 --> 04:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
Amala
 
04:54:24.750 --> 04:54:24.760 align:start position:0%
okay let's uh so we wanted to talk about
 
04:54:26.868 --> 04:54:26.878 align:start position:0%
your sections of house built
 
04:54:29.948 --> 04:54:29.958 align:start position:0%
2 and and figure out what's going on in
 
04:54:32.948 --> 04:54:32.958 align:start position:0%
those so let's turn back
 
04:54:37.390 --> 04:54:37.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:46.788 --> 04:54:46.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:53.548 --> 04:54:53.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:53.558 --> 04:54:59.548 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:54:59.548 --> 04:54:59.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:06.270 --> 04:55:06.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:08.628 --> 04:55:08.638 align:start position:0%
so did you want me to give a little
 
04:55:11.670 --> 04:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
overview or yeah are these all sections
 
04:55:14.190 --> 04:55:14.200 align:start position:0%
doing similar things or do we need to go
 
04:55:16.868 --> 04:55:16.878 align:start position:0%
one by one or yeah they they really do
 
04:55:18.390 --> 04:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
similar things and the best way to
 
04:55:20.548 --> 04:55:20.558 align:start position:0%
describe this is it's really for the
 
04:55:23.788 --> 04:55:23.798 align:start position:0%
most part cleanup and meant to codify
 
04:55:26.110 --> 04:55:26.120 align:start position:0%
and just sort of clarify what's already
 
04:55:29.948 --> 04:55:29.958 align:start position:0%
happening not really to to do anything
 
04:55:32.708 --> 04:55:32.718 align:start position:0%
new um and one thing I would like to
 
04:55:34.270 --> 04:55:34.280 align:start position:0%
just point out right off the bat is on
 
04:55:37.510 --> 04:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
page 52 line 34 maybe this is just an
 
04:55:40.430 --> 04:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
LBA thing to point out for OS
 
04:55:43.510 --> 04:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
I think that's a small mistake leaving
 
04:55:45.830 --> 04:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
office of the sister General there that
 
04:55:48.830 --> 04:55:48.840 align:start position:0%
was meant to be crossed out oh I see and
 
04:55:50.510 --> 04:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
the new language is the you know the
 
04:55:53.708 --> 04:55:53.718 align:start position:0%
bold and italicized okay because we saw
 
04:55:56.390 --> 04:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
this and we thought maybe the the
 
04:55:58.948 --> 04:55:58.958 align:start position:0%
italicized part needs a d to be section
 
04:56:00.788 --> 04:56:00.798 align:start position:0%
D but you're saying you don't want the
 
04:56:02.868 --> 04:56:02.878 align:start position:0%
solicitor general right because the
 
04:56:05.070 --> 04:56:05.080 align:start position:0%
solicitor general is actually not in the
 
04:56:07.310 --> 04:56:07.320 align:start position:0%
division of legal council it's its own
 
04:56:09.350 --> 04:56:09.360 align:start position:0%
thing how you know separate from the
 
04:56:11.990 --> 04:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
other two divisions okay so good so we
 
04:56:14.470 --> 04:56:14.480 align:start position:0%
can make the change different than in
 
04:56:17.150 --> 04:56:17.160 align:start position:0%
that case thank you very much so there's
 
04:56:19.670 --> 04:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
things in here like like last in the
 
04:56:22.270 --> 04:56:22.280 align:start position:0%
last budget we we attempted to change
 
04:56:23.628 --> 04:56:23.638 align:start position:0%
the name of the transportation
 
04:56:25.270 --> 04:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
construction Bureau to Public Safety and
 
04:56:26.948 --> 04:56:26.958 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in all places where it
 
04:56:28.708 --> 04:56:28.718 align:start position:0%
was referenced and I think we just
 
04:56:31.430 --> 04:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
missed a couple of places and there's
 
04:56:33.190 --> 04:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
already a civil rights unit an election
 
04:56:35.590 --> 04:56:35.600 align:start position:0%
law unit at least they were those were
 
04:56:38.230 --> 04:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
established years ago which we have the
 
04:56:40.750 --> 04:56:40.760 align:start position:0%
authority to do within the office
 
04:56:42.910 --> 04:56:42.920 align:start position:0%
they just they're not codified or
 
04:56:45.110 --> 04:56:45.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned anywhere in the rsas so we
 
04:56:47.990 --> 04:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
thought it best to to Now list them in
 
04:56:52.030 --> 04:56:52.040 align:start position:0%
the structure of the of the doj but we
 
04:56:53.750 --> 04:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
beyond that there isn't a lot of
 
04:56:56.990 --> 04:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
substantive change
 
04:56:59.708 --> 04:56:59.718 align:start position:0%
um is the Civil Rights
 
04:57:02.868 --> 04:57:02.878 align:start position:0%
unit similar in some ways to the Human
 
04:57:05.910 --> 04:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission or not no the the
 
04:57:08.788 --> 04:57:08.798 align:start position:0%
Civil so the Civil Rights unit enforces
 
04:57:11.590 --> 04:57:11.600 align:start position:0%
the the civil rights act so the laws
 
04:57:13.190 --> 04:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
against discrimination but specifically
 
04:57:16.190 --> 04:57:16.200 align:start position:0%
the Civil Rights Act which says that
 
04:57:18.270 --> 04:57:18.280 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a violation of the Civil
 
04:57:20.868 --> 04:57:20.878 align:start position:0%
Rights Act if you either threaten or
 
04:57:24.548 --> 04:57:24.558 align:start position:0%
cause physical harm to someone or damage
 
04:57:27.430 --> 04:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
to their property based on animus
 
04:57:29.708 --> 04:57:29.718 align:start position:0%
towards a protected class which is a
 
04:57:31.430 --> 04:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
little different than discriminating
 
04:57:32.830 --> 04:57:32.840 align:start position:0%
against someone because they're a member
 
04:57:35.750 --> 04:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
of a protected class so if for instance
 
04:57:37.390 --> 04:57:37.400 align:start position:0%
you assault somebody because they're a
 
04:57:39.350 --> 04:57:39.360 align:start position:0%
member of a protected class that's of
 
04:57:40.708 --> 04:57:40.718 align:start position:0%
course a crime
 
04:57:42.350 --> 04:57:42.360 align:start position:0%
but it's also a Civil Rights Act
 
04:57:45.190 --> 04:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
violation which is a civil violation so
 
04:57:47.070 --> 04:57:47.080 align:start position:0%
we can actually we can bring a Civil
 
04:57:49.230 --> 04:57:49.240 align:start position:0%
Rights Act violation even if you've also
 
04:57:51.708 --> 04:57:51.718 align:start position:0%
been charged with assault or
 
04:57:53.708 --> 04:57:53.718 align:start position:0%
sometimes you may not end up getting
 
04:57:55.670 --> 04:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
charged with assault or you may not get
 
04:57:57.470 --> 04:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
a hate crime enhancement in the criminal
 
04:57:58.910 --> 04:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
context but we might bring a Civil
 
04:58:00.548 --> 04:58:00.558 align:start position:0%
Rights Act violation it just just
 
04:58:03.390 --> 04:58:03.400 align:start position:0%
depends yeah the one time I was almost
 
04:58:06.510 --> 04:58:06.520 align:start position:0%
on a jury uh it was a case like this it
 
04:58:09.190 --> 04:58:09.200 align:start position:0%
was um somebody was accused of beating
 
04:58:11.830 --> 04:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
somebody up because they thought they
 
04:58:15.030 --> 04:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
were I think gay if I remember right but
 
04:58:16.910 --> 04:58:16.920 align:start position:0%
you know and there therefore you know
 
04:58:18.830 --> 04:58:18.840 align:start position:0%
whatever so yes but then I was tossed
 
04:58:21.430 --> 04:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
off the jury
 
04:58:24.390 --> 04:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
so so I've never been on a jury so yeah
 
04:58:27.070 --> 04:58:27.080 align:start position:0%
anyway okay
 
04:58:29.830 --> 04:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
um anyways for whatever reason all right
 
04:58:30.788 --> 04:58:30.798 align:start position:0%
let's go
 
04:58:33.590 --> 04:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
on yeah the the one
 
04:58:35.628 --> 04:58:35.638 align:start position:0%
other and I'm happy to answer any
 
04:58:37.350 --> 04:58:37.360 align:start position:0%
questions but the one the one other
 
04:58:40.230 --> 04:58:40.240 align:start position:0%
change that could arguably be considered
 
04:58:43.830 --> 04:58:43.840 align:start position:0%
a substantive change I would say is on
 
04:58:47.628 --> 04:58:47.638 align:start position:0%
page 54 line
 
04:58:51.750 --> 04:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
17 where we are just adding to the
 
04:58:53.230 --> 04:58:53.240 align:start position:0%
statute that deals with enforcement of
 
04:58:56.310 --> 04:58:56.320 align:start position:0%
the election laws that we also are
 
04:58:59.590 --> 04:58:59.600 align:start position:0%
enforcing violations of lobbying laws we
 
04:59:03.310 --> 04:59:03.320 align:start position:0%
already do that but it's has NE it it's
 
04:59:05.270 --> 04:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
not technically within the election law
 
04:59:06.990 --> 04:59:07.000 align:start position:0%
units purview it just sort of falls
 
04:59:09.708 --> 04:59:09.718 align:start position:0%
under the Attorney General's General
 
04:59:11.948 --> 04:59:11.958 align:start position:0%
author to enforce the laws of the state
 
04:59:14.110 --> 04:59:14.120 align:start position:0%
so we thought we would add lobbying laws
 
04:59:17.548 --> 04:59:17.558 align:start position:0%
to that part of the rsas because it fits
 
04:59:20.670 --> 04:59:20.680 align:start position:0%
most nicely I think within our election
 
04:59:20.680 --> 04:59:23.390 align:start position:0%
most nicely I think within our election
enforcement

04:59:23.390 --> 04:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
04:59:28.868 --> 04:59:28.878 align:start position:0%
function um okay there was one
 
04:59:32.230 --> 04:59:32.240 align:start position:0%
thing yes representative Sweeney thank
 
04:59:33.670 --> 04:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
you thank you attorney general for being
 
04:59:35.590 --> 04:59:35.600 align:start position:0%
here absolutely so in that same
 
04:59:38.310 --> 04:59:38.320 align:start position:0%
paragraph starting at uh line 15 all the
 
04:59:42.510 --> 04:59:42.520 align:start position:0%
way down to 25 it ends with line 25
 
04:59:44.390 --> 04:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
investigation of alleged violations of
 
04:59:47.030 --> 04:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
the election laws should we also add in
 
04:59:53.868 --> 04:59:53.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:57.070 --> 04:59:57.080 align:start position:0%
there we could I think the reason that
 
04:59:59.708 --> 04:59:59.718 align:start position:0%
sentence exists is because
 
05:00:04.270 --> 05:00:04.280 align:start position:0%
we we submit that report I think every
 
05:00:06.670 --> 05:00:06.680 align:start position:0%
um it's a biannual report so every six
 
05:00:07.990 --> 05:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
months we submit a report to the
 
05:00:10.230 --> 05:00:10.240 align:start position:0%
legislature of election law complaint
 
05:00:12.510 --> 05:00:12.520 align:start position:0%
and the status of the complaints and how
 
05:00:14.750 --> 05:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
they've been handled my guess is that's
 
05:00:16.788 --> 05:00:16.798 align:start position:0%
why that sentence is there but I don't
 
05:00:18.788 --> 05:00:18.798 align:start position:0%
think it would I don't think it would do
 
05:00:21.230 --> 05:00:21.240 align:start position:0%
any harm I'm not sure it's necessary
 
05:00:23.788 --> 05:00:23.798 align:start position:0%
though yeah thank you so why let's go
 
05:00:27.230 --> 05:00:27.240 align:start position:0%
back up page um why is section 114 and
 
05:00:30.390 --> 05:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
115 look like duplications of each other
 
05:00:33.310 --> 05:00:33.320 align:start position:0%
it looks like the division of of legal
 
05:00:38.190 --> 05:00:38.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:41.548 --> 05:00:41.558 align:start position:0%
twice that's a great question so there
 
05:00:43.910 --> 05:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
um I can't tell you historically why
 
05:00:46.270 --> 05:00:46.280 align:start position:0%
this is but the Department of Justice
 
05:00:48.830 --> 05:00:48.840 align:start position:0%
that we have a what we sometimes think
 
05:00:50.868 --> 05:00:50.878 align:start position:0%
of of all those doppelganger statutes we
 
05:00:54.830 --> 05:00:54.840 align:start position:0%
have RSA 7 that lists out certain
 
05:00:58.788 --> 05:00:58.798 align:start position:0%
functions and and um Provisions related
 
05:01:00.470 --> 05:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
to the Office of the Attorney General
 
05:01:03.390 --> 05:01:03.400 align:start position:0%
that's an RSA 7 RSA
 
05:01:07.670 --> 05:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
21m is another section that also lists
 
05:01:09.708 --> 05:01:09.718 align:start position:0%
off various functions and things related
 
05:01:11.590 --> 05:01:11.600 align:start position:0%
to to the Office of the Attorney General
 
05:01:14.350 --> 05:01:14.360 align:start position:0%
in some cases they are duplicative and
 
05:01:16.948 --> 05:01:16.958 align:start position:0%
and I actually do think a useful project
 
05:01:18.670 --> 05:01:18.680 align:start position:0%
at some point might be to just try to
 
05:01:21.350 --> 05:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
merge those together we didn't take that
 
05:01:24.190 --> 05:01:24.200 align:start position:0%
on in this particular hb2 and it may
 
05:01:26.190 --> 05:01:26.200 align:start position:0%
actually be better for it just a
 
05:01:26.200 --> 05:01:27.070 align:start position:0%
actually be better for it just a
separate

05:01:27.070 --> 05:01:27.080 align:start position:0%
separate
 
05:01:30.230 --> 05:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
bill on its own but it's a good question
 
05:01:32.948 --> 05:01:32.958 align:start position:0%
and we have remarked on that before it's
 
05:01:34.270 --> 05:01:34.280 align:start position:0%
actually one of the reasons why when we
 
05:01:35.470 --> 05:01:35.480 align:start position:0%
went to change the name of the
 
05:01:37.868 --> 05:01:37.878 align:start position:0%
transportation construction Bureau we
 
05:01:39.548 --> 05:01:39.558 align:start position:0%
missed it in a couple places because we
 
05:01:41.788 --> 05:01:41.798 align:start position:0%
have the two different sections that
 
05:01:44.670 --> 05:01:44.680 align:start position:0%
deal with the office see all right but
 
05:01:47.628 --> 05:01:47.638 align:start position:0%
but we will not do that at this time
 
05:01:50.510 --> 05:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
okay right which is the problem all
 
05:01:54.270 --> 05:01:54.280 align:start position:0%
right so um so that's basically it yes
 
05:01:55.868 --> 05:01:55.878 align:start position:0%
representative Mon and this this may
 
05:01:57.510 --> 05:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
just be a technicality but one of the
 
05:02:00.670 --> 05:02:00.680 align:start position:0%
things that I noticed also in a number
 
05:02:02.190 --> 05:02:02.200 align:start position:0%
of places is it
 
05:02:05.910 --> 05:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
removes uh reference to duties assigned
 
05:02:07.470 --> 05:02:07.480 align:start position:0%
to the attorney general regarding the
 
05:02:11.670 --> 05:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
charitable trust see that p on page 53
 
05:02:15.070 --> 05:02:15.080 align:start position:0%
lines 8 and n and then again on 24 25 is
 
05:02:18.150 --> 05:02:18.160 align:start position:0%
there yep anything anything to
 
05:02:22.670 --> 05:02:22.680 align:start position:0%
that no it just um the charitable trust
 
05:02:24.708 --> 05:02:24.718 align:start position:0%
unit is within the division of legal
 
05:02:27.310 --> 05:02:27.320 align:start position:0%
council but it's its own entity within
 
05:02:29.948 --> 05:02:29.958 align:start position:0%
the division so we just thought that was
 
05:02:32.110 --> 05:02:32.120 align:start position:0%
cleanup so rather than saying the
 
05:02:34.350 --> 05:02:34.360 align:start position:0%
division is responsible for
 
05:02:38.070 --> 05:02:38.080 align:start position:0%
administering the charitable trust um
 
05:02:39.510 --> 05:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
the charitable trust statutes it's the
 
05:02:40.990 --> 05:02:41.000 align:start position:0%
charitable trust unit that does that
 
05:02:43.830 --> 05:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
it's within the division so it I don't
 
05:02:45.868 --> 05:02:45.878 align:start position:0%
think that's a substantive change we
 
05:02:47.910 --> 05:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
just we see it as as cleanup and just
 
05:02:49.788 --> 05:02:49.798 align:start position:0%
kind of a technical
 
05:02:54.070 --> 05:02:54.080 align:start position:0%
change okay other questions so this is
 
05:02:56.310 --> 05:02:56.320 align:start position:0%
all the sections is or is there
 
05:02:59.190 --> 05:02:59.200 align:start position:0%
more I think this is I think you want to
 
05:03:02.110 --> 05:03:02.120 align:start position:0%
ask him about section 124 on page
 
05:03:02.120 --> 05:03:04.548 align:start position:0%
ask him about section 124 on page
56

05:03:04.548 --> 05:03:04.558 align:start position:0%
56
 
05:03:07.110 --> 05:03:07.120 align:start position:0%
124 I thought that was maybe judicial
 
05:03:11.270 --> 05:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
Council but maybe
 
05:03:13.910 --> 05:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
access to governmental records oh I I
 
05:03:15.670 --> 05:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
don't have that in front of me could I
 
05:03:17.270 --> 05:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
borrow your
 
05:03:20.150 --> 05:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
section oh yes under
 
05:03:22.430 --> 05:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
seal right
 
05:03:27.750 --> 05:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
so um there's a list of exemptions to
 
05:03:30.230 --> 05:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
91a right things you don't have to
 
05:03:32.830 --> 05:03:32.840 align:start position:0%
disclose right Y and this one adds
 
05:03:34.788 --> 05:03:34.798 align:start position:0%
records held by the executive branch
 
05:03:37.628 --> 05:03:37.638 align:start position:0%
that are under seal or confidential in a
 
05:03:40.868 --> 05:03:40.878 align:start position:0%
court file so
 
05:03:45.030 --> 05:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
um is under seal defined somewhere
 
05:03:48.350 --> 05:03:48.360 align:start position:0%
and so this is interesting I actually H
 
05:03:51.110 --> 05:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
haven't seen this I I I can understand I
 
05:03:53.670 --> 05:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
think what this is aimed at at least at
 
05:03:54.830 --> 05:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice if we're
 
05:03:58.948 --> 05:03:58.958 align:start position:0%
litigating and there are there are uh
 
05:04:01.868 --> 05:04:01.878 align:start position:0%
documents or other items that are part
 
05:04:03.868 --> 05:04:03.878 align:start position:0%
of a court case that the court has
 
05:04:05.590 --> 05:04:05.600 align:start position:0%
ordered sealed or if they're sealed
 
05:04:07.830 --> 05:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
pleadings for instance grand jury
 
05:04:09.750 --> 05:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
proceedings are typically sealed and we
 
05:04:12.350 --> 05:04:12.360 align:start position:0%
file pleadings as as part of that but we
 
05:04:12.360 --> 05:04:13.190 align:start position:0%
file pleadings as as part of that but we
have

05:04:13.190 --> 05:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:04:15.830 --> 05:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
them I think what this is trying to say
 
05:04:18.590 --> 05:04:18.600 align:start position:0%
is if a court has sealed something so if
 
05:04:21.990 --> 05:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
something has been filed under seal in
 
05:04:24.430 --> 05:04:24.440 align:start position:0%
court we don't have to turn over copies
 
05:04:25.590 --> 05:04:25.600 align:start position:0%
of those
 
05:04:28.430 --> 05:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
pleadings which we of course are not
 
05:04:30.590 --> 05:04:30.600 align:start position:0%
allowed to do by by Court rule and court
 
05:04:34.030 --> 05:04:34.040 align:start position:0%
rules have the force of law right so I
 
05:04:36.430 --> 05:04:36.440 align:start position:0%
this might just be bootstrapping but I
 
05:04:39.868 --> 05:04:39.878 align:start position:0%
think I would read under seal as a court
 
05:04:42.310 --> 05:04:42.320 align:start position:0%
has sealed something or something has
 
05:04:45.750 --> 05:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
been filed under seal in court okay I
 
05:04:48.150 --> 05:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
can check at the office to see if we
 
05:04:50.430 --> 05:04:50.440 align:start position:0%
suggested this language but but I
 
05:04:52.190 --> 05:04:52.200 align:start position:0%
personally was not aware of this it
 
05:04:55.390 --> 05:04:55.400 align:start position:0%
makes sense to me I'm also not convinced
 
05:04:55.400 --> 05:04:56.830 align:start position:0%
makes sense to me I'm also not convinced
it's

05:04:56.830 --> 05:04:56.840 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:04:59.350 --> 05:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
necessary because you wouldn't ever I
 
05:05:01.830 --> 05:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't we wouldn't ever do it anyway
 
05:05:03.670 --> 05:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
right and I think if a core if if
 
05:05:06.190 --> 05:05:06.200 align:start position:0%
somebody sued us trying to get us to
 
05:05:08.470 --> 05:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
turn over documents that a court had
 
05:05:10.190 --> 05:05:10.200 align:start position:0%
sealed the court is is probably going to
 
05:05:11.708 --> 05:05:11.718 align:start position:0%
side with us when we don't turn them
 
05:05:14.230 --> 05:05:14.240 align:start position:0%
over yeah but it it would cause expense
 
05:05:17.070 --> 05:05:17.080 align:start position:0%
right yeah okay
 
05:05:20.430 --> 05:05:20.440 align:start position:0%
yeah what's that I wonder if it made its
 
05:05:22.310 --> 05:05:22.320 align:start position:0%
way in here because there was some
 
05:05:24.910 --> 05:05:24.920 align:start position:0%
circumstance where somebody was
 
05:05:27.150 --> 05:05:27.160 align:start position:0%
questioning and they felt like they
 
05:05:30.750 --> 05:05:30.760 align:start position:0%
needed it yeah that's if if it what I'm
 
05:05:32.628 --> 05:05:32.638 align:start position:0%
happy to do is go back to the office and
 
05:05:35.190 --> 05:05:35.200 align:start position:0%
check to see if this came from us okay
 
05:05:37.628 --> 05:05:37.638 align:start position:0%
it might have come you know from us and
 
05:05:39.270 --> 05:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
then through somebody else right someone
 
05:05:40.548 --> 05:05:40.558 align:start position:0%
might have checked with someone in the
 
05:05:42.470 --> 05:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
office who said oh yeah that could make
 
05:05:44.670 --> 05:05:44.680 align:start position:0%
sense I'm happy to clarify that for you
 
05:05:45.990 --> 05:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
just to make sure that there isn't
 
05:05:47.430 --> 05:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
something we're not thinking of
 
05:05:51.070 --> 05:05:51.080 align:start position:0%
represent mths Mr chair we we had quite
 
05:05:52.628 --> 05:05:52.638 align:start position:0%
a long discussion this morning about
 
05:05:54.750 --> 05:05:54.760 align:start position:0%
boat houses and there was language in
 
05:05:57.670 --> 05:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
here about a February 20th 25 oh yeah we
 
05:05:59.390 --> 05:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
were G to ask you cut off do we want to
 
05:06:03.190 --> 05:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
ask about that so if you turn section 15
 
05:06:06.788 --> 05:06:06.798 align:start position:0%
coming SE section this is just page 12
 
05:06:10.190 --> 05:06:10.200 align:start position:0%
we want legal advice yeah
 
05:06:12.990 --> 05:06:13.000 align:start position:0%
all right is this the whole hb2 page 12
 
05:06:15.708 --> 05:06:15.718 align:start position:0%
yeah so I also have some updated
 
05:06:18.270 --> 05:06:18.280 align:start position:0%
information from Dees on that well when
 
05:06:21.750 --> 05:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
don't we while he's here we'll see
 
05:06:26.390 --> 05:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
so um if you look on line um 10 of page
 
05:06:29.270 --> 05:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
12 okay it says any Boat House
 
05:06:32.788 --> 05:06:32.798 align:start position:0%
constructed after February 20th uh Etc
 
05:06:35.788 --> 05:06:35.798 align:start position:0%
shall not uh be such and such you know
 
05:06:38.868 --> 05:06:38.878 align:start position:0%
whatever the question is can we put in a
 
05:06:41.190 --> 05:06:41.200 align:start position:0%
bill that's if has an effective date of
 
05:06:44.948 --> 05:06:44.958 align:start position:0%
July 1st something that says you can't
 
05:06:47.670 --> 05:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
do something as of February
 
05:06:51.310 --> 05:06:51.320 align:start position:0%
20th well if I if I might if I might add
 
05:06:53.110 --> 05:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
represent and I think the other the
 
05:06:55.548 --> 05:06:55.558 align:start position:0%
other kind of related question is was
 
05:06:57.670 --> 05:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
there some because it apparently a lot
 
05:07:00.150 --> 05:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
of this stuff around boat houses came
 
05:07:02.230 --> 05:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
about as a result of litigation was
 
05:07:03.830 --> 05:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
there something in some kind of a
 
05:07:06.310 --> 05:07:06.320 align:start position:0%
settlement oh yeah that specifically
 
05:07:08.868 --> 05:07:08.878 align:start position:0%
said February 20th I just want to just
 
05:07:10.350 --> 05:07:10.360 align:start position:0%
make twoo clar ifications and I don't
 
05:07:13.470 --> 05:07:13.480 align:start position:0%
mean to cut in but one it was over a
 
05:07:14.948 --> 05:07:14.958 align:start position:0%
legal interpretation there was no
 
05:07:16.830 --> 05:07:16.840 align:start position:0%
litigation on this just for
 
05:07:20.030 --> 05:07:20.040 align:start position:0%
clarification into um de said this was
 
05:07:21.990 --> 05:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
just a placeholder that they put in
 
05:07:24.750 --> 05:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
there attorney for Mel can answer
 
05:07:26.070 --> 05:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
anything else but I just wanted to put a
 
05:07:27.670 --> 05:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
couple clarification so they want us to
 
05:07:28.948 --> 05:07:28.958 align:start position:0%
change it is that what you're saying
 
05:07:30.708 --> 05:07:30.718 align:start position:0%
what the date is a placeholder you mean
 
05:07:34.030 --> 05:07:34.040 align:start position:0%
they just put in a placeholder ah yeah
 
05:07:36.788 --> 05:07:36.798 align:start position:0%
so yeah I mean look off the top of my
 
05:07:38.910 --> 05:07:38.920 align:start position:0%
head it would make more sense that the
 
05:07:40.830 --> 05:07:40.840 align:start position:0%
date would be sometime
 
05:07:44.110 --> 05:07:44.120 align:start position:0%
either sometime after the
 
05:07:48.030 --> 05:07:48.040 align:start position:0%
statute yeah probably not even the exact
 
05:07:49.390 --> 05:07:49.400 align:start position:0%
effective date right because someone has
 
05:07:50.628 --> 05:07:50.638 align:start position:0%
to have notice they're not supposed to
 
05:07:54.470 --> 05:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
do it in advance uh so that off the top
 
05:07:56.590 --> 05:07:56.600 align:start position:0%
of my head that would make more sense to
 
05:07:56.600 --> 05:07:58.190 align:start position:0%
of my head that would make more sense to
me

05:07:58.190 --> 05:07:58.200 align:start position:0%
me
 
05:08:00.628 --> 05:08:00.638 align:start position:0%
happy yeah I think if it's a placeholder
 
05:08:01.670 --> 05:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
that actually might be a question for
 
05:08:03.150 --> 05:08:03.160 align:start position:0%
Dees because if it really was meant to
 
05:08:04.548 --> 05:08:04.558 align:start position:0%
be a placeholder I'm not sure there's
 
05:08:06.590 --> 05:08:06.600 align:start position:0%
anything I need to look at okay if they
 
05:08:08.390 --> 05:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
really do want something that's before
 
05:08:11.350 --> 05:08:11.360 align:start position:0%
July 1 then we should probably take a
 
05:08:14.510 --> 05:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
look at that they said there was no um
 
05:08:16.590 --> 05:08:16.600 align:start position:0%
significant no significant meeting
 
05:08:17.868 --> 05:08:17.878 align:start position:0%
applied to that date it was just a
 
05:08:19.910 --> 05:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
placeholder that put a DAT in there put
 
05:08:22.750 --> 05:08:22.760 align:start position:0%
in there they but all right just
 
05:08:25.470 --> 05:08:25.480 align:start position:0%
represent but I I just to track back to
 
05:08:27.430 --> 05:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office I believe
 
05:08:29.430 --> 05:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
the reason this is even in here was a
 
05:08:32.110 --> 05:08:32.120 align:start position:0%
legal interpretation of some statutes
 
05:08:36.230 --> 05:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
that need to be fixed so it they they
 
05:08:37.990 --> 05:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
said it kind of came from you in the
 
05:08:40.150 --> 05:08:40.160 align:start position:0%
first place not the
 
05:08:42.270 --> 05:08:42.280 align:start position:0%
yeah the the substantive the substantive
 
05:08:44.590 --> 05:08:44.600 align:start position:0%
language very well could have come from
 
05:08:48.230 --> 05:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
us so I to the extent you have questions
 
05:08:50.948 --> 05:08:50.958 align:start position:0%
about the substance I can look at that
 
05:08:52.670 --> 05:08:52.680 align:start position:0%
it's not something I'm intimately
 
05:08:56.670 --> 05:08:56.680 align:start position:0%
familiar with as I sit here
 
05:08:59.510 --> 05:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
okay yes okay I think we can just fix
 
05:09:03.230 --> 05:09:03.240 align:start position:0%
the date all good yes represent Sween
 
05:09:04.628 --> 05:09:04.638 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for being here
 
05:09:06.030 --> 05:09:06.040 align:start position:0%
again I don't want to abuse your time
 
05:09:08.110 --> 05:09:08.120 align:start position:0%
but while we have you here last week we
 
05:09:11.270 --> 05:09:11.280 align:start position:0%
heard a bill regarding the uh Office of
 
05:09:14.030 --> 05:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
the right to know ab budsman and when we
 
05:09:15.628 --> 05:09:15.638 align:start position:0%
look at the actual numbers of it it's
 
05:09:19.230 --> 05:09:19.240 align:start position:0%
very expensive per case that he handles
 
05:09:21.590 --> 05:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
so I while we have you here not to put
 
05:09:23.110 --> 05:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
you on the spot do you think there might
 
05:09:25.708 --> 05:09:25.718 align:start position:0%
be a better way for the state to answer
 
05:09:27.150 --> 05:09:27.160 align:start position:0%
right to know
 
05:09:30.390 --> 05:09:30.400 align:start position:0%
questions from cases that might come up
 
05:09:33.750 --> 05:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
that's not as expensive per case when
 
05:09:35.510 --> 05:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
you say answer right to no questions you
 
05:09:37.230 --> 05:09:37.240 align:start position:0%
mean someone submits a right to no
 
05:09:38.948 --> 05:09:38.958 align:start position:0%
request and there's some dispute over
 
05:09:41.670 --> 05:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
whether do should be turned over right
 
05:09:44.070 --> 05:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
that the current procedure is them to go
 
05:09:46.990 --> 05:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
to the abman for an answer and if
 
05:09:49.270 --> 05:09:49.280 align:start position:0%
there's might be a better scenario in
 
05:09:51.548 --> 05:09:51.558 align:start position:0%
your mind that we might be able to
 
05:09:53.708 --> 05:09:53.718 align:start position:0%
implement I guess ju just thinking about
 
05:09:56.390 --> 05:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
it my my first question would not
 
05:09:57.910 --> 05:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
necessar to you but that I'd be thinking
 
05:10:00.708 --> 05:10:00.718 align:start position:0%
of is is is it expensive per case
 
05:10:03.670 --> 05:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
because he's just not getting as many
 
05:10:06.350 --> 05:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
yes cases as he should yeah it's it's a
 
05:10:10.070 --> 05:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
$170,000 guy who gets 33 cases a year so
 
05:10:11.948 --> 05:10:11.958 align:start position:0%
that's the in my mind the answer might
 
05:10:13.470 --> 05:10:13.480 align:start position:0%
be just making sure people know he
 
05:10:15.948 --> 05:10:15.958 align:start position:0%
exists and that's an option right it it
 
05:10:18.470 --> 05:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
very well could be that you know the
 
05:10:20.590 --> 05:10:20.600 align:start position:0%
general public just hasn't been well
 
05:10:22.548 --> 05:10:22.558 align:start position:0%
enough informed that there
 
05:10:26.548 --> 05:10:26.558 align:start position:0%
is this function right or that or
 
05:10:28.510 --> 05:10:28.520 align:start position:0%
perhaps I'd have to take a look back at
 
05:10:30.070 --> 05:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
his statute but maybe maybe there's
 
05:10:31.590 --> 05:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
something in the statutory language
 
05:10:33.590 --> 05:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
around the Ombudsman that for whatever
 
05:10:35.548 --> 05:10:35.558 align:start position:0%
reason is narrowing the cases that that
 
05:10:39.948 --> 05:10:39.958 align:start position:0%
can go to him but I it the
 
05:10:42.670 --> 05:10:42.680 align:start position:0%
the basic idea of an ombudsman makes
 
05:10:44.990 --> 05:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
sense to me and it strikes me that the
 
05:10:46.788 --> 05:10:46.798 align:start position:0%
reason that it's so expensive per case
 
05:10:49.070 --> 05:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
is he's just not getting a lot of cases
 
05:10:51.150 --> 05:10:51.160 align:start position:0%
so I I think my first thought would be
 
05:10:53.310 --> 05:10:53.320 align:start position:0%
how do we direct more cases that way and
 
05:10:55.510 --> 05:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
get more cases flowing through him we're
 
05:10:57.270 --> 05:10:57.280 align:start position:0%
not looking to create more work we're
 
05:10:59.628 --> 05:10:59.638 align:start position:0%
looking to spend less money right right
 
05:11:02.310 --> 05:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
so there are these other boards that
 
05:11:06.070 --> 05:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
deal with cases where the the board
 
05:11:09.628 --> 05:11:09.638 align:start position:0%
members are paid on a per per case basis
 
05:11:12.030 --> 05:11:12.040 align:start position:0%
right one of the you know um labor
 
05:11:14.750 --> 05:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
contract type cases and so on they have
 
05:11:17.270 --> 05:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
they have Boards of people who only when
 
05:11:20.270 --> 05:11:20.280 align:start position:0%
they sit they get $200 or $400 or
 
05:11:22.590 --> 05:11:22.600 align:start position:0%
whatever so we're thinking in this
 
05:11:25.670 --> 05:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
particular case of making the the
 
05:11:28.830 --> 05:11:28.840 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman part-time and just when they
 
05:11:31.548 --> 05:11:31.558 align:start position:0%
get a case okay there's a payment y
 
05:11:33.708 --> 05:11:33.718 align:start position:0%
right so you know and I can certainly
 
05:11:34.628 --> 05:11:34.638 align:start position:0%
understand that right we're not looking
 
05:11:36.590 --> 05:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
to just create more work to justify the
 
05:11:39.590 --> 05:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
money we spend yeah I just know that
 
05:11:41.750 --> 05:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
there there are a lot of right to no
 
05:11:44.150 --> 05:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
requests and I think one of the reasons
 
05:11:45.708 --> 05:11:45.718 align:start position:0%
the Ombudsman was created in the first
 
05:11:47.750 --> 05:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
place is that it's a lot more cumbersome
 
05:11:50.990 --> 05:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
and takes a lot more time to go to court
 
05:11:52.910 --> 05:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
so I would be
 
05:11:55.190 --> 05:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
hesitant and again these just think off
 
05:11:57.390 --> 05:11:57.400 align:start position:0%
top of my head hesitant to sort of throw
 
05:11:59.190 --> 05:11:59.200 align:start position:0%
out the concept or think he doesn't have
 
05:12:02.470 --> 05:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
enough work to do when I don't think the
 
05:12:03.788 --> 05:12:03.798 align:start position:0%
number of right to know request is
 
05:12:05.750 --> 05:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
dropped and I know that if somebody
 
05:12:07.548 --> 05:12:07.558 align:start position:0%
tries to enforce their rights in court
 
05:12:10.708 --> 05:12:10.718 align:start position:0%
it's going to take a long time yeah so I
 
05:12:13.910 --> 05:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
I that that's my that's my reac he's
 
05:12:15.990 --> 05:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
been operating for two years so you know
 
05:12:17.670 --> 05:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
there is a fair amount of history there
 
05:12:21.670 --> 05:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
yep assuming if we assume that it really
 
05:12:24.190 --> 05:12:24.200 align:start position:0%
is just he's only getting 33 cases and
 
05:12:25.430 --> 05:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
that's just about the number of cases
 
05:12:27.150 --> 05:12:27.160 align:start position:0%
that's going to come through that office
 
05:12:29.910 --> 05:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
I think making it a part-time person or
 
05:12:31.590 --> 05:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
or doing something other than having a
 
05:12:33.390 --> 05:12:33.400 align:start position:0%
full-time employee where you're paying
 
05:12:36.948 --> 05:12:36.958 align:start position:0%
170k a year no matter what is probably
 
05:12:39.270 --> 05:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
the way to go the one caution I would
 
05:12:42.470 --> 05:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
have there is that you know it's easy to
 
05:12:44.750 --> 05:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
say we're going to do that but you also
 
05:12:46.430 --> 05:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
want somebody who's going to do a good
 
05:12:48.310 --> 05:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
job and knows what they're doing and it
 
05:12:50.190 --> 05:12:50.200 align:start position:0%
may be a little harder to do that it
 
05:12:51.590 --> 05:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
just may be less attractive to find a
 
05:12:54.310 --> 05:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
good person if it's a part-time position
 
05:12:56.830 --> 05:12:56.840 align:start position:0%
or if you try to contract the work out
 
05:12:59.150 --> 05:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
we have we've seen this in another
 
05:13:01.030 --> 05:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
context with the hearing the hearing
 
05:13:05.310 --> 05:13:05.320 align:start position:0%
officer function to hear appeals from
 
05:13:09.510 --> 05:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
from decisions of councils at at Dees
 
05:13:12.310 --> 05:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
so it right now we're handling that
 
05:13:13.830 --> 05:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
because that function was transferred to
 
05:13:16.070 --> 05:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
us but what we're doing is assigning it
 
05:13:19.070 --> 05:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
to a lawyer one or more lawyers in our
 
05:13:21.670 --> 05:13:21.680 align:start position:0%
office Who Are Walled off from the from
 
05:13:23.788 --> 05:13:23.798 align:start position:0%
the council functions because it's
 
05:13:26.190 --> 05:13:26.200 align:start position:0%
impossible to contract that work out at
 
05:13:28.030 --> 05:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
the rate we' contract it out for we
 
05:13:30.030 --> 05:13:30.040 align:start position:0%
can't find anyone to do it so it's sort
 
05:13:32.628 --> 05:13:32.638 align:start position:0%
of the same I just throw that out there
 
05:13:35.670 --> 05:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
as as things to think about yeah I mean
 
05:13:37.070 --> 05:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
there's a there's quite a number of
 
05:13:38.548 --> 05:13:38.558 align:start position:0%
these little I mean even the parole
 
05:13:41.110 --> 05:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
board for for example right they they
 
05:13:44.110 --> 05:13:44.120 align:start position:0%
meet pretty often but their pay is very
 
05:13:47.190 --> 05:13:47.200 align:start position:0%
low because they're paid per DM kind of
 
05:13:50.548 --> 05:13:50.558 align:start position:0%
thing right so yep um so I think it's
 
05:13:51.910 --> 05:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
it's more for
 
05:13:56.350 --> 05:13:56.360 align:start position:0%
retired uh attorneys who um you know
 
05:14:01.708 --> 05:14:01.718 align:start position:0%
think of it as as Civic um service right
 
05:14:03.708 --> 05:14:03.718 align:start position:0%
so yeah yeah we we have a great
 
05:14:05.708 --> 05:14:05.718 align:start position:0%
tradition I think of volunteer boards
 
05:14:07.830 --> 05:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
and commissions many of which do a very
 
05:14:09.590 --> 05:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
good job and we don't
 
05:14:11.948 --> 05:14:11.958 align:start position:0%
pay a lot of money for them yeah I think
 
05:14:14.030 --> 05:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
ultimately that that is sort of a policy
 
05:14:15.830 --> 05:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
decision for you all as to whether
 
05:14:16.868 --> 05:14:16.878 align:start position:0%
something like the right to know
 
05:14:19.788 --> 05:14:19.798 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman falls on that volunteer board
 
05:14:21.548 --> 05:14:21.558 align:start position:0%
and commission side of the line or falls
 
05:14:22.788 --> 05:14:22.798 align:start position:0%
on the side of the line where it really
 
05:14:24.628 --> 05:14:24.638 align:start position:0%
needs to be a full-time employee with
 
05:14:26.270 --> 05:14:26.280 align:start position:0%
full salary and benefits and all the
 
05:14:28.030 --> 05:14:28.040 align:start position:0%
cost that comes along with that thank
 
05:14:31.150 --> 05:14:31.160 align:start position:0%
you represent R thank you um thank you
 
05:14:34.390 --> 05:14:34.400 align:start position:0%
uh Mr attorney general so with these the
 
05:14:37.670 --> 05:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
dees councils and the right to know do
 
05:14:40.230 --> 05:14:40.240 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of cases that end up at
 
05:14:42.110 --> 05:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
Court despite the existence of those
 
05:14:43.390 --> 05:14:43.400 align:start position:0%
councils and the
 
05:14:46.590 --> 05:14:46.600 align:start position:0%
udman I mean how many appeals go to
 
05:14:49.470 --> 05:14:49.480 align:start position:0%
court since we've had these councils and
 
05:14:52.948 --> 05:14:52.958 align:start position:0%
udman in place I'm just wondering if you
 
05:14:55.070 --> 05:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
know the the the reason we have them is
 
05:14:58.990 --> 05:14:59.000 align:start position:0%
to discourage or or reduce the amount of
 
05:15:01.430 --> 05:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
of appeals that go to the court level
 
05:15:06.070 --> 05:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:08.788 --> 05:15:08.798 align:start position:0%
question yeah with the councils my sense
 
05:15:10.788 --> 05:15:10.798 align:start position:0%
is we are I mean that system's been in
 
05:15:13.070 --> 05:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
place for a long time the only the only
 
05:15:14.628 --> 05:15:14.638 align:start position:0%
recent change was that the hearing
 
05:15:16.990 --> 05:15:17.000 align:start position:0%
officer function was transferred to to
 
05:15:19.430 --> 05:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
our office because it makes sense that
 
05:15:20.990 --> 05:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't have the councils and then
 
05:15:23.670 --> 05:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
the hearing officer in the same
 
05:15:26.990 --> 05:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
place um the right to no Ombudsman I
 
05:15:28.270 --> 05:15:28.280 align:start position:0%
think it it sort of comes down to what
 
05:15:29.430 --> 05:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
we were what we were talking about with
 
05:15:30.830 --> 05:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
as far as the number of cases he's
 
05:15:35.190 --> 05:15:35.200 align:start position:0%
getting is he not getting more cases
 
05:15:37.548 --> 05:15:37.558 align:start position:0%
because people just are don't want to
 
05:15:39.788 --> 05:15:39.798 align:start position:0%
use him or he it's not turns out not to
 
05:15:41.750 --> 05:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
be a very useful function for anyone who
 
05:15:43.830 --> 05:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
has a right to no dispute with a
 
05:15:46.390 --> 05:15:46.400 align:start position:0%
government entity or is he not getting
 
05:15:50.590 --> 05:15:50.600 align:start position:0%
more cases because people don't know
 
05:15:52.310 --> 05:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
that he's there and that there's an
 
05:15:55.110 --> 05:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
advantage to using him I don't know the
 
05:15:57.708 --> 05:15:57.718 align:start position:0%
answer to that but that that would be a
 
05:15:59.190 --> 05:15:59.200 align:start position:0%
question that I think is worth asking
 
05:16:01.990 --> 05:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
and is kind of attached
 
05:16:04.470 --> 05:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
to are we spending too much on it like
 
05:16:06.590 --> 05:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
is it is it is it successful is it
 
05:16:09.110 --> 05:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
really diverting cases from Court that
 
05:16:11.510 --> 05:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
otherwise might not go okay thank you
 
05:16:13.948 --> 05:16:13.958 align:start position:0%
represent M thank you Mr chairman and
 
05:16:15.868 --> 05:16:15.878 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr attorney general like
 
05:16:17.110 --> 05:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney I want to be
 
05:16:18.830 --> 05:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
respectful of your time but since you're
 
05:16:18.840 --> 05:16:20.470 align:start position:0%
respectful of your time but since you're
here

05:16:20.470 --> 05:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:16:22.750 --> 05:16:22.760 align:start position:0%
um is there an
 
05:16:26.470 --> 05:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to create um and I don't
 
05:16:28.310 --> 05:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
know what you would call it but like a
 
05:16:31.830 --> 05:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
um you know an appeals AB busman within
 
05:16:33.708 --> 05:16:33.718 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice where you have
 
05:16:37.350 --> 05:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
one attorney or a couple attorneys maybe
 
05:16:41.230 --> 05:16:41.240 align:start position:0%
that take on the responsibilities of the
 
05:16:43.470 --> 05:16:43.480 align:start position:0%
right to know on budsman the housing
 
05:16:45.910 --> 05:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
appeals board the Personnel appeals
 
05:16:48.590 --> 05:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
board um you know to provide that kind
 
05:16:53.548 --> 05:16:53.558 align:start position:0%
of um Avenue for people that have uh
 
05:16:55.190 --> 05:16:55.200 align:start position:0%
that want to do an appeal but don't
 
05:16:56.830 --> 05:16:56.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily want to go to court right
 
05:16:58.788 --> 05:16:58.798 align:start position:0%
away where we where we kind of
 
05:17:04.948 --> 05:17:04.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:07.430 --> 05:17:07.440 align:start position:0%
department the the challenge to say
 
05:17:09.510 --> 05:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
consolidating those functions within our
 
05:17:11.868 --> 05:17:11.878 align:start position:0%
department is that we also appear in
 
05:17:14.788 --> 05:17:14.798 align:start position:0%
front of some of those boards and and we
 
05:17:16.350 --> 05:17:16.360 align:start position:0%
do a lot of different things and we
 
05:17:18.190 --> 05:17:18.200 align:start position:0%
split up functions and we have walls in
 
05:17:20.830 --> 05:17:20.840 align:start position:0%
place to avoid conflicts of interest at
 
05:17:23.510 --> 05:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
some point though we might sort of
 
05:17:26.150 --> 05:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
overflow on how much of that we can
 
05:17:28.750 --> 05:17:28.760 align:start position:0%
handle that said I think whether there
 
05:17:31.030 --> 05:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
is a way to consolidate those functions
 
05:17:32.310 --> 05:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
maybe not under the Department of
 
05:17:35.910 --> 05:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
Justice umbrella but under say A you
 
05:17:39.350 --> 05:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
know State appeals un you know Appeals
 
05:17:42.708 --> 05:17:42.718 align:start position:0%
Unit or something like that a commission
 
05:17:44.628 --> 05:17:44.638 align:start position:0%
on appeals you know name it whatever you
 
05:17:46.230 --> 05:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
want you know consolidate some of those
 
05:17:50.548 --> 05:17:50.558 align:start position:0%
functions in in one place there may be
 
05:17:53.868 --> 05:17:53.878 align:start position:0%
some efficiencies to be gained there um
 
05:17:55.548 --> 05:17:55.558 align:start position:0%
I would hesitate at least sitting here
 
05:17:57.750 --> 05:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
today to say that putting that under the
 
05:17:59.628 --> 05:17:59.638 align:start position:0%
doj is a good idea because if you put
 
05:18:02.190 --> 05:18:02.200 align:start position:0%
too much of that under the doj you just
 
05:18:03.628 --> 05:18:03.638 align:start position:0%
start to
 
05:18:06.390 --> 05:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
create so many potential conflicts of
 
05:18:07.788 --> 05:18:07.798 align:start position:0%
interests that we don't have enough
 
05:18:10.628 --> 05:18:10.638 align:start position:0%
lawyers anymore to spread out the work
 
05:18:13.430 --> 05:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
and put up the walls to avoid conflicts
 
05:18:16.230 --> 05:18:16.240 align:start position:0%
representative evil thank you thank you
 
05:18:18.030 --> 05:18:18.040 align:start position:0%
again sorry to take your time but this
 
05:18:23.150 --> 05:18:23.160 align:start position:0%
is hey I'm here yeah right um so we're
 
05:18:27.590 --> 05:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
dealing with um this Indigent count uh
 
05:18:31.868 --> 05:18:31.878 align:start position:0%
Council for Indigent um folks crisis I
 
05:18:33.750 --> 05:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
think I heard it I saw it call in the
 
05:18:36.110 --> 05:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
bar news and of course we're going to be
 
05:18:39.070 --> 05:18:39.080 align:start position:0%
working on the judicial Council budget I
 
05:18:41.708 --> 05:18:41.718 align:start position:0%
just wanted to ask you a general
 
05:18:43.990 --> 05:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
question what what you thought of that
 
05:18:45.948 --> 05:18:45.958 align:start position:0%
situation how that affects the
 
05:18:48.910 --> 05:18:48.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice if you have
 
05:18:51.868 --> 05:18:51.878 align:start position:0%
any any thoughts that might be helpful
 
05:18:56.628 --> 05:18:56.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:59.470 --> 05:18:59.480 align:start position:0%
budget and if you don't it's okay yeah I
 
05:19:02.470 --> 05:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
I do have thoughts yeah I think you're
 
05:19:04.510 --> 05:19:04.520 align:start position:0%
referring to the Indigent defense crisis
 
05:19:06.670 --> 05:19:06.680 align:start position:0%
right so just the the both the
 
05:19:08.310 --> 05:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
difficulties that the public defender
 
05:19:10.350 --> 05:19:10.360 align:start position:0%
has faced over the past few years both
 
05:19:12.270 --> 05:19:12.280 align:start position:0%
with losing public defenders and then
 
05:19:14.910 --> 05:19:14.920 align:start position:0%
finding contract counsel to represent
 
05:19:16.750 --> 05:19:16.760 align:start position:0%
those who are indent and can't afford an
 
05:19:19.270 --> 05:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
attorney in criminal
 
05:19:21.150 --> 05:19:21.160 align:start position:0%
cases I think what I would say just
 
05:19:22.990 --> 05:19:23.000 align:start position:0%
first as a general matter it's really
 
05:19:25.030 --> 05:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
important issue right we need to make
 
05:19:27.430 --> 05:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
sure that criminal defendants who can't
 
05:19:29.590 --> 05:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
afford a lawyer have access to a lawyer
 
05:19:31.868 --> 05:19:31.878 align:start position:0%
so have access to Justice that's how we
 
05:19:34.390 --> 05:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
ensure that uh folks constitutional
 
05:19:36.030 --> 05:19:36.040 align:start position:0%
rights are protected and all of their
 
05:19:38.110 --> 05:19:38.120 align:start position:0%
rights are protected if they're charged
 
05:19:40.948 --> 05:19:40.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:42.670 --> 05:19:42.680 align:start position:0%
I also think there's a number of factors
 
05:19:47.110 --> 05:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
at play with the Indigent defense crisis
 
05:19:49.948 --> 05:19:49.958 align:start position:0%
and we have been involved at the doj in
 
05:19:51.510 --> 05:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
the past few years in discussions about
 
05:19:55.110 --> 05:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
how to handle it because while we our
 
05:19:56.990 --> 05:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
function is to prosecute crimes and we
 
05:19:58.270 --> 05:19:58.280 align:start position:0%
oversee the County attorneys who
 
05:20:01.470 --> 05:20:01.480 align:start position:0%
prosecute crimes a prosecutor's
 
05:20:04.390 --> 05:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
obligations extend beyond just charging
 
05:20:05.750 --> 05:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
someone with a crime and getting a
 
05:20:07.470 --> 05:20:07.480 align:start position:0%
conviction a prosecutor's obligation is
 
05:20:09.430 --> 05:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
to do justice an act the interest of
 
05:20:12.948 --> 05:20:12.958 align:start position:0%
justice so we need to do what we can to
 
05:20:14.788 --> 05:20:14.798 align:start position:0%
make sure that people also have access
 
05:20:14.798 --> 05:20:15.868 align:start position:0%
make sure that people also have access
to

05:20:15.868 --> 05:20:15.878 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:20:19.510 --> 05:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
representation uh that said I don't have
 
05:20:22.190 --> 05:20:22.200 align:start position:0%
any perfect solution sitting here in
 
05:20:24.750 --> 05:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
front of you today I just think it's a
 
05:20:27.868 --> 05:20:27.878 align:start position:0%
it's something that every component of
 
05:20:30.270 --> 05:20:30.280 align:start position:0%
the of the legal system and I would say
 
05:20:32.868 --> 05:20:32.878 align:start position:0%
many different voices in the legal
 
05:20:35.030 --> 05:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
Community need need to be involved in
 
05:20:36.990 --> 05:20:37.000 align:start position:0%
the solution and there have been a lot
 
05:20:38.430 --> 05:20:38.440 align:start position:0%
of people at the table in the past few
 
05:20:41.430 --> 05:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
years but but it's a challenge the
 
05:20:42.788 --> 05:20:42.798 align:start position:0%
challenge we were facing two or three
 
05:20:44.548 --> 05:20:44.558 align:start position:0%
years ago was a backlog of criminal
 
05:20:48.590 --> 05:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
cases because of Co I think we have
 
05:20:51.470 --> 05:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
mostly come through that and we've
 
05:20:54.948 --> 05:20:54.958 align:start position:0%
certainly seen a lot of uh a lot of
 
05:20:58.270 --> 05:20:58.280 align:start position:0%
improvement in case loads and and uh a
 
05:21:00.830 --> 05:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
lot of relief from the sort
 
05:21:05.070 --> 05:21:05.080 align:start position:0%
of overload in in in workflow for
 
05:21:07.230 --> 05:21:07.240 align:start position:0%
prosecutors we've seen the same thing on
 
05:21:09.150 --> 05:21:09.160 align:start position:0%
the public defender side the defense
 
05:21:11.030 --> 05:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
side but there's there's other factors
 
05:21:12.788 --> 05:21:12.798 align:start position:0%
at play there that have continued to
 
05:21:16.708 --> 05:21:16.718 align:start position:0%
give them some challenges so it it's uh
 
05:21:18.350 --> 05:21:18.360 align:start position:0%
there's no easy answers but it's
 
05:21:19.390 --> 05:21:19.400 align:start position:0%
certainly something we need to keep
 
05:21:21.350 --> 05:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
working on and it is something at the
 
05:21:22.750 --> 05:21:22.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice we care about
 
05:21:23.990 --> 05:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
because again it extends to Our
 
05:21:26.708 --> 05:21:26.718 align:start position:0%
obligation to yeah to not just prosecute
 
05:21:28.868 --> 05:21:28.878 align:start position:0%
crimes and get convictions but but to do
 
05:21:30.990 --> 05:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
justice so we're very keyed in on this
 
05:21:32.910 --> 05:21:32.920 align:start position:0%
the attorney general or designes sits on
 
05:21:34.910 --> 05:21:34.920 align:start position:0%
the judicial Council so the deputy
 
05:21:36.830 --> 05:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
attorney general Jim buffetti who used
 
05:21:38.190 --> 05:21:38.200 align:start position:0%
to be a public defender is sitting on
 
05:21:41.110 --> 05:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
the IAL Council and and we're in pretty
 
05:21:43.470 --> 05:21:43.480 align:start position:0%
constant communication about these
 
05:21:47.190 --> 05:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
issues well just just just as a followup
 
05:21:50.788 --> 05:21:50.798 align:start position:0%
it it is a true fact that um the we have
 
05:21:54.310 --> 05:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
a responsibility to provide Council for
 
05:21:58.750 --> 05:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
Indigent uh defense right so whether we
 
05:22:03.310 --> 05:22:03.320 align:start position:0%
budget it here or and and if we don't
 
05:22:04.910 --> 05:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
then they need more money we're
 
05:22:07.110 --> 05:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
eventually going to have to pay it by
 
05:22:09.708 --> 05:22:09.718 align:start position:0%
them going to fiscal so it's either a
 
05:22:12.788 --> 05:22:12.798 align:start position:0%
pay now or pay later kind of a situation
 
05:22:16.470 --> 05:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
and I guess the argument um that that
 
05:22:18.310 --> 05:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
that they said that they gave when they
 
05:22:20.110 --> 05:22:20.120 align:start position:0%
were here is if you can't employ
 
05:22:22.310 --> 05:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
somebody in the public defender's office
 
05:22:24.868 --> 05:22:24.878 align:start position:0%
it's far more expensive to hire
 
05:22:28.948 --> 05:22:28.958 align:start position:0%
somebody outside the system yes so by
 
05:22:31.510 --> 05:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
not funding I'm I'm not saying we have a
 
05:22:33.230 --> 05:22:33.240 align:start position:0%
lot of money Mr chair but I'm just
 
05:22:35.590 --> 05:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
making the point that we're kind of in a
 
05:22:38.670 --> 05:22:38.680 align:start position:0%
box because if we don't fund it we're
 
05:22:42.070 --> 05:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
going to pay a lot more later yeah I
 
05:22:44.350 --> 05:22:44.360 align:start position:0%
think that's possible and I I would say
 
05:22:45.868 --> 05:22:45.878 align:start position:0%
since I'm here and because you've given
 
05:22:48.310 --> 05:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
me the opening I would say that the same
 
05:22:50.150 --> 05:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
concept does apply in certain situations
 
05:22:52.590 --> 05:22:52.600 align:start position:0%
to the Department of Justice right if
 
05:22:54.548 --> 05:22:54.558 align:start position:0%
you know so if we don't have lawyers to
 
05:22:55.948 --> 05:22:55.958 align:start position:0%
handle work inh house and we have to go
 
05:22:57.390 --> 05:22:57.400 align:start position:0%
hire outside Council that can actually
 
05:22:59.470 --> 05:22:59.480 align:start position:0%
end up being more expensive but I won't
 
05:23:01.750 --> 05:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
say anything beyond that just thought
 
05:23:04.310 --> 05:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
I'd put in my plug let let me ask about
 
05:23:07.150 --> 05:23:07.160 align:start position:0%
that in particular so you get to make
 
05:23:09.910 --> 05:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
decisions or your office does as to who
 
05:23:12.070 --> 05:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
to charge with a crime and whether to
 
05:23:14.590 --> 05:23:14.600 align:start position:0%
charge somebody with a crime right so
 
05:23:17.510 --> 05:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
presumably some cases are more marginal
 
05:23:22.270 --> 05:23:22.280 align:start position:0%
than others and is it your experience
 
05:23:24.590 --> 05:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
that you look at your
 
05:23:27.788 --> 05:23:27.798 align:start position:0%
resources and decide on these marginal
 
05:23:30.788 --> 05:23:30.798 align:start position:0%
cases that maybe I don't quite have the
 
05:23:33.150 --> 05:23:33.160 align:start position:0%
resources to prosecute this so I will
 
05:23:37.430 --> 05:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
not and or or is it more
 
05:23:39.788 --> 05:23:39.798 align:start position:0%
that everything that you want to
 
05:23:43.430 --> 05:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
prosecute is obvious and and therefore
 
05:23:46.390 --> 05:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
it's just a delay if you decide not to
 
05:23:48.270 --> 05:23:48.280 align:start position:0%
prosecute now you know what I mean
 
05:23:50.590 --> 05:23:50.600 align:start position:0%
because yep yeah it's a great question
 
05:23:52.628 --> 05:23:52.638 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman it's a fair point on the
 
05:23:54.430 --> 05:23:54.440 align:start position:0%
criminal side on the public protection
 
05:23:56.990 --> 05:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
side we do have discretion and we do
 
05:23:58.830 --> 05:23:58.840 align:start position:0%
make some of the we do make calls on
 
05:24:00.750 --> 05:24:00.760 align:start position:0%
that based on available
 
05:24:03.430 --> 05:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
resources what you'll find if you dig
 
05:24:06.030 --> 05:24:06.040 align:start position:0%
into our litigation fund budget and I
 
05:24:07.150 --> 05:24:07.160 align:start position:0%
know we've submitted some of that
 
05:24:09.548 --> 05:24:09.558 align:start position:0%
information to you what drives up
 
05:24:11.310 --> 05:24:11.320 align:start position:0%
outside Council spend if we don't have
 
05:24:13.948 --> 05:24:13.958 align:start position:0%
internal resources is our civil defense
 
05:24:16.910 --> 05:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
work where we don't have control over
 
05:24:18.750 --> 05:24:18.760 align:start position:0%
the workload right because if the state
 
05:24:22.070 --> 05:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
gets sued we have to defend the state so
 
05:24:23.590 --> 05:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
we see that the same concept does it
 
05:24:25.030 --> 05:24:25.040 align:start position:0%
play a
 
05:24:27.510 --> 05:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
doj where we don't have resource
 
05:24:29.548 --> 05:24:29.558 align:start position:0%
discretion when we're on defense and
 
05:24:31.070 --> 05:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
that's the same with the public defender
 
05:24:34.070 --> 05:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
right the public defender cannot control
 
05:24:34.080 --> 05:24:34.830 align:start position:0%
right the public defender cannot control
how

05:24:34.830 --> 05:24:34.840 align:start position:0%
how
 
05:24:37.708 --> 05:24:37.718 align:start position:0%
many cases are charged that's up to the
 
05:24:39.310 --> 05:24:39.320 align:start position:0%
prosecutors in the state the public
 
05:24:41.030 --> 05:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
defender has to try to deal with the
 
05:24:44.110 --> 05:24:44.120 align:start position:0%
workload that's there gotcha okay thank
 
05:24:46.590 --> 05:24:46.600 align:start position:0%
you represent V well another thing that
 
05:24:49.910 --> 05:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
I saw in this um in this article uh a
 
05:24:52.990 --> 05:24:53.000 align:start position:0%
comment made by Mike I capino who I
 
05:24:55.470 --> 05:24:55.480 align:start position:0%
guess is the chair of the board of the
 
05:24:58.190 --> 05:24:58.200 align:start position:0%
Defenders was that um it really can
 
05:25:02.350 --> 05:25:02.360 align:start position:0%
affect the workload the the um the
 
05:25:05.150 --> 05:25:05.160 align:start position:0%
felony level so I guess right now and
 
05:25:09.830 --> 05:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
for quite a while uh a,
 
05:25:12.788 --> 05:25:12.798 align:start position:0%
of theft is a felony but if you moved it
 
05:25:15.390 --> 05:25:15.400 align:start position:0%
to 2,000 or if you moved it to,
 
05:25:19.190 --> 05:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
1500 it would or he said 2500 it could
 
05:25:22.030 --> 05:25:22.040 align:start position:0%
greatly reduce the workload and that
 
05:25:24.510 --> 05:25:24.520 align:start position:0%
might be true for you folks too I know
 
05:25:25.670 --> 05:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
that's not the
 
05:25:32.750 --> 05:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:36.750 --> 05:25:36.760 align:start position:0%
thoughts I this is what I'll say in in
 
05:25:39.030 --> 05:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
on on that concept
 
05:25:42.948 --> 05:25:42.958 align:start position:0%
I I think we need to be very careful
 
05:25:45.628 --> 05:25:45.638 align:start position:0%
about making substantive changes to the
 
05:25:48.868 --> 05:25:48.878 align:start position:0%
criminal laws because of money and and
 
05:25:51.830 --> 05:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
workload right because that also affects
 
05:25:54.190 --> 05:25:54.200 align:start position:0%
access to Justice if you're a victim of
 
05:25:56.470 --> 05:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
theft and it's
 
05:25:58.670 --> 05:25:58.680 align:start position:0%
$1,500 and now all of a sudden that's
 
05:26:01.270 --> 05:26:01.280 align:start position:0%
not a class a felony anymore that's just
 
05:26:03.470 --> 05:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
a misdemeanor because are worried about
 
05:26:06.390 --> 05:26:06.400 align:start position:0%
workload you know that affects Justice
 
05:26:08.788 --> 05:26:08.798 align:start position:0%
for the victim of the theft
 
05:26:12.070 --> 05:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
and it also had you know affects it it
 
05:26:14.310 --> 05:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
affects General deterrence right if we
 
05:26:16.070 --> 05:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
just start watering down our criminal
 
05:26:18.190 --> 05:26:18.200 align:start position:0%
laws because of workload that could have
 
05:26:20.868 --> 05:26:20.878 align:start position:0%
some effects we don't want so while
 
05:26:24.390 --> 05:26:24.400 align:start position:0%
there may be um places where we should
 
05:26:26.548 --> 05:26:26.558 align:start position:0%
have that discussion there are other
 
05:26:28.470 --> 05:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
considerations at play when you start
 
05:26:30.190 --> 05:26:30.200 align:start position:0%
when you start going down that road okay
 
05:26:32.070 --> 05:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah yeah just in general
 
05:26:34.708 --> 05:26:34.718 align:start position:0%
we're we're raising fees for example
 
05:26:37.628 --> 05:26:37.638 align:start position:0%
just in in some cases because they
 
05:26:39.110 --> 05:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
haven't been Chang changed in a long
 
05:26:41.910 --> 05:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
time and the you know $1,000 today is
 
05:26:41.920 --> 05:26:42.708 align:start position:0%
time and the you know $1,000 today is
like

05:26:42.708 --> 05:26:42.718 align:start position:0%
like
 
05:26:45.430 --> 05:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
$500 that's why it 20 years ago or
 
05:26:48.230 --> 05:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
whatever and so this this case of the
 
05:26:50.110 --> 05:26:50.120 align:start position:0%
distinction between misdemeanors and
 
05:26:53.030 --> 05:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
felonies presumably that was changed you
 
05:26:55.590 --> 05:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
know that was set many many years ago so
 
05:26:57.670 --> 05:26:57.680 align:start position:0%
yep it's something to think about anyway
 
05:27:00.430 --> 05:27:00.440 align:start position:0%
all right other questions all right
 
05:27:02.788 --> 05:27:02.798 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for coming Mr chair
 
05:27:05.628 --> 05:27:05.638 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee
 
05:27:10.150 --> 05:27:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:13.030 --> 05:27:13.040 align:start position:0%
okay yeah so let's uh let's talk about
 
05:27:17.510 --> 05:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
his sections here so back to page
 
05:27:19.470 --> 05:27:19.480 align:start position:0%
whatever it
 
05:27:24.270 --> 05:27:24.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:24.280 --> 05:27:30.390 align:start position:0%
 
524

05:27:30.390 --> 05:27:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:34.750 --> 05:27:34.760 align:start position:0%
okay all right page what page 52 let's
 
05:27:37.470 --> 05:27:37.480 align:start position:0%
start with page 52 okay we have to
 
05:27:39.230 --> 05:27:39.240 align:start position:0%
delete off of the
 
05:27:43.430 --> 05:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
Sol right so so in section 114 we're
 
05:27:45.990 --> 05:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
going to need an amendment to take away
 
05:27:49.470 --> 05:27:49.480 align:start position:0%
office of solicitors General
 
05:27:53.070 --> 05:27:53.080 align:start position:0%

2025 occurs I'd actually like to change
 
05:29:49.708 --> 05:29:49.718 align:start position:0%
that to September 1st because any plans
 
05:29:52.270 --> 05:29:52.280 align:start position:0%
that are in process now it really gives
 
05:29:54.190 --> 05:29:54.200 align:start position:0%
con usually contractors might need the
 
05:29:55.750 --> 05:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
whole summer to schedule so either
 
05:29:57.670 --> 05:29:57.680 align:start position:0%
September 1st or October
 
05:30:01.110 --> 05:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
1st I don't see any new projects that
 
05:30:04.548 --> 05:30:04.558 align:start position:0%
someone would agree to now um that would
 
05:30:08.310 --> 05:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
even be able to be completed by July 1st
 
05:30:10.430 --> 05:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
okay could I could I make a an
 
05:30:12.230 --> 05:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
alternative suggestion to say something
 
05:30:14.708 --> 05:30:14.718 align:start position:0%
along the lines of like 60 days after
 
05:30:15.868 --> 05:30:15.878 align:start position:0%
the effective
 
05:30:18.470 --> 05:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
date Mr chair I have some information
 
05:30:21.590 --> 05:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
might help Melissa this so I've been
 
05:30:25.390 --> 05:30:25.400 align:start position:0%
chatting back and forth with um Adam kpo
 
05:30:27.590 --> 05:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
on this so right now they have been
 
05:30:31.150 --> 05:30:31.160 align:start position:0%
holding off on issuing approvals for
 
05:30:33.110 --> 05:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
overwater boat houses since the new
 
05:30:35.868 --> 05:30:35.878 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the law so there isn't
 
05:30:39.190 --> 05:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
anything pending
 
05:30:42.390 --> 05:30:42.400 align:start position:0%
since then however there is one
 
05:30:44.230 --> 05:30:44.240 align:start position:0%
structure that they approved that would
 
05:30:46.510 --> 05:30:46.520 align:start position:0%
be affected but it it's been in place in
 
05:30:48.830 --> 05:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
appeal since December of
 
05:30:51.750 --> 05:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
2022 so I think they would like to get
 
05:30:54.590 --> 05:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
this into law as quick as possible so
 
05:30:56.708 --> 05:30:56.718 align:start position:0%
they can start approving stuff but
 
05:30:58.948 --> 05:30:58.958 align:start position:0%
they're holding off on everything until
 
05:31:01.590 --> 05:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
they have this codified in law so why
 
05:31:03.110 --> 05:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
don't you rewrite it just so it's the
 
05:31:05.788 --> 05:31:05.798 align:start position:0%
regular effective date of the of house
 
05:31:08.910 --> 05:31:08.920 align:start position:0%
bill to okay good
 
05:31:10.430 --> 05:31:10.440 align:start position:0%
and then we'll we'll get we'll see the
 
05:31:12.868 --> 05:31:12.878 align:start position:0%
amendment then come back to this withraw
 
05:31:12.878 --> 05:31:15.070 align:start position:0%
amendment then come back to this withraw
the

05:31:15.070 --> 05:31:15.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:31:18.310 --> 05:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
motion I I don't was we I don't think we
 
05:31:20.110 --> 05:31:20.120 align:start position:0%
had a motion in a second did we we
 
05:31:21.548 --> 05:31:21.558 align:start position:0%
didn't have a
 
05:31:23.750 --> 05:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
second I didn't actually make a motion
 
05:31:26.430 --> 05:31:26.440 align:start position:0%
but I'll move that we accept um section
 
05:31:28.868 --> 05:31:28.878 align:start position:0%
15 with the amendment that any Boat
 
05:31:31.510 --> 05:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
House constructed after the effective
 
05:31:35.830 --> 05:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
date be okay yeah or
 
05:31:39.590 --> 05:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
yeah and and then you want to
 
05:31:42.670 --> 05:31:42.680 align:start position:0%
pass is it just 15 oh never mind okay
 
05:31:44.910 --> 05:31:44.920 align:start position:0%
just 15 sorry just section 15 I'll
 
05:31:48.070 --> 05:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
second or motion okay all right so
 
05:31:51.070 --> 05:31:51.080 align:start position:0%
representative rang um moves that we
 
05:31:54.510 --> 05:31:54.520 align:start position:0%
accept Section 15 but changing the uh
 
05:31:57.110 --> 05:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
two dates to be the same effective date
 
05:32:00.830 --> 05:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
as as house buillt to represent much so
 
05:32:02.350 --> 05:32:02.360 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at my notes here and I have
 
05:32:03.830 --> 05:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
a note said that we wanted to hold this
 
05:32:07.190 --> 05:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
for the public hearing oh do we still
 
05:32:09.510 --> 05:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
want to do that the boat house stuff yes
 
05:32:11.430 --> 05:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
because it was 15 and 16 we wanted to I
 
05:32:13.230 --> 05:32:13.240 align:start position:0%
think you said that I think it was I
 
05:32:15.350 --> 05:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
think it was representative EV yeah
 
05:32:17.628 --> 05:32:17.638 align:start position:0%
whatever that that the public is often
 
05:32:20.590 --> 05:32:20.600 align:start position:0%
interested in in boat houses and things
 
05:32:23.270 --> 05:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
related to boats I think she said it I'm
 
05:32:24.990 --> 05:32:25.000 align:start position:0%
going to blame her no
 
05:32:28.628 --> 05:32:28.638 align:start position:0%
I I don't remember but if there's only
 
05:32:30.830 --> 05:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
if there hasn't been any permits
 
05:32:32.628 --> 05:32:32.638 align:start position:0%

05:32:35.110 --> 05:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
strike all the iron all right all right
 
05:32:36.910 --> 05:32:36.920 align:start position:0%

to indicate
 
05:33:19.030 --> 05:33:19.040 align:start position:0%

05:33:50.230 --> 05:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
out it's just the penalty associated
 
05:33:52.708 --> 05:33:52.718 align:start position:0%

05:34:10.708 --> 05:34:10.718 align:start position:0%
representative evil moves represent a
 
05:34:14.310 --> 05:34:14.320 align:start position:0%

us to do something um that may end up I
 
05:35:11.150 --> 05:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
mean that needs more consideration and
 
05:35:14.948 --> 05:35:14.958 align:start position:0%
we also gain the proceeds of the sale
 
05:35:19.990 --> 05:35:20.000 align:start position:0%

a time please Jack so Edna doesn't
 
05:37:53.708 --> 05:37:53.718 align:start position:0%
provide any actual language for the
 
05:37:55.390 --> 05:37:55.400 align:start position:0%
barbering and cosmetology they just
 
05:37:56.788 --> 05:37:56.798 align:start position:0%
state that they're going to get better
 
05:37:58.830 --> 05:37:58.840 align:start position:0%
wording from the executive director
 
05:38:00.590 --> 05:38:00.600 align:start position:0%
which we still haven't seen oh okay so
 
05:38:03.868 --> 05:38:03.878 align:start position:0%
this one's on hold okay fine I found it
 
05:38:05.910 --> 05:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
all right you found it and it says
 
05:38:08.230 --> 05:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
probably what he just said
 
05:38:11.548 --> 05:38:11.558 align:start position:0%
baring right multiple wording changes
 
05:38:14.110 --> 05:38:14.120 align:start position:0%
okay oh yeah I wrote right there wait
 
05:38:18.190 --> 05:38:18.200 align:start position:0%
wait for op see okay all right good all
 
05:38:20.910 --> 05:38:20.920 align:start position:0%
right so have we asked oplc or are we
 
05:38:22.150 --> 05:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
hoping that she
 
05:38:25.110 --> 05:38:25.120 align:start position:0%
did I'm gonna follow up with that okay
 
05:38:28.310 --> 05:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
thank all right representative rung I
 
05:38:30.070 --> 05:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's relevant to the work
 
05:38:33.430 --> 05:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
we're doing on hb2 but the Senate passed
 
05:38:33.440 --> 05:38:35.070 align:start position:0%
we're doing on hb2 but the Senate passed
SB

05:38:35.070 --> 05:38:35.080 align:start position:0%
SB
 
05:38:37.110 --> 05:38:37.120 align:start position:0%
194 um I believe it went on their
 
05:38:40.070 --> 05:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
consent that would lower the hours to
 
05:38:42.868 --> 05:38:42.878 align:start position:0%
1,200 hours of
 
05:38:45.430 --> 05:38:45.440 align:start position:0%
training um so I don't know I mean if
 
05:38:47.510 --> 05:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
that bill goes through and gets signed
 
05:38:50.150 --> 05:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
into law do we have to make any changes
 
05:38:50.160 --> 05:38:51.430 align:start position:0%
into law do we have to make any changes
to

05:38:51.430 --> 05:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:38:54.830 --> 05:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
hb2 I see because here it says 15500
 
05:38:54.840 --> 05:38:56.468 align:start position:0%
hb2 I see because here it says 15500
hours

05:38:56.468 --> 05:38:56.478 align:start position:0%
hours
 
05:39:00.830 --> 05:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
right yes we would um presumably the
 
05:39:05.030 --> 05:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
Senate would know to do so um unless you
 
05:39:08.150 --> 05:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
want to do it here but but um because
 
05:39:11.788 --> 05:39:11.798 align:start position:0%
because in general House Bill two takes
 
05:39:14.708 --> 05:39:14.718 align:start position:0%
is superior to other bills right so
 
05:39:17.910 --> 05:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
typically what happens is like House
 
05:39:21.430 --> 05:39:21.440 align:start position:0%
Bill 2's effective date is July 1st
 
05:39:24.430 --> 05:39:24.440 align:start position:0%
12:01 a.m. or something like that so any
 
05:39:26.590 --> 05:39:26.600 align:start position:0%
bill that happens that was an effective
 
05:39:28.548 --> 05:39:28.558 align:start position:0%
date of July
 
05:39:32.230 --> 05:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
1st is is inferior to House Bill too
 
05:39:34.830 --> 05:39:34.840 align:start position:0%
right so um anyway so that's something
 
05:39:36.708 --> 05:39:36.718 align:start position:0%
we have to think about or the Senate
 
05:39:38.548 --> 05:39:38.558 align:start position:0%
would have to think about or whatever
 
05:39:40.910 --> 05:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
right so
 
05:39:44.510 --> 05:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
yeah and and the the place that where
 
05:39:47.430 --> 05:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
the continuity happens is
 
05:39:51.350 --> 05:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
because LBA helps the Senate after they
 
05:39:54.110 --> 05:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
finished helping us and they remember
 
05:39:56.468 --> 05:39:56.478 align:start position:0%
this kind of thing and and and figure it
 
05:40:00.070 --> 05:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:00.080 --> 05:40:03.070 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:40:03.070 --> 05:40:03.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:40:06.548 --> 05:40:06.558 align:start position:0%
okay represent a month we just looking
 
05:40:08.190 --> 05:40:08.200 align:start position:0%
through here
 
05:40:09.670 --> 05:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
we haven't we didn't do anything with
 
05:40:09.680 --> 05:40:10.510 align:start position:0%
we haven't we didn't do anything with
the

05:40:10.510 --> 05:40:10.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:40:14.548 --> 05:40:14.558 align:start position:0%
Indigent defendants right the Indigent
 
05:40:16.430 --> 05:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
no we are waiting to hear from the
 
05:40:19.548 --> 05:40:19.558 align:start position:0%
judicial Council I believe right that's
 
05:40:21.310 --> 05:40:21.320 align:start position:0%
correct I sent an email so I'm just
 
05:40:22.910 --> 05:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
waiting I've invited them to come in
 
05:40:25.310 --> 05:40:25.320 align:start position:0%
tomorrow as well as Department of
 
05:40:28.430 --> 05:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
Labor okay represent I'm evil um Mr
 
05:40:29.910 --> 05:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
chair I don't know what your thought is
 
05:40:31.670 --> 05:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
on this but I think in off a lot of
 
05:40:33.590 --> 05:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
people are very interested in what's
 
05:40:36.350 --> 05:40:36.360 align:start position:0%
going on with the with the retirement
 
05:40:38.430 --> 05:40:38.440 align:start position:0%
section so
 
05:40:40.910 --> 05:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
we should like decide what day you're
 
05:40:43.390 --> 05:40:43.400 align:start position:0%
going to do that so people know yeah
 
05:40:46.270 --> 05:40:46.280 align:start position:0%
we're waiting to have get our Amendment
 
05:40:49.670 --> 05:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
ready right I should have that tomorrow
 
05:40:53.548 --> 05:40:53.558 align:start position:0%
okay but but
 
05:40:55.990 --> 05:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
again I don't know that this new
 
05:40:59.030 --> 05:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
spending is as high priority as
 
05:41:01.948 --> 05:41:01.958 align:start position:0%
YDC so maybe we should talk about that
 
05:41:03.510 --> 05:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
we can talk about that right now if you
 
05:41:06.750 --> 05:41:06.760 align:start position:0%
want what would you say would would you
 
05:41:09.150 --> 05:41:09.160 align:start position:0%
would you put the new spending for group
 
05:41:15.030 --> 05:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:18.548 --> 05:41:18.558 align:start position:0%
not represent LE I don't think you can I
 
05:41:21.030 --> 05:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
think you got to use YDC we know that
 
05:41:24.070 --> 05:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
they'll probably be in for $75 million
 
05:41:27.310 --> 05:41:27.320 align:start position:0%
we I don't know per
 
05:41:29.670 --> 05:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
year prevent us from lowering that
 
05:41:31.910 --> 05:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
amount even though we we are committed
 
05:41:34.510 --> 05:41:34.520 align:start position:0%
to 75 there's nothing preventing this
 
05:41:36.868 --> 05:41:36.878 align:start position:0%
legisl from lowering that as far as I'm
 
05:41:38.990 --> 05:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
concern no you're absolutely right my
 
05:41:40.750 --> 05:41:40.760 align:start position:0%
yeah it's it's based on what the
 
05:41:43.510 --> 05:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
legislature allocates right so the way
 
05:41:45.750 --> 05:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
the law is written I believe we have to
 
05:41:48.510 --> 05:41:48.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate the money every bium or
 
05:41:52.590 --> 05:41:52.600 align:start position:0%
every year or whatever so um we could
 
05:41:55.948 --> 05:41:55.958 align:start position:0%
choose not to but the question is that's
 
05:41:59.788 --> 05:41:59.798 align:start position:0%
my question is is if we have money which
 
05:42:02.990 --> 05:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
would we which goes first anyway
 
05:42:03.000 --> 05:42:04.350 align:start position:0%
would we which goes first anyway
represent

05:42:04.350 --> 05:42:04.360 align:start position:0%
represent
 
05:42:07.230 --> 05:42:07.240 align:start position:0%
Ms I had a I had a meeting with the
 
05:42:10.868 --> 05:42:10.878 align:start position:0%
State Treasurer on some other issues um
 
05:42:12.468 --> 05:42:12.478 align:start position:0%
and we just happened to get into a
 
05:42:15.910 --> 05:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
discussion um and if I understood what
 
05:42:18.590 --> 05:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
she said correctly that in the past
 
05:42:21.788 --> 05:42:21.798 align:start position:0%
there had been some at least
 
05:42:23.590 --> 05:42:23.600 align:start position:0%
consideration or discussion I don't know
 
05:42:25.030 --> 05:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
if it got to the point of discussion but
 
05:42:26.788 --> 05:42:26.798 align:start position:0%
some consideration of
 
05:42:30.708 --> 05:42:30.718 align:start position:0%
bonding the obligation for
 
05:42:33.628 --> 05:42:33.638 align:start position:0%
YDC um and I from what I gather there
 
05:42:36.070 --> 05:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
was some discussion that you know well
 
05:42:38.230 --> 05:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
they that wasn't appropriate because you
 
05:42:40.830 --> 05:42:40.840 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be bonding operating costs and
 
05:42:42.468 --> 05:42:42.478 align:start position:0%
my immediate reaction to that when she
 
05:42:44.230 --> 05:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
told me that was well I don't know that
 
05:42:46.788 --> 05:42:46.798 align:start position:0%
that's a operating cost that's a past
 
05:42:48.590 --> 05:42:48.600 align:start position:0%
liability of the state we had a
 
05:42:50.548 --> 05:42:50.558 align:start position:0%
difference of opinion on that um I mean
 
05:42:54.150 --> 05:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
is given given you know the revenue
 
05:42:55.708 --> 05:42:55.718 align:start position:0%
challenges that we have isn't that
 
05:42:57.628 --> 05:42:57.638 align:start position:0%
something we should kind of revisit or
 
05:42:58.708 --> 05:42:58.718 align:start position:0%
at least
 
05:43:02.390 --> 05:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
discuss yeah I I would be very reluctant
 
05:43:04.430 --> 05:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
to do that because we've already
 
05:43:07.830 --> 05:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
effectively bonded it by
 
05:43:11.030 --> 05:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
what's in the law is the delay of 10
 
05:43:13.270 --> 05:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
years over you know to pay it over 10
 
05:43:16.910 --> 05:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
years with interest right so there's
 
05:43:19.070 --> 05:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
interest built into the law that we're
 
05:43:20.990 --> 05:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
we're paying the settlement fund so
 
05:43:24.708 --> 05:43:24.718 align:start position:0%
effectively it already is right so
 
05:43:27.990 --> 05:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
representative run thank you Mr chair so
 
05:43:30.670 --> 05:43:30.680 align:start position:0%
my question is if if we don't fund the
 
05:43:33.510 --> 05:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
YC fund at 75 million a year let's say
 
05:43:37.750 --> 05:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
we cut it to 25 50 million does that
 
05:43:40.628 --> 05:43:40.638 align:start position:0%
expose us to Greater costs by
 
05:43:44.030 --> 05:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
encouraging people to go to uh Court
 
05:43:46.628 --> 05:43:46.638 align:start position:0%
where we don't have no clue what the
 
05:43:49.110 --> 05:43:49.120 align:start position:0%
award would be isn't that isn't that
 
05:43:52.230 --> 05:43:52.240 align:start position:0%
settlement fund like Insurance to uh
 
05:43:54.708 --> 05:43:54.718 align:start position:0%
indemnify risk that we might have if we
 
05:43:56.230 --> 05:43:56.240 align:start position:0%
go to
 
05:43:59.310 --> 05:43:59.320 align:start position:0%
court I'm not sure I I think the answer
 
05:44:02.868 --> 05:44:02.878 align:start position:0%
is yes but I tend to think that the
 
05:44:05.708 --> 05:44:05.718 align:start position:0%
court uh any kind of Court settlements
 
05:44:08.750 --> 05:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
so the the settlements are not just
 
05:44:12.030 --> 05:44:12.040 align:start position:0%
going to people that that
 
05:44:15.390 --> 05:44:15.400 align:start position:0%
um go to the settlement process the the
 
05:44:18.430 --> 05:44:18.440 align:start position:0%
settlements are also direct settlements
 
05:44:21.350 --> 05:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
between uh the attorney general and the
 
05:44:23.708 --> 05:44:23.718 align:start position:0%
plaintiffs right so those kind of cases
 
05:44:25.548 --> 05:44:25.558 align:start position:0%
can be settled and that also comes out
 
05:44:30.390 --> 05:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
of this fund so I don't know when
 
05:44:32.990 --> 05:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
court cases are
 
05:44:36.468 --> 05:44:36.478 align:start position:0%
lost uh if they are whether it comes out
 
05:44:39.948 --> 05:44:39.958 align:start position:0%
of this Fund in particular or other ways
 
05:44:41.670 --> 05:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a good question but a
 
05:44:43.670 --> 05:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
followup is that we'd still be liable if
 
05:44:45.788 --> 05:44:45.798 align:start position:0%
it goes to court we're still liable for
 
05:44:48.708 --> 05:44:48.718 align:start position:0%
that amount sure and I look at the
 
05:44:50.788 --> 05:44:50.798 align:start position:0%
settlement fund the opportunity for
 
05:44:54.190 --> 05:44:54.200 align:start position:0%
plaintiffs to go there once they they
 
05:44:56.230 --> 05:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
settle we know what they're settling for
 
05:44:58.548 --> 05:44:58.558 align:start position:0%
and they're prohibited from seeking any
 
05:45:00.628 --> 05:45:00.638 align:start position:0%
Court action like once they settle they
 
05:45:02.990 --> 05:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
can't now go to court so I think I the
 
05:45:04.708 --> 05:45:04.718 align:start position:0%
devil we know is better than the devil
 
05:45:08.628 --> 05:45:08.638 align:start position:0%
we don't know um so that's why I think
 
05:45:10.548 --> 05:45:10.558 align:start position:0%
the settlement fund should be our top
 
05:45:12.830 --> 05:45:12.840 align:start position:0%
priority because it's protecting future
 
05:45:15.430 --> 05:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
liability or fut it's indemnifying us
 
05:45:18.788 --> 05:45:18.798 align:start position:0%
for future costs no it's not as I as I
 
05:45:23.190 --> 05:45:23.200 align:start position:0%
stated earlier even um after July 1 when
 
05:45:25.070 --> 05:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
PE no more people can sign up for the
 
05:45:29.150 --> 05:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
fund they can the the remaining 23,000
 
05:45:31.030 --> 05:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
or so that went through that system can
 
05:45:33.110 --> 05:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
sue at any time the only ones that
 
05:45:34.868 --> 05:45:34.878 align:start position:0%
cannot Sue are the ones that have
 
05:45:38.270 --> 05:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
already been settled through the fund so
 
05:45:39.788 --> 05:45:39.798 align:start position:0%
that so you know it doesn't matter we're
 
05:45:41.990 --> 05:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
going to be sued From Here to
 
05:45:46.788 --> 05:45:46.798 align:start position:0%
Eternity so uh I I wouldn't worry too
 
05:45:49.150 --> 05:45:49.160 align:start position:0%
much about who's going to go to the to
 
05:45:53.150 --> 05:45:53.160 align:start position:0%
the courts um we just I I think we do
 
05:45:55.590 --> 05:45:55.600 align:start position:0%
need to settle with the ones that come
 
05:45:59.548 --> 05:45:59.558 align:start position:0%
to the for the fund and um that's going
 
05:46:01.750 --> 05:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
to end on July 1st and we should just
 
05:46:03.830 --> 05:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
focus on that because we have no idea
 
05:46:05.910 --> 05:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen in the courts nor
 
05:46:07.510 --> 05:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
we have any idea
 
05:46:11.110 --> 05:46:11.120 align:start position:0%
and to to your point Mr chair um so this
 
05:46:12.708 --> 05:46:12.718 align:start position:0%
10 million that they just agreed to pay
 
05:46:15.030 --> 05:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
out where's that coming from it's not
 
05:46:18.230 --> 05:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
coming from the settlement fund
 
05:46:21.948 --> 05:46:21.958 align:start position:0%
so yeah that's this is going to be crazy
 
05:46:23.868 --> 05:46:23.878 align:start position:0%
I would just focus on the settlement
 
05:46:25.788 --> 05:46:25.798 align:start position:0%
fund at least get those people out of
 
05:46:29.190 --> 05:46:29.200 align:start position:0%
the way and uh I think that if we
 
05:46:32.230 --> 05:46:32.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate something less than 20 than
 
05:46:34.628 --> 05:46:34.638 align:start position:0%
75 million it at least gives them they
 
05:46:36.948 --> 05:46:36.958 align:start position:0%
they have currently I think 28 to 30
 
05:46:39.628 --> 05:46:39.638 align:start position:0%
million left in the fund uh to still to
 
05:46:42.510 --> 05:46:42.520 align:start position:0%
Dole out if we give them another 25 that
 
05:46:44.948 --> 05:46:44.958 align:start position:0%
will allow them to continue to make
 
05:46:48.468 --> 05:46:48.478 align:start position:0%
payments um but I I see 75 as being
 
05:46:50.510 --> 05:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
untenable at this I thought the letter
 
05:46:52.110 --> 05:46:52.120 align:start position:0%
we received said that they're about to
 
05:46:54.708 --> 05:46:54.718 align:start position:0%
run out yeah they they did and we've
 
05:46:57.270 --> 05:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
only got yeah and we had the boy he
 
05:46:59.070 --> 05:46:59.080 align:start position:0%
spent that quickly since he was here in
 
05:46:59.080 --> 05:46:59.948 align:start position:0%
spent that quickly since he was here in
three

05:46:59.948 --> 05:46:59.958 align:start position:0%
three
 
05:47:03.788 --> 05:47:03.798 align:start position:0%
days anyways representative evil I
 
05:47:07.628 --> 05:47:07.638 align:start position:0%
mean I I think we have a a commitment
 
05:47:10.670 --> 05:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
under that settlement and it's also it
 
05:47:13.590 --> 05:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
was it's it's something that was so
 
05:47:17.430 --> 05:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
carefully crafted that whole statute
 
05:47:20.510 --> 05:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
over a period of time and again if we if
 
05:47:23.590 --> 05:47:23.600 align:start position:0%
we C if we reduce the amount of money in
 
05:47:25.628 --> 05:47:25.638 align:start position:0%
that or anything I would I would I just
 
05:47:28.070 --> 05:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't do it without including the
 
05:47:31.070 --> 05:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
attorney general in the discussion but I
 
05:47:33.788 --> 05:47:33.798 align:start position:0%
guess this may be a stupid question but
 
05:47:35.510 --> 05:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
why didn't the governor put it in her
 
05:47:37.868 --> 05:47:37.878 align:start position:0%
budget is there some option out there
 
05:47:41.230 --> 05:47:41.240 align:start position:0%
that she thinks is there for doing this
 
05:47:43.190 --> 05:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
that we're not thinking of I don't I
 
05:47:45.390 --> 05:47:45.400 align:start position:0%
don't understand why it's not in there
 
05:47:48.150 --> 05:47:48.160 align:start position:0%
because that makes us the bad guys I
 
05:47:50.910 --> 05:47:50.920 align:start position:0%
mean is that the okay I was trying to
 
05:47:53.110 --> 05:47:53.120 align:start position:0%
see if there was some other rationale
 
05:47:55.830 --> 05:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
other than that I I believe what we
 
05:47:58.948 --> 05:47:58.958 align:start position:0%
heard was that she wanted to review the
 
05:48:01.510 --> 05:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
whole situation right and so didn't want
 
05:48:05.350 --> 05:48:05.360 align:start position:0%
to sort of make a decision about it so
 
05:48:07.270 --> 05:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
quickly but but
 
05:48:09.468 --> 05:48:09.478 align:start position:0%
I don't know for sure I mean you know
 
05:48:13.708 --> 05:48:13.718 align:start position:0%
it's just it's really odd it it I would
 
05:48:16.230 --> 05:48:16.240 align:start position:0%
agree with you okay any
 
05:48:18.670 --> 05:48:18.680 align:start position:0%
other people want to people so I'm
 
05:48:21.910 --> 05:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
hearing that that that from multiple
 
05:48:25.070 --> 05:48:25.080 align:start position:0%
people that the YDC situation is more
 
05:48:28.030 --> 05:48:28.040 align:start position:0%
dire than the group two situation right
 
05:48:31.110 --> 05:48:31.120 align:start position:0%
if if it came to that so and and I feel
 
05:48:34.590 --> 05:48:34.600 align:start position:0%
the same way so okay so so therefore
 
05:48:37.548 --> 05:48:37.558 align:start position:0%
spending a lot of time on group two
 
05:48:40.750 --> 05:48:40.760 align:start position:0%
matters may not make sense
 
05:48:43.190 --> 05:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
yeahor I guess I just want to make I
 
05:48:44.910 --> 05:48:44.920 align:start position:0%
just guess I want to just make sure that
 
05:48:47.270 --> 05:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
people understand that um while I think
 
05:48:50.150 --> 05:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
the YDC issue is an important one I that
 
05:48:51.750 --> 05:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
in my mind that doesn't diminish the
 
05:48:53.948 --> 05:48:53.958 align:start position:0%
importance of the retirement account so
 
05:48:55.390 --> 05:48:55.400 align:start position:0%
I think they we need to be looking at
 
05:49:00.750 --> 05:49:00.760 align:start position:0%
both of them okay yeah I mean I I'm I
 
05:49:02.590 --> 05:49:02.600 align:start position:0%
think I'm with you but I also think
 
05:49:04.868 --> 05:49:04.878 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of people that care a lot
 
05:49:07.430 --> 05:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh this fellow in the backs roow there
 
05:49:10.070 --> 05:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
was sitting all day long you know to
 
05:49:12.548 --> 05:49:12.558 align:start position:0%
hear what might be said about retirement
 
05:49:14.510 --> 05:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing from a lot of people a lot
 
05:49:16.830 --> 05:49:16.840 align:start position:0%
of interest and I think we should at
 
05:49:18.788 --> 05:49:18.798 align:start position:0%
least let them know the day that we're
 
05:49:20.948 --> 05:49:20.958 align:start position:0%
talking about it here in the division so
 
05:49:23.628 --> 05:49:23.638 align:start position:0%
they can have the opportunity to come if
 
05:49:27.030 --> 05:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
they want okay that just seems fair well
 
05:49:28.628 --> 05:49:28.638 align:start position:0%
and they can come to the public hearing
 
05:49:32.230 --> 05:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
on Wednesday right so representative
 
05:49:34.628 --> 05:49:34.638 align:start position:0%
camell I agree with representative Ms
 
05:49:37.110 --> 05:49:37.120 align:start position:0%
the there's no reason why we can't look
 
05:49:39.948 --> 05:49:39.958 align:start position:0%
at both that's why I'm saying we should
 
05:49:43.350 --> 05:49:43.360 align:start position:0%
reduce the YDC but also take care of our
 
05:49:46.270 --> 05:49:46.280 align:start position:0%
very needed emergency response people I
 
05:49:48.270 --> 05:49:48.280 align:start position:0%
think we can do both but that's going to
 
05:49:50.590 --> 05:49:50.600 align:start position:0%
mean that maybe the YDC has to have a
 
05:49:53.590 --> 05:49:53.600 align:start position:0%
little bit of a sacrifice and again
 
05:49:55.230 --> 05:49:55.240 align:start position:0%
those people were not providing public
 
05:50:00.350 --> 05:50:00.360 align:start position:0%
service to us uh they they were in that
 
05:50:02.150 --> 05:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
place for a reason not that they deserve
 
05:50:05.390 --> 05:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
what happen but uh those were
 
05:50:07.590 --> 05:50:07.600 align:start position:0%
circumstances the
 
05:50:10.468 --> 05:50:10.478 align:start position:0%
bad circumstances that occur to them but
 
05:50:11.990 --> 05:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh it's not in they're not in the same
 
05:50:15.628 --> 05:50:15.638 align:start position:0%
league as people who are uh uh public
 
05:50:18.390 --> 05:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
service and emergency responders I just
 
05:50:21.150 --> 05:50:21.160 align:start position:0%
I I don't think it's fair to compare the
 
05:50:22.868 --> 05:50:22.878 align:start position:0%
the two
 
05:50:26.830 --> 05:50:26.840 align:start position:0%
groups all right it's all about money
 
05:50:28.548 --> 05:50:28.558 align:start position:0%
okay and
 
05:50:30.948 --> 05:50:30.958 align:start position:0%
so you know you can't spend more than
 
05:50:34.190 --> 05:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
you have and and um and you have to
 
05:50:37.110 --> 05:50:37.120 align:start position:0%
prioritize I mean that's that's all you
 
05:50:39.390 --> 05:50:39.400 align:start position:0%
can do all right all right so we are
 
05:50:41.990 --> 05:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
meeting tomorrow at 10: is that right
 
05:50:44.390 --> 05:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
okay and and who's coming to meet with
 
05:50:47.190 --> 05:50:47.200 align:start position:0%
us and at what time we are trying to
 
05:50:49.468 --> 05:50:49.478 align:start position:0%
schedule Department of Labor which I'm
 
05:50:50.788 --> 05:50:50.798 align:start position:0%
asking if they'll come in at 10:
 
05:50:52.910 --> 05:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
tomorrow sending that email right now
 
05:50:54.910 --> 05:50:54.920 align:start position:0%

judicial um councel if he responds back
 
05:51:01.230 --> 05:51:01.240 align:start position:0%
okay good all right good well we can
 
05:51:03.430 --> 05:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
maybe even start to get into house bill
 
05:51:06.150 --> 05:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
one things tomorrow if we if we have
 
05:51:08.190 --> 05:51:08.200 align:start position:0%
time right okay good we going to talk
 
05:51:10.670 --> 05:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
about this fee chart at some point too
 
05:51:12.708 --> 05:51:12.718 align:start position:0%
or you want to hold off on that yeah no
 
05:51:14.150 --> 05:51:14.160 align:start position:0%

05:51:27.150 --> 05:51:27.160 align:start position:0%
so um representative evil suggests that
 
05:51:32.548 --> 05:51:32.558 align:start position:0%
we speak about um Dees fees tomorrow
 
05:51:35.070 --> 05:51:35.080 align:start position:0%
because they brought a nice chart and
 
05:51:38.750 --> 05:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
and gave us some uh some guidance on how
 
05:51:40.510 --> 05:51:40.520 align:start position:0%
those fees can be changed but they
 
05:51:44.230 --> 05:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
already had fees in here right
 
05:51:48.390 --> 05:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
