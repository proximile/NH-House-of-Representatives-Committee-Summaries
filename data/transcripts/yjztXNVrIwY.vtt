i've i've had some discussions with
 
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
senator ryder
 
00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
and with crochet
 
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
and i got a feeling that if we
 
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
push it maybe beyond 12 or so we might
 
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
be able to not meet tomorrow but let's
 
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
there's a few things i want to mention
 
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:44.309 --> 00:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:47.600 align:start position:0%
and so i've got a senate message and
 
00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
and that house bill 15 was to deal with
 
00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:54.639 align:start position:0%
the car rental
 
00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
make sure that all car rentals pay the
 
00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
rooms and meals tax it would be
 
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
effective 60 days after passage
 
00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
so if um let's say it passed and the
 
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
governor signed it
 
00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
july 1st then
 
00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
the senate at the request of the gra
 
00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:25.360 align:start position:0%
changed it to october 1st just another
 
00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
30 days
 
00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
does anybody on this committee have a
 
00:07:32.469 --> 00:07:32.479 align:start position:0%
problem with that
 
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
it's not is everybody on the committee
 
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
an agreement to concur
 
00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
we don't take a vote just put your hand
 
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:43.360 align:start position:0%
up if they're not
 
00:07:46.309 --> 00:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
not or yes if you don't want to concur
 
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to re represent
 
00:07:56.629 --> 00:07:56.639 align:start position:0%
over but no
 
00:08:00.309 --> 00:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
i don't see any hands so i'll let the
 
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
clerk know that we will be concurring
 
00:08:09.029 --> 00:08:09.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:12.469 --> 00:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
now this past week
 
00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:24.160 align:start position:0%
which would put the landfill bill
 
00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
house bill 177 on 103 and 103 was the
 
00:08:30.309 --> 00:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
disaster related
 
00:08:33.509 --> 00:08:33.519 align:start position:0%
emergency bill which allowed
 
00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
these utilities in an emergency to come
 
00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
in and start restoration
 
00:08:42.469 --> 00:08:42.479 align:start position:0%
without all the required
 
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:44.240 align:start position:0%
paperwork that would normally go with
 
00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.310 align:start position:0%
paperwork that would normally go with
that

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
i talked to senator greiter and
 
00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
senator ryder the senate position is
 
00:08:59.190 --> 00:08:59.200 align:start position:0%
they who would want to take it out
 
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh committee or conference so
 
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry could you repeat that senator
 
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:10.720 align:start position:0%
uh geider feeling is at the committee of
 
00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:11.750 align:start position:0%
uh geider feeling is at the committee of
conference

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
conference
 
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
the senate would want to remove the
 
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:17.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:20.949 --> 00:09:20.959 align:start position:0%
177 from 103 because they
 
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:40.160 align:start position:0%
this the senate will probably send us a
 
00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.829 align:start position:0%
this the senate will probably send us a
message

00:09:41.829 --> 00:09:41.839 align:start position:0%
message
 
00:09:44.389 --> 00:09:44.399 align:start position:0%
uh one concurring forming a committee of
 
00:09:44.399 --> 00:09:45.030 align:start position:0%
uh one concurring forming a committee of
conference

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
conference
 
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
on that so they will form
 
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:51.360 align:start position:0%
i'm asking because i'm the prime sponsor
 
00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.389 align:start position:0%
i'm asking because i'm the prime sponsor
of

00:09:52.389 --> 00:09:52.399 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
hb 177. and i haven't been through this
 
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
with a bill of mine so i need to
 
00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.269 align:start position:0%
with a bill of mine so i need to
understand

00:09:59.269 --> 00:09:59.279 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
what you're saying so it will go to a
 
00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
committee of conference
 
00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:08.240 align:start position:0%
if they concur and form a committee
 
00:10:10.949 --> 00:10:10.959 align:start position:0%
conference they will
 
00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
if they do not concur dials
 
00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
and so you're telling us those die so
 
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
what are you telling us that you think
 
00:10:20.069 --> 00:10:20.079 align:start position:0%
is going to
 
00:10:23.509 --> 00:10:23.519 align:start position:0%
uh senator god has said that it goes to
 
00:10:25.509 --> 00:10:25.519 align:start position:0%
committee conference
 
00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
that the senate will
 
00:10:32.949 --> 00:10:32.959 align:start position:0%
want to remove it since they as a senate
 
00:10:38.949 --> 00:10:38.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
senate bill 103 is a
 
00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
very important bill for the state and
 
00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
they know that
 
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
that's why they put it onto this bill
 
00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
i think we've got to concur i mean we've
 
00:10:56.949 --> 00:10:56.959 align:start position:0%
got to uh i think we got to go to the
 
00:11:00.069 --> 00:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
committee at conference
 
00:11:01.829 --> 00:11:01.839 align:start position:0%
we have to go to committee conference
 
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
some of us on
 
00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
obviously those of us who were on
 
00:11:07.269 --> 00:11:07.279 align:start position:0%
winning side of the
 
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
amendment would want to be represented
 
00:11:11.509 --> 00:11:11.519 align:start position:0%
on that committee of conference
 
00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:15.200 align:start position:0%
thank you all right so
 
00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
uh then the position of the committee
 
00:11:19.509 --> 00:11:19.519 align:start position:0%
and let's see if we
 
00:11:23.509 --> 00:11:23.519 align:start position:0%
agree with this is to
 
00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
non-curb concur and form a committee
 
00:11:28.949 --> 00:11:28.959 align:start position:0%
a conference or that they would have to
 
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
do that
 
00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
that's what that's that's going to be
 
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
their message to us and i guess
 
00:11:34.949 --> 00:11:34.959 align:start position:0%
we're saying yes we'll accept the
 
00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
committee a conference our position
 
00:11:38.069 --> 00:11:38.079 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
that was settled on the floor with a
 
00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
all right and then the third one
 
00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:00.160 align:start position:0%
i talked to senator geider relative to
 
00:12:02.629 --> 00:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
senate bill 101
 
00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
was changed from 75 000 to 92 000 to
 
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
account for
 
00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
foster living and then the addition
 
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
of having a cost of living factor in
 
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
there going
 
00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
forward he he has talked to
 
00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor that bill and she does
 
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:43.829 --> 00:12:43.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
if not then we'll go into the revenue
 
00:12:53.509 --> 00:12:53.519 align:start position:0%
press say
 
00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
good morning reps of major i'm here okay
 
00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:57.750 align:start position:0%
good morning reps of major i'm here okay
good

00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
now of course we'll go over the senate
 
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
ways and means revenues that are in
 
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
their past house bill 1 and hospital 2.
 
00:13:12.629 --> 00:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
we must remember when we did our revenue
 
00:13:12.639 --> 00:13:13.190 align:start position:0%
we must remember when we did our revenue
estimates

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:13.200 align:start position:0%
estimates
 
00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
it was in march 18th we didn't have
 
00:13:19.829 --> 00:13:19.839 align:start position:0%
the full revenues of march
 
00:13:22.069 --> 00:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
all the four revenues of april which are
 
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
the two heavy revenue
 
00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
producing months so the senate had an
 
00:13:32.829 --> 00:13:32.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:32.839 --> 00:13:43.030 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
um so we'll go over that
 
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
i i think that there's not that
 
00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
well let's go over and take them one at
 
00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
a time go ahead
 
00:13:58.949 --> 00:13:58.959 align:start position:0%
chris it's yours to explain the senate
 
00:14:01.269 --> 00:14:01.279 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates relative to what we
 
00:14:01.279 --> 00:14:02.389 align:start position:0%

00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:16.399 align:start position:0%
2021 and it said final on it and i'm
 
00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:17.600 align:start position:0%

00:14:27.189 --> 00:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
so the first the first page
 
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
after the date page let's blow it up a
 
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
are the dra tax estimate ranges that
 
00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:45.519 align:start position:0%
they provided for the business tax meals
 
00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
and rooms tobacco
 
00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
real estate transfer utility property
 
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
all the same taxes that they did with
 
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
your committee
 
00:14:56.069 --> 00:14:56.079 align:start position:0%
back in um march with different numbers
 
00:14:56.949 --> 00:14:56.959 align:start position:0%
because there's
 
00:14:59.430 --> 00:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
a different time period exactly so
 
00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
they're updated to reflect
 
00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
um what occurred through april
 
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
and if you were to look back at what you
 
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
had back in march and what you see here
 
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
the numbers are going to be
 
00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
slightly different in some instances and
 
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
and largely different in others
 
00:15:16.069 --> 00:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
particularly with the business taxes
 
00:15:17.829 --> 00:15:17.839 align:start position:0%
but again they the process was similar
 
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
to what you went through where dra
 
00:15:20.629 --> 00:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
provides a
 
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
a high and a low and then a percent
 
00:15:24.629 --> 00:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
growth to apply to the low and a percent
 
00:15:25.189 --> 00:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
growth to
 
00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:27.839 align:start position:0%
apply to the high to provide a range for
 
00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
the committee to consider when they're
 
00:15:33.749 --> 00:15:33.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:45.680 align:start position:0%
so what we have here is is your current
 
00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
law estimates for your
 
00:15:50.389 --> 00:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
various revenue sources and you had the
 
00:15:52.389 --> 00:15:52.399 align:start position:0%
plan for fiscal year 21 and then the
 
00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
house ways in means for 21 22
 
00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
23 followed by the senate weighs in
 
00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
means 21
 
00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
22 23 and then the difference between
 
00:16:02.069 --> 00:16:02.079 align:start position:0%
your estimates
 
00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:05.519 align:start position:0%
in all those estimates this is where the
 
00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
anomaly removed from 21.
 
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
yeah so you'll notice there's an
 
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
asterisk on the fiscal year 21
 
00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:14.240 align:start position:0%
that indicates that that 30.8 million
 
00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:15.269 align:start position:0%
that indicates that that 30.8 million
dollars

00:16:15.269 --> 00:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:16:16.949 --> 00:16:16.959 align:start position:0%
was removed from each of the business
 
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
taxes excuse me each of the tax sources
 
00:16:21.749 --> 00:16:21.759 align:start position:0%
described below
 
00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
so for instance the business taxes had
 
00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
18.2 million dollars removed from that
 
00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:29.680 align:start position:0%
in the base number um meals in rooms had
 
00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
1.6 million
 
00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
adjusted downward so yes
 
00:16:38.069 --> 00:16:38.079 align:start position:0%
these numbers um are net of the the
 
00:16:41.509 --> 00:16:41.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
so so the largest difference um is in
 
00:16:45.189 --> 00:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
your business taxes
 
00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:48.720 align:start position:0%
um you can see the senate ways and means
 
00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 21
 
00:16:52.949 --> 00:16:52.959 align:start position:0%
is 126 million dollars higher than what
 
00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
the house projected
 
00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
or estimated 150 million higher than
 
00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
in 22 and then 159 million dollars
 
00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:01.350 align:start position:0%
in 22 and then 159 million dollars
higher

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
higher
 
00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
in 23. and again that's um
 
00:17:07.669 --> 00:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
a result of of the numbers that came in
 
00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
in april
 
00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
um and then some assumptions that the
 
00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
committee made um
 
00:17:15.189 --> 00:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
in terms of growth going into 20 22 and
 
00:17:15.199 --> 00:17:16.789 align:start position:0%
in terms of growth going into 20 22 and
23.

00:17:16.789 --> 00:17:16.799 align:start position:0%
23.
 
00:17:18.789 --> 00:17:18.799 align:start position:0%
um represent brahmin you have your hand
 
00:17:21.029 --> 00:17:21.039 align:start position:0%
up all right representative
 
00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
let me show you are we going to discuss
 
00:17:28.309 --> 00:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
after you get done explaining the
 
00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
columns are you going to go through all
 
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
of them or
 
00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
are we going to discuss each one as we
 
00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:36.799 align:start position:0%
go along we we can do it however is
 
00:17:39.669 --> 00:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
easiest for the committee
 
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
i think for completeness we should take
 
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
one at a time both of the business taxes
 
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
and the meals and loans and
 
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
tobacco taxes right so i'll have a
 
00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
question as soon as you're done
 
00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
explaining the columns uh chris no i i
 
00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
think you can you can ask representable
 
00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much the columns and
 
00:17:59.909 --> 00:17:59.919 align:start position:0%
and it's you know it's fairly simplistic
 
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
um presentation
 
00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
um okay no i think we've seen this
 
00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
this before so uh in terms of the
 
00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
format uh so as of the end of
 
00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
uh may the revenues were 848.1 then you
 
00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:18.280 align:start position:0%
have to subtract
 
00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
18.3 so that puts us at 829.8 million
 
00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:24.710 align:start position:0%
18.3 so that puts us at 829.8 million
dollars

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:28.160 align:start position:0%
that's in the door and obviously we
 
00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
we had estimated uh 837 so that's
 
00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
to get to the senate's number
 
00:18:39.029 --> 00:18:39.039 align:start position:0%
you have to add 133.4
 
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:42.640 align:start position:0%
million dollars for june yep question i
 
00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
have is
 
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
what was planned for june
 
00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
somebody have that handy i couldn't find
 
00:18:51.029 --> 00:18:51.039 align:start position:0%
my document
 
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
i've got it it's on
 
00:18:59.029 --> 00:18:59.039 align:start position:0%
129. so they're being very conservative
 
00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
okay so so and uh
 
00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:04.799 align:start position:0%
i guess the all i'm suggesting is that
 
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
the question is does anybody feel that
 
00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:10.240 align:start position:0%
we're not going to hit the 129.3
 
00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:14.720 align:start position:0%
or we think we're going to hit the 133.4
 
00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:17.200 align:start position:0%
uh you know that's you know uh three
 
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
four million dollar four million dollars
 
00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:19.990 align:start position:0%
four million dollar four million dollars
more

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
uh in june so that's to me that's how we
 
00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
resolve this first column because
 
00:19:27.029 --> 00:19:27.039 align:start position:0%
then everything else is driven off of
 
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
that for the for the
 
00:19:33.669 --> 00:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
out years so uh what did you say 129
 
00:19:37.669 --> 00:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
point 129.3
 
00:19:41.669 --> 00:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
and i estimated out from that
 
00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:44.720 align:start position:0%
two different ways and came
 
00:19:48.549 --> 00:19:48.559 align:start position:0%
in considerably above the senate
 
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
number but i'm wondering if um the dra
 
00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
is worried we may have refunds or that
 
00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
there are other signs that things might
 
00:19:59.280 --> 00:19:59.750 align:start position:0%
there are other signs that things might
might

00:19:59.750 --> 00:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
might
 
00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
be slowing down in june that we should
 
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
be afraid
 
00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
i've asked the dra to be with us
 
00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
jen would you make sure they're to bring
 
00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:11.669 align:start position:0%
jen would you make sure they're to bring
amendments

00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh melissa is on the call i saw her name
 
00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
on the screen and and i don't mind if
 
00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:15.909 align:start position:0%
on the screen and and i don't mind if
she

00:20:15.909 --> 00:20:15.919 align:start position:0%
she
 
00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
would like to jump in um at any point
 
00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:19.510 align:start position:0%
would like to jump in um at any point
but

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
i think the dra is
 
00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
doing the best that they can and making
 
00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:26.240 align:start position:0%
the estimates based on the the
 
00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
wildly inconsistent nature that we've
 
00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
seen revenues
 
00:20:33.029 --> 00:20:33.039 align:start position:0%
occur in the last three four months
 
00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
i don't think anybody anticipated to see
 
00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
revenues especially in the business
 
00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
taxes to be where they are
 
00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
right now um but
 
00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
i'll defer if melissa would like to make
 
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
a comment um
 
00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
and i don't mean to put you on the spot
 
00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
melissa i apologize no
 
00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
no worries uh melissa rollins senior
 
00:20:54.789 --> 00:20:54.799 align:start position:0%
financial analyst for department of
 
00:20:54.799 --> 00:20:55.750 align:start position:0%
financial analyst for department of
revenue

00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
00:20:59.029 --> 00:20:59.039 align:start position:0%
um good questions i do want to note that
 
00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh when the senate did theirs may their
 
00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
estimates may hadn't fully been
 
00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
um completed yet and may did come in
 
00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
higher than anticipated
 
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
uh part of that i believe was due to the
 
00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
um federal extended due date i don't
 
00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
think we anticipated as many taxpayers
 
00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
were going to take
 
00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
advantage of that as you know new
 
00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire did not extend their due date
 
00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
so may came in 14.8 million
 
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
higher than our low end in 10.9 million
 
00:21:30.549 --> 00:21:30.559 align:start position:0%
higher than our high end so there is a
 
00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
little bit of a discrepancy there
 
00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
because it did come in higher than
 
00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:37.909 align:start position:0%
because it did come in higher than
anticipated

00:21:37.909 --> 00:21:37.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:39.669 --> 00:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
and again senate didn't have made
 
00:21:51.029 --> 00:21:51.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
chair i'm just trying to be i guess we
 
00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
got to decide on what
 
00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
methodology we want to use to come up
 
00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
again if we use if we use the
 
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.710 align:start position:0%
again if we use if we use the
[Music]

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:07.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:22:09.909 --> 00:22:09.919 align:start position:0%
129.3 million
 
00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
which is the plan
 
00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
and we add it to the 829.8
 
00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
yeah nine point three twenty nine point
 
00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:40.390 align:start position:0%
yeah nine point three twenty nine point
three

00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
and as of may we're at
 
00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
after we take out the anomalous revenue
 
00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
that's 829.8
 
00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:59.350 --> 00:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
and the senate's at nine
 
00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh was the senate at 9 63.2
 
00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
did i do that right
 
00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
right but susan is saying that
 
00:23:16.149 --> 00:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
she she came up with you came up higher
 
00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
on well the slightly lower number that i
 
00:23:20.789 --> 00:23:20.799 align:start position:0%
came up with
 
00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
was taking the average excluding 2020
 
00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
of on the last five years
 
00:23:31.669 --> 00:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
of how much june is relative to the
 
00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:33.280 align:start position:0%
entire year
 
00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:38.120 align:start position:0%
and that one produced 900 taking out the
 
00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:40.240 align:start position:0%
18.3 whatever it is
 
00:23:43.669 --> 00:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
uh 990.1
 
00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
which is considerably higher but on
 
00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
paying early or whether there are going
 
00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
to be more refunds
 
00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
on so i was just wondering if the dra
 
00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:01.510 align:start position:0%
on so i was just wondering if the dra
was

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
being cautious or whether they were
 
00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
thinking in terms of
 
00:24:08.549 --> 00:24:08.559 align:start position:0%
of the month before which is what they
 
00:24:09.269 --> 00:24:09.279 align:start position:0%
did in
 
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
in the may 26 document
 
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
they started from april
 
00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
but if we did uh make this number higher
 
00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
i think that we should
 
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
anticipate less growth
 
00:24:30.789 --> 00:24:30.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
let me just do one thing uh dra's dras
 
00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:34.390 align:start position:0%
let me just do one thing uh dra's dras
range

00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:34.400 align:start position:0%
range
 
00:24:39.669 --> 00:24:39.679 align:start position:0%
was uh 9 9 47.5
 
00:24:45.029 --> 00:24:45.039 align:start position:0%
and the low high is 964.9
 
00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
divided by 2. so their midpoint
 
00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
was 956.2
 
00:24:58.789 --> 00:24:58.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
and then doing doing what i did taking
 
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
actual plus plan
 
00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
gave us 959.1
 
00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
so i i i want to just to get just to
 
00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
break the uh break the
 
00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
ice here let's just to say
 
00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
okay i'll put that on the table as a
 
00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:21.190 align:start position:0%
okay i'll put that on the table as a
potential

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
potential
 
00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
number 969.1 right
 
00:25:26.789 --> 00:25:26.799 align:start position:0%
and then the basis is current actual
 
00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:28.240 align:start position:0%
actual room a
 
00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
plus plan 959.1
 
00:25:36.149 --> 00:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
and that is that is slightly above
 
00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
like uh three million above
 
00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
let's call it three million above the
 
00:25:44.789 --> 00:25:44.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
melissa on your estimates a lot
 
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
low and high that has removed the
 
00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:53.269 align:start position:0%
low and high that has removed the
anomaly

00:25:53.269 --> 00:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
anomaly
 
00:25:58.870 --> 00:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:00.789 --> 00:26:00.799 align:start position:0%
i'm not wedded to this i'm just saying
 
00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
uh represents spellsbury yes
 
00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:14.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i guess i'm
 
00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:16.240 align:start position:0%
looking for some help understanding this
 
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
as a freshman going through it the first
 
00:26:19.029 --> 00:26:19.039 align:start position:0%
time but
 
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
if we accept uh
 
00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
representative abrami's methodology
 
00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
had 959.1 uh what we're doing is we're
 
00:26:31.909 --> 00:26:31.919 align:start position:0%
we're making our best guess of what
 
00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
actually is received
 
00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
without regard to whether us a
 
00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:38.070 align:start position:0%
without regard to whether us a
significant

00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
significant
 
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
portion may be then subject to to refund
 
00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
so given the amount of uncertainty
 
00:26:49.029 --> 00:26:49.039 align:start position:0%
both on the question we had discussed a
 
00:26:51.029 --> 00:26:51.039 align:start position:0%
couple of months ago regarding the
 
00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
credit carry forward overhang as well as
 
00:26:58.549 --> 00:26:58.559 align:start position:0%
the doubt about how much is attributable
 
00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
to estimates that assumed
 
00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
my concern is how do we go about making
 
00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
our forward projections for fy 22 and 23
 
00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
and the suggestion was made a moment ago
 
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
maybe we need to adjust the growth rates
 
00:27:21.029 --> 00:27:21.039 align:start position:0%
but it seems to me the better
 
00:27:21.039 --> 00:27:22.789 align:start position:0%
but it seems to me the better
methodology

00:27:22.789 --> 00:27:22.799 align:start position:0%
methodology
 
00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
would be to keep the same growth rates
 
00:27:30.149 --> 00:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
unless there's an economic reason to to
 
00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
change them
 
00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
but to make a downward adjustment in the
 
00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:36.389 align:start position:0%
but to make a downward adjustment in the
base

00:27:36.389 --> 00:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
base
 
00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
so that fy21
 
00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
at 959 is adjusted downward
 
00:27:45.029 --> 00:27:45.039 align:start position:0%
to correct for what we think is the
 
00:27:45.039 --> 00:27:46.950 align:start position:0%
to correct for what we think is the
aberrational

00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
aberrational
 
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh excess that may have to be refunded i
 
00:27:51.269 --> 00:27:51.279 align:start position:0%
don't know how to guess at that figure
 
00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
but methodologically i think it makes
 
00:27:56.389 --> 00:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
more sense to adjust
 
00:27:59.510 --> 00:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
the fy21 base down
 
00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
and then apply the same growth rates for
 
00:28:04.549 --> 00:28:04.559 align:start position:0%
fy 22 and 23 that we previously assumed
 
00:28:07.269 --> 00:28:07.279 align:start position:0%
oh mr chair can i react to that please
 
00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
represent brian
 
00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
i'd love to do that too but i think we
 
00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
have to come in with a real number
 
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
for the base because that that number is
 
00:28:18.149 --> 00:28:18.159 align:start position:0%
real when it comes to finance
 
00:28:19.669 --> 00:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
they they use that number because
 
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
they're going to spend that number
 
00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
in future years uh the overage based on
 
00:28:26.389 --> 00:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
that number
 
00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
uh uh so i i i can remember we're
 
00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:32.240 align:start position:0%
projecting what it really is going to be
 
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh i think we have to do our adjusting
 
00:28:35.669 --> 00:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
and out years
 
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
as i you understand that you follow that
 
00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:39.830 align:start position:0%
as i you understand that you follow that
logic

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
logic
 
00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
we can't maybe that we can see what we
 
00:28:44.149 --> 00:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
can do is
 
00:28:45.909 --> 00:28:45.919 align:start position:0%
look this is what we think the revenue
 
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
is really look we're only debating right
 
00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:48.070 align:start position:0%
is really look we're only debating right
now

00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
one month we know you know what the
 
00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:51.590 align:start position:0%
one month we know you know what the
money's

00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
money's
 
00:28:53.269 --> 00:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
what money has come in already through
 
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
the first 11 months
 
00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:56.480 align:start position:0%
we know it's going to be much higher
 
00:28:58.950 --> 00:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
than plan uh
 
00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
so we can't really adjust that down when
 
00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
we show it now when we
 
00:29:06.549 --> 00:29:06.559 align:start position:0%
when we do our math going forward we can
 
00:29:07.269 --> 00:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
on the side
 
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
say okay this was an unusual
 
00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
unusual base here high
 
00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
because of uh the the ppp all that all
 
00:29:20.789 --> 00:29:20.799 align:start position:0%
that stuff
 
00:29:22.389 --> 00:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
and on the side we can reduce it and
 
00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
then do our percentages going forward
 
00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
but i think we have to show i think we
 
00:29:29.909 --> 00:29:29.919 align:start position:0%
have to show 2001 as to what it really
 
00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:32.240 align:start position:0%
is going to be
 
00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
so i think we may be saying the same
 
00:29:37.029 --> 00:29:37.039 align:start position:0%
thing representative abrami
 
00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
i agree that fy 21 has to show what we
 
00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
think we're actually going to collect so
 
00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
whether that's 959 or 963
 
00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
that's the figure we have to show for fy
 
00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
21. i'm just saying that
 
00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
in calculating 22 and 23
 
00:29:55.669 --> 00:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
uh changing the growth rate implies that
 
00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
we think the economy is doing something
 
00:30:00.149 --> 00:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
different whereas changing the base
 
00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
from which the uh
 
00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
the growth rate is applied is
 
00:30:06.789 --> 00:30:06.799 align:start position:0%
methodologically more sound how much of
 
00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
an adjustment
 
00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
to make to the base i don't know so i'm
 
00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
only talking about how we go about
 
00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:12.549 align:start position:0%
only talking about how we go about
projecting

00:30:12.549 --> 00:30:12.559 align:start position:0%
projecting
 
00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
22 and 23. okay why don't we concentrate
 
00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
on the base for 21. we found out
 
00:30:24.789 --> 00:30:24.799 align:start position:0%
what the mythology was for getting to
 
00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
the 959.2
 
00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
of 0.1 and that's to
 
00:30:33.669 --> 00:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
take the revenue that has come in the
 
00:30:33.679 --> 00:30:34.470 align:start position:0%
take the revenue that has come in the
door

00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:34.480 align:start position:0%
door
 
00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
up to date add the plan for
 
00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
june and that gives you the 959.2.1
 
00:30:48.549 --> 00:30:48.559 align:start position:0%
but now who who here
 
00:30:51.909 --> 00:30:51.919 align:start position:0%
is say that the
 
00:30:54.789 --> 00:30:54.799 align:start position:0%
revenue is going to come in as planned
 
00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
or under
 
00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
i don't think so the revenue is going to
 
00:30:58.710 --> 00:30:58.720 align:start position:0%
come in
 
00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
higher because all the other months have
 
00:31:04.149 --> 00:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
come in higher
 
00:31:07.029 --> 00:31:07.039 align:start position:0%
and then the reason and the reasons that
 
00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
they come in higher
 
00:31:11.269 --> 00:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
is a combination of a lot it's
 
00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
the various stimulus things is probably
 
00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:16.640 align:start position:0%
contributed to a lot and that's going to
 
00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:17.269 align:start position:0%
contributed to a lot and that's going to
continue

00:31:17.269 --> 00:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
continue
 
00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
in june so the number that you came up
 
00:31:23.269 --> 00:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
with 959.2
 
00:31:26.389 --> 00:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
needs to be adjusted
 
00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
and i feel upward
 
00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
by an amount which
 
00:31:35.909 --> 00:31:35.919 align:start position:0%
nobody really knows it
 
00:31:39.029 --> 00:31:39.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
the representatives thank you um
 
00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
am i on yeah um
 
00:31:51.269 --> 00:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
i should preface what i say by noting
 
00:31:52.149 --> 00:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
that i was off
 
00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:54.320 align:start position:0%
the internet for about 15 minutes it
 
00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
failed so
 
00:31:58.389 --> 00:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
i missed some of the preambles to this
 
00:31:58.399 --> 00:31:58.870 align:start position:0%
i missed some of the preambles to this
but

00:31:58.870 --> 00:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
i certainly support adjusting the number
 
00:32:04.149 --> 00:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
to the reality that we see now for
 
00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21 to get the best number we
 
00:32:09.029 --> 00:32:09.039 align:start position:0%
can in terms of actual revenues that
 
00:32:10.549 --> 00:32:10.559 align:start position:0%
will be collected
 
00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
um and i
 
00:32:17.509 --> 00:32:17.519 align:start position:0%
so that's that's that then i would also
 
00:32:19.269 --> 00:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
say that i think it's pretty important
 
00:32:19.279 --> 00:32:20.950 align:start position:0%
say that i think it's pretty important
to

00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:32:24.149 --> 00:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
uh have an asterisk a footnote uh
 
00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
some way of differentiating between that
 
00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
which we
 
00:32:31.029 --> 00:32:31.039 align:start position:0%
feel is what we might call base
 
00:32:34.149 --> 00:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
that can be projected forward and uh
 
00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
that which
 
00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
is in some way different and
 
00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
we've got a precedent for this a couple
 
00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
years ago we had
 
00:32:46.789 --> 00:32:46.799 align:start position:0%
a huge anonymous amount of money pouring
 
00:32:46.799 --> 00:32:47.430 align:start position:0%
a huge anonymous amount of money pouring
in

00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
to the state through uh probably through
 
00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:52.480 align:start position:0%
foreign dividends that were taxable in
 
00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire as a result of the federal
 
00:32:58.310 --> 00:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
tax reform law bringing causing
 
00:33:00.789 --> 00:33:00.799 align:start position:0%
repatriation of money by
 
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
mega corporations and uh so we had
 
00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
we did the same thing at fy 21 we had
 
00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:10.640 align:start position:0%
we had the total but we had we had sort
 
00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
of the base
 
00:33:13.509 --> 00:33:13.519 align:start position:0%
number that we thought was the base
 
00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
number and
 
00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
then we split out the anomalous number
 
00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:17.830 align:start position:0%
then we split out the anomalous number
um

00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:21.440 align:start position:0%
and that that aspect of our revenue
 
00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
collection for that year was mentioned
 
00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
in our
 
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
in the cafe actually um so
 
00:33:30.789 --> 00:33:30.799 align:start position:0%
um here we are in a
 
00:33:33.909 --> 00:33:33.919 align:start position:0%
very different but similar conceptually
 
00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
at least
 
00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
situation and we've
 
00:33:41.269 --> 00:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
uh we've got uh the uh
 
00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
difficult uh we've perhaps a more
 
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:44.630 align:start position:0%
difficult uh we've perhaps a more
difficult

00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
00:33:46.549 --> 00:33:46.559 align:start position:0%
separation issue i think it's more
 
00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
difficult than
 
00:33:51.269 --> 00:33:51.279 align:start position:0%
back in fy19 um
 
00:33:54.789 --> 00:33:54.799 align:start position:0%
because it's so difficult to calculate
 
00:33:57.750 --> 00:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
there's the uh what uh representative
 
00:33:59.269 --> 00:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
spillsby mentioned the
 
00:34:02.549 --> 00:34:02.559 align:start position:0%
uh the sp3 uh
 
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
ppp issue um and
 
00:34:09.589 --> 00:34:09.599 align:start position:0%
potential for refunds related to that
 
00:34:13.829 --> 00:34:13.839 align:start position:0%
there's um in a very large sense there's
 
00:34:13.839 --> 00:34:14.310 align:start position:0%
there's um in a very large sense there's
this

00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh incredible stimulus economic stimulus
 
00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
hit new hampshire in a favorable way
 
00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:28.399 align:start position:0%
billions billions of federal dollars
 
00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
flowing into new hampshire enabling
 
00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
people to buy things that they weren't
 
00:34:35.589 --> 00:34:35.599 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have bought before enabling
 
00:34:37.669 --> 00:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
businesses to carry on where they would
 
00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
have failed
 
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
and so forth we all know that this is
 
00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:42.069 align:start position:0%
and so forth we all know that this is
true

00:34:42.069 --> 00:34:42.079 align:start position:0%
true
 
00:34:43.829 --> 00:34:43.839 align:start position:0%
and when you've got that much money
 
00:34:43.839 --> 00:34:45.109 align:start position:0%
and when you've got that much money
that's

00:34:45.109 --> 00:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:34:47.109 --> 00:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
out of the norm flowing in you're going
 
00:34:48.149 --> 00:34:48.159 align:start position:0%
to get
 
00:34:50.069 --> 00:34:50.079 align:start position:0%
you're going to see it in tax revenues
 
00:34:52.149 --> 00:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
and i believe that's what's happening
 
00:34:54.869 --> 00:34:54.879 align:start position:0%
uh with our business revenues i can't
 
00:34:55.990 --> 00:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
prove anything but
 
00:34:58.950 --> 00:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
i believe there is a phenomenon here and
 
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
at the very least we should note it
 
00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
and it should lead to caution
 
00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
as we make projections going forward
 
00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:10.640 align:start position:0%
and as our successors two years from now
 
00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
try to
 
00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
make make projections off of whatever
 
00:35:21.829 --> 00:35:21.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative some good some
 
00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
good thoughts
 
00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
um representative bromley i
 
00:35:33.109 --> 00:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
again i'm fine with uh all of what's
 
00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:34.720 align:start position:0%
been said uh
 
00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
the other thing we should point out is
 
00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
that the senate agrees with us
 
00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
that in in after after they
 
00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:44.720 align:start position:0%
projected their revenues
 
00:35:47.829 --> 00:35:47.839 align:start position:0%
they they went along with the
 
00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
the concept of of the surplus statement
 
00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:54.640 align:start position:0%
and they took the dras number that they
 
00:35:56.069 --> 00:35:56.079 align:start position:0%
gave the dra gave us
 
00:35:58.150 --> 00:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
so in the surplus statement they're
 
00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:00.760 align:start position:0%
reducing 22 business taxes by
 
00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
25.4 million and in 23 they're basically
 
00:36:05.349 --> 00:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
they're reducing
 
00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:09.200 align:start position:0%
business taxes by 44 million 44 million
 
00:36:11.829 --> 00:36:11.839 align:start position:0%
so we just got to keep that in mind that
 
00:36:11.839 --> 00:36:12.390 align:start position:0%
so we just got to keep that in mind that
that

00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
after we get done projecting 22 and 23
 
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
understand that on the surplus statement
 
00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
we're gonna we're gonna be subtracting
 
00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
some of that revenue the 25.4 and the 44
 
00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:25.430 align:start position:0%
some of that revenue the 25.4 and the 44
point

00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:36:29.109 --> 00:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
uh for the fact that
 
00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh payments there's going to be refunds
 
00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
basically or less quarterly payments
 
00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
going on in those two years because of
 
00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
people already paying the tax but i also
 
00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:42.640 align:start position:0%
appreciate the fact that
 
00:36:45.829 --> 00:36:45.839 align:start position:0%
and i agree with with representative
 
00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
spillsberry and representative ames
 
00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
that there's something here uh that
 
00:36:55.589 --> 00:36:55.599 align:start position:0%
we really should be reducing the base it
 
00:36:57.430 --> 00:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
does seem like a false space to me as
 
00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:58.710 align:start position:0%
does seem like a false space to me as
well

00:36:58.710 --> 00:36:58.720 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
um to then then move forward
 
00:37:05.109 --> 00:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
with our projections based on what we
 
00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
think the
 
00:37:10.069 --> 00:37:10.079 align:start position:0%
real economy is going to be uh so
 
00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
and i think representative major is
 
00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:14.470 align:start position:0%
and i think representative major is
basically

00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:16.640 align:start position:0%
i think you're saying the same thing
 
00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
that while you're saying that the base
 
00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
actually should be more than the plan
 
00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
because of all this other stimulus i
 
00:37:27.109 --> 00:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
mean the pp app alone was 3.7
 
00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
billion yeah so
 
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh so i you know i'm willing to
 
00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
increase my methodology by something
 
00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
uh i don't know what the something is uh
 
00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
to say that the base is probably going
 
00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
to be greater than the
 
00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
the actual may minus 18.3
 
00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
by the way two documents i was using the
 
00:37:58.790 --> 00:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
i've been using 18.3 for the uh based on
 
00:37:58.800 --> 00:37:59.190 align:start position:0%
i've been using 18.3 for the uh based on
the

00:37:59.190 --> 00:37:59.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
uh revenue focus because the actual
 
00:38:03.349 --> 00:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
number is
 
00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:05.990 align:start position:0%
eighteen point two seven two
 
00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:07.589 align:start position:0%
eighteen point two seven two
[Music]

00:38:07.589 --> 00:38:07.599 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
eighteen million two hundred seventy two
 
00:38:11.349 --> 00:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
thousand six hundred twenty three
 
00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
so to me i round up that's eighteen
 
00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
point three uh but on this sheet it's
 
00:38:17.829 --> 00:38:17.839 align:start position:0%
saying eighteen point two for business
 
00:38:17.839 --> 00:38:18.710 align:start position:0%
saying eighteen point two for business
tax

00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
so whatever so it's a point one
 
00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
either way so so i'm saying yeah
 
00:38:30.069 --> 00:38:30.079 align:start position:0%
if we if we wanna the starting point is
 
00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
is my age 59.1
 
00:38:35.109 --> 00:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
now the question on the table is do we
 
00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
want to increase that
 
00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
or what representative major said about
 
00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:42.640 align:start position:0%
all the extra revenue and then we then
 
00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
we go back to uh
 
00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
discussion on 22 and 23. okay
 
00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
let me throw in a starting point for
 
00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:51.430 align:start position:0%
let me throw in a starting point for
that

00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
take the 959.2
 
00:38:59.430 --> 00:38:59.440 align:start position:0%
and the revenues to date on business
 
00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:00.310 align:start position:0%
and the revenues to date on business
taxes

00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
00:39:03.829 --> 00:39:03.839 align:start position:0%
i've been up about 30
 
00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
so let's say that the uh and that's on
 
00:39:07.829 --> 00:39:07.839 align:start position:0%
the average for the whole
 
00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
11 months so let's say that june is
 
00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
going to come up
 
00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:15.200 align:start position:0%
come up higher than was planned by
 
00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
20 but
 
00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
about 25 million dollars
 
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
yeah 25 million to the 959
 
00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
at 984.
 
00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
984 put you in uh
 
00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
probably around a three percent increase
 
00:39:43.589 --> 00:39:43.599 align:start position:0%
at all
 
00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
the senate by the way the senate went
 
00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:13.589 align:start position:0%
the senate by the way the senate went
through

00:40:13.589 --> 00:40:13.599 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
but they didn't have the advantage of
 
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
having the may
 
00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
finals and so
 
00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
that could have been another 25 million
 
00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:26.230 align:start position:0%
that could have been another 25 million
dollars

00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
so um i
 
00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
i would stick i i would
 
00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:35.200 align:start position:0%
have the committee steered towards
 
00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
something that
 
00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
around 20 more for
 
00:40:45.349 --> 00:40:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
seeing that for the whole year
 
00:40:51.589 --> 00:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
the average was 30 percent this would be
 
00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
a conservative if you want to go to 30
 
00:40:59.829 --> 00:40:59.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
let's hear from somebody else uh
 
00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.109 align:start position:0%
let's hear from somebody else uh
representative

00:41:03.109 --> 00:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
jennings thank you mr chairman
 
00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
um i was just wondering and maybe this
 
00:41:11.109 --> 00:41:11.119 align:start position:0%
data is already available
 
00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
but i mean obviously one of the big
 
00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:14.720 align:start position:0%
concerns here is
 
00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
how the base figure may drop based on
 
00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
ppp loan
 
00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
um or based on refunds from
 
00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
from non-taxable ppp loans um
 
00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
is it possible if you're not already
 
00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
doing it to track monthly
 
00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
how much dra is sending back to
 
00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:32.710 align:start position:0%
how much dra is sending back to
businesses

00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:32.720 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
00:41:35.349 --> 00:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
or to taxpayer well businesses based on
 
00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
the ppp
 
00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:40.640 align:start position:0%
loans because that would help us decide
 
00:41:42.309 --> 00:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
how much we might have to lower whatever
 
00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
base we come up with
 
00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
we won't start seeing those numbers of
 
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
any substantial until
 
00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
october or later
 
00:41:55.109 --> 00:41:55.119 align:start position:0%
okay and because most of the
 
00:41:59.270 --> 00:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh ppp loans haven't been approved
 
00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
and then that's why in april
 
00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
we got this log of money because they
 
00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:12.069 align:start position:0%
we got this log of money because they
couldn't

00:42:12.069 --> 00:42:12.079 align:start position:0%
couldn't
 
00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
take the advantage of that they had to
 
00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
pay it
 
00:42:17.109 --> 00:42:17.119 align:start position:0%
knowing that they get it back as a
 
00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
refund and it isn't just
 
00:42:23.589 --> 00:42:23.599 align:start position:0%
the ppp loans that we're talking about
 
00:42:23.599 --> 00:42:24.150 align:start position:0%
the ppp loans that we're talking about
here

00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:42:26.069 --> 00:42:26.079 align:start position:0%
it's the others the main street and all
 
00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
the others the stimulus packages that
 
00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
have added to the revenue that's coming
 
00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:31.990 align:start position:0%
have added to the revenue that's coming
in

00:42:31.990 --> 00:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:42:34.309 --> 00:42:34.319 align:start position:0%
those things are going going to be going
 
00:42:34.319 --> 00:42:36.150 align:start position:0%
those things are going going to be going
away

00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
away
 
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
so what representative spillsbury he
 
00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
said and others
 
00:42:44.309 --> 00:42:44.319 align:start position:0%
and what we need to take
 
00:42:46.309 --> 00:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
all of that into consideration as we go
 
00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
out to 22 and 23.
 
00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
but let's continue on fixing the base
 
00:42:56.309 --> 00:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
for 21. uh reps of major can i just make
 
00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
a comment or
 
00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
response to representatives yeah sorry
 
00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
not going to say it right sorry
 
00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
00:43:07.829 --> 00:43:07.839 align:start position:0%
um so dra at the end of the month does
 
00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
send out a series of reports and one of
 
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
those reports is the refund analysis
 
00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
so you can see on a monthly basis on
 
00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:16.720 align:start position:0%
what's happening with refunds that are
 
00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
being requested and paid out
 
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
in addition there's a report that goes
 
00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
to fiscal committee on a quarterly basis
 
00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
that dra does
 
00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
on the refunds so so there is there is a
 
00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
material out there
 
00:43:30.870 --> 00:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
um available to you to look at what's
 
00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
going on
 
00:43:33.829 --> 00:43:33.839 align:start position:0%
but to the point represent major made
 
00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
00:43:37.589 --> 00:43:37.599 align:start position:0%
uh ppp you will probably won't see any
 
00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
of that until sometime into the fall or
 
00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:47.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
thank you well uh we're
 
00:43:57.430 --> 00:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
trying to deal with that with the future
 
00:43:58.550 --> 00:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
stuff which is
 
00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
quite different at this point and
 
00:44:03.589 --> 00:44:03.599 align:start position:0%
i'm really going to want to get in on
 
00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
that one but when we're looking at
 
00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
what's coming in the door in
 
00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
june to add on to this on
 
00:44:15.349 --> 00:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
i'm willing to go along with the senate
 
00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
number if we have to
 
00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
but on if you
 
00:44:23.349 --> 00:44:23.359 align:start position:0%
uh take the normal performance of june
 
00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
relatives the rest of the year
 
00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:30.640 align:start position:0%
we come up to 990
 
00:44:33.829 --> 00:44:33.839 align:start position:0%
on half of that would be
 
00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
an increase of 45 on
 
00:44:40.069 --> 00:44:40.079 align:start position:0%
the 20 increase in june over
 
00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
plan of 25 is something also i would be
 
00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:46.640 align:start position:0%
willing to accept at this point but
 
00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:47.030 align:start position:0%
willing to accept at this point but
those

00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
that that is the range in there once
 
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.270 align:start position:0%
that that is the range in there once
we've

00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
we've
 
00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
included what may actually brought in
 
00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
part of which we know was supposed to be
 
00:44:57.270 --> 00:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
in april
 
00:44:59.190 --> 00:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
okay does somebody else have a number
 
00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
for fy21
 
00:45:06.309 --> 00:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
that includes all of june revenue
 
00:45:09.349 --> 00:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
norm you you susan's number's 990. your
 
00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
number turns out if it at 20
 
00:45:15.430 --> 00:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
is 985.1
 
00:45:19.109 --> 00:45:19.119 align:start position:0%
so uh both tracking much higher than
 
00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
the the senate 963.2
 
00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:26.550 align:start position:0%
the the senate 963.2
um

00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:28.640 align:start position:0%
uh i just wanted to clarify what those
 
00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
were yeah sorry i was
 
00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
was my arithmetic was off you're right
 
00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
representative major and i are very
 
00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:39.670 align:start position:0%
representative major and i are very
close

00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:43.589 --> 00:45:43.599 align:start position:0%
so so that right we're saying that
 
00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh that okay
 
00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
you got me off my plan number there's
 
00:45:52.390 --> 00:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
good arguments why it would probably be
 
00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
above plan
 
00:45:58.150 --> 00:45:58.160 align:start position:0%
and uh so again at the 20
 
00:46:01.829 --> 00:46:01.839 align:start position:0%
above plan norm for for june that's is
 
00:46:06.309 --> 00:46:06.319 align:start position:0%
it's uh that's uh
 
00:46:10.069 --> 00:46:10.079 align:start position:0%
that's 25.86 million
 
00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
so when you add it to the the
 
00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
to the base that comes out to 9.85
 
00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
the normal plan it comes out to 985.1
 
00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
so i guess that's what's on the table
 
00:46:34.309 --> 00:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
now all right does anybody else have
 
00:46:35.829 --> 00:46:35.839 align:start position:0%
another number
 
00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
other than that for 21.
 
00:46:44.309 --> 00:46:44.319 align:start position:0%
then my suggestion is that we take
 
00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:46.240 align:start position:0%
the difference between nine ninety nine
 
00:46:47.349 --> 00:46:47.359 align:start position:0%
ninety nine
 
00:46:50.710 --> 00:46:50.720 align:start position:0%
eighty five and come in with nine
 
00:46:57.030 --> 00:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
eighty eight
 
00:47:01.510 --> 00:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
of devon i know it's early on
 
00:47:16.150 --> 00:47:16.160 align:start position:0%
and it's hard well his numbers he
 
00:47:18.790 --> 00:47:18.800 align:start position:0%
compares to uh
 
00:47:20.549 --> 00:47:20.559 align:start position:0%
compares to last year but last year was
 
00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
really anomalous
 
00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the year uh
 
00:47:28.549 --> 00:47:28.559 align:start position:0%
but how are revenues is david on
 
00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
devon on how how the revenues look for
 
00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
the first
 
00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
representative rami i can answer that if
 
00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
you'd like
 
00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
um we do have a comparison just of to
 
00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
last year and you are correct last
 
00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
year's anomalies but
 
00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
um business taxes is coming in pretty
 
00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
good so far this year
 
00:47:51.589 --> 00:47:51.599 align:start position:0%
um every just about every day has
 
00:47:51.599 --> 00:47:52.549 align:start position:0%
um every just about every day has
exceeded

00:47:52.549 --> 00:47:52.559 align:start position:0%
exceeded
 
00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
last year at this point for business
 
00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:57.109 align:start position:0%
last year at this point for business
taxes

00:47:57.109 --> 00:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
00:48:00.549 --> 00:48:00.559 align:start position:0%
so yeah if we can have a 20 to 25
 
00:48:03.829 --> 00:48:03.839 align:start position:0%
add-on that sounds reasonable for
 
00:48:05.829 --> 00:48:05.839 align:start position:0%
guesstimate based upon the information
 
00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:08.240 align:start position:0%
we know at this point in time
 
00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
yeah i think it's a little bit higher
 
00:48:12.549 --> 00:48:12.559 align:start position:0%
than what we'd had so if we plug in
 
00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
what came in for may remove our
 
00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
estimates and plug in what we came from
 
00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
may and then keep our june
 
00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
our june methodology the same we get a
 
00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
new range of 960 2.3
 
00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
to 975.8 uh
 
00:48:31.589 --> 00:48:31.599 align:start position:0%
hold on one second you get a 962
 
00:48:35.230 --> 00:48:35.240 align:start position:0%
0.3 to 9
 
00:48:39.589 --> 00:48:39.599 align:start position:0%
75.8 and again that's replacing our may
 
00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
estimate with may actual
 
00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
and keeping our june methodology the
 
00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:47.109 align:start position:0%
and keeping our june methodology the
same

00:48:47.109 --> 00:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
and and what we've done is exceeded that
 
00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:55.589 align:start position:0%
and and what we've done is exceeded that
by

00:48:55.589 --> 00:48:55.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:59.670 --> 00:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
12 12 million dollars okay
 
00:49:02.069 --> 00:49:02.079 align:start position:0%
which is one and a half one third
 
00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:10.720 align:start position:0%
we're down close all right
 
00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh the basis of what
 
00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
melissa said
 
00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:21.710 align:start position:0%
melissa said
the

00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:25.030 align:start position:0%
 
988

00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:30.790 --> 00:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
million should that be changed
 
00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
they would exceed the ra's high of 975.8
 
00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:43.589 --> 00:49:43.599 align:start position:0%
money in the doors as of yesterday
 
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
is that correct melissa
 
00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
that's based on the end of may
 
00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
so what did you take for growth
 
00:50:01.109 --> 00:50:01.119 align:start position:0%
over plan for june
 
00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
sure so um the way we had originally
 
00:50:05.829 --> 00:50:05.839 align:start position:0%
modeled was based on historic
 
00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
performance of may and june
 
00:50:12.069 --> 00:50:12.079 align:start position:0%
but now that we have may uh june was for
 
00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:12.800 align:start position:0%
the low
 
00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
it's two percent ahead of plan and for
 
00:50:17.349 --> 00:50:17.359 align:start position:0%
the high
 
00:50:21.109 --> 00:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
it is 13 of head of plan which is um
 
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
the average historic performance of
 
00:50:25.270 --> 00:50:25.280 align:start position:0%
revenue for may and june so if you think
 
00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
it's going to
 
00:50:30.309 --> 00:50:30.319 align:start position:0%
be above that um above that average
 
00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
then i think your number is fine we we
 
00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:34.640 align:start position:0%
felt comfortable with the average being
 
00:50:35.829 --> 00:50:35.839 align:start position:0%
our high
 
00:50:40.150 --> 00:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
um but 10 to 12 million is not
 
00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
out of almost a billion dollars is not
 
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
off all that much
 
00:50:48.549 --> 00:50:48.559 align:start position:0%
mr chairman yes
 
00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
i think there's a problem with that high
 
00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
methodology now because
 
00:50:57.109 --> 00:50:57.119 align:start position:0%
on part of april ended up being in june
 
00:50:59.270 --> 00:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what the effect which
 
00:51:01.829 --> 00:51:01.839 align:start position:0%
effect that has in which direction
 
00:51:05.109 --> 00:51:05.119 align:start position:0%
yeah and then the 29
 
00:51:09.270 --> 00:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
i i had in closing anomalies
 
00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
so um the average for 11 months
 
00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
is less than that take the anomaly out
 
00:51:20.549 --> 00:51:20.559 align:start position:0%
okay we could drop that down closer to
 
00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
20 percent
 
00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
so maybe the 20 sounds like a reasonable
 
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:31.829 align:start position:0%
so maybe the 20 sounds like a reasonable
number

00:51:31.829 --> 00:51:31.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:35.349 --> 00:51:35.359 align:start position:0%
20 percent is 9.85 right
 
00:51:35.359 --> 00:51:41.349 align:start position:0%
20 percent is 9.85 right
yes

00:51:41.349 --> 00:51:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
representative tudor you have your hand
 
00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
up i was just curious if the dra could
 
00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:46.720 align:start position:0%
tell us
 
00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
um how well june is tracking is june
 
00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:50.710 align:start position:0%
um how well june is tracking is june
tracking

00:51:50.710 --> 00:51:50.720 align:start position:0%
tracking
 
00:51:54.309 --> 00:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
uh way well above their projection
 
00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
through the first 10 days here or can
 
00:51:59.670 --> 00:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:01.750 --> 00:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
they had mentioned it but melissa would
 
00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
you respond to that
 
00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
yeah it's a little um what i did state
 
00:52:07.990 --> 00:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
is that we are tracking ahead of last
 
00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
year we do know last year was a little
 
00:52:09.990 --> 00:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
bit of an
 
00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
anomalous um it is definitely too early
 
00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
to say
 
00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:16.240 align:start position:0%
what it looks like compared to our
 
00:52:18.309 --> 00:52:18.319 align:start position:0%
numbers and that's just because the bulk
 
00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
of the revenue i mean we're
 
00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
we're in the eighth and the bulk of the
 
00:52:22.630 --> 00:52:22.640 align:start position:0%
revenue hasn't come in all i can say is
 
00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
the small amount that has come in
 
00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:26.720 align:start position:0%
has been higher than last year at this
 
00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:27.589 align:start position:0%
has been higher than last year at this
point

00:52:27.589 --> 00:52:27.599 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:52:30.790 --> 00:52:30.800 align:start position:0%
yeah chris would you put up the may
 
00:52:32.309 --> 00:52:32.319 align:start position:0%
revenue focus
 
00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
she shows the plan
 
00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
all right and go to the i think page
 
00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:58.829 align:start position:0%
all right and go to the i think page
four

00:52:58.829 --> 00:52:58.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:58.839 --> 00:53:00.790 align:start position:0%
 
yep

00:53:00.790 --> 00:53:00.800 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:53:02.950 --> 00:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
okay and then just reduce it a little
 
00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
okay notice that on page four the
 
00:53:16.309 --> 00:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
total business taxes came in 29.1
 
00:53:19.589 --> 00:53:19.599 align:start position:0%
more than the
 
00:53:23.109 --> 00:53:23.119 align:start position:0%
11 months of plan but then
 
00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
in that 29.1
 
00:53:30.309 --> 00:53:30.319 align:start position:0%
is the 18.2 million dollars
 
00:53:32.470 --> 00:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
that's the anomaly that should that
 
00:53:33.670 --> 00:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
should be removed
 
00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
to look at the new percentage
 
00:53:51.109 --> 00:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:56.390 --> 00:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
they took the anomaly out
 
00:53:58.230 --> 00:53:58.240 align:start position:0%
we need to take the anomaly out of this
 
00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
percentage and they already did see
 
00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:02.309 align:start position:0%
percentage and they already did see
below

00:54:02.309 --> 00:54:02.319 align:start position:0%
below
 
00:54:04.309 --> 00:54:04.319 align:start position:0%
yeah no but but that they took it as one
 
00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
they took the whole anomaly out to 30.8
 
00:54:08.069 --> 00:54:08.079 align:start position:0%
million out at the bottom
 
00:54:11.829 --> 00:54:11.839 align:start position:0%
you know but they didn't take it out and
 
00:54:15.349 --> 00:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
exactly correct sorry yeah
 
00:54:21.510 --> 00:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
so the anomaly is in the number of 848.1
 
00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:24.640 align:start position:0%
and every one percent is six and a half
 
00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
million so
 
00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
so it would bring this down to about 26
 
00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
all right so it still is 988 million
 
00:54:55.109 --> 00:54:55.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:58.390 --> 00:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:03.190 --> 00:55:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:08.470 --> 00:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
representative romney you don't agree
 
00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
all right i mean
 
00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
i feel more comfortable to 985 but 98
 
00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:22.230 align:start position:0%
i feel more comfortable to 985 but 98
fine

00:55:22.230 --> 00:55:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:25.589 --> 00:55:25.599 align:start position:0%
i'd be fine with the 985 also
 
00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
i will i think yeah that's
 
00:55:32.789 --> 00:55:32.799 align:start position:0%
yeah 95 then okay okay
 
00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:34.640 align:start position:0%
who would not be comfortable with the
 
00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:37.510 align:start position:0%
who would not be comfortable with the
985

00:55:37.510 --> 00:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
985
 
00:55:39.349 --> 00:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
and you're going to lower your hand
 
00:55:40.789 --> 00:55:40.799 align:start position:0%
representative romney
 
00:55:44.309 --> 00:55:44.319 align:start position:0%
oh my hands up sorry
 
00:55:47.589 --> 00:55:47.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
we move forward one slot so the
 
00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
base for fy21 for the house ways and
 
00:56:08.309 --> 00:56:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:18.789 --> 00:56:18.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:18.799 --> 00:56:22.069 align:start position:0%
 
now

00:56:22.069 --> 00:56:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
we have two ways to go we can do fy21
 
00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
all the way down
 
00:56:31.750 --> 00:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
or we can
 
00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:34.880 align:start position:0%
finish the estimates for for the
 
00:56:35.910 --> 00:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
business taxes
 
00:56:39.349 --> 00:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
going across the road to 22 and 23.
 
00:56:46.950 --> 00:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:49.030 --> 00:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
yeah and uh and this is gonna be the
 
00:56:49.990 --> 00:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
most difficult one
 
00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
so it'd be better if we get out of the
 
00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:54.309 align:start position:0%
so it'd be better if we get out of the
way

00:56:54.309 --> 00:56:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:58.309 --> 00:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
good that represent
 
00:57:00.789 --> 00:57:00.799 align:start position:0%
yes my thought is from all the comments
 
00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:02.480 align:start position:0%
i've heard and i've only been here 10
 
00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:02.950 align:start position:0%
i've heard and i've only been here 10
minutes

00:57:02.950 --> 00:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
00:57:06.789 --> 00:57:06.799 align:start position:0%
um i think maybe the estimates
 
00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:08.960 align:start position:0%
would all end up with wider ranges just
 
00:57:10.710 --> 00:57:10.720 align:start position:0%
because of all the unknowns
 
00:57:12.950 --> 00:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
but i'm still wondering in the end if we
 
00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:14.240 align:start position:0%
would end up in the middle
 
00:57:16.069 --> 00:57:16.079 align:start position:0%
near the same place so that's just what
 
00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
i've been thinking i mean there
 
00:57:20.230 --> 00:57:20.240 align:start position:0%
are more unknowns every time we talk um
 
00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
but some of them will boost it up and
 
00:57:23.190 --> 00:57:23.200 align:start position:0%
someone will boost it down
 
00:57:26.150 --> 00:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
so it does sound like the range is wider
 
00:57:28.230 --> 00:57:28.240 align:start position:0%
with all the questions we have right now
 
00:57:30.309 --> 00:57:30.319 align:start position:0%
but will the middle still be the same as
 
00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
my thought for this morning
 
00:57:35.109 --> 00:57:35.119 align:start position:0%
we will find out yeah okay
 
00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
so we're going to run with 985 million
 
00:57:39.670 --> 00:57:39.680 align:start position:0%
for fy21
 
00:57:42.870 --> 00:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
now we go on to fy 22 from the business
 
00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:45.910 align:start position:0%
now we go on to fy 22 from the business
taxes

00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
so that brings us to the norm that
 
00:57:49.910 --> 00:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
brings us to the discussion of
 
00:57:53.030 --> 00:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
now offline do we want to adjust
 
00:57:56.309 --> 00:57:56.319 align:start position:0%
down the base or not not not the base
 
00:57:58.390 --> 00:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
that we're going to show
 
00:58:01.510 --> 00:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to move forward from whether
 
00:58:03.589 --> 00:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
or not that's anomalous as one way of
 
00:58:04.390 --> 00:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
handling the
 
00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:10.549 --> 00:58:10.559 align:start position:0%
that's going to be a hard number to come
 
00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
by but you're right
 
00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
because that's going to start showing up
 
00:58:17.030 --> 00:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
at 522
 
00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
is because what's happening now
 
00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
or has happened during this whole year
 
00:58:28.150 --> 00:58:28.160 align:start position:0%
isn't going to continue to be happening
 
00:58:29.430 --> 00:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
as far as
 
00:58:32.710 --> 00:58:32.720 align:start position:0%
economic support from all the stimuluses
 
00:58:36.789 --> 00:58:36.799 align:start position:0%
or for the economic
 
00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:40.960 align:start position:0%
attack because of this the pandemic
 
00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
is not going to happen
 
00:58:48.789 --> 00:58:48.799 align:start position:0%
we're hoping next year so that
 
00:58:51.270 --> 00:58:51.280 align:start position:0%
we have to make an adjustment to that
 
00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:52.640 align:start position:0%
but the only problem i have
 
00:58:55.270 --> 00:58:55.280 align:start position:0%
norm is i have no idea how to do that
 
00:58:56.230 --> 00:58:56.240 align:start position:0%
nobody does
 
00:58:59.349 --> 00:58:59.359 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean this is
 
00:59:01.829 --> 00:59:01.839 align:start position:0%
it'd be guess work on our part we know
 
00:59:04.950 --> 00:59:04.960 align:start position:0%
we know it's
 
00:59:08.069 --> 00:59:08.079 align:start position:0%
this year is artificially high but
 
00:59:12.069 --> 00:59:12.079 align:start position:0%
um you know by by how much
 
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
uh we don't know and correct me if i'm
 
00:59:16.829 --> 00:59:16.839 align:start position:0%
wrong uh
 
00:59:19.109 --> 00:59:19.119 align:start position:0%
melissa i think i think
 
00:59:22.549 --> 00:59:22.559 align:start position:0%
dra took the position that that these
 
00:59:22.559 --> 00:59:23.910 align:start position:0%
dra took the position that that these
revenues

00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
00:59:27.349 --> 00:59:27.359 align:start position:0%
that we just projected are are actually
 
00:59:28.069 --> 00:59:28.079 align:start position:0%
pretty real
 
00:59:31.109 --> 00:59:31.119 align:start position:0%
if you will and you are in your minds
 
00:59:32.789 --> 00:59:32.799 align:start position:0%
because you you
 
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
you never when you did your you didn't
 
00:59:37.510 --> 00:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
adjust those down at all
 
00:59:39.589 --> 00:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
like help me out i remember you saying
 
00:59:41.829 --> 00:59:41.839 align:start position:0%
something somewhere along the line
 
00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
melissa can i let's answer that question
 
00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:45.510 align:start position:0%
melissa can i let's answer that question
norm

00:59:45.510 --> 00:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
norm
 
00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh melissa you have a response
 
00:59:52.390 --> 00:59:52.400 align:start position:0%
sure um yeah we've we've looked at a lot
 
00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:52.710 align:start position:0%
sure um yeah we've we've looked at a lot
of

00:59:52.710 --> 00:59:52.720 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:59:55.349 --> 00:59:55.359 align:start position:0%
of different items um it's definitely a
 
00:59:56.630 --> 00:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
hard year to predict
 
01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
um but we have
 
01:00:03.589 --> 01:00:03.599 align:start position:0%
taken so far of just doing a growth
 
01:00:07.510 --> 01:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
um between two and six percent we have
 
01:00:09.430 --> 01:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
not adjusted down the base
 
01:00:11.430 --> 01:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
um we don't have we really are data
 
01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
driven and we don't have
 
01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
any data to show
 
01:00:18.150 --> 01:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
that there's anomalous revenue that
 
01:00:19.270 --> 01:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
won't continue
 
01:00:22.470 --> 01:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
into the next couple of years
 
01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:24.160 align:start position:0%
however if you feel differently feel
 
01:00:26.789 --> 01:00:26.799 align:start position:0%
free to adjust them but at this point we
 
01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
have kept our fiscal year 21
 
01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
range the same and then we grew 22 off
 
01:00:34.069 --> 01:00:34.079 align:start position:0%
of that
 
01:00:35.829 --> 01:00:35.839 align:start position:0%
off of that range it did not make any
 
01:00:40.829 --> 01:00:40.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
um before we go
 
01:00:46.950 --> 01:00:46.960 align:start position:0%
forward i want to hear get some
 
01:00:49.990 --> 01:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
additional input uh representative
 
01:00:51.589 --> 01:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
murphy followed by representative
 
01:00:54.390 --> 01:00:54.400 align:start position:0%
spillsbury representative murphy
 
01:00:57.589 --> 01:00:57.599 align:start position:0%
thank you um i guess somewhat of a
 
01:00:59.109 --> 01:00:59.119 align:start position:0%
simple question but maybe
 
01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
a thought about projecting to the future
 
01:01:04.309 --> 01:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
which is i think going to be the most
 
01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
difficult part as we have all talked
 
01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:07.270 align:start position:0%
difficult part as we have all talked
about

01:01:07.270 --> 01:01:07.280 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:01:08.710 --> 01:01:08.720 align:start position:0%
it would seem like you have the bulk of
 
01:01:11.349 --> 01:01:11.359 align:start position:0%
the information already in for 21 and so
 
01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
those numbers
 
01:01:15.430 --> 01:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
would seem to be appropriate and real it
 
01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
would also seem difficult to
 
01:01:22.309 --> 01:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
use that base number as the launch pad
 
01:01:22.319 --> 01:01:23.190 align:start position:0%
use that base number as the launch pad
for

01:01:23.190 --> 01:01:23.200 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:01:26.710 --> 01:01:26.720 align:start position:0%
projecting 22-23 given all
 
01:01:28.870 --> 01:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
the confounding factors that we have
 
01:01:29.910 --> 01:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
01:01:31.910 --> 01:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
some of them are permanent and some of
 
01:01:33.030 --> 01:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
them are going to go away
 
01:01:36.069 --> 01:01:36.079 align:start position:0%
such as the infusion of dollars and the
 
01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
sb 3 and ppp effect so my question is
 
01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
how inappropriate or realistic would it
 
01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:44.470 align:start position:0%
how inappropriate or realistic would it
be

01:01:44.470 --> 01:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
to use 21
 
01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
or 2021 as a asterisk
 
01:01:54.309 --> 01:01:54.319 align:start position:0%
phenomenon and as has been mentioned
 
01:01:54.319 --> 01:01:55.430 align:start position:0%
phenomenon and as has been mentioned
before

01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:01:58.470 --> 01:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
not use the 21 numbers as the base
 
01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
in projecting going forward but actually
 
01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
back up a bit to 19 and 20
 
01:02:05.750 --> 01:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
and then see if you could extrapolate
 
01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
from those numbers what it might look
 
01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:08.630 align:start position:0%
from those numbers what it might look
like

01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:02:11.829 --> 01:02:11.839 align:start position:0%
based on what the known permanent
 
01:02:13.589 --> 01:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
changes may be
 
01:02:16.230 --> 01:02:16.240 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing or credit carry
 
01:02:17.910 --> 01:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
forward that we know about
 
01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
because obviously many of the
 
01:02:21.990 --> 01:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
adjustments and the
 
01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh confounding factors secondary to
 
01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
covid are going to be
 
01:02:27.349 --> 01:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
hopefully temporary in nature so my
 
01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:28.880 align:start position:0%
question would be i guess this would be
 
01:02:29.270 --> 01:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:02:32.470 --> 01:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
you know melissa and chris whoever
 
01:02:36.069 --> 01:02:36.079 align:start position:0%
could you use 19 and 20 as the base in a
 
01:02:36.079 --> 01:02:36.870 align:start position:0%
could you use 19 and 20 as the base in a
sense

01:02:36.870 --> 01:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
sense
 
01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
and project out increased percentages
 
01:02:40.789 --> 01:02:40.799 align:start position:0%
going forward so
 
01:02:43.349 --> 01:02:43.359 align:start position:0%
um i'm just they're just some of those
 
01:02:43.359 --> 01:02:44.950 align:start position:0%
um i'm just they're just some of those
thoughts

01:02:44.950 --> 01:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
thoughts
 
01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
thank you so i guess my response would
 
01:02:49.829 --> 01:02:49.839 align:start position:0%
be um
 
01:02:51.589 --> 01:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
represent major and represent murphy is
 
01:02:53.829 --> 01:02:53.839 align:start position:0%
that you can use whatever methodology
 
01:02:55.510 --> 01:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
that the committee feels is appropriate
 
01:02:57.829 --> 01:02:57.839 align:start position:0%
to come up with a base number that you
 
01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
think is the most correct or the best
 
01:03:01.990 --> 01:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
estimate that the committee can
 
01:03:04.390 --> 01:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
make so if you need to go back and look
 
01:03:06.789 --> 01:03:06.799 align:start position:0%
at 19 and 20 to see what was going on
 
01:03:09.990 --> 01:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
in in those two years that's certainly
 
01:03:13.029 --> 01:03:13.039 align:start position:0%
an option um you know dra has a
 
01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
as melissa indicated they are data
 
01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
driven so they use
 
01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
information that um they can grab out of
 
01:03:21.349 --> 01:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
the system and see what's happened along
 
01:03:22.069 --> 01:03:22.079 align:start position:0%
with some
 
01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
trending that that they also see um
 
01:03:27.430 --> 01:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
so yeah the answer is it's however the
 
01:03:28.789 --> 01:03:28.799 align:start position:0%
committee decides they want to make an
 
01:03:30.069 --> 01:03:30.079 align:start position:0%
estimate you could make an estimate
 
01:03:31.990 --> 01:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
of a flat number as well if you wanted
 
01:03:33.270 --> 01:03:33.280 align:start position:0%
to just say that
 
01:03:37.109 --> 01:03:37.119 align:start position:0%
i'm in 22 we think it's going to be 990
 
01:03:37.119 --> 01:03:37.990 align:start position:0%
i'm in 22 we think it's going to be 990
million

01:03:37.990 --> 01:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:03:39.910 --> 01:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
and just just say that the reason for
 
01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:03:43.430 --> 01:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
based on all the uncertainties and and
 
01:03:44.950 --> 01:03:44.960 align:start position:0%
the pluses and minuses we don't think
 
01:03:45.829 --> 01:03:45.839 align:start position:0%
that there's really
 
01:03:49.109 --> 01:03:49.119 align:start position:0%
a good base to apply to 22 um and we
 
01:03:50.549 --> 01:03:50.559 align:start position:0%
think it's going to fall around this
 
01:03:51.910 --> 01:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
number so so there's a
 
01:03:53.829 --> 01:03:53.839 align:start position:0%
whatever methodology the committee would
 
01:03:55.510 --> 01:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
like or as an individual you would like
 
01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:56.150 align:start position:0%
like or as an individual you would like
to

01:03:56.150 --> 01:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:03:57.589 --> 01:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
come up with a number to debate with the
 
01:03:57.599 --> 01:04:00.230 align:start position:0%
come up with a number to debate with the
committee

01:04:00.230 --> 01:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:03.029 --> 01:04:03.039 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if melissa wants to add
 
01:04:04.789 --> 01:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
or subtract from what i might have said
 
01:04:08.069 --> 01:04:08.079 align:start position:0%
um i'll quiet down
 
01:04:09.589 --> 01:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
yeah nope i think chris said it
 
01:04:12.150 --> 01:04:12.160 align:start position:0%
perfectly um we're just here to give our
 
01:04:13.829 --> 01:04:13.839 align:start position:0%
thoughts and information on it but it
 
01:04:17.109 --> 01:04:17.119 align:start position:0%
is 100 the committee's um estimates that
 
01:04:18.390 --> 01:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
they get to use and how they come up
 
01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:19.109 align:start position:0%
they get to use and how they come up
with

01:04:19.109 --> 01:04:19.119 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:04:20.870 --> 01:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
them is is their choice we're just
 
01:04:22.549 --> 01:04:22.559 align:start position:0%
trying to give as much information as we
 
01:04:24.150 --> 01:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
have and what we think but
 
01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
if you guys feel differently um feel
 
01:04:27.270 --> 01:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
free to choose
 
01:04:28.950 --> 01:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
what you would what you would think
 
01:04:33.109 --> 01:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
okay representative stillsbury yes thank
 
01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman
 
01:04:40.390 --> 01:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
i very much appreciate melissa's
 
01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:42.069 align:start position:0%
i very much appreciate melissa's
explanation

01:04:42.069 --> 01:04:42.079 align:start position:0%
explanation
 
01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
that they are data driven and therefore
 
01:04:46.390 --> 01:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
limited in terms of how to approach this
 
01:04:47.829 --> 01:04:47.839 align:start position:0%
in the way that we would so we have
 
01:04:47.839 --> 01:04:48.950 align:start position:0%
in the way that we would so we have
freedom

01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
freedom
 
01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
uh maybe this goes uh somewhat in the
 
01:04:53.829 --> 01:04:53.839 align:start position:0%
same direction from a different angle is
 
01:04:57.190 --> 01:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
representative murphy i just
 
01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
if you look at the senate's projection
 
01:05:05.109 --> 01:05:05.119 align:start position:0%
they came out for fy 22
 
01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
with a 3.57 increase so
 
01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh a little bit below the middle of
 
01:05:13.109 --> 01:05:13.119 align:start position:0%
dra's two to six
 
01:05:17.029 --> 01:05:17.039 align:start position:0%
percent range if we just blindly applied
 
01:05:17.039 --> 01:05:18.630 align:start position:0%
percent range if we just blindly applied
that

01:05:18.630 --> 01:05:18.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:05:20.789 --> 01:05:20.799 align:start position:0%
which frankly i think is what the senate
 
01:05:22.470 --> 01:05:22.480 align:start position:0%
has done
 
01:05:27.589 --> 01:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
to our new base of 985 for fy21
 
01:05:31.750 --> 01:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
that would lead us to a figure for fy22
 
01:05:34.789 --> 01:05:34.799 align:start position:0%
of 1020.16
 
01:05:37.829 --> 01:05:37.839 align:start position:0%
in other words a billion 20 million
 
01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
and i think that just illustrates that
 
01:05:43.910 --> 01:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
that approach is leading us astray
 
01:05:48.390 --> 01:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
rather than focusing on fy20 on the new
 
01:05:54.069 --> 01:05:54.079 align:start position:0%
figure of 985 for fy21
 
01:05:58.470 --> 01:05:58.480 align:start position:0%
let's go back to our march 18th
 
01:06:03.750 --> 01:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
projection for fy22 which was 847.7
 
01:06:05.270 --> 01:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
and the commonality here with
 
01:06:07.109 --> 01:06:07.119 align:start position:0%
representative murphy's thinking is that
 
01:06:09.990 --> 01:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
our 847.7 was in fact
 
01:06:12.230 --> 01:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
based largely on what had occurred in 19
 
01:06:13.430 --> 01:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
and 20.
 
01:06:17.270 --> 01:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:19.349 --> 01:06:19.359 align:start position:0%
uh as squishy as the information might
 
01:06:19.359 --> 01:06:20.870 align:start position:0%
uh as squishy as the information might
be

01:06:20.870 --> 01:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:06:25.029 --> 01:06:25.039 align:start position:0%
whether there's grounds to raise 847.7
 
01:06:28.069 --> 01:06:28.079 align:start position:0%
how brief are these anomalies
 
01:06:36.950 --> 01:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:40.309 --> 01:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
well can i react to that norm um
 
01:06:42.069 --> 01:06:42.079 align:start position:0%
or is it somebody else stand up for well
 
01:06:51.510 --> 01:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:56.150 --> 01:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:00.109 --> 01:07:00.119 align:start position:0%
yeah as i approach this i see
 
01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
fy22 in a different light than fy23
 
01:07:07.430 --> 01:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
um i think uh in fy
 
01:07:09.589 --> 01:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
22 there'll be federal money still
 
01:07:11.270 --> 01:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
pouring into our
 
01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:14.240 align:start position:0%
our new hampshire economy the harp of
 
01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:15.190 align:start position:0%
our new hampshire economy the harp of
money

01:07:15.190 --> 01:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:07:18.470 --> 01:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
is uh about to be distributed
 
01:07:22.390 --> 01:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
and that's a lot of money um and so
 
01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm optimistic in terms of revenue
 
01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:30.370 align:start position:0%
going forward for the next 12 months
 
01:07:30.370 --> 01:07:32.150 align:start position:0%
going forward for the next 12 months
[Music]

01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
basically because of that subject to the
 
01:07:37.109 --> 01:07:37.119 align:start position:0%
adjustment for
 
01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
refunds that we've talked about the pvp
 
01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:41.510 align:start position:0%
refunds that we've talked about the pvp
refunds

01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
refunds
 
01:07:44.549 --> 01:07:44.559 align:start position:0%
and if i were projecting um
 
01:07:47.829 --> 01:07:47.839 align:start position:0%
i think what i would favor is taking the
 
01:07:50.630 --> 01:07:50.640 align:start position:0%
new number that we've been
 
01:07:52.870 --> 01:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
we're in the process of developing uh
 
01:07:54.630 --> 01:07:54.640 align:start position:0%
well for business taxes taking the new
 
01:07:57.829 --> 01:07:57.839 align:start position:0%
number we've talked about for fy21
 
01:08:02.470 --> 01:08:02.480 align:start position:0%
and taking out of it the expected ppp
 
01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
refund and then growing it
 
01:08:10.789 --> 01:08:10.799 align:start position:0%
perhaps at the same growth rate that
 
01:08:13.910 --> 01:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
the dra i'd use 3.5 7
 
01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:15.870 align:start position:0%
if i have that right um
 
01:08:15.870 --> 01:08:17.430 align:start position:0%
if i have that right um
[Music]

01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:08:20.870 --> 01:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
and um that would give us a number to
 
01:08:24.149 --> 01:08:24.159 align:start position:0%
for fy 22 and maybe i
 
01:08:27.749 --> 01:08:27.759 align:start position:0%
i should stop there i think the idea of
 
01:08:29.590 --> 01:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
01:08:32.229 --> 01:08:32.239 align:start position:0%
identify a base that's appropriate to
 
01:08:32.239 --> 01:08:33.669 align:start position:0%
identify a base that's appropriate to
use

01:08:33.669 --> 01:08:33.679 align:start position:0%
use
 
01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:43.590 --> 01:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
is a really difficult one the idea of
 
01:08:44.709 --> 01:08:44.719 align:start position:0%
looking back
 
01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
in time looking back to where where we
 
01:08:49.269 --> 01:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
were when we were doing this estimating
 
01:08:49.279 --> 01:08:49.669 align:start position:0%
were when we were doing this estimating
work

01:08:49.669 --> 01:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:08:52.950 --> 01:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
earlier this year maybe
 
01:08:56.229 --> 01:08:56.239 align:start position:0%
may be helpful but i would separate the
 
01:08:57.669 --> 01:08:57.679 align:start position:0%
two fiscal years i guess that's my
 
01:08:57.679 --> 01:08:59.510 align:start position:0%
two fiscal years i guess that's my
contribution

01:08:59.510 --> 01:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
contribution
 
01:09:02.709 --> 01:09:02.719 align:start position:0%
and if you do that
 
01:09:05.749 --> 01:09:05.759 align:start position:0%
the ppp effect
 
01:09:09.189 --> 01:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
is 25.4 million and that's why
 
01:09:13.110 --> 01:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
222 and then we reduced our base number
 
01:09:18.630 --> 01:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:20.789 --> 01:09:20.799 align:start position:0%
it's a good reason because that's gonna
 
01:09:21.990 --> 01:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
that's gonna happen
 
01:09:25.189 --> 01:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
to that amount of money anyway
 
01:09:29.189 --> 01:09:29.199 align:start position:0%
uh i had identified representative elmi
 
01:09:32.829 --> 01:09:32.839 align:start position:0%
and then followed by representative
 
01:09:32.839 --> 01:09:34.149 align:start position:0%
and then followed by representative
romney

01:09:34.149 --> 01:09:34.159 align:start position:0%
romney
 
01:09:39.669 --> 01:09:39.679 align:start position:0%
thank you uh the arpa money which is
 
01:09:42.070 --> 01:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
is a huge amount of money coming and the
 
01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:42.709 align:start position:0%
is a huge amount of money coming and the
question

01:09:42.709 --> 01:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:09:46.470 --> 01:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
is where is it actually going to be used
 
01:09:47.110 --> 01:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of
 
01:09:50.229 --> 01:09:50.239 align:start position:0%
it is on
 
01:09:53.510 --> 01:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
up to subdivisions of the state a lot of
 
01:09:55.590 --> 01:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
that is going to be
 
01:09:57.910 --> 01:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
infrastructure kinds of things that
 
01:09:57.920 --> 01:09:58.790 align:start position:0%
infrastructure kinds of things that
could

01:09:58.790 --> 01:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:10:02.070 --> 01:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
but may not permanently help the economy
 
01:10:05.110 --> 01:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
and and make us grow faster
 
01:10:08.950 --> 01:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
on we can't tell yet on
 
01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
and a lot of it may get used
 
01:10:16.149 --> 01:10:16.159 align:start position:0%
for on most of
 
01:10:18.550 --> 01:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
our businesses in the state of new
 
01:10:19.990 --> 01:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire since
 
01:10:21.910 --> 01:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
almost all of our businesses are what
 
01:10:25.990 --> 01:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:29.430 --> 01:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
so it's it's
 
01:10:32.310 --> 01:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
really difficult we can't possibly
 
01:10:34.709 --> 01:10:34.719 align:start position:0%
disentangle what that stimulus
 
01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
is going to leave us with on
 
01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
in 23 as it's reducing but as
 
01:10:44.910 --> 01:10:44.920 align:start position:0%
it's also adding
 
01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in our state for the
 
01:10:49.990 --> 01:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
roads to be better for broadband to be
 
01:10:51.590 --> 01:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
better for that kind of thing
 
01:10:54.070 --> 01:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
if that actually works that would be a
 
01:10:55.910 --> 01:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
stimulus in itself which would be
 
01:10:58.229 --> 01:10:58.239 align:start position:0%
showing up mostly in 23
 
01:11:03.669 --> 01:11:03.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:07.030 --> 01:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
what i wanted i think we should take
 
01:11:10.229 --> 01:11:10.239 align:start position:0%
out the ppp money
 
01:11:13.350 --> 01:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
um and i think that
 
01:11:15.669 --> 01:11:15.679 align:start position:0%
we should also take out something for
 
01:11:17.189 --> 01:11:17.199 align:start position:0%
the single sales factor
 
01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
unless we can get some uh
 
01:11:25.350 --> 01:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
idea from dra about whether they
 
01:11:27.430 --> 01:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
are far enough along that they think
 
01:11:29.590 --> 01:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
they're successful in finding
 
01:11:31.669 --> 01:11:31.679 align:start position:0%
enough money outside the state to
 
01:11:33.510 --> 01:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
replace what we're going to lose inside
 
01:11:36.149 --> 01:11:36.159 align:start position:0%
this state
 
01:11:39.430 --> 01:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
and and i think that
 
01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
that we ought to take off a bit more
 
01:11:44.630 --> 01:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
than the ppp money because people got
 
01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
main street money and a whole bunch of
 
01:11:47.990 --> 01:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
other things that we don't know about
 
01:11:49.510 --> 01:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
because the governor wasn't telling
 
01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:50.070 align:start position:0%
because the governor wasn't telling
people

01:11:50.070 --> 01:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:11:56.149 --> 01:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
okay um representative
 
01:12:06.229 --> 01:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:11.750 --> 01:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
if we take fy21
 
01:12:15.830 --> 01:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
and remove the ppp money
 
01:12:21.990 --> 01:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
you're down to 959.6 million dollars and
 
01:12:22.870 --> 01:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
then if you go
 
01:12:25.990 --> 01:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
to the mid-range
 
01:12:29.270 --> 01:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
what the dra came up with two to six
 
01:12:31.590 --> 01:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
percent and say it's four percent
 
01:12:34.630 --> 01:12:34.640 align:start position:0%
growth at four percent growth on that
 
01:12:38.550 --> 01:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
you would have 998
 
01:12:44.070 --> 01:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:47.790 --> 01:12:47.800 align:start position:0%
which should be it exceeds
 
01:12:50.790 --> 01:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
fy21 but it makes
 
01:12:53.990 --> 01:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
um buy
 
01:12:57.189 --> 01:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
uh 13 million dollars
 
01:13:00.630 --> 01:13:00.640 align:start position:0%
but to me i forgot who
 
01:13:03.189 --> 01:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
recommended that i think norma that puts
 
01:13:05.510 --> 01:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
us right at what the senate is at
 
01:13:09.110 --> 01:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
they're at 997.8
 
01:13:12.149 --> 01:13:12.159 align:start position:0%
it does it does you didn't miracles
 
01:13:12.159 --> 01:13:13.110 align:start position:0%
it does it does you didn't miracles
happen

01:13:13.110 --> 01:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
happen
 
01:13:16.550 --> 01:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
he didn't realize that to me
 
01:13:19.189 --> 01:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
that makes sense i mean i mean you could
 
01:13:19.199 --> 01:13:19.830 align:start position:0%
that makes sense i mean i mean you could
do

01:13:19.830 --> 01:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:13:22.870 --> 01:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
many different things but
 
01:13:25.990 --> 01:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
to grab something
 
01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
that you can understand and we do know
 
01:13:32.630 --> 01:13:32.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to lose that 25 25.4 million
 
01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:33.270 align:start position:0%
we're going to lose that 25 25.4 million
dollars

01:13:33.270 --> 01:13:33.280 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:13:36.630 --> 01:13:36.640 align:start position:0%
maybe even more so we need to remove
 
01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
that from our base
 
01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
and then grow that new base by
 
01:13:43.910 --> 01:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
if you go up by four percent and we'll
 
01:13:48.790 --> 01:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:50.950 --> 01:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
that's my number somebody else want
 
01:13:51.830 --> 01:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
another number
 
01:13:55.510 --> 01:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
and reason why mr chairman could we
 
01:13:59.189 --> 01:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
ask the dra whether they've got any
 
01:14:00.630 --> 01:14:00.640 align:start position:0%
further guidance on
 
01:14:02.550 --> 01:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
what single sales factor is going to do
 
01:14:03.990 --> 01:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
to us
 
01:14:06.630 --> 01:14:06.640 align:start position:0%
because they've they've killed that bill
 
01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:07.270 align:start position:0%
because they've they've killed that bill
again

01:14:07.270 --> 01:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:14:10.149 --> 01:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
and yeah we haven't it's going to happen
 
01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
yeah we haven't gone into the uh
 
01:14:17.430 --> 01:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
changes to current law yeah i would
 
01:14:19.430 --> 01:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
rather stick with the
 
01:14:22.630 --> 01:14:22.640 align:start position:0%
current law and then and then after we
 
01:14:23.110 --> 01:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
get through
 
01:14:26.870 --> 01:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
the current law but it is current law
 
01:14:28.709 --> 01:14:28.719 align:start position:0%
they put it in current law in the last
 
01:14:28.719 --> 01:14:31.910 align:start position:0%
they put it in current law in the last
budget

01:14:31.910 --> 01:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
but i'm just remembering now it's only
 
01:14:36.149 --> 01:14:36.159 align:start position:0%
going to affect us in 23.
 
01:14:41.189 --> 01:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:44.870 --> 01:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:48.709 --> 01:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
and we're doing 22 right now
 
01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
does anybody have a different
 
01:14:55.189 --> 01:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
mythology or a different number
 
01:14:59.189 --> 01:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
for fy22 and let me just repeat that
 
01:15:00.470 --> 01:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
again we take the
 
01:15:03.590 --> 01:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
fy 21 number reduce it by the ppp
 
01:15:08.310 --> 01:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
amount of refunds which is 25.4 million
 
01:15:12.149 --> 01:15:12.159 align:start position:0%
come up with 959 million
 
01:15:15.030 --> 01:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
and then raise that by four percent the
 
01:15:16.630 --> 01:15:16.640 align:start position:0%
middle of the growth range
 
01:15:19.830 --> 01:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
and we come up with 998 million dollars
 
01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:20.790 align:start position:0%
and we come up with 998 million dollars
which

01:15:20.790 --> 01:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:15:25.189 --> 01:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
within 200 000 of the senate number
 
01:15:29.510 --> 01:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:32.550 --> 01:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
are you okay with that number i i
 
01:15:36.630 --> 01:15:36.640 align:start position:0%
i second that number yeah i do too
 
01:15:39.350 --> 01:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
and that's who's not okay with that
 
01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:43.189 align:start position:0%
and that's who's not okay with that
number

01:15:43.189 --> 01:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:45.550 --> 01:15:45.560 align:start position:0%
okay going once twice and three times
 
01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:49.669 align:start position:0%
okay going once twice and three times
998

01:15:49.669 --> 01:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:53.189 --> 01:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
million for fy22
 
01:15:58.310 --> 01:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
now we go to fy23 that's why 23
 
01:16:05.669 --> 01:16:05.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:07.830 --> 01:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
by 23 we also need to take into
 
01:16:12.550 --> 01:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:15.110 --> 01:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
there's going to be 40 an extra 44
 
01:16:16.470 --> 01:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:27.030 --> 01:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
mr chairman is that 44 is that 44 minus
 
01:16:32.830 --> 01:16:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:35.110 align:start position:0%
 
25

01:16:35.110 --> 01:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
25
 
01:16:36.790 --> 01:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
because we took it off of the base
 
01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:40.470 align:start position:0%
because we took it off of the base
before

01:16:40.470 --> 01:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:44.070 --> 01:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
that's in the uh right right right
 
01:16:48.229 --> 01:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
it's it should be 19.
 
01:16:53.189 --> 01:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:56.149 --> 01:16:56.159 align:start position:0%
wait wait wait wait wait wait wait um
 
01:17:00.709 --> 01:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:05.430 --> 01:17:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:07.110 --> 01:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a lot more refunds
 
01:17:09.030 --> 01:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
and uh less
 
01:17:12.870 --> 01:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
quarterly payments than the prior year
 
01:17:16.070 --> 01:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
i mean well i wouldn't subtract the two
 
01:17:19.750 --> 01:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
that 44 million is what it is it is but
 
01:17:21.669 --> 01:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
we already removed
 
01:17:26.630 --> 01:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
the first one from the 25 from the base
 
01:17:27.990 --> 01:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
oh i see what you mean let me think
 
01:17:29.750 --> 01:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
about this yeah
 
01:17:33.590 --> 01:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
so it's the difference between those
 
01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:41.270 align:start position:0%
so it's the difference between those
is

01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
when it comes to small numbers it's
 
01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:44.709 align:start position:0%
when it comes to small numbers it's
tough

01:17:44.709 --> 01:17:44.719 align:start position:0%
tough
 
01:17:50.070 --> 01:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:53.590 --> 01:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
so we would reduce
 
01:17:57.110 --> 01:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
the base we would reduce
 
01:18:04.630 --> 01:18:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
and then put a growth factor on
 
01:18:24.830 --> 01:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:35.189 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:18:35.189 --> 01:18:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:38.830 --> 01:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
um chris help me out would we consider
 
01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:40.149 align:start position:0%
um chris help me out would we consider
that

01:18:40.149 --> 01:18:40.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:18:43.830 --> 01:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:46.470 --> 01:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
so if you look at the screen now you see
 
01:18:48.070 --> 01:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
where the changes the current law
 
01:18:51.270 --> 01:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
are you go down to the fifth row up
 
01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
it's payroll protection program you have
 
01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:54.630 align:start position:0%
it's payroll protection program you have
25

01:18:54.630 --> 01:18:54.640 align:start position:0%
25
 
01:18:56.550 --> 01:18:56.560 align:start position:0%
the house assuming the senate assumed
 
01:18:59.430 --> 01:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
25.4 million dollars and 22 and 44
 
01:19:01.590 --> 01:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
million dollars and 23
 
01:19:05.110 --> 01:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
reduction to your your revenues right
 
01:19:06.950 --> 01:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
so so they're already accounting for
 
01:19:09.350 --> 01:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
that so they developed a base just as
 
01:19:09.990 --> 01:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
you guys did
 
01:19:13.030 --> 01:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
last um back in march
 
01:19:15.270 --> 01:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
and then you go and you make reductions
 
01:19:16.550 --> 01:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
based on
 
01:19:18.470 --> 01:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
changes to law that's being proposed
 
01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
this session
 
01:19:25.030 --> 01:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
okay so they one of the changes that
 
01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:25.750 align:start position:0%
okay so they one of the changes that
they

01:19:25.750 --> 01:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:19:27.910 --> 01:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
the senate had compared to the house is
 
01:19:29.830 --> 01:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
the single sales
 
01:19:32.550 --> 01:19:32.560 align:start position:0%
the house language was included to delay
 
01:19:34.550 --> 01:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
that so there was a positive 20 million
 
01:19:35.669 --> 01:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
dollar gain
 
01:19:37.750 --> 01:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
carried on the surplus statement the
 
01:19:39.910 --> 01:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
senate removed that language
 
01:19:42.870 --> 01:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
um so there's no there's no adjustment
 
01:19:46.310 --> 01:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:50.070 --> 01:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
you can see that right here right and so
 
01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:53.350 align:start position:0%
you can see that right here right and so
okay

01:19:53.350 --> 01:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:56.790 --> 01:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
so that's in their numbers the 20
 
01:20:00.310 --> 01:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:02.310 --> 01:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
yes so so they didn't give them because
 
01:20:03.669 --> 01:20:03.679 align:start position:0%
they removed their
 
01:20:06.149 --> 01:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
the the position of the house which was
 
01:20:08.629 --> 01:20:08.639 align:start position:0%
to delay the single sales
 
01:20:10.550 --> 01:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
they didn't take credit for 20 million
 
01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
dollars they actually
 
01:20:14.550 --> 01:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
lose the 20 million dollars in the final
 
01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:16.310 align:start position:0%
lose the 20 million dollars in the final
number

01:20:16.310 --> 01:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:20:19.750 --> 01:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
so their final number of uh excuse me
 
01:20:24.070 --> 01:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
right here 102 9.6
 
01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:27.199 align:start position:0%
um their final number becomes 2
 
01:20:30.870 --> 01:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
2 8 0 1.6 and 22 after they make all the
 
01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:31.990 align:start position:0%
2 8 0 1.6 and 22 after they make all the
adjustments

01:20:31.990 --> 01:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
adjustments
 
01:20:33.990 --> 01:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
that you see on this page that's on your
 
01:20:35.590 --> 01:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
screen right now right
 
01:20:39.430 --> 01:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
but but their business taxes that they
 
01:20:42.310 --> 01:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
come up with for final for 23
 
01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
1 0 to 9.6
 
01:20:49.350 --> 01:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
takes that into account so
 
01:20:51.510 --> 01:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
similar to how the house did it back in
 
01:20:53.110 --> 01:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
march they made estimates
 
01:20:54.950 --> 01:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
and then growth to those estimates and
 
01:20:56.629 --> 01:20:56.639 align:start position:0%
debated um
 
01:20:58.550 --> 01:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
why they thought the numbers should be
 
01:21:01.270 --> 01:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
what they are to go with current law
 
01:21:02.390 --> 01:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
and that's what you have before you
 
01:21:06.470 --> 01:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
that's the 963 and 21 the 997 and 22
 
01:21:09.990 --> 01:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
and the 10 29 and 23. and then
 
01:21:12.229 --> 01:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
um the senate ways and means considered
 
01:21:13.990 --> 01:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
some of the adjustments
 
01:21:17.030 --> 01:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh to current law
 
01:21:19.270 --> 01:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
that were contained in house bill 2 and
 
01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
that was the
 
01:21:23.830 --> 01:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:26.390 --> 01:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
and so that that nets against the the
 
01:21:27.990 --> 01:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
revenue so if you were to go through
 
01:21:31.270 --> 01:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
and grab all the business related
 
01:21:32.870 --> 01:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
adjustments you would apply that against
 
01:21:34.310 --> 01:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
the base number up above
 
01:21:38.870 --> 01:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:41.669 --> 01:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
but what they're saying is that they're
 
01:21:42.629 --> 01:21:42.639 align:start position:0%
not going to lose
 
01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
any money off of the single sales factor
 
01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
being in place
 
01:21:50.310 --> 01:21:50.320 align:start position:0%
what they're saying is that it's already
 
01:21:51.830 --> 01:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
been considered in the base numbers
 
01:21:56.149 --> 01:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
because that's current law
 
01:21:58.149 --> 01:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
the house position was you were delaying
 
01:21:59.830 --> 01:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
it so you were going to gain 20 million
 
01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:03.270 align:start position:0%
it so you were going to gain 20 million
dollars

01:22:03.270 --> 01:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:06.390 --> 01:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
because we delayed it right but
 
01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
their position is that we're not going
 
01:22:09.590 --> 01:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
to lose anything
 
01:22:13.189 --> 01:22:13.199 align:start position:0%
from the sales factor no that's uh their
 
01:22:14.950 --> 01:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
position is it's already been considered
 
01:22:19.510 --> 01:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:22.629 --> 01:22:22.639 align:start position:0%
it wasn't because it was susan it was
 
01:22:24.070 --> 01:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
our bill
 
01:22:26.950 --> 01:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
our bill we passed our bill in the house
 
01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:27.350 align:start position:0%
our bill we passed our bill in the house
that

01:22:27.350 --> 01:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:22:30.390 --> 01:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
would delay the single sales factor
 
01:22:33.590 --> 01:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
they voted that down by the time we did
 
01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
our estimates
 
01:22:37.990 --> 01:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
we we said we were going to gain 20
 
01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
million dollars because of our bill
 
01:22:44.629 --> 01:22:44.639 align:start position:0%
delaying single sales factor because
 
01:22:44.639 --> 01:22:45.669 align:start position:0%
delaying single sales factor because
yeah

01:22:45.669 --> 01:22:45.679 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:22:50.550 --> 01:22:50.560 align:start position:0%
they did their estimates 20 million
 
01:22:52.149 --> 01:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
so i i understand now what you're saying
 
01:22:56.950 --> 01:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:59.669 --> 01:22:59.679 align:start position:0%
it was there because we thought the
 
01:23:01.350 --> 01:23:01.360 align:start position:0%
senate was going to pass our bill
 
01:23:03.590 --> 01:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
or that was the assumption yep did not
 
01:23:04.870 --> 01:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
pass our bill
 
01:23:08.629 --> 01:23:08.639 align:start position:0%
so it went away and they
 
01:23:11.510 --> 01:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
went away but we still lose money with
 
01:23:12.470 --> 01:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
single sales
 
01:23:16.550 --> 01:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
factor uh and i thought 20 million was a
 
01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:18.790 align:start position:0%
factor uh and i thought 20 million was a
minimum

01:23:18.790 --> 01:23:18.800 align:start position:0%
minimum
 
01:23:22.229 --> 01:23:22.239 align:start position:0%
that we okay they didn't have to
 
01:23:23.750 --> 01:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
consider it because they
 
01:23:26.310 --> 01:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
they considered it when they did their
 
01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:26.790 align:start position:0%
they considered it when they did their
base

01:23:26.790 --> 01:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
base
 
01:23:30.149 --> 01:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
numbers because it was
 
01:23:34.470 --> 01:23:34.480 align:start position:0%
current law for them correct
 
01:23:37.510 --> 01:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
um represents spellsbury
 
01:23:40.550 --> 01:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
followed by representative ames thank
 
01:23:42.870 --> 01:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman so
 
01:23:44.950 --> 01:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
uh understanding what's just been
 
01:23:46.149 --> 01:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
discussed we're
 
01:23:49.110 --> 01:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
groping for the current law figure so
 
01:23:50.550 --> 01:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
the ppp
 
01:23:53.270 --> 01:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
refunds are dealt with separately on
 
01:23:54.629 --> 01:23:54.639 align:start position:0%
those adjustments
 
01:23:57.030 --> 01:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
for change in law but that still brings
 
01:23:58.550 --> 01:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
us back to
 
01:24:01.750 --> 01:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
representative ames point which is that
 
01:24:05.350 --> 01:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
we've got to view f y 22 and f y 23
 
01:24:09.430 --> 01:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
differently from the perspective of how
 
01:24:12.709 --> 01:24:12.719 align:start position:0%
uh how much longer a stimulus
 
01:24:15.270 --> 01:24:15.280 align:start position:0%
particularly with the new flow of arpa
 
01:24:18.709 --> 01:24:18.719 align:start position:0%
is going to be goosing things so
 
01:24:21.669 --> 01:24:21.679 align:start position:0%
do i i think the case has been clearly
 
01:24:22.870 --> 01:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
made that there's still going to be a
 
01:24:26.790 --> 01:24:26.800 align:start position:0%
strong stimulus effect in fy 22
 
01:24:29.270 --> 01:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
unless we believe that that's also true
 
01:24:31.110 --> 01:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
for fy 23
 
01:24:33.750 --> 01:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
we should not just simply escalate again
 
01:24:35.350 --> 01:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
and in this case it looks like the
 
01:24:37.270 --> 01:24:37.280 align:start position:0%
senate is bumped
 
01:24:41.830 --> 01:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
23 over 22 by 3.19
 
01:24:45.750 --> 01:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
so i don't know how to come up with that
 
01:24:47.350 --> 01:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
number but it does seem to me there
 
01:24:49.110 --> 01:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
should be a tapering
 
01:24:52.470 --> 01:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
of the stimulus impact coming towards us
 
01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:56.830 align:start position:0%
of the stimulus impact coming towards us
by

01:24:56.830 --> 01:24:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:56.840 --> 01:25:00.310 align:start position:0%
 
fy23

01:25:00.310 --> 01:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:02.709 --> 01:25:02.719 align:start position:0%
so i think as your committee heard um
 
01:25:02.719 --> 01:25:03.510 align:start position:0%
so i think as your committee heard um
the

01:25:03.510 --> 01:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:25:07.189 --> 01:25:07.199 align:start position:0%
stimulus money is available until 24.
 
01:25:09.110 --> 01:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
federal fiscal year 24 and if it's
 
01:25:10.470 --> 01:25:10.480 align:start position:0%
encumbred the
 
01:25:12.390 --> 01:25:12.400 align:start position:0%
entities may be able to have it for a
 
01:25:13.990 --> 01:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
longer period
 
01:25:16.390 --> 01:25:16.400 align:start position:0%
so i believe the um there was some of
 
01:25:17.590 --> 01:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
that consideration
 
01:25:20.390 --> 01:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
when the senate was looking at their 23
 
01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:21.590 align:start position:0%
when the senate was looking at their 23
figure

01:25:21.590 --> 01:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
figure
 
01:25:23.910 --> 01:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
but um that would be certainly a
 
01:25:25.669 --> 01:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
discussion that um any committee a
 
01:25:25.679 --> 01:25:26.310 align:start position:0%
discussion that um any committee a
conference

01:25:26.310 --> 01:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
conference
 
01:25:29.189 --> 01:25:29.199 align:start position:0%
or or with the chairs of the two ways
 
01:25:32.709 --> 01:25:32.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:35.990 --> 01:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:38.950 --> 01:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
yeah um i agree with much of what's just
 
01:25:40.470 --> 01:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
been said
 
01:25:43.590 --> 01:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
but before we
 
01:25:46.870 --> 01:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
before we jump into
 
01:25:48.590 --> 01:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
what the growth factor should be for
 
01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:50.310 align:start position:0%
what the growth factor should be for
fy23

01:25:50.310 --> 01:25:50.320 align:start position:0%
fy23
 
01:25:52.390 --> 01:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
i think we need to wrap up what we're
 
01:25:54.870 --> 01:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
growing from and
 
01:25:58.629 --> 01:25:58.639 align:start position:0%
i think we we agree that the new base
 
01:26:01.350 --> 01:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
that we set for fy23 is the starting
 
01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:02.070 align:start position:0%
that we set for fy23 is the starting
point

01:26:02.070 --> 01:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:26:05.669 --> 01:26:05.679 align:start position:0%
that we need to take out of it the ppp
 
01:26:05.679 --> 01:26:07.750 align:start position:0%
that we need to take out of it the ppp
money

01:26:07.750 --> 01:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:26:09.189 --> 01:26:09.199 align:start position:0%
and then the question raised by
 
01:26:11.350 --> 01:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
representative omni is is still on the
 
01:26:12.870 --> 01:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
table because
 
01:26:16.470 --> 01:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
do we think that
 
01:26:19.910 --> 01:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
the going to the single sales factor
 
01:26:25.189 --> 01:26:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:28.950 --> 01:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
loss or revenue loss effect
 
01:26:32.229 --> 01:26:32.239 align:start position:0%
and if we do that's
 
01:26:33.669 --> 01:26:33.679 align:start position:0%
current law we're dealing with current
 
01:26:36.310 --> 01:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
law here that's all
 
01:26:39.430 --> 01:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
then should we take that out
 
01:26:41.830 --> 01:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
so we get the base that we want to use
 
01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:43.669 align:start position:0%
so we get the base that we want to use
for

01:26:43.669 --> 01:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:26:46.149 --> 01:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
applying the growth factor that we need
 
01:26:46.159 --> 01:26:47.590 align:start position:0%
applying the growth factor that we need
to

01:26:47.590 --> 01:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:26:50.310 --> 01:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
identify which i think consistent with
 
01:26:53.110 --> 01:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
what representative spillsbury just said
 
01:26:56.350 --> 01:26:56.360 align:start position:0%
has to be lower than
 
01:26:59.270 --> 01:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
fy22 but i'm
 
01:27:01.830 --> 01:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
really in the dark as to how much lower
 
01:27:02.550 --> 01:27:02.560 align:start position:0%
much of what
 
01:27:05.189 --> 01:27:05.199 align:start position:0%
representative alame said is absolutely
 
01:27:05.199 --> 01:27:07.350 align:start position:0%
representative alame said is absolutely
true

01:27:07.350 --> 01:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
true
 
01:27:09.669 --> 01:27:09.679 align:start position:0%
there may be essence maybe a different
 
01:27:10.470 --> 01:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
01:27:12.709 --> 01:27:12.719 align:start position:0%
flow of that money into the economy that
 
01:27:14.070 --> 01:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
may be
 
01:27:16.950 --> 01:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
showing its impact a little later
 
01:27:19.270 --> 01:27:19.280 align:start position:0%
there's that aspect
 
01:27:22.310 --> 01:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
and we really don't know that we also i
 
01:27:24.149 --> 01:27:24.159 align:start position:0%
think have to be informed by what
 
01:27:26.550 --> 01:27:26.560 align:start position:0%
chris jay said about arpa money it
 
01:27:27.350 --> 01:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be
 
01:27:31.590 --> 01:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
spent until what is that four years out
 
01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:32.629 align:start position:0%
spent until what is that four years out
um

01:27:32.629 --> 01:27:32.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:35.590 --> 01:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
and uh so so it's a really hard nut to
 
01:27:37.030 --> 01:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
crack on the growth factor
 
01:27:39.110 --> 01:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
the lifestyle is lower than three point
 
01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:40.149 align:start position:0%
the lifestyle is lower than three point
whatever

01:27:40.149 --> 01:27:40.159 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
01:27:43.510 --> 01:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh that we were using in 22.
 
01:27:47.110 --> 01:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
so so the first thing to me anyway is is
 
01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
putting behind us the question of um
 
01:27:55.990 --> 01:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:00.310 --> 01:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
the opera money that's committed
 
01:28:03.910 --> 01:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
by december of 24
 
01:28:10.870 --> 01:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:18.390 --> 01:28:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:21.910 --> 01:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
and push their money out on this
 
01:28:26.950 --> 01:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
when the senate came up with a 1.029
 
01:28:32.310 --> 01:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:34.950 --> 01:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't i would have felt that they
 
01:28:39.910 --> 01:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:42.870 --> 01:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
it wasn't explicitly discussed they went
 
01:28:44.790 --> 01:28:44.800 align:start position:0%
with their current law
 
01:28:46.950 --> 01:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
estimates and i think the assumption was
 
01:28:48.870 --> 01:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
that um when they were looking at the
 
01:28:51.110 --> 01:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
base numbers that were
 
01:28:54.550 --> 01:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
provided that that was weaved into it
 
01:28:57.750 --> 01:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
but they did have a a robust discussion
 
01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:04.709 --> 01:29:04.719 align:start position:0%
therefore chris they they assume that
 
01:29:06.470 --> 01:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
there's no impact either way
 
01:29:09.990 --> 01:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
going to single sales factor probably
 
01:29:12.870 --> 01:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
i think that's probably their position
 
01:29:15.110 --> 01:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
this is revenue neutral to them
 
01:29:18.709 --> 01:29:18.719 align:start position:0%
and and i can't uh suggest your
 
01:29:20.390 --> 01:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
position their position to you i don't
 
01:29:21.990 --> 01:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
know i mean i it would be all
 
01:29:24.070 --> 01:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
speculative on my part
 
01:29:26.390 --> 01:29:26.400 align:start position:0%
i'm speculating uh that since they
 
01:29:28.629 --> 01:29:28.639 align:start position:0%
really haven't discussed it
 
01:29:30.470 --> 01:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
they went through their methodology as
 
01:29:32.390 --> 01:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
they normally would
 
01:29:35.430 --> 01:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
uh assuming that there's no impact
 
01:29:38.550 --> 01:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
on us on the revenues
 
01:29:41.430 --> 01:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
because it's a single sales factor our
 
01:29:43.110 --> 01:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
position is that we still suspect that
 
01:29:45.270 --> 01:29:45.280 align:start position:0%
there's going to be some downward
 
01:29:48.550 --> 01:29:48.560 align:start position:0%
revenue um but that's something we
 
01:29:51.510 --> 01:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
need to discuss if we still want to hold
 
01:29:53.110 --> 01:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
on to that
 
01:29:56.390 --> 01:29:56.400 align:start position:0%
our position on that and we but we can't
 
01:29:57.430 --> 01:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
show that in the
 
01:29:59.590 --> 01:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
in the uh surplus statement anymore
 
01:30:00.629 --> 01:30:00.639 align:start position:0%
because it is now
 
01:30:04.149 --> 01:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
current law that we're projecting
 
01:30:07.430 --> 01:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh which includes includes
 
01:30:10.229 --> 01:30:10.239 align:start position:0%
single sass factor so we we would have
 
01:30:12.390 --> 01:30:12.400 align:start position:0%
to adjust the base somewhere or
 
01:30:15.030 --> 01:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
or our percentages or something we
 
01:30:16.629 --> 01:30:16.639 align:start position:0%
reflect that
 
01:30:20.070 --> 01:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
at 20 million dollars if you will so
 
01:30:23.350 --> 01:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:26.390 --> 01:30:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:31.189 --> 01:30:31.199 align:start position:0%
try something we came up with 998
 
01:30:35.750 --> 01:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
million dollars at 522
 
01:30:39.110 --> 01:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
we know we're going to have to
 
01:30:42.149 --> 01:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
reduce the base by
 
01:30:46.870 --> 01:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
44 million dollars because of tpp
 
01:30:50.950 --> 01:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
by 23. but in there is already the 24
 
01:30:53.030 --> 01:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
point something
 
01:30:55.510 --> 01:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
so i would say that we would have to
 
01:31:00.870 --> 01:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
reduce the 998 by 18.6 million dollars
 
01:31:07.189 --> 01:31:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:11.590 --> 01:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
what would be 979.4
 
01:31:14.390 --> 01:31:14.400 align:start position:0%
and if you use four percent it would end
 
01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:14.629 align:start position:0%
and if you use four percent it would end
up

01:31:14.629 --> 01:31:14.639 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:31:17.830 --> 01:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
being one billion eighteen million
 
01:31:21.350 --> 01:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
point six dollars six thousand dollars
 
01:31:24.950 --> 01:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
what 1.018.6
 
01:31:30.149 --> 01:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
billion dollars which would be
 
01:31:32.870 --> 01:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
about 11 million dollars less than what
 
01:31:33.669 --> 01:31:33.679 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
01:31:33.679 --> 01:31:37.750 align:start position:0%
the senate
has

01:31:37.750 --> 01:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:42.550 --> 01:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:46.709 --> 01:31:46.719 align:start position:0%
we in our committee agreed
 
01:31:49.910 --> 01:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
that on first
 
01:31:52.310 --> 01:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
it depends how much we're going to lose
 
01:31:53.910 --> 01:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
depends entirely
 
01:31:57.590 --> 01:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
on how much of our huge
 
01:31:59.990 --> 01:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
businesses the ones that pay most of our
 
01:32:01.750 --> 01:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
business profit stacks
 
01:32:04.870 --> 01:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
are on manufacturers
 
01:32:07.350 --> 01:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
the manufacturers are going to stop
 
01:32:10.830 --> 01:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:14.390 --> 01:32:14.400 align:start position:0%
on it was set at 20 million bank
 
01:32:16.790 --> 01:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
when we thought we were going to get a
 
01:32:18.870 --> 01:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
lot less money
 
01:32:22.229 --> 01:32:22.239 align:start position:0%
in general uh
 
01:32:25.270 --> 01:32:25.280 align:start position:0%
if we don't take out at least something
 
01:32:30.229 --> 01:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
for the loss through single sales factor
 
01:32:32.709 --> 01:32:32.719 align:start position:0%
then then we're agreeing with the senate
 
01:32:34.070 --> 01:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
that it's revenue neutral
 
01:32:37.990 --> 01:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
and maybe you want to do that
 
01:32:43.669 --> 01:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:46.310 --> 01:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
fortunately we have no idea what the
 
01:32:48.390 --> 01:32:48.400 align:start position:0%
total loss is going to be
 
01:32:52.229 --> 01:32:52.239 align:start position:0%
but we settled on 20 million dollars
 
01:32:56.310 --> 01:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
we could do more and probably
 
01:32:58.790 --> 01:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
the possibility of being less isn't that
 
01:32:58.800 --> 01:33:01.030 align:start position:0%
the possibility of being less isn't that
great

01:33:01.030 --> 01:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
great
 
01:33:04.310 --> 01:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
so at this point
 
01:33:11.590 --> 01:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:15.110 --> 01:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
let's go back we still have a starting
 
01:33:19.430 --> 01:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
point of 998 million dollars
 
01:33:23.430 --> 01:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
we need to adjust for the ppp
 
01:33:28.270 --> 01:33:28.280 align:start position:0%
and that would be 18.6 that brings us to
 
01:33:28.280 --> 01:33:31.910 align:start position:0%
and that would be 18.6 that brings us to
979.4

01:33:31.910 --> 01:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:36.550 --> 01:33:36.560 align:start position:0%
if we say the growth rate in 23 from
 
01:33:40.310 --> 01:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
22's four percent that's the number i
 
01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
came up with 1.018
 
01:33:46.310 --> 01:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
that's leaving now with the 20 million
 
01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:47.270 align:start position:0%
that's leaving now with the 20 million
dollars

01:33:47.270 --> 01:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:33:50.790 --> 01:33:50.800 align:start position:0%
off of that then we would be nine
 
01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:58.790 align:start position:0%
off of that then we would be nine
ninety

01:33:58.790 --> 01:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:02.310 --> 01:34:02.320 align:start position:0%
okay a ninety eight wait a minute yeah
 
01:34:06.550 --> 01:34:06.560 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at back at 9.98 right
 
01:34:11.110 --> 01:34:11.120 align:start position:0%
979 0.4
 
01:34:14.709 --> 01:34:14.719 align:start position:0%
uh that's after backing out to 18.6
 
01:34:19.910 --> 01:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
yep then times 1.04
 
01:34:23.189 --> 01:34:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:26.390 --> 01:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
that's yeah 1018 uh
 
01:34:29.910 --> 01:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
right so still still under right well
 
01:34:30.830 --> 01:34:30.840 align:start position:0%
well under the
 
01:34:33.669 --> 01:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
senate and if we took 20 million dollars
 
01:34:36.510 --> 01:34:36.520 align:start position:0%
off that we end up with 9.98
 
01:34:39.350 --> 01:34:39.360 align:start position:0%
998.6 call it yes
 
01:34:41.830 --> 01:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
and we aren't growing the 20 million by
 
01:34:42.709 --> 01:34:42.719 align:start position:0%
two years of
 
01:34:48.149 --> 01:34:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:51.189 --> 01:34:51.199 align:start position:0%
uh representative spellsbury yes thank
 
01:34:53.350 --> 01:34:53.360 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman i'm not sure exactly
 
01:34:55.750 --> 01:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
where you ended there but
 
01:34:59.750 --> 01:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
when we've taken out the incremental uh
 
01:35:04.470 --> 01:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
ppp and got to 979.4
 
01:35:08.310 --> 01:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
um or whether we adjust that back to 998
 
01:35:08.790 --> 01:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
01:35:10.470 --> 01:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
i would refrain from going higher
 
01:35:12.390 --> 01:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
personally i just think that we should
 
01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:12.950 align:start position:0%
personally i just think that we should
resolve

01:35:12.950 --> 01:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
resolve
 
01:35:16.070 --> 01:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
uncertainty conservatively and maybe
 
01:35:19.350 --> 01:35:19.360 align:start position:0%
level it well
 
01:35:21.350 --> 01:35:21.360 align:start position:0%
taking out the 20 million dollars does
 
01:35:23.189 --> 01:35:23.199 align:start position:0%
that yeah
 
01:35:25.669 --> 01:35:25.679 align:start position:0%
but i i'm saying 998 rather than a
 
01:35:28.709 --> 01:35:28.719 align:start position:0%
million 29 or something in between
 
01:35:31.750 --> 01:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:35.109 --> 01:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
the we need to account for
 
01:35:39.669 --> 01:35:39.679 align:start position:0%
the single sales factor it's how much
 
01:35:43.109 --> 01:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
and i think i think the conservative
 
01:35:46.629 --> 01:35:46.639 align:start position:0%
point is 20 million dollars
 
01:35:49.510 --> 01:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
and that would show there'd be no growth
 
01:35:51.430 --> 01:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
from one year to the other but that's
 
01:35:53.830 --> 01:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
there's a reason for that because we're
 
01:35:55.350 --> 01:35:55.360 align:start position:0%
giving out a lot of
 
01:35:59.510 --> 01:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
refunds and then number two
 
01:36:01.910 --> 01:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
going to the single sales factor a lot
 
01:36:03.270 --> 01:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
of people not paying the business
 
01:36:07.669 --> 01:36:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:09.350 --> 01:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
i wonder what the number would be if we
 
01:36:11.830 --> 01:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
went to three percent growth
 
01:36:29.030 --> 01:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:34.070 --> 01:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
is uh 1.08.8
 
01:36:38.550 --> 01:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
1 billion
 
01:36:41.669 --> 01:36:41.679 align:start position:0%
that's before the 20 million that's
 
01:36:42.470 --> 01:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
before the
 
01:36:45.590 --> 01:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
20 million and then take the 20 million
 
01:36:50.830 --> 01:36:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:50.840 --> 01:37:00.870 align:start position:0%
 
980

01:37:00.870 --> 01:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:03.510 --> 01:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
well i'm i'm i'm more comfortable going
 
01:37:04.830 --> 01:37:04.840 align:start position:0%
in that direction
 
01:37:07.830 --> 01:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
than at the four percent growth rate for
 
01:37:08.790 --> 01:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
the reasons i
 
01:37:13.189 --> 01:37:13.199 align:start position:0%
said before um it could be between three
 
01:37:15.189 --> 01:37:15.199 align:start position:0%
and four i'd like to see at a lower
 
01:37:16.229 --> 01:37:16.239 align:start position:0%
growth rate than
 
01:37:19.990 --> 01:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh fy22 so that came
 
01:37:20.970 --> 01:37:20.980 align:start position:0%
out to be nine
 
01:37:20.980 --> 01:37:23.669 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
01:37:27.430 --> 01:37:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:29.189 --> 01:37:29.199 align:start position:0%
can we just split the difference norm
 
01:37:30.950 --> 01:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
can we split the difference oh
 
01:37:32.629 --> 01:37:32.639 align:start position:0%
hold on a minute because we still have a
 
01:37:35.189 --> 01:37:35.199 align:start position:0%
couple of hands okay representing the
 
01:37:35.199 --> 01:37:36.870 align:start position:0%
couple of hands okay representing the
model

01:37:36.870 --> 01:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
model
 
01:37:40.709 --> 01:37:40.719 align:start position:0%
thank you a very basic question but i
 
01:37:42.709 --> 01:37:42.719 align:start position:0%
i don't understand why we're not taking
 
01:37:44.709 --> 01:37:44.719 align:start position:0%
the whole 44
 
01:37:48.709 --> 01:37:48.719 align:start position:0%
million out for ppp in year 2023 can
 
01:37:53.189 --> 01:37:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:57.990 --> 01:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
well when you take the 18.6
 
01:38:02.629 --> 01:38:02.639 align:start position:0%
in the 25.4 it adds up to 44.
 
01:38:05.189 --> 01:38:05.199 align:start position:0%
i understand that it just seems like
 
01:38:05.199 --> 01:38:05.669 align:start position:0%
i understand that it just seems like
it's

01:38:05.669 --> 01:38:05.679 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:38:07.270 --> 01:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
what's been estimated that we're going
 
01:38:09.590 --> 01:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
to be giving back each year
 
01:38:12.550 --> 01:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
and it's not a cumulative thing so it
 
01:38:13.750 --> 01:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
seems like
 
01:38:17.950 --> 01:38:17.960 align:start position:0%
not not each year the
 
01:38:21.189 --> 01:38:21.199 align:start position:0%
24 point 25.4
 
01:38:25.109 --> 01:38:25.119 align:start position:0%
is for 22 then it goes to 44.
 
01:38:27.750 --> 01:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
then the next year i believe it goes to
 
01:38:29.669 --> 01:38:29.679 align:start position:0%
a smaller number and then it tapers to
 
01:38:31.270 --> 01:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
almost nothing
 
01:38:34.470 --> 01:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
right of
 
01:38:37.109 --> 01:38:37.119 align:start position:0%
revenue that we're returning to
 
01:38:37.119 --> 01:38:38.149 align:start position:0%
revenue that we're returning to
businesses

01:38:38.149 --> 01:38:38.159 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
01:38:41.990 --> 01:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
each year you want to answer that
 
01:38:45.030 --> 01:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
cumulative i'm sorry yeah
 
01:38:47.590 --> 01:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
so i i believe uh repsome grammar is
 
01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:48.870 align:start position:0%
so i i believe uh repsome grammar is
correct

01:38:48.870 --> 01:38:48.880 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:38:50.709 --> 01:38:50.719 align:start position:0%
the information that you had was that it
 
01:38:52.950 --> 01:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
was going to be a 25.4 million dollar
 
01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:53.350 align:start position:0%
was going to be a 25.4 million dollar
hit

01:38:53.350 --> 01:38:53.360 align:start position:0%
hit
 
01:38:57.430 --> 01:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
in 22 right and then in 23 it was 44 and
 
01:39:00.310 --> 01:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
then it tapered down to 19.2
 
01:39:04.709 --> 01:39:04.719 align:start position:0%
4.1 and down to 1.7 by 2028 for a total
 
01:39:04.719 --> 01:39:05.510 align:start position:0%
4.1 and down to 1.7 by 2028 for a total
impact

01:39:05.510 --> 01:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
impact
 
01:39:09.109 --> 01:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
of 99.4 million dollars
 
01:39:12.229 --> 01:39:12.239 align:start position:0%
so we should be taking the whole 44
 
01:39:15.109 --> 01:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
i believe that would be um the correct
 
01:39:18.070 --> 01:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
way to do it unless melissa
 
01:39:19.590 --> 01:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
jumps in and tells me i'm giving you
 
01:39:21.270 --> 01:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
incorrect information
 
01:39:24.390 --> 01:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
25 in the base
 
01:39:26.950 --> 01:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
melissa would you uh comment on it
 
01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:28.390 align:start position:0%
melissa would you uh comment on it
please

01:39:28.390 --> 01:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
please
 
01:39:30.629 --> 01:39:30.639 align:start position:0%
sure and i'll also have carolyn jump in
 
01:39:31.990 --> 01:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
if i misspeak because she's
 
01:39:33.990 --> 01:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
a little bit of an expert on this part
 
01:39:36.629 --> 01:39:36.639 align:start position:0%
um i believe because you took the 25 out
 
01:39:37.830 --> 01:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
of the base
 
01:39:39.750 --> 01:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
it's the difference between the 25 and
 
01:39:44.229 --> 01:39:44.239 align:start position:0%
the 44. the 44 is compared to 21.
 
01:39:47.910 --> 01:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
so um if you would have just
 
01:39:50.950 --> 01:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
done the four percent growth and then
 
01:39:53.109 --> 01:39:53.119 align:start position:0%
took in the 20 taking the 25 out after
 
01:39:55.030 --> 01:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
like it is on the surplus statement
 
01:39:57.510 --> 01:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
then it would be the 44 but because you
 
01:39:59.189 --> 01:39:59.199 align:start position:0%
took the 25.4
 
01:40:02.390 --> 01:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
out of the 22 base before you grew 23
 
01:40:03.830 --> 01:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
you're already accounting for part of
 
01:40:06.790 --> 01:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
that so you just do the 18.6
 
01:40:09.030 --> 01:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
got it that makes sense i get it thank
 
01:40:11.109 --> 01:40:11.119 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
01:40:12.709 --> 01:40:12.719 align:start position:0%
thank you melissa you're welcome thank
 
01:40:15.990 --> 01:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:18.229 --> 01:40:18.239 align:start position:0%
hey we've got all the important people
 
01:40:18.239 --> 01:40:20.149 align:start position:0%
hey we've got all the important people
here

01:40:20.149 --> 01:40:20.159 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:40:25.189 --> 01:40:25.199 align:start position:0%
uh okay so then
 
01:40:27.910 --> 01:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
if we take i think representative
 
01:40:30.149 --> 01:40:30.159 align:start position:0%
spillsbury has his hand up yeah
 
01:40:31.990 --> 01:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
okay i'm sorry representative
 
01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:33.270 align:start position:0%
okay i'm sorry representative
spillsbourne

01:40:33.270 --> 01:40:33.280 align:start position:0%
spillsbourne
 
01:40:37.030 --> 01:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh if i do i'm sorry i didn't lower it
 
01:40:46.149 --> 01:40:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:49.030 --> 01:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
and remove the 18.6 because we already
 
01:40:51.430 --> 01:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
had removed 25.4
 
01:40:54.550 --> 01:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
we got 979.4
 
01:40:59.229 --> 01:40:59.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:02.149 --> 01:41:02.159 align:start position:0%
1.018 and if we grow it
 
01:41:06.470 --> 01:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
at 3 percent and remove the 20 million
 
01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:07.430 align:start position:0%
at 3 percent and remove the 20 million
dollars

01:41:07.430 --> 01:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:41:18.550 --> 01:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
we'll end up with 988.7 million dollars
 
01:41:21.430 --> 01:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
how does the committee feel with that i
 
01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:21.990 align:start position:0%
how does the committee feel with that i
think

01:41:21.990 --> 01:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
i'd like to split the difference between
 
01:41:28.870 --> 01:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
your original 998.6 and the 988.7
 
01:41:31.510 --> 01:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to point out that if we
 
01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:32.070 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to point out that if we
take

01:41:32.070 --> 01:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
take
 
01:41:35.990 --> 01:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
the 20 million out at the end it has
 
01:41:38.709 --> 01:41:38.719 align:start position:0%
the 20 million has grown as those
 
01:41:39.990 --> 01:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
companies have
 
01:41:44.830 --> 01:41:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:48.950 --> 01:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
so representative romney
 
01:41:52.550 --> 01:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
recommending that we
 
01:41:58.830 --> 01:41:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:01.910 --> 01:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
3.7 yep 993.7
 
01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:05.750 align:start position:0%
3.7 yep 993.7
yep

01:42:05.750 --> 01:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:08.229 --> 01:42:08.239 align:start position:0%
representative major representative
 
01:42:08.239 --> 01:42:09.669 align:start position:0%
representative major representative
representative

01:42:09.669 --> 01:42:09.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:42:11.189 --> 01:42:11.199 align:start position:0%
i have a question for representative
 
01:42:13.669 --> 01:42:13.679 align:start position:0%
abrami yes sir
 
01:42:17.109 --> 01:42:17.119 align:start position:0%
uh what will be the effect
 
01:42:19.430 --> 01:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
if inflation continues to grow on the
 
01:42:20.950 --> 01:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
three to four percent
 
01:42:22.629 --> 01:42:22.639 align:start position:0%
uh outlook that we're thinking these
 
01:42:24.790 --> 01:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
businesses are going to uh
 
01:42:30.950 --> 01:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:34.070 --> 01:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
well i i if it's inflation it means the
 
01:42:35.350 --> 01:42:35.360 align:start position:0%
prices are going up i
 
01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:38.870 align:start position:0%
prices are going up i
i

01:42:38.870 --> 01:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:43.830 --> 01:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
i i haven't answered that question
 
01:42:46.390 --> 01:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
we are faced with potential of inflation
 
01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:48.870 align:start position:0%
we are faced with potential of inflation
here

01:42:48.870 --> 01:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:52.229 --> 01:42:52.239 align:start position:0%
um basically the old adage of too many
 
01:42:53.510 --> 01:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
dollars chasing too
 
01:42:57.350 --> 01:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
few goods with the much revenue into the
 
01:42:59.109 --> 01:42:59.119 align:start position:0%
system right now
 
01:43:00.950 --> 01:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
is is putting pressure on inflation
 
01:43:03.270 --> 01:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
there's no question
 
01:43:05.270 --> 01:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
i don't know the answer to your question
 
01:43:06.709 --> 01:43:06.719 align:start position:0%
though uh
 
01:43:10.149 --> 01:43:10.159 align:start position:0%
a follow-up question uh mr chairman to
 
01:43:10.159 --> 01:43:10.870 align:start position:0%
a follow-up question uh mr chairman to
uh

01:43:10.870 --> 01:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:43:15.030 --> 01:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
the dra uh melissa
 
01:43:17.910 --> 01:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative schamberg here has
 
01:43:18.390 --> 01:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
there been
 
01:43:20.390 --> 01:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
any data that you've been able to gather
 
01:43:21.910 --> 01:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
in comparison
 
01:43:24.310 --> 01:43:24.320 align:start position:0%
uh with single sales factor to what
 
01:43:24.320 --> 01:43:25.430 align:start position:0%
uh with single sales factor to what
we're

01:43:25.430 --> 01:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
we're
 
01:43:30.470 --> 01:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:32.070 --> 01:43:32.080 align:start position:0%
i'm actually gonna pass that off to
 
01:43:33.669 --> 01:43:33.679 align:start position:0%
carolyn she's the ah
 
01:43:38.629 --> 01:43:38.639 align:start position:0%
okay all right factor expert
 
01:43:40.790 --> 01:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
warning representatives carolyn lear
 
01:43:42.470 --> 01:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner at the department
 
01:43:43.669 --> 01:43:43.679 align:start position:0%
of revenue
 
01:43:47.910 --> 01:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
um so just to back up a step or two
 
01:43:51.189 --> 01:43:51.199 align:start position:0%
um to remind this country the reason why
 
01:43:52.550 --> 01:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
we're unable to
 
01:43:55.750 --> 01:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
estimate the impact of single sales
 
01:43:55.760 --> 01:43:56.390 align:start position:0%
estimate the impact of single sales
factor

01:43:56.390 --> 01:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
factor
 
01:43:59.669 --> 01:43:59.679 align:start position:0%
at the moment is because of the recent
 
01:44:02.950 --> 01:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
implementation of market-based sourcing
 
01:44:06.229 --> 01:44:06.239 align:start position:0%
which will result in really changing
 
01:44:10.550 --> 01:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
who our taxpayers are in some instances
 
01:44:13.669 --> 01:44:13.679 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing was effective on
 
01:44:18.390 --> 01:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
1 121. um
 
01:44:21.510 --> 01:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm sorry 1120 i'm sorry um
 
01:44:23.910 --> 01:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
and those returns would have been filed
 
01:44:25.669 --> 01:44:25.679 align:start position:0%
for the first time
 
01:44:29.350 --> 01:44:29.360 align:start position:0%
this spring um but as you know
 
01:44:32.629 --> 01:44:32.639 align:start position:0%
given the pandemic the delayed due date
 
01:44:35.910 --> 01:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
um and the just huge number of taxpayers
 
01:44:37.189 --> 01:44:37.199 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
01:44:40.629 --> 01:44:40.639 align:start position:0%
filing on extension um
 
01:44:43.910 --> 01:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
those return we just don't have that
 
01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:44.709 align:start position:0%
those return we just don't have that
return

01:44:44.709 --> 01:44:44.719 align:start position:0%
return
 
01:44:47.750 --> 01:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
data yet that we would need to sort of
 
01:44:50.070 --> 01:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
take a look at our new taxpayer base and
 
01:44:50.790 --> 01:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
then make an
 
01:44:55.510 --> 01:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:57.430 --> 01:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
additionally of course you know our
 
01:44:59.350 --> 01:44:59.360 align:start position:0%
largest taxpayers
 
01:45:02.629 --> 01:45:02.639 align:start position:0%
are fiscal year taxpayers and
 
01:45:06.390 --> 01:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
their returns are even more delayed
 
01:45:10.149 --> 01:45:10.159 align:start position:0%
and so we really won't have um
 
01:45:13.910 --> 01:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
a sufficient number of returns
 
01:45:17.109 --> 01:45:17.119 align:start position:0%
for probably at least six maybe 12
 
01:45:20.149 --> 01:45:20.159 align:start position:0%
months to really come up with a good
 
01:45:22.070 --> 01:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
number for you folks on single sales
 
01:45:22.080 --> 01:45:23.830 align:start position:0%
number for you folks on single sales
factor

01:45:23.830 --> 01:45:23.840 align:start position:0%
factor
 
01:45:28.830 --> 01:45:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:33.430 --> 01:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
when believe it was 1120 but now i am
 
01:45:35.510 --> 01:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
second guessing myself single sales
 
01:45:37.070 --> 01:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
factor is 1
 
01:45:40.870 --> 01:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
122. january
 
01:45:43.910 --> 01:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
um yes but the the market-based sourcing
 
01:45:45.830 --> 01:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
change which is really the
 
01:45:49.350 --> 01:45:49.360 align:start position:0%
sort of root of why we don't have great
 
01:45:51.510 --> 01:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
data for you on single sales factor i
 
01:45:52.470 --> 01:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
believe was 1
 
01:45:56.950 --> 01:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:59.030 --> 01:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
so we just don't have those returns in
 
01:46:01.669 --> 01:46:01.679 align:start position:0%
any meaningful number yet to tell you
 
01:46:03.669 --> 01:46:03.679 align:start position:0%
to then run the single sales factor
 
01:46:06.550 --> 01:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
analysis on those new taxpayers
 
01:46:10.470 --> 01:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
to come up with an accurate analysis
 
01:46:13.910 --> 01:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
so do you know enough to uh give us an
 
01:46:13.920 --> 01:46:14.629 align:start position:0%
so do you know enough to uh give us an
idea

01:46:14.629 --> 01:46:14.639 align:start position:0%
idea
 
01:46:18.790 --> 01:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
of where the vector would be heading
 
01:46:20.950 --> 01:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
i i think that's a tough question i have
 
01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:21.910 align:start position:0%
i i think that's a tough question i have
up

01:46:21.910 --> 01:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:46:25.109 --> 01:46:25.119 align:start position:0%
our most recent analysis which
 
01:46:27.990 --> 01:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
um i believe you've all seen which gives
 
01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:28.310 align:start position:0%
um i believe you've all seen which gives
you

01:46:28.310 --> 01:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:46:31.270 --> 01:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
sort of a picture of what it would have
 
01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:31.750 align:start position:0%
sort of a picture of what it would have
been

01:46:31.750 --> 01:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:46:35.510 --> 01:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
in tax years 2014 through 2018
 
01:46:38.790 --> 01:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
um in two of those years single sales
 
01:46:38.800 --> 01:46:39.350 align:start position:0%
um in two of those years single sales
factor

01:46:39.350 --> 01:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
factor
 
01:46:42.390 --> 01:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
actually results in more revenue
 
01:46:45.030 --> 01:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
but in three years it results in
 
01:46:47.590 --> 01:46:47.600 align:start position:0%
substantially less revenue
 
01:46:50.709 --> 01:46:50.719 align:start position:0%
um so if you're looking at the average
 
01:46:53.430 --> 01:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
you're probably looking at a reduction
 
01:46:54.390 --> 01:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
in revenue
 
01:46:57.750 --> 01:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
um attributable to single sales factor
 
01:47:01.669 --> 01:47:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:03.590 --> 01:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
the effective date of single sales
 
01:47:06.229 --> 01:47:06.239 align:start position:0%
factor um
 
01:47:10.870 --> 01:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
is 1122 um so you would start to see
 
01:47:14.310 --> 01:47:14.320 align:start position:0%
that um that impact
 
01:47:17.590 --> 01:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
in estimate payments being filed in the
 
01:47:17.600 --> 01:47:18.870 align:start position:0%
in estimate payments being filed in the
spring

01:47:18.870 --> 01:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
spring
 
01:47:22.470 --> 01:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
of 22.
 
01:47:26.149 --> 01:47:26.159 align:start position:0%
mr chairman could i just ask carolyn
 
01:47:29.510 --> 01:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
another question go ahead representative
 
01:47:32.629 --> 01:47:32.639 align:start position:0%
yes uh for market-based sourcing you
 
01:47:33.990 --> 01:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
were having to go
 
01:47:36.310 --> 01:47:36.320 align:start position:0%
and find the businesses outside the
 
01:47:38.070 --> 01:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
state that
 
01:47:39.750 --> 01:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
now under market-based sourcing is
 
01:47:41.590 --> 01:47:41.600 align:start position:0%
supposed to be paying us money that
 
01:47:44.790 --> 01:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
weren't paying us money before do you
 
01:47:46.790 --> 01:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
have any idea whether
 
01:47:50.550 --> 01:47:50.560 align:start position:0%
on your finding enough of them
 
01:47:53.030 --> 01:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
to make up the money on that change
 
01:47:54.950 --> 01:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
which might give us some idea of whether
 
01:47:56.070 --> 01:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
we could
 
01:47:59.430 --> 01:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
could find the money from outside to
 
01:48:01.750 --> 01:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
make up the money on the single sales
 
01:48:03.990 --> 01:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
factor change
 
01:48:08.070 --> 01:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
far too early currently to have been
 
01:48:11.109 --> 01:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
to be conducting audit activities on
 
01:48:12.629 --> 01:48:12.639 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing
 
01:48:15.030 --> 01:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
we really have to wait to see if
 
01:48:17.510 --> 01:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
taxpayers voluntarily file
 
01:48:19.350 --> 01:48:19.360 align:start position:0%
and then we won't start looking for them
 
01:48:22.229 --> 01:48:22.239 align:start position:0%
until they don't voluntarily file
 
01:48:26.149 --> 01:48:26.159 align:start position:0%
okay at this point in time
 
01:48:29.109 --> 01:48:29.119 align:start position:0%
because of the information that was
 
01:48:30.470 --> 01:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
conveyed to us
 
01:48:32.790 --> 01:48:32.800 align:start position:0%
we're not sure how much it's going to
 
01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:33.590 align:start position:0%
we're not sure how much it's going to
impact

01:48:33.590 --> 01:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
impact
 
01:48:37.510 --> 01:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
us we do know that it's going to impact
 
01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:37.830 align:start position:0%
us we do know that it's going to impact
us

01:48:37.830 --> 01:48:37.840 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:48:41.830 --> 01:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
negatively and that we're start up
 
01:48:50.550 --> 01:48:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:53.189 --> 01:48:53.199 align:start position:0%
and we have used 20 million dollars as a
 
01:48:54.390 --> 01:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
negative impact
 
01:48:57.590 --> 01:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
i don't see how we could come up with
 
01:49:01.109 --> 01:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
a number any better than that
 
01:49:03.109 --> 01:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
because we're really taking something
 
01:49:04.870 --> 01:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
out of the air
 
01:49:09.590 --> 01:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:12.629 --> 01:49:12.639 align:start position:0%
i i would go along with the 20 million
 
01:49:17.030 --> 01:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:20.390 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:49:20.390 --> 01:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:23.589 --> 01:49:23.599 align:start position:0%
representative tucker has her hand up uh
 
01:49:24.629 --> 01:49:24.639 align:start position:0%
yes i want to
 
01:49:28.550 --> 01:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
comment on the
 
01:49:31.350 --> 01:49:31.360 align:start position:0%
topic of inflation everything i've been
 
01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:32.229 align:start position:0%
topic of inflation everything i've been
reading

01:49:32.229 --> 01:49:32.239 align:start position:0%
reading
 
01:49:34.790 --> 01:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
agrees that there is an inflationary
 
01:49:36.470 --> 01:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
trend at the moment
 
01:49:40.070 --> 01:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
but many experts believe it will
 
01:49:43.589 --> 01:49:43.599 align:start position:0%
subside by the end of the year i think
 
01:49:43.599 --> 01:49:44.229 align:start position:0%
subside by the end of the year i think
that

01:49:44.229 --> 01:49:44.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:49:46.790 --> 01:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
the topic of inflation has become a very
 
01:49:48.390 --> 01:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
partisan one
 
01:49:51.030 --> 01:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
and probably better something for us to
 
01:49:52.310 --> 01:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
avoid getting
 
01:49:56.390 --> 01:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
involved in right on these estimates
 
01:50:03.830 --> 01:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:07.589 --> 01:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
i remind everybo uh carolyn
 
01:50:10.629 --> 01:50:10.639 align:start position:0%
the market-based sourcing really only
 
01:50:10.639 --> 01:50:11.270 align:start position:0%
the market-based sourcing really only
impacts

01:50:11.270 --> 01:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
impacts
 
01:50:14.550 --> 01:50:14.560 align:start position:0%
service companies correct
 
01:50:16.709 --> 01:50:16.719 align:start position:0%
and it's so it's not the full population
 
01:50:18.629 --> 01:50:18.639 align:start position:0%
of all companies that it's going to
 
01:50:18.639 --> 01:50:19.109 align:start position:0%
of all companies that it's going to
impact

01:50:19.109 --> 01:50:19.119 align:start position:0%
impact
 
01:50:22.149 --> 01:50:22.159 align:start position:0%
but someone who provides a service
 
01:50:25.669 --> 01:50:25.679 align:start position:0%
to and it depends on where the service
 
01:50:28.709 --> 01:50:28.719 align:start position:0%
is being provided from
 
01:50:30.870 --> 01:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
current law was like let's use the ala
 
01:50:32.390 --> 01:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
physio example
 
01:50:35.750 --> 01:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
i was brokering stuff to maine
 
01:50:38.229 --> 01:50:38.239 align:start position:0%
he was paying our tax he was paying the
 
01:50:40.390 --> 01:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire tax
 
01:50:43.830 --> 01:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:46.390 --> 01:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
but then maine put a market-based source
 
01:50:48.070 --> 01:50:48.080 align:start position:0%
again that made him pay the tax
 
01:50:50.550 --> 01:50:50.560 align:start position:0%
twice he had to pay the tax domain as
 
01:50:50.560 --> 01:50:51.350 align:start position:0%
twice he had to pay the tax domain as
well

01:50:51.350 --> 01:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:50:53.990 --> 01:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
so we changed that so now with
 
01:50:55.990 --> 01:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing
 
01:51:00.070 --> 01:51:00.080 align:start position:0%
uh it it's aldo tizio no longer pays the
 
01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:01.270 align:start position:0%
uh it it's aldo tizio no longer pays the
tax

01:51:01.270 --> 01:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
tax
 
01:51:03.109 --> 01:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
but the person that he's providing the
 
01:51:05.189 --> 01:51:05.199 align:start position:0%
service to
 
01:51:08.629 --> 01:51:08.639 align:start position:0%
will be taxed in that state
 
01:51:11.270 --> 01:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh so the receiver of the service is
 
01:51:13.189 --> 01:51:13.199 align:start position:0%
going to pay the tax not the provider of
 
01:51:14.629 --> 01:51:14.639 align:start position:0%
the service
 
01:51:18.310 --> 01:51:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:20.149 --> 01:51:20.159 align:start position:0%
representative you're correct that
 
01:51:21.990 --> 01:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing only
 
01:51:25.830 --> 01:51:25.840 align:start position:0%
impacts um the sale of
 
01:51:29.430 --> 01:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
services of intangibles um and
 
01:51:32.550 --> 01:51:32.560 align:start position:0%
i would just modify your last statement
 
01:51:34.629 --> 01:51:34.639 align:start position:0%
a bit
 
01:51:37.189 --> 01:51:37.199 align:start position:0%
it doesn't impact who pays the tax it
 
01:51:37.199 --> 01:51:37.669 align:start position:0%
it doesn't impact who pays the tax it
just

01:51:37.669 --> 01:51:37.679 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:51:41.030 --> 01:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
impacts where the tax is paid so in the
 
01:51:41.040 --> 01:51:41.669 align:start position:0%
impacts where the tax is paid so in the
main

01:51:41.669 --> 01:51:41.679 align:start position:0%
main
 
01:51:44.870 --> 01:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire example previously new
 
01:51:46.070 --> 01:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire would have
 
01:51:49.750 --> 01:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
taxed a service provider in new
 
01:51:51.589 --> 01:51:51.599 align:start position:0%
hampshire if they were located in new
 
01:51:51.599 --> 01:51:52.709 align:start position:0%
hampshire if they were located in new
hampshire

01:51:52.709 --> 01:51:52.719 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:51:54.310 --> 01:51:54.320 align:start position:0%
that's a bit of an oversimplification
 
01:51:56.149 --> 01:51:56.159 align:start position:0%
but for our purposes works
 
01:52:00.229 --> 01:52:00.239 align:start position:0%
and now we wouldn't tax that revenue
 
01:52:01.830 --> 01:52:01.840 align:start position:0%
because we would instead look to the
 
01:52:03.510 --> 01:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
location of
 
01:52:06.229 --> 01:52:06.239 align:start position:0%
the provider's customer um which in our
 
01:52:07.589 --> 01:52:07.599 align:start position:0%
example was maine
 
01:52:09.189 --> 01:52:09.199 align:start position:0%
and that's then that's susan uh
 
01:52:11.350 --> 01:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
represent almi's thing is that
 
01:52:14.070 --> 01:52:14.080 align:start position:0%
that's still at issue is that we have to
 
01:52:16.390 --> 01:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
find these companies
 
01:52:19.350 --> 01:52:19.360 align:start position:0%
that are receiving the service to be
 
01:52:20.149 --> 01:52:20.159 align:start position:0%
able to
 
01:52:24.790 --> 01:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
send them a tax bill exactly okay
 
01:52:27.669 --> 01:52:27.679 align:start position:0%
we know that we have a lot to learn
 
01:52:27.679 --> 01:52:28.709 align:start position:0%
we know that we have a lot to learn
about

01:52:28.709 --> 01:52:28.719 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:52:31.189 --> 01:52:31.199 align:start position:0%
market-based source and single sales
 
01:52:31.199 --> 01:52:32.470 align:start position:0%
market-based source and single sales
factor

01:52:32.470 --> 01:52:32.480 align:start position:0%
factor
 
01:52:34.149 --> 01:52:34.159 align:start position:0%
what effect it's going to have on our
 
01:52:37.350 --> 01:52:37.360 align:start position:0%
revenue we don't have enough information
 
01:52:39.589 --> 01:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
yet to know exactly what's going to
 
01:52:39.599 --> 01:52:41.030 align:start position:0%
yet to know exactly what's going to
happen

01:52:41.030 --> 01:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
happen
 
01:52:44.229 --> 01:52:44.239 align:start position:0%
our discussion is
 
01:52:47.030 --> 01:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
do we use the 20 million dollars or do
 
01:52:47.589 --> 01:52:47.599 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:52:52.950 --> 01:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:56.310 --> 01:52:56.320 align:start position:0%
i'm getting there and so
 
01:52:58.229 --> 01:52:58.239 align:start position:0%
that's where we are at this point in
 
01:53:01.270 --> 01:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
time representatives
 
01:53:04.470 --> 01:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
yeah um thank you i i
 
01:53:06.149 --> 01:53:06.159 align:start position:0%
i would take the 20 million dollars i
 
01:53:07.830 --> 01:53:07.840 align:start position:0%
think it's the best we got
 
01:53:10.870 --> 01:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
where they deduct um i think
 
01:53:13.669 --> 01:53:13.679 align:start position:0%
we were at a point in the discussion
 
01:53:14.870 --> 01:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
before we
 
01:53:18.070 --> 01:53:18.080 align:start position:0%
dove into a single sales factor
 
01:53:20.149 --> 01:53:20.159 align:start position:0%
where we had two numbers two possible
 
01:53:20.159 --> 01:53:21.750 align:start position:0%
where we had two numbers two possible
numbers

01:53:21.750 --> 01:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
01:53:25.109 --> 01:53:25.119 align:start position:0%
in front of us and one was
 
01:53:29.189 --> 01:53:29.199 align:start position:0%
a four percent growth factor uh on a
 
01:53:32.950 --> 01:53:32.960 align:start position:0%
base that excluded the ppp money
 
01:53:35.750 --> 01:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
and then after getting a number we
 
01:53:35.760 --> 01:53:37.109 align:start position:0%
and then after getting a number we
subtracted

01:53:37.109 --> 01:53:37.119 align:start position:0%
subtracted
 
01:53:39.669 --> 01:53:39.679 align:start position:0%
20 million that's what i remember and
 
01:53:39.679 --> 01:53:40.310 align:start position:0%
20 million that's what i remember and
then

01:53:40.310 --> 01:53:40.320 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:53:43.430 --> 01:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
okay there was a suggestion that we
 
01:53:47.030 --> 01:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
um go halfway
 
01:53:48.390 --> 01:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
to something i don't remember what the
 
01:53:50.149 --> 01:53:50.159 align:start position:0%
something was
 
01:53:53.589 --> 01:53:53.599 align:start position:0%
it was 993.7 million dollars and that's
 
01:53:53.599 --> 01:53:54.149 align:start position:0%
it was 993.7 million dollars and that's
using

01:53:54.149 --> 01:53:54.159 align:start position:0%
using
 
01:53:57.270 --> 01:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
a three percent growth factor okay to
 
01:53:58.149 --> 01:53:58.159 align:start position:0%
that one
 
01:54:01.589 --> 01:54:01.599 align:start position:0%
um and uh what i'd like to
 
01:54:06.229 --> 01:54:06.239 align:start position:0%
know if our math gurus can tell us is uh
 
01:54:09.510 --> 01:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
going to that midpoint
 
01:54:13.430 --> 01:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
implies what growth factor um
 
01:54:14.950 --> 01:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
you know it's not four percent it's not
 
01:54:17.910 --> 01:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
three percent it's somewhere in between
 
01:54:23.589 --> 01:54:23.599 align:start position:0%
isn't it halfway in between 3.5
 
01:54:28.669 --> 01:54:28.679 align:start position:0%
right so it should be 1.35
 
01:54:28.679 --> 01:54:32.229 align:start position:0%
right so it should be 1.35
1.035

01:54:32.229 --> 01:54:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:35.189 --> 01:54:35.199 align:start position:0%
can i jump up on my norm can i jump in
 
01:54:35.199 --> 01:54:36.149 align:start position:0%
can i jump up on my norm can i jump in
please

01:54:36.149 --> 01:54:36.159 align:start position:0%
please
 
01:54:39.189 --> 01:54:39.199 align:start position:0%
uh yes yeah i think he misspoke it's uh
 
01:54:43.669 --> 01:54:43.679 align:start position:0%
your original uh number was 998.6
 
01:54:47.910 --> 01:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
yes representative ames number was 988.7
 
01:54:49.430 --> 01:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
at the 3
 
01:54:54.229 --> 01:54:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:56.149 --> 01:54:56.159 align:start position:0%
so i would assume that would be three
 
01:54:57.270 --> 01:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
and a half percent
 
01:55:01.109 --> 01:55:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:03.990 --> 01:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh does anybody have a different number
 
01:55:04.870 --> 01:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
are we
 
01:55:11.830 --> 01:55:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:14.870 --> 01:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
with the explanation that we use the
 
01:55:14.880 --> 01:55:16.310 align:start position:0%
with the explanation that we use the
base

01:55:16.310 --> 01:55:16.320 align:start position:0%
base
 
01:55:21.589 --> 01:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
of 2022 reduced it by 18.6 million
 
01:55:21.599 --> 01:55:22.310 align:start position:0%
of 2022 reduced it by 18.6 million
dollars

01:55:22.310 --> 01:55:22.320 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:55:28.870 --> 01:55:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:32.070 --> 01:55:32.080 align:start position:0%
three and three and a half percent and
 
01:55:36.070 --> 01:55:36.080 align:start position:0%
remove 20 million dollars because of
 
01:55:39.430 --> 01:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
the same the sales factor is going
 
01:55:43.270 --> 01:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
is continuing going to continuous
 
01:55:47.430 --> 01:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
current law
 
01:55:51.750 --> 01:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:56.629 --> 01:55:56.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:01.669 --> 01:56:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:04.709 --> 01:56:04.719 align:start position:0%
it just puts me beyond where i think
 
01:56:07.030 --> 01:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
this moderate range should be um it
 
01:56:08.550 --> 01:56:08.560 align:start position:0%
really does but
 
01:56:12.310 --> 01:56:12.320 align:start position:0%
i'll support the uh to me
 
01:56:20.870 --> 01:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:24.390 --> 01:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
all right now chris you have the numbers
 
01:56:27.589 --> 01:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
all right 985 for 21
 
01:56:36.070 --> 01:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:40.149 --> 01:56:40.159 align:start position:0%
okay and your numbers for 22 and 23
 
01:56:43.510 --> 01:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
already account for the ppp say that
 
01:56:43.520 --> 01:56:44.070 align:start position:0%
already account for the ppp say that
again

01:56:44.070 --> 01:56:44.080 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:56:46.790 --> 01:56:46.800 align:start position:0%
your numbers for 22 and 23 already
 
01:56:47.830 --> 01:56:47.840 align:start position:0%
account for the
 
01:56:52.790 --> 01:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:55.589 --> 01:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
and 20 so does that put us above the
 
01:56:55.599 --> 01:56:56.790 align:start position:0%
and 20 so does that put us above the
senate

01:56:56.790 --> 01:56:56.800 align:start position:0%
senate
 
01:56:58.870 --> 01:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
so the senate base number doesn't back
 
01:57:01.189 --> 01:57:01.199 align:start position:0%
out the 25 point
 
01:57:03.350 --> 01:57:03.360 align:start position:0%
two million dollars or the forty four
 
01:57:05.910 --> 01:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
point zero million dollars
 
01:57:07.750 --> 01:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
so yes i believe it puts you higher than
 
01:57:09.109 --> 01:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
01:57:12.310 --> 01:57:12.320 align:start position:0%
but now all we have to do is is
 
01:57:18.149 --> 01:57:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:25.270 --> 01:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
but yep
 
01:57:27.589 --> 01:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
which let's let's just take a quick look
 
01:57:28.390 --> 01:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
at uh
 
01:57:33.510 --> 01:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:43.990 --> 01:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:45.750 --> 01:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
so you've you've accounted for the
 
01:57:47.510 --> 01:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
payroll protection program
 
01:57:50.550 --> 01:57:50.560 align:start position:0%
yeah the senate
 
01:57:53.189 --> 01:57:53.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't do that until after so that they
 
01:57:55.750 --> 01:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
have a negative adjustment of 25.4 and
 
01:57:55.760 --> 01:57:57.109 align:start position:0%
have a negative adjustment of 25.4 and
22

01:57:57.109 --> 01:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
22
 
01:57:59.350 --> 01:57:59.360 align:start position:0%
and a negative adjustment of 44 million
 
01:58:01.030 --> 01:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
dollars and 23
 
01:58:04.830 --> 01:58:04.840 align:start position:0%
from their base number well we didn't
 
01:58:09.189 --> 01:58:09.199 align:start position:0%
have an adjustment
 
01:58:13.109 --> 01:58:13.119 align:start position:0%
when we did it in march correct
 
01:58:16.629 --> 01:58:16.639 align:start position:0%
right so we picked up
 
01:58:18.629 --> 01:58:18.639 align:start position:0%
and the senate used the numbers that we
 
01:58:20.950 --> 01:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
worked with with the dra and we're using
 
01:58:23.189 --> 01:58:23.199 align:start position:0%
it now
 
01:58:26.310 --> 01:58:26.320 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:58:31.030 --> 01:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh the sweat reduction
 
01:58:34.390 --> 01:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
is the same the uh historic
 
01:58:37.669 --> 01:58:37.679 align:start position:0%
racing is the same yep and we took care
 
01:58:40.709 --> 01:58:40.719 align:start position:0%
of single sales factor
 
01:58:43.669 --> 01:58:43.679 align:start position:0%
uh everything else is the same going to
 
01:58:44.229 --> 01:58:44.239 align:start position:0%
the top
 
01:58:48.390 --> 01:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
except for the additional dra auditor
 
01:58:51.430 --> 01:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
right the the uh
 
01:58:53.430 --> 01:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
senate finance committee did not add the
 
01:58:55.030 --> 01:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
two positions that the house finance
 
01:58:55.040 --> 01:58:55.750 align:start position:0%
two positions that the house finance
committee

01:58:55.750 --> 01:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:58:58.390 --> 01:58:58.400 align:start position:0%
had recommended which then would impact
 
01:58:59.910 --> 01:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
the three million dollars in revenue
 
01:58:59.920 --> 01:59:00.390 align:start position:0%
the three million dollars in revenue
that

01:59:00.390 --> 01:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:59:04.709 --> 01:59:04.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:08.310 --> 01:59:08.320 align:start position:0%
mr chairman representative tudor
 
01:59:09.910 --> 01:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
should shouldn't the 20 million come out
 
01:59:13.510 --> 01:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
of the single sales factor on this sheet
 
01:59:17.350 --> 01:59:17.360 align:start position:0%
well it's going to come out
 
01:59:21.109 --> 01:59:21.119 align:start position:0%
no because it's in current law right
 
01:59:29.270 --> 01:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:31.750 --> 01:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
yeah we have to foreign 20 million out
 
01:59:33.270 --> 01:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
based on the fact that we
 
01:59:34.709 --> 01:59:34.719 align:start position:0%
we thought the senate was going to pass
 
01:59:36.709 --> 01:59:36.719 align:start position:0%
what we our bill they did not pass our
 
01:59:36.719 --> 01:59:37.510 align:start position:0%
what we our bill they did not pass our
bill

01:59:37.510 --> 01:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:59:39.750 --> 01:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
yeah that doesn't matter when we take
 
01:59:40.870 --> 01:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
that 20 million
 
01:59:47.669 --> 01:59:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:51.350 --> 01:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
going above the payroll protection
 
01:59:51.360 --> 01:59:53.189 align:start position:0%
going above the payroll protection
program

01:59:53.189 --> 01:59:53.199 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:59:56.310 --> 01:59:56.320 align:start position:0%
until you get to the top
 
01:59:59.750 --> 01:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
and that was the auditors
 
02:00:02.390 --> 02:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
so we would be in agreement with the
 
02:00:02.400 --> 02:00:03.189 align:start position:0%
so we would be in agreement with the
senate

02:00:03.189 --> 02:00:03.199 align:start position:0%
senate
 
02:00:07.030 --> 02:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:11.109 --> 02:00:11.119 align:start position:0%
the uh the other thing we were
 
02:00:15.350 --> 02:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
different is the senate came up with a
 
02:00:19.589 --> 02:00:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:22.870 --> 02:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
which sets the meals and rooms
 
02:00:26.070 --> 02:00:26.080 align:start position:0%
tax takes 30 percent
 
02:00:29.270 --> 02:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
after uh paying administrative costs and
 
02:00:32.629 --> 02:00:32.639 align:start position:0%
some other thing sending 30 percent
 
02:00:35.910 --> 02:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
to a special dedicated fund
 
02:00:41.430 --> 02:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
managed by the treasury and not
 
02:00:44.550 --> 02:00:44.560 align:start position:0%
managed by the finance committee
 
02:00:48.070 --> 02:00:48.080 align:start position:0%
and to be distributed to the towns and
 
02:00:48.080 --> 02:00:48.950 align:start position:0%
and to be distributed to the towns and
cities

02:00:48.950 --> 02:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
cities
 
02:00:51.430 --> 02:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
which is about 50 million dollars more
 
02:00:56.070 --> 02:00:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:59.910 --> 02:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:01.669 --> 02:01:01.679 align:start position:0%
we would have to get an agreement on
 
02:01:01.679 --> 02:01:04.790 align:start position:0%
we would have to get an agreement on
that

02:01:04.790 --> 02:01:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:06.709 --> 02:01:06.719 align:start position:0%
chairman the result of this is that
 
02:01:08.709 --> 02:01:08.719 align:start position:0%
we're going to have an abrupt
 
02:01:13.030 --> 02:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
dip in the reporting
 
02:01:16.310 --> 02:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
of the meals and rooms fund
 
02:01:19.030 --> 02:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
it's going to be at 70 of what it was
 
02:01:19.040 --> 02:01:20.550 align:start position:0%
it's going to be at 70 of what it was
before

02:01:20.550 --> 02:01:20.560 align:start position:0%
before
 
02:01:24.950 --> 02:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
so even though it's not a total 30
 
02:01:26.709 --> 02:01:26.719 align:start position:0%
that's going to the municipalities the
 
02:01:28.229 --> 02:01:28.239 align:start position:0%
way they're handling this
 
02:01:31.510 --> 02:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
if we do this dedicated fund is that uh
 
02:01:34.790 --> 02:01:34.800 align:start position:0%
most of uh 30 of the rooms and meals
 
02:01:35.990 --> 02:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
revenue that we've been
 
02:01:39.910 --> 02:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:42.870 --> 02:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
right right now we send i think around
 
02:01:44.229 --> 02:01:44.239 align:start position:0%
20 something percent
 
02:01:47.510 --> 02:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
is it right uh the the percentage varies
 
02:01:49.430 --> 02:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
from year to year so the
 
02:01:51.430 --> 02:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
the meals and rooms distribution has
 
02:01:51.440 --> 02:01:52.470 align:start position:0%
the meals and rooms distribution has
been

02:01:52.470 --> 02:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
been
 
02:01:56.229 --> 02:01:56.239 align:start position:0%
um suspended or controlled
 
02:01:57.669 --> 02:01:57.679 align:start position:0%
over for the last decade by the
 
02:01:59.430 --> 02:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
legislature so
 
02:02:02.390 --> 02:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
in in statute it the intention was to
 
02:02:05.189 --> 02:02:05.199 align:start position:0%
let it grow to 40 percent over time
 
02:02:07.109 --> 02:02:07.119 align:start position:0%
and it was a five million dollar cap per
 
02:02:08.790 --> 02:02:08.800 align:start position:0%
year and the growth of that fund
 
02:02:11.910 --> 02:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
or that distribution but since the
 
02:02:15.030 --> 02:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2010 the legislature has
 
02:02:15.040 --> 02:02:15.669 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2010 the legislature has
decided

02:02:15.669 --> 02:02:15.679 align:start position:0%
decided
 
02:02:18.790 --> 02:02:18.800 align:start position:0%
a figure that it would appropriate and
 
02:02:21.189 --> 02:02:21.199 align:start position:0%
that would be distributed due to various
 
02:02:21.199 --> 02:02:22.149 align:start position:0%
that would be distributed due to various
reasons

02:02:22.149 --> 02:02:22.159 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
02:02:23.750 --> 02:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
um this year the governor's proposed
 
02:02:25.430 --> 02:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
budget was to increase it
 
02:02:29.589 --> 02:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
to 73.6 million dollars and 22
 
02:02:33.510 --> 02:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
and 78 point um million dollars in
 
02:02:35.750 --> 02:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
23. so he was going and he didn't
 
02:02:38.390 --> 02:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
suspend the language
 
02:02:40.629 --> 02:02:40.639 align:start position:0%
that allowed for that growth the senate
 
02:02:42.629 --> 02:02:42.639 align:start position:0%
plan was to say
 
02:02:44.390 --> 02:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
let's move that all off into a
 
02:02:45.990 --> 02:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
restricted fund
 
02:02:49.189 --> 02:02:49.199 align:start position:0%
let's make the amount equal to 30
 
02:02:51.430 --> 02:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
take it out of the the budget debate so
 
02:02:52.709 --> 02:02:52.719 align:start position:0%
that the
 
02:02:55.189 --> 02:02:55.199 align:start position:0%
communities would be getting the the
 
02:02:55.199 --> 02:02:56.790 align:start position:0%
communities would be getting the the
distribution

02:02:56.790 --> 02:02:56.800 align:start position:0%
distribution
 
02:02:59.669 --> 02:02:59.679 align:start position:0%
um without it becoming something that
 
02:03:01.270 --> 02:03:01.280 align:start position:0%
budget negotiators
 
02:03:03.270 --> 02:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
would tweak in order to get dollars that
 
02:03:04.470 --> 02:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
they might want
 
02:03:07.589 --> 02:03:07.599 align:start position:0%
to save or to spend we don't see the
 
02:03:07.599 --> 02:03:08.070 align:start position:0%
to save or to spend we don't see the
full

02:03:08.070 --> 02:03:08.080 align:start position:0%
full
 
02:03:10.790 --> 02:03:10.800 align:start position:0%
effect of that because we're already
 
02:03:10.800 --> 02:03:12.310 align:start position:0%
effect of that because we're already
transferring

02:03:12.310 --> 02:03:12.320 align:start position:0%
transferring
 
02:03:16.950 --> 02:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
around 25 could be 21 or something like
 
02:03:16.960 --> 02:03:17.750 align:start position:0%
around 25 could be 21 or something like
that

02:03:17.750 --> 02:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:03:20.070 --> 02:03:20.080 align:start position:0%
so it's the difference between that and
 
02:03:21.750 --> 02:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
the 30
 
02:03:25.189 --> 02:03:25.199 align:start position:0%
yep and then so that's why
 
02:03:27.910 --> 02:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
over the course of the biennium they're
 
02:03:28.950 --> 02:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
going to be getting
 
02:03:32.790 --> 02:03:32.800 align:start position:0%
an extra 50 something million dollars
 
02:03:37.510 --> 02:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
just distributed to the towns and cities
 
02:03:40.149 --> 02:03:40.159 align:start position:0%
mr chairman because of the dedicated
 
02:03:42.870 --> 02:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
fund provision that they put in
 
02:03:45.910 --> 02:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
on the monthly revenue focus starting in
 
02:03:47.510 --> 02:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
july i believe
 
02:03:50.870 --> 02:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
maybe august is going to show set
 
02:03:53.430 --> 02:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
30 percent less revenue in rooms and
 
02:03:56.069 --> 02:03:56.079 align:start position:0%
meals than there was before
 
02:03:59.030 --> 02:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
minus that five cents that the governor
 
02:04:00.550 --> 02:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
put in
 
02:04:03.910 --> 02:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
uh right
 
02:04:07.350 --> 02:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
because now it's taken out
 
02:04:09.830 --> 02:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
in no longer versus the budget process
 
02:04:14.470 --> 02:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:17.750 --> 02:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
can i speak to this yes dr
 
02:04:21.030 --> 02:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
names um i think this is an important
 
02:04:23.350 --> 02:04:23.360 align:start position:0%
important question but it's not
 
02:04:25.430 --> 02:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
directly related to our the task that's
 
02:04:26.550 --> 02:04:26.560 align:start position:0%
before us
 
02:04:30.629 --> 02:04:30.639 align:start position:0%
we need we need right now we've got
 
02:04:32.229 --> 02:04:32.239 align:start position:0%
we're looking at a picture that shows
 
02:04:34.390 --> 02:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
the education and
 
02:04:38.229 --> 02:04:38.239 align:start position:0%
general fund combined so uh we're seeing
 
02:04:39.030 --> 02:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
pretty much
 
02:04:41.430 --> 02:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
the whole picture but not quite because
 
02:04:44.149 --> 02:04:44.159 align:start position:0%
there are a few things that have been
 
02:04:47.430 --> 02:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
um sent off outside of this picture that
 
02:04:48.470 --> 02:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
we're looking at
 
02:04:50.550 --> 02:04:50.560 align:start position:0%
and now we're talking about another
 
02:04:51.990 --> 02:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
send-off of a big
 
02:04:55.189 --> 02:04:55.199 align:start position:0%
chunk of money to another fund
 
02:04:58.069 --> 02:04:58.079 align:start position:0%
and to me the answer to this problem is
 
02:04:58.079 --> 02:04:58.950 align:start position:0%
and to me the answer to this problem is
to

02:04:58.950 --> 02:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:05:02.950 --> 02:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
widen the pitch the frame of our picture
 
02:05:04.790 --> 02:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
as we go forward and i think it's a
 
02:05:07.030 --> 02:05:07.040 align:start position:0%
different discussion but when we
 
02:05:09.030 --> 02:05:09.040 align:start position:0%
are estimating revenues we're going to
 
02:05:11.189 --> 02:05:11.199 align:start position:0%
have to look at the rooms and meals tax
 
02:05:14.310 --> 02:05:14.320 align:start position:0%
as a whole and then
 
02:05:16.229 --> 02:05:16.239 align:start position:0%
divvy it up just as we do with the
 
02:05:19.109 --> 02:05:19.119 align:start position:0%
business tax right now
 
02:05:21.669 --> 02:05:21.679 align:start position:0%
and part of the divine is to a new fund
 
02:05:22.629 --> 02:05:22.639 align:start position:0%
which i hope
 
02:05:24.229 --> 02:05:24.239 align:start position:0%
will become part of the picture we're
 
02:05:26.069 --> 02:05:26.079 align:start position:0%
looking at when we
 
02:05:28.870 --> 02:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
do this whole thing and it is done in
 
02:05:30.550 --> 02:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
such a way that people can see
 
02:05:30.560 --> 02:05:31.990 align:start position:0%
such a way that people can see
continuity

02:05:31.990 --> 02:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
continuity
 
02:05:34.629 --> 02:05:34.639 align:start position:0%
from before the establishment of a
 
02:05:37.030 --> 02:05:37.040 align:start position:0%
separate fund
 
02:05:40.629 --> 02:05:40.639 align:start position:0%
for meals and room local
 
02:05:43.669 --> 02:05:43.679 align:start position:0%
sharing whatever you call it um
 
02:05:47.350 --> 02:05:47.360 align:start position:0%
and after it's just a matter of doing it
 
02:05:47.360 --> 02:05:47.750 align:start position:0%
and after it's just a matter of doing it
right

02:05:47.750 --> 02:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:05:48.950 --> 02:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
i don't know whether it can be done
 
02:05:50.470 --> 02:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
administratively or whether it's going
 
02:05:53.430 --> 02:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
to require legislation but i hope we can
 
02:05:57.589 --> 02:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
try to try to do it in a way that
 
02:05:59.990 --> 02:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
allows people to see what's happened
 
02:06:02.069 --> 02:06:02.079 align:start position:0%
over a period of years and also allows
 
02:06:04.149 --> 02:06:04.159 align:start position:0%
us to do our job
 
02:06:05.510 --> 02:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
right we're still going to have to
 
02:06:07.189 --> 02:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
estimate the total
 
02:06:11.030 --> 02:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
meals and rooms tax knowing that
 
02:06:13.189 --> 02:06:13.199 align:start position:0%
the rooms and meals tax that we collect
 
02:06:13.199 --> 02:06:14.470 align:start position:0%
the rooms and meals tax that we collect
for

02:06:14.470 --> 02:06:14.480 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:06:18.069 --> 02:06:18.079 align:start position:0%
car rental that's taken off
 
02:06:21.430 --> 02:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
and sent to the education trust fund
 
02:06:25.350 --> 02:06:25.360 align:start position:0%
now we have the 30 of
 
02:06:27.669 --> 02:06:27.679 align:start position:0%
what's left after administrative costs
 
02:06:28.390 --> 02:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
and the
 
02:06:32.069 --> 02:06:32.079 align:start position:0%
distributed distribution for the
 
02:06:35.109 --> 02:06:35.119 align:start position:0%
education trust fund 30 of what's left
 
02:06:37.589 --> 02:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
then goes to the special dedicated fund
 
02:06:40.950 --> 02:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:43.030 --> 02:06:43.040 align:start position:0%
and then what's left goes to the general
 
02:06:44.870 --> 02:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
fund but we need to know
 
02:06:49.510 --> 02:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
the total number right
 
02:06:53.109 --> 02:06:53.119 align:start position:0%
that's another exercise
 
02:06:57.109 --> 02:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
but when you look at this
 
02:07:00.310 --> 02:07:00.320 align:start position:0%
table what we see
 
02:07:05.430 --> 02:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:10.310 --> 02:07:10.320 align:start position:0%
the senate took out the
 
02:07:13.030 --> 02:07:13.040 align:start position:0%
addition of the two auditors and
 
02:07:13.040 --> 02:07:14.550 align:start position:0%
addition of the two auditors and
therefore

02:07:14.550 --> 02:07:14.560 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
02:07:17.830 --> 02:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
we will not see that revenue and
 
02:07:20.229 --> 02:07:20.239 align:start position:0%
everything else and then also they took
 
02:07:20.239 --> 02:07:21.430 align:start position:0%
everything else and then also they took
out

02:07:21.430 --> 02:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:07:24.470 --> 02:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
a single sales factor
 
02:07:28.390 --> 02:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:33.910 --> 02:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:36.790 --> 02:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
if you don't agree with me no we're okay
 
02:07:37.750 --> 02:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
with this
 
02:07:39.990 --> 02:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
now the payroll protection we're going
 
02:07:41.669 --> 02:07:41.679 align:start position:0%
to we're okay with that because we're
 
02:07:43.790 --> 02:07:43.800 align:start position:0%
going to use the same
 
02:07:49.750 --> 02:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
25.4 and the 44 in our revenue estimates
 
02:07:53.189 --> 02:07:53.199 align:start position:0%
the dedicated fund for the 30
 
02:07:57.189 --> 02:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:00.870 --> 02:08:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh chris we we need to have
 
02:08:04.390 --> 02:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
broken down the total mills and rooms
 
02:08:04.400 --> 02:08:05.750 align:start position:0%
broken down the total mills and rooms
tax

02:08:05.750 --> 02:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
tax
 
02:08:09.030 --> 02:08:09.040 align:start position:0%
and then what goes what gets siphoned
 
02:08:09.040 --> 02:08:09.669 align:start position:0%
and then what goes what gets siphoned
off

02:08:09.669 --> 02:08:09.679 align:start position:0%
off
 
02:08:13.589 --> 02:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
and then what's left that goes out to 30
 
02:08:17.430 --> 02:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
so the 90 the negative 92.6 and 95.6
 
02:08:19.990 --> 02:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
is the estimated amount that would come
 
02:08:21.030 --> 02:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
out of the base
 
02:08:23.910 --> 02:08:23.920 align:start position:0%
meals and rooms up above which allows
 
02:08:23.920 --> 02:08:25.430 align:start position:0%
meals and rooms up above which allows
for

02:08:25.430 --> 02:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:08:28.950 --> 02:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
um the the transfer to the education
 
02:08:30.470 --> 02:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
trust fund so that's considered in the
 
02:08:30.480 --> 02:08:31.510 align:start position:0%
trust fund so that's considered in the
formula

02:08:31.510 --> 02:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
formula
 
02:08:35.030 --> 02:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
yeah i i thought the 30
 
02:08:38.550 --> 02:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
came after they removed the
 
02:08:42.390 --> 02:08:42.400 align:start position:0%
subscription to the uh the car rental
 
02:08:45.510 --> 02:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
yes education and after they removed the
 
02:08:47.189 --> 02:08:47.199 align:start position:0%
administrative costs
 
02:08:49.830 --> 02:08:49.840 align:start position:0%
yep okay and it's and it's based on the
 
02:08:51.510 --> 02:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
prior year's revenue
 
02:08:53.910 --> 02:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
yes so your distribution in 22 is based
 
02:08:55.669 --> 02:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
on your 21 revenue
 
02:08:59.669 --> 02:08:59.679 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
02:09:02.950 --> 02:09:02.960 align:start position:0%
on mr chairman yes i think
 
02:09:06.310 --> 02:09:06.320 align:start position:0%
we're double counting or rather double
 
02:09:06.320 --> 02:09:07.350 align:start position:0%
we're double counting or rather double
deducting

02:09:07.350 --> 02:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
deducting
 
02:09:09.910 --> 02:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
on the payroll protection program at
 
02:09:10.790 --> 02:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
this point
 
02:09:14.229 --> 02:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
and it would be simpler if we agreed
 
02:09:17.270 --> 02:09:17.280 align:start position:0%
to on the
 
02:09:20.310 --> 02:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
that the house would agree to put 25
 
02:09:23.750 --> 02:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
and 44 in to 22
 
02:09:27.189 --> 02:09:27.199 align:start position:0%
and 23. and then
 
02:09:30.830 --> 02:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
we added those back into our revenue
 
02:09:30.840 --> 02:09:32.229 align:start position:0%
we added those back into our revenue
estimates

02:09:32.229 --> 02:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
estimates
 
02:09:34.790 --> 02:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
because you're going to have to be going
 
02:09:36.950 --> 02:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
back and forth with the senate
 
02:09:40.870 --> 02:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
about oh we had the 25 over there
 
02:09:48.310 --> 02:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:50.149 --> 02:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
i thought we were using those as just a
 
02:09:54.229 --> 02:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
way of reducing the base
 
02:09:57.430 --> 02:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
for lack of anything else to use to
 
02:09:57.440 --> 02:09:58.390 align:start position:0%
for lack of anything else to use to
estimate

02:09:58.390 --> 02:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
estimate
 
02:09:59.750 --> 02:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
what we thought the revenues were going
 
02:10:01.910 --> 02:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
to be because i i
 
02:10:03.189 --> 02:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
i think we should show it the way it's
 
02:10:05.270 --> 02:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
showing here then so it's going to seem
 
02:10:06.069 --> 02:10:06.079 align:start position:0%
like a double
 
02:10:09.270 --> 02:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
count here but a double reduction
 
02:10:12.550 --> 02:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
but um i think
 
02:10:13.669 --> 02:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
i think this is the proper way of
 
02:10:17.350 --> 02:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
dealing with this so 25.4 and the 44
 
02:10:20.950 --> 02:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
is is coming out but
 
02:10:25.750 --> 02:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
i agree if we stay with this
 
02:10:28.709 --> 02:10:28.719 align:start position:0%
are we saying that we're going to uh
 
02:10:28.719 --> 02:10:29.910 align:start position:0%
are we saying that we're going to uh
increase

02:10:29.910 --> 02:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
increase
 
02:10:34.310 --> 02:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
what we came up with by 25.4 and 44.
 
02:10:37.750 --> 02:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
i i don't think because yes
 
02:10:40.830 --> 02:10:40.840 align:start position:0%
can you get can you square us away on
 
02:10:40.840 --> 02:10:42.149 align:start position:0%
can you get can you square us away on
this

02:10:42.149 --> 02:10:42.159 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:10:44.470 --> 02:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
so i i agree that with representative
 
02:10:46.069 --> 02:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
almi in the sense that they'll
 
02:10:47.510 --> 02:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
you're going to have some confusion when
 
02:10:49.030 --> 02:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
you try to present this to the senate
 
02:10:50.229 --> 02:10:50.239 align:start position:0%
because they're going to be looking at
 
02:10:52.709 --> 02:10:52.719 align:start position:0%
the current revenue number
 
02:10:54.350 --> 02:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
and they're going to say our number is
 
02:10:57.750 --> 02:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
997.8 and your number is 9.98 so we
 
02:10:57.760 --> 02:10:59.189 align:start position:0%
997.8 and your number is 9.98 so we
agree

02:10:59.189 --> 02:10:59.199 align:start position:0%
agree
 
02:11:01.910 --> 02:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
just saying well what they may not know
 
02:11:04.229 --> 02:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
and may not get explained is that
 
02:11:06.069 --> 02:11:06.079 align:start position:0%
you've already accounted for the ppp and
 
02:11:07.589 --> 02:11:07.599 align:start position:0%
then you may end up with a
 
02:11:09.910 --> 02:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
double reduction because it would be
 
02:11:11.750 --> 02:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
showing up lower in the
 
02:11:14.069 --> 02:11:14.079 align:start position:0%
adjustments for um changes that are
 
02:11:17.830 --> 02:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:21.510 --> 02:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
so i mean it depends on
 
02:11:24.470 --> 02:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
how this is going to be presented to um
 
02:11:24.480 --> 02:11:24.790 align:start position:0%
how this is going to be presented to um
the

02:11:24.790 --> 02:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:11:26.790 --> 02:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
senate ways and means and the debate or
 
02:11:29.270 --> 02:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
discussion that's going to occur
 
02:11:31.750 --> 02:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
um i understand what you're trying to do
 
02:11:32.390 --> 02:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
02:11:35.669 --> 02:11:35.679 align:start position:0%
you know bring your base down which you
 
02:11:37.270 --> 02:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
you've kind of adjusted and then you can
 
02:11:39.669 --> 02:11:39.679 align:start position:0%
say okay add the 25 back to the 98
 
02:11:42.550 --> 02:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
make a negative adjustment below yeah
 
02:11:46.310 --> 02:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:48.550 --> 02:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
but it or you can leave it the way you
 
02:11:49.830 --> 02:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
have it and then you can
 
02:11:51.750 --> 02:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
just be clear when it's explained to the
 
02:11:54.069 --> 02:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
committee the senate members that
 
02:11:55.910 --> 02:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
you've already accounted for the ppp in
 
02:11:58.149 --> 02:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
your number
 
02:12:01.589 --> 02:12:01.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:06.229 --> 02:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
i could these are one-time payments
 
02:12:09.030 --> 02:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
and so maybe it's a lot easier to
 
02:12:15.030 --> 02:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:16.229 --> 02:12:16.239 align:start position:0%
i agree i think it should be in the
 
02:12:18.950 --> 02:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
surplus statement yeah
 
02:12:21.030 --> 02:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
which is what these figures in this
 
02:12:22.390 --> 02:12:22.400 align:start position:0%
second sheet
 
02:12:24.790 --> 02:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
yeah that's where they go those all end
 
02:12:26.229 --> 02:12:26.239 align:start position:0%
up in the surplus statement that's where
 
02:12:26.239 --> 02:12:26.950 align:start position:0%
up in the surplus statement that's where
these

02:12:26.950 --> 02:12:26.960 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:12:30.870 --> 02:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:34.390 --> 02:12:34.400 align:start position:0%
so if you were to do a house
 
02:12:37.669 --> 02:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
adjustment we
 
02:12:39.589 --> 02:12:39.599 align:start position:0%
because you've already included or taken
 
02:12:40.709 --> 02:12:40.719 align:start position:0%
care of it up above
 
02:12:42.470 --> 02:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
i don't believe we would still show zero
 
02:12:46.870 --> 02:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:48.310 --> 02:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
well the only reason is there's zero
 
02:12:48.320 --> 02:12:51.030 align:start position:0%
well the only reason is there's zero
there

02:12:51.030 --> 02:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:53.270 --> 02:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
we haven't gotten that far right i
 
02:12:53.280 --> 02:12:54.470 align:start position:0%
we haven't gotten that far right i
understood

02:12:54.470 --> 02:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
understood
 
02:12:59.030 --> 02:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:02.149 --> 02:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
of 998 and 22 and 993
 
02:13:05.350 --> 02:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
and 0.7 and 23
 
02:13:09.270 --> 02:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
that's already accounted for the 25.4
 
02:13:10.310 --> 02:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
million of the
 
02:13:13.189 --> 02:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
payroll protection in 22 and then you
 
02:13:14.790 --> 02:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
adjusted because you reduced your base
 
02:13:16.390 --> 02:13:16.400 align:start position:0%
in 22 you reduced
 
02:13:19.669 --> 02:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
23 by 18.6
 
02:13:22.709 --> 02:13:22.719 align:start position:0%
yeah i can see if
 
02:13:27.109 --> 02:13:27.119 align:start position:0%
if we were appears and used current law
 
02:13:30.709 --> 02:13:30.719 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't be showing that adjustment
 
02:13:34.709 --> 02:13:34.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:37.830 --> 02:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
base numbers would be higher and then
 
02:13:39.990 --> 02:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
on here the payroll protection you'd see
 
02:13:40.950 --> 02:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
the 25
 
02:13:43.990 --> 02:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
4 and the 44 the adjustment
 
02:13:47.430 --> 02:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
because it's still not current why that
 
02:13:50.870 --> 02:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
even though we passed it in the senate
 
02:13:53.910 --> 02:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
has the governor signed it
 
02:13:57.270 --> 02:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
um i don't know i don't know so
 
02:14:00.709 --> 02:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
it's not current line yet so we need to
 
02:14:04.229 --> 02:14:04.239 align:start position:0%
actually show it in our revenue numbers
 
02:14:07.270 --> 02:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
and then adjust it by
 
02:14:10.470 --> 02:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
putting it on the payroll protection
 
02:14:13.510 --> 02:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
changes to current law mr
 
02:14:16.950 --> 02:14:16.960 align:start position:0%
chairman we've got a long-term
 
02:14:21.030 --> 02:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
policy of when a bill passes
 
02:14:24.390 --> 02:14:24.400 align:start position:0%
the the house or the senate the house or
 
02:14:25.189 --> 02:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
02:14:27.990 --> 02:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
can include it as current law in the
 
02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:28.550 align:start position:0%
can include it as current law in the
budget

02:14:28.550 --> 02:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:14:28.560 --> 02:14:36.390 align:start position:0%
budget
stuff

02:14:36.390 --> 02:14:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:41.830 --> 02:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
that's the case
 
02:14:46.149 --> 02:14:46.159 align:start position:0%
uh chris i'm going to rely on you
 
02:14:48.870 --> 02:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
it's the proper method i would suggest
 
02:14:50.470 --> 02:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
even if it's signed into law before a
 
02:14:51.990 --> 02:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
committee a conference is held that you
 
02:14:53.990 --> 02:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
still treat it as if it hasn't
 
02:14:55.510 --> 02:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
it's not in your base current law
 
02:14:57.270 --> 02:14:57.280 align:start position:0%
numbers that you have it separated out
 
02:14:59.350 --> 02:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
on a surplus statement
 
02:15:01.270 --> 02:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
and that way and that way you have a a
 
02:15:02.870 --> 02:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
place to go
 
02:15:04.470 --> 02:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
to look back on to see what did you
 
02:15:06.069 --> 02:15:06.079 align:start position:0%
adjust for
 
02:15:09.189 --> 02:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
if it's buried in the in the number
 
02:15:11.189 --> 02:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
um the base number up above or the
 
02:15:13.510 --> 02:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
current law number up above
 
02:15:15.030 --> 02:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
it would be harder to trace back what
 
02:15:16.629 --> 02:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
you accounted or what you
 
02:15:18.310 --> 02:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
estimated would be the impact of the
 
02:15:18.320 --> 02:15:19.990 align:start position:0%
estimated would be the impact of the
change

02:15:19.990 --> 02:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
change
 
02:15:23.830 --> 02:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
let us do it that way so
 
02:15:27.350 --> 02:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
you would add 25.4 million back to 22
 
02:15:30.470 --> 02:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
and 18.6 million back to 23 and then
 
02:15:31.910 --> 02:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
show a negative adjustment
 
02:15:36.069 --> 02:15:36.079 align:start position:0%
below at 25 4 and 44. yes
 
02:15:39.669 --> 02:15:39.679 align:start position:0%
and then and then then that would
 
02:15:42.310 --> 02:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
then everything to be shown in the
 
02:15:44.390 --> 02:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
bottom line
 
02:15:48.830 --> 02:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:48.840 --> 02:15:52.310 align:start position:0%
 
adjustments

02:15:52.310 --> 02:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:54.069 --> 02:15:54.079 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i've had my hand up to try
 
02:15:57.109 --> 02:15:57.119 align:start position:0%
and weigh in on this uh representative
 
02:16:00.470 --> 02:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you um correct me if i'm
 
02:16:03.830 --> 02:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
wrong but i think we're going astray
 
02:16:07.990 --> 02:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
this looks like a double adjustment
 
02:16:11.669 --> 02:16:11.679 align:start position:0%
but it's not the purpose
 
02:16:14.870 --> 02:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
of the offsets
 
02:16:18.550 --> 02:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
uh based on law changes
 
02:16:22.390 --> 02:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
is to refund monies already collected in
 
02:16:25.990 --> 02:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
fy 21 and already in
 
02:16:29.510 --> 02:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
our fy21 estimate
 
02:16:32.870 --> 02:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
the purpose of reducing
 
02:16:37.110 --> 02:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
the base for the purpose of growing
 
02:16:40.389 --> 02:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
the 22 and 23 numbers
 
02:16:42.629 --> 02:16:42.639 align:start position:0%
is to make sure that those funds that
 
02:16:45.750 --> 02:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
will be refunded next year
 
02:16:51.910 --> 02:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:53.990 --> 02:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
i actually agree with that by the way
 
02:16:55.270 --> 02:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
that's where i was trying to go with
 
02:16:55.280 --> 02:16:56.230 align:start position:0%
that's where i was trying to go with
this

02:16:56.230 --> 02:16:56.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:16:57.349 --> 02:16:57.359 align:start position:0%
yes that's what that's what
 
02:16:59.110 --> 02:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
representative abrami was saying and i
 
02:16:59.990 --> 02:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
agree with it
 
02:17:01.990 --> 02:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
you know well but you said it more
 
02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
you know well but you said it more
eloquently

02:17:02.760 --> 02:17:02.770 align:start position:0%
eloquently
 
02:17:02.770 --> 02:17:05.830 align:start position:0%
eloquently
[Laughter]

02:17:05.830 --> 02:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
02:17:08.629 --> 02:17:08.639 align:start position:0%
i think we i think we we subtracted uh
 
02:17:10.549 --> 02:17:10.559 align:start position:0%
we put in the surplus statement to minus
 
02:17:12.870 --> 02:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
25 and the minus 44
 
02:17:14.549 --> 02:17:14.559 align:start position:0%
and keep our revenues the way they are
 
02:17:15.990 --> 02:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
as we predict okay
 
02:17:18.150 --> 02:17:18.160 align:start position:0%
is that what you're saying to mr
 
02:17:18.160 --> 02:17:19.509 align:start position:0%
is that what you're saying to mr
representative

02:17:19.509 --> 02:17:19.519 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:17:21.110 --> 02:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
yeah that's precisely what i'm saying
 
02:17:27.030 --> 02:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:29.589 --> 02:17:29.599 align:start position:0%
okay and chris are you all right with
 
02:17:29.599 --> 02:17:30.309 align:start position:0%
okay and chris are you all right with
that

02:17:30.309 --> 02:17:30.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:17:31.910 --> 02:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm fine with whatever the committee
 
02:17:34.070 --> 02:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
wants to do that's fine it makes sense
 
02:17:36.230 --> 02:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
it's if that's you just need to make
 
02:17:38.070 --> 02:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
sure that it gets communicated
 
02:17:39.910 --> 02:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
if there's if you if there's any
 
02:17:42.389 --> 02:17:42.399 align:start position:0%
confusion on what's happening that's all
 
02:17:45.509 --> 02:17:45.519 align:start position:0%
right um but the suggestion would is
 
02:17:47.030 --> 02:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
that you you've made your adjustments
 
02:17:48.709 --> 02:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
you're going to have a number of 998 and
 
02:17:52.389 --> 02:17:52.399 align:start position:0%
22 a number of 993.7 and 23
 
02:17:53.910 --> 02:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
and that you would agree that you should
 
02:17:55.429 --> 02:17:55.439 align:start position:0%
show on a surplus statement
 
02:17:59.110 --> 02:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
a negative adjustment of 25.4 and 22 and
 
02:18:03.030 --> 02:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:06.870 --> 02:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
fine i'm asking i just want to make sure
 
02:18:06.880 --> 02:18:07.509 align:start position:0%
fine i'm asking i just want to make sure
that's

02:18:07.509 --> 02:18:07.519 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:18:08.709 --> 02:18:08.719 align:start position:0%
what i'm understanding representative
 
02:18:10.230 --> 02:18:10.240 align:start position:0%
spillsbury and representative abrami and
 
02:18:10.240 --> 02:18:10.870 align:start position:0%
spillsbury and representative abrami and
ames

02:18:10.870 --> 02:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
ames
 
02:18:12.549 --> 02:18:12.559 align:start position:0%
representative that captures it exactly
 
02:18:14.469 --> 02:18:14.479 align:start position:0%
chris thank you yep
 
02:18:17.669 --> 02:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
thank you okay then the
 
02:18:21.589 --> 02:18:21.599 align:start position:0%
only other change is in the last
 
02:18:24.709 --> 02:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
line before the bold
 
02:18:26.230 --> 02:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
is the additional transfer to the
 
02:18:28.230 --> 02:18:28.240 align:start position:0%
education trust fund
 
02:18:31.990 --> 02:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
um you want to do the brick explanation
 
02:18:32.629 --> 02:18:32.639 align:start position:0%
on that
 
02:18:35.990 --> 02:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
question so the lottery commission um
 
02:18:37.750 --> 02:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
purchased the building that it currently
 
02:18:40.230 --> 02:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
is in and so they were paying a mortgage
 
02:18:41.509 --> 02:18:41.519 align:start position:0%
on that they got permission from the
 
02:18:43.509 --> 02:18:43.519 align:start position:0%
legislature i think two budgets ago to
 
02:18:44.709 --> 02:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
do that
 
02:18:47.349 --> 02:18:47.359 align:start position:0%
um the thought was and and the section
 
02:18:49.509 --> 02:18:49.519 align:start position:0%
has been added to uh house bill 2 to
 
02:18:51.750 --> 02:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
actually pay off that mortgage
 
02:18:54.469 --> 02:18:54.479 align:start position:0%
and as a result the um mortgage payments
 
02:18:55.030 --> 02:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
that of
 
02:18:58.070 --> 02:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
about 200 000 each year would then
 
02:18:59.830 --> 02:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
be transferred into the education trust
 
02:19:01.429 --> 02:19:01.439 align:start position:0%
fund instead of being used to
 
02:19:03.830 --> 02:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
pay the mortgage so that's where that
 
02:19:08.070 --> 02:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:12.389 --> 02:19:12.399 align:start position:0%
all right it says mr chairman
 
02:19:15.429 --> 02:19:15.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:18.870 --> 02:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
so the house is not going to argue about
 
02:19:22.389 --> 02:19:22.399 align:start position:0%
not including those two high-level
 
02:19:23.990 --> 02:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
auditors which i think
 
02:19:27.349 --> 02:19:27.359 align:start position:0%
we need badly once we have market-based
 
02:19:29.509 --> 02:19:29.519 align:start position:0%
sourcing and single sales factor and
 
02:19:33.270 --> 02:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
need to find people outside of the state
 
02:19:35.349 --> 02:19:35.359 align:start position:0%
uh i don't represent women i don't know
 
02:19:37.110 --> 02:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
what the house's position will be as it
 
02:19:38.070 --> 02:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
comes to the
 
02:19:40.790 --> 02:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
the auditor positions the the house
 
02:19:42.950 --> 02:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
position was to include them
 
02:19:44.709 --> 02:19:44.719 align:start position:0%
the senate position is to remove them so
 
02:19:45.990 --> 02:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
the committee of conference would work
 
02:19:47.349 --> 02:19:47.359 align:start position:0%
that out and i don't know where that
 
02:19:48.150 --> 02:19:48.160 align:start position:0%
will end up
 
02:19:50.550 --> 02:19:50.560 align:start position:0%
we will have to argue for that right
 
02:19:51.190 --> 02:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
right and
 
02:19:54.630 --> 02:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
and again i don't and i make no uh
 
02:19:57.270 --> 02:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
suggestions on who's whose position will
 
02:20:02.710 --> 02:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
be negotiated and where you'll end up
 
02:20:05.270 --> 02:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
if we want to maintain our revenues
 
02:20:07.670 --> 02:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
we've got to get those auditors
 
02:20:10.550 --> 02:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
um representative spillsbury and then i
 
02:20:11.830 --> 02:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
want to get back
 
02:20:14.830 --> 02:20:14.840 align:start position:0%
to the base revenues for the rest of
 
02:20:17.590 --> 02:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
them still he wipes to go
 
02:20:21.270 --> 02:20:21.280 align:start position:0%
represent if my hands up i
 
02:20:25.510 --> 02:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
again i'm finished okay
 
02:20:27.990 --> 02:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
okay can you go back to the general
 
02:20:31.510 --> 02:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
education trust fund estimates
 
02:20:33.910 --> 02:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
now we want to go to meals and room
 
02:20:33.920 --> 02:20:35.510 align:start position:0%
now we want to go to meals and room
stocks

02:20:35.510 --> 02:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
stocks
 
02:20:37.270 --> 02:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
now that you get rid of the easy ones
 
02:20:40.309 --> 02:20:40.319 align:start position:0%
we'll go to the hard ones
 
02:20:43.670 --> 02:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
so so the the amount you see in 21 is
 
02:20:45.990 --> 02:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
again reflective of what was collected
 
02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:46.710 align:start position:0%
again reflective of what was collected
through

02:20:46.710 --> 02:20:46.720 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:20:49.429 --> 02:20:49.439 align:start position:0%
april um and then estimating what may
 
02:20:50.070 --> 02:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
and june
 
02:20:52.950 --> 02:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
would bring in and that's how you get to
 
02:20:56.630 --> 02:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
the 320.4 million and 21
 
02:20:58.910 --> 02:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
um and then in 22 the senate went to
 
02:21:02.870 --> 02:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
342.8 and then in 23 359.9 and you can
 
02:21:03.510 --> 02:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
see it's
 
02:21:05.910 --> 02:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
very similar to what the the house had
 
02:21:07.429 --> 02:21:07.439 align:start position:0%
um the the feeling
 
02:21:08.870 --> 02:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
or the discussion was around there's
 
02:21:10.469 --> 02:21:10.479 align:start position:0%
some pent-up
 
02:21:13.830 --> 02:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
desire to get out um but that will
 
02:21:16.309 --> 02:21:16.319 align:start position:0%
will will fade away pretty quickly as as
 
02:21:16.950 --> 02:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
02:21:20.150 --> 02:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
um stimulus money that individuals
 
02:21:20.160 --> 02:21:21.030 align:start position:0%
um stimulus money that individuals
received

02:21:21.030 --> 02:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
received
 
02:21:25.110 --> 02:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
um starts to diminish and um other
 
02:21:27.510 --> 02:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
you know uh that pent-up demand
 
02:21:29.110 --> 02:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
diminishes i guess for
 
02:21:32.630 --> 02:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
lack of a better dis uh statement
 
02:21:34.230 --> 02:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
so that's how they ended up at the you
 
02:21:36.150 --> 02:21:36.160 align:start position:0%
know slightly ahead in 22 and then they
 
02:21:38.230 --> 02:21:38.240 align:start position:0%
come down just slightly below
 
02:21:40.469 --> 02:21:40.479 align:start position:0%
the house in 23 for the meals and rooms
 
02:21:40.479 --> 02:21:44.309 align:start position:0%
the house in 23 for the meals and rooms
estimates

02:21:44.309 --> 02:21:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:47.910 --> 02:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
mr chair can i start representing
 
02:21:51.429 --> 02:21:51.439 align:start position:0%
uh so through may meals and rooms
 
02:21:54.469 --> 02:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
revenue was 289.1
 
02:21:57.510 --> 02:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
subtract 1.6 for the anomalies from last
 
02:21:57.520 --> 02:21:58.710 align:start position:0%
subtract 1.6 for the anomalies from last
year

02:21:58.710 --> 02:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:22:02.309 --> 02:22:02.319 align:start position:0%
so that we're down to 287.5
 
02:22:05.510 --> 02:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
so now the question is again what what
 
02:22:07.349 --> 02:22:07.359 align:start position:0%
do we think is going to come in
 
02:22:10.389 --> 02:22:10.399 align:start position:0%
this month when we say this month it
 
02:22:11.429 --> 02:22:11.439 align:start position:0%
really is
 
02:22:14.870 --> 02:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
what was the activity last month
 
02:22:17.190 --> 02:22:17.200 align:start position:0%
which is important because it's really
 
02:22:17.200 --> 02:22:18.870 align:start position:0%
which is important because it's really
accelerating

02:22:18.870 --> 02:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
accelerating
 
02:22:22.070 --> 02:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
we saw that in may's revenue which was
 
02:22:22.080 --> 02:22:23.590 align:start position:0%
we saw that in may's revenue which was
really

02:22:23.590 --> 02:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
really
 
02:22:26.710 --> 02:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
april's revenue was 27 million it almost
 
02:22:28.230 --> 02:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
hit target
 
02:22:29.990 --> 02:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh for the first time you know since the
 
02:22:32.389 --> 02:22:32.399 align:start position:0%
pandemic so
 
02:22:34.389 --> 02:22:34.399 align:start position:0%
so if we add the 20 let's if we take a
 
02:22:35.590 --> 02:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
conservative view
 
02:22:37.670 --> 02:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
and say well this month will be the same
 
02:22:38.870 --> 02:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
as last month that's
 
02:22:41.990 --> 02:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
that'll bring us up to 314.5
 
02:22:46.950 --> 02:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
now which is which is 5.9 million below
 
02:22:50.790 --> 02:22:50.800 align:start position:0%
uh the senate number i have a feeling it
 
02:22:52.790 --> 02:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
may be above the 27
 
02:22:55.990 --> 02:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
of may the main number uh so that's
 
02:22:57.030 --> 02:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
where we gotta
 
02:22:59.190 --> 02:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
discuss you know how much how much do we
 
02:23:01.190 --> 02:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
think is going to come in may
 
02:23:04.790 --> 02:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
uh last month 27 million came in
 
02:23:09.190 --> 02:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
uh and that was really for april
 
02:23:10.550 --> 02:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
so we're really saying well how much is
 
02:23:12.469 --> 02:23:12.479 align:start position:0%
going to come in may that would be
 
02:23:15.990 --> 02:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
revenue in june so um
 
02:23:19.990 --> 02:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
and all i know is things are opening up
 
02:23:23.270 --> 02:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
big time uh so
 
02:23:25.349 --> 02:23:25.359 align:start position:0%
i i i i guess i don't have a problem
 
02:23:27.590 --> 02:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
with the senate base number
 
02:23:31.349 --> 02:23:31.359 align:start position:0%
uh but that base number would be 5.9
 
02:23:32.950 --> 02:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
million more
 
02:23:36.710 --> 02:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
than last month's remember the 27 that
 
02:23:38.230 --> 02:23:38.240 align:start position:0%
came in
 
02:23:40.550 --> 02:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
so i'll use that as a starting point for
 
02:23:40.560 --> 02:23:41.270 align:start position:0%
so i'll use that as a starting point for
the discussion

02:23:41.270 --> 02:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
the discussion
 
02:23:45.510 --> 02:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
if you just take what's come in today
 
02:23:49.270 --> 02:23:49.280 align:start position:0%
through the end of may 289.1 as
 
02:23:51.990 --> 02:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
representative romney mentioned and the
 
02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:52.550 align:start position:0%
representative romney mentioned and the
plan

02:23:52.550 --> 02:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
plan
 
02:23:58.870 --> 02:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
is 32.2 those two together is 321.3
 
02:24:01.670 --> 02:24:01.680 align:start position:0%
which is within a few hundred thousand
 
02:24:01.680 --> 02:24:02.230 align:start position:0%
which is within a few hundred thousand
dollars

02:24:02.230 --> 02:24:02.240 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:24:05.990 --> 02:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
of the senate now the 321.3 which is the
 
02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:07.190 align:start position:0%
of the senate now the 321.3 which is the
plan

02:24:07.190 --> 02:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
plan
 
02:24:10.550 --> 02:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
last month from may it just about came
 
02:24:11.590 --> 02:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
into the plan
 
02:24:24.469 --> 02:24:24.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:28.870 --> 02:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
this plan plan was 27.7
 
02:24:32.790 --> 02:24:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:36.230 --> 02:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
and what we received in june
 
02:24:41.670 --> 02:24:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:45.190 --> 02:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
in may so uh i think
 
02:24:48.309 --> 02:24:48.319 align:start position:0%
we're probably going to hit very close
 
02:24:49.190 --> 02:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
to the target
 
02:24:53.830 --> 02:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
or might even exceed it so this 321.3
 
02:24:56.150 --> 02:24:56.160 align:start position:0%
when you just add the plan to what's
 
02:24:58.710 --> 02:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
already come in
 
02:25:00.469 --> 02:25:00.479 align:start position:0%
and you compare that to what the senate
 
02:25:02.230 --> 02:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
has come in i
 
02:25:03.750 --> 02:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
sure they probably did the same they
 
02:25:07.510 --> 02:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:10.550 --> 02:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
where we would come in a little higher
 
02:25:11.510 --> 02:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
than them
 
02:25:15.110 --> 02:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
about 900 000. so that's another number
 
02:25:15.120 --> 02:25:16.710 align:start position:0%
about 900 000. so that's another number
representations

02:25:16.710 --> 02:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
representations
 
02:25:18.710 --> 02:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
yeah i just want to say that i'd go with
 
02:25:20.070 --> 02:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
the senate number i don't think we're
 
02:25:21.510 --> 02:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
going to do any better than that
 
02:25:25.429 --> 02:25:25.439 align:start position:0%
and joan is undoubtedly going to be uh
 
02:25:28.309 --> 02:25:28.319 align:start position:0%
a good month but uh probably consistent
 
02:25:28.319 --> 02:25:28.790 align:start position:0%
a good month but uh probably consistent
with

02:25:28.790 --> 02:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:25:31.910 --> 02:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
historical months before this
 
02:25:34.870 --> 02:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
pandemic hit us and uh so it seems in
 
02:25:36.389 --> 02:25:36.399 align:start position:0%
the bald park and as i say i don't think
 
02:25:38.950 --> 02:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
we're gonna do any better
 
02:25:43.030 --> 02:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
does anybody feel who doesn't agree with
 
02:25:43.040 --> 02:25:43.510 align:start position:0%
does anybody feel who doesn't agree with
what

02:25:43.510 --> 02:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:25:46.710 --> 02:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
president james just said
 
02:25:51.670 --> 02:25:51.680 align:start position:0%
for 21 representative
 
02:25:53.349 --> 02:25:53.359 align:start position:0%
yeah i i think i agree with
 
02:25:54.950 --> 02:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
representative ames
 
02:25:57.990 --> 02:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
on we aren't completely recovered in our
 
02:25:58.000 --> 02:25:58.710 align:start position:0%
on we aren't completely recovered in our
area

02:25:58.710 --> 02:25:58.720 align:start position:0%
area
 
02:26:02.469 --> 02:26:02.479 align:start position:0%
and in when i i stayed in a bit
 
02:26:05.590 --> 02:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
in a uh concord motel and
 
02:26:08.630 --> 02:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
it still had a lot of empty rooms on
 
02:26:10.389 --> 02:26:10.399 align:start position:0%
our restaurants people are still being
 
02:26:12.870 --> 02:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
careful coming too
 
02:26:16.070 --> 02:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
so i don't think we should go above plan
 
02:26:19.110 --> 02:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
but i think plan is
 
02:26:22.469 --> 02:26:22.479 align:start position:0%
uh fine a major um chair
 
02:26:25.030 --> 02:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
um yeah i i'd go with the senate number
 
02:26:26.630 --> 02:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
but you know the only the only
 
02:26:29.750 --> 02:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
anchor that's dragging along the bottom
 
02:26:29.760 --> 02:26:30.230 align:start position:0%
anchor that's dragging along the bottom
of

02:26:30.230 --> 02:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:26:32.830 --> 02:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
the c there is the uh we can't find
 
02:26:32.840 --> 02:26:34.309 align:start position:0%
the c there is the uh we can't find
employees

02:26:34.309 --> 02:26:34.319 align:start position:0%
employees
 
02:26:36.389 --> 02:26:36.399 align:start position:0%
uh i think that's going to be the real
 
02:26:37.830 --> 02:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
real slowdown
 
02:26:39.590 --> 02:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
until we get because some of these
 
02:26:41.270 --> 02:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
hotels can't open to full capacity
 
02:26:43.270 --> 02:26:43.280 align:start position:0%
because they don't have people
 
02:26:46.710 --> 02:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
uh but um same thing with restaurants
 
02:26:49.030 --> 02:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
but i'm i i think we just go with the
 
02:26:50.389 --> 02:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
senate number
 
02:26:51.670 --> 02:26:51.680 align:start position:0%
uh i think i think we're going to
 
02:26:53.990 --> 02:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
definitely hit that
 
02:26:59.510 --> 02:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
okay um the senate number was 320.4
 
02:27:04.389 --> 02:27:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:12.950 --> 02:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:16.790 --> 02:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
and the if you look at the
 
02:27:21.190 --> 02:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
era of growth and
 
02:27:23.910 --> 02:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
meals and roams it said five to ten
 
02:27:23.920 --> 02:27:24.790 align:start position:0%
meals and roams it said five to ten
percent

02:27:24.790 --> 02:27:24.800 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:27:29.030 --> 02:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
normally when there's no pandemic
 
02:27:35.590 --> 02:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:42.830 --> 02:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:42.840 --> 02:27:46.070 align:start position:0%
 
2022

02:27:46.070 --> 02:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:49.590 --> 02:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
we probably would get close to that five
 
02:27:49.600 --> 02:27:55.270 align:start position:0%
we probably would get close to that five
percent

02:27:55.270 --> 02:27:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:01.990 --> 02:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:07.030 --> 02:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:10.389 --> 02:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
would come out to be what number
 
02:28:12.230 --> 02:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
somebody got a calculator they can keep
 
02:28:14.070 --> 02:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
it the senate took
 
02:28:16.790 --> 02:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
seven percent for this year and then it
 
02:28:17.990 --> 02:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
went down
 
02:28:21.030 --> 02:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
to five percent and i calculated them
 
02:28:21.040 --> 02:28:22.150 align:start position:0%
to five percent and i calculated them
out

02:28:22.150 --> 02:28:22.160 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:28:24.550 --> 02:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
okay they took seven percent yeah and
 
02:28:34.550 --> 02:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:41.429 --> 02:28:41.439 align:start position:0%
okay that's why we there's 7 342.87
 
02:28:44.550 --> 02:28:44.560 align:start position:0%
and that's really growing on a really
 
02:28:47.750 --> 02:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
weak base if
 
02:28:50.870 --> 02:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
pandemic never happened we would
 
02:28:52.830 --> 02:28:52.840 align:start position:0%
our base would be much higher yeah
 
02:28:52.840 --> 02:28:55.190 align:start position:0%
our base would be much higher yeah
correct

02:28:55.190 --> 02:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:29:00.710 --> 02:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:03.429 --> 02:29:03.439 align:start position:0%
yeah i'd go with seven percent it's
 
02:29:07.429 --> 02:29:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:11.270 --> 02:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
what's that uh representative um
 
02:29:14.389 --> 02:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
our own march 18th figure uh for fy 22
 
02:29:15.510 --> 02:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
was 341
 
02:29:17.190 --> 02:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
extremely close to what the senate has
 
02:29:21.590 --> 02:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:25.270 --> 02:29:25.280 align:start position:0%
and i checked may may came in um
 
02:29:31.910 --> 02:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:34.150 --> 02:29:34.160 align:start position:0%
so do we want to take accept the senate
 
02:29:36.790 --> 02:29:36.800 align:start position:0%
for the fy 22.
 
02:29:41.429 --> 02:29:41.439 align:start position:0%
yes sure how about fy23
 
02:29:44.550 --> 02:29:44.560 align:start position:0%
they have about five percent growth five
 
02:29:44.560 --> 02:29:45.910 align:start position:0%
they have about five percent growth five
percent

02:29:45.910 --> 02:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:29:47.590 --> 02:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
and that's been the average over the
 
02:29:50.550 --> 02:29:50.560 align:start position:0%
last number of years
 
02:29:52.309 --> 02:29:52.319 align:start position:0%
the seven percent catches us up from a
 
02:29:54.550 --> 02:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
bad base
 
02:29:59.510 --> 02:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:03.429 --> 02:30:03.439 align:start position:0%
and if you're not
 
02:30:05.270 --> 02:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
an agreement to accept the senate
 
02:30:06.630 --> 02:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
numbers for
 
02:30:09.750 --> 02:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
fy for meals and rooms taxes just raise
 
02:30:10.790 --> 02:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
your hand
 
02:30:14.870 --> 02:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
otherwise we can proceed to the next
 
02:30:19.110 --> 02:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
i don't see any hands raised tobacco
 
02:30:22.429 --> 02:30:22.439 align:start position:0%
so so tobacco you see the sentence at
 
02:30:22.439 --> 02:30:23.910 align:start position:0%
so so tobacco you see the sentence at
247.5

02:30:23.910 --> 02:30:23.920 align:start position:0%
247.5
 
02:30:27.830 --> 02:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
the house was at 247.8 in 22 they went
 
02:30:29.750 --> 02:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
to 247.5
 
02:30:33.030 --> 02:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
the house was at the reason for the
 
02:30:36.070 --> 02:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
the flat projection in 22
 
02:30:39.510 --> 02:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
um there was some feeling that
 
02:30:41.030 --> 02:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
you're not going to see a lot of change
 
02:30:42.790 --> 02:30:42.800 align:start position:0%
in some of the habits with related to
 
02:30:45.270 --> 02:30:45.280 align:start position:0%
tobacco right now
 
02:30:48.550 --> 02:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
that maybe in another year and a half to
 
02:30:50.150 --> 02:30:50.160 align:start position:0%
two years you might see some some
 
02:30:52.150 --> 02:30:52.160 align:start position:0%
programs start to help with
 
02:30:54.790 --> 02:30:54.800 align:start position:0%
um you know decreasing the smoking that
 
02:30:56.710 --> 02:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
people are engaged in but but
 
02:30:58.870 --> 02:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
with people being home and and having
 
02:31:00.550 --> 02:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
fallen back into some habits
 
02:31:01.990 --> 02:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
there was a feeling that the tobacco
 
02:31:03.910 --> 02:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
sales would continue to be fairly
 
02:31:07.030 --> 02:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
consistent in 22 as it was in 21.
 
02:31:10.870 --> 02:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
there's also some concern that um
 
02:31:12.870 --> 02:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
um you know the cross-border sales will
 
02:31:12.880 --> 02:31:14.150 align:start position:0%
um you know the cross-border sales will
continue

02:31:14.150 --> 02:31:14.160 align:start position:0%
continue
 
02:31:15.910 --> 02:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
until the the federal government does
 
02:31:17.429 --> 02:31:17.439 align:start position:0%
something with the menthol
 
02:31:20.790 --> 02:31:20.800 align:start position:0%
or the the flavored tobacco
 
02:31:23.910 --> 02:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
so and then and then again you see that
 
02:31:27.190 --> 02:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
adjustment in 23 down to 240
 
02:31:30.790 --> 02:31:30.800 align:start position:0%
so that was there the senate's position
 
02:31:33.349 --> 02:31:33.359 align:start position:0%
of it slowing down
 
02:31:35.750 --> 02:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
right that's a three percent slowdown
 
02:31:37.349 --> 02:31:37.359 align:start position:0%
and typically
 
02:31:40.469 --> 02:31:40.479 align:start position:0%
that's what we've been seeing year over
 
02:31:42.630 --> 02:31:42.640 align:start position:0%
years about a three percent
 
02:31:47.830 --> 02:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:49.590 --> 02:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
does anybody have a problem with the
 
02:31:54.150 --> 02:31:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:58.630 --> 02:31:58.640 align:start position:0%
i don't see it the ind
 
02:31:58.640 --> 02:32:01.670 align:start position:0%
i don't see it the ind
[Music]

02:32:01.670 --> 02:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:32:05.190 --> 02:32:05.200 align:start position:0%
liquor yeah
 
02:32:07.910 --> 02:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh well if you would like um we could go
 
02:32:08.830 --> 02:32:08.840 align:start position:0%
through the
 
02:32:11.510 --> 02:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
the business and and
 
02:32:13.270 --> 02:32:13.280 align:start position:0%
revenues that dra collects while they're
 
02:32:15.270 --> 02:32:15.280 align:start position:0%
on the call then i can go back after
 
02:32:17.270 --> 02:32:17.280 align:start position:0%
and do the ones we didn't do in case
 
02:32:19.510 --> 02:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
they need to get off i don't know but
 
02:32:21.110 --> 02:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
just as a courtesy to them since they're
 
02:32:22.630 --> 02:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
waiting with us
 
02:32:26.550 --> 02:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
ind was a the senate was at 131.5
 
02:32:28.870 --> 02:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
which was um 2.7 million above the house
 
02:32:31.030 --> 02:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
position of 128.8
 
02:32:34.230 --> 02:32:34.240 align:start position:0%
uh they went up to 138 and 22 which is a
 
02:32:35.670 --> 02:32:35.680 align:start position:0%
one and a half increase one and a half
 
02:32:37.349 --> 02:32:37.359 align:start position:0%
million dollar increase over the the
 
02:32:38.790 --> 02:32:38.800 align:start position:0%
house position
 
02:32:42.150 --> 02:32:42.160 align:start position:0%
and then they went up to 142.1 in 23
 
02:32:43.030 --> 02:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
which was a
 
02:32:45.630 --> 02:32:45.640 align:start position:0%
4.1 increase over the house position of
 
02:32:45.640 --> 02:32:50.389 align:start position:0%
4.1 increase over the house position of
138.

02:32:50.389 --> 02:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:53.510 --> 02:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
i don't really have anything to
 
02:32:55.510 --> 02:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
to suggest as to why how they got there
 
02:32:56.870 --> 02:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
there was just some discussions that
 
02:32:58.950 --> 02:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
they just felt there was going to be
 
02:33:06.389 --> 02:33:06.399 align:start position:0%
um that level of revenue
 
02:33:10.070 --> 02:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
i represent elmy thank you mr chairman
 
02:33:13.270 --> 02:33:13.280 align:start position:0%
i calculated out again on the basis
 
02:33:16.710 --> 02:33:16.720 align:start position:0%
of how much we get in june excluding
 
02:33:16.720 --> 02:33:17.830 align:start position:0%
of how much we get in june excluding
2020

02:33:17.830 --> 02:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
2020
 
02:33:20.950 --> 02:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
in the last five years
 
02:33:24.469 --> 02:33:24.479 align:start position:0%
in terms of of june relative to the
 
02:33:25.830 --> 02:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
entire year
 
02:33:30.630 --> 02:33:30.640 align:start position:0%
and it comes out as 141.7 for the year
 
02:33:32.630 --> 02:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
so the senate is
 
02:33:37.270 --> 02:33:37.280 align:start position:0%
is um expecting a slowdown in june
 
02:33:39.349 --> 02:33:39.359 align:start position:0%
by those numbers and i don't know
 
02:33:41.750 --> 02:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
whether that's because they were using
 
02:33:44.790 --> 02:33:44.800 align:start position:0%
the the april numbers when they did
 
02:33:44.800 --> 02:33:45.830 align:start position:0%
the the april numbers when they did
their

02:33:45.830 --> 02:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:33:49.030 --> 02:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
analysis which uh did not include
 
02:33:56.630 --> 02:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:00.309 --> 02:34:00.319 align:start position:0%
so your 2021 number
 
02:34:04.910 --> 02:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
for ind and on that basis it would be
 
02:34:04.920 --> 02:34:06.550 align:start position:0%
for ind and on that basis it would be
141.7

02:34:06.550 --> 02:34:06.560 align:start position:0%
141.7
 
02:34:10.870 --> 02:34:10.880 align:start position:0%
on the average june was an average 14.1
 
02:34:10.880 --> 02:34:11.349 align:start position:0%
on the average june was an average 14.1
percent

02:34:11.349 --> 02:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:34:14.469 --> 02:34:14.479 align:start position:0%
and didn't vary a whole lot around that
 
02:34:17.910 --> 02:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
of the full year on
 
02:34:21.030 --> 02:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
for for revenues so it's a question if
 
02:34:22.070 --> 02:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
we're expecting
 
02:34:25.270 --> 02:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
the more refunds to hit in june then
 
02:34:33.580 --> 02:34:33.590 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:33.590 --> 02:34:39.270 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:34:39.270 --> 02:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:46.030 --> 02:34:46.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:49.349 --> 02:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
124 to 132
 
02:34:52.710 --> 02:34:52.720 align:start position:0%
so it's also that one is
 
02:34:55.830 --> 02:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
also based on april only
 
02:35:04.309 --> 02:35:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:08.230 --> 02:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
i i'm sorry i i broke in there um but uh
 
02:35:10.870 --> 02:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
what i i would say is that my general
 
02:35:12.389 --> 02:35:12.399 align:start position:0%
view is that
 
02:35:14.469 --> 02:35:14.479 align:start position:0%
interest and dividends we should should
 
02:35:15.590 --> 02:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
expect it to be
 
02:35:19.590 --> 02:35:19.600 align:start position:0%
relatively high because um it derives
 
02:35:22.550 --> 02:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
significantly from the stock market
 
02:35:28.150 --> 02:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:29.990 --> 02:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
so i would i would go with the higher
 
02:35:31.910 --> 02:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
number that uh representative army is
 
02:35:31.920 --> 02:35:38.870 align:start position:0%
number that uh representative army is
suggesting

02:35:38.870 --> 02:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:38.880 --> 02:35:46.870 align:start position:0%
 
it

02:35:46.870 --> 02:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:48.950 --> 02:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
i think we have to assume that some of
 
02:35:50.150 --> 02:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
the people who have
 
02:35:54.389 --> 02:35:54.399 align:start position:0%
moved here during the pandemic and paid
 
02:35:58.309 --> 02:35:58.319 align:start position:0%
large amounts of cash for houses
 
02:36:01.510 --> 02:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
and are working remotely are
 
02:36:04.710 --> 02:36:04.720 align:start position:0%
newcomers to paying our dividends and
 
02:36:07.590 --> 02:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
interest and dividends tax i think we
 
02:36:08.389 --> 02:36:08.399 align:start position:0%
have a new
 
02:36:13.670 --> 02:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
crop i think that's helpful
 
02:36:16.710 --> 02:36:16.720 align:start position:0%
um what was your number
 
02:36:23.990 --> 02:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:27.830 --> 02:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:31.710 --> 02:36:31.720 align:start position:0%
what was collected year to date
 
02:36:35.349 --> 02:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
121.7 and add
 
02:36:41.030 --> 02:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
the plan it's 139.1
 
02:36:44.150 --> 02:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
and if you look at what
 
02:36:47.349 --> 02:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
has been happening all year on
 
02:36:49.030 --> 02:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
interest and dividend interest and
 
02:36:50.710 --> 02:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
dividends running
 
02:36:56.150 --> 02:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
22 on the average for 11 months
 
02:37:11.990 --> 02:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:14.710 --> 02:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
so what the plan was that would add
 
02:37:14.720 --> 02:37:16.830 align:start position:0%
so what the plan was that would add
another

02:37:16.830 --> 02:37:16.840 align:start position:0%
another
 
02:37:20.150 --> 02:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
three point four it would come out
 
02:37:24.469 --> 02:37:24.479 align:start position:0%
five to 142.5
 
02:37:34.950 --> 02:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:38.150 --> 02:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
so see what i did as i took what's been
 
02:37:39.590 --> 02:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
received to date
 
02:37:45.030 --> 02:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
and then the plan is 17.4 that's 139.1
 
02:37:49.110 --> 02:37:49.120 align:start position:0%
and since the year to date for the last
 
02:37:50.070 --> 02:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
11 months
 
02:37:53.349 --> 02:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
it's been 22 an average of 22
 
02:37:58.389 --> 02:37:58.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:01.670 --> 02:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
10 of the plan is one point seven twenty
 
02:38:01.680 --> 02:38:02.150 align:start position:0%
10 of the plan is one point seven twenty
percent

02:38:02.150 --> 02:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:38:04.150 --> 02:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
is three point four you add that to the
 
02:38:05.670 --> 02:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
one thirty nine point one
 
02:38:07.830 --> 02:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
and you get one forty two point five and
 
02:38:09.190 --> 02:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
that and i
 
02:38:17.910 --> 02:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:19.910 --> 02:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
there's no question that the uh senate's
 
02:38:19.920 --> 02:38:21.750 align:start position:0%
there's no question that the uh senate's
low

02:38:21.750 --> 02:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
low
 
02:38:24.950 --> 02:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
um and you know just
 
02:38:27.349 --> 02:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
bringing it up to plan what does that
 
02:38:29.830 --> 02:38:29.840 align:start position:0%
bring is that up to 139.1 bringing it to
 
02:38:29.840 --> 02:38:30.150 align:start position:0%
bring is that up to 139.1 bringing it to
the

02:38:30.150 --> 02:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:38:33.110 --> 02:38:33.120 align:start position:0%
june plan i i i think we're not going to
 
02:38:35.510 --> 02:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
go below june's plan
 
02:38:37.750 --> 02:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
uh so yeah it's probably going to be
 
02:38:37.760 --> 02:38:39.110 align:start position:0%
uh so yeah it's probably going to be
above

02:38:39.110 --> 02:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
above
 
02:38:42.950 --> 02:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
the 139.1 and definitely above
 
02:38:46.389 --> 02:38:46.399 align:start position:0%
the senate's number because the center
 
02:38:51.830 --> 02:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:54.710 --> 02:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
okay with what you just said norm okay
 
02:38:55.990 --> 02:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
so that i
 
02:39:00.950 --> 02:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
i would go with susan's number 141.7
 
02:39:04.230 --> 02:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
uh how does the rest
 
02:39:07.349 --> 02:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:11.110 --> 02:39:11.120 align:start position:0%
don't be afraid to say something guys
 
02:39:14.389 --> 02:39:14.399 align:start position:0%
yes or no yes
 
02:39:18.389 --> 02:39:18.399 align:start position:0%
okay sam yes then we're going to go with
 
02:39:23.429 --> 02:39:23.439 align:start position:0%
the 141.7 for 2021
 
02:39:27.990 --> 02:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:32.070 --> 02:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:36.790 --> 02:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
on interest and dividend the dra
 
02:39:39.990 --> 02:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
estimates on 22 a four to six percent
 
02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:40.790 align:start position:0%
estimates on 22 a four to six percent
range

02:39:40.790 --> 02:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
range
 
02:39:44.230 --> 02:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
and a two point two to four four percent
 
02:40:04.830 --> 02:40:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:06.710 --> 02:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
um so isn't it
 
02:40:09.750 --> 02:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
did you bring those out to 23 20 22 and
 
02:40:09.760 --> 02:40:11.270 align:start position:0%
did you bring those out to 23 20 22 and
23

02:40:11.270 --> 02:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
23
 
02:40:19.110 --> 02:40:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:22.230 --> 02:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
i did check what the senate did
 
02:40:25.830 --> 02:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:28.070 --> 02:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
which i can't read i think that's a five
 
02:40:30.469 --> 02:40:30.479 align:start position:0%
percent the first year
 
02:40:33.830 --> 02:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
and i'm going down
 
02:40:36.550 --> 02:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
percent the second year okay you're
 
02:40:38.070 --> 02:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
right in the middle
 
02:40:40.790 --> 02:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
on the second year no no up up three
 
02:40:43.110 --> 02:40:43.120 align:start position:0%
percent the second year
 
02:40:44.550 --> 02:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
right in the middle for the second year
 
02:40:46.550 --> 02:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
three percent
 
02:40:52.389 --> 02:40:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:55.910 --> 02:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:58.950 --> 02:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:02.230 --> 02:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
what do we have for numbers 148 148.7
 
02:41:05.910 --> 02:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:12.870 --> 02:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:16.870 --> 02:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
and 153.3 for the
 
02:41:20.469 --> 02:41:20.479 align:start position:0%
three percent between 23.
 
02:41:30.630 --> 02:41:30.640 align:start position:0%
thank you uh let me just check
 
02:41:33.349 --> 02:41:33.359 align:start position:0%
you know the senate's way down i don't
 
02:41:38.550 --> 02:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:41.590 --> 02:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
and we know interest rates are going to
 
02:41:49.190 --> 02:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:53.510 --> 02:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh i do have i don't have a problem with
 
02:41:58.389 --> 02:41:58.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:08.630 --> 02:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:12.710 --> 02:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
can someone repeat the 22 number 122
 
02:42:14.389 --> 02:42:14.399 align:start position:0%
number is 141
 
02:42:14.399 --> 02:42:18.150 align:start position:0%
number is 141
7.

02:42:18.150 --> 02:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:22.349 --> 02:42:22.359 align:start position:0%
21. i mean that's 21. 140
 
02:42:25.990 --> 02:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
8.8 222
 
02:42:31.110 --> 02:42:31.120 align:start position:0%
and 153.3 what 23.
 
02:42:33.590 --> 02:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
before we looks good to me yeah i mean
 
02:42:34.870 --> 02:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
i'm okay with it
 
02:42:38.630 --> 02:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
just just uh can we just ask dra why
 
02:42:41.670 --> 02:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
we're so why their ranges are so much
 
02:42:43.750 --> 02:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
lower than that
 
02:42:47.590 --> 02:42:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:50.630 --> 02:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
carol melissa
 
02:42:53.190 --> 02:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
sure um just to give some information
 
02:42:53.990 --> 02:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
may came in
 
02:42:55.990 --> 02:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
how we anticipated the reason for the
 
02:42:58.070 --> 02:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
decline in june is based on estimate
 
02:42:59.910 --> 02:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
payments estimate payments have been
 
02:43:03.030 --> 02:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
running about 5
 
02:43:06.469 --> 02:43:06.479 align:start position:0%
below all year long so we
 
02:43:09.429 --> 02:43:09.439 align:start position:0%
adjust made an adjustment to plan for
 
02:43:10.630 --> 02:43:10.640 align:start position:0%
estimate payments
 
02:43:12.389 --> 02:43:12.399 align:start position:0%
because it's not a return month it's an
 
02:43:16.230 --> 02:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:20.830 --> 02:43:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:23.190 --> 02:43:23.200 align:start position:0%
the year to date
 
02:43:26.309 --> 02:43:26.319 align:start position:0%
for 11 months we're running
 
02:43:30.070 --> 02:43:30.080 align:start position:0%
22 above plan sure that's primarily
 
02:43:32.150 --> 02:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
driven by returns and extensions and tax
 
02:43:34.469 --> 02:43:34.479 align:start position:0%
notice payments
 
02:43:37.990 --> 02:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
so the activity in 2020 um performed
 
02:43:40.150 --> 02:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
better than what taxpayers anticipated
 
02:43:41.429 --> 02:43:41.439 align:start position:0%
so when they filed their
 
02:43:44.309 --> 02:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
their 2020 return in 2021 they paid more
 
02:43:45.750 --> 02:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
than anticipated
 
02:43:46.790 --> 02:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
and then it looks like they have
 
02:43:48.830 --> 02:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
adjusted their estimate payments down
 
02:43:52.070 --> 02:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
some compared to 2019.
 
02:43:54.309 --> 02:43:54.319 align:start position:0%
so we we thought there would be a
 
02:43:55.429 --> 02:43:55.439 align:start position:0%
decrease in june
 
02:43:56.950 --> 02:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
as it's the second quarter estimate
 
02:43:59.830 --> 02:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
payment to be more on trend
 
02:44:02.070 --> 02:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
um with what we saw in march and april
 
02:44:04.230 --> 02:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
for estimate payments compared to
 
02:44:08.550 --> 02:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
2019. um
 
02:44:12.309 --> 02:44:12.319 align:start position:0%
our trigger is what we come up with for
 
02:44:15.670 --> 02:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
fy 2021.
 
02:44:20.550 --> 02:44:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:25.670 --> 02:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
and this 141.6
 
02:44:30.830 --> 02:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
or 141.7 for 2021 looks like a good
 
02:44:30.840 --> 02:44:32.950 align:start position:0%
or 141.7 for 2021 looks like a good
number

02:44:32.950 --> 02:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
number
 
02:44:38.150 --> 02:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
now the senate had 131.5
 
02:44:43.269 --> 02:44:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:49.590 --> 02:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:52.630 --> 02:44:52.640 align:start position:0%
because you said you said we added we
 
02:44:53.429 --> 02:44:53.439 align:start position:0%
added plan
 
02:44:56.790 --> 02:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
to the number so it must be that the dra
 
02:44:58.309 --> 02:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't feel we're going to hit plan for
 
02:45:01.110 --> 02:45:01.120 align:start position:0%
june is that what i'm hearing melissa
 
02:45:03.590 --> 02:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
that's correct because okay because it's
 
02:45:05.670 --> 02:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
an estimate month and we've been running
 
02:45:07.750 --> 02:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
behind on estimate payments for ind
 
02:45:08.710 --> 02:45:08.720 align:start position:0%
they've been reporting
 
02:45:11.750 --> 02:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
less than anticipated
 
02:45:14.870 --> 02:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
um estimates we
 
02:45:16.630 --> 02:45:16.640 align:start position:0%
do not think that we'll hit plan for
 
02:45:18.389 --> 02:45:18.399 align:start position:0%
june or ind
 
02:45:20.550 --> 02:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
based on estimates not based on returns
 
02:45:22.790 --> 02:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
and extensions
 
02:45:28.389 --> 02:45:28.399 align:start position:0%
because those are not due in june so
 
02:45:32.630 --> 02:45:32.640 align:start position:0%
how much lower would the
 
02:45:35.910 --> 02:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:40.389 --> 02:45:40.399 align:start position:0%
they're talking 10 million dollars so
 
02:45:42.870 --> 02:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
we have um they can range between five
 
02:45:44.070 --> 02:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
percent below plan
 
02:45:50.309 --> 02:45:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:52.710 --> 02:45:52.720 align:start position:0%
hold on one second we think excuse me
 
02:45:53.750 --> 02:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
let me take it back we think they're
 
02:45:55.030 --> 02:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
going to be around um
 
02:45:58.230 --> 02:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
15 below plan for june
 
02:46:01.670 --> 02:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
now plan is 17.4 million
 
02:46:04.710 --> 02:46:04.720 align:start position:0%
10 would be 1.7
 
02:46:05.990 --> 02:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
we think they're going to come in around
 
02:46:08.830 --> 02:46:08.840 align:start position:0%
14.8 million
 
02:46:11.790 --> 02:46:11.800 align:start position:0%
14.8 so that
 
02:46:11.800 --> 02:46:17.050 align:start position:0%
14.8 so that
14.8

02:46:17.050 --> 02:46:17.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:17.060 --> 02:46:21.750 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:46:21.750 --> 02:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:24.950 --> 02:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
so that's 2.6 million dollars less
 
02:46:28.550 --> 02:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
so if we adjust our base
 
02:46:32.790 --> 02:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
2.6 then we would be down
 
02:46:42.309 --> 02:46:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:45.750 --> 02:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
i had 136.5 so did i
 
02:46:50.790 --> 02:46:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:53.910 --> 02:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
what did you how much did you adjust
 
02:46:57.349 --> 02:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
the both 17.4
 
02:47:00.469 --> 02:47:00.479 align:start position:0%
15 year-to-date
 
02:47:04.389 --> 02:47:04.399 align:start position:0%
may plus 14.8
 
02:47:08.070 --> 02:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
and may it up to me is 121.7
 
02:47:09.429 --> 02:47:09.439 align:start position:0%
i think you need to take out the
 
02:47:11.590 --> 02:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
anomalous from receivable
 
02:47:16.950 --> 02:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:20.230 --> 02:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
yes that's not in gas's number oh that's
 
02:47:25.429 --> 02:47:25.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:28.870 --> 02:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
02:47:31.830 --> 02:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
yeah that accounts for the 10 million
 
02:47:31.840 --> 02:47:32.830 align:start position:0%
yeah that accounts for the 10 million
bucks

02:47:32.830 --> 02:47:32.840 align:start position:0%
bucks
 
02:47:40.150 --> 02:47:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:43.590 --> 02:47:43.600 align:start position:0%
thank you melissa welcome
 
02:47:47.510 --> 02:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
down it's down to 127.3 by my
 
02:47:47.520 --> 02:48:06.230 align:start position:0%
down it's down to 127.3 by my
numbers

02:48:06.230 --> 02:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:09.590 --> 02:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
um which is below senate
 
02:48:13.429 --> 02:48:13.439 align:start position:0%
so our who we are we have
 
02:48:26.389 --> 02:48:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:29.750 --> 02:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
and we take out 14.8
 
02:48:34.469 --> 02:48:34.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:38.790 --> 02:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
and we take out the anomalies 15 the 15
 
02:48:41.910 --> 02:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
is on the plan
 
02:48:45.269 --> 02:48:45.279 align:start position:0%
and the plan was 17.4 and so that should
 
02:48:45.279 --> 02:48:46.230 align:start position:0%
and the plan was 17.4 and so that should
be

02:48:46.230 --> 02:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:48:50.150 --> 02:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
15 of 17.4 which would be
 
02:48:56.150 --> 02:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:00.150 --> 02:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
so the 127.8
 
02:49:04.389 --> 02:49:04.399 align:start position:0%
minus the 9.2
 
02:49:04.399 --> 02:49:07.590 align:start position:0%
minus the 9.2
right

02:49:07.590 --> 02:49:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:13.830 --> 02:49:13.840 align:start position:0%
with revenue then we got to add
 
02:49:17.750 --> 02:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
then we got to say okay what's what's uh
 
02:49:21.030 --> 02:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
what was what was june's plan again
 
02:49:26.070 --> 02:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
june's plan was 17 4.
 
02:49:29.110 --> 02:49:29.120 align:start position:0%
so 1 18.6
 
02:49:32.630 --> 02:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
so 17.4 and we said and then
 
02:49:34.550 --> 02:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
melissa what did you say what was that
 
02:49:36.790 --> 02:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
15 how much below
 
02:49:41.190 --> 02:49:41.200 align:start position:0%
plan percentage-wise
 
02:49:46.790 --> 02:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:51.349 --> 02:49:51.359 align:start position:0%
so that means uh yeah call of 14.8
 
02:50:01.550 --> 02:50:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:01.560 --> 02:50:04.870 align:start position:0%
 
33.4

02:50:04.870 --> 02:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:07.990 --> 02:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
so our just to give you a little bit
 
02:50:09.110 --> 02:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
more information
 
02:50:11.110 --> 02:50:11.120 align:start position:0%
um i'm trying to open numbers here but
 
02:50:13.110 --> 02:50:13.120 align:start position:0%
our range for ind
 
02:50:18.230 --> 02:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
is 124 to 132.
 
02:50:20.550 --> 02:50:20.560 align:start position:0%
um so there's definitely room in there
 
02:50:21.990 --> 02:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
if you think the 15
 
02:50:25.349 --> 02:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
is is too low um
 
02:50:29.110 --> 02:50:29.120 align:start position:0%
our high is 132 again
 
02:50:32.630 --> 02:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
for ind with the anomalous
 
02:50:36.309 --> 02:50:36.319 align:start position:0%
anomalous receivable removed
 
02:50:40.790 --> 02:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:45.630 --> 02:50:45.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:50.070 --> 02:50:50.080 align:start position:0%
141 we've uh 0.7 we've got to take
 
02:50:56.950 --> 02:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:59.830 --> 02:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
and they're saying that that they think
 
02:51:04.389 --> 02:51:04.399 align:start position:0%
june is going to come in at 14.8
 
02:51:07.590 --> 02:51:07.600 align:start position:0%
so we then add that uh oh sorry not to
 
02:51:09.590 --> 02:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
the 147. we'd add that to the we're
 
02:51:15.030 --> 02:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:19.830 --> 02:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh we're taking out 9.2
 
02:51:23.750 --> 02:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
we're adding in 15 of
 
02:51:27.190 --> 02:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
on 85 of plan
 
02:51:31.590 --> 02:51:31.600 align:start position:0%
that dra said is 14.8
 
02:51:40.070 --> 02:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:43.269 --> 02:51:43.279 align:start position:0%
the um let me go over that
 
02:51:46.309 --> 02:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
so we have and twenty one point
 
02:51:50.550 --> 02:51:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:52.550 --> 02:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
we removed nine point two million
 
02:51:52.560 --> 02:51:54.230 align:start position:0%
we removed nine point two million
dollars

02:51:54.230 --> 02:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:51:57.269 --> 02:51:57.279 align:start position:0%
because all right 121 yes i'm sorry yes
 
02:52:04.389 --> 02:52:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:07.349 --> 02:52:07.359 align:start position:0%
and then since we're going to reduce the
 
02:52:08.150 --> 02:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
plan by
 
02:52:13.030 --> 02:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
15 we're going to add another 14.8
 
02:52:17.670 --> 02:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
and you add that as 127.3
 
02:52:21.750 --> 02:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
and that ends up
 
02:52:24.950 --> 02:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
right in the middle of what the dra
 
02:52:26.550 --> 02:52:26.560 align:start position:0%
estimate was
 
02:52:30.710 --> 02:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:33.349 --> 02:52:33.359 align:start position:0%
basically the same as how much as our
 
02:52:33.359 --> 02:52:33.990 align:start position:0%
basically the same as how much as our
match

02:52:33.990 --> 02:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
match
 
02:52:41.670 --> 02:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:44.269 --> 02:52:44.279 align:start position:0%
a little bit less yeah a little less
 
02:52:48.550 --> 02:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
127.3 versus 128.8
 
02:52:50.550 --> 02:52:50.560 align:start position:0%
so what can we just stick with our march
 
02:52:50.560 --> 02:52:51.990 align:start position:0%
so what can we just stick with our march
estimates

02:52:51.990 --> 02:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
estimates
 
02:52:52.000 --> 02:52:55.750 align:start position:0%
estimates
yes

02:52:55.750 --> 02:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:02.790 --> 02:53:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:06.070 --> 02:53:06.080 align:start position:0%
and then we can grow or grow that
 
02:53:09.510 --> 02:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
life the five percent i'm going to grow
 
02:53:12.070 --> 02:53:12.080 align:start position:0%
the 120
 
02:53:16.309 --> 02:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:22.309 --> 02:53:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:25.190 --> 02:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
what's that i thought we had to agree to
 
02:53:27.510 --> 02:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
the seven percent for the first year
 
02:53:30.950 --> 02:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
no that was rooms and meals um
 
02:53:33.910 --> 02:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
the senate was using the same median
 
02:53:33.920 --> 02:53:34.950 align:start position:0%
the senate was using the same median
middle

02:53:34.950 --> 02:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
middle
 
02:53:38.309 --> 02:53:38.319 align:start position:0%
uh range which is five percent the first
 
02:53:39.510 --> 02:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
year and then
 
02:53:41.510 --> 02:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
four three percent the second year i'm
 
02:53:41.520 --> 02:53:43.950 align:start position:0%
four three percent the second year i'm
sorry

02:53:43.950 --> 02:53:43.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:43.960 --> 02:53:45.389 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:53:45.389 --> 02:53:45.399 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:53:52.790 --> 02:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
135.3 yep i'm good
 
02:54:01.670 --> 02:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:05.110 --> 02:54:05.120 align:start position:0%
so what we have for
 
02:54:09.510 --> 02:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
fy21 is 128.8
 
02:54:13.429 --> 02:54:13.439 align:start position:0%
22 135.3
 
02:54:20.710 --> 02:54:20.720 align:start position:0%
and 23 139.3 susan
 
02:54:24.550 --> 02:54:24.560 align:start position:0%
what is that reasonable
 
02:54:27.830 --> 02:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
yeah it sounds reasonable to me i think
 
02:54:29.910 --> 02:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
the senate the senate's slightly higher
 
02:54:31.670 --> 02:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
than we are
 
02:54:35.590 --> 02:54:35.600 align:start position:0%
that's all right
 
02:54:38.630 --> 02:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
we had a good discussion we corrected
 
02:54:38.640 --> 02:54:39.750 align:start position:0%
we had a good discussion we corrected
the

02:54:39.750 --> 02:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:54:42.309 --> 02:54:42.319 align:start position:0%
we had people help steer us in the right
 
02:54:42.319 --> 02:54:43.429 align:start position:0%
we had people help steer us in the right
path

02:54:43.429 --> 02:54:43.439 align:start position:0%
path
 
02:54:46.830 --> 02:54:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:50.469 --> 02:54:50.479 align:start position:0%
um who can we go with this
 
02:54:52.230 --> 02:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
who who objects to going with these
 
02:54:52.240 --> 02:54:53.670 align:start position:0%
who who objects to going with these
numbers

02:54:53.670 --> 02:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
02:54:58.429 --> 02:54:58.439 align:start position:0%
then we will go with 128.8 for 20 21
 
02:55:01.510 --> 02:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
135.3 for 22 and then
 
02:55:05.269 --> 02:55:05.279 align:start position:0%
for 23 for inds
 
02:55:08.389 --> 02:55:08.399 align:start position:0%
the next dra number is for
 
02:55:08.399 --> 02:55:10.309 align:start position:0%
the next dra number is for
communications

02:55:10.309 --> 02:55:10.319 align:start position:0%
communications
 
02:55:14.150 --> 02:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
wasn't it 127 3 for 21
 
02:55:17.670 --> 02:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
it was but they kept the number we had
 
02:55:19.670 --> 02:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
in march which is almost the same a
 
02:55:24.790 --> 02:55:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:27.349 --> 02:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
okay so that's what we'll go with for
 
02:55:27.359 --> 02:55:29.510 align:start position:0%
okay so that's what we'll go with for
that

02:55:29.510 --> 02:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:55:32.710 --> 02:55:32.720 align:start position:0%
for communications
 
02:55:36.150 --> 02:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
communications uh so so the senate took
 
02:55:39.110 --> 02:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
um the 39.1 for all three years it was
 
02:55:41.429 --> 02:55:41.439 align:start position:0%
the adjustment that was provided by dra
 
02:55:46.309 --> 02:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:49.030 --> 02:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
and uh and so they had the april numbers
 
02:55:49.040 --> 02:55:49.429 align:start position:0%
and uh and so they had the april numbers
so

02:55:49.429 --> 02:55:49.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:55:51.750 --> 02:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
i'd say we go with the senate numbers
 
02:55:55.190 --> 02:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:00.710 --> 02:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:07.830 --> 02:56:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:10.870 --> 02:56:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh chris will provide us after this is
 
02:56:11.990 --> 02:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
over he'll provide
 
02:56:18.389 --> 02:56:18.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:22.070 --> 02:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
okay so the next um revenue source is
 
02:56:23.990 --> 02:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
the real estate transfer tax
 
02:56:26.790 --> 02:56:26.800 align:start position:0%
yes the 2021 number for the senate was
 
02:56:28.309 --> 02:56:28.319 align:start position:0%
204 million
 
02:56:30.150 --> 02:56:30.160 align:start position:0%
which was an uh 10 million dollar
 
02:56:31.830 --> 02:56:31.840 align:start position:0%
increase over the house weighs in means
 
02:56:34.230 --> 02:56:34.240 align:start position:0%
of 194.
 
02:56:37.469 --> 02:56:37.479 align:start position:0%
they dropped to 197 8 and 22 and then to
 
02:56:40.150 --> 02:56:40.160 align:start position:0%
181.9 and 23.
 
02:56:43.190 --> 02:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
there was some discussion that the um
 
02:56:46.070 --> 02:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
the real estate sales will continue to
 
02:56:47.750 --> 02:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
be strong at least in the first half of
 
02:56:49.190 --> 02:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
the next year
 
02:56:51.750 --> 02:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
um and then it'll start to slow down and
 
02:56:51.760 --> 02:56:52.790 align:start position:0%
um and then it'll start to slow down and
and

02:56:52.790 --> 02:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:56:59.429 --> 02:56:59.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:02.469 --> 02:57:02.479 align:start position:0%
yeah they took off 3
 
02:57:11.990 --> 02:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:14.230 --> 02:57:14.240 align:start position:0%
and we took off a little bit more but
 
02:57:17.309 --> 02:57:17.319 align:start position:0%
evenly divided pretty much
 
02:57:25.510 --> 02:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:27.590 --> 02:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
hey there's a base here can we start
 
02:57:29.590 --> 02:57:29.600 align:start position:0%
with the base year
 
02:57:33.750 --> 02:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
on fy21 go ahead representative
 
02:57:37.910 --> 02:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
right may actual was 183.5
 
02:57:40.550 --> 02:57:40.560 align:start position:0%
minus the 0.2 adjustment i think it was
 
02:57:40.560 --> 02:57:41.349 align:start position:0%
minus the 0.2 adjustment i think it was
0.2

02:57:41.349 --> 02:57:41.359 align:start position:0%
0.2
 
02:57:45.190 --> 02:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
yep uh yep 0.2
 
02:57:49.990 --> 02:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
so so through may it's 183.3
 
02:57:54.150 --> 02:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
now may we're at 15.5
 
02:57:57.349 --> 02:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
uh red revenue
 
02:58:00.150 --> 02:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
so that would bring us up to 198.8 if we
 
02:58:02.309 --> 02:58:02.319 align:start position:0%
replicated may
 
02:58:05.349 --> 02:58:05.359 align:start position:0%
but that's 5.2 million below the senate
 
02:58:06.230 --> 02:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
space so
 
02:58:10.070 --> 02:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
the question is again like the others
 
02:58:13.590 --> 02:58:13.600 align:start position:0%
what do we think may is going to do so
 
02:58:17.349 --> 02:58:17.359 align:start position:0%
uh and i'm not sure what may's plan was
 
02:58:19.190 --> 02:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
um but on this one i don't know if plan
 
02:58:21.190 --> 02:58:21.200 align:start position:0%
really makes any difference because it's
 
02:58:21.200 --> 02:58:21.510 align:start position:0%
really makes any difference because it's
been

02:58:21.510 --> 02:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
been
 
02:58:25.750 --> 02:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
you know so much higher uh
 
02:58:29.670 --> 02:58:29.680 align:start position:0%
but again if we i i'm starting to sense
 
02:58:31.190 --> 02:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
a little slowing i
 
02:58:32.490 --> 02:58:32.500 align:start position:0%
i don't know um
 
02:58:32.500 --> 02:58:34.870 align:start position:0%
i don't know um
[Music]

02:58:34.870 --> 02:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:58:36.950 --> 02:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
in my town i knew anyway i mean it's so
 
02:58:38.070 --> 02:58:38.080 align:start position:0%
anecdotal it doesn't
 
02:58:40.389 --> 02:58:40.399 align:start position:0%
i shouldn't even say it but you know we
 
02:58:42.309 --> 02:58:42.319 align:start position:0%
we have a magazine that comes out with
 
02:58:44.469 --> 02:58:44.479 align:start position:0%
the sales for the month and it was it
 
02:58:46.150 --> 02:58:46.160 align:start position:0%
was stacked about
 
02:58:47.910 --> 02:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
six months ago was like a whole page
 
02:58:49.990 --> 02:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
worth there were only three sales in my
 
02:58:50.870 --> 02:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
town last year
 
02:58:54.070 --> 02:58:54.080 align:start position:0%
last month um which got me a little
 
02:58:54.080 --> 02:58:54.550 align:start position:0%
last month um which got me a little
nervous

02:58:54.550 --> 02:58:54.560 align:start position:0%
nervous
 
02:58:57.750 --> 02:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
that you know so but anyway even if we
 
02:58:58.710 --> 02:58:58.720 align:start position:0%
say may
 
02:59:02.230 --> 02:59:02.240 align:start position:0%
and we say june is equivalent to may
 
02:59:05.429 --> 02:59:05.439 align:start position:0%
in terms of red uh although we're in
 
02:59:07.429 --> 02:59:07.439 align:start position:0%
is i forget is there a delay is there a
 
02:59:08.870 --> 02:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
delay of a month in this on this
 
02:59:10.070 --> 02:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
reporting of this one
 
02:59:13.349 --> 02:59:13.359 align:start position:0%
as well yes yep right we are going into
 
02:59:15.910 --> 02:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
the buying and selling season
 
02:59:19.110 --> 02:59:19.120 align:start position:0%
so i would imagine that um june
 
02:59:22.309 --> 02:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
could be higher so so i
 
02:59:27.030 --> 02:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know we're at 183.3 if we stayed
 
02:59:27.990 --> 02:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
with may's number
 
02:59:30.710 --> 02:59:30.720 align:start position:0%
that would put us at 198.8 then it's
 
02:59:33.190 --> 02:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
five point is that 204.
 
02:59:37.190 --> 02:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
so do we feel that we feel that may is
 
02:59:38.150 --> 02:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
02:59:41.269 --> 02:59:41.279 align:start position:0%
uh 20 million point seven
 
02:59:43.349 --> 02:59:43.359 align:start position:0%
questions when we compare ourselves to
 
02:59:49.750 --> 02:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:53.190 --> 02:59:53.200 align:start position:0%
okay represent
 
02:59:55.830 --> 02:59:55.840 align:start position:0%
just anecdotally in charlestown for
 
02:59:57.349 --> 02:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
weeks there's been exactly
 
03:00:00.790 --> 03:00:00.800 align:start position:0%
one house on the market and one lot
 
03:00:02.870 --> 03:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh yesterday a second house came on this
 
03:00:03.990 --> 03:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
has been
 
03:00:06.469 --> 03:00:06.479 align:start position:0%
a trend for a couple of months now that
 
03:00:07.990 --> 03:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
inventory has really dropped
 
03:00:10.150 --> 03:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
dramatically so prices are up but
 
03:00:13.830 --> 03:00:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:19.990 --> 03:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:21.990 --> 03:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
yeah there we go interesting
 
03:00:23.750 --> 03:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
conversation in hudson
 
03:00:26.230 --> 03:00:26.240 align:start position:0%
which is you know like like you are norm
 
03:00:27.429 --> 03:00:27.439 align:start position:0%
we're on the
 
03:00:30.790 --> 03:00:30.800 align:start position:0%
so-called golden triangle of the
 
03:00:34.230 --> 03:00:34.240 align:start position:0%
decade ago our sales are
 
03:00:38.550 --> 03:00:38.560 align:start position:0%
down houses on the market are existing
 
03:00:38.560 --> 03:00:39.429 align:start position:0%
down houses on the market are existing
houses

03:00:39.429 --> 03:00:39.439 align:start position:0%
houses
 
03:00:41.510 --> 03:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
and we only have one new plan
 
03:00:41.520 --> 03:00:42.469 align:start position:0%
and we only have one new plan
development

03:00:42.469 --> 03:00:42.479 align:start position:0%
development
 
03:00:46.389 --> 03:00:46.399 align:start position:0%
only one and that's only going to be
 
03:00:51.190 --> 03:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
five houses okay we want to
 
03:00:54.950 --> 03:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
get fy2021
 
03:00:58.710 --> 03:00:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:02.230 --> 03:01:02.240 align:start position:0%
thank you on we i
 
03:01:05.990 --> 03:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
am going by the newspaper index
 
03:01:09.670 --> 03:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
at this point on we had been having
 
03:01:13.590 --> 03:01:13.600 align:start position:0%
until mid-may i think we'd been having
 
03:01:16.630 --> 03:01:16.640 align:start position:0%
on two to
 
03:01:19.429 --> 03:01:19.439 align:start position:0%
we've been having four pages of closely
 
03:01:19.439 --> 03:01:20.389 align:start position:0%
we've been having four pages of closely
packed

03:01:20.389 --> 03:01:20.399 align:start position:0%
packed
 
03:01:23.510 --> 03:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
house photographs for sale
 
03:01:25.750 --> 03:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
in the emperor valley and we we are a
 
03:01:26.950 --> 03:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
center of things
 
03:01:28.550 --> 03:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
and we are going to be producing a lot
 
03:01:30.309 --> 03:01:30.319 align:start position:0%
of housing later but
 
03:01:32.790 --> 03:01:32.800 align:start position:0%
uh it's not going to be started until
 
03:01:34.710 --> 03:01:34.720 align:start position:0%
next year on
 
03:01:38.070 --> 03:01:38.080 align:start position:0%
and last weekend
 
03:01:41.110 --> 03:01:41.120 align:start position:0%
on the day that the housing ads come
 
03:01:44.710 --> 03:01:44.720 align:start position:0%
there were two pages of large pictures
 
03:01:47.269 --> 03:01:47.279 align:start position:0%
of houses that is i think it was
 
03:01:49.590 --> 03:01:49.600 align:start position:0%
something like 10 houses for the whole
 
03:01:53.269 --> 03:01:53.279 align:start position:0%
upper valley area that were for sale
 
03:01:55.510 --> 03:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
and they were for sale for huge amounts
 
03:01:59.830 --> 03:01:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:03.269 --> 03:02:03.279 align:start position:0%
okay the
 
03:02:07.910 --> 03:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
revenue for fy21 ends
 
03:02:11.349 --> 03:02:11.359 align:start position:0%
june 30th revenue collected in june
 
03:02:14.469 --> 03:02:14.479 align:start position:0%
is primarily what was actually collected
 
03:02:16.309 --> 03:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
in may so
 
03:02:16.319 --> 03:02:19.990 align:start position:0%
in may so
essentially

03:02:19.990 --> 03:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:22.630 --> 03:02:22.640 align:start position:0%
we need to collect that information and
 
03:02:23.269 --> 03:02:23.279 align:start position:0%
how much
 
03:02:28.469 --> 03:02:28.479 align:start position:0%
is coming in and so far
 
03:02:34.630 --> 03:02:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:36.840 --> 03:02:36.850 align:start position:0%
sure so um for
 
03:02:36.850 --> 03:02:38.389 align:start position:0%
sure so um for
[Music]

03:02:38.389 --> 03:02:38.399 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:02:41.590 --> 03:02:41.600 align:start position:0%
for our estimates we have 201.5
 
03:02:45.910 --> 03:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
to 205.7 that is with
 
03:02:49.110 --> 03:02:49.120 align:start position:0%
june coming in on the low end
 
03:02:52.630 --> 03:02:52.640 align:start position:0%
20 above plan and on the high
 
03:02:57.269 --> 03:02:57.279 align:start position:0%
end 35 percent above plan
 
03:03:01.349 --> 03:03:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:04.550 --> 03:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
for the month is 15 million for june
 
03:03:10.150 --> 03:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:13.030 --> 03:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
20 above plan would be it add another
 
03:03:15.349 --> 03:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
three percent
 
03:03:19.269 --> 03:03:19.279 align:start position:0%
uh another three million
 
03:03:25.429 --> 03:03:25.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:28.950 --> 03:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
so do we want to uh split it
 
03:03:33.830 --> 03:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:37.269 --> 03:03:37.279 align:start position:0%
let's say the difference is four 1.5
 
03:03:38.950 --> 03:03:38.960 align:start position:0%
sounds right on
 
03:03:38.960 --> 03:03:42.070 align:start position:0%
sounds right on
201.5

03:03:42.070 --> 03:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:46.550 --> 03:03:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:52.070 --> 03:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
so we the suggestion is 201.5 and
 
03:03:57.349 --> 03:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:58.790 --> 03:03:58.800 align:start position:0%
represent only did you have another
 
03:04:00.630 --> 03:04:00.640 align:start position:0%
suggestion oh
 
03:04:03.510 --> 03:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
sorry no i just said i wouldn't go above
 
03:04:04.389 --> 03:04:04.399 align:start position:0%
that one but
 
03:04:07.429 --> 03:04:07.439 align:start position:0%
okay no it's okay then uh
 
03:04:10.469 --> 03:04:10.479 align:start position:0%
we all okay with 201.5 i don't see any
 
03:04:11.910 --> 03:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
hands raised
 
03:04:13.910 --> 03:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
that's probably a good number so we
 
03:04:15.630 --> 03:04:15.640 align:start position:0%
that's a good number for
 
03:04:15.640 --> 03:04:18.710 align:start position:0%
that's a good number for
2021.

03:04:18.710 --> 03:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:22.790 --> 03:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
now we go to 20 22.
 
03:04:26.550 --> 03:04:26.560 align:start position:0%
and the dra estimates
 
03:04:29.750 --> 03:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
it'll drop seven
 
03:04:32.389 --> 03:04:32.399 align:start position:0%
their estimate range from uh minus seven
 
03:04:34.790 --> 03:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
percent drop to minus two percent drop
 
03:04:34.800 --> 03:04:35.349 align:start position:0%
percent drop to minus two percent drop
for

03:04:35.349 --> 03:04:35.359 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:04:43.510 --> 03:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:47.190 --> 03:04:47.200 align:start position:0%
and a a two percent drop
 
03:04:52.190 --> 03:04:52.200 align:start position:0%
essentially it would be 1
 
03:04:55.190 --> 03:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
97.5 a
 
03:05:05.830 --> 03:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
7 drop
 
03:05:07.750 --> 03:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
somebody wrote a calculator because it
 
03:05:13.870 --> 03:05:13.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:17.429 --> 03:05:17.439 align:start position:0%
183.6 or 0.64 so i'll call it six or
 
03:05:17.439 --> 03:05:20.790 align:start position:0%
183.6 or 0.64 so i'll call it six or
seven

03:05:20.790 --> 03:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:25.510 --> 03:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:25.520 --> 03:05:29.670 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:05:29.670 --> 03:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:38.870 --> 03:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:48.950 --> 03:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:51.429 --> 03:05:51.439 align:start position:0%
do we want to go and the difference is
 
03:05:58.830 --> 03:05:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:04.469 --> 03:06:04.479 align:start position:0%
before take the 2021 and reduce it by
 
03:06:06.389 --> 03:06:06.399 align:start position:0%
four and a half percent yeah that's the
 
03:06:06.399 --> 03:06:08.150 align:start position:0%
four and a half percent yeah that's the
midpoint

03:06:08.150 --> 03:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
midpoint
 
03:06:10.150 --> 03:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm okay with the midpoint
 
03:06:11.750 --> 03:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
reduction okay
 
03:06:15.429 --> 03:06:15.439 align:start position:0%
the guy with a calculator
 
03:06:17.590 --> 03:06:17.600 align:start position:0%
oh what was it four and a half percent
 
03:06:17.600 --> 03:06:19.070 align:start position:0%
oh what was it four and a half percent
yep

03:06:19.070 --> 03:06:19.080 align:start position:0%
yep
 
03:06:24.230 --> 03:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
192.2 all right allen you're faster
 
03:06:27.429 --> 03:06:27.439 align:start position:0%
okay and then to 23
 
03:06:31.750 --> 03:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
23 the estimators dropped
 
03:06:35.510 --> 03:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
minus 10 minus 8. so
 
03:06:45.030 --> 03:06:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:59.910 --> 03:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:02.870 --> 03:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i think we really you have
 
03:07:05.269 --> 03:07:05.279 align:start position:0%
to anticipate something like this
 
03:07:07.349 --> 03:07:07.359 align:start position:0%
the price of new housing is going
 
03:07:09.110 --> 03:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
through the roof it's going to take a
 
03:07:11.910 --> 03:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
while before they figure out how to
 
03:07:13.830 --> 03:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
if we ever do figure out how to make
 
03:07:15.990 --> 03:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
housing slightly more affordable again
 
03:07:17.910 --> 03:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
to anybody
 
03:07:20.469 --> 03:07:20.479 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if all of the big
 
03:07:22.550 --> 03:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
projects that are being planned
 
03:07:25.590 --> 03:07:25.600 align:start position:0%
so they're needed by uh businesses
 
03:07:28.630 --> 03:07:28.640 align:start position:0%
and in our town are going to to
 
03:07:32.389 --> 03:07:32.399 align:start position:0%
be built given how much the cost of
 
03:07:36.230 --> 03:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
construction is going up okay
 
03:07:40.910 --> 03:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
what we have is we have for fy 2021
 
03:07:43.990 --> 03:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
201.5 million dollars
 
03:07:46.389 --> 03:07:46.399 align:start position:0%
fy22 we dropped by four and a half
 
03:07:49.710 --> 03:07:49.720 align:start position:0%
percent to 192.2
 
03:07:55.830 --> 03:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
fy23 we dropped by 9 to 174.9
 
03:07:59.190 --> 03:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
seems right those are still those are
 
03:08:01.190 --> 03:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
above what our original estimates were
 
03:08:04.230 --> 03:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
so they're they're below the senate but
 
03:08:08.070 --> 03:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:10.150 --> 03:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
the housing market did hold up for a
 
03:08:12.150 --> 03:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
while but it really seems to be hitting
 
03:08:12.870 --> 03:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
them i
 
03:08:16.309 --> 03:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
don't see anybody chafing at the bit to
 
03:08:18.150 --> 03:08:18.160 align:start position:0%
disagree with us
 
03:08:21.429 --> 03:08:21.439 align:start position:0%
so we're going to go with that the next
 
03:08:25.720 --> 03:08:25.730 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:25.730 --> 03:08:26.790 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:08:26.790 --> 03:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:08:32.830 --> 03:08:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:32.840 --> 03:08:34.950 align:start position:0%
 
chris

03:08:34.950 --> 03:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
chris
 
03:08:36.870 --> 03:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
i guess i was muted yeah utility
 
03:08:38.710 --> 03:08:38.720 align:start position:0%
property tax again it's a number that
 
03:08:39.830 --> 03:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
dra provided
 
03:08:43.030 --> 03:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
it's the 40.6 um for all three years
 
03:08:44.870 --> 03:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
again there's not a lot of activity or a
 
03:08:46.550 --> 03:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
lot of change with that
 
03:08:48.750 --> 03:08:48.760 align:start position:0%
when they came into the house it was
 
03:08:51.590 --> 03:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
42.3 for all three years
 
03:08:53.670 --> 03:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
so they had the benefit of an additional
 
03:08:55.030 --> 03:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
completed month
 
03:08:57.110 --> 03:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
so and saw that it was trending downward
 
03:08:58.870 --> 03:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
does anybody have a problem we go over
 
03:08:58.880 --> 03:08:59.990 align:start position:0%
does anybody have a problem we go over
the

03:08:59.990 --> 03:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:09:03.750 --> 03:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
latest dra estimates of one
 
03:09:08.469 --> 03:09:08.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:13.030 --> 03:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:16.469 --> 03:09:16.479 align:start position:0%
the statewide property tax that's
 
03:09:21.510 --> 03:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
that's set in law yep set to 363.1
 
03:09:24.550 --> 03:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
um so we can't change that
 
03:09:27.830 --> 03:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
medicaid recovers
 
03:09:29.990 --> 03:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
that is there's no change from the house
 
03:09:31.830 --> 03:09:31.840 align:start position:0%
um estimates that were provided by the
 
03:09:34.710 --> 03:09:34.720 align:start position:0%
agency so they're still at 3.3 and 2.7
 
03:09:38.389 --> 03:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
2.5 um
 
03:09:41.830 --> 03:09:41.840 align:start position:0%
so dras everything that they would in on
 
03:09:44.389 --> 03:09:44.399 align:start position:0%
discussed so what's left is just the
 
03:09:45.990 --> 03:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
what i would call the other agency
 
03:09:47.349 --> 03:09:47.359 align:start position:0%
revenues and i can
 
03:09:49.030 --> 03:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
go through those relatively quickly if
 
03:09:50.550 --> 03:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
you would like
 
03:09:53.670 --> 03:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
that i would so
 
03:09:56.630 --> 03:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
we just did medicaid recoveries um i'll
 
03:09:58.469 --> 03:09:58.479 align:start position:0%
take you up to tobacco settlement
 
03:10:01.030 --> 03:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
the 47.8 million is what actually came
 
03:10:01.750 --> 03:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
in the door
 
03:10:05.030 --> 03:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
for 21 in april
 
03:10:07.429 --> 03:10:07.439 align:start position:0%
um there was no change to the estimates
 
03:10:08.469 --> 03:10:08.479 align:start position:0%
in 22 or
 
03:10:11.590 --> 03:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
23. the department of justice still goes
 
03:10:12.790 --> 03:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
with the thirty point
 
03:10:14.469 --> 03:10:14.479 align:start position:0%
thirty eight point two and the thirty
 
03:10:15.830 --> 03:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
six point three million
 
03:10:17.990 --> 03:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
in twenty two and twenty three respects
 
03:10:20.309 --> 03:10:20.319 align:start position:0%
we'll take the senate numbers for the
 
03:10:23.590 --> 03:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:26.389 --> 03:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
uh lottery revenue the agency came into
 
03:10:26.399 --> 03:10:26.870 align:start position:0%
uh lottery revenue the agency came into
senate

03:10:26.870 --> 03:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
senate
 
03:10:30.150 --> 03:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
and bumped their 21
 
03:10:33.510 --> 03:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
estimate up to 128
 
03:10:35.190 --> 03:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
from what they had been estimating to be
 
03:10:36.950 --> 03:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
around 120
 
03:10:40.150 --> 03:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
and then in 22 and 23 they kept their
 
03:10:43.830 --> 03:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
estimates the same at 125 and 127.5
 
03:10:46.950 --> 03:10:46.960 align:start position:0%
i'll note here that the house had an
 
03:10:49.990 --> 03:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
estimate of 130.6 and that was based on
 
03:10:51.190 --> 03:10:51.200 align:start position:0%
what had come in the door
 
03:10:52.870 --> 03:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
at that point and trending it out with
 
03:10:55.110 --> 03:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
plan going forward
 
03:10:58.070 --> 03:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
and you're probably going to be really
 
03:11:01.510 --> 03:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:04.550 --> 03:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:09.269 --> 03:11:09.279 align:start position:0%
so the only difference is in the 21
 
03:11:13.110 --> 03:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
number we're done yep
 
03:11:15.990 --> 03:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
so so again senate senate ways and means
 
03:11:18.870 --> 03:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
took the agency's estimate of 128
 
03:11:21.030 --> 03:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
which came up from 120 that they had
 
03:11:22.710 --> 03:11:22.720 align:start position:0%
provided to the house ways and means
 
03:11:24.309 --> 03:11:24.319 align:start position:0%
house ways and means
 
03:11:26.710 --> 03:11:26.720 align:start position:0%
um trending the the revenue out for the
 
03:11:27.830 --> 03:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
rest of the year
 
03:11:33.429 --> 03:11:33.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:37.269 --> 03:11:37.279 align:start position:0%
no i think we keep on 130.6
 
03:11:40.790 --> 03:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
expresses right okay we'll keep our
 
03:11:40.800 --> 03:11:42.950 align:start position:0%
expresses right okay we'll keep our
numbers

03:11:42.950 --> 03:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
03:11:48.229 --> 03:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
any problems with that good the next one
 
03:11:51.269 --> 03:11:51.279 align:start position:0%
um the next one is the other revenue
 
03:11:53.590 --> 03:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
so the agency came down uh came down on
 
03:11:54.630 --> 03:11:54.640 align:start position:0%
their estimates in
 
03:11:57.670 --> 03:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
um all three years 22
 
03:12:00.790 --> 03:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
21 22 and 23 and the
 
03:12:03.030 --> 03:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
um senate ways and means accepted those
 
03:12:03.040 --> 03:12:04.070 align:start position:0%
um senate ways and means accepted those
adjustments

03:12:04.070 --> 03:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
adjustments
 
03:12:07.190 --> 03:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
did they give any reason why uh just the
 
03:12:09.190 --> 03:12:09.200 align:start position:0%
year to date the trending in some of the
 
03:12:11.990 --> 03:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
transfers from the agencies that that
 
03:12:13.510 --> 03:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
the revenue source has come from
 
03:12:15.510 --> 03:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
have been down but they didn't have one
 
03:12:18.150 --> 03:12:18.160 align:start position:0%
specific reason
 
03:12:21.349 --> 03:12:21.359 align:start position:0%
as to why it was trending downward so we
 
03:12:24.150 --> 03:12:24.160 align:start position:0%
go with the agency's numbers
 
03:12:28.150 --> 03:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:35.590 --> 03:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:38.229 --> 03:12:38.239 align:start position:0%
the beer tax there was no difference
 
03:12:39.510 --> 03:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
from where the house was with the
 
03:12:40.630 --> 03:12:40.640 align:start position:0%
estimates the
 
03:12:43.269 --> 03:12:43.279 align:start position:0%
still 13.2 for all three years the same
 
03:12:44.710 --> 03:12:44.720 align:start position:0%
way with the securities
 
03:12:46.710 --> 03:12:46.720 align:start position:0%
exactly there was no change in the um
 
03:12:48.630 --> 03:12:48.640 align:start position:0%
agency's estimates the same as what they
 
03:12:49.750 --> 03:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
provided the house
 
03:12:54.229 --> 03:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
they're called fines and keys there's uh
 
03:12:57.510 --> 03:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
a slight adjustment um in the
 
03:13:00.550 --> 03:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
22 and in 23 but
 
03:13:03.269 --> 03:13:03.279 align:start position:0%
the 21 number remained at the 12.3
 
03:13:03.279 --> 03:13:04.150 align:start position:0%
the 21 number remained at the 12.3
million

03:13:04.150 --> 03:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
million
 
03:13:07.910 --> 03:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
and basically uh donna raymond who
 
03:13:11.030 --> 03:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
who provides the court information
 
03:13:14.229 --> 03:13:14.239 align:start position:0%
just relooked at the numbers and
 
03:13:15.830 --> 03:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
felt that some things were starting to
 
03:13:17.750 --> 03:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
trend in a positive direction where she
 
03:13:17.760 --> 03:13:18.950 align:start position:0%
trend in a positive direction where she
thought

03:13:18.950 --> 03:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
thought
 
03:13:20.070 --> 03:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
it was going to be a little slower in
 
03:13:21.750 --> 03:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
that recovery as the courts opened up
 
03:13:23.429 --> 03:13:23.439 align:start position:0%
and some of the processing has occurred
 
03:13:26.229 --> 03:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
so she anticipated a slight bump up
 
03:13:29.429 --> 03:13:29.439 align:start position:0%
in 22 and then being more normal i guess
 
03:13:31.990 --> 03:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
in 23 with their revenue stream
 
03:13:37.190 --> 03:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
at 13 million so um
 
03:13:40.229 --> 03:13:40.239 align:start position:0%
how's the house members feel
 
03:13:43.349 --> 03:13:43.359 align:start position:0%
on the latest
 
03:13:47.030 --> 03:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
senate numbers based upon
 
03:13:50.550 --> 03:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
historically i'd go along with the court
 
03:13:51.990 --> 03:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
system they have
 
03:13:54.469 --> 03:13:54.479 align:start position:0%
a history in which the senate has always
 
03:13:56.710 --> 03:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
bumped them up to challenge them and
 
03:13:56.720 --> 03:13:57.269 align:start position:0%
bumped them up to challenge them and
then

03:13:57.269 --> 03:13:57.279 align:start position:0%
then
 
03:14:00.150 --> 03:14:00.160 align:start position:0%
they'd come in anyway lower than what
 
03:14:01.670 --> 03:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
the senate had bumped them to
 
03:14:05.030 --> 03:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
so if this if justice is actually
 
03:14:06.630 --> 03:14:06.640 align:start position:0%
volunteering these
 
03:14:08.870 --> 03:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh the court system then i think we
 
03:14:12.070 --> 03:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:14.710 --> 03:14:14.720 align:start position:0%
anybody disagree with that i don't see
 
03:14:17.030 --> 03:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
anybody disagreeing with that
 
03:14:21.110 --> 03:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
so the next one is is insurance
 
03:14:24.150 --> 03:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
so insurance came in at 135 in fiscal
 
03:14:25.670 --> 03:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
year 21
 
03:14:29.110 --> 03:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
and then 130 and 22 and 135 and 23 with
 
03:14:30.630 --> 03:14:30.640 align:start position:0%
the senate weighs in means compared to
 
03:14:30.640 --> 03:14:31.269 align:start position:0%
the senate weighs in means compared to
the

03:14:31.269 --> 03:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:14:36.150 --> 03:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
house position of 130 um 128 and 134
 
03:14:38.710 --> 03:14:38.720 align:start position:0%
and and again they saw better revenue
 
03:14:40.550 --> 03:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
streams in 21 and and
 
03:14:42.309 --> 03:14:42.319 align:start position:0%
as they projected outward that's caused
 
03:14:44.870 --> 03:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
the slight uptick in the out years
 
03:14:48.469 --> 03:14:48.479 align:start position:0%
uh mr chair and chris um do i look at
 
03:14:49.670 --> 03:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
revenue focus
 
03:14:51.990 --> 03:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
as a through the end of may we're
 
03:14:54.389 --> 03:14:54.399 align:start position:0%
already at 1 38
 
03:14:57.429 --> 03:14:57.439 align:start position:0%
with one month left yep
 
03:14:58.710 --> 03:14:58.720 align:start position:0%
what i don't know is if there's going to
 
03:15:01.110 --> 03:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
be any adjustments before the end of the
 
03:15:01.120 --> 03:15:02.950 align:start position:0%
be any adjustments before the end of the
year

03:15:02.950 --> 03:15:02.960 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:15:05.830 --> 03:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
so it may it may trend to be closer to
 
03:15:07.190 --> 03:15:07.200 align:start position:0%
that number but i just don't know if
 
03:15:08.790 --> 03:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
there's an adjustment coming
 
03:15:11.750 --> 03:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
and sure does a good job in their
 
03:15:11.760 --> 03:15:14.309 align:start position:0%
and sure does a good job in their
estimates

03:15:14.309 --> 03:15:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:17.269 --> 03:15:17.279 align:start position:0%
so we're saying let's just accept the
 
03:15:18.710 --> 03:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
latest insurance
 
03:15:22.950 --> 03:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:24.389 --> 03:15:24.399 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm not sure how the refunds work
 
03:15:26.870 --> 03:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
in the insurance so
 
03:15:30.550 --> 03:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
all right i'm okay
 
03:15:32.870 --> 03:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
um so the next one is liquor that's the
 
03:15:34.790 --> 03:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
last one on this page
 
03:15:39.590 --> 03:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:43.389 --> 03:15:43.399 align:start position:0%
um even and then in 22 liquor came in at
 
03:15:43.399 --> 03:15:44.950 align:start position:0%
um even and then in 22 liquor came in at
141.6

03:15:44.950 --> 03:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
141.6
 
03:15:47.990 --> 03:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
and in 23 at 141.2
 
03:15:49.950 --> 03:15:49.960 align:start position:0%
you'll see the senate has a number of
 
03:15:49.960 --> 03:15:51.429 align:start position:0%
you'll see the senate has a number of
137.6

03:15:51.429 --> 03:15:51.439 align:start position:0%
137.6
 
03:15:54.950 --> 03:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
and a number of 137.2 and 22 and 23
 
03:15:54.960 --> 03:15:56.389 align:start position:0%
and a number of 137.2 and 22 and 23
respectively

03:15:56.389 --> 03:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
respectively
 
03:15:59.030 --> 03:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
so as you might remember in fiscal year
 
03:15:59.040 --> 03:15:59.750 align:start position:0%
so as you might remember in fiscal year
21

03:15:59.750 --> 03:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
21
 
03:16:02.229 --> 03:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
there was an 8.2 million dollars
 
03:16:03.990 --> 03:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
transferred from the liquor fund
 
03:16:06.389 --> 03:16:06.399 align:start position:0%
to the granite advantage fund or the
 
03:16:09.510 --> 03:16:09.520 align:start position:0%
medicaid expansion fund
 
03:16:11.750 --> 03:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
back in 2019 there was a piece put in
 
03:16:13.590 --> 03:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
law that said if that fund
 
03:16:16.790 --> 03:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
was projected to have a shortfall that
 
03:16:18.469 --> 03:16:18.479 align:start position:0%
the commissioner
 
03:16:22.150 --> 03:16:22.160 align:start position:0%
of hhs could request a transfer from the
 
03:16:22.870 --> 03:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
liquor fund
 
03:16:26.150 --> 03:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
to make up for that shortfall since that
 
03:16:26.160 --> 03:16:26.790 align:start position:0%
to make up for that shortfall since that
transfer

03:16:26.790 --> 03:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
transfer
 
03:16:28.070 --> 03:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
the department of health and human
 
03:16:29.750 --> 03:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
services has acknowledged that they
 
03:16:32.150 --> 03:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
expect there'll be another transfer need
 
03:16:36.630 --> 03:16:36.640 align:start position:0%
in 22 but they don't know how much
 
03:16:38.710 --> 03:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
they also have they're in the process of
 
03:16:40.630 --> 03:16:40.640 align:start position:0%
renegotiating some of the
 
03:16:42.870 --> 03:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
contracts with the providers and they
 
03:16:44.790 --> 03:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
believe that's going to save some money
 
03:16:48.150 --> 03:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
so they're still unable to provide
 
03:16:50.469 --> 03:16:50.479 align:start position:0%
how much because those those are ongoing
 
03:16:52.389 --> 03:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
negotiations so the senate
 
03:16:54.790 --> 03:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
felt at least conservatively knowing
 
03:16:56.309 --> 03:16:56.319 align:start position:0%
that the department has indicated they
 
03:16:58.630 --> 03:16:58.640 align:start position:0%
anticipate some sort of a transfer in 22
 
03:16:59.910 --> 03:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
and 23
 
03:17:02.229 --> 03:17:02.239 align:start position:0%
to just budget four million dollars less
 
03:17:03.510 --> 03:17:03.520 align:start position:0%
in the liquor fund
 
03:17:05.190 --> 03:17:05.200 align:start position:0%
and assume that that's the amount that
 
03:17:09.030 --> 03:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:12.710 --> 03:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
represented thomas southwood
 
03:17:15.190 --> 03:17:15.200 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair just checking i
 
03:17:17.349 --> 03:17:17.359 align:start position:0%
drive by the new uh liquor store in
 
03:17:17.359 --> 03:17:18.389 align:start position:0%
drive by the new uh liquor store in
epsom

03:17:18.389 --> 03:17:18.399 align:start position:0%
epsom
 
03:17:20.469 --> 03:17:20.479 align:start position:0%
uh and i just wondered did they have a
 
03:17:22.389 --> 03:17:22.399 align:start position:0%
formula for adding that in so now it'll
 
03:17:24.389 --> 03:17:24.399 align:start position:0%
be open the whole month of june
 
03:17:25.990 --> 03:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
and then of course it'll be open for a
 
03:17:27.670 --> 03:17:27.680 align:start position:0%
whole year starting in july
 
03:17:29.349 --> 03:17:29.359 align:start position:0%
i assume they figure that in but i was
 
03:17:30.870 --> 03:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
just curious
 
03:17:34.469 --> 03:17:34.479 align:start position:0%
yeah the um so they they have uh
 
03:17:36.150 --> 03:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
revenue projections for each of their
 
03:17:37.990 --> 03:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
stores um
 
03:17:40.870 --> 03:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
and then when they do a renovation or a
 
03:17:41.910 --> 03:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
new store
 
03:17:43.750 --> 03:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
um they have some sort of an adjustment
 
03:17:45.990 --> 03:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
related to that so there'll be some
 
03:17:47.349 --> 03:17:47.359 align:start position:0%
adjustment downward during the
 
03:17:48.630 --> 03:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
renovations and then they'll have an
 
03:17:50.070 --> 03:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
adjustment going up
 
03:17:53.670 --> 03:17:53.680 align:start position:0%
um after the store opens um
 
03:17:56.309 --> 03:17:56.319 align:start position:0%
the typically um the committee hasn't
 
03:17:56.319 --> 03:17:56.870 align:start position:0%
the typically um the committee hasn't
asked

03:17:56.870 --> 03:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
asked
 
03:17:58.630 --> 03:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
for that information from them but i
 
03:18:00.150 --> 03:18:00.160 align:start position:0%
think they could provide it if you
 
03:18:01.429 --> 03:18:01.439 align:start position:0%
wanted to see it
 
03:18:03.349 --> 03:18:03.359 align:start position:0%
no that's okay i just want to make
 
03:18:05.030 --> 03:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
assume they have a formula so that's
 
03:18:06.550 --> 03:18:06.560 align:start position:0%
taken care of
 
03:18:09.590 --> 03:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
03:18:12.950 --> 03:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
so that go ahead
 
03:18:16.550 --> 03:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
representative thank you so if they took
 
03:18:19.110 --> 03:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
four million off of each year
 
03:18:22.309 --> 03:18:22.319 align:start position:0%
uh then still that's considerably higher
 
03:18:23.510 --> 03:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
still than
 
03:18:27.190 --> 03:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
what we had i think yes
 
03:18:30.389 --> 03:18:30.399 align:start position:0%
so um the liquor commission
 
03:18:32.389 --> 03:18:32.399 align:start position:0%
increased their revenue estimates by a
 
03:18:33.510 --> 03:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
fair amount
 
03:18:37.830 --> 03:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
yes yep and liquor has been doing
 
03:18:41.190 --> 03:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
a good job with their estimates
 
03:18:44.710 --> 03:18:44.720 align:start position:0%
um then
 
03:18:47.590 --> 03:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any questions on any
 
03:18:49.030 --> 03:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
of these that we've
 
03:18:52.469 --> 03:18:52.479 align:start position:0%
gone over because if not and this will
 
03:18:52.479 --> 03:18:53.269 align:start position:0%
gone over because if not and this will
be

03:18:53.269 --> 03:18:53.279 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:18:56.229 --> 03:18:56.239 align:start position:0%
the house ways and means position when
 
03:18:56.950 --> 03:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
we go into
 
03:19:02.870 --> 03:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:04.790 --> 03:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
so rip some major what i'll do is i'll
 
03:19:07.190 --> 03:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
i'll basically take this sheet
 
03:19:09.429 --> 03:19:09.439 align:start position:0%
i'll put in your estimates from today
 
03:19:10.710 --> 03:19:10.720 align:start position:0%
with today's date
 
03:19:13.990 --> 03:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
yes um down here
 
03:19:18.710 --> 03:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
we'll keep i'm going to take out the uh
 
03:19:20.550 --> 03:19:20.560 align:start position:0%
dra auditors because that's not in there
 
03:19:22.870 --> 03:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
at the moment
 
03:19:24.950 --> 03:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
so so that there's no place for that to
 
03:19:24.960 --> 03:19:26.229 align:start position:0%
so so that there's no place for that to
occur

03:19:26.229 --> 03:19:26.239 align:start position:0%
occur
 
03:19:28.150 --> 03:19:28.160 align:start position:0%
right we're going to have to fight for
 
03:19:30.229 --> 03:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
that dra
 
03:19:32.870 --> 03:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
and then we'll add in the the 25 4 and
 
03:19:35.750 --> 03:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
the 44 related to payroll protection
 
03:19:35.760 --> 03:19:39.590 align:start position:0%
the 44 related to payroll protection
um

03:19:39.590 --> 03:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:42.309 --> 03:19:42.319 align:start position:0%
excuse me the d-a-r-r-d-r-a auditors i
 
03:19:43.750 --> 03:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
would leave it to 3 million because that
 
03:19:45.190 --> 03:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
was the house position
 
03:19:47.990 --> 03:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
yes yeah okay that i'm sorry and then i
 
03:19:49.670 --> 03:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
would leave the 20
 
03:19:52.710 --> 03:19:52.720 align:start position:0%
single sales factor delay 20 million
 
03:19:55.429 --> 03:19:55.439 align:start position:0%
here yes because that was the house
 
03:19:55.439 --> 03:19:58.150 align:start position:0%
here yes because that was the house
position

03:19:58.150 --> 03:19:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:01.269 --> 03:20:01.279 align:start position:0%
and i would include the ppp numbers but
 
03:20:02.870 --> 03:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
i would not move over the
 
03:20:05.269 --> 03:20:05.279 align:start position:0%
uh meals and rooms fund or the
 
03:20:06.790 --> 03:20:06.800 align:start position:0%
additional negotiating
 
03:20:09.830 --> 03:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
right right so that takes care of your
 
03:20:12.950 --> 03:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
general fund education trust fund um you
 
03:20:14.950 --> 03:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
do have your highway fund and your
 
03:20:16.389 --> 03:20:16.399 align:start position:0%
fishing game fund i just want to go
 
03:20:17.990 --> 03:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
through that real really quickly with
 
03:20:18.000 --> 03:20:19.030 align:start position:0%
through that real really quickly with
you

03:20:19.030 --> 03:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:20:22.150 --> 03:20:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:25.030 --> 03:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
there's a slight uptick in your highway
 
03:20:25.040 --> 03:20:26.469 align:start position:0%
there's a slight uptick in your highway
funds

03:20:26.469 --> 03:20:26.479 align:start position:0%
funds
 
03:20:29.670 --> 03:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
so there's and it's all in 21 mostly but
 
03:20:33.269 --> 03:20:33.279 align:start position:0%
um so the gas road uh road toll
 
03:20:36.710 --> 03:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
is up by 1.7 million dollars over the
 
03:20:40.550 --> 03:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
house position again um steve lavoy from
 
03:20:42.070 --> 03:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
the department of safety you know as
 
03:20:43.590 --> 03:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
they saw what was happening through
 
03:20:43.600 --> 03:20:44.469 align:start position:0%
they saw what was happening through
april

03:20:44.469 --> 03:20:44.479 align:start position:0%
april
 
03:20:46.150 --> 03:20:46.160 align:start position:0%
um the numbers were a little bit better
 
03:20:47.670 --> 03:20:47.680 align:start position:0%
than they had anticipated when they came
 
03:20:47.680 --> 03:20:48.389 align:start position:0%
than they had anticipated when they came
in

03:20:48.389 --> 03:20:48.399 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:20:49.910 --> 03:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
in the middle of march to discuss it
 
03:20:52.389 --> 03:20:52.399 align:start position:0%
with you for your committee
 
03:20:55.910 --> 03:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
still 16 million under plan yes yeah
 
03:20:55.920 --> 03:20:56.469 align:start position:0%
still 16 million under plan yes yeah
it's

03:20:56.469 --> 03:20:56.479 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:20:58.630 --> 03:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
slightly better it's not um at plan
 
03:20:59.990 --> 03:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
again and then the same with the motor
 
03:21:01.590 --> 03:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
vehicle registrations
 
03:21:04.550 --> 03:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
they saw an uptick in 21 um you know
 
03:21:04.560 --> 03:21:04.870 align:start position:0%
they saw an uptick in 21 um you know
through

03:21:04.870 --> 03:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
through
 
03:21:07.910 --> 03:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
april that suggested that would be
 
03:21:10.870 --> 03:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
you know a little bit higher by the end
 
03:21:12.710 --> 03:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
so you'd see a 2.5 million dollar
 
03:21:13.590 --> 03:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
difference from the
 
03:21:16.630 --> 03:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
the house position um the the
 
03:21:18.630 --> 03:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
miscellaneous revenue doesn't change
 
03:21:20.950 --> 03:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
that's related to stuff that happens
 
03:21:23.590 --> 03:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
with transportation
 
03:21:26.229 --> 03:21:26.239 align:start position:0%
but so so that's um you know again it's
 
03:21:27.830 --> 03:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
a slight uptick but it's not
 
03:21:30.150 --> 03:21:30.160 align:start position:0%
um you know anything crazy but i wanted
 
03:21:33.670 --> 03:21:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:36.070 --> 03:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
and then the fishing game fish and game
 
03:21:37.670 --> 03:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
is even less drastically changed the
 
03:21:39.429 --> 03:21:39.439 align:start position:0%
only change is in their other revenue in
 
03:21:41.269 --> 03:21:41.279 align:start position:0%
21 it's a hundred thousand dollars
 
03:21:41.279 --> 03:21:42.389 align:start position:0%
21 it's a hundred thousand dollars
higher

03:21:42.389 --> 03:21:42.399 align:start position:0%
higher
 
03:21:44.150 --> 03:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
again that was based on what they had
 
03:21:45.590 --> 03:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
received to date through
 
03:21:49.990 --> 03:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
april um so and they felt that the 3.7
 
03:21:52.469 --> 03:21:52.479 align:start position:0%
million was more reflective of what how
 
03:21:54.229 --> 03:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21 would end with their
 
03:21:56.229 --> 03:21:56.239 align:start position:0%
other revenue any questions
 
03:21:58.710 --> 03:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
on the highway fund estimates and the
 
03:22:01.590 --> 03:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
fish and game estimates
 
03:22:04.150 --> 03:22:04.160 align:start position:0%
only will we agree with the senate
 
03:22:04.160 --> 03:22:05.110 align:start position:0%
only will we agree with the senate
estimates

03:22:05.110 --> 03:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
estimates
 
03:22:08.550 --> 03:22:08.560 align:start position:0%
on i might i tried to figure out the
 
03:22:11.590 --> 03:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
21 uh highway fund and
 
03:22:15.510 --> 03:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
came in with within 200 000
 
03:22:19.110 --> 03:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
of them and and just to
 
03:22:21.910 --> 03:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
reiterate that the senate took exactly
 
03:22:23.750 --> 03:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
what the agency provided to them
 
03:22:27.190 --> 03:22:27.200 align:start position:0%
with the um highway fund so we'll take
 
03:22:27.200 --> 03:22:29.190 align:start position:0%
with the um highway fund so we'll take
the

03:22:29.190 --> 03:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:22:32.830 --> 03:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
senate numbers for the highway fund
 
03:22:35.510 --> 03:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
and as you might recall in the email
 
03:22:37.750 --> 03:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
that i sent i had a link in there
 
03:22:39.590 --> 03:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
if you click on that link it should take
 
03:22:41.670 --> 03:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
you to all the various agency documents
 
03:22:43.269 --> 03:22:43.279 align:start position:0%
that were provided to the senate so if
 
03:22:45.510 --> 03:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
you did have an interest in seeing
 
03:22:47.269 --> 03:22:47.279 align:start position:0%
um the narrative that the agency might
 
03:22:49.910 --> 03:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
have provided it would be found there
 
03:22:57.590 --> 03:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:05.269 --> 03:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:09.030 --> 03:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
we'll take the center numbers for the
 
03:23:13.830 --> 03:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:16.870 --> 03:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
any problems if not
 
03:23:19.910 --> 03:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
then that will be our position
 
03:23:26.790 --> 03:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:28.830 --> 03:23:28.840 align:start position:0%

03:23:31.590 --> 03:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
