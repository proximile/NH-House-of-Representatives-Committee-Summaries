00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
and it had to do with the spending cap
 
00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
and the folks in in the city of
 
00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:40.639 align:start position:0%
nashville were very concerned about the
 
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
the spending and
 
00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
in their minds it appeared to be out of
 
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.550 align:start position:0%
in their minds it appeared to be out of
control

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
control
 
00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
and so they came up with a referendum
 
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
and it was voted for uh in in the in the
 
00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
form of a spending cap
 
00:06:56.469 --> 00:06:56.479 align:start position:0%
and uh over the years it was it was
 
00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
honored and it seemed to be working
 
00:06:59.430 --> 00:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
pretty well
 
00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
um there were some
 
00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
legislators in i think it was in 2011 i
 
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
think in the senate that
 
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
uh wanted to reinforce it uh statewide
 
00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:09.919 align:start position:0%
because there's some people that have
 
00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
tax cap some people have spending caps
 
00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:13.759 align:start position:0%
we have a spending cap
 
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
and in the process of uh
 
00:07:19.749 --> 00:07:19.759 align:start position:0%
trying to reaffirm what has been done
 
00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
uh there there were some
 
00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
in some people's minds some errors that
 
00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
were made and it uh it basically caused
 
00:07:27.189 --> 00:07:27.199 align:start position:0%
some trouble
 
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
for the spending cap
 
00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:30.639 align:start position:0%
you know uh one of the things about
 
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
referendums is they're they really are a
 
00:07:35.189 --> 00:07:35.199 align:start position:0%
pure form of democracy
 
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
you know and when the people uh get
 
00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
together in in a town or in a city
 
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
a municipality anywhere and they put
 
00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
something uh with the intent for it to
 
00:07:46.629 --> 00:07:46.639 align:start position:0%
be enforced uh that is the purest form
 
00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
of democracy and it passed
 
00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:49.990 align:start position:0%
of democracy and it passed
um

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
not everybody in town is an attorney and
 
00:07:53.909 --> 00:07:53.919 align:start position:0%
not everybody uh
 
00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
basically uh is a professional
 
00:07:59.029 --> 00:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
politician or whatever but uh
 
00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:01.360 align:start position:0%
they all did vote for this bill
 
00:08:03.189 --> 00:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
and it did pass when i say all i mean
 
00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
the majority
 
00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:05.749 align:start position:0%
the majority
um

00:08:05.749 --> 00:08:05.759 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
so the purpose of sb52 is basically to
 
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:11.120 align:start position:0%
reckon uh rectify an inconsistency with
 
00:08:15.029 --> 00:08:15.039 align:start position:0%
rsa 49c 33 the
 
00:08:16.869 --> 00:08:16.879 align:start position:0%
statute that states a framework for the
 
00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
city's establishing a tax or expending
 
00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.390 align:start position:0%
city's establishing a tax or expending
cap

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
cap
 
00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.070 align:start position:0%
cap
the

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:21.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies involve two words and
 
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
this is where the rub is it's override
 
00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:28.160 align:start position:0%
and exclusion
 
00:08:30.309 --> 00:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
and basically to summarize everything uh
 
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
the supreme court reviewed this uh
 
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
recently because of uh
 
00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:35.750 align:start position:0%
recently because of uh
alderman

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
alderman
 
00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:38.240 align:start position:0%
former alderman jan moriarty fred t
 
00:08:41.029 --> 00:08:41.039 align:start position:0%
boone and paula johnson
 
00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
who basically uh were very vocal that
 
00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
the the spirit of the spending cap
 
00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
wasn't uh
 
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
being honored
 
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
to present date so they brought it to
 
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
the supreme court supreme court said it
 
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
can't be
 
00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
enforced because of these two words
 
00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:57.680 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:08:59.350 --> 00:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
with direction of the of the supreme
 
00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.310 align:start position:0%
with direction of the of the supreme
court

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
and and senate council we redrafted the
 
00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
as as you see as amended and we passed
 
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
it in the legislature
 
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
in the senate
 
00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:12.320 align:start position:0%
and basically
 
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:14.320 align:start position:0%
the ultimate reason we've done this is
 
00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
because people are concerned
 
00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:18.320 align:start position:0%
that the spending cap is not being
 
00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.430 align:start position:0%
that the spending cap is not being
honored

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
honored
 
00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
and so this reinforces it and we're
 
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
hoping that you basically see it the
 
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:52.550 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:54.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:09:55.829 --> 00:09:55.839 align:start position:0%
uh thank you senator for taking my
 
00:09:55.839 --> 00:09:56.870 align:start position:0%
uh thank you senator for taking my
question

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.310 align:start position:0%
question
uh

00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
how does this change
 
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
uh well
 
00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:08.080 align:start position:0%
are you looking at the uh the amended
 
00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.030 align:start position:0%
are you looking at the uh the amended
bill

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
yes i am okay there's the the new
 
00:10:13.269 --> 00:10:13.279 align:start position:0%
language and the amended bill
 
00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:14.230 align:start position:0%
language and the amended bill
that

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:14.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:16.240 align:start position:0%
you'll see on line 15
 
00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.190 align:start position:0%
you'll see on line 15
um

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:17.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
principal payments or municipal bonds
 
00:10:21.269 --> 00:10:21.279 align:start position:0%
debts capital expenditures which shall
 
00:10:21.279 --> 00:10:22.310 align:start position:0%
debts capital expenditures which shall
be

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
by a supermajority vote as determined in
 
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
the charter
 
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
an ordinance and according to practice
 
00:10:31.509 --> 00:10:31.519 align:start position:0%
that redistributes equitable budget
 
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
excludable budget pardon me
 
00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
items from within the limits of the cap
 
00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
budget to outside limits of the cap
 
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
budget shall be by a super majority vote
 
00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:44.240 align:start position:0%
as determined
 
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:46.720 align:start position:0%
in the charter i think that basically is
 
00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:47.430 align:start position:0%
in the charter i think that basically is
is

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:10:51.269 --> 00:10:51.279 align:start position:0%
the principal line uh also in uh line 29
 
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry 28
 
00:10:54.949 --> 00:10:54.959 align:start position:0%
you'll see the new language uh involved
 
00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:56.240 align:start position:0%
or interest in
 
00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
principal payments municipal bonds debts
 
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
capital expenditures which shall be by a
 
00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:03.200 align:start position:0%
super majority vote as determined in the
 
00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.710 align:start position:0%
super majority vote as determined in the
charter

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:04.720 align:start position:0%
charter
 
00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
an ordinance or accounting practices
 
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
that redis distributes excludable budget
 
00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
items from within the limits
 
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
of the cap budget to outside limits cap
 
00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
shall be by a super majority so
 
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
basically it's not saying that they they
 
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
can't but it has to be done by a super
 
00:11:22.949 --> 00:11:22.959 align:start position:0%
majority if they're going to override or
 
00:11:25.269 --> 00:11:25.279 align:start position:0%
the budget and it just reinforces
 
00:11:25.279 --> 00:11:26.230 align:start position:0%
the budget and it just reinforces
that

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:26.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:28.640 align:start position:0%
uh the the rob was is that when when
 
00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
fred t boom and dan moriarty brought
 
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
this to the supreme court the the
 
00:11:36.069 --> 00:11:36.079 align:start position:0%
supreme court said that it wasn't um
 
00:11:36.079 --> 00:11:37.509 align:start position:0%
supreme court said that it wasn't um
enforceable

00:11:37.509 --> 00:11:37.519 align:start position:0%
enforceable
 
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
because of those two words that the
 
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
override and exclusion uh have a
 
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
different meaning and so
 
00:11:45.269 --> 00:11:45.279 align:start position:0%
this changes the language so that it
 
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
would reinforce the will of the people
 
00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:48.959 align:start position:0%
as i just
 
00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
please yes follow uh
 
00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:03.200 align:start position:0%
is the exclusion something that's
 
00:12:08.949 --> 00:12:08.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
i don't have that information
 
00:12:16.629 --> 00:12:16.639 align:start position:0%
available with me right now um
 
00:12:18.949 --> 00:12:18.959 align:start position:0%
i don't know to be to be frank with you
 
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:20.240 align:start position:0%
and i think that there will be people
 
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:22.720 align:start position:0%
that will testify one way or the other
 
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
to that effect
 
00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
i do know that uh because of the supreme
 
00:12:28.069 --> 00:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
court ruling
 
00:12:28.079 --> 00:12:28.949 align:start position:0%
court ruling
uh

00:12:28.949 --> 00:12:28.959 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
that there is an inconsistency in their
 
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
minds and so there this basically tries
 
00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
to rectify that
 
00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much
 
00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:39.519 align:start position:0%
you are next is uh
 
00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
00:12:43.509 --> 00:12:43.519 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you senator
 
00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:46.720 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um this may seem
 
00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
like a simple question but it's a super
 
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
majority vote of what
 
00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
of the city council of the voters at
 
00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.230 align:start position:0%
of the city council of the voters at
large

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:54.240 align:start position:0%
large
 
00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
the aldermen
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
the aldermen
 
00:12:59.670 --> 00:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
let me let me follow up on that now uh
 
00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:02.949 align:start position:0%
let me let me follow up on that now uh
senator

00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:02.959 align:start position:0%
senator
 
00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
that would be the national example what
 
00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:08.240 align:start position:0%
about municipalities that don't are not
 
00:13:10.389 --> 00:13:10.399 align:start position:0%
served by all
 
00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
uh this basically affects where there's
 
00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
a spending cap or a tax cap and
 
00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
basically reinforces the tax cap i
 
00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
believe rochester has one i believe
 
00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
franklin has one i'm not sure about
 
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
dover but there are there are a few
 
00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.190 align:start position:0%
dover but there are there are a few
others

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:23.200 align:start position:0%
others
 
00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
and this doesn't affect them in in any
 
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
other way other than reinforces what
 
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
what the the senate tried to do in 2011
 
00:13:32.949 --> 00:13:32.959 align:start position:0%
and and uh reinforcing
 
00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
the the language in the will of the
 
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
people um
 
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.030 align:start position:0%
people um
so

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:38.720 align:start position:0%
this does help out the city of nashua
 
00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:43.430 align:start position:0%
this does help out the city of nashua
though

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:45.269 --> 00:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
no mr chair thank you i'll put my hand
 
00:13:45.279 --> 00:13:46.150 align:start position:0%
no mr chair thank you i'll put my hand

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:47.829 align:start position:0%
down
wow

00:13:47.829 --> 00:13:47.839 align:start position:0%
wow
 
00:13:47.839 --> 00:13:52.470 align:start position:0%
wow
status

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:55.509 --> 00:13:55.519 align:start position:0%
and you're still on mute
 
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
yes i just realized that i'm sorry mr
 
00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:58.470 align:start position:0%
yes i just realized that i'm sorry mr
chair

00:13:58.470 --> 00:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you senator
 
00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:02.720 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
where the sentence is an ordinance or
 
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
accounting practice that redistributes
 
00:14:14.829 --> 00:14:14.839 align:start position:0%
excludable budget
 
00:14:14.839 --> 00:14:16.550 align:start position:0%
excludable budget
items

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
items
 
00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
how does an ordinance redistribute
 
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
budget items it seems to me that an
 
00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
ordinance is something quite different
 
00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
than an accounting practice and i'm just
 
00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
i'm looking for some kind of an
 
00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:30.240 align:start position:0%
explanation of
 
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:32.240 align:start position:0%
how do you know if the if the will of
 
00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:34.240 align:start position:0%
the people is to pass a certain
 
00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.750 align:start position:0%
the people is to pass a certain
ordinance

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
ordinance
 
00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
whether that ordinance has
 
00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
financial implications tied to it that i
 
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
don't understand how you would know that
 
00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:45.519 align:start position:0%
i live in a city myself
 
00:14:45.519 --> 00:14:47.430 align:start position:0%
i live in a city myself
and

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:14:49.509 --> 00:14:49.519 align:start position:0%
we pass ordinances all the time and
 
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
they're not necessarily attached to
 
00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
well i would think that
 
00:14:59.430 --> 00:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh we have bills in the senate and in
 
00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:02.240 align:start position:0%
the house some have a financial um note
 
00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
to them and some don't
 
00:15:09.269 --> 00:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
okay uh next uh representative benjami

you did mention that it's going to
 
00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.069 align:start position:0%
you did mention that it's going to
affect

00:15:22.069 --> 00:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
affect
 
00:15:22.079 --> 00:15:23.590 align:start position:0%

nashua
directly

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
directly
 
00:15:27.509 --> 00:15:27.519 align:start position:0%
and having lived in nashville for 30
 
00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
plus years i remember the
 
00:15:32.069 --> 00:15:32.079 align:start position:0%
spending cap and then the
 
00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
trying to override it and
 
00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
super majority we have 15 aldermen
 
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
super majority what does what
 
00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
two third majority versus super majority
 
00:15:48.069 --> 00:15:48.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:53.189 --> 00:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
are you alluding to two third majority
 
00:15:59.110 --> 00:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
or the super majority
 
00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.509 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:05.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
i don't know how to answer that surprise
 
00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
let me jump in
 
00:16:12.069 --> 00:16:12.079 align:start position:0%
uh senator do you know if the net
 
00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
nashville charter defines what a
 
00:16:17.189 --> 00:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
supermajority is for the ultimate
 
00:16:19.509 --> 00:16:19.519 align:start position:0%
right offhand i don't
 
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
okay we'll be getting some major notches
 
00:16:24.389 --> 00:16:24.399 align:start position:0%
mayor dodgers soon i'm sure he will
 
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
probably know the answer to that quote
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
okay representative matthew eurek
 
00:16:32.069 --> 00:16:32.079 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you senator
 
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
for taking my question i understand that
 
00:16:38.069 --> 00:16:38.079 align:start position:0%
the intent of this bill was to clarify
 
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
uh clarify the definitions override
 
00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
versus exclusion
 
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
does the addition of super majority
 
00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
do that or does
 
00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:52.720 align:start position:0%
including the word excludable do that or
 
00:16:57.269 --> 00:16:57.279 align:start position:0%
are they complementary or or not
 
00:16:59.749 --> 00:16:59.759 align:start position:0%
that i would defer to the attorneys that
 
00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
helped draft this uh i i believe that
 
00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
they they can answer that a little
 
00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
clearer than i can i just understand uh
 
00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
the the simplest form of this bill
 
00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:13.919 align:start position:0%
was to to clarify those two words and to
 
00:17:13.919 --> 00:17:14.870 align:start position:0%
was to to clarify those two words and to
provide

00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
provide
 
00:17:17.029 --> 00:17:17.039 align:start position:0%
that the the town or the city of
 
00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:19.839 align:start position:0%
nashville would be able to enforce its
 
00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
uh its original charter by by making
 
00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
these two
 
00:17:27.029 --> 00:17:27.039 align:start position:0%
two corrections uh
 
00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:28.720 align:start position:0%
okay it's
 
00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
it's that's yeah
 
00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't to over complicate this
 
00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
bill it just it's very simple it's the
 
00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
will of the people they voted for this
 
00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
they did vote for it by a referendum
 
00:17:40.789 --> 00:17:40.799 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
and the people were outraged that the
 
00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:44.789 align:start position:0%
and the people were outraged that the
uh

00:17:44.789 --> 00:17:44.799 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
the bill has not been reinforced in late
 
00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
as of late
 
00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
and so it went all the way to the
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
and this is their direction as to as to
 
00:17:57.909 --> 00:17:57.919 align:start position:0%
what we need to do to for the will of
 
00:17:59.430 --> 00:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
the people
 
00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:00.799 align:start position:0%
to be enforced
 
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:03.120 align:start position:0%

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
1993
 
00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:21.520 align:start position:0%

tax spending cap
 
00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
referendum held
 
00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
i that i don't know i do know that there
 
00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
was some legislation in 2011 that was uh
 
00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:35.039 align:start position:0%
aimed at trying to support
 
00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:38.240 align:start position:0%
the the intent of the spending cap and
 
00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
the tax cap statewide
 
00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:41.840 align:start position:0%

and uh
through

00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
the wisdom of the the senate and uh i
 
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:46.720 align:start position:0%
believe senator bradley was part of that
 
00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:48.160 align:start position:0%
that conversation
 
00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
uh they overlooked uh that this might be
 
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
an issue and that's why uh it's brought
 
00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:54.640 align:start position:0%
before you today
 
00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
again and it had been reinforced it had
 
00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:58.230 align:start position:0%
again and it had been reinforced it had
been

00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:58.240 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:18:59.590 --> 00:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
abided by
 
00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
for many years and it seems as though it
 
00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.350 align:start position:0%
for many years and it seems as though it
uh

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:06.160 align:start position:0%
it is not at this present time
 
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that answers your
 
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
question or not
 
00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
it does but i have a follow-up effect
 
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
all right mr chair exactly
 
00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:19:20.549 --> 00:19:20.559 align:start position:0%
it was vote it was voted on in
 
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
93 you said or 11.
 
00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
the tax cap the the referendum that the
 
00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:28.160 align:start position:0%
spending cap the referendum was uh
 
00:19:31.669 --> 00:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
adopted in 1993. it was uh
 
00:19:35.029 --> 00:19:35.039 align:start position:0%
uh the state uh tried to fix it so that
 
00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:36.640 align:start position:0%
it could be reached
 
00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
in 2011.
 
00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
could it come up for a referendum vote
 
00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:48.230 align:start position:0%
could it come up for a referendum vote
again

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.120 align:start position:0%

unions effective
 
00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
july 5 2011
 
00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
data came up earlier
 
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire legislature enacted
 
00:21:41.909 --> 00:21:41.919 align:start position:0%
authority for cities and towns
 
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
to adapt
 
00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
adopt a spending cap or tax cap
 
00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
subject to a number of conditions
 
00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
and included a provision to override the
 
00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:52.789 align:start position:0%
and included a provision to override the
cap

00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:52.799 align:start position:0%
cap
 
00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
with the super majority vote
 
00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:57.039 align:start position:0%
and the left adopted the communities
 
00:21:58.950 --> 00:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
that adopted this camp
 
00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
but the super majority vote was
 
00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
in the case of nashua of course it's a
 
00:22:05.909 --> 00:22:05.919 align:start position:0%
two-thirds vote of the altman and in
 
00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
towns of course it's the uh
 
00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
it's the legislature just like in cities
 
00:22:17.909 --> 00:22:17.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:19.909 --> 00:22:19.919 align:start position:0%
seven cities
 
00:22:23.909 --> 00:22:23.919 align:start position:0%
had adopted the tax cap or spending cap
 
00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
each cap
 
00:22:27.909 --> 00:22:27.919 align:start position:0%
had passed legal scrutiny
 
00:22:29.669 --> 00:22:29.679 align:start position:0%
prior to adoption
 
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
into their respective charges and had to
 
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:33.440 align:start position:0%
be adopted into a charter according to
 
00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:35.669 align:start position:0%
be adopted into a charter according to
49b

00:22:35.669 --> 00:22:35.679 align:start position:0%
49b
 
00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
through a review of the secretary of
 
00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:38.390 align:start position:0%
through a review of the secretary of
state

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
the attorney general and the department
 
00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
of reference administration each of
 
00:22:43.909 --> 00:22:43.919 align:start position:0%
these departments had to
 
00:22:46.549 --> 00:22:46.559 align:start position:0%
rule on the
 
00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh proposed
 
00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
spending a tax cap before it could be
 
00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
adopted and in every case if there was a
 
00:22:55.029 --> 00:22:55.039 align:start position:0%
negative vote then it could not be
 
00:22:55.039 --> 00:22:57.110 align:start position:0%
negative vote then it could not be
adopted

00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
adopted
 
00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
so all those that were adopted passed
 
00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
legal scrutiny by these three
 
00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:06.950 align:start position:0%
legal scrutiny by these three
departments

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
now there was also a case board in
 
00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
manchester in 2010
 
00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
by various labor unions
 
00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
to try to
 
00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:19.360 align:start position:0%
declare spending and tax caps in new
 
00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire illegal
 
00:23:25.669 --> 00:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:25.679 --> 00:23:26.710 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
that lawsuit did not succeed
 
00:23:32.549 --> 00:23:32.559 align:start position:0%
now the new hampshire legislature then
 
00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
passed the spending of tax cap
 
00:23:36.549 --> 00:23:36.559 align:start position:0%
legislation 2011
 
00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:38.320 align:start position:0%
specifically a response to that
 
00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
manchester court case
 
00:23:43.029 --> 00:23:43.039 align:start position:0%
and because there had been these fire
 
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
adapted caps
 
00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
and caps could not necessarily predict
 
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
what the legislature would come up with
 
00:23:50.789 --> 00:23:50.799 align:start position:0%
and had some inconsistencies of course
 
00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
you know you can't predict
 
00:23:54.149 --> 00:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
back in 1993 what people are going to
 
00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
decide in 2011 as an example
 
00:23:59.750 --> 00:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
so the legislature clearly intended to
 
00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:02.830 align:start position:0%
so the legislature clearly intended to
grandfather

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
previously enacted tax or spending caps
 
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
of any kind
 
00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:11.480 align:start position:0%
and the copy has a language of
 
00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
rsa49b132a which is the
 
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:19.830 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire supreme court
 
00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:21.110 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire supreme court
[Music]

00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
in year 2019 that's the case that
 
00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
denmark and i brought
 
00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
in a split treated to this vision very
 
00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
rare in the hampshire was treated to
 
00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:32.240 align:start position:0%
split the decision
 
00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:33.590 align:start position:0%
split the decision
ruled

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
ruled
 
00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
that the last sentence
 
00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:42.230 align:start position:0%
 
49b32a

00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
49b32a
 
00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:44.070 align:start position:0%
49b32a
invalidates

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
invalidates
 
00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
his grandfather provision
 
00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
thereby terminating
 
00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
at the decision
 
00:24:53.669 --> 00:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
the national cap
 
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
and thereby also threatening all
 
00:24:58.870 --> 00:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
the validity of all tax and spending
 
00:25:02.789 --> 00:25:02.799 align:start position:0%
caps adopted prior to 2011.
 
00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:04.400 align:start position:0%
now i should mention because i heard a
 
00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
comment earlier
 
00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
there were two issues before the supreme
 
00:25:09.029 --> 00:25:09.039 align:start position:0%
court one
 
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
is exclusion the same as an override
 
00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
and nasa has an exclusion
 
00:25:17.029 --> 00:25:17.039 align:start position:0%
which has always been interpreted as an
 
00:25:20.149 --> 00:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
override the supreme court said the word
 
00:25:21.909 --> 00:25:21.919 align:start position:0%
exclusion the word override are not the
 
00:25:24.549 --> 00:25:24.559 align:start position:0%
same thing and so they said that's not
 
00:25:24.559 --> 00:25:25.750 align:start position:0%
same thing and so they said that's not
valid

00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
valid
 
00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
but then the issue came up
 
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
whether nasa's
 
00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
spending cap was grandfathered so i
 
00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
would say 49b 132a
 
00:25:37.269 --> 00:25:37.279 align:start position:0%
and then they ruled and i've made this
 
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
decision i'll tell you i've read it 100
 
00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:40.950 align:start position:0%
decision i'll tell you i've read it 100
times

00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
times
 
00:25:43.029 --> 00:25:43.039 align:start position:0%
if you look at page
 
00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:44.720 align:start position:0%
lines six
 
00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
and seven
 
00:25:49.029 --> 00:25:49.039 align:start position:0%
of your amendment the first page
 
00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
you see the sentence is struck out
 
00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:54.640 align:start position:0%
that is a sentence starting with without
 
00:25:57.909 --> 00:25:57.919 align:start position:0%
regard whether such entities
 
00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
or an accident were archived by law
 
00:26:03.029 --> 00:26:03.039 align:start position:0%
and the tango establishment taken they
 
00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
found that
 
00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:05.510 align:start position:0%
found that
to

00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
negate the grandfather clause
 
00:26:10.789 --> 00:26:10.799 align:start position:0%
i said i read it a hundred times
 
00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
i got a decision a thousand times
 
00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm puzzled by the decision it's a
 
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
three-to-two decision
 
00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:19.029 align:start position:0%
three-to-two decision
the

00:26:19.029 --> 00:26:19.039 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:26:19.039 --> 00:26:19.830 align:start position:0%
the
two

00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
against were totally opposed to that
 
00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:24.400 align:start position:0%
decision but nevertheless if people make
 
00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
a decision you can't further appeal any
 
00:26:28.149 --> 00:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
further at the end of the
 
00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:34.630 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
the amended
 
00:26:40.789 --> 00:26:40.799 align:start position:0%
sb 52 before you
 
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
correct his inequity
 
00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:46.400 align:start position:0%
by striking the last sentence
 
00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:48.269 align:start position:0%
by striking the last sentence
apart

00:26:48.269 --> 00:26:48.279 align:start position:0%
apart
 
00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
49b132a that's line six and seven of the
 
00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
and this revalidates
 
00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
all spending and text gaps
 
00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
that were legally adopted
 
00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
prior to 2011 but have some minor
 
00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
differences of current law such as in
 
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
particular in case of nashua
 
00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:16.799 align:start position:0%
the issue is it's an exclusion the same
 
00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
as an override i mean you can nitpick
 
00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
yourself out to death
 
00:27:22.789 --> 00:27:22.799 align:start position:0%
the fact is
 
00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
nash is a grandfather so even if you
 
00:27:26.789 --> 00:27:26.799 align:start position:0%
argue about whether exclusion or an
 
00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:28.400 align:start position:0%
override is the same thing or not the
 
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
same thing
 
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
nash's grandfather if you strike that
 
00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
first sentence that sentence at line six
 
00:27:36.789 --> 00:27:36.799 align:start position:0%
and seven
 
00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:38.400 align:start position:0%
that takes away the objection of the
 
00:27:41.269 --> 00:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
and that's his grandfather and any this
 
00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
is the most important part there are
 
00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
seven i said six the seven caps
 
00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
all of them have some variations
 
00:27:57.909 --> 00:27:57.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:57.919 --> 00:27:58.789 align:start position:0%
 
mr

and eliminate the gross inequity
 
00:28:18.549 --> 00:28:18.559 align:start position:0%
committed by the national supreme court
 
00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:21.200 align:start position:0%
when it rejected the 322 vote the clear
 
00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.190 align:start position:0%

good good morning representatives
 
00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
i'm timothy twombly from wad 7 in nashua
 
00:30:27.909 --> 00:30:27.919 align:start position:0%
i'm speaking in favor of sb 52
 
00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
during my six years as a state
 
00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:31.110 align:start position:0%
during my six years as a state
representative

00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
and it was confirmed this morning that
 
00:30:36.149 --> 00:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
it was in 2011 that we voted for this
 
00:30:38.149 --> 00:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
new legislation
 
00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
i voted in support of that legislation
 
00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
relating to spending caps and tax caps
 
00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
because of a problem that manchester was
 
00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:46.789 align:start position:0%
because of a problem that manchester was
having

00:30:46.789 --> 00:30:46.799 align:start position:0%
having
 
00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
testimony at that time stated that
 
00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
cities and towns with existing tax or
 
00:30:53.029 --> 00:30:53.039 align:start position:0%
spending caps would not be affected by
 
00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
the new legislation
 
00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
and those existing caps would remain in
 
00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:57.990 align:start position:0%
and those existing caps would remain in
force

00:30:57.990 --> 00:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
force
 
00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
and that's why i was willing to support
 
00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
it to help out the city of
 
00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
nashua however recently the supreme
 
00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
court has ruled differently on this
 
00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
matter for nashua
 
00:31:12.149 --> 00:31:12.159 align:start position:0%
i support this legislation as it
 
00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
resolves the issue of
 
00:31:14.399 --> 00:31:15.510 align:start position:0%
resolves the issue of
vague

00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
vague
 
00:31:18.389 --> 00:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
or inconsistent wording encloses
 
00:31:20.549 --> 00:31:20.559 align:start position:0%
loopholes in the current law
 
00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
and as we've heard this morning it all
 
00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
relates to exclusions
 
00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
and overrides
 
00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
so i thank you very very much for
 
00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:35.669 --> 00:31:35.679 align:start position:0%
yes a question from representative tripp
 
00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:31:39.029 --> 00:31:39.039 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
00:31:39.039 --> 00:31:39.990 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
question

00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:40.789 align:start position:0%
question
uh

00:31:40.789 --> 00:31:40.799 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
this all seems to revolve around
 
00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:44.549 align:start position:0%
this all seems to revolve around
uh

00:31:44.549 --> 00:31:44.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:31:47.029 --> 00:31:47.039 align:start position:0%
override versus exclusion
 
00:31:48.789 --> 00:31:48.799 align:start position:0%
do you know
 
00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:50.720 align:start position:0%
what the difference is
 
00:31:53.029 --> 00:31:53.039 align:start position:0%
i do not i do not know all i know is the
 
00:31:54.389 --> 00:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
supreme court thinks there's a
 
00:31:54.399 --> 00:31:55.060 align:start position:0%
supreme court thinks there's a
difference

00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:55.070 align:start position:0%
difference
 
00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:58.310 align:start position:0%
difference

unless
 
00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
i i would only ask and i i still can't
 
00:32:30.789 --> 00:32:30.799 align:start position:0%
find if he's calling in on some in some

see him
 
00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
mr moriarty did you if you're listening

numbers that we see listed
 
00:33:00.549 --> 00:33:00.559 align:start position:0%
okay in the meantime let's uh let's
 
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
recognize uh mayo donchez
 
00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:04.549 align:start position:0%
recognize uh mayo donchez
uh

00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:04.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:33:06.149 --> 00:33:06.159 align:start position:0%
maya you've uh
 
00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
with all the respect you've asked for a
 
00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
ten minute speaking period i'd like to
 
00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
ask you to try to cut that in half and
 
00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
stay uh five minutes or less
 
00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
um okay mr chair can you hear me yeah
 
00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
and you sound fine please
 
00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
all right well i didn't know that i'd
 
00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
asked for 10 minutes so i apologize for
 
00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
that yes i could definitely speak in
 
00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
less than 10 minutes
 
00:33:30.789 --> 00:33:30.799 align:start position:0%
first of all i wanted to and i thank you
 
00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:32.720 align:start position:0%
for of course hearing us mr chair and
 
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
i wanted to correct a couple of the
 
00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
things that have been said so far first
 
00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
representative porter's question
 
00:33:45.029 --> 00:33:45.039 align:start position:0%
and a charter amendment
 
00:33:47.029 --> 00:33:47.039 align:start position:0%
does not need a two-thirds majority of
 
00:33:49.029 --> 00:33:49.039 align:start position:0%
the population it requires a simple
 
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
majority meaning a one-vote margin is
 
00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
enough to pass a charter amendment
 
00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:54.870 align:start position:0%
enough to pass a charter amendment
um

00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:57.200 align:start position:0%
number two uh the people are not
 
00:34:00.789 --> 00:34:00.799 align:start position:0%
outraged by what you know whatever the
 
00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
the senator my friend senator avarden
 
00:34:05.909 --> 00:34:05.919 align:start position:0%
uh suggested that the people are
 
00:34:08.149 --> 00:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
outraged the people are not outraged
 
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
those who have run based on the platform
 
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
you've heard
 
00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
including my friend senator avard and
 
00:34:17.589 --> 00:34:17.599 align:start position:0%
my friend fred tebum they've run for the
 
00:34:19.829 --> 00:34:19.839 align:start position:0%
board of aldermen they lost based on
 
00:34:25.589 --> 00:34:25.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:27.669 --> 00:34:27.679 align:start position:0%
is there someone else speaking
 
00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
if you're not uh speaking please uh put
 
00:34:32.829 --> 00:34:32.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:41.430 --> 00:34:41.440 align:start position:0%
i think maybe put yourself on mute i
 
00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:42.149 align:start position:0%
i think maybe put yourself on mute i
think

00:34:42.149 --> 00:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:34:44.069 --> 00:34:44.079 align:start position:0%
there you go right so those who have run
 
00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
based on this platform have have all
 
00:34:48.629 --> 00:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
lost actually so the people are not
 
00:34:50.869 --> 00:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
outraged but i would ask
 
00:34:53.669 --> 00:34:53.679 align:start position:0%
that you asked the citizens of that you
 
00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
allow the citizens of nashua to resolve
 
00:34:58.870 --> 00:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
this whole thing i mean this is a local
 
00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:00.069 align:start position:0%
this whole thing i mean this is a local
issue

00:35:00.069 --> 00:35:00.079 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:35:02.069 --> 00:35:02.079 align:start position:0%
uh the reason that this is before the
 
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
legislature is that the
 
00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:06.880 align:start position:0%
the people do not support particularly
 
00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
the efforts that are being made here and
 
00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
that's why
 
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
instead of presenting this to the city
 
00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
they're kind of they're coming to the
 
00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:15.349 align:start position:0%
they're kind of they're coming to the
legislature

00:35:15.349 --> 00:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
now the
 
00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:18.640 align:start position:0%
suggestion that the city budget is out
 
00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
of control or something that i mean that
 
00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
is just not correct
 
00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
the last five years the budget has gone
 
00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
up on average of less than three percent
 
00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:29.589 align:start position:0%
up on average of less than three percent
the

00:35:29.589 --> 00:35:29.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:35:31.349 --> 00:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
uh right now
 
00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
the biggest
 
00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:34.720 align:start position:0%
problem we're facing and why at the tax
 
00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
cap or a budget or tax cap like this can
 
00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
become a problem
 
00:35:41.109 --> 00:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
is that with all due respect mr chair
 
00:35:43.109 --> 00:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire is hitting us
 
00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
slamming us right now with
 
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of increased costs and reduced
 
00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:48.950 align:start position:0%
a lot of increased costs and reduced
revenues

00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
specifically pension bill up 4.4 million
 
00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:53.829 align:start position:0%
specifically pension bill up 4.4 million
dollars

00:35:53.829 --> 00:35:53.839 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
unrelated if you talk with a pension
 
00:35:57.670 --> 00:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
system it has nothing to do with city
 
00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
wages it had to do with the reduction in
 
00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
the assumed rate of return by the
 
00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
pension system four point four million
 
00:36:06.069 --> 00:36:06.079 align:start position:0%
dollars that's a two per that's a two
 
00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
percent tax increase right there
 
00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:10.640 align:start position:0%
number two
 
00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
uh the amount under the the formula of
 
00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
the department of education the
 
00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
amount for reimbursement of free and
 
00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch kids is going to go down
 
00:36:24.069 --> 00:36:24.079 align:start position:0%
over 2 million dollars
 
00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:27.440 align:start position:0%
that is an artificial reduction
 
00:36:29.829 --> 00:36:29.839 align:start position:0%
we do not have less free and reduced
 
00:36:32.069 --> 00:36:32.079 align:start position:0%
lunch kids than we did before in fact we
 
00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
have more
 
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
but the reason
 
00:36:39.109 --> 00:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
is that the federal government made
 
00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
lunches free during the pandemic
 
00:36:45.109 --> 00:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
so the paperwork which is quite
 
00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:48.640 align:start position:0%
extensive that is necessary to qualify
 
00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
families for free and reduced lunch
 
00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
there's no real incentive for families
 
00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
to fill this out anymore
 
00:36:58.870 --> 00:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
they're busy they have jobs you know
 
00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:00.150 align:start position:0%
they're busy they have jobs you know
they

00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
and it's an easy thing to just you know
 
00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:04.240 align:start position:0%
put to the back burner
 
00:37:07.109 --> 00:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
so less families have qualified
 
00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
even though more families and these are
 
00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
low income people they're
 
00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
lower income people they're not doing
 
00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
well during the pandemic
 
00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
so here is a reduction of state aid of
 
00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
over 2 million dollars
 
00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:23.910 align:start position:0%
over 2 million dollars
now

00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
it is so what the sponsors here are
 
00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
suggesting is that
 
00:37:33.349 --> 00:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
put under that kind of pressure by the
 
00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire and i you know
 
00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not holding any individual
 
00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
legislators you know responsible there's
 
00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of things going on
 
00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
uh when the city when the state is
 
00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:45.910 align:start position:0%
uh when the city when the state is
putting

00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
putting
 
00:37:48.069 --> 00:37:48.079 align:start position:0%
nashua and other communities under that
 
00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
kind of pressure to at the same time be
 
00:37:53.109 --> 00:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
enacting legislation suggesting that
 
00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
somehow nashua is
 
00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
budget and taxes are out of control i
 
00:37:57.119 --> 00:37:58.150 align:start position:0%
budget and taxes are out of control i
mean

00:37:58.150 --> 00:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
mean
 
00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
were it were it not for what the state
 
00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:03.440 align:start position:0%
is doing to us right now our tax rate
 
00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:06.640 align:start position:0%
would be flat or down based on the
 
00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
budget that i have proposed but it's
 
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
going to be going up three or four
 
00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
percent because we've got to deal with
 
00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
these issues
 
00:38:15.589 --> 00:38:15.599 align:start position:0%
that the state is
 
00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
hitting us with
 
00:38:21.349 --> 00:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
our city hall budget is down 2.7 percent
 
00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:22.720 align:start position:0%
this year
 
00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
our public works budget is down 1.9
 
00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
percent our public library budget is
 
00:38:31.589 --> 00:38:31.599 align:start position:0%
down 1.9 percent but taxes are going to
 
00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
go up
 
00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
because we have to
 
00:38:35.829 --> 00:38:35.839 align:start position:0%
find that four million dollars for
 
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
increased pension costs we have to
 
00:38:39.349 --> 00:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
somehow replace
 
00:38:39.359 --> 00:38:40.870 align:start position:0%
somehow replace
the

00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh reduction in revenue from the free
 
00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
and reduced lunch uh formula
 
00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:47.829 align:start position:0%
and reduced lunch uh formula
so

00:38:47.829 --> 00:38:47.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
look you know i just ask that you just
 
00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:51.839 align:start position:0%
let the citizens of nashville resolve
 
00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
this if spending is out of control they
 
00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:56.069 align:start position:0%
this if spending is out of control they
will

00:38:56.069 --> 00:38:56.079 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
take care of it
 
00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
and the people who advance this agenda
 
00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
or saying these things will
 
00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
get elected
 
00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:06.790 align:start position:0%
get elected
so

00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
you know each city and town and i know
 
00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
you're from some people are from cities
 
00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
and some are from towns but each city
 
00:39:15.349 --> 00:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
has its own system here and there are a
 
00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
lot of tax caps and
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
and budget caps and
 
00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
those are all enacted at the local level
 
00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
the state is not imposing these things
 
00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
on cities and towns because i think most
 
00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:33.200 align:start position:0%
legislators understand the
 
00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
difficulties that cities and towns are
 
00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:36.390 align:start position:0%
difficulties that cities and towns are
having

00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
having
 
00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
with the pandemic and with some of the
 
00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:40.720 align:start position:0%
problems at the state level that impact
 
00:39:43.349 --> 00:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
us locally so
 
00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
i would ask that you allow the citizens
 
00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
of nashua the government of nashua
 
00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:48.550 align:start position:0%
of nashua the government of nashua
if

00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
this is a problem put it
 
00:39:54.069 --> 00:39:54.079 align:start position:0%
put it you know correct it locally
 
00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
and that's uh what i so i would ask you
 
00:39:58.630 --> 00:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
mr chairman to
 
00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:01.440 align:start position:0%

00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:03.680 align:start position:0%

highlighting the referendum
 
00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
in nashua in terms of uh spending cap
 
00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
wasn't there a referendum that went down
 
00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:30.630 align:start position:0%
wasn't there a referendum that went down
to

00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:30.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:31.750 align:start position:0%
to
um

00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:35.349 --> 00:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
in regards to cap spending cap a few
 
00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
there was a referendum that the voters
 
00:40:46.069 --> 00:40:46.079 align:start position:0%
wanted to
 
00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
support the city to make the appropriate
 
00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
when we had the new high schools and all
 
00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:52.550 align:start position:0%
when we had the new high schools and all
that

00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:40:55.829 --> 00:40:55.839 align:start position:0%
at that time wasn't there a referendum
 
00:40:58.710 --> 00:40:58.720 align:start position:0%
that the overwhelming majority
 
00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
of citizens
 
00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:02.550 align:start position:0%
of citizens
supported

00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
supported
 
00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh the project in the spending
 
00:41:08.309 --> 00:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
well there have been various votes and
 
00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:10.640 align:start position:0%
uh at various times another thing that i
 
00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to i point out is that all the
 
00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:14.720 align:start position:0%
budgets have passed with us the
 
00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
so-called super majority i mean
 
00:41:20.309 --> 00:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
uh the budgets have been passing with
 
00:41:22.309 --> 00:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
more than 10 votes
 
00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
in fact usually 12 13 14 15. um
 
00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
so super majority is already passing
 
00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
these budgets um
 
00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
and the budgets are reasonable and and
 
00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
rational um
 
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
one other correction that i wanted to
 
00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
give you is that the question was asked
 
00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
and i forget by whom
 
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
as to when the nashua city charter was
 
00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:47.000 align:start position:0%
enacted and the answer was
 
00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
1993. no
 
00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
the city charter was enacted
 
00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:53.200 align:start position:0%
well over 100 years ago
 
00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:54.640 align:start position:0%
now the
 
00:41:57.590 --> 00:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
the spending cap that uh you
 
00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:58.790 align:start position:0%
the spending cap that uh you

was
 
00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
adopted by a very narrow majority
 
00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
actually in 1993
 
00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:10.000 align:start position:0%

00:44:04.309 --> 00:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
seems that the
 
00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
crux of this problem is that there was a
 
00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
difference between exclusion versus
 
00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:12.230 align:start position:0%
difference between exclusion versus
override

00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
override
 
00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
do you know what the difference between
 
00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
those two words are
 
00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:18.870 align:start position:0%
those two words are
yes

00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:18.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:20.309 align:start position:0%
yes
um

00:44:20.309 --> 00:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:20.319 --> 00:44:21.670 align:start position:0%
um
the

00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:21.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:22.550 align:start position:0%
the
the

00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:44:26.470 --> 00:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
the nashville city charter adopts a very
 
00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
or had you know had in it a very um
 
00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
complicated way to try to
 
00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:34.710 align:start position:0%
complicated way to try to
uh

00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:34.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
deal with a situation where
 
00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
the proposed spending might be over the
 
00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
spending cap
 
00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:42.640 align:start position:0%
and it did not and it does not conform
 
00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
with state law so
 
00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:45.750 align:start position:0%
with state law so
the

00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
rather than a simple override you know
 
00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
we vote to override there was this thing
 
00:44:53.829 --> 00:44:53.839 align:start position:0%
where there's this provision where you
 
00:44:56.309 --> 00:44:56.319 align:start position:0%
vote to ex where there's a vote to
 
00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
exclude from the camp or from the
 
00:45:04.069 --> 00:45:04.079 align:start position:0%
consideration portions of the city
 
00:45:06.309 --> 00:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
debt service
 
00:45:06.319 --> 00:45:07.829 align:start position:0%
debt service
and

00:45:07.829 --> 00:45:07.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
up to the full amount of the city's debt
 
00:45:11.829 --> 00:45:11.839 align:start position:0%
service i you know so it
 
00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
it was a very weird provision now
 
00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
it is a very weird provision now the um
 
00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of the way this
 
00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
was arose i mean the city didn't contest
 
00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:28.480 align:start position:0%
you know didn't take this thing to court
 
00:45:31.589 --> 00:45:31.599 align:start position:0%
um mr t boom and mr moriarty brought
 
00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
this to court
 
00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
they sued the city the city simply
 
00:45:39.589 --> 00:45:39.599 align:start position:0%
you know uh on a very technical issue
 
00:45:42.069 --> 00:45:42.079 align:start position:0%
the city simply reject you know
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
simply uh
 
00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
just you know disagreed with them on the
 
00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
technical issue that they raised
 
00:45:50.309 --> 00:45:50.319 align:start position:0%
and the court ruled on its own volition
 
00:45:52.069 --> 00:45:52.079 align:start position:0%
that this that this complicated
 
00:45:55.829 --> 00:45:55.839 align:start position:0%
procedure did not conform with state law
 
00:45:57.510 --> 00:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
and the supreme court affirmed it so
 
00:45:59.030 --> 00:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
this is not this you know this is not
 
00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
something the city try you know went to
 
00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
court to try to put this aside
 
00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:04.870 align:start position:0%
court to try to put this aside
um

00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh this was done by the the proponents
 
00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:14.309 --> 00:46:14.319 align:start position:0%
so you know i i'm still asking that you
 
00:46:16.309 --> 00:46:16.319 align:start position:0%
just resol let this local citizens
 
00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
resolve this um
 
00:46:20.309 --> 00:46:20.319 align:start position:0%
people who have advanced this locally
 
00:46:21.829 --> 00:46:21.839 align:start position:0%
have gotten
 
00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
you know the idea that things are out of
 
00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
control and everything have gotten
 
00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:26.470 align:start position:0%
control and everything have gotten
nowhere

00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
nowhere
 
00:46:29.109 --> 00:46:29.119 align:start position:0%
they they can't get elected and because
 
00:46:31.109 --> 00:46:31.119 align:start position:0%
the people think that the city is acting
 
00:46:31.119 --> 00:46:33.510 align:start position:0%
the people think that the city is acting
responsibly

00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
responsibly
 
00:46:35.109 --> 00:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
well thank you mayor i think that's the
 
00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
last question we have for you
 
00:46:38.710 --> 00:46:38.720 align:start position:0%
at this point we're going to move on to
 
00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:40.230 align:start position:0%
at this point we're going to move on to
uh

00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:44.400 align:start position:0%

[Music]

00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
finally thank you very much uh
 
00:47:58.150 --> 00:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
a couple things first the uh the
 
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
national lawsuit
 
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
that i brought up
 
00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
was a result of
 
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
the alderman not respecting
 
00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
the spending cap as written
 
00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
it was not a lawsuit that was brought up
 
00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:14.150 align:start position:0%
it was not a lawsuit that was brought up
in

00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:16.640 align:start position:0%
opposition to it so
 
00:48:19.109 --> 00:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
mayor donches sort of that was his
 
00:48:21.510 --> 00:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
portrayal but
 
00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
the aldermen were not respecting
 
00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
the spending cap and that's why we have
 
00:48:28.069 --> 00:48:28.079 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
because it one of the things that it
 
00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:31.430 align:start position:0%
because it one of the things that it
does

00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
is it
 
00:48:35.190 --> 00:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
closes some of the loopholes that the
 
00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
aldermen of nashua
 
00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
were taking advantage of
 
00:48:43.109 --> 00:48:43.119 align:start position:0%
one thing i'd like to point out is that
 
00:48:43.119 --> 00:48:44.309 align:start position:0%
one thing i'd like to point out is that
although

00:48:44.309 --> 00:48:44.319 align:start position:0%
although
 
00:48:46.390 --> 00:48:46.400 align:start position:0%
sb 52
 
00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
the genesis of it may have been
 
00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:52.720 align:start position:0%
to fix just the nashua spending cap
 
00:48:56.630 --> 00:48:56.640 align:start position:0%
in the process especially through
 
00:48:59.510 --> 00:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
discussions with the senate attorney
 
00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
we discovered that all spending caps in
 
00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire are at risk because of
 
00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:06.870 align:start position:0%
new hampshire are at risk because of
similar

00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
similar
 
00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
problems so
 
00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
for instance to address specifically
 
00:49:11.829 --> 00:49:11.839 align:start position:0%
what mayor don just said is that this
 
00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
bank nashville's spending cap is not
 
00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
complaint with the law
 
00:49:17.430 --> 00:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
well nashua spending cap actually
 
00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
predates the law
 
00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
and that's the problem there are several
 
00:49:22.549 --> 00:49:22.559 align:start position:0%
spending caps where the people
 
00:49:22.559 --> 00:49:23.670 align:start position:0%
spending caps where the people
passed

00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
passed
 
00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
a referendum and establish a spending
 
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
cap and use their own language as best
 
00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
they knew at the time
 
00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
and then there were subsequent
 
00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:34.150 align:start position:0%
and then there were subsequent
lawsuits

00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
lawsuits
 
00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
and as a result of the subsequent
 
00:49:38.549 --> 00:49:38.559 align:start position:0%
lawsuits the legislature
 
00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
responded to the lawsuits in order to
 
00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
reinforce existing spending caps so the
 
00:49:46.309 --> 00:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
legislature has already attempted to
 
00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:48.640 align:start position:0%
reinforce the national spending cap
 
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
which predated the law
 
00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
and and used the term exclusion
 
00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:55.030 align:start position:0%
and and used the term exclusion
and

00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
override differently
 
00:49:59.109 --> 00:49:59.119 align:start position:0%
the legislature at the time meant those
 
00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
two words to mean the same thing just as
 
00:50:02.549 --> 00:50:02.559 align:start position:0%
nashua meant those words to mean the
 
00:50:04.309 --> 00:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
same thing but when you get in the court
 
00:50:06.309 --> 00:50:06.319 align:start position:0%
of law sometimes people can argue one
 
00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
way or another and the judges can rule
 
00:50:10.710 --> 00:50:10.720 align:start position:0%
differently and that's the case here
 
00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
so what we found in trying to clarify
 
00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
the issue of
 
00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
of exclusion versus
 
00:50:20.309 --> 00:50:20.319 align:start position:0%
versus override
 
00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
we found that all spanning caps are at
 
00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
risk and so this sp52 does two things
 
00:50:30.069 --> 00:50:30.079 align:start position:0%
the first thing it does is it fixes
 
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
the grandfather clause the legislature
 
00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:34.240 align:start position:0%
knew that they can't go through and just
 
00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
fix every word of every charter it's
 
00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
just it's just ridiculous to even think
 
00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:38.950 align:start position:0%
just it's just ridiculous to even think
that

00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:50:40.549 --> 00:50:40.559 align:start position:0%
expect them to do that so they put a
 
00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
grandfather clause in that was very
 
00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:43.510 align:start position:0%
grandfather clause in that was very
clear

00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
clear
 
00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
and this and that got
 
00:50:48.309 --> 00:50:48.319 align:start position:0%
hung up in court and so this does one
 
00:50:50.549 --> 00:50:50.559 align:start position:0%
thing it fixes that grandfather clause
 
00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
and the second thing it does is it
 
00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
tries to fix the problem with exclusion
 
00:50:57.750 --> 00:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
versus override so now i want to reject
 
00:51:00.069 --> 00:51:00.079 align:start position:0%
another thing which mayor donches sort
 
00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:02.720 align:start position:0%
of portrayed differently than i would
 
00:51:04.870 --> 00:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
the nashua spending cap as written is
 
00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
actually very simple it's not a
 
00:51:08.790 --> 00:51:08.800 align:start position:0%
complicated thing very simple it's
 
00:51:10.309 --> 00:51:10.319 align:start position:0%
actually only two sentences believe it
 
00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
or not
 
00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
one sentence actually
 
00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
specifies the override very simple
 
00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:16.710 align:start position:0%
specifies the override very simple
calculation

00:51:16.710 --> 00:51:16.720 align:start position:0%
calculation
 
00:51:18.790 --> 00:51:18.800 align:start position:0%
and then the next section heading is
 
00:51:21.829 --> 00:51:21.839 align:start position:0%
titled exceptions to the spending cap
 
00:51:24.309 --> 00:51:24.319 align:start position:0%
the title in the charter
 
00:51:26.470 --> 00:51:26.480 align:start position:0%
very explicitly says that this is how
 
00:51:29.829 --> 00:51:29.839 align:start position:0%
you ex exceptions to the spending cap
 
00:51:31.270 --> 00:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
you can tell from the title that its
 
00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
intent is as an exclusion as a weight as
 
00:51:35.589 --> 00:51:35.599 align:start position:0%
a relief valve
 
00:51:37.109 --> 00:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
they could have said relief valves to
 
00:51:39.109 --> 00:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
the spending cabin and the courts would
 
00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
have liked that word better
 
00:51:42.309 --> 00:51:42.319 align:start position:0%
that's in there where they talk about
 
00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
how to exclude things
 
00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:46.470 align:start position:0%
how to exclude things
so

00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
so let me read quickly my prepared
 
00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
statement the original version of the
 
00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
sb52 was a direct response to the
 
00:51:53.589 --> 00:51:53.599 align:start position:0%
supreme court and it had a lot of stuff
 
00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:58.710 --> 00:51:58.720 align:start position:0%
after its introduction with a senate
 
00:52:00.549 --> 00:52:00.559 align:start position:0%
after its introduction
 
00:52:02.069 --> 00:52:02.079 align:start position:0%
the senate attorney scrutinized the
 
00:52:02.079 --> 00:52:03.510 align:start position:0%
the senate attorney scrutinized the
language

00:52:03.510 --> 00:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
and offered some comments so the current
 
00:52:07.990 --> 00:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
version of sb52 is much simpler and
 
00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
incorporates the input from many parties
 
00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
excluding those and downs and existing
 
00:52:14.309 --> 00:52:14.319 align:start position:0%
caps now this is from listening into all
 
00:52:16.069 --> 00:52:16.079 align:start position:0%
these discussion
 
00:52:19.109 --> 00:52:19.119 align:start position:0%
it sounds like you know sb 52 and is
 
00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
written and we don't know it's all messy
 
00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:22.240 align:start position:0%
and complicated it's actually not
 
00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of thought that's
 
00:52:25.829 --> 00:52:25.839 align:start position:0%
gone since it was introducted into the
 
00:52:25.839 --> 00:52:27.109 align:start position:0%
gone since it was introducted into the
senate

00:52:27.109 --> 00:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
senate
 
00:52:27.119 --> 00:52:28.069 align:start position:0%
senate
and

00:52:28.069 --> 00:52:28.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of
 
00:52:32.710 --> 00:52:32.720 align:start position:0%
senator gray he was fastidious with us
 
00:52:34.549 --> 00:52:34.559 align:start position:0%
and making us he was cracking the whip
 
00:52:36.390 --> 00:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
and said you guys have got to get this
 
00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:37.349 align:start position:0%
and said you guys have got to get this
straight

00:52:37.349 --> 00:52:37.359 align:start position:0%
straight
 
00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:38.720 align:start position:0%
and so we worked with the senate
 
00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:40.720 align:start position:0%
attorney we sent it out all to the other
 
00:52:42.390 --> 00:52:42.400 align:start position:0%
cities that might be possibly be
 
00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:43.510 align:start position:0%
cities that might be possibly be
affected

00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
affected
 
00:52:45.510 --> 00:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
and got inputs back so this has gone
 
00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
through a lot of edits a lot of
 
00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
revisions and so this version is much
 
00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:52.640 align:start position:0%
simpler it's not perfect
 
00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:54.640 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying it's perfect and it's not
 
00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
all-encompassing so
 
00:52:59.190 --> 00:52:59.200 align:start position:0%
if if you're an opponent to spending
 
00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
caps you could still take take them to
 
00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
court if you wanted to in the future but
 
00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
at least this version fixes the stuff
 
00:53:07.349 --> 00:53:07.359 align:start position:0%
that we know are a problem
 
00:53:10.470 --> 00:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
and what it does is it puts the the
 
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
it does not create any new restrictions
 
00:53:13.589 --> 00:53:13.599 align:start position:0%
that's another thing that some people
 
00:53:13.599 --> 00:53:14.470 align:start position:0%
that's another thing that some people
may

00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
may
 
00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:16.720 align:start position:0%
may accidentally believe so senate
 
00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
senate bill 52 does not create any new
 
00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:20.390 align:start position:0%
senate bill 52 does not create any new
restrictions

00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
restrictions
 
00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
if you don't already have a spending cap
 
00:53:24.390 --> 00:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
it doesn't affect you in fact there's a
 
00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:26.720 align:start position:0%
question earlier somebody asked about
 
00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:28.640 align:start position:0%
what's the super majority of who is the
 
00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
super majority of the people or super
 
00:53:32.790 --> 00:53:32.800 align:start position:0%
majority of elected officials
 
00:53:34.309 --> 00:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
if you if
 
00:53:37.190 --> 00:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
you only have a spending cap if you have
 
00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
elected officials is the way the state
 
00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
law is written
 
00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
so this when it talks about requiring a
 
00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
super majority it's only in the context
 
00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:47.270 align:start position:0%
super majority it's only in the context
of

00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
if you already have a spending cap in on
 
00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
the books
 
00:53:52.950 --> 00:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
if you don't already have a spinning cap
 
00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
on the books then this sp52 doesn't even
 
00:53:56.790 --> 00:53:56.800 align:start position:0%
affect you
 
00:53:58.470 --> 00:53:58.480 align:start position:0%
so it does not create new restrictions
 
00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
it simply provides rigor to the existing
 
00:54:03.349 --> 00:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
statutes so thank you for
 
00:54:05.349 --> 00:54:05.359 align:start position:0%
your patience
 
00:54:07.510 --> 00:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
i apologize
 
00:54:08.950 --> 00:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
about the uh
 
00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:10.720 align:start position:0%
the muting issue
 
00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:16.480 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much
 
00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:18.160 align:start position:0%

uh representative steve if you have a
 
00:54:30.850 --> 00:54:30.860 align:start position:0%

[Music]

00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:54:35.430 --> 00:54:35.440 align:start position:0%
my apologies mr chair
 
00:54:38.309 --> 00:54:38.319 align:start position:0%
um it's a question in general based on
 
00:54:39.990 --> 00:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
several of the the folks who have
 
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.710 align:start position:0%
several of the the folks who have
testified

00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:44.240 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead
 
00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:45.109 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead
um

00:54:45.109 --> 00:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:47.349 --> 00:54:47.359 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
00:54:50.710 --> 00:54:50.720 align:start position:0%
we heard a lot of um
 
00:54:54.549 --> 00:54:54.559 align:start position:0%
testimony early on about the purest form
 
00:54:56.309 --> 00:54:56.319 align:start position:0%
of democracy
 
00:54:59.030 --> 00:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
and now we're hearing about people not
 
00:55:01.030 --> 00:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
trusting the aldermen
 
00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
in this particular city to do the right
 
00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:04.390 align:start position:0%
in this particular city to do the right
thing

00:55:04.390 --> 00:55:04.400 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
it isn't throwing them out and electing
 
00:55:10.069 --> 00:55:10.079 align:start position:0%
a new board of aldermen the purest form
 
00:55:11.589 --> 00:55:11.599 align:start position:0%
of democracy
 
00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
that's one question
 
00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:16.720 align:start position:0%
my second comment is that this committee
 
00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:17.670 align:start position:0%
my second comment is that this committee
sees

00:55:17.670 --> 00:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
sees
 
00:55:20.549 --> 00:55:20.559 align:start position:0%
many bills that come before for it
 
00:55:23.750 --> 00:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
that try to address specific issues in
 
00:55:26.710 --> 00:55:26.720 align:start position:0%
specific towns or cities
 
00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:28.640 align:start position:0%
and we have always made it a practice to
 
00:55:31.589 --> 00:55:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:34.549 --> 00:55:34.559 align:start position:0%
try to avoid using state legislation to
 
00:55:37.829 --> 00:55:37.839 align:start position:0%
solve a local problem
 
00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely i can answer both of those
 
00:55:42.790 --> 00:55:42.800 align:start position:0%
the second one i'll answer first and
 
00:55:45.589 --> 00:55:45.599 align:start position:0%
that that issue of it being appearing as
 
00:55:47.829 --> 00:55:47.839 align:start position:0%
a fix for nashua was one of the things
 
00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
that senator gray was very keen on he
 
00:55:52.150 --> 00:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
said we don't want to do that
 
00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:52.950 align:start position:0%
said we don't want to do that
and

00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:55:56.470 --> 00:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
the answer lies in the 2011
 
00:55:56.480 --> 00:55:57.910 align:start position:0%
the answer lies in the 2011
legislature

00:55:57.910 --> 00:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:56:00.069 --> 00:56:00.079 align:start position:0%
so nashua had already
 
00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
crafted a spending cap and it was fine
 
00:56:03.910 --> 00:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
all by itself
 
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
it was simple spending cap and a simple
 
00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
exception to the spending cap you know
 
00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
and then it was after the fact that
 
00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:13.280 align:start position:0%
other cities manchester had a spending
 
00:56:16.069 --> 00:56:16.079 align:start position:0%
cap and people in manchester
 
00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
took manchester to court
 
00:56:19.750 --> 00:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
people who didn't like the spending cap
 
00:56:22.470 --> 00:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
in manchester went to court and said
 
00:56:24.230 --> 00:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
this is wrong and then the legislature
 
00:56:26.549 --> 00:56:26.559 align:start position:0%
tried to fix manchester's problem and in
 
00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
the process of the legislature trying to
 
00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
fix manchester's problem they they broke
 
00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
nash with a spending cap
 
00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:34.470 align:start position:0%
nash with a spending cap
so

00:56:34.470 --> 00:56:34.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
and then you then if you look statewide
 
00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
at other spending caps they all have
 
00:56:39.990 --> 00:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
their own
 
00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
their own
 
00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:42.150 align:start position:0%
their own
unique

00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
unique
 
00:56:45.430 --> 00:56:45.440 align:start position:0%
verbiage but the legislature
 
00:56:48.150 --> 00:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
so what we have here is the legislature
 
00:56:52.230 --> 00:56:52.240 align:start position:0%
needs to fix the problem it created
 
00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
that's what we need to do
 
00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:55.510 align:start position:0%
that's what we need to do
so

00:56:55.510 --> 00:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:56:58.230 --> 00:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
it's not the legislature fixing nashua's
 
00:57:00.390 --> 00:57:00.400 align:start position:0%
problem it's the legislature fixing a
 
00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:02.720 align:start position:0%
problem that it created trying to solve
 
00:57:04.710 --> 00:57:04.720 align:start position:0%
manchester's problem and broke nashua's
 
00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:05.589 align:start position:0%
manchester's problem and broke nashua's
problem

00:57:05.589 --> 00:57:05.599 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:57:07.750 --> 00:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
so then back to the period purest form
 
00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:14.069 --> 00:57:14.079 align:start position:0%
yes indeed uh you could vote them out
 
00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
and in fact right now the board of
 
00:57:17.349 --> 00:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
aldermen frankly you know what's the
 
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
effect of this fb-52 is going to be very
 
00:57:22.069 --> 00:57:22.079 align:start position:0%
little in the near future because
 
00:57:24.150 --> 00:57:24.160 align:start position:0%
on the board of all them you've got 15
 
00:57:27.670 --> 00:57:27.680 align:start position:0%
aldermen that all like-minded uh
 
00:57:29.030 --> 00:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
and so they're gonna they're gonna have
 
00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:30.640 align:start position:0%
their super their
 
00:57:32.870 --> 00:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
nashua board of aldermen is gonna have
 
00:57:34.630 --> 00:57:34.640 align:start position:0%
no problem whatsoever having a super
 
00:57:37.270 --> 00:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
majority for the near future
 
00:57:39.510 --> 00:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
but that's the way it works out but the
 
00:57:41.030 --> 00:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
essence of
 
00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
when things are close
 
00:57:46.789 --> 00:57:46.799 align:start position:0%
when you have a it's not 90 10 liberal
 
00:57:50.549 --> 00:57:50.559 align:start position:0%
conservative in nashua it's only 51.49
 
00:57:52.390 --> 00:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
so the whole purpose of having super
 
00:57:54.309 --> 00:57:54.319 align:start position:0%
majorities at all and having a spending
 
00:57:56.470 --> 00:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
cap and the people who wrote the laws at
 
00:57:58.710 --> 00:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
the state level the spending cap
 
00:58:01.829 --> 00:58:01.839 align:start position:0%
but they just wanted to have a
 
00:58:04.069 --> 00:58:04.079 align:start position:0%
a level a higher level a threshold a
 
00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
higher threshold so when it's a close
 
00:58:07.910 --> 00:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
call in the electorate when the people
 
00:58:09.910 --> 00:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
of nashua are 50 50 or the people in
 
00:58:13.589 --> 00:58:13.599 align:start position:0%
manchester 48 52 or the people in these
 
00:58:17.589 --> 00:58:17.599 align:start position:0%
cities it's it's a it's just a majority
 
00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
we recognize that in those cases to have
 
00:58:23.910 --> 00:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
something that's a major significance
 
00:58:26.309 --> 00:58:26.319 align:start position:0%
that a super majority is a good way to
 
00:58:28.710 --> 00:58:28.720 align:start position:0%
go and hence the spending caps require
 
00:58:32.710 --> 00:58:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:35.270 --> 00:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
our next question comes from
 
00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
alicia houston who would you like to
 
00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:38.390 align:start position:0%

direct

00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
direct
 
00:58:48.069 --> 00:58:48.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:50.710 --> 00:58:50.720 align:start position:0%
can you hear hear me
 
00:58:52.710 --> 00:58:52.720 align:start position:0%

so

00:59:07.750 --> 00:59:07.760 align:start position:0%

00:59:42.549 --> 00:59:42.559 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to speak um i
 
00:59:44.470 --> 00:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to speak today in support of
 
00:59:46.470 --> 00:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
senate bill 52
 
00:59:48.870 --> 00:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
i am a lifelong new hampshire resident
 
00:59:51.430 --> 00:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
and a mother of two children and at this
 
00:59:54.309 --> 00:59:54.319 align:start position:0%
time we have an ideology in many cities
 
00:59:56.870 --> 00:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
and towns there is a limitless amount of
 
00:59:59.030 --> 00:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
funds available to continue growing a
 
01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
budget outside
 
01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
of their
 
01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
previously set budgets now as a nashua
 
01:00:07.349 --> 01:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
resident and a mother of two district
 
01:00:09.670 --> 01:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
children the excuse of free or reduced
 
01:00:12.630 --> 01:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
hot lunch is a fallacy the true issue in
 
01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
these regards for clarification as
 
01:00:16.390 --> 01:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
understood by teachers is that the free
 
01:00:19.270 --> 01:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
or reduced hot lunch forms are sent
 
01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
home many times with the mandate of
 
01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.190 align:start position:0%
home many times with the mandate of
remote

01:00:23.190 --> 01:00:23.200 align:start position:0%
remote
 
01:00:25.829 --> 01:00:25.839 align:start position:0%
learning over a year it was merely
 
01:00:25.839 --> 01:00:27.109 align:start position:0%
learning over a year it was merely
impossible

01:00:27.109 --> 01:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
impossible
 
01:00:28.870 --> 01:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
as a feat given that many of our
 
01:00:31.349 --> 01:00:31.359 align:start position:0%
district children in those lower income
 
01:00:33.270 --> 01:00:33.280 align:start position:0%
locations did not have access to
 
01:00:35.349 --> 01:00:35.359 align:start position:0%
technology and still remain without
 
01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
access that fell on the responsibility
 
01:00:39.349 --> 01:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
of the district who failed to provide
 
01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
many with those necessary accesses mayor
 
01:00:45.030 --> 01:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
manchester's incorrect with regards to
 
01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:47.200 align:start position:0%
to that additionally this further proves
 
01:00:49.589 --> 01:00:49.599 align:start position:0%
the need to hold our cities and towns
 
01:00:49.599 --> 01:00:50.789 align:start position:0%
the need to hold our cities and towns
accountable

01:00:50.789 --> 01:00:50.799 align:start position:0%
accountable
 
01:00:52.390 --> 01:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
to remove the idea that money is
 
01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
limitless and that budgets mean nothing
 
01:00:56.789 --> 01:00:56.799 align:start position:0%
i encourage you all to view this as a
 
01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
bigger picture taking nashua aside many
 
01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
many new hampshire residents and cities
 
01:01:03.829 --> 01:01:03.839 align:start position:0%
and towns
 
01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
face the same struggles and challenges
 
01:01:08.549 --> 01:01:08.559 align:start position:0%
although budgets are previously set and
 
01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:10.480 align:start position:0%
are encouraged to be followed i
 
01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
encourage you all to view the big
 
01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:13.109 align:start position:0%
encourage you all to view the big
picture

01:01:13.109 --> 01:01:13.119 align:start position:0%
picture
 
01:01:14.789 --> 01:01:14.799 align:start position:0%
many new hampshire residents in their
 
01:01:16.710 --> 01:01:16.720 align:start position:0%
respective cities and towns fall into
 
01:01:18.789 --> 01:01:18.799 align:start position:0%
the same predicament we are in here in
 
01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
nashua this is a universal problem not
 
01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
specific to nashua
 
01:01:25.829 --> 01:01:25.839 align:start position:0%
this is a matter of accountability this
 
01:01:27.990 --> 01:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
is helping the new hampshire residents
 
01:01:30.549 --> 01:01:30.559 align:start position:0%
this is a means for us as citizens and
 
01:01:32.510 --> 01:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
voters to have a means to hold our
 
01:01:34.630 --> 01:01:34.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities accountable
 
01:01:36.789 --> 01:01:36.799 align:start position:0%
in many areas throughout new hampshire
 
01:01:39.270 --> 01:01:39.280 align:start position:0%
voters and taxpayers are at risk to have
 
01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
local spending caps exceed those budgets
 
01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
that were previously set without our
 
01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
ability as citizens taxpayers and voters
 
01:01:49.349 --> 01:01:49.359 align:start position:0%
throughout many cities and towns we are
 
01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:52.240 align:start position:0%
unable to hold our cities accountable i
 
01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
beg you to support senate bill 52
 
01:01:58.069 --> 01:01:58.079 align:start position:0%
not just for nashua but for all of our
 
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities and our elected officials
 
01:02:02.309 --> 01:02:02.319 align:start position:0%
who fail to realize that once you have
 
01:02:04.069 --> 01:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
committed to a budget that is a
 
01:02:05.750 --> 01:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
commitment you are making to your
 
01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:07.910 align:start position:0%
commitment you are making to your
constituents

01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
constituents

thank you thank you very much mr
 
01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
chairman um the second part of the
 
01:06:20.950 --> 01:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
omnibus bill would amend current statute
 
01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
to enable a municipality to charge a fee
 
01:06:25.829 --> 01:06:25.839 align:start position:0%
for any financial remittance issued to
 
01:06:28.390 --> 01:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
the municipality municipality excuse me
 
01:06:31.430 --> 01:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
that is returned as uncollectible
 
01:06:35.829 --> 01:06:35.839 align:start position:0%
current law rsa 80 colon 56 only provide
 
01:06:38.309 --> 01:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
the ability for municipalities to charge
 
01:06:41.029 --> 01:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
a fee for checks returned to the city or
 
01:06:44.150 --> 01:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
town is uncollectible no other form of
 
01:06:46.390 --> 01:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
financial remittance is identified in
 
01:06:48.230 --> 01:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
the current statute
 
01:06:50.069 --> 01:06:50.079 align:start position:0%
with more and more services by cities
 
01:06:52.470 --> 01:06:52.480 align:start position:0%
and towns being conducted through online
 
01:06:55.589 --> 01:06:55.599 align:start position:0%
transactions payments for services
 
01:06:57.589 --> 01:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
are being made by methods other than
 
01:06:59.109 --> 01:06:59.119 align:start position:0%
paper checks
 
01:07:01.510 --> 01:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
financial transactions can be done by
 
01:07:04.069 --> 01:07:04.079 align:start position:0%
eight ch transactions
 
01:07:07.670 --> 01:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
electronic fund transfers or efts
 
01:07:09.829 --> 01:07:09.839 align:start position:0%
credit card payment and other electronic
 
01:07:12.150 --> 01:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
means despite the convenience of the
 
01:07:14.150 --> 01:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
electronic payments they are not
 
01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:15.270 align:start position:0%
electronic payments they are not
foolproof

01:07:15.270 --> 01:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
foolproof
 
01:07:17.670 --> 01:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
and can be returned as uncollectible in
 
01:07:21.029 --> 01:07:21.039 align:start position:0%
the same manner that a check can
 
01:07:23.029 --> 01:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
many municipalities have learned this
 
01:07:25.589 --> 01:07:25.599 align:start position:0%
during the past year as we transitioned
 
01:07:28.150 --> 01:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
to more online services and transactions
 
01:07:31.430 --> 01:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
as a result of of the covet issues
 
01:07:34.390 --> 01:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:36.710 --> 01:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
at this point um
 
01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
the request is to amend to broaden the
 
01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
means of
 
01:07:43.510 --> 01:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
payment municipalities received to
 
01:07:45.829 --> 01:07:45.839 align:start position:0%
enable us to collect a fee for any form
 
01:07:47.670 --> 01:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
of financial payment
 
01:07:49.430 --> 01:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
and at that point
 
01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i will conclude my testimony
 
01:07:53.430 --> 01:07:53.440 align:start position:0%

association

01:07:56.470 --> 01:07:56.480 align:start position:0%

01:08:06.069 --> 01:08:06.079 align:start position:0%
chairman and the committee for your time
 
01:08:07.349 --> 01:08:07.359 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
01:08:09.270 --> 01:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you senator i
 
01:08:11.349 --> 01:08:11.359 align:start position:0%
appreciate the time uh you sent it are
 
01:08:13.589 --> 01:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
there any questions for senator carlson
 
01:08:15.430 --> 01:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you senator
 
01:08:19.269 --> 01:08:19.279 align:start position:0%
carson for taking my question my
 
01:08:20.950 --> 01:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
question um
 
01:08:23.269 --> 01:08:23.279 align:start position:0%
pertains to line nine
 
01:08:26.550 --> 01:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
where the language in the text says that
 
01:08:29.910 --> 01:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
the fee together with other fees
 
01:08:32.789 --> 01:08:32.799 align:start position:0%
shall be for the use of the city or town
 
01:08:34.870 --> 01:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
the use of the city or town is very
 
01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:36.309 align:start position:0%
the use of the city or town is very
non-specific

01:08:36.309 --> 01:08:36.319 align:start position:0%
non-specific
 
01:08:39.349 --> 01:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to verify therefore
 
01:08:41.829 --> 01:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
that it would be up to the discretion of
 
01:08:44.950 --> 01:08:44.960 align:start position:0%
the city or town as to what fund and
 
01:08:47.110 --> 01:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
where that money would would be
 
01:08:50.950 --> 01:08:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:52.470 --> 01:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your question
 
01:08:54.789 --> 01:08:54.799 align:start position:0%
representative it is my understanding
 
01:08:57.829 --> 01:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
yes that once the fee is collected it is
 
01:09:00.709 --> 01:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
um up to the town to decide where that
 
01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
money is to go but again there are folks

and
 
01:09:51.110 --> 01:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
we believe the passage of this part of
 
01:09:52.149 --> 01:09:52.159 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
would assist our time with meeting its

economic development goals to the
 
01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:56.790 align:start position:0%
economic development goals to the
benefit

01:09:56.790 --> 01:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
01:09:58.390 --> 01:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
of our residents and the residents of
 
01:10:00.229 --> 01:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire you know the
 
01:10:02.070 --> 01:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
town a few years ago was approached by
 
01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
the department of environmental services
 
01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
to participate in the southern new
 
01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire regional water interconnection
 
01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:09.910 align:start position:0%
hampshire regional water interconnection
project

01:10:09.910 --> 01:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
project
 
01:10:10.870 --> 01:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
which is an
 
01:10:12.870 --> 01:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
ambitious project which now provides
 
01:10:15.830 --> 01:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
water generated by the manchester water
 
01:10:19.189 --> 01:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
to communities south and east of derry
 
01:10:22.390 --> 01:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
and derry's uh pre-existing robust water
 
01:10:24.070 --> 01:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
system infrastructure
 
01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
is now also being used to convey water
 
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
from manchester point south
 
01:10:31.110 --> 01:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
you know as we all know state fiscal
 
01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
policy requires
 
01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
towns and cities to rely upon its
 
01:10:37.350 --> 01:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
property tax base to fund a majority of
 
01:10:39.669 --> 01:10:39.679 align:start position:0%
local services with this in mind
 
01:10:42.070 --> 01:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
our town council is initially
 
01:10:44.470 --> 01:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
somewhat apprehensive to share
 
01:10:47.110 --> 01:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
one of our critical economic development
 
01:10:49.669 --> 01:10:49.679 align:start position:0%
our water system with the region
 
01:10:51.510 --> 01:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
but the council also wanted to be good
 
01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
neighbors and help ensure that an ample
 
01:10:55.510 --> 01:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
supply of clean quality water was
 
01:10:57.510 --> 01:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
available to the region
 
01:10:59.910 --> 01:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
as the into municipal agreement
 
01:11:02.149 --> 01:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
governing this partnership was developed
 
01:11:04.070 --> 01:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
the town looked for opportunities that
 
01:11:06.550 --> 01:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
the town would not be adversely impacted
 
01:11:09.430 --> 01:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
economically by its participation
 
01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
during these discussions the council
 
01:11:13.750 --> 01:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
became comfortable with this partnership
 
01:11:16.229 --> 01:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
as began to identify other economic
 
01:11:18.149 --> 01:11:18.159 align:start position:0%
development tools which may become
 
01:11:19.750 --> 01:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
available through the availability of
 
01:11:21.990 --> 01:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
wheeling revenues
 
01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
rsa 38 which is the state law governing
 
01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
water systems currently restricts all
 
01:11:29.189 --> 01:11:29.199 align:start position:0%
revenues to the water fund
 
01:11:32.229 --> 01:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
as the statute never contemplated such a
 
01:11:34.870 --> 01:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
project as this and its potential impact
 
01:11:37.669 --> 01:11:37.679 align:start position:0%
upon regional economic development
 
01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
passage of this bill will allow the town
 
01:11:41.990 --> 01:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
to further expand its economic
 
01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
opportunities by investing in various
 
01:11:47.030 --> 01:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
initiatives whether it be the extension
 
01:11:48.950 --> 01:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
of municipal soared to areas of the town
 
01:11:50.550 --> 01:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
currently not serviced
 
01:11:52.790 --> 01:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
or by participation
 
01:11:54.470 --> 01:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
in the various economic development
 
01:11:57.270 --> 01:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
activities as authorized under the
 
01:11:59.270 --> 01:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
industrial land facilities statute as
 
01:12:01.430 --> 01:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
well as the municipal economic
 
01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
development and revitalization district
 
01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:05.350 align:start position:0%
development and revitalization district
statute

01:12:05.350 --> 01:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
of course our first obligation is
 
01:12:08.950 --> 01:12:08.960 align:start position:0%
priority we will continue to guarantee
 
01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
that our water system
 
01:12:13.030 --> 01:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
has the resources necessary to perform
 
01:12:15.189 --> 01:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
under this intermissible agreement and
 
01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
to protect our system's integrity
 
01:12:19.750 --> 01:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
it is envisioned any excess funds would
 
01:12:21.510 --> 01:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
then be invested into the town's
 
01:12:24.070 --> 01:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
economic development opportunities
 
01:12:26.149 --> 01:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
this plan of action benefits both our
 
01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
water customers and the dairy property
 
01:12:30.630 --> 01:12:30.640 align:start position:0%
taxpayers who have shared the town's
 
01:12:33.669 --> 01:12:33.679 align:start position:0%
bond rating and capacity as well as
 
01:12:35.830 --> 01:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
other resources over the years to assist
 
01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
with the water system's growth
 
01:12:39.990 --> 01:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
reliability and financial strength
 
01:12:41.669 --> 01:12:41.679 align:start position:0%

municipal agreement and not everybody's
 
01:15:02.310 --> 01:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
water and sewer systems all over the
 
01:15:05.270 --> 01:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
state can you give me that assurance
 
01:15:08.149 --> 01:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh for your question uh
 
01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh two things one is that
 
01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:12.390 align:start position:0%
uh two things one is that
uh

01:15:12.390 --> 01:15:12.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:15:15.350 --> 01:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
we have an obligation first to make sure
 
01:15:17.590 --> 01:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
that our water system is robust
 
01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
second uh when we were working with
 
01:15:21.590 --> 01:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
senator birds on this bill
 
01:15:24.070 --> 01:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
uh all felt comfortable putting guard
 
01:15:26.790 --> 01:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
rails around the use of excess revenues
 
01:15:29.350 --> 01:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
therefore we've included uh language in
 
01:15:31.510 --> 01:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
the proposed bill which would limit that
 
01:15:34.470 --> 01:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
to economic development uh activities
 
01:15:38.630 --> 01:15:38.640 align:start position:0%
uh within the the town of derry and
 
01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:39.910 align:start position:0%
uh within the the town of derry and
regarding

01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
01:15:42.310 --> 01:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
regarding fees it should be noted that
 
01:15:44.709 --> 01:15:44.719 align:start position:0%
our water fees are and it's really
 
01:15:47.350 --> 01:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
predicated on on our water fees
 
01:15:49.990 --> 01:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
are in the lower uh lower of the 30th
 
01:15:51.590 --> 01:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
percentile in the state so we have a
 
01:15:54.149 --> 01:15:54.159 align:start position:0%
very robust water system our water fees
 
01:15:56.070 --> 01:15:56.080 align:start position:0%
are low so
 
01:15:58.870 --> 01:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
this wheeling charge is already in place
 
01:16:00.550 --> 01:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
it's just a just a matter now of
 
01:16:03.430 --> 01:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
requesting legislative approval to
 
01:16:05.430 --> 01:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
expand the use of proportional proceeds
 
01:16:07.030 --> 01:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
for economic development purposes in
 
01:16:09.910 --> 01:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
dairy i hope i answered your question
 
01:16:13.030 --> 01:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
can i have a follow-up just follow-up
 
01:16:15.590 --> 01:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
you sort of did but not really i live in
 
01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
hillsboro we're not part of an
 
01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:19.189 align:start position:0%
hillsboro we're not part of an
intermunicipal

01:16:19.189 --> 01:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
intermunicipal
 
01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:25.030 --> 01:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
if this
 
01:16:26.950 --> 01:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
clause passes
 
01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
will my water department be able to use
 
01:16:32.870 --> 01:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
the fees and revenue that it has for
 
01:16:34.550 --> 01:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
buying street lights
 
01:16:36.229 --> 01:16:36.239 align:start position:0%
okay i understand thank you no they will
 
01:16:38.550 --> 01:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
not and you know when again we crafted
 
01:16:39.510 --> 01:16:39.520 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh we were really concerned about the
 
01:16:43.830 --> 01:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
world of unintended consequences
 
01:16:45.990 --> 01:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
therefore if you look at the bill it is
 
01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
an arrow the stat the stat the statue in
 
01:16:49.669 --> 01:16:49.679 align:start position:0%
front of you but it's limited to
 
01:16:51.910 --> 01:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
communities which have a charter under
 
01:16:55.830 --> 01:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
49 i think it's d32a i can't recall
 
01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:56.790 align:start position:0%
49 i think it's d32a i can't recall
frankly

01:16:56.790 --> 01:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
frankly
 
01:16:59.110 --> 01:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
but there's only two uh units of
 
01:17:02.070 --> 01:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
government which which has that uh has
 
01:17:03.590 --> 01:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
that form of government and that is the
 
01:17:04.870 --> 01:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
towns of
 
01:17:07.030 --> 01:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
derry and durham
 
01:17:08.709 --> 01:17:08.719 align:start position:0%
and i've spoken with the town manager of
 
01:17:10.709 --> 01:17:10.719 align:start position:0%
durham to explain what we're doing he
 
01:17:12.390 --> 01:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
was comfortable with our approach and
 
01:17:15.350 --> 01:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
confirmed or not impact uh his operation
 
01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
so that's why we put the additional guy
 
01:17:19.189 --> 01:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
rails around this legislation thank you
 
01:17:21.830 --> 01:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
very much that does answer my question
 
01:17:24.470 --> 01:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
and also uh
 
01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:26.070 align:start position:0%
and also uh
quoting

01:17:26.070 --> 01:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
quoting
 
01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
rsa it's rsa 49b31
 
01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:17:34.790 --> 01:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh any other questions
 
01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:36.870 align:start position:0%
uh any other questions
yes

01:17:36.870 --> 01:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:17:38.790 --> 01:17:38.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:17:41.830 --> 01:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question mr karen
 
01:17:45.030 --> 01:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
i was curious to understand um with
 
01:17:48.630 --> 01:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
under part 1 on line 17
 
01:17:49.830 --> 01:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
how the
 
01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:51.189 align:start position:0%
how the
50

01:17:51.189 --> 01:17:51.199 align:start position:0%
50
 
01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
um was arrived at
 
01:17:55.990 --> 01:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
so my understanding um
 
01:17:57.590 --> 01:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:18:00.390 --> 01:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
no more than 50 percent of the water
 
01:18:01.990 --> 01:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
wheeling charges
 
01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:03.590 align:start position:0%
wheeling charges
um

01:18:03.590 --> 01:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:07.590 --> 01:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
shall be used for other purposes
 
01:18:09.510 --> 01:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
cited here in
 
01:18:11.590 --> 01:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:12.709 align:start position:0%
the bill
um

01:18:12.709 --> 01:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:15.669 --> 01:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
other than the um
 
01:18:19.350 --> 01:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
the maintenance and upkeep of the water
 
01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:20.790 align:start position:0%
the maintenance and upkeep of the water
system

01:18:20.790 --> 01:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:22.310 align:start position:0%
system
so

01:18:22.310 --> 01:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious to understand
 
01:18:27.669 --> 01:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
um where the 50 came from
 
01:18:29.590 --> 01:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you uh for the question
 
01:18:31.510 --> 01:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
representative there's there's no real
 
01:18:34.149 --> 01:18:34.159 align:start position:0%
magic formula to that number uh when we
 
01:18:35.910 --> 01:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
first approached senator birdsall about
 
01:18:37.750 --> 01:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
this and spoke with the
 
01:18:39.510 --> 01:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
senate legislative services they felt it
 
01:18:40.790 --> 01:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
was appropriate
 
01:18:44.310 --> 01:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
uh to ensure that a a minimum amount of
 
01:18:47.110 --> 01:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
funds stayed in the water fund and so
 
01:18:49.430 --> 01:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
all felt comfortable with no more than
 
01:18:51.990 --> 01:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
50 percent being transferred out of the
 
01:18:53.430 --> 01:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
waterfront for economic development
 
01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:56.149 align:start position:0%
waterfront for economic development
purposes

01:18:56.149 --> 01:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:57.669 --> 01:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:18:59.830 --> 01:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr karen
 
01:19:02.709 --> 01:19:02.719 align:start position:0%
next we have senator bradley to speak to
 
01:19:07.350 --> 01:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:10.149 --> 01:19:10.159 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chair how are you
 
01:19:12.310 --> 01:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
good good lisa
 
01:19:14.630 --> 01:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
please go right ahead you have the floor
 
01:19:17.030 --> 01:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much um
 
01:19:20.630 --> 01:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
i was asked by the town of sandwich to
 
01:19:22.630 --> 01:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
submit this legislation
 
01:19:25.270 --> 01:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
that would allow more flexibility
 
01:19:28.470 --> 01:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
for a lease purchase agreement
 
01:19:29.990 --> 01:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
they worked with the municipal
 
01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.990 align:start position:0%
they worked with the municipal
association

01:19:31.990 --> 01:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
association
 
01:19:33.510 --> 01:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:19:36.709 --> 01:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
was on the docket a year ago and it got
 
01:19:39.189 --> 01:19:39.199 align:start position:0%
caught up in the covid um
 
01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
situation where a lot of things got
 
01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:42.070 align:start position:0%
situation where a lot of things got
tabled

01:19:42.070 --> 01:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
tabled
 
01:19:45.910 --> 01:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
so i'm bringing it back again and as
 
01:19:49.110 --> 01:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
senator carson said
 
01:19:51.030 --> 01:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
i'm sure somebody from the municipal
 
01:19:53.750 --> 01:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
association can better answer
 
01:19:55.910 --> 01:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh your questions the other thing i
 
01:19:57.830 --> 01:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
would add
 
01:20:00.149 --> 01:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
we have the nhma on right after you at

you want to take more testimony on the
 
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
first section because senator burnsville
 
01:20:09.669 --> 01:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
um is not
 
01:20:12.950 --> 01:20:12.960 align:start position:0%

with regard to part three i was curious
 
01:20:52.950 --> 01:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
to understand
 
01:20:56.630 --> 01:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
um the rationale for striking out lines
 
01:21:00.470 --> 01:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:02.149 --> 01:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
01:21:06.709 --> 01:21:06.719 align:start position:0%
uh representative best for you to ask um
 
01:21:08.709 --> 01:21:08.719 align:start position:0%
the municipal association this is the
 
01:21:11.350 --> 01:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
way the town of sandwich proposed it to
 
01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:12.229 align:start position:0%
way the town of sandwich proposed it to
me

01:21:12.229 --> 01:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:21:12.239 --> 01:21:13.189 align:start position:0%
me
um

um
 
01:21:14.830 --> 01:21:14.840 align:start position:0%
in the particular
 
01:21:17.350 --> 01:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
particularities of how they conduct
 
01:21:19.110 --> 01:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
their town meeting and that's what they
 
01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:21.910 align:start position:0%
their town meeting and that's what they
requested

01:21:21.910 --> 01:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:23.669 --> 01:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
thank you senator i appreciate your time
 
01:21:26.229 --> 01:21:26.239 align:start position:0%
today and uh next up we'll talk to
 
01:21:30.709 --> 01:21:30.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:32.950 --> 01:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
01:21:34.390 --> 01:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
cordell johnson representing new
 
01:21:36.950 --> 01:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire municipal association
 
01:21:40.229 --> 01:21:40.239 align:start position:0%
and i actually uh am testifying in
 
01:21:43.430 --> 01:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
support of all three parts of the bill
 
01:21:45.350 --> 01:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
uh and i know we're sort of jumping
 
01:21:47.189 --> 01:21:47.199 align:start position:0%
around a little bit
 
01:21:49.270 --> 01:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
um but i think i can do it pretty
 
01:21:53.030 --> 01:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
quickly part one uh simply uh we support
 
01:21:56.229 --> 01:21:56.239 align:start position:0%
it um it's really uh as dave karen
 
01:21:58.790 --> 01:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
indicated it's really limited at this
 
01:22:01.510 --> 01:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
point to the town of derry and it only
 
01:22:03.510 --> 01:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
affects a town that would be part of an
 
01:22:05.669 --> 01:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
inter-municipal agreement so i don't
 
01:22:07.510 --> 01:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
really have anything more to say on part
 
01:22:10.629 --> 01:22:10.639 align:start position:0%
one just to register our support for it
 
01:22:13.629 --> 01:22:13.639 align:start position:0%
um part two i think is pretty
 
01:22:15.590 --> 01:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
self-explanatory and i know you have a
 
01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
letter from um
 
01:22:19.910 --> 01:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
from the uh town administrator for the
 
01:22:21.590 --> 01:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
town of auburn
 
01:22:24.550 --> 01:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
uh and that is just bringing
 
01:22:27.990 --> 01:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
that statute into the uh
 
01:22:31.270 --> 01:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
into the 21st century to allow
 
01:22:33.910 --> 01:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
uh a municipality to collect
 
01:22:37.430 --> 01:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh a charge on unpaid remittances that
 
01:22:39.910 --> 01:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
are that are made electronically
 
01:22:42.470 --> 01:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh as opposed to the current statute
 
01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:43.430 align:start position:0%
uh as opposed to the current statute
which

01:22:43.430 --> 01:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:22:45.830 --> 01:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
only allows them for um
 
01:22:48.070 --> 01:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
those that are that are paid by check
 
01:22:50.310 --> 01:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
and uh obviously
 
01:22:53.270 --> 01:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
there's a lot more electronic fund uh
 
01:22:56.629 --> 01:22:56.639 align:start position:0%
uh payments these days
 
01:22:58.629 --> 01:22:58.639 align:start position:0%
and then on part three which uh may
 
01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:00.719 align:start position:0%
require a little more explanation but i
 
01:23:03.510 --> 01:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
i do believe there is also someone
 
01:23:05.350 --> 01:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
from the town of sandwich who has signed
 
01:23:08.950 --> 01:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
up to testify christopher bolt
 
01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:09.750 align:start position:0%
up to testify christopher bolt
but

01:23:09.750 --> 01:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:23:12.310 --> 01:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
basically part three
 
01:23:14.870 --> 01:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
deals with the use of capital reserve
 
01:23:18.390 --> 01:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
funds to make payments on a
 
01:23:21.590 --> 01:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
under a lease purchase agreement
 
01:23:24.709 --> 01:23:24.719 align:start position:0%
so a town can can establish a capital
 
01:23:27.990 --> 01:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
reserve fund and those are used uh to
 
01:23:30.310 --> 01:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
pay for
 
01:23:32.390 --> 01:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
major purchases like building
 
01:23:34.950 --> 01:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
construction or buying a large piece of
 
01:23:38.070 --> 01:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
equipment and various other things
 
01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:38.950 align:start position:0%
equipment and various other things
and

01:23:38.950 --> 01:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:23:41.910 --> 01:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
the current law
 
01:23:45.990 --> 01:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
allows the um a capital reserve fund to
 
01:23:49.110 --> 01:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
be used
 
01:23:51.750 --> 01:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
to to make payments under a lease
 
01:23:54.070 --> 01:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
purchase agreement but only under
 
01:23:56.870 --> 01:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
certain lease purchase agreements
 
01:24:00.070 --> 01:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
and there are two basic kinds of lease
 
01:24:01.590 --> 01:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
purchase agreements
 
01:24:05.310 --> 01:24:05.320 align:start position:0%
one is one that contains a
 
01:24:07.510 --> 01:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
non-appropriation clause
 
01:24:10.870 --> 01:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
also known as an escape clause
 
01:24:12.950 --> 01:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
a non-appropriation clause is a
 
01:24:15.430 --> 01:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
provision in the agreement that says
 
01:24:19.590 --> 01:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
if the town fails to appropriate money
 
01:24:22.310 --> 01:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
in any given year to make that year's
 
01:24:24.709 --> 01:24:24.719 align:start position:0%
payments under the agreement
 
01:24:27.270 --> 01:24:27.280 align:start position:0%
then the contract essentially is
 
01:24:30.149 --> 01:24:30.159 align:start position:0%
terminated it allows the town to get out
 
01:24:31.189 --> 01:24:31.199 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:24:34.390 --> 01:24:34.400 align:start position:0%
uh lease purchase agreement by by not
 
01:24:37.030 --> 01:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
making the appropriation
 
01:24:38.790 --> 01:24:38.800 align:start position:0%
and those kinds of lease purchase
 
01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:39.990 align:start position:0%
and those kinds of lease purchase
agreements

01:24:39.990 --> 01:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
agreements
 
01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
can be approved by a town meeting by a
 
01:24:45.110 --> 01:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
simple majority vote
 
01:24:46.310 --> 01:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
the other kind
 
01:24:49.990 --> 01:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
does not have a non-appropriation clause
 
01:24:51.590 --> 01:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
it's basically
 
01:24:52.629 --> 01:24:52.639 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:24:54.790 --> 01:24:54.800 align:start position:0%
the town does not have the ability to
 
01:24:56.709 --> 01:24:56.719 align:start position:0%
get out of it by
 
01:24:59.910 --> 01:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh by failing to make an appropriation
 
01:25:02.790 --> 01:25:02.800 align:start position:0%
that is treated as long-term debt and it
 
01:25:04.390 --> 01:25:04.400 align:start position:0%
requires a
 
01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:05.990 align:start position:0%
requires a
vote

01:25:05.990 --> 01:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
vote
 
01:25:07.910 --> 01:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
voter approval a two-thirds voter
 
01:25:10.830 --> 01:25:10.840 align:start position:0%
approval at town
 
01:25:14.870 --> 01:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
meeting so the current statute allows
 
01:25:18.070 --> 01:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
the use of capital reserve funds to make
 
01:25:19.590 --> 01:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
payments under a lease purchase
 
01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:20.629 align:start position:0%
payments under a lease purchase
agreement

01:25:20.629 --> 01:25:20.639 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
01:25:23.430 --> 01:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
only if the lease purchase agreement
 
01:25:25.910 --> 01:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
does not contain a non-appropriation
 
01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:26.950 align:start position:0%
does not contain a non-appropriation
clause

01:25:26.950 --> 01:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
clause
 
01:25:29.910 --> 01:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
and has been approved by a two-thirds
 
01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:31.910 align:start position:0%
and has been approved by a two-thirds
vote

01:25:31.910 --> 01:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
vote
 
01:25:34.950 --> 01:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
and in reviewing this
 
01:25:37.510 --> 01:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
we couldn't come up with a reason
 
01:25:40.390 --> 01:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
to have it limited in that way
 
01:25:44.470 --> 01:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:46.709 --> 01:25:46.719 align:start position:0%
have become a very popular way of
 
01:25:49.590 --> 01:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
financing purchases of
 
01:25:52.229 --> 01:25:52.239 align:start position:0%
especially large pieces of equipment
 
01:25:54.390 --> 01:25:54.400 align:start position:0%
and it just simply doesn't uh there
 
01:25:56.870 --> 01:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to be any reason to
 
01:25:58.870 --> 01:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
limit the use of capital reserve funds
 
01:26:02.470 --> 01:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
to only those agreements that that do
 
01:26:06.149 --> 01:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
not contain a non-appropriation clause
 
01:26:08.390 --> 01:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
and i'm quite sure i'm pretty sure i
 
01:26:10.310 --> 01:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
remember that last year we discussed
 
01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
this with department of revenue
 
01:26:14.229 --> 01:26:14.239 align:start position:0%
administration they had no
 
01:26:17.270 --> 01:26:17.280 align:start position:0%
objection to to changing the statute as
 
01:26:19.350 --> 01:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
this proposes to do
 
01:26:22.470 --> 01:26:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh and so that's uh that's why we want
 
01:26:23.750 --> 01:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
to do it it
 
01:26:25.910 --> 01:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
just takes away
 
01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
a restriction that can cause problems
 
01:26:30.709 --> 01:26:30.719 align:start position:0%
for some towns
 
01:26:32.390 --> 01:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
so that's uh
 
01:26:33.830 --> 01:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
that's it and i'd be happy to answer
 
01:26:35.910 --> 01:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
questions and as i said i believe there
 
01:26:37.910 --> 01:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
is uh i believe chris bolt from the town
 
01:26:39.430 --> 01:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
of sand which is also
 
01:26:41.669 --> 01:26:41.679 align:start position:0%
uh signed up to testify
 
01:26:43.430 --> 01:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
yes uh representative
 
01:26:46.149 --> 01:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:50.229 --> 01:26:50.239 align:start position:0%
love you mr chair uh yes uh thank you mr
 
01:26:52.709 --> 01:26:52.719 align:start position:0%
johnson for taking my question my
 
01:26:55.830 --> 01:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
question is for the part one is there
 
01:26:55.840 --> 01:26:56.950 align:start position:0%
question is for the part one is there
any

01:26:56.950 --> 01:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:26:59.430 --> 01:26:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh idea where the
 
01:27:01.750 --> 01:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
fund is it just the tax
 
01:27:06.070 --> 01:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
water tax that people pay that is being
 
01:27:08.870 --> 01:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
allocated or reallocated or is it are
 
01:27:10.390 --> 01:27:10.400 align:start position:0%
there any
 
01:27:13.110 --> 01:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
settlement funds
 
01:27:17.350 --> 01:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:19.290 align:start position:0%
on part one um
 
01:27:19.290 --> 01:27:20.470 align:start position:0%
on part one um
[Music]

01:27:20.470 --> 01:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:21.590 align:start position:0%
[Music]
i'd

01:27:21.590 --> 01:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
i'd
 
01:27:23.669 --> 01:27:23.679 align:start position:0%
settlement funds i don't think so as i
 
01:27:25.990 --> 01:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
understand it it's simply the
 
01:27:28.390 --> 01:27:28.400 align:start position:0%
a portion of the water wheeling charges
 
01:27:30.550 --> 01:27:30.560 align:start position:0%
which are the charges
 
01:27:34.030 --> 01:27:34.040 align:start position:0%
that are paid by the uh other
 
01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:35.750 align:start position:0%
that are paid by the uh other
municipalities

01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:36.629 align:start position:0%
municipalities
uh

01:27:36.629 --> 01:27:36.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:27:38.709 --> 01:27:38.719 align:start position:0%
by users in the other
 
01:27:41.990 --> 01:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh other municipalities under the um
 
01:27:43.830 --> 01:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
under the inner municipal agreement so
 
01:27:45.669 --> 01:27:45.679 align:start position:0%
it's just the payment
 
01:27:45.679 --> 01:27:47.270 align:start position:0%
it's just the payment
payments

01:27:47.270 --> 01:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
payments
 
01:27:50.390 --> 01:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
the water charge payments themselves
 
01:27:53.030 --> 01:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:56.229 --> 01:27:56.239 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:27:58.310 --> 01:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
01:28:00.550 --> 01:28:00.560 align:start position:0%
mr johnston i don't know if you can
 
01:28:02.950 --> 01:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
answer this
 
01:28:04.950 --> 01:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
the money that's coming this is it has
 
01:28:07.590 --> 01:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
to do with part one i just seem to be
 
01:28:09.430 --> 01:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
a little concerned with it
 
01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:11.030 align:start position:0%
a little concerned with it
so

01:28:11.030 --> 01:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:28:13.110 --> 01:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
in dairy and i understand what dairy is
 
01:28:15.350 --> 01:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
doing and i think it's a very good thing
 
01:28:18.870 --> 01:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming that other communities
 
01:28:21.830 --> 01:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
send money to derry to allow them
 
01:28:23.350 --> 01:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
to do this work
 
01:28:25.030 --> 01:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
the money that they're sending comes
 
01:28:27.750 --> 01:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
from the users fees for the water from
 
01:28:29.189 --> 01:28:29.199 align:start position:0%
those cities
 
01:28:31.270 --> 01:28:31.280 align:start position:0%
so the people who live in
 
01:28:34.229 --> 01:28:34.239 align:start position:0%
is nashua one of the cities um pay their
 
01:28:36.709 --> 01:28:36.719 align:start position:0%
water bill for their usage and that
 
01:28:39.030 --> 01:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
money goes to derry
 
01:28:40.830 --> 01:28:40.840 align:start position:0%
who then can use
 
01:28:43.830 --> 01:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
it as outlined in this provision of this
 
01:28:46.149 --> 01:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
bill is that how it works
 
01:28:48.390 --> 01:28:48.400 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding a portion of a
 
01:28:49.750 --> 01:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
portion of that
 
01:28:52.709 --> 01:28:52.719 align:start position:0%
as as the language indicates
 
01:28:55.830 --> 01:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
no less than 50 percent has to be paid
 
01:28:57.830 --> 01:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
specifically for the has to be used
 
01:29:01.270 --> 01:29:01.280 align:start position:0%
specifically for the water system itself
 
01:29:03.510 --> 01:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
it's only the excess
 
01:29:06.629 --> 01:29:06.639 align:start position:0%
um that that can be used for uh other
 
01:29:08.390 --> 01:29:08.400 align:start position:0%
things that are listed there
 
01:29:12.229 --> 01:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
and if if i mis-speak on this uh i i
 
01:29:14.070 --> 01:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
hope dave karen is still on and he can
 
01:29:19.430 --> 01:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:22.310 --> 01:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
 
01:29:24.790 --> 01:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
johnston for taking my question
 
01:29:27.110 --> 01:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
so i just want to be
 
01:29:29.910 --> 01:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
clear that i understand part three of
 
01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:30.790 align:start position:0%
clear that i understand part three of
this

01:29:30.790 --> 01:29:30.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:31.990 align:start position:0%
this
bill

01:29:31.990 --> 01:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:29:34.149 --> 01:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:29:37.110 --> 01:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that
 
01:29:40.470 --> 01:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
the use of the capital reserve funds
 
01:29:43.910 --> 01:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
as written here can be used for both
 
01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:45.430 align:start position:0%
as written here can be used for both
um

01:29:45.430 --> 01:29:45.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:48.070 --> 01:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
a lease purchase agreement which does
 
01:29:50.790 --> 01:29:50.800 align:start position:0%
have an escape clause and also
 
01:29:53.510 --> 01:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
for those lease purchase agreements
 
01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
which do not
 
01:29:58.070 --> 01:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
so it can be used for both types of
 
01:30:00.629 --> 01:30:00.639 align:start position:0%
lease purchase agreements
 
01:30:01.750 --> 01:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:02.709 align:start position:0%
that's correct
okay

01:30:02.709 --> 01:30:02.719 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:30:04.950 --> 01:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up thank you
 
01:30:06.390 --> 01:30:06.400 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:30:10.070 --> 01:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
i had previously asked another um
 
01:30:12.550 --> 01:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
person with regard to
 
01:30:16.070 --> 01:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
again on part three line 21 and 22
 
01:30:18.550 --> 01:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
why those two lines were struck
 
01:30:21.270 --> 01:30:21.280 align:start position:0%
in am i correct in understanding that
 
01:30:24.870 --> 01:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
the reason it is struck because um it
 
01:30:26.390 --> 01:30:26.400 align:start position:0%
ties in
 
01:30:30.229 --> 01:30:30.239 align:start position:0%
to the um lines 19 and 20 which are also
 
01:30:30.239 --> 01:30:31.669 align:start position:0%
to the um lines 19 and 20 which are also
struck

01:30:31.669 --> 01:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
struck
 
01:30:34.950 --> 01:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
with regard um saying that the lease
 
01:30:36.950 --> 01:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
purchase agreement
 
01:30:38.950 --> 01:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
did not have an escape clause and if
 
01:30:41.189 --> 01:30:41.199 align:start position:0%
that's going to be eliminated you have
 
01:30:43.189 --> 01:30:43.199 align:start position:0%
to also strike
 
01:30:46.790 --> 01:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
lines 21 and 22 to be consistent
 
01:30:49.270 --> 01:30:49.280 align:start position:0%
yeah yes that's exactly right the
 
01:30:52.149 --> 01:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
you you would only need that two-thirds
 
01:30:55.510 --> 01:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
majority vote if if it was a lease
 
01:30:58.350 --> 01:30:58.360 align:start position:0%
purchase agreement that did not have the
 
01:31:01.030 --> 01:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
non-appropriation clause so yes if if
 
01:31:03.189 --> 01:31:03.199 align:start position:0%
you get rid of one it only makes sense
 
01:31:04.550 --> 01:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
to get rid of two
 
01:31:05.990 --> 01:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:31:08.470 --> 01:31:08.480 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative gilman have
 
01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
a question
 
01:31:12.790 --> 01:31:12.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh and thank you mr
 
01:31:15.430 --> 01:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
johnson for taking my testimony or my
 
01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:17.030 align:start position:0%
johnson for taking my testimony or my
question

01:31:17.030 --> 01:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:18.149 align:start position:0%
question
um

01:31:18.149 --> 01:31:18.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:19.910 --> 01:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
this is regards to part one and i'm
 
01:31:21.990 --> 01:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
sorry to make you jump around but i it
 
01:31:23.430 --> 01:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
just occurred to me
 
01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:24.870 align:start position:0%
just occurred to me
um

01:31:24.870 --> 01:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:27.910 --> 01:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
i understand that this uh
 
01:31:29.669 --> 01:31:29.679 align:start position:0%
that's this part of the bill
 
01:31:31.350 --> 01:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
only pertains to
 
01:31:33.270 --> 01:31:33.280 align:start position:0%
places with inter music municipal
 
01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:34.709 align:start position:0%
places with inter music municipal
agreements

01:31:34.709 --> 01:31:34.719 align:start position:0%
agreements
 
01:31:37.590 --> 01:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
my question is do the such towns and
 
01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:38.790 align:start position:0%
my question is do the such towns and
cities

01:31:38.790 --> 01:31:38.800 align:start position:0%
cities
 
01:31:41.430 --> 01:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
put those funds into an enterprise fund
 
01:31:43.030 --> 01:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
for water
 
01:31:50.070 --> 01:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:52.390 --> 01:31:52.400 align:start position:0%
yeah i i think it would i think it would
 
01:31:54.550 --> 01:31:54.560 align:start position:0%
have to and
 
01:31:57.270 --> 01:31:57.280 align:start position:0%
uh that presumably would be governed by
 
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
the inter-municipal agreement itself
 
01:32:02.390 --> 01:32:02.400 align:start position:0%
and i and i haven't looked at the
 
01:32:05.590 --> 01:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
agreement that governs uh the dairy
 
01:32:09.030 --> 01:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
the dairy situation but i i would
 
01:32:10.629 --> 01:32:10.639 align:start position:0%
assume that the
 
01:32:10.639 --> 01:32:11.430 align:start position:0%
assume that the
the

01:32:11.430 --> 01:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:32:14.390 --> 01:32:14.400 align:start position:0%
intermunicipal agreement specifies where
 
01:32:17.669 --> 01:32:17.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:21.189 --> 01:32:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:24.070 --> 01:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
no further questions for the nhma let's
 
01:32:28.950 --> 01:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:30.470 --> 01:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members of the
 
01:32:32.149 --> 01:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
committee my name is grant bosse i'm the
 
01:32:34.310 --> 01:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
majority policy director over here in
 
01:32:36.229 --> 01:32:36.239 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire senate uh here on
 
01:32:38.070 --> 01:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
behalf of senator regina birdsall the
 
01:32:40.470 --> 01:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor and the author of part one
 
01:32:42.550 --> 01:32:42.560 align:start position:0%
of this bill do apologize for the
 
01:32:44.709 --> 01:32:44.719 align:start position:0%
confusion senator birdsall had planned
 
01:32:47.430 --> 01:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
to attend this uh a doctor's appointment
 
01:32:49.830 --> 01:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
ran along and then a conflicting senate
 
01:32:53.030 --> 01:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
hearing um started so she asked me to
 
01:32:55.270 --> 01:32:55.280 align:start position:0%
pinch hit uh i think you've heard what
 
01:32:56.870 --> 01:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
you need to hear on this bill
 
01:32:58.950 --> 01:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
particularly from administrator karen
 
01:33:01.030 --> 01:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
from the town of derry the senator put
 
01:33:03.270 --> 01:33:03.280 align:start position:0%
this bill in on behalf of the town of
 
01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:04.470 align:start position:0%
this bill in on behalf of the town of
derry

01:33:04.470 --> 01:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
derry
 
01:33:08.709 --> 01:33:08.719 align:start position:0%
rsa 38 limits the use of water fees to
 
01:33:11.030 --> 01:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh go back into that system that's good
 
01:33:12.870 --> 01:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
policy that's good law
 
01:33:15.030 --> 01:33:15.040 align:start position:0%
but it never anticipated the sort of
 
01:33:17.189 --> 01:33:17.199 align:start position:0%
inter-municipal agreements that dairy
 
01:33:19.510 --> 01:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
has with manchester water works and the
 
01:33:21.669 --> 01:33:21.679 align:start position:0%
communities to its south and east we
 
01:33:24.390 --> 01:33:24.400 align:start position:0%
think giving derry some flexibility
 
01:33:27.110 --> 01:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
to use those wheeling charges for
 
01:33:29.350 --> 01:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
limited purposes outside the water
 
01:33:32.149 --> 01:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
system itself makes sense
 
01:33:33.990 --> 01:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
and we ask for
 
01:33:36.470 --> 01:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
your consideration of that policy change
 
01:33:39.830 --> 01:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh as part of uh senate bill 87 thank
 
01:33:41.750 --> 01:33:41.760 align:start position:0%

section 1 rsa 162 k 6 which is referred
 
01:33:57.669 --> 01:33:57.679 align:start position:0%
to in the first part of the bill and
 
01:34:00.470 --> 01:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
there's a list of things that this money
 
01:34:02.229 --> 01:34:02.239 align:start position:0%
can be used for
 
01:34:05.110 --> 01:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
section you know roman 3 is specifically
 
01:34:07.189 --> 01:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
left listed in the bill
 
01:34:09.669 --> 01:34:09.679 align:start position:0%

here
that

there's all sorts of things in this list
 
01:34:25.110 --> 01:34:25.120 align:start position:0%
and you know perhaps they have
 
01:34:29.350 --> 01:34:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:32.390 --> 01:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
but i'm i just can't get over that
 
01:34:34.709 --> 01:34:34.719 align:start position:0%
somebody is paying their water bill and
 
01:34:36.229 --> 01:34:36.239 align:start position:0%
that the money that they're paying for
 
01:34:37.910 --> 01:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
their water is going to go
 
01:34:40.629 --> 01:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
to buy street lights it just seems wrong
 
01:34:42.870 --> 01:34:42.880 align:start position:0%
to me so please make me feel better
 
01:34:45.510 --> 01:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
about that well representative i'd refer
 
01:34:48.790 --> 01:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
you to line 14 of the bill on page one
 
01:34:52.550 --> 01:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
um that specifically limits these fees
 
01:34:55.030 --> 01:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
derived from inter-municipal agreements
 
01:34:56.550 --> 01:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
so this is money
 
01:34:58.870 --> 01:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
that is being paid to the town of dairy
 
01:35:01.430 --> 01:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
for the use of its water infrastructure
 
01:35:03.430 --> 01:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
to get that water from manchester
 
01:35:05.189 --> 01:35:05.199 align:start position:0%
through dairy
 
01:35:07.830 --> 01:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
so this is not um this is not water
 
01:35:10.470 --> 01:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
being used by the people of dairy
 
01:35:13.590 --> 01:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
there if dairy is a conduit to get that
 
01:35:15.669 --> 01:35:15.679 align:start position:0%
water from manchester down to the south
 
01:35:18.390 --> 01:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
in the east and the policy change that
 
01:35:19.830 --> 01:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
senator birdsall is asking you to
 
01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:20.950 align:start position:0%
senator birdsall is asking you to
consider

01:35:20.950 --> 01:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
consider
 
01:35:23.430 --> 01:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
is that the town of derry
 
01:35:23.440 --> 01:35:25.189 align:start position:0%
is that the town of derry
for

01:35:25.189 --> 01:35:25.199 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:35:26.950 --> 01:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
being part of this agreement to let the
 
01:35:28.870 --> 01:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
water flow through it
 
01:35:30.229 --> 01:35:30.239 align:start position:0%
should be able to have greater
 
01:35:33.430 --> 01:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
flexibility to use this money
 
01:35:35.669 --> 01:35:35.679 align:start position:0%
for other purposes
 
01:35:37.590 --> 01:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
broad economic development purposes but
 
01:35:40.149 --> 01:35:40.159 align:start position:0%
outside of the traditional limits
 
01:35:40.159 --> 01:35:41.030 align:start position:0%
outside of the traditional limits
of

01:35:41.030 --> 01:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:35:43.590 --> 01:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
water systems in rsa 38.
 
01:35:45.110 --> 01:35:45.120 align:start position:0%
follow mr chair
 
01:35:46.790 --> 01:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead follow up
 
01:35:49.590 --> 01:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
but the money that the people of
 
01:35:52.790 --> 01:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
manchester are sending to derry
 
01:35:55.430 --> 01:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
comes from the user fees
 
01:35:58.629 --> 01:35:58.639 align:start position:0%
of the water bills that they're paying
 
01:36:01.189 --> 01:36:01.199 align:start position:0%
that's where that money is coming from
 
01:36:03.189 --> 01:36:03.199 align:start position:0%
uh i believe the the wouldn't
 
01:36:04.870 --> 01:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily be from manchester it'd be
 
01:36:06.149 --> 01:36:06.159 align:start position:0%
from the other communities that are
 
01:36:07.510 --> 01:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
getting their water
 
01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
i'm using manchester as an example
 
01:36:12.550 --> 01:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
whoever is sending money to derry
 
01:36:15.110 --> 01:36:15.120 align:start position:0%
those communities are getting the money
 
01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:16.229 align:start position:0%
those communities are getting the money
from

01:36:16.229 --> 01:36:16.239 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:36:20.709 --> 01:36:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:22.950 --> 01:36:22.960 align:start position:0%
is that accurate yes
 
01:36:30.390 --> 01:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:31.750 --> 01:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:36:33.110 --> 01:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
yes representative for paying their
 
01:36:35.110 --> 01:36:35.120 align:start position:0%
water bill some of that money goes to
 
01:36:36.870 --> 01:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
the town of dairy for the use of its
 
01:36:38.550 --> 01:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
water system
 
01:36:40.390 --> 01:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
um so yeah they are that's what they are
 
01:36:43.110 --> 01:36:43.120 align:start position:0%
receiving for that charge
 
01:36:45.910 --> 01:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
okay uh yes representative
 
01:36:47.990 --> 01:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and
 
01:36:49.669 --> 01:36:49.679 align:start position:0%
is this
 
01:36:52.390 --> 01:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
mr bossy yes okay thank you mr bossy for
 
01:36:54.390 --> 01:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:36:58.070 --> 01:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
do you know if um in different cities
 
01:37:00.870 --> 01:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
that this bill may affect other
 
01:37:02.790 --> 01:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
excess funds because
 
01:37:04.070 --> 01:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
this this
 
01:37:07.510 --> 01:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
this bill here proposes that um no less
 
01:37:09.510 --> 01:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
than 50 percent of the water wheeling
 
01:37:09.520 --> 01:37:10.790 align:start position:0%
than 50 percent of the water wheeling
charges

01:37:10.790 --> 01:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
charges
 
01:37:13.030 --> 01:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
would be utilized for the maintenance
 
01:37:16.229 --> 01:37:16.239 align:start position:0%
and upkeep upkeep of the water system
 
01:37:19.510 --> 01:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
is there excess monies
 
01:37:21.510 --> 01:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
is 100 of
 
01:37:24.310 --> 01:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
the money currently being used for
 
01:37:27.350 --> 01:37:27.360 align:start position:0%
the upkeep and maintenance of the water
 
01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:29.030 align:start position:0%
the upkeep and maintenance of the water
infrastructure

01:37:29.030 --> 01:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
01:37:31.030 --> 01:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
i'd defer that to mr karen as he said
 
01:37:32.950 --> 01:37:32.960 align:start position:0%
this bill was very narrowly crafted so
 
01:37:34.950 --> 01:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
it would only apply i think to two
 
01:37:36.870 --> 01:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
communities and the only one currently
 
01:37:39.990 --> 01:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
in uh one of these agreements is dairy
 
01:37:41.990 --> 01:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
so i think that question would be better
 
01:37:43.910 --> 01:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
directed to the town administrator in
 
01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:45.430 align:start position:0%
directed to the town administrator in
derry

01:37:45.430 --> 01:37:45.440 align:start position:0%
derry
 
01:37:47.510 --> 01:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
mr karen if you're still online can you
 
01:37:50.229 --> 01:37:50.239 align:start position:0%
handle that question
 
01:37:52.709 --> 01:37:52.719 align:start position:0%
uh yes can you hear me yes okay okay
 
01:37:55.350 --> 01:37:55.360 align:start position:0%
great yeah uh
 
01:37:57.350 --> 01:37:57.360 align:start position:0%
that's correct uh we don't do not
 
01:37:58.950 --> 01:37:58.960 align:start position:0%
anticipate that
 
01:38:01.189 --> 01:38:01.199 align:start position:0%
uh 100 of our revenues from this
 
01:38:01.199 --> 01:38:02.470 align:start position:0%
uh 100 of our revenues from this
arrangement

01:38:02.470 --> 01:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
arrangement
 
01:38:05.350 --> 01:38:05.360 align:start position:0%
will be needed to maintain our system
 
01:38:07.109 --> 01:38:07.119 align:start position:0%
however if we have a massive pump
 
01:38:08.950 --> 01:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
station failure
 
01:38:12.149 --> 01:38:12.159 align:start position:0%
then obviously that dynamic changes
 
01:38:12.159 --> 01:38:13.430 align:start position:0%
then obviously that dynamic changes
and

01:38:13.430 --> 01:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:38:15.350 --> 01:38:15.360 align:start position:0%
looking back at representative porter's
 
01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:18.149 align:start position:0%
looking back at representative porter's
question

01:38:18.149 --> 01:38:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:21.990 --> 01:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
the wheeling charge was to recognize
 
01:38:25.510 --> 01:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
dairy's sharing of its previous expenses
 
01:38:27.510 --> 01:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
to build its water system
 
01:38:29.750 --> 01:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
so looking at it another way
 
01:38:33.350 --> 01:38:33.360 align:start position:0%
if the if the folks south of
 
01:38:36.390 --> 01:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
uh dairy wanted to take advantage of the
 
01:38:37.910 --> 01:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
water produced by the manchester
 
01:38:37.920 --> 01:38:39.109 align:start position:0%
water produced by the manchester
waterworks

01:38:39.109 --> 01:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
waterworks
 
01:38:41.830 --> 01:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
and there was there was no municipal
 
01:38:43.669 --> 01:38:43.679 align:start position:0%
water system in dairy
 
01:38:46.229 --> 01:38:46.239 align:start position:0%
those users would be responsible for the
 
01:38:48.629 --> 01:38:48.639 align:start position:0%
debt service to construct millions of
 
01:38:51.270 --> 01:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
dollars of pump stations and water lines
 
01:38:53.270 --> 01:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
through the town of derry
 
01:38:55.910 --> 01:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
to receive that water so
 
01:38:58.310 --> 01:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
the wheeling charge was restructured
 
01:39:01.350 --> 01:39:01.360 align:start position:0%
again preserves it's in recognition of
 
01:39:03.669 --> 01:39:03.679 align:start position:0%
the past investment made by dairy
 
01:39:06.629 --> 01:39:06.639 align:start position:0%
taxpayers into its water system which
 
01:39:08.390 --> 01:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
allowed this project
 
01:39:10.830 --> 01:39:10.840 align:start position:0%
to come to
 
01:39:15.350 --> 01:39:15.360 align:start position:0%
fruition thank you mr karen uh
 
01:39:18.950 --> 01:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
next uh we're going to hear from uh
 
01:39:21.750 --> 01:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
we alluded to uh the town administrator
 
01:39:24.870 --> 01:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
from auburn uh william herman
 
01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:32.950 align:start position:0%
from auburn uh william herman
is

01:39:32.950 --> 01:39:32.960 align:start position:0%

uh thank you mr chairman i am and i'll
 
01:39:38.070 --> 01:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
uh make my comments very brief for the
 
01:39:40.310 --> 01:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
record my name is william herrmann i'm
 
01:39:42.390 --> 01:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
the town administrator for the town of
 
01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:43.430 align:start position:0%
the town administrator for the town of
auburn

01:39:43.430 --> 01:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
auburn
 
01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:44.870 align:start position:0%
auburn
um

01:39:44.870 --> 01:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:47.270 --> 01:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
senator carson has sponsored part b of
 
01:39:50.470 --> 01:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
this legislation at the the request of
 
01:39:52.870 --> 01:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
the town of auburn and i think she did a
 
01:39:55.510 --> 01:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
great job as did cordell johnston to
 
01:39:55.520 --> 01:39:56.790 align:start position:0%
great job as did cordell johnston to
explain

01:39:56.790 --> 01:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
explain
 
01:39:58.790 --> 01:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
why we believe it's needed it's just
 
01:40:00.550 --> 01:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
what we view as housekeeping and
 
01:40:03.830 --> 01:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
catching up with modern times
 
01:40:05.990 --> 01:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
if i could i think the only other i have
 
01:40:07.910 --> 01:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
submitted written testimony so i won't
 
01:40:10.470 --> 01:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
go through that for you
 
01:40:12.629 --> 01:40:12.639 align:start position:0%
if i could answer one question i believe
 
01:40:16.470 --> 01:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
the question was asked previously as to
 
01:40:18.550 --> 01:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
where these fees or monies would go and
 
01:40:20.870 --> 01:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
largely they will go to pay the bank fee
 
01:40:23.189 --> 01:40:23.199 align:start position:0%
better charge the municipalities when
 
01:40:25.510 --> 01:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
somebody issues a payment and it is
 
01:40:27.910 --> 01:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
returned due to insufficient funds there
 
01:40:29.910 --> 01:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
are costs that
 
01:40:32.070 --> 01:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
the municipality or a private business
 
01:40:33.750 --> 01:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
would incur from
 
01:40:35.990 --> 01:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
the bank and these fees would cover
 
01:40:38.149 --> 01:40:38.159 align:start position:0%
those costs so that the taxpayers are
 
01:40:38.159 --> 01:40:39.590 align:start position:0%
those costs so that the taxpayers are
not

01:40:39.590 --> 01:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:40:41.669 --> 01:40:41.679 align:start position:0%
covering those expenses
 
01:40:43.510 --> 01:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to answer any questions if
 
01:40:44.709 --> 01:40:44.719 align:start position:0%

communities around the state i'm not
 
01:41:18.870 --> 01:41:18.880 align:start position:0%
here testifying in that capacity for any

i
 
01:41:22.870 --> 01:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
as senator bradley indicated i was

selectmen in sandwich at the time this
 
01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:26.149 align:start position:0%
selectmen in sandwich at the time this
bill

01:41:26.149 --> 01:41:26.159 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:41:27.990 --> 01:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
was first requested
 
01:41:31.030 --> 01:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
and it came as a result of
 
01:41:33.109 --> 01:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
the need for a large piece of equipment
 
01:41:35.590 --> 01:41:35.600 align:start position:0%
for our highway department
 
01:41:38.470 --> 01:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
where our capital reserve fund had
 
01:41:41.510 --> 01:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
some monies in it but not nearly enough
 
01:41:43.750 --> 01:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
uh we also had other
 
01:41:45.590 --> 01:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
capital reserve funds for things like
 
01:41:48.470 --> 01:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
the fire engines things of that nature
 
01:41:50.870 --> 01:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
that any of you who've
 
01:41:52.709 --> 01:41:52.719 align:start position:0%
seen these items on your municipal
 
01:41:54.390 --> 01:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
budgets know those are increasing
 
01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:56.070 align:start position:0%
budgets know those are increasing
greatly

01:41:56.070 --> 01:41:56.080 align:start position:0%
greatly
 
01:41:59.430 --> 01:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
our request started out simply as adding
 
01:42:02.870 --> 01:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
the the highlighted text
 
01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:04.310 align:start position:0%
the the highlighted text
to

01:42:04.310 --> 01:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:42:07.510 --> 01:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
rsa 3515 roman 3
 
01:42:10.149 --> 01:42:10.159 align:start position:0%
including lease purchase agreement
 
01:42:11.750 --> 01:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
that language was
 
01:42:15.030 --> 01:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
because dras traditionally stated
 
01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:15.910 align:start position:0%
because dras traditionally stated
that

01:42:15.910 --> 01:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:42:18.709 --> 01:42:18.719 align:start position:0%
the funds in a capital reserve amount
 
01:42:22.229 --> 01:42:22.239 align:start position:0%
could only be used for the last payment
 
01:42:23.990 --> 01:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
in a lease purchase agreement because
 
01:42:27.189 --> 01:42:27.199 align:start position:0%
that's when you're actually purchasing
 
01:42:28.870 --> 01:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
the piece of equipment
 
01:42:30.070 --> 01:42:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh as
 
01:42:33.430 --> 01:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
our idea uh took flight
 
01:42:35.109 --> 01:42:35.119 align:start position:0%
era weighed in
 
01:42:37.590 --> 01:42:37.600 align:start position:0%
others weighed in and that's why
 
01:42:40.070 --> 01:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
the language of uh
 
01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:41.350 align:start position:0%

uh completely get away

zero were in opposition and zero were

i just wanted to bring to your attention
 
01:43:50.310 --> 01:43:50.320 align:start position:0%
that representative mangiapudi seems to
 
01:43:53.030 --> 01:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
be having some internet uh issues and
 
01:43:55.830 --> 01:43:55.840 align:start position:0%
has uh fallen off of the panelist screen
 
01:43:57.510 --> 01:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
and we're doing our best to try to get
 
01:43:59.830 --> 01:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
her back into the meeting
 
01:44:06.229 --> 01:44:06.239 align:start position:0%

from lebanon
 
01:45:33.270 --> 01:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
morning mr chairman members of the
 
01:45:34.550 --> 01:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
municipal and county government
 
01:45:34.560 --> 01:45:37.590 align:start position:0%
municipal and county government
committee

01:45:37.590 --> 01:45:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:40.310 --> 01:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
i'm here today to test find support of
 
01:45:41.590 --> 01:45:41.600 align:start position:0%
part two
 
01:45:44.310 --> 01:45:44.320 align:start position:0%
of uh senate bill 102.
 
01:45:44.320 --> 01:45:45.990 align:start position:0%
of uh senate bill 102.
and

01:45:45.990 --> 01:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:45:48.229 --> 01:45:48.239 align:start position:0%
i'll just explain some background i am
 
01:45:49.830 --> 01:45:49.840 align:start position:0%
testifying on behalf of the city of
 
01:45:52.790 --> 01:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
lebanon as its assistant mayor uh this
 
01:45:55.430 --> 01:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh bill or part two of this bill enables
 
01:45:58.149 --> 01:45:58.159 align:start position:0%
a new local option to exempt from local
 
01:46:01.750 --> 01:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
property taxes but not any state taxes
 
01:46:03.750 --> 01:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
renewable generation facilities and
 
01:46:06.470 --> 01:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
electric energy storage systems
 
01:46:09.030 --> 01:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
why would a immunospot even want to
 
01:46:11.669 --> 01:46:11.679 align:start position:0%
consider such exemptions the main reason
 
01:46:13.669 --> 01:46:13.679 align:start position:0%
is that renewable energy and storage are
 
01:46:15.669 --> 01:46:15.679 align:start position:0%
typically very capital intensive
 
01:46:17.830 --> 01:46:17.840 align:start position:0%
compared with the capital cost of a
 
01:46:20.870 --> 01:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
natural gas combined cycle generator
 
01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
which is the type of generation they
 
01:46:25.430 --> 01:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
displace on the margin
 
01:46:27.830 --> 01:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
um so if you levied a tax rate at the
 
01:46:30.070 --> 01:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
same level based on the capital cost of
 
01:46:32.550 --> 01:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
the project including if if they were on
 
01:46:34.870 --> 01:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
similar depreciation schedules or the
 
01:46:37.510 --> 01:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
replacement costs which are two ways of
 
01:46:40.229 --> 01:46:40.239 align:start position:0%
valuing real property of the tax burden
 
01:46:42.790 --> 01:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
on renewable generation and storage per
 
01:46:45.990 --> 01:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour would be two to ten times
 
01:46:48.709 --> 01:46:48.719 align:start position:0%
as much as that for the gas that it
 
01:46:48.719 --> 01:46:49.990 align:start position:0%
as much as that for the gas that it
displaces

01:46:49.990 --> 01:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
displaces
 
01:46:51.590 --> 01:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
um in fact
 
01:46:53.669 --> 01:46:53.679 align:start position:0%
the most common form of renewable energy
 
01:46:56.629 --> 01:46:56.639 align:start position:0%
a fixed tilt solar system uh faces a
 
01:46:58.390 --> 01:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
potential property tax burden that's
 
01:47:01.030 --> 01:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
about seven and a half times that of the
 
01:47:03.750 --> 01:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
natural gas that it competes with uh per
 
01:47:05.189 --> 01:47:05.199 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour
 
01:47:07.830 --> 01:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
um so that that's that's the important
 
01:47:10.550 --> 01:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
reason to consider it uh in essence uh
 
01:47:12.470 --> 01:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
with renewable energy you typically
 
01:47:15.189 --> 01:47:15.199 align:start position:0%
replace you you invest in capital cost
 
01:47:17.830 --> 01:47:17.840 align:start position:0%
upfront you know pv system or wind
 
01:47:20.470 --> 01:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
turbine uh the fuel in those cases
 
01:47:23.750 --> 01:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't cost anything uh but the um and
 
01:47:26.310 --> 01:47:26.320 align:start position:0%
there's a very low operating cost we
 
01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:27.189 align:start position:0%
there's a very low operating cost we
um

01:47:27.189 --> 01:47:27.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:29.189 --> 01:47:29.199 align:start position:0%
so most of the value is in the capital
 
01:47:31.109 --> 01:47:31.119 align:start position:0%
investment whereas what it's competing
 
01:47:33.590 --> 01:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
against natural gas most of the costs
 
01:47:35.990 --> 01:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
are in the fuel and the operational cost
 
01:47:38.149 --> 01:47:38.159 align:start position:0%
which we don't tax plus most of the
 
01:47:40.229 --> 01:47:40.239 align:start position:0%
generation this might displace on the
 
01:47:42.790 --> 01:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
margin is actually located out of state
 
01:47:42.800 --> 01:47:44.070 align:start position:0%
margin is actually located out of state
um

01:47:44.070 --> 01:47:44.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:46.550 --> 01:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
i did send testimony to the committee uh
 
01:47:48.070 --> 01:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
but that was you know just as you were
 
01:47:49.750 --> 01:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
getting going this morning but that's
 
01:47:51.590 --> 01:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
available to look at there's some
 
01:47:53.830 --> 01:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
explanation of that analysis i just gave
 
01:47:56.629 --> 01:47:56.639 align:start position:0%
you in there um
 
01:47:58.390 --> 01:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
and i would point it in in real terms
 
01:48:00.149 --> 01:48:00.159 align:start position:0%
this works out to be very significant
 
01:48:03.030 --> 01:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
dollars it could mean that um
 
01:48:04.950 --> 01:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh you're you're adding four or five
 
01:48:06.950 --> 01:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
cents per kilowatt hour to the cost of
 
01:48:10.070 --> 01:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
renewable uh compared to um
 
01:48:11.669 --> 01:48:11.679 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
01:48:15.270 --> 01:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
uh natural gas that it displaces and it
 
01:48:16.870 --> 01:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
makes it you know less much less
 
01:48:18.950 --> 01:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
economic and and potentially not
 
01:48:20.390 --> 01:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
happening at all
 
01:48:22.390 --> 01:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
which is generally the case for systems
 
01:48:24.790 --> 01:48:24.800 align:start position:0%
in the one to five megawatt size uh but
 
01:48:26.709 --> 01:48:26.719 align:start position:0%
another very specific reason for this
 
01:48:28.390 --> 01:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
legislation is even though there's
 
01:48:31.709 --> 01:48:31.719 align:start position:0%
existing options for local property tax
 
01:48:34.390 --> 01:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
exemptions for certain renewables and
 
01:48:36.870 --> 01:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
storage systems um they have been
 
01:48:39.390 --> 01:48:39.400 align:start position:0%
determined by a number of attorneys and
 
01:48:42.070 --> 01:48:42.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities to only be available to
 
01:48:44.790 --> 01:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
the owner of the underlying real estate
 
01:48:47.109 --> 01:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
that is um that's the property owner
 
01:48:48.629 --> 01:48:48.639 align:start position:0%
that's because there's language in these
 
01:48:54.470 --> 01:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
other statutes um rsa 72 62 66 70 and 85
 
01:48:56.870 --> 01:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
let's say the exemptions for persons
 
01:48:59.109 --> 01:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
owning real property which is equipped
 
01:49:03.430 --> 01:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
with a solar system or a wind system
 
01:49:03.440 --> 01:49:04.310 align:start position:0%
with a solar system or a wind system
so

01:49:04.310 --> 01:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:49:06.550 --> 01:49:06.560 align:start position:0%
that if there if the system is owned by
 
01:49:09.350 --> 01:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
a third party which is common with
 
01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:10.870 align:start position:0%
a third party which is common with
non-profits

01:49:10.870 --> 01:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
non-profits
 
01:49:13.590 --> 01:49:13.600 align:start position:0%
and for low and moderate income projects
 
01:49:14.950 --> 01:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
then they're owned by a third party
 
01:49:16.550 --> 01:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
that's selling to
 
01:49:18.629 --> 01:49:18.639 align:start position:0%
the you know perhaps the property owner
 
01:49:21.990 --> 01:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
or or members of the uh
 
01:49:24.870 --> 01:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
housing development
 
01:49:27.189 --> 01:49:27.199 align:start position:0%
they're selling them to them
 
01:49:29.350 --> 01:49:29.360 align:start position:0%
through a purchase power agreement and
 
01:49:31.990 --> 01:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
in lebanon's case there was a low
 
01:49:34.709 --> 01:49:34.719 align:start position:0%
moderate income uh project with a
 
01:49:36.550 --> 01:49:36.560 align:start position:0%
manufactured home resident owned
 
01:49:38.870 --> 01:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
community called massacoma meadows
 
01:49:40.629 --> 01:49:40.639 align:start position:0%
and uh that was something that was
 
01:49:43.109 --> 01:49:43.119 align:start position:0%
supported by the puc
 
01:49:45.189 --> 01:49:45.199 align:start position:0%
and they assumed that the property tax
 
01:49:47.350 --> 01:49:47.360 align:start position:0%
would not apply because we adopted an
 
01:49:49.030 --> 01:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
exemption in lebanon
 
01:49:50.790 --> 01:49:50.800 align:start position:0%
but because of this interpretation of
 
01:49:53.669 --> 01:49:53.679 align:start position:0%
the statute it appears as though
 
01:49:55.830 --> 01:49:55.840 align:start position:0%
you know they should be taxed and we
 
01:49:58.870 --> 01:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
don't have an ability to exempt that so
 
01:50:01.350 --> 01:50:01.360 align:start position:0%
um in conclusion i just say that the you
 
01:50:03.830 --> 01:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
know the language creates a new separate
 
01:50:08.149 --> 01:50:08.159 align:start position:0%
option for a local exemption it is um
 
01:50:10.790 --> 01:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
it was sort of introduced over a year
 
01:50:12.870 --> 01:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
ago but got stuck in the senate because
 
01:50:14.629 --> 01:50:14.639 align:start position:0%
the synonym
 
01:50:16.149 --> 01:50:16.159 align:start position:0%
passed it when things shut down because
 
01:50:18.149 --> 01:50:18.159 align:start position:0%
of the pandemic um
 
01:50:20.950 --> 01:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
the original language tried to amend the
 
01:50:24.070 --> 01:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
existing exemptions to allow them to
 
01:50:27.590 --> 01:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
include third-party own systems but um
 
01:50:29.189 --> 01:50:29.199 align:start position:0%
the municipal association and the
 
01:50:32.550 --> 01:50:32.560 align:start position:0%
assessors group uh uh you know um
 
01:50:33.830 --> 01:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
pointed out that that's a problem
 
01:50:35.590 --> 01:50:35.600 align:start position:0%
because it sort of changes exemptions
 
01:50:37.030 --> 01:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
that have already been adopted by
 
01:50:39.270 --> 01:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
communities so this language was
 
01:50:41.750 --> 01:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
developed to make it a separate option
 
01:50:44.070 --> 01:50:44.080 align:start position:0%
that has to be voted on uh locally by
 
01:50:45.510 --> 01:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
the by the
 
01:50:47.430 --> 01:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
legislative body of the community to
 
01:50:49.990 --> 01:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
adopt it so i'll just stop there there's
 
01:50:51.669 --> 01:50:51.679 align:start position:0%
a lot of information there but it's all
 
01:50:54.149 --> 01:50:54.159 align:start position:0%
sort of detailed out in
 
01:50:56.390 --> 01:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
the written the pdf that i sent you with
 
01:50:58.950 --> 01:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
written testimony which also includes
 
01:51:00.870 --> 01:51:00.880 align:start position:0%
the excerpts from the other statutes
 
01:51:02.709 --> 01:51:02.719 align:start position:0%
that that might be relevant to
 
01:51:04.390 --> 01:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
understanding the context of this
 
01:51:04.400 --> 01:51:06.310 align:start position:0%
understanding the context of this
legislation

01:51:06.310 --> 01:51:06.320 align:start position:0%

the prime sponsor of part one of sb 102
 
01:51:54.870 --> 01:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
postponing assessment reviews and
 
01:51:57.350 --> 01:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
reappraisals of property
 
01:51:59.189 --> 01:51:59.199 align:start position:0%
i'm bringing this bill on behalf of the
 
01:52:01.910 --> 01:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
city of portsmouth this lsr would
 
01:52:03.910 --> 01:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
postpone property tax assessments during
 
01:52:07.350 --> 01:52:07.360 align:start position:0%
the tax year beginning april 1st 2021.
 
01:52:09.510 --> 01:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
also any appeal filed for the property
 
01:52:11.830 --> 01:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
tax year beginning april 1st 2021 will
 
01:52:15.189 --> 01:52:15.199 align:start position:0%
utilize the 2020 median equalization
 
01:52:17.030 --> 01:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
ratio as established by the department
 
01:52:18.709 --> 01:52:18.719 align:start position:0%
of revenue administration for each
 
01:52:21.430 --> 01:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
municipality for abatement purposes
 
01:52:23.750 --> 01:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
this lsr will prevent property owners
 
01:52:25.589 --> 01:52:25.599 align:start position:0%
from having their having to have their
 
01:52:27.669 --> 01:52:27.679 align:start position:0%
tax assessments occur during an
 
01:52:29.750 --> 01:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
artificially inflated real estate market
 
01:52:31.189 --> 01:52:31.199 align:start position:0%
due to covet
 
01:52:33.270 --> 01:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
assessing property during this bubble
 
01:52:34.870 --> 01:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
would make it harder and more expensive
 
01:52:36.470 --> 01:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
for people to stay in their homes during
 
01:52:37.669 --> 01:52:37.679 align:start position:0%
a time when we've all learned the
 
01:52:40.470 --> 01:52:40.480 align:start position:0%
importance of home and what that means
 
01:52:42.470 --> 01:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
it has come to my attention since filing
 
01:52:43.910 --> 01:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
the bill that the city of portsmouth
 
01:52:45.990 --> 01:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
will not need to conduct a revaluation
 
01:52:47.589 --> 01:52:47.599 align:start position:0%
this year but perhaps there are other
 
01:52:49.350 --> 01:52:49.360 align:start position:0%
communities which may be interested in
 
01:52:50.550 --> 01:52:50.560 align:start position:0%
this procedure
 
01:52:52.470 --> 01:52:52.480 align:start position:0%
i know representatives of the dra may be
 
01:52:54.470 --> 01:52:54.480 align:start position:0%

01:53:53.030 --> 01:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
if that cycle comes under for portsmouth
 
01:53:55.510 --> 01:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
this year or did it happen
 
01:53:55.520 --> 01:53:56.629 align:start position:0%
this year or did it happen
before

01:53:56.629 --> 01:53:56.639 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:53:58.950 --> 01:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am thank you for the question
 
01:54:01.910 --> 01:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative the each municipality
 
01:54:04.629 --> 01:54:04.639 align:start position:0%
is required to conduct a reassessment
 
01:54:06.470 --> 01:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
when their
 
01:54:08.870 --> 01:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
combined assessed value
 
01:54:11.910 --> 01:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
either reaches um 85 of the current
 
01:54:14.470 --> 01:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
value or i think it's 110 percent so
 
01:54:16.790 --> 01:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily every five or ten
 
01:54:19.430 --> 01:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
years but rather um sort of depends on
 
01:54:19.440 --> 01:54:20.229 align:start position:0%
years but rather um sort of depends on
what

01:54:20.229 --> 01:54:20.239 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:54:22.310 --> 01:54:22.320 align:start position:0%
what happens in the market in terms of
 
01:54:25.589 --> 01:54:25.599 align:start position:0%
the value of their assessed property so
 
01:54:28.070 --> 01:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
in portsmouth that tends to happen every
 
01:54:30.550 --> 01:54:30.560 align:start position:0%
two years um and they've since
 
01:54:32.149 --> 01:54:32.159 align:start position:0%
determined that this year won't be a
 
01:54:33.990 --> 01:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
year they need to assess but probably
 
01:54:39.030 --> 01:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:39.990 --> 01:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:54:42.229 --> 01:54:42.239 align:start position:0%

01:54:58.229 --> 01:54:58.239 align:start position:0%
we're all moving from meetings to
 
01:55:00.629 --> 01:55:00.639 align:start position:0%

01:55:20.790 --> 01:55:20.800 align:start position:0%
representative laurel stavis uh clifton

gave his testimony and uh
 
01:55:27.350 --> 01:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
which is
 
01:55:28.870 --> 01:55:28.880 align:start position:0%
is really the bill that the part of the
 
01:55:31.030 --> 01:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
bill that i'm here to introduce which is
 
01:55:33.990 --> 01:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
um section three of senate bill 102
 
01:55:37.189 --> 01:55:37.199 align:start position:0%
which i am in support of um and as
 
01:55:39.510 --> 01:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
clifton below stated this has been a
 
01:55:41.430 --> 01:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
request of the city of lebanon again
 
01:55:42.870 --> 01:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
where i'm a resident as part of my
 
01:55:44.870 --> 01:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
district so i just want to share briefly
 
01:55:47.270 --> 01:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
that lebanon like a growing number of
 
01:55:49.109 --> 01:55:49.119 align:start position:0%
municipalities in new hampshire have
 
01:55:50.629 --> 01:55:50.639 align:start position:0%
official commitments and plans to
 
01:55:52.870 --> 01:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
accelerate our shift to renewable energy
 
01:55:55.350 --> 01:55:55.360 align:start position:0%
and away from fossil fuels in lebanon
 
01:55:57.669 --> 01:55:57.679 align:start position:0%
this takes place in form of a master
 
01:55:59.830 --> 01:55:59.840 align:start position:0%
goal that we've adopted by both our
 
01:56:01.990 --> 01:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
planning board and city council
 
01:56:03.990 --> 01:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
and this is relying on
 
01:56:06.629 --> 01:56:06.639 align:start position:0%
on as much local renewable energy this
 
01:56:07.990 --> 01:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
is a commitment that we've made as
 
01:56:10.229 --> 01:56:10.239 align:start position:0%
possible not just as a city government
 
01:56:12.950 --> 01:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
but a whole city and acting consistent
 
01:56:15.109 --> 01:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
with the state's climate action plan
 
01:56:17.030 --> 01:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
with a goal of 80 reduction in
 
01:56:19.830 --> 01:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. our
 
01:56:21.910 --> 01:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
city council here in lebanon has
 
01:56:23.910 --> 01:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
unanimously endorsed the paris climate
 
01:56:26.390 --> 01:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
accord and expressed the intent to act
 
01:56:27.990 --> 01:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
in support of those goals and even
 
01:56:29.669 --> 01:56:29.679 align:start position:0%
provide leadership in this regard and
 
01:56:31.830 --> 01:56:31.840 align:start position:0%
this is part of where senate bill 102
 
01:56:34.229 --> 01:56:34.239 align:start position:0%
section 3 comes into place there is a
 
01:56:36.790 --> 01:56:36.800 align:start position:0%
growing realization that the world is in
 
01:56:39.750 --> 01:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
an accelerating climate crisis including
 
01:56:41.350 --> 01:56:41.360 align:start position:0%
the us and the action that we need to
 
01:56:43.910 --> 01:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
take locally as with union again within
 
01:56:46.070 --> 01:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
our municipalities and extending out to
 
01:56:49.350 --> 01:56:49.360 align:start position:0%
our entire communities one obstacle
 
01:56:51.669 --> 01:56:51.679 align:start position:0%
apart in our entire community one
 
01:56:53.669 --> 01:56:53.679 align:start position:0%
obstacle in new hampshire
 
01:56:55.430 --> 01:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
to this local progress
 
01:56:57.589 --> 01:56:57.599 align:start position:0%
on one of these goals is how we apply
 
01:57:00.070 --> 01:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
the property tax to renewable generation
 
01:57:01.589 --> 01:57:01.599 align:start position:0%
and storage
 
01:57:04.790 --> 01:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
more immediately most immediately as uh
 
01:57:06.550 --> 01:57:06.560 align:start position:0%
clifton below stated limiting this
 
01:57:09.109 --> 01:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
exemption to only system serving
 
01:57:10.310 --> 01:57:10.320 align:start position:0%
government will create a very
 
01:57:12.149 --> 01:57:12.159 align:start position:0%
problematic situation for lebanon and
 
01:57:14.629 --> 01:57:14.639 align:start position:0%
many other communities we don't want to
 
01:57:18.390 --> 01:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
tax third party owned pvra serving uh
 
01:57:20.149 --> 01:57:20.159 align:start position:0%
serving other serving community our
 
01:57:22.790 --> 01:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
communities property owners and most
 
01:57:25.990 --> 01:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
importantly are low and moderate income
 
01:57:28.229 --> 01:57:28.239 align:start position:0%
property owners such as
 
01:57:29.750 --> 01:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
a project here within the city of
 
01:57:32.149 --> 01:57:32.159 align:start position:0%

01:57:39.280 --> 01:57:40.470 align:start position:0%
homes served by a ppa this bill simply
creates

01:57:40.470 --> 01:57:40.480 align:start position:0%
creates
 
01:57:42.470 --> 01:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
the local option mechanism which we
 
01:57:43.910 --> 01:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
already have this
 
01:57:46.390 --> 01:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
but it creates one and extends it to it
 
01:57:48.149 --> 01:57:48.159 align:start position:0%
creates this and extends it to the third
 
01:57:51.669 --> 01:57:51.679 align:start position:0%
party's own pv array settings um
 
01:57:53.109 --> 01:57:53.119 align:start position:0%
although i would like to take your
 
01:57:55.270 --> 01:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
questions and i'm happy to as best i can
 
01:57:57.030 --> 01:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
i do rely on
 
01:57:59.430 --> 01:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
cliff below for most of for most of my
 
01:58:01.189 --> 01:58:01.199 align:start position:0%
technical assistance but simply here
 
01:58:03.350 --> 01:58:03.360 align:start position:0%
we're looking to take this local option
 
01:58:05.750 --> 01:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
that is already in place and extended to
 
01:58:05.760 --> 01:58:06.870 align:start position:0%
that is already in place and extended to
include

01:58:06.870 --> 01:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
include
 
01:58:10.070 --> 01:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
our third party owned properties
 
01:58:12.950 --> 01:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you senator uh
 
01:58:14.950 --> 01:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
you have time to take a question
 
01:58:16.629 --> 01:58:16.639 align:start position:0%
i'll do my best if i don't own a less
 
01:58:16.639 --> 01:58:19.430 align:start position:0%
i'll do my best if i don't own a less
cliff

01:58:19.430 --> 01:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:20.470 --> 01:58:20.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:58:23.510 --> 01:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
mr thank you uh senator
 
01:58:26.950 --> 01:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
apprentice um for taking my question so
 
01:58:28.950 --> 01:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
this will enable
 
01:58:28.960 --> 01:58:30.070 align:start position:0%
this will enable
uh

01:58:30.070 --> 01:58:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:58:32.390 --> 01:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
the third party distribute generation
 
01:58:36.070 --> 01:58:36.080 align:start position:0%
and distribution correct of renewable
 
01:58:36.080 --> 01:58:37.189 align:start position:0%
and distribution correct of renewable
energy

01:58:37.189 --> 01:58:37.199 align:start position:0%
energy
 
01:58:39.589 --> 01:58:39.599 align:start position:0%
it would provide for an exemption
 
01:58:39.599 --> 01:58:40.390 align:start position:0%
it would provide for an exemption
for

01:58:40.390 --> 01:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:58:40.400 --> 01:58:42.070 align:start position:0%
for
third-party

01:58:42.070 --> 01:58:42.080 align:start position:0%
third-party
 
01:58:44.070 --> 01:58:44.080 align:start position:0%
say you know third-party property owners
 
01:58:46.790 --> 01:58:46.800 align:start position:0%
so here this is a cooperative
 
01:58:49.350 --> 01:58:49.360 align:start position:0%
not just one resident that owns it
 
01:58:51.990 --> 01:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
it so it would allow for them
 
01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:52.870 align:start position:0%
it so it would allow for them
to

01:58:52.870 --> 01:58:52.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:58:54.790 --> 01:58:54.800 align:start position:0%
have the same tax exemption that
 
01:58:56.229 --> 01:58:56.239 align:start position:0%
currently i
 
01:58:58.790 --> 01:58:58.800 align:start position:0%
can have at my home if i were to put it
 
01:59:01.430 --> 01:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
on my own private piece of property here
 
01:59:03.109 --> 01:59:03.119 align:start position:0%
in the city
 
01:59:04.629 --> 01:59:04.639 align:start position:0%
because the city's already adopted that
 
01:59:06.310 --> 01:59:06.320 align:start position:0%
local option
 
01:59:09.109 --> 01:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
follow up mr chair yes
 
01:59:12.070 --> 01:59:12.080 align:start position:0%
thank you so this is for the larger
 
01:59:15.589 --> 01:59:15.599 align:start position:0%
scale not residential but larger scale
 
01:59:18.229 --> 01:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
between one megawatt to five megawatt
 
01:59:18.239 --> 01:59:19.189 align:start position:0%
between one megawatt to five megawatt
correct

01:59:19.189 --> 01:59:19.199 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:59:19.199 --> 01:59:20.870 align:start position:0%
correct
um

01:59:20.870 --> 01:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:22.550 --> 01:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
or beyond
 
01:59:24.709 --> 01:59:24.719 align:start position:0%
i don't think it goes beyond that it
 
01:59:24.719 --> 01:59:25.830 align:start position:0%
i don't think it goes beyond that it
allows

01:59:25.830 --> 01:59:25.840 align:start position:0%
allows
 
01:59:25.840 --> 01:59:26.950 align:start position:0%
allows
for

01:59:26.950 --> 01:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:59:28.709 --> 01:59:28.719 align:start position:0%
it does work behind the meter but what
 
01:59:31.910 --> 01:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
this is specific to is allowing
 
01:59:31.920 --> 01:59:33.030 align:start position:0%
this is specific to is allowing
local

01:59:33.030 --> 01:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
local
 
01:59:35.750 --> 01:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
select boards and city councils to
 
01:59:37.910 --> 01:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
decide to provide a
 
01:59:39.750 --> 01:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
tax exemption
 
01:59:42.390 --> 01:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
for the property whether again a loan or
 
01:59:45.189 --> 01:59:45.199 align:start position:0%
owned like my house or by this
 
01:59:47.990 --> 01:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
cooperative so they can take it they're
 
01:59:50.310 --> 01:59:50.320 align:start position:0%
not assessed on that value
 
01:59:53.589 --> 01:59:53.599 align:start position:0%
of the solar part of the property
 
01:59:54.669 --> 01:59:54.679 align:start position:0%
so this
 
01:59:54.679 --> 01:59:56.470 align:start position:0%
so this
incentivizes

01:59:56.470 --> 01:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
incentivizes
 
01:59:58.229 --> 01:59:58.239 align:start position:0%
renewables you know moving more towards
 
02:00:01.189 --> 02:00:01.199 align:start position:0%
renewables because that exemption is in
 
02:00:01.199 --> 02:00:02.950 align:start position:0%
renewables because that exemption is in
place

02:00:02.950 --> 02:00:02.960 align:start position:0%
place
 
02:00:05.350 --> 02:00:05.360 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you senator uh next
 
02:00:07.030 --> 02:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to hear from
 
02:00:11.030 --> 02:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
nhma doyle johnson and uh mr johnson did
 
02:00:13.430 --> 02:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
you start off with answering the
 
02:00:13.440 --> 02:00:14.390 align:start position:0%
you start off with answering the
question

02:00:14.390 --> 02:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:00:16.310 --> 02:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
as you read this legislation you
 
02:00:17.669 --> 02:00:17.679 align:start position:0%
interpret it as being enabling
 
02:00:17.679 --> 02:00:21.910 align:start position:0%
interpret it as being enabling
legislation

02:00:21.910 --> 02:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:23.510 --> 02:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:00:26.149 --> 02:00:26.159 align:start position:0%
and yes i do interpret it as being
 
02:00:26.159 --> 02:00:27.510 align:start position:0%
and yes i do interpret it as being
enabling

02:00:27.510 --> 02:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
enabling
 
02:00:32.149 --> 02:00:32.159 align:start position:0%
uh both in part one and in part two
 
02:00:36.070 --> 02:00:36.080 align:start position:0%
uh and just a clarification um
 
02:00:39.430 --> 02:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
senator perkins quoca as i heard it was
 
02:00:42.070 --> 02:00:42.080 align:start position:0%
was testifying on
 
02:00:45.030 --> 02:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
uh part one of the bill as it was filed
 
02:00:48.550 --> 02:00:48.560 align:start position:0%
in the senate which would have delayed
 
02:00:50.870 --> 02:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh reappraisals
 
02:00:52.390 --> 02:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
uh for
 
02:00:55.350 --> 02:00:55.360 align:start position:0%
a year but but that part
 
02:00:58.550 --> 02:00:58.560 align:start position:0%
was deleted by the senate so
 
02:01:00.870 --> 02:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh there only are two parts to the bill
 
02:01:00.880 --> 02:01:01.750 align:start position:0%
uh there only are two parts to the bill
now

02:01:01.750 --> 02:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:01:04.709 --> 02:01:04.719 align:start position:0%
uh part two is what you heard senator
 
02:01:07.750 --> 02:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
prentice and cliff below testifying on
 
02:01:10.070 --> 02:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
part one which i don't think anyone has
 
02:01:11.350 --> 02:01:11.360 align:start position:0%
addressed yet
 
02:01:14.550 --> 02:01:14.560 align:start position:0%
has to do with
 
02:01:18.629 --> 02:01:18.639 align:start position:0%
a slight expansion of rsa 79e
 
02:01:20.390 --> 02:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
which is the
 
02:01:23.189 --> 02:01:23.199 align:start position:0%
revitalization tax relief
 
02:01:26.390 --> 02:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh statute and that's the part that i
 
02:01:29.430 --> 02:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh wanted to speak on very briefly and
 
02:01:31.510 --> 02:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
and uh we were not involved in the
 
02:01:35.030 --> 02:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
drafting of this uh but but we support
 
02:01:36.790 --> 02:01:36.800 align:start position:0%
it um
 
02:01:41.189 --> 02:01:41.199 align:start position:0%
rsa 79e is a statute uh i'm sure some of
 
02:01:43.589 --> 02:01:43.599 align:start position:0%
you are familiar with it but it allows a
 
02:01:46.310 --> 02:01:46.320 align:start position:0%
municipality to grant
 
02:01:49.030 --> 02:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
limited property tax relief to someone
 
02:01:51.669 --> 02:01:51.679 align:start position:0%
who is engaging in
 
02:01:53.470 --> 02:01:53.480 align:start position:0%
renovation or
 
02:01:56.390 --> 02:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
revitalization and originally it was
 
02:01:59.030 --> 02:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
intended for specifically for historic
 
02:02:01.430 --> 02:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
structures but it's been expanded a few
 
02:02:03.270 --> 02:02:03.280 align:start position:0%
times over the years to include some
 
02:02:05.430 --> 02:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
other things so that if you're
 
02:02:07.270 --> 02:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
if you're
 
02:02:10.709 --> 02:02:10.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:12.550 --> 02:02:12.560 align:start position:0%
that during the period that you're
 
02:02:15.669 --> 02:02:15.679 align:start position:0%
granted tax relief you're you you do not
 
02:02:18.870 --> 02:02:18.880 align:start position:0%
have to pay taxes on the increased value
 
02:02:20.709 --> 02:02:20.719 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:02:23.669 --> 02:02:23.679 align:start position:0%
property that results from your efforts
 
02:02:23.679 --> 02:02:25.510 align:start position:0%
property that results from your efforts
and

02:02:25.510 --> 02:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:02:27.270 --> 02:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
senate bill 102
 
02:02:29.430 --> 02:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
expands that
 
02:02:32.149 --> 02:02:32.159 align:start position:0%
allows a municipality to expand it to
 
02:02:32.159 --> 02:02:34.550 align:start position:0%
allows a municipality to expand it to
include

02:02:34.550 --> 02:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
include
 
02:02:37.669 --> 02:02:37.679 align:start position:0%
residential property within a defined
 
02:02:41.750 --> 02:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
residential property revitalization zone
 
02:02:44.070 --> 02:02:44.080 align:start position:0%
and the idea is to
 
02:02:44.080 --> 02:02:44.950 align:start position:0%
and the idea is to
help

02:02:44.950 --> 02:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
help
 
02:02:47.189 --> 02:02:47.199 align:start position:0%
with the uh
 
02:02:49.430 --> 02:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
revitalization of older properties it
 
02:02:52.629 --> 02:02:52.639 align:start position:0%
has to be 40 years old or older
 
02:02:53.750 --> 02:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
and to
 
02:02:57.589 --> 02:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
help in a limited way to in increase the
 
02:03:00.390 --> 02:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
supply of housing in the state
 
02:03:03.910 --> 02:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
and because it is a local option and it
 
02:03:03.920 --> 02:03:04.709 align:start position:0%
and because it is a local option and it
it

02:03:04.709 --> 02:03:04.719 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:03:06.709 --> 02:03:06.719 align:start position:0%
would help we think
 
02:03:09.109 --> 02:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
uh to some to some extent
 
02:03:11.109 --> 02:03:11.119 align:start position:0%
with improving
 
02:03:11.119 --> 02:03:11.990 align:start position:0%
with improving
um

02:03:11.990 --> 02:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:14.229 --> 02:03:14.239 align:start position:0%
housing availability
 
02:03:16.629 --> 02:03:16.639 align:start position:0%
uh we support it i'd be happy to try to
 
02:03:18.790 --> 02:03:18.800 align:start position:0%
answer questions on that although again
 
02:03:20.310 --> 02:03:20.320 align:start position:0%
as i say we were not involved in the
 
02:03:21.910 --> 02:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
drafting of it i suspect there's
 
02:03:23.910 --> 02:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
probably someone here who could
 
02:03:23.920 --> 02:03:25.270 align:start position:0%
probably someone here who could
uh

02:03:25.270 --> 02:03:25.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:03:27.189 --> 02:03:27.199 align:start position:0%
answer more detailed questions than i
 
02:03:32.310 --> 02:03:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:35.030 --> 02:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you mr johnson
 
02:03:37.510 --> 02:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
for taking my question how does this
 
02:03:42.709 --> 02:03:42.719 align:start position:0%
relate to rsa 53 with the pace
 
02:03:46.470 --> 02:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
district and also the
 
02:03:49.350 --> 02:03:49.360 align:start position:0%
what is the term or how many years is
 
02:03:51.270 --> 02:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
this tax
 
02:03:52.870 --> 02:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
credit or
 
02:03:55.629 --> 02:03:55.639 align:start position:0%
tax exemption is under
 
02:03:59.750 --> 02:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
79e and how would change
 
02:04:02.709 --> 02:04:02.719 align:start position:0%
uh the pace legislation and i have to
 
02:04:05.750 --> 02:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
admit i am not an expert on that but but
 
02:04:05.760 --> 02:04:06.870 align:start position:0%
admit i am not an expert on that but but
that

02:04:06.870 --> 02:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:04:06.880 --> 02:04:08.390 align:start position:0%
that
uh

02:04:08.390 --> 02:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:04:11.109 --> 02:04:11.119 align:start position:0%
this is entirely separate from that this
 
02:04:14.070 --> 02:04:14.080 align:start position:0%
this is a different form of of property
 
02:04:15.750 --> 02:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
tax relief
 
02:04:15.760 --> 02:04:16.629 align:start position:0%
tax relief
um

02:04:16.629 --> 02:04:16.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:18.550 --> 02:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
the period
 
02:04:20.790 --> 02:04:20.800 align:start position:0%
under the existing law
 
02:04:20.800 --> 02:04:21.669 align:start position:0%
under the existing law
the

02:04:21.669 --> 02:04:21.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:04:25.109 --> 02:04:25.119 align:start position:0%
uh period of property tax relief
 
02:04:26.790 --> 02:04:26.800 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
02:04:29.750 --> 02:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
the governing body can grant the relief
 
02:04:32.229 --> 02:04:32.239 align:start position:0%
for a period of up to five years
 
02:04:32.239 --> 02:04:34.149 align:start position:0%
for a period of up to five years
however

02:04:34.149 --> 02:04:34.159 align:start position:0%
however
 
02:04:34.159 --> 02:04:35.510 align:start position:0%
however
um

02:04:35.510 --> 02:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:37.189 --> 02:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
it can
 
02:04:37.199 --> 02:04:38.470 align:start position:0%
it can
uh

02:04:38.470 --> 02:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:04:39.830 --> 02:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
it can
 
02:04:42.950 --> 02:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
add up to an additional two years for a
 
02:04:45.510 --> 02:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
project that results in new residential
 
02:04:45.520 --> 02:04:46.709 align:start position:0%
project that results in new residential
units

02:04:46.709 --> 02:04:46.719 align:start position:0%
units
 
02:04:48.870 --> 02:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
and up to four years
 
02:04:51.189 --> 02:04:51.199 align:start position:0%
for a project that includes affordable
 
02:04:51.199 --> 02:04:54.229 align:start position:0%
for a project that includes affordable
housing

02:04:54.229 --> 02:04:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:57.030 --> 02:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
so i think um
 
02:04:58.950 --> 02:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
and i guess the question is whether this
 
02:05:01.510 --> 02:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
would apply when someone is
 
02:05:03.109 --> 02:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
02:05:05.189 --> 02:05:05.199 align:start position:0%
creating new residential units and i
 
02:05:08.070 --> 02:05:08.080 align:start position:0%
think possibly it could
 
02:05:08.080 --> 02:05:08.790 align:start position:0%
think possibly it could
so

02:05:08.790 --> 02:05:08.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:05:10.470 --> 02:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
to the extent it includes affordable
 
02:05:16.149 --> 02:05:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:16.159 --> 02:05:17.070 align:start position:0%
 
if

02:05:17.070 --> 02:05:17.080 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:05:19.430 --> 02:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
representative had a question
 
02:05:20.629 --> 02:05:20.639 align:start position:0%
uh yes
 
02:05:26.070 --> 02:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:26.080 --> 02:05:27.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:05:27.030 --> 02:05:27.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:27.040 --> 02:05:28.709 align:start position:0%
um
on

02:05:28.709 --> 02:05:28.719 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:05:31.589 --> 02:05:31.599 align:start position:0%
page two lines uh
 
02:05:39.510 --> 02:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:39.520 --> 02:05:53.589 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:05:53.589 --> 02:05:53.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:55.430 --> 02:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
i'm having trouble hearing you but i
 
02:05:57.589 --> 02:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
think you asked is it is it similar to
 
02:06:00.629 --> 02:06:00.639 align:start position:0%
another bill that was in the committee
 
02:06:03.350 --> 02:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
is that the question yes on uh uh
 
02:06:06.070 --> 02:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
additional dwelling units uh
 
02:06:07.589 --> 02:06:07.599 align:start position:0%
six through
 
02:06:10.790 --> 02:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
uh six to eight lines who made on page
 
02:06:13.189 --> 02:06:13.199 align:start position:0%
two there was there was another bill
 
02:06:16.229 --> 02:06:16.239 align:start position:0%
that uh the house did pass and i think i
 
02:06:18.390 --> 02:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
think the senate has actually passed it
 
02:06:18.400 --> 02:06:20.070 align:start position:0%
think the senate has actually passed it
now

02:06:20.070 --> 02:06:20.080 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:06:21.910 --> 02:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
but i need to check to confirm that
 
02:06:24.310 --> 02:06:24.320 align:start position:0%
house bill 154
 
02:06:24.320 --> 02:06:25.350 align:start position:0%
house bill 154
uh

02:06:25.350 --> 02:06:25.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:06:30.149 --> 02:06:30.159 align:start position:0%
is somewhat similar to senate bill 102
 
02:06:33.589 --> 02:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
in that they both
 
02:06:39.510 --> 02:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
provide additional options under rsa 79e
 
02:06:43.589 --> 02:06:43.599 align:start position:0%
the difference is that house bill 154
 
02:06:43.599 --> 02:06:44.629 align:start position:0%
the difference is that house bill 154
is

02:06:44.629 --> 02:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:06:47.510 --> 02:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
deals specifically with
 
02:06:47.520 --> 02:06:48.550 align:start position:0%
deals specifically with
um

02:06:48.550 --> 02:06:48.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:50.470 --> 02:06:50.480 align:start position:0%
there's a requirement under
 
02:06:53.189 --> 02:06:53.199 align:start position:0%
house bill 154 that at least one third
 
02:06:54.390 --> 02:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:06:54.400 --> 02:06:55.430 align:start position:0%
of the
units

02:06:55.430 --> 02:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
units
 
02:06:56.870 --> 02:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh be
 
02:06:58.629 --> 02:06:58.639 align:start position:0%
designated as
 
02:07:01.510 --> 02:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
affordable housing for households at 80
 
02:07:04.069 --> 02:07:04.079 align:start position:0%
percent or less of the median
 
02:07:06.069 --> 02:07:06.079 align:start position:0%
income in the region
 
02:07:08.950 --> 02:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
and under house bill 104
 
02:07:08.960 --> 02:07:10.069 align:start position:0%
and under house bill 104
they

02:07:10.069 --> 02:07:10.079 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:07:12.709 --> 02:07:12.719 align:start position:0%
they are eligible for tax relief for up
 
02:07:14.470 --> 02:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
to 10 years
 
02:07:14.480 --> 02:07:15.189 align:start position:0%
to 10 years
so

02:07:15.189 --> 02:07:15.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:07:17.669 --> 02:07:17.679 align:start position:0%
house bill 104 is more
 
02:07:18.709 --> 02:07:18.719 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
02:07:21.910 --> 02:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
affordable housing senate bill 102 is
 
02:07:21.920 --> 02:07:23.430 align:start position:0%
affordable housing senate bill 102 is
more

02:07:23.430 --> 02:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:07:26.550 --> 02:07:26.560 align:start position:0%
renovating older housing stock so
 
02:07:29.510 --> 02:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
they're similar but um
 
02:07:31.189 --> 02:07:31.199 align:start position:0%
similar but different
 
02:07:33.750 --> 02:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
not not identical
 
02:07:35.430 --> 02:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
and and and they're not inconsistent
 
02:07:38.830 --> 02:07:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:42.149 --> 02:07:42.159 align:start position:0%
other you chairman i i believe that the
 
02:07:44.390 --> 02:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
bill number that
 
02:07:46.790 --> 02:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
representative is um
 
02:07:49.910 --> 02:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
referring to would be house bill 341
 
02:07:52.830 --> 02:07:52.840 align:start position:0%
sponsored by representative
 
02:07:55.910 --> 02:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
van bill required that local legislative
 
02:07:58.310 --> 02:07:58.320 align:start position:0%
bodies permit the right
 
02:08:00.950 --> 02:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
certain single family dwellings and
 
02:08:03.350 --> 02:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
residential districts to be used for up
 
02:08:06.149 --> 02:08:06.159 align:start position:0%
to four residential units
 
02:08:09.030 --> 02:08:09.040 align:start position:0%
oh that was a yeah that that was an um
 
02:08:09.040 --> 02:08:09.990 align:start position:0%
oh that was a yeah that that was an um
different

02:08:09.990 --> 02:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:08:12.310 --> 02:08:12.320 align:start position:0%
concept that that was something that
 
02:08:14.709 --> 02:08:14.719 align:start position:0%
dealt with uh zoning requirements it
 
02:08:17.669 --> 02:08:17.679 align:start position:0%
said it said you had to allow up to four
 
02:08:19.510 --> 02:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
units uh
 
02:08:21.109 --> 02:08:21.119 align:start position:0%
in areas that are zoned for single
 
02:08:22.870 --> 02:08:22.880 align:start position:0%
family dwellings
 
02:08:24.550 --> 02:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
and that and the house
 
02:08:26.149 --> 02:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
that that bill did not make it through
 
02:08:28.709 --> 02:08:28.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:28.719 --> 02:08:30.870 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:08:30.870 --> 02:08:30.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:08:32.470 --> 02:08:32.480 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chairman i had a
 
02:08:34.390 --> 02:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
separate question not related to that
 
02:08:34.400 --> 02:08:35.830 align:start position:0%
separate question not related to that
issue

02:08:35.830 --> 02:08:35.840 align:start position:0%
issue
 
02:08:37.830 --> 02:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr johnston for taking my
 
02:08:40.310 --> 02:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
question it pertains to
 
02:08:41.750 --> 02:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
part one
 
02:08:44.229 --> 02:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
and line 25
 
02:08:46.149 --> 02:08:46.159 align:start position:0%
and the
 
02:08:47.669 --> 02:08:47.679 align:start position:0%
the area that i
 
02:08:47.679 --> 02:08:48.550 align:start position:0%
the area that i
want

02:08:48.550 --> 02:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
want
 
02:08:51.830 --> 02:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
more information on is with regard to
 
02:08:56.069 --> 02:08:56.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:56.079 --> 02:08:57.669 align:start position:0%
 
for

02:08:57.669 --> 02:08:57.679 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:09:01.350 --> 02:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
an owner of a property who significantly
 
02:09:01.360 --> 02:09:02.709 align:start position:0%
an owner of a property who significantly
improves

02:09:02.709 --> 02:09:02.719 align:start position:0%
improves
 
02:09:06.069 --> 02:09:06.079 align:start position:0%
the quality condition and or use of an
 
02:09:08.950 --> 02:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
existing residential structure so my
 
02:09:10.149 --> 02:09:10.159 align:start position:0%
question is
 
02:09:12.870 --> 02:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
what what what is the criteria for
 
02:09:15.270 --> 02:09:15.280 align:start position:0%
significantly improving how is that
 
02:09:18.229 --> 02:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
determining determination made what's
 
02:09:21.910 --> 02:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
the criteria and by whom
 
02:09:23.830 --> 02:09:23.840 align:start position:0%
is that current
 
02:09:26.470 --> 02:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
that that would be determined by
 
02:09:30.310 --> 02:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:32.629 --> 02:09:32.639 align:start position:0%
if you uh if you
 
02:09:34.790 --> 02:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
continue down that page uh under
 
02:09:37.350 --> 02:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
paragraph two starting on line 27 it
 
02:09:39.270 --> 02:09:39.280 align:start position:0%
says the governing body
 
02:09:41.990 --> 02:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
um shall designate the area
 
02:09:45.189 --> 02:09:45.199 align:start position:0%
uh in which it applies and may establish
 
02:09:48.390 --> 02:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
further may further establish criteria
 
02:09:50.550 --> 02:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
for the public benefits goals and
 
02:09:52.149 --> 02:09:52.159 align:start position:0%
measures that will determine the
 
02:09:54.550 --> 02:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
eligibility of qualifying structures for
 
02:09:56.550 --> 02:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
tax relief
 
02:09:58.870 --> 02:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
so it would be it would be
 
02:10:02.149 --> 02:10:02.159 align:start position:0%
the governing body that determines um
 
02:10:03.990 --> 02:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
whether it uh
 
02:10:06.310 --> 02:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
whether it is whether it satisfies the
 
02:10:12.310 --> 02:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:15.830 --> 02:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
so therefore the governing body will um
 
02:10:18.950 --> 02:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
determine the criteria and also evaluate
 
02:10:21.350 --> 02:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
the fat criteria has been met in order
 
02:10:21.360 --> 02:10:22.470 align:start position:0%
the fat criteria has been met in order
to

02:10:22.470 --> 02:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:10:25.350 --> 02:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
obtain the tax relief that's right
 
02:10:28.870 --> 02:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative porter
 
02:10:30.629 --> 02:10:30.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you mr
 
02:10:32.470 --> 02:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
johnson i just want to make sure we
 
02:10:32.480 --> 02:10:33.589 align:start position:0%
johnson i just want to make sure we
understand

02:10:33.589 --> 02:10:33.599 align:start position:0%
understand
 
02:10:35.669 --> 02:10:35.679 align:start position:0%
get back to the issue
 
02:10:37.990 --> 02:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
that representative piemonte raised
 
02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.950 align:start position:0%
that representative piemonte raised
earlier

02:10:40.950 --> 02:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:42.709 --> 02:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
i think the bill that he was and i'd
 
02:10:45.270 --> 02:10:45.280 align:start position:0%
like mr johnson to reaffirm this if i'm
 
02:10:46.950 --> 02:10:46.960 align:start position:0%
right i think the bill that
 
02:10:50.229 --> 02:10:50.239 align:start position:0%
representative pia monte was addressing
 
02:10:53.350 --> 02:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
was knew was developing new things
 
02:10:55.350 --> 02:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
and this bill
 
02:10:57.589 --> 02:10:57.599 align:start position:0%
is not developing anything new these
 
02:10:59.350 --> 02:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
existing structures
 
02:11:02.550 --> 02:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
already are two family homes or already
 
02:11:06.390 --> 02:11:06.400 align:start position:0%
have four units in them um and this is
 
02:11:10.870 --> 02:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
simply making it um so that these these
 
02:11:13.910 --> 02:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
existing buildings can have the benefit
 
02:11:15.109 --> 02:11:15.119 align:start position:0%
of this
 
02:11:18.310 --> 02:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
um tax exemption am i correct mr
 
02:11:18.320 --> 02:11:20.229 align:start position:0%
um tax exemption am i correct mr
johnston

02:11:20.229 --> 02:11:20.239 align:start position:0%
johnston
 
02:11:20.239 --> 02:11:22.149 align:start position:0%
johnston
uh

02:11:22.149 --> 02:11:22.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:11:24.950 --> 02:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
02:11:26.470 --> 02:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
uh i'm
 
02:11:28.790 --> 02:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
i'm just looking at house bill 154 right
 
02:11:31.109 --> 02:11:31.119 align:start position:0%
now to confirm
 
02:11:35.030 --> 02:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
i was referring to house the bill that
 
02:11:35.040 --> 02:11:35.830 align:start position:0%
i was referring to house the bill that
that

02:11:35.830 --> 02:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:11:38.310 --> 02:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
sent that representative van brought
 
02:11:40.950 --> 02:11:40.960 align:start position:0%
forward three was it 340
 
02:11:43.189 --> 02:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
the one that was killed in the house
 
02:11:45.910 --> 02:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
um okay this is this is not that bill at
 
02:11:48.629 --> 02:11:48.639 align:start position:0%
all this has got nothing to do with
 
02:11:52.390 --> 02:11:52.400 align:start position:0%
creation of new housing this is just
 
02:11:54.069 --> 02:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
and updating
 
02:11:56.629 --> 02:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
what's already there yes this is this is
 
02:11:58.470 --> 02:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
entirely different
 
02:12:01.430 --> 02:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
in addition that house bill 341 was
 
02:12:03.270 --> 02:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
really a zoning bill
 
02:12:06.870 --> 02:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
this is a this is a tax relief bill so
 
02:12:09.030 --> 02:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh they they really other than the fact
 
02:12:10.870 --> 02:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
that they both had to do with housing
 
02:12:14.229 --> 02:12:14.239 align:start position:0%
they're really not not uh related at all
 
02:12:16.550 --> 02:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:12:29.430 --> 02:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:32.470 --> 02:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
and he was uh the sponsor of this a
 
02:12:34.950 --> 02:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
section of this bill so perhaps we
 
02:12:38.069 --> 02:12:38.079 align:start position:0%
should have him um give his testimony
 
02:12:39.910 --> 02:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
before we hear from the public
 
02:12:41.990 --> 02:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
yes i was going to him next
 
02:12:46.229 --> 02:12:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:48.629 --> 02:12:48.639 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you chairman dolan i'm glad
 
02:12:51.270 --> 02:12:51.280 align:start position:0%
to address uh part one

fast uh and i appreciate mr johnson's
uh

02:13:20.390 --> 02:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:13:22.310 --> 02:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
having to to answer a number of
 
02:13:24.629 --> 02:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
questions he's done a good job so you're
 
02:13:26.629 --> 02:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
already familiar with it but let me just
 
02:13:29.669 --> 02:13:29.679 align:start position:0%
point out that on page one line
 
02:13:32.310 --> 02:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
six and seven articulate that what's
 
02:13:36.470 --> 02:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
being added here is uh rsa 79
 
02:13:36.480 --> 02:13:37.990 align:start position:0%
being added here is uh rsa 79
e

02:13:37.990 --> 02:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
e
 
02:13:41.030 --> 02:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh section or paragraph four
 
02:13:41.040 --> 02:13:42.069 align:start position:0%
uh section or paragraph four
b

02:13:42.069 --> 02:13:42.079 align:start position:0%
b
 
02:13:44.709 --> 02:13:44.719 align:start position:0%
so b is the new
 
02:13:49.109 --> 02:13:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:49.119 --> 02:13:49.990 align:start position:0%
 
the

02:13:49.990 --> 02:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:13:51.910 --> 02:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
modification that
 
02:13:55.149 --> 02:13:55.159 align:start position:0%
is taking place to the existing statute
 
02:14:00.390 --> 02:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
79e2 is described on page 1 lines 25
 
02:14:02.470 --> 02:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
through 27
 
02:14:02.480 --> 02:14:04.069 align:start position:0%
through 27
defining

02:14:04.069 --> 02:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
defining
 
02:14:04.079 --> 02:14:04.870 align:start position:0%
defining
what

02:14:04.870 --> 02:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:14:04.880 --> 02:14:07.990 align:start position:0%
what
a

02:14:07.990 --> 02:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:10.629 --> 02:14:10.639 align:start position:0%
residential property is
 
02:14:13.589 --> 02:14:13.599 align:start position:0%
and then you go to page two
 
02:14:14.950 --> 02:14:14.960 align:start position:0%
line nine
 
02:14:17.510 --> 02:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh does describe then
 
02:14:17.520 --> 02:14:18.870 align:start position:0%
uh does describe then
uh

02:14:18.870 --> 02:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:14:23.270 --> 02:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh 79 e4b so there's a lot of a lot of
 
02:14:26.069 --> 02:14:26.079 align:start position:0%
verbiage before you get to and here's
 
02:14:27.189 --> 02:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
what's new
 
02:14:29.669 --> 02:14:29.679 align:start position:0%
uh and so what's new
 
02:14:32.709 --> 02:14:32.719 align:start position:0%
is uh allowing a town to or a
 
02:14:36.149 --> 02:14:36.159 align:start position:0%
municipality to establish uh tax relief
 
02:14:36.159 --> 02:14:37.030 align:start position:0%
municipality to establish uh tax relief
on

02:14:37.030 --> 02:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:14:37.040 --> 02:14:37.830 align:start position:0%
on
uh

02:14:37.830 --> 02:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:14:41.350 --> 02:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
family homes not more than four units
 
02:14:44.229 --> 02:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
that are at least 40 years in age
 
02:14:45.750 --> 02:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
and that the town
 
02:14:45.760 --> 02:14:46.709 align:start position:0%
and that the town
city

02:14:46.709 --> 02:14:46.719 align:start position:0%
city
 
02:14:48.870 --> 02:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
must designate a residential property
 
02:14:51.270 --> 02:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
revitalization zone
 
02:14:54.069 --> 02:14:54.079 align:start position:0%
that governing body shall designate both
 
02:14:58.069 --> 02:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
the area and establish criteria for the
 
02:14:59.910 --> 02:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
public good
 
02:15:03.189 --> 02:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
for that property improvement
 
02:15:04.870 --> 02:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:15:04.880 --> 02:15:05.750 align:start position:0%
and then
it

02:15:05.750 --> 02:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:15:08.870 --> 02:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
says that that property can be improved
 
02:15:12.390 --> 02:15:12.400 align:start position:0%
and qualify only once every 20 years and
 
02:15:14.550 --> 02:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
as has been previously noted it's a
 
02:15:17.189 --> 02:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
minimum of five years of
 
02:15:20.229 --> 02:15:20.239 align:start position:0%
relief on the improved valuation of the
 
02:15:20.239 --> 02:15:21.669 align:start position:0%
relief on the improved valuation of the
property

02:15:21.669 --> 02:15:21.679 align:start position:0%
property
 
02:15:23.830 --> 02:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
and can be extended if there are
 
02:15:26.629 --> 02:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
additional uh units added
 
02:15:28.950 --> 02:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
as a result of the improvement and let
 
02:15:31.189 --> 02:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
me give you a visual now
 
02:15:32.629 --> 02:15:32.639 align:start position:0%
you got the
 
02:15:34.629 --> 02:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
details of the bill but
 
02:15:37.109 --> 02:15:37.119 align:start position:0%
um if you uh
 
02:15:40.550 --> 02:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
were in downtown keene which
 
02:15:43.830 --> 02:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
has the keene state college uh within
 
02:15:46.870 --> 02:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
two blocks of our historic downtown
 
02:15:46.880 --> 02:15:47.910 align:start position:0%
two blocks of our historic downtown
district

02:15:47.910 --> 02:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
district
 
02:15:50.790 --> 02:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
uh and uh
 
02:15:53.750 --> 02:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
around the college over quite a number
 
02:15:56.550 --> 02:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
of years had been college housing
 
02:16:00.229 --> 02:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
evolving out of residential homes uh
 
02:16:04.229 --> 02:16:04.239 align:start position:0%
allowing for those to be occupied
 
02:16:07.750 --> 02:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
up to four units in those homes
 
02:16:07.760 --> 02:16:08.870 align:start position:0%
up to four units in those homes
um

02:16:08.870 --> 02:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:08.880 --> 02:16:09.910 align:start position:0%
um
then

02:16:09.910 --> 02:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:16:12.870 --> 02:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
over that period of 30 years or so 50
 
02:16:12.880 --> 02:16:15.750 align:start position:0%
over that period of 30 years or so 50
years

02:16:15.750 --> 02:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:18.709 --> 02:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
larger developers would have
 
02:16:21.430 --> 02:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
developed close to the campus so that
 
02:16:23.910 --> 02:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
you've got structures that have maybe
 
02:16:28.149 --> 02:16:28.159 align:start position:0%
100 to 150 units in those buildings
 
02:16:31.350 --> 02:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
now those residential homes are no
 
02:16:34.150 --> 02:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
longer as suitable for the college
 
02:16:36.389 --> 02:16:36.399 align:start position:0%
student housing they're not in as much
 
02:16:38.790 --> 02:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
demand because of what the enrollment
 
02:16:40.549 --> 02:16:40.559 align:start position:0%
may be at the college
 
02:16:44.070 --> 02:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
and you've got residential
 
02:16:47.349 --> 02:16:47.359 align:start position:0%
families units uh
 
02:16:50.150 --> 02:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
a budding a property that may not have
 
02:16:53.030 --> 02:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
been maintained to the same level as the
 
02:16:55.270 --> 02:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
single family unit
 
02:16:58.230 --> 02:16:58.240 align:start position:0%
next door to it and that is what we face
 
02:16:59.509 --> 02:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
in keene
 
02:17:03.190 --> 02:17:03.200 align:start position:0%
i'm sure as i drive through central
 
02:17:05.990 --> 02:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
areas of towns and cities throughout the
 
02:17:07.429 --> 02:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire throughout my
 
02:17:07.439 --> 02:17:08.709 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire throughout my
district

02:17:08.709 --> 02:17:08.719 align:start position:0%
district
 
02:17:10.870 --> 02:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
that there are similar kinds of
 
02:17:10.880 --> 02:17:12.629 align:start position:0%
that there are similar kinds of
situations

02:17:12.629 --> 02:17:12.639 align:start position:0%
situations
 
02:17:15.910 --> 02:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
where uh homes uh can
 
02:17:15.920 --> 02:17:16.790 align:start position:0%
where uh homes uh can
uh

02:17:16.790 --> 02:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:17:20.709 --> 02:17:20.719 align:start position:0%
uh be brought back to their original
 
02:17:20.719 --> 02:17:21.589 align:start position:0%
uh be brought back to their original
uh

02:17:21.589 --> 02:17:21.599 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:17:21.599 --> 02:17:22.790 align:start position:0%
uh
uh

02:17:22.790 --> 02:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:17:22.800 --> 02:17:23.750 align:start position:0%
uh
uh

02:17:23.750 --> 02:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:17:25.750 --> 02:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
presence and and
 
02:17:28.950 --> 02:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
more in keeping with the residential
 
02:17:31.349 --> 02:17:31.359 align:start position:0%
character of of the neighborhood that
 
02:17:33.349 --> 02:17:33.359 align:start position:0%
was originally established
 
02:17:34.709 --> 02:17:34.719 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
02:17:38.549 --> 02:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
uh and that that has tremendous value to
 
02:17:41.349 --> 02:17:41.359 align:start position:0%
a community not just to the aborters but
 
02:17:43.750 --> 02:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
to the entire community
 
02:17:46.629 --> 02:17:46.639 align:start position:0%
because of preserving
 
02:17:49.589 --> 02:17:49.599 align:start position:0%
the built stock and the historic nature
 
02:17:51.509 --> 02:17:51.519 align:start position:0%
of communities
 
02:17:54.309 --> 02:17:54.319 align:start position:0%
so that's what this bill is aiming to do
 
02:17:57.110 --> 02:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
and i i'm not sure if mayor
 
02:17:58.549 --> 02:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
george hansell
 
02:17:58.559 --> 02:17:59.429 align:start position:0%
george hansell
is

02:17:59.429 --> 02:17:59.439 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:17:59.439 --> 02:18:00.629 align:start position:0%
is
still

02:18:00.629 --> 02:18:00.639 align:start position:0%
still
 
02:18:02.070 --> 02:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
with us
 
02:18:04.150 --> 02:18:04.160 align:start position:0%
at this point but
 
02:18:06.309 --> 02:18:06.319 align:start position:0%
this bill while
 
02:18:08.950 --> 02:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
mr johnston is familiar with it
 
02:18:08.960 --> 02:18:10.709 align:start position:0%
mr johnston is familiar with it
because

02:18:10.709 --> 02:18:10.719 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:18:12.309 --> 02:18:12.319 align:start position:0%
it passed the
 
02:18:14.629 --> 02:18:14.639 align:start position:0%
senate last year
 
02:18:14.639 --> 02:18:15.589 align:start position:0%
senate last year
it

02:18:15.589 --> 02:18:15.599 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:18:17.910 --> 02:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
got caught up in covet and never did
 
02:18:21.110 --> 02:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
have its hearing in the house
 
02:18:21.120 --> 02:18:21.910 align:start position:0%
have its hearing in the house
but

02:18:21.910 --> 02:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:18:25.349 --> 02:18:25.359 align:start position:0%
it is a bill that
 
02:18:27.509 --> 02:18:27.519 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the support of the

i may have missed it but
 
02:19:42.870 --> 02:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh who determines what a designated
 
02:19:44.589 --> 02:19:44.599 align:start position:0%
residential property
 
02:19:47.990 --> 02:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
revitalization zone is and can it be
 
02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:49.110 align:start position:0%
revitalization zone is and can it be
changed

02:19:49.110 --> 02:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
changed
 
02:19:50.950 --> 02:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
and can it be one
 
02:19:54.870 --> 02:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:54.880 --> 02:19:55.990 align:start position:0%
 
the

02:19:55.990 --> 02:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:19:57.110 --> 02:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:19:59.830 --> 02:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
representative the governing body
 
02:20:01.670 --> 02:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
of the municipality
 
02:20:04.150 --> 02:20:04.160 align:start position:0%
will make that determination of what the
 
02:20:04.160 --> 02:20:05.910 align:start position:0%
will make that determination of what the
revitalization

02:20:05.910 --> 02:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
revitalization
 
02:20:09.429 --> 02:20:09.439 align:start position:0%
revitalization zone is and yes you're
 
02:20:12.550 --> 02:20:12.560 align:start position:0%
right it can uh move
 
02:20:14.870 --> 02:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh it it could be
 
02:20:17.670 --> 02:20:17.680 align:start position:0%
in one section of a town
 
02:20:17.680 --> 02:20:18.630 align:start position:0%
in one section of a town
uh

02:20:18.630 --> 02:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:20:21.510 --> 02:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
in in one
 
02:20:24.710 --> 02:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
point in time and moved to another
 
02:20:26.070 --> 02:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
section of
 
02:20:28.230 --> 02:20:28.240 align:start position:0%
a town
 
02:20:31.190 --> 02:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
for another period of time um
 
02:20:34.630 --> 02:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
it could be a wide swath uh that
 
02:20:36.550 --> 02:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
uh is
 
02:20:38.469 --> 02:20:38.479 align:start position:0%
and it could be a more narrow swath
 
02:20:39.750 --> 02:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
depending on
 
02:20:39.760 --> 02:20:40.550 align:start position:0%
depending on
uh

02:20:40.550 --> 02:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:20:43.270 --> 02:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
the goals of the
 
02:20:47.750 --> 02:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:50.790 --> 02:20:50.800 align:start position:0%
yes does that mean i'm i happen to be a
 
02:20:54.389 --> 02:20:54.399 align:start position:0%
selectman in a challenge tom hampstead
 
02:20:54.399 --> 02:20:56.469 align:start position:0%
selectman in a challenge tom hampstead
uh

02:20:56.469 --> 02:20:56.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:20:58.550 --> 02:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
could it be possible that that zone
 
02:21:01.510 --> 02:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
could be the whole town and if the
 
02:21:02.870 --> 02:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
governing party
 
02:21:04.309 --> 02:21:04.319 align:start position:0%
felt that this
 
02:21:05.990 --> 02:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
was worthwhile
 
02:21:10.150 --> 02:21:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:10.160 --> 02:21:10.830 align:start position:0%
 
they

02:21:10.830 --> 02:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:21:13.910 --> 02:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
could determine that that the town is a
 
02:21:13.920 --> 02:21:14.870 align:start position:0%
could determine that that the town is a
zone

02:21:14.870 --> 02:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
zone
 
02:21:19.110 --> 02:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
and uh set up an application for anybody
 
02:21:21.349 --> 02:21:21.359 align:start position:0%
uh doing this type of work
 
02:21:24.230 --> 02:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
uh if uh in fact
 
02:21:28.070 --> 02:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:32.870 --> 02:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:35.030 --> 02:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
representative power thank you mr
 
02:21:39.190 --> 02:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
chairman um and thank you
 
02:21:42.070 --> 02:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
for letting me pose my question
 
02:21:45.110 --> 02:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
this is enabling legislation and
 
02:21:47.590 --> 02:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
uh city or economy adopt this by a vote
 
02:21:49.830 --> 02:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
of the legislative body is it that by a
 
02:21:52.710 --> 02:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
majority vote or some form of a super
 
02:21:52.720 --> 02:21:55.510 align:start position:0%
majority vote or some form of a super
majority

02:21:55.510 --> 02:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:57.670 --> 02:21:57.680 align:start position:0%
no it's i think it would be a majority
 
02:22:00.230 --> 02:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
vote mr johnson is probably here and
 
02:22:02.469 --> 02:22:02.479 align:start position:0%
much more familiar but it's it's not
 
02:22:05.750 --> 02:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
anticipated that there's uh
 
02:22:05.760 --> 02:22:06.630 align:start position:0%
anticipated that there's uh
any

02:22:06.630 --> 02:22:06.640 align:start position:0%
any
 
02:22:06.640 --> 02:22:09.349 align:start position:0%
any
uh

02:22:09.349 --> 02:22:09.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:22:12.469 --> 02:22:12.479 align:start position:0%
that's my familiarity with 79e in
 
02:22:12.479 --> 02:22:13.429 align:start position:0%
that's my familiarity with 79e in
general

02:22:13.429 --> 02:22:13.439 align:start position:0%
general
 
02:22:15.990 --> 02:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh that it does not require
 
02:22:18.070 --> 02:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
uh it just requires a majority vote of
 
02:22:22.469 --> 02:22:22.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:24.309 --> 02:22:24.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you senator
 
02:22:27.510 --> 02:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
khan for taking my question this
 
02:22:27.520 --> 02:22:28.309 align:start position:0%
khan for taking my question this
is

02:22:28.309 --> 02:22:28.319 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:22:31.110 --> 02:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
a legislation that kind of helps
 
02:22:34.830 --> 02:22:34.840 align:start position:0%
facilitate the new market tax credit and
 
02:22:34.840 --> 02:22:36.469 align:start position:0%
facilitate the new market tax credit and
uh

02:22:36.469 --> 02:22:36.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:22:39.830 --> 02:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
opportunities on all those
 
02:22:43.429 --> 02:22:43.439 align:start position:0%
opportunities to revitalize uh
 
02:22:45.110 --> 02:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
older building
 
02:22:48.070 --> 02:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
into a housing or
 
02:22:49.670 --> 02:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
enabling it
 
02:22:54.790 --> 02:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:56.790 --> 02:22:56.800 align:start position:0%
environmentally friendly
 
02:22:59.590 --> 02:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:01.590 --> 02:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:23:01.600 --> 02:23:02.389 align:start position:0%
um so
this

02:23:02.389 --> 02:23:02.399 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:23:05.349 --> 02:23:05.359 align:start position:0%
a provides an incentive that
 
02:23:06.950 --> 02:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
without having to have that
 
02:23:09.349 --> 02:23:09.359 align:start position:0%
qualification a town could
 
02:23:11.190 --> 02:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
could provide
 
02:23:13.270 --> 02:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
the incentive and let me
 
02:23:15.910 --> 02:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
just qualify it too that this incentive
 
02:23:18.870 --> 02:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
is fairly small i don't think that this
 
02:23:22.070 --> 02:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
will and and just imagine
 
02:23:22.080 --> 02:23:22.870 align:start position:0%
will and and just imagine
uh

02:23:22.870 --> 02:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:23:22.880 --> 02:23:23.910 align:start position:0%
uh
the

02:23:23.910 --> 02:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:23:23.920 --> 02:23:25.429 align:start position:0%
the
uh

02:23:25.429 --> 02:23:25.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:23:27.830 --> 02:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
i believe it's seven and a half percent
 
02:23:30.710 --> 02:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
of the improved valuation
 
02:23:33.990 --> 02:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh over time so a fifty thousand
 
02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.710 align:start position:0%
uh over time so a fifty thousand
dollar

02:23:36.710 --> 02:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:36.720 --> 02:23:37.670 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:23:37.670 --> 02:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:23:40.469 --> 02:23:40.479 align:start position:0%
renovation would would wind up
 
02:23:40.479 --> 02:23:42.710 align:start position:0%
renovation would would wind up
uh

02:23:42.710 --> 02:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:23:44.630 --> 02:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
uh not being ted
 
02:23:46.389 --> 02:23:46.399 align:start position:0%
let me try this again
 
02:23:50.710 --> 02:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
on a 35 tax rate a 50 000 improvement
 
02:23:50.720 --> 02:23:51.670 align:start position:0%
on a 35 tax rate a 50 000 improvement
uh

02:23:51.670 --> 02:23:51.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:23:55.670 --> 02:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
would would wind up uh creating a
 
02:23:55.680 --> 02:23:56.710 align:start position:0%
would would wind up uh creating a
uh

02:23:56.710 --> 02:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:23:58.389 --> 02:23:58.399 align:start position:0%
about a fifteen thousand dollar
 
02:23:58.399 --> 02:24:00.230 align:start position:0%
about a fifteen thousand dollar
incentive

02:24:00.230 --> 02:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
incentive
 
02:24:02.230 --> 02:24:02.240 align:start position:0%
uh and then that would be distributed
 
02:24:05.830 --> 02:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
over a five-year period so it's it's
 
02:24:09.990 --> 02:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
it's an improvement uh to in but but
 
02:24:14.710 --> 02:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:16.950 --> 02:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
people are are still bearing the
 
02:24:19.349 --> 02:24:19.359 align:start position:0%
significant cost of the improvement
 
02:24:22.790 --> 02:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:24.790 --> 02:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
02:24:26.710 --> 02:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i'm going to see if i
 
02:24:30.230 --> 02:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
can remember my question now um so
 
02:24:32.630 --> 02:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
the governing body um
 
02:24:35.030 --> 02:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
designates the revitalization area but
 
02:24:36.309 --> 02:24:36.319 align:start position:0%
any tax
 
02:24:36.319 --> 02:24:38.230 align:start position:0%
any tax
um

02:24:38.230 --> 02:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:41.990 --> 02:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
tax breaks for it have to be approved by
 
02:24:44.870 --> 02:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
the legislative body at town meeting or
 
02:24:46.150 --> 02:24:46.160 align:start position:0%
some other way is that right
 
02:24:50.550 --> 02:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:51.990 --> 02:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
well it would be the governing body of
 
02:24:54.389 --> 02:24:54.399 align:start position:0%
the municipality so uh
 
02:24:58.469 --> 02:24:58.479 align:start position:0%
in the case of uh a city of keene i i
 
02:25:00.550 --> 02:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
know that it could be the city
 
02:25:00.560 --> 02:25:01.750 align:start position:0%
know that it could be the city
uh

02:25:01.750 --> 02:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:25:04.710 --> 02:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
uh without uh uh necessarily having to
 
02:25:06.389 --> 02:25:06.399 align:start position:0%
go to a vote
 
02:25:06.399 --> 02:25:08.150 align:start position:0%
go to a vote
uh

02:25:08.150 --> 02:25:08.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:25:10.309 --> 02:25:10.319 align:start position:0%
edit it
 
02:25:11.750 --> 02:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
there wouldn't be a warrant article on
 
02:25:11.760 --> 02:25:15.510 align:start position:0%
there wouldn't be a warrant article on
this

02:25:15.510 --> 02:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:17.110 --> 02:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
02:25:19.190 --> 02:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm just confused then because any
 
02:25:21.670 --> 02:25:21.680 align:start position:0%
time that our community has had brought
 
02:25:24.309 --> 02:25:24.319 align:start position:0%
this forward under um this section of
 
02:25:27.349 --> 02:25:27.359 align:start position:0%
the law 79e it's always come to a vote
 
02:25:29.270 --> 02:25:29.280 align:start position:0%
at town meeting whether to allow it or
 
02:25:31.830 --> 02:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
not so i'm just con
 
02:25:34.389 --> 02:25:34.399 align:start position:0%
maybe it was just a super
 
02:25:34.399 --> 02:25:36.230 align:start position:0%
maybe it was just a super
cautious

02:25:36.230 --> 02:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
cautious
 
02:25:39.030 --> 02:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
community but i understood that in order
 
02:25:41.270 --> 02:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
to give him a tax break you needed to
 
02:25:44.710 --> 02:25:44.720 align:start position:0%
get the approval of of the town
 
02:25:44.720 --> 02:25:45.990 align:start position:0%
get the approval of of the town
maybe

02:25:45.990 --> 02:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
02:25:48.550 --> 02:25:48.560 align:start position:0%

and
 
04:00:17.269 --> 04:00:17.279 align:start position:0%
myself as a slip board member in exeter
 
04:00:20.950 --> 04:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
have been hearing how hard it is for
 
04:00:23.189 --> 04:00:23.199 align:start position:0%
people to find a place to live in town

and
 
04:00:26.630 --> 04:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
uh and work in town so and we've heard
 
04:00:28.950 --> 04:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
this even from the governor that there
 
04:00:31.510 --> 04:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
is a housing shortage and so i don't
 
04:00:33.349 --> 04:00:33.359 align:start position:0%
understand why
 
04:00:35.990 --> 04:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
what is a very usable and optional a
 
04:00:37.510 --> 04:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
local decision
 
04:00:43.510 --> 04:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:45.910 --> 04:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you and you know
 
04:00:49.590 --> 04:00:49.600 align:start position:0%
the the second largest city in the state
 
04:00:53.030 --> 04:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
we here we have over 2 000 housing
 
04:00:57.110 --> 04:00:57.120 align:start position:0%
shortages 2 000 units shortage we are
 
04:00:59.110 --> 04:00:59.120 align:start position:0%
negative 5
 
04:01:02.469 --> 04:01:02.479 align:start position:0%
of available market and we have students
 
04:01:05.910 --> 04:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
we have a workforce
 
04:01:09.750 --> 04:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
and it is just incredibly i get called
 
04:01:11.830 --> 04:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
on a daily basis to see if there's a
 
04:01:14.150 --> 04:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
room to let
 
04:01:16.469 --> 04:01:16.479 align:start position:0%
and when we are in the middle of the
 
04:01:16.479 --> 04:01:17.830 align:start position:0%
and when we are in the middle of the
crisis

04:01:17.830 --> 04:01:17.840 align:start position:0%
crisis
 
04:01:19.670 --> 04:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
and we
 
04:01:22.710 --> 04:01:22.720 align:start position:0%
as a municipal and county government
 
04:01:25.910 --> 04:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
are we really addressing the need of our
 
04:01:25.920 --> 04:01:27.510 align:start position:0%
are we really addressing the need of our
constituents

04:01:27.510 --> 04:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
04:01:29.990 --> 04:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
and that's my question and i think this
 
04:01:33.349 --> 04:01:33.359 align:start position:0%
enables at least gives some kind of a
 
04:01:35.030 --> 04:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
leeway some
 
04:01:35.040 --> 04:01:35.910 align:start position:0%
leeway some
tool

04:01:35.910 --> 04:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
tool
 
04:01:38.229 --> 04:01:38.239 align:start position:0%
for the local government
 
04:01:41.990 --> 04:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
local municipalities to
 
04:01:44.950 --> 04:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
address the needs in their communities
 
04:01:46.870 --> 04:01:46.880 align:start position:0%

04:01:48.630 --> 04:01:48.640 align:start position:0%
i just cannot
 
04:01:50.070 --> 04:01:50.080 align:start position:0%
understand why
 
04:01:53.030 --> 04:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
this is being removed
 
04:01:54.389 --> 04:01:54.399 align:start position:0%

04:02:09.510 --> 04:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
recognize the
 
04:02:11.830 --> 04:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
unanimous vote that this came out with
 
04:02:13.750 --> 04:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
from the senate
 
04:02:15.750 --> 04:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
from election law and municipal affairs
 
04:02:18.070 --> 04:02:18.080 align:start position:0%
as a as a tool to address affordable
 
04:02:19.750 --> 04:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
housing in new hampshire
 
04:02:23.110 --> 04:02:23.120 align:start position:0%
i recognize the fact that we have yet to
 
04:02:26.309 --> 04:02:26.319 align:start position:0%
vote out anything that addresses
 
04:02:29.189 --> 04:02:29.199 align:start position:0%
we have yet to support um anything that
 
04:02:30.710 --> 04:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
addresses affordable housing out of
 
04:02:33.110 --> 04:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
municipal and county government uh we're
 
04:02:35.189 --> 04:02:35.199 align:start position:0%
doing our best with with each bill and
 
04:02:37.830 --> 04:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
each one keeps getting voted down so i i
 
04:02:39.750 --> 04:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
just i'm not sure how
 
04:02:41.910 --> 04:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
eliminating this entire section cleans
 
04:02:43.670 --> 04:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
up a bill
 
04:02:45.429 --> 04:02:45.439 align:start position:0%
so i will be voting against the
 
04:02:47.910 --> 04:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
amendment and continue to support all
 
04:02:50.229 --> 04:02:50.239 align:start position:0%

mr chair
 
04:09:09.590 --> 04:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
i move out to pass on senate bill 88
 
04:09:09.600 --> 04:09:11.830 align:start position:0%
i move out to pass on senate bill 88
second

04:09:11.830 --> 04:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
second
 
04:09:13.830 --> 04:09:13.840 align:start position:0%
is that representative status and second
 
04:09:15.590 --> 04:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
step it is
 
04:09:18.790 --> 04:09:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:21.349 --> 04:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
that reporter made a motion
 
04:09:23.750 --> 04:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
is there any discussion on the bill

04:09:29.590 --> 04:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
i believe this bill had pretty strong
 
04:09:31.910 --> 04:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
support in the senate we know we need to
 
04:09:33.269 --> 04:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
do something
 
04:09:35.510 --> 04:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
to expand broadband in this state there
 
04:09:37.790 --> 04:09:37.800 align:start position:0%
are many places even within cities and
 
04:09:40.389 --> 04:09:40.399 align:start position:0%
well-populated towns that don't have
 
04:09:41.750 --> 04:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
access to
 
04:09:44.790 --> 04:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
significant broadband
 
04:09:46.630 --> 04:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
this bill seems to take care of those
 
04:09:48.550 --> 04:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
needs or is at least a step in the right
 
04:09:50.229 --> 04:09:50.239 align:start position:0%
direction so
 
04:09:53.269 --> 04:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
i urge my colleagues to support
 
04:09:55.189 --> 04:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
the ought to pass motion
 
04:09:58.150 --> 04:09:58.160 align:start position:0%

it's a
bipartisan

04:19:20.630 --> 04:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:22.790 --> 04:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
vote thank you
 
04:19:26.389 --> 04:19:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:26.399 --> 04:19:27.189 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:19:27.189 --> 04:19:27.199 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:19:41.990 --> 04:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:42.000 --> 04:19:43.349 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

04:19:43.349 --> 04:19:43.359 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
04:19:46.149 --> 04:19:46.159 align:start position:0%
i i remember last year we had many
 
04:19:46.159 --> 04:19:54.229 align:start position:0%
i i remember last year we had many
exemptions

04:19:54.229 --> 04:19:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:09.269 --> 04:20:09.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:13.910 --> 04:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:13.920 --> 04:20:14.710 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:20:14.710 --> 04:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:18.389 --> 04:20:18.399 align:start position:0%
last year we had uh many exemptions
 
04:20:20.630 --> 04:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
and they were put uh
 
04:20:21.990 --> 04:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
to task
 
04:20:26.309 --> 04:20:26.319 align:start position:0%
and we felt that maybe uh that was an
 
04:20:27.830 --> 04:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to put them all together and
 
04:20:30.070 --> 04:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
have a subcommittee to vote on
 
04:20:32.309 --> 04:20:32.319 align:start position:0%
well this is another exemption
 
04:20:34.309 --> 04:20:34.319 align:start position:0%
and what makes this exemption better
 
04:20:37.830 --> 04:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
than the others we had last year
 
04:20:40.070 --> 04:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
i feel that something like this should
 
04:20:43.030 --> 04:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
be put to uh another subcommittee
 
04:20:45.910 --> 04:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
and uh see what they can come up with on
 
04:20:47.750 --> 04:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
this because
 
04:20:49.510 --> 04:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
it's just uh
 
04:20:50.870 --> 04:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:20:52.070 --> 04:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
i'm not gonna
 
04:20:54.550 --> 04:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
this could be an end round around the uh
 
04:20:56.469 --> 04:20:56.479 align:start position:0%
for another exemption that the taxpayers
 
04:20:58.309 --> 04:20:58.319 align:start position:0%
are going to have to pay for
 
04:21:01.349 --> 04:21:01.359 align:start position:0%
so that's what i have to say about that
 
04:21:03.670 --> 04:21:03.680 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
04:21:05.670 --> 04:21:05.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
04:21:07.670 --> 04:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
representative piamanchi for reminding
 
04:21:10.710 --> 04:21:10.720 align:start position:0%
us of that committee that was held there
 
04:21:13.030 --> 04:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
were a number of bills that had to do
 
04:21:14.710 --> 04:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
with veterans
 
04:21:14.720 --> 04:21:15.670 align:start position:0%
with veterans
um

04:21:15.670 --> 04:21:15.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:18.870 --> 04:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
and disabled veterans tax exemptions and
 
04:21:21.670 --> 04:21:21.680 align:start position:0%
credits and that was that was we put
 
04:21:23.910 --> 04:21:23.920 align:start position:0%
those bills aside because there was a
 
04:21:25.830 --> 04:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that was looking at the
 
04:21:28.070 --> 04:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
issue of how to deal with all the
 
04:21:30.630 --> 04:21:30.640 align:start position:0%
different exemptions that people had
 
04:21:33.990 --> 04:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
for proposing for veterans
 
04:21:34.000 --> 04:21:35.429 align:start position:0%
for proposing for veterans
the

04:21:35.429 --> 04:21:35.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:21:35.439 --> 04:21:36.710 align:start position:0%
the
tax

04:21:36.710 --> 04:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
tax
 
04:21:39.990 --> 04:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
exemptions in this bill
 
04:21:41.990 --> 04:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
is just extending
 
04:21:44.790 --> 04:21:44.800 align:start position:0%
it's just extending the definition of a
 
04:21:47.510 --> 04:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
revitalization zone to allow what we
 
04:21:48.790 --> 04:21:48.800 align:start position:0%
already have
 
04:21:51.269 --> 04:21:51.279 align:start position:0%
to be used in more circumstances so i
 
04:21:52.550 --> 04:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
think there are different kinds of
 
04:21:52.560 --> 04:21:53.750 align:start position:0%
think there are different kinds of
exemptions

04:21:53.750 --> 04:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
exemptions
 
04:21:53.760 --> 04:21:54.630 align:start position:0%
exemptions
um

04:21:54.630 --> 04:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:57.750 --> 04:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
the permanency of a veteran's exemptions
 
04:21:57.760 --> 04:21:59.269 align:start position:0%
the permanency of a veteran's exemptions
forever

04:21:59.269 --> 04:21:59.279 align:start position:0%
forever
 
04:22:00.950 --> 04:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
the tax
 
04:22:00.960 --> 04:22:03.110 align:start position:0%
the tax
tax

04:22:03.110 --> 04:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
tax
 
04:22:06.149 --> 04:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
exemption for revitalization zones
 
04:22:09.030 --> 04:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
goes away after a number of years um
 
04:22:10.870 --> 04:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
there are different sorts of exemptions
 
04:22:13.670 --> 04:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
so that's how i look at it it's yes
 
04:22:15.750 --> 04:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
other taxpayers pick up the cost when we
 
04:22:18.149 --> 04:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
give an elderly exemption or a veteran's
 
04:22:19.670 --> 04:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
exemption or a disabled
 
04:22:21.510 --> 04:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
exemption but
 
04:22:23.830 --> 04:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
in this case most cases the exemptions
 
04:22:26.870 --> 04:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
don't go away in this one they do
 
04:22:26.880 --> 04:22:28.469 align:start position:0%
don't go away in this one they do
representative

04:22:28.469 --> 04:22:28.479 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:22:30.070 --> 04:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
gilman did you know
 
04:22:33.349 --> 04:22:33.359 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair um i would agree
 
04:22:35.990 --> 04:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
with representative porter's comments uh
 
04:22:38.149 --> 04:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
the last uh
 
04:22:40.870 --> 04:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
term or whenever that we had a number of
 
04:22:43.510 --> 04:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
exemption bills they were all for
 
04:22:45.269 --> 04:22:45.279 align:start position:0%
or most of them were for elderly
 
04:22:46.870 --> 04:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
exemptions and
 
04:22:48.710 --> 04:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
exemptions from school taxes in
 
04:22:48.720 --> 04:22:50.309 align:start position:0%
exemptions from school taxes in
particular

04:22:50.309 --> 04:22:50.319 align:start position:0%
particular
 
04:22:54.380 --> 04:22:54.390 align:start position:0%
exemptions lowering the age of
 
04:22:54.390 --> 04:22:56.309 align:start position:0%
exemptions lowering the age of
[Music]

04:22:56.309 --> 04:22:56.319 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:22:58.389 --> 04:22:58.399 align:start position:0%
elderly exemption they were things that
 
04:23:00.469 --> 04:23:00.479 align:start position:0%
would be permanent from here on out the
 
04:23:02.790 --> 04:23:02.800 align:start position:0%
town would define it but
 
04:23:04.790 --> 04:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
but from that period that it becomes
 
04:23:06.950 --> 04:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
active then those exemptions you could
 
04:23:10.229 --> 04:23:10.239 align:start position:0%
apply for them every year with this
 
04:23:13.269 --> 04:23:13.279 align:start position:0%
tax relief program
 
04:23:15.750 --> 04:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
the governing body defines a set period
 
04:23:16.950 --> 04:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
of time
 
04:23:18.469 --> 04:23:18.479 align:start position:0%
where the
 
04:23:20.790 --> 04:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
tax is not exempted
 
04:23:24.389 --> 04:23:24.399 align:start position:0%
it's just the valuation stays
 
04:23:27.830 --> 04:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh at the at the cost or at the price
 
04:23:29.910 --> 04:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
when the property was
 
04:23:31.349 --> 04:23:31.359 align:start position:0%
as it was
 
04:23:33.910 --> 04:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
and then the valuation increases as the
 
04:23:36.950 --> 04:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
property gets improved and so when the
 
04:23:38.870 --> 04:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
the period of time
 
04:23:40.469 --> 04:23:40.479 align:start position:0%
that that
 
04:23:42.630 --> 04:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
tax relief is in place
 
04:23:45.510 --> 04:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer has a flat rate but once
 
04:23:48.309 --> 04:23:48.319 align:start position:0%
it's improved then the valuation goes up
 
04:23:51.269 --> 04:23:51.279 align:start position:0%
and the town is earning it more in tax
 
04:23:54.149 --> 04:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
value so i don't see these at the same
 
04:23:54.159 --> 04:23:55.110 align:start position:0%
value so i don't see these at the same
adult

04:23:55.110 --> 04:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
adult
 
04:23:57.750 --> 04:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
excuse me at all because one gives you
 
04:23:59.990 --> 04:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
valuation gives you extra value and more
 
04:24:02.630 --> 04:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
income in the end whereas the others
 
04:24:04.790 --> 04:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
that we heard before just exempted the
 
04:24:06.550 --> 04:24:06.560 align:start position:0%
taxes outright and left the burden on
 
04:24:08.550 --> 04:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
the rest of us paying taxes
 
04:24:12.790 --> 04:24:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:15.750 --> 04:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um and to piggyback
 
04:24:18.870 --> 04:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
representative gilman says this then
 
04:24:22.870 --> 04:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
provides that just little bit of relief
 
04:24:25.030 --> 04:24:25.040 align:start position:0%
in in a time where
 
04:24:27.910 --> 04:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
the affordability of housing
 
04:24:29.429 --> 04:24:29.439 align:start position:0%
not affordable housing but the
 
04:24:32.469 --> 04:24:32.479 align:start position:0%
affordability of housing based on our
 
04:24:36.790 --> 04:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:38.950 --> 04:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
you're giving somebody just a little bit
 
04:24:42.149 --> 04:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
of relief at the discretion of the town
 
04:24:43.670 --> 04:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
so i i
 
04:24:46.630 --> 04:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
i see this as not being um
 
04:24:49.189 --> 04:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
i i see this as being transparent open
 
04:24:51.510 --> 04:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
and honest about the availability for
 
04:24:54.070 --> 04:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
just this one little potential
 
04:24:57.349 --> 04:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
um where local authority still exists
 
04:25:00.950 --> 04:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
um where full disclosure is required
 
04:25:03.030 --> 04:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
uh and i and i don't see how there could
 
04:25:06.550 --> 04:25:06.560 align:start position:0%
be any um any i'm i'm hesitant to use
 
04:25:09.510 --> 04:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
the the the term but uh end arounds here
 
04:25:09.520 --> 04:25:10.229 align:start position:0%
the the the term but uh end arounds here
so

04:25:10.229 --> 04:25:10.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:25:12.229 --> 04:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
i i would hope that the committee would
 
04:25:14.790 --> 04:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
would support this bill and
 
04:25:16.550 --> 04:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
and provide that little bit of relief
 
04:25:18.469 --> 04:25:18.479 align:start position:0%
for our communities thank you
 
04:25:20.550 --> 04:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative guthrie
 
04:25:22.070 --> 04:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i'd just like to
 
04:25:23.830 --> 04:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
make a couple of comments
 
04:25:25.670 --> 04:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh as we go along with this bill
 
04:25:27.990 --> 04:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
particularly about section one i always
 
04:25:31.030 --> 04:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
like the word may when i see a wooden a
 
04:25:32.950 --> 04:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
as a selectmen it makes me feel a little
 
04:25:36.070 --> 04:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
more comfortable and i think that this
 
04:25:40.149 --> 04:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
uh bill particularly section uh one
 
04:25:40.159 --> 04:25:41.269 align:start position:0%
uh bill particularly section uh one
uh

04:25:41.269 --> 04:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:25:42.550 --> 04:25:42.560 align:start position:0%
gives a
 
04:25:43.750 --> 04:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
two byte
 
04:25:46.550 --> 04:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
situation where i think they have to go
 
04:25:49.510 --> 04:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
to the legislative party to
 
04:25:52.070 --> 04:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh okay where the zone is going to be
 
04:25:55.349 --> 04:25:55.359 align:start position:0%
and i then they the individual select
 
04:25:58.070 --> 04:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
board would have to uh vote on each
 
04:25:58.080 --> 04:25:59.349 align:start position:0%
board would have to uh vote on each
individual

04:25:59.349 --> 04:25:59.359 align:start position:0%
individual
 
04:26:00.790 --> 04:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
uh item
 
04:26:02.950 --> 04:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
or request rather
 
04:26:05.429 --> 04:26:05.439 align:start position:0%
and i particularly like the fact that it
 
04:26:06.630 --> 04:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
looks like
 
04:26:09.349 --> 04:26:09.359 align:start position:0%
uh the interpretation is good as you
 
04:26:10.870 --> 04:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
could even have
 
04:26:14.309 --> 04:26:14.319 align:start position:0%
the revitalization zone the whole town
 
04:26:16.389 --> 04:26:16.399 align:start position:0%
so that would be able to
 
04:26:18.790 --> 04:26:18.800 align:start position:0%
have the selectmen and the town
 
04:26:20.469 --> 04:26:20.479 align:start position:0%
nitpicked if you will
 
04:26:23.110 --> 04:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
uh areas where they need the help
 
04:26:25.110 --> 04:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
particularly if you don't have just one
 
04:26:27.990 --> 04:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
area that needs redu development but you
 
04:26:31.429 --> 04:26:31.439 align:start position:0%
have pockets within the community so i'm
 
04:26:33.349 --> 04:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
going to vote for the bill i
 
04:26:35.830 --> 04:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
i hope it gets some use
 
04:26:38.950 --> 04:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
and that people use discretion
 
04:26:38.960 --> 04:26:40.870 align:start position:0%
and that people use discretion
has

04:26:40.870 --> 04:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
has
 
04:26:43.110 --> 04:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
been concerned about
 
04:26:45.590 --> 04:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
another abatement so
 
04:26:47.830 --> 04:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
but i think it's a tool that's uh i'd
 
04:26:49.910 --> 04:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
like to have him right private as a
 
04:26:49.920 --> 04:26:54.149 align:start position:0%
like to have him right private as a
builder

04:26:54.149 --> 04:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:55.910 --> 04:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
representative porter made a promotion

04:27:00.550 --> 04:27:00.560 align:start position:0%
house senator bill 102 is there any
 
04:27:03.269 --> 04:27:03.279 align:start position:0%

thank you thank you for recognizing me i
 
04:27:17.030 --> 04:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
think this gives uh new hampshire

communities a chance to revitalize their
 
04:27:23.110 --> 04:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
old mill buildings buildings that are
 
04:27:26.550 --> 04:27:26.560 align:start position:0%
not paying taxes in terms of uh their
 
04:27:31.189 --> 04:27:31.199 align:start position:0%
communities and this will give incentive
 
04:27:34.389 --> 04:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
