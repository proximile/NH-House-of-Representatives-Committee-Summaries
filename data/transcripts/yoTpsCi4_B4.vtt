uh the last session last week
 
00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 align:start position:0%
but at lunch break it took him about 15
 
00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 align:start position:0%
minutes to walk from
 
00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 align:start position:0%

and uh they said i mean he's having
 
00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 align:start position:0%
trouble walking now so
 
00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 align:start position:0%
um he won't be around this week and
 
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 align:start position:0%
we'll just take it week by week just so
 
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639 align:start position:0%
so i i'm going to be chairing these two
 
00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:19.830 align:start position:0%
so i i'm going to be chairing these two
bills

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.110 align:start position:0%
bills
and

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 align:start position:0%
in the calendar they're called work
 
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
sessions the clerk
 
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 align:start position:0%
paul smith
 
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
suggested we we put them in the calendar
 
00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 align:start position:0%
that way they're technically hearings
 
00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:31.749 align:start position:0%
that way they're technically hearings
but

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:31.759 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 align:start position:0%
but we're calling on work sessions so
 
00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:36.070 align:start position:0%
but we're calling on work sessions so
so

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
and we're we're going to take 313
 
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 align:start position:0%
first and then uh and then uh 3
 
00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
79 second
 
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.230 align:start position:0%
79 second
so

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 align:start position:0%
uh 313
 
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
uh past 17 nothing out of the edna
 
00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
committee and passed on a voice vote
 
00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 align:start position:0%
on the floor
 
00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 align:start position:0%
um fortunately we have carol mcguire's
 
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
is here
 
00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh chair of edna to explain
 
00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639 align:start position:0%
uh what was done in 313 when it when it
 
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 align:start position:0%
came over from the senate
 
00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:11.199 align:start position:0%
it had had another section in it
 
00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 align:start position:0%
that was
 
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh amended out
 
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
and that
 
00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
wound up in
 
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.790 align:start position:0%
wound up in
in

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639 align:start position:0%
and they put it into
 
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 align:start position:0%
senate bill 330
 
00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.990 align:start position:0%
senate bill 330
and

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
reps and mcguire if you can't help us
 
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
out the history of this i think it goes
 
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
back to senate bill 38 last session
 
00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
58 last session and what happened i
 
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 align:start position:0%
don't know about where it started last
 
00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:42.639 align:start position:0%
year but since the oplc has started
 
00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
and what was it was created
 
00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:47.759 align:start position:0%
and it had the authority to set fees we
 
00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
have been piece by piece cleaning up
 
00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:54.639 align:start position:0%
section 30
 
00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
with where all the boards originally had
 
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
the authority to set fees and in many
 
00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
cases the fees were in statute
 
00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
so we have been
 
00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
repeatedly going through
 
00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:09.199 align:start position:0%
every time we deal with the board we
 
00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:11.759 align:start position:0%
check that the fee authority is correct
 
00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
that is they don't set the fee they just
 
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
collect it with their applications
 
00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.909 align:start position:0%
collect it with their applications
usually

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:17.919 align:start position:0%
usually
 
00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:21.350 align:start position:0%
usually
and

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
so it's always a conflict because the
 
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
oplc has authority to set fees for all
 
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
the boards under its purview
 
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
but meanwhile other boards
 
00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:35.199 align:start position:0%
still have in statute their own fees
 
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
which are
 
00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:39.919 align:start position:0%
therefore in conflict so 313 is this
 
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
year's version of how to fix that
 
00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.150 align:start position:0%
year's version of how to fix that
um

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
so it listed
 
00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:48.479 align:start position:0%
as it came to edna
 
00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:54.560 align:start position:0%
starting on page two a nice long
 
00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
suggestion list of various fees
 
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
that were being deleted and boards that
 
00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:01.670 align:start position:0%
that were being deleted and boards that
were

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:03.919 align:start position:0%
whose statute was being amended to talk
 
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
about the fee set by the oplc rather
 
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
than by themselves
 
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:16.479 align:start position:0%
it's on
 
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
because we're streamed
 
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.909 align:start position:0%
because we're streamed
um

00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:19.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:21.919 align:start position:0%
could you the first time you use a set
 
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
of initials
 
00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
say what it is
 
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
certainly thank you and just for the
 
00:07:29.589 --> 00:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
record i'm carol mcguire

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.589 align:start position:0%
the chair of the house edna committee i

00:07:37.589 --> 00:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:39.919 align:start position:0%
did the work on this particular bill in
 
00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:41.670 align:start position:0%
did the work on this particular bill in
committee

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
i will say that due to excellent
 
00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
scheduling on the part of everybody
 
00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
we got the bill on
 
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
wednesday afternoon heard at the
 
00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:54.400 align:start position:0%
heard it the following friday and
 
00:07:57.189 --> 00:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
executed on tuesday so we did not give
 
00:07:59.670 --> 00:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
it our usual thorough combing
 
00:08:02.869 --> 00:08:02.879 align:start position:0%
we did verify that we agreed with all of
 
00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
the sections that it contained we didn't
 
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
have the time to go and add additional
 
00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
sections that might also have that same
 
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
situation so we
 
00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
relatively accurate but it is not
 
00:08:19.029 --> 00:08:19.039 align:start position:0%
complete as you can see from the
 
00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
amendment representative alby is
 
00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:22.240 align:start position:0%
bringing forward
 
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
we looked at the study
 
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
committee and while we don't disagree
 
00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
with the need to look at the fees and
 
00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
how they're set
 
00:08:33.269 --> 00:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
we thought it would make more sense to
 
00:08:35.829 --> 00:08:35.839 align:start position:0%
combine it with the study committee in
 
00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
senate bill 330 which was about the
 
00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
operations of the oplc because the study
 
00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.430 align:start position:0%
operations of the oplc because the study
committee

00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
excuse me because the fees are set in
 
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
order to cover costs so if you don't
 
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
look at what you're doing
 
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
as an operation you don't know how much
 
00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
to charge
 
00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
the usual thing for the boards is to
 
00:08:59.509 --> 00:08:59.519 align:start position:0%
keep charging what they've been charging
 
00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:02.720 align:start position:0%
which means that some of the boards
 
00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
accountancy is one i know
 
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
because they're the first one in the in
 
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
the packet i get
 
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:12.160 align:start position:0%
they have not two extreme fees but
 
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
they're an extremely well-behaved board
 
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
that is administered very cheaply and
 
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
they provide us every year
 
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
there are other boards where the fees
 
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
don't even cover their costs let alone
 
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
a little extra for on
 
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.710 align:start position:0%
a little extra for on
emergencies

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:28.720 align:start position:0%
emergencies
 
00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:32.240 align:start position:0%
so we need to look at how things are run
 
00:09:34.389 --> 00:09:34.399 align:start position:0%
and then consider how the fees are
 
00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
collect are set um also it looked from
 
00:09:39.509 --> 00:09:39.519 align:start position:0%
the definition of who was going to be on
 
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
those those committees that i know
 
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
at least one of the persons who would be
 
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:46.240 align:start position:0%
logically appointed to both of them and
 
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
i couldn't see doing that
 
00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:51.200 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:53.519 align:start position:0%
we deleted the study committee from
 
00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
senate bill 313
 
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
the version that karen was handing out
 
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
is the version as amended by the senate
 
00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:04.160 align:start position:0%
so the version as amended by the house
 
00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
deletes page one and page two up to line
 
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:14.069 --> 00:10:14.079 align:start position:0%
representative almi has an amendment
 
00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
that i'm sure she'll talk about
 
00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
which i support what it does is it
 
00:10:22.389 --> 00:10:22.399 align:start position:0%
continues establishing
 
00:10:24.069 --> 00:10:24.079 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
board doesn't set the fees for a number
 
00:10:28.949 --> 00:10:28.959 align:start position:0%
of different boards that we haven't had
 
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
we didn't have the time to look into
 
00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:32.389 align:start position:0%
we didn't have the time to look into
so

00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
there's we have no objection about it
 
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
and in fact support cleaning up as many
 
00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
statutes as we can at one time
 
00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:50.399 --> 00:10:51.350 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:55.509 --> 00:10:55.519 align:start position:0%
so does the 125 rule still apply to this
 
00:10:59.110 --> 00:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
yes the oplc has a requirement that the
 
00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
total fees minus total expense that the
 
00:11:04.389 --> 00:11:04.399 align:start position:0%
total fees are 125 percent of total
 
00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
expenses right and they're trying to
 
00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
allocate it to the individual boards as
 
00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:09.990 align:start position:0%
allocate it to the individual boards as
well

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.509 align:start position:0%
well
but

00:11:11.509 --> 00:11:11.519 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:11:14.069 --> 00:11:14.079 align:start position:0%
some of the boards are either so tiny or
 
00:11:14.079 --> 00:11:15.910 align:start position:0%
some of the boards are either so tiny or
so

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
swingy i mean the board of of real
 
00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
estate people real estate brokers
 
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
has when real estate is big they've got
 
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
hundreds of new new licensees and they
 
00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
bring in more fees when the market
 
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
collapses they barely cover their cost
 
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
so you have to to look at it as an
 
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
overall deal rather than
 
00:11:38.069 --> 00:11:38.079 align:start position:0%
expecting every single board to hit it
 
00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:40.720 align:start position:0%
125 percent every year okay thank you
 
00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
well representative has a question
 
00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:48.000 align:start position:0%

couple of questions
um

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:51.360 align:start position:0%

00:11:58.550 --> 00:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
included the first paragraph that would
 
00:11:59.590 --> 00:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
be on this
 
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
bill we have in front of us lines one
 
00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
through nine
 
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
on page
 
00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.430 align:start position:0%
on page

00:12:08.389 --> 00:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
i'm afraid i don't remember okay
 
00:12:08.399 --> 00:12:09.350 align:start position:0%
i'm afraid i don't remember okay
um

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.790 align:start position:0%
um
follow follow-up

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
follow follow-up
 
00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.069 align:start position:0%
follow follow-up
yes

00:12:12.069 --> 00:12:12.079 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire
 
00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
ways and means is charged with a full
 
00:12:19.269 --> 00:12:19.279 align:start position:0%
evaluation of fees and supplicability
 
00:12:21.269 --> 00:12:21.279 align:start position:0%
the revenue to the state
 
00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
am i mistaken but you're chain taking it
 
00:12:25.509 --> 00:12:25.519 align:start position:0%
out of the ways and means
 
00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
and putting it out to an administrative
 
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
body to set a fee
 
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry you're taking it away from
 
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
ways and means
 
00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
the setting of a fee
 
00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
and then moving it to an administrative
 
00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:41.990 align:start position:0%
and then moving it to an administrative
body

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:43.829 --> 00:12:43.839 align:start position:0%
representative hollery the
 
00:12:45.829 --> 00:12:45.839 align:start position:0%
different boards have been setting their
 
00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:49.279 align:start position:0%
own fees for years
 
00:12:51.509 --> 00:12:51.519 align:start position:0%
decades as far as i know they decide
 
00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
what their
 
00:12:55.509 --> 00:12:55.519 align:start position:0%
their expenses are they develop the fees
 
00:12:57.990 --> 00:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
they don't normally come to you
 
00:12:59.910 --> 00:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
with their new fees
 
00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
they might
 
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
in many cases they set their fees in
 
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
rule and they're brought before jail car
 
00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
and at least one member of this
 
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:10.720 align:start position:0%
committee is also a member of jail car
 
00:13:12.949 --> 00:13:12.959 align:start position:0%
in fact there's two usually
 
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
um so we look at
 
00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.110 align:start position:0%
um so we look at
the

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
jail car as your delegate looks at the
 
00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:25.269 --> 00:13:25.279 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
one of the chair yeah
 
00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:28.240 align:start position:0%
the question
 
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
we've been working with a lot of
 
00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
different fees over the last several
 
00:13:34.389 --> 00:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
years to move them into law
 
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
i know i that's that's the thing when we
 
00:13:37.829 --> 00:13:37.839 align:start position:0%
saw this
 
00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:40.240 align:start position:0%
something happened a couple of years ago
 
00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:42.160 align:start position:0%
there was a bill passed
 
00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:44.959 align:start position:0%
that last year i did it was a 58
 
00:13:47.509 --> 00:13:47.519 align:start position:0%
was it the house
 
00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
yeah i think it's 58. um i don't know if
 
00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
it's a senate bill i think it was a
 
00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
senate bill it probably was the senate
 
00:13:55.509 --> 00:13:55.519 align:start position:0%
bill yes it was it was gaida and
 
00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
something else so
 
00:13:58.710 --> 00:13:58.720 align:start position:0%
that changed all of that we weren't
 
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
aware of it
 
00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:02.240 align:start position:0%
it just must have just been on consent
 
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
calendar or something we we didn't
 
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
realize that because well i i know
 
00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
representative almi and myself
 
00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
maybe six or seven years ago
 
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
spent a lot of time
 
00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
trying to equalize and those have been
 
00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:15.670 align:start position:0%
trying to equalize and those have been
around

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:17.519 align:start position:0%
all these making sure they were within
 
00:14:19.829 --> 00:14:19.839 align:start position:0%
the 125 and all of that
 
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
and we didn't we didn't learn about this
 
00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
change and now now it's in the hands of
 
00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
it's who's it in the hands of
 
00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
right now the oplc has the authority to
 
00:14:33.829 --> 00:14:33.839 align:start position:0%
set the fees for all the boards
 
00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
under their purview and those those
 
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
rules are those fees are set in rules
 
00:14:42.069 --> 00:14:42.079 align:start position:0%
right not in statute
 
00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
if you wish to change that decision
 
00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
i i think it would make sense to at
 
00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
least wait to figure have them fig the
 
00:14:52.069 --> 00:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
study committee completed because
 
00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
we don't know how the operation works
 
00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.430 align:start position:0%
we don't know how the operation works
and

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:56.720 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:14:58.870 --> 00:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
some boards that think it's everything's
 
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
peachy keen
 
00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
except their fees are too high
 
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
and there are others that say it's a
 
00:15:06.069 --> 00:15:06.079 align:start position:0%
total mess and we can't get done what we
 
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
need to get done
 
00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:10.720 align:start position:0%
so i'm i want the study committee in
 
00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:12.959 align:start position:0%
senate bill 330 is looking at the
 
00:15:14.949 --> 00:15:14.959 align:start position:0%
overall operations
 
00:15:14.959 --> 00:15:15.829 align:start position:0%
overall operations
and

00:15:15.829 --> 00:15:15.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
i think that's necessary before you try
 
00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
and claw back the fee authority and so
 
00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
just and i was over yesterday to talk to
 
00:15:26.069 --> 00:15:26.079 align:start position:0%
you and uh i requested that we have two
 
00:15:27.509 --> 00:15:27.519 align:start position:0%
two members
 
00:15:29.749 --> 00:15:29.759 align:start position:0%
um from ways and means included i'm
 
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
assuming that happened i'm afraid it
 
00:15:34.069 --> 00:15:34.079 align:start position:0%
didn't we were on our fifth iteration of
 
00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
the amendment to senate bill 330 by the
 
00:15:38.949 --> 00:15:38.959 align:start position:0%
time we got finished at six o'clock last
 
00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
night and we didn't want to go another
 
00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
round to include ways and means it has
 
00:15:46.389 --> 00:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
three at the moment it has three house
 
00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
members one of whom is not
 
00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:52.160 align:start position:0%
whose alliance is not us or his back is
 
00:15:54.389 --> 00:15:54.399 align:start position:0%
whose committee is not assigned and we
 
00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
recommended that that should be from
 
00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
ways and means
 
00:16:00.389 --> 00:16:00.399 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't does it say that and
 
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
it didn't say that does it say that in
 
00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:04.240 align:start position:0%
the amendment no
 
00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
would you mind if we do a floor
 
00:16:07.749 --> 00:16:07.759 align:start position:0%
amendment to include ways of means
 
00:16:10.629 --> 00:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
not at all we we thought ways and means
 
00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
was another logical committee to have
 
00:16:15.189 --> 00:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
people there we did want to have
 
00:16:18.069 --> 00:16:18.079 align:start position:0%
edna because we deal with licensing and
 
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
health and human services because so
 
00:16:22.069 --> 00:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
many of the licenses we and the
 
00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
operations the roplc are in the health
 
00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:26.310 align:start position:0%
operations the roplc are in the health
sector

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
sector
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
and those are always the most
 
00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
problematical ones
 
00:16:32.629 --> 00:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative oh well
 
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
let representative romney have
 
00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:38.470 align:start position:0%
let representative romney have
transfers

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:41.269 --> 00:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
okay i uh first i just wanted to point
 
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
out that
 
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
under the rules of the house this
 
00:16:48.389 --> 00:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
committee is supposed to deal with fees
 
00:16:48.399 --> 00:16:49.509 align:start position:0%
committee is supposed to deal with fees
and

00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:49.519 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:16:51.189 --> 00:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
that's why
 
00:16:51.199 --> 00:16:53.269 align:start position:0%
that's why
um

00:16:53.269 --> 00:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
representative abrami and i spent
 
00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:57.590 align:start position:0%
representative abrami and i spent
uh

00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:16:59.670 --> 00:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
about four months
 
00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
over a summer working with all of the
 
00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
medical and health groups that
 
00:17:07.669 --> 00:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
boards and commissions that
 
00:17:10.549 --> 00:17:10.559 align:start position:0%
other than the big ones the doctors and
 
00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
the nurses
 
00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:12.789 align:start position:0%
the nurses
on

00:17:12.789 --> 00:17:12.799 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:17:12.799 --> 00:17:14.470 align:start position:0%
on
that

00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:17:17.429 --> 00:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
to try and bring all of their fees into
 
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
some kind of consolidated order and that
 
00:17:23.189 --> 00:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
in turn led to
 
00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
changing the entire olpc so that yes i i
 
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
worked with the results of your
 
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
study and
 
00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:34.720 align:start position:0%
implemented putting a large number of
 
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
fees into statute particularly for the
 
00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
smaller boards
 
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
and we did that um
 
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
some years ago yeah and
 
00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
it is a question of whether we want to
 
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
have the fees in statute or rule
 
00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:51.830 align:start position:0%
have the fees in statute or rule
and

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
at the moment it's the pendulum has
 
00:17:56.789 --> 00:17:56.799 align:start position:0%
swung to put them into role
 
00:17:58.870 --> 00:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
i personally think statute is more
 
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
i keep getting outvoted
 
00:18:07.029 --> 00:18:07.039 align:start position:0%
that's interesting
 
00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.350 align:start position:0%
thank you
on

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:10.710 align:start position:0%
on
we

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:10.720 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
one of the problems with jail car
 
00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
handling the fees is that if there isn't
 
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
a clear definition in
 
00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
in statute of what the fee is for
 
00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
how much it
 
00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
you you can't really decide how much it
 
00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
should be
 
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
and i know this has been discussed in
 
00:18:32.789 --> 00:18:32.799 align:start position:0%
jail car because i know representative
 
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
hatch keeps bringing it up
 
00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
but he used to be on ways and means
 
00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
uh yes
 
00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:40.870 align:start position:0%
uh yes
so

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
so that that is a long-term kind of
 
00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:47.200 align:start position:0%
consideration that we're worried about
 
00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
the the thing is is how granular do you
 
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
want to be with the fees
 
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
does you know do you want every single
 
00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
board to maintain 125
 
00:18:58.630 --> 00:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
every year well
 
00:18:59.669 --> 00:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
good luck
 
00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a constant moving
 
00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:05.039 align:start position:0%
target if you want to have the
 
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
the all the boards together or some
 
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
subset of boards to do 125 every year
 
00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
you've got a better chance if you want
 
00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
to have all the boards average 125
 
00:19:19.029 --> 00:19:19.039 align:start position:0%
percent over a biennium
 
00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
that's probably much easier
 
00:19:23.669 --> 00:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
i wanted to ask you about one odd man
 
00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
out yes in which is the manufactured
 
00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:28.799 align:start position:0%
housing board
 
00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
which a group of us has been trying to
 
00:19:33.029 --> 00:19:33.039 align:start position:0%
add another board to that is the same
 
00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
kind of thing
 
00:19:38.789 --> 00:19:38.799 align:start position:0%
and it was never set up with the ability
 
00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
to pay for itself
 
00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
because trailer park
 
00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
tenants don't have much money and so
 
00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
they pay
 
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
pay a fee to make a complaint but
 
00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't end up paying for squat
 
00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:58.789 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't end up paying for squat
so

00:19:58.789 --> 00:19:58.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh that's our choice how yeah how
 
00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
how you handle that it wasn't i think it
 
00:20:07.029 --> 00:20:07.039 align:start position:0%
was originally sort of assigned to the
 
00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:10.799 align:start position:0%
predecessor of olpc
 
00:20:10.799 --> 00:20:11.990 align:start position:0%
predecessor of olpc
but

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:20:14.149 --> 00:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
and it makes a lot of administrative
 
00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:16.240 align:start position:0%
sense efficiency
 
00:20:18.149 --> 00:20:18.159 align:start position:0%
uh considerations
 
00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
to leave it there but how do you how are
 
00:20:23.029 --> 00:20:23.039 align:start position:0%
you handling that one
 
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
maybe it's inside of the 25 of 125
 
00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
well it could well be i mean the
 
00:20:36.549 --> 00:20:36.559 align:start position:0%
when uh
 
00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
as i understood it some years ago 125
 
00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
was meant for the 100 to cover their
 
00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
basic expenses the 25 percent to cover
 
00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
either things that don't happen every
 
00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
year like hiring a rule writer to update
 
00:20:52.549 --> 00:20:52.559 align:start position:0%
your rules or a complex investigation
 
00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
where you needed more attorneys or
 
00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
that was my understanding of why 125
 
00:21:03.669 --> 00:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
is we
 
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
well this goes back quite a long way
 
00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
when we were getting trained by the
 
00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
legislative assistant
 
00:21:14.789 --> 00:21:14.799 align:start position:0%
about this stuff but that the
 
00:21:14.799 --> 00:21:15.990 align:start position:0%
about this stuff but that the
25

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
25
 
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
was considered to be an allowable amount
 
00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:19.830 align:start position:0%
was considered to be an allowable amount
by

00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
certain courts
 
00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
to add on for the general expenses of
 
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
the state apparatus to help that
 
00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.669 align:start position:0%
the state apparatus to help that
particular

00:21:29.669 --> 00:21:29.679 align:start position:0%
particular
 
00:21:29.679 --> 00:21:30.470 align:start position:0%
particular
fund

00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:21:33.909 --> 00:21:33.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
representative bursting and then
 
00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
number thank you mr chair and thank you
 
00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
for taking taking my question
 
00:21:41.029 --> 00:21:41.039 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire
 
00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
back to the committee i'm a little
 
00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
confused because you had
 
00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
said you wanted one member to be from
 
00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:48.070 align:start position:0%
said you wanted one member to be from
hhs

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
hhs
 
00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:49.669 align:start position:0%
hhs
also

00:21:49.669 --> 00:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
ways and means wants to be represented
 
00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
but as the bill reads now there's three
 
00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
members from the house two of which are
 
00:21:58.390 --> 00:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
from edna no excuse me representative
 
00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
bernstein you are looking at the version
 
00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
of 313 as amended by the senate you are
 
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
not looking at house bill 330 as amended
 
00:22:09.029 --> 00:22:09.039 align:start position:0%
by the house which is not yet available
 
00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:10.720 align:start position:0%
we haven't passed it
 
00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
that has a
 
00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
a committee of four members at the
 
00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
moment one senator one person from edna
 
00:22:19.909 --> 00:22:19.919 align:start position:0%
one representative from edna one
 
00:22:21.909 --> 00:22:21.919 align:start position:0%
representative from hhs and an
 
00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
unspecified representative which we
 
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
recommend should be from ways and means
 
00:22:29.669 --> 00:22:29.679 align:start position:0%
if you put out a floor amendment to add
 
00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
a and a ways and means member
 
00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
specifically or two of them we'd be
 
00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
happy we're perfectly okay with that
 
00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:37.029 align:start position:0%
happy we're perfectly okay with that
we

00:22:37.029 --> 00:22:37.039 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:22:39.029 --> 00:22:39.039 align:start position:0%
as i said we were we were chasing
 
00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
amendments all day yesterday i got it i
 
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
representative schaumburg
 
00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative for taking
 
00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:53.200 align:start position:0%
my question i guess
 
00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:00.549 --> 00:23:00.559 align:start position:0%
i need a clear understanding of of
 
00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
what these organizations these boards
 
00:23:05.909 --> 00:23:05.919 align:start position:0%
do do they not have a set cost every
 
00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
year of
 
00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
is it to pay for secretaries they do
 
00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
the what the boards do is that every
 
00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
year they license some number of
 
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.430 align:start position:0%
year they license some number of
professionals

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
professionals
 
00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
they take new applicants and renewals
 
00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
some of them honest on a
 
00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
cycle and others you know on the on your
 
00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:28.400 align:start position:0%
birthday month or a year after whatever
 
00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
they it varies by board
 
00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
they hear
 
00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:35.029 align:start position:0%
they hear
complaints

00:23:35.029 --> 00:23:35.039 align:start position:0%
complaints
 
00:23:36.549 --> 00:23:36.559 align:start position:0%
and they
 
00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
decide on discipline
 
00:23:41.029 --> 00:23:41.039 align:start position:0%
for their members they also
 
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh make sure their rules are correct and
 
00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
up to date and deal with things like
 
00:23:48.149 --> 00:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
applicants that don't quite
 
00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
don't seem to quite meet the the
 
00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:51.430 align:start position:0%
don't seem to quite meet the the
requirements

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
follow-up mr chair
 
00:23:55.909 --> 00:23:55.919 align:start position:0%
my question really is
 
00:23:57.990 --> 00:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
they must have some idea of what their
 
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
operation is going to cost for that year
 
00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
correct yes
 
00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:03.190 align:start position:0%
correct yes
and

00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
does anyone else see that
 
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
in the eda or ways and means or
 
00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
it's a part of the budget
 
00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
the overall most of these administrative
 
00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
tax well the boards are now under oplc
 
00:24:19.029 --> 00:24:19.039 align:start position:0%
which means that they're in the budget
 
00:24:21.669 --> 00:24:21.679 align:start position:0%
for a plc which covers the
 
00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
secretarial staff
 
00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:26.240 align:start position:0%
a couple of investigators
 
00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:29.510 align:start position:0%
a couple of investigators
the

00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
investigators a hearing officer
 
00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
thing things like paper things like that
 
00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
yeah it's
 
00:24:40.149 --> 00:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
like as i said the
 
00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
the larger boards are steadier and the
 
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
smaller ones are more erratic
 
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
and and one thing that the oplc is
 
00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
trying to do
 
00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
is to consolidate things like
 
00:24:57.269 --> 00:24:57.279 align:start position:0%
secretarial services and license
 
00:24:57.279 --> 00:24:58.710 align:start position:0%
secretarial services and license
applications

00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
applications
 
00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
so that they that instead of having one
 
00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
person per board they have specialists
 
00:25:05.909 --> 00:25:05.919 align:start position:0%
and licenses who will deal with the
 
00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
routine ones and forward the complicated
 
00:25:09.669 --> 00:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
ones to the boards
 
00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
representative murphy actually my
 
00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:14.710 align:start position:0%
representative murphy actually my
friends

00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you uh
 
00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
representative taking my question
 
00:25:20.789 --> 00:25:20.799 align:start position:0%
i was trying to compare the um
 
00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:22.400 align:start position:0%
house version amended and then the
 
00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
senate one and
 
00:25:26.149 --> 00:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
my question is just where did the fees
 
00:25:28.789 --> 00:25:28.799 align:start position:0%
go and is it continually evolving from
 
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
the general fund into now the
 
00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:32.470 align:start position:0%
the general fund into now the
uh

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
as as of when we created the oplc it has
 
00:25:38.149 --> 00:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
a a fund for
 
00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
all of its operations
 
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:40.830 align:start position:0%
all of its operations
that

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:40.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
i'm i believe has some lapse
 
00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
requirements in the general fund but in
 
00:25:49.029 --> 00:25:49.039 align:start position:0%
general we don't want to lapse a great
 
00:25:49.039 --> 00:25:49.990 align:start position:0%
general we don't want to lapse a great
deal

00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
deal
 
00:25:52.149 --> 00:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
from the license fees which is their
 
00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
main source of income we wanted to
 
00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
make sure
 
00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:04.470 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
and just
 
00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
so does that mean with each iteration
 
00:26:09.269 --> 00:26:09.279 align:start position:0%
that you you mentioned you're trying to
 
00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
clean up each board and
 
00:26:13.269 --> 00:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
that they go into that fund versus the
 
00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:14.480 align:start position:0%
general fund that was previously
 
00:26:17.669 --> 00:26:17.679 align:start position:0%
referenced in i believe the statutory
 
00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
change that gave the oplc
 
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
the right to
 
00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
charge all fees also included their fund
 
00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:26.789 align:start position:0%
charge all fees also included their fund
and

00:26:26.789 --> 00:26:26.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
said all board fees go into this fund
 
00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:30.640 align:start position:0%
but i
 
00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
i admit i don't know for exactly sure
 
00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
what was that really
 
00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chair um
 
00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
just reviewing the um
 
00:26:44.149 --> 00:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
house modified version
 
00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
you're correct it begins with the
 
00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
setting of the fees on line 10
 
00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
acupuncture piece
 
00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
so the finding section is not included
 
00:26:55.029 --> 00:26:55.039 align:start position:0%
but it seems to me that the findings
 
00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
section sets the reasoning for
 
00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:00.400 align:start position:0%
this particular
 
00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:01.590 align:start position:0%
this particular
structure

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
structure
 
00:27:03.669 --> 00:27:03.679 align:start position:0%
so my question is would you be adverse
 
00:27:03.679 --> 00:27:04.630 align:start position:0%
so my question is would you be adverse
to

00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:04.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:27:07.269 --> 00:27:07.279 align:start position:0%
an amendment that reinserted
 
00:27:07.279 --> 00:27:08.710 align:start position:0%
an amendment that reinserted
um

00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:10.789 --> 00:27:10.799 align:start position:0%
the general no they i believe they are
 
00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
all all correct we did take all of the
 
00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:16.799 align:start position:0%
charges for the study committee and add
 
00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
them to the other study committee we did
 
00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:21.029 align:start position:0%
them to the other study committee we did
that

00:27:21.029 --> 00:27:21.039 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:27:24.149 --> 00:27:24.159 align:start position:0%
but you can't see that here
 
00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
okay yeah see we're mr chair the issue
 
00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:28.310 align:start position:0%
okay yeah see we're mr chair the issue
is

00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
we don't have access to sp 330
 
00:27:33.909 --> 00:27:33.919 align:start position:0%
which is setting up the study committee
 
00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
right and we're not on that study
 
00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
committee because of what you know well
 
00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to we're going to we're
 
00:27:40.549 --> 00:27:40.559 align:start position:0%
going to do a floor member to uh
 
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
ways and means on that yeah um but in
 
00:27:44.789 --> 00:27:44.799 align:start position:0%
that case i won't i'll take it off
 
00:27:44.799 --> 00:27:46.630 align:start position:0%
that case i won't i'll take it off
consent

00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
consent
 
00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
make it easier for you okay thanks thank
 
00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:49.750 align:start position:0%
make it easier for you okay thanks thank
you

00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
uh the the
 
00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:53.360 align:start position:0%
the other point would be that we need
 
00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
some justification as to the purpose of
 
00:27:57.990 --> 00:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
that plus the work that you and um
 
00:28:00.149 --> 00:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
you and representative almi did
 
00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
um and matter of fact the whole
 
00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
committee was involved in that uh one
 
00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
degree or another in in
 
00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
reviewing these fees we found that there
 
00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:14.149 --> 00:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
they're just all over the place well it
 
00:28:14.159 --> 00:28:14.870 align:start position:0%
they're just all over the place well it
is

00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
it is but it's also
 
00:28:19.269 --> 00:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
no two boards are created equal well
 
00:28:19.279 --> 00:28:20.149 align:start position:0%
no two boards are created equal well
yeah

00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
and that that some of them have uh
 
00:28:26.149 --> 00:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
oversight some of them have uh
 
00:28:29.669 --> 00:28:29.679 align:start position:0%
they uh ways of uh if there's wrongdoing
 
00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
by members of their board they they have
 
00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:34.240 align:start position:0%
they all have that authority they have
 
00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:35.510 align:start position:0%
they all have that authority they have
okay

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:37.350 align:start position:0%
okay
so

00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
so but again that they're all a little
 
00:28:41.269 --> 00:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
different you know
 
00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
the other thing representative hillary
 
00:28:45.269 --> 00:28:45.279 align:start position:0%
is that i know when
 
00:28:47.909 --> 00:28:47.919 align:start position:0%
we've talked with various boards there
 
00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:50.720 align:start position:0%
is a large resistance to making
 
00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
significant changes in their fees a lot
 
00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
of the the people that a lot of the
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
licensees seem to prefer to say fine
 
00:29:00.149 --> 00:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
it's 300
 
00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
every two years i know that's too much
 
00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
but i'd rather not have it go down to
 
00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
250 and then back up to 350.
 
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.669 align:start position:0%
250 and then back up to 350.
so

00:29:11.669 --> 00:29:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
i understand that and then i think
 
00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
everybody on on
 
00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
this committee understands that as well
 
00:29:20.549 --> 00:29:20.559 align:start position:0%
the uh issue is however when you uh
 
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
relegate setting fees to an
 
00:29:24.549 --> 00:29:24.559 align:start position:0%
administrative body
 
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
administrative bodies have a tendency to
 
00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:27.909 align:start position:0%
administrative bodies have a tendency to
grow

00:29:27.909 --> 00:29:27.919 align:start position:0%
grow
 
00:29:27.919 --> 00:29:30.710 align:start position:0%
grow
no

00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
i'm shocked that you say that
 
00:29:35.269 --> 00:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
and you're winning to here's your
 
00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
winnings yes that's a very good seat
 
00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
in casablanca but um
 
00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.149 align:start position:0%
in casablanca but um
so

00:29:42.149 --> 00:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:29:43.909 --> 00:29:43.919 align:start position:0%
getting it back into
 
00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
a more difficult
 
00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:52.789 --> 00:29:52.799 align:start position:0%
is not
 
00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
in any way shape or form good
 
00:29:57.190 --> 00:29:57.200 align:start position:0%
governments but setting up a centralized
 
00:30:00.549 --> 00:30:00.559 align:start position:0%
licensing bureau as opposed to 50
 
00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
different or 150 different
 
00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
boards for each one
 
00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
makes a great deal of sense we we just
 
00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
need to be very careful on that sir
 
00:30:13.909 --> 00:30:13.919 align:start position:0%
i don't object to you to the idea that
 
00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
ways and means should be setting its
 
00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:16.870 align:start position:0%
ways and means should be setting its
fees

00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
fees
 
00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
or as part you know but
 
00:30:21.029 --> 00:30:21.039 align:start position:0%
at the moment that's not what the law
 
00:30:21.039 --> 00:30:22.789 align:start position:0%
at the moment that's not what the law
says

00:30:22.789 --> 00:30:22.799 align:start position:0%
says
 
00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
all right so so back to the back to this
 
00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:26.310 align:start position:0%
all right so so back to the back to this
uh

00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:27.190 align:start position:0%
uh
study

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:27.200 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
uh joint study committee with the senate
 
00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:31.269 align:start position:0%
uh joint study committee with the senate
uh

00:30:31.269 --> 00:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:30:34.389 --> 00:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
i i it seems like it's
 
00:30:36.789 --> 00:30:36.799 align:start position:0%
what the goal there is to give some
 
00:30:36.799 --> 00:30:38.149 align:start position:0%
what the goal there is to give some
parameters

00:30:38.149 --> 00:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
parameters
 
00:30:39.669 --> 00:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
for which the
 
00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
office of professional licensure and
 
00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:43.350 align:start position:0%
office of professional licensure and
certification

00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
certification
 
00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:44.310 align:start position:0%
certification
should

00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
should
 
00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
do its fee setting by some guidance
 
00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:48.230 align:start position:0%
do its fee setting by some guidance
correct

00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
is that part of this yes we want to see
 
00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
how they're looking at how they allocate
 
00:30:55.029 --> 00:30:55.039 align:start position:0%
fees between boards because some
 
00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
obviously some costs are going to be
 
00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:57.750 align:start position:0%
obviously some costs are going to be
allocated

00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
allocated
 
00:30:58.870 --> 00:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:31:00.789 --> 00:31:00.799 align:start position:0%
um i had recommended
 
00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
two seats but then i i uh offer ways of
 
00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:05.039 align:start position:0%
means to be on there because that's kind
 
00:31:06.549 --> 00:31:06.559 align:start position:0%
of what we do we look at those kind of
 
00:31:06.559 --> 00:31:07.430 align:start position:0%
of what we do we look at those kind of
things

00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
and i thought it very appropriate and
 
00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
representative romney and i discussed
 
00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
that and
 
00:31:13.669 --> 00:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
we'd like to have one republican one
 
00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
democrat on it that's i have no
 
00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
objection to that
 
00:31:19.509 --> 00:31:19.519 align:start position:0%
but as i said we just kind of ran out of
 
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
time last night
 
00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
but i i saw when i i i i increased your
 
00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
numbers to two as well i took the
 
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.269 align:start position:0%
numbers to two as well i took the
liberty

00:31:27.269 --> 00:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
liberty
 
00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representatives to make it
 
00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
proportional to
 
00:31:33.029 --> 00:31:33.039 align:start position:0%
your committee and and our committee
 
00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:34.310 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:35.750 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
[Laughter]

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:31:40.549 --> 00:31:40.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:42.389 --> 00:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
i could keep it at one
 
00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
thank you no that's fine you ha you have
 
00:31:48.149 --> 00:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
that if you're expanding the size of the
 
00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
committee then
 
00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
i don't have too much of an objection
 
00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
but we'll see
 
00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
00:31:59.110 --> 00:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
well i want you to agree because i on
 
00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
the floor i don't want i don't want you
 
00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
getting up i'm certainly not going to
 
00:32:04.549 --> 00:32:04.559 align:start position:0%
fight you on the floor that's for sure
 
00:32:04.559 --> 00:32:05.350 align:start position:0%
fight you on the floor that's for sure
okay

00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:32:14.549 --> 00:32:14.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
okay i just wanted to respond to uh
 
00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:19.029 align:start position:0%
okay i just wanted to respond to uh
the

00:32:19.029 --> 00:32:19.039 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
concern expressed by representative ur
 
00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
about the uh find the what are they
 
00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
called findings
 
00:32:27.269 --> 00:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
uh section
 
00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
i think what you've done
 
00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
as i understand it is to remove the
 
00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:32.789 align:start position:0%
as i understand it is to remove the
findings

00:32:32.789 --> 00:32:32.799 align:start position:0%
findings
 
00:32:33.909 --> 00:32:33.919 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:32:33.919 --> 00:32:35.110 align:start position:0%
and the
committee

00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
and that makes sense to me because i
 
00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
think the findings were the predicate
 
00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
study committee um and with the removal
 
00:32:45.909 --> 00:32:45.919 align:start position:0%
of those two sections what we're left is
 
00:32:45.919 --> 00:32:46.789 align:start position:0%
of those two sections what we're left is
with

00:32:46.789 --> 00:32:46.799 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
what i would call a cleanup bill uh
 
00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
a fix-it kind of thing
 
00:32:53.669 --> 00:32:53.679 align:start position:0%
which uh
 
00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
representative amy
 
00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.509 align:start position:0%
representative amy
has

00:32:57.509 --> 00:32:57.519 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
found one more fix that needs to be
 
00:33:03.269 --> 00:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
added to that and that's good um
 
00:33:05.269 --> 00:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
but i don't think representative ulri
 
00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
that we need the findings because
 
00:33:09.669 --> 00:33:09.679 align:start position:0%
they're not really
 
00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
a part of what we've ended up with here
 
00:33:15.029 --> 00:33:15.039 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a simpler bill and uh for
 
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
the findings and all the discussion that
 
00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
goes into
 
00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:20.950 align:start position:0%
goes into
that

00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
we've got a separate bill that's coming
 
00:33:25.029 --> 00:33:25.039 align:start position:0%
to the floor of the house
 
00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
that we'll be dealing with uh in terms
 
00:33:30.149 --> 00:33:30.159 align:start position:0%
of membership of committee
 
00:33:30.159 --> 00:33:31.350 align:start position:0%
of membership of committee
uh

00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:33:34.549 --> 00:33:34.559 align:start position:0%
when it comes so i i think
 
00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:36.640 align:start position:0%
this is a simple bill we've got here and
 
00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:38.389 align:start position:0%
this is a simple bill we've got here and
uh

00:33:38.389 --> 00:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:33:40.789 --> 00:33:40.799 align:start position:0%
we've got an add-on we haven't talked
 
00:33:43.509 --> 00:33:43.519 align:start position:0%
about but uh
 
00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
it seems uncontroversial so
 
00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
that's the way i see it
 
00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative ames i agree
 
00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:53.200 align:start position:0%
with you as as amanda it's simply
 
00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
cleanup of the statutory language that
 
00:33:57.430 --> 00:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
conflicts with other statutory languages
 
00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:59.029 align:start position:0%
conflicts with other statutory languages
right

00:33:59.029 --> 00:33:59.039 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
given that
 
00:34:01.909 --> 00:34:01.919 align:start position:0%
over the last year or so there have been
 
00:34:01.919 --> 00:34:03.029 align:start position:0%
over the last year or so there have been
changes

00:34:03.029 --> 00:34:03.039 align:start position:0%
changes
 
00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
we kind of really weren't that aware of
 
00:34:08.069 --> 00:34:08.079 align:start position:0%
that so basically
 
00:34:09.669 --> 00:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
yes the cleanup would be needed to
 
00:34:11.109 --> 00:34:11.119 align:start position:0%
comply with
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
the new statutes we'd have to clean this
 
00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:14.389 align:start position:0%
the new statutes we'd have to clean this
up

00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:34:14.399 --> 00:34:15.349 align:start position:0%
up
and

00:34:15.349 --> 00:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
so basically that's what we're going to
 
00:34:18.149 --> 00:34:18.159 align:start position:0%
be doing
 
00:34:19.669 --> 00:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
but on the other hand we want to make
 
00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
sure we're representing on that
 
00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:22.470 align:start position:0%
sure we're representing on that
committee

00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:23.270 align:start position:0%
committee
to

00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh at least be at the table when this
 
00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
this issue is being discussed
 
00:34:30.149 --> 00:34:30.159 align:start position:0%
about putting some guardrails around
 
00:34:31.990 --> 00:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
how how the fees will be set in the
 
00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:34.399 align:start position:0%
future by the
 
00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
office of professional licensure and
 
00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.349 align:start position:0%
office of professional licensure and
certification

00:34:37.349 --> 00:34:37.359 align:start position:0%
certification
 
00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
that's helped that will be very much
 
00:34:41.349 --> 00:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
appreciated okay
 
00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:43.919 align:start position:0%

just one one comment uh
 
00:34:52.629 --> 00:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
i'm i've been on for quite a while a
 
00:34:52.639 --> 00:34:53.990 align:start position:0%
i'm i've been on for quite a while a
four-person

00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
four-person
 
00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
study committee long-term study
 
00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
committee and uh
 
00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
it's an awful number a what awful number
 
00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
oh you need three for a quorum so if two
 
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
people can't be there that day you can't
 
00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:09.990 align:start position:0%
people can't be there that day you can't
meet

00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.390 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for that information we'll uh
 
00:35:17.589 --> 00:35:17.599 align:start position:0%
in that case this floor amendment will
 
00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:21.589 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:35:21.589 --> 00:35:21.599 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:35:23.349 --> 00:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
any other questions of representative
 
00:35:23.359 --> 00:35:25.109 align:start position:0%
any other questions of representative
mcguire

00:35:25.109 --> 00:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
mcguire
 
00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you very much for
 
00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
your attentiveness and
 
00:35:33.829 --> 00:35:33.839 align:start position:0%
insights into what happened here okay
 
00:35:33.839 --> 00:35:34.870 align:start position:0%
insights into what happened here okay
so

00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
yes it turns out that they were more
 
00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
efficient than i was
 
00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:45.910 align:start position:0%
efficient than i was
oh

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:36:11.349 --> 00:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
i think what we would like to do is to
 
00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:14.950 align:start position:0%
i think what we would like to do is to
um

00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:15.910 align:start position:0%
um
to

00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
exec this bill now before we go move on
 
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
to the next bill
 
00:36:23.109 --> 00:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:25.589 --> 00:36:25.599 align:start position:0%
oh by the way i um
 
00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
i forgot we do have one replacement
 
00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:28.630 align:start position:0%
i forgot we do have one replacement
that's

00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:28.640 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:30.230 align:start position:0%
that's
representative

00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:36:32.069 --> 00:36:32.079 align:start position:0%
to check
 
00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
so okay why don't we do it this way why
 
00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
don't we why don't we just have a
 
00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:52.630 align:start position:0%
don't we why don't we just have a
discussion

00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:52.640 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
technically it is a work session not a
 
00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:55.910 align:start position:0%
technically it is a work session not a
hearing

00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:36:57.589 --> 00:36:57.599 align:start position:0%
uh that's the way the clerk wanted us to
 
00:36:59.750 --> 00:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
set this up uh given the short notice of
 
00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:00.870 align:start position:0%
set this up uh given the short notice of
everything

00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
everything
 
00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh the clerk paul smith
 
00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:04.710 align:start position:0%
uh the clerk paul smith
so

00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:04.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:05.750 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
let's when we start with the amendment
 
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
susan and just explain what what this
 
00:37:11.349 --> 00:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
does and then
 
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
i was freaked out a little by this
 
00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
because my version went through every
 
00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:21.599 align:start position:0%
single one of
 
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
the boards that
 
00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
just by doing a search for fee
 
00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
on the areas that they'd been working in
 
00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:30.950 align:start position:0%
on the areas that they'd been working in
uh

00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:32.310 align:start position:0%
uh
got

00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
got
 
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
on didn't get changed the way they got
 
00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
changed elsewhere
 
00:37:39.589 --> 00:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
so all of that that this
 
00:37:39.599 --> 00:37:40.870 align:start position:0%
so all of that that this
does

00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
and carol's looked at it now uh
 
00:37:46.310 --> 00:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
represented maguire uh
 
00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:47.670 align:start position:0%
represented maguire uh
is

00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
on for
 
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
system evaluators which they did touch
 
00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:53.349 align:start position:0%
system evaluators which they did touch
but

00:37:53.349 --> 00:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
they forgot to remove the late fees from
 
00:37:59.750 --> 00:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
permission to be set
 
00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
that's the first
 
00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
section in here 31
 
00:38:07.829 --> 00:38:07.839 align:start position:0%
and then 32 is a combination of the
 
00:38:10.069 --> 00:38:10.079 align:start position:0%
engineers architects geologists
 
00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
landscape architects and home inspectors
 
00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
all of whom
 
00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
had their fees removed elsewhere but not
 
00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
so it
 
00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
it changes estab registration fees
 
00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
established by the board to
 
00:38:33.109 --> 00:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
registration fee established by the
 
00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
office of professional licensure and
 
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
certification which is the executive
 
00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
director in the case of
 
00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
the office
 
00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:43.030 align:start position:0%
the office
and

00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:44.390 align:start position:0%
and
on

00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
she's terrific but she she's been there
 
00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
i think two years
 
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
well she's been there three years she
 
00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
was hiding in the office figuring out
 
00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
what was wrong with it for a year and
 
00:38:57.589 --> 00:38:57.599 align:start position:0%
then she was promoted to take it over
 
00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
and she really is terrific but
 
00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
apparently um there's a certain amount
 
00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
of adjustment going on as they change
 
00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
this into a more efficient organization
 
00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:11.190 align:start position:0%
this into a more efficient organization
the

00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:11.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
the opposite of efficient unfortunately
 
00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
is new hampshire tradition which i value
 
00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:23.200 align:start position:0%
the professions to
 
00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
set up their own boards on their own
 
00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:28.790 align:start position:0%
set up their own boards on their own
terms

00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
and oversee their own members con
 
00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:33.270 align:start position:0%
and oversee their own members con
conduct

00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
conduct
 
00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:34.069 align:start position:0%
conduct
so

00:39:34.069 --> 00:39:34.079 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
it's a balancing act that
 
00:39:39.109 --> 00:39:39.119 align:start position:0%
always requires a little bit of pain on
 
00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
both sides
 
00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
but this is all this amendment does it
 
00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
adds it on to
 
00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:51.990 align:start position:0%
 
which

00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:39:55.349 --> 00:39:55.359 align:start position:0%
is taking out references that they had
 
00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
not noticed last year when they took out
 
00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of the references and we didn't
 
00:40:03.349 --> 00:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
see that bill at all
 
00:40:03.359 --> 00:40:04.950 align:start position:0%
see that bill at all
so

00:40:04.950 --> 00:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:06.640 align:start position:0%
i want to thank you representative army
 
00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
for uh the homework he did
 
00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
in scrubbing this and finding those
 
00:40:13.349 --> 00:40:13.359 align:start position:0%
other references that should have been
 
00:40:15.349 --> 00:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
taken out represented southwest yes
 
00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
thank you i think this is a great
 
00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
amendment it clarifies and simplifies
 
00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
win-win basically
 
00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:24.640 align:start position:0%
that was drafting would you like it to
 
00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
be moved
 
00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
uh this one any other discussion
 
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
okay why don't we go through the uh
 
00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
process we we usually do the motion on
 
00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
the bill and then first and then then we
 
00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
have the motion on the
 
00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
i'd like representative almighty to make
 
00:40:40.309 --> 00:40:40.319 align:start position:0%
the motion on if you don't mind because
 
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
we have to get these blurbs written
 
00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:46.720 align:start position:0%
so we're going to go into executive
 
00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:48.790 align:start position:0%
so we're going to go into executive
session

00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:48.800 align:start position:0%

for um administrative purposes uh

00:44:57.520 --> 00:44:58.870 align:start position:0%
uh
we've

00:44:58.870 --> 00:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
we've
 
00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:00.069 align:start position:0%
we've
um

00:45:00.069 --> 00:45:00.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
i'm recommending that two of us be on
 
00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:03.270 align:start position:0%
i'm recommending that two of us be on
this

00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
on 33 30 does everybody agree with that
 
00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
i'd like to see one republican one
 
00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:09.589 align:start position:0%
i'd like to see one republican one
democrat

00:45:09.589 --> 00:45:09.599 align:start position:0%
democrat
 
00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
and then uh
 
00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:12.880 align:start position:0%
i i increased their number to two i mean
 
00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
i i don't think we should have two and
 
00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
they they not have two
 
00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
uh and then have one one
 
00:45:21.349 --> 00:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
have a fifth that would be
 
00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
picked by the
 
00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
okay so we will leave it at that we
 
00:45:28.309 --> 00:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
could do two two ways it means two edna
 
00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
and one health and human services
 
00:45:36.069 --> 00:45:36.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:38.240 align:start position:0%
no i won't but when we when they ask
 
00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
because they always ask us who do we
 
00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
want we'll we'll say that
 
00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
so represent really
 
00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:45.750 align:start position:0%
so represent really
just

00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
for consideration purposes i understand
 
00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:50.309 align:start position:0%
for consideration purposes i understand
um

00:45:50.309 --> 00:45:50.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
and appreciate who most likely would be
 
00:45:55.270 --> 00:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
assigned to that but uh
 
00:45:57.829 --> 00:45:57.839 align:start position:0%
frankly edna does has a great deal of
 
00:45:59.670 --> 00:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
knowledge about this and it's going to
 
00:46:03.349 --> 00:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
take some splaining to do to quote
 
00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
the great ricky ricardo
 
00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:07.510 align:start position:0%
the great ricky ricardo
um

00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
it would also seem to me that if they
 
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
had more people from edna and more
 
00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
people from ways and means to
 
00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
raise it up to seven it would be easier
 
00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
to have a quorum present number one and
 
00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
number two it would be
 
00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:23.670 align:start position:0%
number two it would be
the

00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
base of discussion would be spread out
 
00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:27.839 align:start position:0%
over a larger number of group people so
 
00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
that small
 
00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:30.470 align:start position:0%
that small
gatherings

00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
gatherings
 
00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
could be explained as to why we're doing
 
00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
this or the the justification for that
 
00:46:37.829 --> 00:46:37.839 align:start position:0%
uh it just seems
 
00:46:39.349 --> 00:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
to me that if you're going to have that
 
00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:42.640 align:start position:0%
kind of a steady commission that that
 
00:46:45.910 --> 00:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:48.069 --> 00:46:48.079 align:start position:0%
a more better way to do it because you
 
00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
would be able to
 
00:46:51.349 --> 00:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
spread out the knowledge
 
00:46:53.109 --> 00:46:53.119 align:start position:0%
rather than keep it compact with a
 
00:46:55.109 --> 00:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
smaller group i
 
00:46:56.950 --> 00:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
i i understand what you're saying but i
 
00:46:58.470 --> 00:46:58.480 align:start position:0%
i'd have to check with her i don't i
 
00:47:01.349 --> 00:47:01.359 align:start position:0%
don't want any i want to be
 
00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
in agreement with the dna
 
00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:06.640 align:start position:0%
she didn't seem like she wanted to add
 
00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:09.280 align:start position:0%
even one more of her own people so
 
00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
uh i don't want to go there i think five
 
00:47:13.349 --> 00:47:13.359 align:start position:0%
would be a good number
 
00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
to work with
 
00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:20.309 align:start position:0%
to work with
huh

00:47:20.309 --> 00:47:20.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:34.470 --> 00:47:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:36.549 --> 00:47:36.559 align:start position:0%
no we could do an outlaw mr remember the
 
00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
well like with the exception of a couple
 
00:47:51.589 --> 00:47:51.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:53.109 --> 00:47:53.119 align:start position:0%
let's but to i just want to look at
 
00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
something i don't know
 
00:47:58.870 --> 00:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
this committee report uh is
 
00:48:01.349 --> 00:48:01.359 align:start position:0%
an interim report due at the end of this
 
00:48:04.549 --> 00:48:04.559 align:start position:0%
year but a final report next year so it
 
00:48:07.670 --> 00:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
goes across elections
 
00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
which is better because this is a really
 
00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
and what happens if
 
00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
people just get reappointed
 
00:48:20.549 --> 00:48:20.559 align:start position:0%
i've been on those that have gone across
 
00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
election years
 
00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
you if you're still here you could you
 
00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
get reappointed generally
 
00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
if not they pick some new people
 
00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
all right i think we got an agreement on
 
00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
this all right um um let's open hearing
 
00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
on and um keane's here we're gonna have
 
00:48:39.829 --> 00:48:39.839 align:start position:0%
after we get done with uh
 
00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
with three uh senate bill 379
 
00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
uh we're going to talk about i forget
 
00:48:46.829 --> 00:48:46.839 align:start position:0%
the bill number now
 
00:48:46.839 --> 00:48:48.710 align:start position:0%
the bill number now
um

00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:50.720 align:start position:0%
yeah and we're gonna just have a little
 
00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
discussion on what the uh the amendment
 
00:48:54.790 --> 00:48:54.800 align:start position:0%
that they did to the bill
 
00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:55.910 align:start position:0%
that they did to the bill
uh

00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:49:00.630 --> 00:49:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
all right i'm going to open the um well
 
00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
first off
 
00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:06.160 align:start position:0%
it's a work session is anybody here to
 
00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
testify on
 
00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
on um
 
00:49:15.430 --> 00:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:17.270 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:20.640 align:start position:0%
i i spent most of the hour i was driving
 
00:49:24.069 --> 00:49:24.079 align:start position:0%
down here talking with karen ebel
 
00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:26.240 align:start position:0%
who on
 
00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
is the head of the solid waste
 
00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
committee whatever it's called
 
00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:34.870 align:start position:0%
committee whatever it's called
and

00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:35.990 align:start position:0%
and
on

00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:49:39.349 --> 00:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
senator waters is in
 
00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
committees frantically trying to deal
 
00:49:43.589 --> 00:49:43.599 align:start position:0%
with our bills right now
 
00:49:43.599 --> 00:49:44.390 align:start position:0%
with our bills right now
and

00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:49:46.390 --> 00:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
wasn't planning on coming over because
 
00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
neither of them understood what a work
 
00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
session is
 
00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
i explained it's what finance does but
 
00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
i've tried to tell finance nobody
 
00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
understands what a work session is and
 
00:49:59.430 --> 00:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
they just don't get it
 
00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:00.710 align:start position:0%
they just don't get it
so

00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
on they none of them
 
00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
she's not
 
00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
really available either but i think she
 
00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
something that i was asking to be passed
 
00:50:17.109 --> 00:50:17.119 align:start position:0%
out that
 
00:50:17.119 --> 00:50:17.910 align:start position:0%
out that
um

00:50:17.910 --> 00:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:19.510 align:start position:0%
um
but

00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
to the effect of well
 
00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
several things um
 
00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
one of them is that
 
00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
the repeal on the existing surcharge of
 
00:50:33.349 --> 00:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
out-of-state waste is against the
 
00:50:35.589 --> 00:50:35.599 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce clause which i think
 
00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of us understood
 
00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
and it's been it was enacted long ago
 
00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
and has been sitting there in the
 
00:50:44.549 --> 00:50:44.559 align:start position:0%
background and they decided while they
 
00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:46.720 align:start position:0%
were doing this they'd get rid of it
 
00:50:48.790 --> 00:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
because the attorney general tells them
 
00:50:51.109 --> 00:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
there's no way we can enforce it
 
00:50:51.119 --> 00:50:52.069 align:start position:0%
there's no way we can enforce it
um

00:50:52.069 --> 00:50:52.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:50:57.030 --> 00:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
a surcharge for only
 
00:51:00.790 --> 00:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:02.790 --> 00:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
vermont seems to have found a way to do
 
00:51:04.549 --> 00:51:04.559 align:start position:0%
that actually but
 
00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
but again for the committee that's not
 
00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
that's not that's not in our domain
 
00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
right it came to us because of this fund
 
00:51:13.829 --> 00:51:13.839 align:start position:0%
but but it is uh the surcharge would
 
00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
have been in
 
00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:16.240 align:start position:0%
our domain
 
00:51:19.510 --> 00:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
so that's the easy part of that uh the
 
00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
solid waste management fund
 
00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
they used to have a planning department
 
00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:28.720 align:start position:0%
back when we had more money
 
00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
they used to have a planning department
 
00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:33.190 align:start position:0%
they used to have a planning department
in

00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:36.630 --> 00:51:36.640 align:start position:0%
des for solid waste it
 
00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:37.670 align:start position:0%
des for solid waste it
was

00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:39.510 align:start position:0%
was
defunded

00:51:39.510 --> 00:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
defunded
 
00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:41.200 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:42.230 align:start position:0%
years ago
and

00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:51:45.190 --> 00:51:45.200 align:start position:0%
now we're in solid waste crisis in the
 
00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
state um
 
00:51:50.069 --> 00:51:50.079 align:start position:0%
a number of people have brought forward
 
00:51:52.230 --> 00:51:52.240 align:start position:0%
the idea that we ought to be
 
00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:53.589 align:start position:0%
the idea that we ought to be
um

00:51:53.589 --> 00:51:53.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
doing that again and they have managed
 
00:51:58.390 --> 00:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
apparently to start
 
00:51:59.910 --> 00:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
that but
 
00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:00.950 align:start position:0%
that but
uh

00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:02.150 align:start position:0%
uh
this

00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
fund was
 
00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
recommended by the solid waste group
 
00:52:10.470 --> 00:52:10.480 align:start position:0%
and was the origin of this bill which
 
00:52:13.109 --> 00:52:13.119 align:start position:0%
they amended first in the senate
 
00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
to say
 
00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:17.430 align:start position:0%
to say
that

00:52:17.430 --> 00:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
originally it just said that on this is
 
00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
being re-established as i understand it
 
00:52:26.309 --> 00:52:26.319 align:start position:0%
uh then they amended it to say oh
 
00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
there's a 500 000 appropriation
 
00:52:31.510 --> 00:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
got to finance in the senate and the
 
00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
senate and finance took that out
 
00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
because they were told by
 
00:52:42.309 --> 00:52:42.319 align:start position:0%
on des that there are specific funds
 
00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
coming from the federal government
 
00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
i guess from the infrastructure
 
00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
fund bill
 
00:52:51.190 --> 00:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
on that they can apply for that will
 
00:52:54.309 --> 00:52:54.319 align:start position:0%
allow them to fund this program
 
00:52:54.319 --> 00:52:55.430 align:start position:0%
allow them to fund this program
uh

00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:52:59.030 --> 00:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
at least for i don't know how many years
 
00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:00.790 align:start position:0%
at least for i don't know how many years
but

00:53:00.790 --> 00:53:00.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:01.910 align:start position:0%
but
on

00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
and the program itself
 
00:53:10.069 --> 00:53:10.079 align:start position:0%
is used principally to make grants to
 
00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire municipalities that are
 
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
struggling with this
 
00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:16.230 align:start position:0%
struggling with this
problem

00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:16.240 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
that i think is about all that was in
 
00:53:22.710 --> 00:53:22.720 align:start position:0%
that email which i don't know if we've
 
00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
if i may that's exactly what i was going
 
00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
to say there is an email here from
 
00:53:30.790 --> 00:53:30.800 align:start position:0%

yes um reading this bill i don't see
 
00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
where they make any reports about how
 
00:53:55.910 --> 00:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
much money is received how much and what
 
00:53:57.910 --> 00:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
is done with it they just receive it and
 
00:53:59.109 --> 00:53:59.119 align:start position:0%
they spend it
 
00:53:59.119 --> 00:54:00.390 align:start position:0%
they spend it
but

00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:54:02.309 --> 00:54:02.319 align:start position:0%
it's up to them to receive it and spend
 
00:54:02.319 --> 00:54:04.790 align:start position:0%
it's up to them to receive it and spend
it

00:54:04.790 --> 00:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
but they don't tell anybody what they're
 
00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
receiving and what they're spending well
 
00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
to apply for it receive it go to fiscal
 
00:54:15.670 --> 00:54:15.680 align:start position:0%
to get it approved uh and it doesn't say
 
00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:22.230 align:start position:0%
to get it approved uh and it doesn't say
that

00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:26.150 --> 00:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
i believe that you will always have okay
 
00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:28.240 align:start position:0%
you you're satisfied then
 
00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:30.069 align:start position:0%
you you're satisfied then
true

00:54:30.069 --> 00:54:30.079 align:start position:0%
true
 
00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
we i think
 
00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
we should know what's coming in for the
 
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
budget purposes
 
00:54:42.069 --> 00:54:42.079 align:start position:0%
finance should understand
 
00:54:43.829 --> 00:54:43.839 align:start position:0%
how they're spending
 
00:54:43.839 --> 00:54:44.870 align:start position:0%
how they're spending
money

00:54:44.870 --> 00:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
and then there just needs to be some
 
00:54:48.150 --> 00:54:48.160 align:start position:0%
sort of check and balance to make sure
 
00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:49.990 align:start position:0%
sort of check and balance to make sure
that

00:54:49.990 --> 00:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:54:51.349 --> 00:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
they're receiving money and spending
 
00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
money and nobody's building a pool in
 
00:54:56.549 --> 00:54:56.559 align:start position:0%
their backyard
 
00:55:01.829 --> 00:55:01.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
we need to look at 149 m29
 
00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:06.870 align:start position:0%
we need to look at 149 m29
ii

00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
ii
 
00:55:07.990 --> 00:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
to see
 
00:55:15.109 --> 00:55:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:17.829 --> 00:55:17.839 align:start position:0%
and is that basically rule making
 
00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:27.589 --> 00:55:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:27.599 --> 00:55:28.630 align:start position:0%

00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:34.390 align:start position:0%
 
nope

00:55:34.390 --> 00:55:34.400 align:start position:0%

management and can contribute
sorry

00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:44.549 --> 00:55:44.559 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:55:46.549 --> 00:55:46.559 align:start position:0%
i mean the way i read this
 
00:55:47.750 --> 00:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
we're just gonna we're creating a fund
 
00:55:51.430 --> 00:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
there's no state money going into the
 
00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
fund it's it's there to accept federal
 
00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:55.190 align:start position:0%
fund it's it's there to accept federal
money

00:55:55.190 --> 00:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:55:56.150 --> 00:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
so i
 
00:55:58.470 --> 00:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
i just said yeah nothing this is no big
 
00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
deal but uh but
 
00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
and final reading
 
00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:04.470 align:start position:0%
and final reading
uh

00:56:04.470 --> 00:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:05.510 align:start position:0%
uh
do

00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
does everybody
 
00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
who else shares representatives concern
 
00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:13.829 align:start position:0%
who else shares representatives concern
that

00:56:13.829 --> 00:56:13.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:17.190 --> 00:56:17.200 align:start position:0%
we discovered this there is a report
 
00:56:18.789 --> 00:56:18.799 align:start position:0%
but who does none of the question on the
 
00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:29.670 --> 00:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
the department and that the department
 
00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:30.640 align:start position:0%
in this case the department of
 
00:56:31.829 --> 00:56:31.839 align:start position:0%
environmental service i think they
 
00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:50.720 align:start position:0%
well yeah well no we're giving them the
 
00:56:52.549 --> 00:56:52.559 align:start position:0%
authority to do that
 
00:56:54.549 --> 00:56:54.559 align:start position:0%
now we have we have many funds that we
 
00:56:56.230 --> 00:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
don't we don't vote on every dollar that
 
00:57:10.789 --> 00:57:10.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:13.990 --> 00:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
excuse me under our system
 
00:57:18.870 --> 00:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:20.950 --> 00:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
i had the honor of subbing on it for the
 
00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
first time last a couple of weeks two
 
00:57:24.630 --> 00:57:24.640 align:start position:0%
weeks ago
 
00:57:27.990 --> 00:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
it really
 
00:57:31.510 --> 00:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
you can understand a lot better if you
 
00:57:35.030 --> 00:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
sit there through pre-fiscal and then
 
00:57:38.870 --> 00:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
then there they do look at these things
 
00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:39.750 align:start position:0%
then there they do look at these things
on

00:57:39.750 --> 00:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
and they ask questions it's not as good
 
00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
as if it went through the legislative
 
00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:45.510 align:start position:0%
as if it went through the legislative
process

00:57:45.510 --> 00:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:57:47.190 --> 00:57:47.200 align:start position:0%
but if everything went through the
 
00:57:49.910 --> 00:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
legislative process i don't know
 
00:57:51.270 --> 00:57:51.280 align:start position:0%
right if
 
00:57:54.150 --> 00:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
we'd have anybody willing to fight can
 
00:57:55.270 --> 00:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
someone uh
 
00:57:57.589 --> 00:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
if you if you look at line 19 on page
 
00:57:57.599 --> 00:57:58.789 align:start position:0%
if you if you look at line 19 on page
two

00:57:58.789 --> 00:57:58.799 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:58:00.789 --> 00:58:00.799 align:start position:0%
the activities and finances of solid
 
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
waste manager fund as required by rsa
 
00:58:07.430 --> 00:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
149 are cohen six
 
00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
there's no rsa 149 created in there
 
00:58:17.430 --> 00:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
in the bill
 
00:58:20.069 --> 00:58:20.079 align:start position:0%
but line 17
 
00:58:22.630 --> 00:58:22.640 align:start position:0%
should say where the biennial report
 
00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:23.670 align:start position:0%
should say where the biennial report
goes

00:58:23.670 --> 00:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
goes
 
00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:28.630 align:start position:0%
goes
so

00:58:28.630 --> 00:58:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:31.349 --> 00:58:31.359 align:start position:0%
149 am 29
 
00:58:41.670 --> 00:58:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
is we're creating a line item that for
 
00:58:45.990 --> 00:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
now will be blank to be determined
 
00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
depending on federal funds or whatever
 
00:58:49.990 --> 00:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
so we have that piece and then what
 
00:58:52.390 --> 00:58:52.400 align:start position:0%
representative uhler is saying is once
 
00:58:53.910 --> 00:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
we have that piece we want
 
00:58:55.990 --> 00:58:56.000 align:start position:0%
accountability for the number right and
 
00:58:58.230 --> 00:58:58.240 align:start position:0%
i think we will agree to that
 
00:58:58.240 --> 00:58:59.430 align:start position:0%
i think we will agree to that
um

00:58:59.430 --> 00:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:00.870 align:start position:0%
um
representative

00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:00.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:02.230 align:start position:0%
representative
yeah

00:59:02.230 --> 00:59:02.240 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:59:06.309 --> 00:59:06.319 align:start position:0%
i was just going to say i have 149
 
00:59:09.430 --> 00:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
hyphen m colon 29
 
00:59:11.829 --> 00:59:11.839 align:start position:0%
in front of me and it it does not say to
 
00:59:13.670 --> 00:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
whom the report goes
 
00:59:16.630 --> 00:59:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:18.390 --> 00:59:18.400 align:start position:0%
i was going to look for
 
00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
prior reports to see where they go but
 
00:59:22.630 --> 00:59:22.640 align:start position:0%
they're public reports and
 
00:59:25.349 --> 00:59:25.359 align:start position:0%
certainly available um
 
00:59:26.950 --> 00:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:59:28.789 --> 00:59:28.799 align:start position:0%
i really go back to what representative
 
00:59:30.710 --> 00:59:30.720 align:start position:0%
abrami said i think that
 
00:59:32.710 --> 00:59:32.720 align:start position:0%
this is a straightforward bill it
 
00:59:34.630 --> 00:59:34.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't involve an appropriation of
 
00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:36.309 align:start position:0%
doesn't involve an appropriation of
money

00:59:36.309 --> 00:59:36.319 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:59:38.309 --> 00:59:38.319 align:start position:0%
it sets up a
 
00:59:41.349 --> 00:59:41.359 align:start position:0%
a fund which apparently is needed for
 
00:59:44.230 --> 00:59:44.240 align:start position:0%
the receipt and allocation of spending
 
00:59:46.150 --> 00:59:46.160 align:start position:0%
of federal funding funds that are
 
00:59:49.589 --> 00:59:49.599 align:start position:0%
available we all know solid fund
 
00:59:51.270 --> 00:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
i mean solid waste
 
00:59:53.430 --> 00:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
management is a big
 
00:59:57.510 --> 00:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
problem these days and uh so i i
 
00:59:59.349 --> 00:59:59.359 align:start position:0%
the policymakers
 
01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:00.640 align:start position:0%
involved in this
 
01:00:02.309 --> 01:00:02.319 align:start position:0%
say we need it and i think we should
 
01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
yeah and this kid this came out of uh
 
01:00:10.069 --> 01:00:10.079 align:start position:0%
environmental and agriculture 17 to
 
01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
nothing as well
 
01:00:13.589 --> 01:00:13.599 align:start position:0%
um another 17-nothing vote it was on a
 
01:00:15.670 --> 01:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
consent calendar
 
01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:18.470 align:start position:0%
consent calendar
um

01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:21.109 --> 01:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
i mean who who would you suggest
 
01:00:21.119 --> 01:00:22.789 align:start position:0%
i mean who who would you suggest
representati

01:00:22.789 --> 01:00:22.799 align:start position:0%
representati
 
01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
i think as representative ames says is
 
01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
that it's it is public it isn't like
 
01:00:55.349 --> 01:00:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:57.030 --> 01:00:57.040 align:start position:0%
reporting for themselves about whether
 
01:00:59.270 --> 01:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
or not the rules that they wrote
 
01:01:01.589 --> 01:01:01.599 align:start position:0%
the rules
 
01:01:04.230 --> 01:01:04.240 align:start position:0%
did you turn on your microphone
 
01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
sorry and i was stepping back thank you
 
01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
when when you take a look at rsa 149
 
01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
colon m
 
01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:14.470 align:start position:0%
colon m
the

01:01:14.470 --> 01:01:14.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:15.190 align:start position:0%
the
it

01:01:15.190 --> 01:01:15.200 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
in there it says that they have
 
01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
rule-making authority and that they have
 
01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
to comply with the rules
 
01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
but they get to determine whether they
 
01:01:25.829 --> 01:01:25.839 align:start position:0%
comply with the rules and they can spend
 
01:01:30.309 --> 01:01:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:32.069 --> 01:01:32.079 align:start position:0%
but but isn't that the case with every
 
01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
one of these funds it's it's under the
 
01:01:36.630 --> 01:01:36.640 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of
 
01:01:38.309 --> 01:01:38.319 align:start position:0%
well this specifically says are any
 
01:01:40.390 --> 01:01:40.400 align:start position:0%
other uh
 
01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:41.510 align:start position:0%
other uh
funds

01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:01:43.589 --> 01:01:43.599 align:start position:0%
meeting the their criteria which is
 
01:01:47.589 --> 01:01:47.599 align:start position:0%
management of solid waste so i mean
 
01:01:49.109 --> 01:01:49.119 align:start position:0%
but that's why i mean the rules are
 
01:01:52.470 --> 01:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
going to go to jail car and
 
01:01:53.589 --> 01:01:53.599 align:start position:0%
you would think that that kind of thing
 
01:01:55.750 --> 01:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
would be challenged if if if they felt
 
01:01:57.510 --> 01:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
that the rules were people are going to
 
01:02:01.670 --> 01:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:04.720 align:start position:0%
i i i okay does anybody else support
 
01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:05.670 align:start position:0%
i i i okay does anybody else support
what

01:02:05.670 --> 01:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
representative ruler is saying
 
01:02:11.430 --> 01:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
are we complicating this too much
 
01:02:13.349 --> 01:02:13.359 align:start position:0%
maybe we are
 
01:02:16.069 --> 01:02:16.079 align:start position:0%
okay i don't see any other that think
 
01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
they're going to jump and
 
01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
represent this pillsbury
 
01:02:21.029 --> 01:02:21.039 align:start position:0%
i would just simply say i find the whole
 
01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:29.589 --> 01:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say much
 
01:02:31.670 --> 01:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
about what its intentions are
 
01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:33.349 align:start position:0%
about what its intentions are
so

01:02:33.349 --> 01:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:41.430 align:start position:0%
 
well

01:02:41.430 --> 01:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:43.029 align:start position:0%
well
yes

01:02:43.029 --> 01:02:43.039 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
i think that the problem is that
 
01:02:47.670 --> 01:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
environment and agriculture has been
 
01:02:49.589 --> 01:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
dealing with this for
 
01:02:52.390 --> 01:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
some time now and they put together a
 
01:02:54.549 --> 01:02:54.559 align:start position:0%
massive study committee
 
01:02:57.270 --> 01:02:57.280 align:start position:0%
that on is looking at the entire issue
 
01:02:59.670 --> 01:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
of waste disposal in this state
 
01:03:03.190 --> 01:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
on just last year i think that's
 
01:03:04.870 --> 01:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
operating now
 
01:03:07.510 --> 01:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
and which is i think it's a commission
 
01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:08.789 align:start position:0%
and which is i think it's a commission
and

01:03:08.789 --> 01:03:08.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:03:08.799 --> 01:03:09.990 align:start position:0%
and
on

01:03:09.990 --> 01:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
and this is just a piece of it they
 
01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:14.309 align:start position:0%
and this is just a piece of it they
decided

01:03:14.309 --> 01:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
decided
 
01:03:14.319 --> 01:03:15.109 align:start position:0%
decided
that

01:03:15.109 --> 01:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:03:18.630 --> 01:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
they really need to be able to
 
01:03:21.829 --> 01:03:21.839 align:start position:0%
or help organize the effort of local
 
01:03:24.230 --> 01:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
municipalities who are struggling
 
01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:25.510 align:start position:0%
municipalities who are struggling
with

01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:03:28.069 --> 01:03:28.079 align:start position:0%
if their transfer stations can send to
 
01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
the next landfill because the landfill
 
01:03:33.430 --> 01:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
is filling up is which is in our case a
 
01:03:36.870 --> 01:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:40.069 --> 01:03:40.079 align:start position:0%
we keep on managing to extend
 
01:03:42.630 --> 01:03:42.640 align:start position:0%
a few years at a time into the future
 
01:03:44.789 --> 01:03:44.799 align:start position:0%
when we won't be able to do it anymore
 
01:03:46.950 --> 01:03:46.960 align:start position:0%
and for a place in vermont was supposed
 
01:03:49.029 --> 01:03:49.039 align:start position:0%
to take over from us and has closed it
 
01:03:49.039 --> 01:03:50.710 align:start position:0%
to take over from us and has closed it
down

01:03:50.710 --> 01:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
down
 
01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:53.109 align:start position:0%
down
so

01:03:53.109 --> 01:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:53.119 --> 01:03:54.710 align:start position:0%
 
they

01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:03:57.670 --> 01:03:57.680 align:start position:0%
this is going on
 
01:04:01.029 --> 01:04:01.039 align:start position:0%
all over the state and there are ways
 
01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
by reducing the waste that goes into the
 
01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:06.150 align:start position:0%
by reducing the waste that goes into the
landfill

01:04:06.150 --> 01:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
landfill
 
01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:08.230 align:start position:0%
landfill
by

01:04:08.230 --> 01:04:08.240 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:11.440 align:start position:0%
reusing some of it for energy reusing
 
01:04:13.349 --> 01:04:13.359 align:start position:0%
some of it
 
01:04:15.109 --> 01:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
by recycling
 
01:04:15.119 --> 01:04:16.150 align:start position:0%
by recycling
that

01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:04:18.069 --> 01:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
that you can extend the use of those
 
01:04:20.230 --> 01:04:20.240 align:start position:0%
landfills a long time
 
01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:21.589 align:start position:0%
landfills a long time
but

01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:04:24.069 --> 01:04:24.079 align:start position:0%
it takes some resources
 
01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
for the municipalities that's what this
 
01:04:27.270 --> 01:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
thing is
 
01:04:29.270 --> 01:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
talking about it takes some guidance
 
01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
from people who really know what they're
 
01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:31.829 align:start position:0%
from people who really know what they're
doing

01:04:31.829 --> 01:04:31.839 align:start position:0%
doing
 
01:04:31.839 --> 01:04:33.190 align:start position:0%
doing
on

01:04:33.190 --> 01:04:33.200 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:04:36.549 --> 01:04:36.559 align:start position:0%
in lebanon our landfill manager is
 
01:04:38.390 --> 01:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
actually the guy that was head of
 
01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
planning before they ran out of money
 
01:04:44.069 --> 01:04:44.079 align:start position:0%
in the state level and so he's really
 
01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
good but apparently they have two
 
01:04:49.589 --> 01:04:49.599 align:start position:0%
good people that they've managed to find
 
01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
funding for in des right now that are
 
01:04:57.029 --> 01:04:57.039 align:start position:0%
are reviving planning
 
01:04:59.190 --> 01:04:59.200 align:start position:0%
so that part of it they've managed to
 
01:04:59.200 --> 01:04:59.990 align:start position:0%
so that part of it they've managed to
take

01:04:59.990 --> 01:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
take
 
01:05:03.270 --> 01:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
care of in other committees
 
01:05:05.670 --> 01:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
this part of it the dedicated fund would
 
01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:06.390 align:start position:0%
this part of it the dedicated fund would
be

01:05:06.390 --> 01:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:05:09.510 --> 01:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
to help provide resources to the towns
 
01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:11.109 align:start position:0%
to help provide resources to the towns
that

01:05:11.109 --> 01:05:11.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:05:13.270 --> 01:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
that on
 
01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
need a bit of extra money to figure out
 
01:05:19.910 --> 01:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
the recycling to figure out
 
01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:20.829 align:start position:0%
the recycling to figure out
any

01:05:20.829 --> 01:05:20.839 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:05:24.549 --> 01:05:24.559 align:start position:0%
conversions of part of the
 
01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
of the waste stream to
 
01:05:29.589 --> 01:05:29.599 align:start position:0%
productive uses like
 
01:05:30.789 --> 01:05:30.799 align:start position:0%
we've just
 
01:05:31.910 --> 01:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
built in
 
01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:34.069 align:start position:0%
built in
and

01:05:34.069 --> 01:05:34.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:05:35.670 --> 01:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
methane to
 
01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:37.430 align:start position:0%
methane to
energy

01:05:37.430 --> 01:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
energy
 
01:05:38.950 --> 01:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
component that we've been trying to
 
01:05:40.950 --> 01:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
build for 10 years that we've finally
 
01:05:43.910 --> 01:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:45.510 --> 01:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
representative southworth and suburbs
 
01:05:47.829 --> 01:05:47.839 align:start position:0%
and rory ah thank you there are some
 
01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
details starting line 22 i think that's
 
01:05:53.029 --> 01:05:53.039 align:start position:0%
the beginning um you know perhaps some
 
01:05:54.710 --> 01:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
people would like more details but that
 
01:05:57.109 --> 01:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
certainly gives a starting point for the
 
01:06:00.309 --> 01:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
kind of things that would be covered
 
01:06:00.319 --> 01:06:02.230 align:start position:0%
kind of things that would be covered
representative

01:06:02.230 --> 01:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:03.430 align:start position:0%
representative
yeah

01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:06:06.789 --> 01:06:06.799 align:start position:0%
directly to representative army um
 
01:06:08.789 --> 01:06:08.799 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the fund is fine it's
 
01:06:11.029 --> 01:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
perfect i mean i shouldn't say perfect
 
01:06:13.029 --> 01:06:13.039 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that's perfect but it's
 
01:06:15.589 --> 01:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
it's a good idea the quick the only
 
01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
question that i have is
 
01:06:19.670 --> 01:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
you have a requirement for
 
01:06:21.109 --> 01:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
a report
 
01:06:23.029 --> 01:06:23.039 align:start position:0%
to the agency that says that you have a
 
01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
requirement for the report that the
 
01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:27.029 align:start position:0%
requirement for the report that the
agency

01:06:27.029 --> 01:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
agency
 
01:06:27.039 --> 01:06:31.589 align:start position:0%
agency
keeps

01:06:31.589 --> 01:06:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
yeah it's a public record
 
01:06:36.309 --> 01:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
but none of the people that are are
 
01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
dealing with i mean the treasurer
 
01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.349 align:start position:0%
dealing with i mean the treasurer
doesn't

01:06:39.349 --> 01:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
01:06:41.190 --> 01:06:41.200 align:start position:0%
is just putting money into the fund
 
01:06:43.510 --> 01:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
there's no oversight of the fund other
 
01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:44.549 align:start position:0%
there's no oversight of the fund other
than

01:06:44.549 --> 01:06:44.559 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:06:47.589 --> 01:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
the entity that's writing its own rules
 
01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:06:51.190 --> 01:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
receives a report saying it's complying
 
01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
with its own rules and where they spent
 
01:06:55.270 --> 01:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
the money so do you want to add do you
 
01:06:57.349 --> 01:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
want to add a copy of the report goes to
 
01:07:00.150 --> 01:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
the governor to the you know
 
01:07:01.510 --> 01:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
the speaker of the house we've seen
 
01:07:03.349 --> 01:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
those what do you want what do you want
 
01:07:04.870 --> 01:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
the reason that would be fine and that's
 
01:07:07.029 --> 01:07:07.039 align:start position:0%
what i suggested earlier that that's all
 
01:07:09.349 --> 01:07:09.359 align:start position:0%
i'm suggesting is that uh that this
 
01:07:09.359 --> 01:07:10.549 align:start position:0%
i'm suggesting is that uh that this
become

01:07:10.549 --> 01:07:10.559 align:start position:0%
become
 
01:07:12.390 --> 01:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
more available to
 
01:07:14.950 --> 01:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
the the general public to to see what's
 
01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
going on because you're dealing with a
 
01:07:18.710 --> 01:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
substantial amount of fund and i really
 
01:07:21.349 --> 01:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
don't like to see an agency running
 
01:07:23.670 --> 01:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
itself and certifying to itself that it
 
01:07:26.309 --> 01:07:26.319 align:start position:0%
did what it said it did
 
01:07:27.270 --> 01:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:07:29.589 --> 01:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
01:07:31.190 --> 01:07:31.200 align:start position:0%
i don't really have any objection to
 
01:07:33.589 --> 01:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
that i don't myself think it's necessary
 
01:07:35.589 --> 01:07:35.599 align:start position:0%
but i certainly won't stand in the way
 
01:07:37.029 --> 01:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
but i would
 
01:07:40.589 --> 01:07:40.599 align:start position:0%
i've just also found the
 
01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
2019 biennial report remember these are
 
01:07:45.829 --> 01:07:45.839 align:start position:0%
biannual reports
 
01:07:48.390 --> 01:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
uh on online is
 
01:07:52.230 --> 01:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
at the website of ges uh it's
 
01:07:55.190 --> 01:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
a solid 19 pages of uh
 
01:07:57.829 --> 01:07:57.839 align:start position:0%
single space type that looks very
 
01:07:58.950 --> 01:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
thorough and now they're going to have
 
01:08:00.309 --> 01:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
to add to it
 
01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
activities and finances
 
01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
of the solid waste management fund and a
 
01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
report on that
 
01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:08.789 align:start position:0%
report on that
so

01:08:08.789 --> 01:08:08.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:08:13.589 --> 01:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:13.599 --> 01:08:15.190 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:08:15.190 --> 01:08:15.200 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:08:19.269 --> 01:08:19.279 align:start position:0%
so there's one report for the entire des
 
01:08:19.279 --> 01:08:20.309 align:start position:0%
so there's one report for the entire des
i

01:08:20.309 --> 01:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
i can't answer it that way because i
 
01:08:24.309 --> 01:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
don't know what the other statutes say
 
01:08:26.070 --> 01:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
they have to report on
 
01:08:27.910 --> 01:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
but now they're going to have to report
 
01:08:31.510 --> 01:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
on whatever that is plus
 
01:08:34.870 --> 01:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
this this fund activity it's got solid
 
01:08:36.870 --> 01:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
waste programs
 
01:08:39.030 --> 01:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh congressional actions and court
 
01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:40.950 align:start position:0%
uh congressional actions and court
rulings

01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
rulings
 
01:08:44.789 --> 01:08:44.799 align:start position:0%
oh all sorts of stuff right
 
01:08:44.799 --> 01:08:45.590 align:start position:0%
oh all sorts of stuff right
right

01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:08:49.430 --> 01:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
yeah and so forth so thank you yeah i i
 
01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:51.030 align:start position:0%
yeah and so forth so thank you yeah i i
was

01:08:51.030 --> 01:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
i just texted
 
01:08:55.269 --> 01:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
karen abel uh waters
 
01:08:57.669 --> 01:08:57.679 align:start position:0%
i could call him up apparently but
 
01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh they're on the reports are online
 
01:09:03.189 --> 01:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
like any agency reports there's also a
 
01:09:05.749 --> 01:09:05.759 align:start position:0%
long-range solid waste plan also
 
01:09:05.759 --> 01:09:06.870 align:start position:0%
long-range solid waste plan also
available

01:09:06.870 --> 01:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:09:09.349 --> 01:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
so this isn't necessary
 
01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:09:13.669 --> 01:09:13.679 align:start position:0%
all right i'm going to i'm going to say
 
01:09:15.349 --> 01:09:15.359 align:start position:0%
let's start with this does anybody want
 
01:09:17.829 --> 01:09:17.839 align:start position:0%
to amend this bill in some way
 
01:09:19.269 --> 01:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
we're up against the clock too that's
 
01:09:20.950 --> 01:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
the other problem you know do we have
 
01:09:22.149 --> 01:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to sit around for a
 
01:09:23.829 --> 01:09:23.839 align:start position:0%
couple hours waiting for for amendment
 
01:09:24.870 --> 01:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
to come
 
01:09:26.630 --> 01:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
i don't think anybody wants to
 
01:09:28.229 --> 01:09:28.239 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:09:30.309 --> 01:09:30.319 align:start position:0%
how much coffee do we have
 
01:09:30.319 --> 01:09:32.550 align:start position:0%
how much coffee do we have
so

01:09:32.550 --> 01:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
i'm just gonna say just show our hands
 
01:09:36.470 --> 01:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
who just wants to move this bill right
 
01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:39.349 align:start position:0%
who just wants to move this bill right
now

01:09:39.349 --> 01:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
okay well majority so i think we're
 
01:09:43.349 --> 01:09:43.359 align:start position:0%
gonna do that mr chair
 
01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
bad legislation comes out of haste but
 
01:09:48.550 --> 01:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
i will not object
 
01:09:50.550 --> 01:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
you know for this kind of thing
 
01:09:51.749 --> 01:09:51.759 align:start position:0%
uh to me
 
01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
to me a lot of this i mean we have we
 
01:09:56.229 --> 01:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
have some faith in our uh
 
01:09:58.470 --> 01:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
office of legislative services
 
01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
when they draft these kind of bills i
 
01:10:01.270 --> 01:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
mean this isn't the first fun build
 
01:10:03.030 --> 01:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
they've seen
 
01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
that and it'd be a big omission if they
 
01:10:08.070 --> 01:10:08.080 align:start position:0%
thought they were you know omitting
 
01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
something from the standard language but
 
01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:11.669 align:start position:0%
something from the standard language but
anyway

01:10:11.669 --> 01:10:11.679 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
01:10:14.870 --> 01:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm gonna uh any other any other
 
01:10:17.830 --> 01:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
discussion uh i'd just like to add to
 
01:10:18.870 --> 01:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
that that
 
01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
i think actually putting it in the
 
01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
in the biennial report of the department
 
01:10:27.110 --> 01:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
01:10:29.830 --> 01:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
is the best place we can because anybody
 
01:10:31.590 --> 01:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
who's dealing with environmental
 
01:10:34.470 --> 01:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
problems reads through that thing
 
01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
from the outside we usually don't have
 
01:10:40.070 --> 01:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:41.590 --> 01:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
all right so we're going to go into
 
01:10:44.229 --> 01:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
01:10:47.030 --> 01:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh i'll make the motion
 
01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:48.149 align:start position:0%
uh i'll make the motion
uh

01:10:48.149 --> 01:10:48.159 align:start position:0%

discussion on

01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
why don't you just refresh our memories
 
01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
on what that which one that bill was and
 
01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
then well we'll let keane go first and
 
01:13:08.870 --> 01:13:08.880 align:start position:0%

01:13:13.830 --> 01:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
morning representatives keen mayweather
 
01:13:14.630 --> 01:13:14.640 align:start position:0%
for the department of revenue
 
01:13:17.350 --> 01:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
administration uh i'm here to provide an
 
01:13:20.310 --> 01:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
update on house bill 1097
 
01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
which is relative to the taxation of
 
01:13:25.110 --> 01:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
income of new hampshire residents when
 
01:13:27.270 --> 01:13:27.280 align:start position:0%
working remotely for an out of state
 
01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:29.430 align:start position:0%
working remotely for an out of state
employer

01:13:29.430 --> 01:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
employer
 
01:13:32.149 --> 01:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
this bill went through the senate ways
 
01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
and means committee and they requested
 
01:13:36.310 --> 01:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
for an amendment to
 
01:13:38.630 --> 01:13:38.640 align:start position:0%
to the bill they did not
 
01:13:40.950 --> 01:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
like the um they prefer not to have the
 
01:13:43.510 --> 01:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
language that we added that the dra
 
01:13:45.110 --> 01:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
added um
 
01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
in sections two and three which
 
01:13:51.030 --> 01:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
just says that uh none of these the
 
01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
language of this bill shall impact the
 
01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
uh application of the bpt and the bad
 
01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:57.669 align:start position:0%
uh application of the bpt and the bad
taxes

01:13:57.669 --> 01:13:57.679 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
01:14:01.510 --> 01:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
to that effect we redrafted the bill
 
01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
and removed those two
 
01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:05.350 align:start position:0%
and removed those two
subsections

01:14:05.350 --> 01:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
subsections
 
01:14:07.830 --> 01:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
and we basically what we did was to
 
01:14:10.470 --> 01:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
refocus the bill language specifically
 
01:14:11.910 --> 01:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:14:14.310 --> 01:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
employment employee employer employee
 
01:14:16.229 --> 01:14:16.239 align:start position:0%
income and therefore
 
01:14:19.189 --> 01:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
trying to avoid any sort of implications
 
01:14:22.070 --> 01:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
to spread outside that scope of income
 
01:14:23.590 --> 01:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
um i brought
 
01:14:26.950 --> 01:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
a copy of the amended the senate amended
 
01:14:29.669 --> 01:14:29.679 align:start position:0%
bill in case if
 
01:14:31.350 --> 01:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
this is printed from the
 
01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
gen court website okay yeah
 
01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
that'd be great
 
01:14:37.590 --> 01:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
the reason we're hearing this is that
 
01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:38.470 align:start position:0%
the reason we're hearing this is that
they're

01:14:38.470 --> 01:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:14:40.470 --> 01:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
the senate's going to ask if we concur
 
01:14:42.630 --> 01:14:42.640 align:start position:0%
on this or not so we need to just
 
01:14:46.950 --> 01:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
if we don't concur you know we're
 
01:14:50.470 --> 01:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
probably asking for a uh
 
01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
a committee a conference but
 
01:14:54.149 --> 01:14:54.159 align:start position:0%
but we're also going to hear from
 
01:14:56.390 --> 01:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury who spent a
 
01:14:58.070 --> 01:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
lot of time with this and testified over
 
01:15:13.110 --> 01:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:29.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:15:29.990 --> 01:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:31.350 --> 01:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
how many did you bring
 
01:15:34.630 --> 01:15:34.640 align:start position:0%
i brought 25 copies okay some somehow
 
01:15:36.390 --> 01:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
they got jammed up somewhere
 
01:15:45.030 --> 01:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:59.669 --> 01:15:59.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:01.669 --> 01:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
the basic language of the bill remains
 
01:16:04.470 --> 01:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
the same um i did not uh
 
01:16:05.350 --> 01:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
did not
 
01:16:08.709 --> 01:16:08.719 align:start position:0%
we did not amend uh or revise the uh
 
01:16:08.719 --> 01:16:10.229 align:start position:0%
we did not amend uh or revise the uh
the

01:16:10.229 --> 01:16:10.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:16:11.830 --> 01:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the bill
 
01:16:14.790 --> 01:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
uh the only thing we did was to just
 
01:16:16.310 --> 01:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
put in the additional language
 
01:16:18.470 --> 01:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
specifically focusing the bill towards
 
01:16:25.590 --> 01:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:27.510 --> 01:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
yeah is that
 
01:16:30.550 --> 01:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
line where line 10
 
01:16:32.070 --> 01:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
yes that's right
 
01:16:38.149 --> 01:16:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:38.159 --> 01:16:40.709 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:16:40.709 --> 01:16:40.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
and uh you feel you feel comfortable
 
01:16:44.790 --> 01:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
with this change
 
01:16:47.350 --> 01:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
yes uh a few few members of the
 
01:16:49.590 --> 01:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
department revenue
 
01:16:51.510 --> 01:16:51.520 align:start position:0%
senior members of the department revenue
 
01:16:53.350 --> 01:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
look through this and we're
 
01:16:55.189 --> 01:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
we're comfortable we did not run this
 
01:16:59.350 --> 01:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
through by the ag's office again so um
 
01:17:02.310 --> 01:17:02.320 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure that's necessary and
 
01:17:04.070 --> 01:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:17:07.350 --> 01:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
and the senate committee had actually
 
01:17:09.189 --> 01:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
wanted to
 
01:17:10.950 --> 01:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
obtain input from
 
01:17:13.030 --> 01:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
attorney bill artinger
 
01:17:15.510 --> 01:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
but i'm not sure if that
 
01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:16.550 align:start position:0%
but i'm not sure if that
happened

01:17:16.550 --> 01:17:16.560 align:start position:0%
happened
 
01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:17.830 align:start position:0%
happened
okay

01:17:17.830 --> 01:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:17:20.630 --> 01:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
yeah we know a lot of us know bill argue
 
01:17:22.709 --> 01:17:22.719 align:start position:0%
on this committee yeah so
 
01:17:24.229 --> 01:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:17:25.350 --> 01:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
questions for
 
01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:26.149 align:start position:0%
questions for
yeah

01:17:26.149 --> 01:17:26.159 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
representative ames
 
01:17:32.070 --> 01:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
uh first is a question to you and that
 
01:17:34.870 --> 01:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
is timing on this consideration of this
 
01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:35.830 align:start position:0%
is timing on this consideration of this
this

01:17:35.830 --> 01:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:17:38.550 --> 01:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
will be coming back to
 
01:17:41.350 --> 01:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
presumably we'll be coming back after
 
01:17:43.750 --> 01:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
senate action which hasn't happened yet
 
01:17:45.189 --> 01:17:45.199 align:start position:0%
right that's why we haven't gotten the
 
01:17:47.110 --> 01:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
formal so it hasn't even gotten to that
 
01:17:48.390 --> 01:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
point but at some point it's going to
 
01:17:51.110 --> 01:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
come back to the house for concurrence
 
01:17:53.990 --> 01:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
or non-concurrence and so forth right
 
01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
so it sounds like we've got some time
 
01:17:59.270 --> 01:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
and what i'd like to ask since uh
 
01:18:01.350 --> 01:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
none of us have seen or else most of us
 
01:18:02.950 --> 01:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
have not seen this
 
01:18:04.229 --> 01:18:04.239 align:start position:0%
is to
 
01:18:06.630 --> 01:18:06.640 align:start position:0%
have time to take it back and
 
01:18:09.830 --> 01:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
look at what uh transpired before
 
01:18:13.350 --> 01:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
and what we ended up with and then uh
 
01:18:16.550 --> 01:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
make an informed decision after that
 
01:18:19.270 --> 01:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
discuss and so forth right and i i can't
 
01:18:21.270 --> 01:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
remember the dates now we're meeting
 
01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
next week two days
 
01:18:26.229 --> 01:18:26.239 align:start position:0%
probably the senate's voting as well so
 
01:18:28.149 --> 01:18:28.159 align:start position:0%
when when do we have to have our concurs
 
01:18:30.070 --> 01:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
not concurs i think the week the week
 
01:18:32.470 --> 01:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
later right after that
 
01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:33.750 align:start position:0%
later right after that
right

01:18:33.750 --> 01:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:18:36.070 --> 01:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
so i'm trying to think of and i know
 
01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:36.950 align:start position:0%
so i'm trying to think of and i know
norm

01:18:36.950 --> 01:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
norm
 
01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
represent major was planning on doing
 
01:18:40.070 --> 01:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
some review estimating so we would
 
01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
probably be together one more time
 
01:18:45.830 --> 01:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
before we have to have our
 
01:18:47.430 --> 01:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
do we want to commit a conference and i
 
01:18:49.750 --> 01:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
don't want yeah so i that's why i was
 
01:18:50.790 --> 01:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
concerned but i think there's a good
 
01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:52.229 align:start position:0%
concerned but i think there's a good
preview

01:18:52.229 --> 01:18:52.239 align:start position:0%
preview
 
01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
of what's coming so i think we'll
 
01:18:56.709 --> 01:18:56.719 align:start position:0%
you know just in case i was saying well
 
01:18:59.270 --> 01:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
let's have this discussion so that
 
01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
you know we don't have to come in just
 
01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:01.990 align:start position:0%
you know we don't have to come in just
to

01:19:01.990 --> 01:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:19:04.709 --> 01:19:04.719 align:start position:0%
discuss this but it sounds like if it's
 
01:19:06.870 --> 01:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
a couple weeks out that we will be okay
 
01:19:09.830 --> 01:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
yeah it's very good that we have this uh
 
01:19:11.750 --> 01:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
we got time to look at it carefully and
 
01:19:14.070 --> 01:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
be thoughtful about it so uh good
 
01:19:16.550 --> 01:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
process okay any other questions of and
 
01:19:22.149 --> 01:19:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:22.159 --> 01:19:23.669 align:start position:0%
 
there's

01:19:23.669 --> 01:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:19:25.910 --> 01:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
the senate oh they are they'll be voting
 
01:19:30.149 --> 01:19:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:32.149 --> 01:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
right so we could
 
01:19:45.270 --> 01:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:47.030 --> 01:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
they're meeting on
 
01:19:49.430 --> 01:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
this thursday the 28th
 
01:19:51.270 --> 01:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
and so they'll probably be taking this
 
01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:52.310 align:start position:0%
and so they'll probably be taking this
up

01:19:52.310 --> 01:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:53.430 align:start position:0%
up
on

01:19:53.430 --> 01:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:54.709 align:start position:0%
on
but

01:19:54.709 --> 01:19:54.719 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:19:54.719 --> 01:19:55.430 align:start position:0%
but
we

01:19:55.430 --> 01:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:20:00.229 --> 01:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:01.910 --> 01:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
but on
 
01:20:03.430 --> 01:20:03.440 align:start position:0%
i think that you could just go to the
 
01:20:06.790 --> 01:20:06.800 align:start position:0%
speaker and say we're not ready yet
 
01:20:09.669 --> 01:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
can you please do this one on the 20 on
 
01:20:11.030 --> 01:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
the 12th
 
01:20:13.189 --> 01:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
right on the 12th right
 
01:20:14.950 --> 01:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
right but you'd have to tell them oh no
 
01:20:17.110 --> 01:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
no yeah absolutely we
 
01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:18.950 align:start position:0%
no yeah absolutely we
absolutely

01:20:18.950 --> 01:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:19.830 align:start position:0%
absolutely
so

01:20:19.830 --> 01:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:20:21.030 --> 01:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh all right before we get to
 
01:20:22.870 --> 01:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
representative pillsbury uh remember
 
01:20:25.030 --> 01:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
generally yeah just uh for
 
01:20:26.790 --> 01:20:26.800 align:start position:0%
representative spillsberry's uh
 
01:20:29.350 --> 01:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
presentation uh regarding the
 
01:20:32.550 --> 01:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
discussion that brought this up so i
 
01:20:34.629 --> 01:20:34.639 align:start position:0%
don't have to ask the question again
 
01:20:34.639 --> 01:20:35.750 align:start position:0%
don't have to ask the question again
um

01:20:35.750 --> 01:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:37.910 --> 01:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
was the purpose to eliminate
 
01:20:40.229 --> 01:20:40.239 align:start position:0%
reference to specific sections of law to
 
01:20:42.390 --> 01:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
make this more broad
 
01:20:44.550 --> 01:20:44.560 align:start position:0%
uh without getting down into the weeds
 
01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:48.320 align:start position:0%
about bet bpt and all that confusion
 
01:20:50.950 --> 01:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
that's for a question for representative
 
01:20:52.790 --> 01:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
spillsberry as he gets into his presence
 
01:20:54.550 --> 01:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
okay thank you okay because i think he
 
01:20:56.709 --> 01:20:56.719 align:start position:0%
can explain it better than i can so
 
01:20:58.629 --> 01:20:58.639 align:start position:0%
representative pillsbury
 
01:21:00.390 --> 01:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman explain what
 
01:21:01.510 --> 01:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
happened at the same time sure quite a
 
01:21:03.030 --> 01:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
bit has been said so i'll try not to be
 
01:21:05.430 --> 01:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
redundant but uh very simply
 
01:21:08.709 --> 01:21:08.719 align:start position:0%
um house ways and means hearing
 
01:21:11.270 --> 01:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh i thought was very well focused uh
 
01:21:13.910 --> 01:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
both representative ames and i testified
 
01:21:16.390 --> 01:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
as did king
 
01:21:18.709 --> 01:21:18.719 align:start position:0%
i think the members
 
01:21:22.709 --> 01:21:22.719 align:start position:0%
very quickly focused on the clutter
 
01:21:24.629 --> 01:21:24.639 align:start position:0%
and the distraction
 
01:21:26.470 --> 01:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
that was created in the bill by the
 
01:21:29.110 --> 01:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
references of disclaimers to the bpt and
 
01:21:31.910 --> 01:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
the bet so they asked the question
 
01:21:33.830 --> 01:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
whether we would object to having those
 
01:21:36.229 --> 01:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
eliminated and what
 
01:21:38.229 --> 01:21:38.239 align:start position:0%
what would we suggest
 
01:21:40.149 --> 01:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
if they were to be eliminated
 
01:21:42.950 --> 01:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
and i believe it's correct speaking for
 
01:21:44.629 --> 01:21:44.639 align:start position:0%
representative ames that we both said
 
01:21:46.310 --> 01:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
yes we would prefer to see those
 
01:21:48.229 --> 01:21:48.239 align:start position:0%
provisions removed
 
01:21:49.430 --> 01:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
and that
 
01:21:51.350 --> 01:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
what would be necessary is simply to
 
01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:52.550 align:start position:0%
what would be necessary is simply to
ensure

01:21:52.550 --> 01:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
ensure
 
01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
that words were chosen in the first
 
01:21:58.629 --> 01:21:58.639 align:start position:0%
paragraph that were specific enough to
 
01:22:01.510 --> 01:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
clarify exactly what income the bill
 
01:22:04.070 --> 01:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
does apply to then there would be no
 
01:22:05.910 --> 01:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
reason to state what
 
01:22:08.629 --> 01:22:08.639 align:start position:0%
in what taxes the bill does not relate
 
01:22:08.639 --> 01:22:09.590 align:start position:0%
in what taxes the bill does not relate
to

01:22:09.590 --> 01:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:22:11.189 --> 01:22:11.199 align:start position:0%
so the language
 
01:22:14.470 --> 01:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
that keen then keem took on the task
 
01:22:16.950 --> 01:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
at senator guida's request
 
01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:17.990 align:start position:0%
at senator guida's request
and

01:22:17.990 --> 01:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:22:21.830 --> 01:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
he put in the phrase nine and ten
 
01:22:24.149 --> 01:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
income from employer employee
 
01:22:26.709 --> 01:22:26.719 align:start position:0%
relationships such as wage income salary
 
01:22:28.709 --> 01:22:28.719 align:start position:0%
income or other employee compensation
 
01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
earned or received by residents
 
01:22:33.830 --> 01:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
and i'm very pleased with this i think
 
01:22:35.830 --> 01:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
this is excellent
 
01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:37.510 align:start position:0%
this is excellent
also

01:22:37.510 --> 01:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:22:39.430 --> 01:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
as i had committed to the committee that
 
01:22:41.189 --> 01:22:41.199 align:start position:0%
i would work with the senate i brought
 
01:22:43.430 --> 01:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
to their attention the suggestion that i
 
01:22:46.149 --> 01:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
believe representative hillary and ames
 
01:22:47.669 --> 01:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
had both made
 
01:22:49.110 --> 01:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
that the word
 
01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:51.110 align:start position:0%
that the word
may

01:22:51.110 --> 01:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
may
 
01:22:52.950 --> 01:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
in line 12
 
01:22:55.189 --> 01:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
be changed to shall so those are the
 
01:22:56.790 --> 01:22:56.800 align:start position:0%
only two changes to the bill it's the
 
01:22:58.149 --> 01:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
deletion of the second and third
 
01:23:00.870 --> 01:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
paragraphs that essentially became
