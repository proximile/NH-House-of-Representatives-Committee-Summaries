DHHS um we've received a nice binder of
 
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.629 align:start position:0%
DHHS um we've received a nice binder of

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:45.639 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
presentations and we have an equally
 
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:49.749 align:start position:0%
presentations and we have an equally
nice

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:49.759 align:start position:0%
nice
 
00:05:54.749 --> 00:05:54.759 align:start position:0%
hb1 that we can consult and um and so uh
 
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
we'll get going and I'll just I'll just
 
00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:00.280 align:start position:0%
ask you to be patient with us as we go
 
00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
back and forth we I I love the
 
00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000 align:start position:0%
presentation but we have to be able to
 
00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
see uh which line items we're referring
 
00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
to all right uh so with that uh I should
 
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
have clicked it already but let's
 
00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
go good morning members of the committee
 
00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.000 align:start position:0%
Nathan white Chief Financial Officer um
 
00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:21.039 align:start position:0%
I would also ask for patience this being
 
00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:22.520 align:start position:0%
the first day and I think we're all just
 
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
going to kind of get used to what we're
 
00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:27.199 align:start position:0%
looking at here and so what's before you
 
00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
um as uh the chair indicated there is a
 
00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:32.120 align:start position:0%
binder there we will be bringing the
 
00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:34.639 align:start position:0%
subsequent presentations and and we kind
 
00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:36.639 align:start position:0%
of set that up with tabs so you can add
 
00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:38.759 align:start position:0%
to that as we move forward through this
 
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.120 align:start position:0%
process so if you can start by you open
 
00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:44.560 align:start position:0%
up your binder and the first
 
00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:46.479 align:start position:0%
presentation there should be the
 
00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:49.160 align:start position:0%
division of finance um so I thought it
 
00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:50.759 align:start position:0%
was appropriate to kick off the budget
 
00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:53.560 align:start position:0%
detail conver detail conversations with
 
00:06:54.909 --> 00:06:54.919 align:start position:0%
talking about the division of finance
 
00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
that supports um the entire department
 
00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
and in the back towards the back of your
 
00:07:01.749 --> 00:07:01.759 align:start position:0%
book and I don't know if you want to
 
00:07:04.189 --> 00:07:04.199 align:start position:0%
take it out of the binder for today we
 
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:06.360 align:start position:0%
also have the budget briefing book
 
00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:08.120 align:start position:0%
sections for the office of the
 
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner um the division of finance
 
00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:14.039 align:start position:0%
is in accounting unit
 
00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
5676 which in the budget briefing book
 
00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
is page five and in the governor's
 
00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:22.919 align:start position:0%

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
1, and 40 uh again the budget briefing
 
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
book it's page five and then the
 
00:07:31.309 --> 00:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
governor's budget is page
 
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
1,40 where it starts okay just let us
 
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
catch up of course and and say the 1,000
 
00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
number again 1 what
 
00:07:45.469 --> 00:07:45.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:48.520 align:start position:0%
yes um so while I'm thumbing through
 
00:07:52.189 --> 00:07:52.199 align:start position:0%
this uh for those who are interested uh
 
00:07:53.469 --> 00:07:53.479 align:start position:0%
we're going to we're going to take a
 
00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:55.919 align:start position:0%
serious 2hour run at this and then we're
 
00:07:58.510 --> 00:07:58.520 align:start position:0%
going to take a a recess for lunch and
 
00:08:00.909 --> 00:08:00.919 align:start position:0%
then come back probably around 1:00
 
00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:04.280 align:start position:0%
depending on exactly when we uh
 
00:08:08.909 --> 00:08:08.919 align:start position:0%
recess um go ahead excellent so if you
 
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
um if you open up the the presentation
 
00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
the for the division of finance there uh
 
00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:15.560 align:start position:0%
the second page in there is the the
 
00:08:18.029 --> 00:08:18.039 align:start position:0%
mission for the division of finance um
 
00:08:19.869 --> 00:08:19.879 align:start position:0%
division of finance does does a couple
 
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:22.680 align:start position:0%
of really key things um we provide
 
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
reliable financial data data management
 
00:08:27.149 --> 00:08:27.159 align:start position:0%

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:30.360 align:start position:0%
also uh ad Minister all of the
 
00:08:32.949 --> 00:08:32.959 align:start position:0%
solicitations the rfps rfas contracts
 
00:08:35.829 --> 00:08:35.839 align:start position:0%
amendments so forth and so on and we try
 
00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
to do this in a comprehensive and
 
00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
collaborative manner across the
 
00:08:41.389 --> 00:08:41.399 align:start position:0%
department we work with every single
 
00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:44.200 align:start position:0%
division um both on the financial side
 
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
and on the procurement side of of the
 
00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:49.480 align:start position:0%
hat so on any given day I may talk to
 
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
every single um division director or
 
00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:54.760 align:start position:0%
their counterparts um either through the
 
00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
contracts work or the finance work that
 
00:08:59.870 --> 00:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
our team supports so so I just want to
 
00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:02.720 align:start position:0%
make sure I'm tracking with you I I I I
 
00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:06.680 align:start position:0%
think uh in this thick staple yes we're
 
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:09.640 align:start position:0%
on page five looking at the office of
 
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:12.160 align:start position:0%
business operations that is correct and
 
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
you're you're also referring to it as
 
00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:16.040 align:start position:0%
finance that is correct the division of
 
00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:19.720 align:start position:0%
finance okay yeah yeah so what what you
 
00:09:21.949 --> 00:09:21.959 align:start position:0%
will see I I think you actually make a
 
00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
really good point representative Edwards
 
00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:26.600 align:start position:0%
what you will see as we move uh through
 
00:09:29.069 --> 00:09:29.079 align:start position:0%
the budget is sometimes the operating
 
00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:31.880 align:start position:0%
name name May differ from the accounting
 
00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:34.360 align:start position:0%
unit name and there's some history
 
00:09:36.509 --> 00:09:36.519 align:start position:0%
behind that we do work on an ongoing
 
00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:38.440 align:start position:0%
basis to update those we have a small
 
00:09:40.829 --> 00:09:40.839 align:start position:0%
period in February of every other year
 
00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:43.000 align:start position:0%
to get the chart of accounts updated but
 
00:09:45.269 --> 00:09:45.279 align:start position:0%
there will be some discrepancies but but
 
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
I will point that out going forward I
 
00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
apologize for the oversight no no no
 
00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.150 align:start position:0%
apologize for the oversight no no no
problem

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:53.519 align:start position:0%
um the the good thing about not knowing
 
00:09:55.069 --> 00:09:55.079 align:start position:0%
exactly what I'm doing is I can
 
00:09:57.269 --> 00:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
anticipate the questions of the Freshman
 
00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:00.440 align:start position:0%
so um okay and then just to again to
 
00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're tracking on on page
 
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
1041 um there's a a bottom
 
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
line I think or is it a top line that
 
00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
says estimated source of funds for
 
00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
office of business operations is okay so
 
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
that's the beginning of of what we're
 
00:10:23.829 --> 00:10:23.839 align:start position:0%
we're looking at um that that's the end
 
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
so on page
 
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
1040 uh you you'll see the accounting
 
00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
unit detail where you have the 5 95 95
 
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
9500 and then 5676 that's the accounting
 
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
unit um and then it begins at that class
 
00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:39.720 align:start position:0%
10 the Personnel line there in front of
 
00:10:41.949 --> 00:10:41.959 align:start position:0%
you and then it continues onto the onto
 
00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
the second page give me give me a second
 
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
do you do you see that
 
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:57.310 align:start position:0%
 
041

00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:57.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
yeah which were right
 
00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:05.240 align:start position:0%
here okay and I'm I'm sorry for being
 
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
slow on this but uh once once we get
 
00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
this going it'll it'll go of course all
 
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:16.240 align:start position:0%
right thank you all right so um just to
 
00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
start pretty high level on page three of
 
00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
the PowerPoint presentation that we
 
00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
provided I have a highle oversight of
 
00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:26.680 align:start position:0%
the types of functions um that are
 
00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:28.200 align:start position:0%
support of the specific functions that
 
00:11:31.829 --> 00:11:31.839 align:start position:0%
are supported the bulk of our staff um
 
00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:33.880 align:start position:0%
are really related to what what I kind
 
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
of think about as being expenditures
 
00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:38.680 align:start position:0%
this is the daily financial management
 
00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:40.600 align:start position:0%
um we have Finance directors that
 
00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
oversee their respective areas so we
 
00:11:44.069 --> 00:11:44.079 align:start position:0%
have a finance director assigned the
 
00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
division of long-term support support
 
00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
supports and
 
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
services um and also the division for
 
00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:51.560 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health we have one division
 
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:53.480 align:start position:0%
director for the Medicaid Program we
 
00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
have one division director for the
 
00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
division of Public Health Services and
 
00:11:58.590 --> 00:11:58.600 align:start position:0%
we've tried to allocate those
 
00:12:00.829 --> 00:12:00.839 align:start position:0%
appropriately based on on the workloads
 
00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:04.200 align:start position:0%
that we see and this this is incredible
 
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:06.440 align:start position:0%
team of folks that do the audit
 
00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
activities the the daily AP AR the
 
00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
financial oversight they're looking at
 
00:12:14.509 --> 00:12:14.519 align:start position:0%
expense projections they're transf
 
00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
they're they're preparing those
 
00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
transfers that the fiscal committee sees
 
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we have the money in
 
00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
the right place and it's budgeted and
 
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
tracked appropriately and what's also
 
00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
really important here too is looking at
 
00:12:27.389 --> 00:12:27.399 align:start position:0%
the source of funds the requirements
 
00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:29.320 align:start position:0%
that may be attached to those making
 
00:12:30.829 --> 00:12:30.839 align:start position:0%
sure that we spend those maintenance of
 
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
effort dollars that are required and and
 
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
that's the bulk of the work that the
 
00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
team does on a daily basis we also have
 
00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
a revenue and Reporting team and this is
 
00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
the team that that does the the federal
 
00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
draws does a lot of the uh federal
 
00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:47.720 align:start position:0%
reporting we do expenditure reports for
 
00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
over 200 different
 
00:12:52.829 --> 00:12:52.839 align:start position:0%
programs um they they they work on the
 
00:12:55.629 --> 00:12:55.639 align:start position:0%
the the draw Downs the CMS 64 report is
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
a quarterly report that our team does
 
00:12:59.470 --> 00:12:59.480 align:start position:0%
it's in the hundreds of Millions of
 
00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
dollars every quarter um that that team
 
00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
reviews and that that takes a tremendous
 
00:13:06.509 --> 00:13:06.519 align:start position:0%
amount of preparation and then also
 
00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
responsible here is the team that looks
 
00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:11.240 align:start position:0%
over the public assistance cost
 
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
allocation plan so that's that plan that
 
00:13:15.269 --> 00:13:15.279 align:start position:0%
I had mentioned yesterday is 250 260
 
00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
pages long that allows us to allocate
 
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
Federal costs um as approved by the
 
00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:22.720 align:start position:0%
federal government to all of our
 
00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:24.069 align:start position:0%
federal government to all of our
programs

00:13:24.069 --> 00:13:24.079 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:13:27.629 --> 00:13:27.639 align:start position:0%
appropriately we also relatively knew uh
 
00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
about four year a little less than four
 
00:13:31.509 --> 00:13:31.519 align:start position:0%
years ago we established a rate setting
 
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
team before rate setting was kind of
 
00:13:36.509 --> 00:13:36.519 align:start position:0%
done in a decentralized manner we
 
00:13:40.389 --> 00:13:40.399 align:start position:0%
centralize that so the med the um $34
 
00:13:43.069 --> 00:13:43.079 align:start position:0%
million of Medicaid rates that were
 
00:13:46.509 --> 00:13:46.519 align:start position:0%
appropriated uh via hb2 from chapter 79
 
00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:49.240 align:start position:0%
laws of 2023 this is the team that did
 
00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:50.920 align:start position:0%
all the tremendous amount of work in
 
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
analyzing the hundreds and if not
 
00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
thousands of different individual rates
 
00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
comparing the Medicare rates Medicaid
 
00:14:00.829 --> 00:14:00.839 align:start position:0%
rates they also work on looking at they
 
00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
they rebase the County Nursing Facility
 
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
rates twice a year they do that work on
 
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
an ongoing basis they look at the cost
 
00:14:10.829 --> 00:14:10.839 align:start position:0%
reports and um it's it's a relatively
 
00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
small team but but they do quite a
 
00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:15.160 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of work there the
 
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
Contracting team the Contracting bureau
 
00:14:21.269 --> 00:14:21.279 align:start position:0%
there's 34 FTE there this team on any
 
00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
given year typically about 7 to 800
 
00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
contracts and amendments go through this
 
00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
team now an amendment could take
 
00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
anywhere from a month to 3 months
 
00:14:32.629 --> 00:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
depending on complexity a contract could
 
00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:35.000 align:start position:0%
take 6 months or a year a lot of that is
 
00:14:37.069 --> 00:14:37.079 align:start position:0%
often dependent upon whether there's it
 
00:14:39.509 --> 00:14:39.519 align:start position:0%
components whether there's unique or
 
00:14:41.069 --> 00:14:41.079 align:start position:0%
risk components that we need to take
 
00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
into account um or uh often times we do
 
00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:47.320 align:start position:0%
have trouble with some of our vendors
 
00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
where they may want to go back and forth
 
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
on a document I've seen that happen for
 
00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:53.320 align:start position:0%
eight months at a time where we're not
 
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
able to get to agreement on certain
 
00:14:56.829 --> 00:14:56.839 align:start position:0%
terms that's certainly the Rarity but
 
00:14:58.430 --> 00:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
it's part of the normal course of
 
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
business for Better or For Worse and
 
00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:01.240 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's something we can't
 
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
control they also um administer all of
 
00:15:07.749 --> 00:15:07.759 align:start position:0%
the rfps and rfas there's state law that
 
00:15:10.629 --> 00:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
specifies very particular rules around
 
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
what can be shared with our vendors when
 
00:15:15.189 --> 00:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
it can be shared and and the processes
 
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
that we must follow there and that
 
00:15:18.389 --> 00:15:18.399 align:start position:0%
team's responsible they they put out
 
00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:21.519 align:start position:0%
about 55 or 60 of those solicitations
 
00:15:23.949 --> 00:15:23.959 align:start position:0%
each year and then finally there's also
 
00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:26.680 align:start position:0%
a grants U management team and and this
 
00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:29.160 align:start position:0%
came into being seven or eight years ago
 
00:15:31.269 --> 00:15:31.279 align:start position:0%
following some changes at the federal
 
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
reel level around subrecipient
 
00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:35.000 align:start position:0%
monitoring we talked a lot about
 
00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:38.440 align:start position:0%
subrecipients and contractors last bium
 
00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
uh this is the team that oversees the um
 
00:15:43.189 --> 00:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
and helps administer the system where we
 
00:15:45.309 --> 00:15:45.319 align:start position:0%
assess the risk of all of our
 
00:15:47.189 --> 00:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
contractors before we enter into
 
00:15:49.189 --> 00:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
agreement we look at their financials we
 
00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
look at their programmatic risk have
 
00:15:53.189 --> 00:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
they had changes in oversight leadership
 
00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:55.160 align:start position:0%
uh do they have do they have history
 
00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:57.240 align:start position:0%
administering this contract and then
 
00:15:59.910 --> 00:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
based on those risks the contract team
 
00:16:02.309 --> 00:16:02.319 align:start position:0%
incorporates elements into the contract
 
00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:04.040 align:start position:0%
to account for the risks that have been
 
00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
identified so those two um those two
 
00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
components there work very closely
 
00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
together I have a a couple generic
 
00:16:16.189 --> 00:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
questions that sound will sound familiar
 
00:16:18.629 --> 00:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
by the time we get through all of this
 
00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
um what what is your your vacancy right
 
00:16:25.629 --> 00:16:25.639 align:start position:0%
here and are there any of these uh stove
 
00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:28.360 align:start position:0%
pipe functions these five functions that
 
00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:31.240 align:start position:0%
have trans transferred uh into the
 
00:16:33.189 --> 00:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
division of finance and procurement
 
00:16:36.309 --> 00:16:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:39.309 --> 00:16:39.319 align:start position:0%
2019 the since
 
00:16:42.189 --> 00:16:42.199 align:start position:0%
2019 yeah going back aways we're just
 
00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:46.040 align:start position:0%
sort of preco the these so the
 
00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:48.230 align:start position:0%
sort of preco the these so the
Contracting

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
Contracting
 
00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
team was previously under another
 
00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
component but I think that was pre 20109
 
00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
it was under another area of the
 
00:16:59.269 --> 00:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
department but I believe that's organiz
 
00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:01.480 align:start position:0%
the department has changed right um
 
00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:03.680 align:start position:0%
there were 18 positions that were
 
00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
unfunded in this area so basically all
 
00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:09.839 align:start position:0%
of the vacant positions that were uh
 
00:17:11.549 --> 00:17:11.559 align:start position:0%
vacant at that point in time were
 
00:17:14.189 --> 00:17:14.199 align:start position:0%
unfunded in the governor's budget so
 
00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
what is that put us that uh quick back
 
00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:19.079 align:start position:0%
to the envelope here so that's
 
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
010 personal services that's that going
 
00:17:26.669 --> 00:17:26.679 align:start position:0%
from 10.8 to
 
00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
9.9 in 26
 
00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
going from 25 10.8
 
00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:38.360 align:start position:0%
to 26 starting at 9.9 yep yep so it's in
 
00:17:40.669 --> 00:17:40.679 align:start position:0%
in class 10 you you will see the the
 
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
reduction there for the 18 vacant
 
00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.549 align:start position:0%
reduction there for the 18 vacant
positions

00:17:45.549 --> 00:17:45.559 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
okay or vacant and and now unfunded
 
00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
positions okay so what what kind of
 
00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
turnover do you experience here and and
 
00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:57.640 align:start position:0%
if you do have turnover uh how difficult
 
00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:00.280 align:start position:0%
it is it and General to train somebody
 
00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:03.640 align:start position:0%
up to be productive sure so the state
 
00:18:06.029 --> 00:18:06.039 align:start position:0%
state accounting the state system itself
 
00:18:09.909 --> 00:18:09.919 align:start position:0%
is fairly unique so um at at my finance
 
00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
director level um in in my time in this
 
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
role three plus years now um I've had
 
00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
one individual turnover there and that
 
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
was due to retirement she decided to
 
00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:24.200 align:start position:0%
retire um at the Financial Manager level
 
00:18:27.909 --> 00:18:27.919 align:start position:0%
we have Rel I mean overall a relatively
 
00:18:30.909 --> 00:18:30.919 align:start position:0%
low uh turnover rate at the lower levels
 
00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
particularly at the AP level where where
 
00:18:36.029 --> 00:18:36.039 align:start position:0%
it's a the salary and compensation is
 
00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
not um as generous we tend to see higher
 
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
turnover there but um we but overall
 
00:18:46.149 --> 00:18:46.159 align:start position:0%
relatively low it's about 11% vacancy
 
00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:49.480 align:start position:0%
rate um which is below the department
 
00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
average all right thank you of course
 
00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:55.240 align:start position:0%
represent no Alco yeah just quickly I
 
00:18:59.310 --> 00:18:59.320 align:start position:0%
missed the total actual headcount number
 
00:19:02.789 --> 00:19:02.799 align:start position:0%
um well um I think that's what you were
 
00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:05.000 align:start position:0%
asking is there if if you look at the
 
00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:11.720 align:start position:0%
1,41 you you you will see the total
 
00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
actual headcount uh right there at 157
 
00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:16.720 align:start position:0%
for the Governor's budget at the bottom
 
00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:25.909 --> 00:19:25.919 align:start position:0%
course okay thank you yep so turning the
 
00:19:27.789 --> 00:19:27.799 align:start position:0%
page to just some of the key
 
00:19:30.149 --> 00:19:30.159 align:start position:0%
accomplishments that we've seen um one
 
00:19:32.669 --> 00:19:32.679 align:start position:0%
really important piece that the team has
 
00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:34.360 align:start position:0%
been working on one really important
 
00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
initiative is um we had procured a
 
00:19:39.669 --> 00:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
business uh budget business intelligence
 
00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:41.240 align:start position:0%
tool back in
 
00:19:44.669 --> 00:19:44.679 align:start position:0%
2022 and the purpose of that is that
 
00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
historically we found that we did not
 
00:19:51.149 --> 00:19:51.159 align:start position:0%
have the data analysis available to
 
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
actively and quickly identify where the
 
00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:57.320 align:start position:0%
federal funds were being earned and so
 
00:19:59.230 --> 00:19:59.240 align:start position:0%
what what that led to was led to a
 
00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:01.720 align:start position:0%
number of years um and representative
 
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
walner you probably remember this you
 
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
know 5 six seven eight years ago where
 
00:20:09.029 --> 00:20:09.039 align:start position:0%
we had large amounts of federal revenue
 
00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
laps and the purpose of the system is to
 
00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:15.400 align:start position:0%
allow us to budget more actively and be
 
00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
able to track what the maintenance of
 
00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:20.840 align:start position:0%
expenditures is in real time and so if
 
00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
you look at the bullets there so the
 
00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:25.480 align:start position:0%
state fiscal year 24 general fund lapse
 
00:20:30.029 --> 00:20:30.039 align:start position:0%
was about 70% Less in in 4 than in 23
 
00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
and the federal and other Revenue lapse
 
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
was 88% less so I I think this the last
 
00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:37.240 align:start position:0%
bolt there is a really important one
 
00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:39.400 align:start position:0%
where the year prior we lapsed $45
 
00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:41.240 align:start position:0%
million of federal funds that we could
 
00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
have used to offset General funds had we
 
00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:47.200 align:start position:0%
budgeted more accurately but um and and
 
00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:49.000 align:start position:0%
then in 24 where we budgeted more
 
00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
accurately and we used the system we
 
00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
only lapsed $5 million of federal dollar
 
00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
of federal funds and so that that system
 
00:20:58.590 --> 00:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
is it does you know there is a price to
 
00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
to it it's a couple hundred, a year but
 
00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:03.720 align:start position:0%
the savings that's generated to offset
 
00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:05.480 align:start position:0%
general fund expenditures is really
 
00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
critical um Ernie uh J Jillian will be
 
00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:11.400 align:start position:0%
talking about this later on this was a
 
00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:13.320 align:start position:0%
prioritized need to keep that funded
 
00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:15.080 align:start position:0%
it's currently not funded in our budget
 
00:21:17.149 --> 00:21:17.159 align:start position:0%
that certainly gives me some concern and
 
00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
it's something that I'd want to
 
00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
highlight here the contracts team has
 
00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
been undergoing I I talked about this
 
00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
previously they've been undergoing U we
 
00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
we adopted a lean Six Sigma business
 
00:21:33.269 --> 00:21:33.279 align:start position:0%
methodology within within that team and
 
00:21:35.149 --> 00:21:35.159 align:start position:0%
we it it specifically it's a domic
 
00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
methodology where we Define the system
 
00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
we measure the system we constantly
 
00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:40.600 align:start position:0%
assess through vendor surveys and
 
00:21:42.669 --> 00:21:42.679 align:start position:0%
internal surveys then we improve and
 
00:21:45.029 --> 00:21:45.039 align:start position:0%
then we control for that and so we've
 
00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:46.840 align:start position:0%
continued to see pretty good pretty
 
00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:48.360 align:start position:0%
positive outcomes but what we've tried
 
00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
to do lately is work with um the
 
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
nonprofits in the community to provide
 
00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
training because you probably if you've
 
00:21:56.789 --> 00:21:56.799 align:start position:0%
talked to anyone that's done business
 
00:21:59.470 --> 00:21:59.480 align:start position:0%
with the state the procurement process
 
00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:01.240 align:start position:0%
and the GNC process it's a little
 
00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:03.400 align:start position:0%
foreign and so what we've tried to do
 
00:22:05.269 --> 00:22:05.279 align:start position:0%
there is provide training to our
 
00:22:08.029 --> 00:22:08.039 align:start position:0%
external vendors and nonprofits in the
 
00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:09.880 align:start position:0%
community to try to kind of lift the
 
00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
veil on what what you know what what are
 
00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:13.400 align:start position:0%
the constraints what are the problems
 
00:22:15.029 --> 00:22:15.039 align:start position:0%
we've tried to address those as well as
 
00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:17.480 align:start position:0%
some of the federal um help interpret
 
00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
some of the federal rules relative to
 
00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
indirect cost indirect cost is something
 
00:22:24.029 --> 00:22:24.039 align:start position:0%
that a contractor can claim to offset
 
00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
you know their general overhead and not
 
00:22:28.549 --> 00:22:28.559 align:start position:0%
everybody has done that consistently and
 
00:22:30.669 --> 00:22:30.679 align:start position:0%
we've heard um feedback from the
 
00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:31.960 align:start position:0%
community that that's a challenge for
 
00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:33.320 align:start position:0%
some so we've tried to address that
 
00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:35.720 align:start position:0%
through re through a couple of projects
 
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
via reaching out um we've also through
 
00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
just the resources that we've had put
 
00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
together a finance Academy where we've
 
00:22:46.789 --> 00:22:46.799 align:start position:0%
tried to document um and standardize the
 
00:22:49.149 --> 00:22:49.159 align:start position:0%
policies and procedures that the team
 
00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
follows we we utilize the the state uh
 
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
accounting system but there's always
 
00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:56.120 align:start position:0%
intricacies with any culture um that
 
00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
need to be documented so that when you
 
00:23:00.149 --> 00:23:00.159 align:start position:0%
do hire do on board it's a little bit
 
00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
more consistent as far as what folks are
 
00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:04.200 align:start position:0%
coming into and they also have recorded
 
00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
trainings that they can they can go back
 
00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
to to try to make things a little bit
 
00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
more effective efficient and lead to
 
00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
fewer uh mistakes whoopsies and
 
00:23:14.549 --> 00:23:14.559 align:start position:0%
otherwise so so you picked my interest
 
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
because you've talked about it systems
 
00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
twice with this business intelligence
 
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
tool and then uh in contracts you're
 
00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
migrating to a webbased application um
 
00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
are you are you able to tell us uh the
 
00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
names of the key it systems that you're
 
00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
using just so yes if we're talking about
 
00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
it in the future we're we're hearing
 
00:23:38.029 --> 00:23:38.039 align:start position:0%
each other yeah the the um budget
 
00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:40.600 align:start position:0%
business intelligence tool that is
 
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
Salesforce and the um the Excel based uh
 
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
data basically we brought cell to its
 
00:23:50.269 --> 00:23:50.279 align:start position:0%
Brink and broke it and we built our own
 
00:23:51.909 --> 00:23:51.919 align:start position:0%
um project management system and then we
 
00:23:53.669 --> 00:23:53.679 align:start position:0%
had to bring it back a little bit and we
 
00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
migrated that to uh smart sheets um
 
00:23:59.789 --> 00:23:59.799 align:start position:0%
contracts also relies during the
 
00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
pandemic we um quickly rolled out the
 
00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:05.400 align:start position:0%
docy sign e signature prior to that
 
00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
people used to drive around the state
 
00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
getting wet signatures um when I first
 
00:24:11.029 --> 00:24:11.039 align:start position:0%
started I was previously the contracts
 
00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:13.400 align:start position:0%
director kind of drove me crazy took us
 
00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:15.240 align:start position:0%
two weeks to get execution the record
 
00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
now I think is 27 minutes to get the
 
00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
vendor to sign DHHS to sign and the
 
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office to sign and is
 
00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:25.000 align:start position:0%
a docky sign function and smart sheet or
 
00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:27.320 align:start position:0%
where uh no it's it's it's separate
 
00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
completely different system um that is
 
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
also currently a PN that was not funded
 
00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
and I would uh you know certainly be
 
00:24:35.549 --> 00:24:35.559 align:start position:0%
concerned uh if that didn't go forward
 
00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:37.240 align:start position:0%
because it would negatively impact um
 
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
both our vendors and we have to find
 
00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:40.600 align:start position:0%
some kind of workaround solution is it
 
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
in the governor's budget it is not
 
00:24:43.389 --> 00:24:43.399 align:start position:0%
currently funded in the governor's
 
00:24:47.470 --> 00:24:47.480 align:start position:0%
budget okay so so highlight that for us
 
00:24:50.029 --> 00:24:50.039 align:start position:0%
because that sounds like one of the
 
00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
first really major productivity tools
 
00:24:55.269 --> 00:24:55.279 align:start position:0%
that I've heard in the it
 
00:24:59.110 --> 00:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
area yes that has um definitely
 
00:25:00.389 --> 00:25:00.399 align:start position:0%
accelerated the
 
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
processes okay another question
 
00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
represent so what does LMS stand for in
 
00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:08.840 align:start position:0%
the LMS platform is that life cycle
 
00:25:11.269 --> 00:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
management learning I I believe it
 
00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
believe it's learning management system
 
00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:16.840 align:start position:0%
learning management system yes um and uh
 
00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
maybe you'll get to this but maybe this
 
00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
is part of the business uh intelligence
 
00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
tool but you know the budget in this
 
00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
department has uh the general fund cost
 
00:25:28.909 --> 00:25:28.919 align:start position:0%
going down by 4 million and the amount
 
00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:32.440 align:start position:0%
of federal funds going up by 2 million
 
00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:36.440 align:start position:0%
so the percentage uh applicable of of
 
00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
you know this office function is really
 
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
dramatically changed and um um can you
 
00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:45.200 align:start position:0%
explain that and you know tell us how
 
00:25:49.389 --> 00:25:49.399 align:start position:0%
you did it and um there there's probably
 
00:25:51.029 --> 00:25:51.039 align:start position:0%
a there's probably a couple of things
 
00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:53.960 align:start position:0%
impacting that number one is just
 
00:25:55.669 --> 00:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
budgeting as accurately as possible
 
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
using leveraging that tool the second
 
00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
component there is when the um when
 
00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:05.320 align:start position:0%
looking at unfund the 394 positions
 
00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:07.320 align:start position:0%
General funds was a factor in that
 
00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:09.080 align:start position:0%
process and 18 positions have been
 
00:26:12.669 --> 00:26:12.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:18.440 align:start position:0%
unit so uh followup and so um you you
 
00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
know basically you have 4 million of
 
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
general fund savings within just this
 
00:26:26.269 --> 00:26:26.279 align:start position:0%
function and um and are you would you
 
00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
say that um you know part of the
 
00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:30.760 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs would be to keep the
 
00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
information systems available that made
 
00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:36.760 align:start position:0%
this possible yes and and um Ernie was
 
00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
going to address that later on in his
 
00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:40.760 align:start position:0%
presentation when he presents uh the
 
00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:42.520 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Information Services so we
 
00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:46.120 align:start position:0%
should dig back into those thank you so
 
00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:48.440 align:start position:0%
so do you I'm sorry representative PRI
 
00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:49.669 align:start position:0%
so do you I'm sorry representative PRI
go

00:26:49.669 --> 00:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:26:52.789 --> 00:26:52.799 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you uh Mr chairman and thank
 
00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:54.640 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question as a followup
 
00:26:57.950 --> 00:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
to a question that uh representative uh
 
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
Ed Edwards asked you what is that name
 
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
of the program for the doc sign that is
 
00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:06.640 align:start position:0%
not in the governor's budget and that we
 
00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:09.480 align:start position:0%
should be aware of and the amount of
 
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
money that is needed sure it it docus
 
00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
sign is is the program and we've uh
 
00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:19.480 align:start position:0%
rolled that out to a couple other areas
 
00:27:22.789 --> 00:27:22.799 align:start position:0%
in the department as well and I I I know
 
00:27:24.909 --> 00:27:24.919 align:start position:0%
that uh when when Ernie and Dave speak
 
00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
they can give you a little bit more
 
00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:28.360 align:start position:0%
detail and in that presentation we have
 
00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:29.919 align:start position:0%
the specific numbers that are
 
00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:31.240 align:start position:0%
highlighted in there so those will be
 
00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:34.760 align:start position:0%
coming today thank you okay so it sounds
 
00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
like you're you don't want to uh that
 
00:27:40.269 --> 00:27:40.279 align:start position:0%
you got it delegated to have the it
 
00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
discuss separate from your department
 
00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:47.320 align:start position:0%
which bugs me but but I get it um uh so
 
00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
so Mr weeders when we get to talking
 
00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:51.880 align:start position:0%
about Salesforce I'll be interested in
 
00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
knowing what's next you know given that
 
00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
we have Salesforce given that it's such
 
00:27:59.149 --> 00:27:59.159 align:start position:0%
a powerful tool what are your next
 
00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:01.480 align:start position:0%
adventures in increasing productivity as
 
00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:04.360 align:start position:0%
a result of using
 
00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
Salesforce all right and did you have a
 
00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:09.720 align:start position:0%
question yes a quick question on the
 
00:28:13.549 --> 00:28:13.559 align:start position:0%
lapse I know that uh in the past lapses
 
00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
have been been built into the budget
 
00:28:19.149 --> 00:28:19.159 align:start position:0%
with expected that that uh amount was
 
00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
going to lapse is that is that still a
 
00:28:25.509 --> 00:28:25.519 align:start position:0%
continuing process so when the yes when
 
00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
the LBA prepares um it it's its final
 
00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
analysis it shows the lapse as a
 
00:28:34.549 --> 00:28:34.559 align:start position:0%
percentage which typically ranges 3.6 4%
 
00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:37.880 align:start position:0%
in recent years okay thank you of course
 
00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:40.840 align:start position:0%
we're we're okay uh we can keep asking
 
00:28:43.549 --> 00:28:43.559 align:start position:0%
questions but we do have a fairly busy
 
00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:47.000 align:start position:0%
so so what please ask I understand that
 
00:28:51.149 --> 00:28:51.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman on uh 022 rents
 
00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
leases other than
 
00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:56.200 align:start position:0%
State could you explain the uh
 
00:28:58.750 --> 00:28:58.760 align:start position:0%
relatively increase
 
00:29:02.909 --> 00:29:02.919 align:start position:0%
of the request that you're making and
 
00:29:05.789 --> 00:29:05.799 align:start position:0%
and give me an explanation for that sure
 
00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:07.960 align:start position:0%
so um the department the Department
 
00:29:10.149 --> 00:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
administrative Services they administer
 
00:29:12.909 --> 00:29:12.919 align:start position:0%
all of the Statewide contracts um they
 
00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:15.080 align:start position:0%
repr procured a Statewide contract for
 
00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
copiers and we tack onto that contract
 
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh per RSA 21 by and um we've seen an
 
00:29:24.909 --> 00:29:24.919 align:start position:0%
increase in The copier leasing cost
 
00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:26.360 align:start position:0%
which is reflected
 
00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
there okay thank you that was an
 
00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:30.760 align:start position:0%
excellent question exactly the kind
 
00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:32.600 align:start position:0%
we're supposed to be asking today thank
 
00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
you thank you your your mic is on did
 
00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
you have another
 
00:29:40.669 --> 00:29:40.679 align:start position:0%
question okay all right um so give
 
00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:42.760 align:start position:0%
people just a moment I think you're
 
00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
about done on this section could just
 
00:29:48.149 --> 00:29:48.159 align:start position:0%
give give uh the members a moment to to
 
00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
look through this to see if they have
 
00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
any uh supplemental questions before we
 
00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:03.669 --> 00:30:03.679 align:start position:0%
representative nvan yeah I have a quick
 
00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
question and and sorry in looking at
 
00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
uh uh 103 line 103 so there's nothing in
 
00:30:15.269 --> 00:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 24 nothing in fiscal year 25
 
00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
but then money in uh 26 and 27 and I was
 
00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
noticing patterns throughout when I kind
 
00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
of thumb through this and I'm I'll
 
00:30:26.909 --> 00:30:26.919 align:start position:0%
apologize that I'm new at understanding
 
00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
um how uh how this budget uh detail
 
00:30:33.149 --> 00:30:33.159 align:start position:0%
works but I noticed a couple of places
 
00:30:34.549 --> 00:30:34.559 align:start position:0%
and there's an example of it where there
 
00:30:36.669 --> 00:30:36.679 align:start position:0%
was nothing in 23 24 and suddenly
 
00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:39.640 align:start position:0%
there's money in 24 and
 
00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:43.960 align:start position:0%
25 so maybe help me understand what's
 
00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:47.080 align:start position:0%
going on there sure so um I I'll I'll
 
00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
just highlight a couple of areas uh just
 
00:30:50.549 --> 00:30:50.559 align:start position:0%
to talk about the zeros so the
 
00:30:52.669 --> 00:30:52.679 align:start position:0%
additional fringe benefits in class 42
 
00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:55.000 align:start position:0%
you see it goes from 379 and the
 
00:30:56.549 --> 00:30:56.559 align:start position:0%
adjusted authorized in state fiscal year
 
00:30:59.470 --> 00:30:59.480 align:start position:0%
25 to Zer we centralized that so that's
 
00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
actually an accounting unit 5,000 now
 
00:31:04.669 --> 00:31:04.679 align:start position:0%
and then to your question on class 103
 
00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
going from 0 to 448 that represents the
 
00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
contract that we have uh with a provider
 
00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:12.760 align:start position:0%
for EBT cards and that that was
 
00:31:14.629 --> 00:31:14.639 align:start position:0%
previously budgeted elsewhere and we've
 
00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:17.200 align:start position:0%
moved that uh under under this
 
00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
accounting unit and that's why you see
 
00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:20.870 align:start position:0%
accounting unit and that's why you see
that

00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:23.669 --> 00:31:23.679 align:start position:0%
increase so a quick follow yeah go ahead
 
00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:25.960 align:start position:0%
so wherever wherever I see that kind of
 
00:31:29.549 --> 00:31:29.559 align:start position:0%
a pattern that reflects moving uh moving
 
00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:32.600 align:start position:0%
money from one one area to another or
 
00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
relabeling it may or it may not and I
 
00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
think that's one of the challenges and
 
00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
that's where like we need to have
 
00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
conversations because in some cases
 
00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
there could be a reduction in other
 
00:31:44.149 --> 00:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
cases there could be uh a contract has
 
00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:46.240 align:start position:0%
ended that we didn't repr procure in
 
00:31:47.789 --> 00:31:47.799 align:start position:0%
some cases it could be that we're moving
 
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
money over um or it may be something it
 
00:31:53.549 --> 00:31:53.559 align:start position:0%
could it could actually reflect a
 
00:31:55.029 --> 00:31:55.039 align:start position:0%
prioritized need that was funded in
 
00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
other cases so I think if you ever see
 
00:31:58.950 --> 00:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
something like that best to
 
00:32:00.909 --> 00:32:00.919 align:start position:0%
ask okay thank
 
00:32:05.149 --> 00:32:05.159 align:start position:0%
you so um I I just heard you say we
 
00:32:09.149 --> 00:32:09.159 align:start position:0%
moved EBT in in into this group and and
 
00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:11.240 align:start position:0%
I think for cost transparency that
 
00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't pass the common sense test but
 
00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:15.880 align:start position:0%
there must be a reason why you did that
 
00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:19.000 align:start position:0%
I would think EBD costs would be best
 
00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
associated with the kind of the food
 
00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:25.480 align:start position:0%
program area so that we can see total
 
00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:28.360 align:start position:0%
costs so the the individ ual that
 
00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
oversees the EBT program the contract
 
00:32:33.669 --> 00:32:33.679 align:start position:0%
itself that administers more of the
 
00:32:36.149 --> 00:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
technical Administration actually sits
 
00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
within finance and so this was
 
00:32:40.789 --> 00:32:40.799 align:start position:0%
previously budgeted in accounting unit
 
00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:43.360 align:start position:0%
6125 which is the Bureau of family
 
00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
assistance and the director's office and
 
00:32:47.629 --> 00:32:47.639 align:start position:0%
so we move that because the individual
 
00:32:49.509 --> 00:32:49.519 align:start position:0%
who is managing the dollars actually
 
00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:52.240 align:start position:0%
works within Finance they they obviously
 
00:32:54.789 --> 00:32:54.799 align:start position:0%
have close ties to the program but this
 
00:32:56.549 --> 00:32:56.559 align:start position:0%
is more of the general oversight of the
 
00:32:58.350 --> 00:32:58.360 align:start position:0%
cards and the administration
 
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
and working with um with the federal
 
00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
government on more of the technical
 
00:33:04.269 --> 00:33:04.279 align:start position:0%
issues okay but if we didn't have an e
 
00:33:09.029 --> 00:33:09.039 align:start position:0%
EBT program uh well okay I'll just leave
 
00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
you with that I it doesn't it doesn't
 
00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
make any sense to me because for the
 
00:33:15.549 --> 00:33:15.559 align:start position:0%
purposes of cost transparency it should
 
00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
to me be allocated in the functional
 
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
area so we can see the total cost of a
 
00:33:23.509 --> 00:33:23.519 align:start position:0%
of a program or a service but I I'm I'm
 
00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
not I'm not going to debate it I'm just
 
00:33:31.629 --> 00:33:31.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
any other questions on on the budget
 
00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:36.760 align:start position:0%
detail on pages 1,40 or
 
00:33:40.909 --> 00:33:40.919 align:start position:0%
1041 nope okay um the only other and I'm
 
00:33:43.149 --> 00:33:43.159 align:start position:0%
just being mindful of the time um I did
 
00:33:44.909 --> 00:33:44.919 align:start position:0%
include a couple of slides if you flip
 
00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:47.480 align:start position:0%
to page seven
 
00:33:51.149 --> 00:33:51.159 align:start position:0%
um you will see this is just some of the
 
00:33:53.509 --> 00:33:53.519 align:start position:0%
data that we've been tracking over time
 
00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
relative to the uh the efficiencies of
 
00:33:58.629 --> 00:33:58.639 align:start position:0%
the contracts team um and and you will
 
00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:01.960 align:start position:0%
slowly see that we are producing uh more
 
00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:04.120 align:start position:0%
contracts in a faster amount of time
 
00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
earlier than the in the year than we
 
00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:08.720 align:start position:0%
have in Prior years what we've also
 
00:34:11.349 --> 00:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
discovered as we've sort of formalized
 
00:34:14.349 --> 00:34:14.359 align:start position:0%
um the the system and tighten things up
 
00:34:15.629 --> 00:34:15.639 align:start position:0%
a little bit of you know we have
 
00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
identified other contracted needs that
 
00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:20.720 align:start position:0%
previously went unmet so that will also
 
00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:23.919 align:start position:0%
give give rise to that number there but
 
00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:25.919 align:start position:0%
overall um that's all I have for the
 
00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
division of finance and um um take any
 
00:34:30.109 --> 00:34:30.119 align:start position:0%
other questions on that otherwise we can
 
00:34:32.829 --> 00:34:32.839 align:start position:0%
move forward to EAP just just to
 
00:34:36.069 --> 00:34:36.079 align:start position:0%
compliment on on slide six I I know I
 
00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
know that since you've moved in there's
 
00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:40.040 align:start position:0%
been a tremendous amount of
 
00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
reorganization and Improvement in this
 
00:34:48.629 --> 00:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:53.149 --> 00:34:53.159 align:start position:0%
that right so if we want to move the
 
00:34:57.950 --> 00:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
next um presentation is on the employee
 
00:34:57.960 --> 00:34:59.430 align:start position:0%
next um presentation is on the employee
assistance

00:34:59.430 --> 00:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
program and I am joined here do you want
 
00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:04.200 align:start position:0%
to introduce
 
00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:06.069 align:start position:0%
to introduce
yourself

00:35:06.069 --> 00:35:06.079 align:start position:0%
yourself
 
00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
thank I'm Mike Lawless good morning I'm
 
00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
the director of the employee assistance
 
00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:13.400 align:start position:0%
program okay get us get us oriented I I
 
00:35:16.349 --> 00:35:16.359 align:start position:0%
see a a slide deck what what page of the
 
00:35:18.349 --> 00:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
briefing book are we in and where are we
 
00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
in the budget yes so if you turn to the
 
00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
budget book page 140 um we should should
 
00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:31.240 align:start position:0%
be close to there you will see
 
00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
accounting unit
 
00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
5025 yeah true so I see where it it's
 
00:35:40.069 --> 00:35:40.079 align:start position:0%
got estimated source of funds for the
 
00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:45.560 align:start position:0%
EAP and then it goes down to right
 
00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
above Health and Social
 
00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
Services yes and I apologize starts on
 
00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
1039 yeah thank you it starts on one on
 
00:35:57.950 --> 00:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
uh 1039
 
00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
yep and in the budget briefing
 
00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
book if you flip the budget briefing
 
00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
book to page uh two I believe yes on it
 
00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:09.160 align:start position:0%
begins on page two of the budget
 
00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:13.990 align:start position:0%
begins on page two of the budget
briefing

00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:21.589 --> 00:36:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
you so I appreciate your time and and
 
00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:25.880 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to speak a little bit
 
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:28.240 align:start position:0%
about the employee assistance program
 
00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:30.680 align:start position:0%
I brought some additional resources here
 
00:36:33.309 --> 00:36:33.319 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I can maybe pass them
 
00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
around if folks are curious but these I
 
00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
don't know that they're
 
00:36:39.349 --> 00:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
necessary presentation I could I could
 
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:41.200 align:start position:0%
speak to them a little bit and part of
 
00:36:44.309 --> 00:36:44.319 align:start position:0%
this is also within the presentation
 
00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:47.640 align:start position:0%
yeah um the material is around resources
 
00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
that we provide to individuals and also
 
00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh specific um resources for managers
 
00:36:57.630 --> 00:36:57.640 align:start position:0%
and so the EAP it began as a pilot
 
00:37:01.349 --> 00:37:01.359 align:start position:0%
program serving 900 state employees in
 
00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
1985 and has grown through the years to
 
00:37:07.589 --> 00:37:07.599 align:start position:0%
support all departments and uh also
 
00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:09.560 align:start position:0%
state employees family
 
00:37:11.950 --> 00:37:11.960 align:start position:0%
members some of the information uh
 
00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
around the program are around the
 
00:37:16.349 --> 00:37:16.359 align:start position:0%
confidentiality of the program different
 
00:37:19.069 --> 00:37:19.079 align:start position:0%
uh resources that we connect with folks
 
00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
connect folks to either internally or
 
00:37:23.349 --> 00:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
externally and some of the ways that we
 
00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
can be supportive to not only
 
00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
individuals and their family members but
 
00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:28.150 align:start position:0%
individuals and their family members but
managers

00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
managers
 
00:37:31.309 --> 00:37:31.319 align:start position:0%
work groups um at the policy level at
 
00:37:34.309 --> 00:37:34.319 align:start position:0%
the individual level so so is it fair to
 
00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:36.920 align:start position:0%
say that um kind of a quick summary of
 
00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
this is that you have a total of seven
 
00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:42.760 align:start position:0%
positions and you're serving all of the
 
00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:47.960 align:start position:0%
uh state government yes sir okay um and
 
00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
H has there been a change in the last
 
00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
few years to the number of
 
00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
positions I because I remember 14 for
 
00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
some reason I don't know why I would
 
00:37:59.430 --> 00:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
remember that
 
00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:01.480 align:start position:0%
I've been in the director's role for two
 
00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
years now and uh I started with the
 
00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:05.960 align:start position:0%
program in 2015 I think the only
 
00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:07.880 align:start position:0%
adjustment was there was a position
 
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
added and I would say that may have been
 
00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
four years ago and you received revenues
 
00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
from other depart uh other U functions
 
00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
of the state to help pay for the EAP yes
 
00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
sir I don't know okay all
 
00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
right go ahead I'm sorry I just that
 
00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
that's that's sort of my bottom line in
 
00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
this your your service the entire State
 
00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
you're getting revenue from them for
 
00:38:33.349 --> 00:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
providing a service and you're doing it
 
00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:35.800 align:start position:0%
with a what feels to me for the number
 
00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:36.920 align:start position:0%
of people
 
00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
serviced a relatively lean
 
00:38:43.069 --> 00:38:43.079 align:start position:0%
staff do you want to argue with any that
 
00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
no no no um we're passionate about the
 
00:38:49.950 --> 00:38:49.960 align:start position:0%
work we do and uh you know when I think
 
00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
about some of the experiences over the
 
00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
last year you know some of the resources
 
00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:55.240 align:start position:0%
as we kind of named our key
 
00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:57.200 align:start position:0%
accomplishments is that we've increased
 
00:38:59.829 --> 00:38:59.839 align:start position:0%
our satellite hours with two of the 247
 
00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:02.200 align:start position:0%
facilities where we are available on
 
00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
site uh a couple hours a week for
 
00:39:05.870 --> 00:39:05.880 align:start position:0%
employees to kind of meet us in their
 
00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:10.280 align:start position:0%
own workspace yeah and I think you know
 
00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
just to be brief that that experience uh
 
00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:15.440 align:start position:0%
was very instrumental and employees
 
00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:18.040 align:start position:0%
feeling comfortable accessing Us in
 
00:39:20.309 --> 00:39:20.319 align:start position:0%
particular crisis moments so I assume
 
00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:22.280 align:start position:0%
that you have some kind of a metric that
 
00:39:25.829 --> 00:39:25.839 align:start position:0%
you manage as as a director you have the
 
00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
number of clients that you can
 
00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:29.720 align:start position:0%
potentially serve divided by the number
 
00:39:33.150 --> 00:39:33.160 align:start position:0%
of people to have a a metric on the
 
00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:36.280 align:start position:0%
number of people serve per counselor you
 
00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
probably have that we we we need to be
 
00:39:40.309 --> 00:39:40.319 align:start position:0%
flexible around that because the nature
 
00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:43.400 align:start position:0%
of the work is there can be uh sudden uh
 
00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
events that occur that we all have to
 
00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
kind of come together and be flexible
 
00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
you have a base a base metric like that
 
00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
I assume and and so we probably saw an
 
00:39:58.030 --> 00:39:58.040 align:start position:0%
increase in the number of the volume of
 
00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
requested Services yes during the
 
00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:03.839 align:start position:0%
pandemic yes did you are you keeping
 
00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
that metric too so that we can see post
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
pandemic what the demand is on the
 
00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:12.680 align:start position:0%
services I I assume they're in a in a
 
00:40:15.069 --> 00:40:15.079 align:start position:0%
decline do you have statistics in here
 
00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:16.720 align:start position:0%
that they're not they're not in a
 
00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
decline where there was a shift was that
 
00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
the resources shifted during the
 
00:40:24.349 --> 00:40:24.359 align:start position:0%
pandemic particularly in the early part
 
00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
from face-to-face Services yeah and
 
00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:28.349 align:start position:0%
from face-to-face Services yeah and
training

00:40:28.349 --> 00:40:28.359 align:start position:0%
training
 
00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
uh but as a matter of fact the
 
00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
complexity of the needs that folks have
 
00:40:35.109 --> 00:40:35.119 align:start position:0%
are now in multiple areas where prior to
 
00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
the pandemic they were kind of unique or
 
00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
individual kinds of experiences okay so
 
00:40:42.270 --> 00:40:42.280 align:start position:0%
in previous sessions we've tried to get
 
00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
to to the informational aspects of the
 
00:40:46.829 --> 00:40:46.839 align:start position:0%
department and what we're really after
 
00:40:49.589 --> 00:40:49.599 align:start position:0%
in in these budget sessions yes is the
 
00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:51.880 align:start position:0%
is your performance metrics okay what
 
00:40:54.589 --> 00:40:54.599 align:start position:0%
what what kind of volume are we doing
 
00:40:56.750 --> 00:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
what are we projecting for future volume
 
00:40:59.190 --> 00:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
what's been the historical Trend we we
 
00:41:01.829 --> 00:41:01.839 align:start position:0%
kind of need to know that sort of
 
00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
performance metric Behavior so that we
 
00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
can determine you know how how we're
 
00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
doing so if the resources allocated are
 
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the function no I I can
 
00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:15.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate that what I what I would say
 
00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:18.280 align:start position:0%
around kind of the shift is we have and
 
00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:21.560 align:start position:0%
I spoke about this at the last session
 
00:41:23.309 --> 00:41:23.319 align:start position:0%
uh we we're moving towards a data
 
00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
management system and we recently
 
00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:27.720 align:start position:0%
adopted that which will allow us to
 
00:41:30.349 --> 00:41:30.359 align:start position:0%
predict Trends and kind of more of a
 
00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
proactive approach we began utilizing
 
00:41:34.309 --> 00:41:34.319 align:start position:0%
that to capture trainings and
 
00:41:36.589 --> 00:41:36.599 align:start position:0%
orientations and things of that nature
 
00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
in September and individual client in
 
00:41:42.430 --> 00:41:42.440 align:start position:0%
July and individual client information
 
00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
in September and so for the last
 
00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:45.880 align:start position:0%
calendar year I can share some
 
00:41:48.349 --> 00:41:48.359 align:start position:0%
information around uh Services provided
 
00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
if if that would be
 
00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
helpful uh in terms of numbers served
 
00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:55.000 align:start position:0%
okay that would that would be great
 
00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
performance metrics that's that's the
 
00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.390 align:start position:0%
performance metrics that's that's the
code

00:41:58.390 --> 00:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
code
 
00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:01.000 align:start position:0%
so uh in the last calendar year we have
 
00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:04.640 align:start position:0%
met with 750 individual clients or kind
 
00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
of new
 
00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
cases we have provided satellite office
 
00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:15.880 align:start position:0%
hours to 2 247 facilities on
 
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
105 uh days over that year span so two
 
00:42:21.630 --> 00:42:21.640 align:start position:0%
days a week we're there for two hours at
 
00:42:24.069 --> 00:42:24.079 align:start position:0%
each location so that's 210 manh hours
 
00:42:28.349 --> 00:42:28.359 align:start position:0%
by take multiplying it by two sites
 
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
that sounds right to me
 
00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
yes uh 60 plus trainings that could have
 
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
been anywhere from one hour to four to
 
00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
six hours on various topics uh not only
 
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
from a kind of a critical incident
 
00:42:43.549 --> 00:42:43.559 align:start position:0%
response metric but part of the
 
00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
evolution of the program is to uh lean
 
00:42:48.349 --> 00:42:48.359 align:start position:0%
into the preventative and kind of
 
00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
resiliency protective factors so 60 plus
 
00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:53.800 align:start position:0%
trainings anywhere from 1 hour to 6
 
00:42:56.109 --> 00:42:56.119 align:start position:0%
hours and
 
00:43:00.750 --> 00:43:00.760 align:start position:0%
um 97 orientations which is either new
 
00:43:02.910 --> 00:43:02.920 align:start position:0%
client orientations where we are there
 
00:43:05.710 --> 00:43:05.720 align:start position:0%
presenting information or orientations
 
00:43:07.549 --> 00:43:07.559 align:start position:0%
for managers and that's one of these
 
00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
guides here around uh the unique
 
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
resources that are available for
 
00:43:15.150 --> 00:43:15.160 align:start position:0%
managers or supervisors that we
 
00:43:17.710 --> 00:43:17.720 align:start position:0%
offer okay
 
00:43:20.549 --> 00:43:20.559 align:start position:0%
um this this is helpful being able to
 
00:43:23.349 --> 00:43:23.359 align:start position:0%
see a trend and a projection would be
 
00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:25.720 align:start position:0%
make this even more helpful I project I
 
00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
I mean the projections moving forward
 
00:43:29.589 --> 00:43:29.599 align:start position:0%
forward are that when we have a year two
 
00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
years worth of data in the new data
 
00:43:32.829 --> 00:43:32.839 align:start position:0%
management system we're not only going
 
00:43:34.349 --> 00:43:34.359 align:start position:0%
to be able to see Trends but we're going
 
00:43:36.349 --> 00:43:36.359 align:start position:0%
to be able to quantify the service
 
00:43:39.069 --> 00:43:39.079 align:start position:0%
delivery models in much more articulated
 
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
ways than we've been able to with a
 
00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
paper and Pen model do do you have a um
 
00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
not and since we don't have a
 
00:43:47.829 --> 00:43:47.839 align:start position:0%
quantitative projection do you have a
 
00:43:49.589 --> 00:43:49.599 align:start position:0%
qualitative one do you have your own
 
00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
prediction of what the next budget looks
 
00:43:53.829 --> 00:43:53.839 align:start position:0%
like in terms of
 
00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
demand I wouldn't I wouldn't want to uh
 
00:43:59.549 --> 00:43:59.559 align:start position:0%
get a number without more thought there
 
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
that's fair do you have a question yeah
 
00:44:05.230 --> 00:44:05.240 align:start position:0%
representative Neno um I have a very
 
00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
quick question on page five uh and
 
00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
that's what what is the definition of
 
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
peer support
 
00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:16.160 align:start position:0%
groups yes thank you uh so so the peer
 
00:44:17.950 --> 00:44:17.960 align:start position:0%
support model that we are supportive
 
00:44:19.710 --> 00:44:19.720 align:start position:0%
around is uh there are a number of
 
00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:21.960 align:start position:0%
different departments within the state
 
00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:24.760 align:start position:0%
that recognize the need of being you
 
00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:28.720 align:start position:0%
know uh being available or or employees
 
00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:30.040 align:start position:0%
want to be supportive of their
 
00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:31.720 align:start position:0%
colleagues because of a shared work
 
00:44:33.910 --> 00:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
experience so for example law
 
00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:36.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement's experience is may be very
 
00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
different than other departments and so
 
00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
they recognize their's value in a peer
 
00:44:42.349 --> 00:44:42.359 align:start position:0%
support model uh and and in these
 
00:44:44.950 --> 00:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
specific agencies the the challenges
 
00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
that they deal with the events that they
 
00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:48.200 align:start position:0%
deal with are very different from one
 
00:44:50.349 --> 00:44:50.359 align:start position:0%
Department to the next and so we have
 
00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
been instrumental and supporting
 
00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:53.640 align:start position:0%
multiple de departments develop their
 
00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
own peer support agency but also be a
 
00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
resource for the peer supporters when
 
00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
they are receiving uh information that's
 
00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
beyond their scope and also to intervene
 
00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
to support employees they might be
 
00:45:09.069 --> 00:45:09.079 align:start position:0%
crossing paths with when the material is
 
00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
at a higher level than say a a peer
 
00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
support may be kind of qualified to be
 
00:45:17.470 --> 00:45:17.480 align:start position:0%
available around just a quick followup f
 
00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
is that um uh like an employee affinity
 
00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
group I think that's a that's one way of
 
00:45:24.990 --> 00:45:25.000 align:start position:0%
uh kind of describing it but there's
 
00:45:27.790 --> 00:45:27.800 align:start position:0%
also training that happens there so it's
 
00:45:30.069 --> 00:45:30.079 align:start position:0%
not just um you know people kind of
 
00:45:32.349 --> 00:45:32.359 align:start position:0%
volunteering out of out of you know say
 
00:45:33.589 --> 00:45:33.599 align:start position:0%
the goodness of their heart they have
 
00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
some level of uh knowledge around trauma
 
00:45:37.829 --> 00:45:37.839 align:start position:0%
or depending on what the unique
 
00:45:39.589 --> 00:45:39.599 align:start position:0%
experiences of that work group might be
 
00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:41.800 align:start position:0%
they may get a different kind of
 
00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:44.920 align:start position:0%
training and we are not we are not the
 
00:45:47.390 --> 00:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
ones who are providing that training uh
 
00:45:50.430 --> 00:45:50.440 align:start position:0%
alone you know so for instance um State
 
00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:52.520 align:start position:0%
Police has a peer support model and it
 
00:45:55.270 --> 00:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
is modeled that after other states who
 
00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
also have a similar model and do a lot
 
00:45:59.309 --> 00:45:59.319 align:start position:0%
of that work internally but we are kind
 
00:46:01.870 --> 00:46:01.880 align:start position:0%
of there as an ancillary support and
 
00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:03.720 align:start position:0%
resource okay thank you thank you for
 
00:46:07.549 --> 00:46:07.559 align:start position:0%
the response so so I have questions on
 
00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
leveraging technology for productivity
 
00:46:14.109 --> 00:46:14.119 align:start position:0%
are are you uh using any form of uh like
 
00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
tele medicine to make yourselves more
 
00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:18.760 align:start position:0%
accessible without
 
00:46:21.470 --> 00:46:21.480 align:start position:0%
transportation we uh adapted to that
 
00:46:24.589 --> 00:46:24.599 align:start position:0%
model uh during covid where we had to be
 
00:46:26.349 --> 00:46:26.359 align:start position:0%
flexible around meeting people who
 
00:46:27.790 --> 00:46:27.800 align:start position:0%
couldn't or wouldn't want to meet in
 
00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
person and so that's certainly still a
 
00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:32.720 align:start position:0%
model that we've used at the employees
 
00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:36.040 align:start position:0%
request we we are available to uh All
 
00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
State departments across the state and
 
00:46:39.870 --> 00:46:39.880 align:start position:0%
certainly travel and meet folks where
 
00:46:41.829 --> 00:46:41.839 align:start position:0%
they are but some folks whether it's
 
00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
making a call during their lunch break
 
00:46:46.510 --> 00:46:46.520 align:start position:0%
or wanting to meet face to face uh have
 
00:46:48.549 --> 00:46:48.559 align:start position:0%
that option as well so I imagine
 
00:46:50.710 --> 00:46:50.720 align:start position:0%
employees know that tele medicine is an
 
00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:52.760 align:start position:0%
option absolutely when we do our
 
00:46:54.910 --> 00:46:54.920 align:start position:0%
orientations or anywhere we're marketing
 
00:46:56.549 --> 00:46:56.559 align:start position:0%
we're sharing the diverse ways that we
 
00:46:59.390 --> 00:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
support folks and and then uh have you
 
00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
placed any um training modules or
 
00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
information modules on the States's
 
00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
LMS we're in the process of uh
 
00:47:11.829 --> 00:47:11.839 align:start position:0%
collaborating on a Model I'm not sure if
 
00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
we I'd have to look back at some of my
 
00:47:16.910 --> 00:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
research I know we often do partner with
 
00:47:20.349 --> 00:47:20.359 align:start position:0%
internal a um say odts to provide
 
00:47:22.270 --> 00:47:22.280 align:start position:0%
information and and so there may be some
 
00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
material that are that's there right
 
00:47:27.069 --> 00:47:27.079 align:start position:0%
because I'm just looking at this uh new
 
00:47:29.549 --> 00:47:29.559 align:start position:0%
orientations for as an example and then
 
00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
you got the 60 plus trainings I'm if it
 
00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:34.720 align:start position:0%
feels like there should be a subset that
 
00:47:37.589 --> 00:47:37.599 align:start position:0%
could go on LMS to enhance productivity
 
00:47:40.309 --> 00:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
but but that's just a comment for you to
 
00:47:43.870 --> 00:47:43.880 align:start position:0%
think about U uh and then I I I want to
 
00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:46.280 align:start position:0%
know about surge you you started to talk
 
00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
about if you had a spike for some reason
 
00:47:52.549 --> 00:47:52.559 align:start position:0%
in cases that you needed to deal with
 
00:47:54.750 --> 00:47:54.760 align:start position:0%
what what's your surge contingency do
 
00:47:57.150 --> 00:47:57.160 align:start position:0%
you have subcontracts with anyone to to
 
00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
to provide an expansion we do not have
 
00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
subcontracts uh when I think about you
 
00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
know this idea of a surge maybe or kind
 
00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
of unanticipated event what comes to
 
00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
mind is the response to uh the active
 
00:48:12.190 --> 00:48:12.200 align:start position:0%
shooter event with New Hampshire
 
00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
hospital and so uh we were we were one
 
00:48:16.829 --> 00:48:16.839 align:start position:0%
of the groups being supportive of
 
00:48:19.589 --> 00:48:19.599 align:start position:0%
employees in my estimation the fact that
 
00:48:21.349 --> 00:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
we're available for satellite hours
 
00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
there made us a a a nice option for
 
00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
folks because they were familiar with us
 
00:48:30.069 --> 00:48:30.079 align:start position:0%
but to your original question uh those
 
00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:32.720 align:start position:0%
kinds of experiences have allowed us to
 
00:48:34.990 --> 00:48:35.000 align:start position:0%
uh build Partnerships and relationships
 
00:48:36.430 --> 00:48:36.440 align:start position:0%
so that when there are these
 
00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
unanticipated events we can connect with
 
00:48:40.549 --> 00:48:40.559 align:start position:0%
folks who are so did you see a big spike
 
00:48:45.349 --> 00:48:45.359 align:start position:0%
in EAP requests uh in the aftermath of
 
00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
that shooting at the New Hampshire
 
00:48:51.190 --> 00:48:51.200 align:start position:0%
hospital yes I mean from from multiple
 
00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
departments on you know so we we were
 
00:48:55.710 --> 00:48:55.720 align:start position:0%
part of the response team to support
 
00:48:57.750 --> 00:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
employees who were experiencing that
 
00:48:59.390 --> 00:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
directly but there's multiple
 
00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
departments on those State grounds that
 
00:49:02.910 --> 00:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
were also uncertain and we hold that
 
00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:04.280 align:start position:0%
information confidentially and
 
00:49:06.789 --> 00:49:06.799 align:start position:0%
responding supporting them as well uh
 
00:49:06.799 --> 00:49:08.190 align:start position:0%
responding supporting them as well uh
representative

00:49:08.190 --> 00:49:08.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:49:10.670 --> 00:49:10.680 align:start position:0%
priest thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:49:13.349 --> 00:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um this is
 
00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
regarding kind of a continuation of what
 
00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
um representative Edwards uh said asked
 
00:49:24.309 --> 00:49:24.319 align:start position:0%
you about the contingency fund um I'm
 
00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
very interested if whether whether or
 
00:49:31.870 --> 00:49:31.880 align:start position:0%
not the the department and especially
 
00:49:34.990 --> 00:49:35.000 align:start position:0%
your division has
 
00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:45.069 --> 00:49:45.079 align:start position:0%
pandemic happening and what's going to
 
00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:47.160 align:start position:0%
happen if that
 
00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
occurs um ju just to clarify
 
00:49:53.150 --> 00:49:53.160 align:start position:0%
representative priest um contingency
 
00:49:55.230 --> 00:49:55.240 align:start position:0%
fund for what
 
00:49:59.470 --> 00:49:59.480 align:start position:0%
purpose to cover the overtime the
 
00:50:02.549 --> 00:50:02.559 align:start position:0%
additional staff needed to do your
 
00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
purposes sure no the the department does
 
00:50:08.910 --> 00:50:08.920 align:start position:0%
not have any specific contingency fund
 
00:50:10.829 --> 00:50:10.839 align:start position:0%
for those purposes typically how we
 
00:50:13.589 --> 00:50:13.599 align:start position:0%
would handle that if we did see an
 
00:50:16.349 --> 00:50:16.359 align:start position:0%
excessive increase in overtime we would
 
00:50:19.630 --> 00:50:19.640 align:start position:0%
seek to transfer uh the funds from some
 
00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
other vacancy or contract that may be
 
00:50:25.470 --> 00:50:25.480 align:start position:0%
UND spent or something to that effect um
 
00:50:26.829 --> 00:50:26.839 align:start position:0%
and that kind of hearkens back to the
 
00:50:29.150 --> 00:50:29.160 align:start position:0%
hb2 provision I was speaking to
 
00:50:30.910 --> 00:50:30.920 align:start position:0%
yesterday relative to the ability to
 
00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
transfer out of personnel lines that's
 
00:50:34.390 --> 00:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
just an example of really where it's
 
00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:36.640 align:start position:0%
really important for us to do that there
 
00:50:40.150 --> 00:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
is a Statewide fund that other agencies
 
00:50:42.750 --> 00:50:42.760 align:start position:0%
pay into that that could potentially
 
00:50:45.829 --> 00:50:45.839 align:start position:0%
assist in those instances but HHS does
 
00:50:48.069 --> 00:50:48.079 align:start position:0%
not pay into that historically because
 
00:50:50.670 --> 00:50:50.680 align:start position:0%
we have that flexibility so when we do
 
00:50:52.510 --> 00:50:52.520 align:start position:0%
have for example like an employee
 
00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
retires after 45 years and they were a
 
00:50:57.270 --> 00:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
really high paid employee like when we
 
00:50:58.870 --> 00:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
have to pay out tens of thousands of
 
00:51:00.589 --> 00:51:00.599 align:start position:0%
dollars we have to find that money
 
00:51:01.990 --> 00:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
within our budget if there was an
 
00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
emergency we'd have to do the same thing
 
00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:08.069 align:start position:0%
emergency we'd have to do the same thing
thank

00:51:08.069 --> 00:51:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
you uh back back to the kind of the
 
00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
standard ones what what what's your
 
00:51:16.750 --> 00:51:16.760 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate what's your what are your
 
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
issues relative to replacing somebody is
 
00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
that a short spin up or is that a long
 
00:51:24.190 --> 00:51:24.200 align:start position:0%
one and I guess in this case I'd like to
 
00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
know what the general uh uh credential
 
00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
background is for counselor
 
00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
M yeah so currently we do not have any
 
00:51:37.549 --> 00:51:37.559 align:start position:0%
vacancies um and the the kind of
 
00:51:39.870 --> 00:51:39.880 align:start position:0%
onboarding experience you know when I
 
00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:42.640 align:start position:0%
started with the EAP in 2015 my
 
00:51:44.670 --> 00:51:44.680 align:start position:0%
predecessor used to say it takes about
 
00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
three years to learn the job and um I
 
00:51:50.430 --> 00:51:50.440 align:start position:0%
don't know if I would say it takes that
 
00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
long but I think that there's a learning
 
00:51:54.270 --> 00:51:54.280 align:start position:0%
curve regardless of what your background
 
00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
is if you if you have a behavioral
 
00:51:59.190 --> 00:51:59.200 align:start position:0%
health back ground that certainly can uh
 
00:52:01.390 --> 00:52:01.400 align:start position:0%
support the onb boarding process with
 
00:52:03.990 --> 00:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
certain aspects of the the position but
 
00:52:06.030 --> 00:52:06.040 align:start position:0%
the position is also very complex in
 
00:52:08.430 --> 00:52:08.440 align:start position:0%
terms of dealing with all departments
 
00:52:10.789 --> 00:52:10.799 align:start position:0%
different cultures for every agency sure
 
00:52:12.589 --> 00:52:12.599 align:start position:0%
so you don't you don't have like an RN
 
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
or behavioral specialist in their job
 
00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
requirements and your job description we
 
00:52:18.990 --> 00:52:19.000 align:start position:0%
don't I mean it it it used to be
 
00:52:20.589 --> 00:52:20.599 align:start position:0%
Master's level only positions but
 
00:52:22.870 --> 00:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
there's been some uh flexibility around
 
00:52:25.309 --> 00:52:25.319 align:start position:0%
uh experience in
 
00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:28.240 align:start position:0%
education okay okay i' I'd be curious in
 
00:52:29.789 --> 00:52:29.799 align:start position:0%
in seeing that if you could just shoot
 
00:52:32.309 --> 00:52:32.319 align:start position:0%
me the standard the job description
 
00:52:35.430 --> 00:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
please yes okay I'm I'm I'm good
 
00:52:37.789 --> 00:52:37.799 align:start position:0%
represent Wallen did you have anything
 
00:52:41.549 --> 00:52:41.559 align:start position:0%

members of the committee my name is
 
00:54:07.270 --> 00:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
David weers I'm the Chief Operating
 
00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
Officer for DHHS and I am here instead
 
00:54:13.789 --> 00:54:13.799 align:start position:0%
of our HR Director as she is retiring at
 
00:54:15.589 --> 00:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
the end of the month and I gave her the
 
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
day off um from this presentation I
 
00:54:20.069 --> 00:54:20.079 align:start position:0%
didn't run her off with this budget
 
00:54:23.789 --> 00:54:23.799 align:start position:0%
stuff did I I don't believe so all right
 
00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to skip to slide three um
 
00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
and I'll talk a little bit about our
 
00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
mission as we go through but as the
 
00:54:33.190 --> 00:54:33.200 align:start position:0%
human resources Bureau for the
 
00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
Department we provide services across
 
00:54:38.829 --> 00:54:38.839 align:start position:0%
all the 247 facilities as well as all of
 
00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
the divisions for the department and
 
00:54:44.789 --> 00:54:44.799 align:start position:0%
we're broken up into five different
 
00:54:47.069 --> 00:54:47.079 align:start position:0%
specific areas uh the first one you'll
 
00:54:49.470 --> 00:54:49.480 align:start position:0%
see is really managing our payroll and
 
00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:52.640 align:start position:0%
benefits and in there we're we're really
 
00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
focused on as everyone is sees it as
 
00:54:58.109 --> 00:54:58.119 align:start position:0%
important is paying people in a timely
 
00:55:01.150 --> 00:55:01.160 align:start position:0%
manner and accurately so that would be
 
00:55:03.069 --> 00:55:03.079 align:start position:0%
one of the main components of that job
 
00:55:05.230 --> 00:55:05.240 align:start position:0%
Duty as well as compliance with state
 
00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
and federal laws and Personnel rules we
 
00:55:10.470 --> 00:55:10.480 align:start position:0%
work with and partner with um Department
 
00:55:12.910 --> 00:55:12.920 align:start position:0%
of administrative services for that work
 
00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
and utilizing the the New Hampshire
 
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
first enterprise resource planning tool
 
00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
for all of our
 
00:55:21.230 --> 00:55:21.240 align:start position:0%
transactions and then we also partner
 
00:55:22.630 --> 00:55:22.640 align:start position:0%
with the union and the collective
 
00:55:25.630 --> 00:55:25.640 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement that really puts
 
00:55:27.870 --> 00:55:27.880 align:start position:0%
around all those rules and guidelines
 
00:55:31.029 --> 00:55:31.039 align:start position:0%
for payroll and benefits and then moving
 
00:55:34.109 --> 00:55:34.119 align:start position:0%
into and just as a comment um because
 
00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
our predecessors talked about people in
 
00:55:38.789 --> 00:55:38.799 align:start position:0%
the different areas we have 10 people
 
00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
working in payroll and benefits and then
 
00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
moving into workforce management we have
 
00:55:45.990 --> 00:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
three people working there and that's
 
00:55:48.349 --> 00:55:48.359 align:start position:0%
really focusing on developing and
 
00:55:50.750 --> 00:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
maintaining the workforce and ensuring
 
00:55:55.349 --> 00:55:55.359 align:start position:0%
that they have the necessary tools to
 
00:55:57.990 --> 00:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
meet their jobs um you'll probably hear
 
00:56:00.270 --> 00:56:00.280 align:start position:0%
terms like supplemental job descriptions
 
00:56:01.829 --> 00:56:01.839 align:start position:0%
making sure that they have their job
 
00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
description and their objectives
 
00:56:06.190 --> 00:56:06.200 align:start position:0%
identified and then working on
 
00:56:08.470 --> 00:56:08.480 align:start position:0%
Innovative creative and Sustainable
 
00:56:10.630 --> 00:56:10.640 align:start position:0%
Solutions to really move forward so this
 
00:56:13.549 --> 00:56:13.559 align:start position:0%
group um in partnership with again
 
00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
administrative Services is working on
 
00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:16.270 align:start position:0%
administrative Services is working on
the

00:56:16.270 --> 00:56:16.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
reclassifications of all of the
 
00:56:20.549 --> 00:56:20.559 align:start position:0%
positions across the state um in our
 
00:56:24.309 --> 00:56:24.319 align:start position:0%
specific area across HR across
 
00:56:27.390 --> 00:56:27.400 align:start position:0%
DHHS and the employee relations and
 
00:56:29.430 --> 00:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
engagement we have again three people
 
00:56:33.150 --> 00:56:33.160 align:start position:0%
working in there uh right now we have a
 
00:56:35.950 --> 00:56:35.960 align:start position:0%
the whole Workforce is out and so we
 
00:56:37.990 --> 00:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
have one person that resigned so that
 
00:56:40.029 --> 00:56:40.039 align:start position:0%
one's vacant another one that is out on
 
00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
medical leave and the third one actually
 
00:56:45.069 --> 00:56:45.079 align:start position:0%
we do have a third Tech that is working
 
00:56:48.230 --> 00:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
in there so we're operating at 2/3 down
 
00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:50.480 align:start position:0%
in that group and that that group
 
00:56:52.710 --> 00:56:52.720 align:start position:0%
focuses on Ada
 
00:56:54.829 --> 00:56:54.839 align:start position:0%
management as well as any type of
 
00:56:57.789 --> 00:56:57.799 align:start position:0%
employee relations question so anytime
 
00:57:01.069 --> 00:57:01.079 align:start position:0%
someone calls up and has an issue with
 
00:57:02.990 --> 00:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
what's going on with their supervisor or
 
00:57:04.829 --> 00:57:04.839 align:start position:0%
the supervisor having challenges with
 
00:57:07.789 --> 00:57:07.799 align:start position:0%
their staff they provide that
 
00:57:11.390 --> 00:57:11.400 align:start position:0%
support oh sorry I just heard an Echo
 
00:57:15.630 --> 00:57:15.640 align:start position:0%

four we have our organizational
 
00:57:19.829 --> 00:57:19.839 align:start position:0%

00:57:24.349 --> 00:57:24.359 align:start position:0%
training line in that training line
 
00:57:26.670 --> 00:57:26.680 align:start position:0%
budget we have five people that work
 
00:57:28.109 --> 00:57:28.119 align:start position:0%

training and then professional
 
00:57:37.470 --> 00:57:37.480 align:start position:0%
development opportunities like you heard
 
00:57:40.950 --> 00:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
from Mike Lawless regarding um EAP
 
00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
supporting um other divisions like that
 
00:57:47.710 --> 00:57:47.720 align:start position:0%

employee oh sorry EAP employee
 
00:57:52.990 --> 00:57:53.000 align:start position:0%
assistance program so I'm trying not to
 
00:57:56.190 --> 00:57:56.200 align:start position:0%
use my three-letter acronyms or tlas so
 
00:57:58.109 --> 00:57:58.119 align:start position:0%
Nathan will keep me honest on
 
00:57:58.119 --> 00:57:59.710 align:start position:0%
Nathan will keep me honest on
those

00:57:59.710 --> 00:57:59.720 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:58:03.029 --> 00:58:03.039 align:start position:0%
um and then in our final area within the
 
00:58:05.230 --> 00:58:05.240 align:start position:0%
bureau we have our talent acquisition
 
00:58:07.069 --> 00:58:07.079 align:start position:0%
and in our talent Acquisitions really
 
00:58:09.670 --> 00:58:09.680 align:start position:0%
focus on Recruitment and Retention so
 
00:58:11.190 --> 00:58:11.200 align:start position:0%
you'll see throughout the this
 
00:58:13.109 --> 00:58:13.119 align:start position:0%
presentation some of the efforts that
 
00:58:15.510 --> 00:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
we've taken to try to not only just
 
00:58:18.670 --> 00:58:18.680 align:start position:0%
recruit people effectively using um best
 
00:58:20.349 --> 00:58:20.359 align:start position:0%
practice tools and Partnerships with
 
00:58:22.670 --> 00:58:22.680 align:start position:0%
administrative services but also
 
00:58:24.910 --> 00:58:24.920 align:start position:0%
retention practices to keep those people
 
00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:28.829 align:start position:0%
retention practices to keep those people
here

00:58:28.829 --> 00:58:28.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:31.150 --> 00:58:31.160 align:start position:0%
so are you through with that intro you
 
00:58:37.950 --> 00:58:37.960 align:start position:0%
ready for questions sure okay um so um
 
00:58:42.349 --> 00:58:42.359 align:start position:0%
it was the case six seven years ago that
 
00:58:45.630 --> 00:58:45.640 align:start position:0%
this we relied the DHHS relied on the
 
00:58:49.990 --> 00:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
state um website for people to come in
 
00:58:53.150 --> 00:58:53.160 align:start position:0%
externally to find out what jobs are
 
00:58:55.589 --> 00:58:55.599 align:start position:0%
vacant and to begin the application
 
00:58:55.599 --> 00:58:56.789 align:start position:0%
vacant and to begin the application
process

00:58:56.789 --> 00:58:56.799 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:58:59.430 --> 00:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
and that system was horrible and I I
 
00:59:02.270 --> 00:59:02.280 align:start position:0%
know that uh it had been a goal of uh
 
00:59:03.549 --> 00:59:03.559 align:start position:0%
the commissioner
 
00:59:07.150 --> 00:59:07.160 align:start position:0%
doit to upgrade that what what what do
 
00:59:09.710 --> 00:59:09.720 align:start position:0%
you think our current status is in terms
 
00:59:12.109 --> 00:59:12.119 align:start position:0%
of having a
 
00:59:12.119 --> 00:59:13.670 align:start position:0%
of having a
state-of-the-art

00:59:13.670 --> 00:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
state-of-the-art
 
00:59:17.589 --> 00:59:17.599 align:start position:0%
um marketing to the public so that they
 
00:59:21.069 --> 00:59:21.079 align:start position:0%
can find out which jobs they may uh be
 
00:59:23.710 --> 00:59:23.720 align:start position:0%
interested and qualify for in a nice
 
00:59:26.349 --> 00:59:26.359 align:start position:0%
clean elegant way certainly so we
 
00:59:27.950 --> 00:59:27.960 align:start position:0%
partnered with administrative services
 
00:59:30.029 --> 00:59:30.039 align:start position:0%
on a Statewide agreement um for
 
00:59:31.829 --> 00:59:31.839 align:start position:0%
different Marketing Solutions like
 
00:59:34.750 --> 00:59:34.760 align:start position:0%
indeed.com and Linkedin I'm sorry you
 
00:59:39.430 --> 00:59:39.440 align:start position:0%
said who ADP indeed I
 
00:59:42.750 --> 00:59:42.760 align:start position:0%
heard um and then LinkedIn as well as
 
00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:43.789 align:start position:0%
heard um and then LinkedIn as well as
other

00:59:43.789 --> 00:59:43.799 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:59:46.270 --> 00:59:46.280 align:start position:0%
Solutions um it still remains that the
 
00:59:48.230 --> 00:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
majority of our applicants come through
 
00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
the state New Hampshire first postings
 
00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
um that's where people have shown up and
 
00:59:55.870 --> 00:59:55.880 align:start position:0%
were able to um make their applications
 
00:59:59.190 --> 00:59:59.200 align:start position:0%
however ever we've had about another
 
01:00:01.589 --> 01:00:01.599 align:start position:0%
half again applicants coming in through
 
01:00:03.430 --> 01:00:03.440 align:start position:0%
indeed.com which has been a very
 
01:00:05.190 --> 01:00:05.200 align:start position:0%
successful solution of being able to
 
01:00:08.190 --> 01:00:08.200 align:start position:0%
recruit different staff um when it comes
 
01:00:10.630 --> 01:00:10.640 align:start position:0%
to the LinkedIn solution we haven't has
 
01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
much much success there there's a couple
 
01:00:16.029 --> 01:00:16.039 align:start position:0%
components to that LinkedIn um has
 
01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:18.640 align:start position:0%
multiple subscriptions um that you can
 
01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
add on that can really advance that and
 
01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
it's really focused or we've seen seen
 
01:00:26.349 --> 01:00:26.359 align:start position:0%
it being really focused on some of those
 
01:00:28.990 --> 01:00:29.000 align:start position:0%
professional um executive level type
 
01:00:31.069 --> 01:00:31.079 align:start position:0%
positions that we're not recruiting for
 
01:00:33.470 --> 01:00:33.480 align:start position:0%
so we've seen most of our success in our
 
01:00:35.789 --> 01:00:35.799 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire first Erp system or
 
01:00:37.470 --> 01:00:37.480 align:start position:0%
enterprise resource planning system and
 
01:00:39.510 --> 01:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
the indeed.com
 
01:00:42.190 --> 01:00:42.200 align:start position:0%
subscription okay are should we be
 
01:00:44.430 --> 01:00:44.440 align:start position:0%
satisfied with the way that we're using
 
01:00:47.230 --> 01:00:47.240 align:start position:0%
it to Market and begin the first
 
01:00:50.029 --> 01:00:50.039 align:start position:0%
introduction to to each other I think
 
01:00:52.470 --> 01:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
there's ongoing um components of our
 
01:00:55.390 --> 01:00:55.400 align:start position:0%
road map where we're engaging our our
 
01:00:57.870 --> 01:00:57.880 align:start position:0%
customers more effectively and trying to
 
01:00:59.750 --> 01:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
see how we can recruit more effectively
 
01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
through social media uh platforms as
 
01:01:04.230 --> 01:01:04.240 align:start position:0%
well and so that's something that you
 
01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
would I would anticipate our growth
 
01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
growth area to be in in the next couple
 
01:01:10.150 --> 01:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
years is the money for something like
 
01:01:12.750 --> 01:01:12.760 align:start position:0%
that in the HR budget or over somewhere
 
01:01:15.190 --> 01:01:15.200 align:start position:0%
in the it budget it would be over in the
 
01:01:18.390 --> 01:01:18.400 align:start position:0%
it budget however the the component for
 
01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
the indeed.com partnership with
 
01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
administrative Services was submitted in
 
01:01:25.549 --> 01:01:25.559 align:start position:0%
our agency phase but is not represented
 
01:01:27.390 --> 01:01:27.400 align:start position:0%
in the Governor's phase budget so it's
 
01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:28.349 align:start position:0%
in the Governor's phase budget so it's
about

01:01:28.349 --> 01:01:28.359 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:01:30.910 --> 01:01:30.920 align:start position:0%
$102,000 that you would see that was not
 
01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
did not make it to the governor's budget
 
01:01:36.750 --> 01:01:36.760 align:start position:0%
so you're $12k light on indeed.com
 
01:01:38.910 --> 01:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
upgrades is that what you just said um
 
01:01:42.270 --> 01:01:42.280 align:start position:0%
indeed.com subscriptions Mr chair and so
 
01:01:44.230 --> 01:01:44.240 align:start position:0%
if we don't have that money do you
 
01:01:46.549 --> 01:01:46.559 align:start position:0%
terminate the subscription and then we
 
01:01:50.029 --> 01:01:50.039 align:start position:0%
make it on something else without those
 
01:01:52.789 --> 01:01:52.799 align:start position:0%
funds we would be reverting back to the
 
01:01:55.470 --> 01:01:55.480 align:start position:0%
Legacy solution of just relying on the
 
01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:56.510 align:start position:0%
Legacy solution of just relying on the
state

01:01:56.510 --> 01:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:01:59.950 --> 01:01:59.960 align:start position:0%
um system the state Erp system so I
 
01:02:01.670 --> 01:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
assume the governor's office looked
 
01:02:05.109 --> 01:02:05.119 align:start position:0%
carefully at the the metrics around how
 
01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
indeed is paying paying off for us and
 
01:02:10.870 --> 01:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
and making this decision or do we need
 
01:02:14.190 --> 01:02:14.200 align:start position:0%
to relook that
 
01:02:16.150 --> 01:02:16.160 align:start position:0%
independently I can't speak for the
 
01:02:18.670 --> 01:02:18.680 align:start position:0%
governor's office however we did provide
 
01:02:21.430 --> 01:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
some of the metrics regarding the do you
 
01:02:23.150 --> 01:02:23.160 align:start position:0%
want to say anything about that Mr White
 
01:02:26.029 --> 01:02:26.039 align:start position:0%
do do do you know the basis of uh
 
01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
decision not to fund in indeed.com
 
01:02:31.829 --> 01:02:31.839 align:start position:0%
subscription no I I I don't recall
 
01:02:33.589 --> 01:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
specific details around this particular
 
01:02:35.589 --> 01:02:35.599 align:start position:0%
item all right thank you question
 
01:02:37.870 --> 01:02:37.880 align:start position:0%
Stringham and then priest yeah the
 
01:02:40.029 --> 01:02:40.039 align:start position:0%
question I have is around the hiring
 
01:02:44.430 --> 01:02:44.440 align:start position:0%
practices um uh I believe um last
 
01:02:48.109 --> 01:02:48.119 align:start position:0%
bium uh the since there was an overall
 
01:02:50.470 --> 01:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
uh limit to the number of employees that
 
01:02:53.829 --> 01:02:53.839 align:start position:0%
we uh that were authorized despite the
 
01:02:56.269 --> 01:02:56.279 align:start position:0%
number of approved positions being
 
01:02:59.630 --> 01:02:59.640 align:start position:0%
higher uh the practice was to uh not
 
01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:00.589 align:start position:0%
higher uh the practice was to uh not
even

01:03:00.589 --> 01:03:00.599 align:start position:0%
even
 
01:03:04.990 --> 01:03:05.000 align:start position:0%
begin um uh promoting the availability
 
01:03:07.990 --> 01:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
of of an approved position until you
 
01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
knew that say if the person came in was
 
01:03:12.990 --> 01:03:13.000 align:start position:0%
eligible qualified and you wanted to
 
01:03:14.789 --> 01:03:14.799 align:start position:0%
hire them they could be hired the next
 
01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
day was that still the practice or do
 
01:03:21.190 --> 01:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
you are you now able to actively recruit
 
01:03:23.309 --> 01:03:23.319 align:start position:0%
even though you may have to delay them
 
01:03:26.269 --> 01:03:26.279 align:start position:0%
coming in because of the um uh ceing of
 
01:03:29.990 --> 01:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
the number of employees sure so so Ju
 
01:03:31.630 --> 01:03:31.640 align:start position:0%
Just to provide a little bit of History
 
01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
here for for other members um so in the
 
01:03:37.950 --> 01:03:37.960 align:start position:0%
current bium we have in in the back of
 
01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
hb1 it's like page 700 or something
 
01:03:42.750 --> 01:03:42.760 align:start position:0%
there is there is the the back of the
 
01:03:45.510 --> 01:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
budget cut for HHS and within that back
 
01:03:48.349 --> 01:03:48.359 align:start position:0%
of the budget cut there's two components
 
01:03:52.069 --> 01:03:52.079 align:start position:0%
one is a reduction of General funds um
 
01:03:54.829 --> 01:03:54.839 align:start position:0%
23 million in change but that reduction
 
01:03:56.829 --> 01:03:56.839 align:start position:0%
is allowed to be a across the board so
 
01:03:59.190 --> 01:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
not just limited to personnel and
 
01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
there's also the second component that
 
01:04:03.430 --> 01:04:03.440 align:start position:0%
is a 3,000 position cap that's for the
 
01:04:08.109 --> 01:04:08.119 align:start position:0%
current bium in the in the prior bium
 
01:04:10.230 --> 01:04:10.240 align:start position:0%
there was a personnel only in the amount
 
01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
I think it was like 22.6 million
 
01:04:16.069 --> 01:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
personnel only as well as the 3,000
 
01:04:19.750 --> 01:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
position cap are um the in the current
 
01:04:20.910 --> 01:04:20.920 align:start position:0%
by any with the back of the budget that
 
01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
had more flexibility it hasn't impacted
 
01:04:26.510 --> 01:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
hiring in the same way that it did in
 
01:04:28.510 --> 01:04:28.520 align:start position:0%
the prior bium so in the prior bium
 
01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:30.640 align:start position:0%
coming out of that I think in December
 
01:04:33.109 --> 01:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
of 2022 we were looking at about a 22%
 
01:04:34.510 --> 01:04:34.520 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate after being under that and
 
01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
hiring freeze during the pandemic um
 
01:04:38.789 --> 01:04:38.799 align:start position:0%
currently we're at
 
01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
14.65 last I checked so that's about
 
01:04:45.029 --> 01:04:45.039 align:start position:0%
2,800 positions so we we haven't had any
 
01:04:48.390 --> 01:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
risk of yet bumping up to that 3,000 cap
 
01:04:51.829 --> 01:04:51.839 align:start position:0%
um that currently expires June 30th of
 
01:04:55.349 --> 01:04:55.359 align:start position:0%
2025 so a followup would be um so are
 
01:04:58.269 --> 01:04:58.279 align:start position:0%
you able to promote the availability of
 
01:05:00.430 --> 01:05:00.440 align:start position:0%
every position that's authorized at this
 
01:05:03.470 --> 01:05:03.480 align:start position:0%
time that that is vacant or do you still
 
01:05:06.549 --> 01:05:06.559 align:start position:0%
feel restricted in that so so there's
 
01:05:09.950 --> 01:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
there's um there's two factors right now
 
01:05:12.549 --> 01:05:12.559 align:start position:0%
that are different than the position we
 
01:05:15.109 --> 01:05:15.119 align:start position:0%
were in a month ago um the first being
 
01:05:17.630 --> 01:05:17.640 align:start position:0%
is that um the governor has issued an
 
01:05:20.789 --> 01:05:20.799 align:start position:0%
executive order that puts a hiring free
 
01:05:24.430 --> 01:05:24.440 align:start position:0%
on non-direct care positions And so
 
01:05:26.230 --> 01:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
there's that component that we need to
 
01:05:28.309 --> 01:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
balance here and we need to make sure
 
01:05:30.710 --> 01:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
that you know when looking at Statewide
 
01:05:32.549 --> 01:05:32.559 align:start position:0%
expenses that's a that's a serious
 
01:05:34.150 --> 01:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
consideration and there's a process for
 
01:05:35.670 --> 01:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
that and the governor's team is involved
 
01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
in that and overseeing it the second
 
01:05:39.390 --> 01:05:39.400 align:start position:0%
component that we're currently sitting
 
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
in that you know is very much on our
 
01:05:43.069 --> 01:05:43.079 align:start position:0%
mind and we'll work with the committee
 
01:05:45.990 --> 01:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
through this is currently our budget
 
01:05:48.309 --> 01:05:48.319 align:start position:0%
effective July 1 looks like it has about
 
01:05:51.430 --> 01:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
394 positions that are unfunded and so
 
01:05:53.109 --> 01:05:53.119 align:start position:0%
we're also Dave and I I don't know how
 
01:05:55.269 --> 01:05:55.279 align:start position:0%
many hours we've spent it on already I
 
01:05:56.670 --> 01:05:56.680 align:start position:0%
mean we've we' also been looking at this
 
01:05:58.990 --> 01:05:59.000 align:start position:0%
trying to find an effective way to make
 
01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
sure that care direct care is not
 
01:06:03.910 --> 01:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
impacted and it's a bit of a balancing
 
01:06:05.390 --> 01:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
act because we are anticipating that
 
01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:06.640 align:start position:0%
we're not going to have the Personnel
 
01:06:08.990 --> 01:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
funds come July 1 that we have in the
 
01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.510 align:start position:0%
funds come July 1 that we have in the
current

01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:13.990 --> 01:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
bium representative
 
01:06:16.309 --> 01:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
priest thank you Mr chairman I have
 
01:06:18.670 --> 01:06:18.680 align:start position:0%
several questions the first one again
 
01:06:20.990 --> 01:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
going back to a question that was
 
01:06:25.230 --> 01:06:25.240 align:start position:0%
offered by chairman uh Edwards my
 
01:06:28.829 --> 01:06:28.839 align:start position:0%
understanding was it cost
 
01:06:32.870 --> 01:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
$102,000 for the indeed
 
01:06:37.029 --> 01:06:37.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
Department y that's what they
 
01:06:41.829 --> 01:06:41.839 align:start position:0%
said that correct thank you for the
 
01:06:45.390 --> 01:06:45.400 align:start position:0%
question sorry for the delay the the
 
01:06:48.750 --> 01:06:48.760 align:start position:0%
$102,000 is a projected cost of our our
 
01:06:50.630 --> 01:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
cost associated with the Statewide
 
01:06:52.390 --> 01:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
agreement partnership with
 
01:06:54.069 --> 01:06:54.079 align:start position:0%
administrative Services indeed
 
01:06:56.230 --> 01:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
specifically is 7200
 
01:07:00.269 --> 01:07:00.279 align:start position:0%
44 of that okay and then there was a a
 
01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:03.200 align:start position:0%
projected cost increase of
 
01:07:05.670 --> 01:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
$988 that brings that up and then we
 
01:07:08.589 --> 01:07:08.599 align:start position:0%
were planning to participate at a
 
01:07:11.549 --> 01:07:11.559 align:start position:0%
reduced level on the LinkedIn contract
 
01:07:13.829 --> 01:07:13.839 align:start position:0%

01:07:31.789 --> 01:07:31.799 align:start position:0%

hospital and then we have one additional
 
01:08:33.110 --> 01:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
um HR position over a glen Cliff home
 
01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
managing the gamut of everything at Glen
 
01:08:39.229 --> 01:08:39.239 align:start position:0%
cff home uh the the last question is on
 
01:08:41.550 --> 01:08:41.560 align:start position:0%
page uh
 
01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:47.199 align:start position:0%
1047 of the governor's Budget on item
 
01:08:51.510 --> 01:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
050 Personnel services- temp
 
01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
slappointment or something um could
 
01:08:59.189 --> 01:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
could you explain to me why there's this
 
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
variation of
 
01:09:03.789 --> 01:09:03.799 align:start position:0%
$3,000 between
 
01:09:06.470 --> 01:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
2,24 to
 
01:09:09.870 --> 01:09:09.880 align:start position:0%
2025 just to be clear you meant 1047
 
01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:11.470 align:start position:0%
2025 just to be clear you meant 1047
because

01:09:11.470 --> 01:09:11.480 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:09:15.309 --> 01:09:15.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:17.789 --> 01:09:17.799 align:start position:0%
that is is that a different department
 
01:09:23.229 --> 01:09:23.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:26.070 --> 01:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
not okay I'll come back to the
 
01:09:30.030 --> 01:09:30.040 align:start position:0%
okay because I I think they I we HR is
 
01:09:33.829 --> 01:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
uh starting at 1056 okay thank you all
 
01:09:36.669 --> 01:09:36.679 align:start position:0%
right U representative
 
01:09:39.789 --> 01:09:39.799 align:start position:0%
seor thank you Mr chairman uh I'd like
 
01:09:42.630 --> 01:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
to clarify something going back to that
 
01:09:46.829 --> 01:09:46.839 align:start position:0%
102k it sounded like about
 
01:09:49.749 --> 01:09:49.759 align:start position:0%
20K has to do with the LinkedIn contract
 
01:09:52.669 --> 01:09:52.679 align:start position:0%
which is a Statewide
 
01:09:54.830 --> 01:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
initiative did I hear that correct that
 
01:09:57.950 --> 01:09:57.960 align:start position:0%
is correct so and that that wasn't
 
01:10:00.510 --> 01:10:00.520 align:start position:0%
funded by the governor so it sounds to
 
01:10:04.390 --> 01:10:04.400 align:start position:0%
me like at least that portion is a much
 
01:10:07.390 --> 01:10:07.400 align:start position:0%
bigger item than just what we had before
 
01:10:09.030 --> 01:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
01:10:12.790 --> 01:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
because you couldn't just pay your 20K
 
01:10:15.229 --> 01:10:15.239 align:start position:0%
and go get your LinkedIn it has to be
 
01:10:17.390 --> 01:10:17.400 align:start position:0%
that the state continues with what it's
 
01:10:19.350 --> 01:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
doing as a whole and you would ship in
 
01:10:22.470 --> 01:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
for your share am I hearing that right
 
01:10:25.070 --> 01:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
that is a fair um assumption we have we
 
01:10:27.070 --> 01:10:27.080 align:start position:0%
are partnership with Department of
 
01:10:28.709 --> 01:10:28.719 align:start position:0%
administrative services and they
 
01:10:31.070 --> 01:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
basically part um work across all
 
01:10:34.510 --> 01:10:34.520 align:start position:0%
agencies and our share of that is about
 
01:10:37.310 --> 01:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
20,000 we have we are negotiations
 
01:10:39.630 --> 01:10:39.640 align:start position:0%
telling and basically indicating to them
 
01:10:41.310 --> 01:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
when they're talking to LinkedIn we're
 
01:10:43.229 --> 01:10:43.239 align:start position:0%
going to be pulling out because we can't
 
01:10:45.990 --> 01:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
we don't see two things one is it's not
 
01:10:48.229 --> 01:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
in our budget and two we weren't seeing
 
01:10:51.070 --> 01:10:51.080 align:start position:0%
the actual productivity of utilizing
 
01:10:52.830 --> 01:10:52.840 align:start position:0%
those funds in that area in that
 
01:10:54.830 --> 01:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
direction so those are ongoing
 
01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:55.910 align:start position:0%
direction so those are ongoing
discussions

01:10:55.910 --> 01:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
discussions
 
01:10:58.229 --> 01:10:58.239 align:start position:0%
um sometimes when you start pulling out
 
01:11:00.709 --> 01:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
from a vendor they might reduce their
 
01:11:04.990 --> 01:11:05.000 align:start position:0%
costs um but that that both the LinkedIn
 
01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
and the indeed are part of a Statewide
 
01:11:12.430 --> 01:11:12.440 align:start position:0%
agreement go ahead so then what I said
 
01:11:15.870 --> 01:11:15.880 align:start position:0%
kind of applies to both that if for
 
01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
whatever reason on the Statewide level
 
01:11:19.950 --> 01:11:19.960 align:start position:0%
that money is just
 
01:11:22.270 --> 01:11:22.280 align:start position:0%
unavailable then
 
01:11:26.270 --> 01:11:26.280 align:start position:0%
really hhs's portion of it isn't
 
01:11:29.709 --> 01:11:29.719 align:start position:0%
possible unless the state renegotiates
 
01:11:32.830 --> 01:11:32.840 align:start position:0%
that and has the funding for it if I
 
01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
understand your question if the funding
 
01:11:37.709 --> 01:11:37.719 align:start position:0%
from the Statewide perspective is
 
01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
removed from the budget then all
 
01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
agencies portions would also need to be
 
01:11:46.189 --> 01:11:46.199 align:start position:0%
removed right that was my better said
 
01:11:47.910 --> 01:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
that was what I was asking go ahead Mr
 
01:11:49.990 --> 01:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
White the the alternative and and and
 
01:11:52.910 --> 01:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
just to clarify so so it's 102,000 um in
 
01:11:55.590 --> 01:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
each state fiscal year it's about 68% %
 
01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:00.159 align:start position:0%
General funds of the total um I think uh
 
01:12:03.310 --> 01:12:03.320 align:start position:0%
two quick things one is to to Dave's
 
01:12:05.310 --> 01:12:05.320 align:start position:0%
Point around assessing the services that
 
01:12:07.350 --> 01:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
we received we prepared these numbers
 
01:12:11.390 --> 01:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
back in August um alternatively if this
 
01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
if the department of administrative
 
01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
Services didn't move forward with that
 
01:12:17.070 --> 01:12:17.080 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't necessarily prohibit the
 
01:12:20.350 --> 01:12:20.360 align:start position:0%
department from finding a solution uh
 
01:12:22.390 --> 01:12:22.400 align:start position:0%
towards recruitment just you know and
 
01:12:24.470 --> 01:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking in terms of we need to make
 
01:12:25.830 --> 01:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
sure that we have nurses at New
 
01:12:27.189 --> 01:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital because it's going to
 
01:12:29.070 --> 01:12:29.080 align:start position:0%
cost us twice as much to get contracted
 
01:12:32.030 --> 01:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
agency staff um same thing at Glen Cliff
 
01:12:33.990 --> 01:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
same thing at the Youth Development
 
01:12:35.629 --> 01:12:35.639 align:start position:0%
Center where we've had to rely on
 
01:12:37.590 --> 01:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
contracted staff and then it creates pay
 
01:12:39.310 --> 01:12:39.320 align:start position:0%
inequities between the employees that
 
01:12:41.229 --> 01:12:41.239 align:start position:0%
actually work there so there's a number
 
01:12:43.550 --> 01:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
of sort of Downstream effects and I I
 
01:12:46.030 --> 01:12:46.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't I I I wouldn't necessarily say
 
01:12:47.550 --> 01:12:47.560 align:start position:0%
that because they didn't move forward
 
01:12:49.149 --> 01:12:49.159 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying they shouldn't but I'm
 
01:12:50.709 --> 01:12:50.719 align:start position:0%
saying that if they didn't move forward
 
01:12:52.350 --> 01:12:52.360 align:start position:0%
I think strategically we would still
 
01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
want to think about what are the
 
01:12:55.790 --> 01:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
downstream impacts to the individuals
 
01:12:57.990 --> 01:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
that we serve in our general
 
01:13:00.669 --> 01:13:00.679 align:start position:0%
operations so I'm I'm going to go to you
 
01:13:02.629 --> 01:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
represent Daniels just a second but a
 
01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
followup to your comment there that's an
 
01:13:08.189 --> 01:13:08.199 align:start position:0%
outstanding Point you're making we we it
 
01:13:11.790 --> 01:13:11.800 align:start position:0%
costs us boatloads to do uh prum's
 
01:13:16.390 --> 01:13:16.400 align:start position:0%
contract U nurses and the like and uh
 
01:13:18.790 --> 01:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
and so as you come back because I'd like
 
01:13:20.990 --> 01:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
some more information around the impact
 
01:13:22.629 --> 01:13:22.639 align:start position:0%
of this missing
 
01:13:25.910 --> 01:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
102,000 i' I'd like to understand what
 
01:13:28.790 --> 01:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
what you all your experience has been
 
01:13:32.629 --> 01:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
with using these tools to to recruit RNs
 
01:13:34.990 --> 01:13:35.000 align:start position:0%
because with with RNs I think that's
 
01:13:37.790 --> 01:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
more of a national search because I feel
 
01:13:40.510 --> 01:13:40.520 align:start position:0%
like we've fished New Hampshire out and
 
01:13:42.830 --> 01:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
we need to be bringing people in that's
 
01:13:45.390 --> 01:13:45.400 align:start position:0%
that's my assumption of our Workforce
 
01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:47.189 align:start position:0%
that's my assumption of our Workforce
with

01:13:47.189 --> 01:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:13:47.199 --> 01:13:49.550 align:start position:0%
with
nurses

01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
nurses
 
01:13:52.430 --> 01:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
that's yeah you're you're off I switched
 
01:13:54.270 --> 01:13:54.280 align:start position:0%
it sorry we certainly can go back and
 
01:13:56.629 --> 01:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
get that information for you Mr chair
 
01:13:58.510 --> 01:13:58.520 align:start position:0%
okay um and then I'm going to go to
 
01:14:00.629 --> 01:14:00.639 align:start position:0%
representative Daniels and I'm but I'm
 
01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
going to close by asking you what other
 
01:14:07.070 --> 01:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
critical it systems are needed for HR
 
01:14:09.189 --> 01:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
but but go ahead thank you could you
 
01:14:11.709 --> 01:14:11.719 align:start position:0%
could you please State uh to what
 
01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
applies so the the 3000 um cap it was
 
01:14:24.750 --> 01:14:24.760 align:start position:0%
for full-time authorized positions so
 
01:14:27.030 --> 01:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
that includes your classified employees
 
01:14:30.110 --> 01:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
and your unclassified employees um those
 
01:14:32.229 --> 01:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
employees their salaries are represented
 
01:14:35.629 --> 01:14:35.639 align:start position:0%
in class 12 the unclassified and Class
 
01:14:38.030 --> 01:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
10 for the the permanent full-time
 
01:14:39.830 --> 01:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
authorized employees and that and that
 
01:14:44.110 --> 01:14:44.120 align:start position:0%
cap um was was applied to to those
 
01:14:46.149 --> 01:14:46.159 align:start position:0%
specific positions which are rough
 
01:14:49.189 --> 01:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
roughly 2800 filled last I checked okay
 
01:14:49.199 --> 01:14:49.910 align:start position:0%
roughly 2800 filled last I checked okay
thank

01:14:49.910 --> 01:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:14:53.470 --> 01:14:53.480 align:start position:0%
you represent Alan um thank you for
 
01:14:54.709 --> 01:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
taking the question I have a couple of
 
01:14:59.750 --> 01:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
quick questions uh does HR have a uh
 
01:15:02.550 --> 01:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
probationary policy with regard to new
 
01:15:06.709 --> 01:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
hars and if so what's the length of that
 
01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
probationary period and roughly at any
 
01:15:11.189 --> 01:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
given time you know average number of
 
01:15:14.550 --> 01:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
people on on
 
01:15:17.229 --> 01:15:17.239 align:start position:0%
probation so yes there is a probationary
 
01:15:21.149 --> 01:15:21.159 align:start position:0%
period for classified employees and I
 
01:15:23.110 --> 01:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
I'm going to look to jna really quick I
 
01:15:26.910 --> 01:15:26.920 align:start position:0%
believe it's is it 6 months or
 
01:15:30.950 --> 01:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
12 it's initially 12 months for the F
 
01:15:33.070 --> 01:15:33.080 align:start position:0%
for the first hire of that classified
 
01:15:35.669 --> 01:15:35.679 align:start position:0%
employee so that's a long time yeah
 
01:15:38.070 --> 01:15:38.080 align:start position:0%
that's a yeah that's a long time and and
 
01:15:39.470 --> 01:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
and just to clarify that's not a
 
01:15:41.350 --> 01:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:15:43.910 --> 01:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
rule that that that that's a collective
 
01:15:45.950 --> 01:15:45.960 align:start position:0%
State rule that applies to all state
 
01:15:49.110 --> 01:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
employees as far as that year to become
 
01:15:52.510 --> 01:15:52.520 align:start position:0%
certified okay so it applies to the HR
 
01:15:55.629 --> 01:15:55.639 align:start position:0%
section of DHHS uses that we we we
 
01:15:57.310 --> 01:15:57.320 align:start position:0%
comply with the division of personnel
 
01:15:59.030 --> 01:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
rules that are issued by the Department
 
01:16:01.510 --> 01:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
administrative services division of
 
01:16:04.510 --> 01:16:04.520 align:start position:0%
personnel um and okay and so the
 
01:16:07.790 --> 01:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
probationary period U is for cause or
 
01:16:08.870 --> 01:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
for any
 
01:16:11.910 --> 01:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
reason um somebody on probationary
 
01:16:14.910 --> 01:16:14.920 align:start position:0%
period could be let go is that an at
 
01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:17.790 align:start position:0%
period could be let go is that an at
will

01:16:17.790 --> 01:16:17.800 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:16:20.149 --> 01:16:20.159 align:start position:0%
situation I I can take that back and get
 
01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
the exact answer but it is similar to an
 
01:16:25.510 --> 01:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
at will but there are other components
 
01:16:27.070 --> 01:16:27.080 align:start position:0%
of the collective bargaining agreement
 
01:16:29.149 --> 01:16:29.159 align:start position:0%
that we would have to follow so it's not
 
01:16:30.709 --> 01:16:30.719 align:start position:0%
as straightforward
 
01:16:34.470 --> 01:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
as okay as goodbye the answer one other
 
01:16:37.310 --> 01:16:37.320 align:start position:0%
additional question in
 
01:16:40.270 --> 01:16:40.280 align:start position:0%
the uh organizational development and
 
01:16:44.709 --> 01:16:44.719 align:start position:0%
Training Services area is that inhouse
 
01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
or does that involve a mix of In-House
 
01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh uh training and and uh contract
 
01:16:55.350 --> 01:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
saving uh and and if it's
 
01:16:57.189 --> 01:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
uh involving contractors is some of that
 
01:17:00.350 --> 01:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
money in a different different
 
01:17:03.550 --> 01:17:03.560 align:start position:0%
area it it is there is a line item in
 
01:17:08.709 --> 01:17:08.719 align:start position:0%
your budget so under 066 on the page
 
01:17:13.110 --> 01:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
1056 of the of the budget there's
 
01:17:15.189 --> 01:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
$273,000 in there and that's for
 
01:17:18.750 --> 01:17:18.760 align:start position:0%
materials uh as well as supplies and and
 
01:17:21.189 --> 01:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
if needed contractors but we do have the
 
01:17:23.709 --> 01:17:23.719 align:start position:0%
organizational development team does the
 
01:17:26.110 --> 01:17:26.120 align:start position:0%
majority of the curriculum building and
 
01:17:28.550 --> 01:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
the training of those of those work but
 
01:17:32.030 --> 01:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
they leverage those funds to subscribe
 
01:17:34.910 --> 01:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
to Solutions um for like leadership type
 
01:17:37.950 --> 01:17:37.960 align:start position:0%
training materials um similar to like if
 
01:17:39.910 --> 01:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
you've heard of disk training where you
 
01:17:42.750 --> 01:17:42.760 align:start position:0%
you get a specific focused group and you
 
01:17:44.950 --> 01:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
organize people together to understand
 
01:17:47.430 --> 01:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
their learning their learning process
 
01:17:49.229 --> 01:17:49.239 align:start position:0%
and how they learn so that you can bring
 
01:17:51.270 --> 01:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
people together more effectively I'm not
 
01:17:54.350 --> 01:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
doing its justice but it is all in house
 
01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:56.470 align:start position:0%
doing its justice but it is all in house
work

01:17:56.470 --> 01:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:17:59.950 --> 01:17:59.960 align:start position:0%
so so just a quick followup that that
 
01:18:01.709 --> 01:18:01.719 align:start position:0%
wouldn't Encompass like something like
 
01:18:04.990 --> 01:18:05.000 align:start position:0%
peer groups that we heard in the
 
01:18:08.750 --> 01:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
EAP uh program no it wouldn't Encompass
 
01:18:10.990 --> 01:18:11.000 align:start position:0%
peer groups it it's really that budget
 
01:18:13.030 --> 01:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
there is focus on materials and supplies
 
01:18:16.629 --> 01:18:16.639 align:start position:0%
and subscriptions to to tools and and
 
01:18:19.030 --> 01:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
and materials but they if there's peer
 
01:18:20.550 --> 01:18:20.560 align:start position:0%
Group Training there is training
 
01:18:22.510 --> 01:18:22.520 align:start position:0%
throughout the department for specific
 
01:18:25.270 --> 01:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
functions like child support and uh
 
01:18:27.510 --> 01:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
child welfare and EAP where they would
 
01:18:30.189 --> 01:18:30.199 align:start position:0%
have their own budget for those training
 
01:18:32.110 --> 01:18:32.120 align:start position:0%
um Information Services has a training
 
01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
budget for project management for for
 
01:18:38.310 --> 01:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
for um example and also would it be you
 
01:18:41.470 --> 01:18:41.480 align:start position:0%
know a burden to possibly have a look at
 
01:18:44.310 --> 01:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
some of the training materials if yeah
 
01:18:46.990 --> 01:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
we certainly should be able to send you
 
01:18:49.790 --> 01:18:49.800 align:start position:0%
links to it as well as um documents yeah
 
01:18:52.510 --> 01:18:52.520 align:start position:0%
link you you might want to be more clear
 
01:18:54.310 --> 01:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
on which training material you're
 
01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:56.030 align:start position:0%
on which training material you're
looking

01:18:56.030 --> 01:18:56.040 align:start position:0%
looking
 
01:18:59.149 --> 01:18:59.159 align:start position:0%
they probably have a tremendous range of
 
01:19:02.030 --> 01:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
trainings in this area that may be good
 
01:19:03.830 --> 01:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
because for example like we have
 
01:19:05.470 --> 01:19:05.480 align:start position:0%
trainings on how to read a statement of
 
01:19:07.189 --> 01:19:07.199 align:start position:0%
Appropriations it's certainly not the
 
01:19:08.790 --> 01:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
most exciting of trainings I'm more than
 
01:19:11.070 --> 01:19:11.080 align:start position:0%
willing to share it but is there a
 
01:19:15.590 --> 01:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
specific okay so so um um ancient
 
01:19:18.350 --> 01:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
corporate experience we used to have a
 
01:19:20.910 --> 01:19:20.920 align:start position:0%
management level sensitivity training is
 
01:19:23.310 --> 01:19:23.320 align:start position:0%
that is that an area that we still so to
 
01:19:25.669 --> 01:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
get to the nub of that this is another
 
01:19:28.830 --> 01:19:28.840 align:start position:0%
probe around Dei do do do have we
 
01:19:31.709 --> 01:19:31.719 align:start position:0%
screened these materials to make sure
 
01:19:34.709 --> 01:19:34.719 align:start position:0%
that those classic components of Dei
 
01:19:37.790 --> 01:19:37.800 align:start position:0%
training are not part of our training
 
01:19:41.390 --> 01:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
program we have screened to make sure
 
01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
that there isn't Dei specifics however
 
01:19:46.709 --> 01:19:46.719 align:start position:0%
we have like code of conduct and ethics
 
01:19:49.430 --> 01:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
training so that people manage privacy
 
01:19:52.310 --> 01:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
of materials sure but we're not training
 
01:19:55.310 --> 01:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
people that they're inherently in ior if
 
01:19:57.870 --> 01:19:57.880 align:start position:0%
they're a particular race or
 
01:20:00.189 --> 01:20:00.199 align:start position:0%
gender not that I know of but I will
 
01:20:02.950 --> 01:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
validate that statement and that sort of
 
01:20:05.910 --> 01:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
thing you know so and then was that
 
01:20:07.510 --> 01:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
really yeah thanks for that thanks for
 
01:20:10.149 --> 01:20:10.159 align:start position:0%
the more direct uh that's all right
 
01:20:12.270 --> 01:20:12.280 align:start position:0%
point I I think the subject's been
 
01:20:14.390 --> 01:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
broached we can probably just talk about
 
01:20:18.030 --> 01:20:18.040 align:start position:0%
it directly um do you have any
 
01:20:21.870 --> 01:20:21.880 align:start position:0%
other okay so so um as I'm looking at
 
01:20:24.270 --> 01:20:24.280 align:start position:0%
the numbers as you went around the five
 
01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:25.390 align:start position:0%
the numbers as you went around the five
ele

01:20:25.390 --> 01:20:25.400 align:start position:0%
ele
 
01:20:29.229 --> 01:20:29.239 align:start position:0%
I think I counted 30 uh FTE but when I
 
01:20:31.830 --> 01:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
go look at the governor's recommended I
 
01:20:36.270 --> 01:20:36.280 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing uh 32 up one from 31 and I'm
 
01:20:38.830 --> 01:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
just wondering if as you went around the
 
01:20:40.830 --> 01:20:40.840 align:start position:0%
wheel telling us how many you had in
 
01:20:44.189 --> 01:20:44.199 align:start position:0%
each block uh if we missed to I I I
 
01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
believe what's missing is the director
 
01:20:47.870 --> 01:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
and and deputy director position from
 
01:20:50.149 --> 01:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
that total count okay that would explain
 
01:20:55.430 --> 01:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
it um and then um what other
 
01:20:58.390 --> 01:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
critical uh it systems are there I I
 
01:21:00.550 --> 01:21:00.560 align:start position:0%
don't need the Ash and trash like
 
01:21:05.430 --> 01:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
Microsoft but but are there some key uh
 
01:21:08.149 --> 01:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
components of the HR department that
 
01:21:11.830 --> 01:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
rely on a specific it system I would say
 
01:21:14.350 --> 01:21:14.360 align:start position:0%
there's three key ones so the first one
 
01:21:16.270 --> 01:21:16.280 align:start position:0%
is New Hampshire first which is M
 
01:21:18.910 --> 01:21:18.920 align:start position:0%
migrating to Cloud Suite which is the
 
01:21:20.830 --> 01:21:20.840 align:start position:0%
Statewide enterprise resource planning
 
01:21:24.669 --> 01:21:24.679 align:start position:0%
tool um managed and operated by um
 
01:21:27.590 --> 01:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
administrative Services yeah and so that
 
01:21:30.070 --> 01:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
one is where we do all of our
 
01:21:34.590 --> 01:21:34.600 align:start position:0%
transactions for every area then we also
 
01:21:37.310 --> 01:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
um funded in bis the learning management
 
01:21:39.229 --> 01:21:39.239 align:start position:0%
system that you heard about earlier so
 
01:21:41.110 --> 01:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
this is where the core of the LMS
 
01:21:43.950 --> 01:21:43.960 align:start position:0%
expenses for the entire department the
 
01:21:46.790 --> 01:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
LMS expense is actually in the um Bureau
 
01:21:49.910 --> 01:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
of Information Services um budget but
 
01:21:53.830 --> 01:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
this team manages the LMS so HR is
 
01:21:56.390 --> 01:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
responsible for managing this system
 
01:22:00.110 --> 01:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
good and it utilizes um hundreds of
 
01:22:03.310 --> 01:22:03.320 align:start position:0%
different um training components that we
 
01:22:06.350 --> 01:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
do screen and and validate the content
 
01:22:08.870 --> 01:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
that is in there and allow for anyone in
 
01:22:11.590 --> 01:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
the workforce to utilize including
 
01:22:14.189 --> 01:22:14.199 align:start position:0%
annual compliance for policies and
 
01:22:17.350 --> 01:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
procedures and standard uh components
 
01:22:19.390 --> 01:22:19.400 align:start position:0%
like sexual harassment training ethics
 
01:22:21.750 --> 01:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
training what else and then the the
 
01:22:24.310 --> 01:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
third one is essentially a combination
 
01:22:26.270 --> 01:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
of two things the Enterprise business
 
01:22:29.990 --> 01:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
intelligence platform is where we manage
 
01:22:31.590 --> 01:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
all of our data we actually get an
 
01:22:34.669 --> 01:22:34.679 align:start position:0%
extract from the cloud Suite solution
 
01:22:37.510 --> 01:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
the Erp solution into that and then we
 
01:22:40.350 --> 01:22:40.360 align:start position:0%
have an access database which is our H
 
01:22:43.350 --> 01:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
HR or human resources headcount database
 
01:22:46.270 --> 01:22:46.280 align:start position:0%
so that combined with ebi we use that
 
01:22:49.830 --> 01:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
for our data analytics for for um
 
01:22:51.430 --> 01:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
understanding our vacancy rates
 
01:22:53.390 --> 01:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
understanding our turnover rates and
 
01:22:56.390 --> 01:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
managing our our statistics
 
01:22:59.709 --> 01:22:59.719 align:start position:0%
H that sounds like a good application
 
01:23:00.910 --> 01:23:00.920 align:start position:0%
it's definitely
 
01:23:03.229 --> 01:23:03.239 align:start position:0%
helpful okay and of course you heard
 
01:23:05.070 --> 01:23:05.080 align:start position:0%
about the the other one which was our
 
01:23:07.990 --> 01:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
recruitment platform of leveraging um
 
01:23:10.830 --> 01:23:10.840 align:start position:0%
indeed as well as the State website all
 
01:23:13.870 --> 01:23:13.880 align:start position:0%
right okay and then standard questions
 
01:23:15.709 --> 01:23:15.719 align:start position:0%
what what is your vacancy rate and how
 
01:23:19.189 --> 01:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
long does it take to train up a new
 
01:23:23.550 --> 01:23:23.560 align:start position:0%
person so we currently have and we have
 
01:23:25.629 --> 01:23:25.639 align:start position:0%
eight full-time vac and two part-time
 
01:23:28.950 --> 01:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
vacants right now out of the staff so
 
01:23:33.030 --> 01:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
that's rough math about 30% low over and
 
01:23:34.870 --> 01:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
what is the organizational impact what
 
01:23:36.790 --> 01:23:36.800 align:start position:0%
are you guys not doing that's critical
 
01:23:39.510 --> 01:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
as a result of being down I I I would
 
01:23:41.629 --> 01:23:41.639 align:start position:0%
just say that we are keeping up but
 
01:23:43.709 --> 01:23:43.719 align:start position:0%
barely um so the areas that are having
 
01:23:46.189 --> 01:23:46.199 align:start position:0%
some challenges in in terms of response
 
01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
time is employee relations Ada requests
 
01:23:51.229 --> 01:23:51.239 align:start position:0%
are taking longer because we're down
 
01:23:54.510 --> 01:23:54.520 align:start position:0%
2third of that Workforce we are able to
 
01:23:57.189 --> 01:23:57.199 align:start position:0%
maintain payroll and benefits however
 
01:23:59.550 --> 01:23:59.560 align:start position:0%
we're delayed on workforce management in
 
01:24:01.470 --> 01:24:01.480 align:start position:0%
terms of being able to ensure that we
 
01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
have enough resources to support that
 
01:24:05.990 --> 01:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
and then over in our organizational
 
01:24:08.430 --> 01:24:08.440 align:start position:0%
development and training we are short a
 
01:24:10.669 --> 01:24:10.679 align:start position:0%
number of staff there including the
 
01:24:12.990 --> 01:24:13.000 align:start position:0%
administrator which is reducing our
 
01:24:15.910 --> 01:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
ability to perform training Solutions
 
01:24:18.070 --> 01:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
across the department those trainings
 
01:24:21.830 --> 01:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
are critical for managing to creating
 
01:24:23.910 --> 01:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
better leadership better supervisory SK
 
01:24:25.790 --> 01:24:25.800 align:start position:0%
skills so that we can actually retain
 
01:24:28.229 --> 01:24:28.239 align:start position:0%
our staff right and so that that's
 
01:24:30.350 --> 01:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
really the impact and and currently
 
01:24:31.950 --> 01:24:31.960 align:start position:0%
there are six positions that were
 
01:24:33.750 --> 01:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
unfunded in this in this budget and
 
01:24:35.830 --> 01:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
you'll see that reduction in class 10
 
01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:39.229 align:start position:0%
you'll see that reduction in class 10
and

01:24:39.229 --> 01:24:39.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:41.109 --> 01:24:41.119 align:start position:0%
60 did you have a question
 
01:24:44.109 --> 01:24:44.119 align:start position:0%
representative wner I saw a hand gesture
 
01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
over there no okay do you need
 
01:24:51.270 --> 01:24:51.280 align:start position:0%
it the the six positions that are
 
01:24:53.430 --> 01:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
unfunded are including in included in
 
01:24:55.550 --> 01:24:55.560 align:start position:0%
the 10 vacancy
 
01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:58.390 align:start position:0%
the 10 vacancy
yes

01:24:58.390 --> 01:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:01.950 --> 01:25:01.960 align:start position:0%
okay okay are there any other questions
 
01:25:04.189 --> 01:25:04.199 align:start position:0%
for from the
 
01:25:07.629 --> 01:25:07.639 align:start position:0%
members uh okay again I I made you
 
01:25:10.390 --> 01:25:10.400 align:start position:0%
Hopscotch all over your presentation is
 
01:25:13.510 --> 01:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
there anything critical uh that we need
 
01:25:15.750 --> 01:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
to know from a resource allocation
 
01:25:18.149 --> 01:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
perspective that that we've not
 
01:25:20.350 --> 01:25:20.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned I think we covered it I mean
 
01:25:22.310 --> 01:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
there's statistics in there that you can
 
01:25:24.350 --> 01:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
peruse at your own time but we covered
 
01:25:26.790 --> 01:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
all the information for the HR thank you
 
01:25:29.189 --> 01:25:29.199 align:start position:0%
okay again my theory on this is that we
 
01:25:32.390 --> 01:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
tried to spend time before uh the budget
 
01:25:34.790 --> 01:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
arrived dealing with what does a
 
01:25:37.950 --> 01:25:37.960 align:start position:0%
department do um and how it does it and
 
01:25:40.629 --> 01:25:40.639 align:start position:0%
now we're really trying to focus on what
 
01:25:42.390 --> 01:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
kind of resources and performance
 
01:25:45.990 --> 01:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
metrics are there to um for us to know
 
01:25:49.310 --> 01:25:49.320 align:start position:0%
how we're doing so so that's that's sort
 
01:25:53.350 --> 01:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
of why I'm I'm um sabotaging the the the
 
01:25:55.229 --> 01:25:55.239 align:start position:0%
presentations getting straight to the
 
01:25:58.910 --> 01:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
point on resource allocation so thank
 
01:26:02.510 --> 01:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
you for your patience uh you you you did
 
01:26:04.910 --> 01:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
very well for somebody who's not steeped
 
01:26:08.229 --> 01:26:08.239 align:start position:0%
in HR so thank you thank you Mr chair
 
01:26:10.910 --> 01:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee
 
01:26:15.070 --> 01:26:15.080 align:start position:0%
okay uh next up division of program
 
01:26:17.629 --> 01:26:17.639 align:start position:0%
quality and integrity and if you can get
 
01:26:20.950 --> 01:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
us oriented between the three documents
 
01:26:24.669 --> 01:26:24.679 align:start position:0%
okay sure so if you it should just be
 
01:26:26.709 --> 01:26:26.719 align:start position:0%
the next uh presentation in order in
 
01:26:30.430 --> 01:26:30.440 align:start position:0%
front of you and the there's two
 
01:26:32.350 --> 01:26:32.360 align:start position:0%
accounting units that are associated
 
01:26:35.270 --> 01:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
with this um Division and they're in two
 
01:26:37.189 --> 01:26:37.199 align:start position:0%
different locations which is not the
 
01:26:38.790 --> 01:26:38.800 align:start position:0%
easiest thing but we'll we'll work
 
01:26:40.990 --> 01:26:41.000 align:start position:0%
through it so the first in the
 
01:26:44.620 --> 01:26:44.630 align:start position:0%
governor's operating budget is on page
 
01:26:44.630 --> 01:26:45.990 align:start position:0%
governor's operating budget is on page
[Music]

01:26:45.990 --> 01:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:26:51.870 --> 01:26:51.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:55.310 --> 01:26:55.320 align:start position:0%
7935 the second accounting unit if you
 
01:26:57.990 --> 01:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
turn a few pages
 
01:27:02.230 --> 01:27:02.240 align:start position:0%
forward is on page
 
01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:03.350 align:start position:0%
forward is on page
[Music]

01:27:03.350 --> 01:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:27:05.669 --> 01:27:05.679 align:start position:0%
1,61 again
 
01:27:09.229 --> 01:27:09.239 align:start position:0%
1,61 and it's accounting unit
 
01:27:09.239 --> 01:27:11.669 align:start position:0%
1,61 and it's accounting unit
66

01:27:11.669 --> 01:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
66
 
01:27:16.510 --> 01:27:16.520 align:start position:0%
37 and if you open up the budget
 
01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:18.590 align:start position:0%
37 and if you open up the budget
briefing

01:27:18.590 --> 01:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
briefing
 
01:27:22.590 --> 01:27:22.600 align:start position:0%
book it will be on
 
01:27:45.910 --> 01:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:50.590 --> 01:27:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:52.950 align:start position:0%
 
it

01:27:52.950 --> 01:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:27:59.709 --> 01:27:59.719 align:start position:0%
no cu 14 thank you it's 14 7935 yes and
 
01:28:02.189 --> 01:28:02.199 align:start position:0%
then there's another one another page
 
01:28:02.199 --> 01:28:03.390 align:start position:0%
then there's another one another page
for

01:28:03.390 --> 01:28:03.400 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:28:06.510 --> 01:28:06.520 align:start position:0%
6637 I'll find it
 
01:28:09.270 --> 01:28:09.280 align:start position:0%
go so we'll get started while Nathan is
 
01:28:10.830 --> 01:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
looking for the second page of the
 
01:28:13.270 --> 01:28:13.280 align:start position:0%
budget briefing book good morning my
 
01:28:15.310 --> 01:28:15.320 align:start position:0%
name is Meredith tus I'm the director of
 
01:28:16.870 --> 01:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
our division of program quality and
 
01:28:18.910 --> 01:28:18.920 align:start position:0%
integrity for the
 
01:28:20.870 --> 01:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
Department uh and I'm going to go
 
01:28:23.030 --> 01:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
through our presentation I'm not going
 
01:28:24.550 --> 01:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
to read you all the slides slides but
 
01:28:25.830 --> 01:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
I'll be giving you kind of an overview
 
01:28:27.590 --> 01:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
and orientation to the information on
 
01:28:28.990 --> 01:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
each of the slides knowing that those
 
01:28:30.629 --> 01:28:30.639 align:start position:0%
are sort of reference materials you can
 
01:28:34.270 --> 01:28:34.280 align:start position:0%
go back to so starting on slide
 
01:28:38.109 --> 01:28:38.119 align:start position:0%
two of the presentation our role as a
 
01:28:40.070 --> 01:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
division is to provide support to
 
01:28:42.550 --> 01:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
Department programs to measure and
 
01:28:45.270 --> 01:28:45.280 align:start position:0%
Achieve quality and maintain Integrity
 
01:28:48.390 --> 01:28:48.400 align:start position:0%
in their day-to-day work so we are a
 
01:28:50.669 --> 01:28:50.679 align:start position:0%
support division is really one of the
 
01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
most important uh components of our
 
01:28:55.510 --> 01:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
division we exist in order to support
 
01:28:57.709 --> 01:28:57.719 align:start position:0%
all of the other divisions and the
 
01:29:01.070 --> 01:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
programs and functions that they are are
 
01:29:03.310 --> 01:29:03.320 align:start position:0%
doing in order to directly impact the
 
01:29:04.390 --> 01:29:04.400 align:start position:0%
people of New
 
01:29:06.430 --> 01:29:06.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's really our role in the
 
01:29:08.149 --> 01:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
department and the way in which we do
 
01:29:10.070 --> 01:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
that is described in detail on slides
 
01:29:13.350 --> 01:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
three and four so moving to slide
 
01:29:16.109 --> 01:29:16.119 align:start position:0%
three can can I ask you a question there
 
01:29:18.070 --> 01:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
y go ahead please okay so in the
 
01:29:20.070 --> 01:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
division of finance they also have an
 
01:29:22.950 --> 01:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
audit function do do you perform
 
01:29:25.669 --> 01:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
different types of audits how how how do
 
01:29:27.990 --> 01:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
we maintain a distinction go
 
01:29:32.669 --> 01:29:32.679 align:start position:0%
ahead no you go ahead sure so when I say
 
01:29:34.390 --> 01:29:34.400 align:start position:0%
audit it's different from the audit
 
01:29:36.149 --> 01:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
function that Meritt is going to talk
 
01:29:39.430 --> 01:29:39.440 align:start position:0%
about what we do for audit is we work
 
01:29:42.270 --> 01:29:42.280 align:start position:0%
with um the the various Auditors it
 
01:29:45.189 --> 01:29:45.199 align:start position:0%
might be the LBA it might be a federal
 
01:29:47.790 --> 01:29:47.800 align:start position:0%
audit it might be the single audit uh
 
01:29:49.790 --> 01:29:49.800 align:start position:0%
the team Works closely with the Auditors
 
01:29:52.550 --> 01:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
to prepare and Meritus team to prepare
 
01:29:55.070 --> 01:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
the documents um for their requests and
 
01:29:56.830 --> 01:29:56.840 align:start position:0%
work them work with them on any finding
 
01:29:58.350 --> 01:29:58.360 align:start position:0%
potential findings or
 
01:30:01.149 --> 01:30:01.159 align:start position:0%
recommendations so I I will describe it
 
01:30:05.189 --> 01:30:05.199 align:start position:0%
but we do audits in my division we also
 
01:30:08.950 --> 01:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
work as a liaison when we get audits so
 
01:30:11.070 --> 01:30:11.080 align:start position:0%
when there's an external entity doing a
 
01:30:13.629 --> 01:30:13.639 align:start position:0%
review of the department my team would
 
01:30:15.470 --> 01:30:15.480 align:start position:0%
work as a liaison to make sure that the
 
01:30:16.910 --> 01:30:16.920 align:start position:0%
documentation that's being given to the
 
01:30:18.390 --> 01:30:18.400 align:start position:0%
Auditors is the right kind of
 
01:30:20.390 --> 01:30:20.400 align:start position:0%
documentation that they're requesting we
 
01:30:21.750 --> 01:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
kind of think of ourselves as people who
 
01:30:23.790 --> 01:30:23.800 align:start position:0%
speak audit so when an auditor comes and
 
01:30:25.510 --> 01:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
says I need something from you we're
 
01:30:26.669 --> 01:30:26.679 align:start position:0%
going to look at the documentation and
 
01:30:28.189 --> 01:30:28.199 align:start position:0%
say yeah this is what they're asking for
 
01:30:29.430 --> 01:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
or no no no you haven't gotten what
 
01:30:31.229 --> 01:30:31.239 align:start position:0%
they're asking for actually and then
 
01:30:33.390 --> 01:30:33.400 align:start position:0%
when we get reports we'll actually go
 
01:30:35.350 --> 01:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
through the report with the audit the
 
01:30:37.550 --> 01:30:37.560 align:start position:0%
audit being probably Nathan's team and
 
01:30:38.590 --> 01:30:38.600 align:start position:0%
say all right how are you going to
 
01:30:40.350 --> 01:30:40.360 align:start position:0%
respond to the these findings how are
 
01:30:41.990 --> 01:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
you going to mitigate these
 
01:30:45.189 --> 01:30:45.199 align:start position:0%
findings and and okay and so implied in
 
01:30:48.470 --> 01:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
that is if you have previous Audits and
 
01:30:51.629 --> 01:30:51.639 align:start position:0%
you've got findings and you have open
 
01:30:54.030 --> 01:30:54.040 align:start position:0%
findings you're the one actively
 
01:30:56.830 --> 01:30:56.840 align:start position:0%
managing the closure of a finding that's
 
01:30:58.870 --> 01:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
right all right it's exactly
 
01:31:01.550 --> 01:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
right slide
 
01:31:04.310 --> 01:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
three one of our primary functions is
 
01:31:06.830 --> 01:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
data management and Analysis so we
 
01:31:08.870 --> 01:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
manage data sets and we work with others
 
01:31:10.709 --> 01:31:10.719 align:start position:0%
across the department and external
 
01:31:13.189 --> 01:31:13.199 align:start position:0%
stakeholders to ensure that our data as
 
01:31:17.629 --> 01:31:17.639 align:start position:0%
a department is clean clear actionable
 
01:31:19.390 --> 01:31:19.400 align:start position:0%
and correctly interpreted by those who
 
01:31:21.870 --> 01:31:21.880 align:start position:0%
are using it to make decisions for
 
01:31:24.629 --> 01:31:24.639 align:start position:0%
example we manage the mqi Medicaid
 
01:31:27.229 --> 01:31:27.239 align:start position:0%
quality information system uh which
 
01:31:29.149 --> 01:31:29.159 align:start position:0%
reports on hundreds of Medicaid quality
 
01:31:32.390 --> 01:31:32.400 align:start position:0%
metrics we also work on Medicaid waivers
 
01:31:35.830 --> 01:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
um the evaluations of those uh we work
 
01:31:38.629 --> 01:31:38.639 align:start position:0%
on Behavioral Health and sud data
 
01:31:40.510 --> 01:31:40.520 align:start position:0%
develop and we we help develop
 
01:31:42.270 --> 01:31:42.280 align:start position:0%
performance metrics for any kind of
 
01:31:43.709 --> 01:31:43.719 align:start position:0%
individual program but a lot of our
 
01:31:45.189 --> 01:31:45.199 align:start position:0%
Focus areas are Medicaid Behavioral
 
01:31:46.709 --> 01:31:46.719 align:start position:0%
Health and
 
01:31:49.390 --> 01:31:49.400 align:start position:0%
sud we also designed methods for vendor
 
01:31:51.390 --> 01:31:51.400 align:start position:0%
and contract management both
 
01:31:54.310 --> 01:31:54.320 align:start position:0%
programmatic and financial uh and that's
 
01:31:56.830 --> 01:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
and we also develop Audits and reviews
 
01:31:58.910 --> 01:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
for our contractors and vendors that are
 
01:32:01.229 --> 01:32:01.239 align:start position:0%
both programmatic and financial and in
 
01:32:03.709 --> 01:32:03.719 align:start position:0%
some cases we do those reviews ourselves
 
01:32:05.149 --> 01:32:05.159 align:start position:0%
and in other instances we're just
 
01:32:07.310 --> 01:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
helping to develop the tools and the
 
01:32:09.189 --> 01:32:09.199 align:start position:0%
platform and then working with program
 
01:32:11.149 --> 01:32:11.159 align:start position:0%
areas so that they can go and do those
 
01:32:13.629 --> 01:32:13.639 align:start position:0%
kinds of reviews
 
01:32:16.070 --> 01:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
themselves slide
 
01:32:18.910 --> 01:32:18.920 align:start position:0%
four we conduct a number of activities
 
01:32:21.189 --> 01:32:21.199 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of federal compliance um
 
01:32:23.149 --> 01:32:23.159 align:start position:0%
that includes internal audits or reviews
 
01:32:25.669 --> 01:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
that were required to do per Federal
 
01:32:28.270 --> 01:32:28.280 align:start position:0%
Regulation um such as the Medicaid
 
01:32:31.070 --> 01:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
Eligibility quality control audit uh
 
01:32:33.510 --> 01:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
Child Care reviews uh what's called our
 
01:32:35.669 --> 01:32:35.679 align:start position:0%
quality assurance reviews and our
 
01:32:37.189 --> 01:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
special investigations unit I'll go into
 
01:32:39.270 --> 01:32:39.280 align:start position:0%
more detail on what they do when I get
 
01:32:41.310 --> 01:32:41.320 align:start position:0%
to the descriptions of our individual
 
01:32:43.189 --> 01:32:43.199 align:start position:0%
Bureau activities but those are just
 
01:32:46.669 --> 01:32:46.679 align:start position:0%
some examples I I want to develop the
 
01:32:50.590 --> 01:32:50.600 align:start position:0%
mental picture in my head around what a
 
01:32:52.910 --> 01:32:52.920 align:start position:0%
compliance methodology would be for
 
01:32:55.790 --> 01:32:55.800 align:start position:0%
federal and state laws regulations and
 
01:32:58.629 --> 01:32:58.639 align:start position:0%
guidance I'm assuming some kind of thing
 
01:33:00.709 --> 01:33:00.719 align:start position:0%
that looks like an Excel spreadsheet
 
01:33:03.590 --> 01:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
with 10,000 line items on it that you
 
01:33:06.870 --> 01:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
have to comply with 10,000 requirements
 
01:33:09.189 --> 01:33:09.199 align:start position:0%
and you've got a source of why it's a
 
01:33:11.470 --> 01:33:11.480 align:start position:0%
requirement and you've got some sort of
 
01:33:13.629 --> 01:33:13.639 align:start position:0%
inspection date where you verified it
 
01:33:15.510 --> 01:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
and whether or not we're in compliance
 
01:33:18.109 --> 01:33:18.119 align:start position:0%
or we got a problem is it is it is it
 
01:33:21.070 --> 01:33:21.080 align:start position:0%
that mechanical or is it more elegant it
 
01:33:23.830 --> 01:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
it it's by program area so for examp
 
01:33:28.070 --> 01:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
example for Medicaid we work on the perm
 
01:33:30.070 --> 01:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
audit which is the payment error rate
 
01:33:33.189 --> 01:33:33.199 align:start position:0%
methodology audit so we have Auditors
 
01:33:34.790 --> 01:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
that come into the state and they're
 
01:33:37.430 --> 01:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
looking at both eligibility and claims
 
01:33:39.189 --> 01:33:39.199 align:start position:0%
one by one they do they have a sampling
 
01:33:41.030 --> 01:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
methodology that they use and then we're
 
01:33:43.390 --> 01:33:43.400 align:start position:0%
working with them on the outcome of that
 
01:33:45.270 --> 01:33:45.280 align:start position:0%
in order to make sure that we're in
 
01:33:47.470 --> 01:33:47.480 align:start position:0%
compliance for each of their findings
 
01:33:49.430 --> 01:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
for the mqc that's an audit that we do
 
01:33:52.070 --> 01:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
ourselves that's Medicaid Eligibility
 
01:33:55.470 --> 01:33:55.480 align:start position:0%
quality and for that it it is similar
 
01:33:57.830 --> 01:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
for child care and for it it depends on
 
01:33:59.470 --> 01:33:59.480 align:start position:0%
the review that we're doing but yes
 
01:34:01.390 --> 01:34:01.400 align:start position:0%
there are Excel spreadsheets involved
 
01:34:03.109 --> 01:34:03.119 align:start position:0%
where we take samples of individual
 
01:34:04.870 --> 01:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
cases and payments we go through and we
 
01:34:06.430 --> 01:34:06.440 align:start position:0%
say what was done correctly what was not
 
01:34:08.270 --> 01:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
done correctly and then we have to feed
 
01:34:10.149 --> 01:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
the information back to the program area
 
01:34:11.830 --> 01:34:11.840 align:start position:0%
to say here's where you need to make
 
01:34:13.830 --> 01:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
adjustments it may or may not be a
 
01:34:15.870 --> 01:34:15.880 align:start position:0%
report that we then have to report to
 
01:34:18.750 --> 01:34:18.760 align:start position:0%
the feds um so we' take our Excel
 
01:34:20.550 --> 01:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet package it into a report and
 
01:34:22.629 --> 01:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
tell the feds this isn't what we found
 
01:34:24.350 --> 01:34:24.360 align:start position:0%
but in any instance we would go back to
 
01:34:26.109 --> 01:34:26.119 align:start position:0%
the program area and say this is what we
 
01:34:27.550 --> 01:34:27.560 align:start position:0%
found and here are the changes you need
 
01:34:30.870 --> 01:34:30.880 align:start position:0%
to make to be in compliance uh would you
 
01:34:33.870 --> 01:34:33.880 align:start position:0%
ever or have you ever taken a look at
 
01:34:36.430 --> 01:34:36.440 align:start position:0%
the state compliance requirements and
 
01:34:39.030 --> 01:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
gone to the legislature to ask for
 
01:34:41.950 --> 01:34:41.960 align:start position:0%
relief of compliance measures that don't
 
01:34:43.590 --> 01:34:43.600 align:start position:0%
really add
 
01:34:46.870 --> 01:34:46.880 align:start position:0%
value we would do that as part of an
 
01:34:48.709 --> 01:34:48.719 align:start position:0%
internal AUD I mean I think on a case-by
 
01:34:50.510 --> 01:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
casee basis program areas do that on a
 
01:34:52.310 --> 01:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
regular basis because program areas are
 
01:34:54.430 --> 01:34:54.440 align:start position:0%
constantly looking at what they're doing
 
01:34:55.669 --> 01:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
and whether or not they have the
 
01:34:57.590 --> 01:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
resources to comply with their
 
01:35:00.229 --> 01:35:00.239 align:start position:0%
requirements right I think we have an
 
01:35:04.870 --> 01:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
appetite to get uh more get less
 
01:35:08.470 --> 01:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
compliant facing requirements to you and
 
01:35:10.990 --> 01:35:11.000 align:start position:0%
and and to to give to liberate the
 
01:35:13.910 --> 01:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
department increase flexibility as long
 
01:35:17.950 --> 01:35:17.960 align:start position:0%
as it isn't violating you know U patient
 
01:35:20.709 --> 01:35:20.719 align:start position:0%
privacy or you know so so you're the one
 
01:35:22.910 --> 01:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
that's buried deep in that mud and if
 
01:35:25.470 --> 01:35:25.480 align:start position:0%
you ever see things that we're doing
 
01:35:28.030 --> 01:35:28.040 align:start position:0%
that just doesn't really add value would
 
01:35:30.030 --> 01:35:30.040 align:start position:0%
you would you please bring them forward
 
01:35:31.709 --> 01:35:31.719 align:start position:0%
we certainly would and and like I said I
 
01:35:33.390 --> 01:35:33.400 align:start position:0%
think program areas do that on their own
 
01:35:35.149 --> 01:35:35.159 align:start position:0%
as well the legislation that we bring
 
01:35:36.910 --> 01:35:36.920 align:start position:0%
forward every year is intended to
 
01:35:39.790 --> 01:35:39.800 align:start position:0%
improve our our capabilities there also
 
01:35:41.750 --> 01:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
say you know our LBA audits make
 
01:35:43.990 --> 01:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
recommendations and we look at those Rec
 
01:35:46.350 --> 01:35:46.360 align:start position:0%
for sometimes for uh changes to
 
01:35:48.870 --> 01:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
legislation and we look to those and and
 
01:35:50.350 --> 01:35:50.360 align:start position:0%
would find sponsors and bring things
 
01:35:51.950 --> 01:35:51.960 align:start position:0%
forward where we think it's appropriate
 
01:35:54.310 --> 01:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
super who who has a question over here
 
01:35:56.430 --> 01:35:56.440 align:start position:0%
represent thank you chairman and thank
 
01:35:59.470 --> 01:35:59.480 align:start position:0%
you for taking the question so on page
 
01:36:04.629 --> 01:36:04.639 align:start position:0%
three it refers to Quality Medicaid data
 
01:36:07.709 --> 01:36:07.719 align:start position:0%
so um you know excuse me if I'm kind of
 
01:36:10.830 --> 01:36:10.840 align:start position:0%
naive on the whole issue of you know
 
01:36:12.870 --> 01:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
data so you're relying on the accuracy
 
01:36:18.030 --> 01:36:18.040 align:start position:0%
of a of a Medicaid database or um and to
 
01:36:21.109 --> 01:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
the extent that uh there are may be
 
01:36:23.229 --> 01:36:23.239 align:start position:0%
problems with that what what does that
 
01:36:24.830 --> 01:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
what kind the problems is that pose at
 
01:36:25.910 --> 01:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:36:29.430 --> 01:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
level so we're relying on a couple
 
01:36:31.350 --> 01:36:31.360 align:start position:0%
different areas we have our Medicaid
 
01:36:33.709 --> 01:36:33.719 align:start position:0%
encounter data that comes directly from
 
01:36:35.550 --> 01:36:35.560 align:start position:0%
our Managed Care organizations that's
 
01:36:38.310 --> 01:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
our that's our encounter our claims data
 
01:36:40.750 --> 01:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
is used to build out our Medicaid
 
01:36:43.149 --> 01:36:43.159 align:start position:0%
quality metrics and I may call on Susan
 
01:36:45.590 --> 01:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
drown uh our bureau chief for the Bureau
 
01:36:46.990 --> 01:36:47.000 align:start position:0%
of program quality to see if she has
 
01:36:48.310 --> 01:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
anything to
 
01:36:51.390 --> 01:36:51.400 align:start position:0%
add do you want to add to this question
 
01:36:54.790 --> 01:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
Ju Just repeat or answer
 
01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:55.830 align:start position:0%
Ju Just repeat or answer
go

01:36:55.830 --> 01:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
go
 
01:36:55.840 --> 01:37:00.830 align:start position:0%
go
ahead

01:37:00.830 --> 01:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:04.390 --> 01:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
yeah good morning Susan drown you have
 
01:37:07.310 --> 01:37:07.320 align:start position:0%
that you have to put that in the
 
01:37:10.750 --> 01:37:10.760 align:start position:0%
record he is in Delta R
 
01:37:12.830 --> 01:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
WN I'm the director of the Bureau of
 
01:37:15.590 --> 01:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
program quality so the the the Medicaid
 
01:37:17.669 --> 01:37:17.679 align:start position:0%
data that's coming in just to be clear
 
01:37:19.870 --> 01:37:19.880 align:start position:0%
on what that's referencing is to the
 
01:37:22.390 --> 01:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
Managed Care Organization data that gets
 
01:37:24.709 --> 01:37:24.719 align:start position:0%
submitted and then it gets filtered into
 
01:37:26.830 --> 01:37:26.840 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid quality information system
 
01:37:29.189 --> 01:37:29.199 align:start position:0%
that's public
 
01:37:31.669 --> 01:37:31.679 align:start position:0%
facing so is there a question on the
 
01:37:35.030 --> 01:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
accuracy of the data yes could you get
 
01:37:37.990 --> 01:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
the mic really close to your mouth sure
 
01:37:40.589 --> 01:37:40.599 align:start position:0%
absolutely so we have quality control
 
01:37:42.070 --> 01:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
and quality assurance when the data
 
01:37:43.830 --> 01:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
comes in we look at it but also the
 
01:37:45.030 --> 01:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
Managed Care
 
01:37:47.910 --> 01:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
organizations um are also authorized to
 
01:37:50.510 --> 01:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
do their own and required to do their
 
01:37:53.189 --> 01:37:53.199 align:start position:0%
own data validation much of that data
 
01:37:56.830 --> 01:37:56.840 align:start position:0%
gets submitted to to CMS every year so
 
01:37:58.109 --> 01:37:58.119 align:start position:0%
they have an independent company that
 
01:38:01.189 --> 01:38:01.199 align:start position:0%
comes in the manag care organizations do
 
01:38:04.790 --> 01:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
to Ure the the reliability of their data
 
01:38:07.149 --> 01:38:07.159 align:start position:0%
yep so it's it's a great question I will
 
01:38:09.030 --> 01:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
say that when we first started our
 
01:38:12.030 --> 01:38:12.040 align:start position:0%
Managed Care Program there was an issue
 
01:38:14.629 --> 01:38:14.639 align:start position:0%
with I think one particular vendor's um
 
01:38:16.229 --> 01:38:16.239 align:start position:0%
accuracy of their encounter data and it
 
01:38:19.310 --> 01:38:19.320 align:start position:0%
took a few years to work that out but uh
 
01:38:21.550 --> 01:38:21.560 align:start position:0%
we have a very very diligent individual
 
01:38:23.149 --> 01:38:23.159 align:start position:0%
who worked with them for that period of
 
01:38:26.470 --> 01:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
time and and to this at this point we
 
01:38:27.990 --> 01:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
are confident in the accuracy of that
 
01:38:30.189 --> 01:38:30.199 align:start position:0%
data we also do have a uh what's
 
01:38:33.750 --> 01:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
referred to as an eqro an external EQ
 
01:38:35.790 --> 01:38:35.800 align:start position:0%
external quality review
 
01:38:38.070 --> 01:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
organization um an EQ which is which is
 
01:38:40.709 --> 01:38:40.719 align:start position:0%
a federally required review process that
 
01:38:43.830 --> 01:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
looks at that data for accuracy and
 
01:38:46.149 --> 01:38:46.159 align:start position:0%
they're a vendor of of ours not of the
 
01:38:48.870 --> 01:38:48.880 align:start position:0%
Managed Care organizations okay thanks
 
01:38:51.310 --> 01:38:51.320 align:start position:0%
thanks for the response sure as long as
 
01:38:54.750 --> 01:38:54.760 align:start position:0%
we're on all that data stuff um um I I
 
01:38:57.990 --> 01:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
assume that by and large your department
 
01:39:00.550 --> 01:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
dabbles in the it systems that are
 
01:39:02.910 --> 01:39:02.920 align:start position:0%
functionally aligned or or do you have a
 
01:39:06.229 --> 01:39:06.239 align:start position:0%
particular it system that that you rely
 
01:39:08.589 --> 01:39:08.599 align:start position:0%
on we have many it systems that we rely
 
01:39:11.830 --> 01:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
on and many places that the data is held
 
01:39:14.189 --> 01:39:14.199 align:start position:0%
primarily belong functionally to other
 
01:39:16.629 --> 01:39:16.639 align:start position:0%
parts of the organization or do you
 
01:39:19.550 --> 01:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
basically are you the owner of any it
 
01:39:22.990 --> 01:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
systems uh I would say that we are it's
 
01:39:25.109 --> 01:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
a bit shared ownership but I would say
 
01:39:27.030 --> 01:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
that we might be the owner of a couple
 
01:39:28.910 --> 01:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
different it systems I'm thinking of
 
01:39:30.589 --> 01:39:30.599 align:start position:0%
Phoenix and witz would you call us the
 
01:39:35.350 --> 01:39:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:39.669 --> 01:39:39.679 align:start position:0%
systems okay but like us as opposed to
 
01:39:42.830 --> 01:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
um it's it belongs to behavioral
 
01:39:48.229 --> 01:39:48.239 align:start position:0%
health okay so we are the we are the
 
01:39:51.310 --> 01:39:51.320 align:start position:0%
data managers of these systems but they
 
01:39:54.550 --> 01:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
are owned by the program areas
 
01:39:58.189 --> 01:39:58.199 align:start position:0%
okay yeah okay and that's that's
 
01:39:59.990 --> 01:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
definitely the case with mmis which is
 
01:40:01.709 --> 01:40:01.719 align:start position:0%
where we do a lot of our work but that's
 
01:40:05.430 --> 01:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
of course owned by Medicaid got it yeah
 
01:40:08.189 --> 01:40:08.199 align:start position:0%
so so so just so we have some time
 
01:40:11.629 --> 01:40:11.639 align:start position:0%
context uh I think we're on track to end
 
01:40:14.990 --> 01:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
by noon right yes definitely okay that's
 
01:40:17.189 --> 01:40:17.199 align:start position:0%
21 minutes
 
01:40:19.470 --> 01:40:19.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely uh
 
01:40:24.030 --> 01:40:24.040 align:start position:0%
slide I think we can skip to slide five
 
01:40:28.189 --> 01:40:28.199 align:start position:0%
five which is a very high level overview
 
01:40:30.430 --> 01:40:30.440 align:start position:0%
of the three functions within the
 
01:40:33.149 --> 01:40:33.159 align:start position:0%
division our office of internal audit
 
01:40:34.589 --> 01:40:34.599 align:start position:0%
Bureau of program quality and Bureau of
 
01:40:38.629 --> 01:40:38.639 align:start position:0%
program integrity and slide six just
 
01:40:40.910 --> 01:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
lists out some key accomplishments of
 
01:40:49.390 --> 01:40:49.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:52.629 --> 01:40:52.639 align:start position:0%
bium uh uh representative priest thank
 
01:40:53.910 --> 01:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
 
01:40:57.430 --> 01:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
how many uh staff do you have in each of
 
01:40:57.440 --> 01:40:58.310 align:start position:0%
how many uh staff do you have in each of
these

01:40:58.310 --> 01:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:41:03.189 --> 01:41:03.199 align:start position:0%
four divisions on on five page five the
 
01:41:04.910 --> 01:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
my position is the director position at
 
01:41:07.510 --> 01:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
the top do you have a deputy I do not
 
01:41:09.629 --> 01:41:09.639 align:start position:0%
okay and then an office of internal
 
01:41:12.629 --> 01:41:12.639 align:start position:0%
audit I have two individuals okay in the
 
01:41:17.189 --> 01:41:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:21.790 --> 01:41:21.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:23.709 --> 01:41:23.719 align:start position:0%
unclassified that doesn't include
 
01:41:26.070 --> 01:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
part-time that's full-time that's
 
01:41:28.070 --> 01:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
full-time do you have a number of
 
01:41:31.310 --> 01:41:31.320 align:start position:0%
part-time we have two one one one in the
 
01:41:33.750 --> 01:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
Bureau of program quality okay and in
 
01:41:38.790 --> 01:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of program Integrity we have
 
01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:40.350 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of program Integrity we have
80

01:41:40.350 --> 01:41:40.360 align:start position:0%
80
 
01:41:43.350 --> 01:41:43.360 align:start position:0%
71 full-time
 
01:41:46.669 --> 01:41:46.679 align:start position:0%
positions and nine part-time how many
 
01:41:48.750 --> 01:41:48.760 align:start position:0%
vacancies do you have
 
01:41:51.550 --> 01:41:51.560 align:start position:0%
currently I don't think I can answer
 
01:41:53.990 --> 01:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
that I I we we would have to get that
 
01:41:56.589 --> 01:41:56.599 align:start position:0%
information there are six unfunded
 
01:42:00.750 --> 01:42:00.760 align:start position:0%
positions six unfunded okay yes three in
 
01:42:02.030 --> 01:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of program integrity and
 
01:42:06.109 --> 01:42:06.119 align:start position:0%
three in the Bureau of program quality
 
01:42:09.390 --> 01:42:09.400 align:start position:0%
unfunded so without telling us a vacancy
 
01:42:11.510 --> 01:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
number because you don't have it are are
 
01:42:11.520 --> 01:42:12.910 align:start position:0%
number because you don't have it are are
you

01:42:12.910 --> 01:42:12.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:42:17.070 --> 01:42:17.080 align:start position:0%
U is your program operation
 
01:42:20.470 --> 01:42:20.480 align:start position:0%
being significantly negatively impacted
 
01:42:24.070 --> 01:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
by a vacancy
 
01:42:26.390 --> 01:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
by the by the UNF funding by the no not
 
01:42:29.750 --> 01:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
the unfund but but just by have your
 
01:42:33.910 --> 01:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
operational vacancy today we we will be
 
01:42:36.870 --> 01:42:36.880 align:start position:0%
if we can't fill those positions the
 
01:42:41.070 --> 01:42:41.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:44.470 --> 01:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
quality are vacant partly because we
 
01:42:47.310 --> 01:42:47.320 align:start position:0%
were sort of remodeling a particular
 
01:42:49.669 --> 01:42:49.679 align:start position:0%
section which we need in order to be
 
01:42:51.189 --> 01:42:51.199 align:start position:0%
able to move forward with our data
 
01:42:53.870 --> 01:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
analytics and Reporting
 
01:42:56.550 --> 01:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
and because some there are some internal
 
01:42:58.070 --> 01:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
moves with that if I'm not going to be
 
01:42:59.470 --> 01:42:59.480 align:start position:0%
able to fill those positions then I'm
 
01:43:01.149 --> 01:43:01.159 align:start position:0%
going to end up for example having an
 
01:43:03.350 --> 01:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
individual who needs to do two jobs and
 
01:43:05.189 --> 01:43:05.199 align:start position:0%
that that's going to be problematic for
 
01:43:07.189 --> 01:43:07.199 align:start position:0%
performance what kind of position is
 
01:43:10.669 --> 01:43:10.679 align:start position:0%
that in general is that a a mid-level p
 
01:43:12.790 --> 01:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
position or is that somebody with steep
 
01:43:15.149 --> 01:43:15.159 align:start position:0%
subject matter expertise this is someone
 
01:43:17.830 --> 01:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
with deep subject matter expertise who
 
01:43:19.790 --> 01:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
has moved into a mid-level manager
 
01:43:21.750 --> 01:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
position and so now I'm I'm not going to
 
01:43:23.629 --> 01:43:23.639 align:start position:0%
be able to backfill her position
 
01:43:25.750 --> 01:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
all right representative Daniels yes and
 
01:43:28.189 --> 01:43:28.199 align:start position:0%
how long have those positions been
 
01:43:30.589 --> 01:43:30.599 align:start position:0%
vacant uh well this one is very recent
 
01:43:33.149 --> 01:43:33.159 align:start position:0%
this person just moved with part these
 
01:43:35.229 --> 01:43:35.239 align:start position:0%
positions were created from positions
 
01:43:37.470 --> 01:43:37.480 align:start position:0%
that we had we used our existing
 
01:43:40.910 --> 01:43:40.920 align:start position:0%
positions and and reorg made a new org
 
01:43:44.109 --> 01:43:44.119 align:start position:0%
structure in order to be able to move
 
01:43:47.310 --> 01:43:47.320 align:start position:0%
forward uh so the positions were created
 
01:43:49.629 --> 01:43:49.639 align:start position:0%
within the last six months or however
 
01:43:51.430 --> 01:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
long it took to create these
 
01:43:54.669 --> 01:43:54.679 align:start position:0%
positions so I I I do have some vacancy
 
01:43:57.430 --> 01:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
data it it's about a month old um this
 
01:43:59.870 --> 01:43:59.880 align:start position:0%
moves every day but the bureau program
 
01:44:03.470 --> 01:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
Integrity um was at about 8.8% Bureau
 
01:44:06.830 --> 01:44:06.840 align:start position:0%
program quality was at about
 
01:44:12.830 --> 01:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:15.310 --> 01:44:15.320 align:start position:0%
ago which is which is lower than the
 
01:44:17.070 --> 01:44:17.080 align:start position:0%
Department's overall average just to be
 
01:44:19.910 --> 01:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
clear as well as the
 
01:44:23.830 --> 01:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
states okay any other uh represent Incas
 
01:44:27.149 --> 01:44:27.159 align:start position:0%
no thank you very much welcome back you
 
01:44:28.510 --> 01:44:28.520 align:start position:0%
have any
 
01:44:31.149 --> 01:44:31.159 align:start position:0%
questions I apologize apparently in
 
01:44:33.270 --> 01:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
ledge edmin they run schedule like the
 
01:44:35.669 --> 01:44:35.679 align:start position:0%
Senate does and squeeze it all in so I
 
01:44:39.430 --> 01:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
apologize thank you um all right you can
 
01:44:42.109 --> 01:44:42.119 align:start position:0%
continue slide
 
01:44:45.750 --> 01:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
six I'll just provide a few highlights
 
01:44:48.109 --> 01:44:48.119 align:start position:0%
off of this page we migrated to a new
 
01:44:50.350 --> 01:44:50.360 align:start position:0%
5-year MCO contract which included
 
01:44:52.030 --> 01:44:52.040 align:start position:0%
reviewing and revising the Quality
 
01:44:54.550 --> 01:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
Reporting measures and writing a new
 
01:44:56.750 --> 01:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
updated quality strategy for the Managed
 
01:44:59.910 --> 01:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
Care Program we established standardized
 
01:45:01.990 --> 01:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
contract assessment tools for each phase
 
01:45:05.470 --> 01:45:05.480 align:start position:0%
of the contract life cycle we closed out
 
01:45:08.229 --> 01:45:08.239 align:start position:0%
four LBA audits in transparent New
 
01:45:10.350 --> 01:45:10.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we reduced the entire
 
01:45:12.149 --> 01:45:12.159 align:start position:0%
backlog of claims and investigations for
 
01:45:14.109 --> 01:45:14.119 align:start position:0%
beneficiary fraud and overpayments to
 
01:45:14.119 --> 01:45:15.030 align:start position:0%
beneficiary fraud and overpayments to
below

01:45:15.030 --> 01:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
below
 
01:45:17.189 --> 01:45:17.199 align:start position:0%
10% uh we also reduced the number of
 
01:45:21.350 --> 01:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
single audit findings from about 23 uh
 
01:45:24.790 --> 01:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
back in like pre-2020 days to just five
 
01:45:27.550 --> 01:45:27.560 align:start position:0%
uh in the most recent audit and working
 
01:45:29.990 --> 01:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
with our Bureau of family assistance we
 
01:45:32.510 --> 01:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
helped them to reduce our snap error
 
01:45:34.430 --> 01:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
rate supplemental nutritious Access
 
01:45:37.709 --> 01:45:37.719 align:start position:0%
program uh error rate to just over 8%
 
01:45:40.430 --> 01:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
which is below the national
 
01:45:43.910 --> 01:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
average slide seven this slide just
 
01:45:45.470 --> 01:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
details some of the functions of our
 
01:45:46.870 --> 01:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
office of internal
 
01:45:49.350 --> 01:45:49.360 align:start position:0%
audit they conduct quality assurance
 
01:45:51.030 --> 01:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
reviews which are reviews looking for
 
01:45:52.990 --> 01:45:53.000 align:start position:0%
areas of risk and making recommendations
 
01:45:55.430 --> 01:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
to reduce risk and improve operational
 
01:45:58.030 --> 01:45:58.040 align:start position:0%
efficiencies they investigate potential
 
01:46:00.390 --> 01:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
fraudulent or unethical Behavior Uh they
 
01:46:02.109 --> 01:46:02.119 align:start position:0%
ensure compliance with transparent New
 
01:46:04.109 --> 01:46:04.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and they act as the liazon for
 
01:46:06.229 --> 01:46:06.239 align:start position:0%
LBA audits so they will track those and
 
01:46:07.910 --> 01:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're responsive during
 
01:46:09.950 --> 01:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
the audit and that we follow up on any
 
01:46:14.430 --> 01:46:14.440 align:start position:0%
findings slide eight so so um
 
01:46:16.669 --> 01:46:16.679 align:start position:0%
investigating potentially fraudulent or
 
01:46:20.910 --> 01:46:20.920 align:start position:0%
unethical behavior um do do you have any
 
01:46:23.669 --> 01:46:23.679 align:start position:0%
uh metrics that you you can share with
 
01:46:27.070 --> 01:46:27.080 align:start position:0%
us to tell us um the results of these
 
01:46:30.510 --> 01:46:30.520 align:start position:0%
kind of Investigations are are we uh how
 
01:46:33.870 --> 01:46:33.880 align:start position:0%
clean are we as a and these are internal
 
01:46:35.790 --> 01:46:35.800 align:start position:0%
these are internal to the department
 
01:46:38.669 --> 01:46:38.679 align:start position:0%
it's not to our vendors correct correct
 
01:46:40.589 --> 01:46:40.599 align:start position:0%
these are internal to the department I
 
01:46:43.430 --> 01:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
can tell you that there are not there
 
01:46:45.990 --> 01:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
are not many investigations every year
 
01:46:49.669 --> 01:46:49.679 align:start position:0%
there are very few and that the general
 
01:46:53.229 --> 01:46:53.239 align:start position:0%
finding is that there was uh what I will
 
01:46:56.070 --> 01:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
characterize as poor judgment rather
 
01:46:59.030 --> 01:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
than fraudulent behavior all
 
01:47:01.510 --> 01:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
right good to
 
01:47:06.229 --> 01:47:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:08.990 --> 01:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
eight the Bureau of program Integrity
 
01:47:12.750 --> 01:47:12.760 align:start position:0%
consists of six individual units uh and
 
01:47:15.149 --> 01:47:15.159 align:start position:0%
a supporting administrative section each
 
01:47:17.470 --> 01:47:17.480 align:start position:0%
unit there has a unique function but
 
01:47:19.109 --> 01:47:19.119 align:start position:0%
they're all aligned in that they provide
 
01:47:20.669 --> 01:47:20.679 align:start position:0%
oversight and guidance to our program
 
01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
areas to ensure uh operation and
 
01:47:25.830 --> 01:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
financial compliance or to reduce fraud
 
01:47:28.510 --> 01:47:28.520 align:start position:0%
or to minimize waste so we do this by
 
01:47:30.109 --> 01:47:30.119 align:start position:0%
working with our our program areas
 
01:47:31.629 --> 01:47:31.639 align:start position:0%
working with our external stakeholders
 
01:47:33.669 --> 01:47:33.679 align:start position:0%
and working with our federal partners
 
01:47:35.470 --> 01:47:35.480 align:start position:0%
and the special investigations unit
 
01:47:37.430 --> 01:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
establishes claims for overpayments and
 
01:47:39.189 --> 01:47:39.199 align:start position:0%
they investigate potential beneficiary
 
01:47:41.470 --> 01:47:41.480 align:start position:0%
or member fraud our program Integrity
 
01:47:44.510 --> 01:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
unit works with our mcos to the Managed

Care organizations to analyze claims for
 
01:47:48.430 --> 01:47:48.440 align:start position:0%
potential fraud waste and abuse and
 
01:47:50.910 --> 01:47:50.920 align:start position:0%
recover overpayments our Medicaid
 
01:47:53.270 --> 01:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
provider enrollment unit conducts site
 
01:47:55.149 --> 01:47:55.159 align:start position:0%
visits and they do background checks and
 
01:47:57.550 --> 01:47:57.560 align:start position:0%
screenings for provider owners and
 
01:47:59.870 --> 01:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
managing directors to ensure um
 
01:48:02.430 --> 01:48:02.440 align:start position:0%
Integrity of the Medicaid Program our
 
01:48:05.149 --> 01:48:05.159 align:start position:0%
thirdparty liability unit uh also works
 
01:48:06.350 --> 01:48:06.360 align:start position:0%
very closely with our Managed Care
 
01:48:08.030 --> 01:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
organizations to ensure Medicaid's the
 
01:48:10.470 --> 01:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
pair of Last Resort our quality
 
01:48:12.350 --> 01:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
assurance unit conducts reviews of snap
 
01:48:15.510 --> 01:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
eligibility determinations for accuracy
 
01:48:17.109 --> 01:48:17.119 align:start position:0%
and our financial Compliance Unit
 
01:48:19.510 --> 01:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
completes financial analysis including
 
01:48:22.229 --> 01:48:22.239 align:start position:0%
audits or reviews of of our providers
 
01:48:23.550 --> 01:48:23.560 align:start position:0%
and then works with with program areas
 
01:48:25.109 --> 01:48:25.119 align:start position:0%
to strengthen our response to Federal
 
01:48:26.669 --> 01:48:26.679 align:start position:0%
Audits and then we have an
 
01:48:29.310 --> 01:48:29.320 align:start position:0%
administrative support unit and they um
 
01:48:31.470 --> 01:48:31.480 align:start position:0%
take payment on recoveries and they
 
01:48:33.950 --> 01:48:33.960 align:start position:0%
assist with all areas of data
 
01:48:36.750 --> 01:48:36.760 align:start position:0%
analysis for that Bureau so so I'm
 
01:48:38.910 --> 01:48:38.920 align:start position:0%
interested in all of these but these
 
01:48:41.669 --> 01:48:41.679 align:start position:0%
first the top two uh kind of jump out at
 
01:48:44.910 --> 01:48:44.920 align:start position:0%
me special investigations and and
 
01:48:47.669 --> 01:48:47.679 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program Integrity I I think
 
01:48:50.589 --> 01:48:50.599 align:start position:0%
other states periodically report you
 
01:48:53.910 --> 01:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
know massive findings of fraud
 
01:48:56.870 --> 01:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
and I just wonder where where you think
 
01:49:00.390 --> 01:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Stacks in terms of of um
 
01:49:02.950 --> 01:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
put the what we what we would perceive
 
01:49:07.109 --> 01:49:07.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:09.669 --> 01:49:09.679 align:start position:0%
fraud uh I know that we we punch above
 
01:49:12.390 --> 01:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
our weight in terms of recoveries and
 
01:49:16.870 --> 01:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
investigations in that we we don't do uh
 
01:49:20.270 --> 01:49:20.280 align:start position:0%
we find potential fraud and then we make
 
01:49:21.629 --> 01:49:21.639 align:start position:0%
the referral to the Department of
 
01:49:24.109 --> 01:49:24.119 align:start position:0%
Justice Medicaid fraud control unit and
 
01:49:26.470 --> 01:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid fraud control unit in every
 
01:49:28.390 --> 01:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
state is responsible for actually
 
01:49:30.310 --> 01:49:30.320 align:start position:0%
investigating and pursuing
 
01:49:34.910 --> 01:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
fraud in New Hampshire uh they have um I
 
01:49:37.550 --> 01:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
think they are less funded compared to
 
01:49:40.350 --> 01:49:40.360 align:start position:0%
the scale of the Medicaid Program but in
 
01:49:43.709 --> 01:49:43.719 align:start position:0%
the last uh three or four years they
 
01:49:47.629 --> 01:49:47.639 align:start position:0%
have had a number of uh criminal
 
01:49:50.629 --> 01:49:50.639 align:start position:0%
convictions and also uh civil civil
 
01:49:52.310 --> 01:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
penalties and recoveries and I'm going
 
01:49:53.709 --> 01:49:53.719 align:start position:0%
to look at Franchesca Hennessy to make
 
01:49:56.070 --> 01:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
sure see if she has anything to
 
01:49:58.270 --> 01:49:58.280 align:start position:0%
add in terms
 
01:50:01.629 --> 01:50:01.639 align:start position:0%
of you have a seat at the end and uh
 
01:50:04.669 --> 01:50:04.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:06.430 --> 01:50:06.440 align:start position:0%
red good
 
01:50:09.470 --> 01:50:09.480 align:start position:0%
morning my name is Franchesca Hennessy I
 
01:50:12.070 --> 01:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
work under Meredith too I'm the fraud
 
01:50:14.790 --> 01:50:14.800 align:start position:0%
waste and abuse administrator so program
 
01:50:16.830 --> 01:50:16.840 align:start position:0%
Integrity which is our Medicaid provider
 
01:50:18.950 --> 01:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
Fraud Unit falls under me which I think
 
01:50:20.629 --> 01:50:20.639 align:start position:0%
is what you were asking about and yes
 
01:50:24.470 --> 01:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
there is uh fraud that we've identified
 
01:50:27.629 --> 01:50:27.639 align:start position:0%
um mostly in certain areas we
 
01:50:30.109 --> 01:50:30.119 align:start position:0%
investigate it we refer it to the um
 
01:50:31.830 --> 01:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office which Meredith
 
01:50:33.870 --> 01:50:33.880 align:start position:0%
referenced um and they've had a number
 
01:50:35.629 --> 01:50:35.639 align:start position:0%
of large
 
01:50:38.669 --> 01:50:38.679 align:start position:0%
recoveries okay so so a question that's
 
01:50:41.270 --> 01:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
not an official answer but what is in
 
01:50:44.310 --> 01:50:44.320 align:start position:0%
your gut what what sort of percentage of
 
01:50:47.589 --> 01:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
our Medicaid spend do you think may be
 
01:50:51.030 --> 01:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
going out in in in probable fraudulent
 
01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:52.950 align:start position:0%
going out in in in probable fraudulent
manners

01:50:52.950 --> 01:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
manners
 
01:50:54.470 --> 01:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
honestly I don't feel comfortable giving
 
01:50:56.350 --> 01:50:56.360 align:start position:0%
a percentage however I can give you some
 
01:50:59.669 --> 01:50:59.679 align:start position:0%
solid information we have 50 around 50
 
01:51:02.069 --> 01:51:02.079 align:start position:0%
cases at the Medicaid fraud control unit
 
01:51:03.830 --> 01:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
right now that they're investigating and
 
01:51:05.470 --> 01:51:05.480 align:start position:0%
that's cases that we manag that were
 
01:51:09.030 --> 01:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
coming from the mcos that we've
 
01:51:11.510 --> 01:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
investigated from our feif for service
 
01:51:14.149 --> 01:51:14.159 align:start position:0%
program so cases um that weren't paid
 
01:51:17.669 --> 01:51:17.679 align:start position:0%
through our mcos so that's 50 providers
 
01:51:20.470 --> 01:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
I mean we have over 30,000 providers in
 
01:51:22.870 --> 01:51:22.880 align:start position:0%
the whole Medicaid Program so it's not a
 
01:51:25.510 --> 01:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
huge number but the amount of recoveries
 
01:51:28.109 --> 01:51:28.119 align:start position:0%
that we will recover from our closed
 
01:51:30.109 --> 01:51:30.119 align:start position:0%
cases show that there are large
 
01:51:32.470 --> 01:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
recoveries and fraud does happen I don't
 
01:51:34.390 --> 01:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
know if that helps at all there are many
 
01:51:35.910 --> 01:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
if I can just add some context there are
 
01:51:38.709 --> 01:51:38.719 align:start position:0%
many many more instances of what we
 
01:51:41.109 --> 01:51:41.119 align:start position:0%
would refer to as waste or abuse over
 
01:51:43.390 --> 01:51:43.400 align:start position:0%
payments and that's where a lot of the
 
01:51:46.790 --> 01:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
money is so this is an instance of poor
 
01:51:49.149 --> 01:51:49.159 align:start position:0%
billing practices at a provider we
 
01:51:51.470 --> 01:51:51.480 align:start position:0%
identify that we stop it from happening
 
01:51:53.310 --> 01:51:53.320 align:start position:0%
and we recover the money
 
01:51:58.910 --> 01:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:01.709 --> 01:52:01.719 align:start position:0%
millions Mr W could you remind me what
 
01:52:04.109 --> 01:52:04.119 align:start position:0%
what the uh the total spend on Medicaid
 
01:52:08.709 --> 01:52:08.719 align:start position:0%
is for a year that it's a bunch of money
 
01:52:12.470 --> 01:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
it it depends how you count it um but in
 
01:52:14.750 --> 01:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
in the Medicaid budget if I recall
 
01:52:18.069 --> 01:52:18.079 align:start position:0%
correctly for the for the banum it was
 
01:52:22.510 --> 01:52:22.520 align:start position:0%
2.7 billion just shot 2.7 billion in the
 
01:52:24.470 --> 01:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
Governor's operating budget so so
 
01:52:26.310 --> 01:52:26.320 align:start position:0%
Meredith you're you're speaking in terms
 
01:52:30.310 --> 01:52:30.320 align:start position:0%
of millions M which makes it imply that
 
01:52:33.470 --> 01:52:33.480 align:start position:0%
it's a relatively small percentage it's
 
01:52:35.950 --> 01:52:35.960 align:start position:0%
5% maybe or less are you kind of
 
01:52:38.709 --> 01:52:38.719 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that characterization
 
01:52:42.550 --> 01:52:42.560 align:start position:0%
yes okay you're doing God's work thank
 
01:52:44.510 --> 01:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
you thank you the staff really is
 
01:52:45.990 --> 01:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
they're very enthus we have a very
 
01:52:48.550 --> 01:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
enthusiastic staff who investigates both
 
01:52:50.430 --> 01:52:50.440 align:start position:0%
on the member side and the provider side
 
01:52:53.350 --> 01:52:53.360 align:start position:0%
so you guys enjoy busting people good
 
01:52:56.270 --> 01:52:56.280 align:start position:0%
well they enoy they enjoy ensuring the
 
01:52:58.109 --> 01:52:58.119 align:start position:0%
Integrity of the program and that money
 
01:52:59.910 --> 01:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
is going where it's supposed to go thank
 
01:53:02.470 --> 01:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
you so much service all
 
01:53:05.669 --> 01:53:05.679 align:start position:0%
right slide nine is just a graphic
 
01:53:07.229 --> 01:53:07.239 align:start position:0%
representation that we created so that
 
01:53:07.239 --> 01:53:08.149 align:start position:0%
representation that we created so that
you

01:53:08.149 --> 01:53:08.159 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:53:10.550 --> 01:53:10.560 align:start position:0%
would yeah a couple couple of quick
 
01:53:13.470 --> 01:53:13.480 align:start position:0%
questions on it the graph on BPI
 
01:53:15.189 --> 01:53:15.199 align:start position:0%
recovery of overpayments two two
 
01:53:17.790 --> 01:53:17.800 align:start position:0%
questions there so you identify
 
01:53:19.950 --> 01:53:19.960 align:start position:0%
overpayments and this is what you
 
01:53:23.629 --> 01:53:23.639 align:start position:0%
recover is this uh uh so what percentage
 
01:53:25.990 --> 01:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
of over does this represent of
 
01:53:28.629 --> 01:53:28.639 align:start position:0%
overpayments the you know what what how
 
01:53:30.390 --> 01:53:30.400 align:start position:0%
much is
 
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
unrecovered uh in some instances the
 
01:53:36.270 --> 01:53:36.280 align:start position:0%
mcos may choose to figure out how much
 
01:53:37.709 --> 01:53:37.719 align:start position:0%
they're going to be able to recover from
 
01:53:41.470 --> 01:53:41.480 align:start position:0%
a provider th this this is not this is
 
01:53:44.750 --> 01:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
from sorry let me clarify this is what
 
01:53:47.350 --> 01:53:47.360 align:start position:0%
we the Bureau of program Integrity would
 
01:53:50.629 --> 01:53:50.639 align:start position:0%
recover from any source so this is
 
01:53:53.149 --> 01:53:53.159 align:start position:0%
Medicaid snap
 
01:53:55.069 --> 01:53:55.079 align:start position:0%
uh general fund any any kind of
 
01:53:57.750 --> 01:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
beneficiary or provider overpayment that
 
01:54:01.310 --> 01:54:01.320 align:start position:0%
we would receive this is not uh
 
01:54:03.430 --> 01:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily fraud which is recovered by
 
01:54:03.440 --> 01:54:06.149 align:start position:0%
necessarily fraud which is recovered by
the

01:54:06.149 --> 01:54:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:08.589 --> 01:54:08.599 align:start position:0%
doj and this is not this is not
 
01:54:09.950 --> 01:54:09.960 align:start position:0%
represent what's recovered by our
 
01:54:12.589 --> 01:54:12.599 align:start position:0%
Managed Care organizations our Managed
 
01:54:14.910 --> 01:54:14.920 align:start position:0%
Care organizations keep what they
 
01:54:17.870 --> 01:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
recover and then when we develop our man
 
01:54:20.870 --> 01:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
Managed Care rates we have reduced the
 
01:54:21.990 --> 01:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
rate that they're going to get by the
 
01:54:25.430 --> 01:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
amount they have recovered so if they
 
01:54:28.189 --> 01:54:28.199 align:start position:0%
negotiate some kind of payment plan with
 
01:54:30.109 --> 01:54:30.119 align:start position:0%
a provider we are still looking at the
 
01:54:32.790 --> 01:54:32.800 align:start position:0%
total amount of overpayment and we are
 
01:54:35.109 --> 01:54:35.119 align:start position:0%
reducing that from our rate okay and
 
01:54:36.750 --> 01:54:36.760 align:start position:0%
then the second follow-up question if
 
01:54:38.910 --> 01:54:38.920 align:start position:0%
you don't mind question is okay so
 
01:54:42.189 --> 01:54:42.199 align:start position:0%
that's where part of the recovery goes
 
01:54:44.870 --> 01:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
recovery is there recovery money in any
 
01:54:46.990 --> 01:54:47.000 align:start position:0%
line item here where where is recovery
 
01:54:49.069 --> 01:54:49.079 align:start position:0%
money that comes back to
 
01:54:51.910 --> 01:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
dhss show up it's either unrestricted
 
01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:52.990 align:start position:0%
dhss show up it's either unrestricted
Revenue

01:54:52.990 --> 01:54:53.000 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
01:54:55.750 --> 01:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
or it goes back to the federal
 
01:54:58.830 --> 01:54:58.840 align:start position:0%
government and and just to tack onto
 
01:55:02.669 --> 01:55:02.679 align:start position:0%
that so the the money that is recovered
 
01:55:05.069 --> 01:55:05.079 align:start position:0%
100% does not go back to the state so
 
01:55:06.510 --> 01:55:06.520 align:start position:0%
there are portions that may go to the
 
01:55:07.910 --> 01:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
federal government they may go to
 
01:55:11.030 --> 01:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
counties as well um we provided a
 
01:55:12.669 --> 01:55:12.679 align:start position:0%
presentation and I can share it with the
 
01:55:15.910 --> 01:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
committee to house Ways and Means um
 
01:55:17.950 --> 01:55:17.960 align:start position:0%
that kind of details the types of
 
01:55:21.030 --> 01:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
recoveries that that DHHS engages in and
 
01:55:24.270 --> 01:55:24.280 align:start position:0%
the total amounts uh by type each year
 
01:55:26.350 --> 01:55:26.360 align:start position:0%
so so that shows up in a line item
 
01:55:28.910 --> 01:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
someplace uh it's it's unrestricted
 
01:55:31.790 --> 01:55:31.800 align:start position:0%
Revenue so it goes back to the general
 
01:55:34.629 --> 01:55:34.639 align:start position:0%
coffers of the state it's not it it it
 
01:55:36.589 --> 01:55:36.599 align:start position:0%
doesn't get designated as a revenue
 
01:55:38.470 --> 01:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
Source in like a specific accounting
 
01:55:39.990 --> 01:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
unit here to the best of my knowledge
 
01:55:42.390 --> 01:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
and I can verify that so it's not so
 
01:55:45.270 --> 01:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
it's not budgeted for it correct it h
 
01:55:48.470 --> 01:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
when it happens it it winds up in the
 
01:55:50.550 --> 01:55:50.560 align:start position:0%
general fund but it's not in the budget
 
01:55:54.390 --> 01:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
it it is it is in the budget um it so
 
01:55:55.950 --> 01:55:55.960 align:start position:0%
when house Ways and Means comes up with
 
01:55:57.790 --> 01:55:57.800 align:start position:0%
their projections and their revenue
 
01:56:01.669 --> 01:56:01.679 align:start position:0%
sources the the 3.1 million that we have
 
01:56:04.550 --> 01:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
budgeted in 26 and 27 will be budgeted
 
01:56:07.950 --> 01:56:07.960 align:start position:0%
in that amount so when the LBA develops
 
01:56:10.350 --> 01:56:10.360 align:start position:0%
their Surplus statement those other
 
01:56:12.270 --> 01:56:12.280 align:start position:0%
recoveries will be addressed there
 
01:56:13.550 --> 01:56:13.560 align:start position:0%
because sometimes Ways and Means will
 
01:56:15.350 --> 01:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
make adjustments to the amount so in the
 
01:56:17.550 --> 01:56:17.560 align:start position:0%
prior B any and we initially budgeted 2
 
01:56:20.830 --> 01:56:20.840 align:start position:0%
million that was increased to 3 million
 
01:56:22.790 --> 01:56:22.800 align:start position:0%
um during that process and that then
 
01:56:24.790 --> 01:56:24.800 align:start position:0%
that shows up as available Revenue that
 
01:56:26.310 --> 01:56:26.320 align:start position:0%
would be reflected in the Surplus
 
01:56:27.830 --> 01:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
statement as a benefit to the entire
 
01:56:30.270 --> 01:56:30.280 align:start position:0%
state but yeah to clarify it's the state
 
01:56:32.149 --> 01:56:32.159 align:start position:0%
it shows up in the state budget it
 
01:56:34.990 --> 01:56:35.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't show up in the DHHS budget right
 
01:56:37.229 --> 01:56:37.239 align:start position:0%
thank thank you for the
 
01:56:40.030 --> 01:56:40.040 align:start position:0%
response okay so so two questions in
 
01:56:43.550 --> 01:56:43.560 align:start position:0%
this regard um I I think I heard you say
 
01:56:48.030 --> 01:56:48.040 align:start position:0%
that our our AG um may may be uh
 
01:56:49.750 --> 01:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
relative to other states a little
 
01:56:53.350 --> 01:56:53.360 align:start position:0%
underst staffed in in in this area area
 
01:56:56.350 --> 01:56:56.360 align:start position:0%
um do we have a situation you think
 
01:56:59.510 --> 01:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
where uh uh you guys are so good you're
 
01:57:02.149 --> 01:57:02.159 align:start position:0%
you're creating a backlog at the AG and
 
01:57:04.430 --> 01:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
the AG can't work through the workload
 
01:57:06.510 --> 01:57:06.520 align:start position:0%
that you're handing them uh I wouldn't
 
01:57:10.669 --> 01:57:10.679 align:start position:0%
want to speak for the AG's office um I'm
 
01:57:13.589 --> 01:57:13.599 align:start position:0%
I'm you know we can certainly have that
 
01:57:15.830 --> 01:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
conversation with them and and bring you
 
01:57:17.910 --> 01:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
information well I don't get to talk to
 
01:57:21.109 --> 01:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
the AG I I but but if if you're thinking
 
01:57:23.350 --> 01:57:23.360 align:start position:0%
that there's a a problem there I can
 
01:57:25.709 --> 01:57:25.719 align:start position:0%
talk to the division that handles it and
 
01:57:27.990 --> 01:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
have them pay attention to it as they're
 
01:57:30.470 --> 01:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
doing their budget presentation from our
 
01:57:32.310 --> 01:57:32.320 align:start position:0%
perspective I don't think that we feel
 
01:57:35.870 --> 01:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
like we're experiencing a backlog um but
 
01:57:38.109 --> 01:57:38.119 align:start position:0%
they do have 50 cases
 
01:57:39.910 --> 01:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
between how many people do you think
 
01:57:44.069 --> 01:57:44.079 align:start position:0%
work there three three people three
 
01:57:46.149 --> 01:57:46.159 align:start position:0%
attorneys yeah I don't know how many
 
01:57:49.790 --> 01:57:49.800 align:start position:0%
attorneys they would need but um okay so
 
01:57:53.069 --> 01:57:53.079 align:start position:0%
have you ever calculated kind of a
 
01:57:56.390 --> 01:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
return on investment to where if we
 
01:57:59.790 --> 01:57:59.800 align:start position:0%
hired an incremental person to pursue
 
01:58:03.430 --> 01:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
fraud that we would expect X dollars
 
01:58:03.440 --> 01:58:05.510 align:start position:0%
fraud that we would expect X dollars
back

01:58:05.510 --> 01:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:58:09.270 --> 01:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
no do you think that's a p a possible
 
01:58:13.069 --> 01:58:13.079 align:start position:0%
math problem when we do these reviews
 
01:58:15.790 --> 01:58:15.800 align:start position:0%
we're not doing it necessarily for
 
01:58:19.229 --> 01:58:19.239 align:start position:0%
volume of dollars we're doing it for the
 
01:58:22.629 --> 01:58:22.639 align:start position:0%
behavior we're trying to stem any fraud
 
01:58:25.589 --> 01:58:25.599 align:start position:0%
Behavior so it could be I mean many of
 
01:58:28.109 --> 01:58:28.119 align:start position:0%
these cases are things like home health
 
01:58:31.510 --> 01:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
or non-emergency medical transportation
 
01:58:34.229 --> 01:58:34.239 align:start position:0%
these are not necessarily high
 
01:58:34.239 --> 01:58:36.310 align:start position:0%
these are not necessarily high
dollar

01:58:36.310 --> 01:58:36.320 align:start position:0%
dollar
 
01:58:39.189 --> 01:58:39.199 align:start position:0%
uh co services you know these are these
 
01:58:40.910 --> 01:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
aren't services that we're paying lots
 
01:58:42.870 --> 01:58:42.880 align:start position:0%
and lots of money to an individual for
 
01:58:44.709 --> 01:58:44.719 align:start position:0%
but if someone is defrauding the
 
01:58:46.910 --> 01:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program we need to find the
 
01:58:49.229 --> 01:58:49.239 align:start position:0%
behavior and stop the
 
01:58:52.790 --> 01:58:52.800 align:start position:0%
behavior okay thank you go ahead for
 
01:58:54.629 --> 01:58:54.639 align:start position:0%
just to follow your your question
 
01:58:57.709 --> 01:58:57.719 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards um later today
 
01:59:00.870 --> 01:59:00.880 align:start position:0%
Melissa Saint seir um who who is uh
 
01:59:03.149 --> 01:59:03.159 align:start position:0%
representative of the or she's Chief
 
01:59:05.270 --> 01:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
legal officer she will be talking about
 
01:59:08.510 --> 01:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid estate recoveries unit um
 
01:59:10.550 --> 01:59:10.560 align:start position:0%
which Falls within her team we have
 
01:59:13.149 --> 01:59:13.159 align:start position:0%
looked at that and there are estate
 
01:59:14.870 --> 01:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
recoveries that are available that we
 
01:59:16.750 --> 01:59:16.760 align:start position:0%
are not collecting and we have looked at
 
01:59:18.870 --> 01:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
the numbers of staff that would be
 
01:59:20.550 --> 01:59:20.560 align:start position:0%
needed we can certainly talk about that
 
01:59:22.950 --> 01:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
later when Melissa's here cuz there
 
01:59:24.750 --> 01:59:24.760 align:start position:0%
there is revenue that's available that
 
01:59:25.950 --> 01:59:25.960 align:start position:0%
would fall into that sort of
 
01:59:27.990 --> 01:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
unrestricted Revenue category if it were
 
01:59:29.870 --> 01:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
generated but currently that team
 
01:59:32.350 --> 01:59:32.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the staff to um to capture
 
01:59:34.310 --> 01:59:34.320 align:start position:0%
everything good looking forward to it
 
01:59:35.709 --> 01:59:35.719 align:start position:0%
was there a
 
01:59:37.950 --> 01:59:37.960 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr
 
01:59:41.430 --> 01:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
chairman on line
 
01:59:44.229 --> 01:59:44.239 align:start position:0%
042 additional French benefits I know
 
01:59:45.669 --> 01:59:45.679 align:start position:0%
this is what page are we on I'm sorry
 
01:59:47.189 --> 01:59:47.199 align:start position:0%
we're on page
 
01:59:47.199 --> 01:59:48.990 align:start position:0%
we're on page
1046

01:59:48.990 --> 01:59:49.000 align:start position:0%
1046
 
01:59:52.069 --> 01:59:52.079 align:start position:0%
1046 at the bottom of the page okay got
 
01:59:53.950 --> 01:59:53.960 align:start position:0%
got it thank you I'm just curious why
 
01:59:58.149 --> 01:59:58.159 align:start position:0%
there was um funding for both
 
02:00:02.149 --> 02:00:02.159 align:start position:0%
2024 and that there's just zero for the
 
02:00:05.069 --> 02:00:05.079 align:start position:0%
remaining 26 and
 
02:00:07.870 --> 02:00:07.880 align:start position:0%
27 so the additional French benefits
 
02:00:11.950 --> 02:00:11.960 align:start position:0%
have been centralized uh in in AU uh
 
02:00:14.790 --> 02:00:14.800 align:start position:0%
9500 um what we found was it was uh
 
02:00:17.750 --> 02:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
fairly administratively burdensome um
 
02:00:20.270 --> 02:00:20.280 align:start position:0%
the way that it was set up in the uh in
 
02:00:22.030 --> 02:00:22.040 align:start position:0%
in the system today so we tried to
 
02:00:23.750 --> 02:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
centralize that to make things a little
 
02:00:27.229 --> 02:00:27.239 align:start position:0%
bit more efficient um to maximize our
 
02:00:29.550 --> 02:00:29.560 align:start position:0%
operating capacity
 
02:00:33.830 --> 02:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
frankly okay thank you so much so miss
 
02:00:37.030 --> 02:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
tell us uh oh representative Mooney
 
02:00:38.629 --> 02:00:38.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:00:40.069 --> 02:00:40.079 align:start position:0%
being here I don't want it to go
 
02:00:42.030 --> 02:00:42.040 align:start position:0%
unnotice just how much work and
 
02:00:44.350 --> 02:00:44.360 align:start position:0%
information is in the budget briefing
 
02:00:49.510 --> 02:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
book related to your Bureau on page 16
 
02:00:52.629 --> 02:00:52.639 align:start position:0%
of that book I see State mandate
 
02:00:56.069 --> 02:00:56.079 align:start position:0%
I see Federal mandates are those the
 
02:01:00.669 --> 02:01:00.679 align:start position:0%
primary places for which fraud is
 
02:01:05.069 --> 02:01:05.079 align:start position:0%
detected and violations would occur uh
 
02:01:06.990 --> 02:01:07.000 align:start position:0%
yes I would say it's not those are not
 
02:01:11.149 --> 02:01:11.159 align:start position:0%
all just related to fraud um they also
 
02:01:13.669 --> 02:01:13.679 align:start position:0%
might be related to uh our third party
 
02:01:16.460 --> 02:01:16.470 align:start position:0%
liability requirements for example
 
02:01:16.470 --> 02:01:19.229 align:start position:0%
liability requirements for example
[Music]

02:01:19.229 --> 02:01:19.239 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:01:23.069 --> 02:01:23.079 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure what that one is yeah or
 
02:01:25.350 --> 02:01:25.360 align:start position:0%
or the general Integrity of the Medicaid
 
02:01:26.589 --> 02:01:26.599 align:start position:0%
Program which also includes the
 
02:01:28.510 --> 02:01:28.520 align:start position:0%
requirements behind provider enrollment
 
02:01:30.589 --> 02:01:30.599 align:start position:0%
which is intended to prevent fraud from
 
02:01:33.189 --> 02:01:33.199 align:start position:0%
occurring so that's the site visits and
 
02:01:36.870 --> 02:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:39.430 --> 02:01:39.440 align:start position:0%
providers thank you for the question all
 
02:01:41.669 --> 02:01:41.679 align:start position:0%
right it's it's noon I don't want to
 
02:01:43.910 --> 02:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
pressure you because this is all good
 
02:01:46.589 --> 02:01:46.599 align:start position:0%
work what how much time do you need to
 
02:01:49.870 --> 02:01:49.880 align:start position:0%
feel like you can wrap up uh completely
 
02:01:52.310 --> 02:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
do we want to aim for five minutes all
 
02:01:55.270 --> 02:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
right you got five minutes okay you got
 
02:02:01.669 --> 02:02:01.679 align:start position:0%
six okay so uh slide 10 is just a list
 
02:02:03.470 --> 02:02:03.480 align:start position:0%
of federal Audits and reviews that took
 
02:02:06.629 --> 02:02:06.639 align:start position:0%
place during 2024 that we helped to
 
02:02:09.709 --> 02:02:09.719 align:start position:0%
facilitate slide 11 the Bureau of
 
02:02:09.719 --> 02:02:11.790 align:start position:0%
facilitate slide 11 the Bureau of
program

02:02:11.790 --> 02:02:11.800 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:02:13.870 --> 02:02:13.880 align:start position:0%
quality Bureau of program quality
 
02:02:16.589 --> 02:02:16.599 align:start position:0%
consists of five unique work units that
 
02:02:19.350 --> 02:02:19.360 align:start position:0%
partner with DHHS programs to provide
 
02:02:21.950 --> 02:02:21.960 align:start position:0%
datadriven support and evaluation for
 
02:02:25.189 --> 02:02:25.199 align:start position:0%
program development program quality and
 
02:02:27.189 --> 02:02:27.199 align:start position:0%
performance Improvement and those
 
02:02:29.390 --> 02:02:29.400 align:start position:0%
functional work units are data analytics
 
02:02:31.430 --> 02:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
and Reporting which is what it sounds
 
02:02:33.950 --> 02:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
like uh the Medicaid quality program
 
02:02:35.830 --> 02:02:35.840 align:start position:0%
which manages the quality strategy the
 
02:02:37.510 --> 02:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
quality strategy federally required by
 
02:02:39.550 --> 02:02:39.560 align:start position:0%
CMS quality strategy for our Managed
 
02:02:42.030 --> 02:02:42.040 align:start position:0%
Care Program uh substance misuse
 
02:02:43.870 --> 02:02:43.880 align:start position:0%
planning and evaluation which does that
 
02:02:45.750 --> 02:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
kind of program development program
 
02:02:50.149 --> 02:02:50.159 align:start position:0%
evaluation just specific to substance uh
 
02:02:52.470 --> 02:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
use disorder uh services
 
02:02:55.510 --> 02:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
our health services assessment unit uh
 
02:02:57.629 --> 02:02:57.639 align:start position:0%
which creates and administers really
 
02:02:59.870 --> 02:02:59.880 align:start position:0%
really rigorous reviews of providers for
 
02:03:02.030 --> 02:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
quality and compliance and we do that
 
02:03:04.310 --> 02:03:04.320 align:start position:0%
again on behalf of program areas or we
 
02:03:05.910 --> 02:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
work with program areas to develop a
 
02:03:07.550 --> 02:03:07.560 align:start position:0%
review tool that they can use on their
 
02:03:09.910 --> 02:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
own and our contracts quality management
 
02:03:12.030 --> 02:03:12.040 align:start position:0%
unit which creates all the tools for
 
02:03:13.709 --> 02:03:13.719 align:start position:0%
contract management to be used by
 
02:03:16.510 --> 02:03:16.520 align:start position:0%
program areas um and and actually we
 
02:03:18.189 --> 02:03:18.199 align:start position:0%
work really closely with a lot of those
 
02:03:20.430 --> 02:03:20.440 align:start position:0%
program areas for to give like technical
 
02:03:22.470 --> 02:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
assistance on how to use those
 
02:03:25.470 --> 02:03:25.480 align:start position:0%
tools slide 13 really just offers more
 
02:03:27.109 --> 02:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
detailed description of some of the work
 
02:03:30.069 --> 02:03:30.079 align:start position:0%
of the Bureau of program quality um just
 
02:03:33.149 --> 02:03:33.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:37.470 --> 02:03:37.480 align:start position:0%
examples yeahor sorry excuse me go um on
 
02:03:41.669 --> 02:03:41.679 align:start position:0%
on slide on page 11 I just a kind of a
 
02:03:44.549 --> 02:03:44.559 align:start position:0%
curiosity question what is a sentinel
 
02:03:46.910 --> 02:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
event I was just going to describe your
 
02:03:50.030 --> 02:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
timing is perfect uh so a sentinel event
 
02:03:54.310 --> 02:03:54.320 align:start position:0%
is a particular type of event sorry very
 
02:03:58.390 --> 02:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
well defined in our policy uh really it
 
02:04:00.229 --> 02:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
really falls into very particular
 
02:04:02.270 --> 02:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
categories of some kind of critical
 
02:04:06.549 --> 02:04:06.559 align:start position:0%
event that takes place with one of our
 
02:04:09.430 --> 02:04:09.440 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries the providers serving that
 
02:04:11.830 --> 02:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
beneficiary are required to report the
 
02:04:14.910 --> 02:04:14.920 align:start position:0%
event to us uh to the to the program
 
02:04:16.950 --> 02:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
area and the program area will do their
 
02:04:21.270 --> 02:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
own review our role as a as a division
 
02:04:23.950 --> 02:04:23.960 align:start position:0%
then is is to host a sentinel event
 
02:04:26.750 --> 02:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
review where we take the information we
 
02:04:28.669 --> 02:04:28.679 align:start position:0%
work with the external stakeholders and
 
02:04:30.229 --> 02:04:30.239 align:start position:0%
we're we're doing a quality assurance
 
02:04:32.629 --> 02:04:32.639 align:start position:0%
review to try to get to the root cause
 
02:04:36.830 --> 02:04:36.840 align:start position:0%
of the event so so simply a is it true
 
02:04:39.549 --> 02:04:39.559 align:start position:0%
that a sentinel event then is a is an
 
02:04:42.510 --> 02:04:42.520 align:start position:0%
individual case of a patient that seems
 
02:04:45.870 --> 02:04:45.880 align:start position:0%
to be uh exorbitant in terms of the
 
02:04:48.350 --> 02:04:48.360 align:start position:0%
costs so we're looking we're looking at
 
02:04:50.669 --> 02:04:50.679 align:start position:0%
the care and the costs not related to
 
02:04:53.030 --> 02:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
the cost necessar no something happened
 
02:04:55.709 --> 02:04:55.719 align:start position:0%
a person for example died or was
 
02:04:57.870 --> 02:04:57.880 align:start position:0%
critically injured yeah that is
 
02:04:59.589 --> 02:04:59.599 align:start position:0%
something people would be a provider
 
02:05:01.470 --> 02:05:01.480 align:start position:0%
would be required to report to certain
 
02:05:03.950 --> 02:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
providers would be required to report to
 
02:05:07.109 --> 02:05:07.119 align:start position:0%
us and we would then work with them it
 
02:05:09.549 --> 02:05:09.559 align:start position:0%
there is a case that's required to be
 
02:05:12.030 --> 02:05:12.040 align:start position:0%
reported the program area will manage
 
02:05:14.709 --> 02:05:14.719 align:start position:0%
the case and the response to the case
 
02:05:17.229 --> 02:05:17.239 align:start position:0%
what we do is for example particularly
 
02:05:19.790 --> 02:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
if we see trends like like more than one
 
02:05:21.950 --> 02:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
instance happens with a certain providor
 
02:05:24.510 --> 02:05:24.520 align:start position:0%
type or a certain case type we will call
 
02:05:26.229 --> 02:05:26.239 align:start position:0%
together the program area external
 
02:05:28.950 --> 02:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
stakeholders the providers and we will
 
02:05:31.669 --> 02:05:31.679 align:start position:0%
say what is happening here that might be
 
02:05:33.510 --> 02:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
C that caused this one event or this
 
02:05:35.390 --> 02:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
series of events so that we can prevent
 
02:05:37.510 --> 02:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
it from happening do you do you also
 
02:05:40.229 --> 02:05:40.239 align:start position:0%
have uh like uh the ability with the
 
02:05:42.270 --> 02:05:42.280 align:start position:0%
intelligence system or whatever systems
 
02:05:46.030 --> 02:05:46.040 align:start position:0%
you're using to identify say the top 50
 
02:05:48.750 --> 02:05:48.760 align:start position:0%
most expensive individual patients that
 
02:05:51.030 --> 02:05:51.040 align:start position:0%
we have so that we can do an appropriate
 
02:05:53.430 --> 02:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
case management agement review or or is
 
02:05:57.030 --> 02:05:57.040 align:start position:0%
that all ad hoc and and and random how
 
02:06:00.790 --> 02:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:04.830 --> 02:06:04.840 align:start position:0%
those so separating out the cost there
 
02:06:08.910 --> 02:06:08.920 align:start position:0%
is actually now uh CMS requirements to
 
02:06:11.030 --> 02:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
develop a system that can do exactly
 
02:06:13.270 --> 02:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
what you are referring to so where we
 
02:06:16.510 --> 02:06:16.520 align:start position:0%
are combining multiple reporting systems
 
02:06:17.870 --> 02:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
so that we can see is something
 
02:06:20.310 --> 02:06:20.320 align:start position:0%
happening to people multiple times and
 
02:06:21.830 --> 02:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
Trend with different providers and
 
02:06:22.990 --> 02:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
different types of people in different
 
02:06:25.790 --> 02:06:25.800 align:start position:0%
cases uh so that is a system that we are
 
02:06:28.910 --> 02:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
actually currently working on um do we
 
02:06:31.470 --> 02:06:31.480 align:start position:0%
have any existing Capa capability that
 
02:06:34.270 --> 02:06:34.280 align:start position:0%
helps us do that I mean I hear you that
 
02:06:35.910 --> 02:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
you're going to develop it but I'm just
 
02:06:37.430 --> 02:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
curious what we've been doing the last
 
02:06:38.549 --> 02:06:38.559 align:start position:0%
couple of
 
02:06:42.830 --> 02:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
years we we do we we do have
 
02:06:46.350 --> 02:06:46.360 align:start position:0%
capabilities uh in our mismis system for
 
02:06:48.830 --> 02:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
example to look at certain things um
 
02:06:50.390 --> 02:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
what we're looking at is trying to pull
 
02:06:53.310 --> 02:06:53.320 align:start position:0%
multiple systems together so that we can
 
02:06:55.870 --> 02:06:55.880 align:start position:0%
have a full picture of cases and that's
 
02:06:57.709 --> 02:06:57.719 align:start position:0%
the work that's being done now both in
 
02:07:03.270 --> 02:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
our ebi system and uh with with our um
 
02:07:06.149 --> 02:07:06.159 align:start position:0%
Bureau of uh adult and Aging Services as
 
02:07:08.229 --> 02:07:08.239 align:start position:0%
well for the incidents that they're that
 
02:07:10.310 --> 02:07:10.320 align:start position:0%
are reported to
 
02:07:10.320 --> 02:07:12.390 align:start position:0%
are reported to
them

02:07:12.390 --> 02:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:07:14.830 --> 02:07:14.840 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
02:07:17.549 --> 02:07:17.559 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
02:07:19.790 --> 02:07:19.800 align:start position:0%
um thank you for all the work that you
 
02:07:23.709 --> 02:07:23.719 align:start position:0%
do it's excellent thank thank you um do
 
02:07:26.990 --> 02:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
you have any cost effective measures
 
02:07:28.510 --> 02:07:28.520 align:start position:0%
that you have
 
02:07:33.830 --> 02:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
used to show the outside world
 
02:07:38.750 --> 02:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
us um how much cost
 
02:07:42.350 --> 02:07:42.360 align:start position:0%
savings you have done for the state like
 
02:07:45.310 --> 02:07:45.320 align:start position:0%
how much millions of dollars you have
 
02:07:48.629 --> 02:07:48.639 align:start position:0%
saved the state because you've gone back
 
02:07:52.790 --> 02:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
to assure that there was adequacy of
 
02:07:56.430 --> 02:07:56.440 align:start position:0%
services and not fraud going
 
02:08:00.830 --> 02:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
on so the graphic on
 
02:08:04.470 --> 02:08:04.480 align:start position:0%
slide six
 
02:08:08.310 --> 02:08:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:12.069 --> 02:08:12.079 align:start position:0%
nine represents overpayments that we've
 
02:08:14.189 --> 02:08:14.199 align:start position:0%
recovered for example that doesn't
 
02:08:16.870 --> 02:08:16.880 align:start position:0%
include fraud so I could get separate
 
02:08:20.549 --> 02:08:20.559 align:start position:0%
numbers for fraud okay it also doesn't
 
02:08:23.709 --> 02:08:23.719 align:start position:0%
include the waste and abuse captured by
 
02:08:23.719 --> 02:08:24.390 align:start position:0%
include the waste and abuse captured by
the

02:08:24.390 --> 02:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:08:26.669 --> 02:08:26.679 align:start position:0%
mcos uh which would be a separate number
 
02:08:31.149 --> 02:08:31.159 align:start position:0%
from that um and
 
02:08:34.790 --> 02:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
I for example in third party
 
02:08:37.470 --> 02:08:37.480 align:start position:0%
liability there is an amount related to
 
02:08:39.589 --> 02:08:39.599 align:start position:0%
cost savings you said cost savings right
 
02:08:42.270 --> 02:08:42.280 align:start position:0%
so what we call Cost avoid when Medicaid
 
02:08:44.709 --> 02:08:44.719 align:start position:0%
is the payer of Last Resort another
 
02:08:47.910 --> 02:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
insurer has already paid the bill when
 
02:08:50.790 --> 02:08:50.800 align:start position:0%
we have properly functioning TPL systems
 
02:08:54.310 --> 02:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
third party Li ability systems we aren't
 
02:08:56.629 --> 02:08:56.639 align:start position:0%
getting the bill because somebody else
 
02:08:59.310 --> 02:08:59.320 align:start position:0%
has already paid it we can't capture
 
02:08:59.320 --> 02:09:00.189 align:start position:0%
has already paid it we can't capture
that

02:09:00.189 --> 02:09:00.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:09:02.549 --> 02:09:02.559 align:start position:0%
data that's in the millions and millions
 
02:09:05.390 --> 02:09:05.400 align:start position:0%
of dollars but but someone else has
 
02:09:07.069 --> 02:09:07.079 align:start position:0%
received the claim so I don't have the
 
02:09:08.750 --> 02:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
claim to tell you how much it's worth
 
02:09:12.149 --> 02:09:12.159 align:start position:0%
but but in the big picture in uh isn't
 
02:09:14.030 --> 02:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
it the case that what you're what you're
 
02:09:16.549 --> 02:09:16.559 align:start position:0%
trying to do is really control or
 
02:09:19.990 --> 02:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
improve and modify behaviors and if
 
02:09:21.950 --> 02:09:21.960 align:start position:0%
you're successful in that
 
02:09:24.830 --> 02:09:24.840 align:start position:0%
then the opportunity to collect is
 
02:09:27.990 --> 02:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
actually reduced and so you you've got
 
02:09:31.870 --> 02:09:31.880 align:start position:0%
kind of an IR an ironic situation in
 
02:09:34.950 --> 02:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
that if the if our goal is to increase
 
02:09:37.109 --> 02:09:37.119 align:start position:0%
collections it's almost like you have to
 
02:09:39.310 --> 02:09:39.320 align:start position:0%
let the behavior run wild so you can
 
02:09:39.320 --> 02:09:40.149 align:start position:0%
let the behavior run wild so you can
catch

02:09:40.149 --> 02:09:40.159 align:start position:0%
catch
 
02:09:43.470 --> 02:09:43.480 align:start position:0%
more that's correct yes so our first
 
02:09:45.950 --> 02:09:45.960 align:start position:0%
goal is what we the behaviors what we
 
02:09:48.669 --> 02:09:48.679 align:start position:0%
refer to is internal controls so we are
 
02:09:50.430 --> 02:09:50.440 align:start position:0%
always looking to improve our internal
 
02:09:52.470 --> 02:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
controls our system of internal control
 
02:09:55.430 --> 02:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
which is policies and procedures
 
02:09:58.310 --> 02:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
documentation training communication
 
02:10:00.390 --> 02:10:00.400 align:start position:0%
it's the really fundamental core of
 
02:10:01.870 --> 02:10:01.880 align:start position:0%
management so that things are working
 
02:10:05.030 --> 02:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
right in the first place beautiful yes I
 
02:10:07.310 --> 02:10:07.320 align:start position:0%
understand that and I appreciate all of
 
02:10:10.589 --> 02:10:10.599 align:start position:0%
this um again thank you if you could get
 
02:10:13.470 --> 02:10:13.480 align:start position:0%
us those other numbers because that kind
 
02:10:14.790 --> 02:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
of helps to
 
02:10:17.350 --> 02:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
justify yeah you know why this is so
 
02:10:18.990 --> 02:10:19.000 align:start position:0%
important we can certainly get that
 
02:10:21.470 --> 02:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:10:24.709 --> 02:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
okay did did you have um couple closing
 
02:10:27.510 --> 02:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
statements uh slide 14 just to explain
 
02:10:28.990 --> 02:10:29.000 align:start position:0%
what you're looking at
 
02:10:32.629 --> 02:10:32.639 align:start position:0%
there it's a graphic rep no not 14 sorry
 
02:10:35.390 --> 02:10:35.400 align:start position:0%
13 it's just a graphic representation of
 
02:10:38.189 --> 02:10:38.199 align:start position:0%
our quality strategy so the Medicaid
 
02:10:40.750 --> 02:10:40.760 align:start position:0%
quality priorities are up at the top for
 
02:10:44.790 --> 02:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
our Managed Care uh program and the what
 
02:10:47.430 --> 02:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
we refer to as our quality levers are on
 
02:10:48.950 --> 02:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
the Le hand side here these are
 
02:10:50.790 --> 02:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
different levers of incentives that we
 
02:10:52.830 --> 02:10:52.840 align:start position:0%
use Financial incentives to the managed
 
02:10:56.350 --> 02:10:56.360 align:start position:0%
care plans uh to to try to incent them
 
02:10:58.629 --> 02:10:58.639 align:start position:0%
to produce quality performance in each
 
02:10:59.990 --> 02:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
of these different
 
02:11:02.750 --> 02:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
areas could I suggest you work with Mr
 
02:11:06.549 --> 02:11:06.559 align:start position:0%
Williams uh to uh add this to HHS
 
02:11:09.629 --> 02:11:09.639 align:start position:0%
oversight and you can come tell
 
02:11:12.149 --> 02:11:12.159 align:start position:0%
oversight more about this because I
 
02:11:14.709 --> 02:11:14.719 align:start position:0%
think this this just suggests a lot of
 
02:11:16.910 --> 02:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
really good information I will have that
 
02:11:18.709 --> 02:11:18.719 align:start position:0%
conversation with him yes all right yeah
 
02:11:21.990 --> 02:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
thank you anything else no I think as we
 
02:11:24.750 --> 02:11:24.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned our budget is almost entirely
 
02:11:26.950 --> 02:11:26.960 align:start position:0%
Personnel um we have three unfunded
 
02:11:30.229 --> 02:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
positions in each of the two bureaus and
 
02:11:31.390 --> 02:11:31.400 align:start position:0%
that that's
 
02:11:34.750 --> 02:11:34.760 align:start position:0%
it okay well thank thank you very much
 
02:11:37.790 --> 02:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
uh if you if you want to uh tell us more
 
02:11:40.549 --> 02:11:40.559 align:start position:0%
later or send us stuff we'd be I'd be
 
02:11:42.790 --> 02:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
happy to see it great uh are there any
 
02:11:45.950 --> 02:11:45.960 align:start position:0%
final questions from the committee no
 
02:11:48.229 --> 02:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
okay so I think we're ready to recess
 
02:11:53.589 --> 02:11:53.599 align:start position:0%
for lunch uh I think we uh it's 12:10 I
 
02:11:56.549 --> 02:11:56.559 align:start position:0%
think we can still try to get back at 1
 
02:12:00.030 --> 02:12:00.040 align:start position:0%
uh we're going to talk to Legal uh the I
 
02:12:02.430 --> 02:12:02.440 align:start position:0%
guess that's bis business Information
 
02:12:05.830 --> 02:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
Systems facilities and everyone's
 
02:12:08.709 --> 02:12:08.719 align:start position:0%
favorite topic Health
 
02:12:11.709 --> 02:12:11.719 align:start position:0%
Equity so um all right so with that
 
02:12:22.830 --> 02:12:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:50.109 --> 02:12:50.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:50.119 --> 02:13:20.109 align:start position:0%

03:00:24.750 --> 03:00:24.760 align:start position:0%
one minute warning you're out in the
 
03:00:46.910 --> 03:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:33.790 --> 03:01:33.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:37.550 --> 03:01:37.560 align:start position:0%
all right it's uh it's 1:00 uh we're
 
03:01:40.469 --> 03:01:40.479 align:start position:0%
going to uh bring division three out of
 
03:01:44.750 --> 03:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
recess um and uh we've got four
 
03:01:48.110 --> 03:01:48.120 align:start position:0%
presentations to uh this afternoon
 
03:01:51.910 --> 03:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm thinking that we can probably
 
03:01:54.389 --> 03:01:54.399 align:start position:0%
complete this in in two hours as my
 
03:01:59.349 --> 03:01:59.359 align:start position:0%
initial goal um so uh all right and with
 
03:02:03.950 --> 03:02:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:06.630 --> 03:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
go hi good morning or oh sorry good
 
03:02:08.429 --> 03:02:08.439 align:start position:0%
afternoon Melissa Saint here I'm the
 
03:02:10.190 --> 03:02:10.200 align:start position:0%
chief legal officer for the Department
 
03:02:11.630 --> 03:02:11.640 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human
 
03:02:13.630 --> 03:02:13.640 align:start position:0%
Services and Nathan white Chief
 
03:02:15.070 --> 03:02:15.080 align:start position:0%
Financial Officer with the Department of
 
03:02:19.229 --> 03:02:19.239 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services um in your uh
 
03:02:22.190 --> 03:02:22.200 align:start position:0%
in your presentation book there the next
 
03:02:23.990 --> 03:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh presentation should be the office of
 
03:02:25.990 --> 03:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
legal and Regulatory Services the
 
03:02:29.750 --> 03:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
PowerPoint should be there um this this
 
03:02:31.870 --> 03:02:31.880 align:start position:0%
area has a few more accounting units
 
03:02:35.429 --> 03:02:35.439 align:start position:0%
than than some of the other areas so I
 
03:02:37.590 --> 03:02:37.600 align:start position:0%
think a good starting point would be to
 
03:02:40.070 --> 03:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
turn to in the governor's operating
 
03:02:43.510 --> 03:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
budget to turn to page
 
03:02:47.229 --> 03:02:47.239 align:start position:0%
1,48 um to start this this area does
 
03:02:51.830 --> 03:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:55.910 --> 03:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
1,54 I believe um so all all of those
 
03:02:57.830 --> 03:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
accounting units within that within that
 
03:03:01.469 --> 03:03:01.479 align:start position:0%
page range um would be included in this
 
03:03:03.830 --> 03:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
presentation and in
 
03:03:10.349 --> 03:03:10.359 align:start position:0%
the in the uh DHHS briefing book um this
 
03:03:19.870 --> 03:03:19.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:21.550 --> 03:03:21.560 align:start position:0%
it's more towards the
 
03:03:24.070 --> 03:03:24.080 align:start position:0%
end there it
 
03:03:28.710 --> 03:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
is on page 17 is where this section will
 
03:03:31.349 --> 03:03:31.359 align:start position:0%
begin so with that I will hand it over
 
03:03:35.750 --> 03:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
to Melissa hello good afternoon again um
 
03:03:37.309 --> 03:03:37.319 align:start position:0%
so we'll start with the Bureau of
 
03:03:39.670 --> 03:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
Licensing and certification the Bureau
 
03:03:41.190 --> 03:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
of Licensing and certification has two
 
03:03:43.389 --> 03:03:43.399 align:start position:0%
components child care licensing and
 
03:03:46.150 --> 03:03:46.160 align:start position:0%
health facilities licensing so child
 
03:03:49.229 --> 03:03:49.239 align:start position:0%
care licensing licenses and inspects and
 
03:03:52.190 --> 03:03:52.200 align:start position:0%
ensur safety and um Health regulations
 
03:03:54.510 --> 03:03:54.520 align:start position:0%
are followed for child care
 
03:03:57.110 --> 03:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
facilities that includes uh daycare
 
03:04:00.070 --> 03:04:00.080 align:start position:0%
centers residential programs as well as
 
03:04:02.389 --> 03:04:02.399 align:start position:0%
youth recreation camps um that occur
 
03:04:05.750 --> 03:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
during the summer so we we do those
 
03:04:08.110 --> 03:04:08.120 align:start position:0%
regulations um and they get annual
 
03:04:11.229 --> 03:04:11.239 align:start position:0%
inspections and um licensing uh
 
03:04:13.670 --> 03:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
application processes as well as we uh
 
03:04:15.670 --> 03:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
address the criminal background checks
 
03:04:18.590 --> 03:04:18.600 align:start position:0%
for all all childcare workers that work
 
03:04:20.630 --> 03:04:20.640 align:start position:0%
in in child care facilities were
 
03:04:23.070 --> 03:04:23.080 align:start position:0%
responsible for completing their um
 
03:04:25.070 --> 03:04:25.080 align:start position:0%
criminal background
 
03:04:27.950 --> 03:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
checks and then Health Care Facilities
 
03:04:30.990 --> 03:04:31.000 align:start position:0%
um and certification there there are a
 
03:04:32.950 --> 03:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
couple of different components licensing
 
03:04:36.070 --> 03:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
for the State of New Hampshire so we uh
 
03:04:39.110 --> 03:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
license we inspect we ensure that they
 
03:04:41.469 --> 03:04:41.479 align:start position:0%
apply and that they are operating with a
 
03:04:43.710 --> 03:04:43.720 align:start position:0%
license for all Healthcare facilities
 
03:04:45.429 --> 03:04:45.439 align:start position:0%
and there's a myriad of healthcare
 
03:04:47.870 --> 03:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
facilities hospitals nursing homes uh
 
03:04:49.150 --> 03:04:49.160 align:start position:0%
Residential Care Facilities like
 
03:04:51.750 --> 03:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
assisted livings we also do um adult
 
03:04:53.950 --> 03:04:53.960 align:start position:0%
daycare centers ambulance Sur surgical
 
03:04:55.830 --> 03:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
centers dialysis centers I mean the list
 
03:04:59.150 --> 03:04:59.160 align:start position:0%
really goes on and on that uh if they
 
03:05:02.070 --> 03:05:02.080 align:start position:0%
receive a federal funding as well so
 
03:05:04.150 --> 03:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
there are some that just are licens and
 
03:05:06.229 --> 03:05:06.239 align:start position:0%
just uh perform services within the
 
03:05:08.150 --> 03:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
state and don't receive any federal
 
03:05:09.670 --> 03:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
funding you'll see a lot of their
 
03:05:11.269 --> 03:05:11.279 align:start position:0%
assisted livings are like that where
 
03:05:13.870 --> 03:05:13.880 align:start position:0%
they just um receive either State
 
03:05:15.790 --> 03:05:15.800 align:start position:0%
funding or they receive or or they're
 
03:05:18.670 --> 03:05:18.680 align:start position:0%
paid privately basically to live there
 
03:05:21.469 --> 03:05:21.479 align:start position:0%
those um will only get a state license
 
03:05:22.910 --> 03:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
those that receive federal funding will
 
03:05:25.030 --> 03:05:25.040 align:start position:0%
also get what's called a certification
 
03:05:27.790 --> 03:05:27.800 align:start position:0%
and that team is also within the
 
03:05:31.110 --> 03:05:31.120 align:start position:0%
department within that unit and they are
 
03:05:34.229 --> 03:05:34.239 align:start position:0%
um basically take direction from CMS
 
03:05:36.150 --> 03:05:36.160 align:start position:0%
from the regional office of CMS to
 
03:05:38.070 --> 03:05:38.080 align:start position:0%
perform certification requirements to
 
03:05:40.469 --> 03:05:40.479 align:start position:0%
ensure Federal Regulations are met as
 
03:05:43.269 --> 03:05:43.279 align:start position:0%
well and then additional certification
 
03:05:45.830 --> 03:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
also occurs for our community residences
 
03:05:47.630 --> 03:05:47.640 align:start position:0%
so those Community residences per
 
03:05:49.150 --> 03:05:49.160 align:start position:0%
perform services and care for
 
03:05:50.349 --> 03:05:50.359 align:start position:0%
individuals with developmental
 
03:05:51.990 --> 03:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
disabilities they're generally like
 
03:05:54.670 --> 03:05:54.680 align:start position:0%
homik environments where people live so
 
03:05:56.790 --> 03:05:56.800 align:start position:0%
they're certified to receive state
 
03:05:59.190 --> 03:05:59.200 align:start position:0%
funding um through our Bureau of
 
03:06:02.150 --> 03:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
Developmental Disabilities um and then
 
03:06:04.910 --> 03:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
they also receive a license if there are
 
03:06:08.229 --> 03:06:08.239 align:start position:0%
a larger faciliity so four or more um
 
03:06:10.070 --> 03:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
individuals who live in a facility then
 
03:06:12.269 --> 03:06:12.279 align:start position:0%
they would also get a state license to
 
03:06:14.229 --> 03:06:14.239 align:start position:0%
ensure that there's a lot more oversight
 
03:06:16.229 --> 03:06:16.239 align:start position:0%
around kind of the building not just the
 
03:06:17.590 --> 03:06:17.600 align:start position:0%
health and safety of the care that's
 
03:06:19.550 --> 03:06:19.560 align:start position:0%
being provided but also ensure that the
 
03:06:21.830 --> 03:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
building is safe there's fire codes are
 
03:06:23.870 --> 03:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
being met and all of those type of
 
03:06:26.269 --> 03:06:26.279 align:start position:0%
things so so there are different
 
03:06:27.710 --> 03:06:27.720 align:start position:0%
components for the Bureau of Licensing
 
03:06:29.110 --> 03:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
and certification and depending on the
 
03:06:30.630 --> 03:06:30.640 align:start position:0%
services that are provided that's
 
03:06:33.950 --> 03:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
essentially what um each of them
 
03:06:37.990 --> 03:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
do thanks if I may sure
 
03:06:40.710 --> 03:06:40.720 align:start position:0%
please finish your introduction I have
 
03:06:43.030 --> 03:06:43.040 align:start position:0%
finished for Bureau of Licensing and
 
03:06:45.830 --> 03:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
certification okay uh questions so the
 
03:06:48.269 --> 03:06:48.279 align:start position:0%
question so are on the I understand the
 
03:06:50.229 --> 03:06:50.239 align:start position:0%
State Licensing piece of it are you
 
03:06:52.870 --> 03:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
doing the certification for the federal
 
03:06:54.389 --> 03:06:54.399 align:start position:0%
correct yes we are and you're
 
03:06:56.790 --> 03:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
compensated for that yes we are uh
 
03:06:59.469 --> 03:06:59.479 align:start position:0%
generally most of our the staff are
 
03:07:01.750 --> 03:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
almost they're the majority of the
 
03:07:03.830 --> 03:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
funding for their positions are federal
 
03:07:06.550 --> 03:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
or federal funds for those positions and
 
03:07:07.830 --> 03:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
so when you do that you're doing the
 
03:07:09.389 --> 03:07:09.399 align:start position:0%
certification and the licensing at the
 
03:07:11.710 --> 03:07:11.720 align:start position:0%
same time so we actually have a deemed
 
03:07:13.190 --> 03:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
license status in the state of New
 
03:07:14.830 --> 03:07:14.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so if somebody is in
 
03:07:16.429 --> 03:07:16.439 align:start position:0%
compliance with the certification the
 
03:07:18.070 --> 03:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
federal certification requirements which
 
03:07:19.590 --> 03:07:19.600 align:start position:0%
are a little bit more stringent than our
 
03:07:22.070 --> 03:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
state laws then they get a license
 
03:07:23.269 --> 03:07:23.279 align:start position:0%
through the state of New Hampshire so we
 
03:07:24.750 --> 03:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
actually don't do two inspections we
 
03:07:26.870 --> 03:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
just do the one okay thank
 
03:07:29.110 --> 03:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
03:07:31.670 --> 03:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
priest thank you and and thank you for
 
03:07:34.510 --> 03:07:34.520 align:start position:0%
providing us a chart with the Staffing
 
03:07:38.229 --> 03:07:38.239 align:start position:0%
for each of these three areas on page
 
03:07:42.030 --> 03:07:42.040 align:start position:0%
two uh on page four um can you tell us
 
03:07:46.950 --> 03:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
how many uh Child Care um facilities or
 
03:07:46.960 --> 03:07:48.910 align:start position:0%
how many uh Child Care um facilities or
programs

03:07:48.910 --> 03:07:48.920 align:start position:0%
programs
 
03:07:54.070 --> 03:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
you um you review and certainly yeah so
 
03:07:57.349 --> 03:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
actually it's on page 13 oh my goodness
 
03:07:59.309 --> 03:07:59.319 align:start position:0%
okay yeah I know it's at the it's at the
 
03:08:01.070 --> 03:08:01.080 align:start position:0%
end so all of our case load and kind of
 
03:08:04.070 --> 03:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
data around the numbers are um on those
 
03:08:07.030 --> 03:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
pages so on page 13 you'll see childcare
 
03:08:09.590 --> 03:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
licensing we inspect 712 family and
 
03:08:12.150 --> 03:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
center-based licensed daycare centers we
 
03:08:14.429 --> 03:08:14.439 align:start position:0%
have 24 residential programs and 19
 
03:08:16.510 --> 03:08:16.520 align:start position:0%
license exempt and those license exempt
 
03:08:18.830 --> 03:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
are basically they don't qualify to get
 
03:08:20.309 --> 03:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
a state license they don't need to
 
03:08:22.349 --> 03:08:22.359 align:start position:0%
because they just have a small number of
 
03:08:24.790 --> 03:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
kids maybe two kids that they care for
 
03:08:26.590 --> 03:08:26.600 align:start position:0%
but they are receiving funding from our
 
03:08:29.030 --> 03:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
ccdf um federal
 
03:08:32.670 --> 03:08:32.680 align:start position:0%
funds for kids that maybe um need that
 
03:08:34.269 --> 03:08:34.279 align:start position:0%
need that funding to assist with their
 
03:08:36.990 --> 03:08:37.000 align:start position:0%
child care so um we we inspect those as
 
03:08:41.309 --> 03:08:41.319 align:start position:0%
well so uh there that covers 46,700
 
03:08:44.510 --> 03:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
childcare slots um and this also gives
 
03:08:47.190 --> 03:08:47.200 align:start position:0%
you the number of uh recreational camps
 
03:08:50.670 --> 03:08:50.680 align:start position:0%
which is 159 and we have 363 complaints
 
03:08:53.750 --> 03:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
that we handled this past
 
03:08:57.309 --> 03:08:57.319 align:start position:0%
year okay thank you very much of course
 
03:08:59.710 --> 03:08:59.720 align:start position:0%
what what's what what's kind of a a
 
03:09:02.030 --> 03:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
general nature of a of the complaints
 
03:09:04.590 --> 03:09:04.600 align:start position:0%
you handle I I know that there's a range
 
03:09:06.870 --> 03:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
but what's sort of a typical one that
 
03:09:10.349 --> 03:09:10.359 align:start position:0%
you seem to get a lot of um you know I
 
03:09:12.309 --> 03:09:12.319 align:start position:0%
don't know if there is a typical you you
 
03:09:15.150 --> 03:09:15.160 align:start position:0%
know it's really around um sometimes you
 
03:09:17.910 --> 03:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
know they don't seem to have enough stat
 
03:09:20.309 --> 03:09:20.319 align:start position:0%
or they the staff that aren't allowing
 
03:09:23.950 --> 03:09:23.960 align:start position:0%
them to go the kids to go outside or um
 
03:09:25.870 --> 03:09:25.880 align:start position:0%
you know we've noticed some things that
 
03:09:28.510 --> 03:09:28.520 align:start position:0%
are unclean and you know it really can
 
03:09:32.510 --> 03:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
be a wide range um of of complaints so
 
03:09:34.710 --> 03:09:34.720 align:start position:0%
it's hard to say I don't I can certainly
 
03:09:36.349 --> 03:09:36.359 align:start position:0%
go back and see if they have any data
 
03:09:37.910 --> 03:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
though that we can provide you no I'm
 
03:09:40.389 --> 03:09:40.399 align:start position:0%
just kind of conversational get my head
 
03:09:43.590 --> 03:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
around it a little bit sure um and then
 
03:09:45.910 --> 03:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
well for those kind of complaints which
 
03:09:48.309 --> 03:09:48.319 align:start position:0%
sound fairly General
 
03:09:51.429 --> 03:09:51.439 align:start position:0%
are are there are there almost always
 
03:09:54.389 --> 03:09:54.399 align:start position:0%
some sort of Regulation that you were
 
03:09:56.630 --> 03:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
enforc you're inspecting against a a
 
03:09:58.229 --> 03:09:58.239 align:start position:0%
requirement and a
 
03:10:01.950 --> 03:10:01.960 align:start position:0%
regulation yes absolutely we would
 
03:10:04.469 --> 03:10:04.479 align:start position:0%
always I mean if if we receive a
 
03:10:05.750 --> 03:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
complaint and it's something that's
 
03:10:07.150 --> 03:10:07.160 align:start position:0%
regulated we would look at the
 
03:10:08.910 --> 03:10:08.920 align:start position:0%
regulation and then we would do an
 
03:10:10.990 --> 03:10:11.000 align:start position:0%
inspection if it was something that's
 
03:10:14.990 --> 03:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
you know um my daycare center does not
 
03:10:17.630 --> 03:10:17.640 align:start position:0%
provide lunch and I would really love
 
03:10:19.469 --> 03:10:19.479 align:start position:0%
for them to provide lunch you know
 
03:10:20.870 --> 03:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
that's not a requirement under the
 
03:10:22.469 --> 03:10:22.479 align:start position:0%
regulations that's a choice that the
 
03:10:24.590 --> 03:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
business would make so um that's
 
03:10:26.150 --> 03:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
something we wouldn't then inspect we
 
03:10:28.070 --> 03:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
would screen that out and then there are
 
03:10:30.150 --> 03:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
federal regulations because I'm I'm just
 
03:10:32.110 --> 03:10:32.120 align:start position:0%
sort of curious why we get so much
 
03:10:35.070 --> 03:10:35.080 align:start position:0%
Federal money for child care licensing
 
03:10:37.469 --> 03:10:37.479 align:start position:0%
yeah so our child care development block
 
03:10:41.630 --> 03:10:41.640 align:start position:0%
grant um does provide for children to
 
03:10:43.710 --> 03:10:43.720 align:start position:0%
receive child care in um different
 
03:10:46.790 --> 03:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
incomes our child development Bureau
 
03:10:49.670 --> 03:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
provides that funding um so they're
 
03:10:52.830 --> 03:10:52.840 align:start position:0%
actually part of um a different Bureau
 
03:10:54.990 --> 03:10:55.000 align:start position:0%
so we're not responsible we just handle
 
03:10:57.389 --> 03:10:57.399 align:start position:0%
the regulatory side of things but they
 
03:10:59.469 --> 03:10:59.479 align:start position:0%
do provide funding they provide funding
 
03:11:02.510 --> 03:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
some for our technology to they provide
 
03:11:03.950 --> 03:11:03.960 align:start position:0%
funding for our criminal background
 
03:11:05.590 --> 03:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
checks to make sure those are complete
 
03:11:08.190 --> 03:11:08.200 align:start position:0%
so there's some funding that streams in
 
03:11:11.269 --> 03:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
related to that so so Mr White that that
 
03:11:13.469 --> 03:11:13.479 align:start position:0%
that money isn't showing up twice is it
 
03:11:15.469 --> 03:11:15.479 align:start position:0%
it's not showing up as a grant in one
 
03:11:17.510 --> 03:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
department and then it's showing up is
 
03:11:21.229 --> 03:11:21.239 align:start position:0%
revenue for for for child care licensing
 
03:11:25.150 --> 03:11:25.160 align:start position:0%
it no we it certainly should should not
 
03:11:27.670 --> 03:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
be they'll be double budgeting it and we
 
03:11:30.590 --> 03:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
we can't do that yeah
 
03:11:35.190 --> 03:11:35.200 align:start position:0%
okay good one one quick one so no no no
 
03:11:35.200 --> 03:11:36.429 align:start position:0%
okay good one one quick one so no no no
representative

03:11:36.429 --> 03:11:36.439 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:11:39.870 --> 03:11:39.880 align:start position:0%
priest thank you um on your community
 
03:11:42.429 --> 03:11:42.439 align:start position:0%
residences where does that appear within
 
03:11:44.590 --> 03:11:44.600 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget what page
 
03:11:48.429 --> 03:11:48.439 align:start position:0%
number so there's Child Care license
 
03:11:48.439 --> 03:11:49.870 align:start position:0%
number so there's Child Care license
this

03:11:49.870 --> 03:11:49.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:11:53.670 --> 03:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
here2 okay it's on page 1052 I've got it
 
03:11:56.150 --> 03:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much representative
 
03:11:59.349 --> 03:11:59.359 align:start position:0%
Al real real quick one do you charge a
 
03:12:02.630 --> 03:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
licensing fee to anybody and where does
 
03:12:06.510 --> 03:12:06.520 align:start position:0%
that show yeah so RSA 151 um is for
 
03:12:08.750 --> 03:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
health facilities there's a there's a
 
03:12:11.269 --> 03:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
specific charge it's in statute of what
 
03:12:13.510 --> 03:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
we charge sometimes like hospitals it's
 
03:12:16.150 --> 03:12:16.160 align:start position:0%
per bed other facilities it's per
 
03:12:18.550 --> 03:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
facility um depending so that's actually
 
03:12:21.830 --> 03:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
in the statute um and then child care
 
03:12:25.550 --> 03:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
licensing uh there is no fee for to
 
03:12:27.750 --> 03:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
become a a licensed child care
 
03:12:30.590 --> 03:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
provider and where does that the revenue
 
03:12:39.269 --> 03:12:39.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:41.950 --> 03:12:41.960 align:start position:0%
where I I I don't I don't see that
 
03:12:41.960 --> 03:12:43.269 align:start position:0%
where I I I don't I don't see that
revenue

03:12:43.269 --> 03:12:43.279 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
03:12:43.279 --> 03:12:44.910 align:start position:0%
revenue
for

03:12:44.910 --> 03:12:44.920 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:12:48.670 --> 03:12:48.680 align:start position:0%
5143 either
 
03:12:51.309 --> 03:12:51.319 align:start position:0%
I will have to get back to you just to
 
03:12:54.349 --> 03:12:54.359 align:start position:0%
verify the where the revenue is coming
 
03:12:57.190 --> 03:12:57.200 align:start position:0%
in but I I will do that would would
 
03:12:59.550 --> 03:12:59.560 align:start position:0%
would it be the objective to to match
 
03:13:02.630 --> 03:13:02.640 align:start position:0%
the revenue to the the expense Center or
 
03:13:04.870 --> 03:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
or would you just sweep it under a
 
03:13:06.389 --> 03:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
general account
 
03:13:09.110 --> 03:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
somewhere I I I I I I need to look into
 
03:13:10.830 --> 03:13:10.840 align:start position:0%
the details just to verify the revenue
 
03:13:14.349 --> 03:13:14.359 align:start position:0%
Source I don't misspeak okay uh
 
03:13:18.030 --> 03:13:18.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:18.040 --> 03:13:18.990 align:start position:0%
 
oh

03:13:18.990 --> 03:13:19.000 align:start position:0%
oh
 
03:13:24.670 --> 03:13:24.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:27.150 --> 03:13:27.160 align:start position:0%
what okay
 
03:13:31.550 --> 03:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
uh so so you think uh line
 
03:13:34.469 --> 03:13:34.479 align:start position:0%
009 on page
 
03:13:39.150 --> 03:13:39.160 align:start position:0%
1048 where it says agency income in 25
 
03:13:40.950 --> 03:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
where it says
 
03:13:44.229 --> 03:13:44.239 align:start position:0%
35,600 you think that may be a licensing
 
03:13:44.239 --> 03:13:47.710 align:start position:0%
35,600 you think that may be a licensing
fee

03:13:47.710 --> 03:13:47.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:50.830 --> 03:13:50.840 align:start position:0%
I I I I believe and and again I I I
 
03:13:52.830 --> 03:13:52.840 align:start position:0%
don't really want to verify talk about
 
03:13:54.229 --> 03:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
this until we verify but I believe it's
 
03:13:56.630 --> 03:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
in 5146
 
03:14:03.510 --> 03:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:06.030 --> 03:14:06.040 align:start position:0%
bottom but but but again I I'd like to
 
03:14:08.110 --> 03:14:08.120 align:start position:0%
take that back and verify it okay
 
03:14:09.790 --> 03:14:09.800 align:start position:0%
because that's summarized under Health
 
03:14:12.269 --> 03:14:12.279 align:start position:0%
Facilities admin but okay that's why I'd
 
03:14:15.309 --> 03:14:15.319 align:start position:0%
like to take it back all right super are
 
03:14:18.389 --> 03:14:18.399 align:start position:0%
there other questions on the on the
 
03:14:23.229 --> 03:14:23.239 align:start position:0%
licensing I see you've got n 19 people
 
03:14:25.830 --> 03:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
is that the right number you got 19
 
03:14:28.670 --> 03:14:28.680 align:start position:0%
people in child care licensing what
 
03:14:30.630 --> 03:14:30.640 align:start position:0%
what's your vacancy
 
03:14:36.349 --> 03:14:36.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:48.309 --> 03:14:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:50.590 --> 03:14:50.600 align:start position:0%
you don't have it yeah we we don't have
 
03:14:52.150 --> 03:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
it at that level of detail we can
 
03:14:53.670 --> 03:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
certainly get that there was one
 
03:14:56.389 --> 03:14:56.399 align:start position:0%
unfunded position in childcare licensing
 
03:15:02.030 --> 03:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
and accounting unit 5143 though okay one
 
03:15:05.670 --> 03:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
unfunded and I don't expect there to be
 
03:15:07.990 --> 03:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
a substantial job description
 
03:15:10.150 --> 03:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
requirements for these
 
03:15:13.469 --> 03:15:13.479 align:start position:0%
19 that that they don't have a criminal
 
03:15:16.510 --> 03:15:16.520 align:start position:0%
record that they're able to communicate
 
03:15:18.710 --> 03:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
effectively I you don't have like a
 
03:15:18.720 --> 03:15:19.870 align:start position:0%
effectively I you don't have like a
degree

03:15:19.870 --> 03:15:19.880 align:start position:0%
degree
 
03:15:21.830 --> 03:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
requirement um I would have to go back
 
03:15:24.910 --> 03:15:24.920 align:start position:0%
to their job description I believe that
 
03:15:27.790 --> 03:15:27.800 align:start position:0%
um a majority of our folks do have an
 
03:15:29.990 --> 03:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
early childhood de uh development kind
 
03:15:32.030 --> 03:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
of degree so I would have to go back to
 
03:15:35.030 --> 03:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
see if that's just the nature of the job
 
03:15:36.910 --> 03:15:36.920 align:start position:0%
or if they act if it's a requirement on
 
03:15:39.229 --> 03:15:39.239 align:start position:0%
the job description okay I'd appreciate
 
03:15:42.550 --> 03:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
that distinction um and then I don't see
 
03:15:44.910 --> 03:15:44.920 align:start position:0%
any other questions you want to
 
03:15:48.150 --> 03:15:48.160 align:start position:0%
entertain so similar question on page
 
03:15:51.030 --> 03:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
1050 under positions you got 32
 
03:15:54.030 --> 03:15:54.040 align:start position:0%
positions there are do you know if any
 
03:15:56.229 --> 03:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
of those have been
 
03:15:58.469 --> 03:15:58.479 align:start position:0%
unfunded yeah there was um some that
 
03:16:02.150 --> 03:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:04.910 --> 03:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
team I don't know you I think it was um
 
03:16:07.309 --> 03:16:07.319 align:start position:0%
ju just to clarify you indicated page
 
03:16:10.110 --> 03:16:10.120 align:start position:0%
1050 this is for the accounting unit
 
03:16:12.550 --> 03:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
5146 yeah I moved over to health
 
03:16:14.830 --> 03:16:14.840 align:start position:0%
facilities am I not on Health Facilities
 
03:16:14.840 --> 03:16:15.750 align:start position:0%
facilities am I not on Health Facilities
by

03:16:15.750 --> 03:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
by
 
03:16:18.229 --> 03:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
right yeah yeah so so there's five
 
03:16:23.510 --> 03:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:23.520 --> 03:16:25.030 align:start position:0%
 
5146

03:16:25.030 --> 03:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
5146
 
03:16:29.189 --> 03:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
okay now I see I see big numbers here in
 
03:16:31.990 --> 03:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
the um case
 
03:16:35.349 --> 03:16:35.359 align:start position:0%
loads um do you have a a backlog
 
03:16:38.110 --> 03:16:38.120 align:start position:0%
currently or or what what's your general
 
03:16:40.670 --> 03:16:40.680 align:start position:0%
response time when you get a fresh
 
03:16:45.150 --> 03:16:45.160 align:start position:0%
complaint so it depends on um typically
 
03:16:48.070 --> 03:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
we go out within 24 to 48 hours if it's
 
03:16:49.510 --> 03:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
something that we believe is a risk to
 
03:16:52.349 --> 03:16:52.359 align:start position:0%
health and safety um it would be almost
 
03:16:55.150 --> 03:16:55.160 align:start position:0%
immediately um if it's something that's
 
03:16:59.670 --> 03:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
a little less uh you know of a risk
 
03:17:01.469 --> 03:17:01.479 align:start position:0%
essentially it could be you know those
 
03:17:04.389 --> 03:17:04.399 align:start position:0%
48 hours to potentially a week are there
 
03:17:07.110 --> 03:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
are regulations through CMS that our
 
03:17:09.309 --> 03:17:09.319 align:start position:0%
teams have to go in at their Direction
 
03:17:11.429 --> 03:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
so there are times where CMS says no you
 
03:17:13.750 --> 03:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
need to go in today and so we'd have to
 
03:17:15.910 --> 03:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
follow that for our certification team
 
03:17:17.830 --> 03:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
but the licensing team has a little bit
 
03:17:20.630 --> 03:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
more flexibility generally we're we're
 
03:17:22.750 --> 03:17:22.760 align:start position:0%
out there very very quickly we don't we
 
03:17:24.510 --> 03:17:24.520 align:start position:0%
don't let things sit so we do not have a
 
03:17:28.950 --> 03:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
backlog and and if if um if if somebody
 
03:17:31.469 --> 03:17:31.479 align:start position:0%
has a CFI and they're staying at their
 
03:17:33.389 --> 03:17:33.399 align:start position:0%
own home there's no requirement to
 
03:17:35.710 --> 03:17:35.720 align:start position:0%
inspect their own that home right
 
03:17:37.630 --> 03:17:37.640 align:start position:0%
correct we don't we do not inspect their
 
03:17:39.870 --> 03:17:39.880 align:start position:0%
homes what what's what's the smallest
 
03:17:42.950 --> 03:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
unit of care that you do end up
 
03:17:42.960 --> 03:17:44.870 align:start position:0%
unit of care that you do end up
inspecting

03:17:44.870 --> 03:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
inspecting
 
03:17:47.429 --> 03:17:47.439 align:start position:0%
um I don't know we don't NE neily go by
 
03:17:49.349 --> 03:17:49.359 align:start position:0%
that we go by The Entity we license The
 
03:17:53.349 --> 03:17:53.359 align:start position:0%
Entity so if if a home health agency is
 
03:17:56.630 --> 03:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
responsible for providing uh home health
 
03:17:58.870 --> 03:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
care for individuals we will inspect the
 
03:18:01.389 --> 03:18:01.399 align:start position:0%
agency we will ensure we'll look at
 
03:18:03.950 --> 03:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
their medical records we'll take samples
 
03:18:06.590 --> 03:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
of those we'll we'll you know obviously
 
03:18:09.110 --> 03:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
take complaints and and inspect them but
 
03:18:10.790 --> 03:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't go into somebody's physical
 
03:18:12.950 --> 03:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
home um but we may reach out to an
 
03:18:14.550 --> 03:18:14.560 align:start position:0%
individual who's receiving that care to
 
03:18:16.429 --> 03:18:16.439 align:start position:0%
see if there's any concerns related to
 
03:18:19.030 --> 03:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
the care so um it would really all be
 
03:18:21.910 --> 03:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
around the entity and not the individual
 
03:18:24.790 --> 03:18:24.800 align:start position:0%
that's receiving the care okay and and
 
03:18:26.710 --> 03:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
and although a home health agency
 
03:18:29.750 --> 03:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily have a facility
 
03:18:32.229 --> 03:18:32.239 align:start position:0%
because it goes out to support you would
 
03:18:34.910 --> 03:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
still inspect the agency even though
 
03:18:37.070 --> 03:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
you're not inspecting a facility correct
 
03:18:38.269 --> 03:18:38.279 align:start position:0%
we would make sure that their
 
03:18:40.229 --> 03:18:40.239 align:start position:0%
information is secure that people's
 
03:18:42.510 --> 03:18:42.520 align:start position:0%
privacy is being considered um you know
 
03:18:44.550 --> 03:18:44.560 align:start position:0%
so we do actually look at those those
 
03:18:48.150 --> 03:18:48.160 align:start position:0%
agencies practices all right Senor yes
 
03:18:50.590 --> 03:18:50.600 align:start position:0%
pleas thank you for taking questions
 
03:18:53.790 --> 03:18:53.800 align:start position:0%
sure um I assume and if I'm wrong foster
 
03:18:55.590 --> 03:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
care is outside of the perview of what
 
03:18:57.830 --> 03:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
you do correct foster care is licensed
 
03:18:57.840 --> 03:19:01.550 align:start position:0%
you do correct foster care is licensed
under

03:19:01.550 --> 03:19:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:03.910 --> 03:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
dcyf representative
 
03:19:06.710 --> 03:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
priest thank you Mr chairman
 
03:19:09.750 --> 03:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
um again back to community
 
03:19:12.150 --> 03:19:12.160 align:start position:0%
residences so what I'm hearing is that
 
03:19:14.269 --> 03:19:14.279 align:start position:0%
you don't
 
03:19:17.150 --> 03:19:17.160 align:start position:0%
certify group homes up to five
 
03:19:19.469 --> 03:19:19.479 align:start position:0%
individuals we certify everyone so even
 
03:19:21.630 --> 03:19:21.640 align:start position:0%
if a facility if a if a home has even
 
03:19:23.910 --> 03:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
one individual in it we still certify
 
03:19:27.229 --> 03:19:27.239 align:start position:0%
them do you me do you monitor them so
 
03:19:29.110 --> 03:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
there's no absolutely we do yep
 
03:19:30.830 --> 03:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
inspections and they get a certification
 
03:19:33.830 --> 03:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
the only time they get a license um
 
03:19:35.750 --> 03:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
which is is when they have bigger
 
03:19:37.189 --> 03:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
facilities so they required to have
 
03:19:39.910 --> 03:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
certification and a license when you say
 
03:19:42.510 --> 03:19:42.520 align:start position:0%
bigger facilities what four or more four
 
03:19:44.710 --> 03:19:44.720 align:start position:0%
or more four or more but either way
 
03:19:46.189 --> 03:19:46.199 align:start position:0%
they're getting they're getting a full
 
03:19:48.150 --> 03:19:48.160 align:start position:0%
inspection related to the certification
 
03:19:52.429 --> 03:19:52.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:55.510 --> 03:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
you okay I I don't think I I have a
 
03:19:57.229 --> 03:19:57.239 align:start position:0%
question that there's no answer for
 
03:19:59.750 --> 03:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
which is uh what What's the average
 
03:20:01.870 --> 03:20:01.880 align:start position:0%
length of time to do an inspection I
 
03:20:04.990 --> 03:20:05.000 align:start position:0%
guess it just would be facility
 
03:20:07.150 --> 03:20:07.160 align:start position:0%
variable how how long it takes us to do
 
03:20:09.189 --> 03:20:09.199 align:start position:0%
an inspection yeah very very facility
 
03:20:13.429 --> 03:20:13.439 align:start position:0%
variable um however you know very small
 
03:20:16.110 --> 03:20:16.120 align:start position:0%
facilities also um we may be at an say
 
03:20:17.910 --> 03:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
an assisted living if it's a large
 
03:20:19.309 --> 03:20:19.319 align:start position:0%
Assisted Living we could be there for a
 
03:20:20.990 --> 03:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
week and if it's a small Assisted Living
 
03:20:25.070 --> 03:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
just a few days depending on on the size
 
03:20:28.269 --> 03:20:28.279 align:start position:0%
okay all right I I don't see any other
 
03:20:29.670 --> 03:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
questions on this do you want to go to
 
03:20:33.790 --> 03:20:33.800 align:start position:0%
the next sure absolutely uh so our next
 
03:20:36.110 --> 03:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
is our Bureau for Legal Services um
 
03:20:38.950 --> 03:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
there's lots of uh things that fall
 
03:20:41.830 --> 03:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
under that Bureau general
 
03:20:45.710 --> 03:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
counsel is uh our is basically our group
 
03:20:48.269 --> 03:20:48.279 align:start position:0%
of attorneys and uh other legal
 
03:20:51.510 --> 03:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
professionals who perform services to
 
03:20:53.309 --> 03:20:53.319 align:start position:0%
the entire department legal services to
 
03:20:56.150 --> 03:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
the entire department so they could be
 
03:20:58.710 --> 03:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
uh in they could be reviewing laws and
 
03:21:01.150 --> 03:21:01.160 align:start position:0%
rules and giving um legal advice on the
 
03:21:03.670 --> 03:21:03.680 align:start position:0%
interpretation of things they also could
 
03:21:06.429 --> 03:21:06.439 align:start position:0%
be um attending hearings that on behalf
 
03:21:08.670 --> 03:21:08.680 align:start position:0%
of the state for services that that were
 
03:21:11.510 --> 03:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
were not provided um they may represent
 
03:21:13.229 --> 03:21:13.239 align:start position:0%
the department in court they may
 
03:21:14.870 --> 03:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
represent the department in an
 
03:21:18.030 --> 03:21:18.040 align:start position:0%
administrative hearing um um you know
 
03:21:19.910 --> 03:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
guardianships all of those type of
 
03:21:23.070 --> 03:21:23.080 align:start position:0%
things so our general Council does do a
 
03:21:25.950 --> 03:21:25.960 align:start position:0%
lot of um internal external audits
 
03:21:27.750 --> 03:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
they're responding obviously to lawsuits
 
03:21:30.910 --> 03:21:30.920 align:start position:0%
Federal compliance um developing
 
03:21:33.469 --> 03:21:33.479 align:start position:0%
policies um obviously interpretations
 
03:21:36.590 --> 03:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
investigating things so uh I don't I
 
03:21:38.110 --> 03:21:38.120 align:start position:0%
mean there's there's a lot of work they
 
03:21:39.790 --> 03:21:39.800 align:start position:0%
cover the entire department the Bureau
 
03:21:41.950 --> 03:21:41.960 align:start position:0%
of general counsel has somebody so we
 
03:21:44.150 --> 03:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
have like one attorney that represents
 
03:21:45.830 --> 03:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
Medicaid we have one attorney that
 
03:21:47.750 --> 03:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
represents our long-term supports and
 
03:21:50.030 --> 03:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
services so that's generally what our
 
03:21:51.830 --> 03:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
general Council does so so I'm looking
 
03:21:55.550 --> 03:21:55.560 align:start position:0%
at page 151 uh for the Governor's budget
 
03:21:59.150 --> 03:21:59.160 align:start position:0%
in 26 I see a total of 100 positions is
 
03:22:02.189 --> 03:22:02.199 align:start position:0%
that for this legal council office so
 
03:22:04.429 --> 03:22:04.439 align:start position:0%
that includes our child support
 
03:22:06.189 --> 03:22:06.199 align:start position:0%
attorneys and all of our DC wife
 
03:22:07.429 --> 03:22:07.439 align:start position:0%
attorneys as
 
03:22:11.070 --> 03:22:11.080 align:start position:0%
well and and um two two things i' just
 
03:22:12.750 --> 03:22:12.760 align:start position:0%
like to point out in in the accounting
 
03:22:14.750 --> 03:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
unit 560
 
03:22:18.429 --> 03:22:18.439 align:start position:0%
5680 um first there's there's 13
 
03:22:20.710 --> 03:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
unfunded positions in total there's
 
03:22:23.349 --> 03:22:23.359 align:start position:0%
there's um two classified and 11
 
03:22:26.269 --> 03:22:26.279 align:start position:0%
unclassified and one thing that will
 
03:22:29.309 --> 03:22:29.319 align:start position:0%
certainly catch your eye is you will see
 
03:22:31.870 --> 03:22:31.880 align:start position:0%
a pretty steep decrease in funding in
 
03:22:34.469 --> 03:22:34.479 align:start position:0%
the class 10 Personnel line and a pretty
 
03:22:38.510 --> 03:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
uh steep increase in the class 12 line
 
03:22:42.030 --> 03:22:42.040 align:start position:0%
um during the last budget uh chapter 79
 
03:22:44.229 --> 03:22:44.239 align:start position:0%
section 218 laws of
 
03:22:48.510 --> 03:22:48.520 align:start position:0%
2023 we the um um there was a provision
 
03:22:51.710 --> 03:22:51.720 align:start position:0%
of law in in House Bill 2 that converted
 
03:22:54.790 --> 03:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
the classified attorneys to
 
03:22:56.910 --> 03:22:56.920 align:start position:0%
unclassified and so that's also at the
 
03:22:59.550 --> 03:22:59.560 align:start position:0%
bottom why you'll see that change in in
 
03:23:01.349 --> 03:23:01.359 align:start position:0%
numbering as far as unclassified
 
03:23:03.670 --> 03:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
positions versus classified and and that
 
03:23:05.870 --> 03:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
speaks to most of that on top of that
 
03:23:08.550 --> 03:23:08.560 align:start position:0%
again we had 13 unfunded in this uh
 
03:23:11.910 --> 03:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:14.750 --> 03:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
budget did I did I hear you say you're
 
03:23:18.070 --> 03:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
involved in law suits I I thought once
 
03:23:21.630 --> 03:23:21.640 align:start position:0%
the lawsuit was filed uh the AG handled
 
03:23:25.309 --> 03:23:25.319 align:start position:0%
it and and you consult it so the AG does
 
03:23:27.750 --> 03:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
take over and represent the department
 
03:23:30.750 --> 03:23:30.760 align:start position:0%
in um when the department is sued
 
03:23:32.750 --> 03:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
specifically for for
 
03:23:35.750 --> 03:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
issues they we do have to perform as you
 
03:23:37.550 --> 03:23:37.560 align:start position:0%
can imagine an enormous amount of
 
03:23:39.110 --> 03:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
Discovery for those so we do have
 
03:23:41.030 --> 03:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
attorneys that handle those Discovery
 
03:23:43.790 --> 03:23:43.800 align:start position:0%
requests we also um a lot of times are
 
03:23:45.550 --> 03:23:45.560 align:start position:0%
served and have to start the process for
 
03:23:47.150 --> 03:23:47.160 align:start position:0%
the lawsuit and then send it over to the
 
03:23:50.229 --> 03:23:50.239 align:start position:0%
doj and then we're involved in strategy
 
03:23:53.189 --> 03:23:53.199 align:start position:0%
sessions and other things um you know
 
03:23:56.790 --> 03:23:56.800 align:start position:0%
that that would relate to the lawsuit so
 
03:23:59.189 --> 03:23:59.199 align:start position:0%
so that reminds me of a question I asked
 
03:24:03.830 --> 03:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
two or four years ago um have has has
 
03:24:05.910 --> 03:24:05.920 align:start position:0%
the state or
 
03:24:09.670 --> 03:24:09.680 align:start position:0%
DHHS obtained an eisc Discovery system
 
03:24:11.910 --> 03:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
to help you with Discovery or are you
 
03:24:14.229 --> 03:24:14.239 align:start position:0%
still doing it the oldfashioned way so
 
03:24:18.830 --> 03:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
we do have um we have a couple of um
 
03:24:21.349 --> 03:24:21.359 align:start position:0%
programs that do assist with uh
 
03:24:23.830 --> 03:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
Discovery but we haven't although we
 
03:24:25.990 --> 03:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
have them available we have not kicked
 
03:24:29.150 --> 03:24:29.160 align:start position:0%
them off fully and I think Dave weers
 
03:24:30.229 --> 03:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
who's here in the audience could
 
03:24:32.910 --> 03:24:32.920 align:start position:0%
probably talk a little bit more about um
 
03:24:35.469 --> 03:24:35.479 align:start position:0%
where we are in the integration of of
 
03:24:38.150 --> 03:24:38.160 align:start position:0%
that of those programs so I would assume
 
03:24:40.389 --> 03:24:40.399 align:start position:0%
if you had the eisc discovery systems
 
03:24:42.510 --> 03:24:42.520 align:start position:0%
working that that would save a
 
03:24:45.229 --> 03:24:45.239 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of Manpower it C it
 
03:24:47.469 --> 03:24:47.479 align:start position:0%
can yeah absolutely but we have to I
 
03:24:48.990 --> 03:24:49.000 align:start position:0%
mean as you can imagine some of these
 
03:24:52.110 --> 03:24:52.120 align:start position:0%
lawsuits you know spend years and so
 
03:24:56.429 --> 03:24:56.439 align:start position:0%
getting all of that data yeah yeah yeah
 
03:24:59.189 --> 03:24:59.199 align:start position:0%
where where do you keep your offline
 
03:25:01.269 --> 03:25:01.279 align:start position:0%
records are they in some building here
 
03:25:04.389 --> 03:25:04.399 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire or so our paper records
 
03:25:06.790 --> 03:25:06.800 align:start position:0%
um a lot of them are kept in our
 
03:25:09.630 --> 03:25:09.640 align:start position:0%
archives um in the archives and we we
 
03:25:11.710 --> 03:25:11.720 align:start position:0%
retrieve them from archives it's not a
 
03:25:15.030 --> 03:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
lime cave is it by any
 
03:25:17.110 --> 03:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
chance uh yeah yeah and then there's
 
03:25:19.670 --> 03:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
others we we keep stored at at in the
 
03:25:23.269 --> 03:25:23.279 align:start position:0%
buildings in which we occupy so are we
 
03:25:26.950 --> 03:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
are we aging out to where our um record
 
03:25:29.189 --> 03:25:29.199 align:start position:0%
retention period is being reached and we
 
03:25:31.670 --> 03:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
can retire more and more paper records
 
03:25:34.389 --> 03:25:34.399 align:start position:0%
or do you have some obligation to keep a
 
03:25:37.269 --> 03:25:37.279 align:start position:0%
record for 40 or 50 years or life of a
 
03:25:39.630 --> 03:25:39.640 align:start position:0%
patient or something yeah so it depends
 
03:25:42.590 --> 03:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
it really does um you know DCF has you
 
03:25:46.309 --> 03:25:46.319 align:start position:0%
know 30 Years or or however longer um
 
03:25:47.670 --> 03:25:47.680 align:start position:0%
you know a lot of them have all
 
03:25:49.510 --> 03:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
different time periods we're actually
 
03:25:50.990 --> 03:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
that's one of our projects on the road
 
03:25:53.950 --> 03:25:53.960 align:start position:0%
map is that we're um Gathering all of
 
03:25:57.150 --> 03:25:57.160 align:start position:0%
that information and ensuring that the
 
03:25:59.469 --> 03:25:59.479 align:start position:0%
time periods where we are to keep data
 
03:26:01.469 --> 03:26:01.479 align:start position:0%
and then we're able to purge the data
 
03:26:03.830 --> 03:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
that that shouldn't be kept um to ensure
 
03:26:06.150 --> 03:26:06.160 align:start position:0%
privacy so we're doing all of that leg
 
03:26:08.110 --> 03:26:08.120 align:start position:0%
work right now that's actually an
 
03:26:10.429 --> 03:26:10.439 align:start position:0%
initiative that's that we're working on
 
03:26:12.630 --> 03:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
so if I were to find the commissioner's
 
03:26:15.150 --> 03:26:15.160 align:start position:0%
road map you're you're you're a square
 
03:26:17.590 --> 03:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
somewhere in there to the data retention
 
03:26:19.990 --> 03:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
work absolutely yep it's uh commitment
 
03:26:21.269 --> 03:26:21.279 align:start position:0%
three initiative
 
03:26:24.110 --> 03:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
four yeah I got it
 
03:26:27.229 --> 03:26:27.239 align:start position:0%
right okay are there uh yes represent
 
03:26:29.229 --> 03:26:29.239 align:start position:0%
torki thank you thank you for taking my
 
03:26:31.670 --> 03:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
question I jumped ahead a couple pages
 
03:26:34.910 --> 03:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
to page 15 to the list of active
 
03:26:39.110 --> 03:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
litigation and um looking at in
 
03:26:41.630 --> 03:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
particular the first two bullet points
 
03:26:45.189 --> 03:26:45.199 align:start position:0%
and the sheer number of um cases and
 
03:26:47.870 --> 03:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
pending cases and then going back to the
 
03:26:49.950 --> 03:26:49.960 align:start position:0%
statement that you have 13 unfunded
 
03:26:55.150 --> 03:26:55.160 align:start position:0%
positions so I'm just curious about how
 
03:27:00.229 --> 03:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
your department there can manage um is
 
03:27:02.550 --> 03:27:02.560 align:start position:0%
everything being addressed in a timely
 
03:27:05.269 --> 03:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
manner that there is not damage being
 
03:27:09.150 --> 03:27:09.160 align:start position:0%
done to one party or the other yes I I
 
03:27:11.550 --> 03:27:11.560 align:start position:0%
say I would say that we definitely have
 
03:27:15.349 --> 03:27:15.359 align:start position:0%
an ability to manage that at the onset
 
03:27:17.790 --> 03:27:17.800 align:start position:0%
of all the claims that were processed
 
03:27:21.790 --> 03:27:21.800 align:start position:0%
for the YDC litigation it wasn't um we
 
03:27:23.950 --> 03:27:23.960 align:start position:0%
didn't have our ducks in a row at that
 
03:27:25.830 --> 03:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
point it did take a little bit longer to
 
03:27:27.550 --> 03:27:27.560 align:start position:0%
kind of understand the volume and try to
 
03:27:29.030 --> 03:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
get all the documents there are people
 
03:27:30.910 --> 03:27:30.920 align:start position:0%
in basements ensuring that we were
 
03:27:32.469 --> 03:27:32.479 align:start position:0%
gathering as much information as we
 
03:27:34.510 --> 03:27:34.520 align:start position:0%
possibly could we have a very good
 
03:27:36.070 --> 03:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
system in place now and it took us a
 
03:27:37.349 --> 03:27:37.359 align:start position:0%
little time but we definitely have a
 
03:27:39.070 --> 03:27:39.080 align:start position:0%
system in place now and we're able to
 
03:27:42.110 --> 03:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
respond very timely thank you
 
03:27:42.120 --> 03:27:43.830 align:start position:0%
respond very timely thank you
representative

03:27:43.830 --> 03:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:27:46.990 --> 03:27:47.000 align:start position:0%
priest thank you Mr chairman um
 
03:27:48.630 --> 03:27:48.640 align:start position:0%

03:27:48.640 --> 03:27:51.510 align:start position:0%
going back
to

03:27:51.510 --> 03:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:27:55.630 --> 03:27:55.640 align:start position:0%
um going back to uh page
 
03:28:00.950 --> 03:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
1050 of 01 I mean 010
 
03:28:03.550 --> 03:28:03.560 align:start position:0%
012 you you mentioned there was some
 
03:28:07.429 --> 03:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
regulation that caused staff to be
 
03:28:11.189 --> 03:28:11.199 align:start position:0%
disass ified and others explain that to
 
03:28:14.830 --> 03:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
me again please and when did that happen
 
03:28:17.189 --> 03:28:17.199 align:start position:0%
wasn't that just a legislative act to
 
03:28:20.030 --> 03:28:20.040 align:start position:0%
move people from class to unclass or
 
03:28:22.590 --> 03:28:22.600 align:start position:0%
vice yeah that's exactly it so um
 
03:28:26.229 --> 03:28:26.239 align:start position:0%
working with the legislature uh in 2023
 
03:28:28.910 --> 03:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
there was a mandate for the Department
 
03:28:33.349 --> 03:28:33.359 align:start position:0%
to move all of the DCF attorneys to from
 
03:28:35.710 --> 03:28:35.720 align:start position:0%
classified positions to unclassified
 
03:28:38.510 --> 03:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
positions and then as of June 30th of
 
03:28:41.510 --> 03:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
2025 this year abolish the classified
 
03:28:42.910 --> 03:28:42.920 align:start position:0%
positions once we were able to move
 
03:28:44.389 --> 03:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
everyone over so you're going to see
 
03:28:46.750 --> 03:28:46.760 align:start position:0%
that in the budget how that that change
 
03:28:50.269 --> 03:28:50.279 align:start position:0%
so they're the same amount of staff the
 
03:28:52.469 --> 03:28:52.479 align:start position:0%
same or at least without the unfunded
 
03:28:54.750 --> 03:28:54.760 align:start position:0%
positions not considering those the
 
03:28:56.870 --> 03:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
Mandate was same amount of staff same
 
03:28:58.070 --> 03:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
positions they're just moving from
 
03:28:59.990 --> 03:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
classified to unclassified and the
 
03:29:03.110 --> 03:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
reason for this was just because of the
 
03:29:06.710 --> 03:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
work required to address this correct as
 
03:29:08.990 --> 03:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
I remember the legislative debate
 
03:29:12.830 --> 03:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
unclass is a salaried position and
 
03:29:16.510 --> 03:29:16.520 align:start position:0%
classified as a hourly position yeah and
 
03:29:19.550 --> 03:29:19.560 align:start position:0%
so I think it was uh one to
 
03:29:22.309 --> 03:29:22.319 align:start position:0%
professionalize uh the the staff and to
 
03:29:25.189 --> 03:29:25.199 align:start position:0%
also maybe uh save some money on
 
03:29:28.309 --> 03:29:28.319 align:start position:0%
overtime okay all makes sense not that
 
03:29:30.150 --> 03:29:30.160 align:start position:0%
we would ever do that because we worry
 
03:29:33.030 --> 03:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
about the quality of the litigation
 
03:29:36.429 --> 03:29:36.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:40.590 --> 03:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
you so uh as as identified already child
 
03:29:42.229 --> 03:29:42.239 align:start position:0%
support our child support Council our
 
03:29:44.870 --> 03:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
child support um Bureau and the DCF
 
03:29:48.150 --> 03:29:48.160 align:start position:0%
Council they are in our budget DCF
 
03:29:52.670 --> 03:29:52.680 align:start position:0%
council do actually report up from a um
 
03:29:55.870 --> 03:29:55.880 align:start position:0%
you know from a job perspective from
 
03:29:58.150 --> 03:29:58.160 align:start position:0%
kind of the tasks and the roles of those
 
03:30:00.269 --> 03:30:00.279 align:start position:0%
positions they report to the Attorney
 
03:30:02.630 --> 03:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
General's office but they are in our
 
03:30:06.269 --> 03:30:06.279 align:start position:0%
budget so um they dictate their their
 
03:30:09.469 --> 03:30:09.479 align:start position:0%
work but we we manage their them from an
 
03:30:11.150 --> 03:30:11.160 align:start position:0%
administrative perspective so that's why
 
03:30:13.590 --> 03:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
you see d2f Council
 
03:30:16.269 --> 03:30:16.279 align:start position:0%
here so for that to make sense from a
 
03:30:18.590 --> 03:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
budgeting perspective the department
 
03:30:20.750 --> 03:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
should still exercise a significant
 
03:30:23.550 --> 03:30:23.560 align:start position:0%
amount of control over the the work
 
03:30:25.830 --> 03:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
products even though they report to the
 
03:30:28.189 --> 03:30:28.199 align:start position:0%
AG we work very closely together as you
 
03:30:31.110 --> 03:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
can imagine and um yes I absolutely
 
03:30:32.830 --> 03:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
think that we have a great working
 
03:30:34.910 --> 03:30:34.920 align:start position:0%
relationship and a partnership to ensure
 
03:30:37.550 --> 03:30:37.560 align:start position:0%
that people are um being taken care of
 
03:30:39.110 --> 03:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
and that they are able to do their job
 
03:30:41.110 --> 03:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
but that we also are being fiscally
 
03:30:43.030 --> 03:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
responsible but it's more than a
 
03:30:45.510 --> 03:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
caretaker role it's a it's a leadership
 
03:30:49.269 --> 03:30:49.279 align:start position:0%
super advisory uh quality of work
 
03:30:50.950 --> 03:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
relationship between the department
 
03:30:53.309 --> 03:30:53.319 align:start position:0%
Absol absolutely uh if de Baker were
 
03:30:55.309 --> 03:30:55.319 align:start position:0%
here she's the um she's the person in
 
03:30:57.870 --> 03:30:57.880 align:start position:0%
charge she is the head of DCF Council
 
03:30:59.910 --> 03:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
she would tell you that the exact thing
 
03:31:02.710 --> 03:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
we we definitely work together super uh
 
03:31:05.670 --> 03:31:05.680 align:start position:0%
did we skip Ombudsman or haven't gotten
 
03:31:07.990 --> 03:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
there yet all right yeah um the next
 
03:31:10.070 --> 03:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
thing I had was legislative Services we
 
03:31:12.910 --> 03:31:12.920 align:start position:0%
have um director of uh legislation John
 
03:31:14.510 --> 03:31:14.520 align:start position:0%
Williams who many of you probably
 
03:31:16.630 --> 03:31:16.640 align:start position:0%
already know and have met um and then
 
03:31:19.309 --> 03:31:19.319 align:start position:0%
our legislative Leons we have uh an
 
03:31:21.070 --> 03:31:21.080 align:start position:0%
enormous amount of legislative lons
 
03:31:24.870 --> 03:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
they're those are folks they're not um
 
03:31:26.630 --> 03:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
Standalone these are all of the
 
03:31:28.189 --> 03:31:28.199 align:start position:0%
attorneys that have been that are part
 
03:31:30.510 --> 03:31:30.520 align:start position:0%
of our general Council they perform
 
03:31:33.110 --> 03:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
legislative Services as well so um
 
03:31:35.030 --> 03:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
that's one of their roles within their
 
03:31:36.830 --> 03:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
job and we just wanted to point that out
 
03:31:38.870 --> 03:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
because you do see a lot of our general
 
03:31:42.110 --> 03:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
counsel staff coming through um to
 
03:31:44.229 --> 03:31:44.239 align:start position:0%
represent the department on different
 
03:31:46.750 --> 03:31:46.760 align:start position:0%
things but they are they are not their
 
03:31:50.670 --> 03:31:50.680 align:start position:0%
own um it's not their own uh you know
 
03:31:53.269 --> 03:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
position it is not just legislative lons
 
03:31:55.710 --> 03:31:55.720 align:start position:0%
we actually have they are doing that
 
03:31:58.070 --> 03:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
work as general members of general
 
03:32:01.429 --> 03:32:01.439 align:start position:0%
counsel so so what what class line are
 
03:32:03.189 --> 03:32:03.199 align:start position:0%
you on what four
 
03:32:07.510 --> 03:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
digit they would fall in um in yeah in
 
03:32:16.510 --> 03:32:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:21.830 --> 03:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
it it's accounting unit 5680 or 5680 568
 
03:32:24.229 --> 03:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
5680 the the the general Council which
 
03:32:27.630 --> 03:32:27.640 align:start position:0%
begins on 1050 and continues on 1051 um
 
03:32:29.670 --> 03:32:29.680 align:start position:0%
and and to to Melissa's point the
 
03:32:32.590 --> 03:32:32.600 align:start position:0%
legislative Le Liaisons those there's a
 
03:32:34.349 --> 03:32:34.359 align:start position:0%
number of positions that sit in other
 
03:32:36.790 --> 03:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
bureaus and acting as a legislative
 
03:32:40.349 --> 03:32:40.359 align:start position:0%
leison is only one of their job
 
03:32:42.349 --> 03:32:42.359 align:start position:0%
responsibilities um they also do many
 
03:32:43.750 --> 03:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
other things within their respective
 
03:32:46.429 --> 03:32:46.439 align:start position:0%
areas as well but it's it's more of a
 
03:32:48.429 --> 03:32:48.439 align:start position:0%
organizational this is the only way we
 
03:32:49.870 --> 03:32:49.880 align:start position:0%
could address the hundreds of bills
 
03:32:52.070 --> 03:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
affecting DHHS each year to track it
 
03:32:54.189 --> 03:32:54.199 align:start position:0%
right do you ever throw Mr Williams a
 
03:32:57.110 --> 03:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
case just to make sure he can still Loy
 
03:32:59.309 --> 03:32:59.319 align:start position:0%
I think he does a lot of that
 
03:33:04.150 --> 03:33:04.160 align:start position:0%
already okay all right um the next uh
 
03:33:06.990 --> 03:33:07.000 align:start position:0%
I'm on page 11 on this on the um
 
03:33:09.269 --> 03:33:09.279 align:start position:0%
PowerPoint is our administrative Appeals
 
03:33:12.110 --> 03:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
Unit our administrative Appeals Unit ma
 
03:33:14.229 --> 03:33:14.239 align:start position:0%
uh manages our adjudicative process
 
03:33:16.309 --> 03:33:16.319 align:start position:0%
that's that exists in statute
 
03:33:18.389 --> 03:33:18.399 align:start position:0%
um under RSA
 
03:33:23.110 --> 03:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
541a it is IT addresses any area and it
 
03:33:25.070 --> 03:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
and accepts appeals for any area in
 
03:33:26.990 --> 03:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
which somebody could appeal so if they
 
03:33:29.429 --> 03:33:29.439 align:start position:0%
are denied benefits or Services they
 
03:33:30.950 --> 03:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
would appeal through the administrative
 
03:33:34.269 --> 03:33:34.279 align:start position:0%
Appeals Unit um we have five
 
03:33:36.349 --> 03:33:36.359 align:start position:0%
administrative law judges and three
 
03:33:38.590 --> 03:33:38.600 align:start position:0%
clerical folks who take those and
 
03:33:41.189 --> 03:33:41.199 align:start position:0%
address those um issues on the
 
03:33:43.550 --> 03:33:43.560 align:start position:0%
PowerPoint you can see some of um some
 
03:33:45.229 --> 03:33:45.239 align:start position:0%
of the examples of some of the cases
 
03:33:46.309 --> 03:33:46.319 align:start position:0%
that we take
 
03:33:48.830 --> 03:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
um those are most common but
 
03:33:50.870 --> 03:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
certainly uh you know there's a there's
 
03:33:53.550 --> 03:33:53.560 align:start position:0%
a broad range of things that they that
 
03:33:56.670 --> 03:33:56.680 align:start position:0%
they hear and we handle a little over a
 
03:33:58.790 --> 03:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
thousand cases where we actually hear a
 
03:34:00.950 --> 03:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
case a little over a thousand of them
 
03:34:02.990 --> 03:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
throughout the year but as you can
 
03:34:05.070 --> 03:34:05.080 align:start position:0%
imagine we get a lot of appeal requests
 
03:34:07.870 --> 03:34:07.880 align:start position:0%
and um some of them aren't appealable
 
03:34:10.790 --> 03:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
issues and so we have to manage those as
 
03:34:14.309 --> 03:34:14.319 align:start position:0%
well so so administrative appeals looks
 
03:34:16.309 --> 03:34:16.319 align:start position:0%
like it's its own brand branch on the
 
03:34:19.990 --> 03:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
wire diagram what what what uh
 
03:34:23.670 --> 03:34:23.680 align:start position:0%
four-digit code or is that under also in
 
03:34:27.750 --> 03:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
general counsil it's no it's 563 okay
 
03:34:29.389 --> 03:34:29.399 align:start position:0%
that's the
 
03:34:34.630 --> 03:34:34.640 align:start position:0%
5683 83 Y and what page is that
 
03:34:40.389 --> 03:34:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:43.950 --> 03:34:43.960 align:start position:0%
y operation support Administration yes
 
03:34:50.070 --> 03:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:54.630 --> 03:34:54.640 align:start position:0%
is okay and so that's staying constant
 
03:34:56.790 --> 03:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
at eight are there any unfunded
 
03:35:01.150 --> 03:35:01.160 align:start position:0%
positions in there no um so so so there
 
03:35:03.630 --> 03:35:03.640 align:start position:0%
are no unfunded positions in there and
 
03:35:05.150 --> 03:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
uh there was a type of technically in
 
03:35:06.750 --> 03:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget there are six
 
03:35:09.070 --> 03:35:09.080 align:start position:0%
positions in that in that accounting
 
03:35:12.830 --> 03:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
unit okay so where it says eight that's
 
03:35:16.269 --> 03:35:16.279 align:start position:0%
meant to be six yes
 
03:35:20.510 --> 03:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
and so was it eight in the current year
 
03:35:23.110 --> 03:35:23.120 align:start position:0%
so there's a decline of two apologize
 
03:35:24.750 --> 03:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
eight is correct number I was reading on
 
03:35:27.389 --> 03:35:27.399 align:start position:0%
the wrong page no that's all right I I
 
03:35:30.630 --> 03:35:30.640 align:start position:0%
made a mistake once it's okay and and uh
 
03:35:33.910 --> 03:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
also operation support admin
 
03:35:38.030 --> 03:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
um has no unfunded positions that I'm
 
03:35:40.229 --> 03:35:40.239 align:start position:0%
seeing right now how how's your vacancy
 
03:35:43.070 --> 03:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
rate we're full you're
 
03:35:48.269 --> 03:35:48.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:52.229 --> 03:35:52.239 align:start position:0%
so our next two on page 12 is are the
 
03:35:55.710 --> 03:35:55.720 align:start position:0%
two EMB budsman offices that exist at uh
 
03:35:57.670 --> 03:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
at the department the first is our
 
03:36:00.070 --> 03:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
general EMB budman's office that General
 
03:36:02.189 --> 03:36:02.199 align:start position:0%
EMB budman's office is handles all
 
03:36:04.750 --> 03:36:04.760 align:start position:0%
complaints throughout for any services
 
03:36:07.110 --> 03:36:07.120 align:start position:0%
that the department provides so so I got
 
03:36:09.750 --> 03:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
to crosswalk the the budget briefing
 
03:36:13.309 --> 03:36:13.319 align:start position:0%
with where you're at also the the hb1
 
03:36:15.229 --> 03:36:15.239 align:start position:0%
what pages are we on so if you turn to
 
03:36:15.239 --> 03:36:16.389 align:start position:0%
what pages are we on so if you turn to
page

03:36:16.389 --> 03:36:16.399 align:start position:0%
page
 
03:36:18.630 --> 03:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
1053 accounting unit
 
03:36:20.670 --> 03:36:20.680 align:start position:0%
5696 um
 
03:36:23.429 --> 03:36:23.439 align:start position:0%
budsman got it and I will also talk
 
03:36:29.630 --> 03:36:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:31.990 --> 03:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
6636 accounting
 
03:36:35.830 --> 03:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
unit okay and then in the budget book
 
03:36:44.150 --> 03:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:47.030 --> 03:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
document the en criptions I don't think
 
03:36:50.150 --> 03:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
either of them are in there um so the um
 
03:36:52.189 --> 03:36:52.199 align:start position:0%
budsman is not included in there because
 
03:36:55.070 --> 03:36:55.080 align:start position:0%
it is under $1 million and the long-term
 
03:36:57.950 --> 03:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
care un budsman is also not included
 
03:36:59.189 --> 03:36:59.199 align:start position:0%
because it's also under a million
 
03:37:00.750 --> 03:37:00.760 align:start position:0%
dollars which is the threshold that we
 
03:37:02.389 --> 03:37:02.399 align:start position:0%
use for the accting units in the budget
 
03:37:05.710 --> 03:37:05.720 align:start position:0%
briefing book all right thank you uh so
 
03:37:07.910 --> 03:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
the other than the DHHS un budman which
 
03:37:10.469 --> 03:37:10.479 align:start position:0%
handles all complaints um they
 
03:37:12.790 --> 03:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
confidential complaints they address uh
 
03:37:14.830 --> 03:37:14.840 align:start position:0%
issues and they they make a
 
03:37:14.840 --> 03:37:16.030 align:start position:0%
issues and they they make a
determination

03:37:16.030 --> 03:37:16.040 align:start position:0%
determination
 
03:37:18.229 --> 03:37:18.239 align:start position:0%
they kind of look at the issue and make
 
03:37:19.830 --> 03:37:19.840 align:start position:0%
a determination as to whether or not
 
03:37:21.030 --> 03:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
they believe the department did
 
03:37:22.229 --> 03:37:22.239 align:start position:0%
something that they shouldn't have done
 
03:37:22.950 --> 03:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
and then they'll work with the
 
03:37:24.710 --> 03:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
Department to make sure it's it's in
 
03:37:26.189 --> 03:37:26.199 align:start position:0%
line with with what our rules and
 
03:37:29.590 --> 03:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
regulations are or or they'll um or
 
03:37:32.349 --> 03:37:32.359 align:start position:0%
they'll uh try to attempt to help the
 
03:37:34.349 --> 03:37:34.359 align:start position:0%
individual even if even if we have
 
03:37:35.870 --> 03:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
followed our regulations to try to
 
03:37:37.750 --> 03:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
attempt to resolve their issue so the
 
03:37:39.630 --> 03:37:39.640 align:start position:0%
EMB budsman office is is there to help
 
03:37:42.269 --> 03:37:42.279 align:start position:0%
all clients all issues across the entire
 
03:37:44.469 --> 03:37:44.479 align:start position:0%
department the office of long-term care
 
03:37:46.269 --> 03:37:46.279 align:start position:0%
and budsman is spefic specifically just
 
03:37:48.389 --> 03:37:48.399 align:start position:0%
for those who reside in long-term care
 
03:37:50.389 --> 03:37:50.399 align:start position:0%
facilities they're administratively
 
03:37:52.550 --> 03:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
attached to the department they're they
 
03:37:54.950 --> 03:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
go into long-term care facilities to
 
03:37:58.110 --> 03:37:58.120 align:start position:0%
assist in um and be advocates for the
 
03:38:00.630 --> 03:38:00.640 align:start position:0%
residents in any kind of concern or
 
03:38:02.950 --> 03:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
issue that they have um while residing
 
03:38:05.510 --> 03:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
in that long-term care facility so
 
03:38:08.349 --> 03:38:08.359 align:start position:0%
that's the difference between those two
 
03:38:12.630 --> 03:38:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:16.110 --> 03:38:16.120 align:start position:0%
6633 6636
 
03:38:17.710 --> 03:38:17.720 align:start position:0%
you got five
 
03:38:20.309 --> 03:38:20.319 align:start position:0%
there is it and what's their story are
 
03:38:22.590 --> 03:38:22.600 align:start position:0%
they you have vacancies you have any
 
03:38:25.870 --> 03:38:25.880 align:start position:0%
unfunded positions neither no vacancies
 
03:38:28.990 --> 03:38:29.000 align:start position:0%
no unfunded all right representative
 
03:38:31.750 --> 03:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
yeah very quick very quick question back
 
03:38:37.389 --> 03:38:37.399 align:start position:0%
on uh page 1050 where it shows no no no
 
03:38:40.990 --> 03:38:41.000 align:start position:0%
wrong page 1051 two lines that show
 
03:38:44.950 --> 03:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
agency income what what uh what's the
 
03:38:47.189 --> 03:38:47.199 align:start position:0%
source of of the income there is that
 
03:38:51.790 --> 03:38:51.800 align:start position:0%
recovery on litigation or so the 009
 
03:38:54.189 --> 03:38:54.199 align:start position:0%
line um what that
 
03:38:57.030 --> 03:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
represents this goes back to the budget
 
03:38:58.590 --> 03:38:58.600 align:start position:0%
um the budget system that we were
 
03:39:02.030 --> 03:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
talking about earlier today um in in
 
03:39:04.269 --> 03:39:04.279 align:start position:0%
state fiscal year 24 at the end of the
 
03:39:05.950 --> 03:39:05.960 align:start position:0%
year we brought forward an item to
 
03:39:08.710 --> 03:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal to allocate other funds across
 
03:39:11.790 --> 03:39:11.800 align:start position:0%
the department and that that was um
 
03:39:13.469 --> 03:39:13.479 align:start position:0%
approved and that's why you're seeing
 
03:39:16.389 --> 03:39:16.399 align:start position:0%
the actual expense show up there 25 is
 
03:39:19.790 --> 03:39:19.800 align:start position:0%
zero because this was pre-budget system
 
03:39:21.070 --> 03:39:21.080 align:start position:0%
and the cost that you see in state
 
03:39:23.710 --> 03:39:23.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 26 and 27 those are
 
03:39:25.790 --> 03:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
allocated costs from other funds from
 
03:39:28.110 --> 03:39:28.120 align:start position:0%
other areas of the department to make it
 
03:39:30.070 --> 03:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
clear and and represent the cost that
 
03:39:32.389 --> 03:39:32.399 align:start position:0%
this team incurs and supporting New
 
03:39:33.910 --> 03:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital and Glen Cliff home
 
03:39:36.070 --> 03:39:36.080 align:start position:0%
and the other areas the and that's the
 
03:39:39.189 --> 03:39:39.199 align:start position:0%
009 agency income the
 
03:39:42.309 --> 03:39:42.319 align:start position:0%
007 is the uh some of the estate
 
03:39:46.469 --> 03:39:46.479 align:start position:0%
recovery funds uh that this that um
 
03:39:48.750 --> 03:39:48.760 align:start position:0%
the department is able to recover by the
 
03:39:50.790 --> 03:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program so just as a followup
 
03:39:52.990 --> 03:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
that's a a cost sharing or a cost
 
03:39:54.510 --> 03:39:54.520 align:start position:0%
allocation and stuff that comes from
 
03:39:56.870 --> 03:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
other other departments it's it's other
 
03:39:59.070 --> 03:39:59.080 align:start position:0%
revenue generated by other departments
 
03:40:01.469 --> 03:40:01.479 align:start position:0%
that's being attributed to the revenue
 
03:40:03.469 --> 03:40:03.479 align:start position:0%
here to cover the expenses that are
 
03:40:05.950 --> 03:40:05.960 align:start position:0%
incurred in supporting those
 
03:40:08.590 --> 03:40:08.600 align:start position:0%
areas okay thank you representative
 
03:40:10.590 --> 03:40:10.600 align:start position:0%
Stringham so I'm looking at this you
 
03:40:12.750 --> 03:40:12.760 align:start position:0%
have 1,600 uh cases through the
 
03:40:15.590 --> 03:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
ombudsman's office so there's staff of
 
03:40:18.389 --> 03:40:18.399 align:start position:0%
four so that's basically two new cases
 
03:40:21.870 --> 03:40:21.880 align:start position:0%
per person day is that a reasonable
 
03:40:24.070 --> 03:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
amount for somebody to be able to
 
03:40:27.630 --> 03:40:27.640 align:start position:0%
clear uh given the kind of split of
 
03:40:30.469 --> 03:40:30.479 align:start position:0%
cases that would be part of that 1600
 
03:40:33.790 --> 03:40:33.800 align:start position:0%
cases um I mean obviously they'd always
 
03:40:36.030 --> 03:40:36.040 align:start position:0%
love to have some more staff to handle
 
03:40:38.429 --> 03:40:38.439 align:start position:0%
some of those cases I think that they're
 
03:40:41.070 --> 03:40:41.080 align:start position:0%
really skilled in um being able to
 
03:40:43.469 --> 03:40:43.479 align:start position:0%
connect them to the right people um a
 
03:40:46.630 --> 03:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
lot of times they people call to say
 
03:40:48.349 --> 03:40:48.359 align:start position:0%
that you know I'm not getting I don't
 
03:40:50.349 --> 03:40:50.359 align:start position:0%
know who to contact I'm not sure who you
 
03:40:52.030 --> 03:40:52.040 align:start position:0%
know and and they're really good at
 
03:40:53.830 --> 03:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
ensuring that they they get them
 
03:40:57.150 --> 03:40:57.160 align:start position:0%
connected so I think that um you know
 
03:40:58.750 --> 03:40:58.760 align:start position:0%
that's part of it obviously being part
 
03:41:00.189 --> 03:41:00.199 align:start position:0%
of the department is really helpful for
 
03:41:02.590 --> 03:41:02.600 align:start position:0%
working together um another thing that
 
03:41:04.229 --> 03:41:04.239 align:start position:0%
they were able to do these last couple
 
03:41:07.790 --> 03:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
of years is identify areas in which they
 
03:41:09.750 --> 03:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
um that the department they've seen they
 
03:41:12.269 --> 03:41:12.279 align:start position:0%
may have seen some Trends and they've
 
03:41:14.229 --> 03:41:14.239 align:start position:0%
been able to say well I've we've gotten
 
03:41:16.429 --> 03:41:16.439 align:start position:0%
a lot of calls about this one issue like
 
03:41:18.550 --> 03:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
let's fix this one issue and that's what
 
03:41:20.150 --> 03:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
we've we've really attempted to try to
 
03:41:22.269 --> 03:41:22.279 align:start position:0%
do over the last couple of years so even
 
03:41:24.830 --> 03:41:24.840 align:start position:0%
though um you may see that the case
 
03:41:26.870 --> 03:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
numbers are high and they certainly are
 
03:41:29.189 --> 03:41:29.199 align:start position:0%
handling a lot of cases right now they
 
03:41:30.750 --> 03:41:30.760 align:start position:0%
they are really skilled and doing the
 
03:41:33.630 --> 03:41:33.640 align:start position:0%
work that they're doing and um and so
 
03:41:35.830 --> 03:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
you know we we have had some mandates
 
03:41:38.030 --> 03:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
through legislature or con um
 
03:41:40.389 --> 03:41:40.399 align:start position:0%
conversations at least to try to get
 
03:41:42.630 --> 03:41:42.640 align:start position:0%
individuals in the UDS men's office that
 
03:41:44.590 --> 03:41:44.600 align:start position:0%
are specifically trained to deal with
 
03:41:46.110 --> 03:41:46.120 align:start position:0%
certain different from populations
 
03:41:48.830 --> 03:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
within the state um so we may see some
 
03:41:50.510 --> 03:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
movement there and that would be really
 
03:41:52.149 --> 03:41:52.159 align:start position:0%
helpful for for the for the EMB
 
03:41:53.590 --> 03:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
bussman's office I mean I don't want to
 
03:41:55.590 --> 03:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
say that we have all the people that we
 
03:41:57.030 --> 03:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
need because we definitely could use
 
03:41:59.149 --> 03:41:59.159 align:start position:0%
more but I will say that they do a
 
03:42:01.590 --> 03:42:01.600 align:start position:0%
really good job with what they have well
 
03:42:03.349 --> 03:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
if they specialize and there's only four
 
03:42:04.830 --> 03:42:04.840 align:start position:0%
of them and they have to cover the
 
03:42:07.110 --> 03:42:07.120 align:start position:0%
entire State geographically and it looks
 
03:42:11.149 --> 03:42:11.159 align:start position:0%
like uh pretty high percentage of cases
 
03:42:14.030 --> 03:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
involve the site visit um so the EMB
 
03:42:15.630 --> 03:42:15.640 align:start position:0%
busman's office doesn't is is n required
 
03:42:18.950 --> 03:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
to do any site visits um so they they
 
03:42:20.510 --> 03:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
usually handle most of their stuff I
 
03:42:22.189 --> 03:42:22.199 align:start position:0%
mean certainly they will meet with with
 
03:42:24.710 --> 03:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
clients if necessary but they do a lot
 
03:42:26.429 --> 03:42:26.439 align:start position:0%
of their work
 
03:42:28.870 --> 03:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
remotely I would imagine that there's
 
03:42:32.950 --> 03:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
some uh conceptual Pi chart for this
 
03:42:35.990 --> 03:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
1600 that shows a significant number of
 
03:42:39.870 --> 03:42:39.880 align:start position:0%
them is is represents a referral to the
 
03:42:42.910 --> 03:42:42.920 align:start position:0%
right person to follow up on without
 
03:42:44.910 --> 03:42:44.920 align:start position:0%
spending a great deal of time in the um
 
03:42:44.920 --> 03:42:46.070 align:start position:0%
spending a great deal of time in the um
bu

03:42:46.070 --> 03:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
bu
 
03:42:49.189 --> 03:42:49.199 align:start position:0%
yeah defin definitely um you know and it
 
03:42:50.870 --> 03:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
is just connecting sometimes it's just
 
03:42:52.389 --> 03:42:52.399 align:start position:0%
connecting them to the right people
 
03:42:54.750 --> 03:42:54.760 align:start position:0%
smaller piece of the pie chart would be
 
03:42:56.870 --> 03:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
a serious investigation right them doing
 
03:42:58.990 --> 03:42:59.000 align:start position:0%
a full investigation that is yeah that's
 
03:43:03.349 --> 03:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
a smaller percentage yeah thank you I I
 
03:43:07.790 --> 03:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
have another question the um uh and I
 
03:43:09.670 --> 03:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
want to zoom out a little bit and that
 
03:43:11.670 --> 03:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
is you know what we're looking at here
 
03:43:13.870 --> 03:43:13.880 align:start position:0%
all the expenses are largely personnel
 
03:43:16.670 --> 03:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
and cost driven by Personnel like
 
03:43:20.469 --> 03:43:20.479 align:start position:0%
benefits and so on in these charts if um
 
03:43:22.309 --> 03:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
where would it show up if there are
 
03:43:25.309 --> 03:43:25.319 align:start position:0%
related to these Services you know say
 
03:43:28.149 --> 03:43:28.159 align:start position:0%
you say in this area you you contract
 
03:43:32.510 --> 03:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
with 100 uh pis to do investigation
 
03:43:35.149 --> 03:43:35.159 align:start position:0%
they're contracted they're not
 
03:43:39.070 --> 03:43:39.080 align:start position:0%
um uh uh not I don't think they're part
 
03:43:43.149 --> 03:43:43.159 align:start position:0%
in in here so I I just in zooming out
 
03:43:45.349 --> 03:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking you know what can what can
 
03:43:48.790 --> 03:43:48.800 align:start position:0%
we recommend either from moving contract
 
03:43:51.229 --> 03:43:51.239 align:start position:0%
workout into your department through
 
03:43:54.309 --> 03:43:54.319 align:start position:0%
staff or the other way around and right
 
03:43:57.269 --> 03:43:57.279 align:start position:0%
now I feel like we're seeing the staff
 
03:44:00.750 --> 03:44:00.760 align:start position:0%
part of it and not maybe uh other pieces
 
03:44:02.990 --> 03:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
of critical expenditures that you
 
03:44:05.750 --> 03:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
require to do your function that you you
 
03:44:09.469 --> 03:44:09.479 align:start position:0%
know you may be able to trade off on so
 
03:44:11.550 --> 03:44:11.560 align:start position:0%
maybe that's a question for Nathan it's
 
03:44:13.550 --> 03:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
you know because I think it involves
 
03:44:15.309 --> 03:44:15.319 align:start position:0%
everything we've looked at today not
 
03:44:20.910 --> 03:44:20.920 align:start position:0%
just this so yeah we don't have the the
 
03:44:22.510 --> 03:44:22.520 align:start position:0%
the office of legal and Regulatory
 
03:44:25.710 --> 03:44:25.720 align:start position:0%
Services has very very few contracts um
 
03:44:27.990 --> 03:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
so I think what you're talking about may
 
03:44:30.670 --> 03:44:30.680 align:start position:0%
be related more to other bureaus that do
 
03:44:32.469 --> 03:44:32.479 align:start position:0%
investigations you know we have Adult
 
03:44:33.830 --> 03:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
Protective Services that will
 
03:44:36.550 --> 03:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
investigate individuals for abuse and
 
03:44:39.149 --> 03:44:39.159 align:start position:0%
neglect um for adults uh those
 
03:44:41.510 --> 03:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
individuals are employed as well so we
 
03:44:43.550 --> 03:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
don't really have we have we really
 
03:44:46.269 --> 03:44:46.279 align:start position:0%
don't have very many contracts at all um
 
03:44:48.590 --> 03:44:48.600 align:start position:0%
in our Bureau it is mostly staff and it
 
03:44:50.710 --> 03:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
it is mostly although like the EMB
 
03:44:53.229 --> 03:44:53.239 align:start position:0%
budsman is outward facing our general
 
03:44:54.990 --> 03:44:55.000 align:start position:0%
Council folks which which we actually
 
03:44:57.670 --> 03:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
just have a few of them um are are
 
03:45:00.189 --> 03:45:00.199 align:start position:0%
internal and really support internal
 
03:45:03.110 --> 03:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
programs so um I certainly can think
 
03:45:06.030 --> 03:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
about it and take it back and and um and
 
03:45:07.590 --> 03:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
and talk to folks a little bit more to
 
03:45:08.990 --> 03:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
see if there's anything that we can do
 
03:45:11.269 --> 03:45:11.279 align:start position:0%
to streamline um but we don't have any
 
03:45:13.349 --> 03:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
existing contracts right now as in in
 
03:45:17.389 --> 03:45:17.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:19.870 --> 03:45:19.880 align:start position:0%
I want to ask you my it question what
 
03:45:23.349 --> 03:45:23.359 align:start position:0%
what's what's the core it um support
 
03:45:25.990 --> 03:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
system for utsman do are you using
 
03:45:26.000 --> 03:45:27.630 align:start position:0%
system for utsman do are you using
sales.com

03:45:27.630 --> 03:45:27.640 align:start position:0%
sales.com
 
03:45:31.229 --> 03:45:31.239 align:start position:0%
Okay y representative
 
03:45:34.309 --> 03:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
priest thank you Mr chairman uh back to
 
03:45:40.070 --> 03:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
page uh 13 again on your handout y um
 
03:45:42.229 --> 03:45:42.239 align:start position:0%
again the four staff that you have
 
03:45:45.030 --> 03:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
identified in the budget do they all
 
03:45:49.510 --> 03:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
also do the uh long-term care outb so
 
03:45:50.990 --> 03:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
the there's four staff for the EMB
 
03:45:52.630 --> 03:45:52.640 align:start position:0%
budsman office and then there's another
 
03:45:54.510 --> 03:45:54.520 align:start position:0%
for the long-term care EMB buzzman
 
03:45:56.590 --> 03:45:56.600 align:start position:0%
office and how many staff they have four
 
03:46:00.229 --> 03:46:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:04.149 --> 03:46:04.159 align:start position:0%
okay a few years ago the legislature
 
03:46:07.830 --> 03:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
wanted the department to have
 
03:46:11.149 --> 03:46:11.159 align:start position:0%
specifically a privacy officer and one
 
03:46:13.550 --> 03:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
of the functions of the privacy officer
 
03:46:17.030 --> 03:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
was to do privacy impact assessments has
 
03:46:18.670 --> 03:46:18.680 align:start position:0%
that been implemented do we have that
 
03:46:20.990 --> 03:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
position filled so we do have a privacy
 
03:46:23.950 --> 03:46:23.960 align:start position:0%
well we did that's different we did have
 
03:46:25.710 --> 03:46:25.720 align:start position:0%
a we have a privacy officer a hippoc
 
03:46:27.429 --> 03:46:27.439 align:start position:0%
compliance privacy officer which is
 
03:46:30.469 --> 03:46:30.479 align:start position:0%
required for us to be covered entity but
 
03:46:34.229 --> 03:46:34.239 align:start position:0%
as for the impact sounds like Nathan so
 
03:46:36.750 --> 03:46:36.760 align:start position:0%
so there there I I don't remember um the
 
03:46:39.950 --> 03:46:39.960 align:start position:0%
bill number uh chairman words but that
 
03:46:42.790 --> 03:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
bill was incorporated into hb2 and I
 
03:46:44.950 --> 03:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
believe there were two positions
 
03:46:46.429 --> 03:46:46.439 align:start position:0%
established within the Bureau of
 
03:46:48.790 --> 03:46:48.800 align:start position:0%
Information Services for those privacy
 
03:46:50.590 --> 03:46:50.600 align:start position:0%
impact assessments that you're referring
 
03:46:53.149 --> 03:46:53.159 align:start position:0%
to and and I believe those have been
 
03:46:55.790 --> 03:46:55.800 align:start position:0%
budgeted okay because in my experience
 
03:46:58.070 --> 03:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
the P the Privacy officers tended to
 
03:47:01.389 --> 03:47:01.399 align:start position:0%
hand hang out in the legal area and not
 
03:47:04.710 --> 03:47:04.720 align:start position:0%
and not as much in the it area we we do
 
03:47:06.510 --> 03:47:06.520 align:start position:0%
have I mean being a covered entity a hip
 
03:47:07.630 --> 03:47:07.640 align:start position:0%
a covered entity we have to have a
 
03:47:09.510 --> 03:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
privacy officer so that person does sit
 
03:47:11.670 --> 03:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
within the department for under my
 
03:47:14.429 --> 03:47:14.439 align:start position:0%
purview so they are within legal okay um
 
03:47:16.189 --> 03:47:16.199 align:start position:0%
but it but that's a little bit different
 
03:47:19.110 --> 03:47:19.120 align:start position:0%
than the and I'm I know Dave is sitting
 
03:47:20.429 --> 03:47:20.439 align:start position:0%
in the back he might be able to answer
 
03:47:22.229 --> 03:47:22.239 align:start position:0%
this better so just an editorial note
 
03:47:24.389 --> 03:47:24.399 align:start position:0%
for you to take away and that is that
 
03:47:26.710 --> 03:47:26.720 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons we established a a
 
03:47:29.510 --> 03:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
privacy officer position was because it
 
03:47:31.670 --> 03:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
was in the aftermath of the
 
03:47:34.349 --> 03:47:34.359 align:start position:0%
2018 uh constitutional amendment to
 
03:47:36.349 --> 03:47:36.359 align:start position:0%
protect privacy of New Hampshire
 
03:47:38.670 --> 03:47:38.680 align:start position:0%
citizens and at the time there was a
 
03:47:41.070 --> 03:47:41.080 align:start position:0%
perception that the department wasn't
 
03:47:44.389 --> 03:47:44.399 align:start position:0%
particularly good at having a culture of
 
03:47:47.429 --> 03:47:47.439 align:start position:0%
privacy protection so we wanted to get
 
03:47:50.070 --> 03:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
somebody in there who would educate the
 
03:47:54.309 --> 03:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
leadership on a culture of privacy and
 
03:47:56.670 --> 03:47:56.680 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm still concerned that when you
 
03:47:59.870 --> 03:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
talk to leadership in the department
 
03:48:05.349 --> 03:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
they uh don't respect as a rule um the
 
03:48:08.229 --> 03:48:08.239 align:start position:0%
requirement to have all data collection
 
03:48:11.990 --> 03:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
be done on an opt-in basis and they
 
03:48:15.389 --> 03:48:15.399 align:start position:0%
default to a government opt out approach
 
03:48:17.550 --> 03:48:17.560 align:start position:0%
preferred approach and I think we have
 
03:48:20.389 --> 03:48:20.399 align:start position:0%
to flip that have have you have you
 
03:48:23.790 --> 03:48:23.800 align:start position:0%
looked or have you are you aware of any
 
03:48:26.229 --> 03:48:26.239 align:start position:0%
internal consultation on when we're
 
03:48:29.030 --> 03:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
going to end opt out and move to an
 
03:48:34.710 --> 03:48:34.720 align:start position:0%
optin policy so that that's I think that
 
03:48:37.189 --> 03:48:37.199 align:start position:0%
we we handle a lot of data so your the
 
03:48:39.670 --> 03:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
opt-in versus opt out is different
 
03:48:41.990 --> 03:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
depending on the data but I I'd love to
 
03:48:44.870 --> 03:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
invite Dave weers to I don't know if you
 
03:48:46.510 --> 03:48:46.520 align:start position:0%
want to take the seat over there Dave he
 
03:48:48.070 --> 03:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
can talk a little bit more about that CU
 
03:48:50.229 --> 03:48:50.239 align:start position:0%
he's definitely been involved from an IT
 
03:48:53.790 --> 03:48:53.800 align:start position:0%
perspective okay so so I'm talking
 
03:48:55.710 --> 03:48:55.720 align:start position:0%
specifically about known data
 
03:48:58.110 --> 03:48:58.120 align:start position:0%
collections where we're Gathering
 
03:49:00.910 --> 03:49:00.920 align:start position:0%
personal data and rather than ask the
 
03:49:05.590 --> 03:49:05.600 align:start position:0%
individual to opt in we defer a default
 
03:49:09.110 --> 03:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
to an opt out approach of data
 
03:49:11.229 --> 03:49:11.239 align:start position:0%
collection um thank you for the question
 
03:49:12.870 --> 03:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
again for the record Dave weers Chief
 
03:49:16.710 --> 03:49:16.720 align:start position:0%
Operating Officer so so when it comes to
 
03:49:18.750 --> 03:49:18.760 align:start position:0%
data that we're collecting directly we
 
03:49:21.750 --> 03:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
have changed our our modus operandi of
 
03:49:23.830 --> 03:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
doing opt-in consent-based
 
03:49:25.870 --> 03:49:25.880 align:start position:0%
Gathering however lots of our
 
03:49:28.590 --> 03:49:28.600 align:start position:0%
information that we do receive is not
 
03:49:30.309 --> 03:49:30.319 align:start position:0%
through a program or service that we
 
03:49:32.750 --> 03:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
offer so any state mandated or federally
 
03:49:34.990 --> 03:49:35.000 align:start position:0%
mandated data would not necessarily
 
03:49:37.309 --> 03:49:37.319 align:start position:0%
follow an opt-in process because I'm
 
03:49:39.229 --> 03:49:39.239 align:start position:0%
still seeing surveys that go to
 
03:49:43.229 --> 03:49:43.239 align:start position:0%
individuals that uh default to opt
 
03:49:46.070 --> 03:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
out I'm be interested in hearing about
 
03:49:47.670 --> 03:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
those we I would say that you're
 
03:49:50.269 --> 03:49:50.279 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct there are still um
 
03:49:52.309 --> 03:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
information that is out there that would
 
03:49:55.550 --> 03:49:55.560 align:start position:0%
be an opt out function and but we are
 
03:49:57.389 --> 03:49:57.399 align:start position:0%
going through the department with new
 
03:50:01.070 --> 03:50:01.080 align:start position:0%
systems and new processes to identify a
 
03:50:03.910 --> 03:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
standard consent-based approach um using
 
03:50:06.510 --> 03:50:06.520 align:start position:0%
the DocuSign solution that you heard ear
 
03:50:08.429 --> 03:50:08.439 align:start position:0%
earlier this morning so would you say
 
03:50:10.670 --> 03:50:10.680 align:start position:0%
it's generally the policy of the
 
03:50:13.630 --> 03:50:13.640 align:start position:0%
department to be migrating individual
 
03:50:16.590 --> 03:50:16.600 align:start position:0%
data collection surveys and the like to
 
03:50:20.389 --> 03:50:20.399 align:start position:0%
an optin approach for data collection we
 
03:50:22.870 --> 03:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
have not made a policy for it but it is
 
03:50:22.880 --> 03:50:23.950 align:start position:0%
have not made a policy for it but it is
general

03:50:23.950 --> 03:50:23.960 align:start position:0%
general
 
03:50:26.630 --> 03:50:26.640 align:start position:0%
practice okay so you have a privacy
 
03:50:28.670 --> 03:50:28.680 align:start position:0%
governance board has this not been an
 
03:50:30.910 --> 03:50:30.920 align:start position:0%
issue in the Privacy governance board on
 
03:50:32.469 --> 03:50:32.479 align:start position:0%
what the policy of the department ought
 
03:50:35.630 --> 03:50:35.640 align:start position:0%
to be so that's a a good point we do
 
03:50:37.870 --> 03:50:37.880 align:start position:0%
have a privacy board as you indicated
 
03:50:40.910 --> 03:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
and our David governance committee is
 
03:50:43.149 --> 03:50:43.159 align:start position:0%
currently in draft mode for a data
 
03:50:45.910 --> 03:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
policy for how we collect and manage
 
03:50:48.030 --> 03:50:48.040 align:start position:0%
data including the Privacy impact
 
03:50:50.790 --> 03:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
assessments and the management of optin
 
03:50:53.870 --> 03:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
versus opt out there are numerous
 
03:50:56.309 --> 03:50:56.319 align:start position:0%
programs across the department that may
 
03:50:58.550 --> 03:50:58.560 align:start position:0%
or may not benefit from an optin or opt
 
03:51:01.590 --> 03:51:01.600 align:start position:0%
out so it would be a case-by case basis
 
03:51:03.710 --> 03:51:03.720 align:start position:0%
um and then I don't know if you want an
 
03:51:06.309 --> 03:51:06.319 align:start position:0%
answer to the Privacy impact assessment
 
03:51:08.229 --> 03:51:08.239 align:start position:0%
uh question it doesn't sound like you've
 
03:51:10.910 --> 03:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
implemented it yet but you intend
 
03:51:14.309 --> 03:51:14.319 align:start position:0%
to that is correct we we do intend to um
 
03:51:16.030 --> 03:51:16.040 align:start position:0%
for the Privacy impact assessment
 
03:51:19.590 --> 03:51:19.600 align:start position:0%
specifically we are on track to have a a
 
03:51:21.429 --> 03:51:21.439 align:start position:0%
report that we will use as a standard
 
03:51:23.830 --> 03:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
template using a technology called one
 
03:51:26.550 --> 03:51:26.560 align:start position:0%
trust and that will be in place for
 
03:51:28.950 --> 03:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
March and when do you think you'll have
 
03:51:32.149 --> 03:51:32.159 align:start position:0%
privacy impact assessments routinely for
 
03:51:34.710 --> 03:51:34.720 align:start position:0%
the implementation of new data
 
03:51:38.070 --> 03:51:38.080 align:start position:0%
collection systems um in compliance with
 
03:51:40.510 --> 03:51:40.520 align:start position:0%
the RSA we will have that in place in
 
03:51:42.990 --> 03:51:43.000 align:start position:0%
March of this year March 2025
 
03:51:43.000 --> 03:51:44.790 align:start position:0%
March of this year March 2025
outstanding

03:51:44.790 --> 03:51:44.800 align:start position:0%
outstanding
 
03:51:46.110 --> 03:51:46.120 align:start position:0%
thank you is there anything in the
 
03:51:47.830 --> 03:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
department you don't know because you
 
03:51:51.110 --> 03:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
seem to be a jack of all trades there is
 
03:51:53.590 --> 03:51:53.600 align:start position:0%
a lot in the department I do not know
 
03:51:56.910 --> 03:51:56.920 align:start position:0%
thank you all right so so I'm sorry
 
03:51:58.990 --> 03:51:59.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's a that's a pet rock of
 
03:52:02.590 --> 03:52:02.600 align:start position:0%
mine I I apologize so yeah so the only
 
03:52:04.030 --> 03:52:04.040 align:start position:0%
other thing that I was going to mention
 
03:52:05.790 --> 03:52:05.800 align:start position:0%
is what came up earlier was our estate
 
03:52:08.830 --> 03:52:08.840 align:start position:0%
recoveries unit uh estate recoveries uh
 
03:52:11.189 --> 03:52:11.199 align:start position:0%
recovers funds that were paid by the
 
03:52:13.830 --> 03:52:13.840 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire um and by the
 
03:52:16.670 --> 03:52:16.680 align:start position:0%
federal government for
 
03:52:19.429 --> 03:52:19.439 align:start position:0%
services through our Medicaid um folks
 
03:52:22.429 --> 03:52:22.439 align:start position:0%
so or our Medicaid members so if a
 
03:52:25.590 --> 03:52:25.600 align:start position:0%
individual was uh able to say keep their
 
03:52:29.710 --> 03:52:29.720 align:start position:0%
home and um they they were only able to
 
03:52:31.469 --> 03:52:31.479 align:start position:0%
keep their home and live in it but they
 
03:52:33.590 --> 03:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
needed Medicaid they needed a place to
 
03:52:35.070 --> 03:52:35.080 align:start position:0%
live and they needed Medicaid to cover
 
03:52:37.349 --> 03:52:37.359 align:start position:0%
their services we would allow them we
 
03:52:39.910 --> 03:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
allow them to keep their home and um and
 
03:52:41.469 --> 03:52:41.479 align:start position:0%
obviously still be covered under
 
03:52:43.870 --> 03:52:43.880 align:start position:0%
Medicaid but to keep their home they
 
03:52:46.149 --> 03:52:46.159 align:start position:0%
have to then um usually get a lean on
 
03:52:48.910 --> 03:52:48.920 align:start position:0%
their on their house for the portions of
 
03:52:50.590 --> 03:52:50.600 align:start position:0%
funds that have been expended by the
 
03:52:53.229 --> 03:52:53.239 align:start position:0%
state so our estate recoveries recovers
 
03:52:56.670 --> 03:52:56.680 align:start position:0%
those um those funds after uh through
 
03:52:56.680 --> 03:52:57.510 align:start position:0%
those um those funds after uh through
Court

03:52:57.510 --> 03:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
Court
 
03:53:00.469 --> 03:53:00.479 align:start position:0%
proceedings and right now we earn about
 
03:53:03.990 --> 03:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
$7 million for it's not just for the
 
03:53:05.349 --> 03:53:05.359 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire that's split up
 
03:53:07.590 --> 03:53:07.600 align:start position:0%
between Federal funding County funding
 
03:53:11.710 --> 03:53:11.720 align:start position:0%
and state funding um if we were to have
 
03:53:13.429 --> 03:53:13.439 align:start position:0%
additional staff we believe that we
 
03:53:15.229 --> 03:53:15.239 align:start position:0%
could increase that by $2
 
03:53:18.710 --> 03:53:18.720 align:start position:0%
million um generally so that's uh we do
 
03:53:20.070 --> 03:53:20.080 align:start position:0%
have money that's kind of left on the
 
03:53:21.229 --> 03:53:21.239 align:start position:0%
table right now because we just don't
 
03:53:23.790 --> 03:53:23.800 align:start position:0%
have the staff to be able to handle all
 
03:53:25.630 --> 03:53:25.640 align:start position:0%
of the potential estate recoveries that
 
03:53:27.429 --> 03:53:27.439 align:start position:0%
are out there what what what do you
 
03:53:29.429 --> 03:53:29.439 align:start position:0%
think the estimated Personnel cost would
 
03:53:31.990 --> 03:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
be in order to chase that 2 million
 
03:53:34.349 --> 03:53:34.359 align:start position:0%
effectively we would need one one
 
03:53:37.389 --> 03:53:37.399 align:start position:0%
attorney and two support staff so about
 
03:53:40.550 --> 03:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
600,000 Personnel or less
 
03:53:44.110 --> 03:53:44.120 align:start position:0%
so so just a couple of clarifying points
 
03:53:46.429 --> 03:53:46.439 align:start position:0%
um the the general funds for State
 
03:53:48.189 --> 03:53:48.199 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 26 that would' be needed
 
03:53:50.510 --> 03:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
would be about 163,000 there' be
 
03:53:52.790 --> 03:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
matching federal dollars available so
 
03:53:54.750 --> 03:53:54.760 align:start position:0%
the total Personnel appropriation for
 
03:53:58.309 --> 03:53:58.319 align:start position:0%
year one would be 258,000 however I
 
03:53:59.630 --> 03:53:59.640 align:start position:0%
don't think you would need to budget
 
03:54:01.630 --> 03:54:01.640 align:start position:0%
that much because we would need time to
 
03:54:03.670 --> 03:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
create the positions and eventually hire
 
03:54:05.870 --> 03:54:05.880 align:start position:0%
hire the individuals so probably about
 
03:54:09.030 --> 03:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
half that it's about 270,000 total funds
 
03:54:11.309 --> 03:54:11.319 align:start position:0%
in the second year and while we'd be
 
03:54:14.870 --> 03:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
able to recover about $2 million uh 50%
 
03:54:17.030 --> 03:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
of that would go back to the feds um we
 
03:54:18.070 --> 03:54:18.080 align:start position:0%
would see about
 
03:54:20.349 --> 03:54:20.359 align:start position:0%
$300,000 estimated go back to the
 
03:54:22.870 --> 03:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
counties and then approximately
 
03:54:25.830 --> 03:54:25.840 align:start position:0%
$700,000 would come to the state so if
 
03:54:28.750 --> 03:54:28.760 align:start position:0%
those positions were funded by the state
 
03:54:32.189 --> 03:54:32.199 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 27 the you know the the net
 
03:54:35.309 --> 03:54:35.319 align:start position:0%
benefit would be in the range of $400 to
 
03:54:37.870 --> 03:54:37.880 align:start position:0%
$500,000 again this is an estimate but
 
03:54:40.550 --> 03:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
it would require about 3 FTE and it
 
03:54:42.790 --> 03:54:42.800 align:start position:0%
could be more it could be less okay
 
03:54:44.750 --> 03:54:44.760 align:start position:0%
that's great did did you just discuss
 
03:54:47.030 --> 03:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
this in the agency phase with the
 
03:54:49.510 --> 03:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
governor's office yes we did and and
 
03:54:52.389 --> 03:54:52.399 align:start position:0%
what did what's was the conclusion it's
 
03:54:54.550 --> 03:54:54.560 align:start position:0%
not anywhere in the budget is it a
 
03:54:57.790 --> 03:54:57.800 align:start position:0%
prioritized need or is it nowhere uh
 
03:54:59.269 --> 03:54:59.279 align:start position:0%
during during the agency phase and the
 
03:55:02.269 --> 03:55:02.279 align:start position:0%
governor's phase we did not uh increase
 
03:55:04.030 --> 03:55:04.040 align:start position:0%
um generally speaking the number of
 
03:55:06.870 --> 03:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
positions across our our department and
 
03:55:09.510 --> 03:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
so um I I think they're is concern
 
03:55:11.070 --> 03:55:11.080 align:start position:0%
around increasing your number of
 
03:55:12.750 --> 03:55:12.760 align:start position:0%
full-time authorized position despite
 
03:55:14.870 --> 03:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
the revenue benefit
 
03:55:17.229 --> 03:55:17.239 align:start position:0%
okay so so this is what I'd be open to
 
03:55:20.670 --> 03:55:20.680 align:start position:0%
doing if if there were a small little
 
03:55:24.030 --> 03:55:24.040 align:start position:0%
onepage business case that would explain
 
03:55:27.670 --> 03:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
you know the the the Manpower side of it
 
03:55:31.189 --> 03:55:31.199 align:start position:0%
the the expected costs the expected I'm
 
03:55:32.910 --> 03:55:32.920 align:start position:0%
going to call it return on investment
 
03:55:34.870 --> 03:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
even though we're government but I
 
03:55:37.469 --> 03:55:37.479 align:start position:0%
that's the that's the business thought
 
03:55:40.630 --> 03:55:40.640 align:start position:0%
so if you if you worked on something
 
03:55:43.189 --> 03:55:43.199 align:start position:0%
like that and got it with Kevin I'd love
 
03:55:45.229 --> 03:55:45.239 align:start position:0%
to uh consider that as part of what
 
03:55:47.229 --> 03:55:47.239 align:start position:0%
we're doing then over the next month
 
03:55:49.030 --> 03:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
sure well do
 
03:55:52.870 --> 03:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
okay um uh are there do you have more
 
03:55:55.189 --> 03:55:55.199 align:start position:0%
for us I don't I think that's are there
 
03:55:58.469 --> 03:55:58.479 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
03:56:01.189 --> 03:56:01.199 align:start position:0%
committee yes representative
 
03:56:04.870 --> 03:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
priest yes thank you very much uh and
 
03:56:07.710 --> 03:56:07.720 align:start position:0%
again going with the
 
03:56:10.910 --> 03:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
questions that uh representative Edwards
 
03:56:14.750 --> 03:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
has mentioned um this could be an
 
03:56:18.630 --> 03:56:18.640 align:start position:0%
expanding area given the Aging of New
 
03:56:20.670 --> 03:56:20.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the fact that we don't
 
03:56:25.149 --> 03:56:25.159 align:start position:0%
have any long affordable long-term day
 
03:56:28.550 --> 03:56:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh care facilities for those people and
 
03:56:30.830 --> 03:56:30.840 align:start position:0%
they will have to care within their
 
03:56:30.840 --> 03:56:32.189 align:start position:0%
they will have to care within their
houses

03:56:32.189 --> 03:56:32.199 align:start position:0%
houses
 
03:56:35.229 --> 03:56:35.239 align:start position:0%
so um just an observation you're
 
03:56:38.149 --> 03:56:38.159 align:start position:0%
referring to the Ombudsman area no I'm
 
03:56:40.389 --> 03:56:40.399 align:start position:0%
talking about the attorneys that will go
 
03:56:45.229 --> 03:56:45.239 align:start position:0%
after um the leans on the private
 
03:56:49.389 --> 03:56:49.399 align:start position:0%
residences to recover the cost of
 
03:56:52.389 --> 03:56:52.399 align:start position:0%
Medicare of to the state and federal
 
03:56:55.309 --> 03:56:55.319 align:start position:0%
government that's amazing okay thank
 
03:56:59.149 --> 03:56:59.159 align:start position:0%
you so so to flip that into another type
 
03:57:02.189 --> 03:57:02.199 align:start position:0%
of question has the department done any
 
03:57:05.269 --> 03:57:05.279 align:start position:0%
long-term trends analysis to figure out
 
03:57:07.389 --> 03:57:07.399 align:start position:0%
what the increasing workload might be
 
03:57:09.670 --> 03:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
from an aging population and the need to
 
03:57:09.680 --> 03:57:10.550 align:start position:0%
from an aging population and the need to
do

03:57:10.550 --> 03:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
do
 
03:57:13.389 --> 03:57:13.399 align:start position:0%
more no we haven't done we haven't
 
03:57:16.389 --> 03:57:16.399 align:start position:0%
estimated to the to the upcoming kind of
 
03:57:19.990 --> 03:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
what we expect you know we have right we
 
03:57:22.149 --> 03:57:22.159 align:start position:0%
have we have obviously all of the
 
03:57:23.910 --> 03:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
trending that you know we have all the
 
03:57:26.349 --> 03:57:26.359 align:start position:0%
data from the previous years but nothing
 
03:57:27.910 --> 03:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
around the future thank you
 
03:57:30.349 --> 03:57:30.359 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham I I wanted to
 
03:57:33.429 --> 03:57:33.439 align:start position:0%
um uh ask ask you to expand a little bit
 
03:57:36.469 --> 03:57:36.479 align:start position:0%
on and on your statements on wages and
 
03:57:38.910 --> 03:57:38.920 align:start position:0%
key challenges the office is struggling
 
03:57:41.110 --> 03:57:41.120 align:start position:0%
to recruit and maintain staff due to low
 
03:57:44.750 --> 03:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
wages in a competitive environment uh
 
03:57:46.790 --> 03:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
positions remain vacant for long periods
 
03:57:48.590 --> 03:57:48.600 align:start position:0%
of time leading to burnout of current
 
03:57:51.389 --> 03:57:51.399 align:start position:0%
staff and higher turnover is there
 
03:57:53.670 --> 03:57:53.680 align:start position:0%
anything in this budget that addresses
 
03:57:56.670 --> 03:57:56.680 align:start position:0%
those uh those concerns or is there
 
03:57:59.630 --> 03:57:59.640 align:start position:0%
significant uh pay increases for example
 
03:58:01.469 --> 03:58:01.479 align:start position:0%
for the could you help us understand
 
03:58:02.990 --> 03:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
what page you're reading from that's a
 
03:58:05.269 --> 03:58:05.279 align:start position:0%
Fage 16 page
 
03:58:08.790 --> 03:58:08.800 align:start position:0%
16 of the handout the key challenges
 
03:58:10.710 --> 03:58:10.720 align:start position:0%
this is a very very good section all
 
03:58:14.309 --> 03:58:14.319 align:start position:0%
three all three bullet items in here um
 
03:58:17.830 --> 03:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
in terms of um pointing an arrow for us
 
03:58:21.429 --> 03:58:21.439 align:start position:0%
to potentially what to think about so
 
03:58:23.389 --> 03:58:23.399 align:start position:0%
yeah anyway do you do you understand the
 
03:58:25.870 --> 03:58:25.880 align:start position:0%
question I I do I I would say that we
 
03:58:27.950 --> 03:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
don't I mean our budget
 
03:58:30.670 --> 03:58:30.680 align:start position:0%
estimates you know what what we
 
03:58:33.309 --> 03:58:33.319 align:start position:0%
currently spend with potential you know
 
03:58:35.030 --> 03:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
Merit increases and those type of things
 
03:58:37.630 --> 03:58:37.640 align:start position:0%
but there's no adjustment um to the
 
03:58:40.389 --> 03:58:40.399 align:start position:0%
actual wages and and the wage scales
 
03:58:42.389 --> 03:58:42.399 align:start position:0%
that are that apply to the positions I
 
03:58:44.630 --> 03:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
think our biggest challenges
 
03:58:46.590 --> 03:58:46.600 align:start position:0%
certainly our dcyf and child support
 
03:58:49.870 --> 03:58:49.880 align:start position:0%
attorneys they have they are not
 
03:58:51.790 --> 03:58:51.800 align:start position:0%
compensated in the way that they would
 
03:58:55.389 --> 03:58:55.399 align:start position:0%
need to be to to they they hold High
 
03:58:58.030 --> 03:58:58.040 align:start position:0%
case loads they have um very sensitive
 
03:58:59.870 --> 03:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
information they have to be a lot of
 
03:59:01.510 --> 03:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
times at court running around and doing
 
03:59:04.189 --> 03:59:04.199 align:start position:0%
a lot of really great work those two
 
03:59:07.070 --> 03:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
areas we struggle with recruitment um we
 
03:59:08.510 --> 03:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
struggle with Recruitment and Retention
 
03:59:11.269 --> 03:59:11.279 align:start position:0%
of those areas because they're very high
 
03:59:14.790 --> 03:59:14.800 align:start position:0%
need high impact work um and it's it's
 
03:59:16.429 --> 03:59:16.439 align:start position:0%
difficult to kind of maintain that level
 
03:59:18.710 --> 03:59:18.720 align:start position:0%
and not have the financial compensation
 
03:59:20.710 --> 03:59:20.720 align:start position:0%
I think the other area is in our Bureau
 
03:59:23.070 --> 03:59:23.080 align:start position:0%
of Licensing and certification um
 
03:59:24.830 --> 03:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
they're all especially our health
 
03:59:26.750 --> 03:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
facilities they're all clinicians you
 
03:59:29.189 --> 03:59:29.199 align:start position:0%
know so getting actual experienced
 
03:59:31.110 --> 03:59:31.120 align:start position:0%
clinicians to be able to inspect our
 
03:59:33.429 --> 03:59:33.439 align:start position:0%
health facilities for compliance health
 
03:59:35.590 --> 03:59:35.600 align:start position:0%
and safety you know they have to have a
 
03:59:37.910 --> 03:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
lot of experience to be able to to
 
03:59:40.830 --> 03:59:40.840 align:start position:0%
identify concerns and issues so so we
 
03:59:43.510 --> 03:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
definitely are seeing um those areas as
 
03:59:46.309 --> 03:59:46.319 align:start position:0%
well strugg with the recruitment um
 
03:59:48.149 --> 03:59:48.159 align:start position:0%
because they because we do need those
 
03:59:50.469 --> 03:59:50.479 align:start position:0%
who have significant experience to be
 
03:59:52.950 --> 03:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
able to ensure that others are providing
 
03:59:55.990 --> 03:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
the services that they should provide so
 
03:59:59.550 --> 03:59:59.560 align:start position:0%
uh you know reading this you know my U
 
04:00:01.349 --> 04:00:01.359 align:start position:0%
interpretation or reading between the
 
04:00:04.189 --> 04:00:04.199 align:start position:0%
lines is if you don't make adjustment in
 
04:00:06.950 --> 04:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
in salaries in these areas you can
 
04:00:11.070 --> 04:00:11.080 align:start position:0%
expect larger vacancies and uh di uh
 
04:00:13.469 --> 04:00:13.479 align:start position:0%
diminished quality of services that's
 
04:00:15.670 --> 04:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
being provided under this function yeah
 
04:00:17.590 --> 04:00:17.600 align:start position:0%
I would say that the individuals that
 
04:00:19.990 --> 04:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
that come to the department are very
 
04:00:22.030 --> 04:00:22.040 align:start position:0%
dedicated and the quality that they want
 
04:00:24.229 --> 04:00:24.239 align:start position:0%
to turn out is always of the highest
 
04:00:26.389 --> 04:00:26.399 align:start position:0%
quality they are very I mean there's a
 
04:00:27.750 --> 04:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
there's a mission within the work that
 
04:00:29.710 --> 04:00:29.720 align:start position:0%
they're doing um you know that caring
 
04:00:31.510 --> 04:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
for children and ensuring that people
 
04:00:33.790 --> 04:00:33.800 align:start position:0%
are getting the services that they need
 
04:00:35.830 --> 04:00:35.840 align:start position:0%
in in our health care facilities um
 
04:00:37.630 --> 04:00:37.640 align:start position:0%
Child Care Facilities is really it's
 
04:00:39.469 --> 04:00:39.479 align:start position:0%
really impressive the work that they do
 
04:00:42.189 --> 04:00:42.199 align:start position:0%
so I would say that the quality for the
 
04:00:44.229 --> 04:00:44.239 align:start position:0%
work that's being done will continue
 
04:00:45.550 --> 04:00:45.560 align:start position:0%
because of the dedication of those
 
04:00:47.830 --> 04:00:47.840 align:start position:0%
individuals I will say that we will
 
04:00:51.349 --> 04:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
continue to have burnout and um and
 
04:00:52.950 --> 04:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
difficulty in recruiting individuals
 
04:00:57.750 --> 04:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
because of the the high needs and and um
 
04:00:59.670 --> 04:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
expectations of those positions is there
 
04:01:01.670 --> 04:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
a distinction between the classified and
 
04:01:04.389 --> 04:01:04.399 align:start position:0%
unclassified positions are you talking
 
04:01:07.070 --> 04:01:07.080 align:start position:0%
about the new the DCF ones I'm I'm
 
04:01:09.110 --> 04:01:09.120 align:start position:0%
saying the the problem that we're
 
04:01:11.670 --> 04:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
discussing is there a distinction in the
 
04:01:13.630 --> 04:01:13.640 align:start position:0%
problem based on whether we're talking
 
04:01:15.510 --> 04:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
class classified employees or
 
04:01:17.990 --> 04:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
unclassified are these you're saying
 
04:01:21.229 --> 04:01:21.239 align:start position:0%
wages typ typically that's a that's for
 
04:01:24.070 --> 04:01:24.080 align:start position:0%
classified positions it would be salary
 
04:01:27.950 --> 04:01:27.960 align:start position:0%
if we were talking about the the um the
 
04:01:30.229 --> 04:01:30.239 align:start position:0%
unclassified yeah so a majority of the
 
04:01:34.070 --> 04:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
staff that I have are classified staff
 
04:01:36.469 --> 04:01:36.479 align:start position:0%
um even our attorneys the child's SP
 
04:01:38.590 --> 04:01:38.600 align:start position:0%
attorneys for the longest time the DCF
 
04:01:41.229 --> 04:01:41.239 align:start position:0%
attorneys were also classified it was
 
04:01:43.469 --> 04:01:43.479 align:start position:0%
the just the most recent change where
 
04:01:46.429 --> 04:01:46.439 align:start position:0%
they're going to unclassified um and and
 
04:01:47.990 --> 04:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
and because we're just transitioning
 
04:01:49.870 --> 04:01:49.880 align:start position:0%
them now it's hard to say what impact
 
04:01:52.870 --> 04:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
that's going to have um on on those
 
04:01:54.389 --> 04:01:54.399 align:start position:0%
those positions specifically but the
 
04:01:57.110 --> 04:01:57.120 align:start position:0%
majority of them are classified thank
 
04:02:00.710 --> 04:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
you uh representative Daniels thank you
 
04:02:02.510 --> 04:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
with the worker shortage that we have in
 
04:02:04.910 --> 04:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
the state do you see any areas in the
 
04:02:08.469 --> 04:02:08.479 align:start position:0%
child care licensing that might be uh
 
04:02:11.389 --> 04:02:11.399 align:start position:0%
relaxed or deregulated in maintaining
 
04:02:14.510 --> 04:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
the safety
 
04:02:19.110 --> 04:02:19.120 align:start position:0%
um are you asking if our staff if or the
 
04:02:21.670 --> 04:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
staff that that operate at the child
 
04:02:23.870 --> 04:02:23.880 align:start position:0%
care facility the CH
 
04:02:26.710 --> 04:02:26.720 align:start position:0%
the the facilities that operate as child
 
04:02:28.990 --> 04:02:29.000 align:start position:0%
care facilities I'm I'm wondering if
 
04:02:32.070 --> 04:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
there are areas that uh may be over
 
04:02:34.309 --> 04:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
regulated are there areas that can be
 
04:02:38.189 --> 04:02:38.199 align:start position:0%
relaxed to allow uh a little more
 
04:02:40.590 --> 04:02:40.600 align:start position:0%
flexibility W within child care so that
 
04:02:42.830 --> 04:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
we can expand the child care and help
 
04:02:44.349 --> 04:02:44.359 align:start position:0%
out the worker shortage
 
04:02:47.469 --> 04:02:47.479 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely so what we did um in for
 
04:02:49.510 --> 04:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
our regulations for childcare licensing
 
04:02:51.950 --> 04:02:51.960 align:start position:0%
is we did a campaign over the last year
 
04:02:55.590 --> 04:02:55.600 align:start position:0%
to work with um a work group of child
 
04:02:59.349 --> 04:02:59.359 align:start position:0%
care providers and uh address those any
 
04:03:01.189 --> 04:03:01.199 align:start position:0%
kind of regulatory barriers or issues
 
04:03:03.950 --> 04:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
that they may see and we actually began
 
04:03:06.389 --> 04:03:06.399 align:start position:0%
to draft and write and make adjustments
 
04:03:08.469 --> 04:03:08.479 align:start position:0%
to our regulations to address exactly
 
04:03:10.750 --> 04:03:10.760 align:start position:0%
what you're talking about so th those
 
04:03:12.309 --> 04:03:12.319 align:start position:0%
are we're in constant contact and
 
04:03:14.830 --> 04:03:14.840 align:start position:0%
communication and we're in that that we
 
04:03:17.550 --> 04:03:17.560 align:start position:0%
are um you know considering the
 
04:03:19.590 --> 04:03:19.600 align:start position:0%
workforce shortage when when we're
 
04:03:21.750 --> 04:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
drafting regulations we do have the
 
04:03:24.030 --> 04:03:24.040 align:start position:0%
ability to have waivers and other things
 
04:03:25.910 --> 04:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
but we have worked very closely with
 
04:03:27.349 --> 04:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
them to make sure that there aren't
 
04:03:30.830 --> 04:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
regulations that exist that are overly
 
04:03:34.550 --> 04:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
burdensome any other questions um you
 
04:03:36.910 --> 04:03:36.920 align:start position:0%
got a summary statement for us or or do
 
04:03:38.229 --> 04:03:38.239 align:start position:0%
you think he covered everything I think
 
04:03:40.469 --> 04:03:40.479 align:start position:0%
I covered everything all right well
 
04:03:42.790 --> 04:03:42.800 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much thank you
 
04:03:45.070 --> 04:03:45.080 align:start position:0%
I think we've got Bureau of Information
 
04:03:49.750 --> 04:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
Systems up next so so we spent an an
 
04:03:54.830 --> 04:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
hour on legal which was a great hour
 
04:03:58.710 --> 04:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
um how much time if now some of the
 
04:04:00.710 --> 04:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Information Systems this is
 
04:04:02.710 --> 04:04:02.720 align:start position:0%
stuff that we picked up before the
 
04:04:05.229 --> 04:04:05.239 align:start position:0%
budget got released so I'd really like
 
04:04:07.510 --> 04:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
to have us focus more on the on the
 
04:04:10.429 --> 04:04:10.439 align:start position:0%
resources needed and and and how that
 
04:04:12.790 --> 04:04:12.800 align:start position:0%
money will be put to work man money and
 
04:04:12.800 --> 04:04:14.269 align:start position:0%
money will be put to work man money and
Manpower

04:04:14.269 --> 04:04:14.279 align:start position:0%
Manpower
 
04:04:16.830 --> 04:04:16.840 align:start position:0%

04:05:34.429 --> 04:05:34.439 align:start position:0%
are so taking the um the clues
 
04:05:36.189 --> 04:05:36.199 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards I'll move quickly
 
04:05:37.389 --> 04:05:37.399 align:start position:0%
through these slides I know that a lot
 
04:05:39.030 --> 04:05:39.040 align:start position:0%
of work was done by David in the pre
 
04:05:41.229 --> 04:05:41.239 align:start position:0%
sessions coming here yeah but it doesn't
 
04:05:43.349 --> 04:05:43.359 align:start position:0%
mean that don't slow me down and we can
 
04:05:44.870 --> 04:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
back up and cover things in a little
 
04:05:44.880 --> 04:05:46.389 align:start position:0%
back up and cover things in a little
more

04:05:46.389 --> 04:05:46.399 align:start position:0%
more
 
04:05:49.990 --> 04:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
detail um if we look at slide two we
 
04:05:52.189 --> 04:05:52.199 align:start position:0%
have a mission statement there that
 
04:05:55.790 --> 04:05:55.800 align:start position:0%
we've we've been exposed to more of the
 
04:05:58.510 --> 04:05:58.520 align:start position:0%
the emphasis that I like to spend some
 
04:06:02.469 --> 04:06:02.479 align:start position:0%
time on is um the functional areas of
 
04:06:02.479 --> 04:06:04.030 align:start position:0%
time on is um the functional areas of
Information

04:06:04.030 --> 04:06:04.040 align:start position:0%
Information
 
04:06:07.070 --> 04:06:07.080 align:start position:0%
Services can may I suggest an update to
 
04:06:10.189 --> 04:06:10.199 align:start position:0%
your mission at a future State I I I'd
 
04:06:12.510 --> 04:06:12.520 align:start position:0%
really love to see you guys include in
 
04:06:15.910 --> 04:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
your mission to uh to drive productivity
 
04:06:19.790 --> 04:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:22.750 --> 04:06:22.760 align:start position:0%
that I mean you're empowering employees
 
04:06:25.469 --> 04:06:25.479 align:start position:0%
and citizens but I I we need more
 
04:06:28.070 --> 04:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
productivity yep and I believe I believe
 
04:06:31.309 --> 04:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
as a as a team that we do drive drive
 
04:06:33.389 --> 04:06:33.399 align:start position:0%
that so that would be welcome
 
04:06:35.110 --> 04:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
information to be able to incorporate
 
04:06:35.120 --> 04:06:36.990 align:start position:0%
information to be able to incorporate
thank

04:06:36.990 --> 04:06:37.000 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:06:39.710 --> 04:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
you so our four four function areas main
 
04:06:42.229 --> 04:06:42.239 align:start position:0%
function areas of Information Services
 
04:06:44.189 --> 04:06:44.199 align:start position:0%
uh strategic planning
 
04:06:47.429 --> 04:06:47.439 align:start position:0%
really that's that's listening and
 
04:06:48.750 --> 04:06:48.760 align:start position:0%
evaluating and finding those
 
04:06:51.269 --> 04:06:51.279 align:start position:0%
opportunities to improve the needs of
 
04:06:53.910 --> 04:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
the the businesses across across the
 
04:06:55.469 --> 04:06:55.479 align:start position:0%
department and I think that's that's an
 
04:06:57.950 --> 04:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
important segue into this every everyone
 
04:07:00.630 --> 04:07:00.640 align:start position:0%
that's presented today is really a
 
04:07:03.309 --> 04:07:03.319 align:start position:0%
department-wide influence as opposed to
 
04:07:05.670 --> 04:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
a single line of business so when we
 
04:07:08.349 --> 04:07:08.359 align:start position:0%
look at the amount of people
 
04:07:11.510 --> 04:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
that comprise Information Services to
 
04:07:14.189 --> 04:07:14.199 align:start position:0%
include our project management office
 
04:07:16.510 --> 04:07:16.520 align:start position:0%
um it's important to to realize that as
 
04:07:20.189 --> 04:07:20.199 align:start position:0%
well the our our ability to be able to
 
04:07:22.510 --> 04:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
take that time listen to the the
 
04:07:23.950 --> 04:07:23.960 align:start position:0%
customers and then find the best
 
04:07:26.710 --> 04:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
opportunities for those to fit into and
 
04:07:29.429 --> 04:07:29.439 align:start position:0%
have the resolutions that we have uh
 
04:07:31.710 --> 04:07:31.720 align:start position:0%
funding and ability for lies in that
 
04:07:34.309 --> 04:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
strategic planning
 
04:07:36.510 --> 04:07:36.520 align:start position:0%
area uh one of the
 
04:07:38.790 --> 04:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
biggest attributes we're trying to do is
 
04:07:41.349 --> 04:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
reduce that duplication by looking at
 
04:07:43.630 --> 04:07:43.640 align:start position:0%
all of the different lines of businesses
 
04:07:47.429 --> 04:07:47.439 align:start position:0%
across the 130 it systems that we have
 
04:07:49.870 --> 04:07:49.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility to and
 
04:07:53.070 --> 04:07:53.080 align:start position:0%
see how we can reduce duplication
 
04:07:55.070 --> 04:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
streamline and have the most efficient
 
04:07:57.830 --> 04:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
outcome for the entire
 
04:08:00.590 --> 04:08:00.600 align:start position:0%
department artificial intelligence is a
 
04:08:02.269 --> 04:08:02.279 align:start position:0%
something that we've been spending a lot
 
04:08:02.279 --> 04:08:02.990 align:start position:0%
something that we've been spending a lot
of

04:08:02.990 --> 04:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:08:06.830 --> 04:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
time trying to wrap our heads around so
 
04:08:09.389 --> 04:08:09.399 align:start position:0%
that we can go about this correctly and
 
04:08:10.710 --> 04:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
implement the things that have the
 
04:08:10.720 --> 04:08:11.670 align:start position:0%
implement the things that have the
greatest

04:08:11.670 --> 04:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
greatest
 
04:08:14.510 --> 04:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
benefit um with a mentation of just
 
04:08:17.670 --> 04:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
trying to broadly go after artificial
 
04:08:19.469 --> 04:08:19.479 align:start position:0%
intelligence so right now we're spending
 
04:08:22.550 --> 04:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of time in policy development and
 
04:08:24.790 --> 04:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
researching how the department can best
 
04:08:28.030 --> 04:08:28.040 align:start position:0%
benefit from it based on funding we'll
 
04:08:32.070 --> 04:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
have the eight key platforms that the
 
04:08:35.349 --> 04:08:35.359 align:start position:0%
department utilizes uh are listed here
 
04:08:37.469 --> 04:08:37.479 align:start position:0%
with the exception of uh the Nexus
 
04:08:40.830 --> 04:08:40.840 align:start position:0%
system that was a math eror on my part
 
04:08:42.950 --> 04:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
we we uh the next system should be added
 
04:08:44.389 --> 04:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
for the bureau of child support and
 
04:08:45.830 --> 04:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
services as
 
04:08:48.710 --> 04:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
well portfolio management the department
 
04:08:50.910 --> 04:08:50.920 align:start position:0%
handles many different projects
 
04:08:53.830 --> 04:08:53.840 align:start position:0%
technical projects usually end up being
 
04:08:56.670 --> 04:08:56.680 align:start position:0%
a hybrid solution from a methodology
 
04:09:00.590 --> 04:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
standpoint utilizing agile and than U
 
04:09:02.550 --> 04:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
some of the waterfall principles and in
 
04:09:05.550 --> 04:09:05.560 align:start position:0%
other cases with limited technology in
 
04:09:06.830 --> 04:09:06.840 align:start position:0%
there they're going to be stronger on
 
04:09:10.030 --> 04:09:10.040 align:start position:0%
waterfall so our portfolio management
 
04:09:11.910 --> 04:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
really is organized for our project
 
04:09:13.750 --> 04:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
management office acting as as a center
 
04:09:15.750 --> 04:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
of excellence in putting the right
 
04:09:16.950 --> 04:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
people in place to make those
 
04:09:19.109 --> 04:09:19.119 align:start position:0%
determinations of of how to execute
 
04:09:22.510 --> 04:09:22.520 align:start position:0%
those projects so jumping ahead how many
 
04:09:26.189 --> 04:09:26.199 align:start position:0%
of those are employees versus
 
04:09:28.630 --> 04:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
contract your project
 
04:09:32.149 --> 04:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
managers uh we probably one of the
 
04:09:34.670 --> 04:09:34.680 align:start position:0%
efforts that is a good accomplishment of
 
04:09:37.510 --> 04:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
the project management office that it
 
04:09:40.630 --> 04:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
acting as a center of excellence having
 
04:09:42.710 --> 04:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
six positions that are actually project
 
04:09:42.720 --> 04:09:44.309 align:start position:0%
six positions that are actually project
manager

04:09:44.309 --> 04:09:44.319 align:start position:0%
manager
 
04:09:46.349 --> 04:09:46.359 align:start position:0%
but have gone through and created the
 
04:09:51.149 --> 04:09:51.159 align:start position:0%
training to stand up over 280 business
 
04:09:55.590 --> 04:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
project managers in each of the business
 
04:09:59.790 --> 04:09:59.800 align:start position:0%
lines so we've we've gone that route
 
04:09:59.800 --> 04:10:00.830 align:start position:0%
lines so we've we've gone that route
excellent

04:10:00.830 --> 04:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
excellent
 
04:10:04.630 --> 04:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
question Asset Management um that's
 
04:10:06.870 --> 04:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
handled within is as well that gives us
 
04:10:08.830 --> 04:10:08.840 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to really manage life
 
04:10:10.309 --> 04:10:10.319 align:start position:0%
cycle management keeping Pro
 
04:10:12.870 --> 04:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
productivity up and having the proper
 
04:10:14.950 --> 04:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
visibility to what's happening with our
 
04:10:18.389 --> 04:10:18.399 align:start position:0%
with our equipment business intelligence
 
04:10:20.670 --> 04:10:20.680 align:start position:0%
that's our ebi you'll hear a lot about
 
04:10:22.750 --> 04:10:22.760 align:start position:0%
ebibi and that's we have our data
 
04:10:24.710 --> 04:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
governance sits under
 
04:10:27.070 --> 04:10:27.080 align:start position:0%
ebi and data management data
 
04:10:29.070 --> 04:10:29.080 align:start position:0%
visualizations all our reporting
 
04:10:31.229 --> 04:10:31.239 align:start position:0%
capabilities and
 
04:10:35.309 --> 04:10:35.319 align:start position:0%
analytics information security um we
 
04:10:36.830 --> 04:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
talked a little bit briefly about
 
04:10:38.830 --> 04:10:38.840 align:start position:0%
privacy impact assessments coming into
 
04:10:42.349 --> 04:10:42.359 align:start position:0%
to play and that's uh a strong Avenue
 
04:10:45.269 --> 04:10:45.279 align:start position:0%
the uh data privacy and it security
 
04:10:47.429 --> 04:10:47.439 align:start position:0%
governance board formed by your
 
04:10:50.030 --> 04:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
legislation representative Edwards
 
04:10:53.469 --> 04:10:53.479 align:start position:0%
actually just approved the Pia template
 
04:10:57.349 --> 04:10:57.359 align:start position:0%
to be able to utilize and we have uh
 
04:10:59.750 --> 04:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
been able to fill one of the positions
 
04:11:03.710 --> 04:11:03.720 align:start position:0%
for supporting the the conducting of the
 
04:11:03.720 --> 04:11:05.550 align:start position:0%
for supporting the the conducting of the
pasas

04:11:05.550 --> 04:11:05.560 align:start position:0%
pasas
 
04:11:08.590 --> 04:11:08.600 align:start position:0%
themselves if you look at the next slide
 
04:11:11.870 --> 04:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
slide four it really is just a couple of
 
04:11:14.149 --> 04:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
of points to be able to to see how we
 
04:11:15.870 --> 04:11:15.880 align:start position:0%
exercise our
 
04:11:18.030 --> 04:11:18.040 align:start position:0%
mission here it's driving improved
 
04:11:19.550 --> 04:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
outcomes through enhanced decision-
 
04:11:21.750 --> 04:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
making and productivity listed first and
 
04:11:23.550 --> 04:11:23.560 align:start position:0%
some of the broad examples of how we
 
04:11:23.560 --> 04:11:24.870 align:start position:0%
some of the broad examples of how we
accomplish

04:11:24.870 --> 04:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
accomplish
 
04:11:27.590 --> 04:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
that each of them paying individual
 
04:11:30.149 --> 04:11:30.159 align:start position:0%
attention to how we Empower people
 
04:11:32.229 --> 04:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
self-service options as far as
 
04:11:33.830 --> 04:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
individuals out in the field doing the
 
04:11:36.149 --> 04:11:36.159 align:start position:0%
work with our with the clients and
 
04:11:39.070 --> 04:11:39.080 align:start position:0%
customers and giving them the proper
 
04:11:41.189 --> 04:11:41.199 align:start position:0%
tools to be able to execute more
 
04:11:41.199 --> 04:11:43.590 align:start position:0%
tools to be able to execute more
efficiently

04:11:43.590 --> 04:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
efficiently
 
04:11:45.950 --> 04:11:45.960 align:start position:0%
reducing cost of
 
04:11:48.030 --> 04:11:48.040 align:start position:0%
operation core Services we're going to
 
04:11:50.189 --> 04:11:50.199 align:start position:0%
see examples of that how we've done that
 
04:11:53.389 --> 04:11:53.399 align:start position:0%
from a system perspective when we get to
 
04:11:56.389 --> 04:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
um slides further as
 
04:11:58.950 --> 04:11:58.960 align:start position:0%
well any questions on the information
 
04:12:00.710 --> 04:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
we've covered so far
 
04:12:03.830 --> 04:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
nope oh representative
 
04:12:07.630 --> 04:12:07.640 align:start position:0%
priest uh thank you Mr chairman and um
 
04:12:10.670 --> 04:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
again back to your slide on page three
 
04:12:13.910 --> 04:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
of your handout um is it's my
 
04:12:15.429 --> 04:12:15.439 align:start position:0%
understanding that the staff that you
 
04:12:18.790 --> 04:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
have the 19 or the 21 individuals that
 
04:12:22.349 --> 04:12:22.359 align:start position:0%
you do have the 19 that you are that's
 
04:12:25.510 --> 04:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
in the governor's budget share these
 
04:12:27.870 --> 04:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
responsibilities is that correct or do
 
04:12:30.990 --> 04:12:31.000 align:start position:0%
you have POS number of Staff in each one
 
04:12:33.269 --> 04:12:33.279 align:start position:0%
of these
 
04:12:35.590 --> 04:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
um you're correct yes the
 
04:12:37.830 --> 04:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
responsibilities are shared in and then
 
04:12:39.670 --> 04:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
divide it up around those key function
 
04:12:43.990 --> 04:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
areas one one correction in there are uh
 
04:12:45.750 --> 04:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
person that has the most knowledge so
 
04:12:48.790 --> 04:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
far presenting today occupies one of
 
04:12:50.670 --> 04:12:50.680 align:start position:0%
those positions from a number standpoint
 
04:12:53.469 --> 04:12:53.479 align:start position:0%
I believe and uh David weeders is now
 
04:12:55.830 --> 04:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
Chief Operating Officer so that leaves
 
04:13:00.269 --> 04:13:00.279 align:start position:0%
us with an actual um staff of 20
 
04:13:05.630 --> 04:13:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:12.229 --> 04:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
you 20 now but still 19 next year or is
 
04:13:13.910 --> 04:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
it going to be 18
 
04:13:16.790 --> 04:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
yes so in in state fiscal year 2627
 
04:13:18.790 --> 04:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
there were two positions moved one was
 
04:13:21.590 --> 04:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
moved to uh 5,000 which is the office of
 
04:13:23.510 --> 04:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner accounting unit the other
 
04:13:26.630 --> 04:13:26.640 align:start position:0%
one was moved to 7937 which is Medicaid
 
04:13:29.389 --> 04:13:29.399 align:start position:0%
Administration so there's 19 positions
 
04:13:32.189 --> 04:13:32.199 align:start position:0%
in state fiscal year 26 five are
 
04:13:35.149 --> 04:13:35.159 align:start position:0%
unfunded three uh classified positions
 
04:13:36.790 --> 04:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
are unfunded and two unclassified
 
04:13:39.309 --> 04:13:39.319 align:start position:0%
positions are unfunded thank
 
04:13:42.109 --> 04:13:42.119 align:start position:0%
you a question still representative
 
04:13:42.119 --> 04:13:44.269 align:start position:0%
you a question still representative
priest

04:13:44.269 --> 04:13:44.279 align:start position:0%
priest
 
04:13:48.750 --> 04:13:48.760 align:start position:0%
you represent yeah very very very quick
 
04:13:55.189 --> 04:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
question on page 1060 on line 66 is just
 
04:13:58.710 --> 04:13:58.720 align:start position:0%
curious about the huge uh bump up in
 
04:14:02.349 --> 04:14:02.359 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2025 on on that line and
 
04:14:05.309 --> 04:14:05.319 align:start position:0%
then kind of the
 
04:14:09.149 --> 04:14:09.159 align:start position:0%
uh it just stuck out as a what what was
 
04:14:12.269 --> 04:14:12.279 align:start position:0%
the explanation behind that sure um so
 
04:14:13.910 --> 04:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
so just to clarify so we're looking at
 
04:14:15.830 --> 04:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
the adjusted authorized amount and say
 
04:14:18.030 --> 04:14:18.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 25 not necessarily what was
 
04:14:20.790 --> 04:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
spent um this is related to the training
 
04:14:24.070 --> 04:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
that Ernie was referring to where um we
 
04:14:26.429 --> 04:14:26.439 align:start position:0%
we have sought to train um many of the
 
04:14:28.389 --> 04:14:28.399 align:start position:0%
individuals across the department who
 
04:14:30.670 --> 04:14:30.680 align:start position:0%
may not necessarily be a project manager
 
04:14:32.070 --> 04:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
by training they may have a Social
 
04:14:33.830 --> 04:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
Services background they have may have a
 
04:14:36.590 --> 04:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
specialty in public health but basically
 
04:14:38.510 --> 04:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
uh that money was is being used for
 
04:14:40.870 --> 04:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
training those individuals uh to gain
 
04:14:42.790 --> 04:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
the project management skills to help
 
04:14:45.389 --> 04:14:45.399 align:start position:0%
them with their day-to-day uh tasks and
 
04:14:48.550 --> 04:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
projects so that was like a a one-time
 
04:14:51.510 --> 04:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh bump up because you had a lot of new
 
04:14:53.950 --> 04:14:53.960 align:start position:0%
people with yes and and that's why in
 
04:14:56.550 --> 04:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
the second in the 26 27 you see a pretty
 
04:14:59.109 --> 04:14:59.119 align:start position:0%
significant drop off there okay thank
 
04:15:00.790 --> 04:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
you I can elaborate just a little bit as
 
04:15:03.750 --> 04:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
well just procedurally D changed their
 
04:15:06.109 --> 04:15:06.119 align:start position:0%
their procedures for how we could go
 
04:15:08.950 --> 04:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
about an occupy training and that meant
 
04:15:11.670 --> 04:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
that to secure that training we'd have
 
04:15:13.550 --> 04:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
to be on an RFP
 
04:15:16.550 --> 04:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
process which puts us out Beyond a Time
 
04:15:18.109 --> 04:15:18.119 align:start position:0%
an acceptable time that would' be able
 
04:15:22.830 --> 04:15:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:26.229 --> 04:15:26.239 align:start position:0%
well just a quick followup so that so
 
04:15:28.030 --> 04:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
that means not all that money's been
 
04:15:30.990 --> 04:15:31.000 align:start position:0%
spent yet that's correct it has not been
 
04:15:31.000 --> 04:15:32.750 align:start position:0%
spent yet that's correct it has not been
spent

04:15:32.750 --> 04:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
spent
 
04:15:36.429 --> 04:15:36.439 align:start position:0%
yet we we have needs to be able to put
 
04:15:38.269 --> 04:15:38.279 align:start position:0%
in training but we have to make those
 
04:15:41.309 --> 04:15:41.319 align:start position:0%
decisions to how to best prioritize that
 
04:15:43.790 --> 04:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
and how we can accomplish it without
 
04:15:46.429 --> 04:15:46.439 align:start position:0%
having to um contract and bring someone
 
04:15:49.030 --> 04:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
in to be able to do so approximately
 
04:15:52.389 --> 04:15:52.399 align:start position:0%
approximately how much remains unspent I
 
04:15:53.590 --> 04:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
I I I would need to pull up the
 
04:15:55.309 --> 04:15:55.319 align:start position:0%
statement of Appropriations report to
 
04:15:57.109 --> 04:15:57.119 align:start position:0%
look at what outstanding incumbrances we
 
04:15:59.070 --> 04:15:59.080 align:start position:0%
have and what's been spent year to date
 
04:16:01.389 --> 04:16:01.399 align:start position:0%
to be able to get to that number um any
 
04:16:03.269 --> 04:16:03.279 align:start position:0%
money that's projected to not be
 
04:16:07.070 --> 04:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
utilized this uh particular bium would
 
04:16:09.870 --> 04:16:09.880 align:start position:0%
either lapse if it was General funds or
 
04:16:11.670 --> 04:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
it would be used against the remaining I
 
04:16:13.149 --> 04:16:13.159 align:start position:0%
think roughly 11 or 12 million milon
 
04:16:15.149 --> 04:16:15.159 align:start position:0%
doll back of the budget reduction that
 
04:16:18.710 --> 04:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
we're required to um achieve uh pursuant
 
04:16:23.950 --> 04:16:23.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:28.030 --> 04:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
you and if we uh jump forward to slide
 
04:16:30.710 --> 04:16:30.720 align:start position:0%
five to take a look at the organizations
 
04:16:34.070 --> 04:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
there five and six comprise all of uh
 
04:16:37.030 --> 04:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
Information Services from a staffing
 
04:16:39.030 --> 04:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
perspective uh I know the question came
 
04:16:41.950 --> 04:16:41.960 align:start position:0%
up about what the vacancy rate was and
 
04:16:44.590 --> 04:16:44.600 align:start position:0%
we're at 25 % vacancy
 
04:16:48.309 --> 04:16:48.319 align:start position:0%
rate curly in our in the combined areas
 
04:16:50.469 --> 04:16:50.479 align:start position:0%
of uh Information Services and
 
04:16:53.750 --> 04:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
pmo so so what do you do when you get to
 
04:16:56.870 --> 04:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
a certain vacancy percentage that uh
 
04:16:58.910 --> 04:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
where you you just can't keep up with
 
04:17:01.469 --> 04:17:01.479 align:start position:0%
the uh strategic plan and the and the
 
04:17:04.389 --> 04:17:04.399 align:start position:0%
implementations do you do you do you
 
04:17:06.630 --> 04:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
have a contract you rely on to bring in
 
04:17:09.429 --> 04:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
additional contracted service support
 
04:17:11.149 --> 04:17:11.159 align:start position:0%
well it's one of the items that would'
 
04:17:12.630 --> 04:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
like to be able to discuss further in
 
04:17:14.670 --> 04:17:14.680 align:start position:0%
the slide as well as what we do look
 
04:17:17.389 --> 04:17:17.399 align:start position:0%
look for to be able to offset some of
 
04:17:17.399 --> 04:17:18.149 align:start position:0%
look for to be able to offset some of
the

04:17:18.149 --> 04:17:18.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:17:27.070 --> 04:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:29.710 --> 04:17:29.720 align:start position:0%
right in SL in slide seven we've
 
04:17:30.950 --> 04:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
identified some of the key
 
04:17:34.109 --> 04:17:34.119 align:start position:0%
accomplishments um again here we can run
 
04:17:36.109 --> 04:17:36.119 align:start position:0%
through spend as much time on it but it
 
04:17:37.550 --> 04:17:37.560 align:start position:0%
gives you a sense I think more
 
04:17:40.030 --> 04:17:40.040 align:start position:0%
importantly is our it's our impact
 
04:17:42.070 --> 04:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
really breaks down into the three
 
04:17:45.349 --> 04:17:45.359 align:start position:0%
specific areas is a Statewide
 
04:17:52.189 --> 04:17:52.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:54.510 --> 04:17:54.520 align:start position:0%
specific you
 
04:17:57.189 --> 04:17:57.199 align:start position:0%
see first one for example the enterprise
 
04:17:59.269 --> 04:17:59.279 align:start position:0%
resource planning and Cloud Suite
 
04:18:03.030 --> 04:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
solution that involves um most all
 
04:18:06.070 --> 04:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
aspects of of is from project management
 
04:18:08.269 --> 04:18:08.279 align:start position:0%
to our ebi team and understanding
 
04:18:11.469 --> 04:18:11.479 align:start position:0%
Integrations into our uh security
 
04:18:14.510 --> 04:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
component as well be able to do that and
 
04:18:18.630 --> 04:18:18.640 align:start position:0%
that translates through most every uh
 
04:18:21.429 --> 04:18:21.439 align:start position:0%
effort that we work with across the
 
04:18:23.590 --> 04:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
department one things that one of the
 
04:18:27.189 --> 04:18:27.199 align:start position:0%
things that I'll mention CC Salesforce
 
04:18:29.030 --> 04:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
listed in a couple different
 
04:18:32.030 --> 04:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
places we have the uh we've had the
 
04:18:34.510 --> 04:18:34.520 align:start position:0%
luxury of being able to have the funding
 
04:18:37.750 --> 04:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
to grow Salesforce as a solution which
 
04:18:40.910 --> 04:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
has filled a lot of gaps and done a
 
04:18:43.510 --> 04:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
great job for our front pacing
 
04:18:46.349 --> 04:18:46.359 align:start position:0%
aspects of there when we
 
04:18:48.830 --> 04:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
develop aspects of Salesforce within
 
04:18:51.309 --> 04:18:51.319 align:start position:0%
that solution that ends up being able to
 
04:18:54.510 --> 04:18:54.520 align:start position:0%
be shared across the state as well so
 
04:18:56.309 --> 04:18:56.319 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a a way
 
04:18:59.590 --> 04:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
of duplicating different efforts to come
 
04:19:01.590 --> 04:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
up with the same results so I think
 
04:19:06.790 --> 04:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:09.590 --> 04:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
success Department wide one thing that
 
04:19:10.910 --> 04:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
I'll focus a little bit of time but
 
04:19:12.910 --> 04:19:12.920 align:start position:0%
please ask any questions about about
 
04:19:15.710 --> 04:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
anything specifically on there is that
 
04:19:17.750 --> 04:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
that ability that we've
 
04:19:20.990 --> 04:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
drawn to the Privacy impact assessments
 
04:19:24.830 --> 04:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
and our work there um as Mr
 
04:19:29.109 --> 04:19:29.119 align:start position:0%
weeders explained that the the direction
 
04:19:33.229 --> 04:19:33.239 align:start position:0%
is to be uh consent in as our systems
 
04:19:36.070 --> 04:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
are developed and that's that's been a
 
04:19:39.710 --> 04:19:39.720 align:start position:0%
um an effort that's been going going on
 
04:19:42.070 --> 04:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
as long as I've been here since 2019 to
 
04:19:44.469 --> 04:19:44.479 align:start position:0%
try to turn
 
04:19:47.950 --> 04:19:47.960 align:start position:0%
that Avenue everything that we look at
 
04:19:49.950 --> 04:19:49.960 align:start position:0%
from a development standpoint really has
 
04:19:51.510 --> 04:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
become more privacy
 
04:19:53.630 --> 04:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
Centric and that's success that I've
 
04:19:55.950 --> 04:19:55.960 align:start position:0%
seen over the over my time being here as
 
04:19:59.830 --> 04:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
well so business intelligence coupled I
 
04:20:01.750 --> 04:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
guess eventually with some
 
04:20:04.750 --> 04:20:04.760 align:start position:0%
AI where where do you see probably the
 
04:20:07.830 --> 04:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
number one most lucrative
 
04:20:10.670 --> 04:20:10.680 align:start position:0%
deployment of business intelligence may
 
04:20:13.830 --> 04:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
be in the department in terms of
 
04:20:17.269 --> 04:20:17.279 align:start position:0%
improving Financial recoveries saving
 
04:20:20.149 --> 04:20:20.159 align:start position:0%
costs through enhanced productivity what
 
04:20:22.309 --> 04:20:22.319 align:start position:0%
where what what's our number one lwh
 
04:20:25.030 --> 04:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
hanging fruit and yes Mr weers you're
 
04:20:25.040 --> 04:20:26.469 align:start position:0%
hanging fruit and yes Mr weers you're
welcome

04:20:26.469 --> 04:20:26.479 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
04:20:31.469 --> 04:20:31.479 align:start position:0%
to yes so it considering there is the
 
04:20:34.750 --> 04:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
potential is is terrific it's just start
 
04:20:36.910 --> 04:20:36.920 align:start position:0%
one that understanding I think one of
 
04:20:38.790 --> 04:20:38.800 align:start position:0%
the things that we find the highest
 
04:20:41.030 --> 04:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
value in incorpora from a department
 
04:20:44.990 --> 04:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
wide aspect is um having AI involved
 
04:20:48.750 --> 04:20:48.760 align:start position:0%
with our uh policy and in state laws and
 
04:20:51.710 --> 04:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
regulations so that answers can come at
 
04:20:53.389 --> 04:20:53.399 align:start position:0%
the Press of a button to anyone that is
 
04:20:54.910 --> 04:20:54.920 align:start position:0%
customer facing and understand they're
 
04:20:56.269 --> 04:20:56.279 align:start position:0%
doing the right
 
04:20:58.710 --> 04:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
thing utilizing AI to be able to
 
04:21:01.229 --> 04:21:01.239 align:start position:0%
populate that information to what we can
 
04:21:03.590 --> 04:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
and how it should be
 
04:21:07.269 --> 04:21:07.279 align:start position:0%
done okay I'm I'm looking for the top
 
04:21:10.469 --> 04:21:10.479 align:start position:0%
project that we want to go after the so
 
04:21:12.189 --> 04:21:12.199 align:start position:0%
so the the top project that we want to
 
04:21:13.950 --> 04:21:13.960 align:start position:0%
go after is from two different lenses
 
04:21:15.590 --> 04:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
one from a privacy where we were
 
04:21:17.429 --> 04:21:17.439 align:start position:0%
planning on using a natural language
 
04:21:20.229 --> 04:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
processing tool for um to create a a
 
04:21:22.510 --> 04:21:22.520 align:start position:0%
knowledge base for a chatbot to be able
 
04:21:25.429 --> 04:21:25.439 align:start position:0%
to be used by our staff to look at our
 
04:21:27.229 --> 04:21:27.239 align:start position:0%
administrative rules our policies our
 
04:21:29.510 --> 04:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
procedures and be able to do in real
 
04:21:32.030 --> 04:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
time answers to questions on call
 
04:21:35.189 --> 04:21:35.199 align:start position:0%
centers as well as for elig eligibility
 
04:21:37.830 --> 04:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
determination redetermination so that we
 
04:21:40.149 --> 04:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
don't have delays where we have
 
04:21:41.790 --> 04:21:41.800 align:start position:0%
currently the process where our
 
04:21:44.070 --> 04:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
individuals take anywhere from 6 to
 
04:21:46.750 --> 04:21:46.760 align:start position:0%
months to a year to on board and learn
 
04:21:49.030 --> 04:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
all those policies and procedures and
 
04:21:51.149 --> 04:21:51.159 align:start position:0%
administrative rules they be able to use
 
04:21:53.550 --> 04:21:53.560 align:start position:0%
that natural language processing tool to
 
04:21:55.950 --> 04:21:55.960 align:start position:0%
immediately based off of prompts give
 
04:21:58.550 --> 04:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
them information so they can do the
 
04:22:02.389 --> 04:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
determinations in hours and and days as
 
04:22:05.030 --> 04:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
opposed to weeks and months and so
 
04:22:06.670 --> 04:22:06.680 align:start position:0%
that's and the reason why we wanted to
 
04:22:09.510 --> 04:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
do that um specifically as the first
 
04:22:13.030 --> 04:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
project was it doesn't manage any any
 
04:22:15.189 --> 04:22:15.199 align:start position:0%
private information it's all public data
 
04:22:16.750 --> 04:22:16.760 align:start position:0%
administrative rules policies and
 
04:22:18.790 --> 04:22:18.800 align:start position:0%
procedures so we can prove out that we
 
04:22:21.149 --> 04:22:21.159 align:start position:0%
can create a private natural language
 
04:22:23.229 --> 04:22:23.239 align:start position:0%
processing knowledge base that can
 
04:22:25.429 --> 04:22:25.439 align:start position:0%
manage the security and the privacy of
 
04:22:27.429 --> 04:22:27.439 align:start position:0%
the information but also Drive
 
04:22:29.870 --> 04:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
efficiency in our department we would
 
04:22:32.510 --> 04:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
expand beyond that in the future to be
 
04:22:37.790 --> 04:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
able to do um n um utilize AI to
 
04:22:39.910 --> 04:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
actually program in what we call
 
04:22:42.469 --> 04:22:42.479 align:start position:0%
business rules for determinations of
 
04:22:44.349 --> 04:22:44.359 align:start position:0%
eligibility or other Solutions like
 
04:22:47.070 --> 04:22:47.080 align:start position:0%
child support and whatnot but that would
 
04:22:49.229 --> 04:22:49.239 align:start position:0%
require us to already have a proven
 
04:22:51.149 --> 04:22:51.159 align:start position:0%
concept of ensuring the privacy of the
 
04:22:53.269 --> 04:22:53.279 align:start position:0%
information first so that's how we we
 
04:22:55.349 --> 04:22:55.359 align:start position:0%
sort of staged it we want to we don't
 
04:22:57.830 --> 04:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
want to use data that has highly highly
 
04:23:00.229 --> 04:23:00.239 align:start position:0%
regulated information we don't want to
 
04:23:01.990 --> 04:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
violate our state constitution for
 
04:23:04.550 --> 04:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
privacy in inadvertently by using like a
 
04:23:06.510 --> 04:23:06.520 align:start position:0%
Google or an AWS or
 
04:23:09.990 --> 04:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
Microsoft um tool but we believe that if
 
04:23:11.750 --> 04:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
we go in those steps we'll get to that
 
04:23:13.429 --> 04:23:13.439 align:start position:0%
point of being being able to leverage it
 
04:23:16.030 --> 04:23:16.040 align:start position:0%
to a better return on investment as you
 
04:23:18.830 --> 04:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
indicated earlier sounds good when when
 
04:23:21.269 --> 04:23:21.279 align:start position:0%
you guys come up with like a strategic
 
04:23:23.550 --> 04:23:23.560 align:start position:0%
plan on how you plan on rolling that out
 
04:23:25.510 --> 04:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
and developing it I I I would be
 
04:23:28.349 --> 04:23:28.359 align:start position:0%
interested in seeing that and I would
 
04:23:32.030 --> 04:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
hope that U Miss tus tell us would have
 
04:23:34.070 --> 04:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of input in there because it
 
04:23:37.269 --> 04:23:37.279 align:start position:0%
struck me as she gave her presentation
 
04:23:39.309 --> 04:23:39.319 align:start position:0%
that there may be a lot of opportunity
 
04:23:41.389 --> 04:23:41.399 align:start position:0%
to help with sort of the behavior
 
04:23:43.750 --> 04:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
identification or she's looking for
 
04:23:46.550 --> 04:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
misbehavior misbehavior identification
 
04:23:48.469 --> 04:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
and and uh
 
04:23:51.109 --> 04:23:51.119 align:start position:0%
unusual uh submissions that should be
 
04:23:53.189 --> 04:23:53.199 align:start position:0%
flagged and looked at I just seem it
 
04:23:56.590 --> 04:23:56.600 align:start position:0%
seems like a Target Rich environment but
 
04:23:56.600 --> 04:23:57.429 align:start position:0%
seems like a Target Rich environment but
all

04:23:57.429 --> 04:23:57.439 align:start position:0%
all
 
04:24:00.109 --> 04:24:00.119 align:start position:0%
right thanks
 
04:24:02.670 --> 04:24:02.680 align:start position:0%
absolutely go
 
04:24:05.830 --> 04:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
ahead oh uh representative
 
04:24:08.870 --> 04:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
Stringham um could you expand at all on
 
04:24:12.590 --> 04:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
line 27 um uh you know roughly 50
 
04:24:16.389 --> 04:24:16.399 align:start position:0%
million line how many uh how how does
 
04:24:19.429 --> 04:24:19.439 align:start position:0%
how does that get spent and uh
 
04:24:22.109 --> 04:24:22.119 align:start position:0%
appropriated where does it go what's the
 
04:24:24.550 --> 04:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
process to decide how to spend that so
 
04:24:28.910 --> 04:24:28.920 align:start position:0%
yes thank you I sure can the um so again
 
04:24:30.670 --> 04:24:30.680 align:start position:0%
with all the uh Department of
 
04:24:32.830 --> 04:24:32.840 align:start position:0%
responsibilities from a system
 
04:24:36.070 --> 04:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
standpoint the that's this comprises the
 
04:24:39.229 --> 04:24:39.239 align:start position:0%
operational budget of all those systems
 
04:24:41.750 --> 04:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
so we generate that in uh cooperation
 
04:24:43.990 --> 04:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
and collaboration with doit for
 
04:24:46.349 --> 04:24:46.359 align:start position:0%
understanding those needs uh put those
 
04:24:48.990 --> 04:24:49.000 align:start position:0%
funds together to be able to support all
 
04:24:51.269 --> 04:24:51.279 align:start position:0%
of the systems in play across the
 
04:24:53.349 --> 04:24:53.359 align:start position:0%
department that's what that funding line
 
04:24:53.359 --> 04:24:54.349 align:start position:0%
department that's what that funding line
is

04:24:54.349 --> 04:24:54.359 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:24:57.550 --> 04:24:57.560 align:start position:0%
for so so is this is this somewhere else
 
04:25:00.030 --> 04:25:00.040 align:start position:0%
in the budget that they they show this
 
04:25:03.950 --> 04:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
48 million in roughly which was 24 is
 
04:25:07.830 --> 04:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
that important element too is doit
 
04:25:11.550 --> 04:25:11.560 align:start position:0%
supports DHHS through their Staffing as
 
04:25:14.990 --> 04:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
well and these numbers are in uh part of
 
04:25:15.000 --> 04:25:16.189 align:start position:0%
well and these numbers are in uh part of
that

04:25:16.189 --> 04:25:16.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:25:19.309 --> 04:25:19.319 align:start position:0%
offset yes I I believe division one
 
04:25:20.790 --> 04:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
covers the department of Information
 
04:25:22.590 --> 04:25:22.600 align:start position:0%
Technology so there's an equivalent
 
04:25:25.830 --> 04:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
transfer line located in their budget
 
04:25:28.109 --> 04:25:28.119 align:start position:0%
and if you look in in the governor's
 
04:25:30.590 --> 04:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
operating budget if you do uh ever look
 
04:25:32.469 --> 04:25:32.479 align:start position:0%
at page
 
04:25:35.070 --> 04:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
1064 what you will see down there at the
 
04:25:38.109 --> 04:25:38.119 align:start position:0%
bottom is you will see the federal funds
 
04:25:39.830 --> 04:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
the general funds education trust fund
 
04:25:42.309 --> 04:25:42.319 align:start position:0%
other funds and then you'll see less
 
04:25:45.189 --> 04:25:45.199 align:start position:0%
funds for budgeted Revenue transfers and
 
04:25:47.229 --> 04:25:47.239 align:start position:0%
the number that will be found there is
 
04:25:50.550 --> 04:25:50.560 align:start position:0%
that 54 and55 million that you see in
 
04:25:53.229 --> 04:25:53.239 align:start position:0%
class 27 because that money is being
 
04:25:54.750 --> 04:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
moved over to the Department of
 
04:25:56.269 --> 04:25:56.279 align:start position:0%
Information Technology and being
 
04:26:06.910 --> 04:26:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:09.550 --> 04:26:09.560 align:start position:0%
there all right the next slide slide
 
04:26:12.389 --> 04:26:12.399 align:start position:0%
eight basically just direct you to to
 
04:26:15.269 --> 04:26:15.279 align:start position:0%
the area that we're looking at now in
 
04:26:17.590 --> 04:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
04:26:20.550 --> 04:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
book Slide N really was just a
 
04:26:23.269 --> 04:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
visualization of the of the systems in
 
04:26:27.269 --> 04:26:27.279 align:start position:0%
play that center around the road map um
 
04:26:27.279 --> 04:26:28.630 align:start position:0%
play that center around the road map um
commitments

04:26:28.630 --> 04:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
commitments
 
04:26:30.830 --> 04:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
here we weren't going to spend much time
 
04:26:32.429 --> 04:26:32.439 align:start position:0%
on that unless there specific questions
 
04:26:33.790 --> 04:26:33.800 align:start position:0%
on it but did want to be able to
 
04:26:36.630 --> 04:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
visually tie in um the systems that are
 
04:26:43.109 --> 04:26:43.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:43.119 --> 04:26:44.070 align:start position:0%
 
slide

04:26:44.070 --> 04:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
slide
 
04:26:46.910 --> 04:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
10 I'm just going to ask uh Nathan to
 
04:26:49.229 --> 04:26:49.239 align:start position:0%
kind of talk to before I get into
 
04:26:51.950 --> 04:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
details a bit sure so this is just
 
04:26:54.269 --> 04:26:54.279 align:start position:0%
following up on uh representative walner
 
04:26:56.429 --> 04:26:56.439 align:start position:0%
request from yesterday as far as listing
 
04:26:59.189 --> 04:26:59.199 align:start position:0%
out the prioritized needs um that were
 
04:27:01.469 --> 04:27:01.479 align:start position:0%
funded or not funded in the agency's
 
04:27:04.269 --> 04:27:04.279 align:start position:0%
budget um when we prepare I I think just
 
04:27:06.349 --> 04:27:06.359 align:start position:0%
for background and context for for some
 
04:27:07.790 --> 04:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
of the members that are newer to this
 
04:27:10.229 --> 04:27:10.239 align:start position:0%
process we prepare our agency budget
 
04:27:12.670 --> 04:27:12.680 align:start position:0%
back in August when we when we prepare
 
04:27:14.830 --> 04:27:14.840 align:start position:0%
that agency budget there's two major
 
04:27:16.670 --> 04:27:16.680 align:start position:0%
components to it there's the efficiency
 
04:27:18.429 --> 04:27:18.439 align:start position:0%
expenditure budget which is basically
 
04:27:20.710 --> 04:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
what your cost to continue Baseline
 
04:27:22.910 --> 04:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
operations and then there is the
 
04:27:25.389 --> 04:27:25.399 align:start position:0%
governor's directive and the governor um
 
04:27:28.710 --> 04:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
his directive May potent he or she uh
 
04:27:31.349 --> 04:27:31.359 align:start position:0%
May potentially run slightly counter to
 
04:27:33.149 --> 04:27:33.159 align:start position:0%
what the efficiency expenditure is based
 
04:27:35.630 --> 04:27:35.640 align:start position:0%
on Revenue projections um that need to
 
04:27:38.469 --> 04:27:38.479 align:start position:0%
be accounted for and so when we prepared
 
04:27:40.750 --> 04:27:40.760 align:start position:0%
our original efficiency budget some
 
04:27:43.030 --> 04:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
baseline efficiency cost cost such as
 
04:27:44.670 --> 04:27:44.680 align:start position:0%
some of the state fiscal year 24
 
04:27:48.990 --> 04:27:49.000 align:start position:0%
legislation SP 463 SP uh 1573 some of
 
04:27:50.990 --> 04:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
those items were included as prioritized
 
04:27:52.830 --> 04:27:52.840 align:start position:0%
need because we were unable to get to
 
04:27:55.670 --> 04:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
the Target that we were given um there
 
04:27:58.870 --> 04:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
are a number of key IT projects uh
 
04:28:00.950 --> 04:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
listed here um two of which we talked
 
04:28:03.149 --> 04:28:03.159 align:start position:0%
about earlier relative to the Salesforce
 
04:28:05.309 --> 04:28:05.319 align:start position:0%
the the budget intelligence system as
 
04:28:07.510 --> 04:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
well as the docy sign system and I just
 
04:28:08.990 --> 04:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
kind of want to provide some of that
 
04:28:10.630 --> 04:28:10.640 align:start position:0%
context uh obviously there's a lot of
 
04:28:11.990 --> 04:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
hard choices that have to be made during
 
04:28:15.070 --> 04:28:15.080 align:start position:0%
the the budget process um but currently
 
04:28:16.389 --> 04:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
uh these are these are some of the
 
04:28:19.189 --> 04:28:19.199 align:start position:0%
system enhancements or efficiencies that
 
04:28:21.910 --> 04:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
we were unable to get within our initial
 
04:28:23.389 --> 04:28:23.399 align:start position:0%
efficiency budget that are currently
 
04:28:27.070 --> 04:28:27.080 align:start position:0%
unfunded and I'll hand it over to
 
04:28:29.750 --> 04:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
Ernie uh representative
 
04:28:32.710 --> 04:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
PRI thank you Mr chairman again on this
 
04:28:35.389 --> 04:28:35.399 align:start position:0%
page 10 could you just briefly describe
 
04:28:39.149 --> 04:28:39.159 align:start position:0%
the new heights efficiency consolidation
 
04:28:41.510 --> 04:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
in the cell Force I'm just not familiar
 
04:28:42.790 --> 04:28:42.800 align:start position:0%
with those two
 
04:28:46.469 --> 04:28:46.479 align:start position:0%
uh sure projects so the new heights is
 
04:28:49.309 --> 04:28:49.319 align:start position:0%
our eligibility system that's utilized
 
04:28:52.590 --> 04:28:52.600 align:start position:0%
for many different aspects of uh our
 
04:28:55.870 --> 04:28:55.880 align:start position:0%
services across across the department
 
04:28:57.309 --> 04:28:57.319 align:start position:0%
one of the things where I'm talking
 
04:28:59.910 --> 04:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
about it here is a large portion of the
 
04:29:03.109 --> 04:29:03.119 align:start position:0%
efficiency aspect was carved out of it
 
04:29:05.830 --> 04:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
um and the important aspects to bring in
 
04:29:08.070 --> 04:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
as as an effort to be efficient and
 
04:29:11.109 --> 04:29:11.119 align:start position:0%
consolidate some of the systems utilized
 
04:29:12.670 --> 04:29:12.680 align:start position:0%
AC elsewhere in the department they were
 
04:29:15.429 --> 04:29:15.439 align:start position:0%
brought into New Heights to
 
04:29:17.790 --> 04:29:17.800 align:start position:0%
accomplish what had to happen for those
 
04:29:19.790 --> 04:29:19.800 align:start position:0%
individual systems as new heights could
 
04:29:21.990 --> 04:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
take that but it also meant that it was
 
04:29:23.710 --> 04:29:23.720 align:start position:0%
an expanded use of new heights which
 
04:29:25.670 --> 04:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
requires additional maintenance
 
04:29:27.469 --> 04:29:27.479 align:start position:0%
enhancements and refinements to be able
 
04:29:31.590 --> 04:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:34.149 --> 04:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
well okay what about Salesforce
 
04:29:36.950 --> 04:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
development Salesforce development is is
 
04:29:39.510 --> 04:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
the area that we have um seen a lot of
 
04:29:42.389 --> 04:29:42.399 align:start position:0%
benefits by creating a system systems
 
04:29:46.790 --> 04:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
such as uh Incident Management System
 
04:29:46.800 --> 04:29:48.189 align:start position:0%
such as uh Incident Management System
our

04:29:48.189 --> 04:29:48.199 align:start position:0%
our
 
04:29:51.349 --> 04:29:51.359 align:start position:0%
constituent inquiry and response
 
04:29:55.510 --> 04:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
system and uh Incident Management System
 
04:29:57.469 --> 04:29:57.479 align:start position:0%
just to expand a little bit has has
 
04:29:57.479 --> 04:29:58.790 align:start position:0%
just to expand a little bit has has
provided

04:29:58.790 --> 04:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
provided
 
04:30:01.389 --> 04:30:01.399 align:start position:0%
solutions from several areas New
 
04:30:04.349 --> 04:30:04.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital for example
 
04:30:08.030 --> 04:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
dcyf um we have um in public health we
 
04:30:11.990 --> 04:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
have the immunization information system
 
04:30:12.000 --> 04:30:13.189 align:start position:0%
have the immunization information system
that's

04:30:13.189 --> 04:30:13.199 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:30:15.389 --> 04:30:15.399 align:start position:0%
utilizing the uh Incident Management
 
04:30:19.309 --> 04:30:19.319 align:start position:0%
System as well as uh dpq in their
 
04:30:19.319 --> 04:30:21.229 align:start position:0%
System as well as uh dpq in their
Century

04:30:21.229 --> 04:30:21.239 align:start position:0%
Century
 
04:30:24.429 --> 04:30:24.439 align:start position:0%
events that are being utilized as
 
04:30:27.950 --> 04:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
well what is what the Salesforce has
 
04:30:30.830 --> 04:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
done for us is be able to answer a lot
 
04:30:32.309 --> 04:30:32.319 align:start position:0%
of the questions that have been business
 
04:30:34.710 --> 04:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
problems um working through spreadsheets
 
04:30:37.830 --> 04:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
and trying to have a have a solution
 
04:30:40.670 --> 04:30:40.680 align:start position:0%
that is a very usable front-end aspect
 
04:30:43.670 --> 04:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
for solving that and then our ability to
 
04:30:45.830 --> 04:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
be able to tie in the data that we
 
04:30:47.870 --> 04:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
collect within the Salesforce to be able
 
04:30:50.149 --> 04:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
to integrate that with the other systems
 
04:30:52.269 --> 04:30:52.279 align:start position:0%
to have a full benefit around that to
 
04:30:54.870 --> 04:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
include ebi and our uh document
 
04:30:56.950 --> 04:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
Management Systems as
 
04:31:00.790 --> 04:31:00.800 align:start position:0%
well as a followup on that same page did
 
04:31:03.349 --> 04:31:03.359 align:start position:0%
you prepare a like a cost benefit
 
04:31:06.429 --> 04:31:06.439 align:start position:0%
analysis we have the cost of these
 
04:31:09.189 --> 04:31:09.199 align:start position:0%
programs that were not funded but do you
 
04:31:12.189 --> 04:31:12.199 align:start position:0%
have like a a dollar figure of the
 
04:31:16.149 --> 04:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
benefits of savings that would happen if
 
04:31:19.590 --> 04:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
these programs were funded to not only
 
04:31:23.309 --> 04:31:23.319 align:start position:0%
the department but also to the state we
 
04:31:26.269 --> 04:31:26.279 align:start position:0%
don't have one um developed here but
 
04:31:27.910 --> 04:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
glad to be able to provide that
 
04:31:30.349 --> 04:31:30.359 align:start position:0%
information I I I I think one easy
 
04:31:32.030 --> 04:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
number to point back to is what we
 
04:31:33.910 --> 04:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
talked about this morning um when we
 
04:31:35.550 --> 04:31:35.560 align:start position:0%
were looking at the federal funds that
 
04:31:37.510 --> 04:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
we were no longer lapsing while it may
 
04:31:40.269 --> 04:31:40.279 align:start position:0%
not be a perfect year-to-year
 
04:31:42.389 --> 04:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
comparison um the
 
04:31:44.710 --> 04:31:44.720 align:start position:0%
the the the general funds that we were
 
04:31:48.710 --> 04:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
able to offset when we budgeted were in
 
04:31:50.870 --> 04:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
the tens of millions of dollars um and
 
04:31:52.670 --> 04:31:52.680 align:start position:0%
that's a several hundred, system that
 
04:31:54.550 --> 04:31:54.560 align:start position:0%
falls within the Salesforce development
 
04:31:56.670 --> 04:31:56.680 align:start position:0%
team that's the kind of work at least on
 
04:31:57.950 --> 04:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
the finance side obviously there's
 
04:31:59.109 --> 04:31:59.119 align:start position:0%
different types of work that are going
 
04:32:01.630 --> 04:32:01.640 align:start position:0%
on across the department um but I don't
 
04:32:04.269 --> 04:32:04.279 align:start position:0%
think we have a a formal comprehensive
 
04:32:06.750 --> 04:32:06.760 align:start position:0%
department-wide analysis to address that
 
04:32:09.189 --> 04:32:09.199 align:start position:0%
exact question that would be very
 
04:32:11.670 --> 04:32:11.680 align:start position:0%
beneficial in the future but to come up
 
04:32:13.950 --> 04:32:13.960 align:start position:0%
with I'll take that back so I actually
 
04:32:16.510 --> 04:32:16.520 align:start position:0%
think there's an easy low hanging fruit
 
04:32:21.510 --> 04:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
one here um on the bottom of uh page 10
 
04:32:24.229 --> 04:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
the E signature solution I I think we
 
04:32:27.109 --> 04:32:27.119 align:start position:0%
heard testimony earlier that if we went
 
04:32:30.790 --> 04:32:30.800 align:start position:0%
back to uh chasing down wet ink
 
04:32:34.149 --> 04:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
signatures that that would uh create U
 
04:32:36.750 --> 04:32:36.760 align:start position:0%
not only time lags but it would also
 
04:32:39.550 --> 04:32:39.560 align:start position:0%
cost a tremendous amount of manpower to
 
04:32:43.030 --> 04:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
run around chasing this down so so to me
 
04:32:46.070 --> 04:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
it's a very simple little business case
 
04:32:47.830 --> 04:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
justification what do we think the manh
 
04:32:49.910 --> 04:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
hour impact and what would do we think
 
04:32:52.710 --> 04:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
the delay getting contract signed what
 
04:32:55.070 --> 04:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
what what what's the cost of that
 
04:32:59.469 --> 04:32:59.479 align:start position:0%
relative to the 346,000 in uh General
 
04:33:01.590 --> 04:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
funds and if you started with a low
 
04:33:03.469 --> 04:33:03.479 align:start position:0%
hanging fruit one we could kick it back
 
04:33:05.949 --> 04:33:05.959 align:start position:0%
around a little bit and and see how it
 
04:33:09.230 --> 04:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
feels whether or not it's worth pursuing
 
04:33:10.830 --> 04:33:10.840 align:start position:0%
similar to what representative priest
 
04:33:12.789 --> 04:33:12.799 align:start position:0%
just suggested for the the other ones
 
04:33:14.709 --> 04:33:14.719 align:start position:0%
sure that makes sense that's my guess
 
04:33:17.670 --> 04:33:17.680 align:start position:0%
that's the easiest one to do if I may I
 
04:33:19.230 --> 04:33:19.240 align:start position:0%
would I would agree with you
 
04:33:22.830 --> 04:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards most of the goals
 
04:33:24.551 --> 04:33:24.561 align:start position:0%
of our technology is to improve
 
04:33:26.310 --> 04:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
productivity reduce duplication of
 
04:33:28.629 --> 04:33:28.639 align:start position:0%
effort the return on investment is
 
04:33:31.910 --> 04:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
reducing error errors in in doing work
 
04:33:34.269 --> 04:33:34.279 align:start position:0%
and also improving the efficiency of
 
04:33:37.230 --> 04:33:37.240 align:start position:0%
those services so just just as a
 
04:33:39.029 --> 04:33:39.039 align:start position:0%
component of the Salesforce development
 
04:33:41.230 --> 04:33:41.240 align:start position:0%
team that represents seven outside
 
04:33:41.240 --> 04:33:42.230 align:start position:0%
team that represents seven outside
contractors

04:33:42.230 --> 04:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
contractors
 
04:33:44.910 --> 04:33:44.920 align:start position:0%
for one year so let's not do do do each
 
04:33:47.670 --> 04:33:47.680 align:start position:0%
one let's just let's just take as many
 
04:33:50.150 --> 04:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
as you want to give us something back so
 
04:33:53.029 --> 04:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
we can look at but we need a business
 
04:33:54.910 --> 04:33:54.920 align:start position:0%
case much like representative priest
 
04:33:56.429 --> 04:33:56.439 align:start position:0%
just said certainly we can take that
 
04:33:58.029 --> 04:33:58.039 align:start position:0%
back and get you I don't know that we
 
04:34:00.590 --> 04:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
could consider these without in the
 
04:34:03.470 --> 04:34:03.480 align:start position:0%
absence of okay so what is the return on
 
04:34:05.869 --> 04:34:05.879 align:start position:0%
investment I think we will certainly
 
04:34:07.429 --> 04:34:07.439 align:start position:0%
take that back and give you a couple of
 
04:34:09.429 --> 04:34:09.439 align:start position:0%
examples of the return on investment of
 
04:34:12.349 --> 04:34:12.359 align:start position:0%
this team that the one component that
 
04:34:14.349 --> 04:34:14.359 align:start position:0%
you'll see in that example is that this
 
04:34:16.910 --> 04:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
is an agile team so it works on features
 
04:34:19.990 --> 04:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
and fun and epics which means that might
 
04:34:22.551 --> 04:34:22.561 align:start position:0%
be deploying a budget system today and
 
04:34:24.990 --> 04:34:25.000 align:start position:0%
then a constituent management system in
 
04:34:26.869 --> 04:34:26.879 align:start position:0%
a month and then another system the
 
04:34:28.830 --> 04:34:28.840 align:start position:0%
following month and we're constantly
 
04:34:31.269 --> 04:34:31.279 align:start position:0%
evaluating um different products as we
 
04:34:33.109 --> 04:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
go forward so that we don't limit
 
04:34:35.470 --> 04:34:35.480 align:start position:0%
ourselves to one solution that we can
 
04:34:37.590 --> 04:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
actually streamline and improve multiple
 
04:34:39.470 --> 04:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
Solutions sure I'd just suggest the
 
04:34:41.869 --> 04:34:41.879 align:start position:0%
first one that we go kick back and forth
 
04:34:45.349 --> 04:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
we we remember the kiss principle just
 
04:34:48.189 --> 04:34:48.199 align:start position:0%
keep it keep it simple for the stupid
 
04:34:51.269 --> 04:34:51.279 align:start position:0%
just tell you know we we'll bring that
 
04:34:55.551 --> 04:34:55.561 align:start position:0%
back we'll send that W did you have a
 
04:34:59.830 --> 04:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
question this is a question for uh Mr
 
04:35:02.390 --> 04:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
White this is the first time today that
 
04:35:05.470 --> 04:35:05.480 align:start position:0%
we've seen this
 
04:35:10.029 --> 04:35:10.039 align:start position:0%
um page entitled unfunded areas impacted
 
04:35:11.709 --> 04:35:11.719 align:start position:0%
does that mean that in the other are
 
04:35:13.949 --> 04:35:13.959 align:start position:0%
areas that we went through today that
 
04:35:15.709 --> 04:35:15.719 align:start position:0%
there were no
 
04:35:15.719 --> 04:35:17.310 align:start position:0%
there were no
um

04:35:17.310 --> 04:35:17.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:20.551 --> 04:35:20.561 align:start position:0%
priority yeah so priorities the only
 
04:35:22.750 --> 04:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
other area was the the
 
04:35:25.869 --> 04:35:25.879 align:start position:0%
$102,000 each year for the LinkedIn uh
 
04:35:30.070 --> 04:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
HR um resource um D just due to the
 
04:35:32.230 --> 04:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
because we've only had a pretty small
 
04:35:34.150 --> 04:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
window to prepare these and update them
 
04:35:35.750 --> 04:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
based on the governor's budget coming
 
04:35:37.670 --> 04:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
out we weren't able to update that
 
04:35:39.709 --> 04:35:39.719 align:start position:0%
particular slide but in all the other
 
04:35:41.869 --> 04:35:41.879 align:start position:0%
division slides that will be presented
 
04:35:44.349 --> 04:35:44.359 align:start position:0%
you will be seeing the same duplicated
 
04:35:46.670 --> 04:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
or something similar uh that will be
 
04:35:48.189 --> 04:35:48.199 align:start position:0%
captured at the end there but that's the
 
04:35:50.269 --> 04:35:50.279 align:start position:0%
only one that that we weren't able to
 
04:35:52.189 --> 04:35:52.199 align:start position:0%
get everything 100% in order and just
 
04:35:54.390 --> 04:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
preparing all these on a pretty quick
 
04:35:56.670 --> 04:35:56.680 align:start position:0%
turnaround time frame great thank you of
 
04:35:59.590 --> 04:35:59.600 align:start position:0%
course helpful representative
 
04:36:03.910 --> 04:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
priest thank you Mr chairman um uh back
 
04:36:07.429 --> 04:36:07.439 align:start position:0%
to the discussion on the AI I'm I'm glad
 
04:36:11.230 --> 04:36:11.240 align:start position:0%
you're uh use utilizing AI in your
 
04:36:14.189 --> 04:36:14.199 align:start position:0%
current Services is that
 
04:36:16.709 --> 04:36:16.719 align:start position:0%
correct um thank you for the question
 
04:36:19.830 --> 04:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
not yet we are looking to to doing that
 
04:36:22.789 --> 04:36:22.799 align:start position:0%
are there safeguards to protect the
 
04:36:25.789 --> 04:36:25.799 align:start position:0%
agency and the people of New Hampshire
 
04:36:27.990 --> 04:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
and and that is entirely why we're doing
 
04:36:31.470 --> 04:36:31.480 align:start position:0%
most of as um Mr gilan indicated we're
 
04:36:33.709 --> 04:36:33.719 align:start position:0%
focusing on policy procedure first and
 
04:36:35.830 --> 04:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
then we're going to focus on a natural
 
04:36:38.750 --> 04:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
language processing tool for public data
 
04:36:40.910 --> 04:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
that's already out there in the public
 
04:36:43.349 --> 04:36:43.359 align:start position:0%
to prove the solution improve out this
 
04:36:45.150 --> 04:36:45.160 align:start position:0%
privacy and security component so that
 
04:36:48.670 --> 04:36:48.680 align:start position:0%
we can look at the policy implement the
 
04:36:51.150 --> 04:36:51.160 align:start position:0%
policy with the solution that if it has
 
04:36:54.551 --> 04:36:54.561 align:start position:0%
any leakage or qu data quality issues
 
04:36:56.830 --> 04:36:56.840 align:start position:0%
that is public information anyway so
 
04:36:59.029 --> 04:36:59.039 align:start position:0%
we're not having a high risk and then
 
04:37:01.949 --> 04:37:01.959 align:start position:0%
from there we'll refine our policy and
 
04:37:05.189 --> 04:37:05.199 align:start position:0%
procedures to ensure that the the more
 
04:37:08.390 --> 04:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
protective uh the Privacy um regulated
 
04:37:11.269 --> 04:37:11.279 align:start position:0%
data that we manage if we move into that
 
04:37:14.670 --> 04:37:14.680 align:start position:0%
in in the future that it wouldn't be um
 
04:37:19.230 --> 04:37:19.240 align:start position:0%
protected as a state solution not a open
 
04:37:19.240 --> 04:37:20.470 align:start position:0%
protected as a state solution not a open
AI

04:37:20.470 --> 04:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
AI
 
04:37:24.750 --> 04:37:24.760 align:start position:0%
solution as a followup um so the
 
04:37:26.551 --> 04:37:26.561 align:start position:0%
information that you're collecting now
 
04:37:28.910 --> 04:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
for Medicare and
 
04:37:33.109 --> 04:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
Medicaid uh in this state and the fact
 
04:37:35.629 --> 04:37:35.639 align:start position:0%
that it's you know we have a provision
 
04:37:39.590 --> 04:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
in our constitution to really value
 
04:37:41.869 --> 04:37:41.879 align:start position:0%
privacy um are there anything that you
 
04:37:44.269 --> 04:37:44.279 align:start position:0%
can and I'm sure that you share that
 
04:37:47.150 --> 04:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
information with the federal
 
04:37:50.470 --> 04:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
government is that correct federal
 
04:37:55.629 --> 04:37:55.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:58.189 --> 04:37:58.199 align:start position:0%
from yeah but this is kind of a I'm
 
04:38:01.390 --> 04:38:01.400 align:start position:0%
sorry no it's just F you just you know
 
04:38:03.551 --> 04:38:03.561 align:start position:0%
you started talking about Ai and how
 
04:38:06.109 --> 04:38:06.119 align:start position:0%
we're going to roll Ai and now you're
 
04:38:09.269 --> 04:38:09.279 align:start position:0%
talking about data sharing with the
 
04:38:10.709 --> 04:38:10.719 align:start position:0%
federal government and other third
 
04:38:12.349 --> 04:38:12.359 align:start position:0%
parties with it's just a different
 
04:38:15.230 --> 04:38:15.240 align:start position:0%
subject thank you for uh pointing that
 
04:38:17.429 --> 04:38:17.439 align:start position:0%
out all right I really appreciate ask
 
04:38:19.230 --> 04:38:19.240 align:start position:0%
whatever question you ask okay going
 
04:38:22.750 --> 04:38:22.760 align:start position:0%
back to the information sharing um with
 
04:38:26.390 --> 04:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
the federal government um again what
 
04:38:28.349 --> 04:38:28.359 align:start position:0%
Provisions do you have to kind of
 
04:38:30.670 --> 04:38:30.680 align:start position:0%
Safeguard the information that we are
 
04:38:32.869 --> 04:38:32.879 align:start position:0%
collecting here in the
 
04:38:35.949 --> 04:38:35.959 align:start position:0%
state it this is separate of yeah
 
04:38:39.830 --> 04:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
relevant to AI all right so David you
 
04:38:42.349 --> 04:38:42.359 align:start position:0%
want to exp sure it it depends on the
 
04:38:45.629 --> 04:38:45.639 align:start position:0%
data set so every like Medicaid has
 
04:38:48.510 --> 04:38:48.520 align:start position:0%
specific Regulatory and um state and
 
04:38:50.869 --> 04:38:50.879 align:start position:0%
federal laws governing that information
 
04:38:52.629 --> 04:38:52.639 align:start position:0%
who we can share it with so we follow
 
04:38:54.709 --> 04:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
those state and federal laws I can take
 
04:38:56.269 --> 04:38:56.279 align:start position:0%
that like from Medicaid I would go back
 
04:38:58.830 --> 04:38:58.840 align:start position:0%
to Henry Litman our Medicaid director on
 
04:39:01.390 --> 04:39:01.400 align:start position:0%
how he would manage sharing data with
 
04:39:04.590 --> 04:39:04.600 align:start position:0%
our federal Partners um but in every
 
04:39:07.070 --> 04:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
case we follow that we identify what
 
04:39:10.709 --> 04:39:10.719 align:start position:0%
laws are are the data is governed by and
 
04:39:13.150 --> 04:39:13.160 align:start position:0%
then we com create data sharing
 
04:39:15.150 --> 04:39:15.160 align:start position:0%
agreements where are necessary or
 
04:39:16.949 --> 04:39:16.959 align:start position:0%
information exchange agreements is what
 
04:39:19.390 --> 04:39:19.400 align:start position:0%
we usually do with our federal Partners
 
04:39:22.429 --> 04:39:22.439 align:start position:0%
or memorandums of understandings with um
 
04:39:25.349 --> 04:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
within our our state departments to
 
04:39:27.830 --> 04:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
share the information and within those M
 
04:39:30.670 --> 04:39:30.680 align:start position:0%
us we work through our privacy officer
 
04:39:32.429 --> 04:39:32.439 align:start position:0%
to ensure that we know exactly what
 
04:39:34.551 --> 04:39:34.561 align:start position:0%
Fields we're sharing who we're sharing
 
04:39:36.830 --> 04:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
them with that we have legal authority
 
04:39:39.390 --> 04:39:39.400 align:start position:0%
to share them with those those entities
 
04:39:41.350 --> 04:39:41.360 align:start position:0%
and if we don't then we don't we don't
 
04:39:42.868 --> 04:39:42.878 align:start position:0%
purs it we don't move forward with
 
04:39:45.708 --> 04:39:45.718 align:start position:0%
sharing okay thank you and I and again I
 
04:39:47.708 --> 04:39:47.718 align:start position:0%
I apologize no you're fine you're you're
 
04:39:50.788 --> 04:39:50.798 align:start position:0%
great uh the the and then the final ring
 
04:39:53.990 --> 04:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
in the defense in depth is is uh
 
04:39:57.030 --> 04:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
Meredith ts's group is doing audits to
 
04:39:59.190 --> 04:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
ensure compliance with state federal law
 
04:40:01.510 --> 04:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
so there's there's yet another layer of
 
04:40:03.990 --> 04:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
kind of an independent oversight to make
 
04:40:06.750 --> 04:40:06.760 align:start position:0%
sure that we're following data sharing
 
04:40:09.070 --> 04:40:09.080 align:start position:0%
uh regulations and and
 
04:40:11.390 --> 04:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
agreements I I believe that's true is is
 
04:40:14.270 --> 04:40:14.280 align:start position:0%
it not she does review the data sets and
 
04:40:16.270 --> 04:40:16.280 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're following all the
 
04:40:18.390 --> 04:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
the the regs through an audit to ensure
 
04:40:19.990 --> 04:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
that we're sharing with the right people
 
04:40:21.350 --> 04:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
and for the right reasons yeah so it
 
04:40:23.230 --> 04:40:23.240 align:start position:0%
sounds like you have a nice defense in
 
04:40:27.948 --> 04:40:27.958 align:start position:0%
depth approach to protecting dat data
 
04:40:32.990 --> 04:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:37.190 --> 04:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
do represent Stringham yeah just a uh
 
04:40:39.628 --> 04:40:39.638 align:start position:0%
just a little bug you know Hippa is
 
04:40:39.638 --> 04:40:41.910 align:start position:0%
just a little bug you know Hippa is
HIPAA

04:40:41.910 --> 04:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
HIPAA
 
04:40:44.550 --> 04:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
uh so it's Hippa
 
04:40:48.350 --> 04:40:48.360 align:start position:0%
Hippa in a bunch of the documents uh but
 
04:40:50.868 --> 04:40:50.878 align:start position:0%
uh uh going back in in you know looking
 
04:40:52.590 --> 04:40:52.600 align:start position:0%
at the E signature Solutions have you
 
04:40:55.150 --> 04:40:55.160 align:start position:0%
looked at things like Panda do or other
 
04:40:57.030 --> 04:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
systems you know you're wondering now
 
04:40:58.670 --> 04:40:58.680 align:start position:0%
that this class of software is
 
04:41:01.190 --> 04:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
established are there cheaper equally
 
04:41:03.190 --> 04:41:03.200 align:start position:0%
highly reliable systems that we could
 
04:41:05.390 --> 04:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
use and get all the benefits that we've
 
04:41:07.788 --> 04:41:07.798 align:start position:0%
had in accelerated Contracting and
 
04:41:10.550 --> 04:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
reduced uh improved staff efficiency in
 
04:41:12.788 --> 04:41:12.798 align:start position:0%
generating cont contracts without
 
04:41:19.510 --> 04:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:23.830 --> 04:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
thanks yeah the sorry yeah the um we're
 
04:41:25.708 --> 04:41:25.718 align:start position:0%
we're always looking to be able to have
 
04:41:27.750 --> 04:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
the best product to be able to do the
 
04:41:29.230 --> 04:41:29.240 align:start position:0%
the uh services that we want to
 
04:41:31.590 --> 04:41:31.600 align:start position:0%
accomplish on there docu sign
 
04:41:34.430 --> 04:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
specifically met that need at uh a very
 
04:41:37.628 --> 04:41:37.638 align:start position:0%
crisis point during our uh covid aspect
 
04:41:39.230 --> 04:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
as one of the one of the leaders to be
 
04:41:42.030 --> 04:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
able to accomplish that but yes as
 
04:41:44.270 --> 04:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
Staffing allows and we're able to put
 
04:41:46.830 --> 04:41:46.840 align:start position:0%
more effort into strategy then we want
 
04:41:49.390 --> 04:41:49.400 align:start position:0%
to be able to innovate and be using the
 
04:41:51.590 --> 04:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
the best products we can I I I I think
 
04:41:53.990 --> 04:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
one important consideration though is
 
04:41:55.750 --> 04:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
when when you build one of these systems
 
04:41:58.070 --> 04:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
I mean building a road is may not may
 
04:42:00.390 --> 04:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
not be the best metaphor but you spent
 
04:42:01.990 --> 04:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
the time to Define your business
 
04:42:03.948 --> 04:42:03.958 align:start position:0%
requirements to work with the work with
 
04:42:06.390 --> 04:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
the the contractor for the solution work
 
04:42:08.350 --> 04:42:08.360 align:start position:0%
with your team to train them and you
 
04:42:10.590 --> 04:42:10.600 align:start position:0%
worked with in the case of docy sign
 
04:42:11.948 --> 04:42:11.958 align:start position:0%
like our vendor and the Attorney
 
04:42:14.110 --> 04:42:14.120 align:start position:0%
General's office and so we've come up
 
04:42:16.070 --> 04:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
with sort of a comprehensive solution
 
04:42:17.628 --> 04:42:17.638 align:start position:0%
that you know didn't happen overnight
 
04:42:21.470 --> 04:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
but um but it and it's also not only in
 
04:42:23.030 --> 04:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
in the contract sphere it's in the
 
04:42:25.390 --> 04:42:25.400 align:start position:0%
public health sphere and working on the
 
04:42:27.590 --> 04:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh division of longterm long-term
 
04:42:30.310 --> 04:42:30.320 align:start position:0%
supports and services sphere so well
 
04:42:32.670 --> 04:42:32.680 align:start position:0%
something may like nominally be cheaper
 
04:42:34.670 --> 04:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
there may be that investment cost
 
04:42:36.230 --> 04:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
upfront as well as your loss
 
04:42:37.830 --> 04:42:37.840 align:start position:0%
productivity cost that you just have to
 
04:42:41.590 --> 04:42:41.600 align:start position:0%
balance out when looking at that
 
04:42:44.708 --> 04:42:44.718 align:start position:0%
and so so I I I I have a homework
 
04:42:48.750 --> 04:42:48.760 align:start position:0%
assignment I think for you on page uh 11
 
04:42:48.760 --> 04:42:49.868 align:start position:0%
assignment I think for you on page uh 11
under

04:42:49.868 --> 04:42:49.878 align:start position:0%
under
 
04:42:49.878 --> 04:42:52.350 align:start position:0%
under
Consultants

04:42:52.350 --> 04:42:52.360 align:start position:0%
Consultants
 
04:42:55.750 --> 04:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
525,000 would would you would you please
 
04:42:58.750 --> 04:42:58.760 align:start position:0%
um break that out for me in terms of the
 
04:43:00.590 --> 04:43:00.600 align:start position:0%
number of hours and what the average
 
04:43:04.190 --> 04:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
hourly price of an hour is sure and and
 
04:43:07.430 --> 04:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
then for a comparison a
 
04:43:13.948 --> 04:43:13.958 align:start position:0%
baseline uh give me a fully load loed uh
 
04:43:17.070 --> 04:43:17.080 align:start position:0%
employed uh employee of the state fully
 
04:43:19.750 --> 04:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
loaded I mean all the benefits in the
 
04:43:24.910 --> 04:43:24.920 align:start position:0%
whole the whole deal uh and what um an
 
04:43:26.868 --> 04:43:26.878 align:start position:0%
an effective hourly rate would be for a
 
04:43:31.990 --> 04:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
wellp paid um employee total cost of
 
04:43:34.510 --> 04:43:34.520 align:start position:0%
that employee yes yes Absolut because I
 
04:43:36.708 --> 04:43:36.718 align:start position:0%
I just want to see what we're what we're
 
04:43:39.150 --> 04:43:39.160 align:start position:0%
trading off when we don't have employees
 
04:43:42.708 --> 04:43:42.718 align:start position:0%
we're we're paying uh consultants and
 
04:43:44.990 --> 04:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
and what I I'd like to understand what
 
04:43:47.350 --> 04:43:47.360 align:start position:0%
tradeoff we're making sure and that
 
04:43:50.350 --> 04:43:50.360 align:start position:0%
makes sense and I think one of the
 
04:43:52.510 --> 04:43:52.520 align:start position:0%
aspects of identifying the consultant
 
04:43:54.550 --> 04:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
Parts here is that it really becomes
 
04:43:57.788 --> 04:43:57.798 align:start position:0%
that ad hoc ability that we not they're
 
04:44:00.270 --> 04:44:00.280 align:start position:0%
not on the payroll all the time right
 
04:44:01.750 --> 04:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
that their ability to be able to stand
 
04:44:03.948 --> 04:44:03.958 align:start position:0%
it in but I'm happy to make that
 
04:44:07.230 --> 04:44:07.240 align:start position:0%
comparison it's an excellent point uh
 
04:44:09.990 --> 04:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
just just remind me of that when you you
 
04:44:13.030 --> 04:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
Pro provide the other data yes sir all
 
04:44:17.110 --> 04:44:17.120 align:start position:0%
right okay any other questions okay do
 
04:44:19.590 --> 04:44:19.600 align:start position:0%
you have any closing thoughts did did we
 
04:44:22.628 --> 04:44:22.638 align:start position:0%
hit everything you you wanted us to hear
 
04:44:24.470 --> 04:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
go I think so and I think you know
 
04:44:27.868 --> 04:44:27.878 align:start position:0%
Nathan had had framed it up we we had
 
04:44:30.590 --> 04:44:30.600 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs we did not submit any
 
04:44:33.150 --> 04:44:33.160 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs here everything we're
 
04:44:35.350 --> 04:44:35.360 align:start position:0%
asking for is a way for us to be you
 
04:44:38.190 --> 04:44:38.200 align:start position:0%
know as we see more efficient productive
 
04:44:40.708 --> 04:44:40.718 align:start position:0%
in what we're accomplishing all right
 
04:44:42.510 --> 04:44:42.520 align:start position:0%
well thank thank you I think facilities
 
04:44:45.670 --> 04:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:49.550 --> 04:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
you and I don't see a a PowerPoint for
 
04:44:52.670 --> 04:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
the facilities is there no PowerPoint is
 
04:44:56.390 --> 04:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
it I I think it's out of order I um I I
 
04:44:57.990 --> 04:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
I I think it ended up getting slid
 
04:45:00.230 --> 04:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
behind office of Health Equity there but
 
04:45:04.430 --> 04:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
on the schedule facilities is next so um
 
04:45:07.628 --> 04:45:07.638 align:start position:0%
once you find the PowerPoint um it it
 
04:45:09.990 --> 04:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
should be labeled it should be in there
 
04:45:13.390 --> 04:45:13.400 align:start position:0%
um there's two account units here and U
 
04:45:15.750 --> 04:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
it begins in the governor's operating
 
04:45:18.550 --> 04:45:18.560 align:start position:0%
budget on page
 
04:45:22.830 --> 04:45:22.840 align:start position:0%
1,57 and the accounting unit is
 
04:45:25.750 --> 04:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
5685 and then there's also a second
 
04:45:27.550 --> 04:45:27.560 align:start position:0%
accounting unit
 
04:45:31.910 --> 04:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
5687 on page 1,58 so they're sequential
 
04:45:33.190 --> 04:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
so they're together so it's a little
 
04:45:36.510 --> 04:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
easier good and then in the budget
 
04:45:40.230 --> 04:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
briefing book um the accounting unit for
 
04:45:45.550 --> 04:45:45.560 align:start position:0%
management report 5685 begins on page
 
04:45:48.150 --> 04:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
26 and the second accounting unit does
 
04:45:50.628 --> 04:45:50.638 align:start position:0%
not have uh an entry in the budget
 
04:45:52.350 --> 04:45:52.360 align:start position:0%
briefing book because it is below a
 
04:45:55.230 --> 04:45:55.240 align:start position:0%
million dollar and with that said I will
 
04:45:56.948 --> 04:45:56.958 align:start position:0%
hand it over to Tammy Nelson our
 
04:45:59.230 --> 04:45:59.240 align:start position:0%
director of
 
04:46:02.510 --> 04:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
facilities so on page 26 it's labeled
 
04:46:04.868 --> 04:46:04.878 align:start position:0%
management support or am I on the wrong
 
04:46:06.190 --> 04:46:06.200 align:start position:0%
page that is
 
04:46:14.470 --> 04:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:17.150 --> 04:46:17.160 align:start position:0%

current budget to include the relocation
 
04:48:54.150 --> 04:48:54.160 align:start position:0%

the geographic layout of the district
 
04:49:23.430 --> 04:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
offices we are um as high up as Berlin
 
04:49:26.230 --> 04:49:26.240 align:start position:0%
um all the way down to
 
04:49:30.430 --> 04:49:30.440 align:start position:0%
nashaa slide nine shows where the 247
 
04:49:32.030 --> 04:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
facilities are
 
04:49:37.430 --> 04:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
located and slide 10 shows um a closer
 
04:49:40.910 --> 04:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
look at our district offices in terms of
 
04:49:47.270 --> 04:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:51.990 --> 04:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
dates and that essentially wraps up the
 
04:49:55.590 --> 04:49:55.600 align:start position:0%
overview okay that's great the the the
 
04:49:57.750 --> 04:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
things I get curious about when I look
 
04:50:02.150 --> 04:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
at facilities is um
 
04:50:06.150 --> 04:50:06.160 align:start position:0%
uh what what are your longer term plans
 
04:50:08.708 --> 04:50:08.718 align:start position:0%
I I I know we we've got to be planning
 
04:50:11.070 --> 04:50:11.080 align:start position:0%
for shutting down and turning over the
 
04:50:14.510 --> 04:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
sonunu Youth Development Center uh I if
 
04:50:16.310 --> 04:50:16.320 align:start position:0%
that's going to if that's going to be
 
04:50:20.150 --> 04:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
completed in this budget cycle then I we
 
04:50:22.030 --> 04:50:22.040 align:start position:0%
I don't need to worry about a budgetary
 
04:50:24.910 --> 04:50:24.920 align:start position:0%
impact not this budget but if we're
 
04:50:27.830 --> 04:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
going to be able to turn over the sonunu
 
04:50:30.708 --> 04:50:30.718 align:start position:0%
Youth Development Center to das that
 
04:50:33.270 --> 04:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
could potentially save the department
 
04:50:36.190 --> 04:50:36.200 align:start position:0%
money in this budget cycle so I I just
 
04:50:39.270 --> 04:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
want to understand timing around
 
04:50:42.190 --> 04:50:42.200 align:start position:0%
turnover plan turn turn over of the senu
 
04:50:43.590 --> 04:50:43.600 align:start position:0%
Youth Development
 
04:50:46.190 --> 04:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
Center so at a at a higher level I'll
 
04:50:47.510 --> 04:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
take that question if that's okay
 
04:50:50.310 --> 04:50:50.320 align:start position:0%
representative sure um so at a high
 
04:50:53.270 --> 04:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
level the Youth Development Center is as
 
04:50:55.788 --> 04:50:55.798 align:start position:0%
we stated earlier I think a week or two
 
04:50:58.708 --> 04:50:58.718 align:start position:0%
ago yeah had Broken Ground over it in
 
04:51:02.750 --> 04:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
Hamstead and is currently on track for
 
04:51:07.548 --> 04:51:07.558 align:start position:0%
being completed or um completed in
 
04:51:10.628 --> 04:51:10.638 align:start position:0%
2026 and then we would need to then
 
04:51:14.670 --> 04:51:14.680 align:start position:0%
occupy so the Occupy OCC occupy and run
 
04:51:18.150 --> 04:51:18.160 align:start position:0%
YDC over at that new location is as we
 
04:51:20.030 --> 04:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
discussed in the previous session
 
04:51:21.788 --> 04:51:21.798 align:start position:0%
dependent on some of the ad alternates
 
04:51:24.628 --> 04:51:24.638 align:start position:0%
that were not funded and would delay our
 
04:51:26.628 --> 04:51:26.638 align:start position:0%
ability to actually operate in that
 
04:51:28.830 --> 04:51:28.840 align:start position:0%
building if we aren't able to obtain the
 
04:51:31.510 --> 04:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
additional funds to in include the
 
04:51:34.910 --> 04:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
cultural Corridor laundry services um
 
04:51:37.910 --> 04:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
cafeteria or food services so so the
 
04:51:40.670 --> 04:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
summary of that is until you understand
 
04:51:42.590 --> 04:51:42.600 align:start position:0%
what your operational budget is for the
 
04:51:46.708 --> 04:51:46.718 align:start position:0%
new center you can't reasonably uh
 
04:51:49.190 --> 04:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
anticipate a closure date of the old
 
04:51:52.030 --> 04:51:52.040 align:start position:0%
suoo center that is a very concise way
 
04:51:55.230 --> 04:51:55.240 align:start position:0%
of saying what I was saying yes Mr chair
 
04:51:59.230 --> 04:51:59.240 align:start position:0%
all right all right uh I understand um
 
04:52:04.270 --> 04:52:04.280 align:start position:0%
and then uh I I want to know when you
 
04:52:08.190 --> 04:52:08.200 align:start position:0%
all are going to present the 10-year
 
04:52:09.190 --> 04:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
plan for
 
04:52:11.628 --> 04:52:11.638 align:start position:0%
glencliffe cuz you know I love Glen
 
04:52:13.910 --> 04:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
Cliffe it's a beautiful resort-like
 
04:52:17.708 --> 04:52:17.718 align:start position:0%
environment uh with 500y old buildings
 
04:52:21.110 --> 04:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
or something like that uh at some point
 
04:52:23.310 --> 04:52:23.320 align:start position:0%
uh it's going to be untenable to be
 
04:52:25.990 --> 04:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
maintaining those buildings and I want
 
04:52:28.868 --> 04:52:28.878 align:start position:0%
to know that we have people paying
 
04:52:32.310 --> 04:52:32.320 align:start position:0%
attention to the escalating cost of
 
04:52:36.350 --> 04:52:36.360 align:start position:0%
Maintenance versus the building of new I
 
04:52:39.310 --> 04:52:39.320 align:start position:0%
I I I I just would like to know I don't
 
04:52:41.270 --> 04:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
want the answer in this budget cycle
 
04:52:43.590 --> 04:52:43.600 align:start position:0%
because the answer doesn't impact this
 
04:52:46.150 --> 04:52:46.160 align:start position:0%
budget cycle I don't think maybe there's
 
04:52:47.628 --> 04:52:47.638 align:start position:0%
some maintenance cost when we get to
 
04:52:51.070 --> 04:52:51.080 align:start position:0%
Glen Cliffe but but we we really need to
 
04:52:52.990 --> 04:52:53.000 align:start position:0%
we really need to understand what the
 
04:52:55.030 --> 04:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
long-term plan is for Glen Cliffe we
 
04:52:57.110 --> 04:52:57.120 align:start position:0%
can't just assume we're going to be
 
04:52:59.788 --> 04:52:59.798 align:start position:0%
operating at another 20 years I don't
 
04:53:02.948 --> 04:53:02.958 align:start position:0%
think so so for the current bium uh Glen
 
04:53:05.310 --> 04:53:05.320 align:start position:0%
Cliff has been funded at approximately
 
04:53:11.150 --> 04:53:11.160 align:start position:0%
the the the 75 census um uh patient
 
04:53:13.310 --> 04:53:13.320 align:start position:0%
patient census um I I I think that's a
 
04:53:15.110 --> 04:53:15.120 align:start position:0%
much larger more comprehensive
 
04:53:17.310 --> 04:53:17.320 align:start position:0%
conversation well in advance of
 
04:53:19.628 --> 04:53:19.638 align:start position:0%
facilities I think if if we're to
 
04:53:21.670 --> 04:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
discuss that further I'd like to have um
 
04:53:23.750 --> 04:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
Ellen Le Point here the CEO of New
 
04:53:25.788 --> 04:53:25.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital who helps over who
 
04:53:28.190 --> 04:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
oversees Glen Cliffe but I think that's
 
04:53:30.430 --> 04:53:30.440 align:start position:0%
a much broader conversation than just
 
04:53:32.510 --> 04:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
facilities it absolutely is and so
 
04:53:34.470 --> 04:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm just asking when can we
 
04:53:36.390 --> 04:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
start to expect to hear what the
 
04:53:39.628 --> 04:53:39.638 align:start position:0%
Department's plan is I you guys can have
 
04:53:41.590 --> 04:53:41.600 align:start position:0%
all the conversation you want I just
 
04:53:43.990 --> 04:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
want to know when we could start to
 
04:53:45.750 --> 04:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
expect to you know hear what you're
 
04:53:48.750 --> 04:53:48.760 align:start position:0%
thinking is about the lot the the the
 
04:53:51.070 --> 04:53:51.080 align:start position:0%
life cycle of Glen Cliffe and the
 
04:53:53.310 --> 04:53:53.320 align:start position:0%
replacement I I don't need to have an
 
04:53:56.110 --> 04:53:56.120 align:start position:0%
opinion I'm just curious when you guys
 
04:53:57.430 --> 04:53:57.440 align:start position:0%
will have one
 
04:54:02.430 --> 04:54:02.440 align:start position:0%
developed um not today no um and again I
 
04:54:03.590 --> 04:54:03.600 align:start position:0%
I I think it's a much broader
 
04:54:05.628 --> 04:54:05.638 align:start position:0%
conversation not really prepared to
 
04:54:07.390 --> 04:54:07.400 align:start position:0%
discuss today
 
04:54:11.830 --> 04:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
okay um so uh I I I'm not prepared to
 
04:54:14.190 --> 04:54:14.200 align:start position:0%
ask questions about the the the line
 
04:54:16.670 --> 04:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
item budget are there questions from the
 
04:54:20.070 --> 04:54:20.080 align:start position:0%
members um uh go ahead representative
 
04:54:23.750 --> 04:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
priest I just wanted to commend um the
 
04:54:26.830 --> 04:54:26.840 align:start position:0%
director of facilities you do an amazing
 
04:54:31.470 --> 04:54:31.480 align:start position:0%
job of of the facilities that we own and
 
04:54:34.070 --> 04:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
operate uh a group of us went to Glen
 
04:54:37.948 --> 04:54:37.958 align:start position:0%
cliff last spring and considering how
 
04:54:40.788 --> 04:54:40.798 align:start position:0%
old the facility is and it's still an
 
04:54:43.670 --> 04:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
operation but yet you're managing to
 
04:54:47.910 --> 04:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
keep it going it's amazing thank you so
 
04:54:50.548 --> 04:54:50.558 align:start position:0%
much thank
 
04:54:55.150 --> 04:54:55.160 align:start position:0%
you that's all true I agree I I
 
04:54:58.470 --> 04:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
um I do now have another question though
 
04:55:00.590 --> 04:55:00.600 align:start position:0%
with with the way the corporate world is
 
04:55:03.750 --> 04:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
going uh as as people do more remote
 
04:55:06.750 --> 04:55:06.760 align:start position:0%
work is there's consolidation
 
04:55:09.150 --> 04:55:09.160 align:start position:0%
opportunities do you do you see any
 
04:55:11.830 --> 04:55:11.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity if not in this budget cycle
 
04:55:15.310 --> 04:55:15.320 align:start position:0%
but a a upcoming one where we ought to
 
04:55:17.788 --> 04:55:17.798 align:start position:0%
be doing a serious condol consolidation
 
04:55:22.830 --> 04:55:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:26.190 --> 04:55:26.200 align:start position:0%
footprint I'd like to defer that to Dave
 
04:55:29.670 --> 04:55:29.680 align:start position:0%
please sure so actually we have been
 
04:55:31.708 --> 04:55:31.718 align:start position:0%
doing that since covid time so Public
 
04:55:33.910 --> 04:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
Health um was the sort of the champion
 
04:55:36.948 --> 04:55:36.958 align:start position:0%
for that so they would have about 30 to
 
04:55:39.390 --> 04:55:39.400 align:start position:0%
50% of their staff remote at any given
 
04:55:42.708 --> 04:55:42.718 align:start position:0%
time so we do a hoteling is what I call
 
04:55:45.708 --> 04:55:45.718 align:start position:0%
it where there's shared workspaces and
 
04:55:48.310 --> 04:55:48.320 align:start position:0%
they they LED that way and then as we
 
04:55:50.548 --> 04:55:50.558 align:start position:0%
move forward we are doing that in
 
04:55:53.548 --> 04:55:53.558 align:start position:0%
Information Services in conjunction with
 
04:55:55.910 --> 04:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
um economic stability where we Hotel
 
04:55:58.628 --> 04:55:58.638 align:start position:0%
space in Brown building so that we
 
04:56:00.868 --> 04:56:00.878 align:start position:0%
didn't when we actually were moved out
 
04:56:03.708 --> 04:56:03.718 align:start position:0%
of the South Street location and
 
04:56:05.470 --> 04:56:05.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections moved in we
 
04:56:07.150 --> 04:56:07.160 align:start position:0%
didn't need to go out and Lease
 
04:56:09.230 --> 04:56:09.240 align:start position:0%
additional building space and we were
 
04:56:11.430 --> 04:56:11.440 align:start position:0%
able to reuse of the space within Brown
 
04:56:13.868 --> 04:56:13.878 align:start position:0%
building so we are looking in that at
 
04:56:16.788 --> 04:56:16.798 align:start position:0%
that as an opportunity um especially
 
04:56:18.110 --> 04:56:18.120 align:start position:0%
when there's deferred maintenance on
 
04:56:20.150 --> 04:56:20.160 align:start position:0%
buildings that administrative Services
 
04:56:22.110 --> 04:56:22.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't always get the funding for that
 
04:56:24.390 --> 04:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
they need we're looking to see how we
 
04:56:26.628 --> 04:56:26.638 align:start position:0%
can do that as we go forward and one of
 
04:56:28.590 --> 04:56:28.600 align:start position:0%
the things that we also did is
 
04:56:31.070 --> 04:56:31.080 align:start position:0%
consolidating our warehouse space we had
 
04:56:33.110 --> 04:56:33.120 align:start position:0%
two warehouses we're now down to one
 
04:56:35.868 --> 04:56:35.878 align:start position:0%
through this budget um so we are
 
04:56:37.390 --> 04:56:37.400 align:start position:0%
constantly looking at our space
 
04:56:39.670 --> 04:56:39.680 align:start position:0%
utilization so then you probably also

04:59:22.190 --> 04:59:22.200 align:start position:0%
um um so the first accounting unit
 
04:59:25.230 --> 04:59:25.240 align:start position:0%

04:59:28.830 --> 04:59:28.840 align:start position:0%
briefing book and the second begins on

12 and with that I will hand it over to
 
04:59:42.590 --> 04:59:42.600 align:start position:0%
Ruben Hampton our
 
04:59:45.270 --> 04:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
director good afternoon I'm Ruben
 
04:59:46.910 --> 04:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
Hampton the director of the office of
 
04:59:49.390 --> 04:59:49.400 align:start position:0%
Health Equity I'll be taking you through
 
04:59:52.270 --> 04:59:52.280 align:start position:0%
the office's Mission uh some of the key
 
04:59:54.230 --> 04:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
outcomes at a high level if we achieve
 
04:59:57.390 --> 04:59:57.400 align:start position:0%
that mission and uh key accomplishments
 
05:00:02.830 --> 05:00:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:05.868 --> 05:00:05.878 align:start position:0%
chart the mission of the office is to
 
05:00:08.270 --> 05:00:08.280 align:start position:0%
identify and mitigate Health disparities
 
05:00:10.788 --> 05:00:10.798 align:start position:0%
for all of New Hampshire that's on page
 
05:00:15.190 --> 05:00:15.200 align:start position:0%
two and if you flip that to page three
 
05:00:18.628 --> 05:00:18.638 align:start position:0%
uh you'd see that for a key outcome
 
05:00:21.910 --> 05:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
number one it would be that uh all folks
 
05:00:23.750 --> 05:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
in the state would have Equitable access
 
05:00:26.510 --> 05:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
to the programs and services of the
 
05:00:29.548 --> 05:00:29.558 align:start position:0%
department one way we would make that
 
05:00:31.510 --> 05:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
happen is by ensuring that the
 
05:00:34.270 --> 05:00:34.280 align:start position:0%
department all of its Partners all the
 
05:00:36.470 --> 05:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
vendors all the community organizations
 
05:00:38.788 --> 05:00:38.798 align:start position:0%
that we work with are providing cultur
 
05:00:41.350 --> 05:00:41.360 align:start position:0%
linguistically appropriate services and
 
05:00:44.310 --> 05:00:44.320 align:start position:0%
whether that's policies procedures the
 
05:00:46.868 --> 05:00:46.878 align:start position:0%
actual interpreters translation services
 
05:00:48.628 --> 05:00:48.638 align:start position:0%
themselves and not just for compliance
 
05:00:50.750 --> 05:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
reasons which are important but also so
 
05:00:53.390 --> 05:00:53.400 align:start position:0%
we can provide more effective services
 
05:00:55.470 --> 05:00:55.480 align:start position:0%
to those that we
 
05:00:59.390 --> 05:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
serve if you move to the next slide
 
05:01:02.110 --> 05:01:02.120 align:start position:0%
slide four there's also the community
 
05:01:03.270 --> 05:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
outreach and
 
05:01:06.990 --> 05:01:07.000 align:start position:0%
engagement portion to make sure that we
 
05:01:09.190 --> 05:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
as a department are staying engaged with
 
05:01:11.390 --> 05:01:11.400 align:start position:0%
Community State holders at the office we
 
05:01:13.670 --> 05:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
try to build relationships with folks
 
05:01:15.910 --> 05:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
across the state from all different
 
05:01:18.110 --> 05:01:18.120 align:start position:0%
backgrounds uh it's important that
 
05:01:19.788 --> 05:01:19.798 align:start position:0%
whether it's different divisions groups
 
05:01:21.788 --> 05:01:21.798 align:start position:0%
subgroups when they there are programs
 
05:01:24.270 --> 05:01:24.280 align:start position:0%
and services are able to work with
 
05:01:26.270 --> 05:01:26.280 align:start position:0%
different parts of the community uh get
 
05:01:28.830 --> 05:01:28.840 align:start position:0%
their input get their participation as
 
05:01:31.270 --> 05:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
needed as appropriate and we try to
 
05:01:34.190 --> 05:01:34.200 align:start position:0%
facilitate those relationships on the
 
05:01:36.030 --> 05:01:36.040 align:start position:0%
flip side of that it's also important
 
05:01:38.430 --> 05:01:38.440 align:start position:0%
that Community voice be involved with
 
05:01:40.470 --> 05:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
these programs that you know are
 
05:01:42.628 --> 05:01:42.638 align:start position:0%
designed to serve them as well as the
 
05:01:45.110 --> 05:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
development of new
 
05:01:49.270 --> 05:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
programs and for the refugee program
 
05:01:52.070 --> 05:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
specifically there are some high level
 
05:01:53.990 --> 05:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
goals from the federal government but
 
05:01:56.110 --> 05:01:56.120 align:start position:0%
overall we want to ensure that folks are
 
05:01:58.910 --> 05:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
able to get settled here integrated and
 
05:02:01.350 --> 05:02:01.360 align:start position:0%
achieve self-sufficiency in addition to
 
05:02:03.910 --> 05:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
if they have kids get those folks in
 
05:02:07.990 --> 05:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
school uh provide on the job training
 
05:02:09.990 --> 05:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
and also receive any necessary
 
05:02:12.708 --> 05:02:12.718 align:start position:0%
Healthcare treatment and screening up
 
05:02:15.150 --> 05:02:15.160 align:start position:0%
front so I'm I'm going to ask you a
 
05:02:19.270 --> 05:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
question there I I I was um I was in
 
05:02:22.150 --> 05:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
Afghanistan for a year and interacted
 
05:02:24.590 --> 05:02:24.600 align:start position:0%
directly with that population and I know
 
05:02:27.310 --> 05:02:27.320 align:start position:0%
that from a refugee perspective we
 
05:02:29.590 --> 05:02:29.600 align:start position:0%
brought in at one point I think the
 
05:02:31.590 --> 05:02:31.600 align:start position:0%
count was 120 I don't know what the
 
05:02:35.150 --> 05:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
total count is as of now maybe you could
 
05:02:38.470 --> 05:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
tell me the Afghan population But but so
 
05:02:40.830 --> 05:02:40.840 align:start position:0%
my concern having having interacted with
 
05:02:43.590 --> 05:02:43.600 align:start position:0%
that culture on their ground and their
 
05:02:46.910 --> 05:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
turf was that
 
05:02:51.628 --> 05:02:51.638 align:start position:0%
uh relative to us standards there was a
 
05:02:53.708 --> 05:02:53.718 align:start position:0%
a huge amount of work that could be done
 
05:02:56.510 --> 05:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
or maybe ought to be done to make sure
 
05:02:59.190 --> 05:02:59.200 align:start position:0%
that women were were fully integrated
 
05:03:02.070 --> 05:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
into society and that they were able to
 
05:03:03.830 --> 05:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
go to school they were able to play
 
05:03:06.910 --> 05:03:06.920 align:start position:0%
sports they were able to get uh good
 
05:03:09.868 --> 05:03:09.878 align:start position:0%
access to health care you know uh can
 
05:03:11.910 --> 05:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
you can you speak I'm not asking for
 
05:03:14.270 --> 05:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
names or personal identifying data of
 
05:03:17.750 --> 05:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
any kind but I I'd like to understand
 
05:03:21.548 --> 05:03:21.558 align:start position:0%
your perspective on how good a job we've
 
05:03:24.310 --> 05:03:24.320 align:start position:0%
been doing at the cultural integration
 
05:03:27.150 --> 05:03:27.160 align:start position:0%
of the Afghan
 
05:03:29.788 --> 05:03:29.798 align:start position:0%
refugees there's been a lot of work to
 
05:03:33.390 --> 05:03:33.400 align:start position:0%
ensure this comes from we partner with
 
05:03:36.868 --> 05:03:36.878 align:start position:0%
now five different vendors for Refugee
 
05:03:38.470 --> 05:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
Services broadly two resettlement
 
05:03:41.150 --> 05:03:41.160 align:start position:0%
agencies three other service providers
 
05:03:43.390 --> 05:03:43.400 align:start position:0%
who all would work with uh different
 
05:03:45.628 --> 05:03:45.638 align:start position:0%
groups and whether that's trying to
 
05:03:47.590 --> 05:03:47.600 align:start position:0%
ensure that from Pure linguistic
 
05:03:52.270 --> 05:03:52.280 align:start position:0%
standpoint we provide uh interpreters or
 
05:03:55.430 --> 05:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
service providers that speak uh the
 
05:03:57.470 --> 05:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
different Native languages that are uh
 
05:04:02.190 --> 05:04:02.200 align:start position:0%
Afghani refugees or sivs or other folks
 
05:04:05.190 --> 05:04:05.200 align:start position:0%
that are coming over speak that they
 
05:04:07.430 --> 05:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
have folks that they want to work with
 
05:04:10.628 --> 05:04:10.638 align:start position:0%
that uh are able to understand their
 
05:04:13.750 --> 05:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
culture uh the agencies have invested in
 
05:04:16.030 --> 05:04:16.040 align:start position:0%
that staff they also spend extensive
 
05:04:18.990 --> 05:04:19.000 align:start position:0%
time with the families I've personally
 
05:04:21.830 --> 05:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
aware of a couple different family
 
05:04:25.070 --> 05:04:25.080 align:start position:0%
situations where the office and the
 
05:04:27.030 --> 05:04:27.040 align:start position:0%
retem agency have partnered together to
 
05:04:29.868 --> 05:04:29.878 align:start position:0%
meet the needs of families to ensure
 
05:04:31.830 --> 05:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
that they're happy whether that means
 
05:04:33.350 --> 05:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
that they are in New Hampshire or they
 
05:04:35.910 --> 05:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
out migrate to a different state as well
 
05:04:38.310 --> 05:04:38.320 align:start position:0%
so there has been substantial investment
 
05:04:40.470 --> 05:04:40.480 align:start position:0%
to ensure that there is cult integration
 
05:04:42.150 --> 05:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
and that they are meeting the needs of
 
05:04:44.788 --> 05:04:44.798 align:start position:0%
their families because I I just I need
 
05:04:46.670 --> 05:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
to interrupt you just for a second
 
05:04:48.190 --> 05:04:48.200 align:start position:0%
you're you're doing a great job of
 
05:04:50.470 --> 05:04:50.480 align:start position:0%
telling me what we're doing my question
 
05:04:51.990 --> 05:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
was how are we
 
05:04:55.590 --> 05:04:55.600 align:start position:0%
doing are are we doing are are have we
 
05:04:58.110 --> 05:04:58.120 align:start position:0%
achieved what we consider to be success
 
05:05:00.628 --> 05:05:00.638 align:start position:0%
in terms of the successful cultural
 
05:05:03.548 --> 05:05:03.558 align:start position:0%
integration of the Afghan population yes
 
05:05:03.558 --> 05:05:04.590 align:start position:0%
integration of the Afghan population yes
or

05:05:04.590 --> 05:05:04.600 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:05:07.590 --> 05:05:07.600 align:start position:0%
no or it's not really a yes or no but
 
05:05:09.868 --> 05:05:09.878 align:start position:0%
I'd like to hear more about the h how
 
05:05:12.868 --> 05:05:12.878 align:start position:0%
are we doing and not what are we doing
 
05:05:14.830 --> 05:05:14.840 align:start position:0%
my understanding is as well as it can be
 
05:05:16.910 --> 05:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
expected given the circumstances you
 
05:05:19.350 --> 05:05:19.360 align:start position:0%
have a lot of folks who you know came
 
05:05:23.430 --> 05:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
over under duress to say the least and
 
05:05:25.070 --> 05:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
you know coming over to a brand new
 
05:05:29.030 --> 05:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
country but it is going as well as can
 
05:05:31.788 --> 05:05:31.798 align:start position:0%
be expected and them coming here having
 
05:05:34.830 --> 05:05:34.840 align:start position:0%
to start a whole new life and uh being
 
05:05:36.830 --> 05:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
able to integrate into society to get
 
05:05:39.190 --> 05:05:39.200 align:start position:0%
jobs to get their kids into schools to
 
05:05:41.708 --> 05:05:41.718 align:start position:0%
get house housing I'm particularly
 
05:05:44.548 --> 05:05:44.558 align:start position:0%
concerned about are are we helping to
 
05:05:47.510 --> 05:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
make sure that the women are enjoying
 
05:05:49.788 --> 05:05:49.798 align:start position:0%
American freedoms and
 
05:05:51.948 --> 05:05:51.958 align:start position:0%
opportunity there have
 
05:05:55.510 --> 05:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
been for my specific knowledge
 
05:05:57.670 --> 05:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
that workers for the individual
 
05:06:01.430 --> 05:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
resettlement agencies for uh folks from
 
05:06:04.070 --> 05:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
the office have met with individual
 
05:06:05.868 --> 05:06:05.878 align:start position:0%
family members as well to ensure that
 
05:06:08.150 --> 05:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
their needs are met so from my
 
05:06:10.788 --> 05:06:10.798 align:start position:0%
understanding that is true
 
05:06:14.190 --> 05:06:14.200 align:start position:0%
do do you want to add to that
 
05:06:16.670 --> 05:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner good afternoon an Le Andrew
 
05:06:18.270 --> 05:06:18.280 align:start position:0%
associate commissioner thank you um
 
05:06:20.830 --> 05:06:20.840 align:start position:0%
chairman Edwards I I would reiterate
 
05:06:23.590 --> 05:06:23.600 align:start position:0%
what Ruben is saying I do remember us
 
05:06:25.750 --> 05:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
discussing this I think two years ago
 
05:06:27.708 --> 05:06:27.718 align:start position:0%
maybe at the last by a.m and and with
 
05:06:29.590 --> 05:06:29.600 align:start position:0%
some of our acceptance accepts and
 
05:06:32.990 --> 05:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
expends along the way um we're lucky
 
05:06:35.830 --> 05:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
that you know the the two resettlement
 
05:06:38.030 --> 05:06:38.040 align:start position:0%
two primary resettlement agencies here
 
05:06:40.470 --> 05:06:40.480 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire are are belong to the
 
05:06:43.830 --> 05:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
you know nine nine national federal
 
05:06:46.070 --> 05:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
resettlement agencies and these
 
05:06:47.750 --> 05:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
organizations are well equipped to do
 
05:06:50.990 --> 05:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
that work to integrate any you know any
 
05:06:54.510 --> 05:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
Refugee um who comes to the US they hire
 
05:06:56.270 --> 05:06:56.280 align:start position:0%
as Ruben said they hire they invest in
 
05:06:58.590 --> 05:06:58.600 align:start position:0%
it and and we have no reason to believe
 
05:07:00.788 --> 05:07:00.798 align:start position:0%
that they're not s being successful in
 
05:07:04.070 --> 05:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
that today and I I think um part of that
 
05:07:05.430 --> 05:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
sorry if I can just finish I didn't mean
 
05:07:08.110 --> 05:07:08.120 align:start position:0%
to interrupt is um is looking at what
 
05:07:11.070 --> 05:07:11.080 align:start position:0%
are those cultural comp competencies
 
05:07:13.230 --> 05:07:13.240 align:start position:0%
that the families um and the communities
 
05:07:15.628 --> 05:07:15.638 align:start position:0%
need to integrate those families and and
 
05:07:18.190 --> 05:07:18.200 align:start position:0%
for your example here um how that may
 
05:07:20.350 --> 05:07:20.360 align:start position:0%
different from their home country here
 
05:07:23.910 --> 05:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
in America so yeah right yes do do do we
 
05:07:27.750 --> 05:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
have performance metrics that inform our
 
05:07:32.990 --> 05:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
own people uh on how well we're doing as
 
05:07:35.670 --> 05:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
opposed to Counting what we're doing
 
05:07:38.390 --> 05:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
because I think that would be easy I I
 
05:07:41.510 --> 05:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
want to know how we're doing do we have
 
05:07:43.910 --> 05:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
performance measure measurements to tell
 
05:07:45.548 --> 05:07:45.558 align:start position:0%
us how we're
 
05:07:48.230 --> 05:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
doing the federal program has very
 
05:07:50.708 --> 05:07:50.718 align:start position:0%
specific metrics that we must keep track
 
05:07:53.670 --> 05:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
of and report on that are it's a more
 
05:07:55.670 --> 05:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
performance-based they don't necessarily
 
05:07:57.430 --> 05:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
speak to some of the cultural aspects
 
05:07:59.948 --> 05:07:59.958 align:start position:0%
that you're talking about we certainly
 
05:08:01.948 --> 05:08:01.958 align:start position:0%
keep track of and take very seriously
 
05:08:04.190 --> 05:08:04.200 align:start position:0%
any feedback we do get from clients
 
05:08:06.230 --> 05:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
individual family members and
 
05:08:08.390 --> 05:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
investigate those followup with vendors
 
05:08:10.430 --> 05:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
to ensure that needs are being met
 
05:08:12.670 --> 05:08:12.680 align:start position:0%
whether they're from our Afghan clients
 
05:08:14.830 --> 05:08:14.840 align:start position:0%
or other and that has happened in the
 
05:08:17.868 --> 05:08:17.878 align:start position:0%
past and we absolutely do follow up so
 
05:08:20.910 --> 05:08:20.920 align:start position:0%
I'm most familiar with the Afghans uh
 
05:08:24.110 --> 05:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
what what other significant in terms of
 
05:08:28.110 --> 05:08:28.120 align:start position:0%
numbers ref Refugee populations have we
 
05:08:31.990 --> 05:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
welcomed to New Hampshire and are do do
 
05:08:34.470 --> 05:08:34.480 align:start position:0%
we have any uh cultural integration
 
05:08:39.548 --> 05:08:39.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:41.350 --> 05:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
there's been nothing to my knowledge
 
05:08:43.708 --> 05:08:43.718 align:start position:0%
answer your second question first uh
 
05:08:46.270 --> 05:08:46.280 align:start position:0%
that have been unexpect in terms of
 
05:08:48.190 --> 05:08:48.200 align:start position:0%
cultural integration issues again as
 
05:08:50.708 --> 05:08:50.718 align:start position:0%
people are coming over from a new
 
05:08:53.628 --> 05:08:53.638 align:start position:0%
country under duress uh in terms of
 
05:08:56.548 --> 05:08:56.558 align:start position:0%
larger populations the largest have been
 
05:08:59.750 --> 05:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
the humanitarian PES from Ukraine have
 
05:09:03.150 --> 05:09:03.160 align:start position:0%
been a larger population uh Afghans
 
05:09:05.868 --> 05:09:05.878 align:start position:0%
previously not as much currently were a
 
05:09:09.510 --> 05:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
larger population and the rest not NE
 
05:09:12.628 --> 05:09:12.638 align:start position:0%
particular outliers we've had a somewhat
 
05:09:15.430 --> 05:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
larger population from the DRC but
 
05:09:17.868 --> 05:09:17.878 align:start position:0%
that's uh relative not necessarily as
 
05:09:20.510 --> 05:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
high as DRC uh Democratic Republic of
 
05:09:23.030 --> 05:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
Congo okay thank you and but we have not
 
05:09:24.868 --> 05:09:24.878 align:start position:0%
had that's not at the same relative
 
05:09:29.868 --> 05:09:29.878 align:start position:0%
scale as Afghanistan or Ukraine did did
 
05:09:32.190 --> 05:09:32.200 align:start position:0%
I see a statistic that said that we have
 
05:09:34.990 --> 05:09:35.000 align:start position:0%
over 7,000 refugees currently living in
 
05:09:37.830 --> 05:09:37.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire like 7200 or
 
05:09:40.030 --> 05:09:40.040 align:start position:0%
something do you do you do you know the
 
05:09:42.310 --> 05:09:42.320 align:start position:0%
total number of refugees that we we have
 
05:09:44.150 --> 05:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire I'd have to get back to
 
05:09:46.868 --> 05:09:46.878 align:start position:0%
you with that data to confirm how many
 
05:09:48.190 --> 05:09:48.200 align:start position:0%
are living in the state because a lot of
 
05:09:50.868 --> 05:09:50.878 align:start position:0%
folks out migrate as well right we we
 
05:09:53.470 --> 05:09:53.480 align:start position:0%
track you know who arrives into the
 
05:09:55.628 --> 05:09:55.638 align:start position:0%
state year by year I would have to get
 
05:09:57.430 --> 05:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
back to you on how many are currently in
 
05:09:59.470 --> 05:09:59.480 align:start position:0%
the state we don't the number that
 
05:10:02.030 --> 05:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
arrive is in the low hundreds it's not
 
05:10:04.390 --> 05:10:04.400 align:start position:0%
in the thousands so that okay and I'll
 
05:10:06.868 --> 05:10:06.878 align:start position:0%
go to representative priest next but I I
 
05:10:11.070 --> 05:10:11.080 align:start position:0%
um and then do we have any uh
 
05:10:15.110 --> 05:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
in insight into a new pipeline of
 
05:10:17.750 --> 05:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
refugees we might be expecting are we
 
05:10:19.670 --> 05:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
are with the new Administration are we
 
05:10:22.350 --> 05:10:22.360 align:start position:0%
getting any sort of communication on
 
05:10:25.270 --> 05:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
what sort of uh Refugee resettlement we
 
05:10:26.910 --> 05:10:26.920 align:start position:0%
may be looking at in the next year or
 
05:10:29.150 --> 05:10:29.160 align:start position:0%
two the current Administration has put a
 
05:10:31.270 --> 05:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
four-month hold on reception and
 
05:10:34.070 --> 05:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
placement for refugees specifically so
 
05:10:35.750 --> 05:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
those who would have Refugee status so
 
05:10:39.110 --> 05:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
there are not any refugees coming over
 
05:10:39.120 --> 05:10:39.868 align:start position:0%
there are not any refugees coming over
uh

05:10:39.868 --> 05:10:39.878 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:10:43.230 --> 05:10:43.240 align:start position:0%
they've also attempted to do something
 
05:10:46.590 --> 05:10:46.600 align:start position:0%
similar for humanitarian peoes you do
 
05:10:48.548 --> 05:10:48.558 align:start position:0%
have some with special immigrant Visas
 
05:10:50.990 --> 05:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
so sivs so actually some folks from
 
05:10:53.788 --> 05:10:53.798 align:start position:0%
Afghanistan have come over but they've
 
05:10:56.070 --> 05:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
there's been a significant drop off you
 
05:10:57.350 --> 05:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
may have seen in the news that there
 
05:11:00.628 --> 05:11:00.638 align:start position:0%
were uh some Afghan refugees and sivs on
 
05:11:02.510 --> 05:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
a flight that was supposed to come over
 
05:11:04.350 --> 05:11:04.360 align:start position:0%
that was cancelled right so there's been
 
05:11:06.910 --> 05:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
a a significant drop off okay
 
05:11:06.920 --> 05:11:08.230 align:start position:0%
a a significant drop off okay
representative

05:11:08.230 --> 05:11:08.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:11:11.150 --> 05:11:11.160 align:start position:0%
priest thank you Mr chairman again on a
 
05:11:14.070 --> 05:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
as a continuation from what
 
05:11:17.070 --> 05:11:17.080 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards has talked about
 
05:11:19.510 --> 05:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
just recently um I think it would be
 
05:11:22.948 --> 05:11:22.958 align:start position:0%
very helpful if we could get a table of
 
05:11:26.470 --> 05:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
all the refugees that you have service
 
05:11:29.470 --> 05:11:29.480 align:start position:0%
within the last five years and their
 
05:11:34.030 --> 05:11:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:36.390 --> 05:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you representative
 
05:11:38.190 --> 05:11:38.200 align:start position:0%
clarifying question when you say there's
 
05:11:40.788 --> 05:11:40.798 align:start position:0%
status uh if they're still living in the
 
05:11:44.470 --> 05:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
state or if they've uh migrated out
 
05:11:47.190 --> 05:11:47.200 align:start position:0%
understood I I I will see what we we're
 
05:11:48.948 --> 05:11:48.958 align:start position:0%
able to provide that would be great
 
05:11:50.628 --> 05:11:50.638 align:start position:0%
thank you so much and and with that
 
05:11:51.948 --> 05:11:51.958 align:start position:0%
there are other groups like you
 
05:11:53.708 --> 05:11:53.718 align:start position:0%
mentioned that there's a category on
 
05:11:57.030 --> 05:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
humanitarian and the like I'll interpret
 
05:11:59.830 --> 05:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
Refugee as the broad Refugee term when
 
05:12:01.510 --> 05:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
you when you say that like humanitarian
 
05:12:04.150 --> 05:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
proles refugees the generally the folks
 
05:12:07.070 --> 05:12:07.080 align:start position:0%
of or office of refugee resettlement
 
05:12:09.390 --> 05:12:09.400 align:start position:0%
eligible population folks that we serve
 
05:12:11.270 --> 05:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
out outstanding thank you representative
 
05:12:14.470 --> 05:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
nalo and then representative torki yes
 
05:12:17.788 --> 05:12:17.798 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh Mr Hampton for taking
 
05:12:20.430 --> 05:12:20.440 align:start position:0%
taking the questions back to to page
 
05:12:23.788 --> 05:12:23.798 align:start position:0%
three and your handouts I'm wondering if
 
05:12:27.230 --> 05:12:27.240 align:start position:0%
you could provide a distinction between
 
05:12:32.708 --> 05:12:32.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:35.350 --> 05:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
Equitable General distinction there is
 
05:12:38.510 --> 05:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
that uh you wouldn't equal has an
 
05:12:41.390 --> 05:12:41.400 align:start position:0%
implication sometimes of providing the
 
05:12:41.400 --> 05:12:42.948 align:start position:0%
implication sometimes of providing the
same

05:12:42.948 --> 05:12:42.958 align:start position:0%
same
 
05:12:48.750 --> 05:12:48.760 align:start position:0%
uh solution for every person uh
 
05:12:51.190 --> 05:12:51.200 align:start position:0%
Equitable often has the implication of
 
05:12:54.788 --> 05:12:54.798 align:start position:0%
providing uh what each person needs
 
05:12:57.830 --> 05:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
right for example you may have someone
 
05:12:59.510 --> 05:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh from a disability perspective who
 
05:13:02.270 --> 05:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
needs a specific solution versus someone
 
05:13:04.350 --> 05:13:04.360 align:start position:0%
who does not you would inly provide them
 
05:13:07.510 --> 05:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
with these same solution yeah that that
 
05:13:09.270 --> 05:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
actually wasn't my question because this
 
05:13:11.830 --> 05:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
is related to access and I think that's
 
05:13:14.430 --> 05:13:14.440 align:start position:0%
a you've answered a a different question
 
05:13:17.110 --> 05:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
so I always thought that our goal and
 
05:13:21.788 --> 05:13:21.798 align:start position:0%
objective was equal equal access and I'm
 
05:13:23.628 --> 05:13:23.638 align:start position:0%
not sure I understand how that
 
05:13:31.150 --> 05:13:31.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:34.830 --> 05:13:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:37.750 --> 05:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
case irrespective of the the the
 
05:13:40.270 --> 05:13:40.280 align:start position:0%
difference between the to the the goal
 
05:13:42.750 --> 05:13:42.760 align:start position:0%
is to ensure that regardless of their
 
05:13:44.750 --> 05:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
particular circumstances whether you
 
05:13:46.470 --> 05:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
know the person has a disability where
 
05:13:48.548 --> 05:13:48.558 align:start position:0%
they're located in the state regardless
 
05:13:51.470 --> 05:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
of their income they're Etc they're able
 
05:13:54.990 --> 05:13:55.000 align:start position:0%
to access the Department's Services uh
 
05:13:58.070 --> 05:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
in the same way that any other person
 
05:14:03.430 --> 05:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:06.270 --> 05:14:06.280 align:start position:0%
Equitable okay thank you representative
 
05:14:10.670 --> 05:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
torki and then represent sew thank you
 
05:14:12.868 --> 05:14:12.878 align:start position:0%
very much I want to commend your very
 
05:14:15.390 --> 05:14:15.400 align:start position:0%
small staff and what is probably a huge
 
05:14:18.430 --> 05:14:18.440 align:start position:0%
impact on this um group of people who
 
05:14:20.788 --> 05:14:20.798 align:start position:0%
come here in are very unique situation
 
05:14:22.670 --> 05:14:22.680 align:start position:0%
so thank you for that um I may have
 
05:14:23.750 --> 05:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
jumped ahead a little bit but I'm
 
05:14:25.830 --> 05:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
looking at the key accomplishments of
 
05:14:28.868 --> 05:14:28.878 align:start position:0%
your group and what caught my eye was
 
05:14:33.070 --> 05:14:33.080 align:start position:0%
the bottom of page seven where it talks
 
05:14:34.990 --> 05:14:35.000 align:start position:0%
about employment now we all know we have
 
05:14:38.670 --> 05:14:38.680 align:start position:0%
a Workforce crisis here in our state um
 
05:14:41.590 --> 05:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
and I've seen many uh economists sort of
 
05:14:44.510 --> 05:14:44.520 align:start position:0%
reflect on if our immigration and and
 
05:14:48.948 --> 05:14:48.958 align:start position:0%
influx of of um newcomers slows down we
 
05:14:51.270 --> 05:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
may be in for a real problem here so I
 
05:14:53.230 --> 05:14:53.240 align:start position:0%
was pleased to see some of these
 
05:14:55.030 --> 05:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
initiatives and I'm wondering if you
 
05:14:56.750 --> 05:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
could maybe just give me a little more
 
05:15:00.030 --> 05:15:00.040 align:start position:0%
details I'm I'm being from NASA and I
 
05:15:02.190 --> 05:15:02.200 align:start position:0%
know the child care crisis a child care
 
05:15:03.470 --> 05:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
training program with greater
 
05:15:05.510 --> 05:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
nationville United Way um can you talk a
 
05:15:07.830 --> 05:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
little bit about what some of these
 
05:15:10.788 --> 05:15:10.798 align:start position:0%
services are in order to get these um
 
05:15:13.430 --> 05:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
people up and on their feet in a
 
05:15:16.628 --> 05:15:16.638 align:start position:0%
job I'd be happy to thank you
 
05:15:16.638 --> 05:15:18.350 align:start position:0%
job I'd be happy to thank you
representative

05:15:18.350 --> 05:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:15:20.868 --> 05:15:20.878 align:start position:0%
the general goal of the program is to
 
05:15:23.548 --> 05:15:23.558 align:start position:0%
ensure folks are employed but also to
 
05:15:26.350 --> 05:15:26.360 align:start position:0%
make sure that they're economically
 
05:15:28.470 --> 05:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
mobile as well so that if there's
 
05:15:30.548 --> 05:15:30.558 align:start position:0%
opportunities for training whether
 
05:15:32.230 --> 05:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
that's specific skill related whether
 
05:15:33.910 --> 05:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
that's language liberated they're able
 
05:15:37.510 --> 05:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
to achieve it and a lot of our partners
 
05:15:39.670 --> 05:15:39.680 align:start position:0%
are able to work with
 
05:15:42.070 --> 05:15:42.080 align:start position:0%
us and local Community Partners when I
 
05:15:43.548 --> 05:15:43.558 align:start position:0%
say Partners first I meant you know
 
05:15:45.190 --> 05:15:45.200 align:start position:0%
vendors the resettlement agencies the
 
05:15:47.110 --> 05:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
service providers to help set up
 
05:15:50.708 --> 05:15:50.718 align:start position:0%
training programs uh for clients uh
 
05:15:52.510 --> 05:15:52.520 align:start position:0%
something not included on here is
 
05:15:53.670 --> 05:15:53.680 align:start position:0%
actually one of the resettlement
 
05:15:56.430 --> 05:15:56.440 align:start position:0%
agencies is working to set up um a Child
 
05:15:59.230 --> 05:15:59.240 align:start position:0%
Care Program and refugees who had the
 
05:16:00.788 --> 05:16:00.798 align:start position:0%
proper training would actually be able
 
05:16:04.030 --> 05:16:04.040 align:start position:0%
to uh work there as well uh they've
 
05:16:07.110 --> 05:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
worked to set up licensing certification
 
05:16:09.990 --> 05:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
programs that uh
 
05:16:11.590 --> 05:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
refugees and clients are able to
 
05:16:14.868 --> 05:16:14.878 align:start position:0%
participate in and you know able to
 
05:16:18.150 --> 05:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
receive uh certification so they can
 
05:16:20.310 --> 05:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
continue to work in different areas and
 
05:16:23.430 --> 05:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
potentially higher paying roles as well
 
05:16:25.310 --> 05:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
uh there's overall data that suggests
 
05:16:26.948 --> 05:16:26.958 align:start position:0%
the current executive administration at
 
05:16:30.110 --> 05:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
the federal level uh conducted a study
 
05:16:32.230 --> 05:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
during their first term that looking at
 
05:16:36.070 --> 05:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
15 years of data from 2004 to 2019
 
05:16:38.390 --> 05:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
showing that refugees contributed more
 
05:16:40.708 --> 05:16:40.718 align:start position:0%
in revenue and and cost less and
 
05:16:42.750 --> 05:16:42.760 align:start position:0%
expenses than every other type of
 
05:16:44.788 --> 05:16:44.798 align:start position:0%
Resident and even if you accounted for
 
05:16:46.510 --> 05:16:46.520 align:start position:0%
the cost of their entire family they
 
05:16:47.990 --> 05:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
still contributed more in Revenue than
 
05:16:49.788 --> 05:16:49.798 align:start position:0%
the cost in expenses so generally
 
05:16:52.030 --> 05:16:52.040 align:start position:0%
speaking as you suggest they're uh
 
05:16:55.230 --> 05:16:55.240 align:start position:0%
valuable contributors from an economic
 
05:16:57.110 --> 05:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
perspective thank you very much for that
 
05:16:58.230 --> 05:16:58.240 align:start position:0%
I appreciate
 
05:17:01.430 --> 05:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
it representative seaworth thank you Mr
 
05:17:01.440 --> 05:17:03.670 align:start position:0%
it representative seaworth thank you Mr
chairman

05:17:03.670 --> 05:17:03.680 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
05:17:06.990 --> 05:17:07.000 align:start position:0%
um I want to look at the budget line for
 
05:17:09.190 --> 05:17:09.200 align:start position:0%
this and if you could help me under
 
05:17:12.470 --> 05:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
understand there's kind of a a down and
 
05:17:15.470 --> 05:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
back up in the in the budget where the
 
05:17:20.190 --> 05:17:20.200 align:start position:0%
2025 columns lower could you explain
 
05:17:22.030 --> 05:17:22.040 align:start position:0%
that Which accounting unit are you
 
05:17:25.030 --> 05:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
referring to so this is on the refugees
 
05:17:26.470 --> 05:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
uh page
 
05:17:29.070 --> 05:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
1043 and the number is you can either
 
05:17:31.230 --> 05:17:31.240 align:start position:0%
look at the federal revenues or the
 
05:17:32.868 --> 05:17:32.878 align:start position:0%
total spending for the Department
 
05:17:34.868 --> 05:17:34.878 align:start position:0%
because they
 
05:17:39.030 --> 05:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
equal m so the um
 
05:17:41.190 --> 05:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
so so so the the the question is why was
 
05:17:42.788 --> 05:17:42.798 align:start position:0%
the actual expense higher than the
 
05:17:46.510 --> 05:17:46.520 align:start position:0%
adjusted authorized in 20 in
 
05:17:50.628 --> 05:17:50.638 align:start position:0%
2025 yes or conversely wi is 2025 kind
 
05:17:53.350 --> 05:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
of stand out as the authorized expense
 
05:17:56.390 --> 05:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
so much lower sure so one thing that
 
05:17:59.270 --> 05:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
we've seen happen in this current bium
 
05:18:01.030 --> 05:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
and um members of the fiscal committee
 
05:18:03.350 --> 05:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
are familiar with this we've had to come
 
05:18:05.510 --> 05:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
back through um since the original
 
05:18:07.670 --> 05:18:07.680 align:start position:0%
budget was passed for the current bium
 
05:18:09.910 --> 05:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
and accept a diff additional Federal
 
05:18:12.390 --> 05:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
Awards uh through that fiscal process
 
05:18:14.430 --> 05:18:14.440 align:start position:0%
and so we I don't remember the exact
 
05:18:16.150 --> 05:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
number but it was in the millions of
 
05:18:19.230 --> 05:18:19.240 align:start position:0%
dollars of additional funding that we
 
05:18:22.868 --> 05:18:22.878 align:start position:0%
received um in in in subsequent Awards
 
05:18:24.910 --> 05:18:24.920 align:start position:0%
after the budget was approved that that
 
05:18:26.788 --> 05:18:26.798 align:start position:0%
are represented in the actual expense
 
05:18:28.708 --> 05:18:28.718 align:start position:0%
those funds were added to those to the
 
05:18:31.390 --> 05:18:31.400 align:start position:0%
refugee contracts that we have with our
 
05:18:33.750 --> 05:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
providers in the community um I think
 
05:18:35.070 --> 05:18:35.080 align:start position:0%
one really important thing just to point
 
05:18:37.110 --> 05:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
out for the committee this is a 100%
 
05:18:39.390 --> 05:18:39.400 align:start position:0%
federally funded program by the by the
 
05:18:41.708 --> 05:18:41.718 align:start position:0%
federal government and so it can be
 
05:18:45.190 --> 05:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
difficult to project what award amount
 
05:18:47.548 --> 05:18:47.558 align:start position:0%
we may get um sort of as rubben alluded
 
05:18:49.590 --> 05:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
to we don't necessarily know what the
 
05:18:51.830 --> 05:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
policy of the federal government will be
 
05:18:54.190 --> 05:18:54.200 align:start position:0%
we don't know what humanitarian crisises
 
05:18:56.628 --> 05:18:56.638 align:start position:0%
may be occurring in the next two years
 
05:18:59.270 --> 05:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
and and so we will from time to time see
 
05:19:01.430 --> 05:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
significant fluctuations in the federal
 
05:19:03.548 --> 05:19:03.558 align:start position:0%
funding that we receive that we did not
 
05:19:07.150 --> 05:19:07.160 align:start position:0%
anticipate and as he suggested we in the
 
05:19:08.788 --> 05:19:08.798 align:start position:0%
past have received influx of funds
 
05:19:11.350 --> 05:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
particularly for the Afghan population
 
05:19:14.470 --> 05:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
for the ukrainians as well during those
 
05:19:18.310 --> 05:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
uh programs and so we are just told here
 
05:19:21.070 --> 05:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
are the funds please uh try to expend
 
05:19:22.510 --> 05:19:22.520 align:start position:0%
these as soon as you can and get them
 
05:19:26.510 --> 05:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
contracted as soon as you can so in in
 
05:19:28.910 --> 05:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
light of that the projection going
 
05:19:31.708 --> 05:19:31.718 align:start position:0%
forward of it looks like around a 10%
 
05:19:35.590 --> 05:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
increase how confident or not
 
05:19:39.910 --> 05:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
confident is the 26 27 number
 
05:19:41.548 --> 05:19:41.558 align:start position:0%
I I think it's important to remember
 
05:19:44.470 --> 05:19:44.480 align:start position:0%
that we prepared this back in August um
 
05:19:45.510 --> 05:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
things may have looked a little
 
05:19:47.310 --> 05:19:47.320 align:start position:0%
differently back in August than they do
 
05:19:50.350 --> 05:19:50.360 align:start position:0%
today um so uh we can certainly take
 
05:19:53.670 --> 05:19:53.680 align:start position:0%
that back and and try to project what we
 
05:19:57.470 --> 05:19:57.480 align:start position:0%
may think may happen um we could revise
 
05:20:00.030 --> 05:20:00.040 align:start position:0%
the federal funds downward if we do that
 
05:20:01.430 --> 05:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
then we just run the risk of having to
 
05:20:02.910 --> 05:20:02.920 align:start position:0%
come back through fiscal to accept
 
05:20:04.270 --> 05:20:04.280 align:start position:0%
additional federal funds that we didn't
 
05:20:06.548 --> 05:20:06.558 align:start position:0%
anticipate this is just part of the U
 
05:20:07.990 --> 05:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
part of The Balancing Act here where we
 
05:20:10.110 --> 05:20:10.120 align:start position:0%
can't control what's driving the expense
 
05:20:13.070 --> 05:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:16.910 --> 05:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
revenue so I'm I'm um I'm looking at the
 
05:20:20.788 --> 05:20:20.798 align:start position:0%
number of positions on page
 
05:20:24.270 --> 05:20:24.280 align:start position:0%
1043 uh for the refugee
 
05:20:26.948 --> 05:20:26.958 align:start position:0%
Services uh I I want to understand the
 
05:20:30.270 --> 05:20:30.280 align:start position:0%
three um if if there were not another
 
05:20:33.670 --> 05:20:33.680 align:start position:0%
single Refugee brought to New Hampshire
 
05:20:35.910 --> 05:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
how how many of these people would we
 
05:20:39.030 --> 05:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
need to retain
 
05:20:40.470 --> 05:20:40.480 align:start position:0%
and I I don't I shouldn't have said
 
05:20:43.150 --> 05:20:43.160 align:start position:0%
people I I really mean positions because
 
05:20:48.670 --> 05:20:48.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:51.670 --> 05:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
are so we currently have three vacancies
 
05:20:54.030 --> 05:20:54.040 align:start position:0%
on that team one of which you know it's
 
05:20:55.350 --> 05:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
particularly important the health
 
05:20:57.750 --> 05:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
coordinator position so all of these are
 
05:21:00.350 --> 05:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
vacant currently the the three on the
 
05:21:02.310 --> 05:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
org chart you'll look and see that
 
05:21:03.708 --> 05:21:03.718 align:start position:0%
there's the health coordinator position
 
05:21:05.390 --> 05:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
that's vacant the data analyst and the
 
05:21:09.470 --> 05:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
Outreach coordinator uh the in in stes
 
05:21:11.390 --> 05:21:11.400 align:start position:0%
the two that are always mentioned in in
 
05:21:12.990 --> 05:21:13.000 align:start position:0%
statute are the state Refugee
 
05:21:15.110 --> 05:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
coordinator and the health coordinator
 
05:21:17.350 --> 05:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
Health coordinator was due to the high
 
05:21:20.670 --> 05:21:20.680 align:start position:0%
ring freeze we could not make a hire uh
 
05:21:23.150 --> 05:21:23.160 align:start position:0%
it all of these the those three
 
05:21:24.548 --> 05:21:24.558 align:start position:0%
positions that are filled in the health
 
05:21:26.470 --> 05:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
coordinator position would all still be
 
05:21:28.070 --> 05:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
valuable because You' still have folks
 
05:21:30.990 --> 05:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
in the state who still need to be served
 
05:21:32.830 --> 05:21:32.840 align:start position:0%
you could also still have clients who
 
05:21:34.948 --> 05:21:34.958 align:start position:0%
come from different states and even if
 
05:21:37.070 --> 05:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
you don't have refugees who come in
 
05:21:39.990 --> 05:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
let's say the four Monon pause is
 
05:21:42.190 --> 05:21:42.200 align:start position:0%
extended you would still have potential
 
05:21:43.788 --> 05:21:43.798 align:start position:0%
folks coming from different Pathways
 
05:21:46.948 --> 05:21:46.958 align:start position:0%
like sivs ases who are still going to
 
05:21:48.910 --> 05:21:48.920 align:start position:0%
need services and
 
05:21:51.548 --> 05:21:51.558 align:start position:0%
assistance that's also why we have two
 
05:21:54.030 --> 05:21:54.040 align:start position:0%
of the positions vacant and on hold the
 
05:21:56.310 --> 05:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
data specialist and the Outreach
 
05:21:57.670 --> 05:21:57.680 align:start position:0%
coordinator that we have not sought to
 
05:21:59.948 --> 05:21:59.958 align:start position:0%
fill given the current state of the
 
05:22:03.030 --> 05:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
program at the federal level okay and
 
05:22:07.628 --> 05:22:07.638 align:start position:0%
and similarly talk about the positions
 
05:22:10.548 --> 05:22:10.558 align:start position:0%
that are under under uh minority health
 
05:22:13.788 --> 05:22:13.798 align:start position:0%
and Refugee Affairs give give us an idea
 
05:22:16.270 --> 05:22:16.280 align:start position:0%
of I know what the one unclassified
 
05:22:19.948 --> 05:22:19.958 align:start position:0%
position is but talk talk us through the
 
05:22:19.958 --> 05:22:21.670 align:start position:0%
position is but talk talk us through the
the

05:22:21.670 --> 05:22:21.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:22:24.990 --> 05:22:25.000 align:start position:0%
six on permanent
 
05:22:28.350 --> 05:22:28.360 align:start position:0%
classified so these are in we have the
 
05:22:31.548 --> 05:22:31.558 align:start position:0%
two communication access roles um which
 
05:22:35.590 --> 05:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
deal with uh a myriad of requests uh
 
05:22:37.990 --> 05:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
often related to compliance we train uh
 
05:22:40.548 --> 05:22:40.558 align:start position:0%
folks in internally externally vendors
 
05:22:43.270 --> 05:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
uh work to improve our internal systems
 
05:22:45.708 --> 05:22:45.718 align:start position:0%
and processes again to provide you know
 
05:22:47.350 --> 05:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
better services in addition to the
 
05:22:50.030 --> 05:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
compliance pieces uh there is the
 
05:22:52.590 --> 05:22:52.600 align:start position:0%
administrative role which will also be
 
05:22:54.230 --> 05:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
assisting with the communication access
 
05:22:57.670 --> 05:22:57.680 align:start position:0%
pieces given available bandwidth uh we
 
05:23:00.110 --> 05:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
have a community outreach and engagement
 
05:23:01.670 --> 05:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
role that we have filled for the
 
05:23:03.230 --> 05:23:03.240 align:start position:0%
community outreach and engagement pieces
 
05:23:05.910 --> 05:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
the other is on hold due to the hiring
 
05:23:08.470 --> 05:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
freeze and we have the behavioral health
 
05:23:10.270 --> 05:23:10.280 align:start position:0%
listic competence coordinator which is
 
05:23:11.708 --> 05:23:11.718 align:start position:0%
going to be assisting with community
 
05:23:14.110 --> 05:23:14.120 align:start position:0%
outreach also helps with communication
 
05:23:16.430 --> 05:23:16.440 align:start position:0%
access as well and does some trainings
 
05:23:19.670 --> 05:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
couple for Behavioral Health for example
 
05:23:22.868 --> 05:23:22.878 align:start position:0%
QPR Mental Health First
 
05:23:26.590 --> 05:23:26.600 align:start position:0%
Aid so show of the 11 it sounds like you
 
05:23:29.190 --> 05:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
have four currently that are vacant and
 
05:23:32.948 --> 05:23:32.958 align:start position:0%
subject to a hiring freeze yes uh two of
 
05:23:35.030 --> 05:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
them we were at the reference stage four
 
05:23:37.030 --> 05:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
and uh can proceed no further two of
 
05:23:38.590 --> 05:23:38.600 align:start position:0%
them we were going to keep on hold
 
05:23:40.390 --> 05:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
depending what's going on with the
 
05:23:41.990 --> 05:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
refugee program at the federal level
 
05:23:43.830 --> 05:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
first category of the first two I I'm
 
05:23:46.868 --> 05:23:46.878 align:start position:0%
not sure I've heard that term so to uh
 
05:23:48.628 --> 05:23:48.638 align:start position:0%
we were about we were at the reference
 
05:23:51.270 --> 05:23:51.280 align:start position:0%
stage for we were we were doing
 
05:23:52.750 --> 05:23:52.760 align:start position:0%
reference checks for and we had the
 
05:23:54.750 --> 05:23:54.760 align:start position:0%
whole oh so they thought they were going
 
05:23:56.390 --> 05:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
to be employed because we started a
 
05:23:58.430 --> 05:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
reference check and then we froze I
 
05:24:00.990 --> 05:24:01.000 align:start position:0%
can't I can't speak to the the thought
 
05:24:03.030 --> 05:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
there but yes we were very close hiring
 
05:24:05.670 --> 05:24:05.680 align:start position:0%
free hit so we can not fill them two of
 
05:24:07.190 --> 05:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
the refugee program positions we
 
05:24:08.750 --> 05:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
intended to keep on hold depending
 
05:24:10.548 --> 05:24:10.558 align:start position:0%
what's going on at the federal level and
 
05:24:12.350 --> 05:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
and what kind of job descriptions are
 
05:24:14.430 --> 05:24:14.440 align:start position:0%
these what kind of skill set or
 
05:24:17.750 --> 05:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
education are are you requiring so for
 
05:24:20.190 --> 05:24:20.200 align:start position:0%
the two the state Refugee Health
 
05:24:22.310 --> 05:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
coordinator has a pretty specific skill
 
05:24:23.510 --> 05:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
set because you want someone with a
 
05:24:25.628 --> 05:24:25.638 align:start position:0%
refugee background and also the health
 
05:24:27.910 --> 05:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
background as well because they have to
 
05:24:30.230 --> 05:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
have familiarity with the type of exams
 
05:24:32.110 --> 05:24:32.120 align:start position:0%
that refugees must go under and the
 
05:24:33.548 --> 05:24:33.558 align:start position:0%
healthcare infrastructure but also
 
05:24:36.070 --> 05:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
Refugee resettlement generally uh the
 
05:24:37.670 --> 05:24:37.680 align:start position:0%
community outreach role you'd want
 
05:24:40.150 --> 05:24:40.160 align:start position:0%
someone who has experience in community
 
05:24:42.788 --> 05:24:42.798 align:start position:0%
outreach engagement but also strategy as
 
05:24:44.310 --> 05:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
well when it comes to looking at the
 
05:24:46.990 --> 05:24:47.000 align:start position:0%
state and uh what gaps do we have what
 
05:24:50.708 --> 05:24:50.718 align:start position:0%
do we need so those for those two rol
 
05:24:52.310 --> 05:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
specifically at a high Lev and you're
 
05:24:54.070 --> 05:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
able to find people with Refugee
 
05:24:57.830 --> 05:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
backgrounds uh we were able to Yes it it
 
05:25:00.510 --> 05:25:00.520 align:start position:0%
took a bit but we
 
05:25:03.070 --> 05:25:03.080 align:start position:0%
were other
 
05:25:05.830 --> 05:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
questions a representative Stringham um
 
05:25:08.548 --> 05:25:08.558 align:start position:0%
just this this program is uh to the best
 
05:25:09.990 --> 05:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
of everybody's knowledge is still
 
05:25:13.350 --> 05:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
actively being funded and if we Ur
 
05:25:18.990 --> 05:25:19.000 align:start position:0%
expenses uh under under 7209 um the 100%
 
05:25:21.868 --> 05:25:21.878 align:start position:0%
federal funds is is still ongoing still
 
05:25:28.708 --> 05:25:28.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:31.390 --> 05:25:31.400 align:start position:0%
funded that that I don't see any other
 
05:25:34.230 --> 05:25:34.240 align:start position:0%
questions uh rep commissioner do you do
 
05:25:36.350 --> 05:25:36.360 align:start position:0%
you have any final thoughts for us on
 
05:25:38.708 --> 05:25:38.718 align:start position:0%
this subject it's really it's really I
 
05:25:41.350 --> 05:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
almost apologize it's been such a a
 
05:25:44.708 --> 05:25:44.718 align:start position:0%
contentious hot issue but um but that's
 
05:25:46.548 --> 05:25:46.558 align:start position:0%
where we're at do you have anything for
 
05:25:50.190 --> 05:25:50.200 align:start position:0%

it thank you representative all right um
 
05:26:03.430 --> 05:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
so with that I think that concludes uh
 
05:26:05.868 --> 05:26:05.878 align:start position:0%
our expected presentations do you want
 
05:26:09.270 --> 05:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
to wrap us up somehow Mr White
 
05:26:13.470 --> 05:26:13.480 align:start position:0%
uh sure um so I appreciate everyone's uh
 
05:26:15.948 --> 05:26:15.958 align:start position:0%
attention and questions today on the on
 
05:26:18.548 --> 05:26:18.558 align:start position:0%
the overall operating budget I think Ju
 
05:26:20.788 --> 05:26:20.798 align:start position:0%
Just in summary one one important thing
 
05:26:23.150 --> 05:26:23.160 align:start position:0%
that I kind of think about is much of
 
05:26:25.270 --> 05:26:25.280 align:start position:0%
what you've seen today are the are the
 
05:26:27.750 --> 05:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
people and the systems that support the
 
05:26:30.190 --> 05:26:30.200 align:start position:0%
overarching operations it's it's it ends
 
05:26:32.750 --> 05:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
up being about I think back the envelope
 
05:26:37.230 --> 05:26:37.240 align:start position:0%
math about 7% of our total budget um
 
05:26:40.310 --> 05:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
that that supports everything else so um
 
05:26:41.670 --> 05:26:41.680 align:start position:0%
you know that that's where we kind of
 
05:26:43.990 --> 05:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to start to give you a sense of
 
05:26:47.708 --> 05:26:47.718 align:start position:0%
of what are the underlying um functions
 
05:26:49.470 --> 05:26:49.480 align:start position:0%
that support all of the subsequent
 
05:26:50.470 --> 05:26:50.480 align:start position:0%
divisions that we're going to be
 
05:26:53.310 --> 05:26:53.320 align:start position:0%
discussing um Henry Litman will be here
 
05:26:57.070 --> 05:26:57.080 align:start position:0%
on Friday um discussing Medicaid all day
 
05:26:59.628 --> 05:26:59.638 align:start position:0%
long and uh looking forward to it if
 
05:27:01.310 --> 05:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
there's any questions or any specific
 
05:27:03.350 --> 05:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
issues that we that weren't discussed
 
05:27:05.670 --> 05:27:05.680 align:start position:0%
yesterday or today um that you're
 
05:27:07.270 --> 05:27:07.280 align:start position:0%
looking for questions in advance of that
 
05:27:08.830 --> 05:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
please let us know we'll be preparing
 
05:27:11.350 --> 05:27:11.360 align:start position:0%
for that in the intermediary I I I I I
 
05:27:13.868 --> 05:27:13.878 align:start position:0%
have a couple clues in that regard yes
 
05:27:16.190 --> 05:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
um I I don't know what who created the
 
05:27:17.868 --> 05:27:17.878 align:start position:0%
sheet but there's a sheet that's been
 
05:27:20.548 --> 05:27:20.558 align:start position:0%
floating around that's got five proposed
 
05:27:23.830 --> 05:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
significant changes to Medicaid that are
 
05:27:25.948 --> 05:27:25.958 align:start position:0%
reflected in the governor's budget you
 
05:27:28.470 --> 05:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
know one of them is I I don't even know
 
05:27:30.750 --> 05:27:30.760 align:start position:0%
I don't even remember what the five are
 
05:27:32.788 --> 05:27:32.798 align:start position:0%
but I think those are probably
 
05:27:35.390 --> 05:27:35.400 align:start position:0%
historically in the last 6 months the
 
05:27:38.788 --> 05:27:38.798 align:start position:0%
the five of the many that Mr Litman
 
05:27:40.948 --> 05:27:40.958 align:start position:0%
worked on for which there was a a
 
05:27:43.030 --> 05:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
Medicaid impact statement done and
 
05:27:45.510 --> 05:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
considered by the governor's office I'd
 
05:27:49.628 --> 05:27:49.638 align:start position:0%
be curious in the other topics that were
 
05:27:52.190 --> 05:27:52.200 align:start position:0%
looked at for changes to Medicaid that
 
05:27:54.750 --> 05:27:54.760 align:start position:0%
were not accepted by the governor's
 
05:27:57.310 --> 05:27:57.320 align:start position:0%
office what what do you think about that
 
05:27:59.390 --> 05:27:59.400 align:start position:0%
um so the governor's office is working
 
05:28:01.990 --> 05:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
on finalizing the hb2 provisions so that
 
05:28:04.070 --> 05:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
it's clear uh to the committee what the
 
05:28:05.948 --> 05:28:05.958 align:start position:0%
changes are relative to premiums
 
05:28:08.230 --> 05:28:08.240 align:start position:0%
eligibility in cost sharing and so we
 
05:28:10.548 --> 05:28:10.558 align:start position:0%
will be going into details on that and
 
05:28:13.470 --> 05:28:13.480 align:start position:0%
then we are um working on getting that
 
05:28:15.910 --> 05:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
information uh that that has been
 
05:28:18.390 --> 05:28:18.400 align:start position:0%
requested okay so then the other part of
 
05:28:20.670 --> 05:28:20.680 align:start position:0%
the request are the ones that didn't get
 
05:28:22.470 --> 05:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
accepted by the governor that we may
 
05:28:25.070 --> 05:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
still need to consider yeah I I I think
 
05:28:27.230 --> 05:28:27.240 align:start position:0%
we can certainly talk about that um part
 
05:28:30.230 --> 05:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
of part of what uh you will see on
 
05:28:33.190 --> 05:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
Friday is we were primarily looking at
 
05:28:35.350 --> 05:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
um or the governor's offices primarily
 
05:28:38.548 --> 05:28:38.558 align:start position:0%
included the eligibility as as far as
 
05:28:40.788 --> 05:28:40.798 align:start position:0%
coming into the system and not taking
 
05:28:43.670 --> 05:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
away current benefits that exist today
 
05:28:45.750 --> 05:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
um I think that's uh sort of a it's a
 
05:28:47.510 --> 05:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
very different conversation one's
 
05:28:50.510 --> 05:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
reducing what's received today one is uh
 
05:28:52.868 --> 05:28:52.878 align:start position:0%
basically um restricting sort of your
 
05:28:55.830 --> 05:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
inputs into the system um and and we'll
 
05:28:57.788 --> 05:28:57.798 align:start position:0%
be prepared to talk about both those
 
05:29:00.590 --> 05:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
super and then I I just thought of one
 
05:29:02.750 --> 05:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
of the questions I meant for Mr weers
 
05:29:08.270 --> 05:29:08.280 align:start position:0%
and and it um uh
 
05:29:11.548 --> 05:29:11.558 align:start position:0%
there is a two capital budget items one
 
05:29:14.470 --> 05:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
of them for about $33 million and the
 
05:29:17.548 --> 05:29:17.558 align:start position:0%
other one for about3 million of which
 
05:29:21.910 --> 05:29:21.920 align:start position:0%
most of it's Federal but but I'm curious
 
05:29:24.590 --> 05:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
uh do those Capital budgets
 
05:29:27.750 --> 05:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
contain money for the Consultants that
 
05:29:30.110 --> 05:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
would be necessary to implement it if
 
05:29:33.190 --> 05:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
the capital budget is approved or am I
 
05:29:37.030 --> 05:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
having to worry about consultancy in the
 
05:29:41.070 --> 05:29:41.080 align:start position:0%
hb1 to support potential Capital budgets
 
05:29:43.670 --> 05:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
yep so the um the first item the 33
 
05:29:46.910 --> 05:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
million and change uh for the the mmes
 
05:29:50.830 --> 05:29:50.840 align:start position:0%
our modularization project um it's
 
05:29:52.390 --> 05:29:52.400 align:start position:0%
important to understand a that that's a
 
05:29:54.788 --> 05:29:54.798 align:start position:0%
9010 match so we're getting 90% federal
 
05:29:57.030 --> 05:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
funds for every 10 every 10% of General
 
05:29:59.270 --> 05:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
funds and we would be paying uh for
 
05:30:01.270 --> 05:30:01.280 align:start position:0%
those Consultants out of that capital
 
05:30:03.590 --> 05:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
budget so we would not expect to have a
 
05:30:05.070 --> 05:30:05.080 align:start position:0%
discussion or see anything in the
 
05:30:07.230 --> 05:30:07.240 align:start position:0%
operating budget on that specific topic
 
05:30:09.510 --> 05:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
here that's answer my question thank you
 
05:30:12.390 --> 05:30:12.400 align:start position:0%
of course and representative Stringham
 
05:30:14.670 --> 05:30:14.680 align:start position:0%
you got it I'm oh representative tki I
 
05:30:17.470 --> 05:30:17.480 align:start position:0%
had one um I am a little disappointed
 
05:30:19.070 --> 05:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
that we're doing Medicaid on Friday when
 
05:30:20.628 --> 05:30:20.638 align:start position:0%
we haven't seen the Medicaid changes
 
05:30:22.750 --> 05:30:22.760 align:start position:0%
that are being proposed by the governor
 
05:30:25.548 --> 05:30:25.558 align:start position:0%
and I'm afraid that we booked a big
 
05:30:27.070 --> 05:30:27.080 align:start position:0%
block of time which is great but we're
 
05:30:28.830 --> 05:30:28.840 align:start position:0%
not going to have the materials needed
 
05:30:31.030 --> 05:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
are we going to be able to have drafts
 
05:30:34.070 --> 05:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
before us I spoke with um Michael Kane
 
05:30:36.190 --> 05:30:36.200 align:start position:0%
today and he did not anticipate that we
 
05:30:39.030 --> 05:30:39.040 align:start position:0%
would have what we needed by Friday I'll
 
05:30:42.150 --> 05:30:42.160 align:start position:0%
jump in on that grenade uh I I have a
 
05:30:45.548 --> 05:30:45.558 align:start position:0%
hard copy of the five in my office and I
 
05:30:50.350 --> 05:30:50.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:52.868 --> 05:30:52.878 align:start position:0%
photocopied I guess I would like an is
 
05:30:54.390 --> 05:30:54.400 align:start position:0%
it official I'd like an official
 
05:30:56.670 --> 05:30:56.680 align:start position:0%
distribution of some sort it concerns me
 
05:30:58.350 --> 05:30:58.360 align:start position:0%
that we haven't had a chance to review
 
05:31:00.788 --> 05:31:00.798 align:start position:0%
things it's not official because uh Mr
 
05:31:03.190 --> 05:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
White just said it's got to go into hb2
 
05:31:05.590 --> 05:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
before it's official I I can give you
 
05:31:07.070 --> 05:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
what they're working on the five if
 
05:31:09.230 --> 05:31:09.240 align:start position:0%
you'd like or not I would like to see it
 
05:31:10.510 --> 05:31:10.520 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm just concerned that we're
 
05:31:12.150 --> 05:31:12.160 align:start position:0%
going to have a deep dive into Medicaid
 
05:31:14.390 --> 05:31:14.400 align:start position:0%
and we have a whole chunk of hb2 that we
 
05:31:16.788 --> 05:31:16.798 align:start position:0%
don't have a draft of I I I think what
 
05:31:19.150 --> 05:31:19.160 align:start position:0%
we will be able to do is we will be able
 
05:31:23.350 --> 05:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
to speak to the specifics um it's just
 
05:31:25.310 --> 05:31:25.320 align:start position:0%
uh the the tricky situation that we're
 
05:31:27.350 --> 05:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
in of course is that we don't yet have
 
05:31:30.590 --> 05:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
the specific hb2 Provisions finalized
 
05:31:32.990 --> 05:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
however um I I would anticipate that
 
05:31:35.350 --> 05:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
they will be fairly straightforward as
 
05:31:38.510 --> 05:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
far as um you know we we will be able to
 
05:31:40.110 --> 05:31:40.120 align:start position:0%
say you know
 
05:31:43.788 --> 05:31:43.798 align:start position:0%
x% of this particular uh standard
 
05:31:45.868 --> 05:31:45.878 align:start position:0%
Medicaid population will now have cost
 
05:31:47.510 --> 05:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
sharing or a premium or whatever it
 
05:31:49.510 --> 05:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
might be so we will be able to get into
 
05:31:51.030 --> 05:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
those details we just won't have the
 
05:31:53.788 --> 05:31:53.798 align:start position:0%
final hb2 to work from but but I don't
 
05:31:55.628 --> 05:31:55.638 align:start position:0%
think it will be wasted time by any
 
05:31:57.510 --> 05:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
means if it's possible that we could get
 
05:32:00.350 --> 05:32:00.360 align:start position:0%
as much Advanced um documentation on
 
05:32:02.150 --> 05:32:02.160 align:start position:0%
that I think that it's better than us
 
05:32:04.510 --> 05:32:04.520 align:start position:0%
coming in cold on Friday make us better
 
05:32:06.590 --> 05:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
prepared to handle the conversation of
 
05:32:09.390 --> 05:32:09.400 align:start position:0%
course thank you and if not adequate
 
05:32:11.150 --> 05:32:11.160 align:start position:0%
because it's such a huge part of the
 
05:32:13.390 --> 05:32:13.400 align:start position:0%
budget if if you don't believe it's
 
05:32:15.590 --> 05:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
adequate we'll we'll schedule a second I
 
05:32:17.548 --> 05:32:17.558 align:start position:0%
think we're going to have to anyway
 
05:32:18.910 --> 05:32:18.920 align:start position:0%
because it's a huge part of the budget
 
05:32:20.948 --> 05:32:20.958 align:start position:0%
so that's great thank you all right uh
 
05:32:23.150 --> 05:32:23.160 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple would would you would you
 
05:32:26.548 --> 05:32:26.558 align:start position:0%
please start thinking about our calendar
 
05:32:29.390 --> 05:32:29.400 align:start position:0%
and where we might add sort of a second
 
05:32:31.390 --> 05:32:31.400 align:start position:0%
scoop of the ice cream for some of these
 
05:32:34.110 --> 05:32:34.120 align:start position:0%
things like Medicaid sure I will so as
 
05:32:36.110 --> 05:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
the calendar stands now March 11th is
 
05:32:37.910 --> 05:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
the last presentation date so you'll
 
05:32:40.510 --> 05:32:40.520 align:start position:0%
still have a little bit in excess of two
 
05:32:42.430 --> 05:32:42.440 align:start position:0%
weeks before the division after that
 
05:32:43.628 --> 05:32:43.638 align:start position:0%
before the division will need to make
 
05:32:45.110 --> 05:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
its recommendations so there will be
 
05:32:46.708 --> 05:32:46.718 align:start position:0%
time for a second go around to some of
 
05:32:50.230 --> 05:32:50.240 align:start position:0%
these so say again the drop dead date
 
05:32:52.548 --> 05:32:52.558 align:start position:0%
for division three to know what we want
 
05:32:55.270 --> 05:32:55.280 align:start position:0%
to say to the full finance committee um
 
05:32:59.628 --> 05:32:59.638 align:start position:0%
I believe we had been using March 27th
 
05:33:01.350 --> 05:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
as the drop dead date but I do just want
 
05:33:03.030 --> 05:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
to confirm that and that that's
 
05:33:04.310 --> 05:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
consistent with what the other divisions
 
05:33:06.590 --> 05:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
are doing too all
 
05:33:11.628 --> 05:33:11.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:14.510 --> 05:33:14.520 align:start position:0%
tki represent Stringham representative
 
05:33:16.788 --> 05:33:16.798 align:start position:0%
Stringham just in terms of the numbers

Medicaid you know we obviously saw some
 
05:33:23.548 --> 05:33:23.558 align:start position:0%
pretty uh strong uh significant
 
05:33:25.868 --> 05:33:25.878 align:start position:0%
reductions does that incorporate
 
05:33:27.430 --> 05:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
everything that's being worked on or
 
05:33:30.510 --> 05:33:30.520 align:start position:0%
those numbers change with these uh
 
05:33:33.390 --> 05:33:33.400 align:start position:0%
revisions to hb2 those numbers reflect
 
05:33:38.708 --> 05:33:38.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:39.990 --> 05:33:40.000 align:start position:0%

05:33:42.150 --> 05:33:42.160 align:start position:0%

05:33:57.868 --> 05:33:57.878 align:start position:0%
Friday afternoon yep Friday afternoon
 
05:33:59.948 --> 05:33:59.958 align:start position:0%
Medicaid at 1:00 it wasn't in the last
 
05:34:01.868 --> 05:34:01.878 align:start position:0%
calendar but it'll be in the calendar
 
05:34:04.310 --> 05:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
that comes out tomorrow and and what's
 
05:34:06.750 --> 05:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
our status on when we're going to hear
 
05:34:09.510 --> 05:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
the non- gerain amendment to
 
05:34:12.190 --> 05:34:12.200 align:start position:0%
hp71 so I've asked Janet to schedule
 
05:34:13.788 --> 05:34:13.798 align:start position:0%
that for the next time there's a full
 
05:34:15.390 --> 05:34:15.400 align:start position:0%
finance committee hearing but at this
 
05:34:17.150 --> 05:34:17.160 align:start position:0%
point I don't think there are any bills
 
05:34:19.990 --> 05:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
that have come out of the divisions yet
 
05:34:23.230 --> 05:34:23.240 align:start position:0%
um for that meeting to be held how how
 
05:34:26.310 --> 05:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
about the amendment do do we I'm so
 
05:34:28.628 --> 05:34:28.638 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm confused by this are we do we
 
05:34:32.670 --> 05:34:32.680 align:start position:0%
need to have a a specific hearing on the
 
05:34:35.708 --> 05:34:35.718 align:start position:0%
amendment that we heard for 519 that we
 
05:34:38.548 --> 05:34:38.558 align:start position:0%
are now wanting to attach or thinking we
 
05:34:42.070 --> 05:34:42.080 align:start position:0%
want to attach to 71 is that its own yes
 
05:34:44.230 --> 05:34:44.240 align:start position:0%
yes you will and I my understanding was
 
05:34:45.430 --> 05:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
that would be scheduled for the next
 
05:34:47.510 --> 05:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
full finance committee meeting but
 
05:34:49.190 --> 05:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
there's no other business to come before
 
05:34:51.270 --> 05:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
full Finance as of yet so I think it's
 
05:34:52.750 --> 05:34:52.760 align:start position:0%
going to be scheduled in combination
 
05:34:55.030 --> 05:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
with some other things okay that's
 
05:34:56.590 --> 05:34:56.600 align:start position:0%
that's more clear do you have anything
 
05:34:56.600 --> 05:34:57.868 align:start position:0%
that's more clear do you have anything
to

05:34:57.868 --> 05:34:57.878 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:34:57.878 --> 05:35:00.030 align:start position:0%
to
add

05:35:00.030 --> 05:35:00.040 align:start position:0%
add
 
05:35:03.910 --> 05:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
okay all right then with that uh we are
 
05:35:06.628 --> 05:35:06.638 align:start position:0%
adjourned thank you very
